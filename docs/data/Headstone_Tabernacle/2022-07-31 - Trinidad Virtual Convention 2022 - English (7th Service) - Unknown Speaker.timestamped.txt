[32:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[32:42] hallelujah
[32:44] thank you jesus
[32:46] amen
[32:50] at this time we want to invite one of
[32:52] our
[32:54] minister and brethren to come and
[32:57] bring some greetings to us
[32:59] i know that will be a tremendous
[33:01] blessing
[33:02] you may have your seats says
[33:04] he comes forward god bless you
[33:10] so we bring greetings
[33:12] to
[33:12] the
[33:14] pastor brother theo ovid
[33:16] and the saints of headstone tabernacle
[33:19] on this virtual convention
[33:22] uh
[33:23] from the saints and trinidad at yadal
[33:25] tabernacle
[33:27] so tonight has fallen by lot to greet
[33:29] you all in the name of the lord jesus
[33:30] christ
[33:32] i want to take a short little thought on
[33:33] the war horse because cena we're talking
[33:35] about preparing for battle and that's
[33:37] the inspiration
[33:39] we want to look at the warhorse because
[33:42] we're under the message of elijah
[33:44] and elijah left
[33:45] a mantle for elisha
[33:48] so elisha when he got the mantle it was
[33:50] already a working mantra he left a
[33:52] inspired mantle hallelujah
[33:55] so our elijah in this day brother he
[33:57] left us a war horse
[34:00] brother a white charger by god's grace
[34:03] brother and he said i'll ride this trail
[34:05] one more time but he also said she will
[34:07] ride this trail one more time he also
[34:09] said we will ride this trail one more
[34:11] time
[34:12] so brother we are we have been left a
[34:14] horse to ride a trail
[34:16] so we find that horse in the scripture
[34:19] we find that was in job 39
[34:22] 19 so let's see if we can look at it
[34:24] quickly
[34:26] has doubt given
[34:28] the horse strength
[34:30] god is accent joe god continuing the
[34:32] parable as thou given the whole strength
[34:35] so he's a strong powerful anointed
[34:37] omnipotent supernatural horse
[34:41] god taken in natural type in the
[34:43] spiritual
[34:44] brother
[34:46] the strength is identified
[34:50] god's earthly strength is his word made
[34:52] flesh in his body
[34:54] so as much as god's word is made
[34:56] strengthen you the bride
[34:58] brother that is how strong god could be
[35:00] on the face of the earth and you realize
[35:03] just that question that god put the job
[35:05] there it shows predestination
[35:08] because has dow given the horse's
[35:11] strength where the horse get it from he
[35:13] was getting from almighty god
[35:15] he was didn't get his strength from his
[35:16] father he got his strength from almighty
[35:19] god
[35:20] who gave his grandfather grandfather
[35:21] grandfather the strength
[35:23] so all things that we have whatever man
[35:27] is brother he has got it from god
[35:29] so paul said why both
[35:31] why pretend to be better than somebody
[35:33] else when what you have you got it from
[35:34] god
[35:36] so brother it shows us predestination
[35:40] it shows us that we have inside of us
[35:42] the ability to ride at us
[35:45] the ability to be the other half the
[35:47] matching piece so that that that
[35:49] masterpiece hallelujah hallelujah the
[35:51] horse is the masterpiece we are the
[35:53] adapt
[35:54] piece of that masterpiece we are the
[35:55] merchant peace
[35:57] predestination
[35:59] and this this let's look a little bit at
[36:01] the horse here quickly just one or two
[36:03] verses
[36:05] uh has dog given the horse strength
[36:08] has dog clothed his neck with thunder
[36:12] so the neck of the horse is clothed with
[36:15] thunder
[36:16] and that word occluded
[36:18] clothed means dress where
[36:21] it means fully clothed
[36:23] and from the time we see dress where
[36:26] we realize
[36:28] brother that that is a terminology that
[36:30] the prophet used
[36:31] the prophet says that the fivefold is
[36:34] god's inner address where hallelujah
[36:37] the inner dress you're not the altar the
[36:39] inner one the one that is closer soul
[36:41] rather the five fold is god's inner
[36:43] dress wear
[36:46] so
[36:47] clothed
[36:49] the horse is clothed his neck is clothed
[36:52] so me just look at it here quickly
[36:55] has dough clothed his neck with thunder
[36:59] thunder is the main
[37:00] the main is the horse here the main is
[37:03] the tuck is the hair or the horse
[37:05] but his neck the horse here is on the
[37:08] back of the neck
[37:10] so
[37:11] the clothed
[37:13] represents the bride the dress wheel
[37:16] the the the five-fold that is the dress
[37:18] we are funny for the bride
[37:21] and the five-fold is what joins the head
[37:24] to the body
[37:26] so funny funny for they had anybody to
[37:28] be joined brother is truly the five-fold
[37:31] the prophet says this ministry of the
[37:33] son of man
[37:34] that unites the marriage of the bride
[37:37] the son of man joins the bride to the
[37:39] head hallelujah hallelujah
[37:41] but this the son of man
[37:43] brother is clothed in the mystery of the
[37:46] seven thunders
[37:47] that is that is where the son of man is
[37:49] clothed
[37:50] so on the back side of the book which is
[37:52] on the back part of the neck brother is
[37:55] where it is clothed and the fifo is
[37:58] clothed in thunder
[38:00] so let's continue by god's grace
[38:02] so verse 20 says
[38:04] can dao
[38:06] make him afraid as a grasshopper
[38:10] that horse is an anointed horse
[38:13] that horse is understanding the mystery
[38:15] of the seven thunders in his own life
[38:18] seeing himself seen christ in him the
[38:21] hope of glory
[38:22] and brother with christ in him he
[38:24] becomes a giant and all giants become
[38:27] grasshoppers
[38:29] so he's not afraid he's not afraid of
[38:32] any situation
[38:33] but he is the one that is an overcomer
[38:36] in all situations
[38:38] hands down make him afraid as a
[38:40] grasshopper the glory of his nurses his
[38:42] nostrils is terrible he pour it in the
[38:44] valley he keep pouring in the valley the
[38:48] horse as he ready to go out ready to go
[38:50] on into battle he scrapes with his foot
[38:52] in the valley pouring that is digging
[38:54] down
[38:55] and the prophet said we had to dig down
[38:57] deep to get his spiritual revelation
[39:00] so it's only when we get done in the
[39:01] spirit of revelation brother is there we
[39:04] could have the victory by the grace of
[39:05] god
[39:06] glory to god in the eyes
[39:09] so we look at that same point in the
[39:11] valley and in the valley brother the
[39:15] elijah elisha brother he told the kings
[39:19] that they have to dig ditches in that
[39:21] valley
[39:22] so a part of the victory is digging
[39:24] ditches in your valley brother to dig
[39:27] out all the trash and all the old tin
[39:30] cans and all the old uh social media
[39:33] links and all them things brother you
[39:35] gotta dig out all of that by god's grace
[39:37] to make room for brother for the
[39:39] inspiration to flow by god's grace
[39:42] you gotta dig that altar make room for
[39:44] the inspiration
[39:45] brother i said we gained a victory by
[39:47] the grace of god
[39:48] and he rejoices in his strength
[39:50] and he goes to media men so he's not
[39:52] afraid of the battle
[39:54] that horse brother is ready for the
[39:56] battle by god's grace
[39:58] it is us now who has to get in the
[40:00] spirit hallelujah
[40:02] so that we know we'll be ready to ride
[40:04] that horse by god's grace
[40:06] he said among the trumpets
[40:09] haha
[40:11] trumpets
[40:12] so he lived in a time
[40:14] of seven trumpets
[40:16] he lived in a time when
[40:18] the
[40:19] six seal is on the face of the earth he
[40:22] lived in a time when the jews have gone
[40:25] through their six trumpets and awaiting
[40:27] their seven trumpets
[40:29] and he lives on a in a time when the
[40:31] seventh trumpet is the same as the seven
[40:33] seal to us over here on the gentile side
[40:36] brother and you know is a is a war
[40:38] atmosphere that he's living in
[40:41] brother and he's not afraid of the
[40:43] troubles he said among the trumpets ha
[40:45] ha
[40:46] he smelled the battle of fire of the
[40:48] thunder of the captains and the shelter
[40:51] so there are other captains
[40:53] and there's others shouting
[40:56] and there are other men claiming
[40:58] brother to be the man of the hour
[41:01] brother but the only man of the hour is
[41:02] the lord jesus christ
[41:05] brother and under the lord jesus christ
[41:07] the only man of the hour is malachi 4
[41:10] and the bride under her messenger is a
[41:12] final voice to the final age
[41:16] so
[41:17] the other captains could be talking
[41:19] about thunders the other captains could
[41:21] be shouting and making noises and having
[41:23] messages
[41:24] but brother he
[41:26] says haha to that
[41:28] brother because he has not listened to
[41:30] they are shouting he is listening to
[41:32] these shouts which is the message of the
[41:35] hour by god's grace
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:38] 65 or 8 15.
[41:42] and when it did
[41:43] 262
[41:45] i seen this man that called himself a
[41:47] prophet you know and he come up on a
[41:50] horse that was mixed with white and
[41:52] black together
[41:53] and said he got up behind this great big
[41:55] horse
[41:56] and said it was way up above the clouds
[41:59] so you see the horse a horse don't ride
[42:01] in the clouds
[42:02] but brother eliza was caught up on a
[42:05] chariot of fire
[42:07] brother and elisha said lord open the
[42:09] boy's eyes and when his eyes were open
[42:11] he saw horses and chariots of fire all
[42:14] around the mountain so there are
[42:16] supernatural horses that ride in the
[42:18] clouds
[42:19] brother and what has come to take us is
[42:21] a supernatural horse by god's grace
[42:24] so we are heaven-bound creatures
[42:25] hallelujah living in bodies our time
[42:28] so
[42:29] way up above the clouds and the road
[42:32] wasn't over about that wide and that was
[42:34] just dance and to the wind blowing the
[42:36] feathers and everything on
[42:38] on your garb
[42:40] and then the horse and the mane
[42:42] and tail blowing great master big
[42:46] white horse
[42:47] walking right in line
[42:49] and said this guy that's the other
[42:51] captain run up behind you and come from
[42:54] towards canada
[42:55] and the man lives in canada and he said
[42:57] come back and said he took his little
[42:59] horse trying to knock your big horse off
[43:01] trying to turn him around make his hips
[43:04] hit against uh it never moved the big
[43:07] horse he just kept walking
[43:09] he says ha ha he laughed
[43:11] because whatever they try against you
[43:13] brother you are standing on christ the
[43:16] solid rock
[43:17] all at the ground is sinking zone
[43:20] whether we stay in plum direct center in
[43:23] the messenger of the hour
[43:24] and then all of a sudden
[43:26] said you turned around and said that
[43:28] would be the third time you spoke but
[43:30] the second time you said all right and
[43:32] you didn't speak like you did you
[43:33] commanded
[43:35] said you turned around and called that
[43:37] man by name
[43:38] so sometimes you have to confront the
[43:40] other captains oh my gosh and get said
[43:43] get off of here you know that no man can
[43:46] ride this road here without god being
[43:48] ordained him to do it

[52:48] but against principalities against
[52:50] powers against the rulers of the
[52:52] darkness of this world against spiritual
[52:54] wickedness in high places wherefore
[52:57] take unto you the whole armor of god
[52:59] that you may be able to withstand in the
[53:01] evil day and i haven't done all
[53:04] to stand
[53:05] and finally revelation 21
[53:08] and verse 2.
[53:10] and i john saw the holy city new
[53:14] jerusalem
[53:15] coming down from god
[53:17] out of heaven
[53:18] prepared as a bride adult for her
[53:22] husband
[53:23] may lord harry's blessings the reading
[53:25] of his holy words
[53:27] may please be seated
[53:29] and
[53:31] my title
[53:32] uh for this service here is
[53:35] the preparation
[53:37] and i got some connect scriptures here
[53:39] colossians 3 and verse 16 and hebrews 4
[53:43] 12.
[53:46] the preparation
[53:48] now we've got a great subject here
[53:49] brother theo's um
[53:51] inspiration for this
[53:53] convention here is um
[53:56] preparation for the battle
[53:59] and we know what battle are we talking
[54:00] about
[54:02] the battle is the coming of the lord
[54:04] and brother banham taught us that that's
[54:06] the great battle
[54:09] the rapture the coming of the lord and
[54:10] we know
[54:12] elijah was prepared by the word for his
[54:15] rapture enoch was prepared by his what
[54:18] by the word of god for his rapture
[54:20] and thank god god sent a prophet in this
[54:23] end time here with the word of the
[54:24] living god and he has prepared a bride
[54:27] for the rapture
[54:29] in the skies
[54:31] so the battle we are talking about is
[54:34] the coming of the lord but then
[54:36] we know life is also a battle
[54:38] life is a battle life is an ongoing
[54:41] constant battle day in day out day in
[54:45] day out
[54:47] and we have got to prepare for that
[54:48] battle also because if we don't fight
[54:51] the battle we can never hope to win the
[54:54] battle in the coming of the lord at the
[54:57] end of the road
[54:58] so
[55:00] this battle here
[55:02] the daily battles that we fight every
[55:05] single one of us as human beings as are
[55:08] in this battle we have no choice in the
[55:10] matter
[55:11] just being here at all human beings we
[55:14] are part of the battle
[55:16] because
[55:18] the original battle was the war in
[55:20] heaven
[55:21] and brother banham taught us that war
[55:24] became human battles when the devil was
[55:27] cast out of heaven and that war came
[55:29] upon every man every woman boy and girl
[55:32] on the face of the earth or who would
[55:34] ever come on the face of the earth
[55:36] when adam and eve fell by sin
[55:38] and so
[55:39] the battle of angels in heaven has
[55:42] become human battles and we are part of
[55:45] this battle so we have these daily
[55:48] battles that we have as human beings
[55:50] raging in the human mind and then we
[55:52] have the battle the great battle for the
[55:55] coming of the lord
[55:59] so we are all in this battle
[56:03] whether we are christians and all
[56:04] christians is a battle it has become
[56:07] the battle of human beings the war in
[56:10] heaven and the battle of human beings
[56:13] are connected together
[56:15] the battle that you and i face every day
[56:17] is the war in heaven in continuum
[56:20] so
[56:22] here we are talking about
[56:24] the preparation
[56:25] and so we have got to prepare for a
[56:28] daily everyday battles
[56:30] because really if you do not prepare and
[56:33] overcome in the daily everyday battles
[56:36] we are not going to be able to be there
[56:39] overcomers
[56:40] in that great battle when the law shall
[56:43] come to take his wedding bride and
[56:45] capture when the rapture in the skies
[56:48] so these two battles are connected
[56:49] together as a matter of fact they are
[56:51] one and the same battle they only deal
[56:53] with different aspects of our lives one
[56:56] dealing with life daily life daily grind
[56:58] of life and one dealing with the
[57:00] godliness aspect of it amen to go in the
[57:04] rapture in the in the skies when the
[57:06] lord comes to catch his by the way so
[57:09] this battle here is addressing
[57:12] two segments of our lives the life
[57:15] ungodliness elements and segments of our
[57:18] lives
[57:19] as peter ii peter one tells us let us
[57:23] understand and the bible demarcates our
[57:26] lives into those two segments life
[57:28] and godliness but it's all one and the
[57:31] same thing
[57:34] on the greatest battle ever thought
[57:35] brother banham said here paragraph 62
[57:38] and paragraph 63.
[57:40] um
[57:42] brother branham said
[57:44] um
[57:45] just a minute here
[57:56] all right
[58:00] this great first battle that was fought
[58:02] begin in heaven
[58:04] when michaels and his angels fought
[58:05] against lucifer
[58:07] and his angels
[58:09] it first chatted the first battle was in
[58:11] heaven so
[58:13] sin did not originate on earth
[58:16] it originated in heaven
[58:19] and then
[58:20] it was thrown down from heaven
[58:22] cast out of heaven to the earth
[58:25] and this battle fell on human beings and
[58:28] it fell on human beings then the battle
[58:30] from angels became
[58:32] human battles
[58:33] and satan come to destroy
[58:36] god's creation what god had created
[58:40] to be for himself he had satan come to
[58:43] destroy
[58:45] that's what his purpose was was to
[58:47] destroy it then the battle begin here on
[58:50] earth
[58:51] and begin in us and has been raging
[58:55] ever since
[58:57] amen
[58:58] so
[59:00] the war in heaven the original battle
[59:04] has become a battle that all of us are
[59:06] involved in
[59:07] and thank god he sent a prophet with a
[59:10] message to prepare us to know how to
[59:14] overcome in this battle so there are two
[59:17] battles here
[59:20] the battle of daily life
[59:23] and the battle
[59:25] the great battle
[59:27] the coming of the lord
[59:29] now
[59:30] at the fall when adam and i fell by sin
[59:34] and god came down
[59:36] adam adam where are thou and what
[59:38] happened and all of that
[59:41] then when they told him and then god
[59:43] began to give his verdict began to speak
[59:46] about the new order where before they
[59:48] were called equal he's changing the
[59:50] order now amen to where adam was head
[59:53] and if was going to be you know uh uh uh
[59:57] accountable to her husband and then god
[59:59] spoke to the serpent
[1:00:02] and that's where we saw how the battle
[1:00:04] from heaven
[1:00:06] became
[1:00:07] human
[1:00:08] battles
[1:00:10] genesis 3 15
[1:00:12] and i will put enmity that's a war
[1:00:15] that's a battle
[1:00:16] between thee and the woman
[1:00:18] in other words
[1:00:20] between you
[1:00:22] and the human race the woman
[1:00:24] representing the human race
[1:00:26] and between thy seed
[1:00:29] and
[1:00:30] her seed
[1:00:32] and the seed of the woman every bible
[1:00:34] reader knows that's jesus christ so here
[1:00:37] is god demarcating two battles here but
[1:00:40] all one and the same thing lucifer is
[1:00:43] behind all both of the battles one with
[1:00:47] the human race every day grind battling
[1:00:50] you day in and out to detail you and
[1:00:53] distract you from the purpose of god in
[1:00:56] your life and the other battle
[1:00:58] with the seed of the woman christ jesus
[1:01:01] the coming of the lord brother banham
[1:01:03] said
[1:01:04] so we see the battles here these battles
[1:01:07] here will go on the daily battle the
[1:01:10] human battles that we all go through
[1:01:13] will be here with us and we'll go on
[1:01:15] every single day
[1:01:17] until the coming of the lord when the
[1:01:20] lord will consume it all and there will
[1:01:23] be no more war
[1:01:26] so
[1:01:27] means these battles will be here with us
[1:01:30] until
[1:01:31] the coming of the seed of the woman
[1:01:33] jesus christ and you know he comes three
[1:01:35] times
[1:01:36] firstly he came to israel as a little
[1:01:39] baby in the manger
[1:01:40] secondly he comes
[1:01:43] for his bride
[1:01:44] for the rapture undergoing home
[1:01:47] and then nextly the third time he comes
[1:01:50] he comes with his bride for the
[1:01:52] millennium
[1:01:53] and the kingdom age
[1:01:55] so
[1:01:57] when this battle
[1:02:00] and because we're in the battle
[1:02:02] we're going to know how to prepare
[1:02:04] for the battle because jesus said no man
[1:02:08] goes to war without preparing for it
[1:02:11] no man goes to war without sitting down
[1:02:14] and knowing how to face the enemy
[1:02:17] and when he has
[1:02:19] he sits down you know do i have enough
[1:02:21] men to do it do i have enough ammunition
[1:02:23] do i have enough what it takes do i have
[1:02:25] the wherewithal to face this enemy
[1:02:29] you prepare for battle you prepare for
[1:02:32] war
[1:02:33] you prepare to take on the enemy and
[1:02:35] that's only
[1:02:39] human
[1:02:40] to do
[1:02:42] so
[1:02:45] the preparation in these battles here
[1:02:51] because the battle is one and the same
[1:02:54] just addressing different segments of
[1:02:56] our life
[1:02:57] the daily grind home school
[1:03:00] work play food shelter and all of that
[1:03:05] and then
[1:03:06] the the the things that
[1:03:09] that pertain
[1:03:10] essentially unto
[1:03:12] salvation the weightier matters of life
[1:03:15] that have to do driving you to the
[1:03:17] coming of the lord because they are one
[1:03:19] and the same thing just different
[1:03:21] aspects of the same battle
[1:03:23] the preparation for the battle
[1:03:26] for the two battles is one and the same
[1:03:28] thing
[1:03:31] the preparation
[1:03:33] is based upon
[1:03:35] a simple
[1:03:37] but profound
[1:03:38] bible principle what is the preparation
[1:03:41] how do we prepare for this battle we
[1:03:43] said malacca for came with the world
[1:03:46] to prepare a bride for the coming of
[1:03:48] lord we know that but let's go in the
[1:03:50] scriptures and and and see how this
[1:03:53] preparation actually takes place
[1:03:57] the preparation is based upon
[1:03:59] a simple premise
[1:04:01] a simple principle
[1:04:03] genesis 1 26 28 that was god preparing
[1:04:06] adam
[1:04:08] because brother banham said god never
[1:04:10] does anything
[1:04:12] without preparation
[1:04:15] he always prepares before he does
[1:04:18] anything and before god will bring adam
[1:04:21] or any man on the face of the other dog
[1:04:23] he prepared him to face the challenges
[1:04:27] and the battles they would face on the
[1:04:29] face of the earth here
[1:04:31] god never does anything incomplete
[1:04:34] and that's what god did he prepared the
[1:04:37] man that is sent on the face of the
[1:04:38] earth to face
[1:04:41] the battles he will find on the face of
[1:04:43] the earth here
[1:04:44] brother branham on the message
[1:04:47] preparation
[1:04:49] 11 11 53
[1:04:51] he said now
[1:04:52] preparation god
[1:04:55] before he does anything
[1:04:57] he always prepares for it
[1:05:00] and it spoke in the bible
[1:05:02] before we go over to fight a war
[1:05:05] first we have to prepare for that war
[1:05:08] if you're gonna get married why you
[1:05:11] prepared for that time
[1:05:13] and you have preparations and before you
[1:05:16] come to church you made preparations
[1:05:19] the ambulance to bring you or your loved
[1:05:20] one to bring you or you had to get a
[1:05:23] certain amount of money ready before you
[1:05:25] could come it's preparations
[1:05:28] and god always prepares the people for
[1:05:32] the events that's just about to happen
[1:05:35] so god prepared adam
[1:05:38] before he sent him to the world
[1:05:41] and that's why god
[1:05:43] every age every time he's always been
[1:05:45] there with his word to prepare his
[1:05:48] people
[1:05:49] for what's going to come on the scene
[1:05:54] on the message
[1:06:02] he said also here
[1:06:06] now he's preparing for the opening
[1:06:08] of those seven seals of redemption
[1:06:12] see that's what the fifth chapter is
[1:06:15] this is revelation chapter five
[1:06:17] that's the reason i kind of read it
[1:06:20] and then just take it from there and
[1:06:22] talk on it and give the other parts of
[1:06:24] the scripture
[1:06:26] it's because it isn't vast by verse
[1:06:29] but
[1:06:30] something that's happening it's
[1:06:32] preparing for something to happen
[1:06:34] and watch this provence profanity many
[1:06:36] made here
[1:06:38] and if you get the preparation
[1:06:40] then
[1:06:41] you are ready for it then
[1:06:44] so in other words
[1:06:45] if we get this preparation for battle
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:48] we are ready for the battle then
[1:06:51] ready as in we are going to overcome in
[1:06:54] the battle our success in the battle is
[1:06:56] a foregone conclusion if we get the
[1:06:59] preparation right
[1:07:01] and if you get the preparation right
[1:07:03] then you are just ready for it then
[1:07:06] and that's the way it is by faith
[1:07:09] or anything else whatever it is school
[1:07:12] work play
[1:07:14] whatever career get the preparation
[1:07:17] right and you are ready for it then
[1:07:19] that's why we go to school to get the
[1:07:21] preparation and foundation right so we
[1:07:23] can have a
[1:07:24] a a career and anything for that's how
[1:07:27] it is by faith or anything
[1:07:30] else
[1:07:31] get the preparation right first and then
[1:07:34] the main event is a walk over
[1:07:38] so this principle here of preparation
[1:07:41] how do we prepare
[1:07:45] very simple but very profound
[1:07:48] principle found in the bible
[1:07:52] god in preparing adam he made him a
[1:07:55] spirit man first
[1:07:57] and that was the preparation
[1:08:01] and then
[1:08:02] after that he put him in a body of flesh
[1:08:06] and the spirit man the soul of adam
[1:08:10] lived out through his body of flesh
[1:08:13] so the preparation was there first
[1:08:16] and then the preparation
[1:08:18] lived out through the flesh and that
[1:08:20] side is with with faith or anything else
[1:08:23] we prepare first on the inside and then
[1:08:27] the outside carries it out simple but
[1:08:30] very profound principle of scripture
[1:08:35] in other words
[1:08:36] the spirit on the inside
[1:08:40] the sword on the inside is what lives
[1:08:44] out on the outside
[1:08:46] in other words this flesh here is only
[1:08:49] carrying out what the inside inner man
[1:08:53] is determined to do on the outside
[1:08:57] in other words
[1:08:59] is the inner man that lives out it's
[1:09:02] never the other way around the inner man
[1:09:06] is the control tower the inner man is
[1:09:09] the power the inner man is the boss that
[1:09:12] controls what happens on the outside
[1:09:18] so
[1:09:19] whatever we want to achieve in our lives
[1:09:23] must take place on the inside first in
[1:09:27] the soul first in the inner man first in
[1:09:30] the spirit man
[1:09:32] first the inner man must be in agreement
[1:09:37] or will be fighting a losing battle will
[1:09:40] stand no fighting chance
[1:09:42] no fighting chance if the inner man is
[1:09:45] not in agreement with what we want to do
[1:09:47] on the outside
[1:09:49] in other words
[1:09:52] you want to live a christian life on the
[1:09:53] outside and the inner man is not changed
[1:09:56] in agreement with the christian life and
[1:09:59] christian principles of the life of
[1:10:01] christ you cannot do it
[1:10:03] whatever you do is that fill the rocks
[1:10:05] before god
[1:10:06] but when the spirit of god comes inside
[1:10:09] and changes the inner man then the
[1:10:12] change is affected and seen on the
[1:10:14] outside
[1:10:16] very simple but very profound
[1:10:19] principle
[1:10:21] preparation takes place within
[1:10:24] preparation takes place on the inside
[1:10:26] and that's how it is with faith or
[1:10:28] anything else get preparation right you
[1:10:31] have the event then
[1:10:33] you have the major event the main event
[1:10:37] as a walk over
[1:10:41] we want to prepare children for life
[1:10:42] that's why it says in the bible
[1:10:44] train up a child
[1:10:46] prepare the child by training him to
[1:10:48] face life train up a child in the way
[1:10:51] that he should go
[1:10:52] when he is old he will not depart from
[1:10:54] it
[1:10:55] if that training is done right and
[1:10:57] properly done right it's done to train
[1:11:00] that child's
[1:11:02] inner man on the inside of him so that
[1:11:05] child himself has an appreciation of the
[1:11:08] training why this and why that why he
[1:11:10] should and why should not do this or do
[1:11:13] that and when that child has been
[1:11:15] properly trained
[1:11:16] then he can face life and take the
[1:11:18] battles of life and stand a chance of
[1:11:21] succeeding in life at all
[1:11:25] so god
[1:11:27] who knows that
[1:11:30] man is going to face a lot of like
[1:11:34] bad tools in life
[1:11:36] because god
[1:11:37] is the author of life the author of all
[1:11:40] life he sees the beginning from the end
[1:11:43] this is the end from the beginning so
[1:11:45] god knowing what's putting adam here
[1:11:47] bringing adam here and he knows the
[1:11:50] challenges adam was going to face he
[1:11:52] knows the battles that i'm going to face
[1:11:54] he knows what's going to happen so he
[1:11:56] prepared him and the best way god could
[1:11:59] prepare adam with the best way he knew
[1:12:02] then the best way he knows now the best
[1:12:04] way to always be because god never does
[1:12:08] anything wrong his best his first
[1:12:10] decision is always the best decision
[1:12:13] so god
[1:12:14] he created man a spirit man made him a
[1:12:17] soul
[1:12:18] made man is
[1:12:20] soul a spirit man
[1:12:25] and spoke to that spirit man and gave
[1:12:27] all the capabilities of the spirit man
[1:12:29] and gave that man all that he needs that
[1:12:32] soul that spirit man all he needs to
[1:12:34] live a phenomenal life on the face of
[1:12:37] the earth here
[1:12:38] facing any challenge and triumphing over
[1:12:40] them in it
[1:12:42] facing every battle and triumphing over
[1:12:45] every battle of life that he was going
[1:12:48] to face
[1:12:50] why did god do this
[1:12:51] god's walking from a place of experience
[1:12:55] god is coming from a place of experience
[1:12:58] because god knows
[1:13:00] the spirit
[1:13:03] is what overcomes the spirit is what
[1:13:08] can
[1:13:09] can overcome in the battle
[1:13:12] because when the original was said in
[1:13:14] heaven
[1:13:16] lucifer and his angels
[1:13:18] what overcame
[1:13:22] the spirit body michael and his angels
[1:13:25] michael the holy spirit today is the
[1:13:28] mention of the angel
[1:13:31] michael the holy spirit up in heaven
[1:13:34] which stood lucifer and his angels
[1:13:37] lucifer fought michael for lucifer
[1:13:40] fought michael frost the spirit of god
[1:13:42] eventually pushed the devil out of
[1:13:45] heaven and their place was found normal
[1:13:47] and they came on the face of the earth
[1:13:51] so god coming from a place of knowledge
[1:13:54] a place of knowing that the spirit of
[1:13:57] god the spirit is what can overcome
[1:14:01] every battle
[1:14:03] and when he came on the face of the
[1:14:04] earth before he created man
[1:14:07] the earth went into like chaos
[1:14:10] and genesis one and verse two let us let
[1:14:13] us know the earth was without form and
[1:14:15] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:14:18] the earth genesis 1
[1:14:21] 1 and 2 let us know that
[1:14:24] and before god said let there be light
[1:14:27] the bible says
[1:14:29] in all that chaos in the midst of all
[1:14:31] that chaos on the face of the earth
[1:14:35] nothing like that since that time
[1:14:37] nothing like that ever since where there
[1:14:40] was a flood all over the earth
[1:14:44] not in one county not in one state not
[1:14:47] in one nation all over the earth you
[1:14:50] could not have a greater problem than
[1:14:51] that
[1:14:52] you cannot have a greater challenge on
[1:14:54] your hands than that you're gonna have a
[1:14:55] greater battle on your hands than that
[1:14:57] but what did god do
[1:14:58] the spirit of god
[1:15:00] moved upon the face of the deep
[1:15:04] the spirit came down to face the
[1:15:06] challenge
[1:15:07] and then god said let there be light on
[1:15:10] those and in seven days in seven days
[1:15:14] that major chaos that was on the face of
[1:15:16] the earth was torn over into a beautiful
[1:15:20] garden of eden because of the presence
[1:15:23] of a spirit of god so god knew there's
[1:15:26] nothing better than he's gonna do for
[1:15:27] this is creation than to put the spirit
[1:15:30] on this make them a spirit man
[1:15:33] so that they can confront all of life's
[1:15:35] challenges
[1:15:36] with the spirit and the spirit is the
[1:15:39] power
[1:15:40] amen that's going to push every
[1:15:42] challenge back i'm going to overcome
[1:15:45] every difficulty
[1:15:47] in this case with god it was the spirit
[1:15:49] of god that did the battle and won
[1:15:52] and so god knows
[1:15:54] let's make them in our image after our
[1:15:57] likeness
[1:15:58] let's make them a spirit man like we are
[1:16:01] spirit let's make them spirit
[1:16:03] and with the spirit they can face life
[1:16:06] with a spirit that can face every battle
[1:16:08] with the spirit they can overcome and
[1:16:09] let's prepare them by the spirit to face
[1:16:13] every battle
[1:16:16] and so
[1:16:17] to properly
[1:16:20] equip his children
[1:16:22] in his image
[1:16:23] god made them
[1:16:24] a spirit man first
[1:16:27] the spirit man was the preparation
[1:16:32] and he had the power
[1:16:34] to face and triumph in all the battles
[1:16:38] that he would face
[1:16:40] and that's how god
[1:16:41] meet adam and send him here
[1:16:45] and spoke to him be fruitful
[1:16:48] be not the flesh the flesh wasn't in the
[1:16:50] picture yet be fruitful be
[1:16:53] be multiplied
[1:16:55] be
[1:16:56] subdue b
[1:16:57] replenish be dominant
[1:17:00] just be it
[1:17:03] go ahead and live a life beyond limits
[1:17:06] go ahead and demonstrate the greatness
[1:17:08] and the awesomeness and the glories and
[1:17:10] the power of god subduing every every
[1:17:13] enemies of doing every trial overcoming
[1:17:16] every battle
[1:17:17] because the spirit
[1:17:19] of god is on the inside of you
[1:17:25] so
[1:17:27] adam came here
[1:17:30] with the spirit of god
[1:17:33] within him
[1:17:35] which was the image of god on the inside
[1:17:39] of them the word image in adam seven
[1:17:42] spirits because god is a spirit
[1:17:45] and god is
[1:17:47] his spirit is
[1:17:49] of a seven-fold nature and he put that
[1:17:53] into adam
[1:17:55] and from the image he looked just like
[1:17:59] god
[1:18:01] the spirit of god
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:05] in a measure was living in adam
[1:18:08] and with that adam lived
[1:18:11] a life on the face of the earth as an
[1:18:14] amateur god traversing the universe
[1:18:17] like the amateur god under god his
[1:18:20] father that he was living in greatness
[1:18:23] living in preeminences
[1:18:25] amen living a life beyond limits
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:30] the glories and the power of god shining
[1:18:34] through him if a tree was too tall adam
[1:18:37] would have to calm down if a tree was
[1:18:39] blocking his view adam would try to move
[1:18:40] to the side whatever challenge whatever
[1:18:42] difficulty adam
[1:18:44] overcame them because the spirit of god
[1:18:47] was on the inside of him
[1:18:49] and then god put him
[1:18:51] into flesh
[1:18:52] and the flesh only carried out when he
[1:18:54] put in the flesh man became a living
[1:18:57] soul
[1:18:57] this spirit on the inside is the soul of
[1:19:00] man this what image was a soul of adam
[1:19:04] and
[1:19:05] the flesh only was there for the what
[1:19:08] image the spirit on the inside the soul
[1:19:12] on the inside to express itself through
[1:19:15] and the bible says man became
[1:19:18] a living soul the soul on the inside
[1:19:21] lived out through the flesh of man
[1:19:24] is the soul that leaves friends
[1:19:26] is the preparation on the inside when
[1:19:28] you get it right
[1:19:30] the main event is a breeze and god got
[1:19:32] it right unprepared adam by the spirit
[1:19:36] on the inside of him
[1:19:39] and every battle
[1:19:42] was a
[1:19:44] success in every battle was a
[1:19:46] conclusion for him
[1:19:48] adam lived a life of preeminence a life
[1:19:51] of greatness
[1:19:52] until the fall
[1:19:54] another for notice adam wasn't deceived
[1:19:57] but as a type of christ he went over and
[1:20:01] followed his wife eve
[1:20:04] so when adam told god the woman who you
[1:20:06] gave me he wasn't telling exactly the
[1:20:08] truth
[1:20:09] because the woman had nothing to do with
[1:20:11] it adam the bible tells us that adam was
[1:20:14] not deceived
[1:20:15] he of his own volition chose to go after
[1:20:18] his wife
[1:20:20] and brother let us know that was the
[1:20:22] type of christ too
[1:20:25] so at the fall adam lost it all
[1:20:29] he lost it all
[1:20:31] he lost the glory he lost the power his
[1:20:34] soul became polluted the glories and
[1:20:37] power and the majesty and the eminence
[1:20:39] and the preeminences that emanated from
[1:20:41] his soul
[1:20:42] he lost it all
[1:20:44] it fell from that great glory and when
[1:20:47] you fall you go right back to the ground
[1:20:49] again
[1:20:50] and adam felt like a little seed back
[1:20:52] into the ground again and this glory
[1:20:55] this what image
[1:20:57] became like a little seed a little
[1:20:59] button on the inside of adam
[1:21:03] god detect determining that for man adam
[1:21:07] or any man to get back to that glory and
[1:21:10] the magnificence and the greatness of
[1:21:13] eden before the fall they would have to
[1:21:16] grow into it
[1:21:18] they will have to grow into it
[1:21:21] and that's been the gospel story of
[1:21:23] redemption
[1:21:24] because right then then
[1:21:26] god restored back adam lost three things
[1:21:28] his eternal life his fellowship with god
[1:21:30] and his inheritance in life
[1:21:32] but right there and then god restored
[1:21:35] his eternal life glory stood his
[1:21:36] fellowship back but that inheritance in
[1:21:39] life that glory and majesty and power
[1:21:42] and from preeminence and greatness was
[1:21:45] not restored that was left as a journey
[1:21:49] man has to grow into it adam and eve
[1:21:52] very cheap they got character thrust
[1:21:55] upon them
[1:21:58] but character is not a gift they had it
[1:22:00] gifted to them
[1:22:02] from then on god said if they're going
[1:22:03] to get character they're going to have
[1:22:04] to label and fight for it character is a
[1:22:08] victory and that's why we're in
[1:22:10] preparation to get the character of
[1:22:13] jesus christ from in us to take us right
[1:22:16] back to the spot that adam and eve were
[1:22:18] in before they fell
[1:22:22] by sin in the garden of eden
[1:22:25] so
[1:22:26] the gospel story of redemption
[1:22:28] has been to take a joint has been a
[1:22:31] journey to take a journey back
[1:22:33] to this glory and power
[1:22:36] uh uh uh uh that that adams was veiled
[1:22:39] in the what image
[1:22:41] that lived in adam
[1:22:42] before the fall
[1:22:46] adam and sit after him will have to grow
[1:22:48] back
[1:22:49] into this glory now in all areas of life
[1:22:54] both in life and godliness they'll have
[1:22:56] to be prepared to grow into this air
[1:23:01] and in growing into it they'll have to
[1:23:03] face the bad tool every single day
[1:23:05] between thy seat between between you and
[1:23:08] the woman and between thy seed and her
[1:23:10] seed they have to face that every day
[1:23:13] and if you notice
[1:23:14] god changed the order and brought in
[1:23:16] elements of life and godliness and
[1:23:19] things there
[1:23:21] he probably changed the order where they
[1:23:23] were equal they were no longer equal
[1:23:26] adam was the head representing christ
[1:23:28] and the bride
[1:23:30] and then
[1:23:33] adam had to work he introduced
[1:23:36] into his work he had work in the garden
[1:23:38] of eden but now he had to walk and from
[1:23:40] the sweat of his brow
[1:23:42] from the sweat of his face from the
[1:23:44] heart walk the sweat of his brow the
[1:23:47] thinking the labor he had to walk to
[1:23:51] able to eat now
[1:23:53] not
[1:23:54] not punishment no god was changing the
[1:23:57] order that through these challenges here
[1:24:00] through this daily battles here adam and
[1:24:03] eve and their generations and their
[1:24:06] offspring after them will be
[1:24:09] would
[1:24:10] would fight their way back
[1:24:12] into the glories of eden so that no more
[1:24:16] will character be gifted to any man
[1:24:18] but they will have to label and fight
[1:24:20] and get character as a victory
[1:24:25] so they they they
[1:24:27] the the new order
[1:24:30] uh um
[1:24:32] spelled out for them
[1:24:34] uh
[1:24:35] um
[1:24:36] work
[1:24:37] and sweat and labor and parenthood and
[1:24:41] marriage and husband and wife and
[1:24:43] headship in the home and headship a
[1:24:46] generalian and motherhood and bringing
[1:24:49] up children all of the new order
[1:24:53] was what adam and eve had to face now
[1:24:55] and they had to battle and overcome
[1:24:58] those battles and keep those battles on
[1:25:02] and those battles have been answering
[1:25:03] them and they are still here with us
[1:25:05] labor work school play
[1:25:10] food shelter parents children upbringing
[1:25:14] leadership they are still here with us
[1:25:16] and will be here with us until the seed
[1:25:19] of the woman comes he was there with
[1:25:21] them in the autism many years until the
[1:25:22] pseudo-woman came and is still here with
[1:25:24] us today because the seat of the woman
[1:25:27] comes three times
[1:25:28] first to israel as a little baby in the
[1:25:30] manger then he we are waiting on his
[1:25:33] second coming now
[1:25:34] to come to this bride
[1:25:37] to take her away to take her away in the
[1:25:39] rupture in the skies
[1:25:42] and then he will come back again with
[1:25:44] his bride
[1:25:46] in the millennium
[1:25:47] for
[1:25:48] a thousand years
[1:25:52] so god identify for them
[1:25:56] the areas where they're going to do
[1:25:58] battle
[1:26:00] every single day
[1:26:02] career work
[1:26:04] sweat
[1:26:05] labor
[1:26:06] husband wife um
[1:26:09] mother
[1:26:10] parent
[1:26:11] father son
[1:26:13] daughter
[1:26:14] leadership all of that were battles they
[1:26:17] were going to live from here on out
[1:26:20] and those battles were designed by god
[1:26:23] so that adam and eve will add to
[1:26:26] themselves and grow in grace
[1:26:29] and add back on the character that they
[1:26:32] lost in eden at the fall this this this
[1:26:36] life was so designed by god to let these
[1:26:39] challenges come not to kill them not to
[1:26:42] destroy them and neither is to destroy
[1:26:44] us
[1:26:45] but so that through these battles the
[1:26:48] glory and the greatness of god will be
[1:26:51] built back in adam and eve and their
[1:26:54] offspring after them and every seed of
[1:26:56] god will grow back into the glory uh and
[1:27:00] majesty of eden that adam and eve had
[1:27:02] before the fall
[1:27:06] so this gospel story the story of
[1:27:08] redemption since the fall has been
[1:27:11] a battle of life a battle of godliness
[1:27:14] and we have got to be prepared
[1:27:17] we have got to be prepared to face these
[1:27:19] battles and god from the day one from
[1:27:22] very beginning send them messenger after
[1:27:25] messenger prophet after prophet and god
[1:27:28] himself was was originally the the king
[1:27:31] over them but he was rejected god got
[1:27:34] israel out of egypt you want to make a
[1:27:36] special nation off of them
[1:27:40] and he was the the king over them they
[1:27:43] lived not in a democracy they live in a
[1:27:45] theocracy where god control their life
[1:27:48] control everything about them it was a
[1:27:51] kingdom that lived under
[1:27:54] life and godliness
[1:27:57] it was a system of government where god
[1:27:59] was the ruler they had
[1:28:02] and control every aspect of their lives
[1:28:04] for their own good for their own benefit
[1:28:06] so they can grow back in grace and go
[1:28:08] back to the glory and the power of eden
[1:28:15] the road back to eden
[1:28:17] and the glory that adam lost
[1:28:20] in eden
[1:28:22] was veiled in the 3-4 mystery of god
[1:28:28] god started to play that right out
[1:28:30] right at the fall what is the threefold
[1:28:32] mr you and i know it
[1:28:34] god in christ
[1:28:36] in preeminences
[1:28:38] the preeminence that adam displayed that
[1:28:40] we saw the glory the power the majesty
[1:28:43] the life beyond limits the life where
[1:28:46] everything is possible in the natural in
[1:28:48] the spiritual where adam was absolutely
[1:28:51] an amateur god on the face of this idea
[1:28:54] that that life of preeminences
[1:28:58] why because the preeminent god had
[1:29:01] preeminences and control over adam
[1:29:04] adam's life was a testimony and a
[1:29:06] testament to the preeminence of god in
[1:29:09] the life of a man
[1:29:13] but when he lost that
[1:29:15] god began to walk towards
[1:29:17] this threefold mystery which was going
[1:29:20] to be unveiled at the coming of the seed
[1:29:22] of the woman
[1:29:24] to where the preeminences of god the
[1:29:27] greatness of god will be brought back
[1:29:30] into the life of human beings again
[1:29:33] through the seed of the woman
[1:29:36] so
[1:29:37] the first one of the three four mystery
[1:29:39] god and christ in preeminences how did
[1:29:42] the preeminences of god get into adam by
[1:29:45] the spirit of god
[1:29:47] the spirit of god
[1:29:50] brought the preeminence into adam
[1:29:53] and god spoke to that
[1:29:54] spoke his words into that soul
[1:29:58] be fruitful
[1:30:00] multiply
[1:30:02] replenish subdue
[1:30:04] the earth and dominate the earth
[1:30:09] and god
[1:30:12] he did that
[1:30:14] on adam
[1:30:18] when he fell when he lost all that
[1:30:22] the second adam
[1:30:24] jesus christ
[1:30:26] here he was
[1:30:28] to demonstrate again
[1:30:31] that preeminence the glory and the grace
[1:30:34] of god the power and the greatness of
[1:30:37] god in the lives of his children in the
[1:30:40] lives of his heritage
[1:30:43] god demonstrating that through jesus
[1:30:45] christ
[1:30:46] to be fruitful to multiply to replenish
[1:30:50] to subdue to live in domination
[1:30:54] never remain like jesus christ
[1:30:57] never a man on this face of the earth
[1:30:59] like him this was the second adam he
[1:31:02] showed us and demonstrated to us what
[1:31:04] life was under the first adam he showed
[1:31:07] us the glory and the power and the
[1:31:09] majesty
[1:31:11] of the word of god
[1:31:13] having a man a woman a boy and girl in
[1:31:16] absolute total control under god so that
[1:31:19] the preeminent god is their king and
[1:31:22] ruler right in their souls right on the
[1:31:25] inside of them
[1:31:28] and when they are in that state
[1:31:31] then they also will be in preeminences
[1:31:34] their life will
[1:31:36] exceed their life will show forth their
[1:31:38] lives will shine forth the greatness and
[1:31:41] the greatness and the glory and the
[1:31:44] preeminence
[1:31:45] of the god that they serve
[1:31:47] both in life and godliness
[1:31:51] and we saw jesus christ
[1:31:53] because growth was
[1:31:55] they had to grow back into it
[1:31:57] adam and eve didn't grow into it but
[1:31:59] every seed of adam had to go into and
[1:32:01] jesus christ even though he was god
[1:32:03] himself when he came here and lived in
[1:32:05] galilee he gave all men a chance what
[1:32:08] god intends for them to be and how they
[1:32:11] utterly so jesus the bible said he grew
[1:32:14] in faith he grew in grace
[1:32:17] he grew
[1:32:19] growth
[1:32:21] first fault of the threefold mystery
[1:32:23] jesus christ growing in grace
[1:32:26] and in favor and in stature
[1:32:29] with both god
[1:32:31] and man
[1:32:32] god and man life and godliness jesus
[1:32:34] grew
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:36] in favor
[1:32:37] with both god and man growing in grace
[1:32:42] growing in stature
[1:32:44] growing in stature
[1:32:46] with both god
[1:32:48] and man
[1:32:50] said luke 2 i believe
[1:32:52] let us know that that jesus grew in
[1:32:55] favor and in stature
[1:32:57] and in grace with both god
[1:33:00] and man
[1:33:03] and that's what we saw when he came
[1:33:06] the glories of his power
[1:33:08] we saw the second adam
[1:33:11] and like romans 5 17 said
[1:33:14] by one man's sin
[1:33:16] we all fell and we lost it all but
[1:33:19] one man's obedience
[1:33:22] we are going to reign in life
[1:33:25] by one man that man jesus christ and
[1:33:28] that's what jesus christ came to do
[1:33:30] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:35] and when jesus came here
[1:33:38] he spoke his words
[1:33:40] he spoke his words and the word of god
[1:33:43] that he spoke was the same spirit that
[1:33:46] was poured into adam
[1:33:50] in the preparation
[1:33:53] but you know
[1:33:54] the word is the spirit and the spirit is
[1:33:57] the word
[1:33:59] god is a spirit
[1:34:03] and there that worship him must worship
[1:34:05] him in spirit
[1:34:06] and in truth
[1:34:10] but we are natural canal human beings
[1:34:14] fleshly human beings our human nature
[1:34:16] that's what it is only god's spirit
[1:34:19] changes anything about us there's no
[1:34:21] good thing in this flesh
[1:34:23] cannon
[1:34:24] natural
[1:34:26] and we cannot understand spiritual
[1:34:28] things
[1:34:29] we can understand the things of the
[1:34:31] spirit so god
[1:34:34] he can pour spreading to us like that
[1:34:36] so he broke it down and the spirit of
[1:34:39] god he
[1:34:41] it condescended into
[1:34:43] the world just like it in the beginning
[1:34:45] elohim the eternals be condescending to
[1:34:47] the a word body
[1:34:51] and so the same way the spirit of god
[1:34:54] become disguised as the world
[1:34:56] and when jesus came he was speaking the
[1:34:59] spirit of god but disguised as the world
[1:35:02] and he spoke the world he spoke the
[1:35:05] world and they who received the word of
[1:35:06] god they were receiving the spirit of
[1:35:08] god into their souls building them up
[1:35:11] like
[1:35:13] god built adam up
[1:35:15] he said the words that are speaking to
[1:35:16] you their spirit
[1:35:18] and their life
[1:35:21] and those disciples received his word
[1:35:24] they received the word because
[1:35:26] he said i've got to go away i came from
[1:35:30] the world i came from the father i came
[1:35:32] from the spirit and became the world
[1:35:35] i've got to go back
[1:35:37] to my father in other words i came from
[1:35:39] spirit i became the world i'm going back
[1:35:42] to the spirit
[1:35:43] because if i don't go away the spirit
[1:35:46] cannot come but when i go away i will
[1:35:48] come back to you again
[1:35:50] and he came back to the money of
[1:35:52] pentecost
[1:35:53] and the word that he spoke to them
[1:35:54] turned into spirit again
[1:35:57] and exploded and wrote a book of acts
[1:36:00] behind them and they took notice they
[1:36:02] have been with jesus christ they saw a
[1:36:05] people that was back
[1:36:06] like adam was in eden before the fall
[1:36:10] oh glory hallelujah
[1:36:13] glory to god amen
[1:36:17] down through the seven church edges and
[1:36:19] went
[1:36:21] and then
[1:36:22] nice air council
[1:36:25] she fell again but i will restore sea of
[1:36:28] the lord
[1:36:29] i will restore right back
[1:36:32] and god in this end time here has sent
[1:36:34] us a prophet
[1:36:36] the prophet elijah
[1:36:38] with the word of the living god
[1:36:42] all
[1:36:43] the seven spirits of god has come back
[1:36:46] to us in the form of a word message
[1:36:48] and you know
[1:36:50] for those who received that word that
[1:36:52] message all the lost in the church edges
[1:36:55] he brought it right back in the form of
[1:36:57] a word message seven spirits of god
[1:37:00] condescending into a word message
[1:37:03] and that what message has been preached
[1:37:05] to us and we have received it
[1:37:08] and that what is in the soul
[1:37:10] building us of forming the word image
[1:37:12] waiting for the time the spirit to fall
[1:37:15] again like only your pentecostal where
[1:37:16] the word will turn right back to the
[1:37:19] spirit again and this bride here of the
[1:37:21] end time will write another book of acts
[1:37:24] behind her so malacca for came with this
[1:37:27] word which is the spirit to prepare a
[1:37:31] bride for the battle
[1:37:33] the great battle of the coming of the
[1:37:35] lord
[1:37:36] and
[1:37:37] word on top of a word on top of a word
[1:37:40] unto the word you've been prepared he's
[1:37:42] been preparing you by the messenger
[1:37:44] malachi 4
[1:37:46] amen prepare you in the inner man
[1:37:49] to face your daily battles preparing you
[1:37:51] linda man to overcome your daily battles
[1:37:54] preparing the inner man and you are
[1:37:56] growing in grace
[1:37:58] groaning grace preparing for the daily
[1:38:01] battles growing in grace
[1:38:03] the holy spirit of god adding the image
[1:38:06] of jesus christ you word on top of a
[1:38:08] word on top of a word on top of a word
[1:38:10] which is spirit on top of spirit on top
[1:38:12] of spirit in you forming the spirit of
[1:38:15] god on the inside of you
[1:38:18] oh hallelujah growing you into the word
[1:38:21] image
[1:38:22] in the inner man like adam genesis 123
[1:38:26] in the inner man
[1:38:28] by the mechanics the learning of his
[1:38:31] word this the seed of the woman is
[1:38:34] coming to you
[1:38:35] came down in this edge here
[1:38:37] amen in the form of a prophet with a
[1:38:39] message
[1:38:40] and the seed of the woman is coming to
[1:38:42] you in the form of a one message
[1:38:44] coming to you
[1:38:46] amen
[1:38:49] so that you'll be a part of those people
[1:38:51] the group
[1:38:52] that will overcome in the battle when
[1:38:54] the seed of the woman when he takes his
[1:38:56] bride out of this world into the rapture
[1:38:59] in the skies
[1:39:01] and he normally comes in by the learning
[1:39:03] of his word he manifests that word by
[1:39:06] the spirit because the world has got to
[1:39:08] turn back the spirit because i come from
[1:39:10] my father's spirit and here i am the
[1:39:13] world but i go back to my father again
[1:39:15] and when i go back to my father i will
[1:39:16] come back to you as spirit
[1:39:19] the world the spirit becomes the word
[1:39:22] becomes a spirit and that's the
[1:39:24] manifestation that's the power and the
[1:39:27] glory that's the mighty
[1:39:28] power god displayed through his people
[1:39:32] on the face of the earth what is it
[1:39:33] friends
[1:39:35] is the seed of the woman
[1:39:37] coming to you in the learning of his
[1:39:39] world boy not only
[1:39:42] comes in by land on his word he
[1:39:44] manifests that word
[1:39:46] oh my just quickly one
[1:39:48] one quick quote here
[1:39:50] from god's provided place of worship
[1:39:52] 650425
[1:39:56] brother branham said that the notice
[1:39:59] not only does he come in by the holy
[1:40:01] spirit
[1:40:03] with the learning of his word
[1:40:05] so you see
[1:40:06] when that what is coming is a spirit
[1:40:08] that is coming in
[1:40:12] but we don't know how to receive the
[1:40:13] spirit so the word has to come there
[1:40:16] first to bring it to where we can
[1:40:17] understand it and be prepared
[1:40:21] ready to receive the spirit
[1:40:24] so that we can take our preparation
[1:40:26] into this battle
[1:40:28] not only does he come in
[1:40:30] by the holy spirit
[1:40:33] with the learning of his word
[1:40:35] he manifests that word
[1:40:38] and what he's saying there
[1:40:40] the word comes in
[1:40:42] and the spirit anoints it and it turns
[1:40:44] into spirit again because the god is
[1:40:47] spirit
[1:40:48] the word will really spirit but god
[1:40:51] brought it down to where you and i can
[1:40:53] understand where human beings can
[1:40:54] understand god
[1:40:56] because we operate in the realm of words
[1:40:58] abcd
[1:41:00] and so god condescended his spirit down
[1:41:02] into the form of a word the word message
[1:41:06] and every word of god is spirit waiting
[1:41:09] for the time the season to turn right
[1:41:12] back into the spirit again and when it
[1:41:13] turns back in the spirit that's the
[1:41:14] manifestation
[1:41:16] oh glory to god
[1:41:18] hallelujah
[1:41:21] so the word coming to you
[1:41:23] malakai first words
[1:41:26] been preached back by far foreign
[1:41:28] ministry to you and i
[1:41:29] what is it
[1:41:31] is the seed of the woman jesus christ
[1:41:33] coming to you
[1:41:35] with the virtue seeds of his life
[1:41:39] it's his holy spirit his seven spirits
[1:41:42] coming in
[1:41:44] by the learning of his world coming in
[1:41:47] with the learning of his world
[1:41:49] is the seat of the woman coming to you
[1:41:52] in the form
[1:41:53] of the word a message from the back of
[1:41:56] the bible from that great elijah prophet
[1:42:00] but like i read him only comes in by the
[1:42:03] holy spirit with the line of his word he
[1:42:05] manifests that word
[1:42:08] and when he manifests that word
[1:42:12] is going to be the holy spirit coming
[1:42:14] down on top of the word that you have
[1:42:16] received in your soul
[1:42:18] and that word will be the spirit of god
[1:42:21] the seven full spirit of god like adam
[1:42:24] had in his preparation to face everybody
[1:42:27] here the battle at this end time here is
[1:42:30] the preparation
[1:42:32] to finish the battle of the coming of
[1:42:34] lord so we can go in the rapture in the
[1:42:36] skies
[1:42:37] and right now
[1:42:39] your everyday daily battles the
[1:42:41] preparation is going on the learning of
[1:42:44] this world the spirit of god on the
[1:42:46] inside of you
[1:42:47] facing every battle overcoming shaping
[1:42:49] you forming character in you amen
[1:42:52] overcoming the devil at every one of
[1:42:54] these tricks overcoming by the world
[1:42:56] overcoming by the spirit in the world
[1:42:59] the word of god
[1:43:01] amen
[1:43:03] hallelujah
[1:43:06] and so
[1:43:07] here we
[1:43:08] are waiting
[1:43:11] for the season and the time
[1:43:14] when god can see
[1:43:16] that's what's been going on
[1:43:18] our prophet has come and brought the
[1:43:20] seven spirits of god
[1:43:23] right back to us he has opened the seven
[1:43:25] seals
[1:43:28] and since the open of the seven seas
[1:43:29] god's been waiting for sons and
[1:43:31] daughters to go back to eden again he's
[1:43:34] opened the seven seas and gone all the
[1:43:35] way back to the man of god and gather
[1:43:38] back together for you and i
[1:43:40] all seven spirits of god in the form of
[1:43:43] a word message
[1:43:44] and a firefighter mystery after the
[1:43:46] prophet is cycling back from books and
[1:43:48] tips and recycling back
[1:43:51] every single promise that the prophet
[1:43:54] gave this pride here
[1:43:56] knowing that every word is the spirit of
[1:43:59] god in what form
[1:44:02] and when we receive that word we are
[1:44:04] only receiving the spirit where is it
[1:44:06] that word when it comes into when it go
[1:44:08] into the soul into the inner man on the
[1:44:10] inside of us
[1:44:12] what's going on is that that word is
[1:44:15] turning in there into spirit and that
[1:44:17] what is forming us into the spirit of
[1:44:19] god into the what image of jesus christ
[1:44:22] into an image exactly like god himself
[1:44:28] and then
[1:44:30] when god can see
[1:44:33] and look down and see his reflection and
[1:44:35] sees
[1:44:36] see his character see his behavior he
[1:44:39] sees us he sees us growing in grace
[1:44:42] god knows the time the hour and the
[1:44:44] season
[1:44:47] he sees us prepared
[1:44:49] not just facing the daily battles of
[1:44:51] life but prepared to face the world
[1:44:54] council of churches
[1:44:56] what does he do
[1:44:57] he sends down his dynamics
[1:45:00] he sends down the power of the holy
[1:45:01] ghost upon us
[1:45:03] to anoint the word in us
[1:45:08] and that what will turn into spirit on
[1:45:10] the inside of us
[1:45:13] instead of this right here
[1:45:15] and what would it be
[1:45:17] it would be the preparation again
[1:45:18] prepared by the what image in her
[1:45:21] right on the inside about the image of
[1:45:24] jesus christ on the inside of the bride
[1:45:27] like in genesis 1 26 to 28
[1:45:31] but there's one more thing left
[1:45:36] that image
[1:45:37] like jesus 1 26 28 has to be put in
[1:45:40] flesh
[1:45:42] to work on the face of this earth here
[1:45:45] to demonstrate and be displayed so that
[1:45:48] all can see
[1:45:49] on the inside until god can see but on
[1:45:52] the outside man needs to see it that
[1:45:55] they'll take notice one more time that
[1:45:57] you have been with jesus christ
[1:46:01] so one more thing
[1:46:03] after the spirit anoints the word in
[1:46:05] your soul
[1:46:06] and forms you into seven living voices
[1:46:10] on the inside of you
[1:46:14] when god can see that
[1:46:17] then he'll send the spirit of god right
[1:46:19] back upon
[1:46:20] amen the word imagine you and anoint
[1:46:24] that word image into your flesh it will
[1:46:26] be like god taking the word image
[1:46:28] genesis 1 228 i'm putting it into flesh
[1:46:31] and everybody can see it and the devil
[1:46:33] can see the devil knows that the seed of
[1:46:35] the woman has come right back again and
[1:46:38] is in all of these people oh glory to
[1:46:41] god
[1:46:42] and then the seed of the woman will be
[1:46:45] living in your flesh
[1:46:46] the seed of the woman
[1:46:48] by his spirit will be shining through
[1:46:52] your clothes
[1:46:53] all around you
[1:46:55] the seed of the woman
[1:46:58] will be back
[1:46:59] and the spirit of god will be united in
[1:47:02] your flesh
[1:47:04] you and god's spirit will be united in
[1:47:07] your flesh
[1:47:08] and the people are going to take notice
[1:47:11] that you have been with jesus christ and
[1:47:12] that's the preparation to face the world
[1:47:15] council of churches
[1:47:17] oh glory to god amen
[1:47:20] the seed of the woman has come to you in
[1:47:23] adoption time
[1:47:24] to adopt you
[1:47:27] getting you ready for the battle
[1:47:30] and ready for the battle you're ready to
[1:47:33] freeze the world council of churches
[1:47:34] ready for the battle you had to go in
[1:47:36] the rapture in the skies
[1:47:39] and when the last name is adopted when
[1:47:42] the last name on the book is adopted
[1:47:45] when the last name has come to this
[1:47:47] preparation
[1:47:48] to go in the rapture in this case and
[1:47:50] defy gravity defy every battle the enemy
[1:47:53] can throw now a world cup touches every
[1:47:55] one of them once the last one has come
[1:47:58] to that spot
[1:48:01] to that
[1:48:02] preparation what will happen
[1:48:07] up will come
[1:48:09] the sleeping sins
[1:48:10] up they'll come and we'll go in the
[1:48:13] rapture together with them and the lord
[1:48:15] to be with lord in the air
[1:48:17] amen
[1:48:19] but before then
[1:48:21] once the last name is adopted
[1:48:23] there will be a 30 40 day rendezvous on
[1:48:26] the
[1:48:28] on this earth here
[1:48:29] to where the power of god will be
[1:48:32] displayed again like it was in the
[1:48:34] garden of eden
[1:48:36] before the fall the glory the majesty
[1:48:39] the
[1:48:40] the the greatness of eden of the glory
[1:48:43] of god the spirit of god united in the
[1:48:46] flesh of man
[1:48:47] will be displayed again
[1:48:50] before we go in the rapture in the skies
[1:48:53] both living and resurrected sins of all
[1:48:56] seven churches all the way back to adam
[1:48:58] will walk up and down this earth here it
[1:49:01] will be a
[1:49:02] spiritually restored event
[1:49:05] back on the face of the earth but we are
[1:49:07] going back to the physical event which
[1:49:08] is on the other side of the rapture and
[1:49:10] so we go in the rapture
[1:49:14] and come back after three and a half
[1:49:15] years to come back on the face of this
[1:49:18] earth here for a physical garden of eden
[1:49:21] and at that time
[1:49:23] lucifer and his angels will try to stop
[1:49:26] and stand against they never learn try
[1:49:28] to stand against the seed of the woman
[1:49:31] and it's bright
[1:49:33] in that great battle of american
[1:49:36] that will be the final edition
[1:49:38] of this great battle
[1:49:40] that you have been in preparation for
[1:49:42] amen this great battle that stay in
[1:49:44] heaven
[1:49:46] that will be the consummation of it
[1:49:48] when lucifer comes and other part of a
[1:49:51] man he'll be destroyed totally
[1:49:54] and the
[1:49:55] the seed of the woman
[1:49:57] jesus christ your lord will set up his
[1:49:58] kingdom
[1:49:59] husband and wife together for a thousand
[1:50:02] years of millennial reign on the face of
[1:50:05] the and the devil will be bound by
[1:50:07] eternal circumstances for those thousand
[1:50:09] years
[1:50:11] oh hallelujah at that time the great
[1:50:14] battle from heaven
[1:50:16] would have gone full cycle
[1:50:19] full cycle so here we are friends
[1:50:22] we are here looking for the dynamics of
[1:50:25] that promised world
[1:50:28] which is the spirit of the promised
[1:50:30] world
[1:50:31] we have received the world on top of a
[1:50:33] world on top of one to our souls
[1:50:35] forming the word imagine us in what form
[1:50:38] but it's going to be spirit
[1:50:41] jesus said if i don't go away
[1:50:42] the spirit cannot come but when this
[1:50:44] becomes i am coming back to you
[1:50:47] so the word of god we are receiving to
[1:50:49] our souls has got to turn back into
[1:50:51] spirit again
[1:50:53] and the dynamics of his promised world
[1:50:56] has promised us
[1:50:57] to do that to turn the world that we
[1:51:01] have received into spirit to from the
[1:51:05] one image in in this bride
[1:51:08] a living faith a living virtue a living
[1:51:11] knowledge a living temperance a living
[1:51:12] patience a living godliness i'm probably
[1:51:15] kind of leaving seven spirits of god
[1:51:17] living through this right here
[1:51:21] leave voices thundering out through the
[1:51:24] through whatever city they are on on the
[1:51:26] face of this world here
[1:51:28] and when god can see that
[1:51:31] he anoints their word into their flesh
[1:51:34] and that's gonna be
[1:51:36] the bread of jesus christ that has come
[1:51:39] to the grand finale
[1:51:41] and has totally triumphed over lucifer
[1:51:45] in the great battle of
[1:51:46] life what an hour to live for
[1:51:50] what a promise to live for
[1:51:52] god
[1:51:53] richly
[1:51:54] bless you make sure you be there
[1:51:57] make sure you be there take your word
[1:51:59] take it into your soul hide into the
[1:52:00] suckers of your soul the word of god is
[1:52:02] sharper than any soul it pierces to the
[1:52:05] divine asunder let it go deep down in
[1:52:08] your soul and take everything on like
[1:52:11] jesus christ out of there that you might
[1:52:13] be formed into the what image of jesus
[1:52:15] christ so when god can see that
[1:52:18] he comes right back
[1:52:20] and turns that word into spirit again
[1:52:23] and the spirit of god will unite with
[1:52:26] the flesh of man and you will be mrs
[1:52:28] lord jesus christ the word of god made
[1:52:30] flesh in you
[1:52:32] you will speak
[1:52:33] and your what will be backed demons will
[1:52:36] scream in your presence and god will do
[1:52:39] everything you speak it will be a
[1:52:41] command
