[5:31] [Music]
[5:36] Lord, I want to

[6:27] heart. Oh
[6:29] Lord. Lord, I want to
[6:34] be more
[6:37] holy in my
[6:40] heart. Let's pray. Father, we thank you
[6:43] for the love that we feel, for your
[6:46] presence that we feel, and the desire
[6:49] that you place in our heart to be a
[6:52] Christian, to be more
[6:55] Christlike, to be more more
[6:57] holy, to be just like you, God. We are
[7:00] blessed this morning to be hungering and
[7:03] thirsting after
[7:05] righteousness. You said it. Blessed are
[7:07] they that hunger and thirst after
[7:09] righteousness. They shall be filled.
[7:11] Father, our hearts
[7:13] are hungry this morning. Feed us, Jesus.
[7:18] Feed us with your word. Feed us with
[7:20] your spirit, with your presence, with
[7:22] your power. And let us leave here more
[7:25] like you, looking like you, walking like
[7:27] you, talking like you. Grant it, Father,
[7:30] in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen.
[7:33] You may have your
[7:34] seats. Oh, glory to God.
[7:42] [Music]
[7:46] Yeah.
[7:47] Is that your desire this morning?
[7:50] Oh, to be a Christian. Not a church
[7:53] member, a Christian. To be
[7:57] Christlike. We want to welcome this
[7:59] morning Venicia Ramlugan. Ramlutan and
[8:02] Videsh Ramluchan. So, God bless you.
[8:04] Welcome to the Headstone Tabernacle.
[8:07] Vania.
[8:09] Amen. Oh, what a presence we feel this
[8:12] morning. Oh, you under great
[8:15] expectation for God to speak to your
[8:17] heart. Amen. I just love it this
[8:20] morning. I I love what I feel this
[8:22] morning. Feel his presence. It's just
[8:24] something else to be in the presence of
[8:26] God. But Ram says, "We heard the
[8:28] message. We hear the message
[8:29] intellectually, but if we could lay in
[8:31] the presence until it beats down."
[8:33] Hallelujah. You come early, you're
[8:35] digging to pray and you lay in his
[8:37] presence. Oh, we could talk and you
[8:39] could listen and you could read and you
[8:41] could write and all that is intellect.
[8:42] But then when that presence come and
[8:44] take from the mind and put it into the
[8:46] heart, make a connection from your head
[8:48] to your heart, it changes the whole
[8:50] situation. Changes everything along. You
[8:53] know the prophet one will be walk be
[8:54] talking and love will just drop down in
[8:56] the building and all the evil be taken
[8:58] out. Praise God. Do you believe that?
[9:01] Amen. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[9:04] Amen. Okay, before we get in the word, I
[9:06] have something to read. This is on our
[9:08] Facebook page and it's something from
[9:12] the hour of God deliverance. It's
[9:13] matching time, you know. It's matching
[9:15] time. He said, "I told my brother, I
[9:18] don't care whether my shoes match my
[9:19] trousers. My trousers match my coat. I
[9:22] want my experience to match God's
[9:25] Bible."
[9:27] Isn't that right?
[9:29] And if you want to match something,
[9:31] match your experience against Paul's.
[9:33] That's what we need is a matching time
[9:35] with Paul's faith in the Bible. That's
[9:38] our example, right? Real matching time.
[9:41] Don't try to match your neighbor. Match
[9:44] some of the saints of the Bible. Are you
[9:47] ready? And if you are a saint, act like
[9:50] a saint. Walk like a saint. Dress like a
[9:54] saint. Talk like a saint. Pray like a
[9:58] saint. Believe like a saint. Shout like
[10:02] a saint. Be like a saint. Live like a
[10:05] saint. Die like a saint. And go to
[10:08] heaven like a saint.
[10:12] Oh
[10:13] hallelujah. Oh glory to God. So heaven
[10:17] going to be expecting you to come
[10:19] through the
[10:20] doors like a saint. So you don't want
[10:24] heaven say he ain't a saint. You want to
[10:26] be a saint, a sanctified one, one that
[10:30] is separated unto God. Hallelujah.
[10:33] Friend or no friend. Oh, husband or no
[10:35] husband, wife or no wife, children or no
[10:38] children, whether you have the support
[10:39] of your family or not, you belong to
[10:41] God. Hallelujah. God only allow you to
[10:44] come through however they come through,
[10:45] but you belong to God. Your flesh and
[10:48] your face may resemble mommy and daddy,
[10:49] but you belong to God. That flesh come
[10:52] from the dust and that dust will go
[10:54] right back to the dust. But that gene
[10:56] and that your soul that come from God,
[10:58] isn't that right? Oh, blessed be the
[11:01] name of the Lord. So, I'm excited this
[11:02] morning. I thank God for last week's
[11:05] service. I really thoroughly enjoy that
[11:07] about being focused and going back past
[11:10] Giggal and Betel and Jericho and
[11:13] pressing your way to that purpose in God
[11:16] for your life. And something have to
[11:18] call you to press. Amen. And that's what
[11:20] brother Ram says, a person can't get
[11:22] desperate and called until God speaks to
[11:24] them. And you come here for God to speak
[11:26] to you. Amen. So let us stand as we want
[11:29] to go into the word. Want to turn to 2
[11:31] Kings chapter 2. Want to read from verse
[11:34] 6 to 8. Joshua chapter 1. Want to read
[11:38] verse 1 to3 and verse 6. We want to read
[11:42] Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 14.
[11:51] So let's go to 2
[11:53] Kings
[11:55] 2 6. And Elijah said unto him talking
[12:00] speaking to Elisha, Tar I pray thee
[12:02] here, for the Lord had sent me to
[12:04] Jordan. And he said, as the Lord liveth,
[12:09] and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave
[12:11] thee. And they too went
[12:15] on. And 50 of the sons of the prophets
[12:18] went and stood to view a far off. And
[12:21] they too stood by Jordan. And Elijah
[12:26] took his mantle and wrapped it together
[12:28] and smoked the waters, and they were
[12:30] divided hither and thither, so that they
[12:33] too went over on dry ground. Joshua
[12:37] chapter 1.
[12:40] Now after the death of Moses, the
[12:42] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[12:43] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[12:46] of Nun, Moses the minister, saying,
[12:49] Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore
[12:53] arise, go over this
[12:55] Jordan, and thou and all this people
[12:58] unto the land which I do give unto them,
[13:02] even to the children of Israel.
[13:04] Every place that the soul of your foot
[13:06] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[13:09] you, as I said unto Moses. Verse six, be
[13:13] strong of a good courage, for unto this
[13:17] people shalt thou divide for an
[13:20] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[13:22] their fathers to give them. And let's
[13:25] look at Matthew chapter 4 reading verse
[13:30] one. Then we go to verse 14.
[13:33] Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into
[13:38] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[13:41] devil. Verse
[13:59] 14. Okay.
[14:10] Okay.
[14:23] Amen. Oh, praise the Lord.
[14:29] Okay. Sorry. It's supposed to be Luke
[14:31] actually. Luke
[14:34] 4 verse 1 and verse 14. I'm sorry. Luke
[14:39] chapter 1. And Jesus being Luke 4:1. And
[14:43] Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[14:45] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[14:48] Spirit into the wilderness. Verse 14.
[14:51] And Jesus returned in the power of the
[14:53] spirit unto Galilee. And they went out a
[14:56] theme of him round about throughout all
[14:59] the regions round about. Let us pray.
[15:01] Father, we thank you for your word and
[15:03] we pray you come down in a special way
[15:04] and speak to our hearts in Jesus name I
[15:07] ask it. Amen and amen. You may be
[15:09] seated. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[15:14] Glory.
[15:16] Oh, praise the Lord. So, I guess I was
[15:19] looking at those two scriptures. Both of
[15:20] them have it. But I I wanted to get that
[15:22] one and somehow end up putting um
[15:26] Matthew. Amen. We have a title this
[15:29] morning. Let us cross Jordan.
[15:32] Hallelujah. To an open vision.
[15:35] Hallelujah. Of another Ephesians.
[15:38] Hallelujah.
[15:40] Let us cross Jordan to an open
[15:43] vision of another Ephesians.
[15:46] and have an
[15:48] inspiration before the bride returns in
[15:51] power.
[15:53] That is what my inspiration is. Before
[15:55] the bride returns in power. Now I want
[15:58] you to turn your Bibles to 1 John
[16:00] chapter 2. I want you to follow me with
[16:03] this context scripture reading from
[16:04] verse 15 to
[16:06] 16. 1 John chapter 2 reading from verse
[16:11] 15 to 16.
[16:16] And John is right after
[16:20] Peter. We verse 15 says, "Love not the
[16:24] world, neither the things that are in
[16:27] the world. If any man love the world,
[16:31] the love of the father is not in him.
[16:34] For all that is in the world, the lust
[16:39] of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
[16:43] the pride of life, is not of the Father,
[16:47] but is of the world. Amen. And the world
[16:50] passeth away, and the lust thereof, but
[16:54] he that doeth the will of God abideth
[16:58] forever. I want to read that one again.
[17:01] For all, verse 16, for all that is in
[17:04] the world, the lust of the flesh, the
[17:09] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life
[17:13] is not of the father, but is of the
[17:16] world. May God bless his word, and
[17:19] praise God. Blessed be the name of the
[17:22] Lord. Hallelujah. And this is brother
[17:24] Brandham from God called Man. He was
[17:26] saying before prayer, I would like to
[17:29] ask this question to people inside out.
[17:31] How many in here sincerely would like to
[17:34] go with Jesus down to Jordan tonight and
[17:38] dare cross over there where you could
[17:40] see a vision and see what God really
[17:44] means. Would you raise your hands? God
[17:45] bless you. Go down to Jordan, not down
[17:48] to a seminary. Elisha passed right by
[17:51] that. Terry here. I don't want to.
[17:53] That's man-made. It's never quenched
[17:55] that thirst of a man who is thirsting
[17:58] for God. Amen. A seminary or information
[18:02] can never quench that thirst that a man
[18:05] have for God. He says what we need, you
[18:08] can get men out of themselves, away from
[18:10] their school of theology, away from
[18:12] their self-style ways, fearless men, men
[18:15] of character with you who believes you
[18:17] and take you at your word. And he's
[18:20] praying, God, many of them standing here
[18:22] present that will give all they got to
[18:24] the Lord Jesus and sell out the world,
[18:26] go past Giggal, the place of confession
[18:28] and Christian beginnings, go past the
[18:30] school of the prophets that set back
[18:32] there with theology and go to Jordan to
[18:34] an open vision and when they cross and
[18:37] find that God still lives. Do you
[18:41] believe that? Oh, praise the name of the
[18:44] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[18:46] But the trouble today is that ministers,
[18:50] very few ministers are trying to
[18:52] establish Christ in the people's heart.
[18:55] Very few ministers is trying to do that.
[18:58] They're trying to establish themselves,
[19:01] their ministry, who they are, their
[19:04] idea, their
[19:06] interpretation. Very few are
[19:08] establishing the word of God. Isn't that
[19:11] right? Because Eve had a lust. That lust
[19:15] was for knowledge. Isn't that right? And
[19:16] brother Bham spoke about that. Isn't
[19:18] that right? It was wrong for her to do
[19:20] that. And we find out what happened
[19:22] there. Isn't that right? And the
[19:24] ministers today supposed to be
[19:26] establishing Christ in the people's
[19:28] heart, not the church, not their
[19:31] ministries, not their ideas, but Christ.
[19:34] And Christ is the word, so once the word
[19:36] is preached without being flavored and
[19:39] have interpretation to it, you are
[19:40] getting Christ the word because in the
[19:43] beginning was the word. The word was
[19:45] with God and the word was God. Isn't
[19:47] that something else? So Jesus Christ,
[19:50] isn't that right? When he was 12 years
[19:53] old, he knew he was about the father's
[19:55] business. Hallelujah. He was in the
[19:57] channel of the will of God. Hallelujah.
[19:59] He was a son 12 years old. Know you not,
[20:02] I must be about my father's business. It
[20:05] take him 18 years to ripen to come into
[20:09] position to be positionally placed by
[20:12] the pillar of fire by charity at the
[20:15] Jordan River. Could somebody say amen?
[20:17] Isn't that right? So during those years
[20:20] of silence, he wasn't idle. He was doing
[20:22] something. He was in the word waiting to
[20:25] fulfill the word. During those 18 years
[20:28] of silence, Jesus was getting a
[20:31] revelation of what the father has to for
[20:34] his life. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[20:38] Amen. Amen. Glory to God. It come like
[20:41] if you're going for a car license. You
[20:43] want to get a license, drive a car, you
[20:44] reach 18 or whatever, and you want to
[20:46] you have to get the information first.
[20:48] That's right. How you go about getting
[20:49] that? You're getting your documents.
[20:51] You're getting your ID card and so on.
[20:53] And then you have to find out you have a
[20:55] booklet of the regulations that you have
[20:57] to pass. You have to get a date set, but
[20:59] you're not a driver yet. You're not
[21:01] approved yet. You're not confirmed yet.
[21:04] When you get your learners now, you get
[21:05] to go and get your test drive and so on.
[21:07] But you're not approved yet. You still
[21:09] have to pass a test in the yard to see
[21:11] if you can reverse well and do your
[21:13] three-point turn. And then if you don't
[21:15] pass there, you can't even go out. So
[21:17] you got to pass the first test before
[21:19] you go out in the road because you have
[21:22] a weapon called a car and the car loose
[21:24] you just like that and you cannot drive.
[21:27] So they have to test you first and when
[21:28] you pass the inside test you go for the
[21:31] outside test and then you get approved.
[21:34] But that's what we talking about. You
[21:36] could sit and study how to drive, what
[21:39] kind of car to drive and if you don't go
[21:42] and pass through the process, you are
[21:44] not licensed to drive. Could somebody
[21:47] say amen? You can preach how nice
[21:49] driving is. You can explain how to do
[21:52] it. But until you go and do it, then do
[21:55] it yet. So before you come back in
[21:58] power, there is something have to take
[22:00] place. Before this super church and
[22:02] super race and third pull and spoken
[22:05] word and doing this and doing that and
[22:08] when the press come down, watch the
[22:10] third pull them. Before all of that, oh
[22:13] give the Lord a shout. before all of
[22:15] that.
[22:19] Oh, hallelujah.
[22:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just before all
[22:25] of that, we want to get down to that
[22:27] this morning. Oh, praise God. Amen.
[22:30] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[22:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Originally,
[22:38] in Genesis, the instructions was for man
[22:40] to have dominion over the fish, beasts,
[22:45] birds, was spirit man, Genesis 2, there
[22:49] was no man of the soil. But that real
[22:51] man, real man, somebody say real man.
[22:54] Real man was no flesh man. Real man was
[22:57] spirit man. And God put real man into
[23:00] flesh man. Man became a living soul. But
[23:03] the original real man was spirit man.
[23:06] Spirit was leading man. Now we have man
[23:09] leading. But it was spirit leading man.
[23:12] Now we have flesh leading. Oh, give the
[23:15] Lord a shout of praise.
[23:21] So if be seated, if we're going to come
[23:24] back to Genesis, if we're going to come
[23:26] back to original, we have to get back to
[23:29] where the spirit uh leads man.
[23:33] Jesus was led by the spirit. Come on
[23:37] now. Come on now. Where he was going in
[23:41] the spirit. Oh, hallelujah. He was going
[23:45] to power but yet ab brought to pass.
[23:48] [Applause]
[23:51] Hallelujah. He was led by the spirit
[23:55] into the wilderness.
[24:01] So Jesus
[24:02] Come on now. You have to demonstrate.
[24:05] Amen. He had power over himself.
[24:10] [Music]
[24:11] [Applause]
[24:13] before his ministry could take off.
[24:16] Before he put in the final gear to let
[24:19] that engine rumble,
[24:22] before that car took off, he had us to
[24:25] demonstrate he had
[24:27] power over himself.
[24:31] Because John described all that is in
[24:33] the world
[24:36] and all that is in the world is either
[24:39] under lust of the eyes
[24:42] is either under lust of the flesh or
[24:46] it's under the pride of life. Every sin,
[24:50] every wickedness, every evil is under
[24:52] one of that.
[24:55] I'm not hearing you this morning. I'm
[24:58] not hearing you this morning. Every
[25:00] issue be it government, be it kingdoms,
[25:04] be it family, be it neighbors, be it on
[25:07] the job, is one of them.
[25:12] [Music]
[25:13] Lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh,
[25:18] and the pride
[25:20] of life. Oh, hallelujah. Somebody say,
[25:23] "Break it down like that." Hallelujah.
[25:26] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Thank you,
[25:30] Jesus.
[25:32] Hallelujah.
[25:35] Hallelujah.
[25:40] Proverbs, come on now.
[25:43] 6:16. These six things that God hate.
[25:50] Yeah. Seven are an abomination to him.
[25:55] Amen. Number one, a proud look.
[26:01] He say pride, you know, because he could
[26:04] see pride. You see, somebody could walk
[26:06] with pride and people don't know that's
[26:08] on the inside because they could walk
[26:10] with their head down and they're proud.
[26:12] But God hates
[26:17] a proud look. That have to do with the
[26:20] pride of life. That have to do with you
[26:23] feeling superior to others and you
[26:26] seeing others inferior to you. Come on,
[26:29] say amen, somebody. God hates
[26:33] [Music]
[26:36] that. Are there believers in the house?
[26:41] [Applause]
[26:46] God, it's a proud look. A lying tongue,
[26:51] hands that shed innocent blood, a heart
[26:55] that deiseth wicked imaginations,
[26:59] feet that be swift to run into mischief,
[27:02] a false witness that speaketh lies, and
[27:05] he that sweth discord among brethren.
[27:11] God hates that. God hates that. You see,
[27:16] you don't have to be agree with me to be
[27:18] my brethren.
[27:20] We don't have to have the same doctrine
[27:22] to be brethren. I'm not hearing you. I
[27:26] am not hearing you. Even families have
[27:29] fights. Even brothers and sisters have
[27:32] fights. Brothers and brothers have
[27:34] fight. Sisters and sisters are fight.
[27:36] And they are still brothers.
[27:39] And they are still sisters. And they are
[27:42] still family. Well, we are God's family.
[27:46] Let's
[27:47] fight. Oh, give the Lord a shout inside
[27:50] of here. Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord
[27:53] a shout. Yes, you heard right. Let's
[27:56] fight. But after the fight is over, we
[27:59] are still
[28:00] [Applause]
[28:06] family. Come on now. Come on now. Say
[28:10] amen, somebody. Let's fight for what is
[28:14] right. Let's fight for the faith that
[28:18] was once delivered. We are going to
[28:22] fight. We pledge to love the
[28:27] brethren. Oh
[28:30] hallelujah.
[28:31] Glory. Glory to God. Amen.
[28:35] Amen.
[28:37] Oh, glory to God. You may not like me,
[28:40] but I love God. You may not like me, but
[28:42] I love the word. I'm not here for like
[28:45] and contest. I'm here to represent the
[28:48] kingdom.
[28:50] Oh, hallelujah. Which kingdom? The
[28:52] kingdom of the most high God. Oh, give
[28:56] the Lord some praises,
[28:57] [Applause]
[29:00] people. Oh, hallelujah.
[29:09] Hallelujah.
[29:11] All right,
[29:13] you may be seated. This is actually a
[29:15] continuation
[29:17] from last week.
[29:19] So, if you didn't hear last week, tape
[29:22] it. Get it. Go and hear it. You need to
[29:25] hear it. Amen. Oh my. Glory.
[29:30] Hallelujah.
[29:33] So, I want to look at Luke 4 a little
[29:35] bit. Can find it. You got to find it.
[29:37] Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[29:39] returned from Jordan. Jordan seemed to
[29:42] be connected to all these things. Boy,
[29:44] Elijah had to go down Jordan. Jesus hit
[29:46] his Jordan. Jesus had to hit his Jordan.
[29:48] Oh my. Joshua had to cross Jordan. What?
[29:51] What is beyond this Jordan? Why we have
[29:54] to go past Jordan? Why? Why we can't
[29:57] stand at the banks and just watch over
[29:59] yonder? Oh, hallelujah. Why is that?
[30:02] Because Jordan represents debt.
[30:05] Jordan represent a new day in your life.
[30:08] When you cross Jordan is a new
[30:10] inspiration, is a a new you have not
[30:12] passed this way before. If any man be in
[30:15] Christ, he's a new new creator.
[30:19] [Applause]
[30:22] Jordan Jesus full of the Holy Ghost
[30:25] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[30:28] ministers association into a debate on
[30:30] the word. No,
[30:34] he was inspired to call a convention to
[30:37] discuss his Jordan. No, he was led by
[30:41] the spirit into the wilderness being 40
[30:44] days tempted of the devil. And in those
[30:46] days he eat nothing. And when they were
[30:49] ended, he hungered.
[30:52] Amen. Here we go.
[30:55] Lust of the flesh. He is hungry. Yes.
[31:00] And the devil come while you're hungry
[31:03] to tempt Jesus.
[31:05] The devil said unto him, "If thou be the
[31:07] son of God, command the stone to be made
[31:09] bread
[31:11] cuz you could do with a sandwich."
[31:16] And there's only stones all around. If
[31:17] you are who you are, we know you could
[31:20] do something. But Jesus wasn't commanded
[31:22] to follow the instructions
[31:25] or the leading of Satan. Amen. Jesus
[31:30] answered him saying, "It is written that
[31:33] man shall not live by bread alone, but
[31:35] by every word of God."
[31:38] He overcame
[31:39] the lust of the flesh by the word. Amen.
[31:43] He is gaining dominion over himself.
[31:47] Proven ah
[31:49] that that cannot uh be enslaved to him.
[31:53] Enslave him.
[31:54] [Music]
[31:55] Watch devil take him up to a high
[31:58] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[32:00] of the world in a moment of time. Los of
[32:03] the eyes. What a temptation. What your
[32:07] eye could see. All of this is mine. I
[32:10] guess the devil had devil had a
[32:12] projector there and he was a curved
[32:16] screen big screen and all the kingdoms
[32:20] of this world are mine.
[32:23] And the devil said unto him, "All this
[32:24] power will I give thee, and the glory of
[32:28] them, for that is delivered unto me, and
[32:30] to whomsoever I will give it."
[32:33] He's talking big.
[32:35] He not talking like if he doesn't have
[32:37] it. He know he in charge. Yes. And he
[32:40] said, "I I you know, I mean, I could fix
[32:42] your right.
[32:46] If thou therefore will worship me, all
[32:49] shall be thine."
[32:52] what he was seeing with his eyes.
[32:56] Jesus answered and said unto him, "Get
[32:59] thee behind me, Satan, for it is
[33:01] written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy
[33:03] God, and him only thou shalt serve."
[33:09] [Applause]
[33:12] Now, Satan going down deep.
[33:16] He no man.
[33:19] I mean it's hundreds of years you have
[33:20] been dealing with man love himself a lot
[33:24] right
[33:26] could be very proud
[33:29] and he brought him to
[33:32] Jerusalem Satan set him on the pinnacle
[33:34] of a temple and said unto him if thou be
[33:36] the son of God cast thyself down from
[33:39] there in other words show off show who
[33:41] you are because it is written he shall
[33:45] give his angels charge over thee now if
[33:47] you take that head thing. If you take
[33:50] that basket as we just see in China, if
[33:52] you take that basket and say the
[33:54] scripture say so it's written and you're
[33:56] going to say everybody look for the
[33:58] angels to hold me.
[34:02] He was going to fail that test. But
[34:04] Jesus told the
[34:07] devil and in their hands watch they
[34:09] shall bear thee up least at any time
[34:11] thou shalt dash thy foot against a
[34:12] stone. So the devil listen if you're not
[34:14] reading the scriptures the devil is.
[34:16] [Applause]
[34:18] because he could quote it back to try to
[34:21] tie her up. And Jesus said and said unto
[34:25] him, it it is said, "Thou shalt not
[34:27] tempt the Lord thy God." And when the
[34:30] devil was ended, all the temptation, he
[34:33] departed from a season. And that's how
[34:35] we get to verse 14. So before you return
[34:37] in power,
[34:39] [Applause]
[34:42] all that is in the world, all right, you
[34:44] have to face the
[34:47] lust of the eyes. The lust of the flesh
[34:50] and the pride of life. Hallelujah. But
[34:53] you are going to overcome
[34:56] because there's a prophecy that the
[34:58] bride will cross Jordan
[35:01] and God will raise up spiritual Joshua
[35:04] to take the people over
[35:06] Jordan. You don't have to cross Jordan
[35:09] alone. Oh, hallelujah. Give the Lord a
[35:13] shout of praise.
[35:15] Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe that? Oh,
[35:19] blessed be the name of the Lord. Glory
[35:21] to God. So
[35:24] Jesus prove he had control and dominion
[35:29] over his human spirit by overcoming the
[35:32] lust of the eyes. By overcoming the lust
[35:34] of the flesh, by overcoming the pride of
[35:37] life. Isn't that right? And before
[35:39] adopted son can have dominion over
[35:40] others and other things, you must
[35:42] display dominion over yourself.
[35:45] Therefore, it doesn't matter what church
[35:47] you go to.
[35:49] Doctrine doesn't change you. Your
[35:51] behavior does. Come on, say amen,
[35:54] somebody. Oh yes. Oh yes. People believe
[35:58] because what they believe will take them
[36:00] through. But Rand didn't teach that. He
[36:02] say you got to apply the token, brother
[36:04] Tabernacle.
[36:06] Hallelujah. You can't say you believe a
[36:09] prophet. You believe Moses and you're
[36:11] not applying the blood. Moses said take
[36:13] a lamb. Moses said kill the lamb. Moses
[36:16] said take the blood. Moses said apply
[36:18] the blood and the blood shall be a
[36:20] token. And when I see the blood, I'm
[36:22] going to pass over you. That's what
[36:24] Moses said. Oh, glory to God. I can't
[36:28] tell you what I feel. I have to tell you
[36:30] what God said.
[36:32] Come on, say amen, somebody. I can feel
[36:35] sorry for you. But what did God say?
[36:44] We not called to address things by our
[36:46] feelings and by our emotions.
[36:49] Hallelujah. We are called to address
[36:50] things by the word. Amen. And the word
[36:52] only. So brother, you must be born
[36:55] again. He said you might get up from
[36:57] there and do anything. You might dance
[36:58] in the spirit. You might cry like
[37:00] anybody could cry. You might run up and
[37:03] down the floor. You might join every
[37:04] church. You might do anything you want
[37:06] to and go right back and defile a man's
[37:11] wife and break up a man's home. Some of
[37:14] you women,
[37:17] you will go right back. No matter how
[37:20] much the word comes to you to do, right,
[37:23] you won't recognize it. You will never
[37:26] let your hair grow. You will never dress
[37:28] right. You will still be exactly like
[37:31] the world because you are not dead to
[37:33] the world yet.
[37:35] [Applause]
[37:37] You are alive with it. Some of you men
[37:40] will never quit drinking, smoking. You
[37:42] will never quit lusting after fall woman
[37:44] immorally dressed. When you see them on
[37:47] the street instead of turning your heads
[37:48] and walking away, you will still lust
[37:50] right on just the same because you are
[37:52] alive with the world.
[37:55] But when that
[37:57] sacrifice has been received,
[38:01] you are dead.
[38:06] He didn't say when you fast. He didn't
[38:08] say when you pray. He didn't say when
[38:11] you go on some hill on some mountain
[38:12] somewhere all by yourself. He's not
[38:15] talking about that. He's talking about
[38:17] something supernatural.
[38:20] [Applause]
[38:26] You may be seated. You see, if you could
[38:28] stop smoking, that is you. If you could
[38:31] stop drinking, that is still you.
[38:36] But when fire comes,
[38:39] and receive your sacrifice, that's him.
[38:45] Then the desire for sin is burnt out. It
[38:48] is no longer there. Then the devil have
[38:51] no power over the bloodwashed ones. I'm
[38:55] not hearing you this morning. Oh, glory
[38:58] to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[39:02] God. Amen.
[39:04] So that is why you can't
[39:07] be legalized into it. Thou shalt thou
[39:11] shalt not. Thou shalt thou shalt not.
[39:12] Thou shalt that still you trying to obey
[39:15] some laws and stuff. That is why you
[39:18] have to press
[39:20] yourself, push yourself beyond giggle,
[39:24] beyond battle. You see something, you
[39:27] got to die and you have to want to die.
[39:30] You got to come down to your Jordan. Oh,
[39:33] glory to God. You have something to
[39:35] overcome. That's why you struggle. You
[39:38] got to struggle. You must struggle.
[39:40] Struggling is part of this whole thing.
[39:42] Every day we struggle. Every day there's
[39:44] a battle. There's a warfare. Every day
[39:46] there's temptation. Every day because
[39:48] all that is in the world is in the
[39:50] world. The lust of the eyes, the lust of
[39:52] the flesh, the pride of life. You can't
[39:54] run from it. You can't hide from it. You
[39:57] got to overcome it. But greater is he
[40:00] that's in you. That's he that's in the
[40:10] world. Greater is he. Greater is the
[40:13] word in you. Oh, glory to God. Do you
[40:16] believe that? Your soul, listen to this.
[40:19] Are you ready? Not your flesh. Your soul
[40:24] is laid upon the altar of God's
[40:26] judgment. Oh my. And it shows that you
[40:29] haven't received it yet. If you are
[40:30] still alive in the world, God never took
[40:32] it. And you people talking about getting
[40:34] the Holy Ghost. And all you have to wait
[40:36] so long, here you are until God received
[40:39] that sacrifice. until it's laid in the
[40:42] judgments. Until his judgment has
[40:44] actually killed your senses. Well, I'm
[40:47] going to turn over a new page. That
[40:48] ain't it. Well, I know I used to smoke.
[40:52] I'm going to quit smoking. That still
[40:53] isn't it. Until God, he's talking about
[40:56] supernatural something. Notice when
[40:59] Elisha was found Elijah, it was normal.
[41:02] Stay here. I'm not staying. I'm going.
[41:04] Stay here. I'm not saying I'm going.
[41:06] Stay here. But when that man took the
[41:08] mantle and struck the Jordan, that was
[41:13] supernatural. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[41:15] of praise. It wasn't hold this, say
[41:18] this, say to our father and tree, Haley
[41:20] Mary. It wasn't nothing like that.
[41:23] Believe this doctrine. Hold on to this.
[41:25] It wasn't that. It was something
[41:27] supernatural. The Jordan opened up and
[41:30] they too marched on. Oh, give the Lord a
[41:34] shout of praise.
[41:36] Hallelujah.
[41:38] Glory to God. I kind of like that
[41:42] because after they walk through Jordan,
[41:43] Jordan stay open up. Jordan close up
[41:47] normal.
[41:51] So Elijah know to go back over it have
[41:54] to open up.
[41:58] He never did that before. He saw it
[42:01] happen but he never experienced it. Oh,
[42:04] glory to God. He saw the man of God did
[42:06] it. He was a young man watching this old
[42:09] man. This old man was about to go home.
[42:12] The young man of God to get a vision. He
[42:14] is seeing something. He wanted double of
[42:16] what that man had. He want more than
[42:19] what that man had. He had faith to ask
[42:21] for it. He had faith to believe it. He
[42:23] had faith to call for it. Oh, give the
[42:26] Lord a shout of praise. What does your
[42:28] faith tell you this
[42:31] morning? Amen.
[42:37] What does your faith Hallelujah?
[42:40] We trying to break limitation inside of
[42:42] here. That was trying and limitations
[42:44] most of that is inside your mind. What
[42:47] you can't do and what you can't do. We
[42:49] said already we want when you begin to
[42:50] ask God, God say ask a hard thing. God
[42:53] have to tell the angel these people in
[42:55] Trinidad, they asking for hard things.
[42:58] If Hallelujah. Come on now. Come on now.
[43:00] You're not asking hard enough. God must
[43:03] say they ask a hard thing.
[43:11] What are you saying? Give God a
[43:13] sleepless night. You may be seated. Oh,
[43:15] glory. Hallelujah. We know that's not
[43:18] possible, but I'm saying that to you.
[43:20] Let God turn and tussle. But look what
[43:22] they asked for. They asking for a Holy
[43:23] Ghost revival, a real revival. They
[43:26] asking for the baptism of the Holy
[43:27] Ghost. They asking for refilling. They
[43:29] asking for signs and wonders. They're
[43:30] asking for the demon to come out the
[43:32] house. Demon to come out the wife,
[43:34] husband, children, family. They asking
[43:37] for restoration.
[43:39] [Applause]
[43:51] Glory. You be seated. Hallelujah. I can
[43:54] see God when God scan his news feed.
[43:56] Somebody good morning. I was just
[43:58] passed. Good morning. Hello Lord. Hello
[44:00] Lord.
[44:02] Hallelujah.
[44:04] Then God get a long paragraph.
[44:08] My emergency.
[44:11] Very urgent.
[44:13] I'm desperate.
[44:15] I'm not going to leave here till you
[44:18] fill me with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[44:23] [Applause]
[44:28] You think God b and stop at good
[44:30] morning, good evening, hallelujah,
[44:31] praise the Lord.
[44:34] [Applause]
[44:36] When God print out the day's take,
[44:39] you may be seated. Amen. Of prayer
[44:41] requests,
[44:43] he said, "These people believe me
[44:45] because the things they ask me for,
[44:46] they're not seeing with their eyes.
[44:48] They're not touching. They're not in the
[44:49] senses. They're going past the loss of
[44:51] the eye. They're not. They're going past
[44:54] their feelings and emotion. They start
[44:56] to believe for things that are
[44:57] impossible. All of a sudden they they
[45:00] start to think all things are possible.
[45:02] We got to do something for those people.
[45:05] The Bible said the Lord himself went
[45:08] everywhere with them confirming the word
[45:12] with signs
[45:14] following. You not hearing me this
[45:16] morning? My God. I'm not feeling to
[45:18] preach. I'm now feeling to preach.
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:28] God, you may be seated. Was so pleased
[45:32] with this apostolic church, with this
[45:35] early church, with this alpha church. He
[45:38] went everywhere with them. They go to
[45:41] the market, he is there. They go to the
[45:43] sea, he is there. They go up the
[45:45] mountain, he is there. to get in
[45:48] trouble. He is there. The Lord
[45:56] himself. Oh, glory. Oh my God. If you
[46:00] don't praise God for this, I don't know
[46:02] what you're going to praise God for. If
[46:03] you don't shout for
[46:08] this, you may be seated. Do you
[46:11] understand? We are getting somewhere.
[46:12] [Music]
[46:16] Do you understand? Satan have to take
[46:18] note.
[46:20] [Applause]
[46:23] That his grip upon your life is being
[46:25] broken.
[46:29] And once you break out, oh, hear me.
[46:32] Hear me. Once you break out, the devil
[46:35] can't put you back in.
[46:42] Hallelujah.
[46:45] Oh, glory to God. I wonder if I'm going
[46:47] to get through this message today. Oh,
[46:51] hallelujah.
[46:52] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[46:56] Glory. Glory.
[46:59] You may be seasoned. I want to I want to
[47:03] unsettle your mind. You may be seasoned.
[47:06] Yeah. I want your mind to stretch.
[47:08] Yeah. Because once it stretch, it can't
[47:10] tighten again. Once your mind break out,
[47:13] it can't fit back in again. Once you
[47:15] break your new experience, you can't go
[47:17] back to the old again. Once you cross
[47:19] Jordan, they can't pull you back before
[47:21] Jordan. Before Jordan, you're in this.
[47:24] You're in that in the other. But when
[47:26] you come back across Jordan, what
[47:28] happened to Elijah? Elijah ripped his
[47:30] mantle. He tear up his old robe. He got
[47:33] a new robe because he had to return in
[47:36] power. You can't return in power with
[47:39] that old self. Come on now. With that
[47:41] old way, with that old attitude.
[47:44] Something got to tear up. Something got
[47:47] to rip up. Something got to shake
[47:50] [Applause]
[47:55] up.
[47:57] Glory.
[48:00] Glory. You may be seated.
[48:03] Some people
[48:06] they start to get quiet and they only
[48:08] watching Jordan yet. Yet the water is
[48:11] cold.
[48:13] Jordan water not warm. You know, it's
[48:15] not like a warm like God warm it up for
[48:16] you like you want to make a backstroke
[48:18] or something. No, no, no. This is cold.
[48:21] This is chilly. This is death.
[48:30] But we come we come to the spot. We come
[48:32] to the place where there's not other
[48:34] room. There's nowhere else to turn. Oh
[48:37] yes, we are confronted with it. And
[48:39] before the people go, the minister had
[48:41] to go.
[48:43] [Applause]
[48:44] All they should be shouting. All should
[48:47] be pointing in the true true you.
[48:52] All doing amen. I want to get
[48:54] frightened.
[48:55] The minister got tell people go
[48:58] Jordan. Go Jordan people.
[49:01] will go and tell Joshua. God said Moses
[49:04] my servant is dead. Now therefore take
[49:08] this people and
[49:13] take. Come on now. You don't lead from
[49:18] behind. You lead from in
[49:21] front.
[49:23] Glory.
[49:25] Glory.
[49:27] Glory. Hallelujah.
[49:30] Glory to God. You may be seated. Two
[49:34] things. Take them over. Amen. And divide
[49:38] inheritance. Let's split into three
[49:40] things. Take them over. Conquer the
[49:43] land. Then divide inheritance. So once
[49:46] you cross Jordan, you have something
[49:47] you're looking for. You ain't crossing
[49:50] Jordan say I cross Jordan. I cross
[49:52] Jordan. I cross Jordan. No. You cause
[49:54] Jordan to sing specials. Amen.
[49:57] They call Jordan for inheritance.
[50:03] If your grandfather leaves an
[50:05] inheritance for you and you look bad
[50:07] about it again, you're a slacker.
[50:09] [Applause]
[50:12] Especially now where land price so high
[50:17] house so expensive you renting somewhere
[50:20] only somebody come with some emissary
[50:22] come and tell you listen your
[50:23] grandfather leave you 10 acres of land
[50:25] with a house and this and that and then
[50:27] and you studying the rent coming next
[50:29] month
[50:31] [Applause]
[50:34] and when you going to see the land now
[50:36] it have squatter one squatter two and
[50:37] squatter three
[50:40] in front the property and you tell them,
[50:43] you know, I just get a note that this is
[50:44] my land and they find you looking
[50:46] smallly.
[50:49] You're not looking like a bad like a a
[50:51] bully and they say get away from here.
[50:54] All right, coming back with the
[50:57] enforcer. Then you go and get the
[51:00] application and they get some
[51:02] enforcement. But that we telling the
[51:04] devil, we coming back with enforcement
[51:08] to take what we know belong to us. We
[51:12] are going to
[51:13] return in
[51:18] power.
[51:19] Hallelujah. Glory to
[51:22] God.
[51:23] Jesus, my God. You may be seated. Jesus
[51:27] returned in power after what? after
[51:31] fellowshipping with the minister
[51:32] association. No, they will drain your
[51:35] power. Jesus return in power after
[51:39] wilderness.
[51:41] Let we go in the wilderness if have no
[51:42] we in no wilderness.
[51:45] Amen.
[51:46] [Applause]
[51:50] It's a individual Jordan. It's a
[51:53] individual wilderness. You want to die
[51:56] out to yourself.
[52:03] Pride of life.
[52:05] You may be seated. My child get all
[52:07] three subjects. Fine. Are you feeling
[52:10] proud? I have a brand new car. I have a
[52:12] brand new this. I have a brand new that.
[52:14] Fine.
[52:16] Some people start up nice.
[52:19] They humble. They sharing. They giving.
[52:22] And after time they get greedy.
[52:25] They grow into a greedy spirit where all
[52:28] the eyes see. Yes, the heart want.
[52:34] Am I preaching to anybody here?
[52:37] There are people thief land. Kill this
[52:39] one to get inheritance. Do this and do
[52:41] that. All kind of foolishness. Why?
[52:44] Because that is all there is in the
[52:45] world.
[52:49] I feel like running here this morning.
[52:51] But when you overcome a loss of the
[52:54] eyes, that's why one of them brothers
[52:55] say, "I made a covenant with my eyes.
[52:58] Why should I look upon a maid?
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:03] It will always have young women. Amen.
[53:06] It will always have sex just women. No,
[53:08] none of them wearing burkers and all
[53:09] them Muslim gongs and everybody ain't
[53:11] wearing that.
[53:14] So you can't stop that on the streets,
[53:16] but you could shift your eyes.
[53:18] Hallelujah. You could reject that. You
[53:21] could have such a hungering for God that
[53:22] that doesn't bother you. You could raise
[53:24] past that. Yes. Because Jesus did
[53:28] it and you going to be like Jesus. Give
[53:32] the Lord a shout on that one.
[53:39] Glory. I feel that God is going to
[53:42] empower people inside of here. You will
[53:45] see the trials out there a little
[53:46] different. The Bible said, "Count it not
[53:49] strange that you fall into diverse
[53:52] temptations and trials and don't even
[53:53] count it strange." Oh God are going
[53:56] through a fight. What what is it
[53:57] supposed to go through? You sit down.
[54:01] In case you didn't know, this war we are
[54:04] in today didn't start on earth. It start
[54:08] in heaven. When Michael fought in the
[54:10] dragon fort because the dragon wanted to
[54:12] be worshiped. He was feeling a little
[54:13] thrownish. He was feeling a little
[54:16] upish. He should he want to be like
[54:18] goddish. And he wanted the angels to
[54:20] worship him. And Michael fought in the
[54:22] dragon fort. And he was kicked out. And
[54:24] brother Banham said the battle of angels
[54:26] became the battle of men. It fell on the
[54:29] earth. That is what happened in the
[54:31] garden of Eden. Oh, let's go back there
[54:33] and take a peek at what happened in the
[54:35] garden. Oh, hallelujah. Genesis chapter
[54:39] 3. If you want to turn your Bibles, find
[54:41] it. We're in the word this morning.
[54:43] Let's see what happened. Let's see the
[54:45] technique that the devil used and see if
[54:47] this is all that is in the world.
[54:49] Hallelujah. Honey, bombard eve. Let's
[54:51] see what happened back there. Oh, praise
[54:53] God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Genesis
[54:57] 3:1. Now the serpent was more subtle
[55:00] than any beast of the field which the
[55:01] Lord God had made. And he said unto the
[55:03] woman, "Yay, had God said, Ye shall not
[55:05] eat of every tree of the garden."
[55:09] So he gave a quote.
[55:11] He saw the print out. And the woman said
[55:14] unto the woman, "We may eat of the fruit
[55:16] of the trees of the garden, but of the
[55:18] fruit of the tree, which is in the midst
[55:21] of the
[55:22] garden." God had said, "Ye shall not eat
[55:24] of it, neither shall he touch it, least
[55:27] he die." And the serpent said unto the
[55:30] woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God
[55:34] do not know in the day you eat your
[55:38] eyes, here we go, shall be open, and ye
[55:41] shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
[55:45] Listen to how the Bible describe it.
[55:47] When the woman
[55:50] saw that the tree was good for food,
[55:56] that it was pleasant to the eyes.
[56:00] food, lust of the flesh, pleasant to the
[56:03] eyes, lust of the eyes, and a tree to be
[56:07] desired to make one
[56:10] wise, pride of life. She took the fruit
[56:13] thereof, did eat, give also unto her
[56:17] husband with her, and he did eat, and
[56:19] the eyes of them both were open, and
[56:21] they knew that they were naked, and they
[56:22] swed fig leaf together, and made
[56:24] themselves apron. And they heard the
[56:26] voice of the Lord walking the garden in
[56:28] the cool of the day. And Adam and his
[56:30] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[56:32] the Lord and among the trees of the
[56:34] garden. And the Lord called unto Adam
[56:36] and said unto him, "Where thou?" He
[56:37] said, "I heard thy voice in the garden.
[56:39] I was afraid." He because I was naked
[56:41] and I hid myself. He said, "Who told
[56:42] thou was naked?" Who told you that thou
[56:45] was naked? You may be seated. Oh, glory
[56:47] to God. But the point is this, because
[56:49] see, they were veiled with the Holy
[56:51] Ghost. Baron said the Holy Ghost was
[56:53] over them. They didn't know they were
[56:54] naked.
[56:56] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. You
[56:58] understand that they were really in the
[57:00] spirit.
[57:02] Hallelujah. They didn't know they were
[57:05] naked.
[57:07] So when the devil got Eve to break, then
[57:10] that veil fall off over them. Then they
[57:12] find itself hiding. Oh, hallelujah. So
[57:15] this lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh
[57:17] and pride of life is nothing new.
[57:20] It's all that is in the world. Oh,
[57:23] blessed be the name of the Lord. Can we
[57:24] go a little forward now? Oh, praise the
[57:26] name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise be
[57:29] to Jesus. So when that sacrifice is
[57:31] received by fire, it goes up like that
[57:34] and the smoke goes up and rise with your
[57:36] sacrifice into the heavenlies and you
[57:37] are sealed away from the things of the
[57:39] world. And when you are done, after you
[57:41] have died, what happened? You are
[57:43] conceived a new. You are conceived a
[57:45] new. You was first conceived in
[57:47] iniquity. Now you are conceived in
[57:49] something new. Amen. All of that is
[57:52] supernatural. Yeah. This is not
[57:54] education on educating you. This is
[57:56] something that you have to break into by
[57:57] the spirit of God. Isn't that right?
[58:00] Hallelujah. Watch. Where once you
[58:02] couldn't see that the word becomes alive
[58:04] in you, you begin to see things
[58:06] different. Where once you couldn't see
[58:08] that, now you do see it. There is
[58:10] something different now. Make all the
[58:11] scriptures come together. Make it dotail
[58:13] just right. You die to your own
[58:15] thinking. Now you are conceived new. You
[58:19] are washed with the water of the word.
[58:21] So in order to be born again, you got a
[58:23] new parent. You got a new nature. The
[58:25] old nature is dead. You got a new
[58:27] nature. You once was going one way, now
[58:30] you're going another way. You once was
[58:31] going this way. Then you set your
[58:33] affection on things above. Listen to
[58:35] that. Your affections is set to things
[58:37] above. Isn't that right? You don't love
[58:39] the things of the world no more. Your
[58:41] affection is of God. You don't care what
[58:43] man say, how they laugh at you, say your
[58:46] old model, whatever. You don't care
[58:48] because you are born of above and your
[58:50] affections on the things above. God is
[58:53] not ashamed of you and you are not
[58:55] ashamed of him. Oh, give the Lord some
[58:57] praises, people. Hallelujah. What kind
[59:01] of nature have you got then, brother
[59:02] Brandham? His nature. If I had my
[59:04] father's nature, I will do the things my
[59:06] father did. But now I'm born again. It
[59:08] depends upon who my father is. Oh,
[59:11] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[59:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[59:16] Praise God. So blessed are they that
[59:18] hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[59:21] Oh, glory to God. You can't be
[59:22] fornicating and adultery and unclean
[59:24] living and looking for adoption and
[59:26] looking to come into power and looking
[59:27] to return in power. No, it doesn't work
[59:29] that way. You have to get fire break
[59:31] upon your soul. You can't be a slacker
[59:34] and looking for power. The bride have to
[59:36] come back in power. If you're looking
[59:38] for power, you're looking to be
[59:39] cleansed. You're looking to be purified.
[59:41] You're looking for the process before
[59:42] you return to the power because somebody
[59:45] is coming back.
[59:49] Some son is going to come back with the
[59:52] power.
[59:54] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[59:57] Yes, we could preach new name. We could
[59:59] preach pray three or four. We could
[1:00:01] preach all kind of stuff. But unless we
[1:00:03] go through the process,
[1:00:05] that is just another thought,
[1:00:08] another sermon thought, another sermon
[1:00:11] idea. Hallelujah. In every age had
[1:00:14] overcomers. In every age had bite
[1:00:16] promises to him that overcome it. Not
[1:00:18] him that watchth, him that teacheth, him
[1:00:20] that learnth, him that overcome it.
[1:00:23] Overcome what? Lust of the eyes, lust of
[1:00:25] the flesh, and the pride of life. All
[1:00:27] that is in the world.
[1:00:33] In Luther, they didn't have the tattooed
[1:00:34] ones. Amen.
[1:00:38] And all these miniskirts and label
[1:00:40] outside that did not exist in Luther
[1:00:42] time, but it had loss of the eyes, loss
[1:00:45] of the flesh and the pride of life in
[1:00:46] Luther time. In Paul time, didn't have
[1:00:49] the wear they have now. Amen. It boxing
[1:00:52] worse and worse and have more worse to
[1:00:54] come. Come on y'all. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:00:58] to God. things will get worse. But we
[1:01:01] are still called to overcome.
[1:01:05] You may be seated. So knowing that
[1:01:07] there's the dreadest of the dread ages,
[1:01:11] it didn't have a age as evil as this
[1:01:12] one. God couldn't put in anybody.
[1:01:20] That is why we have a high calling.
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:27] Yeah.
[1:01:30] You may be seated. If I really sting
[1:01:32] inside of here, you
[1:01:35] I like that. Sting. Sting.
[1:01:37] But Brandham said an adoption. He could
[1:01:40] take your wife.
[1:01:43] He could cast in a bit of sickness.
[1:01:45] There's not no skin milk.
[1:01:49] He could take your children.
[1:01:51] [Applause]
[1:01:54] He could do whatever he wants to do.
[1:01:57] And what will be your testimony? God is
[1:02:01] angry with me. No,
[1:02:04] the Lord giveth. The Lord take it away.
[1:02:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:16] Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:19] [Applause]
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:22] Hallelujah. I see people hold on to
[1:02:23] things and see they lose all what they
[1:02:25] hold on to. because they're not giving
[1:02:27] it to God. They're just selfish. Seen
[1:02:30] about themselves, their family, all all
[1:02:32] their their business seen about. Only
[1:02:33] their business is seen about. That's all
[1:02:35] their business. I have nothing with God
[1:02:36] business. But we're going to read about
[1:02:38] this man called Elisha. But I'm saying
[1:02:40] take a vision to bring you to the will
[1:02:43] of God. And when you see the will of
[1:02:45] God, God will bless you and prosper you.
[1:02:47] I remember sometime some man had a
[1:02:49] calling to go Africa to missionary. And
[1:02:52] they went to the missionary board. They
[1:02:54] bring him before the missionary board
[1:02:56] and they say why you want to go there?
[1:02:57] You said the Lord is leading me to go
[1:02:58] there. They say it have um um diab uh um
[1:03:03] yellow fever, it have malaria, they call
[1:03:07] everything it have done in Africa
[1:03:10] because they can't understand why you
[1:03:11] want to he said the Lord lead him in
[1:03:13] there. You know he tell them if the Lord
[1:03:14] lead me the Lord to keep me there.
[1:03:18] Now if that man didn't have a genuine
[1:03:20] calling he could say so it have
[1:03:23] deterioria it have yellow fever where
[1:03:25] don't have yellow fever I could
[1:03:28] go now you see that that I could go that
[1:03:31] the Lord lead you know I am telling you
[1:03:33] something Lord lead among the lions the
[1:03:35] lion will lay down right by you and lie
[1:03:37] down and
[1:03:37] [Applause]
[1:03:40] quiet the Lord will lead you and
[1:03:43] something this no if God lead you the
[1:03:45] devil have to watch and can't touch.
[1:03:52] Look at brother man. I'm about to go on
[1:03:53] the plane. You know the story. And the
[1:03:56] Lord let him say, "Keep walking. Walk
[1:03:58] down the street. Walk down the street.
[1:03:59] Walk down the street." He go on a
[1:04:01] colored area. He's a white man. He walk
[1:04:02] in the coloring area. A woman outside
[1:04:04] waiting there. Good morning person.
[1:04:08] But I'm saying, "How you know I'm a
[1:04:09] person?" He said, "I was praying for God
[1:04:10] to send his Elijah." And God tell me,
[1:04:13] "Wait out here. He going to send me
[1:04:15] Elijah.
[1:04:21] No, no. She had a son that was very
[1:04:24] sick. Baram prayed, son got healed. And
[1:04:26] when he came back, final call.
[1:04:29] He said, "God kept the plane on the
[1:04:32] ground until this was done.
[1:04:40] You don't understand what we saying
[1:04:42] here. You You don't understand. You
[1:04:43] know, God will make traffic jam
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:04:49] to make sure this doesn't happen. God
[1:04:51] will make your neighbor move out the
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:58] community. God will promote that boss
[1:05:01] that giving you trouble, push them
[1:05:02] higher to leave you alone. Come
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:07] on. You don't understand who you are.
[1:05:11] Oh, no weapon
[1:05:16] form. As I heard a preacher say, "Your
[1:05:18] blessing could be delayed but not
[1:05:20] denied."
[1:05:22] Oh, give the Lord a shout of praise. Oh,
[1:05:25] glory to God. Can you hear me this
[1:05:27] morning? Your blessing could be delayed,
[1:05:31] but it cannot be
[1:05:33] denied. Oh, it belongs to the sons and
[1:05:36] daughters of the living God.
[1:05:44] Oh hallelujah.
[1:05:46] Glory.
[1:05:48] Glory to God.
[1:05:51] What is sanification? You may be seated.
[1:05:54] Sanification is the laboring part.
[1:05:57] That's the hard work. You are justified.
[1:06:00] You're already glorified. But
[1:06:02] sanctification is up to you. You're
[1:06:04] going to clean up. You're going to
[1:06:06] grown. You're going to say, "Lord, take
[1:06:08] this out of
[1:06:10] me. Send fire
[1:06:13] upon. You want to groan. You want to
[1:06:16] labor." Somebody say, "Labor."
[1:06:20] That is
[1:06:21] sanctification. The laboring part, the
[1:06:24] working part. Hallelujah. Working out
[1:06:27] your own salvation with fear and
[1:06:28] trembling.
[1:06:32] Oh, give the Lord a shout inside of
[1:06:34] here. You can't expect God to come and
[1:06:36] clean up your bedroom. You can't expect
[1:06:38] God to come and clean up your life. You
[1:06:40] may be seated. When they cross the land
[1:06:42] without enemies in the land that to
[1:06:44] fight to clean up the grounds, you can't
[1:06:47] expect God to cross the land and saints
[1:06:49] are coming down with some swords.
[1:06:52] Like if God come last to help cut down
[1:06:55] your land, you get a land that you
[1:06:59] didn't work for, you didn't buy, you
[1:07:01] didn't earn. All God said, clean it up.
[1:07:05] Get the demons out. Amen. Get the movies
[1:07:09] out. Whatever you listen, the Bible say
[1:07:11] your eye offend you, take it out. If
[1:07:13] your hand offend you, cut it off. That's
[1:07:15] how serious it is. Don't let nothing
[1:07:17] stop you from the kingdom. What shall it
[1:07:19] profit a man, he gain the own world and
[1:07:21] lose his own soul? You have everything.
[1:07:24] You have this, you have that, you have
[1:07:26] money in the bank, everything, and you
[1:07:27] lose your soul. Is it worth it?
[1:07:33] How many want to press this morning?
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:44] Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:07:49] Hallelujah.
[1:07:51] Oh, a sickening thing to see people 50
[1:07:54] something years old, 60 something years
[1:07:55] old and they still don't know 60
[1:07:57] something years old, 50 something years
[1:07:58] old. They're trying to go back in times.
[1:08:02] Hallelujah.
[1:08:05] They're trying to dress back in times.
[1:08:07] They're trying to even look back in
[1:08:09] times. Cut the hair. I give the 15 years
[1:08:12] younger. I call that custard second to
[1:08:15] last
[1:08:16] stand. After one more stand and bloop,
[1:08:20] gone. Is it worth it?
[1:08:23] Young people figure they young forever.
[1:08:25] But they smiling now. They have selfies
[1:08:27] to take. Let them keep on taking all the
[1:08:29] selfies. 15 selfie, 20 selfie, 30 you'll
[1:08:32] be selfie, 40 selfie, 50 selfie. See
[1:08:34] what you look like when you're 60. Take
[1:08:36] a
[1:08:39] selfie. You're not going to be young
[1:08:41] forever. Don't let the devil use your
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:45] beauty. Don't let the devil use your
[1:08:48] looks. Live for God because your looks
[1:08:52] is temporary.
[1:09:03] Hallelujah.
[1:09:05] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. So
[1:09:09] you're here to be transformed.
[1:09:11] Transformed for to hug to be a lamb.
[1:09:14] Transformed to be a sinner to be a
[1:09:15] saint. Not a sinner inside of here. Not
[1:09:18] an adulterer inside of here or fornicate
[1:09:20] inside of here. You're being transformed
[1:09:22] that your life could be come up right on
[1:09:24] target. We are here to press you to come
[1:09:26] into the order of the word. Hallelujah.
[1:09:29] Praise God. Hallelujah. Friend or
[1:09:32] friend. This word going to live. There
[1:09:35] is one place where death cannot strike.
[1:09:39] That's in the
[1:09:41] [Applause]
[1:09:43] word.
[1:09:45] Glory. The church is not the safety
[1:09:48] zone. The message is not the safety
[1:09:51] zone. The word is a safety zone. And
[1:09:54] once you in the word, that's why Jesus
[1:09:56] said heaven will pass away, but my word
[1:09:59] will never pass away. Once you in the
[1:10:01] word, the devil can't do you no harm.
[1:10:08] I'm telling,
[1:10:12] have you ever observed that the most
[1:10:13] people was healed and delivered in Jesus
[1:10:15] wasn't
[1:10:16] Christians?
[1:10:19] Was it wasn't believers? You sit down.
[1:10:21] Have you Have you noticed that? Amen.
[1:10:24] Amen. It had scribes and they had the
[1:10:27] big churches. It had Sadducees, the big
[1:10:29] churches. But Jesus, the people were
[1:10:31] healed, delivered, set free, come out of
[1:10:34] prison. There wasn't church people, you
[1:10:35] know.
[1:10:37] One time Jesus watching a man stand up,
[1:10:40] gain the offering. Next fellow outside
[1:10:43] the temple, man saying I am not like
[1:10:45] him.
[1:10:57] pride of life.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. So his comparison was him.
[1:11:04] I better than him. I have more money
[1:11:06] than him. I dress better than him. The
[1:11:08] man outside, Lord, I'm not worthy. Jesus
[1:11:11] said that man outside more righteous
[1:11:13] than that man inside.
[1:11:16] You see, every go by car and land and
[1:11:18] house and money. take take you out of
[1:11:20] it. Who have have here have you you're
[1:11:23] gone? But when you talk about the
[1:11:24] kingdom
[1:11:26] that's a different thing altogether.
[1:11:29] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] Young man came to Jesus. Good man. What
[1:11:33] shall I do to inherit eternal life?
[1:11:36] Bible say Jesus loved that man. Man have
[1:11:38] all the potentials. Man have all the
[1:11:40] skill set. Handsome looking man. The man
[1:11:43] just get it right. Man looking good.
[1:11:47] Suit matching his tie. tie matching his
[1:11:49] shoes, shoes matching his socks. But you
[1:11:52] know something was lacking. Jesus said,
[1:11:54] "Go and keep the commandments." He felt
[1:11:56] good. He had a word from the Lord.
[1:12:01] Amen. He said, "But master, I did this
[1:12:04] from all my youth."
[1:12:07] Amen. Jesus say one thing. One thing,
[1:12:10] just just one thing. Not not two things.
[1:12:14] Just just one thing. Amen. There's a
[1:12:16] demon of lust for money that I see
[1:12:18] inside your soul. And to get that demon
[1:12:21] out, you got to do something a little
[1:12:23] different. Just sell what you have. And
[1:12:26] that demon can't hold you. Just just
[1:12:28] give. Just Just sell it out. Sell it
[1:12:30] out. Sell it out. Sell it out. Sell it
[1:12:32] out. Sell it out. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:12:35] scream. Give the Lord a
[1:12:39] shout.
[1:12:41] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:43] [Applause]
[1:12:52] You want to be seated. The Bible said
[1:12:53] the man walk away sad
[1:12:56] because he couldn't let go. No, he was
[1:12:58] good outside. He had the books, he had
[1:13:00] the coats, he had the take. You listen
[1:13:02] to message every day. But the demon of
[1:13:04] the lust for money is us telling lust of
[1:13:06] the eyes, lust of the flesh, and the
[1:13:08] pride of life. That spirit
[1:13:13] didn't want to do what it needs to take
[1:13:15] to get rid of it. Some people worship
[1:13:17] the spirit upon them. They want people
[1:13:19] to accept them as they are. We say big
[1:13:21] fat no. God take you as you are, but
[1:13:23] you're not going to remain as you are.
[1:13:25] You're going to be transformed. Come on.
[1:13:27] You're going to be changed. You're going
[1:13:28] to be transfigured. You are not going to
[1:13:31] stay as you
[1:13:35] are. Amen.
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:43] You may be seated. Galatians 5 verse 16
[1:13:47] reads this. Then I say, walk in the
[1:13:48] spirit. Amen. And he shall not fulfill
[1:13:50] the lust of the flesh. For the flesh
[1:13:53] lusteth against the spirit, and the
[1:13:55] spirit against the flesh, and these are
[1:13:56] contrary to one to the other. So you
[1:13:59] cannot do the things that you would. But
[1:14:01] if you be led by the spirit, you're not
[1:14:03] under the law. Now the works of the
[1:14:06] flesh are manifest which are these and
[1:14:09] he labeled them adultery,
[1:14:12] fornication, uncleanness, lasiciousness,
[1:14:16] idolatry,
[1:14:18] witchcraft, hatred, variance,
[1:14:21] emilations, wrath, strife, seditions,
[1:14:24] heresies, envance, murders, drunkenness,
[1:14:31] reins. Amen. And such like of which I
[1:14:34] tell you before, I have told you in time
[1:14:36] past, they which do such things shall
[1:14:38] not inherit the kingdom of God under the
[1:14:41] lust of the flesh. All these things,
[1:14:43] witchcraft, hatred, and they in church,
[1:14:49] holdings and in church. Look at the
[1:14:51] story. He just gave a parable of a man
[1:14:52] who had a set of debts and so on. The
[1:14:55] king forgive him and then he had some
[1:14:57] friend who had 30 pounds or small pounds
[1:14:59] and he went lock the man neck again.
[1:15:01] Somebody report it. Amen. Drag him back
[1:15:04] in and say wait and go back inside until
[1:15:06] they pay all. I forgive you of your big
[1:15:09] debt. You go and squeeze a man for a
[1:15:10] small debt. Come on now. That's why say
[1:15:13] father forgive those as we forgive those
[1:15:15] who trespass against us. You are
[1:15:17] forgiven. If you don't want to release
[1:15:18] that person, God don't release you. God
[1:15:20] hold you to your sins. Somebody offend
[1:15:23] you. Somebody do you some stuff and you
[1:15:25] don't want to let it go. And God say if
[1:15:27] you don't let them go, I'm not going to
[1:15:28] let you go.
[1:15:30] I'm not hearing you. Preach back to me
[1:15:33] because this is how you're going to
[1:15:35] overcome. This is how you're going to
[1:15:37] get victory. It's got to be the
[1:15:46] word. Not our father praying, no guess.
[1:15:50] Give us this our daily bread. Isn't that
[1:15:52] right? Lead us not into temptation.
[1:15:55] Deliver us from all evil. For thine is
[1:15:56] the kingdom, the power of glory. You
[1:15:58] know small prayer. Is Christ himself
[1:16:00] prayed that? Hallelujah. Because
[1:16:02] forgiveness is where the death is really
[1:16:03] at. In this age, that's why it's hell on
[1:16:07] the earth. That's why it's so much
[1:16:08] discord among brethren. That's why
[1:16:10] people separated by doctrine.
[1:16:12] Hallelujah. Because it's not Christ in
[1:16:14] their hearts. It's other things in their
[1:16:16] hearts. But the prophet saw the bride
[1:16:18] with the blood upon her of the age, upon
[1:16:22] her chest. Therefore, brotherly kindness
[1:16:25] will be manifested, will be displayed.
[1:16:28] Not temporary kindness.
[1:16:32] Not loving those who love you.
[1:16:35] Not liking those who you like and who
[1:16:38] like you. That's foolishness.
[1:16:42] You may be seated. Praise God.
[1:16:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't have
[1:16:46] to say amen. You can
[1:16:49] that don't mean nothing. God not even
[1:16:51] hearing that. The angel not even
[1:16:52] recognizing that. You better say amen if
[1:16:55] this is the word.
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:00] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:17:03] Forgiveness is a powerful thing. Even
[1:17:05] Jesus had demonstrated it.
[1:17:09] Bunch of people born crucify him.
[1:17:11] Crucify him. Crucify him. You think nice
[1:17:13] to hear that? All the camera snapping
[1:17:15] all the people recording and they taking
[1:17:18] you all the crowds around you. Crucify
[1:17:21] him. Crucify him. People don't even know
[1:17:23] you. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] Now, it's not the sinner man who Jesus
[1:17:28] healed and cast the devils out and raise
[1:17:30] the dead. It's not them who was doing
[1:17:31] that, you know.
[1:17:33] It's those religious people.
[1:17:37] Legion had demons. Legion wasn't a
[1:17:40] believer in church occupying some church
[1:17:43] pew. He was in the caves and he pressed
[1:17:46] his way to ask for mercy.
[1:17:50] He pushed past the other 999 devils upon
[1:17:53] him. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:57] 900 is a,000 devils in my head. And he
[1:18:00] push he pushed past that.
[1:18:03] [Applause]
[1:18:06] So don't tell me you don't have a you
[1:18:09] and the devil made me do it. I didn't
[1:18:12] want to do it, but the devil made me do.
[1:18:14] Don't give me that. Come on. Cheat.
[1:18:17] Hallelujah. Legion pressed his
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:23] way. And because he cared, Jesus cared.
[1:18:28] And he was set free. He was set free.
[1:18:32] And those wicked spirits wanted to do
[1:18:34] some more damage. They say, "Send us
[1:18:36] into the pigs." Hallelujah. The pigs
[1:18:38] went off the cliff. They went crazy. You
[1:18:41] may be seated. That's what them demons
[1:18:44] want you to do. Go crazy. Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] demons. Thursday night we had some
[1:18:49] powerful service Thursday night where we
[1:18:51] talking about people don't understand
[1:18:52] the battle is not flesh and blood.
[1:18:54] People forget this principal and people
[1:18:56] forget that they're so natural in the
[1:18:59] flesh. This brother, this sister, you're
[1:19:01] not seeing the devil himself and a bunch
[1:19:03] of hims all around him loosed against
[1:19:06] your house, loosed against your family.
[1:19:08] And we are seeing when the enemy coming
[1:19:10] like a flood, the spirit of God raise a
[1:19:13] standard
[1:19:21] You know much stuff come against this
[1:19:23] church. But we were standing everything
[1:19:25] we have to because we're here to fight
[1:19:27] back.
[1:19:29] We're here to give in. We here to fight
[1:19:31] right back.
[1:19:36] I almost let go. Almost give up. Almost.
[1:19:40] Yes. I almost give up. Yes. I was that
[1:19:44] close. But when I understand, when I
[1:19:46] begin to understand that is what the
[1:19:48] devil want, I said, "No
[1:19:51] way. No way. I am not going to give in
[1:19:56] to no demon, to no devil spirit. I'm
[1:20:00] going to fight for what is right. Fight
[1:20:04] for a church clean up. Fight for a
[1:20:07] revival. Fight for the offices to be in
[1:20:10] order.
[1:20:11] I'm going to fight. If you're out of
[1:20:14] position, we'll put you in position. If
[1:20:16] we have to sit you down, we will sit you
[1:20:18] down. We're going to change things
[1:20:20] inside of here. There's going to be a
[1:20:22] church set in order. You know why? The
[1:20:25] church must be in order to cross Jordan.
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:35] Church must be in order to cross Jordan.
[1:20:40] Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] Roll Jordan roll.
[1:20:47] Roll Jordan roll.
[1:20:51] I want to go to heaven when I die. So
[1:20:56] roll Jordan and roll. Oh hallelujah.
[1:21:00] Give the Lord some praises
[1:21:07] people. Brother Brandham statue of
[1:21:10] perfect man. Lust for money. Amen. Lust
[1:21:13] for big things. Amen. Lust for
[1:21:15] popularity. Hallelujah. These things are
[1:21:17] death to the believer. We don't care.
[1:21:19] Tent or cottage. Why should I care? Live
[1:21:23] or die. Here we go. Sink or drown. This
[1:21:26] is the thing I'm interested in. The
[1:21:30] kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Whether I
[1:21:32] maintain my home, whether I maintain my
[1:21:36] family, whatever I maintain, whatever it
[1:21:39] is, let me maintain Christ,
[1:21:42] the hope of glory. That is what the
[1:21:44] church supposed to be fighting for. For
[1:21:47] Christ.
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:50] I'm not asking to fight for this group,
[1:21:52] you know. That's why I don't f your head
[1:21:53] with nonsense. That's right.
[1:21:58] All the tapes on the internet. See, if
[1:22:00] I'm preaching foolishness and telling
[1:22:01] about this and back analysis and
[1:22:03] nonsense, trying to twist your mind and
[1:22:04] twist your head. I'm not doing that.
[1:22:07] People are free inside of here. I love
[1:22:10] freedom and I am free to tell you the
[1:22:14] truth
[1:22:15] because only the truth will set you
[1:22:17] free. No excuses.
[1:22:21] [Applause]
[1:22:26] Some of the truth got nice. Thank you,
[1:22:28] Jesus. True. But is the truth?
[1:22:31] Amen. Hallelujah. Some truth doesn't be
[1:22:34] tasty, but it's the truth. Isn't that
[1:22:37] right? But that is what set people free.
[1:22:40] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Give
[1:22:43] the Lord a shout for that, man.
[1:22:50] Amen. Build me up, oh Lord, into this.
[1:22:53] Hallelujah. Let Christ be my head.
[1:22:56] Hallelujah. working through me on my
[1:22:58] foundation, my faith. Let virtue,
[1:23:01] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:23:04] godliness, and brotherly kindness work
[1:23:06] in me. Oh Lord, is my prayer. I don't
[1:23:10] care. Live or die. Sink or drown,
[1:23:14] denomination or no denomination, friend
[1:23:17] or no friend, let that work in me. Let
[1:23:21] Christ's virtue, his knowledge flow out
[1:23:24] that I might be able to teach those for
[1:23:27] God has set in the church. Apostles,
[1:23:31] prophets, teachers, pastors,
[1:23:34] evangelists, all for all for all for the
[1:23:39] perfecting. Amen. And bringing these
[1:23:43] virtues into it to that perfection of
[1:23:45] the coming of the son of God. He said,
[1:23:48] "Let virtue flow out." Hallelujah. You
[1:23:50] got to have it for it to flow out. How
[1:23:52] could the virtue come into the people if
[1:23:54] the minister don't have the virtue? Come
[1:23:57] on now. Come on now. When you write with
[1:23:58] me, this is the word now. How could the
[1:24:01] virtue flow if the minister don't have
[1:24:03] it? He have to have it to give it.
[1:24:08] And to get to get it, there's only one
[1:24:10] place to get it.
[1:24:14] Cross Jordan. Oh, glory to God.
[1:24:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So what's your
[1:24:19] prayer? Kill him.
[1:24:23] Hallelujah. Let me hear that. You got to
[1:24:26] say, Lord, that man, kill him.
[1:24:30] You all afraid to say amen or
[1:24:35] you don't want the man here alive. You
[1:24:37] say want it dead. I am not here. You
[1:24:39] should be screaming inside of here.
[1:24:42] Not dead or alive, you know. No. No. You
[1:24:45] want him dead. You want a dead man come
[1:24:48] behind his death. Dead men.
[1:24:51] You want the song leader dead and all
[1:24:55] because when he sing you get now singing
[1:24:58] in the spirit. Not just singing because
[1:25:00] he could sing. You have a gift to sing.
[1:25:02] Anybody could have a gift to sing. But
[1:25:04] you have to be in the spirit. You want
[1:25:07] the musicians to be dead.
[1:25:10] Anybody with hands could play piano with
[1:25:13] hands could pick guitar and bass. But
[1:25:15] when they in the
[1:25:17] spirit, I'm not hearing you. We want the
[1:25:21] believers to be
[1:25:23] dead. Anybody can come to church, but
[1:25:26] when you are dead, Christ is alive. Pill
[1:25:29] fire in the building, the sick is
[1:25:31] healed, the blind is seeing, the deaf is
[1:25:35] hearing, sin casting in the
[1:25:43] church.
[1:25:44] Glory. Let's cross Jordan.
[1:25:51] Glory.
[1:25:54] You may be seated. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:25:57] God. Hallelujah. Paul a prisoner. God is

[1:26:56] [Applause]
[1:26:58] confronting the lust of the eyes, the
[1:27:00] lust of the flesh, and the pride of
[1:27:02] life. And when Jesus finished, Satan had
[1:27:05] a blue eye
[1:27:07] because Jesus dropped it on him. and
[1:27:10] walked out the
[1:27:12] wilderness. Oh, same as simple.

[1:28:52] I don't feel I never I've never been in
[1:28:54] Israel. I never see Jordan. Why do you
[1:28:55] think it's a pretty river? You
[1:28:58] know, cuz
[1:29:01] when I remember when the man who was had
[1:29:04] leprosy and Elijah said, "Go and dip
[1:29:05] seven times." He say, "Isn't there any
[1:29:08] better water?
[1:29:12] I have a swimming pool behind my house.
[1:29:14] I could dip there seven times. I could
[1:29:16] dig 14 times in my swimming pool behind
[1:29:17] my house. But but that's all they were
[1:29:19] doing. Dipping 14 times."
[1:29:21] Elijah said that river
[1:29:24] not your river, that river seven times.
[1:29:29] Oh, glory. Hallelujah.

[1:30:00] "Master, I went and at a church service,
[1:30:03] I got the Holy Ghost." The master say,
[1:30:05] "I want the Holy Ghost, too." He say,
[1:30:06] "You want it? Come." Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] The master followed him. Amen. He went
[1:30:12] on to the pigsty where stink and stinky

[1:30:17] master come over here. I I can go. He

[1:30:23] But when you're ready for it, you don't
[1:30:24] care. You just don't care. Or give the
[1:30:29] Lord a scream inside of here. When you
[1:30:32] are ready for your breakthrough, when

[1:40:46] That's right. Amen. The elders want him
[1:40:48] to wait until Jordan get down low.
[1:40:51] Jordan was high, but God want to show he
[1:40:54] is God.
[1:40:56] Joshua told them in 3 days we are
[1:41:00] crossing over. Joshua told them come not
[1:41:03] near to your wife. Joshua told them
[1:41:07] sanctify yourself because God is about
[1:41:09] to do wonders among us. Joshua had
[1:41:12] instructions for them to set their homes
[1:41:15] in order to set their hearts in order to
[1:41:18] set their lives in order because the
[1:41:21] supernatural is about to break forth.

[1:41:46] Brother Brandham
[1:41:48] praying a message trying to do God a
[1:41:51] service without it being God's will.
[1:41:53] He said how we thank you Lord. Yes sir.
[1:41:55] As we set in this solemn moment. Yes
[1:41:57] sir. Almost like a funeral. For we are
[1:42:00] facing the burial of a dying world.
[1:42:02] Hallelujah. A dying dead church. Oh God.
[1:42:05] Gather your weak quickly. Oh God. Father
[1:42:08] come quickly. Lord Jesus. Bless thy
[1:42:10] people. Father bring sincerity and
[1:42:13] deepness to the hearts of the people.
[1:42:15] May we get off off those fragile bubble
[1:42:17] dances and settle down the deep riches
[1:42:20] of the honey of God.
[1:42:21] Grant it Lord. Keep our hearts
[1:42:23] established with love and sincerity.
[1:42:27] Bless thy people everywhere. And as we
[1:42:29] leave this place, may we go in the name
[1:42:31] of the Lord to speak what is sincere,
[1:42:34] what is truth, which is right, may we
[1:42:37] shun what is wrong, Lord. When a man
[1:42:39] begins to lie on us, may we quickly turn
[1:42:42] our back upon him. Turn our back to all
[1:42:44] the dirty, filthy jokes and the things
[1:42:47] of the world and just turn our back and
[1:42:49] walk away. Help us dear God. Mold us,
[1:42:53] make us, break us, make us into the
[1:42:56] images of sons and daughters of God that
[1:42:59] we might act with the virtue of the Holy
[1:43:01] Spirit. We commit ourselves to you in
[1:43:05] Jesus name.
[1:43:07] Oh hallelujah.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah.
[1:43:11] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:43:13] Praise God. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:43:17] Brother Brenham, redemption has two
[1:43:19] parts. Coming out of and going into and
[1:43:23] the book of Joshua is the book of
[1:43:25] Ephesians of the Old Testament. Amen.
[1:43:27] You got to come out of the world to
[1:43:29] enter into Christ. You got to come out
[1:43:31] of unbelief to enter into faith. There
[1:43:34] cannot be one thing in your way to
[1:43:36] really have genuine faith. You must
[1:43:38] absolutely leave everything that's
[1:43:40] contrary to the word of God. To enter
[1:43:43] into faith. Hallelujah. And the book of
[1:43:45] the Ephesians, the Old Testament is
[1:43:46] Joshua. Now we find out, here we go,
[1:43:48] that we have come to another Ephesians,
[1:43:51] another Ephesus. Now, where here we go,
[1:43:54] in our intellectual denomination and so
[1:43:57] forth, all our educational program has
[1:44:00] come to it Jordan.
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:05] People try to have conventions, gather
[1:44:06] together and everything else. It comes
[1:44:08] Jordan. It come to a dead t. Watch.
[1:44:14] We must have an Ephesians again. Yes,
[1:44:16] sir. We must have an exodus to come out
[1:44:19] and go into the rapture.
[1:44:22] Paradox. The book is sealed with seven
[1:44:23] mysterious seals. Amen. Revelation 10,
[1:44:26] we find out that the loudest last
[1:44:29] messenger of the last age. Here we go.
[1:44:31] During the time of his prophecy, that
[1:44:33] the seven seals will be open and the
[1:44:36] seven mysteries, the seven mysteries
[1:44:37] that have been left off. In every age,
[1:44:40] some have been left off. The reformer
[1:44:42] didn't have time to take care of it. In
[1:44:44] days of Luther, he preached a conviction
[1:44:46] by faith. He was gone. They made a
[1:44:48] church. Where's the preonification?
[1:44:49] Along came the Pentecostals. But we are
[1:44:51] promised.
[1:44:53] Now we come with the promises. So we're
[1:44:55] not giving you information, we're giving
[1:44:57] you promises. And Peter said, by these
[1:44:59] promises, you become partakers of his
[1:45:02] divine nature. Not by information, by by
[1:45:05] promises. So we are going to drop a
[1:45:06] promise on you. Snatch it, pull it down.
[1:45:09] We're going to give you a promise. You
[1:45:11] may be seated. We are promised according
[1:45:14] to Revelation 10, according to Malachi
[1:45:17] 4, according to Luke 17:30. There's got
[1:45:21] to come an Ephesians to this.
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:25] Now, the Bible says Ephesus, Mr. Titar,
[1:45:27] and so forth of the Ludicia. But he is
[1:45:30] saying the devil don't know this. This
[1:45:32] is the mystery that imagine in loud say
[1:45:35] age there's going to come another
[1:45:37] emphasis in other words I'm alpha
[1:45:41] and I'm omega and the processes in
[1:45:44] between what the early church had we
[1:45:47] going to have plus
[1:45:51] you heard what I'm saying we don't want
[1:45:54] nothing less
[1:45:57] we don't want to be a higher Pentecostal
[1:46:00] church then
[1:46:02] We want to be what Ephesus was.
[1:46:05] Alpha church, omega church. The
[1:46:08] authority Peter had must come back.
[1:46:16] Paul Paul was the gold standard of
[1:46:18] messengers. But around got the other
[1:46:20] messengers by measuring him against
[1:46:21] Paul. That's why when the voice tell
[1:46:23] him, he said, "Will Paul be judged?"
[1:46:24] They say, "You ought to be judged." He
[1:46:25] said, "Was Paul judged?" When he broke
[1:46:27] under the other side, he said, "Yes,
[1:46:30] Paul judge and you ought to be judged."
[1:46:31] He said, "Well, I preach what Paul
[1:46:32] preached."
[1:46:35] But I'm ask the right question. Was Paul
[1:46:37] judge? Yeah, Paul was judged, but I
[1:46:39] preach what Paul preached, but I want to
[1:46:41] have the same testimony. I have preached
[1:46:43] my own stuff. I preach what Paul
[1:46:45] preached. My God, there's going to be a
[1:46:47] Holy Ghost revival. I will preach that
[1:46:50] till I die or get raptured in the sky.
[1:46:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's going to
[1:46:57] be a real
[1:46:58] revival. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:47:03] What? What if God didn't make the
[1:47:05] opportunity for Samson? You may be
[1:47:06] seated. What if Samson die a old man
[1:47:10] dead and a tombstone there still dead?
[1:47:14] Just die old. And then somebody write a
[1:47:17] little book what Samson used to be. The
[1:47:21] history of Samson and all what God used
[1:47:23] him for. Yeah, that might sound real
[1:47:25] nice. But God didn't finish Samson
[1:47:27] story. So Samson know is dead now or
[1:47:29] dead later. Are you choosing dead now?
[1:47:34] But before I finish do this dead thing,
[1:47:37] I want to do God thing. I want to
[1:47:39] fulfill the will that I was raised up
[1:47:42] for. Which is to destroy the
[1:47:44] Philistines. So in their human spirit,
[1:47:47] human when they thought was
[1:47:48] entertainment time. Yeah. when they put
[1:47:51] on the entertainment channel and they
[1:47:53] say bring on Samson. He is the movie
[1:47:55] movie coming out now entertainment
[1:47:57] vision or station or something. So and
[1:47:59] they bring out Samson. Samson wasn't in
[1:48:00] that mood with him.
[1:48:03] Samson had different vision all
[1:48:04] together. Without eyes he was seeing you
[1:48:06] not hearing.
[1:48:10] Did you hear that? It are people who are
[1:48:13] eyes and they can't see because you
[1:48:15] don't see with your eyes. You already
[1:48:16] see with your heart. Samson saw God
[1:48:19] getting honor and glory. Samson saw the
[1:48:22] restoration of the glory of God back
[1:48:25] among God's
[1:48:27] [Applause]
[1:48:29] people where he was where he failed. He
[1:48:32] was going to do so much honor. He going
[1:48:33] to bring honor and glory to
[1:48:34] God. So Samson Samson coming out and
[1:48:38] they start to entertain started to clap.
[1:48:39] Yeah. Yeah. Samson all foolishness. Sam
[1:48:42] said the fellow lead me to the post.
[1:48:45] What if Samson was arrogant? I know what
[1:48:47] a pride of life. I want a little boy.
[1:48:48] Little boy, leave me alone. Don't touch
[1:48:50] me. Walk for myself.
[1:48:55] Then Samson walk by himself in the
[1:48:56] middle of the field cuz he want a little
[1:48:58] boy lead him. And hallelujah. Send the
[1:49:00] power and power came upon Samson fall on
[1:49:03] the ground. Sam get back out.
[1:49:09] What is that? How how that work out?
[1:49:11] What what story is that? You have to be
[1:49:13] humble. Amen. You have to really
[1:49:15] overcome. Samson had to tell the little
[1:49:18] boy, "Lead me." Come on now. Jesus say,
[1:49:21] "You're young now. You when you get old,
[1:49:22] you would lead. You get led where you
[1:49:23] don't want to go." And I know some of
[1:49:25] you don't want to go where we going this
[1:49:26] morning because you hear about Jordan,
[1:49:28] hear about the cross, you hear about
[1:49:30] Calvary. I have a bum for you. You know,
[1:49:32] say the dynamics must drive the people
[1:49:33] to Calvary and then to the rapture.
[1:49:37] Let me drop that bomb on you one time.
[1:49:38] Take that. Take that. If you could hold
[1:49:40] that. The dynamics going to strike the
[1:49:42] people and drive them to what? Spoken
[1:49:44] word. When you speak the word, when the
[1:49:45] press come down and you're looking for
[1:49:46] the press. Yeah. Look for the press. But
[1:49:48] before the press,
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:54] one brother, one minister say he revival
[1:49:57] is gone. He's looking for the press to
[1:49:58] come down. Amen. Lord Jesus. You're
[1:50:03] looking for the press to come down.
[1:50:04] That's right. Looking for for the press.
[1:50:05] Lord Jesus. I tell you some people go
[1:50:08] out here.
[1:50:10] True. Amen. They only read about golad
[1:50:12] in the Bible. They may see the golad
[1:50:14] coming for the life yet. Know how big is
[1:50:17] they going say whoa. Yeah. Because the
[1:50:21] whole of Israel was paralyzed, you know.
[1:50:23] By golad, not by the armies of the not
[1:50:26] by them armies and just golad alone and
[1:50:29] say send me a man and nobody have the
[1:50:31] size to deal with God. You could pump
[1:50:34] how much iron? You're still small
[1:50:36] compared to Golad. Amen. You could be
[1:50:38] skilled for man, the best for in the
[1:50:40] country because Saul offered them money.
[1:50:42] Saul even offered them his daughter,
[1:50:45] money, popularity, woman, loss of the
[1:50:48] eyes, loss of the flesh, pride of life,
[1:50:52] whatever you want. Them fell say no way.
[1:50:55] Keep keep your daughter, keep your
[1:50:58] money, keep your popularity. I stay
[1:51:02] saint and sober and alive. Ask people to
[1:51:06] be single and free
[1:51:09] than to be a toast for the devil.
[1:51:12] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:51:17] Amen. What happened? God lose something
[1:51:19] different. God lose something. A
[1:51:22] different kind of opponent. Amen. When
[1:51:24] Golad come
[1:51:27] dup David could run. David David
[1:51:30] spritly.
[1:51:31] David could duck. David could move. Glad
[1:51:34] so heavy about doop. You could mark his
[1:51:36] step. Boop boop. You could watch him in
[1:51:38] a straight line. Come on now. He have no
[1:51:40] running to run. That's
[1:51:43] why. That's why God put our feet the way
[1:51:45] it is. We could run, man. Oh, come on
[1:51:49] now. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Why you
[1:51:52] think God bringing wine to give you
[1:51:53] stimulation of revelation for you to get
[1:51:56] excited about his kingdom, excited about
[1:51:58] the gospel? You can't sit here like if
[1:52:00] it's a club.
[1:52:05] Do you understand that Paul that that
[1:52:07] Irene and Martin they didn't know what
[1:52:09] you know it wasn't revealed to them
[1:52:15] you are blessed
[1:52:17] to be in this age of course is hell
[1:52:24] [Applause]
[1:52:26] but as we didn't say amen on that one in
[1:52:29] case you didn't know the lid of hell has
[1:52:31] been uncovered
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:34] That never happened no other age.
[1:52:39] So you know what God take? God say
[1:52:41] Satan, open up hell. Loose hell on the
[1:52:44] earth. I go loose my bride on the earth.
[1:52:47] You don't know who she is yet.
[1:52:52] But one day when she pass through the
[1:52:55] lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh,
[1:52:59] pride of life, she'll return in power.
[1:53:02] You're going to know who is the bride
[1:53:04] then.
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:09] You may be seated. Let me tell it to you
[1:53:12] flat. No other age the hell has been
[1:53:15] uncovered. That's right.
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:19] Lord,
[1:53:22] no other age angels came from eternity.
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:36] God has sent angel of eternity.
[1:53:38] That's why this cloud is here.
[1:53:45] Is a sign the battle has resumed.
[1:53:52] Come on, give the Lord a shout. We are
[1:53:55] not backing down. We are not going to
[1:53:58] back down. The battle is on. The battle
[1:54:02] is raging this morning. But somebody
[1:54:05] going to be
[1:54:06] delivered. Someone going to be set
[1:54:08] [Applause]
[1:54:21] free. Hurry. You may be seated.
[1:54:25] Okay. Watch. We are promised. Going to
[1:54:28] Revelation 10, Malachi 4. Luke 17 that
[1:54:31] they're going to come at Ephesians to
[1:54:32] this. There's promise it friends. There
[1:54:35] must come an Ephesians that these
[1:54:40] sevenfold mysteries of the word of God
[1:54:41] must be unfolded. Amen. And it is in the
[1:54:44] loud eastern age this takes place. And I
[1:54:46] believe we are right in the shadows of
[1:54:48] the coming of the son of God. Here we
[1:54:50] go. And as Joshua just before that
[1:54:53] Ephesians raised up, so did John the
[1:54:56] Baptist raised up just before the next
[1:54:57] Ephesians. And we are promised another
[1:55:01] Ephesians. And it is predicted here in
[1:55:04] the scripture. Therefore, I think we are
[1:55:07] living in the Ephesians again.
[1:55:09] Hallelujah. Therefore, we know that
[1:55:12] Luther couldn't get to it. Wesley and so
[1:55:14] forth. But in the last days, we are
[1:55:17] given the understanding by the word that
[1:55:19] we are going to understand it because
[1:55:22] there will come an Ephesians 8 to it.
[1:55:25] And I believe he is just as able this
[1:55:27] afternoon to cause in this building a
[1:55:29] paradox because he promised it would
[1:55:32] happen. Now brother is saying this under
[1:55:34] a this is called paradox and the word
[1:55:37] paradox means incredible
[1:55:40] but true. I love that. So in paradox he
[1:55:45] is prophesying of another Ephesians.
[1:55:48] It's incredible but true. It have hell
[1:55:52] on the earth, but they going to be
[1:55:54] Ephesians. It have slackers on the
[1:55:56] earth, but there going to be Ephesians.
[1:55:58] It have lukewarm and more back church
[1:56:00] members in the church, but there's going
[1:56:02] to be another Ephesians. It have
[1:56:04] backsliding preachers, but there's going
[1:56:05] to be another Ephesians.
[1:56:08] [Applause]
[1:56:11] Are you with me? In other words, when
[1:56:14] the devil eat the stump of the tree
[1:56:16] right now and God say, "I will restore."
[1:56:18] The devil have no promise to return to
[1:56:20] stump time.
[1:56:22] When God said to push up that tree, the
[1:56:25] devil can't say, "I feel eatish again.
[1:56:27] He done eat it up already. He's full. He
[1:56:30] has nothing more to eat. This is our
[1:56:32] time. We are now beginning to push up.
[1:56:35] We are now beginning to stretch our
[1:56:37] wings. We are now beginning to exercise
[1:56:40] the
[1:56:41] faith. Hallelujah. That God has released
[1:56:44] in our souls.
[1:56:48] Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[1:56:52] You may be seasoned. Hallelujah. What
[1:56:54] are you talking about, Belove? When you
[1:56:56] leave here, you must be expecting
[1:56:57] miracles in your home,
[1:57:00] in your life. You expecting the same old
[1:57:03] thing. You're expecting something
[1:57:04] blessed. You're expecting something new.
[1:57:07] You're expecting something inspiring to
[1:57:08] come to your life. Come on. You expect
[1:57:10] the doctors to say the tumor is not
[1:57:12] there. Yeah. Yeah. expecting the doctor
[1:57:15] to say thing cancelled. Can't find what
[1:57:18] he find last week. X-ray had a wrong
[1:57:20] reading. Something wrong with the
[1:57:22] machine. Oh, glory to God. That's what
[1:57:24] we talking about. Glory to God. We
[1:57:26] expect humors right now to be dissolving
[1:57:29] right now. Like we put
[1:57:31] up dissolve in Jesus name. Come on.
[1:57:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:57:37] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:57:41] Arthritis, back pain, diabetes. We
[1:57:43] expect these things to be changing.
[1:57:48] You may be seated. How could we have
[1:57:50] faith for the rapture and we got faith
[1:57:51] for healing? When the rapture is a is a
[1:57:53] is a is a glorified divine healing
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:01] the rapture is like a glorified divine
[1:58:03] healing. What do you think divine
[1:58:04] healing is? It's just that divine
[1:58:06] healing. You have cancer, you have
[1:58:08] leukemia, whatever it is, and God heal
[1:58:10] you miraculously. Doctor check you up,
[1:58:11] check your machine and whatnot. They pay
[1:58:13] how much thousands of millions for the
[1:58:14] machine and let the machine going wrong.
[1:58:16] Machine seen wrong after a while. Not
[1:58:18] the machine seeing it wrong, God seen it
[1:58:19] right. God correct that inside of you.
[1:58:22] High blood pressure normal. Oh, glory to
[1:58:25] God. In them Pentecostal age, listen,
[1:58:28] you should sit down on the platform. Sit
[1:58:31] down on the platform and pull people
[1:58:32] foot out.
[1:58:34] Straighten people foot out. Pray until
[1:58:36] the eyes pop open. They were rugged men
[1:58:39] of faith. You know the devil had was
[1:58:41] blows was licks you know. Oh hallelujah.
[1:58:44] It was just divine healing. You know the
[1:58:47] son of man arising with healing his
[1:58:48] wings. You know was real campaign you
[1:58:51] know thousands and thousands being
[1:58:53] healed. You know
[1:58:56] [Applause]
[1:58:59] be seated. And like Jesus time a lot of
[1:59:02] people healed wasn't even church people.
[1:59:04] That's right. That's right.
[1:59:08] People come from far coming to the
[1:59:10] Brandham um campaign and outside in the
[1:59:13] yard hours and hours before they can't
[1:59:15] get in the building only we hours in the
[1:59:17] morning. People they camping out had no
[1:59:20] air condition and thing you know camping
[1:59:22] out waiting for doors to open waiting to
[1:59:25] get a prayer card because you have a
[1:59:27] need that the doctor can handle. This is
[1:59:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:59:32] and forever. Will we have a campaign?
[1:59:35] Will a campaign come back where the sick
[1:59:37] is being healed? Where people calling
[1:59:39] for church? Where we don't even have
[1:59:41] church? People lining up downstairs to
[1:59:44] get into the building because Jesus is
[1:59:46] in the
[1:59:50] building. We can have it. That's not
[1:59:53] even a hard
[1:59:54] thing. Come on now. Because it was here
[1:59:58] before in the days of the prophet. You
[2:00:01] be seated. Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[2:00:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Second yourself
[2:00:06] now. I'm not finished. You may be
[2:00:09] seated. Oh, glory to God. Don't even

[2:00:13] front. Look at the to close. I'm not

[2:00:23] tension right now. I like a bend back
[2:00:26] bow. Hallelujah. Oh, give the Lord our
[2:00:29] shout inside of here.

[2:00:39] a breakthrough. You come here for
[2:00:40] revival. You come here for deliverance.
[2:00:42] You come here to have great
[2:00:43] expectations.
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:53] Glory.
[2:00:55] Oh. How them pay taxes. Jesus say go and
[2:00:58] catch a fish. What fish have to do with
[2:01:01] taxes? Human business.
[2:01:05] If you don't believe Jesus, you see what
[2:01:07] kind of man is that? Go catch a fish.
[2:01:11] You don't want to catch the fish and
[2:01:12] clean the fish. You have to clean the
[2:01:13] fish. Do you know
[2:01:15] cut the fish, the coin inside the fish
[2:01:18] fish the fish m the coin right there to
[2:01:20] pay taxes. God have a way of doing
[2:01:22] things so contrary. That's what I love
[2:01:24] about him. God could have waited till
[2:01:26] the river went down for there to wait
[2:01:28] across Jordan. Amen. But they say tell
[2:01:30] it to your children how them stones get
[2:01:32] there. Tell them that we march and we
[2:01:35] touch Jordan. Them fellas put when they
[2:01:37] touch the river Jordan open up. Put 12
[2:01:41] stones there. And when your children ask
[2:01:42] how them stones get there, tell them
[2:01:45] tell them. Tell them the Lord open up
[2:01:50] Jordan and we walk on dry ground and we
[2:01:53] put them 12 stones
[2:01:56] there. Hallelujah.
[2:01:59] You must have something to tell them.
[2:02:02] Tell the critics. Tell your haters. Tell
[2:02:05] the people who don't believe. God going
[2:02:08] to give you a testimony to tell them.
[2:02:11] Oh, give the Lord some praises people.
[2:02:14] Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:02:16] [Applause]
[2:02:20] Hallelujah. Bible say we are good seven
[2:02:23] ages. We are promised. Here we are. that
[2:02:26] at the la recent church age there would
[2:02:28] be another Ephesians. Yes sir.
[2:02:32] Now only a prophet could bring that. But
[2:02:34] what will produce this Ephesians? What's
[2:02:36] going to bring it? You hear this? What
[2:02:39] happened upon Sunset Mountain? God
[2:02:41] confirming his word. That's what this
[2:02:43] noise is about. What's all this noise
[2:02:45] about? God fulfilling his promised word
[2:02:47] again of Revelation 10 1-7. In the days
[2:02:50] of the sounding of the seven angels
[2:02:52] message, the mystery of God shall be
[2:02:54] finished. There we go. Are you ready?
[2:02:56] Amen. The hidden mystery of Revelation
[2:03:00] 10
[2:03:02] 1-7. The last message to the last church
[2:03:06] age. Amen. What is Revelation 10 1-7?
[2:03:08] Last message. The last message to the
[2:03:11] last age is the seven thunders.
[2:03:15] The angel came down not with the book
[2:03:17] closed with six seals with the book
[2:03:19] open. That mean all seven seals was
[2:03:21] pulled back. So the angel came with the
[2:03:23] book open and seven thunders throw their
[2:03:25] voices out. Hallelujah. That was a
[2:03:27] message that will gather the bride
[2:03:29] together. Show the bride how to prepare.
[2:03:32] Give the bride faith. That was that
[2:03:34] message right there. That is the last
[2:03:36] message. Glory to God. Give the Lord a
[2:03:40] shout of praise. That is the capstone
[2:03:44] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:49] Brother call it the last message
[2:03:53] exactly fulfilled the day when the son
[2:03:55] will reveal now church this message of
[2:03:58] Malachi 4 revelation 107 is going to do
[2:04:00] two things one according to Malachi 4 he
[2:04:04] will turn the heart of a to the fathers
[2:04:06] two he'll reveal the mystery of the
[2:04:08] seven thunders in revelation 10 which
[2:04:10] are the revelations contained in the
[2:04:12] seven seals it will be these divinely
[2:04:16] revealed mystery truths
[2:04:18] that will literally turn the hearts of
[2:04:20] the children back to the Pentecostal
[2:04:22] fathers. Amen. So in other words, he
[2:04:24] already come to re the thunders and the
[2:04:26] ters are going to turn your hearts back
[2:04:27] to the faith of the fathers. Isn't that
[2:04:29] right? Do you believe that? Amen.
[2:04:31] Hallelujah. So then we go back to
[2:04:33] paradox and we know about Danny Henry
[2:04:36] and brother Bam spoke some things and
[2:04:38] and it came across in French and was
[2:04:40] interpreted and this was spoke to the
[2:04:42] prophet because thou has chosen the hard
[2:04:44] way, the narrow path, the hard way. Thou
[2:04:46] has walked in your own choosing. In
[2:04:48] other words, I didn't have to do it. I
[2:04:50] could side and go with them if I want
[2:04:52] to, but I stayed with with the word.
[2:04:54] Hallelujah. Thou has picked the correct
[2:04:56] precise decision. It is my way.
[2:04:58] Hallelujah. Watch the harder way. God
[2:05:00] say his choosing. He choose the right
[2:05:03] thing. Oh, hallelujah. That means he
[2:05:05] wasn't choosing with his eyes or his
[2:05:07] emotions or his feelings. He choose the
[2:05:08] way of God. Oh, that's why you have to
[2:05:11] overcome the lust of the eyes. What do
[2:05:12] you think happened to
[2:05:13] Lot when God told Abraham all this is
[2:05:17] yours? He tell Lot to choose after
[2:05:19] before God tell Abraham that he tell Lot
[2:05:21] to choose and the Bible said God looked
[2:05:22] towards Sodom. His eyes saw his eyes saw
[2:05:27] the nice water plains towards Sodom and
[2:05:30] end up in Sodom. Abraham had the
[2:05:32] wilderness and whatn not but God said
[2:05:33] look to the east west and s all is
[2:05:34] yours. He used his eyes. What are you
[2:05:37] using this morning? What are you seeing
[2:05:39] this morning? Oh hallelujah. as so much
[2:05:41] as church foolishness is just flesh and
[2:05:42] blood. Not even seeing God. He do, she
[2:05:45] do, he say, them say, and what that said
[2:05:48] nonsense.
[2:05:50] Have nothing to do with the program of
[2:05:51] God. To see what God's program is. Look
[2:05:54] at look at Jacob wanted to get back
[2:05:55] home. He's studying his brother want to
[2:05:57] kill him and God and Jacob's doing this.
[2:06:00] He send money what he's supposed to
[2:06:02] richer than me. He sent his wife this
[2:06:03] way and what not. He split them all up
[2:06:05] until God caught him alone. Amen. And
[2:06:07] when God caught Jacob alone, then the
[2:06:09] angel could talk to him, minister to
[2:06:11] him, and he could wrestle with the
[2:06:13] angel. And he knew what he wanted
[2:06:14] because he know he can't face his
[2:06:16] brother. His money can help him. His
[2:06:17] popularity can help him. His wealth
[2:06:19] can't help him. Nothing could help him.
[2:06:21] Only God could help him. And he wrestled
[2:06:23] with the angel all night long.
[2:06:28] You know what he did? He overcome.
[2:06:33] He overcame
[2:06:37] an angel angel said come in the morning
[2:06:39] I got to go. He said I will not let you
[2:06:41] go till you bless me. Where you going?
[2:06:44] You can't go anywhere. I am too
[2:06:47] desperate. I can't leave it the same way
[2:06:49] I came. I've got to get a breakthrough.
[2:06:53] I'm not going to let you go.
[2:07:00] Then then he was touched. Oh, he was
[2:07:02] touched. That what I'm saying. You got
[2:07:04] to get an experience. Jordan is an
[2:07:07] experience.
[2:07:10] Oh, I'm going to say it again. Jordan is
[2:07:12] an experience. Jordan ain't
[2:07:15] no verbal gymnastic thing flipping about
[2:07:17] Jordan and exorting about Jordan. Jordan
[2:07:19] is Jordan. No, no, no, no. Jordan's an
[2:07:21] experience. Jacob was touched. It make
[2:07:24] him walk different. Start to walk with a
[2:07:26] limp. Now, that's embarrassing. You're
[2:07:28] walking with a limp. Walking like an old
[2:07:30] man, but he was changed. Hallelujah. God
[2:07:32] say no longer Jacob. Change your name
[2:07:34] and all. Walk with a new name. Israel is
[2:07:37] your name. Oh, glory to God. How could
[2:07:40] he become Israel without overcoming? How
[2:07:43] could a man walk in normal normal? I am
[2:07:45] Israel. I am Israel. How? Because you
[2:07:48] say so.
[2:07:51] Hallelujah. Because your mouth says so.
[2:07:54] You fix yourself by the new name.
[2:07:56] Anybody could do that. You could go and
[2:07:57] get your papers changed. But you
[2:07:59] overcome nothing. You write it on a
[2:08:01] piece of paper. Get it approved by the
[2:08:03] government. But that is not what Jacob
[2:08:05] get. He overcome. He wrestled all night
[2:08:08] long. God said for this overcoming I can
[2:08:10] leave you there. Every overcomer must
[2:08:12] have something to confirm is overcoming.
[2:08:15] You overcome the lust of the eyes. You
[2:08:17] overcome the lust of the flesh. You
[2:08:19] overcome the pride of life. Something
[2:08:20] have to happen to you. You have to come
[2:08:23] back in power. You pass Gal. You pass
[2:08:26] Bethl. You pass Jericho. You come
[2:08:28] through Jordan. You can't come back
[2:08:30] empty. You can't come back with the same
[2:08:32] robe. You have to come back. Where is
[2:08:34] the Lord God of Elijah, you have to come
[2:08:37] back and get a testimony. The spirit of
[2:08:39] Elijah, God rested upon Elisha.
[2:08:43] Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[2:08:47] Okay, let me just see if I could just
[2:08:50] finish this off here. Because of this
[2:08:53] momentous decision, a huge portion of
[2:08:55] heaven awaits thee. And I think and I
[2:08:58] wondered when I die will it be then it
[2:09:01] happen to think heaven is that portion
[2:09:03] different portion up there. Heaven is
[2:09:05] the kingdom heaven that's within us that
[2:09:07] once what? Wait for what a glorious
[2:09:09] decision that was made. This in itself
[2:09:12] is that which will give and may come to
[2:09:14] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[2:09:17] divine. And we see a tremendous victory
[2:09:19] in the love divine. Here we go. Do you
[2:09:22] see what coming down to the Jordan
[2:09:24] meant? We are down here now. Let's cross
[2:09:27] over now. Hallelujah. Let's quit
[2:09:28] playing. Let's cross to the other side
[2:09:31] now because it all belongs to us. It's
[2:09:34] all ours. Them visions never failed.
[2:09:37] They can't fail because they come from
[2:09:39] God. I believe it with all that with
[2:09:42] within me. We are not the Harland that
[2:09:44] will run back to the wilderness. We will
[2:09:46] cross Jordan. Hallelujah. Prophecy.
[2:09:48] Hallelujah. The separation. Hallelujah.
[2:09:51] Then he says, God, break to us the
[2:09:54] seals.
[2:09:55] That's on the back of the book. Let us
[2:09:58] enter into this great place now. For
[2:10:01] Joshua divided to the people their
[2:10:03] inheritance that God has left for them.
[2:10:06] Hallelujah. So he put the thunders
[2:10:08] that's the back of the book right at
[2:10:10] Jordan. Oh hallelujah. Praise God. Isn't
[2:10:13] that right? Do you believe that? So
[2:10:16] there is where the thunders is at the
[2:10:19] seven thunders. Is that
[2:10:21] Ephesians? When you cross over, you have
[2:10:24] to cross over into the thunders. And the
[2:10:26] thunders will produce another Ephesians.
[2:10:29] The thunders by revelation supposed to
[2:10:31] lead us to Calvary. Supposed to lead us
[2:10:33] to death to self. We have to have power
[2:10:36] over self before we have power over
[2:10:38] others. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[2:10:40] Lord. Come on, please. Hallelujah. God
[2:10:43] requires a Jordan in every life. There's
[2:10:46] some God call man. God
[2:10:49] requires a Jordan in every life. Listen
[2:10:53] son and daughter, listen. Mother,
[2:10:55] father, husband, wife, you cannot
[2:10:57] continue living for you. Amen. Amen. And
[2:11:02] call that Jordan. Whatever you want,
[2:11:05] whatever you feel, whatever is your
[2:11:07] desire, you get it. And if you don't get
[2:11:09] it, you misbehave or you carry on
[2:11:12] because you cannot get your own way. God
[2:11:15] requires a ordinary life. So Elisha come
[2:11:17] around and said to Elisha, "Oh
[2:11:21] my, you're a young
[2:11:24] man." The old prophet was trying to try
[2:11:26] him out. You're a young man. You haven't
[2:11:29] had much schooling. It's really You
[2:11:31] haven't had a grammar school education.
[2:11:33] All you know is how to plow. You better
[2:11:36] stay here and get your Bachelor of Art
[2:11:38] degree. Not Elisha. Not that man who
[2:11:41] once touched God. Amen. and felt the
[2:11:44] power of the anointing upon him.
[2:11:46] Hallelujah. He said, "As the Lord lives,
[2:11:50] and your soul never dies. I'll never
[2:11:51] leave you." He had a purpose. Amen. He
[2:11:54] saw the vision. Hallelujah. He know what
[2:11:57] was going to take place. Lord, and they
[2:11:59] both went down to Jordanise. Jordan
[2:12:01] means death. Amen. They stand there, the
[2:12:05] old man and the young man. It really
[2:12:08] represent Christ and his church. And
[2:12:10] there they stood by the Jordan. There
[2:12:13] she is coming out of the Judeian hills,
[2:12:15] the great ripples roaring. Elisha with
[2:12:17] his gray hair hanging on his back, his
[2:12:20] dim old eyes looked across Jordan. And
[2:12:23] the young man watching every move made.
[2:12:26] One, the young man, here we go. Are you
[2:12:28] ready? Was waiting for a vision to carry
[2:12:33] out the will of God. The other one was
[2:12:35] going home. I love this phrase here.
[2:12:38] They were both at Jordan.
[2:12:41] Oh glory. I just love those words there.
[2:12:45] They were both at Jordan. I just love
[2:12:48] that statement. One is going one looking
[2:12:51] for a vision to do the will of God and
[2:12:53] they both at Jordan. Oh hallelujah. That
[2:12:57] is what Elijah told Elisha, the Lord has
[2:12:59] called me across Jordan. Hallelujah. Oh
[2:13:02] hallelujah.
[2:13:03] Hallelujah. And they too went on. Oh,
[2:13:06] give the Lord some praises people.
[2:13:11] Hallelujah. Oh my. I want to close but I
[2:13:14] want to just kind of wrap up here.
[2:13:15] Listen just suffer. Some say from as I
[2:13:18] was at Moses. Listen to brother Brown. I
[2:13:20] think a minister today that's called of
[2:13:23] God to step into the tracks where Jesus
[2:13:25] stood. What a commission. But each
[2:13:28] that's called of God is commissioned to
[2:13:29] stand in the same place. I'll be with
[2:13:31] you even in you to the end of the way.
[2:13:34] Each minister called to stand where he
[2:13:36] would. The works that I do shall do
[2:13:38] also. Each minister ordained of God is
[2:13:41] commanded to stand in the tracks of
[2:13:43] Jesus Christ and perform the duties that
[2:13:46] Jesus performed. Amen. That's quite a
[2:13:48] command. Not just talk, but perform the
[2:13:51] duties. Oh, hallelujah. Watch how it
[2:13:55] must have felt when Joshua was standing
[2:13:56] in the morning when God said, "I will
[2:13:58] not fail thee nor leave thee. Therefore,
[2:14:01] I will destroy and divide and make a way
[2:14:02] clear for you." Now, there's a great lot
[2:14:04] of types to go into that. Moses was not
[2:14:06] permitted to take the turn over because
[2:14:08] he had
[2:14:11] failed and the church
[2:14:14] organizations denomination has failed
[2:14:18] and that's why God had to raise up a
[2:14:19] Joshua generation. Amen. Because all
[2:14:23] what Moses did, it came to a dead end
[2:14:26] and it couldn't cross. So God had to
[2:14:29] take out Moses off the scene. Hear this
[2:14:31] part. God, there's a quote, Isaac, will
[2:14:34] raise up a new system
[2:14:36] and enter the nominational system by the
[2:14:40] power of God.
[2:14:42] By power, the power of God that will
[2:14:46] take the church into the promised land.
[2:14:48] Organization, denomination has messed it
[2:14:50] up. Each one after their own theology,
[2:14:53] each one after their own way of
[2:14:54] thinking. But God will take his holy
[2:14:58] spirit and will raise his Joshua that
[2:15:01] will take the church to the promise with
[2:15:03] no denominational things string tied it
[2:15:06] at all. Amen. God called ministers ought
[2:15:10] to not to be stuffed up with theology
[2:15:11] but has visited the land to where
[2:15:13] they're going to bring back evidence of
[2:15:15] divine love and power of the Lord Jesus
[2:15:17] to make known to the congregation that
[2:15:19] there's a land beyond the river. And
[2:15:21] this is something but a prince had
[2:15:22] preached. He said, "When we get to the
[2:15:24] river, it divides and separate us." Once
[2:15:27] on the other side, here we go. Something
[2:15:29] happens to you. Yes, sir. Now Joshua in
[2:15:32] all this, knowing that the command was
[2:15:34] great, but having the assurance, he
[2:15:37] could be fearless. He could be, we call
[2:15:39] it, reckless as long as he was pointed
[2:15:43] the right way. So can the church of the
[2:15:45] living God be reckless and fearless if
[2:15:48] the faith is pointed in the right way.
[2:15:51] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Isn't that
[2:15:53] right? So the first stage is coming out
[2:15:55] of the land. Then the second stage is
[2:15:56] sanification through the blood. But the
[2:15:58] third stage is when they cross Jordan
[2:16:00] into the promised land where the promise
[2:16:03] laid. Going past them. He said, "Now
[2:16:06] remember, you have to pass by your
[2:16:07] brethren and they are near the
[2:16:08] borderline. If you pass by them, don't
[2:16:11] say nothing to them. I have given Esau
[2:16:13] this mountain. I have given more of this
[2:16:15] country. I don't want you fussing with
[2:16:17] them. Press lighting. Just move through
[2:16:19] gently. You know where you're going.
[2:16:22] Don't take up their habits.
[2:16:25] Notice not the teachings, you know,
[2:16:27] their habits, which is their behavior. I
[2:16:29] gave Esau this mountain. Don't touch
[2:16:31] him. I've got something for you. Cross
[2:16:33] over. And I'm going to close with
[2:16:36] this. That's my desire, brethren, to see
[2:16:40] my church cross over into another land.
[2:16:42] Amen. A desire to move over to the other
[2:16:44] side. If there's something in you here
[2:16:46] first calling, there'll be something to
[2:16:48] respond to that call. Just settle down
[2:16:51] to sheep raising ain't enough for you.
[2:16:53] Going to some sort of business not
[2:16:54] enough for you. Just to join church, put
[2:16:56] your name in a book is not enough for
[2:16:57] you. But there is something calling you
[2:16:59] across the river. A deep call in a deep.
[2:17:02] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:17:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:17:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[2:17:11] God. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, blessed be
[2:17:14] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise
[2:17:18] be to Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[2:17:21] God. Galatians 5, for the fruit of the
[2:17:24] spirit is love, joy, peace, gentleness,
[2:17:27] goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[2:17:29] Against such is no law. And they in
[2:17:32] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[2:17:33] affections and lust. If we live in the
[2:17:35] spirit, let us walk in the spirit, let
[2:17:38] us be Zarus of vain glory, provoking
[2:17:40] another, envying one another. Oh,
[2:17:43] blessed be the name of the Lord. Okay. 1
[2:17:46] Thessalonians 4. Furthermore, we beseech
[2:17:48] you, brethren, and exalt you by the Lord
[2:17:50] Jesus, that as you have received of us,
[2:17:52] know how you ought to walk and please
[2:17:54] God, so you would abound more and more.
[2:17:57] Know how to walk and please God. Amen.
[2:17:59] For ye know the commandments we give you
[2:18:01] by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will
[2:18:03] of God. This is the will of God, even
[2:18:05] your sanctification, that you should
[2:18:07] abstain from fornication, that every one
[2:18:09] of you should know how to possess his
[2:18:11] vessel in sanification and honor, not in
[2:18:13] lust of caspicence, even as a Gentile
[2:18:16] which know not God, that no man go
[2:18:18] beyond and before his brother in any
[2:18:20] matter, because the Lord is the avenger
[2:18:22] of such, as we are forewarned and
[2:18:23] testify. For God has not called us to
[2:18:26] uncleanness, but to holiness. James 1,
[2:18:29] blessed is the man that endure
[2:18:31] temptation, for when he is tried, he
[2:18:33] shall receive a crown of life. Let no
[2:18:35] man say, when he is tempted, I'm tempted
[2:18:37] of God, for God cannot be tempted with
[2:18:39] evil, neither tempt he any man. But
[2:18:41] every man is tempted when he's drawn
[2:18:43] away with his own lust and enticed. And
[2:18:45] when lust has conceived, it bringeth
[2:18:47] forth sin. And sin when is finished
[2:18:50] bringeth forth debt. Do not er my
[2:18:52] brethren. I'm almost finished. And
[2:18:54] second Peter, whereby given to us
[2:18:56] exceeding great and precious promises,
[2:18:58] that by these you might be partakers of
[2:19:00] the divine nature. Here we go. Having
[2:19:02] escaped the corruption that is in the
[2:19:05] world through lust. Isn't that right?
[2:19:08] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:19:11] You love him this morning. Hallelujah.
[2:19:14] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:19:19] Oh, praise. Let's all stand and just
[2:19:20] worship the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Praise
[2:19:24] be to
[2:19:25] Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:29] Praise God. So, let us cross Jordan
[2:19:33] to an open vision
[2:19:35] of another Ephesians.
[2:19:37] That's what the seven thunders is about.
[2:19:40] To bring us to a place to die. The seven
[2:19:43] thunders was what was hit back there.
[2:19:45] Hallelujah. But we have got to die out
[2:19:48] and get closer to God. Oh yes. Seven
[2:19:51] thunders is not a a party card, not a
[2:19:54] club card. I believe seven thunders, you
[2:19:55] have a card, you show it, have a card.
[2:19:57] Not even the devil recognize that. Amen.
[2:19:59] Seven thunders a humble sweet life
[2:20:02] dedicated to God. That's the thunder
[2:20:04] that sh the devil. Let us bow heads and
[2:20:07] play something soft.
[2:20:10] Hallelujah. Thank you, Father.
[2:20:14] [Music]
[2:20:17] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you
