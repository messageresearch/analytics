[48:50] 13:30 and I want to bring back a few
[48:53] things that we said in prayer service
[48:55] prayer service service night so he's
[48:56] talking about borderline and if you're
[48:59] the borderline come on over cross into
[49:03] Jordan said now when you see the 10 of
[49:06] them with theologians the 12 SP remember
[49:08] what God did he sent out 12 men to bring
[49:11] back evidence to the people because God
[49:14] loves to show his faithfulness God loves
[49:16] to show that he's true to what he
[49:19] promised he doesn't play games he
[49:21] doesn't play his slight of hand and
[49:23] Shady stuff he like to say you know this
[49:25] I Pro is you this look at here so he
[49:27] sent out these 12 men to bring evidence
[49:29] to his people and 10 came back and so on
[49:33] right I we know they're negative and
[49:34] whatnot he said you 10 of them were
[49:37] theologians they were looking at what
[49:39] they could see intellectually but Caleb
[49:41] and Joshua was looking to God's promise
[49:44] praise God he said I've already give it
[49:46] to you and you know you have 10 men
[49:48] inside of you right no you don't
[49:51] know you have five senses of the Flesh
[49:53] and five senses of the spirit 10 of them
[49:56] and all of them is try to tie up to
[49:58] affect you from believing what God Said
[50:00] your feelings your emotions your your
[50:02] memory your conscience your taste smell
[50:04] fee and touch and you had to shake off
[50:06] all of that to believe what God have
[50:07] said if you only watch those senses and
[50:10] those feelings and those imagination
[50:12] doubts will hit you questions will come
[50:15] to you but you shake all of that all
[50:16] them 10 intellectual all them 10 praise
[50:20] God five cens of the flesh five C of the
[50:22] spirit you shake that off and you say
[50:24] God said so God can't lie God going to
[50:26] fill me God going to heal me God going
[50:28] to deliver me God going to break me out

[56:46] right and the last thing I'm going to
[56:48] close is
[56:49] [Music]
[56:50] this so the
[56:52] church is not in its right state yet we
[56:56] have to remember that it is not matured
[57:01] so we just have to linger and do the
[57:03] best we can and there is no one can
[57:07] bring it to
[57:10] maturity no fivefold man no message man
[57:13] no more no man could bring that to
[57:15] maturity here what only the Holy
[57:18] Spirit as we listen to it and I don't
[57:22] believe it will ever come by a man it
[57:24] have to come by God oh Hallelujah that's
[57:28] so much adults who immature they they
[57:31] don't get this they TR a tantrum
[57:33] children does do
[57:35] that you want a sweetie or you want a
[57:37] dis or cake or whatever it is and you
[57:39] don't get them Flor they carrying
[57:42] on have
[57:44] grand don't want pull things if they get
[57:47] away pull things they to thr down things
[57:49] like so like
[57:53] Havoc
[57:57] Havoc I holy man
[58:02] pray yeah like Havoc play Thunder he
[58:05] giving Thunder and he have his get
[58:09] vexed they reach no way yet and get Vex
[58:13] they get upset and angry so if we act
[58:15] like that when we get rebuked or cired
[58:18] or instructed we get
[58:20] immature and only one thing could bring
[58:22] you into maturity true experience so a
[58:25] lot of children who upset with their
[58:27] parents in managing them sometimes they
[58:29] only get sober when they get married and
[58:31] get their own children and especially
[58:33] when they're children just like

[58:38] time they getting to see the self all
[58:40] the time they telling them but this is
[58:41] you this you me looking around so but
[58:44] when they have their own children and
[58:45] the children looking like them acting
[58:47] like them they
[58:49] o now they want to see what daddy and
[58:51] mommy was going through well you don't

[59:13] unique gift with the scriptures with the
[59:16] Bible that I hardly see around and I
[59:21] just love it I love it so much and I
[59:23] believe God will bless him in his call
[59:25] and what how he administers the word and
[59:27] what you begin to see so much is how God
[59:30] has used his different servants but
[59:33] Anthony was tremendous on Wednesday we
[59:34] had some technical issues really
[59:36] tremendous and he was showing that the
[59:38] same God that come down to Moses Pillar

[1:01:43] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:01:46] thank you this morning that we could be
[1:01:47] in your house one more time father it's
[1:01:51] not something we could ever take for
[1:01:53] granted Lord we are here because you
[1:01:56] called us and we are responding to that
[1:01:58] call we did not choose ourselves we did
[1:02:01] not call ourselves father Lord in our
[1:02:04] broken condition born in sin and shaped
[1:02:07] in iniquity father your mercy and Grace
[1:02:10] found us and shook us to a realization
[1:02:13] of who we are and that a price was paid
[1:02:15] before we even on this Earth Lord and we
[1:02:18] have our struggles we have our ups and
[1:02:20] downs we have our moments when we are on
[1:02:23] the victory Mountain and we have time
[1:02:25] when we're in the valley but Lord
[1:02:27] through it all we have learned to trust
[1:02:29] in you and Lord in the depths of our
[1:02:32] soul we could thank you that even when
[1:02:35] we fail that you are faithful father
[1:02:37] Lord you are faithful in our trials you
[1:02:39] are faithful in our struggles you are
[1:02:42] faithful in our weaknesses you are
[1:02:44] faithful in our going out and you are
[1:02:46] faithful in our coming in Lord and no
[1:02:49] wonder they could sing the song Great Is
[1:02:51] Thy Faithfulness father Lord we struggle
[1:02:54] and we go up and down but you are
[1:02:56] constant you are faithful you are the
[1:02:58] god that changes not times change season
[1:03:01] change governments change Kings change
[1:03:04] but Lord you are the same yesterday
[1:03:06] today and forever Lord I'm unworthy to
[1:03:08] stand behind this sacred desk to speak
[1:03:11] to the purchase of the blood of Jesus
[1:03:13] Christ but Lord your blood makes it
[1:03:15] possible Lord and I pray that you could
[1:03:17] use me as your microphone this morning
[1:03:20] and may you speak directly to your needy
[1:03:23] children even speak to me also as we
[1:03:25] approach your scriptures that's divinely
[1:03:27] inspired for correction and for Repro
[1:03:30] and for encouragement Lord we thank you
[1:03:32] for the great Elijah prophet of Malachi
[1:03:35] 4 that could breathe life upon the
[1:03:38] written word and make it the reveal word
[1:03:40] to us that we could have the comfort of
[1:03:42] knowing that Rapture in faith is within
[1:03:44] our reach laying in the message and that
[1:03:46] we could lift up our heads looking
[1:03:48] towards Redemption not by an
[1:03:50] intellectual conception but by true a
[1:03:53] true revelation of the word for the hour
[1:03:56] father may you minister to your sons and
[1:03:58] your daughters those that are gathered
[1:04:00] here those that are on the internet Lord
[1:04:02] wherever they may be today may your word
[1:04:04] find good ground this morning and may
[1:04:06] you bless the service we ask in the
[1:04:08] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[1:04:10] church says and the church says amen and
[1:04:14] amen so certainly a blessed privilege to
[1:04:17] be in the house of the Lord thank you so
[1:04:18] much

[1:04:21] Naomi for being part of it this morning

[1:04:30] Anthony also for the song service today
[1:04:34] as well as the service last Wednesday
[1:04:36] night we got part of it but we know that
[1:04:39] God is moving God is in control we thank
[1:04:42] God for the prayer meeting last uh
[1:04:45] Friday and certainly last Sunday uh last
[1:04:48] weekend I was actually in Germany and I
[1:04:50] bring greetings from Pastor stefanus Co
[1:04:52] and Brena and the church there in
[1:04:54] Germany they send their love they send
[1:04:56] their greetings we had a special meeting
[1:04:59] there uh brother Jano from France an and
[1:05:02] M he and his church came over as well
[1:05:05] and we had a wonderful time around the
[1:05:06] word of the Lord and we know that the
[1:05:09] children of the Lord have a right to
[1:05:10] shout and sing and God is doing
[1:05:12] something everywhere all over the world
[1:05:15] the spirit is moving the but the prophet
[1:05:17] taught us that the angel is on the earth
[1:05:19] now setting things in order for the
[1:05:21] coming of the Lord so we thank him for
[1:05:23] what he is doing and uh just you may be
[1:05:26] see there just for just two or 3 minutes
[1:05:28] just want to just just touch on
[1:05:30] something here that I believe is also
[1:05:32] connected to what rovid preached a few
[1:05:34] weeks ago apart from the spiritual food
[1:05:38] and the spiritual happening in Germany I
[1:05:40] had the opportunity for the first time
[1:05:43] to visit the one of the most
[1:05:46] sophisticated Mercedes plant production
[1:05:49] facilities in Germany it was my first
[1:05:51] time seeing anything like it because uh
[1:05:54] Mercedes uh is a company that's 130
[1:05:57] years old and I guess a lot would have
[1:05:59] changed over time with the way they make
[1:06:01] vehicles and the Technologies behind it
[1:06:04] and of course we over preached a few
[1:06:05] weeks ago about artificial intelligence
[1:06:07] and these things and it was quite
[1:06:09] something walking into into the facility
[1:06:11] and seeing automated robots moving
[1:06:14] around and if you step in its way it's
[1:06:15] stop for itself and when you walk it
[1:06:17] continue going and different things like
[1:06:19] that and and I was just marveling at man
[1:06:21] and his his work man and his achievement
[1:06:25] and it's significant because the brother
[1:06:27] Brana made a reference about the horse
[1:06:30] and the car and and moving from the
[1:06:32] horse and buggy to the car and the motor
[1:06:34] car and moving towards the airoplane and
[1:06:36] moving to spaceships and these things
[1:06:37] and he said that these Natural Things is
[1:06:39] a type of the spiritual and he said that
[1:06:42] we are supposed to be so much further up
[1:06:43] the road because man is always
[1:06:45] progressing and man is always achieving
[1:06:47] and the spiritual we are not we we we
[1:06:49] don't want to be in a horse and buggy
[1:06:51] age when the world is in an age of
[1:06:52] spaceship and rocket and these things
[1:06:53] and and it began to dawn on me and as I
[1:06:55] was looking around with in I think they
[1:06:57] had about 5,000
[1:06:59] robots at work simultaneously 24-hour
[1:07:02] operation one part of it is 90 something
[1:07:05] per automated so no human involved in
[1:07:07] the production they have it down to a
[1:07:09] science almost a zero error production
[1:07:12] facility and I'm watching in amazement
[1:07:14] not just at the technology but what man
[1:07:16] could achieve and it took me back to
[1:07:18] what brother preached a few years a few
[1:07:20] weeks ago when he talked about how God
[1:07:22] had to come down in the days of the
[1:07:24] Tower of Babel because if God did not
[1:07:27] intervene he said that man is United and
[1:07:30] man would achieve it and nothing will
[1:07:32] stop man when he's United and he's
[1:07:35] focused on objective God himself had to
[1:07:38] step down to interrupt it and God's
[1:07:40] response to dealing with that situation
[1:07:43] was to confound their language so he
[1:07:46] could break the communication between
[1:07:48] the people so they could not work
[1:07:50] together but we realize that over the
[1:07:52] passage of time man has been working to
[1:07:54] reconnect now you have your phone that
[1:07:56] could actually translate language once
[1:07:58] more and man is talking about the but
[1:08:01] spoke about the neuralink in in in Elon
[1:08:03] musk's concept that they are saying that
[1:08:06] soon you wouldn't have to even think
[1:08:08] about speaking the next language because
[1:08:09] the neuralink and these things will
[1:08:11] translate once more language between
[1:08:13] languages we know back there on the day
[1:08:15] of Pentecost and right after they all
[1:08:17] heard in one common language so the
[1:08:19] concept of unity but the Brandon
[1:08:21] presented it as United under one head
[1:08:23] head of Christ but man is quickly using
[1:08:26] technology to once again recreate what
[1:08:29] existed there in Genesis as it was in
[1:08:31] the beginning so they're going to try to
[1:08:33] make it at the end time so I'm watching
[1:08:35] the unfolding of technology and saying
[1:08:38] as brother bam said we should be way up
[1:08:39] the road but I believe that we are in a
[1:08:42] season that God is about to do something
[1:08:44] Among Us and it's not going to be a long
[1:08:47] time to do it go there's not much time
[1:08:49] left this is why the prophet would say
[1:08:51] it'll be a short quick message it'll be
[1:08:53] a short short quick work it wouldn't
[1:08:55] take too much time because the word is
[1:08:57] already in the bride it just waits for
[1:08:59] the intelligence to activate what's been
[1:09:01] laying there all these years so I'm
[1:09:04] excited you have to forgive me when I
[1:09:06] stood in that facility I wasn't seeing
[1:09:08] the natural technology I'm saying but
[1:09:11] look how God is about to automate some
[1:09:13] things in my heart oh Hallelujah
[1:09:15] automate some things in my life where
[1:09:17] you can take no thought of what they
[1:09:19] have to say because it's now automated
[1:09:21] by the intelligence of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:23] anybody with me this
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:28] morning do you know that that Faith
[1:09:30] supposed to be automated that virtue
[1:09:32] supposed to be automated that Temperance
[1:09:34] supposed to be automated not with AI but
[1:09:37] the Holy Ghost will make it an automatic
[1:09:39] response when the devil expect you to
[1:09:41] hold a art it's automated that you drop
[1:09:43] the o or you don't hear me this morning
[1:09:45] I don't know if I'm home yet this
[1:09:47] morning that the automation of the Holy
[1:09:49] Spirit when he supposed to curse
[1:09:51] somebody and give a bad word or whatever
[1:09:54] the automation of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] changes your words and you can only
[1:09:58] speak
[1:10:01] [Music]
[1:10:03] love because not an intellectual
[1:10:05] expression but it's God himself
[1:10:08] automatically making themselves known
[1:10:11] and that seed that's in you is listen
[1:10:14] that seed has got to grow you
[1:10:16] know we don't have to force the seed to
[1:10:18] grow all you have to do is put the seed
[1:10:20] in the right environment because the
[1:10:22] promises every seed will bring forth
[1:10:25] after its kind so if the seed in you is
[1:10:27] the seed of the Holy Ghost and eternal
[1:10:29] life we not here to work you up to do it
[1:10:32] we are here to create an environment
[1:10:34] that the seed can grow the seed will
[1:10:37] take care of itself or you don't hear me
[1:10:39] this morning it's the properties of the
[1:10:42] seed to grow it's the properties of the
[1:10:44] seed to be Faith virtue knowledge
[1:10:47] Temperance patience calliness Bradly
[1:10:49] kindness charity that's what the seed is
[1:10:51] designed to produce
[1:10:56] what we are here this morning friends is
[1:10:58] to create an atmosphere so that the seed
[1:11:00] could grow we here to water the seed
[1:11:02] with worship oh you don't hear me this
[1:11:04] morning create an atmosphere to get
[1:11:07] everything else away from the seed uh so
[1:11:09] the seed could stretch and that Lily
[1:11:11] could press its way press its way past
[1:11:14] what happened last week press its way
[1:11:16] what happened this morning press it
[1:11:18] press past your
[1:11:22] limitations so I just thought I'd
[1:11:25] encourage you a little bit and to let
[1:11:28] you know that it's
[1:11:29] later than we think so much is changing
[1:11:33] there was a time you had to board a
[1:11:35] plane with a physical boarding pass now
[1:11:38] you don't need no physical boarding pass
[1:11:40] you could board the plane with your
[1:11:41] phone you just take your phone and you
[1:11:42] pass it and you board the plane you scan
[1:11:44] the plane that's where technology is
[1:11:46] going man is trying to approximate so
[1:11:48] many things that God is going to put
[1:11:50] Hallelujah where you could take no
[1:11:52] thought of where you want to go and the
[1:11:53] end up there they just trying to
[1:11:55] approximate but they could never have
[1:11:57] what you and I could have they could
[1:11:58] never do what you and I could do they
[1:12:00] could never experience what you and I
[1:12:02] could
[1:12:05] experience can the church say
[1:12:07] Amen let's all stand for the reading of
[1:12:10] the
[1:12:11] word I have four portions of
[1:12:15] scripture reading St Matthew
[1:12:18] 16 Jeremiah
[1:12:20] 29 Ezekiel 1 and Daniel
[1:12:33] one certainly good to see all of you in
[1:12:36] the house of the
[1:12:38] Lord PSS David said I was glad when they
[1:12:41] said unto me let us go into the house of
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:46] Lord Matthew
[1:12:49] 16:13 when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:12:52] cesaria Philippi he ask his disciples
[1:12:55] saying whom do men say that
[1:12:59] I the son of man
[1:13:01] am notice he's actually saying I am the
[1:13:05] son of man he didn't say I am a son of
[1:13:08] man he's actually declaring his identity
[1:13:11] to them he is giving them the answer
[1:13:14] before the
[1:13:15] question so he's asking a rhetorical
[1:13:18] question we say language right so whom
[1:13:20] do men say I the son of man am singular
[1:13:24] personal pronoun and they said some say
[1:13:27] that thou art John the
[1:13:30] Baptist some
[1:13:32] Elias and others
[1:13:34] jeremias or one of the prophets he saith
[1:13:37] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[1:13:40] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[1:13:42] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:13:44] Jesus answered and said unto him bless
[1:13:46] art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and
[1:13:49] Blood had not revealed it unto thee but
[1:13:51] my Father which is in heaven let's go to
[1:13:54] Jeremiah
[1:13:55] 29 reading verse
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:13:58] 11 for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:14:01] toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of
[1:14:04] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:14:06] expected end then shall he call upon me
[1:14:10] and he shall go and pray unto me and I
[1:14:11] will hearken unto you and he shall seek
[1:14:14] me and find me when he shall search for
[1:14:16] me with all of your heart and I will be
[1:14:19] found of you sayeth the Lord and I will
[1:14:21] turn away your captivity and I will
[1:14:24] gather you from all the nations and from
[1:14:25] all the places whether I have driven you
[1:14:28] sayeth the Lord and I will bring you
[1:14:30] again into the place whence I caused you
[1:14:33] to be carried away captive let's go to
[1:14:36] Ezekiel
[1:14:37] 1 reading verse
[1:14:40] one now it came to pass in the 30th year
[1:14:44] in the fourth month in the fifth day of
[1:14:47] the month as I was among the captives by
[1:14:50] the river of Chiba that the Lord that
[1:14:54] that the heavens were open and I saw
[1:14:55] visions of God so I want you to
[1:14:57] understand that Ezekiel here is in
[1:15:00] captivity and in the midst of his
[1:15:02] captivity he's having a spiritual
[1:15:05] experience I was among the captives by
[1:15:08] the river of Chiba that the heavens were
[1:15:11] open and I saw visions of God in the
[1:15:13] fifth day of the month which was the
[1:15:15] fifth year of King Jehovah Chin's
[1:15:17] captivity the word of the Lord came
[1:15:19] expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the
[1:15:21] son of booie in the land of the Chalan
[1:15:24] as the land of the Babylonians by the
[1:15:26] river Chiba and the Hand of the Lord was
[1:15:29] there in his captivity upon him can the
[1:15:32] church say Amen our last reading Daniel
[1:15:34] 1 and verse
[1:15:36] 1 in the third year of the reign of je
[1:15:41] jehoiakim king of Judah came
[1:15:43] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto
[1:15:45] Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord
[1:15:48] gave jeho Kim King of Judah into his
[1:15:50] hand with part of the vessel of the
[1:15:52] house of God which he carried into the
[1:15:54] land of China to the house of his God
[1:15:57] and he brought the vessels into the
[1:15:58] Treasure House of his God and the King
[1:16:01] spake unto asanas the master of his
[1:16:03] unics that he should bring certain of
[1:16:05] the children of Israel and of the king's
[1:16:07] seed and of the princes children in whom
[1:16:10] was no blemish but well favored and
[1:16:12] skillful in all wisdom and cunning in
[1:16:15] knowledge and understanding science and
[1:16:17] such as had ability in them to stand in
[1:16:20] the king's Palace and whom they might
[1:16:22] teach that learn burning and the tongue
[1:16:24] of the Chalan and the King appointed
[1:16:26] them a daily provision of the king's
[1:16:28] meat and of the wine which he drank so
[1:16:31] nourishing them three years that at the
[1:16:33] end thereof they might stand before the
[1:16:35] king now among them were the children of
[1:16:37] Judah Daniel hananiah mishel and Azariah
[1:16:41] the three Hebrew boys Shadrach Meshach
[1:16:43] and Abednego right so may the Lord had a
[1:16:45] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:16:46] may be
[1:16:47] seated everybody feeling fine wonderful
[1:16:51] so for a title this morning
[1:16:53] Jeremiah's prophetic
[1:16:56] Bridge from Isaiah's warnings to Ezekiel
[1:17:00] and Daniel's Visions I'll see it one
[1:17:02] more time Jeremiah's prophetic Bridge
[1:17:05] from Isaiah's warning to Ezekiel and
[1:17:08] Daniel's Visions for a subject the
[1:17:11] unfolding mystery of God through
[1:17:13] Jeremiah and an inspiration the final
[1:17:16] Kings and the Eternal Kingdom may the
[1:17:19] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[1:17:21] his word are you ready
[1:17:23] you have your seat belts on today Sunday
[1:17:25] today is the Lord's day we here for the
[1:17:26] day today I was glad when they said unto
[1:17:29] me let us go into the house of the Lords
[1:17:31] I want you to be in the spirit I want
[1:17:33] you to get excited because God is doing
[1:17:34] something tremendous I want to encourage
[1:17:36] the young people I want to encourage the
[1:17:38] calebs that this is our time this is our
[1:17:40] season and this is what we are here on
[1:17:42] the earth for the bills the bills will
[1:17:45] deal with themselves your mortgage your
[1:17:47] your problems they will take care of
[1:17:48] themselves but we have a job to do this
[1:17:50] morning and I shared with them in in
[1:17:53] Germany something but it says here all
[1:17:54] the time you cannot fight a full-time
[1:17:56] Devil with a part-time Christian walk
[1:17:58] you need to be a full-time Christian to
[1:18:00] fight a full-time devil so we are here
[1:18:02] to be full-time Christians to put our
[1:18:04] solar to the wheel in this great economy
[1:18:07] of God can the church say Amen so we
[1:18:10] read the scripture I want to start there
[1:18:12] in the New Testament and then we'll go
[1:18:13] into the old where Jesus is at the
[1:18:15] crossroads in his
[1:18:18] ministry and he asked the disciple the
[1:18:20] question what's the talk out there about
[1:18:22] me you know this who do men say that I
[1:18:25] am and what caught my attention is that
[1:18:29] there was already a talk about Jesus it
[1:18:32] was impossible to not have heard about
[1:18:33] Jesus his impact in his ministry his
[1:18:36] teaching and his miracles what he said
[1:18:38] what he did how he acted where he went
[1:18:40] how he moved was creating a stir among
[1:18:43] the people of that day in so much that
[1:18:45] there was a conversation have you heard
[1:18:47] did you hear what he said here did you
[1:18:49] hear what he did there did he hear what
[1:18:50] happened there did you hear about this
[1:18:52] man called Jesus
[1:18:53] so there were conversations that were
[1:18:55] taking place and Jesus was trying to now
[1:18:57] reach a point with his own disciples he
[1:18:59] said tell me what's being said about
[1:19:01] this
[1:19:03] ministry now what caught my attention is
[1:19:05] the fact that there will have been many
[1:19:07] prophets that walked the Earth before
[1:19:09] Jesus from the great prophet Samuel to
[1:19:12] prophets like Moses to to you name it
[1:19:14] from Amos and Joel and you name it
[1:19:17] throughout all Biblical
[1:19:18] history so it caught my attention when
[1:19:21] they started to call certain names
[1:19:24] because this was people's or man's
[1:19:26] trying to figure out who is
[1:19:28] Jesus so to the best of their knowledge
[1:19:30] they had narrowed it down after much
[1:19:33] research deliberation speculation and
[1:19:35] conversation to three different
[1:19:38] people they say some say you are John
[1:19:40] the
[1:19:40] Baptist now this is not a a a crazy
[1:19:43] statement because if you go to this is
[1:19:45] Matthew 16 if you check Matthew
[1:19:48] 14 you would actually see that even let
[1:19:52] me just get it quickly here in Matthew
[1:19:55] 14 verse1 at the time Herod the Tetra
[1:19:59] had heard of the fame of Jesus and he
[1:20:01] said unto his servants this is John the
[1:20:04] Baptist he is risen from the dead so
[1:20:08] there were people saying I wonder if
[1:20:09] John the Baptist raised again and this
[1:20:11] is this is Jesus is John the Baptist so
[1:20:14] up to the King Herod is wondering trying
[1:20:17] to figure out who Jesus was can the
[1:20:19] church say
[1:20:20] Amen then some say it could be Elias
[1:20:24] because we know Elijah went up in a
[1:20:25] chariot of fire maybe after all these
[1:20:27] years Elijah has come back because the
[1:20:29] the preaching that John the Baptist had
[1:20:31] and the preaching the way Elijah Elijah
[1:20:34] used to operate seem to be the same way
[1:20:36] Jesus
[1:20:38] operated so they say maybe John the
[1:20:40] Baptist maybe he's Elijah maybe we know
[1:20:42] Elijah didn't die maybe John the Baptist
[1:20:44] rose again or maybe others say he's
[1:20:48] jermiah so I said I try to understand
[1:20:50] what is it about this man called
[1:20:52] Jeremiah
[1:20:53] that made Jesus look like Jeremiah
[1:20:56] people say this have to be something
[1:20:57] like Jeremiah so I have to go back now
[1:20:59] and go back into understand now how this
[1:21:02] thing unfolded and we preached a few
[1:21:04] weeks ago about King uh about the
[1:21:06] prophet Samuel and King David you
[1:21:08] remember that and we say God never
[1:21:10] wanted man to have be ruled by a king it
[1:21:13] was never God's desire for man to be
[1:21:15] ruled by man can the church say Amen
[1:21:18] when they left Egypt they left under the
[1:21:20] prophet Moses and then they lived under
[1:21:23] judges and they had prophets among them
[1:21:25] and then there was the great prophet
[1:21:27] Samuel who was standing there as a
[1:21:29] prophet to God's
[1:21:31] people and he was the one that they came
[1:21:33] and say let's at the king like the
[1:21:35] others can the church say amen and he
[1:21:38] was so bruised by it so broken by it
[1:21:41] that God said you know what they haven't
[1:21:43] rejected you they've rejected me and God
[1:21:46] allowed Saul to be king in fact God
[1:21:49] chose
[1:21:50] Saul our was s brother over I want to
[1:21:52] preach a message the rise and fall of
[1:21:54] Saul the benjamite because Saul didn't
[1:21:57] start off
[1:22:00] bad Saul started off real good many
[1:22:04] people start off good in the Bible but
[1:22:05] they end up bad and it's a cautionary
[1:22:08] tale to us to not take things for
[1:22:10] granted Saul went out of the parameters
[1:22:13] God give him and God judge him and more
[1:22:15] and more we realizing people don't
[1:22:18] understand that God is a god of judgment
[1:22:20] he's a god of Mercy but he's a god of
[1:22:22] judgment Jud M he's a god of warning and
[1:22:24] he's a god of judgment can the church
[1:22:26] say
[1:22:27] amen and we know the story David is
[1:22:30] established as king after God removed
[1:22:33] Saul and after King David we have his
[1:22:36] son Solomon who was the last king that
[1:22:40] governed the entire children of
[1:22:43] Israel everybody with me because after
[1:22:47] Solomon at the end of Solomon's Ministry
[1:22:49] even Solomon started off good and ended
[1:22:52] up wrong
[1:22:54] I'm laying a foundation here now and the
[1:22:57] Kingdom of Israel is divided in the
[1:23:00] north with the Kingdom of Israel and in
[1:23:01] the sou with the kingdom of
[1:23:04] Judah Solomon despite his wisdom and his
[1:23:07] faithfulness eventually turned to God
[1:23:10] influenced by his wives who were
[1:23:14] pagans and God was so Furious in First
[1:23:17] Kings
[1:23:19] 11:6 and Solomon did evil in the sight
[1:23:22] of the Lord and went not fully after the
[1:23:25] Lord as did David his
[1:23:27] father then did Solomon build an high
[1:23:30] place for chimos the abomination of Moab
[1:23:34] in the hill that is before Jerusalem and
[1:23:36] for Molech the abomination of the
[1:23:38] children of Ammon and likewise did he
[1:23:40] for all his strange wives which burnt
[1:23:43] incense and sacrifice unto their gods
[1:23:46] and the Lord was angry with Solomon
[1:23:49] because his heart was turned from the
[1:23:51] Lord God of Israel which had appeared
[1:23:53] unto him twice not what is being written
[1:23:56] so God is saying I came to you how dare
[1:23:59] you turn away from
[1:24:03] God and had commanded him concerning
[1:24:06] this thing that he should not go after
[1:24:08] other gods but he kept not that which
[1:24:11] the Lord commanded I want you to see the
[1:24:14] picture and the context of God operating
[1:24:17] at different levels in different ways in
[1:24:19] different times achieving his purpose
[1:24:21] wherefore verse 11 the Lord said unto
[1:24:23] Solomon for as much as this is done of
[1:24:27] thee in other words actions have
[1:24:33] consequences God will forgive you but
[1:24:36] actions still have consequences in know
[1:24:39] Hallelujah I want us to get something
[1:24:40] here God's forgiveness doesn't take away
[1:24:43] God's ability and sovereignity to punish
[1:24:46] you when you step out of
[1:24:48] line God will punish you and forgive you
[1:24:50] and give you Grace and still punish you
[1:24:52] and forgive you and give you and still
[1:24:54] punish you it don't means god
[1:24:55] forgiveness means you don't get punished
[1:24:57] for stepping out the line because he's a
[1:24:58] god through his love that chasons oh
[1:25:01] come on now somebody as many as I love I
[1:25:04] rebuke and
[1:25:06] chasen and that's why we have to be so
[1:25:08] careful sometime we pray for people and
[1:25:10] God is saying is my judgment upon them
[1:25:11] you
[1:25:12] know you could pray as hard as you want
[1:25:15] if God is sending judgment to your house
[1:25:18] because of foolishness in your house no
[1:25:20] amount of prayer could turn that away in
[1:25:22] because God says it's already spoken
[1:25:25] it's already done and the matter is
[1:25:26] already settled turn from your ways if
[1:25:28] you had turned before when I warned you
[1:25:30] I could have done it but now we already
[1:25:32] messed up come back to God now before it
[1:25:34] get worse that's how all through
[1:25:36] scripture that's how God
[1:25:40] deals and listen to how God addresses
[1:25:42] this and we're going to build to
[1:25:44] something wherefore the Lord said un the
[1:25:46] Solomon for as much as this is done of
[1:25:48] thee and thou Hast not kept my
[1:25:50] commandment my Covenant and my statutes
[1:25:53] which I have commanded thee listen I
[1:25:56] will surely Rend the Kingdom from thee
[1:25:59] and will give it to thy
[1:26:02] servant so when the kingdom was divided
[1:26:05] it was actually not someone from your
[1:26:06] Royal Land it was a servant it was a
[1:26:09] military Captain became king in Israel
[1:26:12] not withstanding in thy days verse 12 I
[1:26:14] will not do it for David thy father's
[1:26:16] seek but I will Rend it out of the hand
[1:26:19] of thy
[1:26:20] son brother George go tell Solomon
[1:26:23] because of your father David this
[1:26:26] punishment is coming but I'm not going
[1:26:27] to do it to you but your son where is
[1:26:30] where the kingdom will be destroyed and
[1:26:31] ripped apart into two out of my respects
[1:26:34] for my servant my son David I'm going to
[1:26:36] keep this together until you die but
[1:26:39] your son will still have to deal with
[1:26:41] the consequence of your
[1:26:44] decisions that's why I preach sometime
[1:26:46] ago when lot went to Sodom lot could
[1:26:48] have handled the issues in Sodom the
[1:26:51] Bible said it Vex him daily but his wife
[1:26:53] couldn't handle it his children couldn't
[1:26:55] handle it we have to understand the
[1:26:57] decisions we make especially to the
[1:27:00] fathers and men in the house affect our
[1:27:02] families affect our children affect our
[1:27:10] situations what did Solomon's son do to
[1:27:13] deserve this there was
[1:27:14] nothing but God said Solomon judgment
[1:27:17] has to come but I love my servant David
[1:27:20] so because of that I'm in respect to
[1:27:22] David I allow you to die without seeing
[1:27:24] the pain of the Kingdom
[1:27:28] divided I want you to see and and it
[1:27:30] through scripture when we get to
[1:27:33] Jeremiah God tells Jeremiah all the time
[1:27:35] the people have lost the fear of God
[1:27:38] that's why they do what they do they
[1:27:39] don't know what the fear of God is and
[1:27:42] no wonder the Bible said the fear of the
[1:27:43] Lord is the beginning of
[1:27:47] wisdom what this means is Solomon lost
[1:27:49] the fear of
[1:27:51] God because when you lose the faar of
[1:27:53] God that's the only way you could do
[1:27:55] something against the Commandments of
[1:27:56] the
[1:27:59] Lord anybody with me this is not a kind
[1:28:01] of jump and Shout for Joy kind of
[1:28:03] message I want to point you to the
[1:28:05] unfolding of the plan of God
[1:28:08] here verse 13 how be I will not Rend
[1:28:11] away all the kingdom but will give One
[1:28:13] Tribe to thy son for David my servant's
[1:28:16] sake and for Jerusalem's sake which I've
[1:28:18] chosen so we know through history 10
[1:28:21] tribes formed Israel under the
[1:28:25] captain uh it was Captain Jobo who was a
[1:28:28] captain in the Army led the people aside
[1:28:32] and it left the tribe of Judah The Tribe
[1:28:34] of Benjamin and a few of the Levites
[1:28:37] will begin to call now the people of
[1:28:39] Judah or the kingdom of Judah and they
[1:28:41] stayed under Solomon's son so Solomon's
[1:28:43] son rabom just was he was the first king
[1:28:45] of
[1:28:47] Judah with just the tribe of Judah The
[1:28:50] Tribe of Benjamin and a few of the
[1:28:51] Levites who were there amen and to
[1:28:53] denore the Kingdom of Israel under
[1:28:56] someone who had nothing to do with
[1:28:57] royalty amen and listen to the politics
[1:29:00] of the
[1:29:01] day Judah still kept the temple
[1:29:05] Jerusalem so under King rehoboam
[1:29:07] Solomon's son the temple is under the
[1:29:10] control of the kingdom of Judah where
[1:29:13] the sacrifice is offered is under the
[1:29:14] kingdom of Judah and Jobo who is leading
[1:29:18] Israel say I am afraid that if the
[1:29:20] people go down to the temple they will
[1:29:22] backslide from me and go back and
[1:29:25] join anybody with anybody with me he was
[1:29:29] so concerned about the people going back
[1:29:30] to Jerusalem he created golden
[1:29:34] Cales the same golden Cales they left
[1:29:37] after Egypt he created golden CS to keep
[1:29:40] their attention
[1:29:43] there Hallelujah now he know he wrong
[1:29:45] you know but he afraid to lose members
[1:29:48] to this is politics now so he cre but
[1:29:52] George golden calves and say let's
[1:29:53] worship this so you don't have to go
[1:29:55] down to Jerusalem to the kingdom of
[1:29:56] Judah now you see why God but asby would
[1:29:59] be so upset Through the Ages about the
[1:30:02] fill done in Israel and in Judah over
[1:30:04] time and as you look through the lineage
[1:30:06] of the Kings of Israel and the kings of
[1:30:09] Judah it's two kingdoms struggling for
[1:30:13] their identity but that was not God's
[1:30:15] original plan for them to be two
[1:30:17] separate kingdoms anybody with me this
[1:30:19] morning I'm trying to paint a picture
[1:30:21] here to you amen so through all of this
[1:30:25] we find ourselves coming closer to our
[1:30:27] text this
[1:30:30] morning to the time Jeremiah is
[1:30:34] born Jeremiah is on the
[1:30:37] earth at the time of Jeremiah's birth
[1:30:40] the whole of Israel is in captivity
[1:30:42] Israel gone the northern kingdom is in
[1:30:46] captivity by the Assyrians they not
[1:30:47] nowhere WR
[1:30:50] anymore all of their Kings this is King
[1:30:52] Ahab all of them was Israel Elijah was
[1:30:55] the one who was dealing with Israel all
[1:30:56] along and those things that whole
[1:30:57] lineage there but by the time Jeremiah
[1:30:59] on he seene he's coming into shambles as
[1:31:02] it were because the whole of the Kingdom
[1:31:04] of Israel is in bondage by the Assyria
[1:31:06] and he's coming in at a time where there
[1:31:09] are only five Kings left that will
[1:31:13] finish
[1:31:15] Judah he's at a pivotal point in his
[1:31:18] journey the last major prophet before
[1:31:20] him was the prophet
[1:31:22] Isaiah the great prophet Isaiah who
[1:31:25] would stand and warn the people if you
[1:31:27] don't turn back to God you're going to
[1:31:29] be in
[1:31:30] trouble Isaiah would also give them hope
[1:31:33] and say Behold a virgin will conceive
[1:31:35] and he begins to point them to the
[1:31:37] promise and you know what the people did
[1:31:39] not
[1:31:41] listen they did not
[1:31:43] heed and every single King as you trace
[1:31:46] it down Israel is already finished the
[1:31:48] last kings of Judah forget it horrible
[1:31:52] save probably only one King
[1:31:54] Josiah who was the king when Jeremiah
[1:31:58] started his ministry he was the first
[1:32:01] king as it
[1:32:02] were and just to kind of point something
[1:32:04] to King
[1:32:06] Josiah King Josiah would have been the
[1:32:10] probably the grandchild I believe of
[1:32:11] Hezekiah who would have been under there
[1:32:13] would have been two kings it would have
[1:32:14] been the great grandson of King
[1:32:16] Hezekiah 2 Kings verse 22 Josiah was 8
[1:32:20] years old when he began to Reign and he
[1:32:22] reigned 30 And1 years in
[1:32:25] Jerusalem verse two and he did that
[1:32:27] which was right in the sight of the Lord
[1:32:29] and walked in all the way of David his
[1:32:31] father and turned not as sight to the
[1:32:33] right hand or the
[1:32:36] left and it came to pass that he sent
[1:32:39] scribes to check certain things I want
[1:32:41] to drop down to verse eight and hilaya
[1:32:43] the high priest said unto shafan the
[1:32:45] Scribe I have found the book of the law
[1:32:47] in the house of the Lord I want you to
[1:32:49] watch you were that they found the book
[1:32:50] in other words no nobody nobody is
[1:32:52] reading the
[1:32:54] book this is what go told josua this
[1:32:56] book of the law should not depart from
[1:32:58] you but meditate day and night here it
[1:33:00] was somebody had to find the book of the
[1:33:02] law because nobody was paying attention
[1:33:04] to the book of the law I have found the
[1:33:07] book of the law in the house of the Lord
[1:33:08] and hilaya gave the book to shaan and he
[1:33:10] read it and shaan the Scribe came to the
[1:33:13] king and brought the king word again and
[1:33:14] said thy servants have gathered the
[1:33:16] money that was found in the house and
[1:33:18] have delivered it unto the hand of them
[1:33:20] that do the work and have the over sight
[1:33:22] of the house of the Lord and shaan the
[1:33:24] scribes showed the king saying hilaya
[1:33:26] the priest had delivered me a book and
[1:33:29] shafan read it before the king and it
[1:33:31] came to pass that when the king had
[1:33:33] heard the words of the book of the law
[1:33:35] that he rent his
[1:33:37] clothes and the King commanded elai the
[1:33:39] priest and aikam the son of shafan and
[1:33:42] abbor the son of Mah and shaffin the
[1:33:45] Scribe and Isaiah the a servant of the
[1:33:47] king saying go ye inquire of the Lord
[1:33:49] for me and for the people for all Judah
[1:33:52] concerning the words of this book now at
[1:33:54] this time all of Israel are already in
[1:33:56] bondage yeah it's just Judah is left
[1:33:58] now to do according unto all that is

[1:34:17] house of the Lord and all the men of

[1:34:21] Jerusalem with him and the priests and
[1:34:22] the prophets and all the people both
[1:34:24] small and great and he read in their
[1:34:26] ears all the words of the book of the
[1:34:30] Covenant which was found in the house of
[1:34:32] the Lord and the King stood by a pillar
[1:34:35] and made a covenant before the Lord to
[1:34:37] walk after the Lord and to keep his
[1:34:39] Commandments and his testimonies and his
[1:34:42] statutes with all their heart and all
[1:34:45] their soul to perform the words of this
[1:34:47] Covenant that were written in this book
[1:34:50] and all the people stood to the Covenant
[1:34:52] and the King commanded hilaya the high
[1:34:55] priest and the priests of the second
[1:34:58] order and the keepers of the door to

[1:38:52] kings of Judah had made and the altars
[1:38:54] which manesa had made in the two courts
[1:38:56] of the house of the Lord did the king
[1:38:57] beat down and break them down from den
[1:39:00] and cast the dust of them into the brook
[1:39:02] hedron this the first time in scripture
[1:39:05] you see so much being done to clean up
[1:39:07] the
[1:39:08] place when last have you cleaned your
[1:39:10] house when last have you cleaned your
[1:39:12] life when last have you cleaned your
[1:39:14] altar when last have you clean your
[1:39:15] environment from everything that is
[1:39:17] filthy everything that is unclean
[1:39:19] everything that is not pure everything
[1:39:21] that is not holy because you want to
[1:39:23] wholly follow the lord it's not a a an
[1:39:26] expression of a tradition but it's a
[1:39:28] reality that if God is God then serve
[1:39:31] him if God is God then worship
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:37] Him and listen all of the reading that
[1:39:40] goes on is about destruction I'm
[1:39:41] destroying listen I can't read it all
[1:39:43] because we will not
[1:39:49] finish but I can go down to verse vers
[1:39:51] 21 after everything is cleaned up and
[1:39:54] the King commanded all the people saying
[1:39:57] keep the Passover unto the Lord your God
[1:40:00] as it is written in the book of this
[1:40:02] Covenant they wanted even keep in the
[1:40:04] Passover the Passover but Jordan was a
[1:40:06] reminder of how they came out of Egypt
[1:40:09] and they had
[1:40:10] forgotten to keep the Passover and the
[1:40:13] Bible tells me in verse 22 surely there
[1:40:15] was not held such a Passover from the
[1:40:18] days of the judges that judged Israel no
[1:40:21] in all the days of the Kings of Israel
[1:40:23] nor the kings of Judah in other words
[1:40:24] Josiah oversaw the greatest
[1:40:28] Passover that Israel and Judah had ever
[1:40:30] seen what a king God give us men like
[1:40:35] Josiah who could read the word and do
[1:40:38] everything according to the
[1:40:40] [Applause]
[1:40:43] law so this was the king that was on the
[1:40:48] throne when Jeremiah
[1:40:52] Ministry
[1:40:54] started can the church say
[1:41:02] Amen Jeremiah verse one chapter 1 verse
[1:41:05] one the words of Jeremiah the son of
[1:41:07] hilaya of the priests that were in
[1:41:09] ananat in the land of Benjamin to whom
[1:41:12] the word of the Lord came in the days of
[1:41:14] Josiah the son of Ammon king of Judah in
[1:41:17] the 13th year of his Reign it came also
[1:41:20] in the days of jeim the son of Josiah
[1:41:23] king of Judah un the end of the 11th
[1:41:25] year of zedekiah the son of Josiah king
[1:41:28] of Judah so Jeremiah served under five
[1:41:32] Kings and we talk a little bit more
[1:41:34] about them but these were the five last
[1:41:36] kings that sat over the
[1:41:39] throne understand this by the time that
[1:41:41] last king that Jeremiah saw come off the
[1:41:44] throne there was there's been no King
[1:41:46] since that time so Jeremiah's Ministry
[1:41:50] is unique because he saw and many
[1:41:52] prophets prophesy of Destruction and
[1:41:55] prophesy and they never get to witness
[1:41:58] prophecy Isaiah said a virgin shall
[1:42:00] conceive he didn't get to see the Virgin
[1:42:01] conceive but Jeremiah stood warning the
[1:42:04] people if you don't turn around your
[1:42:06] life we will be taken over God will send
[1:42:09] the Babylonians turn around because God
[1:42:11] will judge us he
[1:42:13] prophesied and years
[1:42:16] later Jeremiah is being taken
[1:42:19] away into captivity
[1:42:22] what a painful experience for a prophet
[1:42:25] that's why they call him the weeping
[1:42:27] prophet because it pained him to see his
[1:42:30] preaching and the words of Isaiah and
[1:42:31] all the prophets go unheard unanswered
[1:42:34] unresponded to and the people still do
[1:42:36] what they
[1:42:37] want it wasn't easy for Jeremiah he was
[1:42:40] young he had his ministry young and this
[1:42:42] is should be an encouragement to us all
[1:42:43] about predestination because here it was
[1:42:45] in Jeremiah 4 then the word of the Lord
[1:42:48] came unto me saying before I formed thee
[1:42:50] in the belly I knew thee and before thou
[1:42:53] camest forth out of the womb I sanctify
[1:42:56] thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto
[1:42:58] the Nations do you realize that you are
[1:43:00] predestinated before you were even
[1:43:02] formed before you even born God has a
[1:43:04] purpose for your life that the devil
[1:43:05] cannot stop God was comforting Jeremiah
[1:43:08] and said Jeremiah take courage I want
[1:43:10] you to know before I formed the in the
[1:43:12] belly oh Hallelujah I knew thee in other
[1:43:15] words before you were a thought oh
[1:43:17] before come on now before you were an
[1:43:19] expression I knew thee and before thou
[1:43:22] camest for of the womb I Sanctified thee
[1:43:26] and I ordained thee this is an ordained
[1:43:29] Sanctified baby for the church
[1:43:31] Hallelujah Jeremiah is born and he's
[1:43:33] born under a covenant he's born under a
[1:43:36] promise he's born under a
[1:43:38] prophecy Jeremiah would have his
[1:43:40] struggles he would have his ups and
[1:43:43] downs Jeremiah got so depressed he say
[1:43:45] oh God I wish I was never born he said
[1:43:48] cu the day I was born just like how job
[1:43:50] got Jeremiah got into deep depression
[1:43:53] but it didn't change the fact that
[1:43:54] before he was born God knew him his
[1:43:56] depression his frustration his heart
[1:44:01] AE they throw him in prison they threw
[1:44:04] him in a pit and that don't change the
[1:44:06] fact that he was predestinated oh you
[1:44:07] don't hear me this
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:10] morning do you know Jeremiah's own
[1:44:12] family tried to kill
[1:44:15] him in Jeremiah 11 the end of the
[1:44:17] chapter this same the priests that were
[1:44:20] in and a not in the land of Benjamin God
[1:44:22] had to go to Jeremiah to went to God and
[1:44:24] say Lord my old family trying to kill me
[1:44:27] Hallelujah but that don't change the
[1:44:29] fact that he's predestinated it doesn't
[1:44:31] change the fact that he's called it
[1:44:32] doesn't change the fact that there's a
[1:44:33] purpose of man his life and your
[1:44:35] problems your situation your challenges
[1:44:37] doesn't change the fact that there's a
[1:44:38] call upon your life and The God Who
[1:44:41] predestinated you is more than able to
[1:44:43] keep you in your hour of struggle in the
[1:44:46] hour of your ups and downs he said who
[1:44:48] we want you we call who we call he
[1:44:50] justifi who we justify he had already
[1:44:52] glorified those words are past tense God
[1:44:55] is not now listen friends God is not now

[1:45:46] pushed aside and ostracized it doesn't

[1:47:47] Thee the great prophet Isaiah with his
[1:47:50] eagle eyes as a prophet could look
[1:47:52] through and see almost how much years
[1:47:54] would have to pass for a virgin he saw
[1:47:56] Mary carrying that
[1:47:59] baby and he could speak a virgin will
[1:48:02] conceive he could speak over the
[1:48:04] children of Israel he could speak over
[1:48:06] the children of Judah he said hearken
[1:48:08] unto my
[1:48:10] voice turn not your heart away from God
[1:48:13] put away the UN clean
[1:48:15] thing that's the way Isaiah left his
[1:48:17] ministry with words over the people is
[1:48:19] not that they did not know it's not that
[1:48:22] they did not hear
[1:48:29] huj and this was the backdrop under
[1:48:33] which Jeremiah would stand he's young
[1:48:35] he's un certain about himself he's not
[1:48:38] confident he feels unworthy he said God
[1:48:41] you got you somebody else Lord wh me and

[1:49:01] about to take place I couldn't put
[1:49:03] Samuel here I couldn't put Isaiah here I

[1:49:39] in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus say
[1:49:42] the Lord I remember Thee the kindness of
[1:49:45] thy youth the love of thine espousal

[1:49:56] the first fruits of his increase all
[1:49:58] that devour him shall offend evil shall
[1:50:01] come upon them sayeth the Lord hear the
[1:50:03] word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and
[1:50:06] all the families of the House of Israel

[1:50:13] gone away from me here it is God is
[1:50:16] crying to Jeremiah what have I done

[1:50:28] that you turn your heart from
[1:50:30] me God is crying out to Jeremiah tell me
[1:50:33] what I did wrong and I'll fix it because
[1:50:35] I cannot understand how I found you in a
[1:50:38] broken condition and I restored you and

[1:52:28] like a fountain so that the tears that I
[1:52:31] want to cry my eyes can't cry as much as
[1:52:34] I want to
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:36] cry Hallelujah Jeremiah was struggling
[1:52:39] with the humanness of his depth of
[1:52:42] crying he he said I can't cry enough I
[1:52:44] wish my head was like
[1:52:46] waterj and my eyes like a fountain so
[1:52:48] that I could keep crying because it

[1:58:53] I'm not going to read all of it I think
[1:58:55] you're getting the the message
[1:58:59] there so all of this is going on and
[1:59:03] there are five
[1:59:05] kings that Daniel would have served
[1:59:07] under Josiah was the first one he was
[1:59:09] the only good one and then after him was
[1:59:11] his son jeho has who reigned for three
[1:59:15] months before Pharaoh in Egypt if you go
[1:59:17] to Second Kings end of seconds you'll
[1:59:19] see it pharaoh of Egypt came and lock
[1:59:22] him
[1:59:23] up and carry him down to
[1:59:28] Egypt and then they replaced him with
[1:59:31] jeim another son of
[1:59:35] Josiah and it was Pharaoh nro who placed
[1:59:38] him there so it wasn't even the children
[1:59:39] of Judah brother George placing any
[1:59:41] Kings at that point the Egyptians came
[1:59:44] in and say all right this one we are
[1:59:45] like this one now who who is Josiah
[1:59:47] nexton let him put let put him up in in
[1:59:49] in that role there and he served as king
[1:59:51] for 11 years brother
[1:59:54] Clarence then after him was
[1:59:58] jein which was his son who reigned for
[2:00:02] three months and 10 days before nebuchad
[2:00:04] come and lock him
[2:00:05] up and took him down into captiv
[2:00:07] captivity and then the last king of
[2:00:11] Judah which was zedekiah which was
[2:00:14] Josiah's thirdd
[2:00:17] son he was the one who sat
[2:00:19] there and witnessed the fall of
[2:00:23] Jerusalem and the destruction of the
[2:00:27] temple but it's really interesting to
[2:00:29] note that while this is all taking place
[2:00:31] I want you to see a picture because I
[2:00:32] was very excited this morning sharing
[2:00:34] with my wife as she get she get any
[2:00:36] message
[2:00:40] twice brother Nicholas if you could put
[2:00:43] the slide for me with the five Kings the
[2:00:44] last five Kings so these are the last
[2:00:47] five Kings of Judah and many many times
[2:00:49] we look at scripture in isolation we see
[2:00:52] prophets in
[2:00:53] isolation so we hear about Isaiah and
[2:00:57] Jeremiah and Daniel and Ezekiel and
[2:00:59] different things so God is unfolding
[2:01:01] something at the same time so here we
[2:01:03] see here the last five Kings so Josiah
[2:01:05] was the one who cleaned up the
[2:01:07] house and after Josiah was his son who
[2:01:11] robes for who who ruled for about three
[2:01:13] months before he was deposed and after
[2:01:16] him we actually read this scripture you
[2:01:17] may have overlooked it but when joah Kim
[2:01:21] was King that was the first Exile so I
[2:01:24] want you to picture now Jeremiah is
[2:01:26] standing there watching these five Kings
[2:01:28] because he's serving all five Kings his
[2:01:30] ministry was about for about 40 years
[2:01:33] Jeremiah was prophet for about 40 years
[2:01:36] when joah came was King Young
[2:01:40] Daniel is being taken into
[2:01:43] captivity so it means that Daniel is on
[2:01:46] the earth as a young boy because we read
[2:01:49] the script in Daniel that they look for
[2:01:51] children who were bright children of
[2:01:53] science so Jeremiah is on the earth he's
[2:01:56] the major prophet and at the same time a
[2:01:58] young Daniel is not coming into his own
[2:02:01] he's young he's intelligent he's
[2:02:02] talented and he in the first Exile is
[2:02:05] being taken into Babylon jeim after he
[2:02:08] is removed from Power his
[2:02:12] son who they call konian in scripture
[2:02:15] that's when Ezekiel is taken into
[2:02:17] captivity so there's a moving so in we
[2:02:21] we might see in scripture Daniel and
[2:02:23] Ezekiel and Jeremiah but in God's Vision
[2:02:26] he's looking on the
[2:02:28] earth three of them are on the earth at
[2:02:30] the same
[2:02:32] time Jeremiah is in Jerusalem trying to
[2:02:35] get the people to turn their heart back
[2:02:37] to
[2:02:38] God the Bible said Ezekiel is captured
[2:02:41] and he's at the river chba we read it
[2:02:44] and Daniel is in the temple he's in the
[2:02:46] courts of Babylon so for around 10 Years
[2:02:49] brother the punch all three are on the
[2:02:51] earth Jeremiah is trying to get the
[2:02:53] people to turn their heart he's in
[2:02:54] Jerusalem Ezekiel is in the banks in the
[2:02:56] river his prophetic Ministry Rising he
[2:02:58] said there I was in captivity on the
[2:03:00] banks of the chba river and the Lord
[2:03:02] came to me and Young Daniel there is in
[2:03:06] the courts of Babylon being groomed into
[2:03:08] Power oh can the church say
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:12] amen and in isolation those in Jerusalem
[2:03:15] just seeing the Jerusalem picture those
[2:03:17] with Ezekiel now bear in mind Ezekiel
[2:03:19] Ministry is an exile Ministry he is
[2:03:21] preaching to captive
[2:03:24] people Jeremiah is preaching to people
[2:03:27] who are free and are still free until
[2:03:29] the final collapse but the word is
[2:03:31] spreading around because Jeremiah's
[2:03:33] Ministry goes abroad so you could read
[2:03:35] Daniel 10 and I was reading the word I
[2:03:37] hear the message Jeremiah preach oh come
[2:03:40] on now these ministers these prophets
[2:03:43] are on the earth within the same
[2:03:45] dispensation and their Ministries are
[2:03:47] overlapping brother Karen just like John
[2:03:49] the Baptist and Jesus on the earth at
[2:03:50] the same time John the Baptist is just 6
[2:03:53] months older than
[2:03:54] Jesus and they're growing up together
[2:03:56] Johnny bapti Jesus they cousins they
[2:03:58] growing up together and then John's
[2:03:59] Ministry starts Jesus is there and for a
[2:04:02] while John has the Baton as it were
[2:04:05] until Jesus comes in the scene and then
[2:04:07] John say wait a minute I must decrease
[2:04:09] so that you could decrease so that you
[2:04:11] could increase right so Jeremiah is
[2:04:13] there first he's older than the other
[2:04:15] two Ezekiel was a young Prophet most
[2:04:17] people see him as an old prophet ezel
[2:04:18] was a young Prophet just like Daniel was
[2:04:20] a young ruler and here it was Jeremiah
[2:04:22] is getting older but at the same time
[2:04:25] Ezekiel is beginning to prophesy and his
[2:04:28] prophecies are significant because the
[2:04:30] prophecy is about context Daniel's words
[2:04:33] is also about context and within all of
[2:04:36] us every time and brother Bram said that
[2:04:38] I have the quotes there it was Jesus in
[2:04:40] Jeremiah it was Jesus in Daniel it was
[2:04:43] Jesus in Ezekiel because God is
[2:04:45] expressing himself and God so fit at
[2:04:48] this time to express himself at the same
[2:04:50] time in Three Sons with three different
[2:04:52] Ministries with three different types of
[2:04:54] messages here it is Jeremiah see get
[2:04:56] your had right you're not yet in bondage
[2:04:58] and here Ezekiel is seeing we in bondage
[2:05:00] but don't
[2:05:03] despair keep your head up what was
[2:05:06] ezekiel's Ministry in in in Exile it's
[2:05:09] not just we preach hear cand these Dry
[2:05:10] Bones live that's a powerful message but
[2:05:12] the reality is he was in Exile saying
[2:05:15] these dry bones that are in Exile we are
[2:05:18] no longer in Jerusalem we are no longer
[2:05:20] in the city we no longer have the temple
[2:05:23] but these Dry
[2:05:24] Bones son of man what do you see I see
[2:05:28] us in bondage I see myself in trouble I
[2:05:30] see my life in sh May the words of
[2:05:33] Ezekiel if you in bondage this morning
[2:05:35] then the words of Ezekiel is for you
[2:05:37] this morning because you're not going to
[2:05:38] stay in Exile oh come on now somebody
[2:05:41] preach back to
[2:05:42] [Applause]
[2:05:45] me can the Church Say Amen
[2:05:50] let's keep
[2:05:54] going I'm just showing you a few things
[2:05:56] Bible
[2:06:00] study so there so so so I also want to
[2:06:02] see you appreciate that the the book of
[2:06:04] Jeremiah is not in chronological order
[2:06:06] so you can't read from one like I hear
[2:06:08] people say I read the Bible cover to
[2:06:10] cover that's not how it works because
[2:06:13] the book of Jeremiah is not sequential 1
[2:06:15] to 52 52 chapters but it's not written
[2:06:17] in order amen so you have to have
[2:06:19] spiritual eyes to understand what
[2:06:20] happened if you don't see the timeline
[2:06:22] then you miss certain things but the
[2:06:24] reality is in the midst of Jeremiah's
[2:06:26] Ministry he goes into this is Jeremiah
[2:06:29] 31:31 behold the days come say the Lord
[2:06:32] that I will make a New Covenant with the
[2:06:34] house of Israel and with the house of
[2:06:36] Judah here it is something begin to
[2:06:38] happen now because God is bringing he is
[2:06:41] deliberately bringing the house of Judah
[2:06:43] to an end in that
[2:06:45] form so this is not but the George just
[2:06:47] a matter of Kings out of God's favor God
[2:06:50] really know that the true heir to the
[2:06:52] throne is coming and the true air to the
[2:06:55] throne will not be a
[2:06:57] man the true heir to the throne is not a
[2:07:00] normal man the true son of David because
[2:07:03] David was promised to be that Throne
[2:07:05] forever can the church say amen and all
[2:07:08] of the Kings went up and down Josiah was
[2:07:10] great but he wasn't the perfect King for
[2:07:12] it and after him it just went downhill
[2:07:14] and from that day the throne has been
[2:07:16] empty waiting for the rightful King no
[2:07:18] wonder when Jesus walked the Earth they
[2:07:20] say son of
[2:07:21] David Son of David because they knew
[2:07:25] that that Throne is empty waited for a
[2:07:27] son of David to sit on oh come on now
[2:07:29] somebody preach back to me no more will
[2:07:31] a man of sin sit on that
[2:07:33] Throne no more will a king that could be
[2:07:36] up and down be on that Throne only the
[2:07:39] King of Kings will sit on that Throne
[2:07:42] can the church say Amen no God will
[2:07:44] trust no man to sit in his throne
[2:07:47] however he said did that over overcome
[2:07:49] will sit with
[2:07:51] me you can't sit there by yourself
[2:07:55] hallelujah what jiah did no other man
[2:07:57] will do but to him that overcome it you
[2:08:00] will sit with me in my
[2:08:11] Throne so it's amazing friends to see
[2:08:13] God work it's mindblowing because
[2:08:16] through judgment you know God told
[2:08:18] Jeremiah to tell zedekiah the last king
[2:08:22] surrender to
[2:08:24] Babylon don't fight it the judgment is
[2:08:28] sure there was a false prophet Hanah
[2:08:32] anybody remember that one Hanah came to
[2:08:34] church but the terrant in the church and
[2:08:36] he came to the chur and said God told me
[2:08:38] he has broken the power of Babylon and
[2:08:41] in two years we'll be
[2:08:45] fine and everybody say Amen
[2:08:53] that message is sound good know
[2:08:55] everybody want to hear that message in
[2:08:56] two years we coming back Glory
[2:09:01] Hallelujah he said th say the Lord in
[2:09:03] two years the power of babon what a
[2:09:06] powerful
[2:09:09] message and and Jeremiah brother
[2:09:11] Clarence put on a wooden yoke on his
[2:09:13] neck to show we have to go into
[2:09:17] bondage
[2:09:19] yes and IAH was so anointed false
[2:09:21] anointed he went and take the Yoke from
[2:09:24] Jeremiah's neck and broke it you see
[2:09:26] Church you see it here we break Babylon
[2:09:29] Babylon is broken if you see the
[2:09:33] convention people run around the
[2:09:35] building people jump and dance they say
[2:09:37] yes see other service end Babylon is
[2:09:39] broken NE touch me Jeremiah stand up
[2:09:42] right there and the Lord told Jeremiah
[2:09:45] go and tell that false prophet that the
[2:09:48] wood yoke you just broke will be
[2:09:51] replaced for an iron Yol that cannot be
[2:09:54] broken and because you have lied about
[2:09:57] what I said this is God saying he will
[2:09:58] die this very Year and that Pro died
[2:10:01] very year because the Judgment was
[2:10:08] sure throughout the Book of Jeremiah he
[2:10:11] talks about war unto the false
[2:10:13] prophet and the false teachers who lie
[2:10:16] saying I had a dream I had a dream I had
[2:10:17] a dream I don't have time to go into it
[2:10:19] now he say saying things people want to
[2:10:23] hear and he goes into what they were
[2:10:25] prophesying is like you know God is a
[2:10:27] good God and you are the neck and and
[2:10:29] and not the tail and above and not
[2:10:31] fantastic preaching but if you need to
[2:10:33] repent
[2:10:34] repent and Jeremiah say they were not
[2:10:36] preaching
[2:10:37] repentance thus say the Lord all is well
[2:10:40] with you he has fil in your life how how
[2:10:42] how how it could be
[2:10:44] well you stacking false gods in your
[2:10:47] house and all is well
[2:10:50] hallu Jeremiah say burn the unclean
[2:10:52] thing kill the filthy thing get it out
[2:10:55] your house the music that not supposed
[2:10:57] to be there the clothes that not
[2:10:58] supposed to be there the friends the
[2:10:59] whatever it is kill
[2:11:05] it and the Hand of judgment is working
[2:11:08] everywhere now because Jeremiah is
[2:11:12] seeing it unfold in his spiritual eyes
[2:11:15] that there's nothing they could do at
[2:11:16] this point to avert it because the
[2:11:18] sovereignty of God is at work because
[2:11:22] God is interested in his throne being
[2:11:24] governed a certain way and he also wants
[2:11:27] a United Kingdom a certain way not the
[2:11:30] United Kingdom of this world can the
[2:11:31] church say
[2:11:33] Amen so let me just go on here could you
[2:11:35] take some
[2:11:37] more I kind of all over the place you
[2:11:39] know I just hoping that somehow but the
[2:11:40] CL find a little piece of good ground
[2:11:45] somewhere Jeremiah 31:31 behold the days
[2:11:48] come say the Lord I will make a New
[2:11:50] Covenant with the house of Israel and
[2:11:51] with the house of Judah notice House of
[2:11:53] Israel and house of Judah God is still
[2:11:54] talking north south at this
[2:11:57] point the two kingdoms The Divided
[2:11:59] kingdoms not according to the Covenant
[2:12:01] that I made with their fathers in the
[2:12:03] day that I took them by the hand you see
[2:12:05] how God sees
[2:12:07] it God say he took them by the hand and
[2:12:09] guide them out you know and you think
[2:12:12] well I overcame you know I I um I
[2:12:16] accomplish and
[2:12:20] and God saying that if I didn't hold you
[2:12:23] and guide you you not make
[2:12:27] it look how God sees it I took them by
[2:12:31] the hand to bring them out of the land
[2:12:34] of Egypt which my Covenant they break
[2:12:38] although I was an husband unto them

[2:13:50] will make with the house of Israel after
[2:13:53] those days said the Lord I will put my
[2:13:55] law in their inward paths in other words

[2:14:35] people can the church say
[2:14:38] amen
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:43] glory so I want you to see now this is
[2:14:46] Jeremiah's prophecy see his message is
[2:14:49] connecting to the suffering Ministry
[2:14:52] that Isaiah preached about to a change
[2:14:54] that is to come to a Messianic order
[2:14:56] that have to come and and and and and
[2:14:58] and Jeremiah picks it up meanwhile in
[2:15:01] bondage with the cence in captivity
[2:15:04] Ezekiel day oh God me Lord why I in
[2:15:07] budget I'm a prophet why you let it take
[2:15:10] me why
[2:15:15] didn't that's not how Ezekiel was
[2:15:21] I just love how God and and and and it's
[2:15:23] not these bir dinner the struggles you
[2:15:26] know in the
[2:15:28] middle woo but the punch like you want
[2:15:30] to help me this morning the scripture
[2:15:32] you read there Ezekiel 1 now it came to
[2:15:35] pass in the 30th year in the fourth
[2:15:36] month in the fifth day of the month as I
[2:15:39] was among the captives he complaining
[2:15:42] about being among the captives he said I
[2:15:44] was among the captives by the river of
[2:15:45] Chiba that the heavens were opened oh
[2:15:48] God for the heaven to open up in the
[2:15:50] midst of my captive circumstance in the
[2:15:53] midst of my situation that I can't
[2:15:55] understand in the midst of my turmoil my
[2:15:57] distress my pain my suffering oh if the
[2:16:00] heaven would open up for me and that is
[2:16:02] what Ezekiel experien and I saw visions
[2:16:05] of
[2:16:07] God verse three and the word of the Lord
[2:16:10] came expressly un
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:14] Ezekiel let's go to Ezekiel 37 familiar
[2:16:17] St
[2:16:18] I know you know these things but I want
[2:16:20] you to see the picture now brother the C
[2:16:22] Jeremiah is in his position Ezekiel is
[2:16:25] in his position Daniel is coming into
[2:16:27] position and God just like now the holy
[2:16:31] spirit is setting in order the coming of
[2:16:32] the Lord he need Jeremiah where he's at
[2:16:35] he need Ezekiel to minister to those in
[2:16:37] Exile he need Daniel to be in the palace
[2:16:39] because Daniel have a part to play in
[2:16:41] this unfolding
[2:16:44] [Music]
[2:16:45] mystery in the midst of Exile Ezekiel is
[2:16:48] saying the hand of the Lord was upon me
[2:16:50] and carried me out in the spirit of the
[2:16:53] Lord and set me down in the midst of the
[2:16:55] valley which is full of Bones and caused
[2:16:58] me to pass by them round about and
[2:17:00] behold there were very many in the open
[2:17:02] Valley and lo they were very dry and he
[2:17:05] said unto me son of man in other words
[2:17:07] Prophet you are Prophet just like the
[2:17:09] other prophets can these bones live and
[2:17:12] I answered oh Lord God thou knowest no I
[2:17:14] want you to see the context a man in
[2:17:16] prison a man in Exile he's being
[2:17:18] challenged in the midst of your prison
[2:17:21] is there hope is there Resurrection is
[2:17:22] there restoration is there Redemption is
[2:17:25] there hope is there a
[2:17:27] possibility again he said unto me
[2:17:29] prophesy upon these bones and say to
[2:17:31] them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of
[2:17:33] the Lord thus say the Lord God unto
[2:17:35] these bones behold I will cause bread to
[2:17:38] enter into you and you shall live and I
[2:17:40] will lay sin news upon you and will
[2:17:42] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[2:17:45] with skin and put breath in you God is
[2:17:47] telling him listen it might look bad
[2:17:50] Jerusalem might be becoming desolate the
[2:17:52] temple might be in Ruins but I will
[2:17:54] restore say the Lord all the years of
[2:17:57] the cankerworm and the caterpillar and
[2:17:59] the Locust and the Palmer wor I will
[2:18:01] restore I will restore I will restore
[2:18:03] and ye shall live and ye shall know that
[2:18:05] I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was
[2:18:09] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[2:18:11] a noise and behold a shaking and the
[2:18:14] bones came together a bone to his bone
[2:18:16] it was not restoration it wasn't a oh
[2:18:20] come on now it wasn't a a happening in
[2:18:22] secret no there was a noise there was a
[2:18:25] shaking may this morning we have a noise
[2:18:28] and may we have a shaking as bone come
[2:18:32] together to bone as the pieces of your
[2:18:34] life begin to come back together if you
[2:18:37] are in Exile this morning this word is
[2:18:39] for you if you are in bondage this
[2:18:41] morning may the words of Ezekiel speak
[2:18:43] to your heart if you are in sin this
[2:18:46] morning may the words of Jeremiah call
[2:18:49] upon you to repent unto
[2:18:50] [Applause]
[2:18:56] God and when I beheld lo the senu and
[2:18:59] the flesh came up upon them and the skin
[2:19:01] covered them above but there was no
[2:19:03] breath in them then he said unto me
[2:19:05] prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
[2:19:07] man and say to the wind thus sayth the
[2:19:09] Lord God come from the for winds o
[2:19:12] breath and breathe upon the slain that
[2:19:14] they may live so I prophesied as he
[2:19:16] commanded me and the breath came into
[2:19:19] them and they lived and stood up upon
[2:19:21] their feet an exceeding great Army then
[2:19:24] he said unto me son of man listen now to
[2:19:27] the context of it go we preach this
[2:19:28] message but I want you to see the
[2:19:29] context of a man in Exile

[2:19:38] ruin Israel has been in bondage for
[2:19:41] years under the Assyrians the
[2:19:43] Babylonians would take them
[2:19:45] over so now we give the context of
[2:19:49] this then he said unto me son of man
[2:19:51] these bones are the whole house of
[2:19:56] Israel behold they say our bones are
[2:19:59] dried and our hope is lost we are cut
[2:20:03] off for our
[2:20:04] paths therefore prophesy and sayto them
[2:20:07] thus sayth the Lord God behold oh my
[2:20:10] people I will open your Graves and cause
[2:20:14] you to come up out of your Graves and
[2:20:16] bring you into the land of Israel and ye
[2:20:18] shall know that I am the Lord when I
[2:20:21] have opened your Graves oh my people and
[2:20:23] brought you up out of your Graves and
[2:20:26] shall put my spirit in you and he shall
[2:20:29] live and I shall place you in your own
[2:20:31] land then shall ye know that I the Lord
[2:20:34] have spoken it and performed it sayeth
[2:20:37] the Lord the word of the Lord came unto
[2:20:39] me saying moreover thou son of man take
[2:20:42] thee one stick and write upon it
[2:20:45] Hallelujah listen for Judah and for the
[2:20:48] children of Israel his companions then
[2:20:50] take another stick and write upon it for
[2:20:53] Joseph The Stick of Ephraim and for all
[2:20:56] the house of Israel his companions and
[2:20:59] join them one to another into one stick
[2:21:03] and they shall become one in thine hand
[2:21:06] and when the children of thy people
[2:21:08] shall speak unto thee saying will thou
[2:21:10] not show us what thou meanest by these
[2:21:13] say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God
[2:21:16] behold I will take the Stick of Joseph
[2:21:19] which is in the hand of Ephraim and the
[2:21:22] tribe of Israel his fellows and will put
[2:21:24] them with him even with the Stick of
[2:21:26] Judah what is it God restoring the two
[2:21:31] kingdoms this problem that started
[2:21:34] centuries before that divided north and
[2:21:36] south after Ezekiel passing the battle
[2:21:39] after Jeremiah passing the battle to
[2:21:41] Ezekiel Ezekiel is saying the mission of
[2:21:44] Jeremiah is finished now now e saying
[2:21:47] let's unite north and
[2:21:50] south and make them one stick and they
[2:21:53] shall be one in mine hand and the sticks
[2:21:56] whereon thou rightest shall be in thine
[2:21:58] hand before their eyes and say unto them
[2:22:01] thus sayth the Lord God behold I will
[2:22:03] take the children of Israel from among
[2:22:05] the Heathen whether they be gone I will
[2:22:07] gather them on every side and bring them
[2:22:08] into their own land and I will make them
[2:22:11] one nation in the land upon the
[2:22:14] mountains of Israel and one King shall
[2:22:17] be king to them all and they shall no
[2:22:20] more two be there shall be no more two
[2:22:23] kingdoms neither shall be divided into
[2:22:27] two kingdoms anymore at
[2:22:30] [Music]
[2:22:33] all so what is it through all this God
[2:22:36] is unfolding the restoration of his
[2:22:39] people you
[2:22:40] know what man destroyed man destroyed
[2:22:43] the throne man destroyed the kingdom and
[2:22:45] God is saying through this whole journey
[2:22:46] here I'm showing you that I'm working a
[2:22:48] plan of restoration to unite north and
[2:22:51] south to unite brothers who were Shak
[2:22:53] hand in a long time to unite brothers
[2:22:55] who preach different Doctrine because
[2:22:56] they didn't want the other one to be in
[2:22:58] the temple with the other one because
[2:22:59] that how the problem start I'm going to
[2:23:01] die the Lord will do it I had to send
[2:23:03] them into Graves so I could pick up the
[2:23:06] pieces myself because I can't leave man
[2:23:08] to do this thing this Unity will not be
[2:23:10] a man-made Unity this Unity will not be
[2:23:13] a Unity by agreement a Unity by
[2:23:16] convention a Unity by Arrangement it
[2:23:18] will be thus sayeth the Lord I myself
[2:23:21] will do oh come on
[2:23:26] now and it goes on neither shall they
[2:23:29] defile themselves anymore with their
[2:23:30] Idols nor with their detestable things
[2:23:33] nor with any of their transgression but
[2:23:35] I will save them out of all their
[2:23:37] Dwelling Places wherein they have sinned
[2:23:39] and will cleanse them so shall they be
[2:23:42] my people and I will be their God and
[2:23:44] listen to him now now David dead years
[2:23:46] ago
[2:23:48] and David my servant shall be king over
[2:23:52] them who who you talking about there now
[2:23:56] how about King Jesus King Jesus shall be
[2:24:00] king over them and they shall have they
[2:24:02] shall all have one
[2:24:07] Shepherd talking about the great
[2:24:08] Shepherd and they shall also walk in my
[2:24:10] judgments and observe my statutes and do
[2:24:13] them and they shall dwell in the land
[2:24:15] that I have given unto Jacob my son
[2:24:17] servant wherein your fathers have dwelt
[2:24:19] and they shall dwell there and even they
[2:24:20] and their children and their children
[2:24:22] children forever and my servant David
[2:24:25] shall be their prince forever moreover I
[2:24:27] will make a covenant of peace with them
[2:24:29] it shall be an Everlasting Covenant with
[2:24:32] them and I will place them and multiply
[2:24:34] them and will set my sanctuary in the
[2:24:37] midst of them forever more my Tabernacle
[2:24:40] also shall be with them yeah I will be
[2:24:42] their God and they shall be my people
[2:24:45] and the Heathen shall know that I am the
[2:24:47] Lord that I the Lord do sanctify Israel
[2:24:50] When My Sanctuary shall be in the midst
[2:24:53] of them forever may the Lord bless his
[2:24:55] word can the church say
[2:25:00] Amen what does just show us in the midst
[2:25:03] of the Exile God is moving things around
[2:25:07] to do what he spoke to Jeremiah about
[2:25:10] these broken systems these man-made
[2:25:12] agendas these man-made Creeds this
[2:25:14] man-made separation this manade made two
[2:25:17] Kingdom it was manmade the split of the
[2:25:20] kingdom was
[2:25:21] man it was man who caused all his
[2:25:24] problem you know the whole problem is
[2:25:27] and this is this is this is so I not
[2:25:29] preaching about Jeremiah preaching about
[2:25:30] now time you
[2:25:34] know if you're just a little spiritual
[2:25:36] you'll see it to
[2:25:37] know is man is the problem and God is
[2:25:41] saying I not putting no man on no throne
[2:25:43] and putting no man to run is King David
[2:25:46] is only David is King there's only one
[2:25:49] king no Pastor is King no Prophet is
[2:25:52] King no Apostle is King no fivefold
[2:25:54] Ministry is King it's just one king and
[2:25:55] his name is
[2:25:58] Jesus he's the son of David he's the one
[2:26:01] who is legally authorized to sit on the
[2:26:03] throne of David have the Key of David
[2:26:07] can the Church Say
[2:26:08] [Applause]
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:10] [Applause]
[2:26:15] Amen
[2:26:17] so what we are trying to connect here
[2:26:19] friends as I'm getting ready I'm getting
[2:26:21] ready to wind down this thing I leave
[2:26:23] out quite a bit we have to there's some
[2:26:25] things in here we we need to unpack at
[2:26:26] in another time it'll just be too much
[2:26:28] for this service but I want you to
[2:26:31] appreciate from my title as I pull it
[2:26:33] together this is Jeremiah's prophetic
[2:26:36] Bridge so Jeremiah was a bridge between
[2:26:40] the last great major prophet Isaiah who
[2:26:42] was there to see the kingdoms in
[2:26:44] operation to the want to bridge into the
[2:26:47] ministry of Ezekiel andto Daniel and I'm
[2:26:49] showing you here that there was a period
[2:26:51] of around 10 years when Jeremiah Ezekiel
[2:26:54] and Daniel they all on the Earth all
[2:26:57] playing their part in this great drama
[2:27:00] this unfolding Plan of Redemption that
[2:27:02] God is doing and the reality is by the
[2:27:05] time we reach here now to Daniel as B
[2:27:07] said it this morning that Daniel was
[2:27:10] reading books from
[2:27:13] Jeremiah he had a
[2:27:15] quotes he fellowshipping on the revealed
[2:27:18] word because the word only come to the
[2:27:21] prophet and if you have the word of the
[2:27:23] Prophet then it could rest your your
[2:27:24] your your whole message on the word of
[2:27:26] the Prophet can the church say Amen so
[2:27:29] now we find now in this whole plan
[2:27:31] there's nothing in it that God don't
[2:27:32] want to change because he already see
[2:27:34] this thing play out yes I was preaching
[2:27:36] in Germany I said in God's mind golad
[2:27:38] was already dead you know David was just
[2:27:41] there to make the tape play for
[2:27:45] us
[2:27:48] in God mind Goliath done head rolling
[2:27:50] and things like okay pause pause rewind
[2:27:51] rewind David now
[2:27:53] reach let me watch it in real
[2:27:55] time he said don't go too far ahead I a
[2:27:58] teacher say don't go to don't go too far
[2:28:00] ahead the class let me let
[2:28:02] me all this this service already in God
[2:28:05] Mighty service done listen you know God
[2:28:06] already see you
[2:28:09] adopted in God's tape you done listen
[2:28:12] you done overcome all them lust and them
[2:28:14] them thing that stressing you out you
[2:28:16] mash them already you
[2:28:19] know all them little demons that in
[2:28:23] God's tape that's why he could you said
[2:28:24] who we phone we call you Call justify
[2:28:26] already glorify you there fighting up
[2:28:28] it's past tense to God God already at
[2:28:30] your tape your name there your your seat
[2:28:33] your how you walking on go you raining
[2:28:35] on the Earth all that already play out
[2:28:37] and he say oh gosh why did you hurry up
[2:28:39] and do the thing faster because it's
[2:28:41] your promise you buil for it you
[2:28:43] designed for it you're not from this
[2:28:45] world you're creature of eternity
[2:28:47] trapped in time to just express the
[2:28:49] thoughts of God in your day and in your
[2:28:52] season is this helping anybody this
[2:28:54] [Applause]
[2:28:59] morning I'm getting ready to close out
[2:29:02] just a little teaching little Sunday
[2:29:04] school Sunday school message so now
[2:29:07] Daniel how to have to finish his part
[2:29:09] now here now because God was here
[2:29:12] contending but the George for his throne
[2:29:14] he wiped out man from his throne amen
[2:29:17] no Israel was never to have a king in
[2:29:19] the first
[2:29:21] place it was man's idea to put a king
[2:29:24] but God always wanted a
[2:29:31] throne so the throne was already planned
[2:29:34] there's a quote where brother brandham
[2:29:36] said it's a serious quote that the devil
[2:29:38] was was in heaven and the devil knew
[2:29:40] things in
[2:29:42] them and the devil tried to kind of
[2:29:45] because of he knew you think try to kind
[2:29:47] of go around the plan of God we'll get
[2:29:49] into that in the next
[2:29:51] message to see how he could he he know
[2:29:54] kingship come in he know rulership he
[2:29:56] understand jurisdiction he knew that a
[2:29:59] man had to sit and and and this Earth
[2:30:01] belongs to man and he understood these
[2:30:02] things so the devil is who choke the
[2:30:04] people get a king get a king get a
[2:30:07] king to try to to kind of Sidetrack the
[2:30:11] plan of God but you can't Sidetrack the
[2:30:13] plan of God God allow that whole thing
[2:30:16] to play out because the ambition of man
[2:30:19] existed before that King come the
[2:30:20] ambition of man goes all the way back to
[2:30:22] Genesis to the Tower of Babel with man
[2:30:23] wanted to rule over himself and live in
[2:30:25] heaven and re on the earth and all that
[2:30:27] stuff God already see the Affairs of man
[2:30:30] back to the days of Noah he said every
[2:30:32] was it was just filthy in in man's heart
[2:30:35] evil was in his heart
[2:30:40] continually so God allowed the Throne of
[2:30:44] Judah the Throne of David
[2:30:47] the king seat in Jerusalem to be empty
[2:30:50] Jerusalem becomes desolate broken down
[2:30:51] we did the study of Nehemiah because
[2:30:53] nemiah will come afterwards to rebuild
[2:30:56] the
[2:30:58] walls so we did I want to see the
[2:31:00] connected pieces but nobody was ever
[2:31:03] called King after King that last king in
[2:31:06] Judah there was no King ever came after
[2:31:08] that King so Jeremiah stood and watched
[2:31:11] the last king another way the title say
[2:31:13] the last king of Judah because after
[2:31:16] that King Jeremiah stood and witness
[2:31:18] fall no other king sat on the
[2:31:22] throne but when Jesus walked the Earth
[2:31:26] those who were spiritual Hallelujah son
[2:31:28] of David Hallelujah this looking like
[2:31:31] one who could sit in a throne and we
[2:31:33] it's been a while we're looking for but
[2:31:35] he's also son of man he's also he's saw
[2:31:38] that this is the lion of the tribe of
[2:31:40] Judah is that a see son of David Son of
[2:31:44] son of Abraham son of Son of Man Son of
[2:31:46] God everything wrapped up because Christ
[2:31:49] was the mystery of God revealed what was
[2:31:51] hidden in Jeremiah and Moses and in
[2:31:53] every age was captured in that man
[2:31:55] called
[2:31:56] [Applause]
[2:32:02] Jesus and a consistent message Jesus
[2:32:05] preached was the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[2:32:09] hand he didn't say a church is at hand
[2:32:11] no he said the kingdom is at
[2:32:13] hand because he came to introduce a
[2:32:16] kingdom
[2:32:17] establish a kingdom a kingdom that
[2:32:19] couldn't be moved a kingdom that
[2:32:21] couldn't be
[2:32:22] [Applause]
[2:32:31] destroyed so Jeremiah is there on the
[2:32:34] earth and a young boy named Daniel is
[2:32:38] being led away in the first
[2:32:41] Exile Ezekiel is still in Jerusalem but
[2:32:45] Young Daniel
[2:32:47] is head down to Babylon for three years
[2:32:50] he is eating good food for three years
[2:32:54] he's learning the language of the Chans
[2:32:57] for three years his intellectual
[2:32:59] aptitude his political Acumen his
[2:33:03] economic fortitude and his management
[2:33:05] ability distinguishes him from all the
[2:33:08] young men of his
[2:33:10] day it allows him access because of his
[2:33:13] nature his intelligence his character
[2:33:15] and his lineage to walk into the courts
[2:33:17] of Nebuchadnezzar and attract the
[2:33:19] attention of
[2:33:21] royalty in so much that when he Nez has
[2:33:25] a
[2:33:27] dream he say I will chop off people head
[2:33:30] here today if only at what going
[2:33:34] on because this thing stress him out I
[2:33:36] sleeping with this
[2:33:42] thing and
[2:33:44] Daniel S the Lord
[2:33:49] concerning the
[2:33:51] matterall and Daniel goes now this is
[2:33:54] the last piece of this puzzle between
[2:33:56] Jeremiah Ezekiel Daniel started with
[2:33:59] Isaiah about his restoration because
[2:34:02] Samuel was the one who was there who
[2:34:03] started the kingship unwillingly but
[2:34:05] Isaiah was speaking now of a king that
[2:34:07] would come a messiah that would come a
[2:34:08] virgin that would keep he's hinting at
[2:34:10] it he's hinting at it just the king
[2:34:12] kingship but not the kingdom
[2:34:15] yet Jeremiah whatt this is the fall of
[2:34:17] the Kingdom Ezekiel speaking to the
[2:34:19] people not preparing them for a kingdom
[2:34:21] to come a kingdom to have a new law and
[2:34:23] a new covenant and Daniel is there now
[2:34:25] trying to pill the pieces together in
[2:34:27] Daniel
[2:34:29] 2:31 and he begins to speak about this
[2:34:32] image Daniel 2:31 thou oh King sawest
[2:34:36] and behold a great image this great
[2:34:38] image whose brightness was excellent
[2:34:40] stood before thee and the form thereof
[2:34:42] was terrible this image's head was a
[2:34:45] fine gold his breast and his arms of
[2:34:48] silver his belly and his thighs of brass
[2:34:50] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[2:34:52] and part of clay thou sawest that till a
[2:34:55] stone was cut out without hands which SM
[2:34:59] the image upon his feet that were of
[2:35:01] iron and clay and break them to Pieces
[2:35:03] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[2:35:05] silver and the gold broken into pieces
[2:35:07] together and became like the chaff of
[2:35:09] the summer trashing floors and the wind
[2:35:11] carried them away that no place was
[2:35:13] found for them and the stone that smed
[2:35:15] the image became a great mountain and
[2:35:17] filled the whole
[2:35:19] earth this is the dream and we will tell
[2:35:23] the interpretation thereof before the
[2:35:25] king thou oh king art a king of kings
[2:35:30] notice the lowercase King of Kings for
[2:35:32] the god of Heaven listen ha given thee a
[2:35:35] kingdom because when you read Jeremiah
[2:35:38] the Lord through Jeremiah speaks of my
[2:35:42] servant
[2:35:43] Nebuchadnezzar just like where the
[2:35:45] terrant would have spoken my servant
[2:35:47] Cyrus God used these men to help address
[2:35:52] the agenda of God's kingdom being
[2:35:56] established God allowed man Kingdom to
[2:35:58] rise so he could cut it down so he said
[2:36:01] thou oh King at King of Kings for the
[2:36:03] god of Heaven had given thee a kingdom
[2:36:06] power and strength and glory amen so
[2:36:09] this head of gold had to be established
[2:36:10] for this to be the head of gold Israel
[2:36:13] had to be
[2:36:13] captured they had to be subjected they
[2:36:16] had to be in Babylon there couldn't be
[2:36:17] another Kingdom operating in that way to
[2:36:20] challenge his headship of gold this is
[2:36:23] why jermiah would tell the Kings listen
[2:36:27] surrender let we behave yourself because
[2:36:30] this is God's plan you might understand
[2:36:32] it now but God want you to go through
[2:36:34] this purification this process can the
[2:36:37] church say amen and wheresoever the
[2:36:39] children of men dwell the Beast of the
[2:36:41] field and the fowls of the heaven had he
[2:36:43] given into thine hand and had made the
[2:36:44] ruler over them all thou art this head
[2:36:47] of gold and after the shall arise
[2:36:49] another kingdom inferior to thee and
[2:36:52] another third Kingdom of brass which
[2:36:54] shall bear rule over all the earth and
[2:36:56] the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as
[2:36:58] iron for as much as iron breaking in
[2:37:00] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[2:37:03] iron that break it all these shall it
[2:37:04] break into pieces and bruise and whereas
[2:37:07] thou so is the feet and toast part of
[2:37:09] clay and part of iron the kingdom shall
[2:37:11] be divided that that that there shall be
[2:37:13] in it of the strength of the iron for as
[2:37:15] much as thou sawest the iron mixed with
[2:37:17] Mary clay and as the toes of the feet
[2:37:19] were part of iron and part of clay so
[2:37:22] the kingdom shall be partly strong and
[2:37:25] partly broken and whereas thou sawest
[2:37:28] iron mixed with Mary clay they shall
[2:37:30] mingle themselves with the seed of men
[2:37:32] but they shall not cleave one to another
[2:37:34] even as iron is not mixed with clay and
[2:37:37] in the days of these Kings shall the god
[2:37:40] of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall
[2:37:43] never be destroyed and the kingdom shall
[2:37:45] shall not be left to other people but it
[2:37:48] shall break in pieces and consume all
[2:37:50] these kingdoms and it shall stand
[2:37:52] forever for as much as thou saw that
[2:37:55] that stone was cut out of the mountain
[2:37:57] without hands and that it break in
[2:37:59] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[2:38:01] silver and the gold the great God had
[2:38:03] made known to the king what shall come
[2:38:05] to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[2:38:08] certain and the interpretation thereof
[2:38:12] sure then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell
[2:38:14] upon his face and worshiped Daniel and
[2:38:17] commanded that they should offer an
[2:38:18] oblation and sweet orders unto him the
[2:38:21] king answered unto Daniel and said offer
[2:38:23] truth it is that your God is a god of
[2:38:25] gods that's the best thing he could
[2:38:27] describe because he can't he had no
[2:38:29] other words to he said this God is a
[2:38:30] different God this had to be the god of
[2:38:32] gods and a lord of kings and a revealer
[2:38:35] of Secrets seeing thou couldest reveal
[2:38:38] his secret then the king made Daniel a
[2:38:40] great man and gave him many great gifts
[2:38:43] and made him ruler over the whole
[2:38:44] province of Babylon and chief of the
[2:38:46] governors over all the wise men of
[2:38:48] Babylon this is in the Captivity here
[2:38:50] and then Daniel requested of the king
[2:38:52] and he said Shadrach mesach and Abednego
[2:38:54] over the Affairs of the province of
[2:38:56] Babylon but Daniel sat in the gate of
[2:38:59] the king so I was there read I say look
[2:39:01] look how God is good Jeremiah on the
[2:39:03] earth Ezekiel on the earth Daniel even
[2:39:05] Shad Mish and all there at the same time
[2:39:08] this whole thing is unfolding God's Plan
[2:39:11] of Redemption his plan of getting back
[2:39:13] on the throne his plan of establishing a
[2:39:15] kingdom God speaking about the the
[2:39:17] Babylonians giving away to the Ms and
[2:39:18] the Persians the Greeks on to the Romans
[2:39:20] military Rome again spiritual Rome the
[2:39:22] whole plan and then that stone cut
[2:39:24] without the hands of man striking the
[2:39:26] image a kingdom that cannot be moved a
[2:39:29] throne that will have his rightful King
[2:39:30] on the throne King Jesus that a king
[2:39:32] that will be established forever how
[2:39:34] happy ought we to be that we are part of
[2:39:37] the citizenry of that Kingdom that we
[2:39:39] are part of the economy of that Kingdom
[2:39:41] that we are royal members of that
[2:39:44] Kingdom
[2:39:46] and because there's a king of kings we
[2:39:48] could be king priests royal priesthood
[2:39:51] because the king priest sits on the
[2:39:53] throne can the church say Amen I'm
[2:39:55] finished this morning musician get ready
[2:39:57] I trust you're feeling fine this morning
[2:40:00] to know that his great plan of God that
[2:40:02] he started way back when man fell in
[2:40:04] Genesis every mistake that man made
[2:40:07] every fall that man made God saw it all
[2:40:10] and he put provision in place and he
[2:40:12] sent prophets through the book of
