brother anthony for the message this morning what a blessing amen and uh i heard a tremendous report from the meeting in uganda they had a revival and the revival is on the revival is on they're having quite a time by now the meeting is over and it's only been a tremendous report so but it will uh give further details when he comes in this week you pray for him to get strength he wants to preach at the church on sunday coming so you pray for him amen the enemy is going to attack but anthony said we have something to do as well amen and he can only attack this body for so long after a while his body is going to be changed into a body that he can't mess with into a body that he can touch in a body that can never be sick in a body that i could never feel tired in a body that could never feel depressed in a body that can never be frustrated can the church say i don't know what kind of service we're going to have this evening with anthony but i'm just here to introduce the communion service so before when the stephen comes we could talk about jesus a little bit we could shout about jesus a little bit we could rejoice because god sent a prophet and we have an opportunity for redemption we have an opportunity for your adoption we have an opportunity for perfection for the baptism of the holy ghost to give the devil a run to push back the darkness can the church say amen i don't care if it's five people if it's 50 people or 500 people satan one is a majority in god give me one person tonight who's not afraid to worship give me one person tonight who wants to make a church that would make a revival that's the kind of church i want to be in oh glory you may be seated for a few minutes hallelujah i'm tired of seeing the church members walk in and out so i love certain services i love the thursday prayer meetings because on a thursday night you see the real church you want to see the church you call a prayer meeting those who want to hold on to the horns of the altar and say lord i'm not going to let you go until you change me hallelujah those willing to go above and beyond for the sake of the cross hallelujah forget the world forget your job tomorrow forget all your problems and your pills we come to live jesus higher lift him higher lift him higher so that all the world could see can the church say amen hey amen i silly when agreed brother george kangali for the exhortation on thursday night what a blessing what a real real real tremendous tremendous blessing i told him afterwards i said brother george i was blessed you know when he said something that was really it stayed with me you know he was speaking about the parable that jesus gave about the soul that went forth to sow and some fell on the wayside and some fell on the thorny but some fell on good ground and and he brought to my remembrance the fact that he said when he said listen god is not coming to see the seed he sowed the seeds are coming to say what you did with the seed he's coming to see fruit that's what this is all about to see fruit that after all these years there's fruit in your life there's joy in your life there's peace in your life there's victory in your life there's long suffering in your life there's meekness in your life and listen for it to have fruit things have to come against you to make the fruit stand out you have to have something to be long suffering about the situation have to come to pull out the meekness to pull out the humility so count yourself blessed tonight for the situations that god sent your way that you could have some long suffering that he would have patience that you could have virtue glory to god glory to god hallelujah you may be seated we have to reframe how we look at the problems because no problem can come your way unless god allowed it so count yourself blessed because the problem you have is what god allowed you to have to bring something out of you listen god couldn't give your problems to anybody else they couldn't handle it come on brother kangalei god couldn't give your triumph to the person next to you your trial was designed for you your trial is your trial and you are going to overcome you are going to be victorious hallelujah hallelujah glory to khan you may be seated i'm just here to encourage your fate just encourage your faith a little bit so when the pastor comes back he can look at the church and we can say we were good stewards hallelujah understand this we make it seem like the trial and the test is so big and such a problem and god is saying you don't even know the strength on the inside i wanted to give this problem to somebody else and i was looking for somebody to give this glory for a long time i wanted to see somebody go through this kind of thing and still have a testimony like job hallelujah told the skin worms destroying my body yet in my flesh i'm gonna see god doesn't matter what the doctor says doesn't matter what the neighbor says doesn't matter what my wife said doesn't matter what the children say i'm going to serve god anyhow hallelujah glory i will i see some i certainly see some more smiles and i did a few minutes ago so somebody was struggling with a trial somebody was struggling with a problem and i listen if the devil is not attacking you you should be very worried if all hell isn't against you you should be very concerned because all hell is against the elect of god if the devil is not after you you might be on his side but if you woke up this morning and your car didn't want to start and all four tires were flat and there was no power to iron the clothes and you just didn't know how you're going to make it through the day count yourself blessed because the devil is chill trying to stop you and listen if he's trying to stop you it means he hasn't stopped you yet if you're still trying it means there's still some life in you there's still some faith in you they're still ah glory to god hallelujah you may be seated you know son of man look at the soldiers of the cross who've been in the battle a long time and sometimes when you're in a battle a long time you get kind of battle weary get kind of battle scarred you've seen so much fights you've seen so much soldiers fall along the way side you you just almost put yourself in a position where you just buy it in time but i got good news for you to see them there are some people who are just going to barely make it but they're going to make it but the platinum said when you look around heaven you're going to look at a bunch of people who you made it you make i i don't want to say i didn't think you could make it but you made it when it looked like it wasn't gonna make it you're gonna make it when it looked like the honey not gonna stick it don't stick when it looked like the devil got you in the corner there's gonna be your power watch the third pull then watch the power of this church rise glory to god so count yourselves blessed for the specially designed trials god didn't just throw the child he took his time to configure the trial to fit your need so that the best could come out of you because he's going to have a bride that you could say whatever you want about her she's still going to have love you could curse her she's still gonna forgive you could do whatever you want but it's not gonna be seed it's gonna be fruit the fruit will remain the fruit will escape the fruit will be the evidence that you have met jesus can the church say amen i don't know if to finish or have to start preaching but can we stand our feet two portions of scripture we're going to read from the book of ecclesiastes and the book of revelation thank you musicians we're going to read from ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 1 and we're going to read from the book of revelation chapter 8 amen i certainly appreciate everyone here this evening to have the confidence that we are not here to see a man but we are here to see the lord you know i tell people all the time you look in the corporate world you always know when the boss is not in a building there's a certain behavior that people operate with when the boss is not in the building and the holy spirit takes special note how you behave in the past is that in the house because your accountability is not to brother over in the flesh your accountability is to god the holy spirit we're not here to see any man you're not here to see brother over with the anthony myself you hear that hear direct from god we are merely instruments god could use anybody to speak the word because brother branham said one day the right word will be spoken and god could use anybody to speak the word so i commend your fate and your confidence to be here today for these two services and for your prayer and support for the ministry can the church say amen the book of ecclesiastes chapter three and verse one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and the time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace and reading from the book of revelation 8 and reading verse 1. and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated i have a title this evening and my title is breaking the silence my title is breaking the silence and for a subject the spoken word in due season and an inspiration the final voice to the final age and in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but the madam said it is my humble belief that we're living near the end time oh may i make it a little more personal than that we are living in the end time and i believe it's time for restoration of the church that was promised that god would sin in the last day and i believe that this is the day that when the world has been preached so much and the day has gotten so dark and so evil until according to god's word he was to restore all that the caterpillar had eaten the palmer worm had eaten will be restored back again do you believe that this evening so tonight or this heat we're going to speak a bit about silence because the bible said is a time to keep silence and there is a time to speak there are a lot that's written about silence said that a a fool when he is silent is considered wise because he doesn't say anything that exposes what's really on the inside but silence is defined as an absence of words or an absence of noise you know and uh there was a gentleman by the name of martin nimola who was born in germany in 1892 he would later become a famous lutheran pastor and he is best known for how he addressed the issue of silence in his day by his very famous following words and these are his words first they came for the socialists and i did not speak out because i was not a socialist then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me he was imprisoned in concentration comes from 1937 to 1945 for coming against the german nazi regime he narrowly escaped execution and barely survived imprisonment but after his imprisonment he expresses deep regret about not having done enough to help the victims of the nazis he regretted that he had been silent about something that he had the power to speak up about tonight we want to speak about breaking the silence now there are different types of silence there's a silence that exists as a result of fear you become so afraid that you're afraid to speak there is a silence that exists as a result of shame you feel so embarrassed you're afraid to speak there is a silence that exists because of ignorance you just don't know so you stay silent you don't know quite what to say there is a silence that exists as a defense you don't want anybody to reach you so you are silent you put up these walls in your job walls in the church these walls of silence that exist that nobody could reach you for some people silence is an offense i'm going to give him the silent treatment i'm not going to talk to him for a week two weeks silence used as a weapon yes there is a time to keep silent but it's also a time for us to speak we have all been in our own moments of silence in situations in our life when all we needed to hear were the right words to break the silence words like it's going to be all right that's all we would have needed to hear to break the silence in our lives words like god will make a way words like all things work together for good words like it's only a test word like you can't give up now there you are sitting in a room all by yourself in your moment of silence but the right word comes across to break that silence and that word comes as a deliverance to you and many of us we lived our life in silence until a word came to us to pull us out of that silence the silence was almost evidence it would seem that nothing was going on because where there is something going on there's usually some kind of noise where there is activity there is usually somebody talking but in your life before this word came to you there was only silence many of our daily struggles the failures we face the pains and the disappointments we go through are because we are silent we are afraid of doctors and it's something very interesting you know there are people who have real phobias of doctors and they rather suffer in pain than tell anybody that they're in pain they are so afraid of going to the hospital that they keep the pain locked up inside and they suffer in silence many of us in the church we don't want the pastor to know so we suffer in silence but there's a reason the bible says if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed you will have what you asked for there something happens when you begin to speak that's why the bible says let the weak see i am strong you can be strong but unless you speak it you will stay in weakness because you are living in silence you have to know when it's time to be silent and and when it's time to speak even more real to us there are some of us we love to talk about all the wrong things but the right things we're silent about we talk about the politics and we talk about the world of fears and we talk about all these things we are silent about talking about getting back to the altar of prayer we are silent about trying to fix up the marriages we are silent about making a church to make a revival it's easy to talk about the sports and talk about the movies thousands and talk about the entertainers but when it comes about what brother branham said we want to stay silent i'm saying church the time has come for us to break the silence can the church say man i want to encourage you church as we prepare to take communion don't struggle in silence don't go to your pain in silence the bible says in james 5 and verse 16 confess your faults in other words don't sit there in silence confess your fault one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed we have too many people silent in the church you cannot be silent and have a prayer life they are complete polar opposites we need to move from being silent to you are so much in communication with god god is like is is he calling again is he calling again is he calling again every day he's on the phone why because your need is so great is there anybody in the church wants to break the silence i pray this to you on the inside how many times you walk past somebody maybe you walk downstairs maybe you walk to your car and you look at somebody and and you know all is not well but you stay silent you go to your car you start you drive off and in a few moments you have missed an opportunity to say a word to somebody that could be jesus speaking to them through you but we stay silent silence for some of us is the product of our selfishness we get so concerned about our situation that we don't want to talk to anybody we don't want to testify to anybody but jesus went to peter and found him and said listen come come come stop talking to the fishes i want you to talk to somebody i want you to testify to somebody i want to break the silence in your life so that you could be just like me can the church say amen first john 1 9 says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins this something happens when you break out of the silence and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness listen demons don't want to be exposed so they hide in silence that's one of the reasons people can't really worship and they really can't break through because there's a demon saying don't say nothing don't say nothing that's why the prophet always says you want to be healed stand up do something because listen speaking could be not just verbal speaking because brother branham taught us your life speaks your actions speaks louder than your words so when you begin to do something about your situation you are beginning to break out of your silence when you begin to do something you haven't done in a long time you haven't lifted up both your hands you used to lift in one hand all of a sudden you are breaking the silence you are breaking the silence because your worship is a noise to god in heaven somebody say man we are here tonight to break the silence in this church to break the silence in your life to break the silence can the church say amen but isaac i've never heard someone like this preach and neither have i but i'm doing what he told me to do we have people with jealousy hiding in silence hatred hiding in silence fornication hiding in silence adultery hiding in silence greed hiding in silence selfishness hiding in silence but we are here to break the silence so deliverance could come to your house deliverance can come to your door don't be silent to your wife about your love you have a silent love your love is never expressed verbally never expressed by action you're silently in love that's when you're in a secret admirer status but you can be married and tell me you're silently in love can the church say amen you're loving in silence you're respecting in silence wives reverencing their husband in silence no evidence of the of respect no in silence but we hit a break the silence but let's take it just a little deeper i'm not going to be too long with you this is one of those thought provoking messages heart searching messages deeper than the silence we experience is is almost i could say the flip side of it when it would appear it would seem as if god is silent and that is the more profound of an issue that people have to wrestle with and deal with not too long ago a brother called me on the phone and i had to go and meet him because he asked a deep question he's like brother isaac where's the outpouring of the power where's the cripples walking is god silent where is the manifestation we have longed for and how many times in your life you journey and you struggle and you peed and you ask yourself the question where is god in this and it might seem as if god has gone silent you pray and you pray and you pray and it would seem as if you get no answer and when you read the prophet's messages you would recognize that he expressed similar sentiments of him calling out to god and god where are you him looking for god to move a certain way and he's like where is the response for five years god pulled the rug from under him one time when the random said he saw the angel of the lord he hadn't seen him for six months he came in he turned around and he walked away it makes you wonder sometimes what god is doing in that moment of silence be a sword this evening if you ever wonder that god is a god who understands silence because at times he is a god of silence but silence doesn't mean he's not present silence and absence are two different words so when it seems as if he's not speaking don't make no mistake about it he's still here can the church say amen god is always with us he's always working and god will always keep his promises could you take some more and as you look through the scripture and true by the pranam's message we find something very interesting it's a great drama that has been unfolding and a great drama could only have a great director and every great director knows how to use sound and music and silence to create the right effect if you ever see a drama where there's always noise it becomes boring after a while because you have to create a moment of silence so that when the sound comes back it catches you a certain way anybody knows what i'm talking about so dear in genesis god wanted to make a special type of appearance so he created everything before he even created he just had what he had was just a moment of silence and out of the silence he spoke and said let there be so before the spoken word there was silence before there was let there be there was a moment of silence so i want to see it tonight that before there's a spoken word in your life there's going to be some silence before that there's going to be some darkness before that there's going to be a period of calm before that because god don't want the devil to know what's about to happen in your life can the church say amen and after god finished do everything for the first six days on the seventh day there was silence god went back to silence on the seventh day he rested can the church say amen and through the bible we see many examples in the days of noah god was watching everything unfold and he was silent until he just couldn't take it anymore he had watched man just become worse and worse until he could not take it anymore and god was forced to break his silence he had watched for a long time until he found the right man that he could use to do what he needed in that day and he found noah and god broke his silence somebody's saying man i'm building to something church in the days of more on the days of moses there was 400 years of silence 400 years of bondage when they knew there was a prophecy and i could imagine there were young people saying are you sure god is going to deliver are you sure we're going to get free from this because my grandfather he died a slave my father he died of a slave my great-grandpappa died a slave are you telling me there's still going to be a deliverer for 400 years of prophecy hovered over them and they were living on the silence they were working on the silence but they came a day that god decided to break the silence hallelujah church we're not going to have silence all the time it's not going to be calm all the time it's not going to be quiet all the time but if branham said the pride hasn't had a revival yet all these years we've been waiting on the silence for a seventh on the revival i've got news for you this evening it's coming god is about to break his silence once more the world will hear direct from god can the church say amen moses killed a man and went running and hiding for 40 years with the george he lived in silence there was no word there was no prophecy there was no prophet there was no encouragement he was just living in silence waiting for the appointed time for the silence in his life to be broken there was silas in gideon's life there he was working hard and wondering where is god and all the miracles and god broke interrupted the silence of his life and said almighty man of hell i've got something for you can the church say ma'am the children of israel were pinned down by goliath there was noise in the camp of the philistines and the children of israel were all cried but god had somebody who could break the silence up here comes little david a little nobody he was too small for the army but he broke the silence and asked the question who is this uncircumcised fillers time trying to defy the armies of the living god is there somebody in the church of the living god that's ready to break the silence up for a long time we have waited for such a time as this but god is raising up an army in this tape to break the silence hallelujah i feel tonight if i hold my piece up the rocks are going to cry out i'm not going to be silent anymore you haven't heard me say amen yet you haven't heard me say hallelujah yet you haven't heard me shout yet up you haven't heard nothing yet up because when god bids this brightest shout like to all when this pride is commanded to speak up all the walls of hell all the walls of torment are going gonna have to come down oh glory glory glory oh i feel the silence is breaking right now i feel the silence in your life is breaking right now you've been silent for a long time you taught that god forgot about you you taught that god was only ministering to the person next to you but the word tonight is the silence in your life is breaking tonight it's breaking tonight a shout message cut through time into eternity and back and forth to call you out hallelujah if i hold my piece the rocks are going to cry out i'm not going to be silent about what god is about to do i'm not going to be silent to speak against what the enemy is trying to do satan the blood of jesus is against you i'm not afraid to say it i'm not afraid to speak it i will not be silent about the prize revival i will not be silent about the holy ghost pouring out in the church up i will not be silent about the backsliders of being restored i will not be silent about a living fate of a living virtue a living knowledge a living temperance a living patience a living i will not be silent about the rapture i'm going to the rapture i've got to say it i've got to speak it i'm breaking the silence to take hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you may be seated many times remember the brandon prayed for people he didn't tell him go silently back to your seat he told them walk away rejoice him walk away worshiping walk away thanking god don't you sit there silent you can't get you're not gonna get anything if you said silence but when you get in the spirit and you say amen to the word you say hallelujah you say yes that's mine you say healing is mine you say the holy ghost is mine then watch the power then watch the power as god he breaks the silence by pouring out the holy ghost hallelujah if i hold my peace the rocks are going to cry out i ain't going to let no rock out praise me i'm not going to let no rock sing in my place you know what the bible says the dumb will sing search for it there's a script that says the dumb will sing listen there are people who could speak that don't know how to sing so when my bible tells me that the dumb will make the choir brother the dumb will jump to singing brother i feel so excited to know that there's coming a time when the bride will have a voice it will not be her voice but it'll be his voice because she will only say what he once said and when she speaks he backs it up god what a time for the silence to be broken listen you may be seated under the silence it would seem as if your son has no hope your daughter has no hope no god moving in their lives but in that season when the silence breaks and you speak back to sister hattie wright situation i give you your two boys brother branham he broke the silence in her life she had been praying for a long time because that listen listen remember the branham spoke to her and he asked her you said the writing what do you want she said what was on her heart what was in her mind this was something that was a burden to her i don't know how long to sahati was praying for her two boys i don't know how many times she fasted for her two boys and maybe she felt like god wasn't gonna answer maybe she felt like she just turned him over the lord and she was gonna happen but that day was the right tape for the silence in her life to be broken because remember branham said i give you your two boys that was the answer she had prayed for for all those years and the silence in her life if i hold my peace the rocks they're going to be forced to cry out i'm not going to hold my peace anymore i'm not going to hold my peace anymore there will be no peace with the enemy there will be no peace for the enemy trying to take our young men there will be no peace with the enemy trying to take over young women there will be no peace with the enemy trying to break up marriages i'm not going to hold my peace i'm going to speak against it because i know once it's the word of god god's word cannot return void so i'm not gonna hold my peace i'm not gonna hold my peace i'm gonna break the silence and speak against it we will seek against sin we will speak against doubt we will speak against fear and watch it disappear can the church say amen hallelujah could you take some more hallelujah there is a time to keep silent and there is a time to speak the old testament closes with words that hold very special meaning to us the last two verses of the old testament malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come as mighty earth with a curse after these prophetic words there was a period of great silence for 400 years there was silence for 400 years there was no message from god for 400 years no prophet arose to give god's word for 400 years no angels visited with a word from god there was just silence like the calm or the stillness before the storm there was just silence until god decides to break his silence hallelujah amen here we find after malachi the story switches to zechariah and his wife elizabeth and they are suffering two pains the pain is not from one sources two pains they are suffering on the one hand because they are part of a nation that it seem that if god has abandoned them after all that they have went through through the later years before jesus through the hands of the of the greeks and the mids and the persians and the babylonians they have now fallen into the hands of the romans and the people to whom god had said wherever you put your foot is yours and slay all the amalekites and the hittites and the jebusites here they were oppressed by the romans after 400 years of silence i could imagine that way down on every jew at that time as they wondered where is god beyond that problem that zechariah and elizabeth had they had their own personal grief they were childless and as they got older they had almost resigned themselves to accepting this might just be our lot and i can imagine elizabeth had lived for a long time with the shame and disgrace of being barren that was what defined her her barrenness they didn't call her elizabeth the cake maker elizabeth who cooks a good palau elizabeth who makes nice stew chicken this was elizabeth the childless whether they said it to her or not this is how she felt because it was it was real to her zachary zechariah agreed because he had no one to follow in his footsteps and i could imagine they prayed zechariah being of the priesthood he was a spiritual man he prayed and he cried for a child but there seemed to be no son but after 400 years of silence while zachariah is doing his priestly duty he is visited and you still listen god has answered your prayer what a way to break the silence with an angel saying don't worry all the prayers that you've been praying for all these years for the holy ghost god has answered your prayer you have been praying for all these years for a breakthrough don't worry god has heard your prayer why have you come gabriel i've come to break the silence i have come to break the silence for all these years it seemed as if nothing was moving but i've come to break the silence and god breaks the silence by speaking to mary through the angel gabriel and that's how jesus enters into the picture can the church say amen so friends don't be discouraged if sometimes you feel the silence becomes overbearing jesus growing up at age 12 he has the famous word says mother don't you know i'm about my father's business and i can imagine the great director of the great drama said the word cut and jesus exits the stage at age 12. and from age 12 to 30 jesus grows up in silence there is no scripture that speaks about age 12-30 except that he was tempted and tried and he didn't sin but from age 12 to 30 under that silence he was going through the struggles that we go through without giving up so that he could be touched by the feeling of your infirmities that when you feel all down and low he can identify with that because during his period of silence he would have experienced what you experienced at age 30 jesus re-enters the great drama for 18 years he had been getting ready 18 years of silence he had been preparing for this moment in the wilderness satan probed at jesus because jesus was silent about who he was there is a time to keep silent and there's a time to speak satan say if thou be if thou be jesus knew it was not the time to speak yet so he didn't tell the devil who he was he just said it is written it is written it is written there is a time to keep silent but after jesus walked out of the wilderness and retaining the power of the spirit come on now he went into the temple on a regular church day when everybody was in church and they just happened to look and say let's call joseph's son today to read the scriptures and joseph's son seemingly got up and took the scrolls for 30 years there had been silence 18 years in particular no word about him but jesus begins to read here it is before they even realize what's happening he is breaking the silence about who he really is about what he came to do about what his purpose was and he says the spirit of the lord is upon me for he had anointed me to bring and he began to read the scriptures they still didn't even realize what was going on but then jesus really broke it open and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and when jesus did that all of heaven shook all of the earth shook all of nature shocked the trees began to rustle the animals put their heads because they realize that for all the years since adam fell the silence was about to be broken can the church say amen i pray you are encouraged this evening i'm not going to be too much longer i'm about halfway through could you take some more and jesus does this interplay it would seem between being active and being silent and the remote the most profound silence in his ministry is really as he's being beaten and being mocked on his way to being crucified jesus doesn't say a word he doesn't curse anybody he doesn't scream at anybody they beat him and he says nothing he is deliberately silent his silence is by a choice because he is focused on his mission he is focused on his purpose and leading up to calvary to those last moments only in the conversation with the thieves and just a couple moments and he climaxes his speech but it is finished and those words break the silence and shatters it once again can the church say amen the musician can get ready to come i'm not going to be too much longer i'll skip most of this i'll have to pick it up some of the time but i read that scripture i'm going to skip over these quotes for now on revelation 8 1 that there was silence for the space of half an hour and by the brand i'm told that the seal signifies a finish work so that seven seal or any seal signifies a finished work or signifies approval and he gives the type of the boxcar when it's filled the right way it is sealed until its destination the seal is necessary to protect what's on the inside until the time appointed for it to be opened you're not to touch it you're not supposed to touch it until it reaches its destination and we know the seven seals was the book of redemption and only when you opened the seal you could look at the contents to know what's redeemed in that seal and the first seal to the fourth seal identifies how satan infiltrated the church by the antichrist spirit with the four riders the white horse red horse black horse and pillows and even though satan caused havoc in the church god still did a work of redemption he sent for the lion the ox man and eagle the great drama was being unfolded when he opened the fifth seal it's another work of redemption redemption for the jews the sixth seal to come the judgment sea but when he opened the seven seal there was silence can the church say amen there was something happening under the radar visible yet invisible the god that was once invisible that had become visible to god it was once silent and spoke jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he had once again changed form a work of redemption was going on and satan was mad god hid something under silence because if the devil only knew what it was he would do great damage so god had to use silence but that silence couldn't last forever it was for the space of half an hour because after half an hour the silence must be broken after the half an hour whatever is hidden under that silence has got to come forth hallelujah hallelujah every other seal had a symbol had a noise had a sign that something first seal second seal third seal fourth fifth sixth but the seventh seal not that seal that seal silence god didn't want to take any chance with that seal that seal was too important jesus didn't even want to talk about that seal john was so not to write about that seal because that seal was the key to everything that seal was tied to taking somebody back to eden that seal was tied to the hole of redemption that seal was tied to the coming of the lord that seal was tied to these virtues being made manifest that seal was the great mystery hidden on the silencer but it's coming or breaking of the silence can the church say amen hallelujah we're in the word now we're in the message now all of it is building up to this anybody can preach the first part but this part that's a different story we are in the seventh seal because under there i looked under the first ceiling i wasn't there i looked under the second ceiling i wasn't there i looked under the third seal i couldn't find myself i looked on the fort i couldn't see myself i looked on the fifth i'm not a jew i can't be there i look at the six i'm not going to the tribulation i've got to be somewhere and i say tonight i come from under the seventh seal hallelujah hallelujah can the church say man do you know what seal you come from under that's why the devil is afraid tonight because once you know who you are he's finished don't let them get the secret that god hid the very best thing for us christ in you the hope of glory seven thunders banging one two three four five six seven can the church say man hallelujah though i feel religious this evening i feel religious deceiving him we are not a message search we are seven sealed church we are whoa hallelujah brother branham said that seventh seal is tied to the third pull brother when when you have your course but i don't have time to read it when brother brahman spoke about it he was getting so excited he was like he would use all kind of sounds because he was running out of words but he himself was instructed to not give too much about it because it couldn't happen then you don't hear me you may be seated god had to wait for a certain people to be in position it couldn't happen before it's time but a christophe it couldn't happen before it's time because listen god had to wait all these years and do something under silence it's visible yet invisible it seems as if you're just coming to church but under the silence of coming to church god is doing a hidden work of redemption to bring our people together on the silence the word is being planted in your heart under silence your spirit is getting to connect with the world on one of these days the silence will be broken an outward come a pride a living pride a powerful pride you may be seated hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah let the church say man let the regime say so hallelujah you are being redeemed right now hallelujah but i see some smiling faces but at night i see you hitting your head on the wall like the eagle tonight i see that renewing power moving to the camp when you're going to recognize wait a minute the devil tried to keep me from seeing this great thing trying to keep men from great places like this to recognize that all for all these years when god listen you may be seated when the pentecostals had a zoo's street the holy ghost poured out but the branham asks a question he said lord this brother got this gift he's speaking in tongues and behind the scenes they're living in sin committing adultery all kind of filthy living and it would seem in the message that god held back held back certain power held back certain thing because god said this time i'm doing it on the silence i don't want nobody to understand what's going on because i don't want no impersonation of this in the seventh seat but the battle said the devil couldn't impersonate anything but this he could impersonate any kind of gift but this because this seventh seal is christ you can impersonate christ you could impersonate td jakes you could impersonate benny him you could impersonate oral roberts you can impersonate any kind of gift but not jesus christ you gotta you gotta have him on the inside inside there's only one like him there's no copy of him it's either him and him alone there's no other there's no other god like this god there's no other king like this king you may be seated that's why when jesus died and the devil was holding the party because it went silent after jesus that but then all of a sudden under the silence even when the holy ghost poured out the devil didn't bat an eye he didn't move with that but you see when peter went by the cave called beautiful and he said this is that what happened in hell was the allowance of jesus is black they didn't see peter it was jesus he had come back again he was inside of peter he was inside of james he was inside of john this wasn't james this wasn't john this wasn't peter it's not the acts of the apostles it's the act of the holy ghost that shame jesus the seventh seal he is the one who created the silence he is the one to break the silence hallelujah somebody give god a shout of praise could he take a little more my my my this is supposed to be a short service to get to community but to see when you have to forgive me but i feel like with a george on thursday night but the george says i'm finished then he said i'm finished then he said i'm finished and he still wasn't finished but when the going gets so good and you begin to un to feast on the hidden manner under the seventh seal it begins to eat good and it begins to eat good and you can't stop eating because it's joy to us this is my joy this is my peace this is my high this is what i live for this is why i woke up this morning to know that god called me out of every age out of every people for his namesake for his glory for his honor mine brother one of these days the silence will break so much that you're going to find yourself screaming you didn't even know you could scream you're going to find yourself shouting you didn't know you could shout you say listen a baby when a baby is is what's the right word it's growing in the mother's womb the baby is moving under silence it's not right the baby can't talk the baby can't the baby can't say anything for nine months it seems as if nothing is happening for nine months just silence and you just stare you listen to the heartbeat you know there's something there you haven't seen it yet you haven't talked to it yet you haven't shake his hand yet you haven't done anything it's just on the silence but when that baby comes forth and that baby begins to scream there's no shutting up that baby because that baby is no longer under silence it's no longer goo gaga that lasts for only a certain season but as that baby breaks out from under the silence there comes a point but the anthony's going to come soon when the baby just won't stop talking the baby begins to make up for those nine months of silence and it just begins to talk and begins to talk and there's nothing you could do because it's built in and there's something built inside of you that was growing under silence under nine months nine years under the years since the prophet left there's been a baby growing and that baby has been feasting and feeding on the word of god for all these years but that baby as it comes forward the silence is broken and the baby screams out and you can't put that baby back in the womb you can't put me back where i came from you can put me back into the condition i came from god brought me out he will keep me out and he who started to work in me is more than able to bring it to completion brother i feel so happy i feel so excited i'm trying to close out and brother george i can't close out here my god my god hallelujah could it take a couple of minutes more i got a few more pages i'm not going to read all of it but i just want to end with this every seal had this word history age vision and the people so the first to the the first sea to the fourth seal all had their ages history the church ages the fifth seal has its age with the jews the sixth seal has its age is the tribulation isn't that right the sixth seal would have a history it'll be three and a half years that's how long the tribulation will be but what about the seventh seal the seventh seal has its own history in 1963 the seventh seal couldn't have a history because the mighty god was now breaking he was now breaking but after all these years now we can look back from when the prophet left and see we have a history every seat has to have a people the people weren't around in 1963 but i look out at the audience tonight and i see a people who have been hidden under the silence of the seventh seal sir is this the time for the breaking of the silence of cells is this the time for once more the world will hear direct from god still is this the time for the final voice up to the final age i'm finished may the lord richly bless you may the lord keep you stay on fire and don't ever don't ever stay silent when i bid it to shout give god a soul check

remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink the scope of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of
