sunday morning this first day of a new month lord and lord to have the privilege and the opportunity to come together as a body of believers lord at such a time as this lord with so many things happening around the world so many different distractions so many different interruptions so many ways we could spend time and do things and father but lord we recognize who you are we recognize your word for this hour lord your word for this season we recognize that everything that's unfolding is a spiritual reflection of another dimension father so we thank you this morning that we have responded to the call lord the message lord we were told would fall into the hands of the predestinated so we thank you that there is no accident with you we thank you that there is no haphazard operation with you we thank you for lord as that song said lord your grace and your mercy because lord there's nothing we could have done to deserve this there's nothing we could have done to earn this there's nothing we could have done to be qualified for this father lord we are not qualified but you still chose us lord we didn't make the cut but you still made it possible for us to be here father lord we don't come bring in our abilities and our merits and what we have accomplished but we come father thanking you for what you have done thanking you for what you have placed in our souls so father as we approach this service this morning father may you give unction to me to minister the word take me out of the way and speak to your children may you break shackles and chains may you unlock windows and doors father so that your children could escape into the promises of god for this season father may they break free may they break from may they break up father may you bless those that are here in the sanctuary bless those that are connected on the internet we pray a special blessing and our blood brothers and sisters lord who are lord who are not able to make it because they are in sick or whatever it is father we pray that the holy ghost will minister to them now in the mighty name of jesus and the church says amen amen amen well certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the lord one more time and if you have your bibles either get straight to the word i want to read from three portions of scriptures thank you so much musicians thank you brother gideon uh greetings from the pastor this morning uh who's coming along fine by the grace of god so we're on the expectation for great things are you on expectation this morning so for a title this morning or rather let me get the scriptures first psalm 71 saint luke 21 and hebrews 12. psalm 71 deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine air unto me and save me saint luke 21 and reading from verse 32 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with fighting and drunkenness and cares of this life so that they come upon you unawares in other words be prepared always huh for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that you might be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man and our last reading hebrews 12 25 see that ye refuse not him that speak it for if they escape not who refuse him that speak on it much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he had promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this would yet once more signify it the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receive we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning for a title this morning the way of escape the way of escape anybody looking to leave this place leave this world behind leave all these troubles behind leave all these pressures and stresses and every day it's a new thing every week it's a new thing every with this a new every month is a new situation i was sharing with my wife this morning how they are now two sub-variants and it's is every day is a new thing it's an it's a new issue it's a new challenge it's a new problem and and and that's fine because that's what the scripture tells us we're supposed to have is is the way things are but god has a way of escape there's a way to get away from all these things there's a way to get away from all the troubles and get away from all the worries and get away from all the situations in your life and hallelujah he gave us power to overcome and he gave us power to survive and power to make it and power to stand in power to have a testimony and the word comes to remind us that we are not creatures of time but we are creatures of eternity that are trapped in time and because we are trapped in time they has to be a way for us to leave time and get back to eternity but the devil's job is not to make that easy the devil's job is to make that as difficult as possible and because of this there needs to be an opportunity to escape but jesus is saying but you have to watch and do certain things so you could be counted worthy to escape because the ass this escape that we're talking about this morning is not for anybody and everybody it's an escape to those that are counted worthy so i want to be counted worthy so i could escape escape the corruption of this body escape the corruption of the mind escape the corruption of technology escape the corruption of this body this this body that is given trouble every other day is a new issue a new a pain a new situation your mind and all these things but there's a way of escape a way to leave this place a way to leave it all behind and you have to want to leave it all behind you can be so comfortable that it it it becomes something that you don't mind doing no it's it's an escape it's not a way to leave i'm not talking about leaving you know i'm talking about escape because there's a difference between leaving and escaping when you leave something you can go back to it but when you escape it means you don't want to go back to it can the church say amen we're talking about escaping this corruption in this world you don't want nothing to do with it hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord i was having a conversation with over yesterday and we were talking about leaving and departing because you could leave but you still have connections but when you depart it means you're ready to want to go back there you know hallelujah you don't want to go back goodbye world you're burning the bridge behind you you don't want nobody to chase you to find you because you want to get out of where you were before so hallelujah so we know god promised a way of escape and in the message god provided away brother branham said on god always before he sends judgment do you know judgment is guaranteed do you know judgment is already set there's nothing going to stop the judgment but before he sends judgment he always makes a way of escape out of every trial god makes a way of escapes before he sends his judgment i must first say before he sends judgment he always sends mercy oh hallelujah but ibraham said in that same message there's not a bit of need of anyone going to hell when god has made a provided way of escape he said you can't help being a sinner you can't help but he was born a sinner but you can help staying a sinner oh hallelujah you can't help you how you were born you can't help what house you were born in you can't have the name you were born into you can't help any of that stuff but you could help staying a sinner because if you accept jesus he was made sin for you god's way of escape then you don't have to be a sinner no more you'll be a christian and you'll be holy not your own holiness but his holiness what you are but but what god has done for you in christ jesus hallelujah brother branham said your own ways you can quit lying you can quit stealing you can quit smoking hallelujah he said that don't even mean you're saved you're saved because god ordained that you should be saved and called your heart that's why you're saved no man can come except the father draws me first hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord in spiritual food and due season i'm just laying a foundation he made a way for the believer the same thing he does each time in the days when he was going to destroy the world by water he made a way of escape for noah in the days he was going to deal with egypt he made a way of escape across the sea for his people how god makes a way where there is no way because he is that way he is that way oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord and he cares do you care he said he cared for those who care to escape in the days of noah he sent them a prophet and this prophet directed them to god's provided way now that's god's way of doing things god spoke to noah and told noah to prepare an act oh hallelujah and we also have a prophet that god spoke to so we could know the way of escape and it's going to be a great escape oh we're going to have an opportunity to break free from the confinement of this world from the control of this world to escape means to get away to get out to run away to run off to break out to break free to get free to break loose to make a break for it to make a run for it to bolt to clear out to flee to fly to take flight to make off to take off to slip away one minute detail next minute the devil don't know where you're gone hallelujah but something in you knows that you cannot be satisfied with just existing on the earth you know that you're a creature of eternity and you're trapped in time and no devil no demon no sickness no mind battle will hold you back from getting out of here hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord are you making plans say escape are you putting things in place you can't escape with your car you know you can't escape with the house you know it's too big to carry oh come on now somebody help me hallelujah to escape you got to make preparations you got to time it you got to understand what's moving you got to know when the gods passing you got to know what time they bring in the food what time they what time they're looking what time they're not looking that's why he said watch therefore so you can be counted worthy to escape you can't escape when you want to escape you have to look for the right opportunity because it's a right time there's a right season there's the right opening there's a right movement there's a right hour oh blessed be the name of the lord oh when paul and silas were in prison they didn't know what time was the right hour but at the midnight hour when they were worshiping when they were singing when they were praising god at the least likely moment oh hallelujah the opportunity for escape presented itself and the door began to open they couldn't be sleeping and get out of there no but they were in the spirit so when the opportunity came they got out of there oh hallelujah there's a way of escape this morning there's a way of escape for you there's a way of escape for your family there's a way of escape from your past there's a way of escape from selfishness there's a way of escape from doubt there's a way of escape from fear there's a way of escape from lust and ungodliness there's a way of escaping feeling the backslide there's a way of escape from feeling depressed and frustrated there's a way of escape this morning there's a way of escape to escape sickness to even escape death because death has no power over the blood watch ones you could escape death yes you can we shall not all sleep oh hallelujah there are those that will escape there are those that will escape this body going to the ground all day that are going on they are waiting for those who are the escaped ones who will be able to call for the resurrection because they come to perfection we will escape what every other age had to go through because at the last age every mystery every word every prophecy every promise is on our shoulders it's our responsibility but you have to want it you have to want to get out you have to want to break free you have to want to leave it behind you have to want to get out of egypt you have to want to get out of sodom you have to want to get out of the world you have to want to get away from distraction you have to want to get away from uncleanness you have to want to get away from filthy living you have to want to get away from no prayer life you have to want to get away from just being a church member that's a prison too you know yes church members locked up in church but they don't want to escape they're happy to come to church but there's a way of escape away from just being in the message and wanted to escape this and go into the rapture oh hallelujah i don't want you to find me in church i want you to know i'm an escape one because i'm looking for that rapture express i'm looking every service every monday every tuesday whether we have church or don't have church i'm looking for my escape because i know i'm a son of the king oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah a way of escape a way of escape back to eden a way of escape back to your authority or the devil wants to keep you locked up so you don't know the power that's possible to flow through you the devil wants to keep you locked up under your god-given privilege so you take whatever the devil gives you but there's a way of escape for you to grab hold of your authority grab hold of your power grab hold of your anointing oh once you break out of that prison once you break free from that prison hallelujah you walk straight from prison into power hallelujah if the devil could keep you thinking you're locked up then you finish but if this morning you can see the way of escape that there's a way out of no praise there's a way out of no worship there's a way out of being just existing there's a way that you could break free to worship some people are so tied up they can't even remember when they really worship i have talked about lifting your hands and saying hey man i know i'm talking about breaking free from what the person next to you is thinking and what the person next to you is feeling and what the person next to you is doing and you are just free because who the son of man set free is free indeed jesus came for you to be free this message came to you to be free to turn the hearts back of the children back to the faith of the fathers that was a free church it was a free group of people and there's a way of escape oh we are the escaped ones but the brandon said you escaped rome you escaped the pope you expect communism you escape all these things and we are leaving this place not by ourselves we're taking our families if they want to go they can go too we are leading a breakout a breaking out of prison are breaking out of my situation this morning the devil tried to lock you up in your past you could escape from your past paul said forgetting the things that i pass i press i press oh hallelujah oh my you can't escape prison friends without a plan this jail keeper has been keeping people in prison for a long time oh hallelujah we are here for a short time on the earth but this jail keeper has been keeping me for a long time you can't just be a random you can't be just try to escape this easy easy like that you have to have a plan there has to be a little distraction you have to have a coordinated system things have to happen in different ways at different times so that you can move and the devil don't even realize you're moving when you think you're bending down and just eating your food you don't know you're praying he don't know in the meantime it looks like you're just doing normal living but you're ready putting things together oh hallelujah hallelujah anybody with me this morning is it anybody in the house when you study breaking out of prison some people take years and they move stone by stone rock by rock and when when it is all over and it's only when it over people understand what took place because it is such a slow process sometimes of taking your time when nobody watching it you take a little piece of spoon and you just you're scraping but you're doing it consistently you're doing it all the time you know a drop of water over and over and over could cut through something what it means is consistency so when you pray every day you're actually chipping it don't look like much but after you do it all day long you do it today you do it tomorrow you do it the next day the devil said look at you nothing happening but you know you're chipping you're chipping away you're chipping away and you're being smart you're hiding it you're making it look like you just went to work but the devil don't realize that you went to work with a difference oh come on now you sit down in the evening and you and you're just looking at the trees but in the heart of house where the devil can't enter you're talking to god you say lord make me more like you and you're chipping you you're chipping you're cutting your you're shaping you're sharpening yourself being conformed to the word image that little worm is becoming a butterfly and the devil can't figure it out because it's not happening overnight it's not happening overnight every service every prayer meeting every encounter you're just tripping you're chipping away you're chipping away at the walls around your life the devil think you're trapped up but he doesn't know you're stronger today than you were yesterday the devil doesn't know [Applause] somebody help me somebody help me somebody help me oh he said what's there for be consistent so you'll be counted worthy because this is a timed event you know this rapture thing we're talking about but a punch is a timed event between six and nine we're looking for the russell to here to go i want to make sure but in london that the pathway clear out of my cell when it's time to go it got to be finished the whole got to be ready i got to know exactly how i'm going to move what time i'm going to move i have to take up the boots i have to take up whatever to take off i have to leave the car i have to leave the bills i have to leave the mortgage i have to leave all of that because it can't fit this thing is designed to fit only a certain thinking get out i got to get out i can't stay in bondage those that are going on before depending on me to make it out of this prison this terrestrial plane can't hold me anymore i'm a creature of eternity been trapped for a long time but house of hell give way to the name of jesus pharaoh let my people go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah listen the devil can't see this you know because his whole escape plan is locked up under the seventh seal even when we talk about it he can't understand it he's hearing us in a different language because this mystery of who you are he can figure it out hallelujah you know what brother branham said if the devil could only get under the blood then he'll be able to understand certain things but he can't come under the blood underneath your blood the devil can't reach you and what we are preaching is from under the blood and the blood is speaking on your behalf letting you know you could escape and when you trip away it's for your family it's for your situation it's for your loved ones [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen hallelujah in prison yes get visitations let's get visits all these visitations is when you have to understand the plan and help execute the plan and help talk about the plan because you can't just escape and be standing out outside the prison and i don't know where you're going so this thing have to be so perfectly timed that when you get out there's a waiting vehicle you have to get out and cross ground you may have never walked before so you have to study the map in your mind you have to know how much pss is going to take how much steps if it's 22 steps and then turn left because you never walk there before you've been locked up anybody with me you got to know where to turn right and turn left you got to know with the eyes closed you got to know it if it's dark you got to know it when oh come on somebody help me and this whole bible is an escape plan you have to know it with your eyes closed you have to know it when the light's off you have to know when to turn you have to know when the enemy going gonna move and decide and when the enemy comes in like a flood you know the spirit will have to raise a standard because you're escaping you don't have no weapons but they're escaping hallelujah somebody helped me anybody want to escape their sickness is anybody want to escape that pain in your body anybody want a break from that pain this morning [Music] [Applause] hallelujah we have studied it so many times and listen the devil's job is to break your mind break your spirit you tell somebody we escape you say what happened if we don't make it out you know what they will do to us and if you let that get to you yeah make no moving you're suddenly fine you put down your spoon you're putting on your bread knife and you stop chipping because you start to wonder if things go wrong but when you have scriptures like all things work together for good and you don't have to take no taught about these things and don't worry about these things you're wondering what the children warned about listen just keep tripping [Applause] worry has not solved one thing since adam fell to no warrior fixed anything yet but fate has the ability to move mountains and it is an act of fear because faith without works is dead your work is expressed by your daily actions in the face of situations that should tell you to stop oh you don't hear me this morning every single day there are situations that challenge you to give up situations come that asks you why is it what's the use but something on the inside when you feel like giving up when you feel like giving up when you feel like throwing in the towel when you feel like this thing is not worth it something holding on to you when you can hold on to yourself that's why you hear this this morning that's why in church this morning you may be seated you know the stories with the footprints understand the time he looked and he sees the two footprints he said lord why in my darkest moment you left me in my darkest moment i just see one pair of footprints he said son in that darkest moment is when i was actually carrying you those are those are my footprints you see in there oh it might look a little slow and struggling because that's carrying your weight but you have not been alone because i promise to never leave you promise to never forsake you promise to not abandon you promise to not let you go to this thing alone oh what a friend we have in jesus closer than a brother come on young brother young sister get to know him get to know him because to know him is life hallelujah get to know jesus do you do you know him not do you know church but do you know him because he's the one waiting on the outside for the escape hallelujah blessed peter the name of the lord everybody feeling fine just trying to encourage you this morning encourage your fate to know to keep pressing to keep fighting they keep climbing to keep doing things don't do things to keep you here do things to escape stand oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my we gotta leave this place you know friends it's hard for one person to escape it's even harder for two people you know how hard it is for three people and you know how much harder it is for a whole group to escape and just think in this rapture a whole group of people around the world that the devil wants to keep suddenly breaking free at the same time and the devil can't do nothing about it that's what's about to happen you know but are you ready have you have you cleared your pathway to get out of here [Music] in the message eagle stirring her nest brother said i thought that was the most saddest sight experience he had he said i'd give that man a hundred dollars more than he paid for the ego he saw a man with an eagle in a cage he said that a purely man more money than he paid for the eagle 100 more if he'd let me open that door and let him out oh to think he was born to seal those blue skies and he looked up there and couldn't do it somebody had put him in a cage i thought that was a sad sight but brother when i see men and women who were born to be sons and daughters of god caged in old cage of the nomination that says the days of miracles has passed and keep you away from the real thing of god walking around out here trying to satisfy that blessed hunger that god put in you to thirst after him and you're trying to satisfied with wearing shorts and drinking and joining church and all these things is the saddest sight i've ever seen you were born to be a man and woman of god the sword you unexplored hallelujah and explore the unknown god made you thus not to be caged in by my denomination don't believe in miracles i don't care what your denomination does your savior said so and that settles it don't let no man put you in a cage you don't need in a cage you need to be free the reason you look upward is because you are a born eagle friends you know you can't become an eagle you're either born an eagle or you're not born or eager and if you're born or eager it's already built in in you to fly whether you're in prison or out of prison the ability to fly is already built in we are not trying to change due to eagles this morning you know we are here to remind you that you're born an eagle and it is not expected of you to display eagle behavior eagle strength eagle attitude eagle perseverance hallelujah the reason you look upon is because you're a born eagle the reason you love to do that is because god made you thus hallelujah there's something in you brother congress looking up for your redemption there's something in you that drives you every morning it doesn't matter what trials you go through god made you thus you can't stay cooped up in a chicken coop you were made to be an eager to fly in the sky the heavens above and sail into the unknown into the power of the living god hallelujah but abandoned goes on he said you wasn't made to be like other birds that's what's the matter today that's what your hearts are hungering for is to get loose and to get free because you're an eagle to begin with hallelujah an eagle is an eagle to start with he was born an eagle that's what make him hunger and peaceful righteousness but long as you're standing in a cage that says that there's a miracle of pass or you don't listen to those fanatics there's no divine healing there's no baptism of the holy ghost there's nothing but a bunch of holy rulers don't you believe that don't you believe that oh blessed be the name of the lord yet an eagle all he hears how much different he is from a chicken but they are bored birds what is a chicken is his nomination brother but he's a chicken how much different is it from a chicken the eagle goes just as high as he can and builds his nest in the cleft of the rock and when he gets up there no predator can get to him see why the devil wants to keep any cage because you could go so high i think i preached it last week however you live so high situations can't get to you anymore you fly so high your trials can't reach that high they don't have the ability to go that eye but when you go that high oh god lord almighty the predator can't get to you oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but god has some eagles who will escape god has some sons who will escape god has some daughters who will escape i'm sorry but i can't apologize for what i believe i believe that there are some sons and daughters who are tired of this world and they really say goodbye world oh and good morning glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the whole bible is about escaping hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord luke 4 when jesus came look at the scripture the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal to broken-hearted to preach deliverance to the captives you know he had to preach deliverance to the captives hallelujah so that they know that there's a way out you've been in captivity but there's a message of deliverance that breaks you out to your captivity hallelujah there are people in all kind of chains this morning hallelujah it might be chain of doubt or whatever it could be a chain of sickness a chain of frustration a train of depression oh hallelujah but you could go free this morning you ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth i don't care what the situation is you are built to fly above it and fly as an eagle into the eye of the storm and confront every challenge every trial every testing just like david the beer the lion when goliath come you're not backing down because you're an ego you know the lord who took you through the first trial the lord who took you through the second trial the lord who woke you up this morning the lord when the doctor gave up on you you still kept pressing on the lord i went things went wrong at home you still kept coming the lord and when your marriage was shaking you still kept coming the lord when your job was have problems you still kept coming that lord is more unable because you want eagle and you're built to take pressure you're built to fly no chicken will go in the rupture but an eagle you could fly into the rapture you could fly into the heavenlies and you could escape oh am identified with the escape ones hallelujah noah he escaped the flood his family escaped because of him you hear what i said his family escaped because of him because god didn't speak to them god spoke to him thank god noah had enough strength to lock his family into the ark hallelujah i think brother brandon preached when when his son tried to put his hand he slammed the door on his son's hand thank god for some parents who laid on the rules to keep some of us in line but noah's family escaped because of him come on you parents you have a job to do you have a responsibility to do as for me and my house we will serve the lord noah escaped lot escape and we'll talk about it in a little bit enoch escaped he escaped this corruption he so pleased god that one day he just walked and walked straight out of the earth oh that's going to be my testimony one day will that be yours oh when the devil looked for you he's like i'm not seeing him i can't pick him up i don't know he was here one minute no he's not i don't know what happened anybody see anybody see where but a punch went anybody see where the currents went hallelujah on your way to do something but all of a sudden say but wait but where where you went where sister williams when she was here this morning and i can't find out what happened look for a apb get issued for you and the devil don't realize you don't break free already you don't break this mortal put on immortality all these years coming to church all these years believing nothing pain all these years holding on all these years sign and crying and then one day one day god says come come come come and all of a sudden you realize you compatible you are flesh of his flesh you are born of his bone you are spirit of his spirit when you look at him you recognize you look just like him hallelujah oh i hope this is encouraging you this morning and every single listen and that's why it's a way of escape the way of escape from noah was different from lot the way of escape from enoch was different there's a way of escape for time and season and operation for the children of israel to come out of egypt with occurrence guardians and a flood he had another way of escape what worked for noah was not going to work for moses moses couldn't say let's build a act that was not the way of escaping that day anybody with me this morning oh hallelujah and when it was time for the children of israel noah had to not speak to no king no pharaoh he was preaching a message get into the act during his coming that was a different kind of thing but when moses time come now god said go down to pharaoh and tell pharaoh let my people go hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord this escape is different hallelujah my children have been in bondage for a long time they're born into bondage some of them don't even know what freedom looks like because they are a son or grandchild or a great-great-grandson they're born in egypt they just born into slavery but i want you to go down there and tell pharaoh that let my people go i don't care how what condition what is happening tell pharaoh let my people go do i say moses say lord i can't talk this is the same moses who was most likely to succeed in university most likely to be the next king most likely to be a politician most likely to be qualified but when he saw the magnitude of the task to lead and escape for two million people he said i can't talk hallelujah and i preach a message no more excuses when moses finished say what can happen and what car work out and he said you have any more you have any more reason why you can't go you have any more reason why you can't worship you have any more reasons why you can't pray you have any more excuses for why you're not on fire you have any more reasons for why for why you not on the front line jumping and shouting because after you say you can't and you can't in a card i'm here to let you know you're still going because that's what you were born to do you're born an eagle you might have been living in a chicken cuban and eating chicken food and wearing chicken clothes and going to a chicken job and you're trying to fit in but after all it's said and done you're still going [Applause] and little moses rejects his staff and just his wife and his son go down into egypt to come and take over to come and set the people free you see oh god loves to create a way of escape that just defies expectation every single time nobody when they left moses said if they only knew what moses was coming to do they stop him at the border if they only knew what moses was coming to do because they didn't consider him a threat he said come in come in come in come in say hello old man with a stick and his wife and a child walking into egypt and they don't even know that locked up in that man is nuclear power locked up in that man is a walking nuclear weapon just walking and good morning how you doing good good evening hallelujah moses himself didn't even know how this was going to play out he was just walking in his purpose his purpose led him to walk in egypt walk the same streets that he walked as a boy he walked the same street study he played in but he didn't even realize the nuclear power that had been locked up in him that was part of that pillar of fire experience oh come on now somebody help me his wife was walking with him and she didn't even know that the husband she was with was such a changed man she she knew he had an experience but she didn't realize how much he had changed he didn't realize how much he had had such an encounter that he was a different man and moses is walking and he's walking and his son is looking at daddy the same daddy you may be swimming with entire shoelaces and his son don't even realize that that daddy is a channel of inspiration for god to speak through and here it is moses find himself walking one foot in front of the other not even knowing how we're gonna say it and what he gonna say because god is now using as an instrument do you see what's coming your way i'm trying to paint a picture oh hallelujah because it's not your might it is not your power it is not your ability it is not your strength it is not your ability it is not your strength and moses coming to map out the way of escape he said pharaoh let my people go pharaoh looking at see but this is this is not moses was this long time we say it's 40 years we look in fear you remember the maniac and moses stood there and have to take the critique the comments through along his staff and you know the unfolding of it and out of that came more pressure for the children of israel let them make bricks without straw and now the children of israel do people who he would expect excited to go free start to have problems with him now you see you come to oppress us more why didn't just stay quiet why are they still i'm trouble and telling us we can leave this place now things get harder you give us hope that we can leave but now like a squeeze come in boy but that's how god operates because god wanted to break pharaoh and every preacher before every single plague that came was attacking one of the egyptian deities one by one god was saying fly sending frogs and then walking up pestilence to break down his system there until the last great one hallelujah oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the last great one slay every firstborn slay every firstborn oh blessed be the name of the lord and there it was it didn't matter if you're jew it didn't matter if you're egyptian if you didn't do what was required you're in trouble hallelujah if you didn't apply the token because that was the only way of escape the way of escape wasn't what church you're into what what what what what tribe or the brandon preacher so many times it didn't matter if you're an israelite it didn't matter what child you belong to blessed be the name of the lord and we know it they all escaped and even on the journey of escaping they had more situations that they had to escape from because the devil is not going to make it easy they headed out to egypt and as they come to the red sea we know it pharaoh now coming behind them and once again after all of the power and all the miracles again human behavior human condition moses they're crying and god say why cry speak and move forward oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord could he take some more here's the escape theater friends this escape we're talking about another casual experience it's not a casual thing there's a level of urgency that we want to have for i cannot do anything till thou become fitter that's what god would have told lot hurry up and escape leave this thing behind you hallelujah saying luke 17 26 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot did it eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it they went to school they went to work but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and it's tough in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field at them likewise not returned back remember lot's wife escape flee flee run for your life young brother young sister run for your life father mother are you on the run are you looking to escape are you looking to get away from this thing or you or you're comfortable just hoping that something will work out and you're going to make it through second timothy 2 22 to 22 flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart time of escape but ibrahim said in the message is your life worthy of the gospel now we see when god gives a man an invitation to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down then there's nothing left after mercy is pulling but judgment if you step over the boundaries of mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it happens most every age in the bible why are you saying this brother isaac we're preaching about escaping and there are people who will do nothing about it no zeal no burden no crying no sign no holding on to the horns of the altar but ibanum goes on when god sent noah his servant and made a way of escape for all the people who wanted to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned that noah but god made the way but they had an excuse it wasn't according to their modern thinking it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made excuses in the days of noah you making excuses young brother young sister are you making excuses for why you're not praying and you're not reading the bible and you're not trying to live right and not cleaning out your house and and lightening up yourself so you could leave here are you making excuses for why you're still holding oughts and grudges so brother branham said the reason they didn't escape the days of noah is because they made excuses he goes on they made excuses in the days of moses they made excuses in the days of elijah they made excuses in the days of christ and they make excuses today now him speaking the record to israel the one that was called to the feast you remember when they gave the parable and man said come to the feast one man said i have to go and do this i have to go and do that i have to go and do this i can't make church because i'm going to do this i can't be in prayer meeting because i have to do this i can the ones that was called to the feast that i would also apply today to men the church who has been bitten to come to the feast and won't do it a spiritual feast of the lord and they wouldn't do it they didn't want to do it they got other things to do they find excuses but ibraheem goes along with israel two thousand years ago would have accepted the invitation that they were given they wouldn't be as they are today two thousand years ago israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper and they turn it on went into judgment but as jesus said they stoned and killed the prophet that was sent to them by making excuses hallelujah jesus said listen prophet that the excuses is what killed the prophets do you realize how your excuses are holding you back the things you should be doing but you don't do but you have a reason to know you have a legitimate reason that is the excuse we are good at making excuses and some excuses we can identify you know i've made too many mistakes that is my issues i've never done this before i don't have the right tools i never had the right opportunity that's why i can't some people excuses somebody else in church affecting them that brother stumbled my boy that sister's stomach so i don't really press him because i was going good until i saw that brother do so and so and that already threw me off you know is that your exes my parents said this to me and since then that really ride my spirit ride made right man does your excuse your children upset you so that show you off you can't get into the spirit at all because you just is that your excuse they started it he started it she started it so so because she started it you you fight back you knock him out he's unconscious and your excuses it wasn't me started and i said i don't starting if you start me is that your issues and no one is supposed to hold awesome gorgeous no but if you if i only tell you what he did to me and explain to you what he said to me why are still vex is that your excuse the neighbor it was the neighbor i was going good i was heading out to service and then he tired two tires just went flat that's your issues i didn't have time working working working to pay the bills is that your excuse i have work commitments really you will let your work commitment be an excuse for this great escape i do have support at home is that your issues is that is that good enough support is that is that good enough excuse me i think was last week i preached for everybody who have an excuse there's somebody with the same situation who puts events somehow you know this is not a rebuking assistant encourage you that you could press higher i'm not qualified i'm not i don't know anybody who qualified so show that at you straight out the window i remember one time i went to a business meeting and the gentleman pulled out a book on the table he said this is called the book of excuses he said every excuse you could possibly have is in this book so when i want something done and if not done i will find the excuse in here and show it here already in other words no excuses i don't have the education brother brandon didn't have any education what is your excuse i do have the experience you think when david first meet the barney lion he was coming to university degree in warfare he had no experience but every trial every test every situation was built in his experience i don't have any friends whatever it is is the excuse let it drop here today no more excuses nothing to hinder your prayer life nothing to hit no your preparation nothing to hinder anything can the church say amen [Music] all of your excuses wouldn't change the fact that you're going to be delivered if this gospel is right church let's sell out everything we got and live for it be a christian be a christian in the morning be a christian in the noon time be a christian in the evening be a christian on a sunday on a monday on a tuesday on a wednesday on a thursday on a friday on a saturday be a christian when you're in church when you leave church when you're on your way to church be a christian for your boss be a christian with nobody watching oh yes somebody preach back to me be a christian when nobody could see you and you're by yourself because you want to escape and you want to be counted worthy to escape and he wants to walk in this way of escape because he is that way can the church see man [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah just trying to encourage your walk to walk in this way of this it's a way you know it is not just about escaping when you way of escape it's a way so your life opens up the door for you to escape it's a way it's a way of speaking it's a way of prayer it's a way it's a journey he said she said i am the way and if you keep walking in this way you'll make it hallelujah preacher message some years ago about the way and a picture about a man who was in the african jungle somewhere and he had a guide and the guy was walking through cutting through here and there and he said he wasn't seeing any pathway hallelujah because he know where to put his foot he know where to avoid this he know how to walk over the spring he know what tree to go over under whatever whatever and this way of escape we're talking about we already have a testimony of an escape one because when jesus died he escaped that reverse death true death back hallelujah went down to hell grab the keys he has experience entering this thing dating upside down come on now somebody preached back to me and he said if you're just walking my way everything will be all right hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] oh hallelujah what is the desire of your heart this morning what is the desire of your heart disservice what is your mission what is your purpose how bad do you want this thing hallelujah is this real to you are you here because you just want to have church or you're really saying lord i want to change i want transformation i want my inside to change i want my walk my talk my mindset my perspective my paradigm of goals my motives my desire lord search my heart if there's something in there that's driving me that is not you cut it this day cut it out cut it help me cut it father shape mold change burn the desire of the world burn it burn it i'm willing to sacrifice and i'm willing to give it up i'm willing to turn my back on the world i just don't want to leave i want to escape i don't want to go back into prison i don't want to go back in that past i don't want to go back there i don't want to leave our way to get back there oh no no no no i want to keep going forward hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody gives a lot of shout out praise [Applause] young people show me your company i'll tell you who you are that's the prophet let me walk into your house let me see what's laying over on the table let me see what's on your phone let me see what's on your tablet let me see what's on your whatsapp messages let me see what's on your facebook account and i'll know if you really want to escape or you're just planting your foot deeper and deeper he said but i said let me see how that bible's marked up what are the scriptures that are driving you what what's motivating you what's pushing you what are you feeding on let me see where it's all true stories let me listen to what kind of music you're playing on your radio you tell me you want to escape what are you listening to let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house oh hallelujah that's how i know if you really want to escape if you're walking this way of escape [Music] i'll tell you what you're made out of yes sir that's what your soul is feeding on that's why i say it to the church all the time when you can't get into the spirit go track back what to do yesterday the day before the day before that he did what you're feeding on because what you're feeling on is what you become you are what you eat but if you're feasting on this manner from under the seventh seal and you are identified with a death burial and resurrection and you understand that this message of the hour is to turn your heart back to the original faith and to bring you to adoption and perfection and the holy ghost itself the person of christ then it will show in your conversation it will show in your operation it will show in what you do and how you live and how you act and how you move and it will show that even if you lose your teacher still will come the devil because i want to be identified with the lord's side can the church see amen regardless of what your testimony is your fruits prove what you are your soul feeds on something that's the reason jesus said by their fruit you shall know them in a message straight is the gate we're talking about the way of escape right you have to make a choice you can't stand neutral you've got to say yes or no anybody with me every day is a choice i'm just taking it from the prophet's message because it's a way listen you can only backslide if you leave your way you can't backslide if you're on the way it's a straight way it's a narrow way if you stay on the straight way and in narrow way and you keep moving something might move slower and move faster but if you stay there you have no backslider no no the problem is when you leave the way you leave the way of escape and they take in your own way i hope this helps somebody are really dedicating this message to the young people we haven't had service in a long time this is youth service you can't stand neutral i'm a believer you know believe in what what do you believe because your belief should have you speaking a certain way dressing a certain way living a certain way pray in a certain way worship in a certain way acting a certain way having a certain kind of conversation a certain attitude a certain resilience a certain strength a certain zeal a certain enthusiasm [Music] you've got to say yes or no ah yes sure if i want to go to the party already let me let me see i i will get our feedback feedback feedback is yes or no and friend doing the right thing is is a year on a straight thing you know if you're a christian what are you doing there if a christian why are you listening to that if you're a christian why are you doing that there's no middle ground there's no gray area you've got a choice to make make it for christ but the random goes on they thought everything that belonged to church would be saved i know there are people in the message who believe that because in a message they're all right you know there are people sitting only messing with the clients who believe that because they know and believe this message that they go into heaven and they go into the rapture is an automatic thing they're people who believe that because they love jesus and they believe jesus said when people pass on everybody's saying they go into heaven if the family go into heaven really is that always work it dies by bible see you in heaven fly with what living any kind of life is is that is that the qualification to go on the other side or can a gangster criminal and walking up people who are kind of crazy and say fly high with the eagles what eagles your life your testimony but when i'm saying here they thought everything that belonged to the church would be saved jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way but few there'll be that find it this way of escape is for a few that find it and to find it means you're looking for it you're not going to stumble on this way i accidentally find myself in the way no you have to be seeking you have to be hunting you have to be looking you have to ignore you're putting on blinders because you recognize time is short time is late and the devil has taken out people in this season message believers being taken out in delusions that they're comfortable to be in church listen to the prophet's words now let me warn you this morning church be careful listen to the prophet listen carefully church if this is the last message i preach let me warn you this morning church be careful it takes time today in our self-righteous self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy that we're living in an hour when men and women stand in the churches and in the pews and sing anthems of god singing they're worshiping jesus said in vain do they worship me they worship you don't know but it don't count god can't receive it he can't accept it when it comes up to him be free granted the worship is not right because behind that listen to the prophet stand in a church within a pews and sing the anthems of god and walk out of that church and smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey and go to dances and live for the world and tell dirty smutty jokes you see how granular this thing gets he said well i don't go party but what are you talking about what's your conversation like what do you love to feed on what is your conversation made up of it's just me and my boys talking anybody know we just talk really is that the way of escape when people see you do they know you on your own journey your neighbor your co-workers everybody must know that you're different if you are fitting in something is wrong but a better piece of message you supposed to be different but i like standing out what do you think highly like under the bushel i like attention we're not looking for attention you're different you can help being different you can avoid being definitely an eagle surrounded by chickens you trying to take your whole eagle wing and and make it work like a chicken you're tying it down you're putting little tight clothes to hold it on like a chicken don't get me started this morning take the eagle here and try to make you look like a chicken you don't cut downs you're trying to go into the people dance big eagle you surrounded by said the chicken they do know what kind of chicken dance and you big eagle you must stand out they will never fit in you'll never be comfortable you'll never be accepted no matter if you learn the dance don't learn the dance learn the drink do a duty drink whatever you are still an eagle [Applause] you will never fit in you only have one way to walk the way of escape [Applause] out of this world [Applause] a way of holiness a way of decency a way of righteousness [Applause] your language cannot be like the world our language evolves our world's evolving people have different things and and listen i understand it's on the job it's in your school it's an environment you see what's happening in schools now the first week school opens seven fights merited tv that's what military news imagine the ones that make it things you never heard 10 15 20 30 40 years ago normal normal children with weapons and this and that you what you think will be in five years 10 years 15 years you know terries wonder the prophets say is this the kind of world which you're gonna have to grow up in the litter of hell uncovered and streams of demon powers these children are possessed some have never been to a church their parents never told him about god never told him about a heaven that's high in a hell that's hot and they don't know better but judgment hangs over them and if it wasn't for praying grandmas and praying grandparents and the blood and mercy and grace and god sending a prophet we will be just like that we are no better than anybody else but it's grace and mercy that was instructed to follow us every day of our lives once we walk this way of escape [Music] don't wait until your problems stack up to say lord i want to come back home don't wait until you're back against the wall to say i need to make things right don't wait until everything is falling apart to say lord i really need you it's a predictable pattern you know when pressure comes when stress comes then it drives us to look for something so there's a health issue there's a family problem there's a financial problem there's a dis i know you're looking for help until you recover wait a minute where's god um said god never leaves us go right back to where you left him because he can't leave the way he is the way [Applause] he can't leave what he is he is the way and he hasn't closed the door to the way it will close one day sure because mercy will come to an end it's a judgment seat with mercy on it the blood speaks mercy on the seat of judgment he is a judge he's a king he's a ruler and he is holy he said i am holy and you are called to walk in holiness it could never be your way how you think it should be and your plans and your ambitions and your desires and what you want and what you value and what your family stands for and what you will to achieve and your legacy and your heritage that's dead to the believer there's only one heritage there's only one legacy there's only one destination and that is through this way of escape [Applause] [Music] that takes us right through calvary where you lay there to cross and say lord now run my god today search my heart change my heart break my human spirit it's good enough to solve your home problem it's good enough to solve your business problem it's good enough you don't think god cares his disciples had taxes to pay taxes he said go fish and when the fish in the fish was gold he said go go give to caesar what this is own go take care of your taxes go take care of your financial issues because i need you to be focused on this spiritual thing these secondary things are secondary there's a bigger issue at hand that is walking in this way of escape so you could be counted worthy to escape [Applause] you are christians you are sons and daughters of the living god you are not message believers you are sons and daughters of the living god climb higher than the message believers climb higher than people who follow in christ walk in the way the way of truth the way of holiness the way of escape [Music] [Applause] you may be seen we have preached so many times before after the the lutheran message came the joshua lived by faith the wesleyan scheme and sanctify themselves and they left such sanctified lives that the holy ghost wanted to pour out because the sanctified life attracts the holy ghost the holy ghost is here looking for a sanctified life this morning looking for somebody who's just cleaning out and the more you clean out the more you troll the more you empty out he gets attracted to fill that void to fill that void that emptiness that when you empty out yourself and your desires and your feelings and your emotions and all those ungodly desires but you know what happens to when you sweep yourself clean under you don't get the holy ghost in there those demons are left go and find reinforcements and go find seven more devils to come back and re-inhabit that house and then you're worse than you were before friends this is not no game this is not a joke when i see the german demon possess it is demon possession it is spirits at work people don't even know enticing spirits seducing spirits lustful spirits lying spirits demons from the pit of hell loosed and operating in this dimension influencing true games through music through television through conversations through the internet through social media through the news through advertisement through all of these channels through games it doesn't matter what it is the illusions at the table to pull you from the way to another way friends there's only one way you know all the different interpretations and the message have to subject themselves to the one way you know i'm looking for that one way and i'm speaking about that one way you know and do i know two three four five interpolation is just one way he is the way christ is the way there's one way at the end of it the equal sign of the equal this way not an addiction unto interpretation it must just be jesus if the journey you take and lead you to jesus then bless god make sure that at the end of your journey it's jesus could you take some more i'm not too far in the message yeah just trying to encourage you push you drive you encourage you we need to climb higher we need to do more we need to we need to we need to adjust hallelujah if you're not making progress you have to do something different insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result so do something more push a little higher do something different you normally raise one hand once a service raise it twice no visit three times this time no they said four times go look seven times go walk around another time this time walk around jericho walk around the jericho of your life one more time don't give up hope cast not away your confidence don't feel sorry for yourself don't feel depressed don't give up don't look back don't backslide let us escape let us go up at once let us possess our individual inheritance let us possess joy and peace and victory let us climb these seven steps all the way to charity [Music] we still in that court let me warn you this morning church be careful it takes time today in our self-righteous self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy that we're living in this is the prophet an hour that when men and women stand in the churches churches around the world pentecostal baptist methodist said okay and in the message to stand in churches and sing the anthems of god and walk out of that church and smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey and go to dances and live for the world and tell dirty smarty jokes and call themselves christians and men and women can walk from the pulpit or from the church and from the place of the power of the resurrection where that same messiah signs are moving among them and not be a new creature in christ there's something wrong as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man listen in the days of noah the world was populated about like it is today their science was exceeding ours they built things and pyramids and done things we cannot do today and exceeding great smart people and remember science yesterday is one minute before midnight it's one minute before the clock strikes the dead hour is later than we think i hope trust that the holy spirit will sink this into every believer's heart as the days of noah how many were saved in the days of noah out of that generation eight out of many millions are you going to really take this thing for granted as it was and it is a so shall it be the coming of the son of man oh the tens of thousands that there was three saved [Music] time of escape the purpose of this message today is for every predestinated seed to come out of the world and rush to be sealed with the token and the token must be displayed that's why i'm saying young brother young sister in your school it has to be on display in your job it has to be on display in your house it has to be on display as you walk the street it has to be on display we are in a state of emergency we are in a crisis you realize the war in ukraine is still going on right and you see how as time progresses the sensitivity to it has just died on and because it's not close to you you don't feel it unless you're following it make no mistake about you know we in a crisis different levels different changes economic changes all these things everything is moving in order and life comes and life happens feature just get back in the state of normalcy again and you have to be just spiritually censored to realize listen there's movements in the spiritual realm but the brown said he seemed angel is here right now setting in order for the coming of the lord and he seems that the devil is playing out his plan as well i'm getting ready to wind down shortly god hates sin and sin must be judged i'll say it one more time god hates sin and sin must be judged i'm reading the prophet's words you know it's been sedative god doesn't judge america trinidad wherever all around the world pretty soon saying he will have to resurrect solomon gomorrah and apologize to them we will reap what we saw and everybody that got any spirituality to them is realizing that it's the truth we are the end of the road we are not wandering guessing young brother young sister we are not speculating we are not hoping we have a message of vindicated message that is designed to take us out of here and who the son of man set free is free indeed hallelujah and this word that we have been preaching cannot fall to the ground god is calling out to this escape he calling every age he called on the lutherans he called it the wesleyans he called the pentecostals and today he's calling out from the church he's calling a bride he's calling out from the message he's calling a bride from whatever inspiration he's calling our bride god are coming for message inspiration group following teaching movement that's not it you know it's pride from the shout a group that will be the final voice to the final age called out separated an elect lady are you separated are you separated unto god who is going to respond to this call to escape you can't respond in your own time friends go to lord he is the escape theater do it now do it quickly but about him many times with in his healing services he would say stand up receive it receive it now stand up right now stand up quickly uh you see me i was just i just moved when i you know i it's just me does you well you stay there my whole life is just let's take things i said take it take it i said no i keep it you have to realize listen you have to do something different i never see one time you have to respond respond quickly don't respond in your own time you're doing church how you want praying when you want walk in here any time you want no urgency no desperation you see put a macabre suicide and cry for the abomination when lies did you say and cry for the abomination when does it bother you because for some of us we have become so insensitive that you don't bother anymore you know so there's no compelling reason to sigh and cry it just is it it is what it is it's time to escape that is that the devil has desire to have you that's what jesus told peter did he did he's ever did the devil desire to sift you like wheat that's the devil's job you want to feel like wheat shake up your life interrupt your life but i've prayed for you that your faith would feel not so we're not wondering what the devil desire is it is disruptive it is to this it is to kill you so jesus told me that he died that is if you like wheat the devil wants to have you but i prayed for you not that he wouldn't come after you not that you wouldn't have trials and testing but your feet in the midst of your child would not feel that in the midst of your test it will not feel in the midst of oppression your faith would hold you keep you standing on a solid rock of revelation that you are predestinated to overcome and that you're going to make it god told lot hasty escape tether i can't do nothing unless they escape first so friends there's a period of escape there's an opportunity to escape before judgment and ones that escape window closes then it's judgment he told lot i can't judge the world until you come out i can't fail you completely until they come out i can't take control until you need to come out if they come to the world i can't take him to the promised land if you're still in egypt you have to come out i cannot bless you fully if you're still there god told abraham leave your country leave your family leave your household and walk to where i will show you my family boy yes you really in other words you can't go on to anything with god holding on to what you had before you know and that also requires a level of trust that god was able to keep you and bless you and open for you abraham didn't even know what he was walking into but the bible said he's seeking a city whose building maker is god when god speaks your heart keep it closed guard your heart oh hallelujah i'm getting ready to wind up shortly and then nothing could separate us from that love of god that is in christ jesus hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so it's a conference because god isn't going to let the righteous perish with the wicked there is an escape there's going to be a rapture god has made a way he always has a way of escape do you see me made away from moses for joshua for david for daniel he has to make a way for his bride escape follow me into safety into the token the holy ghost itself follow me into adoption perfection and other ephesians follow me to your inheritance blessed be the name of the lord i've preached this many times but i want to close out with this maybe it helps our young brother young sister who's here today maybe listening on the internet on this way of escape there's no scripture that says remember moses remember david remember joshua remember psalms remember daniel there's nothing like it but the bible says remember lord's wife because she was given the opportunity to escape i wonder if people in sodom knew what was about to happen and they were given the opportunity what they would have done with the opportunity how many people in life said they wish they had a better opportunity and some people who are privileged have better opportunities than others how valuable is just an opportunity how blessed are we to just have the opportunity to hear the word the opportunity to know this message the opportunity to know what christ did for us the opportunity to not just know but to accept it the opportunity to not just hear but to recognize the opportunity to let us hear and recognize but to act on the word but lot's wife for whom we don't have her first name her second name she had an opportunity we don't have her name but we are commanded to remember her we remember moses and david and daniel and joshua and elijah but we are actually commanded by god to remember lord's wife i preached this you could forget how to do algebra how to interpret literature how to relate to history you can forget the periodic table pythagoras theorem you get other verses of scripture but make sure you remember lot's wife it remains a message we have to preach because if there's an instruction to remember this thing there's something in there that is an anchor and a note star to us so that we don't make the mistake that she made given the opportunity that she had and given the opportunity we all have this morning to walk in this way of escape we know the story abraham and lot had conflict touching it last week and abraham being who he was said lot you choose it don't make sense we fight on issues and this we have to be bigger than these things and he said a lot wherever you choose you go and lot made his choice again we read the quote you have to make a choice yes no you have to decide you are here by decision what you do later this evening is by decision what you do tomorrow on the holiday is by decision what you do on tuesday is a choice what you do on wednesday night when it's church is a choice this friday night we have zoom premium that's a choice you can make it the most important thing on friday that's your choice you could make sunday so it's a priority i preached this through the whole pandemic when we couldn't gather together people had a choice but how they approach the live stream services and you know what god is the one marking your papers not the pastor not the assistant pastor not the elders and the deacons of the choices god mark any papers still a choice lot didn't go to sodom with bad intentions some of you in school on your job you didn't go to your job some of you thank god to get a job you didn't go there with bad intentions you didn't go there saying i want to i want to fall and say no you open up a business not with bad intentions but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and i think brother gideon in a session we had a few weeks ago speak about lot pitched his tent to sodom he leaned to sodom his direction was sodom and i preached so many times lot was stronger and strong enough for sodom and didn't realize that his family wasn't strong enough i wonder if lot understood the impact on his family if he would have still gone there sometimes we overestimate the people around us sometimes we have expectations that people around us that are beyond their ability to fly where we could fly something we need to think beyond just ourselves because we could almost argue that lot was somewhat selfish because he didn't understand the impact it would have on his children i wonder if lot could have seen a preview of what was going to happen if he would have still done what he did but friends it's unfortunate in life we don't get the preview we don't get the opportunity to see what's going to happen before it happens and then we end up making choices and decisions that we would regret and we say to ourselves if i only knew better i would have done something different and that's why i said this morning don't wait until it becomes a crisis in your life to come back to the altar don't wait for it to be a crisis in your life to get back onto the way of escape and god as he would with every prophet on the earth say abraham shall i hide from you what i'm about to do i'm about to go and bring judgment the stench of sin the stench of this thing has reached me and i can't let it exist the way it is anymore i need to bring judgement what do you think is happening in the world when brother branham was here he was looking around it he saw that lady in the mall with the makeup he said that's what i saw when i went down to hell he said hell is already on here that no how much years ago is it he wanted another lady was sick when he saw the makeup on her face he couldn't believe that she willingly put it like that because he said that's what i saw when i went into hell and you realize hell is on the earth do you realize hell is on the earth has a lot in his family moved into sodom son of moved into them you go to your job you go to your school you talk to your family your cousins your neighbors your relatives and you might be clean at the beginning but if you don't watch carefully you don't realize when you're not just in sodom but now sodom is in you the styles the fashion the music the entertainment the desires the desire to fit into compromise the haircut the clothes they find the clothes you just you're getting pressure because you're feeding on it you're allowing it to affect you and i preached on it and we saw how god justified peter how oh peter rather justified lot in second peter 2 verse 7 and delivered just lord vex with the filthy conversation of the wicked so lot was there in sodom but being bothered by the filthy conversations shame on you men women who not bothered lot in sodom and the bible said vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked you there in the lunch room on your job and then you did it not vexing you it's not bothering you you're not disturbed by it in fact you're you're danny middle brother so and so sister so and so verse 8 of 2nd peter 4 says for that righteous man lot lot maintain a testimony you know that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds so lot is sitting there and he's bothered he is stressed out he's affected and we know it the angel spoke a lot see listen judgment is here you know i've given you an opportunity to escape you don't have to die you don't have to suffer you don't have there's a way out of this world there's a way out of this thing and lot's wife she heard the message she knew the message not just on the lot ministry she grew up under abraham she would have known abraham's testimony knew what they believed but beyond that she recognized the angels it wasn't a man came to speak to him as he angels came she would have heard the angels talking about they came into his house she knew the message she knew about praying she knew about church you know about being in convention she knew enough about the way god operated and she listened to the warning she even responded to the warning she knew the truth she heard a warning she was given the opportunity he could begin to play something softly and she started to walk on the way of escape and friends this is why it is such a painful message to preach because it's truly not he who starts because she responded [Music] and god just said one thing don't look back if you want to be a christian be a real christian but if i'm saying many times you want to be a bum be the best bum you want to be a christian be the best christian live your whole life for the lord but as she is walking the sodom in her begin to overwhelm her i would have preached that lot was i've been walking down because he's leading his family saying come on come on come on we can make it come on let's get out of here [Music] we don't know at what point he stopped here in our footsteps and the most painful part is he couldn't even look back to see what was happening honey everything okay you there i'm not hearing you are you there daughter are you hearing her no daddy i can't hear anymore and you can't even look back to see if she's okay [Music] lot had to keep walking along the way of escape because if he had also looked back he finished i want to encourage you friends this way of escape is before you this morning maybe you've been hanging around maybe you've been tipped to win maybe you've had one foot in one foot out i don't know how you came this morning and i don't know your condition if you're listening on the internet to stay [Music] but the plagues and the judgments are fixing to strike this whole pandemic is just a is nothing compared to what's about to take place but there's a promise to seal the bride for the bride to get into the ark before the terrible plague strike revelation 22 10 he said seem not the sage of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let them be righteous still here is holy let them be holy still let's just stand our feet let's just bow our hands forward of prayer [Music] in the message speak to the rock but i'm saying i warn you in the name of jesus christ get in the kingdom of god now that's right don't you fool about it you press in because there's coming a time when you'll scream and cry to receive the baptism of the holy ghost it'll be shut off from you heavenly father lord we are desperate in our hearts and our souls we are needy people this
