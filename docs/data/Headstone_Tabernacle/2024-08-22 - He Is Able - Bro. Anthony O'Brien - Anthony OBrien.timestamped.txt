[47:35] [Music]
[47:37] able he he he can he can actually do it
[47:41] I need you to believe
[47:43] tonight that he is
[47:46] capable of doing what he
[47:49] said regardless of how it
[47:52] look regardless of how the devil make it
[47:55] look he is still
[47:59] able able to do
[48:06] it man run on for a long time with his
[48:10] own
[48:11] abilities but when he run out of
[48:13] abilities hallu God is just getting
[48:18] started and able what is abble mean it
[48:22] speaks to
[48:24] Ability the abilities
[48:27] isn't that right and abilities are
[48:30] attributes
[48:32] likenesses
[48:34] characteristics it is the power to
[48:36] perform or to do
[48:38] something that's what an ability is
[48:42] isn't that right Genesis 1:6 on God said
[48:48] let us make man Hallelujah in our image
[48:52] and after our
[48:54] likeness after our own abilities hallu
[48:58] the same power that God had he gave it
[49:01] to man and said let that man have
[49:05] dominion over the power of the air over
[49:08] the fowls of the air isn't that right
[49:10] over the fish in the sea and over
[49:14] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[49:17] the abilities that man possessed that
[49:20] man that God created it come from God it
[49:24] was God's ability in man that gave man
[49:29] the ability oh Hallelujah to be like a
[49:32] God on the earth and when he walked on
[49:35] the earth he walked in Dominion when he
[49:39] walked on the earth he walked in Triumph
[49:42] when he walked on the earth he walked in
[49:45] Victory he was not a defeated man but he
[49:49] was a man positionally placed by God and
[49:53] made in the likeness of God with the
[49:56] very abilities of God whatever the
[49:59] animal name that he Nam was a name
[50:02] thereof he could speak to the trees he
[50:05] could speak to the fowls he could speak
[50:07] to the beasts of the field and they had
[50:10] to obey because here was a being walking
[50:14] on the earth that was unlike any other
[50:17] being at that time because God said let
[50:22] us make man
[50:26] in our image and after our
[50:30] likeness therefore that man had the
[50:33] ability to walk like God to talk like
[50:37] God to live like God to reflect God on
[50:41] the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't
[50:44] that right oh hallelujah
[50:47] hallelujah Oh Glory
[50:50] Glory isn't that right
[50:53] tonight
[50:55] amen and
[50:57] amen glory to God
[50:59] hallelujah
[51:02] amen oh
[51:04] my the
[51:06] ability so why do we need God to be
[51:09] able why do we need him Hallelujah to be
[51:14] able we need him to be able because we
[51:18] had a problem after that after God
[51:21] placed man in the Garden of Eden amen
[51:23] and gave him all these abilities that
[51:26] same man fell from his state of power
[51:32] from his state of Glory from his
[51:35] positional place that he was at when God
[51:38] placed him Hallelujah he fell from that
[51:41] place and because he fell from that
[51:44] place he no longer possessed the ability
[51:47] to do the things that he could have done
[51:51] he was now Running Scared whereas before
[51:54] in the Garden of Eden he he had power
[51:57] over everything now he was brought low
[52:01] into a position where he didn't have
[52:03] power over anything he had to run from
[52:06] his life he had to run from the lions
[52:10] run from the Tigers run from the Bears
[52:14] imagine that a man who God placed in
[52:17] power and plac in position is now
[52:20] running and when the presence of God
[52:23] dropped down in the Garden of Eden when
[52:25] the weight of his glory came down that
[52:28] man got scared and actually ran from the
[52:32] presence of God oh Hal isn't that right
[52:35] he ran out of sight he was so out of
[52:39] sight until God had to cry out and say
[52:43] Adam Adam Where Art Thou why are you
[52:48] hiding who told you you are naked where
[52:52] are all those abilities that I put
[52:55] inside of you oh hallelujah hallelujah
[52:58] isn't that right he come into a lowly
[53:01] State isn't that right so we need God to
[53:04] be able because mankind now had a
[53:08] problem that we needed to be
[53:10] solved and the problem wasn't
[53:12] identifying the problem we already know
[53:16] what the problem is man has fallen from
[53:19] his condition isn't that right the
[53:21] problem was finding a solution to the
[53:24] problem and no one was able to solve the
[53:27] problem because we needed someone who
[53:29] was able we needed somebody who could do
[53:32] it but every man that was born oh of a
[53:37] sexual birth after Adam was created out
[53:40] of every man that was born since that
[53:43] time none of them were able to do it
[53:47] none of them were able to redeem none of
[53:51] them were able to restore they were just
[53:55] types they were just Shadows oh
[53:58] Hallelujah that God used throughout the
[54:00] ages but not one of them could do it oh
[54:04] Hallelujah isn't that right oh
[54:06] Hallelujah he was driven out because of
[54:08] sin isn't that right we had a problem
[54:11] but no one was able to solve that
[54:14] problem man himself couldn't save
[54:18] himself oh Hallelujah but he needed
[54:21] someone who was able to do
[54:24] it revelation five says I saw in the
[54:27] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[54:30] a book written within and on the
[54:33] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[54:37] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[54:41] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[54:44] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[54:49] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[54:53] under the Earth was able to open the
[54:56] book
[54:57] neither to look thereon and I wept much
[55:01] because no man was found worthy to open
[55:05] and to read the book neither to look
[55:08] thereon and one of the elders sayth unto
[55:12] me weep not behold because the lion of
[55:17] the tribe of Judah oh that's the one

[55:46] beasts in the midst of the elders stood
[55:49] a lamb as it had been slain having seven
[55:53] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[55:57] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[56:01] Earth he came and took the book out of
[56:06] the right hand of him that sat upon the

[56:13] tonight in that book lay your
[56:16] deliverance in that book lay your fam's

[56:35] took that book out of his hand
[56:40] oh and when he had taken the book The
[56:44] Four beasts and the 4 and 20 Elders fell

[1:01:36] oh my that's
[1:01:39] right the Philadelphia Church age 1960
[1:01:43] oh let's read a quote h s amen Prophet
[1:01:48] said how can it be How can any man know
[1:01:52] he is Christ until he's revealed himself
[1:01:55] to him
[1:01:56] How can any man know you can't reveal it
[1:01:59] to yourself but he is able tonight to
[1:02:02] reveal himself to whosoever he will as
[1:02:07] brother Isaac over preach here on Sunday
[1:02:09] he revealed himself to a little woman at
[1:02:13] the well a little ill famed woman oh my
[1:02:17] oh God bless you for that message
[1:02:18] brother Isaac amen how many appreciated
[1:02:21] it a little ill famed woman oh who
[1:02:25] didn't look like much to look at but she
[1:02:28] had something in her soul it was hidden
[1:02:31] underneath all the dress underneath all
[1:02:34] the filth underneath all the piles of
[1:02:36] dirt that the devil tried to throw on
[1:02:39] her he couldn't depreciate her value he
[1:02:43] couldn't hide her it didn't matter how
[1:02:45] much she did she had an appointment with
[1:02:49] the Supernatural and Jesus keeps all his
[1:02:53] appointments he said I have needs
[1:02:56] pass through Samaria they're trying to
[1:02:58] start a church banal they're trying to
[1:03:01] say I baptize people let me go on from
[1:03:04] here I got somewhere to be but before I
[1:03:07] get there I have to pass through Samaria
[1:03:11] to start a little Revival with a little
[1:03:14] ill Fame woman who nobody want to talk
[1:03:16] to who nobody want to look at who nobody
[1:03:19] wants to regard but that is who God
[1:03:22] called God hide himself behind bad your
[1:03:26] skins God hide himself in Simplicity God
[1:03:31] left potentates he left the powers of
[1:03:33] this world he left Trump he left Obama
[1:03:37] he left ke Rowley he left all of them
[1:03:40] and he come to you tonight because he
[1:03:44] reveal himself to whoever he
[1:03:49] will aren't you glad in this little old
[1:03:52] heart of mine I found a Manger fit for
[1:03:56] the Christ aren't you glad tonight in
[1:04:00] this manger of mine I found something
[1:04:04] without T without Penny without
[1:04:07] [Applause]
[1:04:11] price oh the devil didn't give
[1:04:15] it and the devil
[1:04:17] cannot take it away it is God that give
[1:04:21] it and we thank God for God tonight
[1:04:26] because he is able to do whatever he
[1:04:29] wants to do he is Sovereign which means
[1:04:32] you can't tell him how to do it he will
[1:04:35] do it how he wants to do it and he
[1:04:38] usually does it in a way to confound
[1:04:41] your human
[1:04:43] wisdom to confound your human
[1:04:46] understanding because if he does it the
[1:04:48] way you think it's going to happen then
[1:04:50] you could say it is by your might It Is
[1:04:53] by your strength It Is by your
[1:04:56] but God always like to find some people
[1:04:59] who might not be too educated or have
[1:05:02] too much degrees he always reveal
[1:05:05] himself Among The Humble among the
[1:05:08] simple among those that are willing to
[1:05:11] be broken for his name so that he could
[1:05:14] come down in Simplicity and reveal the
[1:05:18] awesomeness and reveal his power and
[1:05:21] reveal his glory in a way that you would
[1:05:24] not have known in your own mind and not
[1:05:28] have known in your own human Spirits you
[1:05:31] can't figure him out tonight all you've
[1:05:33] got to do is believe when you call on
[1:05:37] his
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:40] name oh you can't figure him out just
[1:05:46] believe God is too
[1:05:48] big to fit in this tiny brain of
[1:05:53] ours this little mind we have
[1:05:56] that we think we're so
[1:05:57] smart but God is too big for that he's
[1:06:01] too
[1:06:02] vast his his knowledge is so high we
[1:06:05] cannot attain unto it he must reveal
[1:06:08] himself isn't that right the prophet
