[1:56] even for the Rapture brother Bram said
[1:58] but he gave us his holy SP spirit and
[2:00] supplied all of our need and he's all of
[2:03] our need tonight I don't think there's
[2:05] anything that you could have a desire
[2:07] for tonight that he didn't already make
[2:09] a way to supply that desire in your
[2:12] heart it's a humbling thing to stand up
[2:15] here seeing the
[2:18] expectation quotes even being posted
[2:20] today and about expecting you know the
[2:24] Lord to move in this weekend and you
[2:25] realize that what the people are
[2:28] expecting out of this weekend is isn't
[2:30] natural It's
[2:32] Supernatural and as a man you realize
[2:34] you're only natural and so you can't
[2:36] provide what they're expecting but there
[2:38] is a supernatural God Amen that can come
[2:42] down in the building tonight and meet
[2:44] the expectation of your heart and that's
[2:47] what we're asking for and maybe just if
[2:50] you have a need on your heart we'll just
[2:52] go in prayer first of all and just talk
[2:54] to the Lord and invite him into this
[2:57] meeting Heavenly Father we come before
[2:59] you you Lord
[3:00] Jesus we feel your presence so
[3:03] powerfully already Lord in this building

[3:13] need of tonight Lord You're the almighty

[3:26] youngest father Lord from the sick to
[3:29] the uh bound Lord to those needing the
[3:32] Holy Ghost tonight father would you just
[3:35] move in on the scene and begin to speak
[3:37] to the hearts and the lives Lord you
[3:39] said that your word is still a discerner
[3:42] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[3:44] and father we just yield ourselves to
[3:46] you as a
[3:47] vessel Lord close our lips from saying
[3:50] anything you'd have us to be silent on
[3:52] and open them to speak what your
[3:54] children have need of father and we'll
[3:56] be sure to give you the glory and the
[3:58] honor and praise
[4:00] in Jesus name amen and amen if you have
[4:04] your Bibles thank you musicians for the
[4:07] music and you could turn with me to the
[4:09] Book of
[4:10] Exodus amen I'm just excited to be in
[4:13] the house of the Lord this weekend
[4:15] looking forward to what the Lord has in
[4:17] store for us in this meeting and just
[4:18] praying that we could say something
[4:20] tonight just to lay a foundation for the
[4:23] rest of the weekend and I just uh can't
[4:27] say how thankful I am to be able to
[4:29] share meeting with these brothers two of
[4:32] my heroes that the Lord has used so
[4:34] mightily in my life not just behind the
[4:36] pulpit but uh just in the daily life the
[4:40] Lord has used them so much for me so to
[4:42] be able to stand here with them it just
[4:43] means the world to
[4:45] me amen Exodus
[4:48] 1 verse one and we'll read
[4:52] down uh maybe to about the 12th
[4:57] verse just been doing a little study and
[4:59] Exodus the last little while and
[5:02] just just want to share what's on our
[5:05] heart it says these are the names of the
[5:07] children of Israel which came into Egypt
[5:10] every man in his household came with
[5:12] Jacob Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah
[5:15] issachar Zebulon and Benjamin Dan and
[5:18] naali Gad and a Asher and all the souls
[5:21] that came out of the loins of Jacob were
[5:23] 70 souls for Joseph was in Egypt already
[5:26] and Joseph died and all his Brethren and
[5:28] all that generation
[5:30] and the children of Israel were fruitful
[5:32] and increased abundantly and multiplied
[5:34] and waxed exceeding Mighty and the land
[5:37] was filled with them now there arose up
[5:39] a new king over Egypt which knew not
[5:41] Joseph and he said unto his people
[5:44] behold the people of the children of
[5:46] Israel are more and mightier than we and
[5:48] come on and let us deal wisely with them
[5:51] lest they multiply and it come to pass
[5:53] that when they fall out any War they
[5:55] join also under enemies and fight
[5:57] against us and so get them up out of the
[6:00] land therefore they did set over them
[6:02] task Masters to afflict them with their
[6:04] burdens and they built for Pharaoh
[6:06] treasure cities pitham and ramsy but the
[6:08] more they Afflicted them the more they
[6:10] multiplied and grew and they were
[6:12] grieved because of the children of
[6:14] Israel and just a couple verses in 2
[6:17] Kings
[6:18] 3 very familiar it says in verse 15 now
[6:22] bring me a Minstrel and it came to pass
[6:24] when the minstrel played that the hand
[6:27] of the Lord came upon him speaking of
[6:30] Elijah or Elisha forgive me and it said
[6:33] he said thus sayith the Lord make this
[6:35] Valley full of ditches for thus sayith
[6:37] the Lord You shall not see wind neither
[6:40] shall you see rain yet that Valley shall
[6:42] be filled with water that you may drink
[6:44] both ye and your cattle and your Beast
[6:47] amen you may have your seats this
[6:49] evening anden we just want to take a
[6:51] thought out of there if we could on
[6:54] getting in the spirit of Exodus getting
[6:57] in the spirit of Exodus and uh I just
[6:59] want to say greetings to my family as
[7:01] well good to have them my aunt and
[7:03] Grandma there we're just thankful that
[7:05] they could be here sure love them amen
[7:08] if we could just begin to break into
[7:09] this thought on Exodus and speak of
[7:12] getting in the spirit of Exodus brother
[7:15] Brandon would uh begin to teach us on
[7:17] the importance of getting in the spirit
[7:19] and he' say you know that you can't do
[7:21] anything good until first you get in the
[7:24] spirit and if you uh if you fail to get
[7:26] in the spirit then all of your efforts
[7:28] will be in vain and I think that that
[7:30] applies to this meeting this weekend
[7:33] amen I I if as a minister you know very
[7:36] well that when you're trying to study
[7:37] for a sermon it's important to get in
[7:39] the spirit and when that spirit's not
[7:42] there you just sometimes feel like
[7:43] you're hitting against a wall and you
[7:45] you don't know which way to go but when
[7:47] that anointing begins to settle down and
[7:49] the Lord begins to lead you through
[7:50] those channels and you realize that
[7:53] without the spirit all your efforts
[7:54] would be in vain amen but it takes the
[7:57] singers to get in the spirit it takes
[7:59] them musicians to get in the spirit and
[8:02] as the Bible says and brother Ry spoke
[8:04] on this some Sunday if you were here
[8:05] Sunday what a powerful sermon that was
[8:09] amen but the Bible says about John I was
[8:11] in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[8:13] brother brand said I think we could just
[8:14] call those words the whole of the
[8:16] Christian Life he said if I'm going to
[8:18] sing I'll sing in the spirit if I'm
[8:20] going to pray I'll pray in the spirit
[8:22] and so that's what we want to do is get
[8:24] in the spirit and brother brandham said
[8:26] that the spirit was not John's spirit
[8:28] because getting in his own Spirit would
[8:30] not cause him to see those Visions but
[8:32] he got in the spirit of God am me and it
[8:36] it is possible to get in the wrong
[8:38] Spirit you see out in the world how they
[8:40] they have their dances and they have
[8:42] their music and they they get in the
[8:43] spirit of it but it's it's the spirit of
[8:45] the devil it's it's not the spirit of
[8:47] God and they get in the spirit of their
[8:49] baseball games and and they'll shout and
[8:52] they'll rejoice and then they'll look at
[8:54] a holy ghost meeting like this and say
[8:56] such fanaticism me but it's just because
[8:59] they didn't get in the spirit of the
[9:02] meeting amen but but they would call it
[9:04] holy rollers and of course brother
[9:06] Brandon would tell us well if this is
[9:07] Holy Rollers then that must be on holy
[9:10] rollers and me because they're still
[9:12] getting in the spirit of something
[9:13] they're just not getting in the spirit
[9:15] of the word of God and brother brandom
[9:17] says you know how you notice how they
[9:19] get into the spirit of things in the
[9:20] world and he said but oh how they hate
[9:23] the Christians for getting into the
[9:25] spirit of God's word they call us
[9:27] Fanatics and holy rollers there's no
[9:29] nothing they won't do to show their
[9:31] hatred and disapproval he said but
[9:33] ignore that you can expect it knowing
[9:35] where it is coming from just go on and
[9:37] get in the spirit of worship amen you
[9:40] can expect the world to Amen to to call
[9:43] it fanaticism you can expect the world
[9:45] to criticize this message so you just go
[9:48] ahead and get in the spirit of worship
[9:50] anyhow Amen in a in a meeting like this
[9:52] I believe that we can just go ahead and
[9:54] have a meeting amen I believe we can
[9:56] just go ahead and lay aside the cares of
[9:58] the weak and the cares of the world Amen
[10:01] and just begin to get in the spirit of
[10:03] the meeting that the Lord might come
[10:04] down amongst us and begin to minister to
[10:07] the desires and the needs of his people
[10:09] and me because brother Brandon said that
[10:11] there will never be Revival until you
[10:12] get into the spirit of Revival he said
[10:15] the preacher can preach even amen but
[10:17] the preacher doesn't carry the Revival
[10:19] am mean because a Revival amen maybe the
[10:22] Lord be wanting to send a Revival but
[10:24] it'll take the people to get in the
[10:26] spirit of Revival to receive what the
[10:28] Lord is wanting to say send amen you've
[10:30] got to get in the spirit of receiving
[10:32] because the Lord I mean he's already
[10:34] promised it in his word and so he's
[10:36] already willing to send it but
[10:37] somebody's got to get in the spirit to
[10:39] receive what the Lord is wanting to send
[10:42] Amen brother Brandon preached out of
[10:44] that message getting in the spirit on
[10:46] that scripture making the valley full of
[10:48] ditches and he said that the minstral
[10:50] begin to play and and as the minstral
[10:53] played a mean in one place he says maybe
[10:55] he was playing only believe or in
[10:57] another place he said maybe they were
[10:59] clapping their hands but whatever it was
[11:01] it put Elisha in the spirit that the
[11:04] presence of the Lord may come upon him
[11:06] and and begin to deal with him by way of
[11:08] vision Amen brother brandom said he saw
[11:10] Vision because the word of the Lord
[11:12] comes to the prophet and that was God's
[11:15] program to deal with a prophet was
[11:17] through vision amen but what was the
[11:19] vision brother brandom said he wasn't
[11:20] telling them to go amen build schools or
[11:23] GO train in theology or to get on a
[11:26] different uniform but he said the
[11:28] message was to get to digging amen and
[11:30] you'll find the water that you're
[11:32] searching for am mean amen and brother
[11:35] say that amen any true Prophet today
[11:37] still has the same message it's not amen
[11:39] go uh uh call down rain from some
[11:42] foreign denomination or from some School
[11:44] of Theology said the water is already
[11:47] there because the rock that was in the
[11:49] wilderness that the children of Israel
[11:51] got water from those pools of water were
[11:54] still laying in that desert land and if
[11:56] they would just get to digging the logs
[11:57] out they could have access access to the
[11:59] same spirit in the same Revival that
[12:02] Moses had access to amen and that
[12:04] children of God had access to throughout
[12:07] all the ages and I I believe that
[12:09] applies tonight that the same Holy Ghost
[12:11] amen that your parents received and your
[12:13] grandparents is still available in the
[12:15] house of God tonight if you'll just get
[12:17] to digging am mean all the logs of it's
[12:20] not for me amen and it just can't happen
[12:23] tonight or I'm going to wait for another
[12:24] weekend or another service what you do
[12:27] is you get your shovel and begin to dig
[12:28] in those logs out and invite the
[12:31] presence of God to come on the scene in
[12:32] your life and give you the desire of
[12:35] your heart and he said those
[12:37] logs of maybe you you've got something
[12:40] against your brother or you've held
[12:41] something in your heart well now now
[12:43] would be the time to let that go amen
[12:45] don't wait till the end of the service
[12:47] now would be the time to just throw out
[12:49] that little Grudge that little funny
[12:51] feeling oh just throw it
[12:53] out oh get to digging and you'll find
[12:56] that the water's there oh but like how
[12:59] brother brandom said it he said as long
[13:01] as you say well bless God I'm Methodist
[13:03] I don't have to put up with such I'm
[13:05] Baptist assemblies I'm W this all right
[13:07] go ahead you'll never see the vision he
[13:09] said but you throw that thing aside and
[13:11] get into the vision see Jesus coming and
[13:14] the church perishing here and get into
[13:16] the vision dig right down brother I'm
[13:18] telling you something will happen to you
[13:20] then you'll get in the spirit of Revival
[13:23] I like how he says there get in the
[13:25] vision because you see you may not be a
[13:27] prophet brother Taz you may not be be
[13:29] able to see a vision the way brother
[13:30] brandham did but you can get into a
[13:33] vision amen God the word of the Lord God
[13:35] sends his word to the prophets and he
[13:37] uses them to see the vision for the age
[13:40] to see the vision for the hour We're
[13:41] living but somebody must get into the
[13:44] vision of the message of the hour and
[13:46] inhabit that Vision over their lives for
[13:49] brother the Bible says without Vision
[13:51] the people perish am mean and you see
[13:54] how he would tell people that would come
[13:55] up in the prayer line and begin to
[13:57] instruct them that amen that if you'll
[13:59] just notice there's a well body standing
[14:01] right out in front of you and Jesus
[14:03] Christ is calling you to that well body
[14:06] and just start walking towards that well
[14:08] body and mean he was giving them a
[14:10] vision amen of a well body that they
[14:12] wouldn't have to remain in their
[14:13] sickness but they would have to get into
[14:15] that Vision to begin to walk into that
[14:17] well body and walk out of the sickness
[14:20] that they were in oh it's important to
[14:23] get into the
[14:24] vision amen dig out and get into the
[14:27] vision ien we look at the definition of
[14:30] getting in the spirit it's to become
[14:32] enthusiastic or excited about something
[14:35] fully embracing the atmosphere mood of
[14:37] an in event or activity and and if you
[14:41] uh just switch it to the phrase get in
[14:43] the spirit I like how it says it fully
[14:45] embrace the enthusiasm and positive
[14:47] attitude surrounding a particular event
[14:49] or occasion Often by actively
[14:52] participating in activities related to
[14:54] it and I like this and adopting its
[14:57] theme amen because if you're going to
[14:59] get in the spirit amen of this
[15:01] Springtime amen you're going to put away
[15:03] your winter decorations and begin to set
[15:05] out the flowers and set out the spring
[15:07] decorations and if you're going to get
[15:09] in the spirit of of the football season
[15:11] you're going to say well I'm an Ohio
[15:13] State fan or I'm this fan and and I got
[15:16] this jersey and you begin to adopt the
[15:18] theme of what you get into the spirit of
[15:21] and mean and as a Christian Satan would
[15:23] try to get you to adopt the wrong theme
[15:25] over your life and mean then you begin
[15:27] to adopt the theme that I'm depressed or
[15:30] I'm anxious or I'm never going to make
[15:32] it and you begin to let that become the
[15:34] vision and you begin to adopt it until
[15:36] that's the only thing you see and that's
[15:38] the only thing you talk about is just
[15:40] wowy wowy woo am mean look at me and
[15:42] look at my problems amen but may if you
[15:45] take the word of God that we've been
[15:47] given it's a Clear Vision over your life
[15:49] and you begin to adopt the theme of the
[15:51] word and place of the devil's theme and
[15:53] you say by his stripes I am healed and
[15:56] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[15:58] shall recover go into all the world and
[16:00] preach the gospel I'm a Son of God I'm
[16:02] free I'm delivered I'm going to make it
[16:05] I'm going in a Rapture my children are
[16:07] going with me amen and you begin to
[16:09] adopt the theme of the vision of the
[16:11] word over your life and before you know
[16:14] it you won't be in the same condition
[16:16] but you'll be walking in a well body
[16:18] you'll be walking in a body change
[16:20] you'll be walking amen with your
[16:22] children because amen the word works and
[16:24] it should be the theme of Our Lives amen
[16:27] it's getting in the spirit of it getting
[16:29] in the spirit of your healing getting in
[16:31] the spirit of your deliverance amen and
[16:33] getting in the spirit of Exodus if we
[16:36] could say it that way because Exodus
[16:38] means to come out yeah amen and uh the
[16:42] the As We Lay the foundation for the the
[16:45] background to the promise of an exodus
[16:47] amen the word the Lord promised Abraham
[16:49] in Genesis 15 that uh Noah assurity that
[16:53] thy seed shall be a Stranger in a
[16:55] Strange Land that is not theirs and
[16:57] Shall Serve them and they shall afflict
[16:59] them 400 years but afterward they shall
[17:02] come out with great substance you see
[17:04] the iniquity of the amorites was not yet
[17:06] fulfilled so they couldn't possess the
[17:08] land at that time but they were given a
[17:10] promise that this land belonged to them
[17:13] and after 400 years they would be able
[17:15] to leave their condition and possess the
[17:17] land that was promised them and but
[17:20] brother Brandon tells us that sometimes
[17:22] the cogs of God's will turn slow but
[17:24] they turn sure he said God makes
[17:27] everything work together right just like
[17:30] cogs amen just like cogs and he says we
[17:33] see it off sometimes in a distance and
[17:35] wonder could it ever be but it always
[17:37] happens just the way God said it would
[17:39] be amen so we we want to put that in our
[17:43] remembrance first of all is that I mean
[17:45] The Exodus is right on time I mean and
[17:48] sometimes you go through seasons of your
[17:49] life and sometimes you go through
[17:51] seasons of waiting and sometimes you go
[17:53] through seasons of Deliverance amen but
[17:56] just remember that the cogs of God's
[17:58] prophecy May sometimes turn slow but
[18:01] they always turn sure Amen in your time
[18:04] and sight elements amen begin to wonder
[18:06] and worry how is this going to happen
[18:09] amen but time and sigh are two of the
[18:11] worst enemies God has because they don't
[18:13] declare anything about God am me but
[18:16] what the word says is true am mean we
[18:19] spoke on it before but we'll bring it to
[18:21] your memory that in literature there's a
[18:23] phrase called the day Numan and that's
[18:25] the closing scenes in literature where
[18:28] all the loose ends of the plot begin to
[18:30] come together and mean and the things
[18:33] that you wonder about am mean that's
[18:34] when they begin to tie together those
[18:36] loose SS begin to come together in the
[18:39] end of the book amen but you're looking
[18:41] at it if you're just looking at where
[18:43] you're at right now you're wondering
[18:44] how's it all going to come together amen
[18:46] it looks like the hour's so late how
[18:48] how's this prodigal going to come home
[18:50] how's this going to happen how's this
[18:51] going to happen amen but it's the cogs
[18:54] of God's will are turning sure although
[18:57] maybe it may seem slow to you
[18:59] but it's right on time and just in the
[19:01] right season Deliverance will come and
[19:04] God will tie those loosens together and
[19:06] make it work out for the good oh my I I
[19:09] thank God for it because sometimes we've
[19:12] been in those situations I think even of
[19:14] uh Bethany there she was uh it was the
[19:17] first service I preached here in New
[19:19] Year's and she was we were well if you
[19:22] know our story we had some breakups and
[19:23] we had probably about four or five of
[19:26] them but and if you ask me maybe who's
[19:28] fault it was or who whose fault it was
[19:30] you might get a different story but
[19:32] probably my
[19:34] fault but there she was she she she was
[19:37] in a spot where she was about tired of
[19:39] it and she was ready to move down to
[19:41] Arkansas and just go back and give it
[19:44] all up and am mean it kind of in a tough
[19:47] place there amen but but but there in
[19:49] that new year service amen the power of
[19:52] God if you remember it began to fall
[19:54] down at the end and brother Ray got up
[19:56] behind all all the ministers and began
[19:58] to pray and the anointing fell in that
[20:00] building and right back there where she
[20:02] was the power of God fell on her life
[20:05] and gave her such a a rebaptism and and
[20:08] just a few weeks later she started
[20:09] dating a preacher and then ended up
[20:11] marrying a preacher and now we got a son
[20:14] amen but but what it was you know if
[20:15] you're looking at it in the natural eye
[20:17] here it looks bad it looks like you know
[20:19] she was ready to move and give it all up
[20:21] but there in a moment am mean it can
[20:23] begin to change and turn around and all
[20:25] of a sudden you're realizing that those
[20:28] loose ends aren't so loose after all
[20:30] amen but God was always in
[20:33] control he's a mighty God Amen but if
[20:36] you look at this amen here they were in
[20:39] Egypt and the arrangement for them to be
[20:41] in Egypt was brother BR said they were
[20:42] located in Egypt because of the drought
[20:45] and here conditions that were hard had
[20:48] driven them amen to this Egypt condition
[20:51] but I I think about there was Jacob and
[20:53] there was Joseph there in that land and
[20:56] there they were in the mid M of Egypt
[20:59] but brother Carrie they never forgot the
[21:01] promise of an exodus because while they
[21:04] were there in Egypt am me Jacob said you
[21:07] better not bury my bones down here in
[21:09] Egypt because I know a promise and one
[21:12] day we're going to come out of here and
[21:15] Joseph did the same thing he said you
[21:16] can put me in a casket but don't you
[21:18] leave me here because one of these days
[21:21] am mean we're going to come out of this
[21:22] land they always had that promise in
[21:24] their mind because job had prophesied
[21:27] that yet in his flesh he would see God
[21:30] and Jacob and Joseph by spiritual
[21:32] Revelation knew that the Exodus and the
[21:34] resurrection wouldn't take place in
[21:36] Egypt but it would take place in the
[21:37] promised land and Abraham and Sarah and
[21:40] Isaac were buried there with Jacob
[21:42] brother brandom said if you notice and
[21:44] Jacob and Joseph said that's where we're
[21:46] going to be buried because that's where
[21:48] the resurrection is going to take place
[21:51] oh and brother brandom said I caught the
[21:52] spiritual revelation of the coming of
[21:54] the Lord and that's why I left the
[21:56] Baptist Church because I knew that the
[21:58] res would Resurrection wouldn't take
[22:00] place in the Baptist Church or the
[22:02] Methodist Church or the Lutheran church
[22:04] but it would take place in Christ so he
[22:06] gave up the denomination and got birth
[22:09] into a spirit that would take him in a
[22:12] resurrection oh that if you want to get
[22:14] in the spirit of Exodus you're going to
[22:15] have to get the Holy Ghost because it
[22:17] said by one Spirit we're baptized into
[22:19] one body and the same spirit that raised
[22:21] Jesus from the grave if it dwells in you
[22:23] it'll Quicken your mortal body oh that's
[22:26] how you get in the spirit of Exodus you
[22:28] remember that we're not here to stay and
[22:31] we're going to begin to get in the
[22:32] spirit that's going to take us out of
[22:34] here oh I think it's important to
[22:37] remember that we are not here to stay in
[22:39] this world am mean when you go on a trip
[22:42] brother Nick amen you you you maybe just
[22:44] gone for a couple days and so you pack a
[22:46] suitcase and and instead of uh uh making
[22:49] yourself at home you just live out of
[22:50] that suitcase for a couple days because
[22:52] you say I'm here but I'm not here to
[22:54] stay and you don't settle in because
[22:56] that's not your Dwelling Place and I
[22:58] think that's how it is in this world we
[23:00] should remember that we're here but
[23:02] we're not here to stay amen uh here we
[23:06] have no continuing City brother Brandon
[23:08] would say he said you know that old
[23:09] house brother Zachary that he thought
[23:11] would stand for hundred of years they
[23:13] begin to put a Housing Development there
[23:15] and tore it down he said what happened
[23:17] to to this one and that one they've gone
[23:19] on what happened to Dad what happened to
[23:21] Charles he said they've gone on and he
[23:24] said but here we have no continuing City
[23:26] and we brought nothing into this world
[23:28] and it's certain will take nothing out
[23:30] amen so why should we get so worried
[23:33] amen about how we're going to pay the
[23:34] bills and and maybe you lost your job
[23:37] and maybe you're worried about how this
[23:38] is going to happen and that's going to
[23:40] happen but all the while am mean you
[23:42] should remember that this is not your
[23:44] Dwelling Place you're just here amen for
[23:46] a season but we're going out of here one
[23:48] of these days anden you are not of this
[23:50] world Amen but you are of another world
[23:53] you are the children amen of an Unseen
[23:55] World and this is only a temporary
[23:57] dwelling but one of these mornings anden
[23:59] a sweep's going to come through here and
[24:01] take you home to where you belong oh
[24:04] it's a temporary dwelling place oh and I
[24:07] think if the Lord has gone to prepare a
[24:10] place for us brother Nathaniel and he
[24:12] would write that I has not seen or Ear
[24:14] Has Not Heard amen what weights in store
[24:17] amen for us that love him amen then I
[24:19] think it's important to remember brother
[24:21] Elijah that if the Lord is calling us
[24:23] out of something amen then he has
[24:25] something better in store amen the Lord
[24:28] is calling you out of a condition if the
[24:30] Lord's calling you into higher Heights
[24:32] and mean and you think well I'm
[24:34] comfortable here I I've got used to
[24:36] where I'm at I don't know if I want to
[24:38] move but just remember if the Lord is
[24:40] calling you out of something he's got
[24:42] something better for you amen he's got a
[24:44] greater Heights for you oh he's got
[24:47] healing for
[24:48] you I think it's important to remember
[24:51] Amen in the spiritual that when you're
[24:53] in a trial and you're in a sickness that
[24:56] you can look the devil in the eye and
[24:57] say devil I'm here but I'm not here to
[25:00] stay Amen brother Bram said that's what
[25:03] he's spreading this morning to you sick
[25:05] people you sick people that seems like
[25:07] you're going to sit there all your life
[25:09] if the devil can get you to believe that
[25:11] he's got you oh my that's where the
[25:15] rubber meets the road friends you've
[25:17] been sick for a long time and the
[25:19] devil's trying to get you to believe
[25:21] that you're going to remain there
[25:22] forever but that's when he gets you amen
[25:25] but brother BR tells a testimony about a
[25:27] sister said she had bad ankles and high
[25:29] blood pressure and many things wrong
[25:31] with her amen but brother BR said Satan
[25:33] would give her a stroke if he could he'd
[25:35] lay her up yonder on the bed of
[25:37] Affliction he'll put her out of her
[25:39] commission if he can for he don't want
[25:41] her
[25:42] testimony oh my tonight Satan don't want
[25:45] your testimony and me and that's why
[25:47] he's putting afflictions upon you and
[25:49] that's why he's putting troubles upon
[25:51] you because he doesn't want your
[25:52] testimony and Satan's try to convince
[25:55] you that it's because God doesn't love
[25:56] you or because you obeyed and you're
[25:59] reaping what you sold and you're out of
[26:01] the will of God but that's a lie from
[26:02] the pits of Hell amen it is God's will
[26:05] to heal tonight just the same as it was
[26:07] yesterday and the day before and it's
[26:09] not his will for you to suffer if it was
[26:12] his will for you to suffer then he
[26:13] defeated his own will when he came on
[26:16] the earth and begin to heal the sick and
[26:18] deliver the bound but it's a lie from
[26:20] the devil trying to keep you in your
[26:22] condition because he don't want your
[26:23] testimony oh but brother brandom told
[26:25] that girl he said it's like that blind
[26:27] boy that they asked why are you blind
[26:29] because your mother sinned or your
[26:30] father sinned he said no neither but
[26:32] that the glory of God might be made
[26:34] manifest and that's the Satan's Tred to
[26:36] put Affliction upon you but it's not
[26:39] because you were disobedient amen am me
[26:41] he's many times he'll try to lie to you
[26:43] and think that it's because of this or
[26:44] it's because of that and believe that
[26:46] it's God's will for you to stay there
[26:48] but I'd say probably a good 90 95% of
[26:51] the time I know there's special cases so
[26:53] amen forgive me for that but the
[26:55] majority of the time it's just the devil
[26:57] amen trying to to hold you down in a
[26:59] cage of bondage and affliction and make
[27:01] you believe that you belong there but
[27:03] you don't belong there you belong in a
[27:05] healthy body you belong in a healthy
[27:07] mind you belong in a healthy soul and a
[27:10] healthy Spirit tonight oh and Satan
[27:12] don't want your testimony but I think we
[27:14] should be determined tonight to be a
[27:16] testimony for the glory of God oh get
[27:19] some get some determination about you
[27:21] that I'm going to rise up and I'm going
[27:23] to receive something from the Lord this
[27:25] weekend and I'm going to become a
[27:27] testimony for the kingdom of God oh I'll
[27:30] not listen to The Devil's lie amen
[27:32] there's a reason he's attacking you oh
[27:36] and you think it's because that God's
[27:37] forgotten you but no Satan sees
[27:39] something in you that he's trying to
[27:41] Snuff out oh but he doesn't have the
[27:43] power to do
[27:45] it oh you see it's you you must get
[27:49] determined that you're not going to stay
[27:51] where you're at you must get an
[27:53] enthusiasm about you that you're going
[27:55] to rise higher because Satan will try to
[27:57] get you built up in a complex of
[28:00] self-pity to try to hold you there you
[28:02] see self-pity is an enemy to Healing
[28:05] because it'll try to hold you in a
[28:07] complex and then put your Stakes down
[28:09] and think well I've been sick for so
[28:11] long and I got prayed for but I'm not
[28:13] feeling any better but it's a cage
[28:15] holding you in your sickness amen but
[28:17] God is calling out of your sickness
[28:19] calling you out of that complex and
[28:22] calling you into a well body oh brother
[28:24] brandom said you'll resent me when I
[28:26] tell you that amen because you don't
[28:28] like to hear it and because you want to
[28:30] be you want to be pied you want people
[28:32] to feel bad for you and that's okay
[28:34] sometimes but sometimes it becomes the
[28:36] very thing that holds you in your
[28:38] sickness amen but get determined to
[28:41] break out of that complex tonight and
[28:43] say now is the day of my healing now is
[28:46] the day of my salvation now is the day
[28:49] where I'm going to become a testimony
[28:51] for the glory of God oh brother brandom
[28:53] said there was a woman with a blood
[28:55] issue for 12 years but she didn't have
[28:58] self-pity but when the master came by oh
[29:01] she said this is my opportunity that
[29:03] I've been waiting for in 12 years she
[29:05] suffered oh but in a moment in the
[29:07] presence of the Lord amen the word set
[29:10] her free oh what about blind bmus what
[29:13] about the the the the the the woman or
[29:16] the man at the pool of Bethesda I
[29:18] believe it was 30 some years he was sick
[29:20] but in a moment with the master he
[29:23] didn't pity himself he said this is my
[29:25] Exodus this is my moment of Deliverance
[29:28] oh my I think about Abraham and Sarah
[29:30] for 25 years they suffered but you know
[29:33] what they did brother Mike they didn't
[29:34] just sit there and complain but they
[29:36] went to the store and they got little
[29:38] booties for their baby they begin to get
[29:40] a crib what were they doing they were
[29:42] adopting the theme of The Promise oh
[29:45] they didn't just sit there and weary and
[29:47] worry they begin to adopt the theme oh
[29:49] of the oncoming visitation oh what about
[29:53] a girl named Mariah puid I I I stood
[29:56] actually I was the very next person
[29:57] behind behind her in that prayer line
[29:59] and there in that prayer line with that
[30:01] aliper that was robbing her of her hair
[30:04] she took those bobby pins into the
[30:06] presence of God and said I'm not going
[30:08] to adopt the theme of alopecia I'm not
[30:10] going to stay in this condition and pity
[30:12] myself and but I'm going to adopt the
[30:14] theme of The Glory of my hair being
[30:17] restored and she stands tonight with a
[30:19] headful of hair because she adopted the
[30:22] theme of her healing oh and it brought
[30:24] her
[30:25] out oh you see yes sometimes you got to
[30:29] change your
[30:30] expectation amen sometimes I know what
[30:33] it's like you come into a service after
[30:35] service and sometimes you're going
[30:37] through a low spot in your life and if
[30:39] you're not careful you'll start coming
[30:41] to service or or or coming to a new day
[30:45] and you're expecting trouble you're
[30:47] expecting to have a bad day you start to
[30:49] get into a theme of expecting bad days
[30:52] and trouble and and problems amen but
[30:55] that's when you have to change your
[30:57] expectation
[30:58] amen and say no this is not the way it's
[31:00] going to be I'm going to stop expecting
[31:02] trouble and start expecting a miracle
[31:05] I'm going to stop expecting trouble and
[31:08] problems and start expecting God to move
[31:10] I'm going to start expecting the coming
[31:12] of the Lord I'm going to start expecting
[31:14] my children to come back I'm going to
[31:16] stop expecting what Satan's trying to
[31:19] feed into my mind and I'm going to start
[31:21] expecting the promises of God to come to
[31:24] pass brother brandom said you heard
[31:26] about the lady that prayed for the
[31:27] Mountain to be moved and got up the next
[31:30] morning and looked out the window and
[31:31] said just as I expected still there well
[31:34] that's the reason she expected
[31:36] it that's right true he said if you
[31:39] expect that's what you receive right but
[31:42] then he said what about that se
[31:43] Phoenician woman amen who said uh Lord
[31:47] yet the dogs under the table eat of the
[31:48] children's crumbs and Jesus said for
[31:50] this thing go the devil's gone out and
[31:52] she went home and found the devil gone
[31:55] out of her daughter just as the Lord has
[31:57] said
[31:58] she didn't say well Lord you should have
[31:59] done it this way or Lord you should have
[32:01] done it that way but just whatever the
[32:03] word said that's what she expected to
[32:05] find and she found it and me brother BR
[32:08] said well if it never happened last
[32:10] night I'll be expecting it tomorrow
[32:11] night it'll be tomorrow night I'll be
[32:13] the one I'll be the one that receives
[32:15] the Holy Ghost I'll be the first one at
[32:17] the altar to repent of my sins I'll be
[32:18] the first one that God sanctifies and
[32:20] takes all the world out of me he said
[32:23] ask and you shall F find seek and you
[32:25] shall find knock and it'll be over and
[32:28] ask and it'll be given unto you so
[32:31] that's what you should expect brother
[32:33] Bram said are you going to be expecting
[32:34] a great healing service tomorrow night
[32:36] yes sir are you going to be expecting
[32:39] the Lord to pour out his blessings
[32:40] tomorrow night sure let's be expecting
[32:43] it be under expectation he said I expect
[32:46] the church to be on fire the glory of
[32:48] the Lord falling everywhere Sinners
[32:51] around the Altar and people getting
[32:53] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[32:55] just a great thing my anticipation
[32:58] and expectations is built way up high oh
[33:01] friends I think it's time you start
[33:03] letting your expectation match who you
[33:05] are amen and not match some
[33:08] denominational amen amen just weary
[33:11] lousy amen religious Christian amen but
[33:14] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[33:16] are adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[33:18] and you should allow your expectation to
[33:21] match who you are and me now we are sons
[33:23] of God you're not children of the devil
[33:25] you're Children of the promise children
[33:28] of God and you have a right to speak a
[33:30] word under inspiration and expect it to
[33:32] come to pass exactly like you spoke it
[33:35] Amen brother brandom spoke Three
[33:37] Squirrels am mean he shouldn't be
[33:39] expecting one squirrel or two squirrels
[33:41] he spoke Three Squirrels oh and if you
[33:44] let your expectation match who you are
[33:46] amen and stop giving your ground to the
[33:49] devil amen but put down a steak and say
[33:51] no the one who spoke it is the one who
[33:54] will perform it and I'm not going to let
[33:56] it slide I'm not going to give an inch
[33:59] to the devil amen and when you feel
[34:01] doubts coming in you doubt your doubts
[34:04] oh let your expectations match your
[34:07] identity you say well Exodus doesn't
[34:09] look
[34:10] possible well I'm glad you said that you
[34:13] see Joseph you see the orchestration of
[34:17] Joseph's life he was sold into
[34:19] slavery but all the while he was
[34:21] fulfilling a type of Christ and things
[34:24] were getting into position for an exodus
[34:27] amen and God had given him favor and
[34:29] used him to save Egypt in the seven
[34:31] years of famine he had built such a
[34:33] reputation till I mean for those 400
[34:35] years amen they remembered him and what
[34:37] the Lord had done through his life but
[34:39] there rose up a new pharaoh who knew not
[34:42] Joseph and brother Brown said that this
[34:44] would Mark the beginning of an exodus
[34:46] and the the SEI had come after ramsy and
[34:49] he knew not the blessings of Joseph you
[34:51] see said he I don't know how you
[34:53] pronounce it but he honored Joseph but
[34:56] Ramsay's come along and didn't care he
[34:59] didn't honor the prophet he didn't honor
[35:01] Joseph but but here he come on the scene
[35:03] am mean but just at the right time
[35:05] because that was where Exodus was going
[35:07] to begin and and he feared the children
[35:09] of Israel as we read there in the the
[35:12] this opening text and mean and he began
[35:14] to order the midwives that if it was a
[35:17] male son that they should kill it and
[35:19] mean because he feared wh What the Lord
[35:22] was going to do he feared the promise
[35:24] and the prophecies amen but brother
[35:26] Brown said this book of EX this is based
[35:28] upon three heads he said it's based upon
[35:31] the power of Satan the power of faith
[35:33] and the power of God and he said Satan
[35:36] mostly knows God's program mostly but he
[35:39] tries to interfere and brother BR said
[35:42] we found out that Satan begin to display
[35:45] his power always first you know what
[35:48] that reminds me of is in is there
[35:50] anything too hard for the Lord Brother
[35:51] brand tells about Abraham and Sarah and
[35:54] how they were going to receive an
[35:55] oncoming visitation but Satan try to
[35:58] interrupt it and get them to think that
[36:00] something was wrong because the power of
[36:02] Satan usually always knows the program
[36:05] of God enough to act first so when you
[36:07] see that happening you begin to identify
[36:10] that this is the power of Satan and it's
[36:13] not that anything is wrong amen how many
[36:16] of you just had a perfect week with no
[36:18] troubles no it's a it's a meetings week
[36:22] you're going to have some bumps you're
[36:24] going to have some bruises but something
[36:26] that uh our pastor P helped teach me is
[36:29] that when you see those things that's
[36:30] not when you begin to doubt that
[36:32] something's wrong that's when you say
[36:33] okay there's an oncoming visitation the
[36:36] Lord's going to perform an exodus and
[36:38] this is just the power of Satan trying
[36:40] to act first to Snuff it out but he
[36:42] can't do it because God has ordained it
[36:45] and God has promised it should come oh
[36:47] and I believe that about this weekend
[36:49] and mean you may have had to fight
[36:51] through troubles and trials to get
[36:53] hereen but you look that devil in the
[36:55] eye and say no am mean I'm not going to
[36:57] doubt the the the the the the promise
[37:00] that I came for this weekend but this is
[37:02] my visitation hour this is my visitation
[37:06] time this is my weekend oh my you feel
[37:10] it even last night I begin to wonder I
[37:14] started it just seemed like I I couldn't
[37:16] get into that anointing and I think Lord
[37:18] you know you begin to wonder there
[37:19] something wrong you know and I got the
[37:20] wrong text and I just thought oh no uh
[37:23] Satan you may be trying to interfere but
[37:25] I'm expecting an oncoming visitation
[37:27] this weekend amen and so I'm not going
[37:29] to get worked up about something being
[37:31] wrong but I'm just going to keep
[37:33] studying this word because I believe
[37:34] God's going to do something in our midst
[37:37] oh it's just a devil when you realize
[37:39] his tactics you can recognize them and
[37:41] call him a bluff and begin to go forward
[37:44] in faith oh it's nothing wrong he tried
[37:47] to kill Abel Amen to stop that lineage
[37:50] he tried to kill Christ and here he
[37:52] tried to kill Moses before he could ever
[37:54] grow up he tried to destroy him but he
[37:56] couldn't do it
[37:57] because Satan cannot stop God's program
[38:00] he cannot stop the coming of the Lord
[38:02] from happening he cannot stop this
[38:05] message from going on oh and they come
[38:07] to find out the more they tried to stop
[38:10] them the stronger they grew am me
[38:12] brother brandom taught us that
[38:13] persecution strengthens the church mean
[38:16] he taught us these things that the fire
[38:18] that was put in amen those disciples
[38:21] from long ago it burned brightly and
[38:23] whenever they would try to blow it out
[38:25] it would just get stronger oh have you
[38:27] ever tried to blow on a
[38:29] fire I didn't think about this till just
[38:32] now but we had a fire break out in our
[38:34] toaster oven this weekend it was a sad
[38:37] thing we did all the wrong things to put
[38:40] it out and one of the things was blow on
[38:41] it and it didn't put it out because the
[38:44] more you try to blow on a fire oxygen
[38:47] feeds fire and the more Satan's Tred to
[38:50] blow on your life and give you Winds of
[38:52] opposition and Winds of persecution amen
[38:55] but you're burning brighter than you
[38:56] ever were before and because it's the
[38:59] Winds of opposition make the flame of
[39:01] God's church that we heard about last
[39:03] Thursday those Flames only get brighter
[39:06] and only grow stronger oh when the Winds
[39:09] of Satan try to blow against it oh he
[39:11] can't stop it he cannot stop this Exodus
[39:14] from coming to pass oh he cannot do
[39:17] anything about what God has promised oh
[39:20] my it's the power of faith is stronger
[39:23] than the power of the
[39:25] devil amen
[39:28] brother Brandon preaches a sermon called
[39:30] preparation and it begins to show that
[39:33] before God ever does anything he makes
[39:36] preparation and there must be a
[39:38] preparation for an exodus amen and he
[39:41] says be God before he does anything he
[39:43] always prepares for it and he said I
[39:44] want to do tonight by God's help if
[39:46] he'll let me is to speak his word to you
[39:49] that'll prepare your heart for the
[39:51] healing service he he said I've tried to
[39:53] speak to them upon your preparation the
[39:56] preparation for healing the preparation
[39:58] for salvation the preparation for
[40:01] victory brother Bram said I believe the
[40:03] people are in the preparation of the
[40:05] last great destruction this world will
[40:07] ever know skipping down he says they are
[40:10] in the spirit of the last days and God
[40:12] cannot just send send destruction upon
[40:16] the people until they are in the spirit
[40:18] for Destruction you see the world we
[40:20] know we're living in the last days
[40:22] brother Brandon Begin to show us very
[40:24] clearly and mean and the people are
[40:26] getting in the spirit of the last days
[40:28] and am mean having a form of godliness
[40:30] and me and trying to hide under a
[40:32] religious cloak and Amen brother said
[40:34] they had to get in the spirit of the an
[40:36] deluvian world before they could be
[40:38] destroyed they have to have this be in
[40:40] the spirit of War before they can have
[40:42] war and he says in questions and answers
[40:45] the world's got to get in the spirit of
[40:47] the last days before the last days can
[40:49] come and we're in the spirit of the last
[40:51] days as the scripture said as it was in
[40:53] the days of Noah and as it was in the
[40:55] days of lot showing that in that time
[40:58] there was a group that would get in the
[40:59] spirit of destruction amen and there was
[41:02] a group that would get in the spirit of
[41:03] those days he said so shall it be at the
[41:06] revealing of the son of man amen and so
[41:08] he makes preparation we see the world
[41:11] getting into preparation we see Israel
[41:13] getting into preparation to receive her
[41:15] Messiah they're getting all the
[41:17] materials together they're they're
[41:19] getting their red heer together they're
[41:20] they're waiting to sacrifice it and
[41:22] they're even saying that maybe they
[41:24] could do it this Passover because
[41:26] they're getting in prepar ation to
[41:28] receive their Messiah and what that
[41:30] means to us is that the bride is getting
[41:32] in preparation to leave the bride is
[41:34] getting in preparation for an exodus
[41:37] anden but God had to send a message to
[41:40] prepare a bride oh there's been three
[41:42] exoduses and he called him from a
[41:44] natural land to a natural land he called
[41:46] him from a spiritual condition to the
[41:48] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[41:50] now he's calling from the spiritual
[41:52] baptism to the Eternal land of the
[41:54] Millennium and he sent his same pillar
[41:57] of fire with each Exodus to lead his
[42:00] people out amen and brother Brandon
[42:02] began to tell us and there in the
[42:04] scripture in that Luke 17 he said
[42:06] remember Lot's wife because Lot's wife
[42:09] looked back and she didn't follow that
[42:11] leadership out of Destruction and and
[42:13] brother brandom said there's a
[42:14] difference between a pillar of fire and
[42:16] a pillar of salt and you must turn one
[42:19] way and me God sent a message to prepare
[42:22] a bride amen but brother Brown tells us
[42:24] that the message would prepare one to
[42:26] stay and one to go and mean he said that
[42:29] he said what does it do it gets the
[42:31] elected ready for the shelter of God
[42:33] like in Noah's time and so forth it
[42:35] condemns the intellectual unbeliever to
[42:37] judgment it always has to spurn Mercy
[42:40] Mercy nothing left but judgment you see
[42:42] it gets the uh it gets the elected ready
[42:45] for the shelter of God while at the same
[42:48] time getting the unbeliever ready for
[42:51] Destruction you see in each Exodus he
[42:53] sent a messenger there in the first
[42:56] Exodus he sent Moses there in the second
[42:58] Exodus he sent John the Baptist to
[43:00] prepare away for the coming Messiah and
[43:03] in this Exodus he said behold I'll send
[43:05] you Elijah before the great and Dreadful
[43:08] day of the Lord amen and what did it do
[43:11] it separated you for the coming of the
[43:14] Lord and mean like it separated the
[43:16] wheat from the tears and mean it
[43:18] separated you Amen to not be a part of
[43:20] the plagues but to come and be a part of
[43:24] the coming of the Lord
[43:27] amen Revelations 18 1-4 if we could just
[43:30] amen just lay this down real quick
[43:31] before we move on it says after these
[43:34] things I saw another Angel come down
[43:36] from heaven having great power and the
[43:38] Earth was lightened with his glory and
[43:41] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[43:43] saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is
[43:45] fallen and has become the habitation of
[43:47] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[43:49] in the cage of every unclean and hateful
[43:51] bird yes it is for all nations have
[43:54] drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[43:56] fornication
[43:58] and the kings of the Earth have
[43:59] committed fornication with her and the
[44:01] merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich
[44:03] through the abundance of her Delicacies
[44:05] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[44:07] saying come out of her my people that
[44:10] you be not partakers of her sins that
[44:13] you receive not of her plagues oh
[44:15] brother brandom said come out that's the
[44:18] message of the hour there in Revelation
[44:20] 17 it revealed who mystery mystery
[44:23] Babylon was and then he said there the
[44:25] very next thing he did and Revelations
[44:27] 18 was called come out of her my people
[44:31] he sent a messenger right after
[44:33] revealing amen what that cage was amen
[44:36] he sent a voice to call a bride out of
[44:39] that cage anden and he ties the voice of
[44:41] Revelations 10:7 to the voice of
[44:43] Revelations 18:4 and saying that this
[44:46] voice amen that the same time that those
[44:48] seals were open this voice was calling
[44:51] come out of her my people come out of
[44:54] the church no come out of confusion come
[44:57] out of your condition come out of
[44:59] whatever system that that you're going
[45:01] through not come out of a uh uh just the
[45:03] the church or come out of the
[45:05] denomination but come out of the
[45:07] confusion and come into an identity that
[45:10] you might know who you are that you
[45:12] might know who your father is that you
[45:14] might know where you came from and where
[45:16] you're going and I believe we are living
[45:18] in the season of coming out he said come
[45:21] out from among them and be ye separate
[45:23] amen and touch not their unclean thing
[45:25] and I will receive you brother brand
[45:27] said am mean if there ever was a coming
[45:29] out time it ought to be right now come
[45:32] out and separate yourself from the
[45:34] things of the world brother Bram said I
[45:36] think it's a time it's just about
[45:38] another coming out party another Boston
[45:41] Tea Party oh my you know there they were
[45:45] back in
[45:46] 1773 and when there was some Sons of
[45:48] Liberty who had come over to a new land
[45:52] amen but that old land was still trying
[45:54] to rule over them amen and tax them and
[45:57] tax their tea and there they were they
[45:59] had this taxation without representation
[46:01] and they weren't fans of it and so they
[46:03] got in the spirit they begin to dress up
[46:06] like Indians and put that paint on and
[46:08] they went out and they threw all that
[46:09] tea off the boat I mean you know what
[46:11] that did those events begin to transpire
[46:14] and Lead away and until even they would
[46:16] sign a declaration of independence and
[46:19] mean because there was a spirit that
[46:20] come over him that we didn't come out of
[46:23] the old land just to live under the rule
[46:25] of the old land in this new land and
[46:28] know I believe there's some Sons of
[46:30] Liberty tonight that say I didn't come
[46:32] out of the denomination to serve a god
[46:35] under bondage but we have come into the
[46:37] message it's the word of the hour and
[46:40] it's the land of our day oh and brother
[46:42] Bram said you cannot bring those
[46:44] denominations over into this land for
[46:47] this is the word oh when the word won't
[46:49] mix with hybrid the word won't mix with
[46:52] denominational chains and oh I say let's
[46:55] come out oh do you ever get under the
[46:57] anointing of this message and you begin
[46:59] to feel the Liberty in the charge of it
[47:01] and you say my what can I come out of
[47:03] today what bondage can I get rid of
[47:05] today what chain of legalism what chain
[47:08] of fanaticism can I throw off today oh
[47:11] it's the spirit of Liberty that comes
[47:14] behind this message that says you didn't
[47:16] come here to stay in bondage we didn't
[47:19] come here and mean to have bondage in
[47:21] our worship in bondage in the preaching
[47:23] of the word in bondage in the way we
[47:25] dress oh it's a bunch of legalism you
[47:28] say well I never spoke in tongues you
[47:30] don't have to I believe it's for you if
[47:32] you want to but it's not the evidence of
[47:34] the Holy Ghost we've been brought out of
[47:36] that land of Pentecostal age of bondage
[47:40] oh we've been brought into a land of
[47:41] liberty letting you know that if your
[47:44] name was written on the Lance Book of
[47:45] Life whether you dance or whether you
[47:47] don't whether you shout or whether you
[47:49] don't whether you speak in tongues or
[47:51] whether you don't you've been liberated
[47:53] by The Calling of this message saying
[47:56] come out of her my people come out of
[47:58] bondage come out of Babylon oh I believe
[48:01] it's a spirit of the message saying come
[48:04] out over my people and get ready for
[48:07] your Exodus oh and if he's bringing you
[48:09] out he's got a better place to take you
[48:12] oh and this message a will give you a
[48:14] liberty like you never knew it'll lift
[48:17] you into Heights that you never thought
[48:18] you could go oh if you'll trust it and
[48:22] if you won't bring the chains from the
[48:23] old land into this message and let it be
[48:26] what it is is oh it'll liberate your
[48:28] life it'll give you freedom to serve God
[48:31] oh you won't have to break out measuring
[48:33] tapes and you won't have to Oh My Oh
[48:36] Glory it's here you won't have to judge
[48:39] everything that comes across this pulpit
[48:41] and when you get into Liberty of this
[48:43] message oh it'll set you free from all
[48:45] of that old land Hallelujah it'll set
[48:48] you free oh well Glory I'm feeling a bit
[48:53] like the son of Liberty oh how are you
[48:56] feel
[48:58] oh let go of those chains of
[49:02] bondage oh and you see what this Third
[49:05] Exodus did is it took the bride out of
[49:07] the church and and when I was looking at
[49:10] that Boston Tea Party it said you know
[49:13] they used to they come to this meeting
[49:14] and they begin to get in the spirit of
[49:16] this and they said well well we used to
[49:18] call ourselves South Carolinians we used
[49:21] to call ourselves Virginians and but
[49:23] there they come and begin to gather
[49:25] together and there for the first time
[49:26] time they begin to call themselves
[49:28] Americans oh and that's so powerful am
[49:31] mean you used to call yourself Methodist
[49:33] you used to call yourself Lutheran you
[49:35] used to call yourself Baptist but when
[49:37] this message sounded you said that's not
[49:40] who I am I'm the bride oh I am not part
[49:43] of those denominations I am the bride
[49:46] I've been called out of the church I've
[49:48] been called out of the systems and I am
[49:50] a Son of God oh it's time for another
[49:53] coming out party you see the world has
[49:56] their coming out parties that's the
[49:58] phrase of the day and me I don't want to
[50:00] be a boy no more I don't want to be a
[50:02] girl no more and they actually have a
[50:04] coming out party but they get their
[50:06] family together and say hey this is who
[50:08] I am now oh but if that's true in the
[50:10] negative what about a bride and that's
[50:13] been called out to your true identity
[50:16] and said come out from among them and
[50:18] you wonder why you always felt different
[50:21] it wasn't because that you were a boy
[50:23] and you thought you were a girl no it
[50:25] was because there was a genan SE on the
[50:27] inside of your life that's why you were
[50:29] different but this message came and gave
[50:31] you a coming out party and you said oh
[50:34] I'm not a Methodist after all I'm not a
[50:37] Baptist after all I'm the bride oh wow
[50:41] it's a coming out party where you throw
[50:43] down your old your old identity and you
[50:45] take on the identity of this message oh
[50:48] throw out the logs come into your true
[50:51] identity come into the message of the
[50:54] Hour come into the identity of the word
[50:56] and and only let it call you what you
[50:58] are and refuse to take the label of the
[51:01] devil any longer come out from among
[51:04] them and be separate yeah amen oh coming
[51:09] to
[51:10] Christ
[51:12] Hallelujah now he said he cried mightily
[51:16] with a strong voice in Revelations 18:2
[51:18] Babylon the great great is Fallen it's
[51:22] fallen and has become the habitation of
[51:24] devils
[51:27] Amen in the hold of every foul spirit in
[51:30] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[51:32] bird now you want to know what a prophet
[51:34] says about it he says she is a cage and
[51:37] has caught hateful unclean birds not
[51:40] Eagles now no no no he says vultures
[51:44] unclean hateful Birds that's what she's
[51:47] caged up around her she's got a cage
[51:49] full of them a whole cage full but
[51:52] there's no Eagles in there why because
[51:53] there was a mighty Angel calling them
[51:55] out saying you don't belong in there
[51:58] that cage is not for you that's right oh
[52:01] and he began to call him out because you
[52:02] see we're living in an eagle age and me
[52:05] it's more than just an animal it's it's
[52:07] it's the age of the hour and and brother
[52:10] brother Ray so beautifully brought that
[52:11] out Sunday how there's four anointings
[52:14] there's a an ox a man a lion and an
[52:17] eagle and me and those four beasts that
[52:20] were sent forth were sent forth to
[52:21] combat the four horse riders and he sent
[52:24] the the lion to combat that Roman age
[52:27] and then he sent the ox to combat that
[52:29] martyr age and then he sent the man to
[52:31] combat that intellectual age those
[52:33] reformers but he said in the evening
[52:35] time it was prophesied in Revelations
[52:38] 10:7 and Malachi 4 that there would come
[52:40] an eagle age and that's the ones who
[52:43] would receive the opening of the word
[52:45] they were the ones that God would send a
[52:46] prophet and a prophet's likened onto an
[52:49] eagle and that Prophet would sound forth
[52:51] amen and it would be the very power that
[52:53] would combat that fourth horse rider
[52:56] that an Christ anointing and mean that
[52:58] that eagle anointing would stand up
[53:00] against it and mean and call a bride out
[53:01] of those systems and let her know who
[53:04] she is and where she belongs and so if
[53:06] you want to get in the spirit of the age
[53:09] I mean you're not going to get under an
[53:10] ox anointing as brother Ray said you're
[53:13] not going to get under a man anointing
[53:15] but you're going to get under an eagle
[53:17] anointing you see to be in the spirit of
[53:19] the age is not to be amen formal and
[53:21] lukewarm and Powerless that is not the
[53:24] age of your soul that is not the age
[53:27] that you belong in that's a layer to
[53:29] seeing age and but that's not the spirit
[53:31] of the age that you want to get into you
[53:33] want to get in the spirit of the eagle
[53:35] age and come up higher and come up and
[53:37] be a part amen of what you've been
[53:40] called to be in this hour it's an eagle
[53:42] age it's an eagle anointing and it's an
[53:45] eagle calling am mean an eagle calling
[53:48] calls Eagles I think that's one of the
[53:51] greatest amen Exodus examples I can
[53:53] think of Amen brother Tom is that eag
[53:56] that was in a chicken yard one
[53:58] day and there he was born in the chicken
[54:01] yard amen and there he was he he always
[54:04] felt a little different he always felt
[54:06] like he didn't belong with them Eagles
[54:08] he always felt a little different and it
[54:10] was uh hatched in there because the
[54:12] farmer needed another egg to complete
[54:14] the setting and I believe brother
[54:16] brandom said a setting of eggs is 15 I'm
[54:19] not I don't know myself but he they they
[54:21] were one short is the main point and
[54:24] they needed another egg and so they put
[54:26] an eagle under there amen that it might
[54:29] fill that spot and there he began to
[54:31] hatch forth and go through the motions
[54:33] of Life am me but never really felt like
[54:36] he belonged and one day there come forth
[54:39] a a
[54:40] sound that he recognized and it was
[54:43] Mother eagle flying over beginning to
[54:46] call him out and mean and he understood
[54:49] that language when she cried out Jesus
[54:51] Christ the same yesterday today and
[54:53] forever when she began to cry out the
[54:56] end time word she understood that
[54:58] because it was Eagle to Eagle and and it
[55:01] actually began to make sense to her and
[55:03] that's why I believe that these terms
[55:05] even am me the wonderful things our
[55:07] pastor's preaching on on the third pole
[55:09] and the seventh seal I don't believe
[55:11] those are just buzzword to get us
[55:13] excited I believe that's our language
[55:15] that's been released in this age that
[55:17] could never be released before but it's
[55:19] been release to you and that's why it
[55:22] makes you rejoice and that's why and
[55:24] mean it stimulates your soul is because
[55:27] it's the language and that you
[55:29] understand as Eagles oh and that eagle
[55:31] began to scream and there he made his
[55:34] first jump and he jumped up onto that
[55:36] Barn post amen and brother Carrie it
[55:39] wasn't high enough but you know what I
[55:41] I'd say it might have been higher than
[55:43] he ever was before it wasn't high enough
[55:46] but you know what he probably never knew
[55:48] he could get on that post before and
[55:50] mean there he spent his whole life and
[55:52] finally he's like hey and mean something
[55:55] screaming and and I'm on this post and
[55:57] I've never been up here and mean because
[55:59] this message will call you up higher and
[56:01] me this message and mean sometimes you
[56:03] feel like it's preaching above you but
[56:06] it's not to put you down it's to call
[56:08] you up and mean it's calling you up
[56:10] because mother Eagle's up there letting
[56:13] you know that this is where you need to
[56:15] come and the message will call you
[56:17] higher and you say well how am I
[56:18] supposed to get there and mean you just
[56:20] start with a flap of your wings you see
[56:23] that's how that eagle got to that post
[56:24] just a flap of its wings and you know
[56:26] the same flap of his wings that would
[56:29] put him on a barnyard post could put him
[56:31] in the sky oh you know how the children
[56:33] of Israel got out of Egypt it started
[56:35] with a step and mean and you're
[56:37] wondering how you're going to make a
[56:39] Rapture how did you get this far and
[56:41] mean have you ever taken a step well
[56:43] then just take another one and just take
[56:45] another one and one of these days that
[56:47] step will put you from justification to
[56:49] sanctification it'll put you in the Holy
[56:52] Ghost it'll put you in adoption it'll
[56:54] put you in the change of your body oh
[56:56] because the message is calling you
[56:58] higher wave after wave after wave oh and
[57:02] that eagle you know what he did and mean
[57:04] he realized and mean that that fence
[57:06] couldn't hold him any
[57:08] longer oh my brother brandom
[57:11] said you can't organize Pentecost you
[57:14] can't denominate Pentecost is an
[57:16] experience not an organization it's for
[57:19] you Methodist you Baptist you
[57:20] Presbyterians he said they try to draw
[57:23] fences around it but it's not so Eagles
[57:26] will fly right over it don't pay no
[57:28] attention to it oh my you know what that
[57:30] tells me and mean brother Brandon would
[57:32] teach us that this message can't be
[57:34] denominated and now I understand why
[57:37] because this is an eagle message and
[57:38] eagles fly over fences oh and they try
[57:41] to fence up this message and say that
[57:43] the power of God don't move no more and
[57:45] say that the days and miracles are pass
[57:48] oh but this is an eagle message and it
[57:50] says I am not bound by man-made fences
[57:53] and chicken theology oh but that eagle
[57:56] flies out and breaks forth and the sick
[57:59] are healed anyway and the bound are
[58:01] delivered anyway and they're still
[58:03] filled with the Holy Ghost anyway I mean
[58:05] because Pentecost isn't a denomination
[58:08] it's an experience I me you can't fence
[58:11] it in it's still being poured out I
[58:13] believe it's being poured out this
[58:15] weekend and me and Satan cannot fence up
[58:17] Eagles oh my and and you're an eagle and
[58:22] he's tried to fence you up and try to
[58:24] confine you to a little area and hold
[58:26] you there and pin you down and saying
[58:28] you're never going to come out of that
[58:29] fence you're never going to come out of
[58:31] that depression you're never going to
[58:33] come out of that anxiety but when mother
[58:35] Eagle screams it lets you know who you
[58:37] are and it lets you know that fences are
[58:40] not the hindrance in your life any
[58:42] longer oh that old I can't attitude that
[58:45] mother chicken tat you I mean that might
[58:47] belong in the chicken dictionary but it
[58:49] doesn't belong in an eagle dictionary so
[58:51] throw it out and me the fences amen the
[58:54] sky is the limit oh there's no limit to
[58:57] what God can do for you his Eagles
[59:00] tonight he's preparing a people oh to
[59:03] believe all things oh and when mother
[59:05] Eagle begin to call it lets you know
[59:09] that you don't belong in the chicken
[59:11] yard oh you're there but you don't
[59:14] belong there right oh I'm here but I
[59:18] don't belong here oh you know what Moses
[59:22] was raised up in Pharaoh's Palace amen
[59:25] but there're come a day when God called
[59:27] him out of that Palace and he was raised
[59:30] up there but he didn't belong there oh
[59:33] glory and you might have been raised up
[59:36] under an organization and you might have
[59:38] been raised up under depression and me
[59:41] because God may have been teaching you
[59:42] something whether they come and calling
[59:44] out day in your life where he said
[59:46] you've been there long enough you've
[59:47] learned all you need to know and I'm
[59:49] ready to adopt you and place you as my
[59:51] children that you might soar in the
[59:53] heavenlies and you begin to recognize
[59:55] that what you were raised up under
[59:57] wasn't where you belonged oh my I so
[1:00:01] love it because Exodus 1:1 before we
[1:00:04] break into this book of Exodus the very
[1:00:06] first verse says amen that the children
[1:00:09] of Israel came into Egypt oh why doesn't
[1:00:12] it call them the children of Egypt
[1:00:14] because what they were going through was
[1:00:16] not who they were and mean and what you
[1:00:18] are going through tonight does not
[1:00:20] define who you are but you are not the
[1:00:23] children of Egypt you are the children
[1:00:25] of Israel
[1:00:26] you are the children of the promise and
[1:00:28] the trials that you're going through now
[1:00:30] do not define who you are oh you may
[1:00:33] feel like you're Earthbound some days
[1:00:35] but the word says who you are and it
[1:00:37] says you are a heavenbound bird and you
[1:00:40] belong in the heights of the heavenlies
[1:00:42] oh and you may feel like you're going
[1:00:43] through a trial tonight brother Samuel
[1:00:45] but I'll tell you this and me Eagles are
[1:00:47] born high above the ground and tree nest
[1:00:51] and and they belong in the sky so if
[1:00:54] they find themselves on the ground am
[1:00:56] mean maybe a bad day and mean they may
[1:00:58] find themselves there but that's the
[1:01:00] lowest place they're ever going to go oh
[1:01:03] glory and you may be having a bad day or
[1:01:06] a bad week but that's all it is it's a
[1:01:08] bad day it's a bad week but it's the
[1:01:10] lowest you're ever going to go because
[1:01:12] you came from God and you're going back
[1:01:15] to God and the lowest Satan can bring
[1:01:17] you it's a little trial or a little
[1:01:19] trouble or a bad day but when the mother
[1:01:22] Eagle calls you oh it lets you know I
[1:01:24] might be having a bad day but this is
[1:01:26] the only lowest place I can go I can't
[1:01:29] go to hell I can't go in the tribulation
[1:01:31] the farthest I can go is a bad day a
[1:01:34] little trial a little heartache but I
[1:01:36] know in just another day I'll be back up
[1:01:39] in the heavenlies I'll be going back
[1:01:41] where I belong oh you don't belong in
[1:01:43] the chicken yard you are not defined by
[1:01:46] your conditions you are defined by the
[1:01:49] seed oh doesn't Genesis say every seed
[1:01:52] would bring forth after its kind and if
[1:01:55] you are an eagle you'll bring forth
[1:01:56] after your kind and you say well my
[1:01:59] maybe I'm just going to wreck up one of
[1:02:00] these days maybe I'm just going to come
[1:02:02] to my end maybe I'm really hypocrite
[1:02:04] maybe I'm really just a Judas oh but you
[1:02:06] can look the devil in the eye and say
[1:02:08] according to the identification of the
[1:02:10] word it wasn't so from the beginning I
[1:02:13] never was a Judas I never was a
[1:02:15] hypocrite I always was an eagle I always
[1:02:18] was a Son of God oh because the word
[1:02:21] defines you the word lets you know who
[1:02:24] you are and if you ever find type
[1:02:26] brother Joel in the word then you know
[1:02:28] you can't beat your type and mean and if
[1:02:30] your type is Judas you can't beat it but
[1:02:32] if your type is Abraham if your type is
[1:02:34] Moses oh you can't beat your
[1:02:37] type oh brother brandom said your
[1:02:40] anointing tells on you whatever your
[1:02:42] spirit is moves you you're motivated by
[1:02:45] a spirit oh my your anointing tells on
[1:02:48] you have you ever done something brother
[1:02:50] Zachary and you try to tell Mama that
[1:02:53] well it really happened this way and
[1:02:54] then your sibling comes up and says says
[1:02:56] no no no I seen it this is what happened
[1:02:59] and they tell on you amen and that's how
[1:03:01] your anointing is amen out of your mouth
[1:03:04] you begin confessing well I I I'm not a
[1:03:07] Christian I'm not a son of God I mean
[1:03:09] this message isn't for me the Rapture
[1:03:11] isn't for me amen but then all of a
[1:03:13] sudden you come into the house of God
[1:03:16] and the anointing begins to move and all
[1:03:18] of a sudden you come into the house of
[1:03:20] God with a head hang down ready to give
[1:03:22] up but your anointing begins to tell on
[1:03:25] you and anointing begins to say I've
[1:03:27] just gotten started I don't going to
[1:03:29] give up I'm not going to back down I'm
[1:03:32] not going to let the devil have my
[1:03:33] victory oh your anointing begins to tell
[1:03:36] on you and say no you're a Son of God
[1:03:39] you're a daughter of God and this is
[1:03:41] your Exodus oh this is not fanaticism
[1:03:44] this is your Exodus this is Christ oh
[1:03:47] he's your Exodus he's your Exodus from
[1:03:50] amen sickness to health it's Christ I
[1:03:52] mean you don't belong there oh you know
[1:03:54] in this age it's the age of pronouns he
[1:03:57] she him her were amen but they can put
[1:04:00] any pronoun in front of them amen but
[1:04:02] that doesn't necessarily Define who they
[1:04:04] are oh but the word it lies not and when
[1:04:08] the word defines you that's who you are
[1:04:10] and if the word says you're loosed
[1:04:12] you're loosed and if the word says
[1:04:14] you're Justified you're Justified and if
[1:04:16] the word says you're free you're free if
[1:04:19] the word says you're healed you're
[1:04:20] healed if the word says you're delivered
[1:04:23] you're delivered oh you're mistake don't
[1:04:26] Define you your failures don't Define
[1:04:28] you you see Abraham he lied but when
[1:04:32] Paul wrote an account of his life he
[1:04:33] said he was strong in faith and stagger
[1:04:36] not at the promise of God you see what
[1:04:38] defined Abraham in his end account it
[1:04:40] wasn't his mistakes oh it was that he
[1:04:43] was a hero of the faith oh and you are
[1:04:46] not defined by your conditions or what
[1:04:49] the devil says about
[1:04:51] you oh brother Brandon said science
[1:04:53] tries to say that a bumblebee is too
[1:04:55] heav to fly amen but the Bumblebee must
[1:04:57] not have heard what science was saying
[1:04:59] cuz it got up and flew anyhow amen and
[1:05:02] that's what you do am me the devil tries
[1:05:04] to tell you that what you're limited to
[1:05:06] and what you're defined to and mean but
[1:05:08] you just cut out the voice of that
[1:05:10] science devil and you just fly away
[1:05:12] anyhow because it's in your species it's
[1:05:15] in your seed to do it oh fly out of
[1:05:18] there despite what the science says
[1:05:21] despite it you know despite means
[1:05:23] without being affected by or without
[1:05:26] taking any notice or being influenced by
[1:05:29] not prevented by amen and you know
[1:05:31] tonight amen whether a service goes good
[1:05:34] or whether a service goes bad I'm a
[1:05:37] preacher despite that because God's
[1:05:39] called me to it and and our brother
[1:05:42] Wayne is a pastor despite whether it's
[1:05:44] hard or whether it's easy because God's
[1:05:47] put him in that position and me and you
[1:05:49] are a Christian and mean despite the
[1:05:51] good days or despite the bad days
[1:05:53] because despite what it says doesn't
[1:05:56] change who you are Amen in this church
[1:05:59] oh it's been through troubles it's been
[1:06:00] through trials it's been through
[1:06:02] heartaches but you're still here that's
[1:06:04] right despite what the devil's tried to
[1:06:06] do for you oh because that is not the
[1:06:09] definition of your life you belong you
[1:06:11] belong in the skies and me and there's a
[1:06:14] call saying come back to where you
[1:06:16] belong you belong in my kingdom and
[1:06:19] you're not here by accident but God's
[1:06:21] called you to this position God knows
[1:06:24] brother Bram said God knows just exactly
[1:06:26] where you
[1:06:27] belong in what age you belong in you see
[1:06:32] he didn't put you in this age by chance
[1:06:35] but it pleased him to choose you and he
[1:06:37] chose you for this age because he knew
[1:06:40] am mean that you belonged here under
[1:06:42] this flying eagle anointing and
[1:06:44] sometimes you think
[1:06:45] my I'm just an impostor I I don't really
[1:06:48] fit in everyone else is true but I'm
[1:06:51] just a
[1:06:52] fake but it pleased him to choose you
[1:06:55] and chose you for this position because
[1:06:57] you belonged here and mean sometimes
[1:06:59] you're almost scared to enjoy your
[1:07:02] Liberty because you think maybe I'm
[1:07:04] going to have a flop and end up back
[1:07:06] down in that chicken yard oh but don't
[1:07:09] let fear keep you out of where you
[1:07:11] belong don't let that doubt keep you out
[1:07:14] of where you belong amen he's calling
[1:07:16] you Amen to act like the eagle you are
[1:07:20] saying it's time church it's time my
[1:07:23] bride I've called you out this is who
[1:07:25] you you are and it's time to start
[1:07:27] acting like who you are it's time to
[1:07:29] start worshiping Like an Eagle it's time
[1:07:31] to start amen praising Like an Eagle
[1:07:33] it's time to start walking like an eagle
[1:07:35] and talking like an eagle and mean
[1:07:38] because that's who you are that's where
[1:07:40] you belong amen get some ambition about
[1:07:43] you amen as we begin to close the
[1:07:45] musicians amen could come you're built
[1:07:48] upon High Ambitions because you belong
[1:07:52] in the sky an eagle is a special built
[1:07:55] bird word that's right yeah in the
[1:07:58] deep as it calls to the deep in your
[1:08:00] life you know there's a deep to
[1:08:04] respond when the children of Israel were
[1:08:06] coming out of
[1:08:07] Egypt amen Joshua had to remind them
[1:08:10] when they passed by Esau's Mountain that
[1:08:12] that wasn't their
[1:08:14] inheritance and because they have tasted
[1:08:16] of blood and mean they they wanted to go
[1:08:19] fight but he had to say no that's not
[1:08:21] your inheritance and but brother Brandon
[1:08:23] my believe says because they tasted of
[1:08:25] denominations they wanted to go there
[1:08:27] but he's letting you know no that's not
[1:08:29] where you
[1:08:30] belong Jacob's mountains on the other
[1:08:32] side of the Jord and church that's where
[1:08:34] you belong and it begins to say that we
[1:08:37] can't make them all see it we can't make
[1:08:39] all the Lutheran see it we can't make
[1:08:41] all the methodists see it but he said to
[1:08:43] you who believe to you who know to you
[1:08:46] that's got something in you that's
[1:08:48] calling to the Deep if all the Deep
[1:08:50] you've got has been satisfied he says
[1:08:52] then stay where you are but for me in my
[1:08:54] house there's something more that we've
[1:08:56] seen there's a land beyond the river
[1:08:59] somewhere there's still a deep calling
[1:09:01] to the Deep he says I cannot be
[1:09:03] satisfied with theology I cannot be
[1:09:06] satisfied with a good church I cannot be
[1:09:08] satisfied with a good campaign I cannot
[1:09:10] be satisfied with a little healing
[1:09:12] service there's something beyond that
[1:09:14] that's
[1:09:16] calling oh friends if you feel it
[1:09:19] calling to you
[1:09:20] tonight anden then it's time to get into
[1:09:23] the vision of the message amen oh it's
[1:09:27] time to rise above it all it's time to

[1:09:36] message oh it'll be a wind that'll take
[1:09:39] you from Glory onto glory and this Eagle

[1:10:41] entering the raptured age you know the
[1:10:44] church can't go in its condition it
[1:10:45] can't get any better it must get worse
