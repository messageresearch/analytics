========================================

amen we invite our brother if he would come tonight brother Ben I need [Music] the I need [Music] thee we I oh Lord we need you we need you in our bless me now my [Music] S I come [Music] to the oh why don't you make it your prayer tonight I need oh [Music] I hour I [Music] [Applause] need oh blesses me now [Music] my amen he's all we need in life's journey he's everything we have need of even for the Rapture brother Bram said but he gave us his holy SP spirit and supplied all of our need and he's all of our need tonight I don't think there's anything that you could have a desire for tonight that he didn't already make a way to supply that desire in your heart it's a humbling thing to stand up here seeing the expectation quotes even being posted today and about expecting you know the Lord to move in this weekend and you realize that what the people are expecting out of this weekend is isn't natural It's Supernatural and as a man you realize you're only natural and so you can't provide what they're expecting but there is a supernatural God Amen that can come down in the building tonight and meet the expectation of your heart and that's what we're asking for and maybe just if you have a need on your heart we'll just go in prayer first of all and just talk to the Lord and invite him into this meeting Heavenly Father we come before you you Lord Jesus we feel your presence so powerfully already Lord in this building Lord as the songs have been sung Lord and the atmosphere has been set father and Lord you're the one that we have need of tonight Lord You're the almighty God Lord You're the way maker father out of every situation Lord we call you on the scene tonight father from the oldest to the youngest father Lord from the sick to the uh bound Lord to those needing the Holy Ghost tonight father would you just move in on the scene and begin to speak to the hearts and the lives Lord you said that your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and father we just yield ourselves to you as a vessel Lord close our lips from saying anything you'd have us to be silent on and open them to speak what your children have need of father and we'll be sure to give you the glory and the honor and praise in Jesus name amen and amen if you have your Bibles thank you musicians for the music and you could turn with me to the Book of Exodus amen I'm just excited to be in the house of the Lord this weekend looking forward to what the Lord has in store for us in this meeting and just praying that we could say something tonight just to lay a foundation for the rest of the weekend and I just uh can't say how thankful I am to be able to share meeting with these brothers two of my heroes that the Lord has used so mightily in my life not just behind the pulpit but uh just in the daily life the Lord has used them so much for me so to be able to stand here with them it just means the world to me amen Exodus 1 verse one and we'll read down uh maybe to about the 12th verse just been doing a little study and Exodus the last little while and just just want to share what's on our heart it says these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt every man in his household came with Jacob Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah issachar Zebulon and Benjamin Dan and naali Gad and a Asher and all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were 70 souls for Joseph was in Egypt already and Joseph died and all his Brethren and all that generation and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding Mighty and the land was filled with them now there arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we and come on and let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when they fall out any War they join also under enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them task Masters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities pitham and ramsy but the more they Afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and just a couple verses in 2 Kings 3 very familiar it says in verse 15 now bring me a Minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the Lord came upon him speaking of Elijah or Elisha forgive me and it said he said thus sayith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus sayith the Lord You shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your Beast amen you may have your seats this evening anden we just want to take a thought out of there if we could on getting in the spirit of Exodus getting in the spirit of Exodus and uh I just want to say greetings to my family as well good to have them my aunt and Grandma there we're just thankful that they could be here sure love them amen if we could just begin to break into this thought on Exodus and speak of getting in the spirit of Exodus brother Brandon would uh begin to teach us on the importance of getting in the spirit and he' say you know that you can't do anything good until first you get in the spirit and if you uh if you fail to get in the spirit then all of your efforts will be in vain and I think that that applies to this meeting this weekend amen I I if as a minister you know very well that when you're trying to study for a sermon it's important to get in the spirit and when that spirit's not there you just sometimes feel like you're hitting against a wall and you you don't know which way to go but when that anointing begins to settle down and the Lord begins to lead you through those channels and you realize that without the spirit all your efforts would be in vain amen but it takes the singers to get in the spirit it takes them musicians to get in the spirit and as the Bible says and brother Ry spoke on this some Sunday if you were here Sunday what a powerful sermon that was amen but the Bible says about John I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and brother brand said I think we could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life he said if I'm going to sing I'll sing in the spirit if I'm going to pray I'll pray in the spirit and so that's what we want to do is get in the spirit and brother brandham said that the spirit was not John's spirit because getting in his own Spirit would not cause him to see those Visions but he got in the spirit of God am me and it it is possible to get in the wrong Spirit you see out in the world how they they have their dances and they have their music and they they get in the spirit of it but it's it's the spirit of the devil it's it's not the spirit of God and they get in the spirit of their baseball games and and they'll shout and they'll rejoice and then they'll look at a holy ghost meeting like this and say such fanaticism me but it's just because they didn't get in the spirit of the meeting amen but but they would call it holy rollers and of course brother Brandon would tell us well if this is Holy Rollers then that must be on holy rollers and me because they're still getting in the spirit of something they're just not getting in the spirit of the word of God and brother brandom says you know how you notice how they get into the spirit of things in the world and he said but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's no nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval he said but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship amen you can expect the world to Amen to to call it fanaticism you can expect the world to criticize this message so you just go ahead and get in the spirit of worship anyhow Amen in a in a meeting like this I believe that we can just go ahead and have a meeting amen I believe we can just go ahead and lay aside the cares of the weak and the cares of the world Amen and just begin to get in the spirit of the meeting that the Lord might come down amongst us and begin to minister to the desires and the needs of his people and me because brother Brandon said that there will never be Revival until you get into the spirit of Revival he said the preacher can preach even amen but the preacher doesn't carry the Revival am mean because a Revival amen maybe the Lord be wanting to send a Revival but it'll take the people to get in the spirit of Revival to receive what the Lord is wanting to say send amen you've got to get in the spirit of receiving because the Lord I mean he's already promised it in his word and so he's already willing to send it but somebody's got to get in the spirit to receive what the Lord is wanting to send Amen brother Brandon preached out of that message getting in the spirit on that scripture making the valley full of ditches and he said that the minstral begin to play and and as the minstral played a mean in one place he says maybe he was playing only believe or in another place he said maybe they were clapping their hands but whatever it was it put Elisha in the spirit that the presence of the Lord may come upon him and and begin to deal with him by way of vision Amen brother brandom said he saw Vision because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and that was God's program to deal with a prophet was through vision amen but what was the vision brother brandom said he wasn't telling them to go amen build schools or GO train in theology or to get on a different uniform but he said the message was to get to digging amen and you'll find the water that you're searching for am mean amen and brother say that amen any true Prophet today still has the same message it's not amen go uh uh call down rain from some foreign denomination or from some School of Theology said the water is already there because the rock that was in the wilderness that the children of Israel got water from those pools of water were still laying in that desert land and if they would just get to digging the logs out they could have access access to the same spirit in the same Revival that Moses had access to amen and that children of God had access to throughout all the ages and I I believe that applies tonight that the same Holy Ghost amen that your parents received and your grandparents is still available in the house of God tonight if you'll just get to digging am mean all the logs of it's not for me amen and it just can't happen tonight or I'm going to wait for another weekend or another service what you do is you get your shovel and begin to dig in those logs out and invite the presence of God to come on the scene in your life and give you the desire of your heart and he said those logs of maybe you you've got something against your brother or you've held something in your heart well now now would be the time to let that go amen don't wait till the end of the service now would be the time to just throw out that little Grudge that little funny feeling oh just throw it out oh get to digging and you'll find that the water's there oh but like how brother brandom said it he said as long as you say well bless God I'm Methodist I don't have to put up with such I'm Baptist assemblies I'm W this all right go ahead you'll never see the vision he said but you throw that thing aside and get into the vision see Jesus coming and the church perishing here and get into the vision dig right down brother I'm telling you something will happen to you then you'll get in the spirit of Revival I like how he says there get in the vision because you see you may not be a prophet brother Taz you may not be be able to see a vision the way brother brandham did but you can get into a vision amen God the word of the Lord God sends his word to the prophets and he uses them to see the vision for the age to see the vision for the hour We're living but somebody must get into the vision of the message of the hour and inhabit that Vision over their lives for brother the Bible says without Vision the people perish am mean and you see how he would tell people that would come up in the prayer line and begin to instruct them that amen that if you'll just notice there's a well body standing right out in front of you and Jesus Christ is calling you to that well body and just start walking towards that well body and mean he was giving them a vision amen of a well body that they wouldn't have to remain in their sickness but they would have to get into that Vision to begin to walk into that well body and walk out of the sickness that they were in oh it's important to get into the vision amen dig out and get into the vision ien we look at the definition of getting in the spirit it's to become enthusiastic or excited about something fully embracing the atmosphere mood of an in event or activity and and if you uh just switch it to the phrase get in the spirit I like how it says it fully embrace the enthusiasm and positive attitude surrounding a particular event or occasion Often by actively participating in activities related to it and I like this and adopting its theme amen because if you're going to get in the spirit amen of this Springtime amen you're going to put away your winter decorations and begin to set out the flowers and set out the spring decorations and if you're going to get in the spirit of of the football season you're going to say well I'm an Ohio State fan or I'm this fan and and I got this jersey and you begin to adopt the theme of what you get into the spirit of and mean and as a Christian Satan would try to get you to adopt the wrong theme over your life and mean then you begin to adopt the theme that I'm depressed or I'm anxious or I'm never going to make it and you begin to let that become the vision and you begin to adopt it until that's the only thing you see and that's the only thing you talk about is just wowy wowy woo am mean look at me and look at my problems amen but may if you take the word of God that we've been given it's a Clear Vision over your life and you begin to adopt the theme of the word and place of the devil's theme and you say by his stripes I am healed and if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover go into all the world and preach the gospel I'm a Son of God I'm free I'm delivered I'm going to make it I'm going in a Rapture my children are going with me amen and you begin to adopt the theme of the vision of the word over your life and before you know it you won't be in the same condition but you'll be walking in a well body you'll be walking in a body change you'll be walking amen with your children because amen the word works and it should be the theme of Our Lives amen it's getting in the spirit of it getting in the spirit of your healing getting in the spirit of your deliverance amen and getting in the spirit of Exodus if we could say it that way because Exodus means to come out yeah amen and uh the the As We Lay the foundation for the the background to the promise of an exodus amen the word the Lord promised Abraham in Genesis 15 that uh Noah assurity that thy seed shall be a Stranger in a Strange Land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years but afterward they shall come out with great substance you see the iniquity of the amorites was not yet fulfilled so they couldn't possess the land at that time but they were given a promise that this land belonged to them and after 400 years they would be able to leave their condition and possess the land that was promised them and but brother Brandon tells us that sometimes the cogs of God's will turn slow but they turn sure he said God makes everything work together right just like cogs amen just like cogs and he says we see it off sometimes in a distance and wonder could it ever be but it always happens just the way God said it would be amen so we we want to put that in our remembrance first of all is that I mean The Exodus is right on time I mean and sometimes you go through seasons of your life and sometimes you go through seasons of waiting and sometimes you go through seasons of Deliverance amen but just remember that the cogs of God's prophecy May sometimes turn slow but they always turn sure Amen in your time and sight elements amen begin to wonder and worry how is this going to happen amen but time and sigh are two of the worst enemies God has because they don't declare anything about God am me but what the word says is true am mean we spoke on it before but we'll bring it to your memory that in literature there's a phrase called the day Numan and that's the closing scenes in literature where all the loose ends of the plot begin to come together and mean and the things that you wonder about am mean that's when they begin to tie together those loose SS begin to come together in the end of the book amen but you're looking at it if you're just looking at where you're at right now you're wondering how's it all going to come together amen it looks like the hour's so late how how's this prodigal going to come home how's this going to happen how's this going to happen amen but it's the cogs of God's will are turning sure although maybe it may seem slow to you but it's right on time and just in the right season Deliverance will come and God will tie those loosens together and make it work out for the good oh my I I thank God for it because sometimes we've been in those situations I think even of uh Bethany there she was uh it was the first service I preached here in New Year's and she was we were well if you know our story we had some breakups and we had probably about four or five of them but and if you ask me maybe who's fault it was or who whose fault it was you might get a different story but probably my fault but there she was she she she was in a spot where she was about tired of it and she was ready to move down to Arkansas and just go back and give it all up and am mean it kind of in a tough place there amen but but but there in that new year service amen the power of God if you remember it began to fall down at the end and brother Ray got up behind all all the ministers and began to pray and the anointing fell in that building and right back there where she was the power of God fell on her life and gave her such a a rebaptism and and just a few weeks later she started dating a preacher and then ended up marrying a preacher and now we got a son amen but but what it was you know if you're looking at it in the natural eye here it looks bad it looks like you know she was ready to move and give it all up but there in a moment am mean it can begin to change and turn around and all of a sudden you're realizing that those loose ends aren't so loose after all amen but God was always in control he's a mighty God Amen but if you look at this amen here they were in Egypt and the arrangement for them to be in Egypt was brother BR said they were located in Egypt because of the drought and here conditions that were hard had driven them amen to this Egypt condition but I I think about there was Jacob and there was Joseph there in that land and there they were in the mid M of Egypt but brother Carrie they never forgot the promise of an exodus because while they were there in Egypt am me Jacob said you better not bury my bones down here in Egypt because I know a promise and one day we're going to come out of here and Joseph did the same thing he said you can put me in a casket but don't you leave me here because one of these days am mean we're going to come out of this land they always had that promise in their mind because job had prophesied that yet in his flesh he would see God and Jacob and Joseph by spiritual Revelation knew that the Exodus and the resurrection wouldn't take place in Egypt but it would take place in the promised land and Abraham and Sarah and Isaac were buried there with Jacob brother brandom said if you notice and Jacob and Joseph said that's where we're going to be buried because that's where the resurrection is going to take place oh and brother brandom said I caught the spiritual revelation of the coming of the Lord and that's why I left the Baptist Church because I knew that the res would Resurrection wouldn't take place in the Baptist Church or the Methodist Church or the Lutheran church but it would take place in Christ so he gave up the denomination and got birth into a spirit that would take him in a resurrection oh that if you want to get in the spirit of Exodus you're going to have to get the Holy Ghost because it said by one Spirit we're baptized into one body and the same spirit that raised Jesus from the grave if it dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal body oh that's how you get in the spirit of Exodus you remember that we're not here to stay and we're going to begin to get in the spirit that's going to take us out of here oh I think it's important to remember that we are not here to stay in this world am mean when you go on a trip brother Nick amen you you you maybe just gone for a couple days and so you pack a suitcase and and instead of uh uh making yourself at home you just live out of that suitcase for a couple days because you say I'm here but I'm not here to stay and you don't settle in because that's not your Dwelling Place and I think that's how it is in this world we should remember that we're here but we're not here to stay amen uh here we have no continuing City brother Brandon would say he said you know that old house brother Zachary that he thought would stand for hundred of years they begin to put a Housing Development there and tore it down he said what happened to to this one and that one they've gone on what happened to Dad what happened to Charles he said they've gone on and he said but here we have no continuing City and we brought nothing into this world and it's certain will take nothing out amen so why should we get so worried amen about how we're going to pay the bills and and maybe you lost your job and maybe you're worried about how this is going to happen and that's going to happen but all the while am mean you should remember that this is not your Dwelling Place you're just here amen for a season but we're going out of here one of these days anden you are not of this world Amen but you are of another world you are the children amen of an Unseen World and this is only a temporary dwelling but one of these mornings anden a sweep's going to come through here and take you home to where you belong oh it's a temporary dwelling place oh and I think if the Lord has gone to prepare a place for us brother Nathaniel and he would write that I has not seen or Ear Has Not Heard amen what weights in store amen for us that love him amen then I think it's important to remember brother Elijah that if the Lord is calling us out of something amen then he has something better in store amen the Lord is calling you out of a condition if the Lord's calling you into higher Heights and mean and you think well I'm comfortable here I I've got used to where I'm at I don't know if I want to move but just remember if the Lord is calling you out of something he's got something better for you amen he's got a greater Heights for you oh he's got healing for you I think it's important to remember Amen in the spiritual that when you're in a trial and you're in a sickness that you can look the devil in the eye and say devil I'm here but I'm not here to stay Amen brother Bram said that's what he's spreading this morning to you sick people you sick people that seems like you're going to sit there all your life if the devil can get you to believe that he's got you oh my that's where the rubber meets the road friends you've been sick for a long time and the devil's trying to get you to believe that you're going to remain there forever but that's when he gets you amen but brother BR tells a testimony about a sister said she had bad ankles and high blood pressure and many things wrong with her amen but brother BR said Satan would give her a stroke if he could he'd lay her up yonder on the bed of Affliction he'll put her out of her commission if he can for he don't want her testimony oh my tonight Satan don't want your testimony and me and that's why he's putting afflictions upon you and that's why he's putting troubles upon you because he doesn't want your testimony and Satan's try to convince you that it's because God doesn't love you or because you obeyed and you're reaping what you sold and you're out of the will of God but that's a lie from the pits of Hell amen it is God's will to heal tonight just the same as it was yesterday and the day before and it's not his will for you to suffer if it was his will for you to suffer then he defeated his own will when he came on the earth and begin to heal the sick and deliver the bound but it's a lie from the devil trying to keep you in your condition because he don't want your testimony oh but brother brandom told that girl he said it's like that blind boy that they asked why are you blind because your mother sinned or your father sinned he said no neither but that the glory of God might be made manifest and that's the Satan's Tred to put Affliction upon you but it's not because you were disobedient amen am me he's many times he'll try to lie to you and think that it's because of this or it's because of that and believe that it's God's will for you to stay there but I'd say probably a good 90 95% of the time I know there's special cases so amen forgive me for that but the majority of the time it's just the devil amen trying to to hold you down in a cage of bondage and affliction and make you believe that you belong there but you don't belong there you belong in a healthy body you belong in a healthy mind you belong in a healthy soul and a healthy Spirit tonight oh and Satan don't want your testimony but I think we should be determined tonight to be a testimony for the glory of God oh get some get some determination about you that I'm going to rise up and I'm going to receive something from the Lord this weekend and I'm going to become a testimony for the kingdom of God oh I'll not listen to The Devil's lie amen there's a reason he's attacking you oh and you think it's because that God's forgotten you but no Satan sees something in you that he's trying to Snuff out oh but he doesn't have the power to do it oh you see it's you you must get determined that you're not going to stay where you're at you must get an enthusiasm about you that you're going to rise higher because Satan will try to get you built up in a complex of self-pity to try to hold you there you see self-pity is an enemy to Healing because it'll try to hold you in a complex and then put your Stakes down and think well I've been sick for so long and I got prayed for but I'm not feeling any better but it's a cage holding you in your sickness amen but God is calling out of your sickness calling you out of that complex and calling you into a well body oh brother brandom said you'll resent me when I tell you that amen because you don't like to hear it and because you want to be you want to be pied you want people to feel bad for you and that's okay sometimes but sometimes it becomes the very thing that holds you in your sickness amen but get determined to break out of that complex tonight and say now is the day of my healing now is the day of my salvation now is the day where I'm going to become a testimony for the glory of God oh brother brandom said there was a woman with a blood issue for 12 years but she didn't have self-pity but when the master came by oh she said this is my opportunity that I've been waiting for in 12 years she suffered oh but in a moment in the presence of the Lord amen the word set her free oh what about blind bmus what about the the the the the the woman or the man at the pool of Bethesda I believe it was 30 some years he was sick but in a moment with the master he didn't pity himself he said this is my Exodus this is my moment of Deliverance oh my I think about Abraham and Sarah for 25 years they suffered but you know what they did brother Mike they didn't just sit there and complain but they went to the store and they got little booties for their baby they begin to get a crib what were they doing they were adopting the theme of The Promise oh they didn't just sit there and weary and worry they begin to adopt the theme oh of the oncoming visitation oh what about a girl named Mariah puid I I I stood actually I was the very next person behind behind her in that prayer line and there in that prayer line with that aliper that was robbing her of her hair she took those bobby pins into the presence of God and said I'm not going to adopt the theme of alopecia I'm not going to stay in this condition and pity myself and but I'm going to adopt the theme of The Glory of my hair being restored and she stands tonight with a headful of hair because she adopted the theme of her healing oh and it brought her out oh you see yes sometimes you got to change your expectation amen sometimes I know what it's like you come into a service after service and sometimes you're going through a low spot in your life and if you're not careful you'll start coming to service or or or coming to a new day and you're expecting trouble you're expecting to have a bad day you start to get into a theme of expecting bad days and trouble and and problems amen but that's when you have to change your expectation amen and say no this is not the way it's going to be I'm going to stop expecting trouble and start expecting a miracle I'm going to stop expecting trouble and problems and start expecting God to move I'm going to start expecting the coming of the Lord I'm going to start expecting my children to come back I'm going to stop expecting what Satan's trying to feed into my mind and I'm going to start expecting the promises of God to come to pass brother brandom said you heard about the lady that prayed for the Mountain to be moved and got up the next morning and looked out the window and said just as I expected still there well that's the reason she expected it that's right true he said if you expect that's what you receive right but then he said what about that se Phoenician woman amen who said uh Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and Jesus said for this thing go the devil's gone out and she went home and found the devil gone out of her daughter just as the Lord has said she didn't say well Lord you should have done it this way or Lord you should have done it that way but just whatever the word said that's what she expected to find and she found it and me brother BR said well if it never happened last night I'll be expecting it tomorrow night it'll be tomorrow night I'll be the one I'll be the one that receives the Holy Ghost I'll be the first one at the altar to repent of my sins I'll be the first one that God sanctifies and takes all the world out of me he said ask and you shall F find seek and you shall find knock and it'll be over and ask and it'll be given unto you so that's what you should expect brother Bram said are you going to be expecting a great healing service tomorrow night yes sir are you going to be expecting the Lord to pour out his blessings tomorrow night sure let's be expecting it be under expectation he said I expect the church to be on fire the glory of the Lord falling everywhere Sinners around the Altar and people getting saved and filled with the Holy Ghost just a great thing my anticipation and expectations is built way up high oh friends I think it's time you start letting your expectation match who you are amen and not match some denominational amen amen just weary lousy amen religious Christian amen but you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are adopted Sons and Daughters of God and you should allow your expectation to match who you are and me now we are sons of God you're not children of the devil you're Children of the promise children of God and you have a right to speak a word under inspiration and expect it to come to pass exactly like you spoke it Amen brother brandom spoke Three Squirrels am mean he shouldn't be expecting one squirrel or two squirrels he spoke Three Squirrels oh and if you let your expectation match who you are amen and stop giving your ground to the devil amen but put down a steak and say no the one who spoke it is the one who will perform it and I'm not going to let it slide I'm not going to give an inch to the devil amen and when you feel doubts coming in you doubt your doubts oh let your expectations match your identity you say well Exodus doesn't look possible well I'm glad you said that you see Joseph you see the orchestration of Joseph's life he was sold into slavery but all the while he was fulfilling a type of Christ and things were getting into position for an exodus amen and God had given him favor and used him to save Egypt in the seven years of famine he had built such a reputation till I mean for those 400 years amen they remembered him and what the Lord had done through his life but there rose up a new pharaoh who knew not Joseph and brother Brown said that this would Mark the beginning of an exodus and the the SEI had come after ramsy and he knew not the blessings of Joseph you see said he I don't know how you pronounce it but he honored Joseph but Ramsay's come along and didn't care he didn't honor the prophet he didn't honor Joseph but but here he come on the scene am mean but just at the right time because that was where Exodus was going to begin and and he feared the children of Israel as we read there in the the this opening text and mean and he began to order the midwives that if it was a male son that they should kill it and mean because he feared wh What the Lord was going to do he feared the promise and the prophecies amen but brother Brown said this book of EX this is based upon three heads he said it's based upon the power of Satan the power of faith and the power of God and he said Satan mostly knows God's program mostly but he tries to interfere and brother BR said we found out that Satan begin to display his power always first you know what that reminds me of is in is there anything too hard for the Lord Brother brand tells about Abraham and Sarah and how they were going to receive an oncoming visitation but Satan try to interrupt it and get them to think that something was wrong because the power of Satan usually always knows the program of God enough to act first so when you see that happening you begin to identify that this is the power of Satan and it's not that anything is wrong amen how many of you just had a perfect week with no troubles no it's a it's a meetings week you're going to have some bumps you're going to have some bruises but something that uh our pastor P helped teach me is that when you see those things that's not when you begin to doubt that something's wrong that's when you say okay there's an oncoming visitation the Lord's going to perform an exodus and this is just the power of Satan trying to act first to Snuff it out but he can't do it because God has ordained it and God has promised it should come oh and I believe that about this weekend and mean you may have had to fight through troubles and trials to get hereen but you look that devil in the eye and say no am mean I'm not going to doubt the the the the the the promise that I came for this weekend but this is my visitation hour this is my visitation time this is my weekend oh my you feel it even last night I begin to wonder I started it just seemed like I I couldn't get into that anointing and I think Lord you know you begin to wonder there something wrong you know and I got the wrong text and I just thought oh no uh Satan you may be trying to interfere but I'm expecting an oncoming visitation this weekend amen and so I'm not going to get worked up about something being wrong but I'm just going to keep studying this word because I believe God's going to do something in our midst oh it's just a devil when you realize his tactics you can recognize them and call him a bluff and begin to go forward in faith oh it's nothing wrong he tried to kill Abel Amen to stop that lineage he tried to kill Christ and here he tried to kill Moses before he could ever grow up he tried to destroy him but he couldn't do it because Satan cannot stop God's program he cannot stop the coming of the Lord from happening he cannot stop this message from going on oh and they come to find out the more they tried to stop them the stronger they grew am me brother brandom taught us that persecution strengthens the church mean he taught us these things that the fire that was put in amen those disciples from long ago it burned brightly and whenever they would try to blow it out it would just get stronger oh have you ever tried to blow on a fire I didn't think about this till just now but we had a fire break out in our toaster oven this weekend it was a sad thing we did all the wrong things to put it out and one of the things was blow on it and it didn't put it out because the more you try to blow on a fire oxygen feeds fire and the more Satan's Tred to blow on your life and give you Winds of opposition and Winds of persecution amen but you're burning brighter than you ever were before and because it's the Winds of opposition make the flame of God's church that we heard about last Thursday those Flames only get brighter and only grow stronger oh when the Winds of Satan try to blow against it oh he can't stop it he cannot stop this Exodus from coming to pass oh he cannot do anything about what God has promised oh my it's the power of faith is stronger than the power of the devil amen brother Brandon preaches a sermon called preparation and it begins to show that before God ever does anything he makes preparation and there must be a preparation for an exodus amen and he says be God before he does anything he always prepares for it and he said I want to do tonight by God's help if he'll let me is to speak his word to you that'll prepare your heart for the healing service he he said I've tried to speak to them upon your preparation the preparation for healing the preparation for salvation the preparation for victory brother Bram said I believe the people are in the preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know skipping down he says they are in the spirit of the last days and God cannot just send send destruction upon the people until they are in the spirit for Destruction you see the world we know we're living in the last days brother Brandon Begin to show us very clearly and mean and the people are getting in the spirit of the last days and am mean having a form of godliness and me and trying to hide under a religious cloak and Amen brother said they had to get in the spirit of the an deluvian world before they could be destroyed they have to have this be in the spirit of War before they can have war and he says in questions and answers the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days as the scripture said as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of lot showing that in that time there was a group that would get in the spirit of destruction amen and there was a group that would get in the spirit of those days he said so shall it be at the revealing of the son of man amen and so he makes preparation we see the world getting into preparation we see Israel getting into preparation to receive her Messiah they're getting all the materials together they're they're getting their red heer together they're they're waiting to sacrifice it and they're even saying that maybe they could do it this Passover because they're getting in prepar ation to receive their Messiah and what that means to us is that the bride is getting in preparation to leave the bride is getting in preparation for an exodus anden but God had to send a message to prepare a bride oh there's been three exoduses and he called him from a natural land to a natural land he called him from a spiritual condition to the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost and now he's calling from the spiritual baptism to the Eternal land of the Millennium and he sent his same pillar of fire with each Exodus to lead his people out amen and brother Brandon began to tell us and there in the scripture in that Luke 17 he said remember Lot's wife because Lot's wife looked back and she didn't follow that leadership out of Destruction and and brother brandom said there's a difference between a pillar of fire and a pillar of salt and you must turn one way and me God sent a message to prepare a bride amen but brother Brown tells us that the message would prepare one to stay and one to go and mean he said that he said what does it do it gets the elected ready for the shelter of God like in Noah's time and so forth it condemns the intellectual unbeliever to judgment it always has to spurn Mercy Mercy nothing left but judgment you see it gets the uh it gets the elected ready for the shelter of God while at the same time getting the unbeliever ready for Destruction you see in each Exodus he sent a messenger there in the first Exodus he sent Moses there in the second Exodus he sent John the Baptist to prepare away for the coming Messiah and in this Exodus he said behold I'll send you Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen and what did it do it separated you for the coming of the Lord and mean like it separated the wheat from the tears and mean it separated you Amen to not be a part of the plagues but to come and be a part of the coming of the Lord amen Revelations 18 1-4 if we could just amen just lay this down real quick before we move on it says after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean and hateful bird yes it is for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues oh brother brandom said come out that's the message of the hour there in Revelation 17 it revealed who mystery mystery Babylon was and then he said there the very next thing he did and Revelations 18 was called come out of her my people he sent a messenger right after revealing amen what that cage was amen he sent a voice to call a bride out of that cage anden and he ties the voice of Revelations 10:7 to the voice of Revelations 18:4 and saying that this voice amen that the same time that those seals were open this voice was calling come out of her my people come out of the church no come out of confusion come out of your condition come out of whatever system that that you're going through not come out of a uh uh just the the church or come out of the denomination but come out of the confusion and come into an identity that you might know who you are that you might know who your father is that you might know where you came from and where you're going and I believe we are living in the season of coming out he said come out from among them and be ye separate amen and touch not their unclean thing and I will receive you brother brand said am mean if there ever was a coming out time it ought to be right now come out and separate yourself from the things of the world brother Bram said I think it's a time it's just about another coming out party another Boston Tea Party oh my you know there they were back in 1773 and when there was some Sons of Liberty who had come over to a new land amen but that old land was still trying to rule over them amen and tax them and tax their tea and there they were they had this taxation without representation and they weren't fans of it and so they got in the spirit they begin to dress up like Indians and put that paint on and they went out and they threw all that tea off the boat I mean you know what that did those events begin to transpire and Lead away and until even they would sign a declaration of independence and mean because there was a spirit that come over him that we didn't come out of the old land just to live under the rule of the old land in this new land and know I believe there's some Sons of Liberty tonight that say I didn't come out of the denomination to serve a god under bondage but we have come into the message it's the word of the hour and it's the land of our day oh and brother Bram said you cannot bring those denominations over into this land for this is the word oh when the word won't mix with hybrid the word won't mix with denominational chains and oh I say let's come out oh do you ever get under the anointing of this message and you begin to feel the Liberty in the charge of it and you say my what can I come out of today what bondage can I get rid of today what chain of legalism what chain of fanaticism can I throw off today oh it's the spirit of Liberty that comes behind this message that says you didn't come here to stay in bondage we didn't come here and mean to have bondage in our worship in bondage in the preaching of the word in bondage in the way we dress oh it's a bunch of legalism you say well I never spoke in tongues you don't have to I believe it's for you if you want to but it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost we've been brought out of that land of Pentecostal age of bondage oh we've been brought into a land of liberty letting you know that if your name was written on the Lance Book of Life whether you dance or whether you don't whether you shout or whether you don't whether you speak in tongues or whether you don't you've been liberated by The Calling of this message saying come out of her my people come out of bondage come out of Babylon oh I believe it's a spirit of the message saying come out over my people and get ready for your Exodus oh and if he's bringing you out he's got a better place to take you oh and this message a will give you a liberty like you never knew it'll lift you into Heights that you never thought you could go oh if you'll trust it and if you won't bring the chains from the old land into this message and let it be what it is is oh it'll liberate your life it'll give you freedom to serve God oh you won't have to break out measuring tapes and you won't have to Oh My Oh Glory it's here you won't have to judge everything that comes across this pulpit and when you get into Liberty of this message oh it'll set you free from all of that old land Hallelujah it'll set you free oh well Glory I'm feeling a bit like the son of Liberty oh how are you feel oh let go of those chains of bondage oh and you see what this Third Exodus did is it took the bride out of the church and and when I was looking at that Boston Tea Party it said you know they used to they come to this meeting and they begin to get in the spirit of this and they said well well we used to call ourselves South Carolinians we used to call ourselves Virginians and but there they come and begin to gather together and there for the first time time they begin to call themselves Americans oh and that's so powerful am mean you used to call yourself Methodist you used to call yourself Lutheran you used to call yourself Baptist but when this message sounded you said that's not who I am I'm the bride oh I am not part of those denominations I am the bride I've been called out of the church I've been called out of the systems and I am a Son of God oh it's time for another coming out party you see the world has their coming out parties that's the phrase of the day and me I don't want to be a boy no more I don't want to be a girl no more and they actually have a coming out party but they get their family together and say hey this is who I am now oh but if that's true in the negative what about a bride and that's been called out to your true identity and said come out from among them and you wonder why you always felt different it wasn't because that you were a boy and you thought you were a girl no it was because there was a genan SE on the inside of your life that's why you were different but this message came and gave you a coming out party and you said oh I'm not a Methodist after all I'm not a Baptist after all I'm the bride oh wow it's a coming out party where you throw down your old your old identity and you take on the identity of this message oh throw out the logs come into your true identity come into the message of the Hour come into the identity of the word and and only let it call you what you are and refuse to take the label of the devil any longer come out from among them and be separate yeah amen oh coming to Christ Hallelujah now he said he cried mightily with a strong voice in Revelations 18:2 Babylon the great great is Fallen it's fallen and has become the habitation of devils Amen in the hold of every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean and hateful bird now you want to know what a prophet says about it he says she is a cage and has caught hateful unclean birds not Eagles now no no no he says vultures unclean hateful Birds that's what she's caged up around her she's got a cage full of them a whole cage full but there's no Eagles in there why because there was a mighty Angel calling them out saying you don't belong in there that cage is not for you that's right oh and he began to call him out because you see we're living in an eagle age and me it's more than just an animal it's it's it's the age of the hour and and brother brother Ray so beautifully brought that out Sunday how there's four anointings there's a an ox a man a lion and an eagle and me and those four beasts that were sent forth were sent forth to combat the four horse riders and he sent the the lion to combat that Roman age and then he sent the ox to combat that martyr age and then he sent the man to combat that intellectual age those reformers but he said in the evening time it was prophesied in Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4 that there would come an eagle age and that's the ones who would receive the opening of the word they were the ones that God would send a prophet and a prophet's likened onto an eagle and that Prophet would sound forth amen and it would be the very power that would combat that fourth horse rider that an Christ anointing and mean that that eagle anointing would stand up against it and mean and call a bride out of those systems and let her know who she is and where she belongs and so if you want to get in the spirit of the age I mean you're not going to get under an ox anointing as brother Ray said you're not going to get under a man anointing but you're going to get under an eagle anointing you see to be in the spirit of the age is not to be amen formal and lukewarm and Powerless that is not the age of your soul that is not the age that you belong in that's a layer to seeing age and but that's not the spirit of the age that you want to get into you want to get in the spirit of the eagle age and come up higher and come up and be a part amen of what you've been called to be in this hour it's an eagle age it's an eagle anointing and it's an eagle calling am mean an eagle calling calls Eagles I think that's one of the greatest amen Exodus examples I can think of Amen brother Tom is that eag that was in a chicken yard one day and there he was born in the chicken yard amen and there he was he he always felt a little different he always felt like he didn't belong with them Eagles he always felt a little different and it was uh hatched in there because the farmer needed another egg to complete the setting and I believe brother brandom said a setting of eggs is 15 I'm not I don't know myself but he they they were one short is the main point and they needed another egg and so they put an eagle under there amen that it might fill that spot and there he began to hatch forth and go through the motions of Life am me but never really felt like he belonged and one day there come forth a a sound that he recognized and it was Mother eagle flying over beginning to call him out and mean and he understood that language when she cried out Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever when she began to cry out the end time word she understood that because it was Eagle to Eagle and and it actually began to make sense to her and that's why I believe that these terms even am me the wonderful things our pastor's preaching on on the third pole and the seventh seal I don't believe those are just buzzword to get us excited I believe that's our language that's been released in this age that could never be released before but it's been release to you and that's why it makes you rejoice and that's why and mean it stimulates your soul is because it's the language and that you understand as Eagles oh and that eagle began to scream and there he made his first jump and he jumped up onto that Barn post amen and brother Carrie it wasn't high enough but you know what I I'd say it might have been higher than he ever was before it wasn't high enough but you know what he probably never knew he could get on that post before and mean there he spent his whole life and finally he's like hey and mean something screaming and and I'm on this post and I've never been up here and mean because this message will call you up higher and me this message and mean sometimes you feel like it's preaching above you but it's not to put you down it's to call you up and mean it's calling you up because mother Eagle's up there letting you know that this is where you need to come and the message will call you higher and you say well how am I supposed to get there and mean you just start with a flap of your wings you see that's how that eagle got to that post just a flap of its wings and you know the same flap of his wings that would put him on a barnyard post could put him in the sky oh you know how the children of Israel got out of Egypt it started with a step and mean and you're wondering how you're going to make a Rapture how did you get this far and mean have you ever taken a step well then just take another one and just take another one and one of these days that step will put you from justification to sanctification it'll put you in the Holy Ghost it'll put you in adoption it'll put you in the change of your body oh because the message is calling you higher wave after wave after wave oh and that eagle you know what he did and mean he realized and mean that that fence couldn't hold him any longer oh my brother brandom said you can't organize Pentecost you can't denominate Pentecost is an experience not an organization it's for you Methodist you Baptist you Presbyterians he said they try to draw fences around it but it's not so Eagles will fly right over it don't pay no attention to it oh my you know what that tells me and mean brother Brandon would teach us that this message can't be denominated and now I understand why because this is an eagle message and eagles fly over fences oh and they try to fence up this message and say that the power of God don't move no more and say that the days and miracles are pass oh but this is an eagle message and it says I am not bound by man-made fences and chicken theology oh but that eagle flies out and breaks forth and the sick are healed anyway and the bound are delivered anyway and they're still filled with the Holy Ghost anyway I mean because Pentecost isn't a denomination it's an experience I me you can't fence it in it's still being poured out I believe it's being poured out this weekend and me and Satan cannot fence up Eagles oh my and and you're an eagle and he's tried to fence you up and try to confine you to a little area and hold you there and pin you down and saying you're never going to come out of that fence you're never going to come out of that depression you're never going to come out of that anxiety but when mother Eagle screams it lets you know who you are and it lets you know that fences are not the hindrance in your life any longer oh that old I can't attitude that mother chicken tat you I mean that might belong in the chicken dictionary but it doesn't belong in an eagle dictionary so throw it out and me the fences amen the sky is the limit oh there's no limit to what God can do for you his Eagles tonight he's preparing a people oh to believe all things oh and when mother Eagle begin to call it lets you know that you don't belong in the chicken yard oh you're there but you don't belong there right oh I'm here but I don't belong here oh you know what Moses was raised up in Pharaoh's Palace amen but there're come a day when God called him out of that Palace and he was raised up there but he didn't belong there oh glory and you might have been raised up under an organization and you might have been raised up under depression and me because God may have been teaching you something whether they come and calling out day in your life where he said you've been there long enough you've learned all you need to know and I'm ready to adopt you and place you as my children that you might soar in the heavenlies and you begin to recognize that what you were raised up under wasn't where you belonged oh my I so love it because Exodus 1:1 before we break into this book of Exodus the very first verse says amen that the children of Israel came into Egypt oh why doesn't it call them the children of Egypt because what they were going through was not who they were and mean and what you are going through tonight does not define who you are but you are not the children of Egypt you are the children of Israel you are the children of the promise and the trials that you're going through now do not define who you are oh you may feel like you're Earthbound some days but the word says who you are and it says you are a heavenbound bird and you belong in the heights of the heavenlies oh and you may feel like you're going through a trial tonight brother Samuel but I'll tell you this and me Eagles are born high above the ground and tree nest and and they belong in the sky so if they find themselves on the ground am mean maybe a bad day and mean they may find themselves there but that's the lowest place they're ever going to go oh glory and you may be having a bad day or a bad week but that's all it is it's a bad day it's a bad week but it's the lowest you're ever going to go because you came from God and you're going back to God and the lowest Satan can bring you it's a little trial or a little trouble or a bad day but when the mother Eagle calls you oh it lets you know I might be having a bad day but this is the only lowest place I can go I can't go to hell I can't go in the tribulation the farthest I can go is a bad day a little trial a little heartache but I know in just another day I'll be back up in the heavenlies I'll be going back where I belong oh you don't belong in the chicken yard you are not defined by your conditions you are defined by the seed oh doesn't Genesis say every seed would bring forth after its kind and if you are an eagle you'll bring forth after your kind and you say well my maybe I'm just going to wreck up one of these days maybe I'm just going to come to my end maybe I'm really hypocrite maybe I'm really just a Judas oh but you can look the devil in the eye and say according to the identification of the word it wasn't so from the beginning I never was a Judas I never was a hypocrite I always was an eagle I always was a Son of God oh because the word defines you the word lets you know who you are and if you ever find type brother Joel in the word then you know you can't beat your type and mean and if your type is Judas you can't beat it but if your type is Abraham if your type is Moses oh you can't beat your type oh brother brandom said your anointing tells on you whatever your spirit is moves you you're motivated by a spirit oh my your anointing tells on you have you ever done something brother Zachary and you try to tell Mama that well it really happened this way and then your sibling comes up and says says no no no I seen it this is what happened and they tell on you amen and that's how your anointing is amen out of your mouth you begin confessing well I I I'm not a Christian I'm not a son of God I mean this message isn't for me the Rapture isn't for me amen but then all of a sudden you come into the house of God and the anointing begins to move and all of a sudden you come into the house of God with a head hang down ready to give up but your anointing begins to tell on you and anointing begins to say I've just gotten started I don't going to give up I'm not going to back down I'm not going to let the devil have my victory oh your anointing begins to tell on you and say no you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God and this is your Exodus oh this is not fanaticism this is your Exodus this is Christ oh he's your Exodus he's your Exodus from amen sickness to health it's Christ I mean you don't belong there oh you know in this age it's the age of pronouns he she him her were amen but they can put any pronoun in front of them amen but that doesn't necessarily Define who they are oh but the word it lies not and when the word defines you that's who you are and if the word says you're loosed you're loosed and if the word says you're Justified you're Justified and if the word says you're free you're free if the word says you're healed you're healed if the word says you're delivered you're delivered oh you're mistake don't Define you your failures don't Define you you see Abraham he lied but when Paul wrote an account of his life he said he was strong in faith and stagger not at the promise of God you see what defined Abraham in his end account it wasn't his mistakes oh it was that he was a hero of the faith oh and you are not defined by your conditions or what the devil says about you oh brother Brandon said science tries to say that a bumblebee is too heav to fly amen but the Bumblebee must not have heard what science was saying cuz it got up and flew anyhow amen and that's what you do am me the devil tries to tell you that what you're limited to and what you're defined to and mean but you just cut out the voice of that science devil and you just fly away anyhow because it's in your species it's in your seed to do it oh fly out of there despite what the science says despite it you know despite means without being affected by or without taking any notice or being influenced by not prevented by amen and you know tonight amen whether a service goes good or whether a service goes bad I'm a preacher despite that because God's called me to it and and our brother Wayne is a pastor despite whether it's hard or whether it's easy because God's put him in that position and me and you are a Christian and mean despite the good days or despite the bad days because despite what it says doesn't change who you are Amen in this church oh it's been through troubles it's been through trials it's been through heartaches but you're still here that's right despite what the devil's tried to do for you oh because that is not the definition of your life you belong you belong in the skies and me and there's a call saying come back to where you belong you belong in my kingdom and you're not here by accident but God's called you to this position God knows brother Bram said God knows just exactly where you belong in what age you belong in you see he didn't put you in this age by chance but it pleased him to choose you and he chose you for this age because he knew am mean that you belonged here under this flying eagle anointing and sometimes you think my I'm just an impostor I I don't really fit in everyone else is true but I'm just a fake but it pleased him to choose you and chose you for this position because you belonged here and mean sometimes you're almost scared to enjoy your Liberty because you think maybe I'm going to have a flop and end up back down in that chicken yard oh but don't let fear keep you out of where you belong don't let that doubt keep you out of where you belong amen he's calling you Amen to act like the eagle you are saying it's time church it's time my bride I've called you out this is who you you are and it's time to start acting like who you are it's time to start worshiping Like an Eagle it's time to start amen praising Like an Eagle it's time to start walking like an eagle and talking like an eagle and mean because that's who you are that's where you belong amen get some ambition about you amen as we begin to close the musicians amen could come you're built upon High Ambitions because you belong in the sky an eagle is a special built bird word that's right yeah in the deep as it calls to the deep in your life you know there's a deep to respond when the children of Israel were coming out of Egypt amen Joshua had to remind them when they passed by Esau's Mountain that that wasn't their inheritance and because they have tasted of blood and mean they they wanted to go fight but he had to say no that's not your inheritance and but brother Brandon my believe says because they tasted of denominations they wanted to go there but he's letting you know no that's not where you belong Jacob's mountains on the other side of the Jord and church that's where you belong and it begins to say that we can't make them all see it we can't make all the Lutheran see it we can't make all the methodists see it but he said to you who believe to you who know to you that's got something in you that's calling to the Deep if all the Deep you've got has been satisfied he says then stay where you are but for me in my house there's something more that we've seen there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep calling to the Deep he says I cannot be satisfied with theology I cannot be satisfied with a good church I cannot be satisfied with a good campaign I cannot be satisfied with a little healing service there's something beyond that that's calling oh friends if you feel it calling to you tonight anden then it's time to get into the vision of the message amen oh it's time to rise above it all it's time to set your wings to The Winds of the word and because it's an eagle message oh it'll be a wind that'll take you from Glory onto glory and this Eagle age Exodus won't just end in another age it'll end in a body change and he's calling you higher come up my bride you're an astronaut you're an eagle and mean get some ambition about you if we' seen the power of God tonight let's see missing limbs restored tomorrow let's see our loved ones Among Us Sunday let's see the power of God move amen friends we don't know how many services we have left amen but we're Eagles we're built upon an ambition and if the coming of the Lord is that close am mean how soon am mean are we going to see those loose hands tied together how soon are we going to see those last prodigal come home those last Souls filled with the Holy Ghost oh set your wings to the word set your wings to those Winds of faith and let them lift you into the heavenlies and ride it out of whatever condition you're in amen oh he says he says there he says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering the raptured age you know the church can't go in its condition it can't get any better it must get worse and there he says it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on Amen it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus sayith the Lord oh the move is on he's calling you out Church he's calling us higher that's my uh that's my that's my burden for the service tonight amen we've got more meetings coming amen but my burden what's on my heart for tonight is come up higher amen if I could say something to you tonight I pray that the preaching of this message has nothing to do with me it's it's the message calling oh and why don't you respond would you like a higher walk would you
