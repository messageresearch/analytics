a text from Brother Daryl there I know some of you probably did but sister Missy's coming along grade and was able to go up and see her yesterday and I got to witness something wonderful she's she's woke up now and she's she was able to move her hands and things and uh it was it was pretty neat cuz sister Rachel went down and got her a a Coke and a Cherry Coke and and she had took a little sponge and she was giving her her first taste of anything since her surgery and you are seen Missy's eyes she wasn't talking with her mouth but her eyes were she was in love and so it was such a blessing I know they had her up today and the Lord is just moving there and she's just getting better every day and we thank the Lord for that amen and amen we we certainly appreciate that family and they're amen they're uh very strong and amen we had a tremendous time down at the uh camp meetings and uh I know some of you were down there with us or several of you and amen you know it was a powerful time of the Lord and amen but we've heard so many good things about Sunday here and the services and amen we certainly appreciate the Lord for what he's doing amen his mercy and amen we just want to uh tonight if we can we uh got a few things on her heart and amen uh I'd like to get back into this book of Ephesians and U we're going to be looking here in Ephesians chapter 4 um I'm going to try to uh labor a little bit in this uh if the Lord just keeps me in it and I may pull out of it and come back but uh for the next month and a half or so we're going to try to labor in this and and finish this finish this portion of the book amen Ephesians chapter 4 and I want to read from the 23rd verse and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created and righteousness and true Holiness I like the way Paul says that and righteousness and true Holiness amen wherefor putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another now be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath I like way he says this neither give place to the devil and that's kind of where we want to speak to you a little bit tonight don't give the devil a place right let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you tonight we thank you for the Gathering of your children here Lord and the blessing father that wherever two or three are gathered in my name there that you would be in the midst of them and father I pray tonight that your great would just come upon your word as we have been endeavoring to look upon these things Lord seeking you asking you for your grace Lord in these subjects and we just ask now that you would come Lord and you would lead us in your word speaking to the needs father now we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you as you could have your seats amen I want to talk to you a little bit tonight about don't give the Dev a place now Jesus says it here in the Book of John the 14th chapter 29th verse he said I told you before that it come to pass when it came to pass you might believe Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of the world cometh and have nothing in me amen I want to say it the way the Lord said it that devil ain't got nothing in me amen he had no place in God he had no place in Christ he had nothing in him you know I find that uh is the Bible has predicted that this is a great season of of uh Supernatural manifestations even as the Bible would call it the day when the son of man is to be revealed now if you wonder how far that's come along they asked brother brandom said when the son of man is revealed from Heaven said when will that be brother BR said he's now being revealed from heaven so we find that we have found ourselves in in the junction of time amen and immortality and mortality have began to Junction together and that's why the age has been chalk full of Supernatural events and angels and manifestations of every kind and uh and even in the anointing of the great seventh angel when he began to come uh in anointed ones of the end time of course the Bible talks about Christ and false Christ so we know there's great anointings coming upon the end time and it's for the manifesting or the fulfilling of scripture that's why the anointing is coming and brother Ram tells us this in not one's the end time he said now I want you to know and you that listen to this tape that you might have thought today that I was trying to say something about myself being that I was packing a message but I have no more to do with that than nothing it's just a voice and my voice against my better judgment and I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I have declared to do and determined to do now I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river y'all know this quote well don't you and I was only standing there when he appeared now people wonder so brother Wayne when's the appearing of the lord well listen to this I was standing there when he appeared I'm the one that performs the things and foretells them that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to yes sir it he spoke through it isn't me not the seventh angel It's the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded not a man God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one you're feeding on now this is what he's saying you're he's the one you're feeding on now you're not feeding on a man a man and his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man now if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above denominations I pray that you do at this time now notice what he's telling us amen and I love the way brother bam introduces this he says to us it wasn't what I did it's what I surrendered myself to it was God was appearing it was the appearing of the Lord it was the revealing of the son of man but there had to be a body to manifest that there had to be a lot of people kind of gets that mixed up on the sheath waving and they they get worried whether or not you believe it was brother bandam or you believe it was Christ but of course it was Christ but he had to have a body to manifest through to prove that it was the full maturity or the adoption age amen and we seen that he did it because now this is prophecy of what he surrendered himself to now Hebrews the first chapter uh it says God in Sun Times spoke through diverse manners to the fathers but in the last day by his son Christ Jesus now brother Ram said there it is it's the Holy Spirit taking possession of the church to operate Christ in the church now he's going to compare now he Hebrews 1 with Revelations 10 and Luke 17 he's telling you what is happening is it's what I was surrendering to it was Christ it was not the seventh angel it was the son of man it's Christ coming in see it's the Holy Spirit taking possession Amen to operate Christ in the church now when you become as he was he become as you was now how could he become as he was he become you that you might become him now it's above our understanding and there's no way to explain that and don't try just accept it see he spoke it and that settles it just say it's right and believe it am amen all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he's poured it in the church now don't try to explain that just believe that amen just believe that's the truth amen I might not be able to make a sense of that but I certainly believe it's the truth and know that God made a way for it to do it now of course it didn't happen all to once did it amen when God poured himself into you amen he baptized you with the Holy Ghost it was the changing of the Soul we know that we had an old soul and it died and a New Soul and people tried to say well there's two Souls no it was a redeemed soul and if you're wondering just take the the Earth itself and look there's not there's three different Earths three different worlds one Earth right amen so there's an old you and a new you amen and God created but that Spirit began to move on you but but brother Bram says it like this from the Messiah he says see he told Joshua that he could possess everywhere his foot touched right amen so when Joshua crossed the Jordan River R he was in the promised land but he didn't possess every inch of it the first day but as he began to walk and you remember brother man said he said how did Grant take Richmond he said just as he came to it and how do we take the promised land just as we come to it and whenever you put your foot on something you begin to possess it and brother Ram said see what's happening he says see there's when a person's borned again he says it's like a button like the light about the size of a button entered your soul he said then it begins to take over it begins to it begins to now what it was promising in this age is it's promising a complete possession right not just justification that light will grow out to sanctification it'll grow out to a baptism of the spirit but it'll even go further than that in this age it will be an incarnate God or it will come to the place of full manifestation of every scripture that is written for the bride Church it begins to take possession and brother bam says it begins to take over the fibers of of you that's powerful isn't it he begins a spreading out he goes to working through you in you and around you amen it begins a a feeling of the fibers some many ever heard brother Bram say I want to I want to be so full till every fiber is filled up is that right now listen if you want to keep the devil out you just get full is that right amen if you want to keep the devil out of your life just get your life so full of God there's no room for the devil amen amen if you get a glass completely full there's no room for anything else in it and when alive and every fiber of your body begins to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen there's no room for the devil amen because it's a pressing out of the devil it's a pushing and and now the devil was inhabiting I know he was but there's a dis inhabiting of the devil and an inhabiting of God in the age that we're living in now the prophet tells us of course he says about man you remember brother B talking about man's a even in his Fallen State he's still a God right and he talks about how that a man could stand on one side of the world and break a glass on the other side of the world and he said that's the reason that God was man and man was God and we are his offsprings and he's only trying to get a hold of a man or get a man in his hand and that's all J's trying to do is get a man in his hand that's really what he wants amen remember brother BR said the most powerful thing in the world is not an atomic bomb he said it's a believer in contact with his maker and when a Believer gets in contact with his maker he already was an offspring of God he already was a son but he was a fallen son and when the spirit of God comes upon him he becomes a redeemed son and a redeemed son in contact with his God Amen there's nothing God cannot do through that man all things are possible to him that believes is God Amen because you become so full and your every fiber becomes full of God until God can operate through that human being in a Divine way I think it's powerful tonight in the Messiah brother brandom tolds us he said not not everything is a con conductor not all theology is the right kind of conductor so if you're trying to get electricity from the power pole into this place you got to have a conduit to do so and there's wires that'll carry that electric and amen and if you turn the lights on back here lights don't come on we don't go around and say hey there's no such thing as electricity amen we go back checking is it the breaker is it the conduit what what is it that has been broken because we know electricity is real we've seen it too many times but if there's no light in the room amen then we've got to find out what is the problem well I tell you there's something to do with a conduit there's something amen that has broken down between the power source and the outlet and brother B said see not all theology is a conductor to the power of God not all not everything you hear will be a conductor to the power of God it's good to see you brother Carle amen I know you he worked to get here here tonight amen you see what it is not everything is a conduit sometimes brother R says it like this a lot of theology is an insulator to it a lot of theology is an insulator to the power of God it ought to be see the word of God ought to bring the power of God the word of God are to bring life the word of God are to bring healing amen but when theology becomes an insulator to the power of God that's time to get rid of the theology I don't know about you but I'm not interested in being a theologian I want to be a Son of God full of the power of God Amen with the grace of God in our lives tonight and I believe that I believe a lot of theology is an insulator from it and I know there's a lot of churches but not all churches are True Churches brother bam said it's called Blasphemous names there's a lot of theology there's a lot of religiosity Amen but there is a true church in the middle of all of this there is a true church and I just think and believe that we're a part of that true church I don't believe are that only true church but I believe we're a part of the body of the True Church of the Living God because brother Ram said Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts see what it is it's not the acts of a man it's the acts of God in a man it's not what we can do it's what can we surrender ourselves to amen if God could get a man in his hand what could really happen in the house of God tonight if we could get every fear and every doubt and every anxiety and every every bit of the theology that brings fear upon man what could God do if he could get you in his hands tonight amen the gift brother Ram said was man getting out of the way so God could come into the church and act the way he wants to brother Ram said Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts and it shows that how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and he would try to defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless now there is the uh there is what the objective of the Antichrist spirit is the objective the Antichrist is to defile to make lukewarm formal and Powerless so when you see something trying to defile the moving of the spirit something trying to make a people lukewarm amen or make them formal and make them powerless that's is the object of the Antichrist Spirit now what is the object of the spirit of God Amen to make a man in his hand so he can become conduit to the works of God and he could become another book of Acts when God is dealing with you amen you become an open conduit for the spirit of God when the spirit of the Antichrist is dealing with you you become closed up fearful doubtful unbelieving amen become ashamed of the things of God because you see the the the Antichrist spirit is anti- word or anti the move of God Amen now the seed of discrepancy brother bam says when when a man stands a gospel preacher even and says the days of Miracles is passed that is the seed of discrepancy now if you go back to the Book of Genesis the serpent seed remember it was the seed of the serpent which was sown contrary to the word of God had Adam and Eve only stayed with the word life would have come by the word but the moment that Satan come in he anointed Eve with unbelief of God's word and that was the great that that Eve only fell on One Promise how many knows that only fa on one promise and that promise was that God would keep his word and when and when he was anointed with it watch now amen the prophet says see anything of course that's a seed of discrepancy is something that's contrary to the word of God so so now we see hear things today that's contrary to the word and we don't want to call it the devil but really that's what it is it's the seed of the devil it's a word that is spoken that is contrary to the word of God and it's the days of Miracles it's pass see that's the seed of discrepancy when a man stands a minister a pastor of a church somewhere and they do not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the seed of discrepancy when he says that miracles in the apostolic age has passed that's the seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such thing as Divine Healing that's the seed of discrepancy and the world is full of it and it crows out and chokes down the weed have you ever felt choked down have you ever heard have you ever been in conversations that choke you down you know what I'm talking about amen you're on fire for God it's like somebody's trying to take a wet blanket and just choke down what you really believe about the power of the Living God let me tell you what it is it's the seed of discrepancy it's the devil amen and the world is full of it and it tries to choke down the weed brother R said now listen if you don't think that this Spirit ain't still alive now here's the audacity can you imagine The Audacity Of This Spirit it went to Brother brandham ministers went to William brandham can you imagine and they said I want to straighten you out on something when we get a chance and brother brand says this is the best chance I know come on over now amen and he said well Mr brandom you're trying to say I believe you're sincere and honest but you're trying to introduce the world to an Apostolic Doctrine he said and the apostolic age ceased with the apostles brother AB brah said the first thing I'd like to know brother is do you believe the word of God is inspired he said yes sir I certainly do he said then when you show me that in the word where the apostolic age ceased and if you can show me where that is I'll believe it with you amen I'll believe it with you but he couldn't show it to him in the word because it had never ceased and the apostolic age will never cease as long as God is calling people he is still healing and saving and delivering and filling them with the Holy Ghost brother B said it like this we can still preach Divine Healing and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we can still have the power of God to separate us from the things of the world this Apostolic age has never ceased and it never will it's going to go on and I love how brother Brown comes along behind it and he says see though Scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it amen don't you believe it amen and three Witnesses brother BR said but here's the thing the Antichrist spirit is not a communistic spirit the Antichrist spirit is a religious spirit amen and brother Ram said he had delivered himself so can you imagine brother Ram held a whole meeting in three Witnesses in near Pennsylvania to say that the communistic spirit was not the Antichrist the Antichrist was religious amen because people didn't know that in that day amen and we don't need to forget that now amen that the Antichrist spirit is not a communistic spirit it is a religious spirit and the worst devil there is the worst demon there is amen the one that killed Jesus was a religious party and they want to say it was the devil that killed him so amen we want to watch that going to church and being religious has nothing to do with the Born Again of the Holy Ghost and become a Christian it's a different thing so going to church and being religious has nothing to do with a born again experience of almighty God let me say something to you tonight amen I know that Christians go to church but church has never saved nobody I know Christians go to church but church has never healed nobody but it's the power of the holy ghost that comes into a church by a divine revelation that fills Hearts amen and I tell you today the prophet of God was inditing this generation he was not inditing the sinner go read it he said I'm not inditing that sinner out there I'm divid I'm in inditing the pull pits for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ they did not Cru his physical body They Crucified the effects of the word as it was being preached the Antichrist spirit is not a communistic spirit it is a religious spirit and the worst demon I know of is a religious spirit amen somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I I know some fundamental preachers well brother BR said they can be fundamental he said and they preach all the fund fals of the scripture but they deny the power thereof the power of what the power of the Gospel preach the gospel but deny the power of it can you imagine it's a l to see and worship Church what is it it's a worship that's beautiful and formal but cold and dead it's culture and education have taken the place of a spirit-given word isn't that something the world we're living in it's got a beautiful worship it's got a me a religiosity amen great intellectual preachers but it's cold and it's dead and they have let education take the place of a spirit filled word well I don't know about you tonight but I'm not going to give no place to the devil amen education will never take the place of a Spirit-filled word education will never take the place of a holy ghost filled Church of a living God Amen I'll tell you just good theology coming into the church will never take the place of what it means for the Holy Ghost to get a hold of a preacher and begin to discern hearts and speak lives in the lives and amen Minister back forth I I stopped on the way up from uh from the camp and talked with Brother David and sister Faith had lunch with them on Tuesday and they were going on and on about the service here Sunday Amen on and on she said they were telling me said well brother Wayne said Brother Ray done such a wonderful job said but come app point in the service when the Holy Spirit just took him over and he started ministering right to needs he said got right in the car with some of the kids were coming up and the discussions they were having and the Holy Spirit begin to listen folks education will never replace that education will never get that amen it'll take a Spirit-filled man speaking a Spirit-filled word that's what this generation needs it's got colleges it's got education it's got formality but what this age needs is a real God that's alive and he meets us on Sunday mornings it's it's not just come together to shake hands and fellowship and hear an intellectual teaching oh B we want to see the Lord Jesus amen as he begins to move through the congregation and he speaks personally to the needs and the lives and and somebody might get the Holy Ghost in the middle of the preaching amen somebody might receive healing in the middle of the preaching we need a spiritual atmosphere with a spiritual touch of the power of God we got no place for the devil here in True Word Tabernacle his powerless and formal worship has no place in this church no place for the devil no place for theology no place for education I say God feel every fiber feel every every element of this room well somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God the power of the Gospel I believe it amen the Moab worship was was fundamental but it was powerless seven altars seven Rams oh but they didn't have that Pillar of Fire but there Moses was up there on the mountain Oh my he had fundamentalism too but it was backed by the power of God now a true revelation of the two spirits that work within the church Amen brother Bram said If by God's spirit we're able to discern and withstand that Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her isn't that powerful if you can discern the Antichrist Spirit it is powerless before you in other words that if you're able to see it and discern it it exposes it so it has no power over you somebody says to you well don't you y'all don't worship like that but see if you know that's the devil talking to you you go I don't have to listen to you you're not my dad you're not my mom you ever seen a little kid they and another little kid tell them what to do amen they say it with authority and another little kid looks say he not my mama cuzz they know that kid has no authority over them well this Antichrist teaching has zero authority over the bride of Christ not our Daddy has nothing to do with us now this is the time of discernment you got to have discernment in this age you got to discern in this age amen you got to have strong meat belonging to them that are full age that they might exercise the ability to discern between an antichrist and the spirit of Christ you said preacher how do you discern I'll tell you brother Ram gave us a key now a key is powerful because you have the key it fits in all the different locks and brother Ram gave us a key of discerning Spirits you know what he gave us the key of he said the way I was able to lay out the church ages and the messenger of the ages he says it's because Jesus Christ never changes he is the same yesterday today and forever and his nature never changes he said so I was able to see him in every age and he was able to lay out so that's why that you can discern the spirit of Christ brother Braham said well somebody said well brother Wayne I don't know if preachers are to have discernment do you know brother Bram said if you're a Christian you'll be able to discern if somebody's a Christian within just a few minutes that's right amen if if you're now the problem I have is that discernment sometimes tells me what I'm dealing with and the person don't want to everybody to know that so then they get mad at me but but the spirit of Christ discerns by the word of God you know something is of God or something's not of God right now the Bible says in 1 John chapter 4 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirit whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out into this world try the spirit Revelation 2 and2 it said thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and they are not and has found them Liars now in the Ephesian Church age brother Bram said it's not really you that tries the Apostle and the prophet and the teacher it's the word that tries them amen it's the word y'all yall y'all had to forgive me but I've I've had my I've had my share of uh of matches throughout 25 years of traveling amen and one thing I found out is a false teacher or a false preacher does not like questions you want to make a false preacher mad at you ask him a question about his theology man he'll get mad and get mad and fly off the handle at you every time because you're question is a challenge and and what's bad is in my early age I was so innocent I was really asking because I'd heard brother BR say something and he had taught something then I heard somebody say something and I'd be like but brother Bram said that why you teach that and I was just innocent in my questions but I found out that they was not well received at all amen because you see what it is is that it that God gives us the word to try Spirits amen that's what we see in John CH 4 and: 2 the Bible said hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God now watch not that he has come but that he is come now there's a lot of difference in that because there's a lot of people believe in a 2,000 year old Jesus and they believe in Jesus back then if you try to tell them about current Revelation they'll say I don't know nothing but Jesus and him crucified but see he raised up on the third day amen and Jesus Jesus is come in the flesh today and Jesus today is the Holy Ghost he's not the Holy Ghost is not an emotion as some has made it it's not tongues as some has made it it's not a Doctrine as some has made it amen the Holy Ghost is a person it is the person of almighty God and it has come in this day to manifest himself in the form of a bride this is the bride coming of Christ she is Anointed with the spirit of truth and the continuation of the book of Acts now I tell you what in this age we're going to have to do is discern withstand and overcome that devil and you said brother Wayne overcome yes the Bible tells us that we will overcome in this age but to overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks now watch lots of people say there is no devil that it's just a thought and don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real Dev devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil but at the same time you recognize him you've got to know he's a devil he's against you but to overcome that you've got to recognize that greater and mightier is he that is in one of who has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match to him that's real overcoming when you recognize there's a real devil listen that's not just a bad mood you're in it's a devil that's not not just anxiety it's a devil it's not just sickness it's a devil come on it's not just jealousy it's a devil it's not just malice or Strife or Envy it's a devil and a devil has nothing to do with the bride of Jesus Christ it's a devil and it's time to call it a devil come on you ain't going to talk it you ain't going to talk no devil out of somebody amen it'll have to be the word of God that brings it out of listen let me just say it like I believe it I don't believe you can educate at a devil out of somebody I don't believe you can theologize a devil out that's not a word but I made it up it's it's a fitting word right now but you got to recognize the devil that he's real that Devil he's a real devil and listen that Devil's really after you he's really wanting to destroy you he he is a thief he's a robber right amen he's a murderer he's a liar from the beginning he if he comes the only kills comes to steal kill and Rob amen but what he's looking for is a door to get in that's all he's looking for is a door to get in and you've got to realize that he's real and then you got to stand up against him well I'll tell you if you got Christ in you you're more than a match for the devil that's right you're more than a match from that devil to withstand means to stand up against to oppose with a firm determination to resist successfully amen it means to be proof against resist the effect or W with withand the impact of something to stop or to obstruct the course of something it means resisting the devil it means amen it means to obstruct the course that Satan would take watch when we find out this I I found out in James chapter 4 it's a beautiful scripture and James says it like this submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you but listen most people get in that and all they start with is resist the devil well that's real good but if you get the first part right then you can resist the devil because the first of it says submit yourself therefore to God Amen do you know the Bible teaches us that pride comes just before the fall and and the Bible even tells us that God resisteth the proud and give grace to the humble so if you want to find something powerful in your life you've got to find an ability to humble yourself or to submit yourself to God watch where we started it's not what I did it's what I surrendered myself to and as the Church of the Living God becomes a when you become aware that the immortal God is in the room that if we begin to submit ourselves amen then we're able to resist the devil because there's something in us that can do the resisting if we can resist him we can withstand him we can oppose him I love it amen man we can protest everything that he's doing now Satan will be powerless before us if we can understand him withstand him and resist him he can become powerless isn't it be wouldn't it be something if Satan was completely powerless in your home in your life in your church in your experience you said preacher it's not possible it is possible brother bam said you can withstand this Spirit if you can discern and this Antichrist Spirit withstand it that Satan will be power powerless before her now if you want to take it to the scripture brother brandom uses this portion of scripture in the back of the Book of Matthew the 8th chapter and the 29th verse it's when Jesus is crossing the Seas and he's going to the tombs of the gardian and Jesus is going just for a oneman Revival now I tell you wherever the word goes there's going to be Revival now the Bible tells us that he went to a graveyard I I tell you I like to type it a bit like leosia amen that it was a person that was full of devils as leosia has been filled with Devils amen and they were bound a lunatic spirit and it was crazy man now now now now you got to know brother Brandon said the way this man got in this shape amen is that he lied about something and Spirits began to gather one to the other until he became in this kind of condition amen and when Jesus went to him the Bible tells us that the man come out to meet Jesus you know the story brother bam said he come out and he was going to he was going to thought he was going to destroy Jesus till he realized that the one that threw him out of Heaven standing in this man and when he begin to realize it you know what he done he begin to worship and begin to beseech the Lord and the 31st verse the Bible said the Devils besought him and and and if thou cast us out suffer us to go into that herd of swine yeah now listen God does not possess animal Souls animals don't have a soul that God can get in them but demons possess animals remember the first serpent in the Bible a demon possessed that man he got into his Spirit and the Bible tells us here that the devil saw that he was going to be without a body now brother Brandon will teach us a very powerful lesson he said if the devil is without a body he's powerless a devil floating around here is powerless he can scratch at the door he can beat on your heart he can try his best to speak to you but until you open the door he is powerless amen I tell you what this devil do y'all know the devil knows amen that the Millennium is coming and he knew that Jesus was the king of the Millennium and and as he was speaking to him he actually asked the Lord he said why tormented me before my time and he knew the Lord was about to remove him from his his Temple where he was exercising his power but he asked a favor said Lord won't you put me in these swine Lord let me go into the swine because he needed a tabernacle to go into you see the Devil is a spirit and if you talk about demons they're real now but demons are Fallen Angels they are the spirits that influence people amen and they need a tabernacle they need someone to get into they don't speak unless they can use your voice and and they don't hurt unless they can use your hands and they don't they're not able to do things unless they can get into a human body but these demons ask permission of the Lord that they might be able to get into the body of these swine now here's the thing a great lesson you might have want to learn about the devil right now is the Devil is a cruel Master yeah the devil's a cruel master and he destroys the temple that is given to him isn't it something amen that he immediately destroyed the life of those swine amen they ran off and killed themselves now I want you to say something realize something right now the demons that was in those those Hogs are still alive today and those demons are still here today that's why people say when you got this Holy Ghost religion you lost your mind brother B said no it's when you first time you was ever in your right mind he said because that man was crazy but the Bible says when he come to the feet of Jesus Jesus he was clothed and in his right mind amen and I'll tell you this if you ever get in contact with Jesus amen he'll put the right kind of clothes on you and he'll bring you back to your right mind that you might be able to worship God I tell you friends I believe tonight demons are powerless unless they're embodied so They begged with Mercy to go in there that Jesus would permit them a swine body because he wouldn't permit them a human body isn't that amazing Jesus wouldn't let him go get another human so they had to go get in a hog now watch that's why Paul is saying don't give place to the devil he had to ask permission of the Lord to go in there he had to ask the Lord let us go into this wine because Jesus had supreme authority over what the devil could possess and what he can't possess let me say something to you tonight deity is not in heaven that same Jesus is in the Church of the Living God every person in here that has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's in your body tonight and that whether you know it or not you have authority over where that devil goes and where he don't go you are not a weak powerless church but you are the Blood Bought Sons and Daughters of God with supreme authority and you've got a right to share the Dominion of Christ tonight to tell him where to go and where not to go and you might not have realized who you really are but if you could ever really see it Satan would become powerless before you tonight because you have a right to tell him to leave I think it's a powerful thing amen when you begin to see when you begin to see that that great logos in Jesus just said to the devil go and he went and that same logos that same Pillar of Fire is embodied in The Believer tonight as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and has authority over the devil and tells him where he can go that's why Paul would instruct you now watch what Paul's doing he's just went through being renewed in the new man he's just told you to be transformed in the new man and now he says don't give place to the devil now he's instructing you as a child of God don't you open the door to the devil because don't you give this devil power I love how he says it neither give place to the devil neither give in other words the devil can't take it you're going to have to give it do you know if the devil is in your life tonight it's because you've given him ground do you know that you had to give up some place you had to open some door to let that devil in you say brother Wayne Amen I didn't open the door unknowingly maybe you did maybe you gave some part maybe you got upset at some person now now I just have to preach the way I see things but I I'll have to say this now Caleb sitting here he he grew up in Arkansas too and he remembers want Ridge Arkansas down me and my own POA house and they got a uh uh they got a a fan sitting outside the door in the summer and it blows and you think crazy people got fans outside but but what it is is the mosquitoes are so bad there in that rice country that you could just wipe them off your I mean they're just horrid aren't they you take a breath and they just come in your mouth they're just mosquitoes are horrible amen and and I remember as long back as I got memory coming in in the summer night and hear my old Granddad or my dad or one of them holler shut the door boy yeah amen I thought my name was shut the door shut the door shut the door shut the door mystery behind it car we didn't have no air conditioners back in those days we had an old attic fan and our screens usually had two or three holes in them and amen and you know amen you had to leave that on it got so hot Nathan you couldn't cover up with a sheet amen but it was but but if the mosquitoes got in there you just have to lay there and sweat cuz you couldn't sleep without a sheet on so so but it didn't matter who you let in that door it didn't matter what reason you open the door it didn't matter amen what person was knocking and asking to come in amen I remember telling old my dad many times my grandpa many times well I'm doing so so they said I don't care shut the door because it wasn't what you were doing or not doing it's what you were letting in and you see many times in the Christian church we have forgotten that we have control of the door come on now come on Church y'all know I'm telling you the truth some of our entertainment is opened the door to a lot of anxiety in people's lives sometimes the movie theaters have caused more trouble amen because it's opened the door to certain spirits and certain situations and we're not legalist here I'm not talking about something legal I'm talking about overcoming lives I'm talking about sometimes you're fighting things that you have invited In Yourself by the type of music you've allowed on the radio by the type of magazine that you read by the type of moments books that you've looked at y'all know I'm telling you the truth I feel like a preacher right now amen you know many marriages have suffered because a sister has read some romance book and she's got an idea of what this perfect man is well let me tell you what a perfect man is he's a Son of God that works for a living loves his family he might have to be gone 12 hours a day and come in with dirt under his fingernails and he might not always be Mr prissy or in the best mood come on church but he's a man of God and he brings his family to church and he stands with his family that's the kind of man you want not some fell riding the White Horse and he never had a bad day and every everyday's roses and everyday's this that's a bunch of fantasy nonsense that has ruined many marriages well go ahead and preach preacher I think I will amen come on now now boy boy boy amen I think the Holy Ghost done showed up tonight I think it's time to shut the door to many of those situations amen and cut that devil out of your mind and out of your relationships come on now you know what I'm talking about that's the same thing some of you boys looking at them women and you see that bikini and you that Brass Body you looking at all that amen that woman never gave birth to your children she's never labored with your family amen if you ask her to stay home and clean your house she'd leave you the first day well we might as well preach Ain we amen that's why the Bible said husbands be not bitter toward your wives but love them that's why I said sister don't hold your body from your husband and close the door don't give a place to the devil don't you let your husband's Minds R around some Jezabel somewhere amen be a daughter of God and keep that man at home yeah come on well Glory somebody I'll preach like this a while Hallelujah I don't think we ought to give the devil a place tonight I think we are to shut the door in the face of the devil and tell him you're just not welcome in the house of God I believe it church I don't believe we are to give him no opportunity we are not give him no room now now I know that we've nearly made a law out of it and I don't think it ought to be a law cuz it ain't right but that's the reason we have our boys chaperoned with our young girls that's the reason these young kids don't get out and run around the car together amen or married men and and married women that ain't married together that's the reason they don't get out and run in cars and sit and talk and and look at one another in eyes you ever see it amen they just sit and talk and they bat their eyes and look at one another and eyes listen sister you got no right looking in the eyes of a married man like that amen that's her that's that's some woman's husband and that sweet little look you got belongs to your husband I'm going to preach amen amen I tell you this it belongs to your husband you ought to shut the door on that thing you ought to tell that devil amen that I am a loyal woman that's what I believe I believe that my daughters I taught them cover yourself up your body is a sacred thing and it belongs to one man and one man only that's the truth sister you know it's the truth amen I I tell you I'm going amen myself tonight that's just good preaching right [Applause] there you know it's right amen you see but you give place to the devil when you start doing that when you start when you start having those personal relationships I don't know what I'm doing here but when you start having them personal relationships with with you know you take they call them work wives now and and they call them uh work husbands now that maybe they don't have a physical relationship but it becomes so emotional and they begin emotional relationships one with the other and until they mistreat their own spouses wishing they was like some other man or like some other woman well let me tell you this I married the woman I liked and I still like her and I still love her amen and I'll shut the door on every devil I think every man of God ought to feel the same way except brother Wayne y'all never had no argument y'all never had no oh of course we have intense Fellowship that's I enjoy it I enjoy it man man I I enjoy it and and when you get to make up you get to kiss them and hug them say honey I love you amen you you you got to understand that shut the door on that Old Devil God give you a wife God give you a husband now they're not out of some magazine they're real flesh and blood and that's why you pray for them you know it's well I'll tell you what my husband he's in he's done that and he's and I'm just going to leave him man I remember when I read those Mals it said to death do we park through sickness and health through riches or poor that's why you put them things in that Val that's why you put them in there cuz hard times are going to come but amen this is not a 50/50 it's a 100 100 if you don't give a hundred and he gives a 100 you ain't going to make it it's 100% me and 100% her through riches and parts good thing we put that in there cuz she'd have left me for sure after that 14th house and we drove hey y'all come on now you see that nice car we got today somebody give to us but but y'all see that nice car come on now heyen that was a $650 car a few years ago with a a hood spray painted that girl got up and sat right next to me no air conditioner swept dripping and she was just happy to go with me it didn't take a fancy car look and and if they're looking for a fancy car young brother if they're looking for some kind of money before they ready hey forget it wrong kind of woman you want somebody got some character amen because physical traits change but you want character somebody that will love you and stay with you a good woman's a crown in a man's hair amen but a bad woman the Bible said was water in his blood I don't believe we ought to give place to the devil I believe we ought to I believe we ought to take our place amen not give him room or license not give that devil an opportunity or a set of circumstances that now I'm just reading what it means opportunity or set of circumstances a situation or condition favorable to a goal or a position or Prospect the advancement of success so so Satan wants an advancement in your life he wants to be successful yeah but you're going to have to give him the place to do it isn't that something yeah when you start thinking about it like that it'll make you shut some things off it'll make you shut the door on certain thoughts and certain feelings and and you know because Satan actually gets his success the way he does it is he explains the value of God's word away that's the way Satan gets success do you see what you have to do now remember Devils don't die amen but one day they will be totally annihilated but today they're working from generation to generation in human being some of them's in the form of cancer some of them's in the form of epileps some of them is in the form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerless until they get into a person they have to operate through a person which brings another thought that the Holy Spirit covers the earth but is helpless until it gets into you and me God is depending on you and I the Holy Spirit the Earth is full of the spirit of God it's been poured out but it cannot operate until it comes into human beings isn't that something amen that that you can bind God that's what the Bible brother bram's talking about he said when they released the Demons of re Euphrates remember brother B said Here Comes Michael and his angels and Lucifer and his angels He said they're back at War again you remember him talking about it he said the Holy Spirit has been loosed out of Creeds and dogmas after 2,000 years what's it mean loosed he's always been here but the teachings and the theologies have been an insulate rather than a conductor of the spirit of God but with the return of the seventh angel would be a restoration of the word and it would be a word of power it would put the church back in Authority again you would know you're a Son of God you would know you're a daughter of God you would know the devil's the devil but greater is he that's in me than he that's in this world hallelujah hallelujah now I know the scripture tells us that old Devil's going to be bound A Thousand Years remember that song when the Lord Returns the Earth again Satan will be bound A Thousand Years amen I I love that idea a thousand years of bondage but brother Ram said you know what's going to bind him it's not a log chain he said it's a chain of circumstances now what does that mean he says all of his subjects will be in hell and that Resurrection on Earth redeemed Jesus will be them Satan has nothing to work with during the Millennium the reason it's the Millennium is there is nobody there that Satan can work through now that's powerful Satan is Bound for a thousand years the church that's on Earth in the presence of Christ has nothing he can work on so it's not a chain as in a log chain it's a chain of circumstance he has nothing he can do he's helpless and hopeless I love to think about the devil like that helpless and hopeless waiting for a resurrection of his subjects he has nothing to work through Revelation 20 And1 I'll read the scripture for you and the angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that serpent which is the devil and he bound him a thousand years that bondage of a thousand years now watch in Revelation 20 and5 it explains it and the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished that is the first resurrection but blessed and holy somebody say blessed and holy blessed andly blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection so the first resurrection is what's going in the Millennium who's going to be in there blessed and holy who are the Blessed remember the Blessed blessed is a man whom God did not commit Mark iniquity remember blessed is that man that is called to the marriage supper of the Lamb that wears those white robes of righteousness pure and white that blessed man blessed and holy in other words the rest of the Dead don't live for a thousand years so there'll be a thousand year honeymoon on the earth with Christ as our King and there's be nothing the devil can do hallelujah what a beautiful day but let me say something to you tonight do you know it can become that way in your life now in Matthew 16 the Bible said Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give Thee the Keys of the Kingdom and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on the Earth shall be loosed in heaven you have the power tonight to bind your enemy you have the power tonight to loose your enemy you can bind the devil and you can loose him whatever you bind in heaven shall on the Earth shall be bound up in heaven can you imagine tonight you've got a power to look at the Devil and say Satan I bind you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I tell you what you ought to do is make that nervous devil nervous tonight and say thou demon of neurotics that binds you by the power of the Living God you can't keep me quiet anymore I know I'm a Son of God I know I have authority over this devil Hallelujah we ought to not set quiet we've got an authority we've got a voice we've got a right to speak tonight and tell that devil I'm a full grown man I'm a full grown son of the Living God I've got a right to speak I know who I am I know my my authority is I know you're a devil I know you're illicit and [Applause] illegal that's right you know what it means to bind it means to put under obligation of the Lord to forbid or prohibit to declare something illicit in other words when the devil starts working in your life y'all want tell you I want to tell you something he's trespassing I don't have time to teach on it you can go look it up but when the Bible calls you Christ you know that's anointed right but if you spell Christ c h r i s TS Christ many many people right all right but if you put an apostrophe s there the apostrophe changes everything everything and it speaks of possession yeah and you are Christ with an apostrophe yes you belong to him he bought you paid for you you are his property and anything that comes on that property is elicit and Satan has no rights let me say something tonight he has no legal rights upon the Church of the Living God he is trespassing in your life he is trp passing listen we have a right tonight to take that old Serpent and bind him the same way the prophet was shown that he could bind that serpent or he can loose it amen as I was with Moses yeah so am I with you can you know that he's with you tonight in a binding power and in a loosing power that within your voice you have a right to bind Satan tonight amen the never-failing presence of God is with us then right now tonight the word of God will defeat Satan in whatever form he comes in it is written we'll settle it all amen you don't have to listen to the devil tonight we're actually taught to resist him we do not have Amen to do anything we can simply turn him down walk away God said a certain thing and no matter what he's telling you you do not have to listen to him yes sir that's right I tell you friends to think tonight to see that you do not have to listen to him let me tell you what the devil's doing he's got a tactic how many knows what the tactic means it's the approach it's the way he does things and the prophet of God taught us his tactic I'm glad we had a prophet aren't you he said a tactic is to get you to disbelieve the word that's his tactic and if he can get you to disbelieve he has disarmed you and he can take his place in your life now the prophet will tell us this he said when one little ioda of God's word is disbelieved that's where all trouble comes from but if you would set your basis upon God said so he said it sets a stream between you and God and every channel comes open between you and God when you say I don't believe the word it closes the channels of you and God when you take God at his word it opens every channel can you imagine every channel is opened every channel is open to the spirit of God brother Bram said that's what it is he said see the channels get all clogged up he said but we are to take and clear them out tonight he said and when you go to do that don't take some little 22 he said get the atomic bomb of God get God's atomic bomb I love it brother BR said it'll blow sickness and Devils right out left and right it'll annihilate them discriminate against them it'll destroy everything that's ungodly when that bomb of Faith drops in there with the word of God behind it it blows out every devil every sickness every disease look don't give a place for him tonight drop a bomb on him don't give a place to that devil tonight drop a bomb on that devil blow out the sickness blow out the disease blow out the trouble allow the Holy Spirit to move in there amen amen amen you said will preach to them why does it work for some and not for others brother B said it's the channel that's why it works so well for one person don't work so good for another it's because of the channel now watch this brother ramam says it clearly he said that's why when Eve stopped and talked to the devil look at everything that come out of that talk look at how long it lasts look at how much trouble come from it just because she stopped and had one conversation with the devil isn't that amazing amen just a few minutes with the devil reasoning the word of God could cause all the trouble we see do you see the tactic of the devil in your life amen just that little bit of reasoning amen I'm sick because God don't love me I'm sick because amen God's punishing me amen look what God don't love me God God don't care about me somebody will come along and say well this brother he hates me and this sister she don't think nothing about and when that begins to happen let me tell you what's going on you begin to reason against God's word and when you do Satan comes in like a flood because you're letting him you know that's why brother B said don't stop and talk to him now it's a little rude seemingly but the prophet said don't stop and talk don't stop and reason at all remember the scripture I ain't got time to preach it but I give you the scripture Gaza take this take this staff and go lay it on the boy now don't you stop if somebody says to you hello don't you say hello back if somebody says something to you you don't stop you don't talk you don't reason you don't do nothing you take the staff and put it on the child he was under the word of God to not give place to do anything or anybody to talk to him Church listen you have been given a commission of God to speak the word and go forward don't stop and talk about it don't stop and reason about it we've got the message of the hour we don't need a second opinion or another preacher we've got the word in this season so don't stop don't stop for nothing speak the word and go forward and keep moving in the presence of God you say preacher what are you talking about tonight I'm telling you this I'm telling you that it's a Time amen that you have to cut down whatever's in the way and move on to whatever God has promised you so brother Bram said God sent a preacher to a town to hold a Revival said he got there and started cleaning it up you remember the story he said the bully the town saw him over woring that wind and come and said what are you doing he said God sent me here to have Revival he said well you're going to have to whip me before we have Revival brother Bram said he told him said well soon as I get done with this wind you're the next and brother Bram said see he was willing to do whatever it took to fulfill the commission God had gave him so he climbed out off that ladder and gave the old boy a whipping stood him up dust him off invited him to church man come got saved come on yeah CU he was ready to do whatever it was because he wouldn't be stopped and when you start toward something with God there's going to come a reasoning you may have to whip that devil there's going to come a little conflict you're going to have to speak to it right so well brother Wayne I tell you what I can listen to any music I want to it just don't bother me I can watch anything I want just don't bother me I can say anything I want just don't bother me brother B said the minute you say that the devil Devil's already got you it's the truth he said there was a girl I led to the Lord one time and her name was Nelly I believe it was said she was a real dancer said I led her to the Lord brought her down to Revival she spent hours he said it on the alar and said after a while said the Holy Spirit struck her and she shouted and screamed and the PE peace of God came down in her heart and he said oh she got she really got it he said but I was down there him one night and a drunk come to the house and he said I was trying to talk to him and heard a beating on the door way in the middle of the night said it was that girl Nelly and she was just screaming and crying he said I didn't know what the world had happened said she was saying brother Brandon brother Brandon brother BR I'm so sorry I'm so sorry he said what's the matter sister she said brother Bram I I didn't mean to do it I'm so sorry she said I'm afraid that I've I've just I've just went beyond he said sister what happened she said you remember how the Lord delivered me from that dancing and that rock and roll music he said said yeah sis I remember said well today I was coming home in the afternoon said I was walking down the street and she said I heard the music and she said I said to myself well that stuff don't bother me and said I wondered who was in there and thought it might just go over and testify a little while and brother B said there it was said you got no business on the Devil's Ground he said you ain't going to be able to help him going out there on their ground and he said she said she said brother Bram I stood there I I stood there in the door a few minutes and she Saidi got to listening to it and the next thing I knew I was out on the dance floor yeah now brother bradam shows us that a devil got owner how many knows that now do you know that a devil can't possess the soul of a Christian right but it can oppress that spirit and it had got on that spirit and you know what that Prophet said he said I did didn't know a lot about it but I had read it in the Bible and he said I reached over and laid my hand on that woman and he said I said Mr devil I don't know what your name is but you got to come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ he said there was a like a black bat flew out of her he said went by that drunk guy scared him to death you know amen but it went right out of there and the prophet showed now that what she had done was she had given the devil a place in her life yeah but he told us that story for a reason come on now he let us know as Christians amen that we don't step on the Devil's Ground we don't give the devil a place and if we do and we get subject to it there's a remedy tonight amen that we can that we can come back to the house of God and say you know what I did I did this and I said this amen and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and drive that thing off in you don't you give place to the devil don't you give a ride to the devil you said brother Wayne I tell you what I think I packed the devil well I tell you what tell him to get his own ride home tonight tell him you might have come to church with me but you ain't leaving with me you might have lived in the house with me but you ain't living no more I'm going to push you out of it don't give a place to the devil amen won't you to stand to your feet with us tonight don't you give a place to the devil don't you give a place to the devil can our musicians come am man y'all know I ain't quite done but but we we'll get to it Sunday right don't you give a place to the devil so brother Wayne it make me not a Christian well you know that's a big that's a big theological discussion but thank God we got a prophet yeah amen some people would have you to believe that if you ever had a little bible like that that you just must never got anything but that wasn't what the prophet said at all don't you give a place to the devil don't you let that devil convince you that you didn't have an experience with God what you better do is stand toe to- Toe with that devil and say I know I met him I know he was there I know he changed my life now Mr devil I might have flirted with you and got myself in trouble but I'm not going to live the rest of my life under your power don't give a place to that devil tonight don't you give a place to him I belong to the Lord Jesus that's right and you
