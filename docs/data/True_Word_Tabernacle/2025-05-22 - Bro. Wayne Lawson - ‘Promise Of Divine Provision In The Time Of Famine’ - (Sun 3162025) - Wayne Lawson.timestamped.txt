[3:51] [Music]
[3:57] all Amen. God bless you this morning.
[4:01] And it's certainly good to be in the
[4:03] house of the Lord on a Sunday morning.
[4:05] It's beautiful resurrection day. Amen.
[4:07] And to see everyone that could gather in
[4:09] today in his presence and Amen. It's
[4:12] certainly great honor and it's such a
[4:14] grace to be here today. We're some
[4:17] things in the word of the Lord. We just
[4:18] like to bow our hearts this morning.
[4:21] Father, we thank you today for your
[4:23] grace upon us and the blessing upon the
[4:25] church. Lord, we ask you today that your
[4:28] great spirit would just come among us,
[4:30] Lord, as you are such an awesome God,
[4:33] such a blessing, Lord, to worship you
[4:36] and serve you with your children. Now
[4:39] today, Father, we pray that you would
[4:40] help us and Lord, as we endeavor to
[4:43] speak your word, I pray that you would
[4:45] just come here in the midst of the
[4:46] church, Lord, and that your anointing
[4:49] would pick these things up, Lord, and
[4:51] they'd be more than just words, but may
[4:54] they be food to the soul, Lord. We're
[4:56] asking you now to lead us and to guide
[4:59] us into these things. Send your
[5:01] anointing to tie it together, Lord. And
[5:03] we give you this service today, Lord,
[5:06] for your children. We pray in Jesus'
[5:08] name. Amen. And amen. And God bless you
[5:13] today. If you have your Bibles, we'd
[5:15] like to go into the word of the Lord.
[5:16] Amen. We'll look in the book of
[5:18] Revelations, the 10th chapter, verses 7
[5:20] to 11. Also, verses uh Matthew chapter 4
[5:24] and verse 4. Amen. We want to look here
[5:27] at Revelation 10. And I want to read in
[5:30] the seventh verse. Of course, this whole
[5:32] chapter, you all know, is the seventh
[5:34] seal, right? And it's broke and the
[5:37] chapter is broken into three pieces.
[5:39] It's broken to the angel to the seventh
[5:41] angel and then John eaten the book. And
[5:44] so of course you can see that three runs
[5:47] all the way through seventh seal,
[5:49] rapture, adoption. It's always three.
[5:52] But in the days of the voice of the
[5:54] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[5:56] sound, the mystery of God should be
[5:59] finished as
[6:01] declared to his servants, the prophets.
[6:05] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[6:07] spake unto me again and said, "Go and
[6:09] take the little book which is opened in
[6:11] the hand of the angel." Now, we've spent
[6:14] some time a couple years ago on that.
[6:16] And I just want to mention it. I'm not
[6:18] going to prove it this morning. I just
[6:19] want to mention it. That go and take the
[6:21] little book. Now, that of course y'all
[6:23] know that's the revelation. Brother
[6:25] Brandham was saying we don't need a new
[6:27] Bible or a new book. We just need the
[6:30] Bible to become new. We need a
[6:32] revelation. And of course that's what
[6:34] was being held was the revelation. So he
[6:36] came and take the little book which is
[6:37] open in the hand of the angel which
[6:39] standeth upon the sea and upon the
[6:41] earth. Amen. And I went unto the angel
[6:45] and said unto him, give me the little
[6:48] book. And he said unto me, take it and
[6:52] eat it. Now isn't this this is a huge
[6:54] difference from Revelations 5 when no
[6:57] man could touch it, no man could look at
[6:59] it. Now he's being given it that he
[7:02] might eat it. Take it and eat it up and
[7:04] it shall make uh he take it, eat it up.
[7:07] It shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[7:10] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[7:13] And I took the little book out of the
[7:15] angel's hand and ate it up. There's
[7:18] prophecy of the bride. She took it and
[7:21] began to eat it. And it was in thy mouth
[7:24] sweet as honey. And as soon as I'd eaten
[7:26] it, my belly was bitter. and he said
[7:28] unto me, "Thou must prophesy again
[7:32] before many peoples, nations, tongues,
[7:34] and kings." Amen. Let's also look in
[7:37] Matthew 4 and verse
[7:40] four. This is Jesus uh speaking, of
[7:44] course, there was a great temptation
[7:45] happening at this moment.
[7:48] And Jesus was speaking, of course, to
[7:51] the devil because the devil was saying
[7:52] to him, "If thou be the son of God, you
[7:55] can make this stone into
[7:57] bread." And brother Brandham said,
[7:59] "Jesus didn't make bread for the
[8:02] devil." Amen. But now later, but later
[8:06] he fed 5,000 bread. So he proved he
[8:09] could do it, but he wouldn't do it for
[8:10] the devil. Ain't going I ain't clowning
[8:13] for no devil. He said, "But he answered
[8:16] and said, it is
[8:18] written, man shall not live by bread
[8:21] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[8:25] out of the mouth of God." May the Lord
[8:28] bless his word this morning. You could
[8:29] be
[8:30] seated. I want to continue this morning
[8:33] speaking on the opening of the word.
[8:35] Amen. We certainly appreciate those
[8:37] songs this morning. And Amen. I I I
[8:40] certainly very much appreciate that. to
[8:43] speak the word, Lord. My ears long to
[8:46] hear it. That's that's exactly uh I
[8:49] believe where the bride's call is today.
[8:50] What's really on her heart is that word.
[8:53] Amen. That's the season of it. I want to
[8:55] speak to you today on this of course
[8:57] another portion of this opening of the
[8:59] word. And I want to look at this uh of
[9:02] course the promise of divine provision
[9:04] in time of famine. The promise of divine
[9:08] provision in the time of famine. Uh, of
[9:11] course, uh, I have been, uh, uh, working
[9:14] back and forth through this book called
[9:15] Spiritual Food in Due Season. If you
[9:17] ain't listened to it lately, my, it's a
[9:20] tremendous read. Uh, it's the 1965, and
[9:23] you'll find Brother Brandham uh,
[9:25] actually uh, before he begins it, he
[9:28] speaks to uh, he speaks to the
[9:30] congregation. He reads this, of course,
[9:32] out of the book of Kings, but his his
[9:33] concept or his thought of course is
[9:36] Elijah. Amen. And I always love it when
[9:38] brother Brown preaches on Elijah because
[9:40] I know what he's talking about. I know I
[9:42] know he's identifying himself in the
[9:45] scriptures. Amen. And then he takes
[9:47] somebody else and then brings them in
[9:49] with him. Amen. And um the scriptures,
[9:52] amen, back in the book of Kings, of
[9:54] course, tells us about a time when
[9:55] Elijah came to the earth that it was a
[9:58] time during Ahab's rule. And of course,
[10:01] it was a time uh when the devil was just
[10:04] running loose. The Bible tells us that
[10:06] people were worshiping the God of Baal
[10:07] more than Jehovah. The name of the Lord
[10:10] basically had been lost. There was so
[10:12] much confusion in the land and and they
[10:14] had turned unto idols and they were
[10:16] worshiping every which way. And it was
[10:18] in that season that God brought a man
[10:20] who was not a part of their
[10:22] denominations, not coming from their
[10:24] schools, but he basically come out of
[10:27] nowhere for the purpose to prophesy
[10:29] against it. Amen. Amen. So when the
[10:32] Bible tells us that he prophesied
[10:34] against it, that the first thing that he
[10:36] did is he shut up the heavens. I've
[10:37] always loved the story of how Elijah
[10:40] went directly to Ahab. Amen. How in the
[10:42] world? It was a miracle in itself he'd
[10:44] walk directly to a leader like that.
[10:46] Amen. But he prophesied to him that the
[10:49] heavens would be shut up until he asked
[10:51] for it to rain. Can you imagine what
[10:53] that king thought? Who are you? And and
[10:55] and and what do you think you're doing?
[10:57] And how can you bring this upon our
[10:59] nation? And you know, he he must have
[11:02] been thinking many things, but it was
[11:04] the same anyhow. Amen. Because Elijah
[11:07] had the authority from God. Amen. Amen.
[11:10] The God that Ahab had forgot about.
[11:13] The God that Ahab had decided that
[11:15] really wasn't God. Elijah let him know.
[11:18] I going to speak for him so that you
[11:20] know that not even do will fall from the
[11:23] heavens until I ask for it. Now, now
[11:26] I'll tell you when God began to use this
[11:28] Elijah to bring judgment, I'll just read
[11:30] here in first Kings. Amen. If you read
[11:33] the 17th chapter, the whole chapter of
[11:35] sports deals with this several verses
[11:37] down to about the 16th is when the when
[11:39] the heavens were shut up, God turns unto
[11:42] Elijah, amen, and begins to tell Elijah,
[11:45] you go down to the brook Cherith, and
[11:47] and when you get there, I have called
[11:49] that the ravens will feed you there.
[11:51] Amen. And and so God sending down there
[11:53] that he might have a place of provision
[11:57] during the time that the heavens were
[11:59] shut up because judgments was about to
[12:01] fall on the whole nation. Amen. And the
[12:03] scriptures tells us that whenever the
[12:06] brook begin to dry up that God had a
[12:08] place for him. See, God was showing that
[12:11] the time of judgment is going to bring a
[12:14] hardship. It's going to bring a a a
[12:16] famine upon the land. It'll bring a time
[12:19] when there won't be provision
[12:20] everywhere. But God never let his
[12:23] servants suffer. Amen. He always had a
[12:26] place for him to go, a place that would
[12:29] be provision, a a place of food in the
[12:32] time of this. And I'll I'll just read
[12:34] quickly here in verse 17 uh first Kings
[12:37] 17 8 down to 16. If you want to read
[12:40] with me, it's a beautiful reading. When
[12:42] the brook cheriff dried, the word of the
[12:44] Lord came unto him, saying, Arise and
[12:47] get thee to Sarapath, which belongth to
[12:49] Zidon, and dwelt there. Behold, I've
[12:51] commanded a widow woman to feed uh to
[12:54] sustain thee there. Amen. So he arose
[12:58] and went to Zerapath. And when he came
[13:00] to the gate of the city, behold, the
[13:02] widow woman was there gathering sticks.
[13:05] Brother Bam said two sticks making a
[13:08] cross. And he called her there and said,
[13:10] "Fetch me, I pray, a little water in a
[13:13] vessel that I may drink." And she was
[13:16] going to fetch it. And he called to her
[13:18] and said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a
[13:20] morsel of bread in thine hand." And she
[13:23] said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I
[13:26] will have not a cake, but a handful of
[13:30] meal in a barrel and a little oil in the
[13:32] cruise, and behold, I am gathering two
[13:34] sticks." There it is. That's why he said
[13:36] it. and I may go in and dress it for me
[13:39] and my son, and we may eat it and die."
[13:43] And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go
[13:45] and do as thou hast said, but make me
[13:48] thereof a little cake first, and bring
[13:50] it unto me, and after make me for thy
[13:53] son." Now, for thus saith the Lord God
[13:57] of Israel, oh, those are the best words
[13:59] that that woman ever heard.
[14:02] For thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
[14:05] the barrel of meal shall not waste, and
[14:08] neither shall the crucible fail until
[14:10] the day the Lord send it rain upon the
[14:13] earth. So she went and did according to
[14:16] the saying of Elijah. And she and he and
[14:18] her house did eat many days. And the
[14:21] barrel of meal wasted not, neither did
[14:24] the crucible fail according to the word
[14:27] of the Lord which he spake by Elijah.
[14:31] Isn't that amazing? The whole house was
[14:33] sustained. Amen. Because Elijah was
[14:36] accepted among them. The whole place
[14:38] lived. Amen. When he came, Amen. It was
[14:41] it was it was all uh just about over.
[14:43] Amen. It was right in the ending of that
[14:46] Pentecostal age. and and they had just
[14:48] about run out. Amen. But God sent a
[14:51] messenger just in time. Amen. That if
[14:54] they would honor that Elijah among them,
[14:56] Amen. they would move right on to
[14:58] another revival and that revival would
[15:00] end in the changing of the body. Do you
[15:03] see the the type brother making
[15:05] spiritual food is he'll say this, I'm
[15:07] going to type Elijah with the church
[15:10] today. Just before judgment, he received
[15:12] this message. And Elijah represented
[15:15] being cared for in the natural, his
[15:17] natural food, because it wasn't going to
[15:19] rain. Now, according to the word, for 3
[15:22] years and 6 months or until Elijah
[15:24] called. Now, whatever time you say
[15:26] Elijah, it'll be. Therefore, he walked
[15:28] up to the king and said, "There'll not
[15:30] even be duefall." He said, "That's quite
[15:32] a load, isn't it? That's quite a
[15:34] message." Amen. And we're going to type
[15:37] that with the spiritual drought of
[15:39] today.
[15:41] We are very aware there is a great
[15:43] spiritual drought in the land today
[15:46] spiritually speaking. Amen. And it was
[15:49] predicted by the prophets just before
[15:51] the second coming of Christ that there
[15:53] would come a famine in the land. And it
[15:55] won't be for bread alone, but for the
[15:58] hearing of the word of God. And that day
[16:02] is now. Now, here's a prophet taking two
[16:06] places in scripture and showing you a
[16:08] drought in the days of Elijah, which
[16:11] represented that there was no food to
[16:13] eat. And then he went to the book of
[16:15] Amos and pulled down a famine that's
[16:17] going to come for the hearing of the
[16:18] word of God. And he ties these two
[16:21] together and says, "That day is now."
[16:24] Amen. And when he does it, what he's
[16:26] doing is he's placing you in the
[16:28] scripture. Amen. The hearing of the true
[16:30] word of God. Now this type's a natural
[16:32] drought with a spiritual sea. Sin and
[16:35] unbelief by false teachers and
[16:38] modernists in the church had brought
[16:40] this to this place coming and oncoming
[16:43] judgment. Now what causes the famine?
[16:45] Amen. Is sin and unbelief. It's by false
[16:49] teachers and modernist in the church.
[16:52] Isn't that something? Amen. Amen. You
[16:54] you know uh uh I don't know how to say
[16:56] it any other way than Amen. that that
[16:58] men begin to get their own ideas and
[17:01] they begin to share with people things
[17:03] that wasn't thus sayaith the Lord and
[17:05] and things that they picked up here and
[17:07] learned there and somewhere else and and
[17:09] begin to distribute that among the
[17:11] people until it begin to produce amen
[17:14] drought, a famine, a spiritual drying
[17:17] up. Amen. In spiritual food and season.
[17:19] Brother Bam said it like this. He said
[17:21] Elijah during this time had a secret
[17:24] place that God had ordained him to go.
[17:27] That's the thing we want to see now is
[17:29] just before the prayer line is Elijah
[17:31] had a secret place provided by God
[17:34] himself. Now the church had never
[17:36] provided that. The king never provided
[17:39] it for him. He didn't provide it for
[17:41] himself. But God provided a secret place
[17:45] for Elijah to be fed all the time during
[17:48] the drought where the food was provided
[17:50] for day by day. Brother Bam's taken this
[17:53] entire thing to prove to you he will not
[17:56] leave his church in drought. He said,
[17:58] "When have you seen when have you seen
[18:00] the righteous forsaken?" And when have
[18:03] you seen them have to beg for bread?
[18:05] Amen. But if you go to the place God
[18:07] provided, Amen. There's a barrel full of
[18:09] bill. There's a curse full, a cruise
[18:11] full of oil. Amen. There is a famine in
[18:14] the land, but there is provision in the
[18:16] places where God has provided in that
[18:19] generation. Amen. God, Amen. is the one
[18:22] that provides it.
[18:24] I'm so glad to know he makes provision.
[18:26] Amen. Now, I want you to look at this in
[18:28] Amos the 8th chapter. We'll read two
[18:30] verses, 11 and verse 12. And behold, the
[18:33] days come, saith the Lord God, that I
[18:35] will send a famine in the land, not a
[18:37] famine of bread, nor a thirst of water,
[18:40] but the hearing of the word of the Lord.
[18:43] So the hearing of the word, Amen, the
[18:45] eating of the word is also considered
[18:48] like a man eating natural bread. Because
[18:51] back in the Old Testament, what they
[18:52] called a famine was when there was
[18:54] nothing to eat. And he's telling them,
[18:56] "Oh, you'll have plenty of bread, but
[18:58] it'll be the word of God that's going to
[19:00] be hard. It's it's going to be the thing
[19:02] that's not going to be coming." And he
[19:04] says, "And they shall wander from sea to
[19:06] sea and from north to east, and they
[19:08] shall run to and fro and to seek the
[19:10] word, but they shall not find it." There
[19:14] it is. Amen. Now, it's laying in
[19:15] prophecy. And I'll tell you this, you
[19:17] can't get around prophecy. Famine is
[19:20] coming. People's going to look
[19:22] everywhere for it, but they're not going
[19:24] to find it. Why won't they find it?
[19:27] Because it's a secret place. Amen. It's
[19:29] a hidden place. There'll be food in that
[19:32] day. There'll be provision for God's
[19:34] children, but it'll be food that's been
[19:36] hidden in a secret place. And and you'll
[19:39] not have it unless you're willing to go
[19:41] into that place. Amen. I say this. Amen.
[19:44] No wonder that prophet, Amen, seen that
[19:46] tent vision and he seen three different
[19:48] levels. He saw a congregation. He saw
[19:51] the ministry. But then he saw a little
[19:53] room. Amen. And in there is where he
[19:55] said he would meet him. Watch that
[19:57] tabernacle in the wilderness. There was
[19:58] a congregation. There was a holy place.
[20:01] And there's a holies of holies. And
[20:03] every one of them places had bread, did
[20:05] they not? They had bread in the
[20:06] congregation, the mana that fell. Then
[20:09] they had the showbread that was in the
[20:11] holy place. But then in that holies of
[20:13] holies, Moses was told, "Go take you a
[20:16] golden offer and fill it with the mana
[20:19] that falls and take it back in the
[20:22] secret place. So that when the mana is
[20:24] no more, there'll be a place you can
[20:27] find that it'll be an unending mana. It
[20:30] was from generation to generation. But
[20:33] there's a place where you can be fed in
[20:35] the middle of the time when there's food
[20:37] nowhere else. You say, "Preacher,
[20:39] where's that place?" It's in Christ.
[20:41] Amen. That place is in Christ. And this
[20:44] Bible took in Christ will always feed
[20:47] the church of the living God. My
[20:50] goodness. I'm so glad this morning,
[20:52] Amen, that in a time of famine, we've
[20:54] got storehouses that are full.
[20:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Am I about to
[21:00] have me a a shouting time this week
[21:01] studying this? Amen. And and and you
[21:03] know the thing about historians is some
[21:05] of them go one way and some go the
[21:07] other. So I usually pick the ones I
[21:10] like. Ones that goes with brother
[21:12] Brandham. Them smart historians, you
[21:14] know. Amen. They got history on
[21:16] everything. Amen. But when you start
[21:18] studying famines, Amen. Nobody studied
[21:20] famines until you you you always go back
[21:23] to Joseph in the Bible. Amen. When
[21:26] Joseph in Genesis 49, Amen. you of
[21:28] course uh Genesis 4 that there's about
[21:31] several chapters there in Genesis. Amen.
[21:33] That is the story of Joseph. Amen. And
[21:35] isn't it amazing that God put that many
[21:38] chapters in the Bible about one man? But
[21:40] you know the entire existence of the
[21:43] seed line of Judah rested on that one
[21:46] situation in Bible. There wouldn't have
[21:48] been a furtherment of the story
[21:51] throughout the Bible unless there would
[21:52] have been a Joseph back there. Amen.
[21:55] That God took a hold of. And I tell you,
[21:56] it's amazing cuz everybody thinks
[21:58] Joseph's being mistreated. But God's
[22:00] putting Joseph over in Egypt because
[22:02] there's about to come a famine in the
[22:04] land, but he puts Joseph before the
[22:07] famine falls because he's going to have
[22:09] a place. Amen. Where food is going to be
[22:11] starred for the church of the living
[22:13] God. That's why he wasn't mad at his
[22:16] brethren. And he said, "God did this
[22:18] that you might preserve life. If God
[22:20] before us, who can be against us? Satan
[22:22] would do something." Amen. Look at the
[22:24] pressure they put on brother Brandham.
[22:26] But thank God they did it. Had they not
[22:28] put the pressure on brother Brandham, he
[22:30] wouldn't have he would have stayed right
[22:32] among them and he still would have been
[22:34] preaching them sermons. But when God had
[22:36] him kicked out of everything and look at
[22:39] them seals coming in. Look at that word
[22:41] being packed in. You know something I
[22:43] found out? You know there's a lot of
[22:45] pyramids that are in Egypt and and one
[22:47] of them he not built right. He built the
[22:48] pyramid and all them other pyramids I've
[22:50] always wondered about. Do you know
[22:52] there's a lot of historians believe that
[22:54] them pyramids were built by Joseph for
[22:56] the sake of storing grain?
[22:59] It's it's all over history. They really
[23:02] believe that they were pyramids built
[23:04] for grain storage. And when the famine
[23:06] was over, then the kings begin to use
[23:08] them for their for their uh burial
[23:10] places, but they believe long before the
[23:12] burial, they were used for hiding the
[23:14] seed or and you know, you can take it or
[23:16] leave it. I don't care. Don't really
[23:17] matter. But I thought it was pretty
[23:19] good. You get that seed in that pyramid
[23:21] and you you you got a place now you can
[23:23] eat. Amen. In the times. That's why
[23:26] brother Brandham if you if you study
[23:27] brother Brandham he actually says a
[23:29] Germanized seed he said would last for
[23:31] ages. He said see a germitized seed
[23:34] would last for ages. That's why he said
[23:36] they found a corn in the days of Joseph
[23:39] and they planted it the other day and it
[23:41] lived and produced because it was a
[23:43] germatized seed. You can store a
[23:46] germatized seed. This message is not a
[23:49] dead letter. It's the germatized seed of
[23:52] the living God. And if you take it,
[23:54] it'll eat it. You'll have something on
[23:56] the inside of you. This ain't a bunch of
[23:58] hybridized seeds. This ain't a bunch of
[24:01] dead seeds. This is a germatized lie
[24:04] field.
[24:06] That's what's the matter with the world
[24:07] today is the diet. This hybrid diet.
[24:09] Brother said they're smarter but weaker.
[24:13] What's wrong with the church? Smarter
[24:14] but weaker. He said they can't take a
[24:17] good oldfashioned gospel message no
[24:18] more. Not talking about this church.
[24:20] Amen. You folks can take
[24:22] me. Amen. But you know, he said it's
[24:24] what happens to them. They can't take
[24:26] correction. Hot hell's plants, they they
[24:28] they just melt under any kind of a a
[24:31] hardness or strength. He said they're
[24:32] getting weaker and weaker and weaker.
[24:34] But not a real gospel Christian. They
[24:36] eat on that germmitized word of God. And
[24:39] they get strength where they can stand
[24:41] the battle and the heat of the problems
[24:43] of the ages.
[24:45] Of course. Amen. Of course, Joseph
[24:48] stored that food by divine vision of
[24:51] God.
[24:52] Remember the seven fat cows got eaten by
[24:55] the seven lean ones and the seven
[24:58] healthy corn got eaten by the lean ones.
[25:00] And and that's when he found out that
[25:04] amen that God knows how to lift a man in
[25:06] a kingdom. And God had a mystery to lift
[25:10] Joseph above his brethren to bring him
[25:14] out of the jail. It was the mystery did
[25:15] that. God put a mystery on Joseph that
[25:19] he couldn't solve and nobody else could.
[25:21] So there was only one man. So they
[25:22] brought him out of the jail and put him
[25:24] on the throne. And that's exactly amen.
[25:27] When you really try to solve the
[25:29] mysteries of this book, Amen. you'll
[25:31] find out that it'll exalt William
[25:32] Brandom as the seventh angel of the
[25:34] church, too. And you'll find out what
[25:37] they can't answer. God has gave an
[25:38] answer in this age. And it's not a good
[25:41] guess.
[25:42] [Applause]
[25:43] And it's not a good shot in the dark.
[25:46] It's a thus sayaith the Lord. That's
[25:49] that's where it's at. But you can't get
[25:51] thus sayith the Lord till you give up
[25:52] what you got. We learned that with that
[25:54] widow and Zarapath, which was a gentile
[25:57] woman who come under Elijah's ministry
[25:59] during the time of judgment, just like
[26:01] you did. But it was what she had she had
[26:04] to give. until she could receive what
[26:06] wouldn't run out. And you got to give up
[26:08] your idea of what you have and then you
[26:11] can receive something that won't run
[26:13] out. Amen. The reason people run out of
[26:15] things is because they get to doubting
[26:17] the message. That's right. Long as you
[26:20] don't doubt it, it'll feed you every
[26:22] day. That's right. Put a little doubt
[26:24] with it and all of a sudden you say,
[26:25] "Well, I don't know. I don't have any
[26:27] food and I feel like we're starving to
[26:28] death." Put a little doubt with it and
[26:30] you can starve a church to death. That's
[26:32] right.
[26:33] Get a preacher get a little doubt of
[26:34] this message and he'll water it down and
[26:36] he can't preach the authority cuz he's
[26:38] afraid somebody might leave. Listen,
[26:40] eagles don't leave this message.
[26:43] Amen. And the and the stronger you
[26:45] preach it, the more the eagles will
[26:47] gather into it. And for Amen. Listen,
[26:50] it's said here, Amen. that there's some
[26:52] that they will never find because of the
[26:54] way they look. But if you're looking for
[26:56] what God has provided,
[27:00] right? I um I I amazing hear how the
[27:03] scripture says that it's a a a famine
[27:06] for the hearing of the word of God.
[27:09] Yeah. In the Greek or in the Hebrew
[27:12] actually in this one, it's the Hebrew
[27:14] shama which means to hear to listen. It
[27:17] extends beyond the mere act of hearing
[27:19] to include understanding.
[27:22] In other words, responding appropriately
[27:24] to
[27:25] In other words, people might hear the
[27:27] message, they might hear the word, but
[27:30] it's not mixed with understanding.
[27:33] So, it's as a as if there is no food.
[27:36] Yeah.
[27:38] Because God did send a message in this
[27:40] age. And people are in the presence of
[27:43] the greatest wealth. But back there when
[27:46] they came to Egypt, and remember if you
[27:48] if you read the history of it lately,
[27:50] when they came to Egypt and they said to
[27:52] Pharaoh, "We're starving." And he said,
[27:53] "Go see Joseph." Yeah. Go see Joseph.
[27:56] Because Joseph was over the greeneries.
[27:59] And we find out that's exactly what God
[28:02] done with this message. So he said,
[28:03] "Well, brother Wayne, I need spiritual
[28:05] life. I need a revival. Go see the
[28:07] message." It holds the keys to these
[28:10] things. Do you see what we find then is
[28:13] that the the the idea of that famine
[28:17] will come in the last days. Brother
[28:19] Random ties it exactly to this age.
[28:22] knowing he was Elijah and it represented
[28:25] the famine in those days. Amen. So we
[28:28] see then we we can we can we can pull up
[28:31] here where the Bible said there's four
[28:32] horse riders riding and now these things
[28:35] all tie together. So there's four
[28:37] there's four horse riders riding and
[28:39] y'all remember how there was a wide and
[28:41] then there's the red and then there's
[28:42] the black but then there's that pale
[28:44] one. Now that pale one is a mixing up of
[28:47] things, right? And what is that but a
[28:50] confusion to the people? Amen. Now, now
[28:53] it's amazing because the pale horse
[28:56] broad is his path of destruction. In
[28:59] other words, Amen. Some people will be
[29:02] destroyed on the path of of of of
[29:05] atheism, some on agnostics, some through
[29:08] a Baptist or a Presbyterian idea of
[29:11] something or or even but where it really
[29:14] comes down is is in the Pentecostal
[29:16] ranks where Amen. And and then I hate to
[29:19] say it, but it even gets closer in a
[29:22] perversion of your own message.
[29:25] Amen. And and what we found is is this.
[29:27] Amen. Is that confusion taking the
[29:30] things of God and confusing the people
[29:33] where you have to listen to me. See, you
[29:37] you you you can't go get the message and
[29:39] and read it and believe it. Amen. You
[29:42] got to have my version of it. See, you
[29:44] you got to you got to come under me. You
[29:46] got to you got to hear what I think
[29:48] about that message. What I think about
[29:51] Listen, I don't care what anybody thinks
[29:52] about that. If you got your own tapes,
[29:55] you got your own messages, sit down in
[29:57] the quietness of your home and you
[29:59] believe what that prophet said. And if I
[30:01] or any other preacher says something
[30:03] different, forget it. Just forget it.
[30:06] Amen. Amen. We We have come to believe a
[30:09] word and that word is higher than Wayne.
[30:12] It's It's higher than the ministries.
[30:15] Amen. It's a message that's come from
[30:17] God to deliver this church and to bring
[30:20] food in the time of seasons.
[30:23] I'm very weary of a man that starts
[30:25] telling you you've got to see him before
[30:27] you can understand it.
[30:29] Cuz I know who took me through the
[30:31] message. I remember where I learned
[30:34] about these things. It was in the
[30:35] quietness of my room and me and that
[30:38] angel walked through these things and he
[30:40] said, "This ties to this and this ties
[30:42] to this and this ties to this." And I
[30:44] could sit in a quiet room with a little
[30:46] book and come out with a belly full.
[30:48] Amen. A belly full of word. Amen.
[30:50] Because there's something in here that's
[30:53] good if you deem it food for your age.
[30:57] But that pale horse is coming to confuse
[30:59] the people. Now, Brother Brandon will
[31:01] teach us this. This is the most
[31:02] confusing of ages. It gets so deceptive.
[31:05] People will believe a lie
[31:09] and be damned by the lie they believe.
[31:10] It's so deceptive. The Bible said they
[31:12] would worship the Antichrist believing
[31:15] they're worshiping God. It would deceive
[31:18] the elected.
[31:21] If
[31:23] possible,
[31:25] well, I like that. That right there,
[31:28] that's the time I like an if.
[31:31] Brother Ram said, "But it's not
[31:34] because the word elect stands for the
[31:36] word election."
[31:37] And when God elected you, he put your
[31:40] name on the Lamb's book of life. And the
[31:43] Bible said everybody who was on that
[31:46] book would not be deceived. Amen. That's
[31:49] why this message is opened up. It called
[31:51] your name. Supper time.
[31:55] Come on in and eat, honey.
[31:58] This is your word. It's your age. Pale
[32:00] horse, of course, speaks of confusion,
[32:02] of time of delusion. Amen. It's a time
[32:05] when the enemy comes in like a flood of
[32:08] confusion. But God raises a standard
[32:10] against that enemy. And the standard we
[32:13] know of the age is the eagle. It is
[32:16] revelation.
[32:18] How do we really combat confusion?
[32:21] Revelation.
[32:22] Amen. I I just the other day uh uh
[32:24] sister uh yeah, sister Carara came to me
[32:28] just the other day and she she said she
[32:29] had heard that quote years ago on uh the
[32:32] anointing where uh uh
[32:35] supreme power is anointing under control
[32:37] and and and I don't want to get uh uh
[32:39] but sometimes you know we have our youth
[32:41] camps and stuff people shoots at us and
[32:43] stuff and God bless them we'll pray for
[32:45] them. Brother Bham said, "Pray for
[32:46] them." You know what? Whatever. Maybe
[32:48] they wasn't there and didn't understand
[32:49] or something, but they get to throwing
[32:51] stuff at us and sometimes it's
[32:52] confusing. But uh um Sister Car was
[32:55] telling me, she said somebody used that
[32:57] quote where uh supreme power under
[32:59] control the anointing and said they were
[33:01] using it really to come against somebody
[33:03] worshiping in the spirit. And she said
[33:05] the other Sunday, Brother Ericson came
[33:07] up here and said he began to read that
[33:10] same quote. said, "But when he began to
[33:13] read it, there was such a liberty come
[33:15] over my life because there was an
[33:17] understanding in behind it." Amen. That
[33:19] it didn't have nothing to do with
[33:21] worship. It had everything to do with
[33:23] God having control. Amen. It It's God
[33:26] having control. It's just not man-made
[33:28] religion. It's not man-made worship.
[33:30] Amen. Brother Brandham isn't again
[33:32] worship. He was again man-made worship.
[33:35] Amen. Amen. And you Oh my Amen. And we
[33:38] take this message and take the confusion
[33:40] out of it. I guarantee you'd find
[33:42] there's liberty behind it, there's truth
[33:45] behind it, there's worship behind it,
[33:47] there's life behind it. Yes, sir. You
[33:51] You want to take away You want to take
[33:52] away the bondage, let revelation come.
[33:55] Let God reveal to you why it was put in
[33:58] there.
[34:00] When that revelation strikes, it'll give
[34:02] you liberty like you've never
[34:04] experienced. Amen. It'll be there.
[34:06] Somebody said, "Well, I don't know if
[34:07] the message is right." Brother Bam said,
[34:08] "Come up here." He said, "And the one
[34:10] that was in Daniel's kingdom is in the
[34:12] kingdom tonight." And he'll dissolve
[34:14] every doubt. If you take this message to
[34:17] the spirit of God and begin to pray,
[34:18] he'll dissolve every doubt, won't he,
[34:20] brother Matt? He'll teach you that this
[34:22] message is the manifested word of God in
[34:24] the age we're living in. Amen. Do you
[34:27] see? Brother Bam says it like this. Now,
[34:28] the reason I'm tying these two together,
[34:30] I want you to see it in the quote
[34:31] curtain of time. Brother Bam said, "A
[34:33] man won't know what to believe." See, we
[34:36] don't need bread. Got plenty of it. We
[34:38] got plenty to eat, plenty of clothes to
[34:39] wear, nice homes to live in, everything.
[34:41] But there's a famine for the hearing of
[34:44] the word of God. A man won't know what
[34:46] to believe. Do you see the famine? A man
[34:48] won't know what to believe. That's the
[34:51] famine of the age. There's a lot of
[34:54] preachers. There's a lot of churches.
[34:56] There's a lot of preaching. But we don't
[34:58] know what to believe. That's the famine.
[35:00] Amen. Brother Bram says, "See, that's
[35:02] it. you're confused because one says
[35:05] this and one says that and one says
[35:08] something else. He said, "Well, then
[35:10] base your thought on thus saith the
[35:13] Lord." So, so, so to dissipate
[35:16] confusion, go back to the message and
[35:19] see what the prophet said about it.
[35:22] Amen. When you do that, confusion begins
[35:25] to leave. Amen. Because the eagle is
[35:27] there to lift the standard. Brother Bam
[35:30] says that this prophet Amos foresaw the
[35:32] United States of America because it's
[35:34] the only place I know of that would meet
[35:36] the kind of description of that in this
[35:38] day. Amen. And why are people so tossed
[35:42] about? Y'all know that's the message,
[35:43] the intervail, right? Why are people so
[35:46] tossed about the inner veil? The reason
[35:47] that's important to y'all is that's the
[35:50] the the the message that Brother Bram
[35:52] teaches the third pull from was why are
[35:55] people so you hear that title? Why are
[35:58] people so tossed about?
[36:02] Because they're not in the inner veil.
[36:05] That's what he's teaching here. They're
[36:07] tossed about because they're not meeting
[36:10] in that little room. That's right.
[36:11] They're out there in the congregation.
[36:13] What do y'all think about this? How do
[36:14] y'all feel about this? They're up there
[36:16] with the ministry. What do you think
[36:17] about this? But back there in that
[36:19] little room is just the word and the
[36:21] pillar of fire and the believer. Amen.
[36:24] And when he begins to reveal to you, he
[36:27] brings a personal experience into your
[36:30] life that you can't shake it. Amen. God
[36:32] can take you to a place and reveal this
[36:35] message to you that they could stack up
[36:37] magazines this tall to say it's wrong
[36:39] and it won't matter to you because
[36:41] you've already been in the presence of
[36:43] God and you know it's right. Listen, I
[36:46] might not know a lot of things, but I
[36:48] know God sent this message. I know it's
[36:51] the food of this age. I know it's what
[36:53] this church needs. It's what a believer
[36:55] needs. It's what every one of us needs.
[36:58] And you can kill me, but you can't make
[37:00] me not preach it. Hallelujah.
[37:04] Yes, sir. It's what we need. It's the
[37:06] kind of food. It's the kind of food.
[37:08] Brother Ram said, "The Bible said in the
[37:10] last days there would come a famine."
[37:12] Why are people tossed about? He's
[37:13] telling us about it. There come a famine
[37:15] in the last days, not for bread and
[37:17] water, but for the hearing of the true
[37:19] word of God. People will come from east
[37:20] to west and everywhere trying to find
[37:22] it. The hour is here. Time of decision.
[37:26] Brother said people go from the east and
[37:27] the west, north to south seeking to hear
[37:29] the true word of God. And here we are
[37:31] privileged tonight to see the message of
[37:35] God, the angel of the God. People are
[37:37] running across the world looking for
[37:40] something that you are privileged to sit
[37:43] here this morning and receive the mana
[37:46] of the age. Amen. We ain't got to run
[37:48] here and there. We ain't got to toss
[37:50] here and toss there. There's a message
[37:53] that's been sent in our age. And I'm
[37:55] privileged to see it.
[37:58] Oh my. I have seen it. Amen. I I feel
[38:02] like the songwriter. My eyes have beheld
[38:06] the glory of the coming of the Lord. I
[38:09] have seen the pillar of fire. I have
[38:11] seen the angel of the Lord. I see it's
[38:13] thus sayaith the Lord. This message is
[38:16] right. Amen.
[38:20] My goodness. It's a time of confusement.
[38:24] People are confused everywhere. Y'all
[38:26] know it's true. I got a friend over in
[38:29] uh well, I call him a friend. He's
[38:30] acquaintance at least. I know him. And
[38:32] over in England, we were together one
[38:34] day and he was a child psychologist or a
[38:36] psychologist in the message. And he
[38:38] said, "Brother Wayne," he said, "I tell
[38:40] you," he said, "I wasn't a preacher, so
[38:41] I thought I'd do something try to help
[38:43] this age." And he said, "I went into
[38:45] psychology." He said, "Let me tell you."
[38:46] He said, "My my office is full of
[38:50] teenagers that's confused about their
[38:53] identity. They don't even know whether
[38:55] they're males or female. Half of them,
[38:57] they don't know who they are. They don't
[38:58] know what to do. They don't Amen. What
[39:00] put them in that shape, folks? Colleges
[39:03] and high schools and literature and
[39:06] television. Amen. God never put this
[39:08] generation in that trouble. But the
[39:10] smarter they get, the further they get
[39:12] from God. Come on. Education is not a
[39:15] bad thing as long as you don't get away
[39:16] from God. Amen. But education has pumped
[39:19] into this system agnostics and ideas of
[39:22] man that's got people so confused.
[39:26] It's true. It's true. They're so
[39:28] confused. They get so confused they want
[39:30] you to be confused.
[39:33] Put pressure on you. Amen. To use the
[39:35] right pronoun. Well, my whole life I
[39:37] grew up saying sir and ma'am.
[39:41] Amen. And it didn't usually take me a
[39:43] long time to figure out a woman was a
[39:44] woman, a man was a man. Yes, sir. No,
[39:46] ma'am. Yes or no, ma'am. But now you go
[39:48] down to Starbucks and mine's confusing.
[39:51] You don't know what you're even supposed
[39:52] to say. I like the way Brother Samuel
[39:54] said it. I didn't want to fight. I just
[39:56] want my
[39:59] coffee. It's almost like they sense it
[40:02] about me, too, cuz they they don't just
[40:04] take my order. They look right at me,
[40:07] just waiting. And I kind of look off.
[40:08] Said, "Order, honey.
[40:12] She say, "Honey, won't you talk to him?"
[40:13] I said, "I don't want to. I might say
[40:16] the wrong thing."
[40:19] They get in this mental dysphoria and
[40:22] then they want you to join it with them.
[40:26] The whole world is going insane.
[40:30] That's right.
[40:34] Oh, there's three gods. Got half the
[40:36] world agreeing to it. And then they want
[40:39] us to join the dysphoria. Listen, I know
[40:42] there's one God. I'm not confused about
[40:44] that. It's almost getting to the now you
[40:47] go to a church to try to preach and you
[40:49] almost feel like you're at Starbucks. I
[40:50] don't even know what to say no more. I
[40:52] used to just go preach the message, but
[40:54] now people are all offended. Well, just
[40:56] cuz you're confused don't mean we're
[40:57] confused.
[41:00] We're not confused. We know where we
[41:03] are. We know the age we're living in. We
[41:07] know what this message has produced and
[41:09] where it's at. Amen. And I will not be
[41:12] subject to the pressures of the ministry
[41:14] of this age to change what we believe on
[41:17] this message. I refuse to water it down.
[41:20] I refuse to bow my head and say,
[41:23] "Forgive me. I don't know because I do
[41:25] know what the message taught."
[41:28] Hallelujah.
[41:30] Well, I just feel pretty good about that
[41:32] right now.
[41:36] I know where the secret place is.
[41:42] By the way, be careful now. You liable
[41:45] to quote brother Brandham too much.
[41:48] Maybe for
[41:50] you, but not for this bride.
[41:53] [Applause]
[41:54] [Music]
[41:55] We are not. I love that saying. I ain't
[41:59] scared. Amen.
[42:02] Eagles don't scare good.
[42:06] You see,
[42:08] it's a dark hour of confusion to find
[42:12] the true word of God. What is the word?
[42:14] Jesus. The word. The word was made
[42:16] flesh. To see the manifestation of the
[42:18] real word of God manifest according to
[42:20] scriptures and brought to pass. How
[42:22] people would travel and seek and would
[42:24] fail to find that. Oh God, we're so glad
[42:27] that we have found him years ago.
[42:29] precious to our heart and to see that
[42:32] we're not one bit confused.
[42:37] Don't you like that? Not one bit
[42:40] confused. Do you know it was a prophecy
[42:41] you wouldn't be?
[42:44] The same prophecy that said there would
[42:46] be a famine also says you won't be
[42:48] confused. How do you know? Jesus said,
[42:51] "He that hunger and thirst shall be
[42:54] filled." Yeah, he knew Amos was in the
[42:56] Bible, but he knew he that was hungry
[42:58] would also be filled. But if he was
[43:01] hungry for righteousness, he would be
[43:03] filled. According to Daniel the 12th
[43:05] chapter, Daniel prophesies of the day.
[43:08] And he said, "They shall know their
[43:10] God."
[43:12] There it is. Look at what John
[43:14] prophesied when Jesus said these words.
[43:17] In that day ye shall know
[43:22] it would be given. That's why Paul said
[43:24] that we've been given to the spirit of
[43:26] adoption. How many knows adoption is
[43:28] maturity? It's the knowledge of the
[43:30] father's work. Then there's an age
[43:33] coming where the people wouldn't be
[43:35] confused. Should I write this check?
[43:37] Should I not write? Should I hire?
[43:39] Should I fire? What should I do? There's
[43:41] coming a group that will know exactly
[43:44] what to do with this message. I believe
[43:47] it's here.
[43:49] I believe that. I believe there are
[43:51] adopted sons and daughters in this
[43:52] building this morning. I believe that
[43:54] with all of my heart. Amen. Let me just
[43:56] say what I believe. I'm at home. This is
[43:58] an adopted church.
[44:00] That's right. That's is Somebody said,
[44:02] "Well, the way True Word does it." Well,
[44:03] the way True Word does it is the way the
[44:05] Bible does it. We don't do this because
[44:08] of the way we do it. We do it because
[44:10] God sent a prophet among us and he gave
[44:13] us church order and he taught us how to
[44:16] set up our churches. what the deacons
[44:18] do, what the trustees do, what the
[44:19] pastor does, what the song leader. We
[44:21] didn't just come up with all these
[44:22] ideas. We were under a message. And that
[44:26] message comes from God. And under it
[44:28] there is liberty. I certainly guarantee
[44:30] you this. Church never come to bind the
[44:32] spirit. That's right. It come to bind
[44:34] the devils that was trying to interrupt
[44:35] the spirit.
[44:37] Amen. And in that day, they shall know
[44:39] their God. Gabriel's instructions.
[44:41] Brother Bram said that he understood
[44:43] that he would send Elijah because Daniel
[44:46] understood the day by the books he was
[44:48] reading. And brother Bram says, "And I
[44:50] understand God's supposed to send Elijah
[44:52] in this day." I'll tell you, if you've
[44:54] been reading these books, you'll
[44:55] understand a lot, too. And I understand
[44:58] there's going to be a Malachi 4. I
[45:00] understand there will be a clear
[45:01] understanding of God's word in the age
[45:03] we're living in. Now, in Psalms 37:18
[45:06] and verse 19, if you haven't, you pull
[45:08] that up. It's a powerful scripture when
[45:11] David begins to speak. He said, "The
[45:12] Lord knoweth the days of the upright,
[45:16] and their inheritance shall be forever."
[45:19] Yeah. Oh, this next one, it just it you
[45:21] just put your running shoes on. For they
[45:24] shall not be ashamed in the evil time.
[45:29] And in the days of famine, they shall be
[45:32] satisfied.
[45:34] I like that. Don't you? They won't be
[45:36] ashamed. Now, do you see shame and
[45:40] confusion basically are the same thing?
[45:42] How many knows that? Brother Bam tells
[45:45] us this in the message ashamed. He said,
[45:47] now the word ashamed really translates
[45:49] the word embarrassed. You're faced with
[45:52] something you're embarrassed about.
[45:53] You're ashamed. He said another thing
[45:55] ashamed does. See, it shows that you're
[45:58] not sure what you're talking about.
[46:01] If you're not sure, then you're ashamed
[46:03] or embarrassed. See, why would I hide
[46:05] from you what I believe on the message
[46:07] unless I wasn't sure I knew what I was
[46:10] talking about.
[46:12] But if I know what I'm talking about,
[46:13] why would we hide it? It's what the
[46:15] prophet taught.
[46:17] See, it shows that you're not sure what
[46:19] you're talking about. If you know what
[46:21] you're talking about and you have the
[46:23] assurance of what you're talking about,
[46:24] you can tell anybody. You're not ashamed
[46:27] of that. But if you put out of place,
[46:29] see, you feel out of place by saying it,
[46:31] it means you're not sure. Yes. See, if
[46:34] you're not sure the message is what Paul
[46:37] was talking about, you'll feel a bit
[46:39] ashamed to try to describe it. And then
[46:41] you'll get angry at somebody, can't see
[46:43] it, and you'll get all you get all tore
[46:45] up at them and stuff, but they can't
[46:46] help they can't see it,
[46:49] right? But that doesn't make it less
[46:51] true.
[46:54] But the the but the feeling that we have
[46:57] and how to present it, if we lose our
[46:59] shame of it, then it's the same as us
[47:02] speaking about Paul or speaking about
[47:04] Iranius. Right?
[47:07] Do you see? Now I'm going to take this
[47:09] just a minute. We'll travel on. Romans
[47:10] chapter 9 and verse 33. It said, "It is
[47:12] written, Behold, I lay in Zion a
[47:14] stumbling stone, a rock of offense, and
[47:16] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[47:20] ashamed. Whoever shall believe upon him
[47:22] shall not be ashamed." Remember, sir, is
[47:24] this the end, sir? Remember that we we
[47:27] read you with a vision. The angels came
[47:29] to the prophet. And when he said he he
[47:31] he then asking the Lord what it meant
[47:34] and he fell into this great anointing.
[47:36] And when he came to himself, he was
[47:38] reading this scripture. Yeah. Amen.
[47:41] Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone,
[47:44] a rock of offense. Whosoever believeth
[47:46] upon him shall not be ashamed. Now watch
[47:50] this. In the absolute, brother Bam said,
[47:52] he that believeth upon him shall not be
[47:54] ashamed. He says, and that is exactly
[47:57] fulfilled scripture. But those that
[47:59] believed him had an absolute.
[48:02] See, they wouldn't be ashamed because
[48:04] they have an absolute to truth. When you
[48:07] know what you're talking about is truth,
[48:09] Amen. It changes the way you approach
[48:12] it. Now, I'm saying that because you
[48:14] lose your confusion. You lose your
[48:16] shame. You You know this is the word of
[48:18] God. Now, you won't have food to eat if
[48:21] you're ashamed. You won't have food to
[48:24] eat if you're confused. But if you let
[48:26] the spirit convince you this is the
[48:28] fulfillment of scripture, then you can
[48:30] eat on that knowing that God is in your
[48:33] midst. God has spoke to you. You see,
[48:36] let somebody prophesy to you and you're
[48:37] not sure it's God. You can't eat that,
[48:39] can you? Right. You can't eat it. So,
[48:42] you're still hungry to know the answer.
[48:44] I need to know. I need to know. Somebody
[48:46] prophesies and you I'm not sure. I'm not
[48:49] sure about that. Then it's not an
[48:51] answer. It's not It don't feed that part
[48:53] of you. But if you know that a prophet
[48:56] is speaking to you, a vindicated
[48:58] prophet, when he answers it, that will
[49:01] fill that void because now you're
[49:04] satisfied with the answer. Yeah. You
[49:07] watch people go from preacher to
[49:08] preacher and and I don't mean that. You
[49:10] can ask a preacher. I'm not being that
[49:11] way. What I'm trying to talk about is
[49:13] you've seen people who don't get their
[49:14] answer
[49:16] that you can come to brother Ray or you
[49:17] can come to me and we'll show you. So
[49:19] what it says here in the message and D
[49:21] and and and and it's like they want more
[49:24] like
[49:26] brother brother I hate to I'll just say
[49:29] it. Brother brother brother called me
[49:30] one day. He says brother Wayne he said I
[49:32] know in the scripture it says that you
[49:34] shouldn't take a brother to law. He
[49:35] said, "Is there anything else on it?" I
[49:37] said, "Does there need to be?"
[49:42] All right.
[49:43] Well, I mean, okay, if Brother Bram said
[49:46] things a certain way, do do we need 50
[49:49] more quotes on it or, you know, if he
[49:52] answered it, then that's the answer of
[49:55] it. The Lord said unto my Lord, set at
[49:57] my right hand to thy make thy enemies
[49:59] thy foottool. Now, some people started
[50:02] with that. made an entire ministry come
[50:04] out with two Lord's people so confused
[50:05] they don't even know how to pray. Yeah.
[50:07] Give father some, give son some. I'm
[50:09] afraid I might have mixed up and amen.
[50:11] Can't call Jesus deity anymore. Can't
[50:13] say he's God. Confused. All kinds of
[50:15] confusion. But the prophet said what
[50:17] that really meant was he was both the
[50:20] root and the offspring of David.
[50:23] Hallelujah. Let's go to church. Amen. We
[50:26] got our answer. Let's go to town. Let's
[50:28] enjoy life. Let's raise our kids. Let's
[50:30] have grandkids. Let's Let's pull
[50:32] something out and have a burger. Amen.
[50:34] We ain't got to lay around all time
[50:36] confused and all tore up in our minds.
[50:38] And what's this mean? What's this mean?
[50:40] What's this mean? Amen. God's got a
[50:42] message. He brought this church to rest.
[50:46] We don't have to go from place to place
[50:48] asking. Amen. Come out of the out of the
[50:51] outer courts. Get out of the holy place
[50:54] and get in the holies of holies where
[50:56] there's rest and security. There's food
[50:59] in there. There's food for every season
[51:03] right in that shakana.
[51:07] My goodness. And it's so good. That
[51:10] that's good food that's in there. Kind
[51:13] of food you can eat with your feet up.
[51:15] You know,
[51:17] sir, you know, I'm talking about not
[51:19] laying awake all night rolling wondering
[51:22] is my baptism right? Is my is my
[51:25] teaching on the Godhead right? Is the
[51:28] church worship right? this happened,
[51:30] right? Amen. When this message takes
[51:33] preeminence, it brings peace.
[51:38] I just spoke last night to brother
[51:39] Steven's group uh under the influence of
[51:41] King Theophony. Brother B said King
[51:44] Theophony was king peace.
[51:46] And in his domain, peace rules.
[51:50] You get out from under that domain,
[51:52] under another influence, and it tears
[51:54] you all to pieces. Get under King
[51:56] Theophony, and peace will rule.
[51:59] peace, settlement, rest. The answer will
[52:03] come into your heart.
[52:06] I I I I'll say this. The Bible says you
[52:08] shall be satisfied. You said, "Brother
[52:10] Wayne, where does this kind of abundance
[52:12] come from?" Jesus said in Luke chapter
[52:14] 4, they they they delivered the Lord the
[52:17] word and the And I I always love uh I
[52:21] always love how he did it. They brought
[52:23] him the Bible. Amen. It was a book of
[52:26] scrolls, which would have been the Old
[52:27] Testament. and he found the book of
[52:29] Isaiah. Yeah. Knowing the whole Bible
[52:32] wasn't yet written, which would be 66
[52:35] chapters. But he took the book of
[52:37] Isaiah, which had 66 chapters, which
[52:40] gave a complete Bible
[52:42] and he found the place where it was
[52:44] written. In other words, he dug through
[52:46] the seed bag
[52:50] to find the seeds that was fitting to
[52:52] the age. Wow. And when he got those
[52:56] seeds out, he began to bring them to
[52:58] bread.
[53:00] He brought out Luke Luke 4, he brings
[53:02] out Isaiah 61 so the people could feed
[53:05] on it. They could feed on what was
[53:07] happening because it was scriptural
[53:09] bread. Jesus said, "I am the bread of
[53:11] life that comes down out of heaven. I'm
[53:12] the true bread. Your fathers did eat
[53:14] many in the wilderness and there
[53:16] everyone dead, but I am the bread of
[53:18] life." And look what he says. The
[53:19] anointing of the Lord was upon him.
[53:21] Amen. The spirit of the Lord was upon
[53:23] him because he hath anointed me to
[53:25] preach the gospel to the poor. Sent me
[53:27] to heal the sick, brokenhearted, preach
[53:29] deliverance to the captive, recovering
[53:31] of sight to the blind, to set at liberty
[53:34] them that are bruised. And then he
[53:35] screams out, "This day this scripture is
[53:37] fulfilled in your midst." Now we we know
[53:40] that's Isaiah the 61st chapter, but only
[53:43] part of that scripture was read in Luke
[53:45] chapter 4. And he closed the book. Isn't
[53:47] that beautiful? He opens the book and he
[53:50] closes the book because there wasn't any
[53:53] more of it coming out at that moment.
[53:55] But in the last days, there is another
[53:57] opening of the book when the book should
[53:59] be opened up and not closed back. Isn't
[54:02] it isn't it remarkable? Amen. That in
[54:04] this day this scripture, brother Bam
[54:06] describes to us birth pains and he talks
[54:09] about how the church is be delivered and
[54:12] how it's to come into a full maturity.
[54:14] He says, "And and I was trying to find
[54:16] the scripture and couldn't find it. And
[54:18] of and one of the royal priests, one of
[54:20] the Catholic priests got up in all of
[54:23] his garb and come and handed me his
[54:24] Bible. And there he was, the spirit of
[54:28] Elijah, the ministry of the son of man,
[54:32] flipping through the book to find the
[54:35] rest of that scripture. Oh my." Amen.
[54:38] This day, this scripture is fulfilled in
[54:40] your midst. What was it? It was
[54:42] scriptural bread. Amen. That's right.
[54:45] You don't have to be confused.
[54:47] And now, amen. Do you see Jesus in that
[54:51] same section said, "I tell you of a
[54:53] truth. There were many widows in Israel
[54:54] in the days of Elias. But when heaven
[54:56] was shut up three years and six months,
[54:58] great famine was throughout the land.
[55:00] There was a lot of widows, but Elijah
[55:02] was only sent to one. That's right.
[55:05] Elijah was sent to a gentile woman
[55:11] who was just about to die under a curse.
[55:16] And Malachi 4 says that unless Elijah
[55:20] comes that there would be earth would be
[55:23] destroyed by a curse. He would not be
[55:26] coming in his forthcoming. He would not
[55:28] be coming to the Jews. He would be
[55:30] coming to the Gentiles to fulfill the
[55:32] portion of scriptures that said the son
[55:34] of man would be revealed.
[55:37] Now this is of course amen the time of
[55:40] of the church coming the gentile coming
[55:43] in under Elijah's ministry. Now if you
[55:46] if you can see that then you begin to
[55:48] understand that that was a provision in
[55:52] the moment of judgment that God himself
[55:55] supernaturally provides. Now, in trying
[55:58] to do God a service, if you'll watch
[56:00] this these two sermons, and you that
[56:02] like to watch the messages unfold, you
[56:04] can see this. Trying to do God a service
[56:06] without his will is a morning sermon.
[56:08] And then spiritual food in due season is
[56:10] an evening sermon. Yeah. And brother
[56:13] Bham says these are two different
[56:15] revival. And he said one of them in the
[56:18] morning time spir is trying to do God a
[56:21] service that be his will. David was
[56:23] trying to bring the word to the people,
[56:25] but he had never consulted a prophet.
[56:28] So, Brother Ram said, "Watch." He
[56:30] consulted the people. Y'all think it
[56:32] feels good and it looks good and should
[56:34] we do this? And he consulted uh uh the
[56:37] other men. And he said, "And David even
[56:40] had a
[56:42] revelation." He said, "But it had not
[56:44] come through the channel of a prophet."
[56:47] Yes, sir. Therefore, the revival
[56:49] produced death rather than life.
[56:53] Y'all seen it. Amen. I I don't have a
[56:55] lot of time to preach on it, but y'all
[56:56] know I reached over to straighten it cuz
[56:58] they had it on a cart and it fell off
[56:59] and the man died. They stopped and then
[57:01] they put it in the threshing floor
[57:03] there. Amen. What's that fell's name?
[57:07] Urise. Yeah. They put it in his
[57:08] threshing floor. Amen. Later to become
[57:11] the place with the temples to be built.
[57:14] David's going to buy that place, right?
[57:16] Amen. and the breaches is sealed up and
[57:18] then David under instructions brings the
[57:20] word on into the city of David which is
[57:23] completely fine under a prophet. See
[57:25] Jesus says in vain do you worship me the
[57:28] doctrines uh uh for the commandments of
[57:30] men. See the thing is is they wouldn't
[57:33] receive the instruction of a prophet
[57:36] trying to bring a revival.
[57:39] They were trying to do it. But then
[57:41] watch, brother Bam said, "This morning
[57:42] we had a lesson on doing God a service,
[57:45] trying to do him a service." See, but it
[57:47] was out of time. It was out of season.
[57:49] It was out of place. It was the wrong
[57:51] person. But
[57:53] now this is spiritual food in due
[57:56] season. So he showed you the wrong part.
[58:00] But in the evening, preaching spiritual
[58:02] food in due season was showing you I
[58:05] have brought this to you for food.
[58:08] This is your food. This is your revival.
[58:11] This is what the church was looking for
[58:14] and he's showing you it come through the
[58:16] correct channels because God reveals his
[58:19] word in his own predestinated season and
[58:22] then he will reveal it to whom he will
[58:24] when he wants to. Now brother Brand will
[58:26] say this. He said now notice this. The
[58:28] Catholic Church knows nothing of Martin
[58:29] Luther's message and how could John
[58:31] Wesley have known Luther's message and
[58:33] how could have Wesley know the
[58:34] Pentecostal message or how could the
[58:36] Pentecostals know this message? He
[58:38] reveals it in his season because it's a
[58:41] seed. Yeah. Now look, he's showing you
[58:45] they don't know nothing about it. Now,
[58:49] now again, brother B, I'm going to say
[58:50] this. God regulates the church. He
[58:54] regulates the predestinated
[58:56] season. The word itself has to be in
[59:00] appropriate season. God reveals the word
[59:03] in the season to whom he chooses to
[59:05] reveal it. Yeah. Watch this. Now, God
[59:08] chooses who he will reveal it. And he
[59:11] chose that before the foundation of the
[59:15] world.
[59:16] You were chose before the world began to
[59:19] live in this season of famine.
[59:23] But the God of heaven knew that when he
[59:26] put you in the age of famine that you
[59:29] would be coming to food through that
[59:31] Elijah ministry. He knew you would know.
[59:35] The Pentecostals won't know. The schools
[59:38] won't know. Amen. Theologians across the
[59:41] universe won't know. But you will know
[59:44] the place
[59:47] because God chose you to feed you in the
[59:51] right place. I'll skip through a little
[59:53] bit of this. Amen. Watch what we find.
[59:55] Then we find that there is a thing that
[59:58] God would do. Now, before before it
[1:00:02] struck, before judgment struck, Brother
[1:00:05] Ram said God had a place for Elijah.
[1:00:09] Do you recognize that in the age we're
[1:00:11] living in, when God sends Elijah, it's
[1:00:13] parallel to the time that he sent Elijah
[1:00:15] to Ahab?
[1:00:17] And God pronounced judgment upon Israel.
[1:00:22] And so has God pronounced judgment upon
[1:00:25] America and its religion. Praise God. In
[1:00:30] 1964, Brother Random tells us Good
[1:00:32] Friday, Alaska almost sunk. How many
[1:00:34] knows that? It was a great earthquake
[1:00:37] hit that. Now, the world knows there was
[1:00:39] an earthquake hit. They got signs up and
[1:00:41] people talk about Good Friday of 1964,
[1:00:44] but most people don't know what was
[1:00:46] behind that earthquake. Amen. A prophet
[1:00:49] was out there on the mountain and he
[1:00:51] said, "A whirlwind come down and said,
[1:00:52] "Pick up a rock and say, thus saith the
[1:00:55] Lord." Yeah. Brother man said, "I didn't
[1:00:57] know what it was about. I just reached
[1:00:59] down and picked the rock up and threw it
[1:01:01] in the air and said, "Thus saith the
[1:01:03] Lord." Amen. And when he threw that rock
[1:01:05] up, something something transpired.
[1:01:08] Amen. Do you see? Something was set in
[1:01:10] motion by a prophet when he threw that
[1:01:13] rock up. It was just a little rock. He
[1:01:15] said, "But the next day, I believe it
[1:01:16] was." He said, "We were standing around
[1:01:18] there and he said, I looked at the
[1:01:19] brother and he said, "Y'all get covered
[1:01:21] quick. Something's about to happen." And
[1:01:23] he said, "All of a sudden, here come a
[1:01:24] whirlwind out of the heavens of fire and
[1:01:27] swept down and an explosion." He said,
[1:01:29] "Took the top of the trees off and great
[1:01:31] rocks begin to blow out." And now some
[1:01:33] of you probably got them in your paper
[1:01:35] weights at home. Amen. That there were
[1:01:36] hundreds, maybe even thousands of little
[1:01:38] pyramid-shaped rocks all over that
[1:01:40] countryside where that great fire had
[1:01:42] come down over Elijah's head. And they
[1:01:44] said, "Brother Brandon, what happened?
[1:01:46] What was it was a fear?" Brother
[1:01:47] Brandham said, "No, it spoke something."
[1:01:49] They didn't hear it. It spoke something.
[1:01:51] And he wouldn't tell him what it was. He
[1:01:53] said, "Then later," I said, "I'll tell
[1:01:54] you what it was. Judgment's about to
[1:01:56] strike the West Coast." Amen. And
[1:01:58] Brother Bam says it later. He says,
[1:02:00] "What happened?" He said, "That tail of
[1:02:02] that dragon slap one time." He said,
[1:02:04] "But there's two more times coming."
[1:02:06] Amen. He said, "It'll belch judgment
[1:02:08] down that west coast. That's why he
[1:02:10] prophesied to Los Angeles. You become
[1:02:13] the city of angels, but thou shalt be
[1:02:16] Amen. and cast into the sea." Now, now,
[1:02:19] now folks, that thus sayaith the Lord
[1:02:21] coming out, there is judgment setting
[1:02:23] upon that nation, setting upon this this
[1:02:26] west coast. Now, now, now I I I'm just
[1:02:29] going to get real straight for a moment.
[1:02:32] A prophet announced judgment upon this.
[1:02:34] And when he did, he told us something.
[1:02:36] He said, "The revival is over."
[1:02:41] 1956, he said, "America, you have
[1:02:43] rejected God." And he said, "The revival
[1:02:46] was over." In 1964, he announced
[1:02:49] judgment upon it. Now, look, God's
[1:02:51] announcing judgment everywhere. But let
[1:02:53] me let me just say, there is a a
[1:02:55] continuity of the revelation of the
[1:02:57] seventh seal in this Bible in every type
[1:03:00] and shadow. And I'll tell you what, you
[1:03:02] can look through it and find it even in
[1:03:03] the days of Noah that God never punishes
[1:03:07] the innocent with the guilty. Amen. God
[1:03:10] always has a place that his church can
[1:03:13] go when the judgments are coming on.
[1:03:15] Thank God he has a place of protection.
[1:03:18] He has a place for the church when
[1:03:20] judgments begin to fall. Brother man
[1:03:22] said, "There it is. There's the plan of
[1:03:24] God that Elijah was to go into the
[1:03:27] secret place." Are we all together?
[1:03:30] Judgment was coming. Elijah was headed
[1:03:33] for the secret place, right? Judgment
[1:03:36] has fell upon the age. And the prophet
[1:03:39] is saying to the bride, "Get in your
[1:03:41] secret place."
[1:03:43] Some people might not even know there is
[1:03:45] a secret place. But in Psalms 27 and5,
[1:03:49] brother Bram said, look how he took it
[1:03:51] for the rapture text. For in the time of
[1:03:54] trouble shall he hide me in his
[1:03:55] pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:03:58] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:04:00] set me upon a rock. He shall hide me in
[1:04:04] the secret of his tabernacle. Oh, that
[1:04:07] tent vision becomes real now, doesn't
[1:04:09] it? He'll hide you in the secret of that
[1:04:12] tabernacle. There's a secret hid there
[1:04:15] that the world don't know nothing about.
[1:04:17] But it's the bride's revival. It's the
[1:04:19] bride's mana. It's the bride's
[1:04:21] anointing. It's in that secret room,
[1:04:24] that secret place.
[1:04:27] Brother said, "The devil don't know
[1:04:28] nothing about it." How could he know?
[1:04:32] How could he know? It would take God to
[1:04:34] reveal it. Yes. That's why a prophet
[1:04:36] could stand there in plain language and
[1:04:38] say it and it went right over their
[1:04:39] heads.
[1:04:41] It went into that plan of God. It was
[1:04:43] fornowledge of God. Judgment begin to
[1:04:46] strike. But there's a place, Amen.
[1:04:49] There's a place of revelation where the
[1:04:51] church begins to hide in the presence of
[1:04:54] God. Look in spiritual food. Brother
[1:04:55] Bram said, "The word is in us and has
[1:04:57] come to us." Elijah this day would be
[1:05:00] the same thing that he did. He would
[1:05:01] feed on the secret things of God.
[1:05:07] He would feed on the secret things of
[1:05:09] God. How many ever heard Sister Brenda
[1:05:11] Lewis sing it? Feed on the secret
[1:05:16] things. Look it up on YouTube. I can't
[1:05:18] do it
[1:05:21] justice. I love Sister Brenda, but I
[1:05:23] can't keep
[1:05:24] up. She's a powerful, powerful lady. God
[1:05:28] bless that lady. My goodness. She I
[1:05:30] preached down there one time in oh
[1:05:32] hatchy and it wasn't very many people
[1:05:34] there but right at the end of the
[1:05:35] service sister Lewis got up and come up
[1:05:38] and said God gave me a song brother
[1:05:39] Wayne while you was preaching she took
[1:05:41] the mic and brought the house down I
[1:05:42] said man she done more than one song
[1:05:44] than I done with that whole
[1:05:47] sermon she caught the revelation of it
[1:05:51] do you see the secret things that's
[1:05:53] that's where you're feeding is the
[1:05:55] secret things
[1:05:57] the things that is despised by the world
[1:05:59] things that are are been rejected and
[1:06:01] they're ashamed of and they don't want
[1:06:03] people talking about. But that's the
[1:06:05] bride's food. See, the spiritual food is
[1:06:08] ready and it's in season. Now, each one
[1:06:11] of you can have this food if you wish
[1:06:14] it. If you're willing now to steal away
[1:06:17] from the unbelief of the hour, you're
[1:06:19] ready to come into Christ. Now, watch
[1:06:22] this. I remember where I was sitting
[1:06:24] when God revealed to me what that was. I
[1:06:26] remember to this day and I won't say his
[1:06:29] name, but there was a local pastor here
[1:06:30] that was a great universal pastor and he
[1:06:33] he decided the message wasn't right and
[1:06:36] all these things happened and I was
[1:06:37] sitting in Norway and I was in a little
[1:06:39] room getting ready for meetings and
[1:06:40] listening to this tape right here and
[1:06:43] the prophet of God said this. Each one
[1:06:44] of you can have this food if you wished
[1:06:46] if you're willing to steal away from all
[1:06:48] unbelief.
[1:06:50] But the moment you get in the presence
[1:06:52] of unbelievers and they begin to speak
[1:06:54] to you and you begin to reason and
[1:06:57] wonder, maybe it is, maybe it ain't,
[1:06:59] maybe they're right, maybe it ain't,
[1:07:00] they're stealing from you the food for
[1:07:03] your children. They're stealing like the
[1:07:06] Amorites, the Philistines took. They're
[1:07:08] taking from you the very food, the very
[1:07:11] substance that you can survive on in the
[1:07:14] age you're living in. But if you can
[1:07:16] steal away from it, Yeah. Come on,
[1:07:18] church. Why do you think, brother Bam
[1:07:19] said that Holies of Holies was a
[1:07:21] soundproof room?
[1:07:23] It was a supernatural cuz it was
[1:07:24] soundproof one way, right? Cuz when they
[1:07:27] were in there, they was crying holies of
[1:07:28] holies and they could hear him on the
[1:07:30] outside. And if they couldn't hear him,
[1:07:31] they had to go. They had to drag a cuz
[1:07:33] he's dead. But brother Bam said once you
[1:07:36] got inside, you couldn't hear nothing.
[1:07:39] Amen. Isn't wouldn't that be something
[1:07:40] to be in a place where you can't hear
[1:07:42] any unbelief? No doubts. Amen. Amen. You
[1:07:45] might hear it, but it don't you don't
[1:07:46] hear it. You're not you're it's not
[1:07:48] affected by what you're hearing because
[1:07:50] you're in that holy place. This message
[1:07:54] is no good in denominations. It's no
[1:07:57] good in the world. They don't believe
[1:07:59] it. But to you who do believe, it's the
[1:08:02] stone. It's the rock. It's the
[1:08:05] headstone. It's life.
[1:08:09] Food for our season.
[1:08:12] The brothers said they wanted to talk to
[1:08:15] me about some of this unbelief they had
[1:08:17] going. I said, "I ain't got no time to
[1:08:18] hear it."
[1:08:21] They wanted to talk to me about it. I
[1:08:22] said, "I I got some questions for you."
[1:08:26] They said, "Well, Lawson, you just got
[1:08:28] your head in the sand." I said, "No,
[1:08:30] it's called the Holies of Holies.
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:33] My head's not in the sand. It's in the
[1:08:36] presence of Christ. My mind is in his
[1:08:38] word." Do
[1:08:41] you see when you steal away from it?
[1:08:42] Now, now I'm going to read this and I
[1:08:44] know we're getting late and I'm slowing
[1:08:46] down, but we we want to read this to you
[1:08:47] because you I think it's very powerful
[1:08:49] to hear it. If you're ready to come into
[1:08:51] Christ into his promise, see, the secret
[1:08:54] place is provided by the scriptures that
[1:08:58] belong in your age. Watch this. Remember
[1:09:01] his promise. Now, I'm going to tell you
[1:09:02] where your secret place is. Malachi 4.
[1:09:07] That's a secret to you. John 14 and 12.
[1:09:12] See, that's your secret. That's your
[1:09:14] secret place. Joel chapter 2 and verse
[1:09:17] 28. That's a secret place for you. Look
[1:09:20] that that, brother Brad, but let's just
[1:09:21] let's just add it for you. Revelations
[1:09:23] 10 1 to 11. That's your secret. That's a
[1:09:27] secret place of that bride. Luke 17:30.
[1:09:30] It's a secret place. So when judgments
[1:09:32] are calling, a prophet is calling you
[1:09:35] into those scriptures.
[1:09:37] If you'll come into these scriptures,
[1:09:39] you'll be fed throughout this age of
[1:09:42] famine because you will know exactly
[1:09:44] what it is. Now in in ser is this a
[1:09:47] sign. Remember I gave you six dreams,
[1:09:49] one vision. How many remembers that? I I
[1:09:52] had brother I played them and then I
[1:09:53] read talked to you about six dreams and
[1:09:55] a vision before he went out west. One of
[1:09:58] those dreams Amen. One of those dreams
[1:10:00] before he left to go get the seal,
[1:10:02] Sister Collins come to him and said,
[1:10:03] "Brother Brandon, I dreamed a dream that
[1:10:05] it was a wedding fist to take place."
[1:10:07] And the bridegroom came in perfect, but
[1:10:09] the bride wasn't very perfect. Yet, it
[1:10:12] was the bride. Now, that's the church.
[1:10:15] And it was like a communion service
[1:10:17] going on and a dinner being set. And it
[1:10:20] kind of got next to her because brother
[1:10:22] Neville was serving dinner in the
[1:10:24] church. But she said it was the best
[1:10:26] food I'd ever eaten. and she was so
[1:10:29] hungry, but she thought maybe in a dream
[1:10:32] that she shouldn't serve it. And she and
[1:10:34] brother Wildard was going to go up to
[1:10:35] the ranch house and eat. And when they
[1:10:37] did, the light on the right hand side
[1:10:39] went out. Now y'all know what that was.
[1:10:42] And brother B says, "Now the food, the
[1:10:44] bride isn't perfect." This 1962 in the
[1:10:47] fall. She's not perfect. He said, "But
[1:10:51] the bridegroom is perfect. And the bride
[1:10:54] is not perfect yet, but the food that
[1:10:57] was being given was not literal food.
[1:10:59] It's spiritual food that y'all have been
[1:11:03] listening to.
[1:11:05] Now, in the message serves as a sign,
[1:11:07] Brother Brandon will record to you that
[1:11:09] he was told by vision to stay home and
[1:11:13] store food. How many remembers the
[1:11:14] vision? Don't go overseas in that little
[1:11:17] canoe for one meeting. Stay home and
[1:11:19] store food. Do y'all remember the other
[1:11:21] part of that vision? A dream he had.
[1:11:23] Remember he said he said I he was
[1:11:25] troubled and he had a dream about
[1:11:27] 6second Smith. How many knows the dream?
[1:11:30] It's important. If you don't know it,
[1:11:31] I'll tell it real quick. 6cond Smith.
[1:11:33] Brother Ba, it's this is in the message
[1:11:35] greatest battle ever fought. And in the
[1:11:37] front of this message, greatest battle
[1:11:40] ever fought. He meets 6cond Smith in his
[1:11:42] dream. And he said, "Brother Sixsec was
[1:11:46] whipping these guys up and all this
[1:11:47] stuff." And he said, now he said it was
[1:11:49] odd to me that I would see my original
[1:11:52] trainer in that dream because he says
[1:11:55] that was that was the one that taught me
[1:11:57] to fight when I was a bantamweight. And
[1:11:59] he said he said he'd stand me up there
[1:12:01] and he said he'd hit me so hard he'd
[1:12:04] knock the wind out of me and knock me up
[1:12:05] against the wall. He said and I'd say,
[1:12:07] "Why are you going to hit me so hard?"
[1:12:09] Yeah. And he said, "Well, you don't like
[1:12:11] it now." He said, "But when you get in
[1:12:13] that ring there, you'll thank me." right
[1:12:15] now. He said, "Because when you when you
[1:12:17] hit a man that ain't been hit before,
[1:12:19] his air just leaves him." Amen. Amen. He
[1:12:21] he don't know how to take a hit. Brother
[1:12:23] said what he was doing was training him
[1:12:25] that when it when when the hit come, it
[1:12:27] wouldn't just knock him down. He he he
[1:12:30] wouldn't see, he didn't just fall down
[1:12:32] at every lick. He knew how to take a
[1:12:35] lick and stand there in the ring with
[1:12:36] it. And and this this this was being his
[1:12:39] training. And brother Bam comes out of
[1:12:41] it and he's going to be preaching these
[1:12:43] series of sermons storing food. And he
[1:12:45] said, "There it is. I seen it right
[1:12:47] quick." He says that God was telling me,
[1:12:50] "Go back to your original training.
[1:12:54] Go back to your original training." What
[1:12:56] was that original training? The word of
[1:12:59] God.
[1:13:00] Listen, church. Amen. There's great
[1:13:02] battles coming in this last day. But
[1:13:05] you've been trained by a prophet.
[1:13:08] You've been trained. You're not
[1:13:10] denominationally trained. You're trained
[1:13:12] by a messenger. Your original training
[1:13:15] is take it back to the word of God. When
[1:13:18] somebody hits you with an idea, they hit
[1:13:20] you with a denominational thought. Don't
[1:13:22] just fall down. And every little hit,
[1:13:24] stand there like a man with this
[1:13:26] message. You've been trained to believe.
[1:13:29] You've been trained to stand in the
[1:13:31] presence of every unbelieving devil. You
[1:13:33] don't have to just get up and walk off.
[1:13:35] Amen. You've got a training. Now, what
[1:13:38] is it? This is a This is a This is a
[1:13:41] storing of food. Now, we're talking
[1:13:43] about the opening of the word, a divine
[1:13:45] provision. Amen. Y'all y'all y'all still
[1:13:47] hungry? You got a minute?
[1:13:49] It's a divine provision. Now, watch this
[1:13:52] because we're going to talk about in
[1:13:54] serves as this a sign. Now, we're
[1:13:55] staying staying local to that. Look what
[1:13:57] he says. I have done all I know how to
[1:13:59] do, Lord, to feed them the bread of
[1:14:02] life. As in the vision many years ago
[1:14:05] where that great big curtain laid in the
[1:14:07] west and a mountain of the bread of
[1:14:10] life, that little book, I was not
[1:14:12] disobedient to the heavenly vision. Now,
[1:14:15] how many ever heard the vision that
[1:14:17] brother Bram speaks of the bread of life
[1:14:19] in the
[1:14:21] west? I'm serious. If you don't know, I
[1:14:23] I want to know because I need to I need
[1:14:24] to help us. Okay. The bread of life. And
[1:14:27] you can get this from me if you'd like.
[1:14:29] Uh Brother Bram was um testifying to
[1:14:32] this. This is March 1945, 3:00 a.m. in
[1:14:34] the morning. And beginning of the
[1:14:36] vision, simmonly, I was walking through
[1:14:37] the northeast on a road when the spirit
[1:14:40] turned me and pointed me toward the
[1:14:41] west. Now, watch that west out there.
[1:14:43] That's where that them seals are opened.
[1:14:46] He said, "The spirit of the Lord turned
[1:14:47] me to the west, and I was facing a great
[1:14:49] mountain, and it seemed to be a mountain
[1:14:51] of the Lord, and it was tiring high
[1:14:54] above the steeple on the top of it. And
[1:14:56] then I asked to go west toward the
[1:14:57] mountain. And I entered the mountain
[1:15:00] through a door on the inside. And I was
[1:15:02] met by a woman who had on a garment that
[1:15:06] might have been snow white at one time.
[1:15:08] He says, "But now her garment was
[1:15:11] soiled." And she asked me if I was Billy
[1:15:13] Brandham. And I said, "I I am." And then
[1:15:16] she introduced herself. I am Miss
[1:15:18] Methodist. Brother Brandham said, "There
[1:15:20] she was, the former age." He said, "And
[1:15:23] I asked her,"Wh the spots on your lovely
[1:15:25] white garment?" And she said, "I've been
[1:15:27] so busy." Then I said to her, "That's
[1:15:30] right. You Methodists have been busy
[1:15:31] with organizations and societies in your
[1:15:34] church. You haven't had much time for
[1:15:36] the Lord." Then she said, "I was told
[1:15:38] that you were being sent to me. Maybe I
[1:15:41] should awaken my husband." And then she
[1:15:43] disappeared. Looking to my left, I saw a
[1:15:46] small heap of smooth baked bread where
[1:15:49] white fowls were standing near it, but
[1:15:52] they wouldn't eat much of it. Now listen
[1:15:55] to that. They wouldn't eat much of it.
[1:15:58] Then the Lord said to me, "Do you know
[1:16:00] them?" I said, "No." He said, "That is
[1:16:04] your
[1:16:05] tabernacle. They won't eat the bread of
[1:16:08] life anymore.
[1:16:10] I am sending you this way and I
[1:16:13] journeyed toward the west.
[1:16:15] I was then brought into a plane where a
[1:16:18] platform was erected seemingly. It was
[1:16:21] under a large tent or order. Now this is
[1:16:23] in 40s. This is not 56. Amen. I was
[1:16:26] under a platform erected seemingly a
[1:16:28] large tent or or auditorium and there
[1:16:31] were curtains drawn in the back of the
[1:16:33] platform and the Lord told me to pull
[1:16:35] back the curtain. When I did, I saw a
[1:16:39] mountain of the bread of life. Now, what
[1:16:42] a prophet's telling in 47, God's already
[1:16:45] showing him that the bread of life is
[1:16:48] out west out there behind that tent. And
[1:16:51] look what he says. He says, "And I saw
[1:16:53] them and I told the Lord to pull," he
[1:16:55] told me to pull back the curtains and I
[1:16:57] saw a mountain of the bread of life and
[1:16:59] he said, "Feed these."
[1:17:02] And then turning, I saw a white
[1:17:06] robed people coming from
[1:17:10] everywhere making up a large
[1:17:13] audience. Now watch, his own personal
[1:17:16] tabernacle had a small loaf. They
[1:17:18] wouldn't eat. But God sent him west.
[1:17:22] Amen. To pull back the curtain on that
[1:17:24] tent. And when he said, "Feed these," I
[1:17:27] looked and saw those white rob people
[1:17:29] coming from everywhere. You do you see
[1:17:32] why I preached the message of the hour?
[1:17:35] Do you see the vision has already told
[1:17:37] me if I'll just preach what was in that
[1:17:40] tent ministry? Amen. That they will come
[1:17:43] from everywhere to eat it. Listen, the
[1:17:45] secret of True Word Tabernacle is not
[1:17:47] our music. We have good music. It's not
[1:17:50] our singing. And we have good singers,
[1:17:52] but our secret is the message of the
[1:17:55] hour. It's the pillar of fire that's
[1:17:57] behind the veil. It's the word. This
[1:18:00] platform is built on the word of God.
[1:18:04] Brother Ericson, he built the platform
[1:18:07] to preach this message. And I maintain
[1:18:09] the platform to preach this message.
[1:18:12] Amen. It's consecrated to this message.
[1:18:14] We have been anointed to feed the ones
[1:18:18] the prophet saw in that vision. There's
[1:18:20] a lot of ministers that has the same
[1:18:22] job. Amen. And I they have to do
[1:18:24] whatever God leads them to do. But as
[1:18:26] far as this church, as far as this
[1:18:28] platform, it is a platform for the bread
[1:18:31] of life that come out of that great loaf
[1:18:33] that was in the west. It's the message
[1:18:35] of the hour. It's the opening of the
[1:18:38] word. It's the third pull. It's the
[1:18:40] teachings of this message. What is it?
[1:18:44] Amen. People coming from all over the
[1:18:46] earth. The bread of life was to the
[1:18:47] peoples of the world. It's not just
[1:18:49] about this tabernacle. It's all over the
[1:18:51] world. Amen. This message is not
[1:18:54] yesterday's mana. It's not yesterday's
[1:18:56] news. It's still alive. It's still
[1:18:59] powerful. It's still real. If we can
[1:19:01] forget our unbelief, we can go higher
[1:19:04] than we've ever been in our lives. This
[1:19:06] message has everything we need to
[1:19:09] produce a climax for the rapture of the
[1:19:11] church. We don't have to beat the altar
[1:19:13] to get our revival. We have been given a
[1:19:16] revival. We don't have to fast and pray
[1:19:18] to try to pull ourselves in some kind of
[1:19:21] spiritual world. Amen. There's a message
[1:19:23] that's been given us and a call. Come up
[1:19:26] hither. Come up hither. Get in the door
[1:19:28] of the word of God and watch the
[1:19:30] manifestations of his word come along.
[1:19:33] Oh, I tell you this this morning.
[1:19:35] There's a mountain. There's a bread of
[1:19:37] life.
[1:19:40] So, preacher, why are you so carried
[1:19:41] away with this bread? Because first
[1:19:42] Thessalonians 4 said the Lord himself
[1:19:44] would descend from heaven with a shout.
[1:19:48] The message is the bread of life. Amen.
[1:19:52] The message is the bread of life. Why do
[1:19:55] you Why should you listen to these
[1:19:57] tapes? Why should you listen to these
[1:19:59] tapes in your home? Why Why take time to
[1:20:01] listen to these tapes in your home?
[1:20:03] Brother Brandham said this. He said,
[1:20:05] "Lord, you gave me a vision a couple
[1:20:07] years ago to store up this food, fine,
[1:20:10] healthy looking vegetables I saw in the
[1:20:12] vision being stored. And may we today
[1:20:15] receive a barrel full of that or a tape
[1:20:18] load."
[1:20:20] A prophet was loading tapes
[1:20:25] with germmitized seed.
[1:20:28] Hallelujah.
[1:20:31] My goodness, folks. Tape loads.
[1:20:36] Barrels full.
[1:20:38] We're not in famine.
[1:20:42] We're not in famine.
[1:20:45] You may be ready to push Blake back
[1:20:47] right now. We're not in famine.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah.
[1:20:54] That woman at that in that vision wasn't
[1:20:57] in famine. This church ain't in famine.
[1:21:02] What's God doing? He's nourishing you.
[1:21:04] Amen. He He's He's nourishing.
[1:21:08] He's building you up.
[1:21:11] He's filling you full of things that'll
[1:21:14] make you strong and healthy.
[1:21:17] That's what he's doing. He's he's now
[1:21:19] now uh you know God has a way, right?
[1:21:23] It's it's up and it's high and it's low
[1:21:25] and it's slow and it's God.
[1:21:29] It's God communion. Brother Brand will
[1:21:31] say this re another reason we take food
[1:21:35] is to build our body up to resist
[1:21:37] diseases.
[1:21:39] I heard the I heard the doctor. Amen.
[1:21:41] That one's wrong.
[1:21:43] If you don't take food,
[1:21:47] your body will get weak.
[1:21:51] Then it's subject to diseases.
[1:21:54] Diseases will break right into the
[1:21:56] bloodstream and you're gone. If your
[1:21:59] blood isn't rich and pure, then it'll
[1:22:02] disease will go right into your
[1:22:04] bloodstream. Now watch him now. He's
[1:22:06] really teaching. So you got to eat food,
[1:22:10] nourishing food to keep your bloodstream
[1:22:13] right. If you don't, you're allergic and
[1:22:16] you got all these diseases. That's
[1:22:18] what's a matter with a lot of
[1:22:19] Christians.
[1:22:24] Now, therefore, the food is the
[1:22:27] nourishment that keeps out the diseases.
[1:22:32] That
[1:22:34] means we don't have to be so crazy
[1:22:37] protective
[1:22:39] if we just eat good food.
[1:22:47] I got to be careful here because I know
[1:22:49] there's some
[1:22:50] germaphobia. Y'all pray. Everybody can
[1:22:52] begin to pray right now. Pray the pastor
[1:22:55] don't hit it wrong.
[1:22:59] But fear sometimes keeps people from
[1:23:02] social life. You know, if I get around
[1:23:04] certain person, if I get in this, I'm
[1:23:06] going to get this this cold. And they
[1:23:08] get so weary till they almost would pull
[1:23:12] them into their house and they just shut
[1:23:14] the door.
[1:23:18] But if you eat proper,
[1:23:20] you got natural immunities
[1:23:23] and it pushes off diseases. Yeah. Now,
[1:23:25] I'm not talking natural at all, folks.
[1:23:28] I'm talking about that's why we don't
[1:23:29] get up here every week and say, "You
[1:23:31] can't hear so and so preach.
[1:23:33] You can't go down and visit the meeting.
[1:23:37] You you you all Well, y'all be real
[1:23:39] careful now. Don't you go over here in
[1:23:41] this meeting. Don't y'all go over and
[1:23:42] see these people cuz you're going to
[1:23:43] pick up a bunch of diseases. Eat right
[1:23:47] and fellowship.
[1:23:50] Eat right and love people. Eat right.
[1:23:54] Shake somebody's hand, hug somebody's
[1:23:56] neck. You ain't got to be a hermit to
[1:23:59] stay a disease free. You ain't got to be
[1:24:02] a a church settle. We ain't got to go
[1:24:04] out in the woods somewhere and hide from
[1:24:05] the rest of the world. We just got to
[1:24:07] eat the right foods. And this food is
[1:24:10] the right food. It'll keep you out of
[1:24:12] diseases. It'll keep a purity in your
[1:24:15] blood.
[1:24:17] My goodness. That that telling you a
[1:24:19] little secret behind my heart. Hey, man.
[1:24:22] Brother Bam says this, and I'm closing.
[1:24:24] Brother Bam says this in Revelation
[1:24:26] chapter 5. I think you said you
[1:24:28] mentioned it the other day. Bruce
[1:24:29] Serpent. Amen. Uh in Revelations 22.
[1:24:31] Remember, don't worship me. Yeah.
[1:24:33] Brother Bam said, you do y'all know that
[1:24:35] there were people literally worshiping
[1:24:36] Brother Brandham?
[1:24:38] Even when he was alive.
[1:24:41] And the head of it was in Canada. Yes,
[1:24:43] sir. And the tail of it was in Georgia.
[1:24:47] That spoke of a group in Canada and a
[1:24:49] group in Georgia. And when brother
[1:24:51] Brandham struck it, he was standing in
[1:24:53] Jeffersonville.
[1:24:55] So he hit the snake right in the middle.
[1:24:58] Watch this. Watch him say it. A few
[1:25:00] nights ago, he said, "I had a visitation
[1:25:02] from the Lord and I seen a serpent which
[1:25:04] was yell and black telling me right
[1:25:06] along and the thing struck me on the
[1:25:08] leg.
[1:25:10] That deity spirit bit your prophet on
[1:25:13] the leg."
[1:25:15] He said, "See, but the blood was so rich
[1:25:18] it didn't take no effect on me.
[1:25:21] that that demon bit the prophet, but it
[1:25:24] didn't affect him because he ate right.
[1:25:27] He ate the right things. Amen. He could
[1:25:29] he could be amongst the most crazy
[1:25:31] people. But yet his spirit stayed right
[1:25:34] because he ate right. Come on, church.
[1:25:37] Brother Bam said, "You wait till I get
[1:25:39] over here and these seals, they're going
[1:25:40] to open up some rich spiritual
[1:25:42] vitamins." Amen. seals this bread that's
[1:25:44] being fed under the opening of the word.
[1:25:47] It'll be a bread that you can eat that
[1:25:49] the serpent ain't going to be able to
[1:25:50] touch you. Now, I don't want to get
[1:25:52] personal, but I'll say this. That deity
[1:25:54] spirit went into that little puddle of
[1:25:56] water and it escaped that prophet. And
[1:25:59] years later, it's resurrected now and
[1:26:01] it's all over certain areas. But if
[1:26:03] you'll watch every area that it really
[1:26:06] has power in, don't believe the seven
[1:26:08] seal was opened at the time brother
[1:26:10] Brandon was on the earth. They're still
[1:26:12] looking for the tent. They're still
[1:26:14] looking for the revival. They're still
[1:26:16] looking for the word to open. But where
[1:26:18] this word has opened, where these people
[1:26:21] are eating the food, they're not
[1:26:22] worshiping the prophet, they're eating
[1:26:25] the mana. And the deity spirit cannot
[1:26:27] affect
[1:26:30] them. Hey. Amen. Amen. It's spiritual
[1:26:34] food in due season. The course has been
[1:26:36] set. The meal. Won't y'all stand to your
[1:26:38] feet with me? I'm not going to get done
[1:26:39] with it. I'll have to preach again
[1:26:40] Thursday. Amen. You see, it's spiritual
[1:26:42] food. It's a new season. Thank you,
[1:26:44] Jesus. My walking down that street. That
[1:26:50] prophet saw her gathering that
[1:26:52] together. Go make me a cake and make me
[1:26:56] something. Bring it to me.
[1:26:59] I tell you the attitude she could have
[1:27:00] had. You're the reason we're in this.
[1:27:07] Preacher, what are you talking about?
[1:27:09] The reason this bride, the reason these
[1:27:11] people right here are not a part of big
[1:27:14] denominational groups is because of
[1:27:16] William Brandham.
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] Thank you, Lord. That's right. And she
[1:27:23] could have said, "You're the reason
[1:27:26] we're in this."
[1:27:31] She didn't.
[1:27:33] He said, "If you'll bring it to me,
[1:27:36] give me that last little Pentecostal
[1:27:38] doctrine you got.
[1:27:41] Yes, sir. Just empty it out." Yes, sir.
[1:27:45] She was at the end of her
[1:27:47] barrel, but she was at the top of God's.
[1:27:52] And where hers was running out, that's
[1:27:54] where God started.
[1:27:56] I tell you what, this message when you
[1:27:58] when you run out of your ideas
[1:28:01] and you run out of your opinions and you
[1:28:03] run out of these little side things,
[1:28:06] that's when you reach into God's
[1:28:08] and all of a
[1:28:10] sudden there's so much you don't know
[1:28:12] what to do with all of them. You can't
[1:28:14] get it in one service. People say,
[1:28:16] "Well, don't you run out of things to
[1:28:17] preach?"
[1:28:20] Nope. I sure
[1:28:22] don't. ain't got nothing to do with me.
[1:28:25] I'm living in a season of plenty.
[1:28:28] I'm living I'm living in a season of
[1:28:30] plenty. Amen. There's not enough
[1:28:32] services to get to it
[1:28:36] in the moment that you steal
[1:28:39] away. You just shut off all the
[1:28:42] unbelief. Man, there's food everywhere.
[1:28:47] Thank you, Jesus. I'm so glad this
[1:28:49] morning to be able to eat it. Amen.
[1:28:52] Amen. Oh, do you love him? Do you love
[1:28:55] him? If you want some of those visions
[1:28:57] or something like that, please just
[1:28:58] contact me and I'll I'll get them to
[1:29:00] you. I know I was reading through them
[1:29:01] pretty quick, but we're going to Lord
[1:29:04] willing, we're going to continue on.
[1:29:05] Would that be okay if we continue this
[1:29:06] series a little bit?
[1:29:08] Amen. Amen, brother. Right. We've got
[1:29:12] the
[1:29:15] power in the name of Jesus.
[1:29:22] We got the
[1:29:26] power in the name of the
[1:29:33] Lord. Though Satan
[1:29:37] raes, we cannot be defeated.
[1:29:44] Revive the
[1:29:48] power in the name of the
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:55] Lord. Give me your hand.
[1:30:00] Let's agree
