[3:37] start learning the difference between
[3:39] mercy and Grace and you learn that Mercy
[3:42] is you didn't get what you

[4:37] Lord to each of our hearts and each door
[4:40] of our heart Lord that you would have
[4:41] full access and full control now father
[4:44] we welcome you this morning upon your
[4:46] word asking you that you would bless
[4:48] your children Lord father this is far
[4:51] beyond anything that we could do or say
[4:53] to help them but Lord we ask that you

[5:23] Ephesians chapter 6 I want to take uh a
[5:26] reading here if I can uh
[5:30] from the uh from the 17th verse
[5:34] Ephesians 6 and verse
[5:43] 17 and take the
[5:45] helmet of
[5:48] salvation and the sword of the
[5:51] spirit which is the word of God we ask
[5:56] the Lord to bless his word you could be
[5:58] seated this morning
[6:00] amen we're wanting to uh speak to you a
[6:02] few minutes today on pressing forward in
[6:06] the spirit of God pressing forward in
[6:09] the spirit of God Amen uh I I thank the
[6:13] Lord amen for his grace Amen to be able
[6:16] to press forward and and to move forward
[6:18] I believe that it's I believe it's a
[6:20] special time to do so Amen in this in
[6:22] the age that we're living in amen I I
[6:25] wanted to I was hearing brother Ben
[6:27] talking in the back and he was just
[6:28] saying there how the Lord had touched
[6:30] him amen we we really don't know yet
[6:32] what happened to that uh to that but
[6:34] we're just going to believe it was
[6:35] prayer that changed the situation you
[6:37] know amen uh I I believe that amen uh we
[6:44] were uh we were discussing that with
[6:46] Brother Andy Thompson how that Legion it
[6:48] just it turns out to be infection amen
[6:51] and you know somebody said well maybe it
[6:53] was all the time I don't know but I'm
[6:54] going to thank the Lord and just believe
[6:56] it was prayer that made the change amen
[6:58] I I I I I I I want to I want to thank
[7:01] God for what he does and brother uh
[7:03] brother Ben said something there about
[7:05] thanking the lord for pain medication
[7:07] you know uh there's years ago people
[7:09] didn't have that stuff you know can you
[7:11] imagine getting a tooth pull with no P
[7:13] pain medication or no my surgeries and
[7:17] all of that thing but but but we thank
[7:19] the Lord for it and you know I I know uh
[7:22] some he said it was controversy in it I
[7:24] know it is sometimes uh the idea of
[7:27] medicines and things like that but you
[7:29] know uh but but real uh but real medical
[7:32] people are uh are different Amen in that
[7:35] they're uh very Christian medical people
[7:38] and we thank God for them amen we we
[7:40] thank the Lord when you're hurting or
[7:41] when you need help amen that God's got
[7:44] somebody there that's uh trained in
[7:46] those areas and amen God has done I God
[7:49] has done a tremendous thing here in this
[7:51] assembly he has said among us many uh
[7:53] many people that have studied Medical
[7:56] Science and went right in that way and
[7:58] amen and uh I know through some of the
[8:00] difficulties each of you uh God sure has
[8:03] anointed our sister Lily to help this
[8:05] assembly and amen and um you know uh
[8:09] she's just God God's gift here to us and
[8:12] amen she's been a blessing to many of
[8:14] you to our young people and amen and um
[8:17] and by the way brother Jeremy he ain't
[8:18] too bad either
[8:23] amen I thanked him one day for them
[8:26] being here and he said brother Wayne
[8:28] Lily does it he said
[8:30] he said I'll just push a button in the
[8:32] back but we certainly glad you pushed
[8:34] that button back there amen amen we
[8:37] certainly love this family and we love
[8:39] all these uh these medical people that
[8:41] God's put Among Us and I just wonder
[8:43] could we show them some appreciation
[8:44] this morning our doctors and
[8:46] nurses amen uh I appreciate these
[8:51] people I know brother Ashton I know he
[8:54] goes up through a lot to help people and
[8:56] and they're not just doing these things
[8:58] for jobs but they're calling on their
[9:00] lives and there's a lot of study and
[9:02] work and and goes into these things and
[9:04] we certainly appreciate all they do and
[9:06] amen it's it's such a blessing amen when
[9:09] you're going through things you
[9:10] appreciate God for the people that he
[9:12] puts around you amen and so I just was
[9:14] thinking this morning I was I was just
[9:16] dwelling on some of the things the Holy
[9:18] Spirit has done in the assembly and how
[9:21] that uh that you know you you see an
[9:23] assembly grow and then you see there's
[9:26] been things that we've come through as
[9:27] an assembly throughout the years and and
[9:30] uh now um I think it's marking close to
[9:32] 11 years we've been here this fall uh
[9:34] but you know there's there's things even
[9:36] that amount of time some of you've been
[9:37] here a lot longer and you've seen things
[9:39] come and you've seen things go um but
[9:42] you know there are things uh in your in
[9:44] your existence as a Christian uh that
[9:47] you have to be able to uh how could I
[9:50] say it you have to be able to divide the
[9:52] things that you should carry with you
[9:54] and the things that you should not uh I
[9:57] I found that we usually forget what we
[9:59] ought to remember and remember what we
[10:01] ought to forget I I I found that to be
[10:04] mostly true uh that uh that you know if
[10:07] we're not careful sometimes we carry
[10:09] things we should have left and and uh
[10:12] but I think that the Bible uh is strict
[10:14] here is in that if we're going to be uh
[10:17] if we're going to make it forward in a
[10:19] in a battle if we're going to move
[10:21] forward as a church as a people then
[10:24] there is a there's a a the Apostle Paul
[10:26] gives us a powerful writing and brother
[10:28] brandom said says when uh in greatest
[10:30] battle he's talking about how that he
[10:32] was talking about being soldiers and he
[10:34] said but yet sometimes it types in in
[10:36] running and so if you think about uh
[10:39] pressing forward in something that there
[10:41] is a there's going to be things when you
[10:43] move there's going to be things that you
[10:45] have to leave and then there's things
[10:47] that you have to take and you have to
[10:49] start Discerning the difference between
[10:51] the two you know if you're going to go
[10:53] on a trip and I know you sisters uh uh
[10:55] you got to just pack one bag there's a
[10:57] lot of decisions to make about that one
[10:59] bag you know uh you know what am I going
[11:02] to need and and how many pair of shoes
[11:04] and and what's the dress wear and what's
[11:07] we going to have dinner how many
[11:08] services are there there's there's
[11:10] decisions to make because you can't take
[11:12] everything you own on every trip you go
[11:14] on so there is times that we have to we
[11:17] have to make up our minds some things
[11:19] that have to go with us and some things
[11:21] uh they must stay and uh and and and in
[11:24] Philippians chapter 3 amen Paul says
[11:27] something very powerful in 12 verse down
[11:29] to the 16th and we'll read this and he
[11:31] said though as though I have already
[11:34] obtained uh we are already perfect he
[11:36] said but I follow after if that I may
[11:39] apprehend that from which I am
[11:41] apprehended of Christ Jesus now Brethren
[11:44] I I count not myself to have apprehended
[11:46] and I just love the humility of this
[11:48] apostle that he just says it out
[11:50] straight now I don't really think that
[11:52] I'm perfect he said but now I'm going to
[11:54] teach you something that I do he said I
[11:57] count not myself as apprehend ended but
[11:59] this one thing I do I'm forgetting the
[12:03] things which are behind and reaching
[12:06] forth unto things which are
[12:09] before now forgetting those things which
[12:12] are behind now uh some time ago I did a
[12:15] a big portion of a subject on things you
[12:18] know uh because things is pretty uh
[12:20] pretty General so uh I think it says it
[12:23] that we for you as an individual that
[12:25] you might be able to divide what things
[12:27] mean cuz things to me means one thing
[12:29] things to you May mean a different thing
[12:32] you remember on the road to EMAs when
[12:34] Jesus met them after the resurrection
[12:36] and they were saddened in heart and they
[12:38] had conversation and he said he said
[12:40] what's the matter they said have you not
[12:41] heard about things and he said what
[12:42] things uh so there were things that were
[12:45] happening in that season there's things
[12:47] that happen uh in the day we're living
[12:49] but one thing I do know that all things
[12:51] work together for the good of them that
[12:54] love God and are called according to his
[12:56] purpose so all things work amen but
[12:59] there are some of these things that
[13:01] happen that we must be able to uh uh to
[13:04] to leave behind as we reach forth under
[13:07] things which are before he said now see
[13:09] I press toward the Mark I like that word
[13:12] press just Thursday we spent some time
[13:14] on pressing the battle I press toward
[13:17] the mark of the prize of the High
[13:19] Calling of of God in Christ Jesus now
[13:22] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[13:25] be thus minded isn't that powerful he
[13:29] amen he he he says now this is the thing
[13:31] that I do and that any that are uh
[13:34] perfect now this has got to go into the
[13:36] Greek to understand this this is teos
[13:39] this is not noos or nepos you know that
[13:42] Greek Spanish that we speak uh it it's
[13:44] not that word is tellos which means of
[13:47] full maturity amen so in other words
[13:50] them that are of full maturity be thus
[13:53] minded that if anything you be otherwise
[13:57] minded that God shall reveal this even
[14:00] unto you now what's he saying
[14:02] nevertheless where we should already
[14:04] obtain let us walk by the same Rule and
[14:07] let us mind the same thing so Paul is
[14:10] saying that he had a great aim or a
[14:12] great purpose in life and I believe
[14:14] that's one of the great things that
[14:15] we've got to realize is we got to ask
[14:17] ourselves what is the real goal of our
[14:19] life what is the real goal as a person
[14:22] as a Christian what is the top goal of
[14:24] your life because some goals are going
[14:26] to have to have priority over others you
[14:28] know and you get goals and you say to
[14:30] yourself I'd like to do this well I tell
[14:33] you what you can't do you you can't lose
[14:35] weight and eat cake at the same time and
[14:38] you know mean you got to make a decision
[14:39] what's your goal I want this cake or I
[14:41] want this weight off you know and and
[14:43] you can tell sometimes the cake wins but
[14:46] but you got to make a decision on what
[14:48] your real goal is you see there are some
[14:51] things that if you're going to have this
[14:54] goal then it's going to cost you some
[14:56] things and and what Paul is saying that
[14:59] he had to forget some things to perform
[15:02] the goal that he had and he was saying
[15:04] if I could get everybody in this mind
[15:06] and he was saying look if if if you're
[15:08] not actually in this mind I pray God
[15:11] reveal this to you that that there is a
[15:14] power in this there's a single-minded in
[15:16] this this one thing that I do in other
[15:19] words he has a he has a purpose and his
[15:22] purpose is actually single-minded in
[15:24] Psalms 27 it was David the king Amen in
[15:28] the 20 in the verse he said one thing
[15:30] that I have desired of the Lord so
[15:33] single-mindedness is something the way a
[15:36] king thinks now now I I I mean we're
[15:39] Pastor Here Am me the church is is a
[15:41] nice siiz Church in the message but as
[15:43] far as people goes it's a it's a it's
[15:45] not a very big church as far as people
[15:47] go when you're thinking about a king
[15:49] over Israel amen that was a vast Kingdom
[15:53] and there were vast problems and there
[15:55] were every kind of level of situation
[15:58] coming to him on a daily basis and David
[16:01] this man over this whole political world
[16:04] Amen could say one thing have I desired
[16:07] of the Lord now think about a
[16:09] single-mindedness of that man that
[16:11] whatever else was happening his desire
[16:14] was not leaving that he would dwell in
[16:16] the house of the Lord and I believe this
[16:18] morning that Amen to to keep our goal to
[16:21] keep our perspective in mind is what
[16:24] keeps us pressing into the promises of
[16:27] God it's a single purpose and and I
[16:30] believe this is what is owed to the
[16:32] extraordinary Ministry of Paul and if
[16:34] you want to be an extraordinary
[16:36] Christian an extraordinary person that
[16:38] lives with happiness and joy amen and
[16:41] you have a great victory in your life
[16:43] then this is a rule you're going to have
[16:45] to live that some things go with you and
[16:48] some things stay behind you some things
[16:51] are not worth letting something control
[16:53] your life I say this often I cannot help
[16:56] what someone does to me I only can help
[16:58] how I respond to what someone does to me
[17:01] I can't I can't control everything and
[17:03] everybody I can't control that guy at
[17:06] the red light that won't get off of his
[17:07] phone and move but I can control how I
[17:10] respond to the guy at the are you
[17:12] hearing me here I I I can't I can't
[17:14] control amen amen how long the guy in
[17:17] front of me takes at the cast Regester
[17:19] but I can control how I react to that
[17:22] you you see if it's somebody got your
[17:24] seat this morning now you can't control
[17:27] that they said mostly you can't control
[17:29] that they sit there but you can control
[17:31] how you respond to the person that's set
[17:33] there you see because the control part
[17:36] when you start reacting to what is done
[17:38] then you start getting under the control
[17:41] of whatever is trying to control you
[17:43] amen other words if you got your buttons
[17:45] on the outside then there is people that
[17:47] can completely control your life but I
[17:50] say this this morning amen I I'm not
[17:52] going to let the devil control me by
[17:55] someone's bad attitude or by somebody's
[17:58] impatience or some situation I'm not
[18:00] going to give that kind of control of my
[18:03] life to another person amen do you see
[18:06] then then God gave unto me the ability
[18:09] of forgiveness and he gave to me the
[18:11] ability to set aside things that are
[18:14] troubling and problems amen can I I'll
[18:17] say this as my mama used to say it's a
[18:18] good saying amen she said holding a
[18:20] grudge against somebody he said it's
[18:22] like drinking poison and and wishing it
[18:24] killed them amen because it doesn't
[18:27] affect the other person it affects you
[18:29] as an individual amen now watch the amen
[18:33] here amen when you're looking at this he
[18:35] said now let us let us let us be able
[18:38] Amen to forget some things that we might
[18:40] be able to press on now I I don't
[18:42] believe Paul was speaking completely
[18:45] forgetting everything because uh because
[18:47] that was uh Ephesians chapter 2 remember
[18:50] he starts talking about memories
[18:52] remember these things and and the Bible
[18:54] talks about memorials that were built
[18:56] for remembrance so God does use your
[18:58] memory to to remind you of great
[19:01] victories of joy and what would put
[19:03] Worship in your heart and and what God
[19:06] has done to you good so those areas of
[19:08] your memory are are memories that you
[19:10] should memorialize and you should keep
[19:12] them places but there are other things
[19:14] that the devil are using to destroy and
[19:17] control and to manipulate your life and
[19:20] those areas are the on Amen that you
[19:22] take them out and you say well you can't
[19:24] ride with me no more I I'm going to go
[19:26] but I got no place in my bags I I'm
[19:29] going to travel on I'm going to move on
[19:31] from this
[19:33] place anybody ever feel like moving
[19:36] on you ever just get it in your mind
[19:38] I've been around this mountain long
[19:40] enough I'm ready to move on have you
[19:42] ever have you ever years ago now I'm not
[19:45] going to tell it amen but I'll say Amen
[19:47] they're going to have more memes if I do
[19:49] amen but I'll say this amen there are
[19:51] just times that you just got to move on
[19:53] you know you've been standing there long
[19:56] enough you've been dealing with this
[19:57] long enough so you want Tove move on
[19:59] well amen I believe this morning that
[20:01] it's moving on time they sang the song
[20:03] Moving on let's move on there's some
[20:06] situations that it's time to move on now
[20:08] I know sometimes you have to deal with
[20:11] it in your mind of how can I move on you
[20:14] know uh some may maybe you have been uh
[20:16] involved in a church or maybe sometimes
[20:19] most everybody in here has been to
[20:20] church and this one or that one or
[20:22] somewhere else or amen some people's
[20:24] been involved in things that were wrong
[20:26] they they they followed after maybe some
[20:28] kind of a te or they got under an
[20:29] influence or maybe they felt like they'd
[20:31] been too long in a certain spot and when
[20:34] they move on Amen the confusion is is
[20:37] how much of what I was in was good and
[20:40] how much of it was bad is that right
[20:43] amen now I I know from experience that
[20:45] there are places in my life amen that I
[20:48] was under a wrong influence I was under
[20:50] a wrong idea about scripture or I was
[20:53] something like that but you can't throw
[20:55] away your entire experience with God you
[20:59] get rid of the part that was wrong and
[21:02] know that God was dealing with you now
[21:03] the only way I know to explain this to
[21:05] you is life is life itself and you go to
[21:09] maybe a tree or you go to the best way
[21:12] to explain it brother Kyle is like with
[21:13] a corn you go to a corn plant and him
[21:15] and I were discussing this the other day
[21:17] you go to a corn plant and you look at a
[21:19] corn plant amen and right now the stocks
[21:21] are big the fields are full but come
[21:23] back in February there won't be nothing
[21:25] of that corn plant left but there's a
[21:27] seed somewhere
[21:29] amen now that seed could look back on
[21:31] that on that field and say well amen was
[21:34] I right was I wrong I I come through
[21:37] that field should I should is there
[21:39] something wrong with me because I was
[21:40] there or because some situation was
[21:42] there amen but see the moment that corn
[21:45] comes up out of the ground the life is
[21:47] right the life is right now maybe the
[21:50] situation where the life is ain't right
[21:53] and it's passing through a stage of corn
[21:56] amen but it's gone its way somewhere
[21:59] so the the life decides as it moves to
[22:02] the Shu amen as it moves to the stock
[22:05] what part stays and what part goes on
[22:07] but see when life moves it's constantly
[22:10] moving toward seed life so some of you
[22:12] sitting here this morning I I would say
[22:14] it probably goes with all of us that
[22:16] there has been places in your life that
[22:19] your that your life moves on your life
[22:21] moves on into Christianity it moves on
[22:23] into the message but the ideas you were
[22:26] told about that text didn't move on with
[22:28] you you or that that scripture that was
[22:31] twisted to you amen you started trying
[22:33] to grow and you found that that couldn't
[22:36] come with you that quote that was being
[22:38] misused on you you found out it couldn't
[22:41] come with you but the life was right the
[22:44] minute that you come to God and that
[22:46] seed in you begin to spring up but to to
[22:49] think because a seed has been in a shook
[22:52] of something wrong with the seed no
[22:54] that's the developmental pattern of a
[22:56] seed but amen after the shook begins to
[22:59] spit out the seed I know some of you get
[23:01] to feeling bad cuz you get amen some
[23:03] some people leave situations and the
[23:06] moment that you get out of the situation
[23:08] amen people turn on you people you think
[23:10] sometimes has been your friends your
[23:12] whole life and you come to a difference
[23:13] in scripture or you come to a difference
[23:15] and and maybe leadership something leads
[23:17] you to do something different or you go
[23:19] somewhere and that the individual just
[23:21] can't let you go they can't let you do
[23:23] what you feel led so all of a sudden
[23:25] you're you're you're uh well might as
[23:28] well say it you know all of a sudden
[23:30] amen because you leave a church all of a
[23:32] sudden you're going to go to hell well I
[23:34] think if you're a Christian you're a
[23:36] Christian if you're in this church or
[23:37] another way I don't think you got to go
[23:39] to True Word Tabernacle to go in the
[23:41] Rapture I don't think you have to be
[23:43] under our ministry Amen to be a part of
[23:45] the bride of Christ if you're a
[23:47] Christian the Bible said the sons of God
[23:49] are led by the spirit of God and where
[23:51] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[23:53] liberty liberty to follow God Liberty to
[23:57] believe God Liberty to love God now now
[24:01] but yet you come into them situations
[24:03] amen and then because you made a choice
[24:05] or a decision to follow the lord then
[24:08] pressure is put on you and he said well
[24:10] you must been wrong you must be wrong
[24:12] you must be wrong but there are places
[24:14] in your life that God calls you to a
[24:17] separation because it's time to move on
[24:21] it's time to move on and when you move
[24:23] on the devil don't want you to move on
[24:25] you can move on physically but he wants
[24:27] to keep a mind battle he wants to stay
[24:29] in your mind like people will get out of
[24:32] relationships but years later they're
[24:34] still emotionally involved in their mind
[24:37] they ain't seen them in years but they
[24:39] say there's an old flame burning you
[24:41] know there's an emotional connection
[24:43] even when there's not a physical
[24:45] connection but there are some things you
[24:47] just burn the bridge there are some
[24:50] things you got to leave behind you that
[24:52] you go on with God and I'm talking about
[24:56] something that whenever you gather
[24:57] yourself and say look amen I belong to
[25:00] the Lord I'm running a race of God I've
[25:03] got a purpose and mind amen then that
[25:05] motive is Hebrews chapter 12 the Bible
[25:07] said wherefore and we're comp passed
[25:09] about with a great cloud of witness let
[25:11] us lay aside every
[25:14] weight and every sin which do so easily
[25:18] beset us and let us run let us run the
[25:23] patience the race that is set before us
[25:25] looking unto Jesus who is the author
[25:28] author and the finisher of our faith for
[25:31] the joy that was set before him there it
[25:33] is folks the joy that was set before him
[25:36] he couldn't have you and have his life
[25:38] he couldn't have you and have amen he
[25:41] couldn't have you and have a family he
[25:43] couldn't have you and have children and
[25:45] a home and a job and he couldn't live a
[25:47] normal life because he had a joy that
[25:50] was set before him some things had to
[25:53] stay and some things had to go I thank
[25:56] God he chose me
[26:00] and because he chose me I choose
[26:03] him I choose to serve him and there's
[26:07] areas of Our Lives where the Bible says
[26:09] it like this lay aside every weight and
[26:12] every sin that so do easily beset us I
[26:15] think we could sometimes maybe we could
[26:17] just come and have a laying aside
[26:19] service amen would y'all enjoy that a
[26:21] laying aside service laying aside laying
[26:25] aside situations laying aside
[26:26] discouragements laying aside problems
[26:29] laying aside arguments laying aside amen
[26:31] amen things that have happened in the
[26:34] past of Our Lives amen isn't it odd even
[26:36] young people suffer with these things
[26:39] amen just lay it aside amen there are
[26:42] times in your life you just got to let
[26:45] go you got to let go of all of it amen
[26:48] and go on with
[26:50] God hallelujah lay aside every weight
[26:54] and every sin that so dis easily beset
[26:57] you I I I don't mean to stay here and
[26:59] preach on this I don't have time but I I
[27:01] feel it amen I feel it in every sin that
[27:05] so easily beset you do you know what the
[27:07] devil's trying to do look he can't stop
[27:10] you you all you all understand there's a
[27:13] predestination on your life that I don't
[27:15] care how many Devils pile up against you
[27:17] he's never going to stop you so what
[27:19] he's trying to do is beset you he's
[27:22] trying to beset you to try to make your
[27:24] action Slumber he tries to make you
[27:27] tired and weary so you can't travel on
[27:30] Amen and if you're going to travel he
[27:31] wants you to travel nervous and
[27:33] discouraged he wants to be sure that you
[27:35] don't encourage a friend or a brother he
[27:38] wants to keep you beat down and helpless
[27:40] amen and barely travel along but brother
[27:43] I say that we ought to lay aside
[27:46] whatever sin it is that's besetting just
[27:48] lay the thing aside and say Satan I
[27:51] spent enough time with you on this I
[27:53] spent enough hours on this I am ready to
[27:56] move on with God I might have clear mind
[28:00] and understanding hallelujah hallelujah
[28:04] I believe it I believe a time for moving
[28:06] on we used to sing an old song I don't
[28:09] know if Ben sings it but amen we used to
[28:11] sing an old song when I was a kid down

[30:33] rain they're just dancing and they're
[30:35] just enjoying it what is it because the
[30:37] rain was coming it wasn't something to
[30:40] it wasn't something to look bad at amen
[30:42] and we sometimes have to learn how to
[30:45] have joy in the midst of suffering we
[30:48] got to learn how to have joy in the
[30:50] middle of our trials I don't know about
[30:52] you but it's pressing on time it's time
[30:54] to press the battle it's time to take a
[30:57] step God Amen tell that devil I got my
[31:00] shoes on I won't stay another day in the
[31:04] Despair and depression that you try to
[31:06] put on my mind I can walk right out of
[31:09] here brother I'm walking with God I'm
[31:11] talking with God and when a man begins
[31:14] to walk and talk with God all kinds of
[31:16] things
[31:18] happen hey there was a woman in the
[31:20] Bible that believed Elijah amen and God
[31:23] raised her baby from the dead and years
[31:26] later they're telling the story story to
[31:28] the king amen and the King's wondering
[31:30] whether he could believe it or not amen
[31:32] and somebody looked over and said well
[31:33] here comes the here comes the boy the
[31:35] woman
[31:36] now here comes the woman now amen or was
[31:40] it the boy it was the woman wasn't it
[31:42] here comes the woman now walked right in
[31:43] the presence of the king while the story
[31:45] was being told of her Resurrection come
[31:47] on Sunday school teacher it was the it
[31:49] was the woman it was both here come the
[31:51] woman thank you amen here come the woman
[31:53] and the boy and they walked right in the
[31:55] presence of it and when they got right
[31:57] in there the king amen he took an
[31:59] officer of his court and said go with
[32:02] this woman and restore her everything
[32:05] that she lost during this famine you
[32:07] give her all of it back so when she went
[32:09] to walk in the land brother she wasn't
[32:11] walking by herself she went with an
[32:14] authority that when she said this
[32:16] belongs to me and this belongs to me and
[32:18] this belongs to me the king's court was
[32:20] there to give back to her whatever it
[32:23] was and listen I know you walk through
[32:25] the Bible this morning some of you walk
[32:27] through the message today don't you walk
[32:29] by yourself get with a get with a chief
[32:32] sheriff of God's court and let him let
[32:35] him as you say this belongs to me this
[32:36] belongs to me just start walking that
[32:42] out I don't know what kind of shoes you
[32:46] wore but mine's devil stomping
[32:55] shoes you ever wear devil stomping shoes
[32:58] you ever just have a devil stomping
[33:02] service you ever have one of them will
[33:05] you just come on young people you ever
[33:07] get a devil stomping service where you
[33:09] just feel like stomping on the head of
[33:11] the enemy he's been hissing all week
[33:14] long oh serpent just hissing and biting
[33:17] at your heels all we brother Aaron put
[33:20] your shoes on now I I'll tell you this
[33:23] it ain't good to stomp on a copper head
[33:25] with bare feet
[33:27] that's right but if you put your shoes
[33:31] on you got to ride see this doesn't mean
[33:35] that everything that's behind you is
[33:40] bad not everything that you've come
[33:43] through needs to be left behind you but
[33:47] life will make the choice if you can
[33:50] live for God with it if you can serve
[33:52] god with joy if it ushers you into the
[33:54] presence of God remember that
[33:58] but when it besets
[34:00] you when it destroys your confidence in
[34:03] God then that's when you begin to leave
[34:06] it behind do you know what Moses did
[34:09] it's scriptural now Exodus 14:15 the
[34:11] Lord said unto Moses why cry thou to me
[34:15] speak unto this children of Israel that
[34:17] they may go
[34:18] forward well I don't know if you read
[34:21] the scripture where this happens Moses
[34:23] is standing at the Red
[34:25] Sea now he's he
[34:28] amen he he this is not a simple matter
[34:31] he's dealing with he's standing at the
[34:34] Red Sea and he's got an army behind him
[34:36] he's got a sea in front of him and he
[34:38] goes to God with great care and concern
[34:41] for his people and he gets down and
[34:44] starts crying to the Lord Lord help us
[34:46] out of this and God says Don't Cry To
[34:55] Me Speak the word
[34:58] right and go
[35:00] forward have not I sent
[35:03] thee now in Exodus if you read back in
[35:06] Exodus 3 the Bible said that the pillar
[35:09] of fire appeared to him on Mount Horeb
[35:11] and that Pillar of Fire gave him a
[35:13] direct Revelation and said go down unto
[35:16] Egypt and I'm going to deliver the
[35:18] children of Israel by thee amen the
[35:20] Bible said I will go down he said but he
[35:22] was the one Moses is the one who went
[35:23] down amen and he called them people out
[35:26] of Egypt by the pillar of Fire
[35:28] but that's not the whole story there he
[35:30] said and I will deliver them into a
[35:34] land but you find out the scripture
[35:37] actually says that God told Moses go get
[35:40] him and come back on this mountain and
[35:43] worship
[35:44] me I think now now that's one thing okay
[35:47] okay you uh uh go get the people and
[35:49] meet me on the mountain and you can
[35:51] worship there on that mountain God
[35:53] didn't tell him there was a Red Sea in
[35:54] the
[35:55] way God did not tell tell him look Moses
[35:58] didn't Moses wasn't out in the
[36:00] wilderness just walking around by his
[36:01] own accord he was under a direct
[36:04] leadership of the pillar of fire and it
[36:06] led him right to the place he was so he
[36:09] couldn't argue with the leadership he
[36:11] could see the pillar of fire and and
[36:13] watch if God leads you to a place that
[36:16] seems like it cannot be done it cannot
[36:20] be passed it's a situation it's too high
[36:23] it's too wide it's too terrible there
[36:26] too much trouble but God LED you to that
[36:28] place then God has a way across that
[36:32] place for you and brother Ram actually
[36:34] said it he said Moses was led to that
[36:36] place so God could teach us that when
[36:39] there is no way God Will Make A Way and
[36:43] I say this morning he's still a way
[36:46] maker he's still the god that can make
[36:48] way where there is no way he's a God
[36:51] that can perform his word no matter what
[36:54] our thoughts of it is he cannot lie
[36:57] folks we've got to get it in our heart
[36:59] God cannot lie if God said we're going
[37:02] to that mountain brother we're going to
[37:04] the mountain it doesn't make a
[37:06] difference if there's a sea in the way
[37:08] if there's an Army in the way God will
[37:11] move the sea and he will drown the Army
[37:14] but we're going to go to the mountain
[37:16] that he said we're going to go to and if
[37:18] your mountain is healing this morning I
[37:21] say if there's a red sea between you and
[37:23] you're healing Mount up with Eagle's
[37:26] Wings and God will carry us or we'll
[37:28] walk through the trouble of it but we're
[37:30] going to this
[37:32] mountain we're going to take this
[37:35] mountain God didn't tell him he was
[37:37] going to run into
[37:39] that so when he ran into it he of course
[37:42] he said to God how we supposed to get
[37:45] across this he said don't cry to
[37:48] me you speak the word and go forward
[37:51] brother Bram said what word he said the
[37:52] word of
[37:53] God you speak it don't you cry you speak
[37:57] it and go forward now here's the thing
[38:00] the people the people got in a spirit of
[38:03] discouragement at that and y'all
[38:04] remember what they wanted to do they
[38:07] wanted to go
[38:09] back right so that part of their memory
[38:14] should have been left in Egypt right but
[38:18] they wanted to return to the garlic
[38:23] pots they wanted to go back to bondage
[38:27] prac to
[38:29] slavery see the difficulty because they
[38:32] were carrying that in their mind the
[38:35] difficulty brought out what they had in
[38:38] their
[38:39] mind but God wanted to show them that's
[38:42] never been for you it's not for you so
[38:44] he opened up and parted the Red Sea and
[38:46] I know you all know the story of the Red
[38:48] Sea so we're not really preaching on the
[38:49] Red Sea we're preaching on your Red Sea
[38:53] we're preaching about your situation
[38:55] we're talking about your Red Sea the
[38:57] place that you have come to and you know
[39:00] God said you're going to go to a certain
[39:02] place but there's something between you
[39:04] and that it's called opposition well let
[39:06] me ask you do you lay down and die on
[39:09] the bank or do you say God sent me to
[39:12] this so I'm more than able to conquer
[39:15] this and this Devil's got to get out of
[39:18] my way because God is here to do it and
[39:21] the fire that they have been following
[39:23] now went in behind them listen brother
[39:26] there's something that back this message
[39:28] up God went behind them and turned
[39:31] Darkness into Egypt and lied into Israel
[39:34] and opened the way and they went across
[39:35] on dry triod I've always loved that I've
[39:39] always loved it God said they stomped it
[39:41] enough they stomped enough mud you just
[39:43] take them through and they're not going
[39:44] to stomp any mud you just take them on
[39:46] through and they walked across on dry
[39:48] trod amen sister Robson I imagine amen a
[39:51] little while into the journey some of
[39:53] them weigh in the back you know amen
[39:55] they were they were they were following
[39:57] they were in the same journey together
[39:59] amen but they got to hear a noise and
[40:01] they couldn't figure out what the noise
[40:03] was was there was there Egyptians on the
[40:05] other bank was there destruction and War
[40:08] on the other bank amen but I imagine
[40:11] when somebody Whispers say hey but
[40:12] what's going on up there the word
[40:14] traveled no cell phones you know the
[40:16] word traveled up the line what's it
[40:18] happening and here comes the word back
[40:20] down the line well somebody broke
[40:22] through to the other side and those are
[40:25] sounds of Victory not sounds of War
[40:28] it sounds of someone has broke out on
[40:30] the other side and they're saying that
[40:32] there's peace on the other side the let
[40:36] me say this that that the Egypt is not
[40:38] on the other side Egypt died in that in
[40:42] that sea which tied the red blood of
[40:44] Jesus Amen and when they turned and
[40:47] looked I I can't preach for preaching
[40:49] I'm sorry amen but when they turned to
[40:51] look amen I thought it was powerful that
[40:54] God just took the wheels off their
[40:56] chariots and and and they and they were
[40:58] just stuck in the mud out in the middle
[41:00] of a sea and then God turns the water
[41:03] loose and drowns them and the Bible lets
[41:06] us know that when they got on the other
[41:08] side that they could look back and see
[41:10] that their enemy was
[41:12] dead now now they seen their enemy was
[41:15] dead that was the cause of the Great
[41:18] Victory on the battle or in the Realms
[41:20] of the Red Sea the great cause of it is
[41:23] we are on the other side of this but our
[41:26] enemy is dead
[41:28] brother you talk about dancing time we
[41:31] are on the other side of this and our
[41:33] Devil Is Dead the thing that has
[41:36] oppressed you died in the journey the
[41:39] thing that was behind you that haunted
[41:42] you that tried to destroy you it died
[41:44] behind you it died in the blood of Jesus
[41:47] Christ oh I tell you this morning I say
[41:50] death to every Spirit of Oppression
[41:53] every Spirit of anxiety and neurotics
[41:56] that's in this age amen put it in the
[41:58] blood of Jesus and let it die in your
[42:01] journey this morning I I just I can't
[42:03] help it I just got to preach folks when
[42:05] they got on the other side of that they
[42:07] picked up a tambourine and begin to play
[42:09] amen and I I know seems like that's
[42:11] controversial these days but but but but
[42:14] anyhow amen they picked up a tambourine
[42:16] and played and when they got to play in
[42:18] that tambourine amen the spirit of
[42:20] Victory got to coming down in that in
[42:23] that assembly amen I mean on that bank
[42:25] and when they got to playing amen the
[42:27] Bible tells us that all the women join
[42:31] Miriam I've done a study one time on
[42:33] demographics of males and females of two
[42:35] million people and I think they said it
[42:37] was much over 200,000 women would have
[42:39] been a
[42:40] part of that shouting meeting
[42:44] wow now I don't know I was in a meeting
[42:48] in Africa with about 5,000 there in the
[42:49] Ivory Coast and the biggest one ever was
[42:51] about 25,000 there in Zimbabwe and it
[42:55] was loud brother
[42:57] I mean it was roaring loud it was
[42:59] shaking the stadium the soccer stadium
[43:01] just shook amen under the rejoicing but
[43:06] 200,000 200,000 sisters amen that didn't
[43:10] have to make another
[43:11] brick 200,000 women I don't know if you
[43:14] understand what they were out of 200,000
[43:16] women amen that had their babies fed to
[43:19] alligators and had Egyptian soldiers
[43:22] knocking their babies in their head so
[43:24] they couldn't even have their children
[43:25] they couldn't raise their son
[43:27] amen Egypt was taking every bit of their
[43:30] offspring but now they had put on their
[43:33] shoes and they had come out of Egypt and
[43:36] they had crossed the river and they had
[43:38] went to a place where Egypt can't bother
[43:41] our children anymore hallelujah
[43:44] hallelujah to God think about it this
[43:47] morning there a place there's a place I
[43:50] know Egypt would like to get every
[43:52] newborn child every new birth every
[43:55] child coming forth out of the Church
[43:57] he'd like to tackle them and take them
[43:59] down listen we're in a place this
[44:01] morning where Satan cannot touch them we
[44:04] have come to The Place Beyond The Riven
[44:06] Veil where the power of God drops in
[44:09] upon the church brother they got to
[44:11] shouting and
[44:15] rejoicing
[44:17] hallelujah what a what a beautiful
[44:22] thing well I know there's a lot of
[44:25] discussion about these things
[44:27] about these holy ghost meetings and
[44:29] things brother Bram said but we can't
[44:31] have a healing service till we get the
[44:33] people in the spirit of
[44:36] healing and we cannot have a holy ghost
[44:39] have a feeling of the Holy Ghost until
[44:41] people gets in that kind of
[44:44] atmosphere people was in atmosphere in
[44:46] the day that brings judgment on this
[44:48] Earth we can't have judgment on this
[44:50] America till they get in the spirit of
[44:52] judgment you can't have a holy ghost
[44:54] meeting till you get in the spirit of
[44:56] the Holy Ghost meeting
[44:57] yeah yeah it's a it's a pretty powerful
[45:00] thing I know sometimes that atmosphere
[45:02] scares things but mostly what it scares
[45:03] is the
[45:05] devil cuz that's the kind of atmosphere
[45:07] Devils die
[45:08] in that's kind of atmosphere where
[45:10] births happen in do you see what it is
[45:13] you can't have it till you get in the
[45:15] spirit of
[45:17] it my God I want to get in the spirit of
[45:21] it do you see in the power of decision
[45:23] brother brandham says it he said one
[45:25] time an old prophet got all stared up
[45:29] because somebody come to see him you
[45:31] remember back in the scripture when
[45:33] Jehoshaphat came and got Elisha because
[45:36] he had poured water on the hands of
[45:38] Elijah and the the Army got in real
[45:39] trouble and they had got dry and the
[45:42] Bible said they've been seven days out
[45:43] in the desert and it took to a real
[45:45] dryness there and they didn't have any
[45:47] water so they went and got Elisha and
[45:49] they brought him out there Elisha was in
[45:51] a bad mood about it he didn't want to
[45:53] answer no
[45:55] questions he didn't want to answer no
[45:57] questions of why things were the way
[45:59] they
[45:59] were you so he he was in a bad mood
[46:02] about
[46:03] it brother Braham had some things say
[46:05] about where Elisha was he said he
[46:07] wouldn't even look at them had they not
[46:10] been the presence of
[46:11] Jehoshaphat
[46:13] now look what they did to change him he
[46:17] said they brought him a
[46:20] Minstrel 2 Kings 3 if you'd like to read
[46:22] it and they brought him a Minstrel and
[46:25] it came to pass that that when the
[46:27] menstral
[46:28] played the hand of the Lord came upon
[46:32] him now watch some people don't like
[46:36] music and worship yeah true but it
[46:40] changed the attitude of a
[46:43] prophet you don't think it won't change
[46:45] your
[46:47] attitude sure it will it'll change the
[46:50] way you feel sitting even in a service
[46:52] under the worship and the spirit moving
[46:55] it'll change the way you feel now Watch
[46:57] What Happens that music comes and bring
[47:00] a minstral and when they begin to play
[47:03] the hand of the Lord come upon him and
[47:05] he said thus saith the Lord make this
[47:09] Valley full of ditches and brother B
[47:11] draws from that he says watch now he
[47:13] said it was a supernatural he said where
[47:16] man's senses are limited but a man in
[47:19] his spirit is
[47:21] unlimited now the tree of knowledge can
[47:23] take a man so far and then knowledge
[47:26] breaks back but the Tree of Life Goes On
[47:29] see how science has taken man farther
[47:33] with five senses than we have with his
[47:37] soul now watch this we'll have got
[47:40] untapped
[47:42] resources all things are possible now
[47:45] don't let this fall simply on your
[47:48] heart when he got in the spirit he saw
[47:51] the possibility of water in a dry
[47:54] place isn't that amazing that the desert
[47:57] didn't
[47:59] change none of the armies were any
[48:02] different that was nothing different but
[48:03] they got to play in some music and the
[48:06] prophet drifted in the spirit and he
[48:09] looked at the same dry place and saw
[48:12] water but in the spirit you see things
[48:15] that are not there
[48:17] yet when a man gets in the spirit he
[48:20] looks at things
[48:22] differently amen I know sometimes we
[48:24] seem like Fanatics when we start saying
[48:26] a thing a certain way and you're
[48:27] thinking my goodness it ain't that way
[48:29] at all but if you get in the spirit it
[48:31] changes when you get in the spirit
[48:34] things look different watch amen uh the
[48:36] tree of knowledge can change your mind
[48:39] on things they can they can they can
[48:41] take you up that tree and make you look
[48:43] different at atoms they can make you
[48:45] look different at genetics they can make
[48:47] you look different at physical things
[48:49] and sicknesses and that kind you can get
[48:51] on their tree and they can change your
[48:53] view of things but there's a tree of of
[48:57] life and the spirit from that tree of
[48:59] life has come and it can pack you up it
[49:02] can pick you up and pack you into places
[49:05] where you believe things are possible
[49:07] that you can't see you can't taste them
[49:10] you can't feel them you can't hear them
[49:12] they're not even there but you can move
[49:13] forward into them what is it amen
[49:16] there's a place of untapped resources
[49:18] when you get into the spirit of it now
[49:20] the Bible says in Revelation chap 4 amen
[49:23] that when John was standing in the age
[49:25] of leoda and he was describing a very
[49:28] horrible scene he was describing but the
[49:31] Bible says after this I looked and
[49:33] behold a door was opened up in heaven
[49:36] and the voice which I heard was a
[49:37] trumpet talking we said come up hither
[49:41] John isn't that something amen that God
[49:44] wanted to change the direction and the
[49:46] view of this man of God but he had to
[49:49] call him up to do it and the Bible said
[49:51] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[49:54] I beheld the throne that was in heaven
[49:57] amen he went from looking at leosia to
[49:59] looking to the throne of God when a man
[50:01] gets in the spirit you go to from seeing
[50:04] the carnal natural things that are
[50:06] around you and you start seeing the
[50:08] Throne of God immediately I was in the
[50:11] spirit come up here and I will show you
[50:14] things in the future you want to talk
[50:17] about memory amen isn't it odd how we
[50:19] remember things but you know what we
[50:21] ought to be able to remember the past
[50:23] but we ought to be able to remember the
[50:24] future I don't have time preach on it
[50:26] all this morning but I want to just lay
[50:28] it out there to you a little bit amen do
[50:29] you ever think about remembering the
[50:31] future amen you you say well I remember
[50:34] the past and you remembered as if if you
[50:36] were there and and it went on so far
[50:38] here while back I preached on word
[50:39] memory anybody remember that trading the
[50:41] finite for the infinite the word memory
[50:44] uh let me put it like this your mom told
[50:46] you what day you were born told you what
[50:48] the hospital was like she told you they
[50:50] took you home in a certain C and after a
[50:52] little while that becomes your memory
[50:54] because you receive your Mom's memory as
[50:56] your memory well the word of God is
[50:59] God's memory and it restores your memory
[51:03] to who you are if you listen to brother
[51:04] Ram a lot of times when he starts
[51:06] talking about amen the past life the the
[51:10] the seed he'll say now
[51:12] remember yeah he'll start by saying now
[51:15] remember before you were here you had to
[51:18] be somewhere else I don't remember
[51:21] brother brandom let me remind you you
[51:24] were in the mind of God you were an
[51:26] attribute of God when job said to Job
[51:29] where were the sons of God when you were
[51:31] sh let me remind you that that's where
[51:33] you
[51:34] were you see now there's the thing about
[51:37] it right Adam forgot didn't Adam forget
[51:40] isn't that really what happened Adam
[51:41] forgot how to create and Adam forgot how
[51:43] to speak the word and Adam forgot how to
[51:46] recreate himself in that spiritual world
[51:48] Amen but here we are in the last day and
[51:51] we're going to be reminded of the thing
[51:53] that Adam forgot but we're not just
[51:56] reminded of the past we are reminded of
[52:00] the
[52:01] future God God's word has just as good
[52:04] in the future as it is in the
[52:07] past it's just as much memory of what
[52:10] was and what is brother Ram stands and
[52:13] talks to a woman said now I'll just say
[52:15] this you're going to be healed he said
[52:18] well then you have a right to doubt that
[52:21] because you don't know what your future
[52:23] holds but he says but if you know what
[52:26] it's being you know whether it's true or
[52:28] not and that's right Jesus Christ
[52:32] brother R said this so if he knows what
[52:34] has been certainly he would know if he
[52:37] could tell you what was you would have
[52:40] confidence to know what he says will be
[52:44] correct because it would be good see it
[52:47] would be God would you believe it would
[52:50] you Jesus would believe it see now what
[52:53] is it
[52:54] amen there is a memory of
[52:57] past and there's a memory of
[52:59] future I was just reading this yesterday
[53:02] and I was just reminding the
[53:04] devil of his
[53:07] future did you ever remind people of
[53:10] what's
[53:12] coming you ever just remind them this is
[53:14] coming well this is
[53:16] coming and I was reading how the four
[53:18] seal brother Bram says it like this he
[53:20] said listen goats didn't cover it but
[53:23] did not remit it until the real bleach
[53:25] came that could take the stain of sin
[53:28] and break it completely to pieces to
[53:31] send it back upon the original perverter
[53:35] that was Satan when it got back to Satan
[53:39] he waits until the time of Eternal
[53:42] Annihilation somebody help me say it
[53:44] Annihilation Anil Eternal Annihilation
[53:48] now that shows What We believe We
[53:51] believe that he will be absolutely
[53:55] completely done away away and
[53:59] annihilated I'm just reminding Satan
[54:02] here I just want Satan to be
[54:06] reminded watch this in that day on
[54:08] Calvary I believe a man that has eternal
[54:10] life can never die and I believe there
[54:13] is a complete annihilation of a soul
[54:16] that sins for the Bible said the soul
[54:18] that sins shall surely die not the man
[54:20] the soul that sinth so Satan must surely
[54:24] die to be compl completely
[54:27] destroyed how I disagree with the
[54:30] Universalist that say Satan will be
[54:31] saved he sinned and he's the originator
[54:35] of
[54:36] sin his soul sinned and he was a spirit
[54:39] and that Spirit shall be totally
[54:43] annihilated nothing will be left of
[54:47] it in questions and answers in 59
[54:50] brother B said remember I love the way
[54:52] he starts that remember Devils never die
[54:56] Devils always live but there will be a
[55:00] time where Devils have to die because
[55:04] they become totally
[55:07] annihilated what is he talking about he
[55:09] meant that when you get in the spirit
[55:11] you can see
[55:13] it don't cry speak the word and go
[55:17] forward what is it it takes the spirit
[55:20] of God to give you
[55:22] Vision do you see John says here I was
[55:25] in the spirit on the Lord's day isn't
[55:27] that beautiful I love that the whole
[55:30] Christian Life if we're going to ever
[55:32] live as Christians we have to be his
[55:33] sons it had to be his Spirit now John
[55:36] was not talking about being in his own
[55:39] spirit that would have not brought
[55:41] Visions it had to be the spirit of God
[55:43] it has to be the spirit of God with us
[55:46] too all of our efforts are in
[55:49] vain now he says Paul said I pray in the
[55:52] spirit I sing in the spirit I will live
[55:55] in the spirit
[55:56] if there's anything good that will come
[55:58] to me it has to be revealed by the
[56:00] spirit confirmed by the word and made
[56:03] manifest in the results it bears as
[56:05] surely as John needed to be in the
[56:08] spirit to receive these tremendous
[56:11] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[56:14] be in the spirit to understand the
[56:16] revelations that God has given to us to
[56:19] live by in his word for it is the same
[56:23] spirit amen the spirit that John got in
[56:28] that saw those
[56:29] Revelations Are The Same Spirit that
[56:32] you're invited into in the church look
[56:35] what he says see now in Acts 2 the Bible
[56:37] said repent everyone and be baptized and
[56:39] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[56:40] Ghost now they don't see it if they saw
[56:43] it by getting in the spirit they would
[56:45] know that if they want to receive the
[56:48] Holy Spirit they need to repent be
[56:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:52] and be Duty bound God would be to
[56:54] fulfill the fill filling them with the
[56:56] Holy Ghost now they never get in the
[57:00] spirit or it would happen to
[57:03] them exactly as the word says pray to
[57:08] God for Revelation by the spirit see
[57:10] that is the first step get in the
[57:14] spirit now if you put on your traveling
[57:16] shoes and you're trying to get out of
[57:18] something amen what is the first step
[57:21] get in the spirit your first step is get
[57:25] in the spirit so the Revelation can come
[57:27] to you of what God has in mind brother
[57:30] bandam says it like this he said it
[57:32] might not come immediately but in his
[57:35] spirit it's all over how many ever had
[57:37] that happen to you you have that happen
[57:40] where you're praying about something
[57:42] amen and all of a sudden it comes into
[57:44] your spirit that is finished brother
[57:47] it's just as done it's just as done as
[57:50] if you hey you I'll tell you right then
[57:53] you could just rejoice and praise God
[57:56] because it's just as done as anything is
[57:59] done now because you got it in the
[58:02] spirit now when you get it in the spirit
[58:05] it's all over there is no other court of
[58:09] appeal watch he says we need to get in
[58:11] the spirit and then things get done
[58:14] don't go through the ACT first get in
[58:17] the spirit and then go through the act
[58:19] and watch what God will
[58:22] do have you ever noticed how the world
[58:24] gets in the spirit
[58:26] things of the world they go to ball
[58:28] games and sporting events and dances and
[58:30] they enter into the spirit of it now
[58:32] brother Bram said they don't just set
[58:34] like wallf fires old dried up
[58:37] sticks they enter right into the FI of
[58:40] things and become a part of things now
[58:44] let me tell you what would the devil
[58:45] would like to do he' just like to keep
[58:46] you in a place where you just well I you
[58:49] know what I'll go but I won't get in
[58:52] that's what he would like you know what
[58:54] I mean I mean he'd like you set through
[58:55] a whole service and never just open up
[58:57] and say that's right amen he he he don't
[59:00] want you to get into it he don't want
[59:02] you to feel the spirit of it because see
[59:05] if you're going to go somewhere your
[59:06] first step is getting in the spirit of
[59:09] it intellectually it's not going to
[59:11] change
[59:12] you but as you step in the spirit you
[59:14] will catch it and they enter the spirit
[59:16] they don't set like wallf fires or all
[59:18] dried up sticks they enter right into
[59:21] the feel of things and become a part of
[59:23] things oh how they hate the Christians
[59:26] for getting in the spirit of God's word
[59:29] they'll call us Fanatics and holy
[59:32] rollers there is nothing they won't do
[59:35] to show hatred and disapproval but
[59:37] ignore it ignore it ignore it you can
[59:40] expect it knowing where it's coming from
[59:44] just go on worshiping in the spirit just
[59:48] go on in the spirit of worship just go
[59:51] on and get in the spirit of worship you
[59:54] know what I mean when you just don't
[59:55] care no more and you get in the spirit
[59:58] he got in the spirit brother BR said
[1:00:00] before anything took place he got in the
[1:00:02] spirit and before anything can take
[1:00:04] place it was in the spirit and if you'll
[1:00:06] notice in your Bible it was the Holy
[1:00:08] Spirit it was the holy spirit because
[1:00:11] there's a lot of
[1:00:12] spirits right isn't it isn't it true
[1:00:15] there's a lot of spirits now now brother
[1:00:18] random talks about it from The Invasion
[1:00:19] uned States and he tells us that the
[1:00:22] devil landed in Hollywood and is
[1:00:24] invading the United States of America I
[1:00:27] me I've got tons of quotes he said it's
[1:00:30] invaded the United States with demon
[1:00:33] powers Satan left France and came to our
[1:00:37] borders landed in Hollywood amen and has
[1:00:40] filled America with demon powers those
[1:00:43] demons are spirits that's why women cut
[1:00:46] their
[1:00:47] hair you you L do your history lessons
[1:00:51] that's when women started wearing pants
[1:00:53] that's when homosexuality got its
[1:00:55] beginning
[1:00:56] that's when all of these great changes
[1:00:58] begin to hit America was when Hollywood
[1:01:01] begin to evangelize America used to be
[1:01:04] you had to go somewhere to get into
[1:01:05] these things but all of the sudden it
[1:01:07] got to be in a 24-hour sermon in
[1:01:10] people's homes and and demons begin to
[1:01:12] come in demon powers begin to come in
[1:01:15] why because you got to get in the spirit
[1:01:18] before you can do
[1:01:19] it you got to get in the spirit of
[1:01:22] adultery before you can commit it you
[1:01:24] got to get in the spirit of forn ation
[1:01:26] before you commit it you got to get in
[1:01:28] the spirit of drinking before you can
[1:01:30] get drunk come on Church well if that be
[1:01:33] true in the negative what about the
[1:01:35] positive if you're going to have a
[1:01:37] Rapture you got to get in the spirit of
[1:01:39] rapture if you're going to be worshiped
[1:01:41] you got to get in the spirit of worship
[1:01:43] I believe it amen I believe that
[1:01:45] Hollywood invaded America with a vision
[1:01:48] amen from a television but I believe God
[1:01:51] invaded America by the message of the
[1:01:53] hour and gave a vision to the Church a
[1:01:56] vision of body change a vision of
[1:01:59] rapture brother that's the spirit I want
[1:02:01] to get into the spirit that makes me
[1:02:04] lift up my head oh my you see what it is
[1:02:07] Satan sets these powers and it's an
[1:02:10] invasion brother Bram said it's an
[1:02:12] invasion of unclean spirits where people
[1:02:15] are driving them right in it's an
[1:02:17] invasion of the United States of America
[1:02:20] I I I'll read this part perfect strength
[1:02:22] perfect witness brother Bram said the
[1:02:23] lids come off of hell right well that's
[1:02:27] true ain't it the lid has come off of
[1:02:29] hell and streams of demon power is
[1:02:33] pouring from
[1:02:36] everywhere now these demon powers this
[1:02:40] Invasion brother brandom calls them
[1:02:43] enticing
[1:02:45] Spirits now an enticing spirit is
[1:02:48] something that tries to lead you out of
[1:02:50] the word of God it's
[1:02:53] enticing uh brother Bram when ever he
[1:02:56] tries to deal with enticing Spirits he
[1:02:59] always brings up the story of how that
[1:03:03] Micah with stood 400 prophets when there
[1:03:05] was a great battle of Ahab at hand have
[1:03:07] remember that and and there was there
[1:03:09] was a great battle and Ahab was wondered
[1:03:12] whether or not to re to to reclaim rth
[1:03:15] Gilead which was a part of their promise
[1:03:17] but there was a curse on Ahab and God
[1:03:19] had already by Elijah said he was going
[1:03:21] to die and and but they wanted to invade
[1:03:24] this land and so they wanted a spiritual
[1:03:27] instruction so they went to 400 prophets
[1:03:30] and all of them says yes you you go
[1:03:32] right up and then Jehoshaphat you know
[1:03:34] he had he had there was two men there
[1:03:36] right brother B was showing us by that
[1:03:39] story there's two of you there's an
[1:03:40] outward man inner man and he said the
[1:03:42] outward man can hear all the voices but
[1:03:44] the inner man still says I want to hear
[1:03:46] another is there one more because the
[1:03:49] inner man's not satisfied with the voice
[1:03:52] of enticement so the inner man is saying
[1:03:55] there's got to be a true one somewhere
[1:03:57] and they said well there is one more but
[1:03:59] but but he hates
[1:04:00] us he hates us and so then they brought
[1:04:03] so then they brought Micah in and then
[1:04:05] Micah un uncovers the whole thing right
[1:04:08] he says well what's going on here is up
[1:04:11] in heaven there's a meeting of how to
[1:04:13] fulfill Elijah's prophecies on the earth
[1:04:16] about Ahab and the Bible says a Spirit
[1:04:19] came up into the Throne of God and said
[1:04:22] let me go down and be a lion spirit in
[1:04:25] the the mouth of those prophets and God
[1:04:28] said go ahead and go and brother Braham
[1:04:30] said The Spirit Well the Bible says it
[1:04:32] he says go and you will prevail now
[1:04:35] brother B said the reason that that
[1:04:37] Spirit would Prevail in those prophets
[1:04:39] is because they wasn't on the
[1:04:42] word he said so what difference does it
[1:04:44] make what they said because they wasn't
[1:04:46] on the word anyhow so all so they had an
[1:04:50] open door to just prophesy whatever came
[1:04:53] to them and they prophesied a lot
[1:04:56] and told Ahab yeah go into the battle
[1:04:59] you just go right on into the battle and
[1:05:00] M and Micah standing there and he's
[1:05:03] saiding you going to go on the battle
[1:05:04] but you ain't coming
[1:05:05] home that's right see because the spirit
[1:05:08] of Truth was there the same as this lion
[1:05:11] Spirit was there now uh uh I know some
[1:05:14] of you do a lot of studying in the
[1:05:16] message and I'll give you this from the
[1:05:17] foreal brother brandom says when this
[1:05:19] Pale Horse comes he said there's three
[1:05:21] different powers there's a political
[1:05:23] power there's a spiritual power yeah and
[1:05:26] there's a religious power three powers
[1:05:29] okay that make up that Pale Horse those
[1:05:31] three powers are spiritual power
[1:05:32] religious power and Demon power or civil
[1:05:35] see we got civil we got demon we got
[1:05:39] religious if you take this story of
[1:05:42] Micah and Ahab you have a king Ahab
[1:05:47] which is the Civil power the
[1:05:50] political and the demon is resting in
[1:05:54] political you you have a lion Spirit
[1:05:57] which is
[1:05:58] demonology and he's coming to get into
[1:06:01] that political
[1:06:02] power The Same Spirit is also in them
[1:06:06] false
[1:06:07] prophets which is the religious power so
[1:06:12] religion politics and Demon power came
[1:06:16] together to lead them to the battle of
[1:06:21] Armageddon brother BR said this is the
[1:06:23] Pale Horse this is riding now watch what
[1:06:25] he saying we've got to get in the spirit
[1:06:28] first we got to get in the spirit of if
[1:06:31] we're going to have an Armageddon
[1:06:32] there's got to be a spirit for
[1:06:33] Armageddon where is that Spirit coming
[1:06:36] from God didn't lead us to this
[1:06:37] Armageddon man is going into this
[1:06:40] Armageddon and they're following
[1:06:42] enticing Spirits now the Bible calls
[1:06:44] them unclean spirits from Revelations
[1:06:47] the 16th chapter the three frogs they're
[1:06:50] three frogs of unclean spirits and the
[1:06:52] Bible said they're always looking back
[1:06:53] now watch the principle we started with
[1:06:55] with amen if you're going to move
[1:06:57] forward amen you've got to forget the
[1:07:00] things behind you when the Pentecostal
[1:07:02] world begin to receive the message of
[1:07:04] the hour they couldn't get in the spirit
[1:07:06] of Revelation they couldn't get in the
[1:07:09] spirit of Eagle anointing they couldn't
[1:07:11] get in the spirit so all they had was
[1:07:13] their memory of what the word was so the
[1:07:17] minute the trinitarian doctrine begin to
[1:07:19] be attacked by a prophet with a with a
[1:07:21] stick and he begin to push him back by
[1:07:23] the sword when the word begin to come
[1:07:26] against the trinitarian doctrine they
[1:07:27] all went to the fathers of NAA and they
[1:07:30] started looking back they started
[1:07:32] looking back to what so and so said what
[1:07:34] so and so said but they should have went
[1:07:37] back to the word they should have went
[1:07:39] back to the word I hope you're hearing
[1:07:41] me this morning amen forgetting the
[1:07:44] things that are behind you when you hear
[1:07:47] the message and it starts giving you
[1:07:49] something say I don't understand that
[1:07:51] that way I wasn't taught that that way
[1:07:53] listen don't go back to what you were
[1:07:55] taught go back to what the message says
[1:07:58] because there's places in your life
[1:08:01] where someone has taught you something
[1:08:03] they have said something for their own
[1:08:06] control of
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:10] you now what is it any spirit that
[1:08:13] speaks contrary to this word's a lie
[1:08:16] what was it it was a trinity of frogs
[1:08:18] that was looking back that's why Paul
[1:08:19] said this one thing that I do this man
[1:08:22] just come out of being a Hebrew of
[1:08:24] Hebrews he' just come out of laws he'd
[1:08:27] just come out of systems and
[1:08:29] organizations and Paul was saying I
[1:08:31] cannot carry over what I was into what
[1:08:35] God is making me he had to find a place
[1:08:37] of Separation in his mind he how how
[1:08:41] could this man separate the walk he had
[1:08:44] from the walk amen that he experienced
[1:08:47] from behind him because he knew God was
[1:08:48] in his law but the great Pillar of Fire
[1:08:51] came down and the pillar of fire could
[1:08:53] separate the old from the new amen what
[1:08:56] is it the pillar of fire was the one he
[1:08:58] had to get in the spirit and the spirit
[1:09:00] done the separating of what he could
[1:09:02] keep and what he had to throw away I'll
[1:09:05] tell you this morning you get in the
[1:09:06] spirit of the spirit of Truth and it
[1:09:08] begins to discern it begins to pull
[1:09:11] together now I know there's a lot of
[1:09:13] voices and and there's an invasion of
[1:09:15] spirits there is an invasion of spirits
[1:09:18] upon the Earth and I love how brother
[1:09:20] brandom says this and we can identify
[1:09:21] something very quickly there are
[1:09:23] prophets and there are false prophets
[1:09:26] right there are both
[1:09:29] right now but brother random identify
[1:09:32] something the first key that we have
[1:09:34] received the Lord comes another slightly
[1:09:36] less wonderful truth the TR of the true
[1:09:39] church would always try to be like it
[1:09:42] was in the book of Acts but we have
[1:09:45] discovered that the word teaches us an
[1:09:47] invasion of
[1:09:49] error until there is a complete blackout
[1:09:52] of Truth in the last day when the Lord
[1:09:54] is about to
[1:09:55] appear the question now arises in our
[1:09:59] minds does God forsake his own and let
[1:10:03] them fall into a state of complete
[1:10:06] deception oh
[1:10:08] no no account for the scripture says
[1:10:11] very clearly that the
[1:10:13] elect
[1:10:14] cannot be
[1:10:17] deceived for there shall arise false
[1:10:19] cross and false prophets and they will
[1:10:21] show signs and wonders in so much yeah
[1:10:25] that if it were
[1:10:27] possible if it was at all possible it
[1:10:31] would deceive the very L and because it
[1:10:33] didn't deceive you because that spirit
[1:10:36] that spoke to you didn't deceive you now
[1:10:38] you're wondering if You' done something
[1:10:43] wrong well we might as well
[1:10:46] preach the seed didn't get kicked out of
[1:10:48] the shut till it got
[1:10:50] perfect Jesus didn't get crucified till
[1:10:53] it got perfect
[1:10:56] do you see there's other reasons for
[1:10:59] persecution
[1:11:01] besides do you see what happens brother
[1:11:03] bam tells us this that the spirit that
[1:11:06] comes upon the church in the last days
[1:11:09] the spirit is not the spirit of
[1:11:11] fear let me say this very clearly God
[1:11:14] did not send the spirit of fear to this
[1:11:16] church God did not spend send the spirit
[1:11:19] of fear to your
[1:11:20] life amen the prophet is clear now let's
[1:11:23] say this very clearly there's two
[1:11:25] elements that control your life and this
[1:11:27] morning either fear or faith is
[1:11:29] controlling you fear or faith is causing
[1:11:32] you to do what you do and brother
[1:11:34] brandom says it like this now false
[1:11:36] prophets come right brother brandom said
[1:11:38] it like this now just as we have showed
[1:11:40] the Antichrist is and a word so are
[1:11:43] false prophets coming to pervert the
[1:11:45] word giving it a meaning that fits their
[1:11:49] own devilish
[1:11:51] ends have you ever noticed how people
[1:11:54] who lead others astray bind themselves
[1:11:57] closely to themselves by
[1:12:01] fear brother they say that if people
[1:12:05] don't do what they say or they leave
[1:12:08] destruction is going to
[1:12:10] follow oh my goodness see God never sent
[1:12:14] fear to lead you God never sent fear to
[1:12:18] bind you God sent Faith to deliver you
[1:12:21] God sent Faith to lead you amen When
[1:12:24] Faith Comes Into the Heart fear has to
[1:12:26] leave the heart one of them is fear the
[1:12:29] other is Faith and fear of Faith
[1:12:31] controls every denomination every
[1:12:33] individual everything is controlled by
[1:12:35] fear or by faith and somebody said well
[1:12:38] fear ain't that bad brother Bram says
[1:12:40] the worst thing can be put on you it's
[1:12:42] the worst thing that can be put on you
[1:12:44] now I'm going to say what a prophet said
[1:12:45] here he said it's the greatest of
[1:12:49] curses fear is the greatest of curses
[1:12:52] that's in the church today because
[1:12:54] people are afraid to lay hold of the
[1:12:56] word of God Amen somebody says well it's
[1:12:58] like this and you know the word says
[1:13:00] different but you won't take the word
[1:13:03] because you got fear on you come on
[1:13:05] church God didn't birth a bunch of sons
[1:13:08] and daughters to car into the fear of
[1:13:11] man he birth Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:14] to rise up in this age take the sword of
[1:13:16] the spirit of God and say get out of my
[1:13:19] way devil I'm going to the resurrection
[1:13:22] I'm going to the Rapture hey amen yes
[1:13:26] sir amen I I tell you what it is amen
[1:13:29] it's the greatest curse there is I know
[1:13:31] the devil hates this kind of preaching
[1:13:32] amen but I tell you what I am so sick of
[1:13:34] that devil of fear has tried to bind
[1:13:36] people and keep people listen don't you
[1:13:39] fear this church or this man or this
[1:13:41] pull pit amen if something's in your
[1:13:42] heart you want to do something different
[1:13:44] you got Liberty go where you want do
[1:13:46] what you want if God sent you here amen
[1:13:49] then tell the devil get out of my way
[1:13:51] I'm going to enjoy amen what God has put
[1:13:55] me in in this age that I'm living in I
[1:13:58] tell you what we need to do is get in
[1:13:59] the spirit of Liberty and the spirit of
[1:14:02] faith and tell that
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:06] devil but I'm going to tell you what a
[1:14:08] prophet calls it he calls it a curse and
[1:14:11] then he says it's the greatest
[1:14:14] plague that there is in the Christian
[1:14:16] church today he said the problem is
[1:14:19] we're afraid to get out of the cage
[1:14:21] there ain't nothing wrong with you it's
[1:14:23] a cage the devil's got you in that
[1:14:25] Canary can fly fine the food it's eating
[1:14:28] is fine but there's a cage called fear
[1:14:31] that has brought a cage around you and
[1:14:33] you can't get to the limits that God
[1:14:35] anointed you to get to you can't rise to
[1:14:37] the place that God C you to rise to but
[1:14:40] I say this morning you ought to tell
[1:14:41] fear I'm walking on and leaving you
[1:14:43] today I'm going to walk right out of a
[1:14:46] place that you cannot come a place you
[1:14:48] cannot go listen there is places a
[1:14:51] Believer can go the devil can't go with
[1:14:54] them I believe there's Heights that you
[1:14:56] can climb into there's no devil can rise
[1:14:58] up with you you're brother B said but
[1:15:00] you're afraid to get out of the cage but
[1:15:02] let me say this very clearly God didn't
[1:15:04] give you that Spirit God didn't give you
[1:15:06] that spirit that is not the spirit of
[1:15:08] God brother random said the Bible Paul
[1:15:11] said it like this we have not received
[1:15:13] the spirit of bondage again to fear come
[1:15:16] on there they were in the Red Sea was in
[1:15:19] worse bondage than they were when they
[1:15:20] were in Egypt because this time there
[1:15:23] was no egyptian beating them it was
[1:15:25] their own minds it was their own fear
[1:15:28] that had gried them to keep them from
[1:15:30] pressing forward but I say this morning
[1:15:33] amen that there is an escape to every
[1:15:35] fear there is a way out of the fear of
[1:15:37] your mind the cage I say let it swing
[1:15:40] wide open this morning and step right
[1:15:42] out of it put on your traveling
[1:15:47] shoes he glory be to
[1:15:53] God Amen
[1:15:56] amen how many of you ever read how many
[1:15:59] how many of y'all ever read a Pilgrim's
[1:16:02] Progress me see your hand like if you
[1:16:04] read it or very aware of it if you
[1:16:06] hadn't it's a it can be a slow read but
[1:16:09] I think they have it in audio books and
[1:16:10] maybe layman terms Now new and old king
[1:16:13] English is pretty rough at
[1:16:16] times it's just a story of a pilgrim and
[1:16:20] they call his name Christian and
[1:16:22] traveling made of Hope and and they're
[1:16:24] going to a Celestial City and they're
[1:16:26] escaping sudden destruction behind
[1:16:28] them and they're on the journey and then
[1:16:30] the journey gets hard and in one of the
[1:16:34] scenes they come up to this place it's
[1:16:37] just the way is
[1:16:39] hard and they look over and there's an
[1:16:42] easier
[1:16:44] way and Christian says hey let's go over
[1:16:47] here and take this way I think it was
[1:16:50] hopeit was with him and he says but
[1:16:52] that's out of the way says yeah but look
[1:16:55] man there's no rough plot and there's no
[1:16:57] it's just Green Pastures it's just nice
[1:17:00] let's just and so they jump the fence
[1:17:03] they take out through the field well
[1:17:04] ain't long it just starts getting dark
[1:17:07] lightning starts flashing thundering and
[1:17:08] lightning it's
[1:17:10] Wednesday in your case it's
[1:17:16] Thursday because in the story he's there
[1:17:18] from Wednesday to Saturday night
[1:17:21] right the dates are important Wednesday
[1:17:24] to Saturday night that's between the
[1:17:25] service so it's Thursday night I'll take
[1:17:29] this way it's easier so they get over
[1:17:31] there and they lay down and they go to
[1:17:34] sleep and this is where this is where
[1:17:37] the king despair finds them in his
[1:17:42] realm see a Christian has no business in
[1:17:46] the realm of
[1:17:48] Despair it's out of the way that's
[1:17:52] right and the king of despair found them
[1:17:55] trespassing on his property and he took
[1:17:58] them down to doubtful castle that's the
[1:18:01] name of it isn't it doubtful huh
[1:18:03] doubting doubting yeah not doubtful
[1:18:06] doubting doubting Castle so he has a
[1:18:09] house
[1:18:10] stronghold his wife's name is diffidence
[1:18:14] meaning like low
[1:18:18] self-confidence so Despair and no
[1:18:21] confidence takes them to a castle puts
[1:18:24] them in there and they beat
[1:18:27] them they beat them till they can't move
[1:18:31] and then dissidence and despair discuss
[1:18:34] what they'll do with them tomorrow and
[1:18:35] they go in and beat him again they beat
[1:18:37] him again then short story they beat him
[1:18:39] again and then they they beat them where
[1:18:41] they can't even get off the ground and
[1:18:44] then they tell them they give them some

[1:22:11] Josh he he was sharing some medical
[1:22:13] advice with me the other day we were

[1:22:17] Battles Through The Years and he he told
[1:22:19] me he said Dr Lily shared something
[1:22:22] beautiful with him he okay for me to
[1:22:23] share it said B said something beautiful
[1:22:26] he'd had a panic attack she said you

[1:22:31] actually not a record of anybody dying
[1:22:33] from a panic attack but you think you're
[1:22:35] going
[1:22:37] to it works on your
[1:22:40] mind
[1:22:43] listen the devil would like to keep your
[1:22:47] mind even when he can't keep you
[1:22:57] you've left it then leave
[1:23:02] it you've moved
[1:23:05] on move
[1:23:07] on so brother way you don't know what
[1:23:10] kind of situation I was in and and I've
[1:23:12] done this and I had this and I did
[1:23:16] this you have ever right to stand on the
[1:23:20] Promises of God brother Levi when a man
[1:23:23] confesses sin yes puts it under the
[1:23:26] blood he has every right to stand on
[1:23:29] that promise just as though he never did
[1:23:32] it in the first place
[1:23:44] Hallelujah no matter no matter you say
[1:23:47] you see someone standing in a certain
[1:23:49] spot on the stage and you go I don't
[1:23:50] know if I got a right to stand with them
[1:23:52] if you've confessed your blood your sins
[1:23:54] under the of the blood you got the same
[1:23:56] right to the presence of God that any
[1:24:00] person in here
[1:24:05] does I believe this morning I believe I
[1:24:08] believe that we we we have to discern by
[1:24:11] the
[1:24:12] spirit that there are some
[1:24:14] things we need to leave
[1:24:19] behind when the spirit comes the spirit
[1:24:23] of God
[1:24:25] it separated for Paul the old and the
[1:24:28] New Testament let the spirit of God
[1:24:31] separate for you in your own
[1:24:34] life some of the things that we're
[1:24:36] confused about you know should I carry
[1:24:38] this with me or should this experience
[1:24:41] and
[1:24:42] what but there there there are
[1:24:45] things that you can't I I've often said
[1:24:48] it like this there are things you can't
[1:24:50] go on
[1:24:51] with and those are the things you got to
[1:24:54] deal with with I remember years ago I
[1:24:56] went and uh I went and had some welding
[1:25:00] done brother Brian there was old boy
[1:25:01] that lived back out in the Hills there
[1:25:03] in Arkansas and had driveway back out
[1:25:04] there and I had to get some welding done
[1:25:07] on this boat I started doing this
[1:25:09] welding yeah man it's an niest old boy
[1:25:12] he's a good old boy he's a little bit
[1:25:13] older probably would have been my dad's
[1:25:15] dad's age close Grandpa age but it's a
[1:25:19] nicest guy I get back home and I'm
[1:25:21] telling my dad about finding this welder
[1:25:23] and telling his name name and all this
[1:25:25] and dad says you know what son he said
[1:25:29] that guy was a Mason with your
[1:25:32] grandpa and he said he done him wrong on
[1:25:36] a car deal and Masons ain't supposed to
[1:25:37] do masons wrong on car
[1:25:40] deals I said man you got to be kidding
[1:25:43] me I was about 20 or something like that
[1:25:44] I just I was young I just turned a
[1:25:46] Christian actually you know what I
[1:25:49] didn't even go back out
[1:25:51] there that God done my grandpa my
[1:25:53] Grandpa died when I was
[1:25:56] three I never even knew my grandpa but
[1:26:00] he done my grandpa
[1:26:03] wrong so couple months Rock throng one
[1:26:06] day I went down to Dad's and we just
[1:26:07] sitting there discussing something come
[1:26:09] up about my boat and getting that
[1:26:10] welding done he said something what' you
[1:26:11] say that boy's name was I told him he
[1:26:14] said no that's not the guy that did that
[1:26:15] to your grandpa
[1:26:25] I've been mad at this guy for a
[1:26:31] month he didn't even know I'd been mad
[1:26:34] at
[1:26:35] him I didn't tell
[1:26:38] him I just let it
[1:26:41] go there are
[1:26:43] things that you approach as a Believer
[1:26:47] now I'm I'm saying that lightly but
[1:26:49] there's things you approach as a
[1:26:51] believer that you've went through in
[1:26:53] your life's course
[1:26:56] some of that's good for your
[1:26:59] experience some of that's good for where
[1:27:01] you're going but some of that is
[1:27:05] impeding the part that's impeding Paul
[1:27:07] said just lay it
[1:27:10] aside just lay it aside do you love him
[1:27:13] this morning could you stand your feet
[1:27:14] with
