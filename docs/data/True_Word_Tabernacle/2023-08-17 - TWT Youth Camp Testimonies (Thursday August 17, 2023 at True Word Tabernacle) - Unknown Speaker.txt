went on their way but let's come back let's tell our story let's give God the thanks tonight hallelujah amen just a couple statements just of thanks about the camp and then we'll get out of the way for the testimonies but uh I just appreciate so much the overwhelming support that we've had for this Youth Camp and you know it just uh it's something that that we're so excited about three years in and just to see how the Lord has has I believe put his stamp of approval on it on your efforts as a church the body getting together to make this possible for our young people and we see how the Lord has used it and it's just humbling and overwhelming uh for all of us to be a part of it and you know we just want it to be this has been on my heart uh since before camp and still I just just something ringing in my Heart Lord let this Youth Camp let it be a pure thing let it be a pure thing something from Pure intentions from a pure heart just a good thing in this dark world just a good thing for our young people something that'll help move the great load something that'll just make a mark for our for our fellow men or for our young ladies and our young men and and something that'll lift up the message of the hour amen something that'll that'll lift up this message not as a cultural uh Gathering not as a Creed not as a Association of churches or Circles of Fellowship but as a living breathing powerful word amen that is revealing Jesus Christ today to young lives amen tabernacling deity and young hearts and opening up the expression of what was in his mind before the foundation of the world Amen to see the mystery of God being revealed in the lives of young people that's something so precious amen and I'm I'm more confident than ever I'm more excited than ever about this message amen and the knowledge the faith amen the belief that that no matter what comes no matter how dark the world gets this message will shine on and there's a new generation that will sweep it on not another message he said they'll sweep this message on to the coming of the Lord hallelujah and and I just want this Youth Camp and to be something that will lift up the message and establish the new generation in the word of the hour Hallelujah we want to we want to first of all just thank the ministry and I think the brothers are watching tonight how many want to express your appreciation to brother Timothy brother Ron and brother Andrew hallelujah amen amen God bless those Brothers amen we've got so much love and so much gratitude for these men of God that have come and just the way they've uh you know I just was marveling the way that that the Lord operated his servants this weekend and and tried to it's just so hard to put into words tried to a little bit over the weekend but just to see how how God has has has has given us these men of God these last three years and brother Ron this year and the way that the way that they've not only brought their gifts and their Ministries which are powerful and they are wonderful but they've just have got behind the vision and I think that's the way it is everywhere around the world amongst the True Believers of this message there's a greater Vision to lift up the message Amen to build up the body of Christ the church Universal and it's been wonderful and just lift up the word and point our young people to the word and just to highlight a few things that were said I love how brother Andrew the his first statement out the gate Saturday night he said he said tonight he said get your Victory when you get your Victory get it from the preaching of the word amen and and uh we believe in Layon on in hands we we believe that God uses gifts we believe in Supernatural Works done by Supernatural Men by the quickening power amen but we know that if we're going to have a young people that are going to survive this age they got to be established on the word of God because the word of God Amen when it doesn't feel like camp meeting anymore when the emotion of it isn't there anymore when the group's not there when the preacher's not there this word will stand amen and the life is in it the power is in the word and so I so appreciate amen the ministry our young people have today and I wish we had the quality when I was a young person amen the the quality and the and the Revelation the and the the Dynamics and just the anointing of the ministry that we we have today amongst our young people's was a wonderful thing and we see the fruits of that Allelujah I love how he said that the message this message came and it not only did it come to tie up all the Loose Ends of Doctrine tie up all the Loose Ends of of revelation of the word but it can also loose you amen amen it tied up every loose end of this Bible but it Loos God's people to worship Him amen and God used brother Andrew in a mighty way in the ministry and in the prayer line and just just in personal prayer and uh as as he has many times before amongst us and so we appreciate him his gifts in his ministry and brother Timothy my brother Timothy you know this is the uh uh uh we were our youth were talking about the the last year Sunday and this year's Sunday I thought are are two of the best take-home keep the victory sermons ever preached amen just you know young people you get to a place where you just feel like uh you feel you feel that experience is leaving you or you're worried about losing your Victory go back and listen to what you were told amen you might have come in whipped but you left equipped amen Hallelujah I love how he brought out about the pool of Bethesda you know because many times when we when we uh many times young people will come to you know might come to a youth camp might come to a service and we hear a lot of testimonies we see God moving in certain ways on certain people and it puts a pressure on the young people amen with their need because well you know if God's going to do it he's going to do it this way he's going to have this man you know lay hands on me or he's going to have this one speak a word or this one's going to sing the right song or I got to be at this place or it's got to be that that type of a feeling and and there gets a pressure on you and I love how brother brother uh Timothy just hit that with the pool of Bethesda because here's a man laying there and he knew that his only hope was when the waters were stirred just a certain way and he had to be the fastest one to get to the pool and jump in and that was the way it was going to come then Here Comes Jesus and he says would you be made whole do you want to be whole do you want to be delivered do you want to be healed amen it's faith in the word of God and oh my Hallelujah it just was a just beautiful to me the way that God dovetailed the ministry together amen for our 21 and up uh we had the same experience where brother Aaron came uh uh the first afternoon and just shared a wonderful thought on just being patient as God unfolds his purpose in your life and then brother Samuel wasn't there that day he arrives the next afternoon and just and it just fit perfectly together and he continued on the same exact subject and God was just speaking to us over the weekend just in a supernatural way you know we don't coordinate those things and if we did we could not have done it that well and we could not have done it that well amen amen and then brother Ron Spencer uh just you know got to take a moment to think uh all of the years you know that I went to youth camps and how definitive and how effective over those years that brother Ron Spencer's Ministry was in my life I think the first time I danced in the spirit brother Ron might have been preaching and definitely several of them and many deliverances and things over the years and just to think that that we would be standing here over this past weekend and have brother Ron be preaching to our to our young people what a wonderful thing amen and and you know just to see behind the scenes you know brother Ron is fighting a real battle in his body as we're all aware amen and this Satan was really on the attack this past weekend amen and brother Ron really truly poured himself out to support our young people Amen to do it and and you know what it was just you just you you ought have been there there at the end when when the young people were just gathered around him I tell you history was made and I'm just glad I could be a part of that moment aren't you Hallelujah I tell you we saw so much so much victory in that service you know I just wonderful he shared some things in his heart about how you know even 20 years ago he'd preached on that Campground and and uh just you know and then you see uh this weekend it just it felt right amen it felt right it was wonderful so we want to say to brother Ron if you're watching we love you brother Ron and we're praying for you we thank you so much amen amen you know the the Lord told brother Ron he said if you trust me I'll use you like never before and I'm just grateful that that our youth camp could be a chapter in that story amen of of a of a man just beating the Daylights out of stage four cancer praise the Lord amen you know God has put great gifts in his body great gifts in his body you know he he came and he and he sent gifts unto man and uh and we need those things our young people need those things we they need to see them in operation they need to see God using gifts using because what it does it sets an example it puts something in a young person's heart say Lord let me find my purpose Lord how let use me let me reach my potentials let the things that you placed in me that I'm not even aware of let them unfold that you might use me you know you say well brother Nathan we got the word we don't need gifts but actually brother Ron said or brother brandom said he said you believe God's word as it's written if you believe God's word as it's written he said you don't need nothing else but to stimulate people's Faith what a good heavenly father Amen to stimulate people's faith God sends gifts down and and look and look what brother BR said he said it magnifies his word it speaks of his word aren't you glad for that amen God didn't just give us a dead letter he gave us gifts to enjoy he gave us singers he gave us preachers he gave us he gave us all these things to magnify his word to may help us to appreciate the message to stimulate our faith blessed be the name of the Lord amen oh my we have so much thanks to give and and uh and I appreciate uh the patience of the team there we just didn't take the time to do it properly at Camp uh and uh but uh but let's not let's not let it go without saying tonight and certainly I will forget somebody I pray I've got everybody written down but Shout It Out amen if I forget it amen we'd like to thank some members of our core staff we really appreciate Brother Richard grills and sister L for helping us with the registration and all the logistics of the weekend and and uh I just love working with Brother Richard there's you put two Engineers together with a spreadsheet and you can get a lot done amen we appreciate you Brother Richard thank you so much amen you know Sister Sister Tara and brother Taz they they help with the coordinating of of uh of all the work and all the labor and all the volunteers that are coordinated and people put to their tasks they they they they do I mean this Camp runs itself thanks to Sister Tara and amen and brother Taz and not only do they lead but they also lead by example I think they they work themselves half to death over the past weekend just meeting every need and it was above and beyond and so we appreciate sister Tara amen and her family and brother Taz and volunteer coordinators amen sister Terry you had a special moment there on Saturday night and uh it's it's amazing how how God you know a gift will make room for itself and God has hidden purpose in so many lives and it just takes the right circumstances the right opportunity for that to unfold and God recognizes it God blesses it and God backs it up amen sister Lily thank you for keeping us all healthy amen and and uh sister Lily bontreger and I we didn't have uh uh too much interaction over the weekend and that's a good thing so that's a good thing God was good and kept everyone uh safe from any any severe harm and we appreciate you sister Lily and brother Jeremy is one of the hardest workers on the campground as well and God bless you and your family appreciate you amen we appreciate brother Ben Erikson and all of his team and all of his musicians and amen amen amen and brother Colby as well and you know just to think about just to think of the you talk about gifts but I was thinking about those musicians just toiling away up there on that platform you know playing for for probably two-thirds of the time of a 7-hour service on Saturday maintaining that atmosphere just right no break no no hiccup but just just maintaining an atmosphere where God could move what a what a powerful Ministry what a sacrifice you know they pour themselves physically and just all their gifts and talents like I said you know you can measure an artist in two ways and either by his talents or by his anointing and some have just one and some have just the other but we weren't lacking in either amen we have just tremendous gifts God's put among us so we appreciate them amen and you know we're having some some technical difficulties tonight the reason is cuz Ben was over here all afternoon setting everything back up because you know they went over to Campground they set up a whole church with all of the audio all the visual all the stream and everything and then they tore it all back down and they set it up today amen so God bless them for that we want to thank brother Ronnie and sister Feliz amen words are failing me amen but you know this Camp would not be possible would not have happened we would have never had the courage uh even to take the step of trying this without Ronnie and Feliz coming it just God's timing that brought him to this assembly I believe it's God that put us together and the future looks bright amen we're looking forward to great things in store amen amen we just appreciate them and their uh just their labor their heart for the Youth they're so approachable they have such a gift to draw people to themselves to encourage and to uplift and and uh they just bring so much so much and brother Ronnie I look up to you in so many ways and just appreciate your ministry just to watch him operating even in the prayer line and things see the way that God uses him amen don't miss God's gifts amen don't don't miss what God is doing amen uh uh we want to thank a lot of our church a lot of our young couples especially uh pitch in as dorm leaders and and uh if you don't know who all it is just look around and look for the really tired ones give them a hand tonight hey amen you know we let we let the young people on their registration form we let them request a dorm buddy so we can get everybody with a friend so they won't you know half of them don't bother requesting a friend they request their favorite dorm leader so they can stay with them and and be encouraged and we get a lot of testimonies back just from things that were done just through that personal connection that Fellowship that discussion in the dorms and so we appreciate them amen God bless the mcnalty family for that Afterparty three years in a row God bless you you know that was a that was an event unto itself and it was such a blessing you know that we could just focus on the camp and then on Sunday we could dismiss and we could send them somewhere else and somebody else already took care of everything and there was a huge team that that just brought Believers from all the local churches together and it was just wonderful to see people working in unity to bless our young people thank you for your labor and for your hospitality and for for for sharing the vision amen God bless you we want to thank Nathan and Natalie for that coffee shop amen we want to thank Isaac and Bethany for those snow cones kept us cool amen we want to thank all those from other churches you know another member our core staff brother Matt mcclard you know he's he's not even a member of this church but there's nobody there is nobody with a greater heart for young people than brother Matthew mlar and he deserves all the law all the recognition because he has been an unsung hero in my life since I was 10 years old and so we appreciate him and it's just an honor that he would see fit to get behind us and so we appreciate his support brother Matt if you're watching we love you amen and there were so many pastors you know that came in in heavy support of this of this uh uh uh of this Youth Camp brother Tim prud of course and his church they put together the money three years in a row to rent a big old giant bus and send all their youth to make sure that they would partake and they're such a big part of the camp we appreciate that we appreciate brother Ron Spencer getting behind it and pulling for it and and preaching for us this year year and brother Samuel Browning has been one of our speakers of the older Youth and this year he stayed home from his from his Sunday service just to be at Camp just to make the extra show of support we appreciate brother Samuel so much and also brother Jeremy Shriner from Amarillo Texas it was his first time visiting with us and he just came that whole church came and got behind 100% And they were just so had so many positive things to say and such a part of it all and so we appreciate them so much and those and their churches and brother Jonathan Martin and Bible Believers we absolutely love you we absolutely love you all amen amen amen this Camp would not be possible without their labors but that church has absolutely join their shoulder to the wheel we're so happy to have them amongst us to share their testimonies right with our young people I watch your testimony service last night and uh and went over an hour of the young people and the old ones testifying and you go ahead and take over tonight you just join right in amen we're not in a hurry I'm not and and so you just say it all you're part of us we love you and you are an example to the whole message community of Brotherhood and of Fellowship so we salute your pastor and we salute your church I appreciate brother Wayne and brother Ry our pastors and and all of the church for supporting this getting behind our young people and I am so glad that our young people have some local churches here that don't treat them like an afterthought they don't treat this youth ministry like like something to the side or or or something lesser but but there is a a group of people here amen that are making investments in the Church of tomorrow and actually young people you're not the Church of Tomorrow you are the Church of today and I've often said that the young people are the thermometer of the church and you can tell a healthy church right away by the by the well-being of its young people and I'm I'm happy to say in Lime Ohio we're looking red hot glory amen God bless you young people and your testimony your Holiness your example you you are seeing you are making a statement you are making an influence you have a voice God is using you you have a purpose amen I'm so proud of our young people just so proud of what the Lord is doing in our young people and uh and I just I wouldn't trade them for anyone amen I think this it's a testate to the message of the hour amen that it still creates amen true Christianity even in young lives even in the darkest age that's ever been God bless you every one of you is very important just before we go to the testimony we were having we've been having a Revival in our youth chat and we've been swapping a whole lot of of Rocket Fuel quotes and there were just a couple of them I just wanted to play before we turn to the testimonies brother Jeremy if you let's just enjoy these together about that time the Holy Spirit jumped up and went dancing around like that there's twice as much room as is walked off the platform said not enough room up here walked off that platform I said boy that's what I [Applause] [Music] want as the eagle renews his youth yes sir the Revival takes shakes all the old funny feelings away

testimony all right sister Ella start us off well um um so um I had been struggling a lot with battles and stuff and and um I on Saturday night the preaching was just exactly it was just like God was speaking to me and I was in the prayer line and I was just thinking okay I'm done like I'm I'm ready I'm ready for this to be over and I'm just and the devil had been just fighting me a lot and I felt like he had taken my dance and I wanted a refilling of the Holy Ghost too and um I saw so many people getting their victories and stuff and I walked up there and brother Andrew kind of just smiled at me and he was like you're ready aren't you and he started praying for me and he said fill her again and again and again and I got a refilling of the Holy Ghost and then he told me to stand up and stomp on that devil one more time and I danced out of the prayer line and then and I was um out for a little bit already and I saw Bethany hugging Reagan Spencer and I walked past and Bethany was speaking in tongues and she kind of held out her hand like she wanted me to come over and she kind of brought me in for a hug and as she was speaking tongues I kept hearing I love you Ella and it was just like God was telling me he love me amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord Brother Bram said that's true scriptural tongues when somebody speaking but you're hearing it in your own language and amen he still does it he anybody else testimony down through here our young people anybody who we got all right sister [Music] Ellie coming into Camp I was trying to figure out what it was that I truly wanted the Lord to deliver me from and I was praying and asking God to reveal it to me and he did Tuesday night before camp we had a prayer meeting at the barfields and I was as I was praying the Lord revealed something from my past that I thought I had work through and dissolved but clearly I hadn't so I prayed that the Lord would deliver me from it so skipped to Saturday night and the Lord had already done so much for me but I was still fighting with my past so I decided to go through the prayer line and I was about three people out and the devil started fighting me he tried to tell me that there were so many more people with such bigger needs than I had that what I was dealing with really wasn't that big of a deal and it was so bad that I nearly went and sat down but something in me told me that no matter how big or small your need is God cares just as much and I knew that the devil was fighting me and the reason he was fighting me so hard was because I was about to be free I got to the line and brother Andrew put his hand on my head and he said you've been through a lot and now you get to experience it another thing I'd been fighting was to be free enough in the Lord that I could dance and jump in his spirit and when brother Andrew said that to me the chains broke and I danced and jumped out of the prayer line I was writing this down tonight and I was laying on the floor in so much pain I had never felt this much pain in my back before and I was trying to decide whether or not I was going to share it and it was just confirmation the devil had never fought me this hard trying to get me to keep my testimony to myself so I just just thank the Lord for what he did for me glory to God okay sister Zoe well I could go way back in my testimony but I'll keep it to Camp um since we've moved here just real quick the Lord has helped me slowly to heal from a lot of things and um he's delivered me from a lot of anxiety um things that I was holding on to um but for Camp I was trying to pray for specific things um and he spoke to me several times through sermons as I Was preparing my heart for um this the services this weekend um and it just had me with my eyes and my ears open waiting to see what the Lord would say to me so um on Thursday night something happened that really shook me and um kind of made my knees knock a little bit and I I knew it was for a reason I knew the Lord had planned it just that way to bring some more healing into my life uh Thursday night Bethany came came and prayed for me and she spoke just everything that I was thinking and everything that I was struggling with in my heart and so each night after that I just prayed like Lord I want you to help me be free of all this I want to let it go um because I'm the kind of person that likes to try to help God and hold on to things cuz he has so much to do so I KN I knew that wasn't right but I just couldn't let go on my own so Saturday night came and before the prayer line was even called or before they even said anything about it I determined in my heart I was going to go because I knew if I didn't then that I wouldn't so as soon as they said for people to start land up I went and the whole prayer line I fought I had a pit in my stomach I I kept wanted to go sit down but I knew I needed to stay and then I got up into the front of the line and I saw it go through and I saw so many people that I loved go through and get their Victory and then it was my turn and I went in and brother Wayne and brother Andrew just the Lord just his Spirit flowed through them and I felt myself let go and I felt myself give it to God everything that I was holding on to and in my letting go I felt felt such a peace and I felt God's love like I've never felt it ever in my life he felt so real it felt like he was walking around touching us and praying for us and I just I had no strength my my physical strength gave out and I think shyenne had to carry me off and set me down and just for the rest of the night and into Sunday I felt so much peace and I felt like I was floating I felt his presence like never before and I'm just I'm so thankful for everything you did there's there's so many other stories but [Music] that's all right sister so um I had come to Camp like wanting a really like u a deep experience with the Lord so um there was something like holding me back almost from like getting to that point so on Thursday brother Timothy had brought out like forgiveness and there was it just like deal with my heart on that and there was someone that just I could not forgive and um I went to The Altar and just like I felt so much I I just gave it to the Lord like God you have to take this like I can't just be like hating them all the time cuz I did not I don't want to do do that at all and so I was able to forgive them and I have peace about that situation with them and um and so that's like what was holding me back from like my full deliverance and so on Saturday I went in the prayer line wanting freedom from all this stuff like I had gone through and um a real genuine and experience so in the prayer line as brother Andrew Sor prayed I was able to break through and started like just jumping and praising the Lord for like bringing me through and I was able to have some great Liberty and freedom with Jesus glory to God hallelujah amen let me read sister hadassa before we move on there stand up Sister Sasa I'll read it for you but you stand up she uh turned this one in this was Qui uh I had to I got to enjoy being front row for this one front front row seat for this Deliverance she said I have been dealing with depression anxiety and fear for a long time they started leaving and then coming back on Friday brother Ron was talking about that stuff but one thing he said got me really listening he said staying in your room by yourself for a long time will bring demons and I did that all the time I then started thinking I'm done with depression anxiety and fear when the song Services started I felt weight on my chest get lifted and I could not stand still I started jumping around but after a while I started to stop not because I was tired but because I was hearing voices bad voices telling me God doesn't love you and you don't deserve this and isn't the enemy Wicked amen many times young people you got to push through those things amen cuz that accuser is there hmon is there but so is the king amen amen and you you're his Queen you got a right to press into the presence but you know he began to whisper in Sister ad doa's mind she said I I then knew I needed prayer so I walked up there brother Wayne and brother Nathan both prayed for me everything was lifted off me I started my victory dance again boy did she amen I was dancing right with you sister adasa she said I'm feeling happier than I've ever been in my whole life I just want to thank God for giving bro brother on those words to say God really knew what I needed to hear amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord all right Ashton saw you Shelby I'll keep this brief but for about 10 to 15 years I dealt with depression suicide and anxiety and while I had victory over it several years ago this weekend God gave me a dance and a joy and Hallelujah and I'm so thankful for for that that he gave me liberty and restored my joy just want to thank him for [Applause] [Music] that glory to God amen sister this is Sister Joy from Cloverdale so I actually have so much to say cuz I mean like there's Victory after Victory but um after Camp the devil was just trying to tell me that I don't have the Holy Ghost and he was trying to bring up things that I've done a while ago and I've repented for and I just want to say I've repented over those things and I know they're under the blood and I know I have the Holy Ghost and I just want to say that I have the victory that one about do not pass me by can you tell that part okay yeah so actually um so on I didn't really come to camp with like a specific need um but on Thursday night I was sitting in service and I was just so distracted and I just I I just wanted to leave I wanted to just go to the bathroom and just and I was just really fighting um just being distracted in that service and I um the minister said the devil just wants you to get up and go to the bathroom so I was like okay I'm not going to go to the bathroom um but so I just stayed there I still didn't really I don't really remember what that service was about but um I just stayed and then at the end of the service I was just like I you can either leave a service getting further away from God or closer to God and I was just like I can't leave being further away from God and so I decided to go up to the front even though I didn't feel like it and so I went up to the front and I was just my heart's cry was Lord Don't Pass Me Me by and I really wanted um brother Andrew to pray for me cuz I wanted him to pray for me at my camp and he never did and it was just I also wanted that to happen and so I just I started praying and brother Dwayne Lawson came and he started praying for me and I just I I just lifted my hands and brother Andrew Spencer comes over and he grabbed my hand and he said you have the victory sister and then do not pass me by starts playing and then brother Dwayne Lawson starts laughing and he looks at me in my eyes and he says no human could have planned that sister do you hear that and it was just so perfect cuz I I just wanted to to feel the Lord and have something so personal happen and it just goes to show you that he hears your prayers even when you don't feel like your prayers are being heard but he heard my heart's cry and it was it was just so [Applause] [Music] special goad sister Faith an um so it started off Thursday night and he had an altar call and I went up to the Altar and I really just struggled with fear and um sister fleece asked us to write down a couple things that we wanted delivered from and so I had fear and I wanted a refilling the Holy Ghost and I wanted more freedom and a realer experience with him and um I went up to the altar on um Thursday and I just knelt down and prayed I was there for maybe like 30 minutes and um I believe that it was gone but I was like Lord for a confirmation you will either let the song leader say something about fear or the minister that comes and prays me for me say something about fear and a couple minutes later none of those things happened so I was like Lord you'll just come down and you'll just speak to me and um no more than I said that the minister came and prayed for me and he said um may all fear be casted out and then he said give her refilling of the Holy Ghost no more than he said that the song leader said something about fear and then um tears started rolling down my face and I just believe that the Lord was really there and then um Friday and Saturday night it was just a real experience and I really got what I wanted and then um Sunday the Lord had the devil just really been on me and he was like well you didn't you got all you wanted you didn't you don't really need Freedom you're fine you got what you wanted and then brother Timothy started preaching about excuses and I was like okay you know devil I don't got what I want and um so that um that Sunday then after service everybody started getting the victory dance and I was like I want to be there too and after I got started I couldn't stop Hallelujah good [Applause] [Music] [Applause] job sister felissa tell us about our list okay so um before Camp I was listening to last year's testimony service at this church and I felt led to write a list of everything that I wanted from Camp because I was I was super excited for this Camp I knew I was going to get everything that I wanted so I was like I'm going to write this down I'm going to write out like a pre- testimony so I wrote I wrote everything down and um and now I'm forgetting everything I was going to say and I came to Camp um and I Thursday and Friday services were phenomenal and they were really good but I didn't get what I wanted so I came to Saturday service and I was like I know this is my service service like this is going to be for me and I was really expecting from the Lord and I I went in the prayer line and the devil was fighting me but I was like I'm going to get this I know I'm going to get this and I went through the prayer line and I came out and I was more disappointed than I have ever been and I was like what went wrong because I had I had expected so much and I had tried to make sure everything in my life was lined up and I was like God what did I do wrong like why didn't I get what I came for so I'd been crying and I finally got up and I was like I'm gonna praise God anyway because that's something I can do no matter what so I praised God and while I was doing that I felt him like tell me just trust me tomorrow is your day and I was like but it's Sunday and that's like a victory service and but I was like at this point it's not it's not up to me it's up to God everything's up to God so I give it to you because all I can do left is trust God so I came into service Sunday and about eight minutes into the service brother Timothy starts preaching on everything that I had been praying for like it was amazing and I got delivered of so many things on my list and I was at the end of service and I was just thanking God for everything and then I realized I had I hadn't gotten everything on my list and I the devil was like you know what you're good you got most of it you can leave that's fine and I was like but my God can do all things so I am going to get all things so I went up I had a couple healings I hadn't received and I went up and I told the ministers and they prayed for me and I was I was healed like I got everything on my list glory to [Music] God um so I would just want to thank the Lord for uh giving me the holy ghost at camp um it was a real experience um I also want to thank the Lord for healing me of a disease called scoliosis praise the [Music] Lord hallelujah I want to read one off of the website there before we come over and get some of these young boys involved but up here okay I won't I won't miss you this is uh from brother Eli cross and there are quite a few good testimonies posted on the website we we won't get to all of them tonight but this one really struck me he said for around a month before coming to twt he said I was facing the hardest battle I've ever fought I was fighting a lot of Mind battles and the devil just in my ear and really taking advantage of me being in a hurt and vulnerable spot I just didn't feel like living anymore I would lay at night just crying and crying until 1: to 2:00 a.m. and then I had to get up at 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. for work I would just lay in bed and not want to get up and face another day because I just got to the point where I didn't even want to try on the way to and from work I would just drive as fast as I could just hoping something might happen like take a turn too fast or lose control I just lost purpose in my life so much I tried to follow God's will for me and watching things just fall through just made me lose Faith a lot of times I was thinking what's the point anymore when I try I just fail and I got to a place where I didn't read my Bible listen to tapes or music anymore I felt like every day could be my last that I wouldn't be able to make it and that I was just going to fail a lot of times I felt like I wasn't going to be able to keep the faith and would fall that I wasn't for the message that I was just meant to be one of them who came so close but couldn't make it I felt like I wasn't able to overcome and I wasn't going to make it through this trial coming in Camp I really didn't have any expectations I had so much doubt that I just came to Camp just to see friends cuz I didn't think anything would happen for me I came to Camp frustrated because I just didn't feel feel like it mattered enough what I was dealing with Thursday night I just sat in church and didn't feel like being there I just felt like I wasn't going to get anything but as we were singing during the song service I just started thinking I have the power to put myself into the atmosphere that's right for me to get a blessing God made me to praise him and getting into the right spirit will put me in tune for his word to have an impact in my life so I just started to praise and sing from my heart brother puit just walked right down my alley I felt like it was just me and him in there and he was just talking to me it gave me so much encouragement that it just turned around my whole attitude for the weekend and the services come Friday night I came with an expectation of getting my needs met and beating this month-long battle when the service came to an end and people were up in that circle on the pulpit I was up there in front of where the minister stood and when I was up there something just telling kept telling me to talk to brother Timothy about what was going on with me I kept pushing it off saying this wouldn't be the right time for it or the need I have isn't important enough to to matter telling him everything that was going on but I looked down at my hands they were just glistening with sweat I would wipe them off on my sleeves or my pant legs they would just be as sweaty as before and I knew that was because in myself I was battling whether or not to talk and pray about it so I just finally turned around and told him I told him everything I was feeling and going through for the past month I told him how I was shaking in my faith and I was just at the verge of completely falling apart and he told me he said those feelings are real and they're serious things but you just have to cast your burdens on him God has it in control lay your burdens down and walk free and then we prayed and God just brought his presence down and lifted those burdens off of me I fell to my knees and was just thanking him and glorifying for him everything he's done for me and as I got up and just stood there praying and thanking him brother puit got in my ear and said go Praise Him and thank him for everything he's done for you I just started jumping and shouting thanking God for everything he's done for me and always hearing my prayers and and that night I just saw God move on my need and Friday night God just turned the whole situation around and fix the whole thing he said I know it was of God because it could have only took God to make it happen I'm just so thankful that God cares and at the lowest and the weakest moments he reaches down and picks me up amen hallelujah amen he's got one more paragraph he said God has changed everything for me I've been at peace and the trial I face is lying Dead behind me now and I am walking in Victory and in faith that God is leading me I can't fail I can't fall and I can't fail because if he started it he has to finish it I can't remember who but one of the ministers talked about the story of the Israelites in the Red Sea and it just lined up with everything I felt I felt like the Israelites when they came to the Red Sea I was just thinking so much why would it be why would I be brought this far and God bring me through so much just for me to end up like this and fall short but at twt God split my Red Sea I walk through it this weekend and behind me is just a bunch of dead Egyptians I know God's taken me to my Promised Land it doesn't matter what may come my way I know where I have to finish and that's in glory amen go ahead sister Molly um so Friday night when brother Ron was preaching um he made the comment that if you don't have the Holy Ghost tonight Easter night I had a very strong desire that wouldn't leave me through the service because I just knew I didn't have it all I could focus on was that I almost just blocked everything else out and at the end I had raised my hand and when he had called everyone up to go I asked Cheyenne to go up with me uh we were up there singing and worshiping and when brother Ben started singing it ain't over yet the spirit hit me so strong and if I hadn't been holding on to Cheyenne I would have probably gone flat on my face and I just asked the Lord though before I had gone up to give me a confirmation that I got the Holy Ghost like I wanted to know without a doubt so as I was up there um I was just screaming out and the spirit had H me and all of a sudden Cheyenne bent down my ear and said um it's yours he told me to tell you that it's yours and I just screamed out that I want it and I knew without a doubt that I had gotten it and that was [Music] and honestly I know I had not breathed a word to anyone about my confirmation like Cheyenne had no idea and for her the Lord just to use her like that um I talked to her after just to let her know you know but I just want to thank the Lord for that [Applause] um I didn't plan on getting up here uh but I know the camp was for the Youth and a lot of times as parents you know you're busy watching your kids or you're running around and my weekend my boys ended up I have three boys and they ended up being very wild and I think I maybe heard 10% of some of the services you know just being in and out and you know how it is as a parent and um so I I just was it I didn't go to Camp um with you know a major need on my heart or anything I just I wanted a closer walk with the Lord and um just to be in his presence and I felt like I was just I never got you know that chance to be there and um Saturday night I took the kids back to the camper and my husband got to be in church and the other ones and they all got an awesome Victory and I I was just so thankful for that and um I was just in the camper you know singing and just praising the Lord myself and um Sunday morning I uh got up my husband went to work and um I was there by myself with the kids and they were just being like so wild before church and I was like Lord like I I'm just going to go home like I I'm done like I I can't do anymore and I'm just I'm going to get in the car and I'm going to go home and I'm not going to go into church and like just like it was just so on my heart like no like you need to stay you know you've made it this far just make it a little longer so um I stayed and my dad took wco for me and I was just sitting in my seat it was before church started and the songs you guys were just playing up there and they were the exact songs that I was singing in the camper the night before and so I just had tears start streaming down my face CU I could just feel the presence of the Lord and um just you know that he cares and um brother Tim's message was just so amazing that morning and so encouraging and you know I just was just thinking about all the victories that had happened and all the things I had seen in my family and my friends take place and so um during the songs I just I just let go and I was just thanking the lord for it and he gave me my victory dance that morning and I got to be up with the youth praising him as well so even if you know you feel like you're not able to be apart or not be in or you know you're out with your kids the Lord will give you a double portion and he gives you your blessing as well Sunday morning I think we had about 900 people in the Tabernacle uh less than 400 of those were young people so if there's one thing we know Youth Camp is not just for the young amen you boys got to go head brother Micaiah so um Elijah Evans had was at the horse and he went off the rope swing and he got water in behind his he hit his head and got water in behind his eard drum but a couple days after that Elijah got in a car wreck right gide in um Elijah got in a car wreck and then um and right after that Nathaniel was sick Monday morning all through Wednesday couldn't go to church Wednesday and then woke up just fine completely healed on Thursday morning and the devil was just really trying to ruin the camp and I can feel it well all the services were amazing and Sunday morning I was really sick to my stomach I couldn't focus and I had went to Sister Lully and she' gave me something and it wasn't helping and I had I went up there and I was looking at Uncle Jonathan I was going to go up there and get him he was on the platform and I didn't want to make a full of myself so I was like you know what I just the devil just kept on saying you're going to make it full yourself and I was just like and I I don't know how long it was a little bit after that Uncle Jonathan got up and went into the back office I don't know what he was doing but I ran around to the back and opened up the door and I caught him just as he was going back into the service and I asked him to pray for me and I took three steps there was three steps off to the back F I took all three steps and I was completely healed as soon as I took my last step so it was amazing well that night at the mcnalty uh the devil attacked me again and I was like and that night I was laying in bed and I was so sick I couldn't move I was like you know what Satan I've already got my victory I'm Healed and I was completely healed there Hallelujah whack them again amen thank you Lord okay thank you thank you Lord uh I think it was the second morning of camp and I was praying for the Holy Ghost and uh on the second day I was at the altar and my dad prayed for me and he asked me what you praying for and I told him the Holy Ghost and that's what I got praise the [Applause] lordia um on Saturday night I think on the pr at the prayer line um I asked the Lord if I could get a refilling of the Holy Ghost and when I got out of the prayer line I was talking to him and that's when I got the refilling of the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so before Camp I knew that I was dealing with Spirits so I've been dealing with these Spirits for like four to five years and every single camp that I would go to I would go through the prayer lines get prayer and I would get the victory but only for like three to six months so I came into camp and I'm like I know this is the camp I'm going to get the victory so then Saturday night when I think it was brother Andrew Spencer was preaching and then before he started the prayer line he said you got to hate that Spirit yeah and come into the prayer line hating that spirit and you'll be delivered yeah so I came in hating it and I'm like it's gone it's all gone [Applause] [Music] amen so for about a year I had been dealing with an addiction to my phone I just couldn't get over it and God delivered me on on Saturday thank God so uh about a year now I've been dealing with pornography and about two weeks before Camp my dad prayed through with me um while we're doing chores and so I went to Camp expecting to go through the rest of the way and get total deliverance and Thursday night brother Tim was talking about uh God's light coming down on our lives and erasing all those pictures that Satan had gotten of us when we'd Fallen I'm just claiming that [Applause] [Music] amen amen sister Kaitlin thank you so I didn't know I had a testimony until I was sitting here listening to everyone else's um I was there all camp and was for there for all the services and went through the prayer line and the entire Camp I didn't feel like I felt anything I didn't feel like I felt a victory or not or anything like that I didn't go through with like a spec specific expectation I had a few things on my heart but while I was sitting here listening to the testimonies uh the Lord reminded me of something that he had revealed to me uh on Saturday night while I was listening to service and a spirit that is a familial spirit in my family that was passed down to me and I believe that the Lord healed me of it and it's obviously been I've been I'm 23 years old I've been dealing with it my whole life and didn't even know what it was called I didn't know what why and the Lord healed me of [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it I thank the dorm leaders but I forgot to think our night guards brother Johnny and sister Caitlyn are so faithful and just uh just a a staple of the camp keep things orderly after night and we really appreciate the night guards and they go without sleep so a couple days before Camp I had wrote a few things down that were heavy on my heart every single service the Lord would come down in such a special and personal way and answer one of my needs by the time Camp was over everything on my list had been answered Thursday night before church I read Isaiah 55 11-13 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I plead and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off those scriptures were fulfilled by the time Camp was over those giants that had been tormenting me are d destroyed Saturday night was Unforgettable before church I had prayed about something that's bothered me for a few years and the devil would bring it up at random times and usually it was when my spiritual life was really good and it would make me so incredibly anxious when brother Andrew said that the scripture that was written for Judas is not for me and to flip the page I felt something leave right there that spirit is completely gone as I was nearing the prayer line every step I would take I was stomping on that stupid devil that was tormenting me and my family the anointing was so strong I've never felt his presence like that before I went through the prayer line and the Lord delivered me of everything the devil had been bothering me with I've taken my Mountain I've stepped on the neck of those Devils that were tormenting me my mind and my family I know beyond a shadow of a doubt I left Camp completely set free delivered refilled and overflowing with the Holy Ghost I now have true Liberty with my praise and worship I have so much joy and peace I know God loves me I know I'm going in the Rapture I know I was always God's I know God's pleased with me I know God's always been with me and he will never leave me I know he loves it when I worship him I know I make Satan nervous and Hell tremble I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm sealed in him forever and nothing can or ever will take that from me my joy has been restored I have my peace back I have my sound mind I have my Liberty and I have so much Freedom fear nervousness anxiety depression a couple complexes I had cancer Satan everything is under my feet so why should I worry when Giants come Calling My Name Satan got defeated destroyed drug around whipped tormented stomped and danced all over by a sister wearing a skirt I get so much joy when I think about what he's done for me amen amen good job [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you Lord um Saturday night I was just sitting there before the prayer line just uh praying to myself I just I knew there was there was something in my spirit that just wasn't right and I didn't quite know what it was but I knew I know the god that we serve so I just kind of sat there at my seat just praying to God that I knew that you know he could take whatever it was and when I went through the prayer line um brother Matt and Isaac Hatfield both at the same time they just they laid their hands on me and I just remember them just praying over me that all these complexes would leave and it just there was so much that happened cuz I didn't even realize that was what was what was holding me and just in a light switch just like this unreal just lifting I don't even know how to explain it but it was just it was all gone right then and there and uh I got back to my seat and after Chloe got got back to her seat after a while I just began to tell her you know what the Lord did for me and it was just this unreal just presence just moving thank you Lord and just when it seemed like you know I it's kind of coming back to reality I guess then brother Isaac and and Noah Flory came by and then begin to tell them and then it was just another moving and that it was just it was so powerful and then once again I kind of just started coming to and I was like man I really want to tell brother Matt what happened and I was just passed out on my chair with my head lifted up and as soon as I opened my eyes brother Matt just came out of nowhere and he just laid his hands on me and then just another just super natural moving it was just it was something that I I cannot even fa them to explain how wonderful it was and that presence was just so real it it honestly it didn't get any stronger or any less than till about 4 in the morning that night I was just I've never been able to just leave church and just feel that same presence as I just went to the snack bar to get some food and go and do devotions in my dorm and just sitting there in bed and I know like Nathan said the dorm leaders we're tired and I knew I knew I was tired and I'm sitting there in bed like why can't I go to sleep and it was just this unreal peace and joy that that God just gave me and I I just I thank God because I'm I'm still resting in that joy and that [Music] [Applause] peace um I hadn't planned on saying anything but I know there's no testimony too small and I don't think mine was really small at all um for a while I've been uh I've been battling nervousness and uh so many things would bother me and other people's um problems and just little things here and there and I would just start shaking all over and I didn't even realize it I just thought that that was me I just thought that was a part of me you know and um leading up to Camp it was um uh Wednesday I I was I was trying to pack and get ready for camp and everything and I just couldn't get my thoughts together I was just a nervous wreck and um I I I realized that it was the devil it was the devil trying to make me nervous and not be able to look forward to Camp uh because being around a lot of people it it would make me nervous and um so I uh I get to camp and I'm all all day uh Friday I I I was just dealing with that nervous feeling the same thing that I was dealing with the whole week before and I uh I I went to Mariah and Seth's or Mariah Cavanaugh's room and I just I was just like I just need to go sit down by myself I I can't deal with all these people I just need to go sit and I was just so nervous and um so Saturday the prayer line started and I was like I don't have anything to go up for you know I'm fine and you know just everything that the devil tries to tell you and and um so I get in the prayer line and um and I was just thinking I haven't always been like this this isn't actually me um it's the devil trying to keep me from being who I'm supposed to be and uh and leading up to everything I was I was trying to figure out who I needed to be for before the Lord and use um just I just wanted to be in in used by him and I just wanted to let go and be free and just just whatever he needed me to be just let me be that and I real I realized I couldn't be that if I didn't let go of of of this nervous feeling that was keeping me back from so many things from being around people and having joy and so I I I I went through the the the prayer line and uh one brother on one side of me I don't know who it was but he said you haven't always been like this and the other brother on the other side said you don't have to fear anything and that's whenever I got my victory [Music] so so after c after camp and everything I was feeling a lot better and you know how the devil's like oh will it only lasts for a day or it'll be back or you know something like that and uh me and Levi were talking and something came up where it would have that subject would have made me nervous and I look over at him and he looks at me and he's like you're you're you're okay and I was like yep [Applause] so the Lord healed me and he's under my feet amen is that baby JoJo back there anest hold that baby up that's a camp testimony amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen anyone else around here there you go all right I wasn't going to give a testimony because I don't I don't like to I feel led to so here I am uh so as you know me even being able to make it to Camp was pretty much a miracle amen I should have been like in a hospital bed somewhere yeah so kind of went to camp and I'm like okay I'm like I'm going to get something special but I'm like I don't know what it is so I'm like and I knew sister flee told us you know write down stuff so I had like things and I'm like okay I want to have experience like I've never had before like know God in a different way yeah so that was like kind of my my first thing on my list I'm like okay I want to know God in a different way so I went to Camp first night I went up and I'm like I cleared everything out of the way made sure I was like ready for it and um so I mean and um then the second night we like after after brother uh Ron like called everybody up on the stage and stuff I mean like you felt the power of God I went back to my seat and I was like almost like hit a brick wall like really and I'm just like so I went up for prayer and I'm like well God I'm like you know my heart so I went up and they some brothers prayed for me and I'm like it was nothing with what I was like thinking at all and I'm like I'm like God I'm like did you get something wrong and he's like he's like like he's like no just wait and out of nowhere Here Comes brother Matt and he just sticks his hands on me and he literally prays everything I was thinking about just like right there and so I'm like okay so I was like I mean I was happy and then the prayer line came and uh brother Andrew he he told us he's like get your Victory through the word because he's like when the um preachers leave and the anointing leaves he's like you'll still have your Victory through the word amen so I'm like okay so I'm like I'm taking my victory through the word word and then I went uh through the prayer line and felt absolutely nothing and I was like what I'm like I'm I was supposed to get something so I'm like so I sat there and prayed for like I don't know how long but then somebody came and they're like all I can remember is like it's not in vain so I was like okay so I'm like all I can do at this point is so I went back to the dorm and I'm like I ain't going to uh stop I'm like I can just pray God for it ahead of time so Sunday I didn't hold back at all I just let loose and kind of just felt as free as I could feel and then um I have to go po post Camp to get the full testimony so I was um I called a buddy that I like never call like ever like I never call him and I just called him up and I'm like hey are you busy and we were just having normal conversation and we were about to hang up and um neither of us hung up and we're like okay so then we like started on a different conversation and it uh turned totally around and uh we we end up giving our testimonies to each other and uh we just felt like the Lord just come in in the conversation it was it was a supernatural thing so I didn't go to Camp uh with anything in particular but that didn't mean I wasn't ready to get something so uh it's funny I told my I was thinking you know being in the atmosphere makes you hungry for something so after Thursday night service I uh I was walking back from something and I was keenly aware that I had been carrying around condemnation in my heart and I'd wake up in the mornings and just felt this weight and it was like hard to do life you know you just like you wake up like h I don't really want to get moving right now because it was just it was pressing down on me and I had been putting up with it for I don't even know how long I mean years years years so I thought well that's something to get rid of let's so uh it's just another liability uh so uh you know and I didn't necessarily I I went up when brother Ron had everybody come to the to the front just sincerely and nothing in particular happened um but uh the next morning I was talking to brother Matt McClaren just kind of sharing some things with him and he encouraged me he like you got a fight brother like you got to do some battle here and and it really lifted that weight off me and I realized okay I've I've just got to do some Warfare right now well Saturday night I Natalie asked me to go through the prayer line with her and I'm a good husband so I did and uh we were walking up at the prayer line and I thought well I'm going up here let's let's get something out of this right uh uh and I I had been diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease earlier this year uh and I'd never been prayed for for that and so I thought all right I I'll I'll receive my healing here and um I just I God gave me just a simple Faith like I'm going to go through the prayer line I'm going to obey the word and I'm going to be healed and it's that simple and so uh and usually I don't make things simple so that's a miracle in of itself so uh I I went through the prayer line and and they started praying for me me for for fear and then brother Matt just grabbed me and started praying fervently for me and and and prayed along the lines of what had been on my heart that you know the devil's been beating me down and I needed to to rise up and and do battle and just praying that I would give the strength to do that and uh so after he was done praying my pastor was in the line he said Nathan that was the word of the Lord to you if you'll take it and uh I appreciate him saying that because carnally you might have said well I talked to brother Matt this morning he knew exactly what to pray for me but it was the spirit of God it wasn't a man praying uh so in my heart it was it was something that I took very sincerely and I meditated on after the service and I think I'm past happy birthday uh so Sunday morning uh brother Timothy puit was was preaching along the lines of brother Andrew Spencer the night before that hey our Victory is in the word of God and I I you know I I'm kind of got to I've got a nervous spirit that I've had to battle in my life and many times what Nathan was talking about in the youth service I feel this pressure like man I got to go do backflips or something to get something out of this service or go get prayed for and when he was talking and and preaching about getting Victory from the word I was thinking about a spirit that i' had been dealing with that had been influencing my life and I thought well maybe I had to go up and get prayed for and then something in my heart just said you know what he said that he came to set at Liberty those that are bound am and I said I'm just going to take that right here in my seat and since then it's been it's been Victory because I took it by the word so I thank the Lord I he used those services to put a grit in my heart and now I just keep telling the devil the truth and smacking him again and smacking him again and I'm seeing the Victory and and I'll just throw in a bonus here it was Wednesday night and we were having our testimony service and and at the end of the service the Lord was just moving and and there was something in my heart that was Heavy still was like there's still something the Lord wants to do in my heart and uh and so I just I started praying and I was like man I feel like I just need to break loose and and so I started praying and I said Lord I believe you got something for me and rather than procrastinate I said Lord I'm going to get it tonight and that was and I just started praying that and all of a sudden I was dancing down the center aisle and uh and it that burden was just off it was like the Lord was just calling me to a just a a fresh Birth really a fresh baptism in the Holy Ghost and uh so that was a nice little bonus so I'm just thankful for the Lord he's my deliver my healer and I'm so free by his grace and by his word praise God praise God anyone else brother Chris since it's not just for youth right praise the Lord so um I just really appreciated what brother Andrew had said about um just uh tonight in that service would be you would go deeper in the Holy Ghost than you've ever experienced before and right along the lines of what brother Nathan ER was saying when Kier and I got to the front of the prayer line there I just um and I'm not one to do this and I'm ashamed I should be but I just put that word in my mouth and I was like Lord that word is for me and my family that word is for me and tonight we're going to go deeper in the Holy Ghost than we've ever been that's for me that's for my wife and I was just you know putting that word in my mouth like that's for us and God really came down in a special way and blessed us and in ways that he hasn't ever done before and and we're deeper in the Lord than we've ever been and and um I've battled for a long time with just an inferiority complex feeling not good enough like you know and feeling like you know like no one loves me or no one cares and honestly it goes deeper than the whole like woe is me you know it's when the devil's on your shoulder making you feel like no one loves you and you know better but the devil's there you know and um I went through the prayer line and and brother Wayne Uh said God deliver him from all those complexes and help him know that we love him and he has a family here and that was just so powerful for me and I'm so thank amen I know I'm not youth either but um Saturday I was excuse me I was sitting there praying and I have been Belling my husband's been gone two and a half years almost and I didn't know of his family still loved me or cared about me I was B on it for a long time and I was laying sitting there praying and I said Lord I don't know why the devil's hitting me so hard tonight so I looked over and I saw my nephew brother Brian hyrin and I said the devil said he doesn't love you I said well we're going to see about that devil so I went over to him and I I said Brian I love you and he says andany I love you too and I always will so that was a prayer answered amen [Music] amen some people are pointing sister [Music] Zoe I actually have two uh when I didn't share at our church last night but I didn't realize until after camp that it had happened um before Camp I had really lost my joy and peace that I hadn't had probably since I was a teenager and after Camp I realized that both of those had been restored to me and I'm so grateful for [Applause] that and uh since it's probably going to be finishing up the testimonies this is appropriate this is actually from the Afterparty um we had planned to feed 500 people and about halfway through the day we realized we did not have enough food um so I prayed specifically that it would multiply enough that we could feed everybody but not that we would be eating it for 3 months and uh we had 2 lbs of meat left over after feeding about 650 [Music] people Glory [Music] Glory well 3 years ago uh at the first true word Camp I went through the prayer line and I tore my achilles in the prayer line in half and I got out of the prayer line extremely confused so the Lord had spoke to me and said one of your legs is shorter than the other and from then on I went through surgery recovery all these different things I had hip problems forever I had sciatica after that I didn't have any problems so fast forward to this year uh I didn't go through the prayer line however I was up praying with sister Jennifer Crossman and just praying over her and uh I stopped praying just listening to the music and I thought about you know if I went through the prayer line I would ask for a deeper walk with the Lord and sister Jennifer she snaps her head up and looks at me and she says what would you go for the prayer line for so I completely collaps over her because the power of God just fell on my seat and I hadn't danced in 13 years I hadn't dance especially because my achilles had tore in half three years ago and well Saturday night I danced before the Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen I had another one written here I won't read the whole thing but another sister had torn her ACL and just danced all over that Campground amen with no pain she said still no pain amen praise the Lord Brother Aaron Thompson had one written down and I apologize brother Aaron I won't read the whole thing because of time let him share it himself but Lord put this poem on his heart and I wanted to end up with this uh just this expression brother Aon said if there was someone who should be gone it was me if there was someone doing wrong it was me if there was someone who tried and tried it was me if there was someone who should have died it was me it was me if there was someone who should have ran it was me if there was someone couldn't understand it was me if there was someone who isn't enough it was me if there was someone who should have given up it was me it's time to move cuz my God Is Bigger Better oh stronger greater than you Hallelujah my

that he's done and is for the glory of God you remember when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost what did Brother Brenham said eternal life was living for us others so now you got the power to live for others not just for yourself but you live to give your life for someone else I know it's getting late I just take a couple minutes here quickly three years ago when Nathan came actually in the back office he said Grandpa you think we could have a youth camp and uh I don't remember how what I said immediately but if I didn't think about it then I didn't think about it how much help it's going to be needed to have a camp and that's what I'm so proud of I know brother Wayne is not here tonight but I'm so proud of a church like this that got right behind the vision brother Ronnie sister police Nathan you're not complete without your wife and I say thank you everybody that caught the vision for the kingdom of God and I say praise His wonderful name I appreciate I appreciate the love in the camp and you know it was just everybody just it was for God's glory and uh I don't know I I think maybe some people just didn't want to give a testimony but you know me as a grandpa uh when I I saw Gabriel and the different ones go through and from the church and others and and I just couldn't help but go pray for Gabriel I don't know what the Lord did for him but I don't even know but all of a sudden I felt another hand laying on my shoulder here was the other grandpa brother Aiden and I tell you what people we put our hearts together in the love of Christ for the kingdom of God and I'll tell you what on the other side you'll see all the results all the results let's pray together one more testimony that I was given to me yesterday by Brother Tom sprouls Jasmine I don't know how
