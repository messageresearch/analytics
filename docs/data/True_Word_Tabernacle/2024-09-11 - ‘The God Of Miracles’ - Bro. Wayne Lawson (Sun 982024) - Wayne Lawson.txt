seek God in his greatness and his power there's never been an age like this one there's never been a group of people on the planet that have experienced and seen the omnipotence of God such as he has displayed in the hour we're living in the greatest display of the omnipotence of the Lord was done in our age there's been more done in the ministry of William brandham than there was in the records of the Bible and he did it in our season 2,000 years after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ he is more powerful this morning than he was 2,000 years ago in the lives of Believers what a powerful time to live what a tremendous day what a tremendous hour want to greet you all in the lovely name of the Lord and amen is you're welcome here this morning and I I would say this if you're

before this congregation before anybody that would see this Lord we willingly admit that we have no abilities Lord we willingly admit Lord that we are standing here helpless as a man but father there's a great gift of anointing that you have placed in this age and Lord if you would just come by and you'd use this human vessel this morning Lord we would give you all the honor and the glory if

you'd make yourself known Lord for those that need Lord touches in their lives and situations father we invite you to come Among Us Lord and be our God we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you this morning and I'd like to invite you to the scripture with me in the Book of Luke uh I want like to go in the first chapter of the Book of Luke uh chap 1: 26 down to 31 uh to you that was here Thursday night forgive me uh we were planning on being in a series this weekend and I just uh the Lord just really spoke something to me on Friday night and and change my entire Direction so you just bear with me and and uh and I just want to speak from here if I can this morning Luke chapter 1 verse 26 and I think it's down to verse 31 and in the sixth month the angel of Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she had saw him she was troubled at this saying and Cas in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son thou sht call his name Jesus I have just a little bit further hang on here let me yeah we're going to verse 38 and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end you know that's all scripture Prophecy of the Messiah then shall Mary then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man now she's questioning the angel inquiring but this is not a question of doubt this is a question how's this going to happen and look what she says seeing that I don't know a man and the angel answered her and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee now that is an answer that the world's not really prepared to take today but that's the answer the angel gave to Mary when you need something impossible how shall it happen the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also the holy thing which shall be born to thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she also conceived in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible ible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word in the angel departed from her God bless you as may be seated this morning I want to speak to you on this uh subject this morning and if I would take a title I want to talk to you about the God of miracles about the God of Miracles for with God nothing shall be imp possible you know I was just uh I was just talking to my my father-in-law God bless you brother ver it's good to have him here this morning and sister Dei and we were coming along the road the other night him and I just had a little time together in the car and we were just speaking and uh we were discussing the situation he said brother Wayne said really what we need is a miracle and I said that's right brother Vernon we could we need a miracle and we were just talking along like that and then later that evening I was in my truck by myself a little while and I was just medit meditating on that we need a miracle and I was just meditating on the idea of of Miracles and uh and uh the presence of God and how it works and I was just meditating that way on Miracles and while I was meditating like that all of a sudden there was a presence just come in my truck and just it's just almost like something that would just vibrate the the presence of God just came so strong and he spoke to me and told me that he still is the god of Miracles and I I think it's I think it's a reality this morning uh that we that we realize that God has not changed now I know that things have changed and times have changed and maybe some of your circumstances have changed but I want to assure you this morning that there's one thing that hasn't changed and that's the god you serve brother bradam will tell us this he'll tell us that this is what happens uh with Mary here in the scripture when she was walking along the way he's so detailed and he said he said I'll tell you what let's do he said let's take a seat beside the road and let's see what happens and he said I see this little girl he said she's about 18 years old and she's coming down the path and he says this is a this is on about a Monday morning and and of course it probably was a Sunday morning then but it's on a Monday morning to us and he said it was on a Monday morning and he said they had just been over to uh they had just been over the day before to the synagogue and they had heard A good sermon that her and her her uh was a husband but it was an espoused husband and it was Joseph and they had been to the meeting and brother Bram said they had heard a tremendous sermon from the from the man of God and he had talked about the God of history and what he had done and all the wonderful things that God had done and when when he began to talk about it she said uh brother Braham says and Joseph and Mary discussed it and got to thinking about well that's that's wonderful but uh but the but the preacher ruined it when he said I wish God still done those things today and you know he says and that's exactly the thing that the the Pharisees could look in the scripture and they could see what God was and what he did but rather when it began to come to this generation he said that's what they would do is put it off to some other day and he says now what happened here is Mary was going along the road and she was thinking on that scripture of how that the Bible says unto us a child is born and a son is given and his name Shall be Called counselor and Prince of Peace of the Mighty God he said she became so interested in that scripture amen that she almost forgot where she was going and started to miss the corner when she noticed a bright light in front of her she thought maybe that it was the sun shining or something like that she said but it was the angel Gabriel that was standing right in her path now sometimes you read about encounters with angels and you think that it's supposed to be some special person or something but this is a 18-year-old girl on her way to do laundry brother Ram told us what she was actually doing she had a a jug on her head and was going down to the whale and she was going to draw some water and do the washing amen now because God interacts with man not just at church but God will come right to you in your normal day right in the middle of you doing your dishes or you cleaning your floor or you're laying your bricks or you're putting up the rafters on the on the thing or you're just driving down the road as a as a Salesman or in a car I think sometimes God must drive these cars cuz I don't know brother JP I've had that anointing hit me in my eyes are full of tears that I couldn't even see to go nowhere and amen you know all those years on the road and I never had any accidents and I don't know how many times I drove down the road my hands up in the air and praising the Lord but you know uh God just encounters right in the middle of even your normal day but the thing about the story that I love so much is brother Bram says she was meditating on that scripture when that angel encountered her amen and I think it's pretty powerful that when when she encountered him amen that's what she was thinking about and brother bam takes it and he says it like this I think it's too bad that the church today doesn't walk in the spirit a more a little more like that he said it's a kind of time when God comes to you he said just like it was when the on the road to emus when cleopas and his friends see they were thinking about Jesus when when he stepped out of the bushes and that's when he came to him uh brother bam will take it a little further and he'll say it was about 2 weeks ago he says I was or three he said I was sitting down by a sycamore tree and I was just telling and began to think and I was thinking about the first time that he declared the new ministry to me and I was starting to draw on that and that's when when he be to come to me now now to think about amen sometimes we get it in our mind that there's got to be some great event there has to be a camp meeting or there has to be a special thing happen you know before God but brother R says he's sitting here next to a sycamore tree and and Mary was walking to the whale and sometimes it's just a man in a room praying or someone going down the road but it's not exactly where you are but more so what you're meditating on of whether it is what comes to you and brother man said of course I'd like to see it where the church would dwell more like that you know in Romans the 8th chapter the Bible said that there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now there's one thing that I found out that we are are men and brother bam says it very clearly that we were never we were never angels and we're never going to be angels that we always are men and we're ever going to be men and and the thing about the grace of God that has saved you is that that God needed somebody to save to have a reason and purpose of being so therefore we're not looking at that you're a perfect person that's not the view that's not that's not what we're looking at but with them that are in Christ them that have accepted the Covenant of the blood and the spirit of God has spoke back into their lives when they walk they walk not after the flesh though they're in the flesh they don't mind the flesh they're not operating by the flesh but yet they're Spirit see that walk after the spirit of God and the and the Bible Paul says it like this for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death now now it's amazing that you can walk in the body of death and not walk under the the under the law of death amen it's not that the law of death is not there it's working on us it's making us older it's making gravity is more affecting us but it yet don't have dominion over us as the scriptures says that we reign in this life by one who is Jesus Christ and the prophets of God said what are we reigning over he said over our over sin over the Flesh and over the devil that even while we're in this body of death we're still reigning over death in that it doesn't have its desired goal in our life amen what is it we walk in the law of the spirit of life and brother man says it like this in God's chosen place of worship he says what is that law of life I have already done it amen if you were here last Sunday we talked a lot about the grace of God Amen of Abraham's Covenant I will which was the one that Adam received after the fall I will amen and the prophet of God said that's what the law of life is Paul's talking about is I've already done it amen see that's Grace it's the law of life God did that for Abraham and his seed after him amen how many Abraham seed we got this morning then there is a law of Life working in you and what is that law that God has already done it brother listen if that ever sinks on the inside of you God has already done it they'll have to clear a running path for the Church of the Living God because every bit of the condemnation on your life will leave you immediately when you recognize God has already did this this is not something that's going to happen but the blood of Jesus Christ has settled the account of the sin death that's against man the prophet of God said matter of fact under your new birth he dismissed the second blood you were born of amen and accounted the blood of Jesus Christ to your life listen there is nothing more powerful than knowing that it's already a finished work come on I'm already saved I'm already confirmed I'm already Vindicated we're already going to have a Rapture we're not going in it we are a part of the Rapture because it's the law of life that works Upon Us brother Bram said That's the Law Christians live by if you're looking to live by law we live by the law of life and that is a law of Grace it's a law of life now somebody said well brother Wayne then then does that mean that the law of sin and death doesn't matter no actually the law of sin and death is still there and is still working and that's why you you struggle that's what you're struggle against is the law of sin and death that's the part of of the life we don't like but there is another law and it's a greater law now the only way best way I know to describe it is you take the law of gravity and and gravity is real if you don't believe in it just jump off a building it'll it'll give you all the teaching you need you don't have to go to college to learn the law of gravity just jump off a building and you'll you'll get an education man it'll happen right quick but but you know there's something about it you go down to the airport and you get in an airplane and the law of gravity is just as real as it always was but there's something about the law of aerodynamics that has the power to Super seeed the law of gravity now there actually I was reading on it last night late and I found out that there are actually Four laws that operate the law of aerodynamics amen some of you some of you flyers in here know those laws and some of you scientists know those laws but I'm going to share them here amen there's four laws to Aviation for the errow of Dynamics and they are lift weight thrust and drag there are four things that operated it's lift and weight and TR thrust and drag in other words that if something is heavy the first law of aerodynamics is there's got to be more lift than there is weight there's got to be more lifting power than there is weight upon the subject I know now why Paul said let us lay aside every weight that would so easily beet us because the lifting power has got to be greater than the weight that's Upon Our Lives listen you ain't going to get off of your chair as long as you're looking at your own works as long as you're looking at your own ability you can't get off of the floor but the moment you accept the blood of Jesus Christ for you and for your life and who you are and where you're going there is a lifting power under the blood of Jesus Christ that can lift a man above the clouds of doubt and fears and troubles everywhere listen I believe there's a law that is working as a law of lifting power and I I I I was thinking it was something else that law has to overcome weight but then the the the the actual law says that there's got to be more thrust than drag in other words you know that's why you look at the uh the planes and they're built uh so streamlined it's because they need to be able to cut through the air so whatever's pushing them needs to be greater than the drag on them that's why you don't see them you you don't see usually parachutes behind uh behind them sometimes they'll drag a a flag but they could wreck real easy if they're not careful cuz they got to keep the throttle on it's got to be a powered ship amen you see them there's got to be a a Thrust that's greater than the drag and I I I think about this because I think about things that lift now if you go back in the uh in the early days of the Egyptians when they built the first pyramids and when even Enoch built his pyramid brother bam tells us this that today we don't have the equipment to do what they done then right back then he said we don't know what they used they must have had something to lift them stones that high you know something to get them they had to have something to get it off the ground ground to place it up there and brother said we don't really have it in this time now but think about what a prophet's talking about Enoch's pyramid and he's talking about how to get the stones way up high that the modern world don't have what it takes to put them Stones up there but I'll say that God has sent a message in this age that has placed the Church of the Living God not down here in the bottom of the pyramid but he's placed her way up high right up there in that capping Stone which is a lifting power and it lifts us above who we are see it's above the identity of your church or it's above the identity of your religion it's above your family it's above who you are as an individual we're talking about the God of Abraham and has come down in this age to lift the church up out of the world and traditions of God and to lift them in his anointing I love how the prophet of God said it's the law of aerodynamics but you know amen we went on past the plane in this age and the church has went on into the astronaut age so there is something that's got to project us Beyond amen the place of coming back down in the airplane you go up you come down you go up you come down but in the astronaut he goes up and he don't come down because he gets beyond the gravity amen that works upon it so there is a place you can go as a believer that where you have broke out into a realm where all things are possible to you you can go somewhere in in your in your world Amen that no matter what day it is no matter what trouble's happening no matter what the issues of Life are there is a place a Believer can go that is beyond the fears it's beyond the doubts it's beyond the troubles amen there's a place where a man can go that it comes into steady sailing in the presence of God you see it's a law I know it's a law of aerodynamics but there is a greater law it is a superseding law and I believe this I believe that it's too bad the church don't walk in that more often and I believe we can I believe it's possible I believe that we are serving a god of Miracles I I don't think this God changes with the situations I I don't believe the god that we serve changes with the weak or with our family life or with whatever it is that you're facing God don't change like that but he's Remains the Same outside the situation and I thank God for that kind of God the one that can remain the same you know I don't know if you've ever took a lot of time to do it but it's a pretty interesting study if you start looking in into miracles in the Bible and you know if you go in just and just a general just a general look at miracles in the Bible do you know there's over 80 in the Old Testament and more over 80 something more that's in the New Testament we're talking about just Miracles but those Miracles are not just uh uh just just little things but rather great exp exp exponential of the power of God that's made known you know if you go back and you say well you know the God we serve really what can he do well you know he created the heavens and the earth now the to to to worship something brother B said that object is God so you can worship the piano and you can worship your husband you can worship your wife you can worship your church you can worship your preacher you can worship your life you you can worship a lot of things and that made it God because that's the object you worship but when we speak of the God we're serving his name is Elohim meaning he is a self-existent God he is no God of our making but rather we didn't make our God but he made us and he developed Us in such a way that we amen are a part of his creation the same God Amen think about this Elijah the same God Amen that put the heavens up there that hung the stars in their place is the same God that watches over our church service this morning think about that the god that hung the heavens and put Jupiter and Mars and all the stars and Scattered him my that's the same God looking over this service this morning that God who create that atmosphere and put all of that together that's the same God Amen that walked down there one day and made man right out of the out of the uh of the the dust of the earth and then later remember when man fell he was the same God walked out there one day and saw Enoch in a fallen condition and said come on go walk with me amen and after about 365 years of fellowshipping he just took him from one dimension to another what a miracle working God do you not realize that's the god that we're serving in this generation and this bride is to be a generation of people that will change their bodies just like Enoch changed his body and if Enoch changed his body how did he do it he fellowshipped with Elohim until his body changed and I believe this morning that we can fellowship with Elohim God comes down and fellowships with his church and how does he Fellowship he walks with you in the word of God you can walk daily in the word of God and as you fellowship with him your fellowshipping with the same one that could pull the floods and cover the Earth 40 days with water you're you're fellowshipping with the one that could call fire down out of the heavens and destroy the sodomites in in in in Sodom and gomorra that same God was the one that turned that turned Lot's wife into a pillar of salt went down and changed Sarah's body that's the same God that give a hundredy old man a child but he didn't just give him a child he gave him a new body to have a child because that's the God we serve this morning because he's able Church he's more than able to do whatever exceedingly and abundantly above what even you can think or ask I'm talking about God I'm talking about the God that could call a man like Moses from a burning bush and talk to a 80-year old man in such a way that he get under such an influence that he could go down and deliver two and a half million people out of the hand of the greatest armies in the world and what to do with them when he gets them out you think about this man that kind of God that that Moses was serving you know he went down and just told him I was reading quite some details on it this morning I thought it was amazing he went down and told Pharaoh he said turn the people lose and Pharaoh laughs at him we're going to let a 2 and a half million slave Workforce go they're power in all of Egypt man do you see he wasn't about to let let him go but God the god of Miracles used those miracles for that Exodus and watch he began to drop plagues on them I I was reading about it this morning I thought it was pretty amazing because some of these miracles do you know that that The Magicians did them exactly like Moses did them but in every case they could do them but they couldn't take them away see they can bring on Plague but they can't take plagues away but the god that you and I serve amen not only does he bring them he can take them amen he can heal that sick body he can change that situation of your life because he's God he can he can he can just in a moment make it lead your Coast you know I was reading here how God brought frogs and you know Moses prophesies they'll fill the houses and the pots and the lakes and the rivers and and they'll just feel the land will you get that many frogs but the God we serve created the first frog can he create the rest of them frogs and when all them frogs got where they was Pharaoh said Mercy y'all go on out of the country but as soon as as Moses turned around and took the frogs out of the coast just like that frogs left the coast and when they left Pharaoh said well forget it y'all stay a while see that must not have been nothing Supernatural or the or the symptoms wouldn't wouldn't have quit like that see I know you went to the hospital for a stroke but when you got there you said well something's wrong and it maybe it was misjudged and something happened to take it and Pharaoh will always say it wasn't as bad as we first thought no it's not as bad as we first thought because there was a god that we prayed to my mother's been in three different three different stroke episodes where her literally was stroking out and we begin to pray and she don't live today with one effect of any stroke she's ever had because the god of Miracles could step on the SE and he can remove whatever it is the devil is trying to do I know we go through things but amen but years amen don't have to be the subject God of Miracles can change it in a moment I was just reading here of the things that God was doing hey man now do y'all realize the level of of of of of of of of what happens when hell just rains upon their crops and rains upon their country it almost don't leave anything right be phara Pharaoh wouldn't let him go so Moses CS hell and the god of Miracles brings hell and fire upon it and you would think that would be enough but then Moses turns around and CS the Locust to come and eat what's left yeah and then when and when Pharaoh's had enough he just tells them to leave and they all leave because the god of Miracles has the power not just in a little bitty situation but he's a great big God friends I was I was just reading y'all forgive me I get to read and I get to think about things and I think about this darkness that covered the Earth and how that God would be able to move a church out under that kind of a situation and it never touched their homes right because he was such an ability to separate that he could come down and lead them in the middle of a Wilderness and they get out there they got 2 and a half million people and and and of course when they get up to the Red Sea of course they're going to think that the god that brought plagues and took them away and brought two and a half million people out of captivity overnight of course this Red Sea is going to stop them isn't it amazing how we forget the hand of God just a couple days ago they saw all of that and now they're standing there amen thinking they're going to have to die at the Red Sea but there's something that hadn't changed their location had changed the circumstance had changed but the god that had delivered them was right there with them listen let me say this morning he made a promise to remain with the Church of the Living God brother Ram said he'll be with us till we get to that millennium he's not going to leave us in this lead of sea he's not going to leave us in our struggles and in our trials he promised to remain with us and as long as he's with us he is the god of Miracles listen I I I was just reading here that they of course they cross the Red Sea and there's no way to explain that but God right and others couldn't follow them they get on the other side and you got two and a half million people get thirsty what hole you going to water them in so we we found out they come up to some Waters and they were bitter but the god of Miracles said I can take bitter water make it [Applause] sweet that's kind of God you want to run around with cuz there's going to be bitter things happen but he can take the bitter and make it sweet you you see the the Hebrew children went into the fire they really went into the fire but because they were with the god of Abraham because they were with the god of Miracles God took the heat out of the fire that's the kind of God he is you can be in the most fiery trial of your life but God can take the heat out of it and you'll find out God can fellowship with you in that fire and get the best Fellowship of your life you're going through the greatest struggle you've ever been in your life and God come down and fellowship with you in it and i' I preached on a bunch of times I don't want to repr preach on it but but you all heard brother Brown tell the story when Jesus went in there the fourth man went in with the Flames with them he said he reached up and got a palm leaf off of the Sea of life and brought it down there and was Fanning the Flames he said there if you would have looked in there you would have saw them Hebrew children sitting around the fire talking yeah they were fellowshipping with the Lord amen in the middle of that flame I got to wonder what they Fellowship about what in the world did the Lord talk to them about in the middle of that flame I've got a prophet you know what he said he said they were talking about their future there they were in the world worst thing in their life and God was talking about them what they're going to do tomorrow listen I don't know where you are or what kind of situation you are in get you a book and an ink pen and start fellowshipping with the Lord and write down what God is going to do for you tomorrow what he going to do for you next month if the doctors told you that you got cancer and you're going to die get you a notebook and start making plans you don't have to listen to the devil he does not control the future of this church nor does it control the future of a Believer because God who is rich in Mercy is the god of Miracles and I I I I there's way too many for me to get into them but I I'll just say this God that same God walking with them he was the one brought that water out of the rock y'all heard his preach on it Thursday night it was Unreal when you get to studying the millions and billions of gallons of water that was flowing out if you wasn't here we figured out this just just by simple math we fig from Richard it ain't simple to me but simple math we figured out that that there was 40 times the forest coming out of that rock than there was coming out of Old Faithful out there in the park 40 times the amount of water and I and I'll just say this y'all don't think that water went out there and running the ground do you there was there was people out there miles away from Israel drinking water and thought that their gods were blessing them they were right in songs down there 5 Mile Away saying amen worshiping some some God or something drinking water but everything they got was they was getting because Israel was there let me say today if there's any inspiration on the earth it's because God has opened up a message for the Bride of Jesus Christ every song that's written every inspiration that's given you say oh they preached A good sermon it's our water brother oh they had a good point it's my water amen song don't belong to the world it belongs to you how do you know that God didn't have that woman right scattered just for you who do you think God has more on his mind I know what he's got on his mind he's got this Bride on his mind and even before Moses before the water in the rock it was a bride coming in the last day and this message was already in the mind of God how he would bring it out of such a simple place now the amount of water that was coming out there was insane and so I just was reading this morning or yesterday I was listening to the tape called Jehovah of Miracles and as I was listening to the tape brother randam got talking about Moses and he got talking about the grace of God and he says uh oh I'm all messed up here sorry un cth no manners you visitors forgive me but you thank you that was one Moses Moses got him out there and the Book of Numbers records this this it's very powerful the way this recorded is that people got tired not having meat so remember they wanted they wanted meat and you know what God did he told him said I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to bring meat but not for a day I'm going to bring meat not for a week we I'm going to bring it for a month it's going to be so much that it's going to run out your nostrils H now you know where it comes from they got enough money it runs out their nose you really you know where that comes from you ever hear it so well they got so much they got so much gas that's running out their nose so much Heen it's running out their nostrils it's quail and you know the Bible said that there was a there was a wind come up off of the sea and blew Quail into their camp now you think about this because the Bible goes on to say I I've got some of the figures written down here I better get to them they're too important to miss you you get into these uh oh boy somewhere you get into these numbers and and the scripture says that they was so many quail that they were three or two cubits high now that's about one meter 3 feet it's three three feet I'm I'm probably got to get high on me to get three feet but 3 feet 3 foot high in any way you walked out of the camp it was a Day's Journey oh now the quail was 3T deep and it was a day Journey any direction you took off to walk out of them Quail y'all got any clue now I was thinking maybe a 23 mile a day thing that was 7.2 trillion Quail but if you back it off to 15 just to make up for some of the slower people 15 miles walking a day walk 15 miles we went up brother Richard come up with 2 trillion Quail that's trillion folks now it's going to surprise you to know this there's only 35 million Quail population in the world where' they get all them Quil there's only 35 million in the whole world and there was 2 and A2 trillion laying around the camp because God is is a god of Miracles he created the first Quail he can create Quail 3ot deep if he wants to because he remains to be God you know that the Bible goes on to say there were 600,000 uh fighting men right in that same scripture there was 600,000 fighting men and brother bandam goes on to say that there was about two Quail per meal per person he said there had to been at least five million Quail he's talking about one meal God's talking about one month so if you took six quails a day per person you end up with a lot think about that now now when we got to when we got to figuring that we we went okay now the scripture says this it actually says this it says that he that gathered the least gathered 55 bushels some say 70 bushels but it was uh 10 hmer so he that gathered the least if you had 600,000 men Gathering no women no children just the men Gathering you're talking about 33,000 bushels of quail there's a lot of leftovers folks there was a lot of things out there God when he does something he don't have to just do a little bit he can do so much that you don't know what to do with it God said he would open up the heavens and pour out his blessings until you cannot contain it listen God has said goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life my God don't have to just dribble out a little blessing he can bless you from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet he can bless your finances he can bless your family he can bless your church he can bless your life and he don't just do it a little bit he does it in abundance because he's the god of Miracles he can do all of that and he still got Quail left over he don't have to just dribble things out brother man said we have untapped resources as a Church of the Living God Amen because God who is rich in Mercy now I'm not going to get into the other 160 definite miracles in the Bible but I think it's amazing when you sit down and begin to examine that what kind of God you know what brother B does in Jehovah Miracles he takes this story of Mary meditating on the Lord and shows that this is how she had the encounter with the angel was she was thinking about what was preached yesterday at church and she was thinking about the scripture that had been shared and while she had that on her mind that's when he came near to her brother bam tells us this that's what happened out there when I was sitting next to that sycamore tree now watch the Bible says this that if you submit yourself therefore to God if you will resist the devil he will flee from you and if you draw nigh to God He will draw nigh to you now think about this God of heaven will draw nigh to you when you draw nigh to him how do I draw nigh to God get the scripture on your mind meditate upon the goodness of God get to thinking about the presence of God and angels will come in the room where you're sitting I tell you this amen the Bible tells us this brother Bram brought this scripture to Life by meditating upon it for verily I say unto thee that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou moved and cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe the things which he say shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith brother bam says it like this he said I'd get that on my mind and I just couldn't get away from it and everywhere I'd go it would constantly come to me if you say to this mountain be thou plucked and cast and sea don't doubt in your heart but shall believe he says see this just kept coming and he said i' just think about this and then I'd think well that's before the atonement or that's after the atonement and he said I would say well you know if if you say then what have I got to do with it cuz I can't create he says but what it is it's your attitude toward the blessing of the atonement it's how do you think about the atonement what's your attitude y'all know that attitude's also another uh uh aerodynamic law attitude it's how the the plane is set up is how it flies because you can be flying get the wrong attitude you don't get nowhere you fly real slow that's free but it's your attitude toward the blessing see that's the thing what's your attitude toward the atonement listen it brother bam says it like this as far as God is concerned that's what I'm worried about what's God concerned with what's God thinking about as far as God was concerned I was saved when Jesus [Music] died Hallelujah Lord I was saved when Jesus died as far as God is concerned well brother I'll take that I'll accept that right now I'll accept that I won't accept any other thought than that one well if you do this or if you do this or if you do that no sir I don't want none of those thoughts as far as God is concerned I was saved when he went to Calvary I say I accept it and by the grace of God I'll stand on it and if I shout or if I don't shout if I get energy or if I don't get energy amen if if I feel good if I feel bad early in the morning late at night it makes no difference to me at all he said as far as God is concerned I was saved well brother Wayne what about this what about this what about the word what about the God of Heaven that is eternal life his word means more than all the critics and all the thoughts God said it I believe it brother that settles it in this life amen as far as God is concerned that's what I'm worried about brother Ram says it like this I was saved but it'll never do me no good till it's revealed to me he's the son of God and I've accepted it and every scripture is the same and every scripture is the same Divine Healing is for you come on John Guthrie Hallelujah Divine Healing is for you it's not for the 1960s it's not for the back in the 1500s it's not back in Luther's day or Wesley's day but Divine Healing is for John Guthrie as a testimony God heals cancer sitting right in the building right now God will pick somebody and prove his word by that person and God don't ever have to prove it again I can preach it all over the world he's a Healer of cancer if he never does it again brother I've got a case of it sitting here but I got a lot more than one case I got a lot more than one case that God healed cancer brother ver brother sitting right there his dad was sitting in a meeting just like this maybe a little different but something near it and he was sitting this and the pastor was telling a testimony about a Gorder falling off of a woman's neck in the middle of a prayer line and what he was telling it his dad sitting there with a cancer on his arm he said well if God did that for that woman he can do this for me and he went to rub it and the thing fell off in the floor because the god of Miracles is a cancer killing god sister Barb he didn't just do it for verin's Daddy but sitting right in this building the atmosphere got so right that that cancer dropped right off of her what happened brother the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost that's how it works that's how the power of God is it's not all of my mental intellect and how well I can put it together it's whether or not I believe in the atoning power of the blood of Jesus Christ that brings the spirit of God comes in this room and changes lives yes sir that's how it happened that's how it happened see that's how it takes place how it happened in my new ministry it's a powerful section brother BR said in my new ministry he said I was sitting there next to that sycamore tree and he said the scripture just kept coming to me now that's pretty powerful that that scripture just kept coming to me and he said see I was there for about a half hour before I could get to the rest of the boys and I thought I'll just study that scripture now he had that scripture in his mind and while he's studying that scripture something come along and said to him I got to talking to myself he said and after a while I realized it was somebody else and he said I become so conscious till I was talking to someone and something said to me that's in the atonement for if a man or a woman is so concentrated and surrendered to God that God moves in and uses their voice and it isn't the man speaking it's God that's in him speaking oh Brothers God getting in a man speaking see for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou moved and cast in the sea and won't doubt it in his heart but Shall Believe the things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith it's not because of the man that's saying it it's because of the god of Miracles that's using the vocal cords to speak it brother bam tells us that this is actually the age now you read about in Romans 8 and and people say well this age ain't really no different other age I beg dep pardon it is a great difference this is the age of the manifestation of the sons of God from Romans the 18th chapter and the e8th chapter and the 19th verse the Bible tells us that the whole creation waited for this manifestation of sons and that manifestation is today do youall know why the seals actually opened youall know what that it wasn't just so we could take it and intellectually talk about it and distribute it and and move with it brother random said God opened these things he said because he was going to manifest through the sons of God who you know the scripture teaches we are here that's the reason God is opening these things because God is bringing Sons into manifestation that's why the seals open because God is bringing Sons into manifestation there are people setting in this building this morning I'm not just talking about in the message General but I'm talking about mature Sons and Daughters of God sitting in this building I believe that there's a church on the road tonight I believe it's here 1953 brother Ram said it's com and I believe tonight there this morning we can announce it's here the church is here there's a bride here she's on the Earth today and brother bam said when the power of the Living God will speak the word here and there it'll flash like lightning a church coming out not a bunch of psychologist or put on or make believes but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called church now you say preacher how's that going to happen brother Bram said when the human element goes out when the human element goes out the deity the element takes over see when the human element is set aside when you quit getting caught up in your human side when you quit telling God you can't do this through me because I did this because I said because I thought because I felt as long as you're in that Dimension Satan will rule your life the rest of your life but the moment you step out of I can and I can and I will and I do and step over in God has supplied every need of mine through the blood of Jesus Christ listen the blood ain't just enough to save you it's enough to save the whole world it's not just enough to save the Old Testament but the New Testament and it's so powerful it's so powerful that the very ones throughout the ages that have persecuted this name in Israel is going to get saved after the fact explain that to me you won't do it through you won't do it through natural theology at some point you're going to have to tell you it's the grace of God right that great church will go forth in the power do you know what the prophet said about the church he said it'll come to pass in this church that missing lims will be added in the middle of your service y'all know why he said that he said that because he prayed for somebody with leukemia in the back room and they were healed and brother B said the only way that leukemia could be healed is God would have get in the blood cell and change it and he said if God can get in the blood cell and change it he can get in the blood cell and grow a limb he made the first one he growed the first body why can't he grow a body amen somebody said well brother amen y'all got brother Jim here that's all right Jim's in the line right now he told me the other day I I want to get to be the first one that does it listen there's a there's a power sweeping to the Church of the Living God listen this is a last and final sleep not only will he get new legs you'll get a new body not only will the church get new this and new that we'll get a body that can walk from one dimension to another because I'm walking with a god of Miracles the age has changed but Brother Andy God ain't changed the same God that met me at the altar we'll meet your young people at the altar the same God that gave me the Holy Ghost I Lov it I was listen to brother Brandon this morning Amen brother Aiden you'll like this he said that same God that put the color in the flower put the holy ghost in my [Applause] heart if he can put the color in the flower he can put the holy spirit in your life my Lord to think about that God he can create it he'll do it again y'all say well brother brother Wayne that's a long time coming that's a long ways off I was preaching a meeting over in Norway just a few years ago and I got to preaching on the Seven stars of The Book of Revelations and I got the name in those stars from Paul all the way to the seventh star and when I got to that seventh one I said his name is a man named William brandham the seventh angel of God that had the message to the L out of see and age and fulfill the seventh angel of Revelations 10 and when I announced that seventh angel was a man named William brandham there was a woman sitting in the back of the medium of leukemia a year later she came up to me and she said brother Wayne I know you never even prayed for me she said but I was sitting in that meeting when you were preaching on the Myster of seven stars and she said when you said the Seven Stars a man named William brandom there was a sweet hot feeling started at the top of my head and went clear through to the bottom of my feet she said brother I've been completely healed of leukemia listen that's the reason brother bam said that lims would be added because the god of Miracles the god of William brandom is the god of Wayne Lawson he's the god of Ry Ericson he's the god of true Earth Tabernacle he's my God and I worship him as the god of Miracles he's not dead he's not a stone Idol he's not a history lesson he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble brother there ain't nothing too big there ain't nothing that's too wrong that my God cannot fix it yes sir he's God he is God and there is none like him so well you're going to move mountains listen de can I know there's been entire entire uh teachings that John 14:12 doesn't belong to the church that's a lie out of the pit a hell that is a hindering demon that has tried to rob you of the privilege of the end time message that God has ministered to you a Divine gift of the spoken word it's part of our inheritance folks somebody said well he that he that believeth it was a personal pronoun really what about where the Bible said he that believeth have eternal life is that personal too is that just one person come on come on Church what about it he that overcometh shall I grant a set with me is that just personal too come on church or does that he represent many people come on I believe it I believe William brandom represented this bride I believe as a part of this bride body he was a prophet of the age and he was a sheath waved I believe the first mature son stood in this earth he was waved Over The People Under The Gift of the third pool but the Bible tells us that when you wave a sheath it's just for the acceptance of the field and if there was a sheath there's a field if there was one wheat there's a field full of Wheat and there's a seed in this age a bride that knows the god of Abraham is the god of Miracles listen there is nothing impossible with you there is nothing impossible with this church doesn't make no difference what the circumstance God can change it God can make it different listen you said well brother Wayne I don't know if John 14 fits with me brother BR said if it didn't you've got amnesia come on Mark 11 says if you say to this mountain joh brother B ties John 14:12 to Mark 11 if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart it shall come to pass can you be identified there to believe that that is the truth if it hasn't you got spiritual Amnesia you have forgot you have lost your Christian balance when you tell me the spoken word don't belong to the individual in this church you have lost your balance you have took God and put him on one man but the Bible doesn't say in this age I know in Isaiah 7 it says behold Isaiah 9:6 he says the government should be on his shoulders and he shall come forth and his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us that's not the prophecy of this age William brandom did not come under the prophecy of God With Us it wasn't all God in a prophet and the church just stood by and there was no power but the Bible said yet a little while the world seeth me no more but Jes shall see me for I will be with you even to the end of the Earth it's the eye he's in the house he's in the House Church listen if God is in you the god of Miracles is in you then there is no weapon that is form that can prosper against the Church of the Living God I say there is nothing that can defeat her because God is in her [Applause] oh yeah so what are you talking about the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity it's Tabernacle in deity I know people are talking right now a lot of a lot of Atomic Warfare is talked and Russia's talking who's got the biggest bombs and the most power in the world well I got news for Putin and I got news for Biden he probably couldn't hear it but I got news for him the greatest power in the world is not an atomic bomb but a Believer that's in contact with his maker you are the most powerful force on the face of the Earth there is not enough demons to defeat the church there is not enough power in hell to stop this church because the god of Miracles that been created the Earth is in [Applause] her I know in the middle of the trials it seems I know what it does you sit and watch a condition and it it starts to affect you yeah but get a visitation with that angel just a little while just get a visitation with him and it'll change your view you know the funny thing we were we were discussing this yesterday brother Brian and I was talking and we were talking about things that happen in families and situations and we were we were discussing needs and and we were talking about and he said well the Lord has spoke several things to him and I said you know the power of that is brother Brian when God speaks to you it changes your focus you can be looking at the worst situation you can imagine but you're not looking at it like other people are looking at it because you fellowship with somebody that's about to change it listen I know if you if you're in the dark on everything you don't know what's happening out there and why that big mess is in our front yard but we got plans we got plans and if you come back in a year there's going to be something set out there amen that's going to show you what we started with and it looks like a mess now but there's something coming and you may be looking at a mess in your life saying I don't know how this could be and I don't know what this could be but don't you never forget the Bible it said all things work together for the good of them that love God n amen if God be for us who can be against us we are more than conquerors in all things who Christ Jesus our lord there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that'll stop the Church of the Living God I'm not lost my mind I visited with the angel he said tell them I'm the god of [Applause] Miracles somebody has a reputation for doing something and you go to find them and you find out they died you found out you can't get what they had but the one that does Miracles Rachel he's not in the grave the same one that made the blind seea is walking Among Us this morning the same one that made the get up out of their chairs is with us this morning the same one said rise up take your bed and go home is with us this morning he still is the god at [Applause] [Music] Miracles I'm not uh I'm out of out of getting getting short on time but I'll tell you this I gu something on my heart on it's burning real strong all right you meditate upon scripture and that scripture becomes living to you the prophet of God said keep your heart tuned in with God that's when he appears watch this Solomon said as a man thinketh so is he now brother man said now watch here's here's Five Points that he makes on thinking I I I actually numbered them if you want them I can give them to you he says see thinketh it's all one paragraph but I just numbered them he said you get to thinking this you're one of his children Hallelujah if I'm one of his kids you tell me really if your daddy owns a thousand a cattle on a thousand hills and he can wave his hand give you whatever you want whenever you want whenever you not everybody's got access to that wealth but his children children and brother R said the first thought you need to keep in your mind is you're his child don't let no devil talk you out of that you're his child then and now watch this you don't think maybe that it has power but let me let me assure you this the power of thought can whip every demon in this room if it's placed on the right thing you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about a man named shamgar standing out in the middle of a field 600 coming at him and because we've had a prophet he could tell us what he was thinking brother bandam told us what he was thinking he told us what other people was thinking and he was right why couldn't we believe he he knew what shamgar was thinking and shamgar was thinking I can't let him come and take another crop my family's not going to make it if I do so shamgar brother BR said had this thought I am a Seed of Abraham I'm a Seed of Abraham and there's a promise over Abraham's seed I will conquer every gate of my enemy if I'm the Seed of Abraham I am a possessor of Heaven and Earth if I'm a Seed of Abraham as a blessing over my life if I'm a Seed of Abraham there is no gate there is nothing that I cannot conquer if you ever get it in your heart I'm a Seed of Abraham that thought alone put a lock nood in a man's hand he killed 600 Philistines in one fight yeah man somebody said he was powerful no he just got the right thought brother B said you're one of his children number two that he saved you you ever get that in your mind he found you then you ain't going to be worried about him losing you if if you found him okay I got you this is all your doing you come you can walk you found him you can lose him but if you ever realize he found [Applause] you they sang the song he found me when I was nothing that's the way he finds you and if he found you keep that on your mind keep on your mind he's good to you God's good to you am look at look and I don't have time to preach God's good to you look at Eve look at Eve leaving in the Garden of Eden look how good God was to her Satan said well he don't want you to know truth he just don't want you to know the difference of good like God's goodness was somehow evil anytime Satan interprets something to you that's the way it comes out I learned that I learned that the hard way I learned that my wife's not here this morning I learned that because we went through a situation where after years after Bethany was born she prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed for a baby and and she conceived four or five years after Bethany we're going to have this baby and we've told the whole world and she's she's right on the end of it and the doctors are saying you don't need to continue uh you need to have some surgeries and things happen and so all of a sudden we had all this wonderful thing we're telling the whole world and she loses the baby and all the a sudden Satan rushes in and says well you done this wrong well you done this wrong this is why the baby was happening this is something you said this to that and that person said this and this did this and and you know what's what's funny is he didn't just offer one idea he offered all the ideas until one hit and you know how you know which one hits is the one you stop and talk to other people about it's the one you meditate on it's the one he can put he can pour out a thousand ideas and none of them if ffect you but he finally finds that one spot is't that amazing he tells the same lie to a thousand people and only affects you because you have an open spot for that devil and when he starts twisting it look what he do he'll take you out of the garden and put you in pain and misery and trials and all kinds of situations God ain't good and God's got this and God's got that and that's exactly what the devil will do but brother get a fellowship with the Lord and it'll change the way you view everything every perception will change around your life you'll see everything differently you know God's good brother M says and you think on this you know that you love him well I know that but how he loves you can I just say this he loves me cuz he said so listen it's not because the sun shines for me it's cuz he said so cuz tomorrow it'll get cloud you don't know how powerful these thoughts are you don't realize the depth of this it's not a cloudy Sky that's not a sign of God's disapproval nor is a sunny sign I was dedicating the church one time and it was down in the area North Carolina these they's got to be 35 churches in that General region I used to stay in the hotel and preach for six churches same Hotel preached the same sermon they loved it just Believers you know all a bunch of believers they just different churches it's okay I don't mind but they was dedicating a new one one of our friends was Bill M man we was we went down and helped him dedicate it and I got in the middle of the dedic just walked out to dedicate it and the lights went off and I could hear it I'm not trying to say I got a gift I'm just telling you sometimes I can hear you thought but I could hear it oh God didn't want a church here dedicating the lights turn off God didn't want a church here and all of a sudden I could feel the pressure of that coming and you know what happened right out of my soul come something cloudy skies are not a sign of God's disapproval and it killed that devil right there just killed him dead the lights are on or the lights are off who cares I got money in my pocket or I don't who cares listen that has nothing to do with God's love for me he loved me because he said he loved me God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he come all the way from Heaven just for you that trumps every trial that trumps every problem he died for me how can I ignore that and say well I had a flat tire God must not love me and deny his death of course he loves you he said he loves you and when you begin to meditate upon this you begin to find the power of that meditation you find the power because the angel begins to visit you and when when he begins to visit you he reminds you of the power of those Miracles that he works in your life listen I know I know how the devil Works yes sure you need a miracle but God will do it tomorrow isn't that it you believe he does Miracles but he's going to do it tomorrow he's going to do it for somebody else he's going to do it next week he's going to do it in a month God's going to do a miracle but it's going to be later do you know the way that you perform a miracle how many knows you can perform Miracles yeah come on come on you may teach you how I'll teach you you how right now cuz I got a word on it I tell you how you perform a miracle brother Bram said what Mary did is she took the word and never waited for any evidence from anybody else she took the word in the channel of faith and never waited for anybody else's word she never went and ask anybody else what do you think about this how do you feel do you think this is possible do you think this could be what do you think this amen she said be it unto me according to Thy Word and brother she didn't let the she didn't let the testimony get cold she didn't wait a week before she told somebody she didn't wait for doctor's reports or pregnancy reports or nothing else she ran down to Elizabeth's house and begin to tell that I expecting a child brother Bram said in the face of all criticisms she just started praising God anyhow and he said that's exactly what the Church of the Living God ought to begin to do is praise God before you have the evidence you say oh brother Wayne I don't know if we are to testify because I don't know if I'm Healed yet you were healed that day on Calvary when 39 Stripes is put into his body I don't know what your feeling is I don't know what your situation is but I know what he did at Calvary listen you got every right as a Christian to confess whatever God paid for is yours you got a right to begin this and take the word of God and start rejoicing that is the way Miracles are performed directly that is the way Miracles are performed when you took God's word and begin to believe for the impossible you begin to take promises amen and call them present tense I know you think about waiting but listen hope is something that Waits faith is something that believes it's now Faith is what gets a hold of the word and says it's already happened it's happened right see Faith takes over in the place of hope and then you begin to call it present tense it already belongs ons to me that's what that's what happens when God begins to fail see it changes it changes your view of things now I can give you scripture on that for the Bible says if if you if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart shall be moved but then read the verse after it it said when you begin to pray believe that you have it and you shall watch two two two different phrases When you pray believe that you receive them brother Bram said There It Is call it present te T he said and ye shall there's your future tense yeah if you start right now in present tense you'll have it in future tense but if you wait for it to change you won't never get it the Bible said he's the high priest of our confession you said preacher are you building false hope I am not I am building solidly upon the Eternal Word of almighty God it is proven and Vindicated and I am a personal witness that it works I was just reading this morning about this God and I was reading how that in brother Bam's own Ministry and how he he went he went into a an area and he prophesied you you know this one but I I just I thought it was so amazing and he prophesies over a woman remember she has an ulcer and her friend actually has a gerer on her neck yeah and he says that the Lord spoke and said thus sayith the Lord you're healed and they went home and brother B said when they got home he says now her husband was a Christian too but when this woman got to testifying he said the neighbors begin to talk about her and said now wait a minute you're going to bring a reproach on the name of the Lord you better be careful and brother Bram says see but she said look I taped that tape and it was not him that said that part it was the Lord that spoke to me so she kept with it she kept with it you know why she kept with it cuz she knew was talking to her she kept with it you know what that's a whole takee perseverance right perseverance is because you keep with it you stay with it it's hard but you stay with it it's trouble but you stay with it you stay with it when they laugh at you you stay with it when people make fun of you but you stay with it cuz you know God's talked to you and brother B says it like this and one morning he says the children went to school and her husband went to work and she was a washing dishes I thought I'd shout myself out the office when I read that you mean tell me this woman is just washing dishes and she just meditating on that meeting and what God said to her and brother Brandon says she was standing there washing dishes and all at once this real cool feeling just went over her and she never thought nothing about it but in just a moment she got real hungry she you you see she just stayed with it listen this gets close even in your home brother Bram said her husband said to her honey I don't mind you having faith but you're bringing a reproach upon the very cause of Christ how that how little brother Bram said did that husband know you can't do that when you're confessing the word of God right how little did that man know you can't do that when you're telling them the word of God brother Bram is is is takes it to a to a man with pausy and brother R says he prayed for this man and somebody was telling him about it and he said the fellow just he said he was under this py and said he he prophesied over him told him he was healed he said he went back home and he said it was weeks and weeks later and he said this man was telling the whole Community how he was healed and they kept coming to him and kept saying to him but you're a reproach to the cause of Christ you still shaking and you're saying you're healed and brother mam said that he said that the man said but wait a minute you wasn't in that meeting he said you didn't see the blind eyes were opening in that meeting I seen cripples get up and walk and that same man that said thus say the Lord turned and looked at me and said I was healed and I believe him and they said well what about that shaking he said he don't have anything to do with it and that's the key that's the key point it don't have nothing to do with it when you visit with the angel nothing else matters it don't matter if your body's still sick you can say thank God I'm Healed if you're still hurting you're still healed because your confession changes to what he tells you you know I I had a personal I had a personal uh if you heard this testimony forgive me for telling it again but I had a personal personal happening where a lady in our church brother Vern and them knew her sister Dena and she had a stroke she came to church and she come up on a Sunday morning morning and her hand was pulled like this in her leg and she'd come all the way up the aisle and she was just dragging the foot and she was just doing this she come up right here and I come over there and she said brother Wayne she said would you pray for me God heal me this stroke and I said sister Dena I certainly will and I prayed for her and when I got done I said now go confess that you've been healed she said she said son she her and I were real close she's such a lovely lady she said to me she said she said Son listen I got a daughter that's a nurse and the moment that I go go home limping and tell them I'm Healed they're going to get all over me I said sister de it don't matter it ain't it don't matter you just go you just go confess the word of God and you know what that night she come brother Roan as long as I live I'll never forget it she come back up that same aisle I was actually sitting over on the side another brother was preaching from out of town and when I seen her coming I thought wonder what she's W so I got up and went to the platform hold and I picked up a mic just like this one and I went to the platform and I said sister Dena what do you want and I thought she was going to want to get prayed for again you know cuz she was still limping and she said brother Wayne She said I just wanted to come up here before the church and testify God healed me this morning oh and with that crippled hand she reached out and took that mic from me and that leg straightened out and I watched that woman Dance all the way across that building no she didn't go to weab no she didn't she didn't go through a special class somebody said what was that woman doing dancing in your church well let me tell you this if you were crippled and the god of Heaven come down in the service and changed your body you'd feel like dancing too matter of fact sometimes I feel like dancing anyhow just thinking about the glory of God that come upon that woman because my God is a god of Miracles that's the same God brother Vernon sitting right there was had a heart he had an aphb he couldn't go to Australia me and Bethy he's going to Australia he couldn't go with us cuz apib I went down and spent a week with him and he said couldn't he couldn't get down the hall anybody ever had apib around him by a he couldn't get down the hall he just his heart rate would just do this dropped down probably in the 30s didn't he and he couldn't hard to get around he was dizzy and he set in the chair had that aib going and me and him we got to talk in one day and I I said brother Vernon I had this shoulder that I messed up lifting weights and I said I couldn't even lift two lbs with it and I said one morning I decided I was going to get this thing prayed for and which Aston knows I mean he was trying to get me to get an MRI and he's like Wayne and nor I'm not against that I'm really not but but something in me I felt like if they operated my shoulder would never be the same again that's way I felt my heart and so I got to pray and and I picked up some scriptures on Psalms 102 for I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases and I found it over in the book of Peter for he has healed Us by his stripes we are healed in Isaiah 53 and I seen it in James 5 and I picked up them scriptures and y'all may think I'm crazy but I'd take a walk in the morning and I'd move my arm like this and I'd say in the name of Jesus he is the Lord that Health all my diseases he's the one that created this body Satan in the name of Jesus God God created this shoulder and this this went on for months for mon I listen I'd wake up middle night if I moved my sheets and there's no way I drove with this hand couldn't happen I I carried that thing around and kind of hid it a little bit and one night I was preaching Tim PR's camp meetings and it was in that may meeting down in that building and I was preaching spirit of God was moving and it felt just like somebody walked up with their pointing finger and stuck me right in the shoulder blade and I felt that thing pop like that and I threw my shoulder back and I I kind of covered over brother Carri you know how you do when you're preaching you don't let everybody know what's happening and so I just kept on preaching and I'm walking around like and it's killing me I mean there's a pain running down and I was thinking Devil's saying to you you barely messed that thing up now you're messed up you ain't going to get out of this building so I I I got through the meeting and I'm walking out the door and I'm kind of feel funny my shoulder feels funny and I'm walking out the door I thought de Lord what have I done to my shoulder and the Lord spoke to me and he said it's your healing you know what I did I went home and I started taking a couple pounds and moving it and then I started taking about four lbs and moving then I started taking 50 lbs and moving it then I started taking 100 lb and moving it and you know what happened day by day that shoulder repaired and you know and if I wasn't getting older I could still just lift just as much as ever it didn't happen in a day but God changed it that moment you say it wasn't a miracle it was to me somebody changed me something blood don't run in your shoulder folks if you got a tore rotor cuff you just got a tore rotor cuff unless you fellowship with that angel then the one that made the rotor cuff can repair the rotor cuff we talk like that amen and a couple weeks they scheduled him a heart surgery to fix that and and so we went over there and I flew in we went with him we went down to the back room and they took him in the back and they shaved his chest and everything had him laying there and I walked in there with him and we was going to pray with him to get it over and and while he's laying in there they they couldn't get the apib to work so then they inject medicine you know how they do so they inject medicine to make it work and they couldn't make it work and they kept doing it kept doing it and after a while they just looked at him and said sir I'm sorry we just can't perform this surgery do you know what he ain't never had that surgery you know why all the way to the surgeon's hand all the way to the surgeon hand it was there but God stepped in in and moved it in the last minute he's that kind of God this [Applause] morning I'll just stay on the Hoffman Family a minute his mama went into a surgery and I don't know what she was getting surgery on and they pulled her arm or something a certain way roll TI your cuff and when she come out she couldn't lift her hand up she she couldn't fix your you know what your girls means she couldn't fix your hair she had one hand she was an older sister but she had a lot of hair she couldn't fix her hair sister Barb she wore her hair similar to yours actually can you imagine imagine you can't get your hands up can't fix your hair and she she finally went to the doctor and she said look doc look I know you did something I know something's happened because I'm not right I'm not going to sue you I don't even believe in lawsuits she said but I would like to know what happened and he said honey he said we cut a nerve now I don't know enough about medicine to know what that means but we cut something we shouldn't have cut and we're sorry she said it's okay I just wanted to know so couple weeks later whatever she's going down the road they come up to yard sell wasn't special it's a yard she's yard selling Brothers lay off few girls something wonderful might happen yard selling she's yard selling and she gets out of the car and she steps up on the grass and when she steps on the grass she thinks she says you know brother brandom said they can get to the moon but they can't explain the life in that grass and she said I got to thinking about God and how he was in that grass and she said all of a sudden I threw up both hands and started praising the Lord oh my see in just that thought a healing struck her body because she was fellowshipping with the Lord you know that same God is in this
