[14:56] case it'll be
[14:57] as the lord leads of course
[14:59] as the ministry feels if it is the case
[15:01] we we have some brothers and sisters um
[15:04] already prepared
[15:05] uh to support that with directing the
[15:07] flow the deacons and some of the sisters
[15:09] so so they're they're selected and um
[15:12] and uh so just
[15:14] we actually just uh
[15:16] um
[15:17] let that have an uh an orderly fashion
[15:20] stay out of the way and if you know as
[15:22] they need to direct it just be
[15:24] respectful of that
[15:25] amen
[15:27] today we had uh we know we got quite a
[15:29] few families visiting on the grounds
[15:31] during the day and at night
[15:33] it's a little bit of an issue there's a
[15:34] lot of young children running around and
[15:36] so just we ask the parents please keep
[15:38] an eye close eye on your children
[15:41] especially over here in the gym there's
[15:42] really no activities for for younger
[15:44] children that are not campers to be at
[15:47] the gym there's no activities there for
[15:48] them so so keep them in this area with
[15:50] the playground and everything if you
[15:52] would please
[15:54] some of you already know there's some
[15:56] there's some stickers some nice little
[15:58] stickers if you want a little keepsake
[16:00] from the camp see sister felice about
[16:02] those please do not
[16:04] stick those to anything we don't own
[16:07] actually don't stick it to anything you
[16:08] don't own
[16:09] and we'll be all right because i found
[16:11] one on my golf cart
[16:12] earlier and and i don't want to i don't
[16:15] want to name another rule already
[16:18] so
[16:19] hey man we told the young people this
[16:21] morning of course you know this youth
[16:22] camp is a very young event
[16:24] and so these brothers that know that
[16:26] over the years you know
[16:28] you start out just thinking everything's
[16:30] common sense and then
[16:32] as time goes on people create reasons
[16:34] for new rules and so what i said we'll
[16:37] do is uh every time we need a new rule
[16:39] we're going to name it after the person
[16:40] who's the reason
[16:43] hey man so yeah like
[16:45] like for instance the cross rule
[16:48] which is don't try to get a rule named
[16:50] after yourself
[16:52] that's the cross rule and
[16:54] and you don't want to know about the
[16:55] lindsay rule

[1:02:57] on the light i've been on i've been on
[1:02:59] this subject of the light for some time
[1:03:01] at home but i want to speak on the light
[1:03:04] the chain breaker
[1:03:05] the chain breaker genesis 1 and verse 1
[1:03:08] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:03:11] and the earth
[1:03:12] and the earth was without form and void
[1:03:15] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:03:17] deep
[1:03:18] and the spirit of god
[1:03:20] moved upon the face of the waters
[1:03:22] and god said
[1:03:24] let there be light
[1:03:26] and there was light
[1:03:28] and god saw the light that it was good
[1:03:31] and god divided the light from the
[1:03:33] darkness
[1:03:34] and god called the light day and the
[1:03:37] darkness he called night
[1:03:39] and the evening and the morning were the
[1:03:41] first day amen we let you be seated
[1:03:48] in the power of transformation the
[1:03:50] prophet says the bible said that the
[1:03:51] word
[1:03:52] or the the world was without form and
[1:03:55] was void
[1:03:56] there was nothing but just a darkness or
[1:03:59] chaos
[1:04:00] he said what a horrible shape it must
[1:04:03] have been in nothing but way into the
[1:04:05] darkness there without light
[1:04:08] churnings of the waters
[1:04:10] that wandering star twisting around
[1:04:13] and out of orbit it must have been a
[1:04:16] terrific mass of something lost that
[1:04:19] just couldn't find his way
[1:04:21] and he said that's what we become when
[1:04:23] we are we are wandering stars we're away
[1:04:26] from god we're without hope and without
[1:04:29] god there is no hope
[1:04:31] amen just turning around out in darkness
[1:04:34] not knowing where we're going but god
[1:04:36] took that great chaos of darkness and
[1:04:40] transformed it into a garden of eden
[1:04:43] amen by his word that's how we are
[1:04:46] transformed formed by the word of god
[1:04:48] when god said let there be light that
[1:04:51] mass of creation out there came over and
[1:04:54] the sun began to shine upon it began it
[1:04:57] began to revolve around the sun and it
[1:04:59] became a garden of eden because it
[1:05:02] obeyed the word of god it done the
[1:05:05] perfect will of god in which transformed
[1:05:08] out of chaos into a garden of eden by
[1:05:11] the word of god here it was laying in
[1:05:13] this condition but the bible says the
[1:05:16] spirit of god began to move
[1:05:19] and the spirit of god began to move and
[1:05:21] the word was spoke and said let there be
[1:05:23] light and when the word was spoke the
[1:05:26] dynamics was there to bring the word to
[1:05:28] pass
[1:05:29] amen the spirit of god in that moment
[1:05:32] proved it was greater than the darkness
[1:05:34] that covered the earth it proved it was
[1:05:37] greater than the nothingness that was
[1:05:38] there it proved it was greater than the
[1:05:40] gloom that was there it was greater than
[1:05:43] the coldness that was upon the earth the
[1:05:45] light began to dawn upon the earth for
[1:05:48] the first time and no doubt the gloom
[1:05:50] and the coldness and the darkness tried
[1:05:52] to congeal together and tried to bind
[1:05:55] together to hold its position but it
[1:05:57] could not because the spirit of god was
[1:06:00] greater than the darkness
[1:06:02] amen the light proved in that moment it
[1:06:04] was greater than darkness and we can you
[1:06:06] can have just a little portion of light
[1:06:08] and it'll push back darkness amen every
[1:06:11] time light shows it's greater than
[1:06:13] darkness you know this morning when you
[1:06:15] got up and you looked at the sun
[1:06:18] do you realize you was looking at the
[1:06:19] very spoken word of god and it was
[1:06:22] spoken millions or whatever years ago
[1:06:24] and it's still hanging in this place
[1:06:26] today amen shining every morning pushing
[1:06:29] back the darkness showing you every
[1:06:31] morning amen the bible said his mercies
[1:06:33] are new every morning it's showing you
[1:06:35] every morning i'm still greater than
[1:06:37] darkness it doesn't matter how bad it is
[1:06:40] how hard it is how terrible it is i am
[1:06:43] greater than the darkness amen i am
[1:06:45] greater than the spirits of the world
[1:06:47] and the things that are around now we
[1:06:49] know the time that we're living in
[1:06:50] especially as it seems like it gets get
[1:06:52] seemingly gets worse and worse every
[1:06:54] year and let me just give you a news
[1:06:56] flash it's going to continue to get
[1:06:58] worse amen as this world goes out back
[1:07:00] out into utter chaos and darkness and
[1:07:03] into the tribulation amen this world and
[1:07:05] the world systems is not going to get
[1:07:07] better it's going to get worse the age
[1:07:10] that we're living in is not going to get
[1:07:11] better it's going to get worse but every
[1:07:13] time amen when you see that sun shining
[1:07:16] it ought to remind you every morning
[1:07:19] that i'm still greater than the darkness
[1:07:21] so it does not matter how great the
[1:07:23] darkness is going to get it does not
[1:07:25] matter if you can't see your hand in
[1:07:27] front of your face that s-o-n is still
[1:07:29] greater than every dark spirit of hell
[1:07:32] it's still greater than every darkness
[1:07:34] of this world it can come together you
[1:07:36] can line every devil up and amen he's
[1:07:38] going to bring them it's been opened out
[1:07:40] of the river euphrates and the enemy has
[1:07:42] pulled satan into this round and it's
[1:07:44] getting darker and it's getting you
[1:07:46] every morning i'm still greater than the
[1:07:48] darkness
[1:07:50] amen you feel the warmth of this rays as
[1:07:52] it bathes over you it stands there as a
[1:07:54] sign proving that the light of god is
[1:07:57] still greater than any darkness that
[1:07:59] could ever hold a child of god it's
[1:08:02] greater than any coldness that could
[1:08:04] ever get upon you it's greater than any
[1:08:06] lukewarmness that can ever settle over
[1:08:08] your spirit it's greater than any gloom
[1:08:10] any depression any emptiness any
[1:08:12] nervousness any anxiety it's greater
[1:08:15] than any spirit of the enemy if you let
[1:08:17] the spirit of god begin to move the
[1:08:20] light will begin to shine
[1:08:22] amen if you let the spirit of god begin
[1:08:25] to move that's why it's important that
[1:08:27] the spirit of god is free to move in our
[1:08:29] midst it's important that we have the
[1:08:31] atmosphere that the spirit of god can
[1:08:33] begin to go out and begin to touch
[1:08:35] hearts and lives because if the spirit
[1:08:37] of god is there the light's not going to
[1:08:39] shine or if the spirit of god is not
[1:08:41] there the light is not going to shine
[1:08:43] but that spirit begins to move and that
[1:08:45] word begins to speak and the light
[1:08:47] begins to drive back the darkness and
[1:08:50] it'll drive coldness out of lives and
[1:08:52] bursts can take place and change of
[1:08:54] hearts can happen and what happens the
[1:08:56] spirit of the lord begins to move
[1:08:59] amen begins to break chains off of each
[1:09:01] and everyone's life he said you know
[1:09:03] what brother bran would say like this he
[1:09:04] said i know that each and every one of
[1:09:06] you you feel like i do i'm so hungry to
[1:09:09] see the spirit of god moving
[1:09:13] i hope we don't get past that
[1:09:15] i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god
[1:09:18] moving
[1:09:19] some experiences i just had up in the
[1:09:21] mountain just to feel that once again
[1:09:25] what kind of experiences he got to
