down there in Virginia but you're growing so quickly you must have more potent food down there say praise the Lord welcome the family this morning before I take this child in my arms I want to give a little testimony here for this couple the baby's name is Briella Grace and they actually had a first name another first name picked out but when Elizabeth was in labor she called out the name Briella and so that's how the name Briella came about I kind of was reminded of the Hebrew mothers isn't that right brother John the Hebrew mother's calling out that name and placing them in their position so I say to God be the glory you know we're just so blessed in this congregation with new generations and you know God knows every one of them and these parents are Holy Ghost parents these children that are born here and raised under such a lineage they have a great opportunity as they have become an age of accountability to serve the Lord Jesus with all their hearts if I could just have Briella let's pray together please father we put our hearts together as a congregation as we give this child back to you as you have given her to them you know better than all how to take care of her on her life's journey remember the prophet of God and things that are to be he's telling about how a child of God their life is all pre-planned and Father I remember even the prophet saying before the foundation of the world God knew our desire so Lord Briella Grace Briella means strength to bring forth I believe something like that God is my strength is that right I believe God is my strength so Lord we pray now that you keep her healthy that you'll help her parents give them leadership and direction and give them Grace to raise her in the fear and the admonition of the Lord Jesus Christ father we dedicate her to you in your lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you God bless you Elizabeth God bless you Stephen God bless you good to see you man God bless you guys are

to hear all these these things uh uh it's it's been such a blessing I want to thank each one of you that's making that a a priority in your life to take time to do that and bless these musicians and amen it's been such a powerful thing to see it um I don't know if you're if you're keeping up with it some of you that have children are keeping up with the young people but God has gave us a real blessing in our youth here and and he's given us some leaders that are that are got burdens for it and he's gave us a lot of parents who are corresponding with that and they're making it possible you know well John in the world we're living in uh there's a lot of there's a lot of criticism of a lot of things a lot of people but what I found is a spirit of Grace and of love that takes time to help mend our young people and to bring them into Grace and love and I stopped in Tuesday night over by the carries and brother Nathan had held one of the youth meetings there and I think there was over 40 in your in your front yard and uh and they were spread all over the house and they opened their home and and their you know what it is to have 40 young people in your house and and it just was overwhelming my I I every time I think about it I just weep to think that God has put it in the heart of people to love these young people to love to take time and efforts and and I thank the Lord for them amen and the grace and and we appreciate it amen it takes a it takes an entire church with that on their heart we've enjoyed the singing today and it's been a blessing we have one more baby

baby and I thought he probably dedicated Elizabeth as well uh and uh look folks we thank God for our brother Erickson here I was just I won't take time but I was reflecting this morning just thinking

Hallelujah how many Blues he's worthy in every praise all the praise amen is due Our God Amen you can be seated just for a moment and I know time is precious but I just wanted to say how honored we are to be here and I certainly appreciate uh Brother Ray and and uh I tell you you're a blessed Church I have Brother Ray and brother Wayne also and to see what God is is doing here is just a real special thing I don't know if you know how special it is but it's not a very common thing but it's very precious and very special and to see uh two brothers that can work in Perfect Harmony and uh that just takes the Holy Spirit and uh it's a it's a special um it's um you know it takes men that are surrendered and yielded to God and so um real Dishonored to to be here and to be considered their friend and your friend but I wanted to give a quick testimony um and I hope you uh I hope you don't think that we're trying to be boastful in any kind of way because we certainly are not are not doing that but you know the Lord has blessed us and we've just built a church there at home and I know you're getting ready to build a church here and and so the Lord has blessed us and we just dedicated it last month and um just uh you know I look at it and I know that it's just God you know it just what God has done and but over the years there was uh the Lord laid upon our heart a couple times to help some Churches and specifically with their heating and air systems when they were either building a church or remodeling a church the Lord just laid it on our heart got a brother there in the church at home and that does that and he's able to get equipment and things and and so through that channel we were just Lord elated on our heart to to help a couple of churches with their and we bought and paid for their systems and and helped them in that way and I've never even shared this with my church but they don't even really know that we probably did that but but uh but we did but um and uh you know but the scripture says cast your bread on the water and and uh and and I'll just tell you how powerful the word is because when we got ready to build a church our church the Lord laid it upon the heart of a brother in this church my brother Hayden and um and he bought equipment for iron Heating and Air in our church and uh it was just a tremendous blessing and I don't know how to say thank you but I'll just try the best I can and say thank you from the bottom of my heart I we appreciate it and we know that it's just God and and I tell you you'll never out give God and whatever you do for God it'll be returned to you amen and I'll just say this I'm not um but you'll get back more than you gave amen and I'm a witness of that so we just so appreciate that this morning and so we'll just ask you to stand and we'll just go right into the word maybe we could just buy our heads and approach the author before we read Lord Jesus we just come before you and we thank you Lord for this great opportunity that you've given us this morning Lord here we are together with your people on the first day of the week in the honor of your Resurrection and Lord it's a great privilege and a great honor to be here Lord in your presence Lord where you said where two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in the midst and Lord we're certainly Lord in all of your presence and we know God that Lord where you are and we believe that you're here Lord because you promised to be here and Lord because of that Lord we have a great expectation Lord we realize God that all things are possible Lord I believe with all my heart that Lord if there be any sick among us this morning they can leave healed Lord if there's any oppressed they could leave delivered Lord because you are here and so God we give you preeminence in this service Lord we put you in the highest Place Lord we lift you up Lord as a supreme one Among Us God Lord we lord we're not going to invite you and leave you sit in the corner this morning but we're inviting you Lord and we're making you feel welcome Lord you walk the aisles you Lord do the things that you want to do God the Lord may this service Lord be in your hands and may it be pleasing to you father Lord we give ourselves to you now For Your Glory in Jesus name amen amen amen Philippians chapter 2 . and I'll read from verse 5. if it's okay I'm just gonna pick up from last night and continue on and a little I got some things in my heart this morning so you just bear with us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made of himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even to death of the cross I'd like to read one verse again out of First Corinthians 2 and verse 16. or who hadn't known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen aren't you thankful to this morning that you got the mind of Christ amen God bless you as your seated this morning you pray for me and I'll try not to repeat myself from last night too much but want to move into a little bit deeper into this this scripture this morning and you know as I as I went and as we looked at last night that brother Brown picked this up there in the unveiling of God and and uh he took the scripture and showed that the how that it was God and morphe and he was changing his form because the scripture says being in form of God so he thought it not robbery to be equal with God but then he took on the form of a servant so he was changing his form and I was just going to read a couple of quotes to build a little Foundation but they're in the questions and answers in 1964 he said and then God became material in a man called Jesus Christ which was his son and the son gave his life that he might bring other Sons that God might become tangible working in all and all that in that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me I knew and you and me and brother around says Oh Brother that'll be a real day amen you won't have to join or drive or go from Birmingham to hear the message the message will be right with us then see amen amen that'll be a how many knows that the prophet took that scripture and says at that day ye shall know he said what day that day is this day amen so you're living in the day that you shall know these things and amen and there again in the in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ the prophet said the life that was in the grain or is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus now this is a powerful statement the same Jesus in Bride form amen the same power same church same thing same word so now uh he's he's remember it's God amorpha he's changing his mask or changing his form amen he as we looked at last night he appeared unto them in another form so amen it was the same God but in a different form amen and that's what you got to realize this morning that amen that you got to recognize God Amen in whatever form that he's in is that right amen and how many believes he's here in the form of the word he's he's here in the Holy Spirit this morning amen but he's also according to the prophet he's here in Bride form so even the same God Amen and morphe has changed his mask again amen changed his form again so there in the unveiling of God he said God changed himself he changes his form if you notice here in Philippians he said not thing not thinking it robbery see but he took the full form of a man see that word morphe means amen the form by which a person or a thing strikes the vision amen is the external appearance so amen and now the prophet said he come down see the Greek word means something that could not be seen yet it's there and it's changed and the eye can catch it even so amen the invisible God is going to change his form amen into something that you can see is that right he said like Elijah they're at Dothan C the servant couldn't see all them angels that was around there God just changed amen not brought the Angels down amen but he changed the seeing of the servancy amen there was a mountain full of angels and fire and Horses of fire Chariots of Fire all around the prophet amen see and they change he changed the scene the thing was already there amen so that's what I'm trying to say the god that always was is here hallelujah how many believes it this morning the god that always was is here amen God is in this building amen Christ is here oh my and who's this melchized I know you know these quotes but he said it's like television even there's another dimension even television people are moving right through this room right now singing There's colors also but the eyes only subject see the five senses your whole being is subject to the five senses amen and you are only subject to what sight has been limited to see but there's another dimension that can be seen by transformation amen by television and our television does not manufacture a picture it only channels it into a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the picture is there to begin with television was here when Adam was here television was here when Elijah said on Mount Carmel television was here when Jesus of Nazareth walked the shores of Galilee but you're just now discovering it see they wouldn't have believed it back there you've been crazy to have said something like that but now it's become a reality and so it is that Christ is here the angels of God are here here and someday in the great Millennium to come it'll be more real than television or anything else because they are here amen and he reveals himself in the great form of what he claimed as he amorphies himself into his servant and proves himself amen now here he is in the form of the spirit and then he comes in the form now amen that he appeared to Abraham now catch this because brother Brown is showing you how he come amen from the word to flesh is that right amen remember God and morphe he's he's changing his mask and what that brother around saying amen he just took a a handful of dust and he and blew himself a body and he's God stepped into that body appeared to Abraham is that right and Abraham saw God in flesh is that right amen the same God Amen revealing himself to Abraham Amen in flesh now amen amen and what did he do when he was there amen he began to reveal the secrets of the heart amen but it was God it was God Amen it veiled in a flesh body amen and listen he didn't lose amen any of his deity when he took on the form of Flesh he still remained God hallelujah amen and then amen that was in the beginning of the Bible in the Book of Genesis amen but then Amen in the middle of the Bible here he comes amen and God takes a a creates a blood cell the prophecy and wraps himself in it amen this time he didn't take a handful of dust and and blow a body and step into that body even but now for the purpose of redemption hallelujah amen because he had to be a kinsman redeemer hey but he had to be born of a woman is that right amen Elizabeth God could not redeem you as a logos God could not redeem you as eternal spirit God could not redeem you as a pillar of fire he had to become flesh he had to be a kinsman redeemer amen he had to be born of a woman so God created a blood cell and wrapped himself in it what a powerful revelation amen and God Amen became a man see they had the whole thing mixed up even because the Bible says that they looked at Jesus amen and they and and and the trouble that they had with him is they thought it was a man trying to make himself God but Jesus was not a man trying to make himself God it was God that had made himself a man hallelujah amen that's the Revelation and I tell you this he was no less God Amen in the man Christ Jesus even then he was in heaven Hallelujah and by that blood and the redeeming work of that blood in this day I hope y'all can take it amen God took a man born just like you and born just like me Hallelujah this time it was not a sinless amen a virgin birth even but he took a man Hallelujah I was born in sin but hadrid had been redeemed by the power of the blood of Calvary and God stepped into flesh Hallelujah and he borrowed a body and spoke their lips hallelujah amen and he was no less God Amen in William random than he was when he met Abraham glory amen and he ain't no less God in you well I know they tell you you're you're taking something don't belong to you even they're trying to tell you you're robbing from God Amen Saint John 14 12 8 for you it was only for the prophet amen these things these even the power of God Amen ain't for you is only for amen it's just for the prophet it's just for the ministry it was just for the apostles amen but I tell you it's a lie it's a devil's lie it is not robbery Hallelujah you are not taking something that don't belong to you it's a promise and I challenge you this morning reach out and take it late claims to it Hallelujah let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but watch this in verse because I'm gonna now you're just gonna have to stay with me for a few minutes because but Jesus is going to reveal to you what deity looks like in humanity how it would talk how it would walk how it would live everybody I understand he made of himself no reputation he took on the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men he humbled himself brother Brown said in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said remember God don't have enough stuffed out shirts when you get the place that you're willing to be nothing then God can make something out of you as long as you're trying to be big and a lot of Flowery advertisement and all this stuff's going on in my opinion Something's Happened see Jesus went along doing good going to the poor and the needy he never made a himself a reputation did you ever think of that he made of himself no reputation the man that made the artificial tooth made a reputation for himself but the one that made the real tooth never made a reputation the man that made the artificial arm amen made a reputation for himself but the man who made the real arm made of himself no reputation the Way Up Is Down I always remember that be humble be sweet be kind and then Brethren says be creative it almost don't seem like that that fits in that statement but he said be humble be sweet be kind be creative let Christ be in you and then he goes straight in this thought he said did you ever see people that you love to be around you just love them to be around them because they create an atmosphere amen a Heavenly and you just like to be around them then there's others they're good people but you know I I just you gotta I have to get away once in a while I'm so glad brother Graham said this because you know you feel that way and it makes you feel good that a prophet felt that way too he said you know what I mean and yet they seem to be good people it's not creative he said but but you a man was made to be a god we know that Genesis 1 26 he had a dominion over the Earth he was made to be an amateur God and when when he receives God he becomes a Son of God again he was made in the image of God God had hands God had feet so there's therefore a man is made like him so he is an amateur God he said but sin has blinded every fiber in his body in his mind and his heart you were made to have dominion you are made an amateur God we created Power sometimes we think about these things we got an idea of what that means but listen where the Prophet said amen listen I'll tell you a good place for us to start create an atmosphere you say what don't brother don't you believe we're gonna take the world over one day don't you believe that we're going back to Eden we're going to take the Earth back where I do but friends I want to tell you we're never going to ruin Reign on this Earth until we ruin Reign this Earth we gotta get to a place that amen we can amen take control amen of our surroundings of the atmosphere created Power laying in a man see but it comes in humility brother Ben said humble that in the message humble thyself you know people want Power but they don't really know what power is they don't really know amen what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want piracy how humble you can get just get away from all the worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ see to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble a real humble not an arrogancy a church that's just sweet and humble and I'll show you a church that has favor and the power of God in it that's right it that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God Amen letting God just work through us and I want to say something right here and listen friends I'm not here to try to Pat nobody on the back and I'm not just there's no um I'm being as real as I can be I see that here I see that here I see that humility I see something listen there's something special in this church don't never lose it you worship you you praise God there's a life there's there's a there's a a reality there's a there you you come in here you feel the presence of God Amen but I tell you what it ain't no workup it's real I mean there's something special about amen I come in this church I see something clean I don't know how else to say it I just amen when I when I when I every time I've been in this church amen that's what comes in my that's a clean church amen and I tell you what that that is a result amen of a Ministry that will preach the word because the word is what cleanses him in the church hallelujah amen amen thank God you got a pastor amen you got amen you got Brother Ray you got now brother Wayne and these brothers have lifted up the word Hallelujah that's what it takes amen sometimes we think oh a great church would be amen you know the biggest group or or they'd have this or they'd have their whatever you might even imagine amen the greatest Church would be amen but I'll tell you amen of Prophecy show me a church that's humble show me a church maybe not an arrogant Church maybe not not not a a church amen The Listener is because what happens amen if we're not careful we'll begin to make it all about us and it's all about or it's a it's a Ministry or or it's the gift an appropriate or or it's the Bill Norris this or it's that he may not tell you this if we ever lose sight of this amen that it's not about us amen it's all about him and there's only one supreme one Among Us and his name is Jesus Christ hallelujah amen he is a king of kings and the Lord of lords he says I always found out that the man that humbles himself is a man that God exalts when you take a person with his chest out knows everything you can't tell him nothing he's arrogant that person never gets anywhere but you take that person that'll humble themselves and walk sweetly listen friends God will exalt him people get the wrong impression it's powerful brother Birmingham told us he said people get the wrong impression of the anointing or what the anointing is they think the anointing is just a bunch of noise and amen again I'm making it clear to you it's just so there's no mistaking this I love noise brother Brown said everywhere Jesus was there was noise Jesus might have been a quiet man and spoke softly but I tell you what the people around him made a lot of noise so hallelujah thank God for the I ain't trying to quieten you down but I'm telling you the prophet said people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is and he showed the greatest anointing that was on any man was on Jesus Christ and he went down into the temple one day took the book from the hand of the priest amen read the scripture said this day the scripture is fulfilled and he sat down in Precious words amen come from his lips even that was what he did with the anointing and brother round comes to a place he said the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control amen knowing exactly what to do and how and that's what's here Hallelujah I said that's what's here listeners we are not just a Pentecostal church with a bunch of hide they've been in a Big World Cup anyway no that's not what this is and don't you ever even take even this precious anointing amen this thing that God has given us in this day and bring it down to just a good feeling or just a uh something or an emotion it's the power of God hallelujah it's supreme power in control it's knowing what to do and how to do it comes in humility see that's what that's deity in humanity Jesus come to a place I'm gonna tell you the victory was one in the garden you say whim when he said when he said not my will listen he done that as a man the weight of the world on his shoulders pressure so great his sweat come as blood amen and he come to a place amen that he surrendered his will you want Power you want to see the third pull you want to see the power of the spoken word amen let's get to a place where we are surrendering our will to his will Hallelujah even when we conquer the Flesh and bring us flesh subject to the word of God then we'll see the power of God then we'll see the realities amen of the scripture amen coming to power amen God will reveal himself in human flesh emptied himself he might have himself no reputation that actually is kinos brother Branham takes it and the more common translation is even that he emptied himself but you got to be careful of how you see that because Jesus did not empty himself of his deity he took on Humanity see he could not become less God are you with me even as a king that lays aside it's like the man the king you know you've heard it told how the king he wanted he wanted to be he wanted to know he wanted to understand he wanted to understand what what the people how they lived and what they experienced and the things that they went through and the things that they suffered and even so he knew I can't do this as a king I can't do this Amen on the throne so he lay aside amen he took off his robe he lay his crown down he he left the throne he dressed himself in the clothes of a common man he walked among the common people is that right that he might understand them but listen amen while he was walking even he didn't have a robeone he didn't have a crown on he wasn't on the throne he was still the king hallelujah amen he was just as much King rubbing shoulders even with a common vote walking through the amen walking through the streets walking through the markets amen he Elizabeth is he was just as much King there his word had just as much power [Applause] he did not lose even his Dominion when he changed his fart and neither did Jesus Christ Hebrews chapter 2. in verse 16. for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham is that right wherefore in all things it behooved him to make him like his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted Amen brother Brown said he took on the seat of Abraham he become a man God made flesh among us to redeem us oh what a blessed savior there's just no way to write it there's no way to explain it it's just bought Beyond explaining amen Noah no one can explain how great it is How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art God had to become Kinfolk to us he had to come down as a man suffer be tempted be laughed at made fun of persecuted ignored call Beelzebub scoffed out suffered death under capital punishment amen he had to be Kinfolk to us he had to be falsely accused because you're falsely accused he had to Bear sickness because you are sick amen he had to Bear sins because it was your sins the Bible says that he might be a faithful murder that's why that's why but he he didn't come here he didn't even come as a as a full-grown man he's born as a child and he didn't have to do that he humbled himself he didn't have to come that way he humbled himself he was born as a child I mean he grew up as a child so that all you young people could pray to him and know that he understands what it is to be a teenager he didn't bypass that part he knows what it is to be where you are he come that way that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest he's submit listen he didn't have to have a headache deity was in him he never had to suffer one moment you don't believe that he even told Peter put your sword up Peter don't you know I could call the Lee I could call Legions of angels right now to deliver me but then the word wouldn't be fulfilled he humbled himself to that he submitted himself to that he chose amen listen friends I I think of the humility of Christ think about this could you imagine brother Brown said I don't and you know I'm not trying to cross any Doctrine here so but but I'm just I'll just say what the prophet said he said it was Jehovah in the manger crying over a manure pile could you imagine amen Jehovah God manifested in flesh and he had to Humble himself to be raised he had to listen to his mom and daddy could you imagine God In the Flesh I remember I'm showing you what deity looks like in humanity amen and here amen he humbles himself he didn't come down to the Earth and become a CEO of a greatest company in the in the no he was a helper in a carpenter's shop Hallelujah so the next time you think you're too good to work just remember Jesus did [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah amen listen he humbled himself even think about this I've thought about this a lot here is a as as a 12 year old boy he walks into the town and confounds them with his wisdom the word was wrote in every fiber of his being Brother Ray but he had the greatest gift that a man would ever ever would have or ever will have the greatest Ministry that there could ever been but you know with all that locked up with it inside of him he didn't even start his ministry until he was 30 years old because he humbled himself to the will of God he could have preached the greatest sermons even he could he could have the greatest Ministry he could have done it as a teenager he could have done it in his twenties come on Sir don't tell me he couldn't he could have done it at any time he chose to do it but he humbled himself well I'll tell you it's good for us preachers to remind ourselves of that because we get the idea sometimes it's somebody else wasn't in my way I'd preach every meeting in the country or somebody else amen wasn't in my way then I'd be the even one of the top preachers and amen or or you know and we got such a great ministry and such a power even though somebody just give me a chance or somebody amen but the problem is is there's politics and you can and you and you get a chip on your shoulder and a complex because God has put a gift in your life amen but I say this if you'll just let go of all that and let God use you whenever he wants to use you however he wants to use you then you'll see the supernatural humble yourself Jesus humbled himself in every way in his ministry in his life you don't think you don't think he had desires as a man there was a there was a human part you know he had desires the Bible says he was tempted in every point yet without sin things unfulfilled desires he he he there was no no doubt maybe as he walked here as a man he he could have desired to have a companion maybe to have children but you know what he laid all that aside because God already gave him a bride and he says she's worth waiting on Hallelujah he was looking at you and he laid down his his natural Earthly desires because he already had a bride it was already a promise he already he already knew he was going to have children he already knew he was going to have seed [Music] he humbled himself humbled himself all the way even to the death of the cross this is complete opposite of Satan Lucifer the actual name Lucifer means light bearer The Shining one the Morning Star Amen brother Ben would come on and say look he he was he was uh even uh co-equal with God in all but creation right there I believe it would say it this way he was God's right-hand man even right there amen but the Book of Ezekiel talks about Ezekiel 28 Amen in verse 12 says son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou seal us up the sun full of wisdom perfect and Beauty now I've seen in uh or thou has been in Eden rather The Garden of God every precious stone was I covering the the the Sardis the topaz the diamond and on and on it goes amen and the workmanship of thy tablets out of thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub now look at this word this is he's speaking of Satan Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth I have said thee so thou is upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created till iniquity was found in thee amen and uh and what was that iniquity amen that iniquity was that he desired a position that didn't belong to him look in Isaiah 14. how are thou falling from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning Howard thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart for thou has said in thine heart is that right I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit in the Mount of the congregation and the size of the Lord I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high amen look at just in those couple verses how many times you hear I will I will Ascend I will be I will I will exalt amen let me tell you sir I'm identifying a spirit amen the spirit of Christ will reveal itself in humility amen but the spirit of the Antichrist amen will will always be exalting yourself I will ascend but the Bible say yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit watch brother Brown and Satan's Eden now over here with the scriptures in Thessalonians he sits in the temple of God exalting himself above all this called God so that he is as that he as God is worshiped as God upon the Earth there's a God of this world I preached about last Sunday here he is today in deceit within this treacherous hour this tremendous time that we're living in the most glorious time of all the ages but we're facing or because we're facing the great Millennium again we're facing again but right at this age all the deceit every tactic that he's ever used has been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself and come down like God and he's put himself in the place of God religious can quote scripture tell you the scripture just like Satan did to even the garden but leave one spot out that's all he has to do to make a gap so the poison doctrine of the devil can pour through there even though I said he would exalt himself above the most high with a sin above the clouds and the Stars he would sit there like God and be the most high and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age that's exactly how he's done it in every age now the prophet is showing you Satan has been successful he's had a marvelous success in carrying out his strength to be worshiped as God Amen to sit in the temple of God being worshiped ask God Amen but watch amen he said he has had a marvelously by how by the people allowing him to explain away the value of God's promised word for the age let me tell you something I ain't gonna have no part in Satan's success is there anybody with me this morning I will have no part in Satan success so anything or anybody or any voice that be values or belittles amen what God has done in our generation are the message of this hour I refuse to accept it or hear it hallelujah it's Satan's success sitting in the temple of God being worshiped as God there was no other agent because Satan brother Ben said no other days no every time it was called the God of this evil age she is his ambition to be like God from the very beginning it was his ambition to be like God Amen Satan desires the throne he desires worship and he's getting it I know somebody you're sitting here thinking this way yeah amen they're they're worshiping Satan out there's a bunch of devil worshipers out there and their worshiping Satan and they are and he'll take it even but that was not the Fulfillment of his desire he said I want us I want to be in the house of God and be worshiped as God and through deception listen to church people are standing amen amen in pulpits even even this morning and there's people in the pews and they're praising and they're worshiping and they don't know what they're worshiping Hallelujah and they think they're worshiping God but they're worshiping Satan and sometimes they're very enthusiastic about it hallelujah amen and Satan is receiving their worship and it's fulfilling his desire I start thinking about it and I thought if they can get excited out there praising the devil and they can raise their hands and they can shout hallelujah and they can sing their songs and they can and it's fulfilling the desire that lays and say even if my God wants to be praised amen there ain't no devil hallelujah amen I want the devil to know this morning we ain't here to Worship You devil we are here to praise the turn the Living God hallelujah amen if Satan is receiving worship let God receive the worship of his bride Hallelujah is it Satan's ambition to be worshiped as God listen the Bible says Revelations 12 and there appeared another verse 3 and there appeared another Wonder in heaven Behold a great Dragon having seven heads and ten and the Lord and seven crowns upon his head and his tail now because remember it was his ambition he had this desire amen and his tale Brothers tail it's a Telly told amen it was by that tale that he told that he drew to himself is that right amen uh the third part of the stars of heaven and they cast them to the earth and the dragon amen stood before you know the scripture amen watch Jude as he picks it up and the sixth verse he said and the angels which kept not their first estate amen listen Satan preached the sermon in heaven and it was so powerful it was so powerful that that there are a third of the Angels were deceived the angels that kept not their first estate but left their own habitation as we reserved Amen in the Everlasting change into darkness under the Judgment of the great day amen II Corinthians 11 14 and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose ends shall be according to their works amen ain't that amazing that Satan amen has ministers plural Hallelujah Satan's got ministers amen that has transformed themselves into messengers of light and they're preaching his Doctrine amen I'm just going to say this because Satan this is a reality Satan amen is always copying God he looks at what God does and then he copies it and Satan is not all by himself he's got a Ministry he's got ministers that are standing in prayer but I tell you what if there's a false Ministry there's got to be a real one somewhere Hallelujah and just as sure as Saints got ministers standing in a bump in God has got a five-fold Ministry Hallelujah ministers that are preaching the pure word the unadulterated word what just started in heaven is that right started in heaven he began to preach his Doctrine and it deceived many but not all because the Bible says there was elect angels let me just make this clear you wasn't ever an angel you'll never be an angel but God had something in heaven to represent something he was going to have on Earth Hallelujah them Angels Amen in heaven amen when they heard Satan's lie amen amen they withstood that lie and they stood with Michael Hallelujah the elect angels in heaven amen stew and Michael and Cass Satan out Hallelujah and if God had angels in heaven I believe this morning he's got people on the Earth there's an electron of Jesus Christ Hallelujah them Angels represented you amen and Satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking to me may devour and the whole world is falling under his deception even accept them they had their names written on the last book of life before the foundation of the world Hallelujah you cannot be deceived you will not be deceived hallelujah amen you will not except Satan's lie do you believe it greatest about over fault brother Ben said The Great Battle of the star ever fall amen begin in heaven when Michael and his Angel angels fought against Lucifer and his angels and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth it fell on human beings the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself Satan come to destroy this that was his purpose was to destroy the battle begin amen here in the earth it began in us and it's been raging ever since amen The Listener is a battle that you're in this morning amen is a battle that started in heaven it's an old battle it's a battle of angels amen but the Battle of angels has now become human battles and it's raging right here this morning there's a battle going on right now in this building right now there's a war that's raging amen there's a battle that's raging in here I know I'm talking to I know I'm preaching the truth some of y'all fought to get here come on Friends some of you had to fight a battle he'll get here and some of you might be fighting about right now to stay remember I tell you what even fight the fight hallelujah amen and it's up to you even because Satan is right here and he's sitting on his on your shoulder right now many of you even he's right there and he's whispering in your ear and he's telling you he went too far you've done this it ain't for you well any any tactic every way he's talking to you amen but at the same time amen the word of God is coming forth and God is saying it's a promise it's a reality it belongs to you hallelujah amen receive it believe it and Satan's angels are here amen and there's all kind of spirits and all kind of demonic powers and you're dealing with anxiety amen and complexes and everything in the world that you can think of amen amen you're dealing that's Satan's Angels but the angels of God are also here hallelujah amen the prophet of God said every now and again you'll feel one of them bump into you even he said what was it an angel and another place he said they're here to energize your faith Hallelujah and the devil's saying you can't it'll never happen but God's saying you can't I've already made a way hallelujah amen the devil is trying to put a question and God is saying there ain't no question it's a Finnish work it's done [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah it's not a question if you're gonna make it you already made it Hallelujah what voice will you listen to they're made in the mind remember it's not Christian Science Mind Over Matter he says no it's not your thought s see but the word may flesh he said be revealed in human flesh by your thought becoming amen manifest amen but we'll work what he said before that he said when your thought becomes his thoughts it's not your mind over the matter it's God's word his mind over your mind Scott's word even over amen all uh every thought hallelujah amen was about as I bring a captive amen listen first or second Corinthians 10 amen verse 3 though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds amen casting down imaginations and every hot thing that exhausts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ there's your victory amen there's your Victory friends not your mind over the matter even God's word over your mind hallelujah amen bringing your thought every thought every thought captive to The Obedience of Christ Satan's Army brings diseases God's Army is commissioned to cast them out that's a very tactic God used amen amen Satan will use the army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and set up a better Kingdom than Michael had and God cast him out God's method is to cast out the evil cast down reason Castell Superstition cast down word Hallelujah cast down worry that's a hard one ain't it I'm with you I'm a warrior I always Crossing Bridges before I get to them you know and always

Beyond amen amen and lizard amen because I know amen the devil is telling you well you're not worthy and and you're not able and I want to tell you something they shock you he's right he's right within yourself you're not worthy I think what the prophet said he said I was nothing when he found me and I'm still nothing but I'm in his head and when you get to a place that you begin to realize it ain't me it's him hallelujah amen cause I tell you that devil will come and challenge you oh you got the third pull a part of the words and you showed me show me go cream me a squirrels go do this go do that show me hey Mama I want to tell you the anointing is supreme power under control Jesus was nobody's puppet and he did put no show on for nobody he didn't do it for pilate he didn't do it for Herod and he ain't doing it in this day it will not be a public show hallelujah amen and we are not here he meant to show the devil who we are or to prove to somebody the power that lays within us we're here to surrender our hearts surrender our will surrender our mind and when the Devil comes to you and say you can't do it say that's right and he says you're not worthy say Amen but Creator is he that is in me hallelujah amen and he is not looking at me he's looking at my sacrifice [Music] Hallelujah it's a deity in you cast him out cast him down God showed you how to treat what to do when he be when he comes with his Spirit of unbelief God gave you an example to follow cast him down cast him out cast him out of your mind I'll tell you what I was wrong with a lot of us we're listening to too many voices and you're listening to too much junk and the voice of the critic and the voice of this and the voice of that amen and all these voices that come in I'll tell you what you need to do you need to cast it out Hallelujah and you need to tell the devil amen I was built to believe one thing Hallelujah I was made to receive one thing and there's only one thing that I am obligated to hear Hallelujah and that's the Vindicated word hallelujah amen listen friends we get back to that voice amen you'll see a victory come in the church Satan desires a throne is that right that's that's his ambition Satan desires the throne that's why he hates you because what he desires belongs to you the problem amen listen friends amen Satan wants a spot that's already filled you remember there's a woman in the Bible comes she was asking Jesus let one of my sons on the right and one on the left and he said that is not mine to give I cannot give that to your sons even that was a mother's desire is a wonderful thing but amen that place was already spoken for that was a place of predestination Hallelujah and he said to the Overcomer well I grant to sit with me in my throne hallelujah amen and that's why Satan has wanted to get into the church because he sees it as his as his way to the throne and let me just say this way amen and from the Garden of Eden he's desired a throne and he got into Humanity through the fall amen and he got into Israel amen and he come amen and by the fall of the church amen he got into the church but this is where he stops hallelujah amen saying beat Adam to his bride amen and by the time Adam got there she was already even impregnated with the wrong seed but when he come to this bride hallelujah amen he talked too late Hallelujah I said he'd come too late because by the time he got to you even your womb was already sealed a seed had already been planted let me tell you some church you are the people you are the bride that will stop Satan in his tracks Hallelujah anyone in here we are in satanzine at the Pinnacle of his kingdom amen look he's in every government he's in all politics he's in religion he's exalted he's the God of this age but I

world but there's a little group a little minority a little flock Hallelujah that's on the Earth right now and he's tried everything every tactic even everything even the one he used on Eve the one he used on the early church every tactic Every Lie every deceit he's trying and he's trying to penetrate even the fortification of the word around this bride but he has failed Hallelujah he is a failure because there's a bride that is already sealed with a word of her hour [Applause] he will not take the Throne of my heart glory to God that place is already spoken for [Applause] God Reserve that spot for himself glory to God he got into the serpent and by that deceit amen got into Humanity yes he did that amen but brother that was a place that was a spot that God said it belongs to me and you can't touch it even it belongs to me and you can't have it it's the throne it's the heart of my people Hallelujah he's a God of this evil age but he ain't my God I wish somebody would join me this morning he's a God of this world he ain't my God he's a god of politics but he ain't my God Amen he's a god of religion but he ain't my God hallelujah amen he's amen yes sir he's a master deceit but he has no place in men [Music] Hallelujah Jesus stood there in John 14 and he said amen the prison this world shall come speaking of his death but he says he has no place in me [Music] he has no hook in my life Jesus was telling them because the next Mercy amen he said that the world may know that the love of the father is in me amen that I come to do his will I'll go to listen for his the devil did not take Jesus to Calvary he went in humility and submission to the will of the father Satan did not take his life he laid down and if he led down he'll raise it up again he says Satan has no place in me and they ought to be a bride and I ought to be able to say this morning even the prince of this world come but he has no place in me he has no part in me he has no hook in my life the days of sin are over I said their days of Sinner over I'm stripping you of your excuse and I'm happy to do it because you can't no longer say as a real Born Again Holy Ghost Field believer amen you can no longer say the devil made me do it the devil made me do it Satan made me do it and you got all kinds of excuses Amen to say all kind of things and live all kind of ways amen I'm stripping away from you this morning amen who's greater the power of God or the power of Satan what's greater the Holy Ghost than you or some Alpha outside influence even on some demonic power spirit I see the Holy Ghost the holy don't you be little my Holy Ghost amen he's able to save he's able to keep Hallelujah he can keep you in the eye of Temptation he's wanting the throne he knows it belongs to you it says

go back to the opening scripture and I'm going to bring it to a close but he made of himself of no reputation he took on the form of a servant it was made in the likeness of men and being found as a fashion as a man he humbled himself and become obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also has highly exalted him and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow Hallelujah of things in heaven and of things in Earth and of things under the Earth listen to me Church Jesus come down as a man and humble himself and he was rejected despised refused and Outcast light on battle humiliated but God hath highly exalted him and give him a name that every knee are you hearing me every knee the strong knee the Weak Knee the righteousness the unrighteous even everything shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord second seal of musicians come he died the cruelest death didn't have a place to lay his head
