to be in the house of the Lord on a Friday night and good to see everybody out and we certainly blessed that each of you could come and visitors and and U we're we're thankful tonight to know that God has has blessed us you know I've just sitting there thinking about the blessings of the Lord on the assembly and Upon Our Lives and you know um we're just in discussion today speaking about some things that come around and situations that happen but brother bradam said some things that I think are so powerful and uh just this quote here he said remember uh speaking of Joseph he said he was the son of prosperity and everything that he did prospered and whether it was in prison or whether it w whatever it was it come out right and hasn't he promised for his children that he'd make everything work together for our good whether it's sickness or prison house or death or Sorrows whatever it is that it would work out for our good that loved him and he promised it and it must be so it's got to be there aren't you glad tonight that he said that he would Prosper you amen and and that you are children of the prosperity of God tonight that he said all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose now if God be for us then who could be against us but yet in all things we are more than conquerors tonight amen amen with a with a word of the Lord coming tonight we've got our brother David mayor from France and his wonderful wife sister an is here somewhere amen here God bless you Sister Anne thank you for coming all the way across that pond to come and be a blessing brother David's got quite a schedule ahead of him and uh and he just took a a time some time out to come and visit with us we've been to brother David's uh Church several times and then he is the one one of the brothers that sponsors those Easter meetings there in Switzerland that we've been going to and so we we certainly uh are greatly honored that he would come and be a part of our services and bless us tonight and we're certainly looking forward to what the lord has laid on his heart and amen uh he David has been with us a couple times in the old building back about 2016 but this will be the first time that he's preached for us and so we just want to make him welcome tonight knowing amen that he's a servant of God and what God's put on his heart and when the Holy Spirit speak something you have need of just just don't let it go by now just reach out and amen it and say Lord that's for me and and he and he's promised amen that we would hear from Heaven tonight amen if you'd stand to your feet with us tonight let's let's bring Brother David amen and make him welcome here tonight and amen uh we certainly want to give him the time and Liberty uh before the Lord tonight brother Ben you got something maybe just want bring him up tonight holy spirit that Thou Art wellcome In This Place Holy Spirit Thou Art well in this [Music] place poent father of Mercy and gra oh Thou Art well in [Music] this Holy Spirit Thou Art wellcome in this [Music] this [Music] blent father of mercy and Grace Thou Art [Music] this Hallelujah is that your desire Thou Art welcome in this place not just in this place in this place that's why we have gathered here tonight because we want to welcome our lord Jesus and he says if there is a deep calling there's a deep to respond so it doesn't matter who's preaching it's better if he is here but he can talk to us and that makes all the difference you know the prophet tells us and I I thank God for his word cuz he says you never preached a sermon in your life Brothers we've never preached preached the sermon in our lives but it's been the Holy Spirit that's been preaching to us so I just want to surrender to God and let him have his way there are no big eyes small use the I am is the only one worthy of Our Praise amen so I greet you in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's certainly a great honor for me to be standing before the r of the Lord amen and and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart that you share brother Wayne with the Saints on the other side of the pond thank you brother Ben thank you and all of you he's a great blessing over there amen for the bride all over the world and certainly want to say thank you bring greetings on behalf of my church and the Saints back home and I'm sure glad my wife could come with me thank you brother Ray brother Wayne for the invitation amen and there's always something special when God's people gather together no matter where you go you know why because we've been together before we have been to Brother David I've never seen you before we have some spiritual Amnesia but by the preaching of the word word God is bringing back to us I was with you I was with you I was with you before the foundation of the world Amen and only God can do that amen because that's God's plan and God never makes mistakes amen so may God richly bless us and give us a wonderful me weekend amen I know it's Friday night so I don't want to keep you too long [Music] amen why are we here why are we here did anybody ask the question because I want to meet Jesus and God's word is as efficient tonight as it was the first time it was spoken I might talking to Believers tonight I'm not bringing a new doctrine I'm not bringing something you have never heard because you have powerful preachers here amen we look up to the generals I'm just a small pebble amongst great great Pebbles I say that with all my heart love you dearly so I'm not bringing anything new but the preaching of the word that's what gives us Faith that's the only thing the pure word of God that's what gives us perfect faith so we don't want to add we want to take away just preach it in all its truth and all its power and it's say if that's what the prophet says it's as efficient think of it when he said let there be and even today we enjoy the sun we enjoy the light but that's the power of God's word tonight so if you have a need he's still the same God amen thank you musicians if you continue playing I will just start singing amen if we can take the word of God so we truly love you amen the prophet says before we take the Bible he says what are we doing we are getting ready for the Rapture young and old we are getting ready for the Rapture I told Brother Ray this afternoon I said hey you're closer to 18 as you as you've ever been and the young people laugh you know I just turned 50 so they even my kids say you're getting older dad but I'm closer to 18 that I've ever been I'm getting ready for that young people meeting amen what a time it will be so he says we're getting ready for Rapture holding ourselves steady for a few minutes here tonight holding ourselves steady till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost that's my desire tonight till every fiber every molecule every atom is filled with the power of God is it possible that's God's word oh yes it is and that's God's desire amen amen he's calling his people together to himself in true Oneness with himself that's what is happening now there's an invisible Union going on the world doesn't know about it but the bride and the bridegroom knows all about it and it's real that's why I Rejoice many people it passes over their head but oh I can Rejoice amen because the invisible Union is real and we're getting ready to leave this place hallelujah amen amen amen amen if we can take the Bible Galatians 4 so I'm sorry if I have a little accent I'll try my best Galatians 4 start from verse one and say Amen when you're there now I say that the heir as long as he is a child deferreth nothing from a servant though he be the Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we where we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ Hallelujah isn't that wonderful if we look to the word the Lexicon of adoption I'm not well I can try to pronounce it's it's weia excuse my pronunciation but it means the nature and condition of a true disciple in Christ who by receiving the spirit of God into their souls becomes sons of God my I love it Hallelujah Romans 8 verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beared witness with our spirit that we are the children of God then verse 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us then who can be against us hallelujah can we say that together if God before me for us who can be against us hallelujah Ephesians 1 have two more scriptures Ephesians 1 verse 4 according as he had chosen Us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so it's God's pleasure and it's God's will who can say anything line up every demon of Hell who can say anything against God's will Hallelujah that alls make let feels so good it's Friday night yes but I'm here to get a charge from God and I feel good because I hear that is the will of God that is God's desire that he chose me he justified me he already glorified hallelujah amen amen oh in verse six to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved my one final verse John 16 verse 28 Short scripture but a powerful verse and that gets my amen I come from the father and I'm comeing into the world again I leave the world and go to the father may God add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads dear heavenly father lord it's such a great honor and a privilege to be standing on Holy Ground tonight father knowing that you said there with two or three are gathered in my name that you are amongst us father even before we arrived you are already here Lord God and you knew exactly who was going to be here father you know the needs of your people and Lord we have gathered here Lord knowing that you are still the I am so father we want to put everything as lay everything aside and put everything into your H hands Lord every need Lord you know them Father and may you speak to every heart may you take me out of the way father God speak through the vessel may you anoint our ears Lord God that we may hear what you want to say to us father and by the speaking the preaching of the word Lord God lord may we our faith grow stronger and stronger Lord God Lord because we know father your word will never fail so I pray father may we find Grace in your sight Lord God Lord in our praise in our worship Lord in the preaching father May everything be for your glory Lord we we commit ourselves into your hand I pray in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ amen and amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen for a title tonight amen I just want to take it out of Galatians I am a son an heir of God through Christ you know there's something about saying who you are because Satan bombards us day in Day Out night 24 24 77 36 30 365 sorry days a year but when God talks to us and when we take it by faith not by reasoning and when we speak the word Satan is powerless Satan is powerless amen when even when we feel weak tonight amen he says when the the weakest of the Saints goes down on his knees all hell trembles amen so even tonight you may feel weak but let me tell you he is still strong my Lord and Savior and just a touch can make you whole amen so tonight just going to take some time amen because you know when the bride knows her position then the Rapture will take place so there's something about knowing who we are not here here amen Einstein how many have heard of Einstein good I'm not going to preach on E equals MC squ that's for all the young people CU all we all forgot about that you know Einstein made a declaration he said I want to know God's thoughts the rest are details my I love that the rest is not important but what are God's thoughts concerning us my what are his thoughts what is his will what is his desire amen so brother brandham says we come out of Eternity stepped into a little time space here and Ste out of time back to Eternity amen so we are just here for a little lapse of time young people and Aller people you know when we young we are always Desiring something and all we so no matter how young how old we are we just come here for a little lapse of time even if I would be 100 years old I would say it's still a little lapse of time because give me the percentage of what is a little lapse of time 100 years compared to Eternity that's zero come out 000000 many zeros percent you following good hallelujah amen so we see in 1 John 1 John 3:2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him Fe for we shall see him as he is my what a privilege people we are to see him amen as he is amen because we received an open book The revealed word so we can see our true identity hallelujah amen amen amen a lot of Christians have problems today they don't know what their position is what's my identity amen we live in an age where there's an identity crisis I don't know if I'm a man I don't know if I'm a woman I don't know if I'm a dog I don't know if I'm a giraffe I a Son of God I come from God and I go back to God and Satan with all his nonsense tried to trap people in believing the nonsense yes there is an anointing going there but God sent us the eagle anointing to fly in the heavenlies to Fly Above All the nonsense people are afraid to say it's nonsense people are afraid to preach the truth people are afraid to say I am a Son of God Amen but God came and he opened a book for me to tell me who I am to tell me where I come from oh yes and Satan with all his demons cannot stop God's word to perform so I'm here and whoever wants to join with me come on to knock Satan out do we have some boxers tonight sisters that's for you too sisters hallelujah amen so my thoughts amen are not his thoughts my ways are not his ways so we want to listen to What God Says About Us amen so in Romans 3 he says let God be through and every man be a liar so no matter whoever Satan or whoever says we go to the word and see what he says about it that's why brother ofam says you should give everything the word test because nowadays A lot of people have opinions a lot of people want to say something about something that God said and God sent us a messenger vind ated by God himself and who do they think they are who do they think they are I'll make more sense to it no you're speaking nonsense that's what they do why did he say say what I say oh he meant this he meant that no God knows exactly what he said when he said I am a son amen that's what he means when he said I come from God I go back to God that's what he means hallelujah amen I am believer in What God Says in his word and he gave power to his church says the word and nowhere have I seen in the scripture in the word where God took it away but we live in an age where people by their tradition by their intellect triy to take God out of the church church that's exactly the spirit of anti christ because he wants to get the glory out of the church where God sent his power he sent his power he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I won't leave you comfortless I will send you the comforter and he will guide you in all truth amen and in my name they will cast out demons they will lay their hands upon their sick and they shall recover so don't tell me God took that away I'm sorry I'm feeling at home but listen to what he says we need man who's willing to stand on what God said to be the truth truth God bless you Brothers it's an honor to be on the battlefield with real man of God that stand for the truth that called black black and white white people love it gray and no white is white and black is black I don't have black hair do I I got a big amen there but Saints soon I'm going to have black hair well I what's Brown in this but but who's willing to stand for what God said to be the truth you know Peter when they were in the boat he didn't have a six-hour sermon Jesus came walking on the water they said there's a ghost what's going on but Peter said if it is thou the scripture says Peter answered and him said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water now Jesus didn't start well Peter you know remember when we were on the other side I told you this I told you that I told you this no he said come a short powerful word but it was sufficient for Peter to take God on his word now what about us can we take God at his word Peter just by believing one word come started walking on the word of God Amen and the water amen the laws of nature couldn't drown Peter because Peter was walking on the word come come and it was only the moment when he doubted when he saw the wave that he started drowning but listen even in that situation when we doubt or When We Fear it is still Jesus that is coming to taking our hand amen and he's still the same one for us tonight no matter how we feel only believe God's word sir you know the story about brother MOS he was carrying his Bible everywhere and the boss says mo why do you carry your Bible oh well I believe every word of it I believe it from civer to civer and even on the front and the back you know why because in the front it says holy Bible and on the inside it says Hey the boss says Hey Brother Moses you can't even read that's right boss but on the inside it says that heaven and earth pass away but that this word will never pass away so I prefer to stand upon the word of God than upon what everybody can say or anybody can say because heaven and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away why because he said I am the word I am the beginning and the end I am the all and all in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the girl oh Hallelujah so even if I can't read I can stand upon God's promises amen knowing without a Shadow of Doubt be like Peter stand upon the word and you see the phenomenal you see the miraculous take place in your life hallelujah amen amen so it's our it's up to us now Heaven and Earth will pass away amen 2 Corinthians says ver 10 casting down imagination Satan loves to bring things in our minds so we start imagining this brother doesn't like me the pastor he's probably speaking against me have you ever heard that brother Ray brother I thought it was only in our church you know Satan bombarded and and and becomes let's see what the word says and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God who do you think you are you have a bigger knowledge than God and all those that go against the word come on that's what Satan tried huh yeah I want a greater Kingdom I want have some I have a a greater wisdom and he was cast down and that's what he's trying to do now even now wants to pull you down but what does the word of God tells us amen casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's where the greatest battle is fought amen so we have to cast down all these strongholds amen all these complexes anxiety depression unbelief everything that will become a stronghold but we have to cast it down how well just live let me give you a little Bible story Joshua gave received the word from the angel right although he knew exactly how strong the strongholds were right you with me he knew exactly the prophet said how how much cement it took how wide it was amen and all this but God knows amen he knows exactly because he knows he is the almighty amen so he said just walk around amen seven Church ages and then in the seventh Church age Seven Seals will be opened and then when you hear when you receive the open book there is rejoicing there is shouting and these walls are coming down so what about us we have received the open book so we can't Rejoice no matter what it may be no matter what it may be Brother David I've been in many prayer lines so what the pastor prayed for me many times so what where's your faith at Keep On Believing amen amen David he saw Beyond Goliath he saw the victory he didn't look to the how big he was he saw the word of God and he already worshiped God for the victory in his life my my my my we shouldn't live under our god-given privileges amen he is worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of all I am still sick oh no he said it is finished amen hallelujah amen so let us cast down all reasoning amen you know when we read Ephesians according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so in the verse in verse four there's no mention about us doing anything I did this I did that you didn't do anything God did it from the beginning and he will bring it to the end he who started this work in me in you will accomplish it what 99.9% no to perfection brother brandham says when you pray and you speak to your mountain and even if the mountain doesn't move there's a little grain of sand that starts moving come on Church in my life amen you see amen a miracle standing here I'm not doing that to lift up brother R I'm just reminding you that God is still God Amen so he still preaches the word he still believes nothing can hold him down maybe a little gra a little piece of sand is falling but we will press on we will continue amen until we see a total Deliverance a total healing Hallelujah because when you believe what God says I am a son an air come on now that's right if anybody comes to you tonight and knocks at your door and say well you're an air to 25 million I want to keep it low you know I got you there thank you would you just say thank you close the door I'm asking you in all honesty how would you react coming here a little more you know thank you no no believe me now that ain't good brothers and sisters but now if I am a son that's what God says an air an air to everything that he has my my my so I can ask my healing I can ask my family I can ask my Deliverance I can ask whatever that is his and he said at the cross it is finished it is finished Satan take that come on church amen amen amen nothing we have done it's all what he has done so we don't need to inject anybody's ID in there it's God's Own ID about it oh think of it it's God's Own idea about it of what of his bride being blessed by every Redemptive blessing glory be to God Amen John 15 says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you you know in the natural I often give it and my wife doesn't like it but I chose her she chose me well she said yes I'm a happy man that there could be hundreds thousands it wasn't the case please I want to start doctrines here you know but one was chosen and that's what God he chose me W even brother brandham says there were a millions that are better than me but God by Grace choose me he chose me he loved me he justified me and already glorified me Hallelujah amen amen so this Bible it's not just a book that people people read it's not a book about history or a book about codes or systems or no it's the revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen amen so if we are in Christ and Christ is in us on then this is the revelation of who I am Hallelujah Glory the opening of the seals what is it revealing Jesus Christ amen now I'm a part of Jesus Christ so that reveals who I am and now my wife she has the same Authority on the check as I have that's why he says oh when you give your heart to the Lord and you be become a Christian God gives you a checkbook and it's my name is as valid as Jesus Christ because I'm his bride if my wife when I was in Uganda i i i Ed the same example and they really caught it because if my wife goes to the bank and says hey I want to cash this or or pay that or whatever under what Authority I miss meire now when you go ask anything in my name he says I will give it to you so under what name do we come the name of Jesus if you ask anything you ask it in the name of Jesus why because oh my name is Miss Jesus come on church it's about time the bride knows her position amen amen and if God listen I'm going ahead of myself now but that's okay brother M talks about Whack Him you've heard him you whack him and if if a little parasite Internet site opposite anything comes you whack him again and you whack him and you whack him I miss Jesus Christ it is written by his stripes I am already healed it is written ask and you shall receive come on Saints that's right hallelujah hallelujah amen so this Bible Prophet says has become a new book a new Bible now there's many translations of the Bible many many languages but you know what translation I prefer the open book Bible so there's no discussion anymore about King James or or or whatever version you may have it's the open book Bible this Bible has become a new book because every type these were types but I'm the manifestation of the type Hallelujah Ruth and bis Abraham and Sarah amen Esther come on Church there are types but we are the manifestation of the bride and the bridegroom and we are the living manifestation of God's word Glory Glory Glory amen God's thoughts are Eternal amen and God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior he is omnicient listen he has never had a new thought W think of it he has never had a new thought about you Hallelujah that oh I Rejoice about that because I keep saying you know I'm I'm I'm I'm good for nothing I'll never make it I really I'm a loser you know how Satan puts it maybe I'm the only one I'm being honest here tonight but now here God tells us I never had another thought Hallelujah come on Saints give a good nothing out to Satan that's for each and everyone amen amen thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real amen the David writes in the Psalm 139 for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee he's worthy of my praise amen for I am fearfully and wonderfully made brother Wayne We Are wonderfully made and here Satan tries to put complexes I want to be taller I want to be shorter I want to be wider I want to be older I want to be younger I want to have white hair I want to have black hair come on that's nonsense from Satan because the thoughts about us are wonderful hallelujah amen he and wonderfully made Marvel are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them woo hey I'm not a creature of time huh we're creatures of Eternity how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them and in the Amplified it says I will give verse 14 give thanks and praise to you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your Works in verse 15 he says when I was being formed in secret and intricately and skillfully formed formed as if embroidered with many colors that's why you know Satan attacks the five-fold ministry and you know what the prophet says there are God's fine needle work because we are being dressed the bride is being dressed with God's word we become the word the word becomes us amen and that's the the duty of the servants God's servants Amen to find needle work oh there's much opposition amen but if we stand on the Solid Rock Amen no demon of hell can get say anything against us because there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle Hallelujah glory be to God Amen embroided with many colors that makes me think of Joseph hallelujah amen the prophet says amen I lost my handkerchief here here we go got it back sorry says Moses Jeremiah John each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in their season okay let me bring it to your front door what's your name brother Aaron Benjamin Mah so now in their season but now you call your name those were God's thoughts for my season God chose us amen for this season what a glorious season because this is a season where Time and Eternity is blending together amen we are even bumping in the Holy Angels and oh in one one split moment I'm going to be changed in a twinkling of an eye amen but we need to believe it not understand it with our head but say this is for me listen to what he says amen and each one of these thoughts were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world now that gives an eternal quality to the elect amen that's right an eternal quality although Satan wants us to believe his nonsense mhm I'm continuing here amen Amen brother Ram says amen that he took a picture of us yes sir sir and he says the picture is the main thing you know Satan is a perverter he perverts everything yeah that God put already there you'll see when was I taken when was it taken that picture before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file in God's great photo album so I don't care what they would do with me they cannot destroy that he uses the word profile nowadays on the internet you have to have a profile what does your profile say very simple my profile says I come from God and I go back to God you see how Satan uses everything how many likes and unlikes do you have are you an influencer oh Satan he definitely is I don't need the thousands of likes I have already one like that's from my heavenly father that's said I chose you I elected you I loved you before the foundation of the world and here Satan brings such an anointing where people oh I need a thousand lights at a million lights and this and that and the other and they go into depression because oh somebody said your your your pants wasn't right or the color I don't care if my tide doesn't match my suits I want my experience to match God's word and that should be the case from all of us amen amen amen amen hallelujah so God put this picture in his photo album yes sir I take the often the the example I used that brother Tims the other day and the brother said how many remember the moment you bre read it your first breath anybody good there was one brother say see you after church brother so nobody remembers pictures were taken one year two years we were but Dad he's explaining son this is you you're David David Meyer you're my son and I believe although I've never seen I saw the picture I saw the picture of me and I believed what Dad said now what about our heavenly father that said I took a picture of you at your best what was the best when I was in his thoughts and attributes and that's what he has the profile of me so it doesn't matter if I get wrinkled if I get stoed down if I if I even fall because seven times just can fall but seven times he stands up amen so it doesn't matter what Satan tells you even tonight what matters is what my heavenly father tells me and you remind Satan that God has a profile amen where I was perfect amen that's what is going on that's why the book has been opened the seals have been revealed so we can have perfect faith in what God tells us hallelujah amen amen amen amen yes sir Hallelujah just to think amen we're not here by chance but we are here by God's choosing people say I would love to live when brother Brandon was here yeah I would have loved to be with Abraham yeah but we're living in a most glorious time think about it when will be on the other side when you have this big table I I have a chair there's my name written on it so I have no worries my name is on it and if you dare sit on it oh you get in trouble that's my my seat so they amen I love it preachers preach so there Abraham Joshua Caleb all of them you name them they will come tell us tell us how was it in the darkest age where all hell was on Earth but you have been given an open book to withstand everything that Satan will put against you because he said he will raise a standard so no matter what comes our way he raises a standard and he gave us the full revelation of himself including his brother so we can have perfect faith not in a nice story but in a reality because that's why the prophet says it's real many people have had knowledge but it has to go here in the soul amen and you all you you cannot come in the family you are born in the family you cannot just come to church and say my mom my dad and so on God doesn't have grandchildren right you must be born again there's no other way out amen amen amen so oh Hallelujah he he his hand formed you he made you the person you are he Compares you to no one else think of it where everybody I prefer you Ty I prefer you car that's Satan he wants you compare this one with the other one and and God tells us that his thoughts about me about us are perfect wonderfully made Hallelujah come on Saints he Compares you to no one else you are one of a kind my don't take that in the B sense huh he's one of a kind no you are one of a kind because you one in a million God chose you one in a million they were like I said said there are many better than me but nevertheless God chose me amen you lack nothing his grace can give you he has allowed you to be here at this time of History to fulfill his special purpose in this generation that's why Jeremiah 29 says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil all right to give you you that's right an expected end what's that end anybody knows I come from God I go back to God the good news is I want to remind Satan I know his end Satan likes to talk about your past you've done this that the other and the list is big but you just tonight remind Satan about his very near future you remind him that his place is under your feet come on Saints because it ain't your power ain't your strength but it his power greater is he that is in you than he that is against you if you can only believe amen it doesn't matter how big your muscles are but Faith fate speaks and Satan has to flee hallelujah amen amen amen that's why amen he says what is the book of redemption the book of redemption the title deed the abstract title deed that means it search all the way back to its beginning Hallelujah in Redemption means all legal possessions any lawyers here no nobody dares to okay all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my brother brandham claps his hands together once what it ought to do to the born again Christian come on Saints how many Born Again Christians are we here tonight amen so what it ought to do to us everything they lost everything they lost Hallelujah when Adam was sitting there oh I need some shade he didn't have to move himself he just said tree come on here and God restored us back to that Authority oh I I hear the critics you know brother DAV it one day we'll have it the prophet says you don't have to put it in the future we won't need it in millon now now because with the full restoration of the word come full restoration of the power the problem is that we I'm including myself don't want to take God at his word uhhuh does that mean we lack Faith No but what's our attitude even when God that's why yes God bless you brother I I love him very much he's a dear buddy but he's a real hero of the faith you know we can read in Hebrews 11 by faith Abel by faith Abraham by faith Joshua by Faith by Faith by faith you know the story let me add another book of Acts by faith read around you know why by faith you know what it stands for fear ain't in this house and only believe now what about us it's not only for brother wrong is your life so perfect but by faith Aaron by faith Benjamin by faith Caleb by faith you cast down reasoning and by faith you shall receive because fear ain't in this house there's only faith in what God says let's continue for I didn't even know when I started brother Wayne so give me a sign you didn't become Christian just by coincidence before you were born God ordained you to be a Christian from before the foundation of the world you know what predestination means amen predestination of anything it was preaw by God may I continue a little while so don't stumble at the word predestination amen God had thoughts and his word are his thoughts expressed so how thankful we can be that we have an open book that Christ himself came down to he open the seals thereof to show us our true identity amen I'm not Swiss I'm not Belgian I'm not American I'm not Canadian I'm not African I'm not Chinese come on now I don't have all these identities no I have one true identity I am a son an air of God through Christ Jesus that's why we can walk boldly in face of all demons knowing that God will never fail us Satan would love us to believe that the days of Miracles are passed Brother David we've heard that before it has to be more than hear about it it has to be a personal experience each and everyone young and old go ye all into the world to do what to testify that God is the same yesterday today and forever amen so all people will never be able to see it as the prophet saying not Brother David all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts so that's why people love to fuss and even people want to say you're in it you're not in it nobody knows but God himself and he says I will not lose anyl now what's the to how do you know amen when you believe every word of God you don't start with your own interpretation you don't start with your own Doctrine you just believe the word the pure non-adulterated word of God that's why the bride she will be a virgin word prde she's part of him hallelujah amen amen amen so election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny amen Listen Now by Fall knowledge he forsaw us that that's the power of God if Einstein could say you know I want to know God's thoughts the rest are all not of of non importance and now he Lord by for knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a Sav savior self-existent he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it thank you Jesus and then by doing so he said to save that the only way I can do it will it will be to come myself be made flesh and take the sin of man upon me and to die for him that I may be the one that's worshiped listen to that where Satan the Antichrist Spirit today wants to take all the glory out of the church where Satan wants to have dead churches but Ray brother Wayne I love the church Al alive and ain't afraid to worship you know people say my nature okay sorry your nature if you say I'm a son an air your jeans go way back where were thou before I laid the foundation of the world I was doing what I was rejoicing I was worshiping I was giving Glory the prophet says I was having a good time with Jesus when I saw the Plan of Redemption come on Saints maybe we have spiritual Amnesia but the time has come the word is being given that w i remember I was praising God God thank you thank you I'm saved I'm redeemed I am it Hallelujah I'm not ashamed of the Gospel that goes for all nationalities Glory so in very plain language I love the plain language is that okay I know you you know it the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternity no not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forward it became expressed and took its place in the body does the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride think of it what do you think Satan can do against that yeah preach with me brothers and sisters when the Lord said let there be light even up to today Satan cannot hold the sun stop the Sun from rising up in the morning so now instead of when you rise up and oh I have to go to work I have to go to school it's going to be horrible I have an exam coming and yeah we're all yeah we have our human part when you see that Sunrise just remind Satan Satan you couldn't stop God's word and you can't stop it now I am a son I am an heir of God through Christ so Satan you take all your nonsense get me behind me I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and you whack him and you whack him again come on are you in the boxing business oh yes I am I'm in The Killing business killing every demon everything every stronghold that goes against the word of God that's what we have been ordained for God called us to destroy Satan's kingdom I'm sick and tired of all these demons trying to withhold God's people cuz the moment you hear the Jubilee trumpet what's the Jubilee trumpet the opening of the word that's right that's why the bride's Revival is a reality that's right it's not an intellectual reality many people will try to explain you no don't give me the explanation let God manifest reveal himself and that will make all the difference amen amen amen that I might be the one worshiped he's the only one that is worthy worthy of all our praise amen so we did not become seed by repaper we were seed and therefore were born for the only elect can be reor and the and the the others there's nothing that can be reborn can be quickened by the quickening power and so were you sons of God and daughters AG go before there even was a moon a star or a molecule isn't that something for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before my think of it Saints you can have five years of age or 100 but I was before that was you before and I'm going back to that amen as sure as Eugene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an ex expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world Listen Now the definition of a gene probably have some doctors or nurses a heredity units controlling a particular character you see heredity means we have an inheritance a Heritage okay a particular character a Christlike character this genetic element corresponds to a segment of DNA or RNA located at a specific location called Locust hey I searched it up it's not my intellect h a specific location on a chromosome and each region of the DNA that produces a functional RNA molecule is a gene the nucleus of the cell is the library which contains all the hereditary Heritage of the individual my the chromosome is a book of this library and the onepage gene of the book my name was written in the book in the Lamb's Book of of life before the foundation of the world I had a page with my name on it amen and that's my Gene that comes from God that God placed in me in you before the foundation of the world Satan you lost than of it people say the prophet had no degree talk badly now what about me then in my accent the prophet says somebody has to leave you something God before the foundation of the world he left you something that's right a name written on the book when the lamb was would be slain and you would recognize it glory be to God what a privilege people we are that's why he came back in this final generation put one feet on the see one on the land amen and he opened the book but now who did he open the book for for his bride and what did he say in Revelation 108 go take the book take the book that is open you eat it so you become it your Amnesia will be gone you will know that I come from God and I go back to God you will know that greater is he that is in you than he that is against you oh isn't he wonderful amen amen amen amen I'm glad my name is on it says a prophet amen that my name is written in heaven on the Lamb's Book of Life and that's the who is who oh my my my my hey is it still okay I know it's fr hey we have a whole weekend and say I have the jet Lake you don't but when the anointing is there I don't care amen because under the anointing of God Anything Can Happen amen they were gathered in the upper room oh with one motive one objective Let the Fire Fall they receive one promise only one promise but what about us we have a book full of promises and every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line come on Saints in moments like these they stood upon the word with one promise right and a mighty rushing wind came down amen and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost amen brothers and sisters amen they were so anointed they were walking like drunk and now people don't like to be drunk I'm talking about the wine of stimulation uhhuh but that's what it does Brother David no no the somebody called me a bramus the other day yeah because I used the quote BR brandham when he was talking about the upper room they were bouncing jumping out of the windows and the door the Bible doesn't say that that was his human part now let me tell you was that a human part when he went in the back part of his mind don't give me that nonsense that's Satan trying to influence you amen so you want to stay people think they're free and they're chained chained but I heard the Jubilee trumpet sound I received the open book I know I'm free I know I'm redeemed I know I'm saved I am his and he is mine there's something that Satan hates that's the Oneness oh yes that's why he says when the pride would know her position the Rapture will take place believe me oh when you know when you leave this place and when Satan comes brother brandham talks about I don't know if it's 10,000 volts or 100,000 but when he comes near to you because you're so charged you're so the Dynamics on the mechanics people think it's just an emotion uhuh oh no we have the mechanics and he never took the Dynamics away he says I will send the Dynamics upon the mechanics and that oh yes that will Rapture us people think with their intellectual knowledge will be raptured I'm sorry to say your mechanics won't do it maybe you don't love me for that but it's still the truth hory and they sung a new song thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred every tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth you know as priests we give a sacrifice of praise he even says when you don't feel like doing that's right m but when you hear when you hear from your theophany when you hear where are you coming from amen when you hear these divinely mystery truths now revealed you can but Rejoice because Satan is out of the picture Satan has nothing to say he's but a bluff he's but a bluff in your life but kicking him out give him the 1000,000 volts hallelujah amen listen few more moments what was it 7:30 help me out okay the Angels the cherubim the 4 and2 Elders the Beast everything uncrowned themselves fell down before the throne and said worthy are thou and here people in the message with all due respect I love you whoever is streaming I love you but are afraid to worship God to thank God worthy are thou to take the book John says and we can read it in Revelation if nobody can take the book everything is lost that's right we are lost but let's continue and see what it does and he says worthy are thou John said everything in Heaven Come on think of it when I take my plane on Monday I want to hear you shout because I'm going to be in heaven everything in Heaven and Earth heard me hollering people told me Brother David you screamed too loud I have hey I didn't scream too loud I rather lose my voice to give glory to God because the the Bible tells us when the woman came to the well when she was talking about worship he says the Lord is seeking those that worship Him in spirit and in truth the truth is being preached the pure word and it's up to us oh I'm not afraid to holler because worthy are thou I'm not worthy no I'm not but you are worthy you alone is worthy of all my praise and if praise which is a type of Joshua if praise can destroy the walls the biggest wall there ever was maybe you should start worshipping in spirit and in truth so you destroy all the strongholds that want to keep you bound because the desire of God is to seek God's people free free indeed he who the Son of God sets free is free indeed glory be to God Amen amen amen and Earth heard me hollering amen screaming Hallelujah and praises to God their names was in the book to be revealed and the lamb had revealed it think of it you want to talk about a happy time people take that it's in the bridge people they yeah you know that's for brother Brandon you know when he he received the thir pool the opening of the word no no no no it's not for brother brandom only talk about a happy time when the seals broke John which is a type of the Bride must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's John Hallelujah Hallelujah and when you go to the angel who holds the open book and when you take the little book and when you start eating the little book oh you go beyond the curtain of time and you see your true identity there's David [Music] Hallelujah don't think I'm beside myself I am rejoicing because I've seen my name in the book glory be to God and you know the good news brother brandham says no one say with me if you believe it no one can he raise my name Glory that's why I say thou alone are worthy [Music] Hallelujah and people don't like the foolishness of preaching I'm going to skip that maybe for another time oh but hey this is nothing but God's word being manifested he says it in another in another quote he said I've seen all of you over there I ask your name for the Three Brothers here I could ask each and everyone's name but when I I read what God says you think the prophet just said that to be kind I'm asking you the question some don't want to believe but I believe it with all my heart amen he saw me Predator David how can you say believe what you want to believe I believe what God tells me he saw me there yes sir come on Saints God's want us to see free so when the seals were open it entire it it opened the entire Bible amen so when we eat the book we become the book and in Jeremiah 15 it says thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart come on Saints what's the favorite sport here baseball basketball football American football ah we play rugby brother we don't need all the protection we go for it that's how we go come on Satan come on in Jesus name I have the victory so in sports brother Brenham teaches us you have to get into the spirit so they were they hey not going to ask you to raise hands they go go to sports games or play even and church youth meetings a volleyball game baseball basketball they get in the spirit of it often we say even amongst preachers when we pray when we play a game you know and oh there's a true nature coming out now because we want to win now what about God telling us I've chosen when he says we get in the spirit of it when you hear the word of God when you receive it not here when you receive it in your soul something is saying glory be to God you are worthy you alone are worthy because you said I'm a son you made me an air of all things I didn't do a thing he did it all for me and then Thy Word was unto me joy and rejoicing of Mine Heart for I am called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts Hallelujah when the seals were broken brother brandham tells us I'm not going to call you Church anymore I'm going to call you miss Jesus Christ well miss Jesus Christ this is the time where we can Rejoice where we can give King Langs worship through worship because every word that comes from God will never fail will never pass away no matter how many demons Hallelujah my my my and tonight to the word is bringing you the good news that from before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and all the Devils out of hell can't erase you out of there isn't that something thank you Jesus you want to know the power of the blood the power of the blood writes on my big files forgiven hallu he wrote my name David and there's nothing that can erase it Satan can try with all his schemes but there's so much Power in the Blood that can make the viol sinner clean that's the power of the blood the only one that's what God's plan was to be one his at had it to be expressed and now we're uniting again and he said we read it unless I go he put a price he put such a high price think of all those that think that you're not worthy he put such a high price that he was the only one capable able to do it that's why John says Thou alone are worthy and don't never let take Satan the glory out of the church the Church of the Living God cuz everywhere Jesus is there is noise so try it if John as a type of the Bride heard everything in heaven everything on Earth and everything under the Earth heard me John me David worship when I've seen my name in when he reveals himself to me he says I am a son I am an a few more minutes trying to wind up here now you never chose him he brought you into Christ and you are secure with Jesus Christ and just as perfect as Christ was before God there goes all my chains that Satan wants to put you know Satan wants to put concrete on the seed and more concrete but let me tell you something the power of the seed Gene of God will go through every concrete everything that Satan puts upon when this light of the s o n shines there's a an attraction there's a power that draws come up here come up here and one fine day one glad morning when everything will be over I will fly away glory be to God oh thank you Jesus amen amen amen amen just as perfect as Christ was before God for you're not standing with your own you're standing in him with one thing one thing I believe God I believe God and how many can say tonight for whatever need you may have I believe God you're the same yesterday today and forever you are still the Healer you are still the Savior you are still the deliverer but God wants to see people that act upon the word word that take call that his word you know what it takes courage sometimes to stand up because I know Satan fights so hard to play with your mind what will Mom think what will Dad think what will the pastor think what will this one and that one and this one and that one when you hear God's voice answer I believe God I believe God and then he says why did I fear look at the joy that I missed because this joy that I have the world didn't give it to me the holy ghost that I have the world didn't give it to me and the good news is the world can take it away come on Saint this joy that I'm talking about is something real it's something that is lasting Everlasting and Satan can't take it away no matter what he puts on your way look to brother onon amen day after day his body is aching but he stands up oh yes he goes through hard times but there's something stronger in him I believe in God I believe he's my healer I believe God Hallelujah glory be to God amen amen amen to redeems is to buy back to restore to its original owner that's why he says I will restore and to restore means to return to the former owner to bring back to my former estate of condition what is my former state of condition where were thou before I laid the foundation of Satan you can't get me no more you've tried long enough but tonight I hear the voice of God telling me I am a son I am a daughter I am an heir of God through Christ Jesus look to all the joy that we've missed coming to service to church not I'm going to receive from God I'm going to get something from God if there's one it's going to be me whether it's brother Wayne Brother Ray whether it's brother Ron whe brother whoever if there's one it's going to be me always that that determined to receive from God young people old people whoever brother sister do we come in God's house knowing that he is still the same for us all the joy we missed Prophet says do you know that there are some things that we have to do that God cannot do until we do it he furnishes the energy but we have to do the job what job take God at his word I believe God when you hear the word I answer I put myself in action here I am and Mary heard the word she didn't say well that technically it's not possible science can prove that it's not possible what did she say Let It Be according to Thy word and she went testify think of it she went testify that she was going to have a baby without knowing a man and you know for people that were nonbelievers that was oh we going to Stone you but she didn't look at what the law could say she didn't look to what the people could say she listened to what God Said and what God says oh that produced a Revival in her life Hallelujah and when she went to Elizabeth when she said his name will be Jesus he leaped for joy lifee the first time Jesus was pronounced It produced life we're going to ask oh brother John you know he's the first witness of the power of the name of Jesus now who wants to be next because in the name of Jesus we cast down every Dem oh yes in the name of Jesus we have the victory but we need PE people like the prophet says we have he furnishes the energy but we've got to do the job who's willing to stand and do God's job God's work on Earth he says we are his hands we are his eyes we are his mouth so who's willing to say Let Let It Be according to your your word musicians you can come Why Don't We Stand redeem is not to create something new it is to bring back that which has already been that's why this word is so precious to me because it reminds me my spiritual Amnesia when I hear it that's God speaking it takes all doubt away that's why he says faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God maybe if you can play softly I'm no longer a slave to fear you know that song I am a Son of God he put on name in the book as redeemed so what are you scared about let me ask you that question what are you scared about even tonight what is your need it's Friday night we want to wait until Saturday we want to need no God is here he said there where two or three are gathered in my name he told us tonight you're my son you're an air you're my daughter I know Satan is fighting but fight him back and determine this is my moment Micah the prophet where de brandom talks about a woman he says alcoholics you you see what God can do cancer cases see what God can do short legs cripples see what God can do he is God he is God and he's right on time and he talks about a man he says now we find that this man he he's gotten wrong company and sinners you hear the people shouting you have seen that woman run down through there starting so that woman was in the building running there starting with that great big tumor but so full of Glory she couldn't even say nothing she started speaking in tongues why she was so filled up with the power of God that took that tumor out of [Music] her think of it a woman and took God at his word so full of the glory she couldn't even speak her mother tongue because she wanted to give glory to God the power of worship made that Tor fall down he's still the same God Brother David I don't have cancer you have something else you need to be delivered from but when you can praise God at the level of the miracle You're Expecting the tumor the depression anxiety every evil spirit CU there where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Satan cannot stand in the presence of the Lord and even if you're a dried up stick sorry to call you that like that but that's the prophet's language a dried stick into shikina Glory produced fruit overnight as I am standing in the shikina glory Lord Make Me
