TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] When I meet Jesus [singing and music] and I see my [singing] savior's face, [music] I will step into [singing] his glory forever [music] changed In my broken pieces, [music and singing] they will no longer [singing] remain. [music] All the hurt that I've been feeling will go [singing] away [music] from nothing to something. Who I am and who I wasn't. [singing] I can finally [music] be who he made me [singing] to be when I meet Jesus. [music] All my wories and [music] my fears will fade away [singing] when he calls my name. When I [singing] meet Jesus, [music] I'll be there and her understand [singing] when he tells [music] me, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. You are home perfect. [singing] When I [music] meet Jesus, [music] when I get to heaven, [music] and I [singing] see the streets so cold, more beautiful [singing and music] than stories ever told. The glow of your presence will [singing] illuminate the sky. What a powerful [singing and music] and wonderful son. When I need [music and singing] Jesus, all my wories and my fears will [music] fade away. When he calls [singing] my name, when I meet Jesus, [music and singing] I'll be there and hold to stay. And he tells me he [music] well [singing] done my good and faithful servant. You [music and singing] are loved. You are worth it. When I [music] meet [singing] Jesus. Oh, nothing [singing] could ever compare to [music] the moment I'm there. And I see my savior's [singing and music] face. [music] And he calls me by my name. When I meet Jesus, [laughter] all my wories and my fears will fade away. [singing] When he calls my name, when I [music] meet Jesus, [singing] I'll be holding that to stay when he tells me. [singing] [music] Well done, my good and faithful servant. You [singing] are loved. You are worthy. Ooh, you are home. You are perfect. When I meet Jesus. [music] When I meet [singing] Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music]
