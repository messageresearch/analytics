========================================

When I meet Jesus and I see my savior's face, I will step into his glory forever changed In my broken pieces, they will no longer remain. All the hurt that I've been feeling will go away from nothing to something. Who I am and who I wasn't. I can finally be who he made me to be when I meet Jesus. All my wories and my fears will fade away when he calls my name. When I meet Jesus, I'll be there and her understand when he tells me, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. You are home perfect. When I meet Jesus, when I get to heaven, and I see the streets so cold, more beautiful than stories ever told. The glow of your presence will illuminate the sky. What a powerful and wonderful son. When I need Jesus, all my wories and my fears will fade away. When he calls my name, when I meet Jesus, I'll be there and hold to stay. And he tells me he well done my good and faithful servant. You are loved. You are worth it. When I meet Jesus. Oh, nothing could ever compare to the moment I'm there. And I see my savior's face. And he calls me by my name. When I meet Jesus, all my wories and my fears will fade away. When he calls my name, when I meet Jesus, I'll be holding that to stay when he tells me. Well done, my good and faithful servant. You are loved. You are worthy. Ooh, you are home. You are perfect. When I meet Jesus. When I meet Jesus.
