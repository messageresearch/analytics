we ask you would bless this meeting now father we're asking you so if there be one good thing done this evening Lord we give you all the glory and the honor and the praise we thank you father in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you tonight amen if you have your Bibles with like to turn to the Book of Daniel we'd want to look in Daniel chap 11 um the 32nd verse amen I took a little pause uh the other Sunday from a from a bit of a of a series we've been preaching on I don't usually do that much but when the Lord just directs you to do something then you just follow that direction and what's amazing is is usually he has an intention in it and you'll do it and then you'll find out that that will tie directly back and God will use it for his glory amen amen in Daniel 11:32 I want to read here tonight and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that do but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen God bless you as you can be seated tonight I want to take that for a reading tonight I want to speak to you again off of this subject of the exploits of Faith um I am I'm working on something here that I see in the scripture and uh sometimes it takes me a little bit to get there uh but uh we we probably could take about a three-hour service Brother Louie and just pile it all in or we can take a few at a time and and and get to it amen in a series and amen so we're we're just looking into a little bit of this and uh if we look into the scripture here in Daniel 11:32 amen uh I want to look over here in the Feast of the trumpets uh a scripture brother brandham will use that scripture in a way that just really stands out to me personally let me read this paragraph 113 and brother Bram says and how will the Messiah the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word amen to know what he is amen Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish and the unwise wouldn't know now he's tying together Daniel 12 and Daniel 11 he's tying those scriptures together he said they shall know their God and he speaking a direction like a prophecy they shall know their God now how he shall appear in the last days he says is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband or know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen so the bride would know her mate the revealed word so then the message of the hour is not just uh something to read and set aside but rather it is the mate to the church it's it's what we've been married to that's what our womb is open to but if you can uh read Daniel 11 let's read it and listen to that latter part but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits and and listen to how brother brandham says it and the bride will know her mate the revealed word when Daniel wrote it he said the people shall know their God when brother brandham used the same scripture he speaks it and says the bride will know her mate so the people becomes the bride and God Becomes Her mate you see the difference in the personalization if you go back there in the Bible in the book of Hosea and it says for the people who were not a people should be called the people of God Amen that that's a very direct scripture and Hosea doesn't say just a people he said but they shall be called the children of God and brother bam tells us then that you know if he's speaking of Israel he's speaking of servants but when he speaks of Gentile he speaks of sons so then Hosea is speaking of people in general of course he's talking about Abraham's seed but then when Paul picks up the same scripture in the Book of Romans in the ninth chapter Paul begins to quote Hosea and then he comes back and says them people not Jew only but also Gentile and then over in the book of Peter when Peter preaches about the Royal priesthoods you know uh I think it's John in Revelations 1 he'll say you're Kings and Priests but when Peter spoke of you he just shortened it and called it royal priesthood so it's a king priest and then he says a chosen generation remember but the very next verse Peter will say a people who were not a people but are now the children of of God so Peter and Paul connect the book of Hosea to the Gentile church right but then we find out that brother brandham takes it a step further and then he goes in beyond the curtain of time and sees these people coming to and he says something said the prophets are gathered with their people he said are these all Broms he said no these are your converts so these people now those people then become the Bride of Jesus Christ so the people in Daniel that was just called called a people amen but in the latter days they will be called the followers of a message they will be the Bride of Jesus Christ in Revelations 18 John connects it when he said them people heard a voice and it said come out of her my people so you see that the people he's describing is the bride and that's why brother bandam just cuts it and said the bride will know her mate so the people becomes more clear as a people as an identification of a church so if God's identifying that side then he makes a Clarity of the people that shall know their God so if it's just God somewhere uh somehow then it's a bit unknown yet but when it becomes the revealed word then the prophet is narrowing it down to identify to the church that you are the people and this revealed word is God so it's showing our connection because we being the bride and him being the bridegroom he said he's the word and we're the hear of the word so there's an actual Union that's going on between us and this word in the last days so what you're seeing then is this here's a prophet then he's actually depicting a certain area of scripture and this is something that uh that that I got into in this little thought uh you remember one of the first times I spoke on this specific scripture we got into that they become strong and and uh you forgive me but I just got to explain how I got where I'm going uh uh but but they become strong and and when you think think about they become strong remember I picked a man out of scripture and said David said the they that have the strength are blessed and they move from strength to strength the Victorious power and then we took the example of that as being a man named Caleb and how Caleb was a man in the scripture amen that was 85 years old but was demanding that he receive a mountain in the land of Hebron remember that amen now if you if you study Caleb a little bit deeper which I want to talk about Caleb for just a few minutes tonight but Caleb if you studied a little bit deeper said he was a kenite he said but but if you if you look beh in the back parts of Caleb's story is Caleb actually wasn't a Jew by birth he was in a Jew by adoption he had been brought into to the tribe of Judah and received his promise of a land of inheritance but he only received it by promise from Moses so everybody else in the tribe of Judah would have been receiving because they had been born in the tribe of Judah but Caleb on the other hand was receiving benefits not because of him being born an Israelite but his benefits was because that he had received an Israelite by faith so his his his his position or his portion in the land was only there by promise it was because that he had a different kind of spirit now now when you see things written in the scripture I I'm I'm that I'm the person that I got to stop and think a minute about it because if if you see something so dramatic in scripture of how that a man a gentile like Caleb could get included into the promises of God into that Promised Land then there's got to be something he is typing or God wouldn't do something so drastic in scripture to make it stick out because it looks like it's a controversy but it's not a controversy it's actually a revelation laying there that under that Revelation it details the idea that God for ordained a generation in the last days who would be a gentile people and those Gentiles would come into the land of promise and they wouldn't come because they were born Jews but they would become under Abraham's seed because of their new birth and that new birth only comes by faith is that right then we are the faith Seed of Abraham now I found it interesting that Moses when he got ready to make a promise to the children of Israel that he picked out the land of Judah and he detailed Judah as being belonging to the land of Hebron he and and and you remember that's exactly where when they went out to spy the land they they picked up 12 tribes they came to Kadesh barnia and they had heard about this land and they're going to go over so God sends 12 Spies and he picks out every Spy but there was a spy that was connected to tribes and one of the tribes the tribe of Judah specifically Caleb was representing that tribe and he was the he was the man who was representing the entire tribe of Judah Now isn't it odd that a gentile would be the representation of that tribe and would actually get to spy out the land and it would be the land of Hebron amen I I think it's pretty powerful amen that God was putting that much responsibility on a man and making him stick out amen and have all the 12 Spies amen he comes back from the tribe of Judah and he he he then has told about Hebron now there was a couple things that was told is that there would be a good land over there and it would be a land with milk and honey and then they were also to look into the they were also to look in the inhabitants of the land and they were to see the dwellings whether it be tents or strongholds or what they were to do so these 12 Spies were to spy out the land and come back with a report concerning milk and honey good land and whether it was the right kind of dwelling strongholds or tents and what was the people of the land were they easy to take you know so they had these things when they went and look but the scripture says when they returned amen they didn't only bring back reports of milk and honey remember they they brought back the the cluster of grapes that was so big they had to put it on a staff to carry it back when they got back in the land and the scripture tells us that they begin to give the report and all the spies said it's a good land and all the spies said that it was a land flowing with milk and honey so those those two portions were exactly like God said but then the other spies the Bible said gave an evil report now I don't know about you all but whenever the Bible calls something evil I want to ask myself what did God call an evil report have you ever read what the report was amen they just simply said that we are not able to take the land because it is inhabited by Giants and we are grasshoppers in their sights you know to think that that was what was considered evil before God amen that people would regard the size of the Giants rather am amen rather than the promise of God in other words God thought it evil that they would compare themselves to the Giants rather than comparing their God to Giants amen I think it's amazing because the Bible said amen that they they they went forth with all these reports and people began to get angry and then Joshua and Caleb they be they begin this report and I I I think it's powerful because Amen brother Bram said Caleb stealing the people amen you know what it meant was they were going every which way with every idea concerning the land but Caleb was to steal the people and when he stealed the people he began to say to them that these Giants are bread to us amen I got to thinking about it amen they had they had milk and they had honey they had grapes and now they got bread amen these were not Giants unto Caleb this was bread for his eating he had a he had a he had a he had a battle thirst he he had a hunger for battle and to him this was the bread for a thirst to take a land he this man was not an ordinary man he was hungry amen the Bible calls his name Caleb I don't know if you ever looked it up but in the Hebrew his his name actually meant dog how many knows that amen I'm telling you the truth it means dog his name means dog now if you go into the New Testament when Jesus spoke unto the Gentile the sanan woman remember what he said to her when she was looking after healing and he said unto her that you cannot receive healing because you're a gentile he said this is meat for the children's table and she said but Lord even the dogs get the crumbs that fall from the master's table even the dogs amen amen and she was a gentile and here she had a forefather in the tribe of Judah amen that had a a thirst if you look up the name just in the Hebrew look up the name Caleb and it says a dog one place it calls it a ravaging dog or an aggressive dog and I thought now that explains the nature of Caleb amen he was looking at the Giants that were causing people to back up from grapes and to back up from milk and honey to back up to they was at KES Baria they just come out of Egypt they had had lived in a Wilderness land and they were looking at possessions they were looking at homesteading they were looking at building houses and having a place for their children but but they were more scared of the Giants than they were remaining in that in that place that they were but oh Caleb amen he he had a thirst and a hunger for the battle and he said no what these Giants are is they are bread for our eating amen that's only bread for us amen I want you to know tonight amen that the Giants that exist in the lands of Promise amen those Giants are only bread for the children of God that is ready to go into the promise now I don't I don't have a lot of time to preach about the tonight but I do want you to know you're never going to go into a Promised Land without a giant laying in that land amen if you're going to go into any land there's somebody been there before you that was not ordained to live in that land and they have now become a GI of that land can I can I can I tell it to you straight there is people who has claimed amen the power of the spoken word and they have used it in the wrong way and now when a man preaches on the promise of the spoken word the Church of the Living God somebody knows somebody amen that used it the wrong way now that is a giant unto the promise and people say we are not able to do that brother Wayne I know so and so said this and didn't happen this over here happened and that didn't take place and it become a giant unto you amen but there is still remaining Amen in the Church of the Living God our type as Caleb who said we are more than able to take this land and I'm not going to look at your Giants I'm I'm not going to hear the reasoning of the people of why the promise is no good amen but I believe this is a generation it ought to say that we are more than able to take the land that God has made concerning the Church of the Living God I I I'm one that believes amen these Giants are only bread for the church amen amen I tell you sometimes you get a little hungry for the battle amen if you if you don't believe it go ahead and come on Amen let's just take the word and draw the battle mindes amen because somebody is going to believe this message in this last day there's somebody ordained to stand on the ground of the spoken word I don't know about y'all but it might as well be me amen somebody is going to speak the word of God and it's going to create right in front of him somebody's going to be preaching when the arms are added back to the body or eyes come back in their head amen but anybody that ever sees that is only going to see it because they're preaching it as the truth you'll never receive something that you can't preach or you cannot believe if you can't believe it you'll never get it people say well I I I tell you they talk about that Holy Ghost but I never got it there's another giant isn't it but I never got it amen amen you know what amen you got to believe it before you can get it you got to believe in it before you can get it because the Holy Ghost is for believers that's who it's for but oh I know there's Giants out in that land people shouting and hollering and screaming and running he say well I don't want to be like fat well I'll tell you what amen amen I don't care what I'm like as long as I get that Holy Ghost that's the truth I don't care I don't care what it is long as I get that Holy Ghost you said brother Wayne you mean you do anything do you know I'm already spoken of in scripture how many knows that Amen in the Book of Romans Paul says amen that before they were ever born he said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated brother bam said that represented showing you amen that before the end time groups come on the scene that God is already said I'll love one and hate the other who's he going to love the Jacob and what was Jacob he was a man desperate to do anything for the Holy Ghost because he knew the blessing of God laid in the Holy Ghost and the Church of the Living God every blessing that we're going to receive as an inheritance will be because of that Holy Ghost now y'all know what I'm talking about amen we could call it a giant or we could just switch switch gears and call it a scarecrow either way same thing amen it's just a scarecrow that's all it is old big scarecrows you never seen it amen it's same thing with doctrines you know amen there there's there's old scarecrows built around them any kind of Doctrine you want to touch with a message somebody's taught it wrong somebody's went out in eror with it and then when you mention it amen that's a giant that's in the land well I tell you what amen I don't know about y'all but we're able to possess everything this Prophet said we are more than able to receive it and possess it and we will not let a false teacher stand in the way of us possessing the truth concerning the word of God in our age amen I don't know about y'all but I'm not willing to let no scarecrow keep me out of the greatest parts of the message of the hour amen it's our portion amen amen it's our portion my you you see what was happening is Caleb Caleb according to scripture now the Bible said when Moses returned when they saw the children return and and and and Caleb's Spirit was the kind of spirit he had representing the spirit that will be on the Gentile bride look at the spirit that he had holy followed Moses and then the scripture says Moses told him you can have the land wherein your feet have trod brother amen do y'all know that's how how that Caleb received his promise it was the land he had trotten out and he had said we're able to take it he walked in Hebrew Hebron with a with a mountain was with anoch and his sons lived which were the Giants that was the land he walked out and he was given that land for promise oh my it had the biggest giants but it had the best property too it was in Hebron why do you think them Giants were living there come on the strongest took the best land the strongest in in the Giants the Giants took the best of the property what do you think Giants are moving in today they're not moving in on things that's 5,000 years ago or amen upon another church age they're moved in upon the things for the bride of Christ amen and they're living there because that's where the good things are amen but the Church of the Living God is a galeb and we're stronger than the Giants because we're not looking at the Giants we're looking at the promises of God my when I think about this I think about Caleb who was given the land where he ENT trod the Bible tells us amen that that Caleb had that spirit that he followed and that he was able to possess it now I thought this was amazing that he took the the land of Hebron Hebron was a city do you know it was actually given to the Levites as a City of Refuge amen that actually was his possession was the land of Hebron so he didn't get the actual City but he got everything around the city he was connected to the city of Hebron which was a City of Refuge i i i there's enough types in there to stay all night but but y'all know that there is one who is our refuge amen and that's exactly where our inheritance lays is in the city amen not the the city of Hebron but in the seventh City of Refuge Christ Our Lord do you know it was there through Hebron that Judah amen accepted Caleb and he became a part of the very promises and the land land his children inhabited that land amen I I I had to I had to just stop and scratch my head a minute and I I thought about Caleb being a gentile just just just struck my mind a moment and I thought dear Lord amen what kind of tribe would allow a gentile to come in how would that happen but it's amazing because the tribe of Judah is the tribe of the Kings amen which would which the ruler would come out of which was Christ is that right but do you know the tribe of Judah had already received Caleb amen but in that same in that same era of time when Joshua and Caleb crossed the river and they took the land of Jericho do you know that Rahab was added to the inheritance in that land but she was added by marriage to Sone and she was added to the tribe of Judah Caleb a gentile come into Israel through Judah Rahab came through Judah isn't that amazing amen that Rahab a gentile but married into the tribe amen and because of her marriage into that word she was the inheritor and the great grandmother of Jesus Christ and a possessor amen of the promises of God and it was happening through the line of Judah it's amazing to me because that's the same line amen now I'm thinking of inheritance here Caleb got his inheritance through Judah is that right Ruth amen got her inheritance where did she get her inheritance it was through Boaz amen which was also of the tribe of Judah it was Judah the tribe that brought Gentiles into the inheritance that was in the land of promise can you imagine tonight that we have the great King Jesus Christ who was the royal Seed of Abraham that brought every Gentile amen that's a part of God today that's how we receive our inheritance is through it is through Christ you can't receive a promise in this age without it being Christ you've got to come into Christ for every promise for everything you need you've got to come into Christ do you see it's through Christ that's where Caleb got it amen that's where Ruth got it that's where Rahab got it Ruth amen actually Boaz was a redeemer to the inheritance of Naomi now friends there is no end to the to the deepness of the types of what it means that the tribe of Judah was the one to receive a gentile and give them an inheritance in the land amen and to think that God has done the same thing for the Church of the Living God Amen look at the attribute that was laid on Caleb who looked at God's promise rather than looking at the giant that same attribute amen has come upon the Church of the Living God who looks at the promises of God rather than looking at the Giants and the a don't don't don't think bad amen of a believer in this age who refuses to see things that are contrary to the word it is their nature to look into the Unseen realm and believe that God is more than able Amen brother Bram said see there was many men looking at the circumstance but Caleb and Joshua was looking at the word of God God that made the difference woo brother that made the difference if you want a difference in your life amen if you really want a difference quit looking at the circumstance and look at the promise of God Caleb didn't just look one time he spent 45 years looking I I tell you it's a powerful thing Church the man stay encouraged all all those years amen do you see that he stayed encouraged all those years I love how the scripture tells us that he did receive his reward in due time the Bible tells us he received his reward reward in due time Paul says in the book of Galatians he said let us not be weary and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not now look look at that look at that man Caleb not fainting do you know the Bible said when he gave his report that the children of Israel tried to Stone him he was not a popular preacher at that moment it's the truth you would think that a man saying we're able to do this we we can take the land we are more than able to do you think they would have lifted him to a higher point but by preaching the word amen in the face of the circumstance they turned and stoned the man but look at him he didn't leave the field he didn't turn and walk away and say well I I tell you I can take the land but I can't convince the people he didn't he didn't do that he just stayed with the promise of God Amen he presented the promise of God not fainting therefore receiving the reward can I read you something I thought was a real interesting just something that uh uh just a writer wrote concerning this I thought it was very good myself it's not brother brandom so you don't have to receive it I just thought it was good uh it's not doctrinal if you do not uh give order or get exhausted or disheartened amen if you don't faint if you don't if if you don't get exhausted and disheartened now those are two powerful words but they're two words a Christian never wants to get acquainted with disheartened and exhausted it implies that unless a man preserves in doing good to the end of his life he can hope for no reward he who becomes disheartened and who gives over his efforts he that is appalled by obstacles and faints on the account of embarrassments thrown in the way Pines for eeve ease and withdraws from the field of benevolence shows that he has no true attachment to the cause isn't that something there's no true attachment to the cause if you become appalled at offenses if you easily become exhausted because of embarrassment and you see what you want to do is withdraw from the field of benevolence withdraw from the field of fighting amen you know how easy it is to resign and you just let things take over in your life you don't have to quit the church but to resign means that you're no longer in the fight you're no longer in the battle you're no longer pressing forward you're no longer you're no longer there Waring amen but but now if you're going to fight in this battle amen this is a spiritual battle you're going to face you're going to face some offenses you're going to face some disheartening times you're going to face some exhausting times but you're going to have to keep your eye on the recompense of the reward of not fainting amen amen listen if you're sold out for the cause amen listen I don't know maybe when we get there we'll be weary but we'll be weary with well doing amen we we'll have been fighting the battle such as the Bible promis that we should do it now I know exactly I've been in the battle long enough now to face some of the problems that you face as a warrior and some of the situations you get into when you when you're faced with offenses or you're faced with uh you're fac with disheartening times or I love how he says it here appalled by obstacles you ever get any obstacles in your life come going just preach to you a minute now you ever get obstacles obstacles and you're here on Thursday night so you're Overcomers but there's obstacles to being here on Thursday evening many people can't make it because of the obstacles now some of those obstacles are real some of them are not real real some of those obstacles is just a a that's profound isn't it that was inspiration some of those some of those obstacles are not real some of those obstacles are there and they become beneficial to your resignation of not wanting to be in service because of a situation because of a family maybe a little problem or a little struggle going on between you and a family member or you and part of the church or maybe you didn't like the way some said something or did something so you get a little offended or a little appalled then it becomes an obstacle to come to the house of God but sometimes people get over the Obstacle of coming but they can't get over the obstacle to go ahead and get into the service so maybe they're upset can I preach a little bit maybe they're upset the pastor a little bit so they they got a little obstacle there and they think well I'll go but I'll sure set on him till he shuts up I and you know he gets over in that little area corrects your corrects your life somehow amen and and it becomes a place where you're you're appalled and and I love how this little writer said something that just very struck a tune embarrassed some people some people have done things that are so odd to the scripture or to the way of it that they actually get embarrassed and they feel like withdrawing amen now I remember when I first got saved I I I went to church a little bit and then I got out of church and I went out and done some things that was wrong and I was so embarrassed that it l Lally become a mountain for me to come back to church I mean it was a mountain amen because amen here I was confessing to be a Christian and I had these things in my heart and i' done these things and the whole church knew about it and I was I was just I was just getting in I was trying my best well listen it was a mountain to me but to the church they knew I was a baby so I talk to somebody they said well brother Wayne you got to learn to walk before you can run amen you you I mean you know you got to learn you got to learn how don't be embarrassed if a baby if we're teaching a baby to crawl or a baby to walk and it falls in the floor I'm not embarrassed that baby fell I just pick the baby up and we'll teach you to walk amen and and if you're still in those stages where you're trying don't get embarrassed by the Fall listen to me this Bible is written about soldiers and heroes and warriors amen that they're in the Bible because they got up from a place of failure come on Church you got to see your position in the word of God God ain't rewriting the Bible every time you come to an obstacle in your life or an embarrassment comes along God don't rewrite the book and try to do things but he'll send a preacher along and he'll try to say to you don't you faint don't you get weary in this Walk of Life amen don't you get embarrassed and stay home you repent and bring your life before God well I don't know of a specific case but I do feel like I'm preaching right now I feel like I'm speaking to a need I from my heart I believe that people get embarrassed they get situations have you ever felt like you're just a failure now I don't want to I don't want to get up here and have a pity party so I'm not going to do that but I I could open you up a little bit to to what Ministry goes through so I tell you what your pastor goes through can you imagine trying to please everybody all the time can you imagine having a job knowing that every decision you made you got friends that's going to be angry and and friends that's going to love you can you imagine where there is a position where you just can't do it for everybody now I'm going to preach to you a minute what that becomes is you constantly are everyone's disappointment how would you like to be the disappointment to half of your friends every time you meet them they're disappointed and you find out it's you they're disappointed at how would that feel so it becomes a place of embarrassment where you feel like I I'm not enough I can't do enough I can't say enough so so if you if you get on that side and you start running that and looking at that and you labor in that and you start feeding on that then you get on come on preachers I'm preaching to you you get to feeling like I'm a nobody I ain't helping nobody I ain't doing nothing for the Lord I ain't never going to make it you ain't the first person to ever walk that trail here's a Caleb setting here that's been pastoring the church for years and years and years amen but just as much Vigor as he ever had because it's in your spirit what kind of spirit are you have you don't come on now you got to be sold out to the cause that means we're not quitters that means we're not quitters here tonight we're not just going to fold up our hands and say it's too hard we we can't take the land we can't do these things but we are the Church of the Living God and the devil is bread for the Church of the Living God come on friends we are more than Overcomers here tonight tonight said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about if you want faint not amen there's something for you to reap if you wanton faint there's a place of reaping there's a there's a season in your life where you'll turn around and see the benefits come on mother you'll see the benefits them babies start getting baptized and you'll thank God you quw in the church every Sunday morning and you got them together and got in the car and you drove down amen there's a reward that comes upon you amen if you do the right right thing well may not been what you come to hear but I think it's what I got to say said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about that Caleb spirit that wouldn't become embarrassed or appalled or offended but he was sold to a cause he was literally sold to a cause Amen in being that watch what amen if you won't become disheartened watch what were doing they were looking at the promise they wasn't looking at the situation how many people would be enough before you would say maybe I shouldn't do this look at Caleb and Joshua the entire tribe the the entire Bunch said amen we're going to Stone you for preaching that message like that but look at what they were they were not quitters they believed it was the word of God and they were going to press on because they wasn't looking at the problem they were looking at the word and church we can learn something from these men that were looking at the word we can look at these things and see these men and how they survived amen I know sometimes you get in situation Brother s maybe you don't feel like shouting maybe you don't feel like rejoicing you know most of the time when we don't it's our own problem we can put it on the preacher we can put it on the song leader but honestly most of the time it's something we're going through personally and the devil's woring our mind with a little something we thought or something we did in that little situation embarrassed embarrassed within your own mind about some situation come on Church come on but I'll tell you how to overcome it tonight David said bless the Lord did he not say it he said bless the Lord and forget not all of his benefits he who forgiveth all thine iniquities and look what David could do David could bless the Lord embarrassed you bet he was troubled you bet he was was but David wasn't a quitter he was going to worship God no matter the circumstance or the situation and I believe the Church of the Living God can perform the same worship that David did Joshua and Caleb's a great great lesson now I I think it's amazing because if you go to the scripture amen we we we we're finding that Caleb got an inheritance and I I want to just mention this for a couple moments here amen his inheritance now look at what brother bam does in Daniel 11 he said the people that know their God a bride shall know her mate the revealed word so what brother brandom is doing is he's allotting he's allotting a scripture to a church he's he's taking an allotment out of the of the Bible and he's identifying it with an individual group or with a people who's coming under his word he's showing you this is your portion in the you bunch of Gentiles through Christ This is a portion of the word that was written with you in mind my goodness amen now think of this because uh can can I can I take this to Apostle Paul uh who was the he was the Apostle of the Gentiles who brought the law into Grace and brought the Gentiles in through preaching promise I tell you I think it's powerful man he understood he understood the power of preaching the promise look at Ephesians chapter 1 and watch what he says here in the 11th verse in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and inheritance can we take about that talk about that just a moment obtaining inheritance that word inheritance in this specific scripture the Greek word is different than every other Greek word inheritance in the Bible it's a odd thing because this specific Greek word concerning inheritance is written differently in that it's every other time you see it it's another word and it means possession or inheritance possession but in this one it means differently in that we have obtained an inheritance meaning like the casting of Lots now it's pretty amazing because now Paul is tying together the church the bride with coming into inheritance but he's typing it with the Greek word the casting of lots he said what how what does that have to do with us what's pretty powerful when you start reading the Old Testament scripture and you go back to the Book of Joshua when Joshua was coming into the land of promise in Joshua chapter 14 in the second verse the Bible said by lot was their inheritance and the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses nine tribes and for a half a tribe now it's a it's Joshua in the days of the inheritance he actually cast lots for the purpose of identifying a tribe with a land you'll also find in the Book of Numbers the 22nd chap 26th chapter 55th verse notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit according to the lot shall The Possession thereof be divided between many and few for the lot now it sounds like that this is a game of chance a lot like you cast a lot it's a game of chance but according to Proverbs 16 the Bible said the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing therefore is of the Lord now if you go to the Book of Proverbs in the 18th chapter it said the lot causeth contention to cease and parteth between the mighty now look in the land when they were going to develop that land and and there were tribes are going to go in to possess the land can you imagine the contention between the tribes upon who what took part of the land who who was going to take this part and who's going to take this part that would have been a well I think our tribe's better and our tribes bigger and I think we need this position but you you got to see that God was the one that ordained where those tribes were going to be and he did it by the casting of Lots now think about this because these men Joshua and Caleb and the tribes of Israel of the new generation that was moving into the promised land they had their names on this land it was foreordained by the labor pains of their mothers in Genesis the 30th chapter hundreds of years before these men were ever born their tribes names as the sons of Jacob when they were being born their mothers cried out their names and birth pains can you imagine she would cry Ephraim she would cry Judah and under that labor pain that let's just use Judah can we amen she cried Judah and when she cried out the name Judah it represented a city and a place in near Hebron in the Bible in the land of Israel so God was identifying that which was coming forth with a place he had ordained and created before the foundation when God was creating the Earth he pulled Israel down he pulled up the mountain ranges he brought forth the city of heon in his mind and there amen he had a woman cry that named Judah over a child that was being born hundred hundreds of years before Judah would ever step foot into that land but Moses remember when they were going Moses said amen take Caleb oh God Amen when they were getting ready they took the heads of the Trib put their names upon the lots and they would cast the lots to see which tribe went to which land can you imagine this Caleb was given the lot of Judah his lot was in the amen I'm not making it clear his lot was in the lot of Judah in other words when Judah was chosen so was Caleb chosen he was he was connected to the land by promise amen he identified the land oh God that God had in his mind and Caleb to go into that place think about it God ordained it the mother spoke it Moses prophesied it and here Joshua is standing in before the land and the people are saying I wonder if Caleb really is supposed to be in this land I really wonder if he's supposed to be here amen and all of a sudden the lots are tasked and the lot rolls over there Caleb Judah belongs in the land of Hebron amen you talk about removing contention brother with the supernatural God tied together what the mother said with what Moses said with what Joshua said the scriptures lined one upon the other and now the supernatural was identified this is the place and this is the city and this is the people my Lord and Paul uses that as his example that we have obtained an inheritance in Christ in other words when God cast the lot we was Christ we was identified with Jesus Christ my you know brother R said when Jesus was chosen you were chosen in him before the foundations of the world I'm sorry I get a little excited I can't help it it's amazing to me that they would they would use this method I I never seen that inheritance laying there I never seen Paul tie that like that today I was reading and that that that scripture opens up showing you exactly what brother random said was true he said the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua of the New Testament and here Joshua was casting lots according to Moses and according to the mothers and the supernatural was identifying under inspiration these things all line up and now Paul is telling us that the Joshua Church would be found under the same order of God by the spirit now brother B says it like this he said Jesus paid for your inheritance he said but the Holy Ghost come to divide it remember that look at the Book of Joshua the first chapter he said now you be strong and of good courage for I have given to you to divide the land so whoever was to live where was according to the Holy Ghost when the spirit of the Lord placed someone in a place there should be no contention over the position that God gives you see that now the only time you get contention is when you argue with God when the holy spirit gives like like our pastor here God ordained him any anybody with good sense could know God ordained brother a here to be the pastor of this place amen I put my lot with his I I walked right with him I believe that so so that as long as you receive that and you walk with that there's no contention there but let somebody start going over into the inheritance or into the position and watch the contention so to keep contention you work in your own field C C can I have some help see if you stay in your place then the contention ain't there because the supernatural has already ordained the leadership and that leadership is our God ordained leadership and under that leadership we're going to take the Giants come on we're going to take the land under that leaders we'll work as a body and every devil is defeated and every devil is put under your foot because Amen brother Ram said they didn't go into the adoption because of the mumbling and complaining and the gripping and the fight come on Church they didn't go in because of unbelief but the bride Church has been appointed and adopted and seen in the land come on now the types are running deep we have obtained an inheritance that word obtained inheritance actually is one word it's not two it's one Greek word they use two Greek words to describe it obtained an inheritance it actually means a past tense thing in other words it's not something that's going to be appropriated it's not something that's got to be worked out at a later time but we have obtained an inheritance in other words it's already a position or situation they use the word passive in the I'm not a real English major or Greek but the word passive means in other words there's nothing you're going to do here we have obtained an inheritance in Christ other words there's nothing that we're going to do to obtain we have already obtained in Christ when God received Christ he received you and me and we have an inheritance in him amen according to God now I I I I can I can show you what brother Ram said about this he said the inheritance here he said is that you have a name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's what he said he said your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life he said your inheritance is eternal life as a son oh boy look at that position not even the angels are Sons but you have obtained an inheritance as Sons now C can I can I stop the type of Joshua and Caleb and come pick up another type for a second can can we take it just now don't tie the two types together let's pick up another type in Joshua chapter 18 do you know that several of the tribes had already been established but there were seven tribes that hadn't been if you go read it Joshua 18 speaks of seven tribes tribes that had not yet been positioned but they were coming into position do you know how they found their position the same way the Bible said that Joshua cast lots the same as he did before to show that God continually was placing even those seven after I don't know maybe we could run some topes here tonight I don't want to get into a bunch of crazy things but but Seven's a good number isn't it I mean you know Paul and then you got seven and then you got the church in the last days who come into the inheritance time the same as they did in the days of Joshua same land now the number 11 it stuck out to me personally I thought it was good amen because Jesus said the 11th Hour worker gets the pay of the same as the first hour worker is that right so those seven got the same thing the others got even if they come later they still got the same land that the others got because it was their inheritance it was what God had give them listen you might be a late Boomer maybe you've not come to that place yet but don't you let that devil keep you in a rocking chair amen fing and resigned and wey amen this is your land church this is your message this is your hour this is a generation and a Time amen that Devil's bread to you you sir brother Wayne how do you know if you read your Bible it said in the fourth generation that the iniquity of the Amorite would become fool right and watch Joshua knew scripturally that the iniquity of the Amorite was full at the same time that their progression for adoption was coming so God let two things happen at the same time he let the end of the Amorite world come at the same time that Joshua was there to collect what belong on to the Church of the Living God and here we are again when the whole world is falling apart every demon is running and the Church of the Living God has received the message of the supernatural that we are to be positioned into the word of God the same as when Paul was positioning so is the church to come into position of obtained an inheritance somebody's got to leave you something brother brother BR said so he left your name on the Lamb's Book of Life Now how do we get into this her inheritance how do we get into this inheritance we are predestinated inheritance I'm reading brother Bam by predestination inherited something inheritance by predestination oh then think about that you didn't earn it so you can't lose it that's right well that makes me feel pretty good so it's an Incorruptible inheritance it's not something that's going to be taken it's something that God has given it's something he's already done now watch in the adoption sermon brother Brandon will come adoption part three and he say God buys four and all seeing exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved so sent Jesus to save those who had already been chosen didn't Paul say five verses behind this that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price and the what he's shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do let that soak in a minute so brother when you can't preach like that well I did it already nothing you can do somebody says well but he that SNS willfully after coming to the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice he said there's where you'll rise up again say how about that brother Bram so brother Bram was using the scripture of attained an inheritance and the blood had paid for it there's nothing you could do and then look what he says but somebody will raise up and say say now watch that giant the moment you preach eternal security here's the giant they'll raise up and say brother brandom somebody knew the Lord and they fell away somebody believed it and they fell away somebody got the Holy Ghost and they backslid see there there is no eternal security brother M is showing you that is a twisting of scripture now watch this the Lord spoke to me we have received the word of truth remember that I I I preached it not realizing that this text lined exactly with that thought because he says see what they did brother is they received he said they never received the truth they just received the knowledge of it oh my goodness they never received the truth they received a knowledge of Truth in other words they heard the message they never did receive it he says watch now it is impossible for those once in last and have taste of heavenly gift made partakers of the Holy Ghost Taste of the good word of God the power of the world to come if they fall away to renew themselves again to repentance sin They Crucified themselves the Son of God aresh put them to an open chain now he said I know what you legalist has got to have that in your mind right now but you're wrong he said I'll stand on this Bible if God ever saved a man he's saved for Time and Eternity and you can't make it it say anything else you can't make it say anything else you can't make the word lie church we have received the word of Truth you say well well I tell you brother I me you know I knew this guy he knew the Lord and he fell away what about him brother BR said what about Saul then what about Saul he was he was a king as anointed of God he back live before the Lord Elijah come to him and said you'll be with me tomorrow about this time but said see then Saul went took a premature grave went home early because of the life he lived but God took him home come on church sometimes God takes his children home but they're his children there's a lot of difference between disobedient children and children of Disobedience we are not the children of disobedience you might have been a disobedient child but you're not the child of Disobedience come on Church you got a three-year-old child and it won't sit down maybe it's rocking everything Mama gets a little upset she don't give the child away she says come on kid we're going home it's truth it's truth she don't give the child the way she come on child we're going to home the way you're acting I can't put up with it no more let's go home come on church God don't lose what he says God don't throw away what he's redeemed I am persuaded I am persuaded as Abraham was persuaded as Paul was persuaded you say you're persuaded yeah God swore by nothing greater than himself and made us hes of the promise of God in this last day he persuaded Abraham that he started it now he's finishing it now that runs deep I I know I don't have time for those topes you want me give you that one persuaded what persuaded Abraham when he met that one who was God In the Flesh his persuasion become equipped and in the last day that same one comes and swears that time shall be no more he was the beginning of Abraham's Faith he's the ending of Abraham's Faith he is the one that has persuaded us that the word of God is true in the last day do you see what it is we're talking about perfection God for ordained it now I I've got just a couple more I I'll I I'll close look what he said it's impossible now we we took this in a Bible study the other day it's reason reason I know this quotes here I thought it was powerful he said sometimes we believed that that was a man who was once enlightened and fell away again but the Bible doesn't read that way it's absolutely impossible he says here that has received the Holy Spirit to ever fall away oh my now you said brother Wayne I seen him do wrong brother brother ain't talking about that it's not what he's talking about he's not talking about what you're seeing he's talking about what God did in the Eternal questions and answers brother Ram said now that looks it looks that way from the way you're reading it there now look at what he's showing you rightly dividing the word of truth from the way you're reading it a man could receive the Holy Ghost and then backslide and be lost but it's impossible ible for him to do it he can't do it if he did Christ lied it's impossible for those once Enlighten now watch here what he's speaking to he's speaking to those borderline Jews he never said a man filled with the Holy Ghost he said he tasted of the word he was a partaker of the Holy Ghost brother R said by hearing the word he partook of it he didn't receive it now I'm I'm I'm saying that watch where we are Joshua and Caleb look where they were here's Paul now telling the Ephesian Church he's bringing them into obtaining an inheritance and a take the things Paul says in the book of Hebrews and literally says to the people amen that you can't possess this land you can't come into this land but Satan always takes the word and twists it down to mean that you can't go in he always does it every promise that God ever made the church he'll twist it down to mean that you can't go in but we have been made amen full of the spirit of God we have received more than a knowledge we have received the truth we don't just have a knowledge we have received the truth amen what's he talking about he's talking about a man that heard the word and turned away from it look what they theyed the knowledge now just in case you're wondering paragraph 3:13 Hebrew series brother bam I'm a Christian but I blasphemed the Holy Ghost I said it's impossible a Christian could not blaspheme the Holy Ghost you can't do it that's powerful friend you're talking about something to put on the end of Caleb's sword you're talking about defeating every giant you're talking about obtaining a promise it is an impossible for a Christian to do it now what's he talking about he's talking about a man that come to a knowledge now what is it oh once a man received the Holy Spirit then he would backslide he'd be lost forever brother B said I couldn't get this other to make sense with that then why is it that the Bible said it he said he that heareth my words and believeth has sent me have eternal life and shall not come into condemnation but pass from Death unto life all the father hath given me will come to me none of them will I lose I will raise them up in the last day no man can pluck them out from my hand how does that divvy up with this I just couldn't understand it it was impossible for once we're enlightened there's something wrong I just couldn't get it you see he couldn't make those scriptures line up with those scriptures until the supernatural comes in do you see what Joshua is doing he's taking the scripture and identifying you in that portion and dividing the land right there at Kadesh and saying saying look now look what he's saying I don't I don't have the ability sister Susie to preach this I just have I don't really have the ability to communicate it but only Caleb and Joshua went in only Caleb and Joshua the rest of us had to be a new generation only that Spirit went in the rest went in not be because of unbelief it separated those Spirits at the at the line do you see that it's separated at the line they couldn't get in they couldn't come into the land but all church that was a Caleb standing there not disheartened not embarrassed not appalled not scared not offended but a spirit that we're able to take this land and I believe tonight that there's a portion for the bride of Christ this is where I'm going by the way there's a portion for the bride of Christ it's the third pull it's your portion it's your possession and the devil's going to pick you apart to keep you from standing on that every mistake every fault every problem every bad thought every situation he does not want that bride standing on that promise oh but God has given us a place to stand tonight hey man won't you stand to your feet with me tonight God's give us a place to stand we can stand on the Promises of God God wasn't gambling God was using the supernatural to take the contention away of his choice what he chose what God chooses when the supernatural comes with it you can see it as God's choice and then then let Ephraim and Judah work in their fields the Bible said every joint supplies is that right every joint supplies heyen it's a supply and time what a body amen what a body can we bow our hearts tonight gracious Lord we thank you for the anointing upon your word Lord we I I don't have the ability to express the thing that I'm seeing Lord but I pray you help us Lord and Lord the things that we have spoken may you take this and use it somehow to encourage to strengthen Lord father to put your people on the front line I ask you tonight for your grace Lord for that Wicked enemy that's come Lord try to work every corner to get someone to back up a little father I rebuke that Spirit tonight and I pray that by the grace of God that you will awaken every child of God in this building Lord may you awaken them to the reality that this is the hour this is the generation that we're is the season Lord we're not to be slothful in this season as Joshua told them seven tribes don't hinder yourself any longer don't wait any longer go and possess your inheritance I pray father tonight that may your church Lord get a hunger Lord may they see the Giants is bread may they go into battle father we commit them to you tonight father keep them in thy word in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Lord amen my do you love him tonight amen amen you got something on your heart for many years now
