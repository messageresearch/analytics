[5:07] God we believe
[5:11] God we believe for him.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe him this morning?
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe for it. You believe
[5:21] for miracles this morning?
[5:23] &gt;&gt; You believe for the impossible this
[5:24] morning.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Believe.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask you how we felt about it.
[5:30] He didn't ask what the circumstance was.
[5:33] You said it.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; And we can move unmovable things. And we
[5:38] can change things that were not
[5:39] possible. And they become possible
[5:42] because we believe.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I thank God this morning that he
[5:46] made it he made it so uh simple and so
[5:49] easy
[5:50] &gt;&gt; when that man came before the Lord Jesus
[5:53] and his child was falling in the fire
[5:55] and he described the situation to the
[5:57] Lord. He said Lord your disciples have
[5:59] not been able to help me.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; He said but but could you do something
[6:03] about this?
[6:05] &gt;&gt; And the Lord looked back at him and said
[6:07] can thou believe.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; The question is not whether God can do
[6:11] it.
[6:12] The question lays on, do we believe?
[6:15] &gt;&gt; And I say, God, help our unbelief.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Increase our faith, Lord. Build our
[6:20] hearts toward him. Amen. What a
[6:22] wonderful morning. Amen. To serve the
[6:24] Lord. And Amen. to What a beautiful song
[6:27] service and worship service. Amen. How
[6:29] many's got the joy this morning?
[6:34] &gt;&gt; No. No. I mean, like joy, the real kind
[6:36] of stuff. How many got joy this morning?
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the kind that makes the
[6:42] the top pop off. You know, the kind that
[6:44] makes you get up in the morning say,
[6:46] "I'm drinking from my saucer cuz my
[6:48] cup's done overflow. That kind of joy.
[6:51] The kind of joy you got enough for
[6:53] yourself and some for your neighbor."
[6:54] Amen. You got enough for your neighbor
[6:56] this morning.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; You got enough joy for your neighbor
[6:59] this morning. Turn around, tell them
[7:00] say, "I got joy for me and you."
[7:03] &gt;&gt; If you if you having a bad day, that's I
[7:04] got joy for me and I got joy for you.
[7:07] Amen. I got double joy this morning cuz
[7:10] I've been saved and sanctified and
[7:12] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; You ought to be the happiest person on
[7:18] the face of the earth today. I'm a
[7:21] Christian.
[7:24] I'm not a Christian because I was good.
[7:26] I'm a Christian because he elected me.
[7:28] He made me. He called me. And I accepted
[7:32] it. Amen. And I say, "Hell, you better
[7:34] get out of the way because I'm a
[7:35] Christian.
[7:37] There is a host of angels about me and
[7:39] God has set in front of me and his
[7:42] presence can make mountains move. It can
[7:44] make trees move. It can make rivers
[7:47] move. It can make devils move.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're saints of God on our way to
[7:52] the very thing that God said we could
[7:54] have.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; And I got joy.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be sad and downtrodden and
[8:01] depressed. I got joy. Amen.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; That's one thing the devil can't take
[8:05] from me
[8:06] &gt;&gt; is my joy.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't give it to me.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; The world didn't give it to me.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; So they can't have it.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; It's mine. I'm going to keep it.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning? What
[8:22] a
[8:22] &gt;&gt; what a blessing to be in the house of
[8:24] God on a Sunday morning. Amen. Amen. If
[8:27] you um maybe just before we read the
[8:28] word of God, we bow our heart and in a
[8:31] word of prayer and thanksgiving
[8:33] and uh you know sometimes we come to the
[8:37] Lord and we ask him for things.
[8:40] When's the last time you went to him and
[8:43] just spent about a minute telling him
[8:45] what you think about him
[8:47] &gt;&gt; and about the glory of his presence and
[8:49] the power of his existence.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; All right. And then when you praised him
[8:53] just a little while,
[8:54] &gt;&gt; oh yes,
[8:55] &gt;&gt; the things you're about to ask him to do
[8:56] are going to be very small.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts. Father,
[9:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; As many times your prophet would call
[9:05] you the author of creation,
[9:08] the father of us all.
[9:11] And Lord, to you whom hung the heavens,
[9:15] the sun, the moon just rolled off of
[9:17] your hand. The stars were blown into
[9:20] existence. Wonderful.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Just one word from you, Lord. Every
[9:24] tree, every bird,
[9:26] &gt;&gt; the waters filled the earth.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; The earth itself hangs in the heavens,
[9:30] Lord.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, before I knew you, before I knew
[9:35] this earth, you knew me, my name.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; You knew my parents. You knew the place
[9:39] of my birth.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; You knew the moment that I would come to
[9:42] know you.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; You aligned the stars and the heavens
[9:47] that would bring us to this earth, Lord.
[9:49] And then you place us together in a
[9:51] place like this this morning. And Lord,
[9:54] you are who are in supreme control of
[9:56] all things. We invite you that you would
[9:58] have your liberty this morning in this
[10:00] building. That your grace, Lord, would
[10:03] overflow our lives.
[10:05] Lord, it's been told us of the word of
[10:08] God that we're free moral agents. That
[10:10] we have a choice. And Lord, if I'm given
[10:13] a choice, I choose you.
[10:16] I choose to serve you in my troubled
[10:18] times. I choose to worship you when
[10:21] things are heavy. I choose to love you
[10:24] whether I'm on the mountain or in the
[10:26] valley.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Because you are the adoration of all my
[10:29] praise and all of my hopes and all of my
[10:31] life.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, without you,
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're less than nothing.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; But because of you, Lord, we have a
[10:40] wonderful place to worship this morning.
[10:42] We have a family. We have life in our
[10:45] hearts. We have faith in our souls. And
[10:49] Lord, you that done that for me, you'll
[10:51] do that for anyone that would ask. And I
[10:54] pray this morning to the congregation
[10:56] that's gathered. Lord, if there be one
[10:58] that don't know you in that way, may you
[11:00] express yourself to them this morning.
[11:02] And may the great inspiration of the
[11:04] Holy Spirit use this meeting, Lord. And
[11:07] may you walk the aisles here this
[11:09] morning. If there's one of your children
[11:10] that's locked in the bars of
[11:12] misunderstandings, Lord, or some wrong
[11:15] spirit has got their mind, I pray you'd
[11:17] release them this morning, Lord. May
[11:20] they leave this building this morning as
[11:22] the two left that room that morning,
[11:24] saying, "Did not our hearts burn?"
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, when they realize that you're
[11:28] alive and that you still move in your
[11:30] presence? And I pray this morning that
[11:33] the great witness of that resurrection
[11:35] would be among us. Lord,
[11:37] &gt;&gt; we ask you for these things now. take
[11:39] your word, speak to your children, Lord,
[11:41] and do that which only you could do. We
[11:44] thank you for it, Father, in Jesus name.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And God bless you. As I
[11:50] invite you to the word of the Lord this
[11:52] morning, I I want to go into the book of
[11:54] Philippians, the third chapter. Uh if
[11:57] you have your Bibles, Philippians
[11:59] chapter 3, we want to welcome all the
[12:00] visitors among us. And God bless you
[12:02] all. And it's certainly a great honor to
[12:05] have you here with us. And amen, we are
[12:07] a we are a place of gathering of eagles
[12:11] and believers that believe in this great
[12:13] end time message.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which has exalted our Lord Jesus
[12:17] back to the head of the body.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; So our our adoration and our praises to
[12:22] his name. So if you love him like we
[12:23] love him, you you feel free to worship
[12:25] him in the word or in the praise and
[12:28] just just enjoy yourself within our
[12:29] gates. In Philippians chapter 3 and
[12:31] verse 12, not as though I had already
[12:34] attained,
[12:36] either were already perfect,
[12:39] but I follow after. Now Paul is not
[12:41] going to allow his imperfections
[12:44] or his troubles change his directions.
[12:48] I follow after if that I may apprehend
[12:51] that which I also am apprehended of
[12:54] Christ Jesus. Now, brethren, I count not
[12:57] myself to have apprehended, but this one
[12:59] thing I do,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; forgetting the things which are behind
[13:03] me,
[13:04] &gt;&gt; all right?
[13:05] &gt;&gt; And reaching forth unto the things. And
[13:07] I love the way he says things because he
[13:09] doesn't detail because your things are
[13:11] different than his things. My things are
[13:14] different than your things, but there's
[13:15] things.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; True. So the things which are behind you
[13:18] and you're reaching forth under things
[13:20] which are before you. And then he tells
[13:23] you what thing was before him. I press
[13:25] toward the mark
[13:27] &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling of God
[13:30] in Christ Jesus. May God bless his word
[13:32] as you could be seated this morning. I
[13:34] want to speak to you again. I'm I'm I'm
[13:36] off of that opening the word series
[13:38] again this morning. And I'm going to
[13:39] speak to you again on spiritual amii
[13:41] ambitions part two. Amen. Uh I just uh
[13:46] just have a lot of things in my heart
[13:48] concerning it. So I want to I want to
[13:50] revisit it. The spiritual amnesia or
[13:52] spiritual ambition part two. Of course a
[13:55] lot of times when you say the word
[13:56] ambition, you know, everybody thinks
[13:58] something negative, but I don't want to
[14:00] use it in a negative connotation. I want
[14:02] to use it in a positive that you might
[14:05] see that that it's not always wrong to
[14:07] have ambition. It's just what according
[14:10] is your ambition. That's what that's
[14:12] what matters is what is the ambition.
[14:14] And and the prophet of God says, "An
[14:16] eagle stareth their nest." God likens
[14:18] his heritage unto the eagles. Amen. How
[14:20] many eagles we got here this morning?
[14:22] Amen. Eagles. And where the carcass is,
[14:24] they're the eagles will gather. So
[14:26] you're you're God's children. You're
[14:27] likened unto eagles. Amen. Uh you're
[14:29] you're an eagle because another thing an
[14:32] eagle does, the eagle builds its nest up
[14:34] high. And how oft uh uh many times I got
[14:38] off my horse and tied to a little
[14:40] sapling and got my binoculars and
[14:41] searched the skies to find an eagle to
[14:43] study him in high in the Rockies and and
[14:46] the eagle builds his nest just as high
[14:48] as he can build it. See, it's safety and
[14:51] protection. He said it's so high until
[14:54] the predators can't get to him.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that brother Brandham
[14:58] actually said the problem with Billy
[15:00] Graham's ministry was he built his nest
[15:02] too low? He said, "So the snakes got in
[15:05] and got his his young."
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But eagles build their nest way up
[15:09] high. Amen. Way up high in the mountain.
[15:11] That's where the nest is built. And
[15:13] brother says, "Oh, that's the reason God
[15:15] likens his church under the eagle." He
[15:18] says, "Because the eagle's nest, which
[15:19] is the church, the eagle's nest, which
[15:22] is the church." He says, "It's built far
[15:24] beyond the cares of the world. It's out
[15:27] of the danger line. See, it's crossed
[15:30] the blood with a modern prowling of
[15:32] predators. never get to it. He said,
[15:34] "You're a city that setits on a hill. A
[15:37] candle that's lit in the room." Oh,
[15:39] something. The church of the living God
[15:41] is built on high ambitions.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have a high ambition?
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see when I hear the church
[15:48] that hasn't got any ambition to grow,
[15:51] there's something wrong with that
[15:52] church? The church of the living God has
[15:55] a high ambition. And another thing, the
[15:57] church of God is built high because it's
[16:00] anticipations and expectations. He
[16:03] people say, "Well, we belong to our
[16:04] church and our father served in this
[16:06] church." He said, "That might be fine,
[16:08] but the church of the living God can't
[16:11] sit still there." See, its ambitions has
[16:13] got to go a little higher, a little
[16:15] farther. We We want to see the blind
[16:18] healed.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are watching tomorrow for the
[16:22] dead to be raised. When we see nature
[16:24] obey his voice, we're looking for the
[16:27] coming of Christ, its ambitions is high
[16:30] and its anticipations is high. Its inspe
[16:33] expectations are high because it's built
[16:36] high. Amen. As eagles, we are we're a
[16:38] different kind of bird. We're we're not
[16:41] built for the ground. You know, I think
[16:42] of the beauty of the of the examples of
[16:44] the creatures of how that we were
[16:46] teaching out of the Revelation series
[16:48] and Brother Bam said there was a lion
[16:50] and there was a man, there was an ox and
[16:52] then there was an eagle. But you watch
[16:53] that last one. It's not just an eagle.
[16:55] It's actually a flying eagle. Amen. And
[16:58] and you know, none of those other
[17:00] creatures go high on the mountain. But
[17:02] but when you speak about capstone age
[17:04] and you talk about the eagle age and and
[17:07] what you're talking about, it's when it
[17:09] goes high up on the mountain. So the
[17:11] church of the living God will never be
[17:13] satisfied in the valleys. Now I I know
[17:16] that I know that eagles can get in
[17:18] blowdowns and and brother Bam seen one
[17:20] one time in a blowdown. He and he said
[17:23] that he said it was an eagle in a
[17:24] blowdown. So there's a difference if
[17:26] it's a sparrow in the blowdown or if
[17:28] it's a hawk in a blowdown or if it's an
[17:29] eagle in a blowdown. And and if it's an
[17:32] eagle in the blowdown, amen, then that
[17:34] eagle still has its wings. It has the
[17:36] ability to to rise out of that. Amen. On
[17:39] the winds of God. And and and eagles are
[17:42] not ones with great fear. So So Brother
[17:44] Bam is giving us examples of of being
[17:47] able to know that it's an eagle. and and
[17:49] and and the spiritual ambition, amen,
[17:52] that's in the church. See, we can get
[17:54] low, but that don't mean it has to stay
[17:56] low. Like if you go through something as
[17:58] an individual, I think it's David that
[18:01] wrote it and he says, see, that we
[18:03] should have our youth renewed as the
[18:05] eagle. And and you know that I don't
[18:08] know how many uh how many uh details
[18:10] that we have that are exact because I'm
[18:12] not an eagle scientist, but but you
[18:14] know, brother Ram talks about the
[18:15] renewing of an eagle. Amen. He said it's
[18:18] the only bird that can get all the way
[18:19] down and then come all the way back to
[18:21] its youth again. And and and there's
[18:23] what they call a moloten stage where
[18:25] where they have to kind of rebirth
[18:28] themselves somewhere's along their age.
[18:30] And and I've seen uh Christians go
[18:32] through these kinds of things and I've
[18:34] seen them get real low and struggle
[18:36] through moments in their lives. But but
[18:38] see those times don't change what you
[18:41] are. They don't they don't make you a
[18:43] hawk or they don't they don't make you
[18:45] some kind of other animal. You're an
[18:47] eagle. And if you're an eagle, you was
[18:49] an eagle to begin with. And that's a
[18:51] nature. And then we'll renew that eagle.
[18:53] Amen. And and and an eagle, amen, it
[18:56] it's able to fly. See, it's able to it's
[18:58] able to get in the ambitions of God.
[19:00] See, God can have an ambition or God can
[19:03] have something, but other birds are not
[19:05] fit to fly in that realm or that or that
[19:08] way. But see, when God made you that, he
[19:11] made you that way for an ambition. Now,
[19:13] um, when you talk about spiritual
[19:16] ambition, it's the, uh, let me just give
[19:18] you a little bit of a my definition
[19:20] here. It's a relentless pursuit of God's
[19:23] purposes.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; It It's not a a selfish gain for for uh,
[19:27] for my kingdom, but it's a game for his
[19:30] kingdom. Amen. It's about wanting more
[19:33] of God for God. Amen. It's more about
[19:36] his presence. It's more about him
[19:38] working through us. Amen. In in the
[19:41] church age book, Brother Bannon will say
[19:42] this. He'll say, "See, those in the
[19:45] bride will only do his will." Now,
[19:48] that's the difference between Satan
[19:49] looking for a throne, amen, and the
[19:52] bride looking for a throne. See, they
[19:54] will only do his will. See, the bride,
[19:56] Amen, will actually live in harmony with
[19:59] the father.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; How many knows that? Brother said, "The
[20:01] same harmony that existed in the son
[20:04] will also exist in the bride." There'll
[20:06] be a harmony in there. Amen. I love that
[20:08] word harmony. Don't you? Do you know you
[20:10] can't get harmony on one string?
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know you can't get harmony on one
[20:15] string? When you hear somebody riding
[20:17] the same string all the time, that's not
[20:20] a harmony. That's one part of the
[20:22] message in which usually it has a
[20:24] direction. You know, you you get
[20:25] somebody, they lean on a certain thought
[20:27] all the time. They're leaning, leaning,
[20:29] leaning. That that's what it is. It's
[20:31] not harmony. Amen. They're disccluding
[20:33] all the other strings, you know. Amen.
[20:35] So that you can get harmony on one
[20:37] string. I I love a symphony. Don't you?
[20:40] I love the harmony of a symphony. The
[20:41] beautiful thing about the Church of the
[20:43] Living God. Brother Brandham taught us
[20:45] it's a bit like a symphony. Amen. And
[20:47] Brother said, you know, sometimes God
[20:49] will call you, Amen, for one little
[20:50] thing. Amen. There's maybe a preacher
[20:52] called for one sermon or maybe a
[20:54] believer called for one witness or or
[20:56] maybe God puts you in here to be a
[20:58] deacon or a trustee or whatever. But
[21:00] there's a harmony that exists. Amen. A
[21:03] according to the word of God, you know.
[21:05] Amen. You ever you ever anybody ever
[21:07] watched I used I actually watched the uh
[21:09] the orchestra or the symphony. Uh
[21:11] brother Bam talked about Peter and the
[21:12] Wolf. So I went and looked it up and
[21:14] watched it because I wanted to see what
[21:16] one really looked like, you know, and
[21:17] and there's no actors on the stage.
[21:19] There's no birds. There's no wolf.
[21:21] There's no nothing. There's a French
[21:22] harp and there's a bass drum and there's
[21:24] a there's all kinds of different
[21:26] instruments, you know, a and and each
[21:28] instrument represented a certain thing.
[21:31] And then that instrument, Brother Bram
[21:33] says, "Watch it." Now, when it begins to
[21:35] sound, it's sounding with the sheet
[21:37] music. It's telling a story.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so when the symphony comes in,
[21:41] it's beautiful because one man will come
[21:43] out and and the thing's kind of in
[21:45] disarray, you know, and all of a sudden
[21:47] he'll kind of tap him in. He'll kind of
[21:49] tap his little stick there and he'll
[21:51] hold that stick and all of a sudden that
[21:53] whole symphony starts getting in his
[21:55] sway. Amen. And you know, the the
[21:57] drummer don't drum, right? It ever every
[21:59] ever beat. and and and the and the
[22:01] French harp don't hit every beat. And
[22:03] you know, sometimes they just sit there
[22:05] and they're waiting for that moment when
[22:07] it strikes. You know, it's kind of like
[22:09] a church service. You know, there when a
[22:11] man of God's preaching and he's reading
[22:13] quotes and he's laying down, he's
[22:14] building a principle. And if you get
[22:16] somebody just trying to yell right
[22:18] there, they're taking away the attention
[22:20] from the word being produced in that
[22:22] moment. So if you'll wait just a moment,
[22:24] the whole symphony in a minute, it'll
[22:26] hit that high point and and the whole
[22:28] church will go amen. Now that's when you
[22:30] stand and that's when you Amen. But if
[22:33] you start getting out of sync, then it
[22:34] starts becoming less about the conductor
[22:37] conducting and more about the player
[22:39] playing. Amen. You got a guy overbeating
[22:42] on the drum and and it's supposed to be
[22:44] the French heart playing. Then it
[22:45] becomes confusion. See, then that's the
[22:48] reason there's an orchestra. There's a
[22:50] there's a rhythm to the things of God.
[22:52] Amen. You know, and usually somebody
[22:54] really likes to beat on their
[22:55] instrument. Amen. They'll look around
[22:56] the rest of the church. Why ain't y'all
[22:58] hitting on your instrument? You know,
[22:59] there's nothing wrong with their
[23:00] abilities. What it is is there's an
[23:03] order to it and there's a a moving of
[23:05] the spirit and they're wondering, "Amen.
[23:06] When you going to wait on the sheet
[23:08] music, you know, so so there's a there's
[23:10] a way that things are are transpiring.
[23:13] There's a there's a movement of the Holy
[23:15] Ghost. We're built higher than one amen
[23:17] or we're built higher than one service."
[23:20] Amen. Yet see this message is supposed
[23:22] to work in and through the bride in
[23:25] harmony and in the will of God. See, see
[23:28] those in the bride will only do his
[23:30] will. Amen. He he, brother Bam says he
[23:33] didn't complete all of his work when he
[23:35] was here in his earthly ministry.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; See now, so he works in and through his
[23:41] bride. So you are actually his body on
[23:44] the earth. And when God gets ready to do
[23:46] something, you're going to be the vessel
[23:48] that God works through. See what it is.
[23:50] Now the prophet will say this in kinsman
[23:52] redeemer. He'll say now we want to draw
[23:54] this first into our mind that there's
[23:57] not one thing that can destroy us until
[24:00] the purpose of him who created us has
[24:02] been fulfilled. See the God that created
[24:05] you. Amen. Also has a purpose for your
[24:07] life. Amen. And you cannot live in a
[24:10] place in your life thinking, Amen, that
[24:13] all of a sudden that you could just be
[24:15] squashed out like a bug because you're
[24:17] living in a in a in a in a realm where
[24:20] you're always it seems like you can't
[24:22] you can't live in victory and you can't
[24:24] live in joy because you're always
[24:26] worried about it. But the prophet said,
[24:27] "The guy that built you, the one that
[24:30] built you built you for a purpose."
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you got to get along with
[24:34] that God and figure out what your
[24:36] purpose is. Amen. You got to figure out
[24:38] what's the purpose that God has for me.
[24:40] Now, I can't give you that purpose. I I
[24:43] can't tell you you're built for this and
[24:44] you're built for this and you're built
[24:46] for this. That alone comes from God. You
[24:48] have to get in prayer. And then as you
[24:50] as you pray, the Holy Spirit begins to
[24:52] reveal to you your position in the word
[24:55] of God. And and then when you find that
[24:57] purpose, I want you to know this now.
[25:00] There is nothing can destroy you until
[25:03] that purpose that God had for you is
[25:05] fulfilled. My when I think about that,
[25:07] the prophet of God said, "If you were
[25:09] put here for a purpose, then there is
[25:11] nothing that can destroy us until God's
[25:14] purpose is fulfilled for us, nothing can
[25:17] harm us until that purpose that God has
[25:20] put us for has made himself manifest."
[25:23] No matter how much trouble we have,
[25:25] Amen. How much heartaches or how much
[25:28] sorrows that we go through, all of these
[25:30] things are reasons. And there is a
[25:33] reason for it. Now, now I know this. I'm
[25:35] going to read a scripture the devil
[25:36] hates more than any scripture in this
[25:38] Bible. And we know that all things work
[25:41] together for the good that them that
[25:43] love God and to them that are called
[25:45] according to his purpose. I believe this
[25:48] morning I am talking to the called of
[25:50] God. I don't believe you just showed up
[25:52] at True Word Tabernacle. I believe our
[25:54] lives are harder than that. Amen. I
[25:56] believe that God, amen, in his great
[25:59] destiny and his plan anointed you,
[26:01] called you, sent you, Amen, and brought
[26:04] you to this place. He displayed the
[26:06] greatest omnipotence the world has ever
[26:08] saw to get you in this building. God
[26:11] called you to this. Jesus said, "No man
[26:15] can come to me unless my father first
[26:17] draw him." Amen. If God hadn't have
[26:20] called you, you wouldn't be here this
[26:22] morning. If God hadn't beckoned you,
[26:24] there would have been a drug that could
[26:26] have kept you. There could have been a
[26:27] bar that would have held you. There
[26:29] would have been a church house and some
[26:31] denomination that would have kept you on
[26:33] their books. But because God called you,
[26:35] because God called you, there was
[26:37] nothing that could prevent your coming.
[26:41] And once you come to him, there is
[26:43] nothing that can destroy you until that
[26:46] purpose is done. David and I say that
[26:49] are to give a liberty of the house of
[26:51] God. We are to have such a joy this
[26:53] morning. Amen. I don't have enough
[26:55] money, but I've been called of God. I
[26:58] don't Amen. I'm going through struggles,
[27:00] but I've been called of God. There's
[27:02] problems, but I've been called of God.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there is a purpose for
[27:07] my life, and all things work together
[27:09] for the good of them that have love God
[27:12] &gt;&gt; and are called according to his purpose.
[27:15] Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I've always been amazed at the
[27:19] psychology side of that because the
[27:21] world itself uses purpose. Amen. As a
[27:24] way to drive companies and they they
[27:27] drive uh uh even in the nominal world,
[27:30] they they you've got to have purpose,
[27:32] right? It it's cuz God built you to have
[27:34] purpose. But don't never mix up your
[27:37] purpose, personal purpose
[27:40] &gt;&gt; with God's purpose.
[27:42] Now, God's purpose, many you hear them,
[27:45] God's got a purpose. God's got a
[27:46] purpose. Once a while, I stop and go,
[27:48] well, you know, I wish they'd tell us
[27:49] what his purpose is.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; But, but we've got a message where it
[27:54] tells you the purpose of God.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Now, in Colossians 1, brother, remember,
[27:59] brother reads it and he said, "Christ in
[28:01] you, the hope of glory." That's the
[28:03] purpose of God. And brother breaks it
[28:06] into a three-fold revelation. He said,
[28:08] watch this. The first purpose is for God
[28:10] to reveal himself so that that
[28:13] revelation can get in a body and become
[28:16] perminent and then that preeminent
[28:18] revelation will carry a body of people
[28:20] back to the garden of Eden.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; So the first thing he had to do is
[28:24] reveal that in Christ Jesus. And when
[28:26] the revelation come into Christ Jesus,
[28:28] now that that God poured into Christ is
[28:31] poured into the church. Amen. So God's
[28:34] purpose is he he sends a message to
[28:36] declare that. He sends a word to declare
[28:39] that and God has invited you into that
[28:41] purpose. See, you are the claimed body
[28:44] of Jesus Christ. Now if if we could to
[28:47] be aware this morning that God before
[28:49] the foundations of the world and called
[28:52] you and anointed you for this section of
[28:54] life, then then you could recognize that
[28:57] you are predestinated. You're called.
[28:59] And because you're called, you're
[29:01] already glorified. How many knows that
[29:03] that you're already glorified? How many
[29:05] knows that you're already glor It's the
[29:07] Bible. You're already glorified. Now,
[29:09] now with that state of mind, you are
[29:12] prepared to meet anything that Satan
[29:15] would throw at you.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter what comes at you,
[29:19] you are now prepared to face that. And
[29:22] know this coming at me has nothing to do
[29:25] with whether God loves me or not.
[29:28] It has nothing to do with whether I'm
[29:30] loved of God or whether I'm a good
[29:31] Christian or a bad Christian. But
[29:33] because my Bible said they that live
[29:35] godly in Christ shall suffer
[29:37] persecutions. Amen. The Bible said many
[29:40] are the afflictions of the righteous,
[29:42] but God shall deliver them from them
[29:44] all. So afflictions and troubles and
[29:46] situations has nothing to do with the
[29:49] idea I'm called or uncalled. Come on,
[29:51] y'all know I'm in the message. Cloudy
[29:53] days are not a sign of God's
[29:55] disapproval. And sunny days are not a
[29:58] sign of his approval. He loves you
[30:00] because he said he loves you. He said
[30:02] it. I believe it. And I'll stand on it.
[30:05] In the midst of my troubles, in the
[30:07] midst of my cloudy days, I'll be saying
[30:10] Jesus loves me. Yes, I know because the
[30:13] Bible told me so.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I I've been around a
[30:20] minute. I know how dominating and
[30:22] manipulative demon spirits are.
[30:25] They want you to do something, you have
[30:26] trouble, and all of a sudden that's
[30:28] God's judgment till you do what I want
[30:29] you to do.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; It was a real revelation to me, brother
[30:33] Mike, if you're part of a certain group
[30:35] and you have a real tragedy hit you,
[30:38] that's God's trials giving you
[30:40] character. But if you ain't a part of
[30:42] that group and you don't agree with
[30:43] their doctrine, that's God's judgment
[30:45] because you have transgressed the word
[30:47] of God. Isn't it something how men use
[30:49] the word to manipulate the situation
[30:52] they want it to fit? Amen. But I'll tell
[30:54] you this, if you see me going through
[30:56] something, you just say God's working on
[30:58] that boy. He's getting him ready for a
[31:00] millennium because my destination is
[31:02] already set. My ambition is to be a son
[31:05] of God. I didn't show up, Amen, to quit
[31:08] the first time I had trouble. I didn't I
[31:10] didn't show up to sit down the first
[31:12] time that struggles come to my life. But
[31:15] God filled me with the Holy Ghost to get
[31:18] me all the way. He sealed me.
[31:21] And when he seals you, the train's going
[31:23] to go through high spots, low spots.
[31:26] It's going to rock back and forth. But
[31:28] brother, if God put a seal on you, it'll
[31:30] hold you through the trial.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; It'll hold you through the struggle.
[31:34] It'll hold you through the problems. I'm
[31:37] going all the way.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; My If I was a singer right now, I'd
[31:42] break out in song. Amen. I'm going
[31:44] through. I'm going through.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; No matter the price or whatever others
[31:50] do.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Well,
[31:58] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; See, in that position, you you you can
[32:01] resist the devil.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; In that position, you can resist the
[32:06] devil.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. If you read this, resist
[32:12] the devil, he'll flee from you. But
[32:13] don't never forget the first part of
[32:14] that.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; There you go, brother.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't it beautiful? Humble thyelves and
[32:23] he will exalt thee.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; See, submit and then resist.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; If you're submitted, you got every right
[32:30] to resist.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; My Bible tells me that if one can make a
[32:34] thousand flee.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; That two can make 10,000 flee.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, when you get the devil
[32:40] on the run, just keep him on the run.
[32:42] Yeah,
[32:44] &gt;&gt; you know, don't take a break.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Keep him moving.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Put some distance between you and that
[32:50] enemy.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, you see, he if
[32:54] you if you start resisting, he won't
[32:56] just walk away. He'll flee.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; See, resist the devil the same way our
[33:02] chief captain told us to do. Take that
[33:05] word and resist the devil.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; See, take that word. Take how you resist
[33:11] the devil is by the word of God. How do
[33:13] I do it, Brother Wayne? By the word of
[33:15] God.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; You can't resist with what you don't
[33:18] know.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; If you don't know that that word spoke
[33:24] for you and gave you, you can't resist
[33:26] with what you don't know.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Well, why do you think the enemy is
[33:30] attacking the word before he attacks
[33:32] you?
[33:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; He knows if he attacks you and you have
[33:37] the word, he's lost his battle. So, he
[33:39] attacks the word, then he attacks you.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God said, "See,
[33:44] we're taught to resist the devil. He
[33:46] will flee from us." Now, resist is to
[33:47] just simply turn him down.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; No matter what he's trying to tell you,
[33:52] you don't even listen to him.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; True.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Your ears are deaf to anything else.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; To he that has an ear
[33:59] &gt;&gt; that listens. See what the spirit saith
[34:02] unto the churches. one that's got the
[34:03] listening post that catches what the
[34:06] spirit says to the churches.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; To he that has an ear. See, because if
[34:10] you can hear it, you can speak it. And
[34:11] how many remembers several years ago, I
[34:13] actually preached a whole sermon on a
[34:15] woman I met down in Arkansas around the
[34:17] 4th of July, actually. And she was in
[34:19] Carl'sbad, New Mexico, and she was
[34:21] telling me, she found out I believe
[34:22] Brother Brand was a prophet, and she
[34:23] started testifying. She said, "I was in
[34:25] a meeting in Carl'sbad." And one of our
[34:27] neighbors, who was about a 18-year-old
[34:28] girl, was in the meeting and said she
[34:30] had never heard in her life. She was
[34:32] completely deaf and mute. And she come
[34:34] up in the prayer line, Brother Brandham
[34:35] prayed for her and said her ears come
[34:37] open. And he said when when when when
[34:39] the ears come open, the reason we all
[34:41] knew it was he says, "Brother Brandham
[34:43] whispered in her ear but put a mic in
[34:45] front of her mouth." And said when
[34:47] brother Bram would say he he would say
[34:49] uh he said say mama. And he says when
[34:52] brother Bram whispered mama said she
[34:54] spoke mama in the mic. Amen. Because if
[34:57] you can hear it, you can say it. See you
[35:00] if you if you're not hearing good,
[35:01] you're not saying good.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan tries to twist how
[35:05] you're hearing. See? But if you can hear
[35:07] it, you can say it. Now, to he that hath
[35:10] an ear, let him hear what the spirit
[35:13] says. Amen. Then that's why the prophet
[35:15] said, "See that bride will speak the
[35:18] same word that he speaks." You You see
[35:20] the prophet, the bride, Amen. And the
[35:23] spirit will be speaking the same thing.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; And what they said would have already
[35:27] been in the Bible. See, the spirit gives
[35:29] the word. And if you have the spirit,
[35:31] you'll hear the word for your age. And
[35:33] true Christians took the word for their
[35:35] age. Amen. What is it? That word becomes
[35:37] the inspiration of the church.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; It becomes uh the leadership of the
[35:42] church. Let me just say, Amen. Uh you
[35:45] you you say, "Well, brother Wayne, why
[35:46] do you do it the way you do it?" It's
[35:48] because I was inspired from the message
[35:50] to believe a certain way on something.
[35:52] Right. Yeah.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; So the inspiration, see some people get
[35:55] their inspirations from different
[35:56] places. Our inspiration comes from the
[35:59] message of the hour. So it inspires us
[36:02] to believe a certain way, to think a
[36:03] certain way, to do a certain way. Amen.
[36:05] And and I believe personally very
[36:08] clearly that this is the mind of Christ.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we have received the
[36:14] mind of Christ. I I don't think that the
[36:16] message of the hour was just a fleshly
[36:18] mind of a man William Brandom. Amen. But
[36:21] I certainly believe it was the mind of
[36:23] Christ who brought pre-incarnate
[36:26] knowledge into a preacher and he would
[36:29] stand there and tell you about things
[36:30] that n amen I don't want to preach too
[36:32] long in it but it's beautiful in the
[36:34] beginning God created the heavens and
[36:35] earth. You going listen to brother Bam.
[36:37] He said now before that
[36:40] [Music]
[36:40] [Applause]
[36:41] &gt;&gt; in the beginning God then now now before
[36:44] that
[36:45] &gt;&gt; come on who had that kind of knowledge.
[36:47] It wasn't that eighth grade education
[36:49] William Brandham that Kuckian that
[36:51] couldn't say pullpit correctly. It was
[36:53] that dynamic gift that God placed into
[36:56] him that would allow him amen to operate
[36:59] under the inspiration what he
[37:00] surrendered to was the son of man. And
[37:03] the son of man that was there when
[37:05] heavens was created and told us the
[37:07] story stood there in the platform and
[37:10] told you what he was doing and how he
[37:12] did it and while he did it. And then I I
[37:14] love how Paul said it. Let this mind be
[37:16] in you that was also in Christ Jesus.
[37:19] Then let this mind let the let the
[37:21] intention, the ambition, let the
[37:23] thought, let the will, let the thing
[37:25] that God has, let it be in you which was
[37:28] also in Christ Jesus. Because see,
[37:30] you've been called for greater things.
[37:32] You've been called into greater
[37:34] situations. Now, now one thing we can't
[37:36] control uh you know, at least uh at
[37:39] least in a majority, we can't control
[37:41] what happens to us.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. That's right.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Uh you know, I I wish that I could put
[37:46] you in a place where we could control
[37:48] Amen. how people talk with you and how
[37:51] they I'm sorry. It's just if you're in
[37:53] in this human world, somebody's going to
[37:56] hurt your feelings. Somebody's going to
[37:57] say something. Somebody's going to do
[37:58] something. If you're uh if you're in a
[38:00] city, you might get robbed. You you you
[38:02] know, you might get shot. You you know,
[38:04] all kinds of things going to happen to
[38:06] you. Somebody's going to run over your
[38:07] car. Somebody Amen. And you know, so
[38:10] some things are outside of your control
[38:14] &gt;&gt; and that's what happens. So you you you
[38:17] don't really have the choice on that
[38:19] side. See, but the what belongs to us is
[38:22] the choice of our response
[38:25] &gt;&gt; or what our attitude is according to it.
[38:28] And and I I think it's a beautiful
[38:29] title. Chuck Swindoll wrote a book that
[38:31] I haven't read. Uh but I like this
[38:33] title. Amen. 10% what happens to us and
[38:36] 90% of how we respond. 10% of our lives.
[38:40] Good title. Amen. 10% I don't know
[38:42] what's in the book, but good title.
[38:44] Amen. 10% of of of our life is is is is
[38:48] what happens to us. Amen. But 90% is how
[38:50] we respond to it. It's a true statement,
[38:52] folks. Amen. The same thing can happen
[38:55] to two different people and it destroys
[38:58] one person and builds another. It's
[39:00] because of the attitude that you take.
[39:03] Whether it's an attitude of success and
[39:05] spiritual growth or whether it's an
[39:07] attitude of self-pity and and self-envy
[39:10] and and you know uh poor little me.
[39:13] Amen. But you know, you'll never get
[39:15] anywhere with that attitude because that
[39:17] attitude is an attitude where you think
[39:19] too much of yourself. You know, I think
[39:22] the the humility, one of the great
[39:24] definitions of humility is not think
[39:26] less. Don't don't don't think uh less of
[39:28] yourself, just think of yourself less.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're going to somebody's
[39:35] wedding and you're attending the wedding
[39:36] and something happens in that wedding,
[39:38] something's off a little bit, I want you
[39:40] to know it's not about you.
[39:43] Yeah.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; If you're attending this church and a
[39:46] little something happens and and you you
[39:48] think, "Well, they started a little late
[39:49] or Ben saying that." That's not about
[39:51] you.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Not not everything that
[39:55] happens all the time is about you. But
[39:58] if you think less of your, you know,
[40:00] think of yourself less of the time,
[40:02] you're more worried how that affected
[40:04] your friend or how that affected someone
[40:06] or how
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's the truth. because it
[40:12] gets to dealing with the attitude and
[40:14] attitude of gratitude. I I like these
[40:17] little sayings. Attitude of gratitude.
[40:18] That's what we're looking for.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; We're looking for thankfulness. You
[40:22] know, instead of wearing that the bench
[40:23] is a little hard. Thank God you got one.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; I just got a I just got some some stuff
[40:30] back from Uganda. Amen. You ought to see
[40:32] some of them places that people are
[40:33] worshiping and they God bless us.
[40:36] They're not coming for two-hour
[40:37] services. They want two hours to get
[40:39] there. Amen. Ain't three Ain't three
[40:42] cars in the parking lot. Amen. And 300
[40:44] people in the church, you know, dirt
[40:46] floors and and and hard benches and
[40:48] Amen. and bad sound. Amen. But people
[40:50] are full of joy and loving the message
[40:53] of the hour. Now, that's not a bad
[40:54] America, good Africa. It's but it but it
[40:56] but it's a disposition of Amen. We will
[40:59] not allow the circumstance to take the
[41:02] joy of our praise and and how we enjoy
[41:04] the things of God, you know. Amen. There
[41:06] could be better sound. There could be
[41:08] better music. There there always could
[41:10] be better. But is better always better?
[41:15] &gt;&gt; It's better always better. Sometimes you
[41:17] need to just not think so much of the
[41:19] perfect note and think about the
[41:21] inspiration that's in the song. Think
[41:23] about the power of God. Amen. I've heard
[41:25] people that wasn't very good singers at
[41:27] all but start singing with all their
[41:29] heart and the anointing starts moving in
[41:32] the power of God. Amen. That's our
[41:34] ambition. Get the Holy Ghost in the
[41:37] church
[41:38] &gt;&gt; where the power of God can become. And
[41:40] I'll tell you how to do it. Just go to
[41:41] thanking God. You go to thanking God and
[41:44] gratitude for what he's done.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know this probably not some
[41:50] immaculate. I've been to the Basilica
[41:52] Chapel and we've seen Rome and we've
[41:54] seen their the money they spent on it
[41:56] and to to those kinds of things. Amen.
[41:59] This is not a very beautiful sanctuary.
[42:01] But to me,
[42:02] &gt;&gt; come on. What makes it beautiful is your
[42:05] your belief in this end time message.
[42:07] What makes it beautiful is the way these
[42:09] young women dress and the way these
[42:11] young men act. And what makes it
[42:12] beautiful is the response to the word of
[42:15] God. What makes it beautiful is when
[42:17] you're walking down that aisle as a
[42:19] preacher and you're stepping into a room
[42:20] and it's shaken with the power of the
[42:23] Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Give me the
[42:25] glory of God. Let me see the presence of
[42:28] God. That's what's beautiful to me.
[42:32] That's real beauty when it lasts. See,
[42:35] gratitude, it'll it'll bring it to you.
[42:37] Get a thankful heart. You get a thankful
[42:39] spirit and it'll change everything in
[42:42] your life.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; It'll change your home life. It'll
[42:45] change your church life.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; It'll change everything. If you could
[42:48] just start thanking the Lord.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Just start thanking the
[42:54] Lord. You know, I I know when you start
[42:56] praising God, Amen. things start
[42:58] happening. Now, now I I I asserted this
[43:01] little thought last week, and I I just
[43:02] wanted to revisit just to put it back in
[43:04] your mind as we travel through this
[43:06] thought. But in the book of Numbers, we
[43:08] found people who had come out under the
[43:10] pillar of fire under Moses. They they
[43:12] they were eating angel food,
[43:15] &gt;&gt; murmuring,
[43:18] com man, the the mana was coming out of
[43:21] the heavens.
[43:26] The prophet was there with a pillar of
[43:28] fire.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; And they were complaining.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Hey man, people don't change.
[43:37] [Music]
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Nah, people don't change.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; It's human.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; And the quicker you recognize that it's
[43:46] human and you're human,
[43:49] &gt;&gt; then you recognize it's something you
[43:50] better guard against
[43:52] &gt;&gt; because it comes to the human being.
[43:54] Wow.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; The human leans negative naturally.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; But there is a supernatural birth in a
[44:00] believer
[44:01] &gt;&gt; that gives them faith sight where they
[44:03] can see the good in things. They can see
[44:04] the good in people and they can begin to
[44:06] get gratitude and they begin to thank
[44:08] the Lord for what it was. You know it
[44:10] was the secret behind Paul and Silas.
[44:12] And Amen. Brother A. Paul and Silas were
[44:14] singing them songs of praise when they
[44:17] were in jail. They were doing it.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; They were in a prison not like this
[44:21] prisons we got. you know, prison rights
[44:23] and television time and air conditioned
[44:25] and he No, no. Amen. They they were in
[44:29] prison like real prison. Amen. Where
[44:30] they were being starved and beaten and
[44:32] chained to a soldier. Amen. I I say
[44:35] this, they could sing because it was not
[44:38] coming from the condition or the
[44:40] situation. It was coming from who they
[44:42] were with God.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Real joy. Amen. Real joy comes from the
[44:47] Lord.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord is our strength. Do you see the
[44:51] joy of the Lord? It becomes strength in
[44:53] the believer and real joy comes from
[44:56] him.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. I believe I believe
[44:59] uh I believe it's your attitude.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's your choice.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to turn and look. Somebody
[45:08] say, "Your choice."
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Your choice.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; It's your choice.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; It's your attitude.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; It's your choice.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see your attitude will
[45:19] determine your destination?
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Your attitude toward this service. So
[45:23] you'll either leave here and say, "Oh,
[45:25] this was a wonderful service." Or, "I
[45:26] think Brother Wayne was after me this
[45:28] morning. What do you think?"
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Your attitude will be, "That's one of
[45:33] the best song services I was in in
[45:35] prayer." Or your attitude will be, "I
[45:37] think Ben's a little carried away
[45:38] sometimes, don't you?"
[45:40] &gt;&gt; No, I really don't. I kind of enjoy it.
[45:42] Amen. Turn it up, Ben. Amen. You you see
[45:46] I I I certainly believe in giving praise
[45:48] and thanksgiving and honor. Amen. I I
[45:51] don't know. Sometimes we ought to just
[45:52] have a thanks service. We ought to just
[45:54] get together and the whole service be
[45:56] thank you Jesus and and just thank you
[45:58] the Lord and and just go down the
[46:00] aisles. Amen. Have you got anything to
[46:02] thank him for? Amen. Brother Dallas, I
[46:04] know Sister Barb's having struggles this
[46:06] morning, but we thank the Lord there's a
[46:08] there's a hospital and she's got a
[46:10] loving husband and there's a Lord Jesus
[46:12] that thanks and cares about her. Amen.
[46:14] Thank the Lord. Amen. That you got
[46:16] wonderful sons and they're saved and
[46:18] full of the Holy Ghost. And and then
[46:20] thank you things to thank him for. Amen.
[46:22] I know some of y'all I could take the
[46:24] whole service myself. Amen. But let me
[46:26] give a little time to Aiden. Amen. Let
[46:28] me think about what he's got to thankful
[46:30] God for this morning. You we're
[46:32] discussing it one morning and and and
[46:34] we're discussing what God's done for him
[46:35] and blessed him. We're talking about
[46:36] brother uh Dalton and we're talking
[46:39] about Hattie Wright and all this and and
[46:40] and I finally looked at him. I said,
[46:42] "But brother Aiden, you realize God's
[46:43] done the same thing for you that he done
[46:46] for them."
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet's not even here,
[46:49] but your attitude toward the message
[46:52] give your children to you.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Attitude, the right
[46:57] attitude, the right mental attitude, it
[47:00] could change everything about your life.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; My you start just praising him and
[47:06] thanking him. I tell you that old heavy
[47:08] feeling will start lifting. You ever you
[47:10] ever go in a service were just heavy? I
[47:13] preached in services that were heavy and
[47:15] I say, "Lord, I borrow brother Race.
[47:18] Help the people." Amen. Amen.
[47:22] I've come out and look around gosh,
[47:24] y'all scaring me.
[47:28] You know, but but the way to lift that,
[47:30] just start thanking the Lord.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; I know the devil tried to take my
[47:34] service, but I'm going to thank the
[47:36] Lord. I know the devil tried to put some
[47:38] heaviness in my mind, but I'm going to
[47:39] thank the Lord. Somebody took my seat,
[47:41] but I'm going to thank the Lord. Well,
[47:44] that's relative in this church, ain't
[47:45] it? Amen. Somebody took my seat, but I'm
[47:47] going to I'm going to shout so loud.
[47:49] Amen. Amen. There somebody next week's
[47:51] going to want to sit where I sit cuz
[47:53] wherever I sit, the glory of God's
[47:55] fallen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; I say, "Let the glory fall." I say, "Let
[47:59] the praises go up." I say let us thank
[48:01] the Lord for his mercy, for his truth,
[48:04] for the faith in my heart, for the
[48:06] blessings in my life. And I want to
[48:09] thank the Lord for healing us, for
[48:12] touching us. And I don't want it one
[48:14] service. I want some more tomorrow. And
[48:17] I want some more next week.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; It's an attitude of gratitude. Amen.
[48:23] It's a It's a thanks.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. I don't mean to sound uh
[48:28] wrong, but I remember being in India one
[48:30] time and I was walking along and I was
[48:32] just on the street. I was minding my own
[48:34] business and there was a little little
[48:35] little kid come up and they were maybe
[48:37] 10 or something and they were begging
[48:39] and I could see over there that somebody
[48:41] had them doing it, you know, but they
[48:43] they they had a little kid doing it and
[48:44] little kid rubbing his belly and putting
[48:46] it out like that and and you know, you
[48:48] know when sincerity and then when it's a
[48:50] put on, you know.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; But I didn't have a lot of money in my
[48:53] pocket actually. It was at the hotel.
[48:55] So, I reached in there and I had some
[48:57] coins and I just took what I had in my
[48:59] pocket and put it in the hand of that
[49:00] little kid. And that little kid looked
[49:02] at me and went, "Huh?"
[49:06] I reached down and got it, put back my
[49:08] pocket, just kept walking.
[49:13] You got to have some gratitude.
[49:18] Turn that change into money.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Get some Get some Get some Get some
[49:23] attitude.
[49:25] Your attitude's going to determine
[49:26] whether you give up or grow up.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Either you're going to give up or you're
[49:32] going to grow up. Amen. That that
[49:34] situations and things that face your
[49:36] life is going to force something out of
[49:38] you and you got give up or you got grow
[49:40] up. Is there more in you? Has God put
[49:43] you in the right place? Can you Amen.
[49:45] Listen, I tell you, if you get any kind
[49:47] of a a position of life and and you're
[49:50] leading or you're doing something, Amen.
[49:52] you're going to have to do something.
[49:53] And you're going to have to figure it
[49:54] out. I'm be grow I'm giving up
[49:57] &gt;&gt; or I'm growing up.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; I got a couple more. Can we preach?
[50:05] &gt;&gt; You're either going to get better or
[50:07] you're going to get bitter.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; How y'all like them says?
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Stayed up all night for them. You're
[50:13] going to get bitter or you're going to
[50:15] get better. Say, boy, this happened to
[50:17] me. This happened to our church. This
[50:20] happened to my ministry. This happened
[50:22] to this. Have you ever heard the life
[50:23] story of William Brandham?
[50:27] &gt;&gt; You ain't got no excuses.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; All your excuses have just been taken
[50:33] away. Come on, church. You're going to
[50:36] get bitter or you're going to get
[50:37] better. Either you're going to bitter up
[50:40] and stay mad and spew out bitterness and
[50:42] people going to walk by you and you're
[50:44] going to, you know, the thing I I'm old
[50:47] hillbilly and brother hires. There's
[50:48] something I found out years ago. Amen.
[50:50] that a skunk can't spray one person in a
[50:53] room.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; You get all bittered up and start
[51:00] spraying that out against somebody in a
[51:02] room full of people. You can't hit just
[51:04] the person you're talking to. That hits
[51:06] those babies in the floor and it hits
[51:08] the wife in the kitchen. It hits the
[51:10] whole family. Amen. And then that
[51:12] bitterness starts smelling.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's good stuff, preacher. I think
[51:17] I'll preach. Amen. That old bitterness
[51:19] will be there. Or you could get better.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; You could get better at ignoring things.
[51:25] You could get better at shutting your
[51:27] eyes at some things. Come on, church.
[51:29] You could get better. You could be
[51:31] better at it. I could be better at it.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the power to look away.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; I seen so and so the other day and they
[51:41] was going in that video store.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; I can't wait to have a prayer request
[51:45] next week.
[51:49] You know what brother Brandham said?
[51:51] Don't you tell one person that.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; He said you go and pray for that person.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You're sitting in a house full of people
[52:00] and so I don't man I guess the preacher
[52:01] showed up. You you you're sitting in a
[52:03] house full of people and somebody comes
[52:04] up says so and so. And
[52:07] you know what brother Brandham said?
[52:09] &gt;&gt; He said the moment that you believe that
[52:11] bad stuff about your brother,
[52:13] &gt;&gt; you have marred your experience with
[52:16] Jesus Christ.
[52:19] I don't want marred.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Keep it to yourself.
[52:25] [Music]
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Bitter
[52:28] &gt;&gt; or better.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Getting better hurts.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Getting better hurts. Getting better
[52:35] causes you to exercise places of
[52:37] weakness and suffering and pain. Listen,
[52:39] I've always been amazed at our Lord
[52:41] Jesus because he's the only man that was
[52:44] ever right
[52:46] &gt;&gt; and he took the wrong.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; He was the only man ever right and he
[52:52] took the wrong.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Look what he done when he was hanging on
[52:55] Calvary. They offered him bitter and go.
[52:57] How many ever studied that? It was a
[52:59] weed that was an anesthetic that helps
[53:02] you deal with the pain.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; It's a bitter herb that helps you deal
[53:06] with the pain. So when somebody hurts
[53:08] you, I tell you the best way to deal
[53:09] with it, just get bitter. Cuz if you get
[53:12] bitter, you get calloused and then you
[53:13] don't care.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; But the thing is, you can't numb your
[53:17] feelings without numbing your feelings
[53:19] for everything else. People come and sit
[53:21] in a church and they get bitter about
[53:23] something and the next thing you know,
[53:25] God could drop an atomic Holy Ghost
[53:28] atmosphere power and they're completely
[53:30] unmoved. Yeah,
[53:32] &gt;&gt; they could watch a kid die on the floor
[53:34] and have no feelings because they become
[53:36] so numbed because of the bitterness
[53:39] that's coming to them because to deal
[53:41] with it would hurt.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said he for Jesus actually
[53:45] spit out the bitterness,
[53:49] &gt;&gt; spread his arms and opened his heart
[53:53] &gt;&gt; for somebody to pierce it.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And then when he cried out under
[53:57] inspiration, he said, "Father, forgive
[53:58] them. They don't know what they do."
[54:01] I'll tell you, that's the kind of better
[54:02] I want to be. I won't be the kind of
[54:04] better that I can deal with my bitter
[54:06] hurts and my failures and throw up my
[54:09] harms. Listen, I won't quit loving just
[54:11] cuz I got hurt. I won't quit preaching
[54:14] because I got discouraged. I won't quit
[54:17] because somebody
[54:20] [Music]
[54:22] &gt;&gt; I didn't start this race to quit.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; I didn't sell out. Amen. To just pack up
[54:27] and leave. But I come to finish the
[54:30] race. And and and whether it comes Amen.
[54:33] No matter the struggles that come, we're
[54:35] going to finish because God's anointed
[54:36] us. Amen. Amen. You got to either get
[54:40] bitter or get better.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody shout it with me. Bitter or
[54:43] better.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Bitter or better.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; What you going to do?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Tell somebody, I'm getting better.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I'm getting better.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; I'm getting better with handling
[54:51] people's problems. I'm getting better
[54:53] with the complaints against me. I'm
[54:55] getting better with criticism.
[54:57] Yes, sir.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Your attitude will determine on whether
[55:02] you complain or conquer.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; You're not going to do both, folks.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; When you start complaining, you're
[55:12] bringing the trouble higher.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, it gets higher and
[55:19] higher and higher. Complain or conquer.
[55:22] I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm
[55:23] going to conquer.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit on the inside of me
[55:27] is a conqueror.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Not just a conqueror, but more than a
[55:30] conqueror.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I got one more for you.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Victim
[55:36] &gt;&gt; or overcomer?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Victim or overcomer? Where you at this
[55:42] morning? Are you a victim or are you an
[55:45] overcomer?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to say that I've never
[55:49] heard someone talk about how they're
[55:51] victims.
[55:54] I would love to say that, but I'd be
[55:56] lying straight up.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And you know, the problem with with a
[56:01] victim is anytime you try to help them
[56:04] out of it, they think you're on the
[56:06] other person's side.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Yeah.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; When someone has been uh hurt or they've
[56:13] been victim and and they come to you and
[56:15] they're telling you all about it, I
[56:18] don't think they really want uh help out
[56:21] of the pit because you know what I mean?
[56:24] I so dumbily think they come to me for
[56:26] help. So then I try to help.
[56:30] You know, I I'll say something like, you
[56:32] know, well maybe that brother when he
[56:35] didn't shake your hand didn't see you.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; It's possible.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe when that guy looked at you so
[56:49] sternly,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; he just got a phone call from the other
[56:52] side of the country
[56:54] &gt;&gt; and some little family was being torn
[56:56] apart
[56:57] &gt;&gt; and he had him on his heart and he was
[56:58] praying for them and when you looked at
[57:00] him, he was so stern and you left the
[57:02] room thinking, "For sure."
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; See what it is is a victim is always a
[57:07] victim. Yeah.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; They're the victim in every story.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I promise you. Amen. If it's a
[57:17] business situation and you start talking
[57:19] to them, it don't matter what actually
[57:21] happened, they're the victim.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; If it's a if it's a car deal, they're
[57:26] the victim.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; If it's a family problem, they're the
[57:29] victim.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Because the mentality or the attitude is
[57:35] what is making you a victim. Yes, sir.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I've kind of got I kind of get I kind of
[57:45] chuckle at people, you know, sometimes
[57:47] uh sometimes uh men will take certain
[57:49] directions, you know, uh
[57:53] sometimes uh maybe maybe a ministry,
[57:55] they'll they'll set out and attack a
[57:57] church, you know, they'll attack and
[57:58] attack and attack and then a church will
[58:00] just defend themselves with the word and
[58:02] said, "Well, we do it because of this
[58:03] and this and this." And then next week
[58:04] you talk to them and they're a victim.
[58:06] Oh my.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Well, last week you were the attacker,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; But now you're the victim.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Now, do do you see what that do you see
[58:18] the mentality behind that?
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it's either you become a victim
[58:23] or an overcomer? You know, it's kind of
[58:25] like you met a met a guy one time. I
[58:27] read a story about a guy and he walks
[58:28] into a place and someone offered him a
[58:30] beer and he said, "No, I don't drink."
[58:33] And they said, "Well, why don't you
[58:34] drink?" He said, "Cuz my dad was an
[58:36] alcoholic."
[58:37] And his twin brother walks in the room
[58:40] and and and and somebody said, "Do you
[58:41] want a beer?" He said, "Oh, absolutely."
[58:43] He said, "I drink all the time." He
[58:44] said, "Why is that?" He said, "Cuz my
[58:45] dad was an alcoholic."
[58:50] &gt;&gt; See, you're you're going to have to
[58:52] choose your own attitude.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; See, you can't let it become a family
[58:57] attitude or or this,
[59:00] you know. Hey, man. But the thing is,
[59:02] it's either victim or it's overcomer.
[59:05] You're not going to do that both at the
[59:06] same time.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; But but you can be an overcomer. You can
[59:10] overcome by the word of God. I don't
[59:12] care what's happened in your life. You
[59:14] can overcome this morning because the
[59:16] Bible said to he that overcomemeth what
[59:19] I grant to sit with me in my throne.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Then you can become an overcomer.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what brother Ram
[59:26] said he would do. He said he would get
[59:28] the the atonement on his mind and his
[59:30] attitude toward that atonement actually
[59:32] would become something that would be
[59:34] there. Now attitude, Amen, is is a
[59:37] powerful reality in our lives.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Attitude will make the difference of
[59:42] your home, of your family, of your
[59:44] church. The attitude you take concerning
[59:46] something uh you know um to you that
[59:49] don't uh hasn't heard this uh much about
[59:52] this area, I I'll say this attitude. We
[59:54] think of attitude like in our attitude
[59:57] humanly but attitude also is a word used
[1:00:00] in aerodynamics.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; How many ever heard the word attitude in
[1:00:03] aerodynamics?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Now the law of aerodynamics it's like
[1:00:07] when Paul says that there is a li
[1:00:11] when there's a spirit within me he said
[1:00:13] there's a law and the law of sin and
[1:00:15] death works on my flesh. Right?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; He said but there's another law and
[1:00:19] that's the law of life
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; which supersedes the law of death. So,
[1:00:24] so when you start reading scripture, you
[1:00:26] recognize then multiple laws can exist
[1:00:29] at the same time, but one causes
[1:00:31] dominance over the other. So, the law of
[1:00:33] gravity, it's a real law.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; The law of gravity is real. And when the
[1:00:37] law of gravity is there, Amen. But you
[1:00:39] can break the law of gravity with the
[1:00:41] law of aerodynamics.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Now, there's four different four
[1:00:45] different things that deal with the law
[1:00:47] of aerodynamics. And I I preached on
[1:00:49] this one time, so I don't want to go
[1:00:50] into it different that much, but there
[1:00:52] is lift, of course, and then there's
[1:00:54] weight, and then there's thrust, and
[1:00:55] then there's drag. So there's four laws.
[1:00:58] Amen. Now, those are spiritual laws,
[1:00:59] too, right? Amen. Lift and and weight,
[1:01:02] and thrust, and drag. So, we're talking
[1:01:04] about power. But when you start talking
[1:01:06] about attitude, it's how the plane is
[1:01:09] set up to fly.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Let's just say the plane is flying along
[1:01:13] and there's a big headwind. Now what it
[1:01:15] is is there's a direction of that plane
[1:01:17] is flying maybe west in a certain way.
[1:01:20] Well that plane sets at a certain
[1:01:22] altitude but how the nose is up or the
[1:01:26] nose is down is the attitude of that
[1:01:28] plane. So let's just say you got full
[1:01:30] throttle on and that thing's flying
[1:01:31] really fast and you got your nose down a
[1:01:33] little bit. Then you see you're you're
[1:01:35] changing your drag and you don't have
[1:01:37] any lift to that plane. So it don't fly
[1:01:40] smooth. Right.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; But but as they adjust the head,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; as you adjust the head, it makes a
[1:01:49] difference how you fly.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And one of the I thought this was
[1:01:54] beautiful. I read this last night and it
[1:01:56] said, "Beginning with their first
[1:01:57] lessons, students should memorize and
[1:02:01] understand that attitude plus power
[1:02:03] equals performance."
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's for a pilot. I think that's for a
[1:02:08] Christian. Yeah.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Attitude plus power equals performance.
[1:02:12] You say, "By the way, I'm not performing
[1:02:13] right, but I got the Holy Ghost." Then
[1:02:15] it's the attitude.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; See, then it's it's how you set your
[1:02:21] head
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; of whether or not it's going to be
[1:02:24] there. There's a law that is working and
[1:02:26] it gives the angle. Amen. It gives the
[1:02:28] angle. So, attitude is considered angle.
[1:02:31] Now, I I I Amen. I I don't want to
[1:02:33] educate you, but I think we could
[1:02:34] memorize this. Amen. Attitude, power,
[1:02:37] performance. Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Performance equals your attitude and
[1:02:40] your power. Holy Ghost power
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; with a with a scriptural attitude
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; gives you a super performance.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, the the the actual
[1:02:51] the actual attitude is dealing with what
[1:02:54] they call the angle of attack.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; It's how that you're attacking the
[1:03:00] opposition to get off the ground or it's
[1:03:03] it's called the angle of your attack.
[1:03:05] Now what is the angle of your attack?
[1:03:07] That's your attitude.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; See the opposition is going to be there.
[1:03:12] It don't matter what kind of plane
[1:03:13] you're flying in or I mean there is the
[1:03:16] law of gravity is the same for everyone.
[1:03:18] And every believer sitting here whether
[1:03:20] you're a mature believer, you're a young
[1:03:22] believer just getting started. Then
[1:03:24] there is a law working against you of
[1:03:26] humanity. your your sin and death. Your
[1:03:29] human bodies working out against you and
[1:03:32] things are coming at you constantly.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Constant coming, ain't they?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes your mind feels like an
[1:03:39] airport for the devil's bombs.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; It's just coming. It's just coming. Just
[1:03:43] coming. Just coming. Just coming. Well,
[1:03:45] what the attitude is is the angle that
[1:03:47] you will attack that. And it will matter
[1:03:50] whether it takes out the lift or puts on
[1:03:52] drag. So if it's going to come, change
[1:03:55] your angle that you attack it.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Attack it. Yes. Attack it.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Attack every opposition because Amen.
[1:04:05] You know, it actually helps a plane to
[1:04:08] have a headwind to bring its lift.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. A true sailor sail right into the
[1:04:13] wind.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's how you approach the
[1:04:17] opposition.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly Amen. You know,
[1:04:21] you you take God give you things, but
[1:04:23] it's it's the attitude how we take
[1:04:24] toward it. Uh you take the great
[1:04:26] ministry of Jesus Christ, one man would
[1:04:29] look at it and he would call it the
[1:04:31] devil, and another man would look at it
[1:04:33] and call it God.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; And their angle of attack on the word of
[1:04:37] God made the difference in their
[1:04:38] destination.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; If they took the angle, it's Messiah.
[1:04:42] Look what their blessings. If they took
[1:04:44] the angle, the attitude, it's the devil.
[1:04:46] Look at what followed after. Do you see
[1:04:48] even here uh just in our generations,
[1:04:51] God has done such a wonderful thing. And
[1:04:53] you know, do you have that picture of
[1:04:55] the cloud out there in Arizona? Amen.
[1:04:57] Brother Brandham uh spoke about this.
[1:04:59] It's a beautiful it's a beautiful uh uh
[1:05:01] picture. Amen. And and it means so much
[1:05:04] different to so many different people.
[1:05:06] Uh but I was reading yesterday and
[1:05:08] brother Bam said, "Oh," he said, "I was
[1:05:10] standing there and he said he it was
[1:05:12] there with that white wig and looking
[1:05:14] down towards the earth showing supreme
[1:05:16] authority. Heaven's declared it. The
[1:05:18] Bible declares it. The message declares
[1:05:20] it. Supreme Authority with his white wig
[1:05:23] on. You'll see his black beard to the
[1:05:26] right sideways. Look at it. See, there
[1:05:28] it is. Just as perfect as it was, it had
[1:05:32] been photographed at him. But they were
[1:05:35] looking at it from the wrong angle.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; You got to look at it at the right
[1:05:40] angle.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And the Lord God reveals the right
[1:05:44] angle.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, if you'll turn it to the
[1:05:47] right, amen, it is a perfect picture of
[1:05:50] Christ. But but but if you attack that
[1:05:52] with the wrong angle and you make it
[1:05:55] something that it's not or you take away
[1:05:57] from what it is, Amen. then what you're
[1:05:59] doing is your uh your attitude is
[1:06:01] attacking the things of God.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; See, some people are very zillious and
[1:06:07] they they they playing the game. I
[1:06:08] remember one time years ago, Billy
[1:06:10] Graham was talking about a football
[1:06:11] game. And I don't I'm not a football
[1:06:13] player. Some of you probably in here
[1:06:14] know the famous game he's talking about.
[1:06:15] But he was talking about a famous game
[1:06:17] and he was talking about uh uh the the
[1:06:18] crowd was going crazy. It was like a
[1:06:20] Super Bowl or something, I guess. And he
[1:06:22] said he said uh he said one old boy
[1:06:24] caught it. He said he was running his
[1:06:25] head off. The crowd was screaming. He
[1:06:26] said he thought he was doing the best
[1:06:28] kind of job a man could do. And when he
[1:06:29] got to the field goal, he turned around
[1:06:31] and looked and it was the it was the
[1:06:32] opposing team that was doing the
[1:06:34] cheering.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; He was running the ball the wrong way.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; So it it matters. Amen. You know, so
[1:06:42] somebody's cheering. Well, look who's
[1:06:44] cheering.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Who Who's the one egging it on? See,
[1:06:49] it's the attitude. Amen. That that you
[1:06:51] approach something. When you approach
[1:06:53] the word of God, you have to approach it
[1:06:55] in an attitude. Now, the prophet tells
[1:06:57] us this. If a man catches a vision of
[1:06:59] the invisible and he knows he's present,
[1:07:01] he said it'll stabilize that thinking.
[1:07:04] It'll stabilize actions. It'll stabilize
[1:07:07] a time of distress and trouble. It'll
[1:07:09] make him look upward above things that
[1:07:10] are happening around him because he
[1:07:13] starts looking into the unseen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; You see, when you start seeing the
[1:07:18] unseen, the attitude is the unseen
[1:07:22] realm. That's what you're looking to.
[1:07:24] The unseen realm, I'm believing what I'm
[1:07:26] believing. I'm acting the way I'm
[1:07:27] acting. I have the attitude. I have is
[1:07:30] because I'm not looking at the
[1:07:31] circumstances. I'm not looking at the
[1:07:34] situations. I'm actually looking at the
[1:07:37] unseen promises of God that he has made.
[1:07:40] Now, amen. You say, "Well, preacher,
[1:07:42] what are you talking about?" Maybe
[1:07:43] you're sitting here this morning. You're
[1:07:44] needing a healing. Now, you've got to
[1:07:46] have an an attitude to get to that
[1:07:49] healing.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Healings and miracles are different.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Healings happen over time.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; If you want a healing, Amen. God
[1:07:59] promised you healing,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; God said it is there. Now, Brother Bam
[1:08:04] says, "Now, here's the thing. I would
[1:08:07] like to have an oak acorn tree or an oak
[1:08:09] tree in my front yard, and somebody
[1:08:12] gives you an acron. Now, you've got the
[1:08:14] tree, but it's in seed form,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Now, if you asked me for an oak tree and
[1:08:20] I gave you an acron, now you you might
[1:08:23] not want the acron,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; but this is what you do to get an oak
[1:08:29] tree.
[1:08:30] So my attitude is, well, it wasn't
[1:08:33] exactly what I wanted because it wasn't
[1:08:35] mature, but I'll plant it. And brother
[1:08:37] Bam says, you can't go out there every
[1:08:39] morning and dig that up.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He said, you got to plant it and then
[1:08:42] you got to water it and start letting it
[1:08:43] grow because it's the right mental
[1:08:46] attitude. Somebody say the right mental
[1:08:48] attitude.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude. Brother Ram
[1:08:51] says, see, amen. It's there. You can you
[1:08:54] can praise God as soon as you get that
[1:08:56] acron.
[1:08:58] Come on.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You can start praising God because
[1:09:01] you've got the tree already. See,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; now I'm the Lord that health thee. Just
[1:09:07] start praising.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam is saying the scripture is
[1:09:12] your acron
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; to the tree of your healing.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And if you got the scripture, you can
[1:09:18] quote that scripture and start praising
[1:09:20] the Lord.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't see any results." But
[1:09:24] that don't make any difference. you go
[1:09:27] to it anyhow cuz the word of God is a
[1:09:30] seed and it's sold with incorruptible
[1:09:33] seed. It can't perish. It's
[1:09:34] incorruptible. Amen. Here's a statement
[1:09:37] I usually make in healing services. The
[1:09:39] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:09:41] promise of God will bring it to pass
[1:09:44] because it's a seed.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; That's a Bible. That's right.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Luke 8 and 11, the parable
[1:09:50] is this. The seed is the word of God.
[1:09:54] Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Now, this is fundamentally, see, the
[1:09:57] correct word of God, the Bible, every
[1:09:59] bit of it inspired and all of it is
[1:10:02] God's word. And when you receive the
[1:10:04] word, you have received God.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; In the middle of that thanks service,
[1:10:12] let's have a Bible service just
[1:10:13] remembering what this really is.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it. He says, "If you
[1:10:17] receive the word of God, you have
[1:10:19] received God because that's God's plan."
[1:10:21] Yes, sir. God's motive and God's
[1:10:24] attitude and God's love and God's
[1:10:26] salvation, everything rest in this
[1:10:29] printed word.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And those words are like grains of
[1:10:33] seeds. If you could pick them out and
[1:10:36] swallow them, every one of them would
[1:10:39] produce what it says it would do.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if you go through this
[1:10:44] Bible and you could just pick out, Amen.
[1:10:46] The Bible said he's the Lord that health
[1:10:48] all thy disease. Do you pick that out
[1:10:49] and swallow that?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Then healing is coming from the inside.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Your healing is flowing out of the of
[1:10:58] the very thing that you're eating and
[1:11:00] believing in the word of God. Now, the
[1:11:03] Bible is the word of God. Amen. I I love
[1:11:06] how Brother Bram says it. He says,
[1:11:08] "Watch now." Amen. Uh uh any person, it
[1:11:12] has a right now. And we always get what
[1:11:14] we expect. And when people expect
[1:11:16] something, you usually get what you look
[1:11:18] for. It's a mental attitude that you
[1:11:20] have.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Now remember this and never forget it.
[1:11:24] The right mental attitude towards any
[1:11:26] divine promise will bring it to pass.
[1:11:28] The right mental attitude.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Now, so the prophet is telling us to not
[1:11:33] forget.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Let's have an attitude of remembrance.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; An attitude of remembering the word of
[1:11:40] God. Do you know that you can't quote
[1:11:42] what you don't know?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; True. That's right. That's right.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; You you know it and and I know that
[1:11:49] denominational world goes crazy in this
[1:11:50] about quoting uh you know memorizing
[1:11:52] scriptures and things but the Bible
[1:11:54] says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and forget not all his benefits,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; for he forgiveth all thine iniquity,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; and he health healeth all
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; thine diseases."
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Exodus 15, Jesus, the the
[1:12:13] Moses writes of Jehovah, and he said,
[1:12:15] "For I am the Lord that health thee."
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Now, that's where they take from the
[1:12:22] scripture Jehovah
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Rafa.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa, the Lord our healer. That
[1:12:26] that's actually what Moses spoke of him.
[1:12:29] I am Jehovah Rafa.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; So, it is who he is
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; in Isaiah 53 and5. Now, these are seeds
[1:12:35] to swallow, to eat, to devour, for
[1:12:38] healing.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was wounded for our
[1:12:41] transgressions, Jesus,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; and he was bruised for our iniquity.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And the chastisement of our peace was
[1:12:48] upon him. And with his stripes,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; we are healed.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; In 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 24, and
[1:12:57] whose own self bear our sins in his own
[1:13:01] body, that we being dead to sin should
[1:13:03] live unto righteousness, by whose
[1:13:06] stripes ye are healed. Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, I need I need
[1:13:12] healing this morning. I have just given
[1:13:14] you the seeds of your healing.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I have just spoke to you the seeds of
[1:13:19] your healing." In James chapter 5 and
[1:13:21] verse 15, the prayer of faith shall save
[1:13:24] the sick.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; The prayer of faith shall save the sick.
[1:13:28] Brother Bam said, "There it is." Do you
[1:13:30] see? It's when the impossible becomes
[1:13:32] possible. Abraham took God's word and
[1:13:35] the impossible it was made possible.
[1:13:38] Mary the Virgin took his word and the
[1:13:40] impossible was made possible. I tell you
[1:13:43] this, if anybody can take the word of
[1:13:44] God this morning and this seed falls on
[1:13:47] the right kind of ground, it'll produce
[1:13:49] exactly what it said it would do.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; And you can put it on record and put it
[1:13:55] on tape that the right mental attitude
[1:13:58] towards any divine promise of God will
[1:14:00] bring it to pass. Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; My goodness, when you start hearing a
[1:14:04] prophet say these things that every word
[1:14:06] of God, Jesus said, he said it is a seed
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; and every seed, it is a promise
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and every seed is a promise. Now,
[1:14:17] there's nothing like it. Nothing like
[1:14:19] the word of God because it's a seed and
[1:14:22] it's the seed of healing.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; It's the seed of hope.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; It's the seed of change.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's what you take when
[1:14:32] you're ready to change something.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm I'm a I I I I you know,
[1:14:37] sometimes I don't prepare things well.
[1:14:39] Sometimes things just come up in
[1:14:40] inspiration, you know, uh as you're
[1:14:43] preaching along, but I do while we're
[1:14:45] talking this way, I I want to take a
[1:14:47] moment and thank our medical staff
[1:14:49] that's here in the church.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; How about you?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; You want to say, God, thank you for
[1:14:55] having these kind of people.
[1:14:58] We got doctors, we got nurses, we got
[1:15:02] firemen, first aid men, ambulances, we
[1:15:05] got every every kind of of medical uh
[1:15:08] thing. Now, now listen, let me let me
[1:15:10] just say this as we're moving along. Uh
[1:15:12] I was listening to brother Brandham some
[1:15:14] time ago and he said when he went to
[1:15:16] Africa, he said the Christian science
[1:15:18] had got there in front of him and had
[1:15:21] the medical doctors refusing divine
[1:15:23] healing. He said it was because of the
[1:15:26] way they were teaching it.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Do you see? They were teaching that
[1:15:30] going to a doctor was a bad thing.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And because they were teaching it that
[1:15:34] way, Amen. they were making it a uh they
[1:15:37] were making it an error.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; But when Brother Brandham started
[1:15:41] teaching divine healing according to
[1:15:42] scripture, the doctors started getting
[1:15:44] the ambulances and sending their
[1:15:46] patients down to the down to the to the
[1:15:48] meeting. I talked to one of the
[1:15:50] ambulance drivers. They said, "We took
[1:15:51] them and didn't bring them back." Yeah.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; The doctors were prescribing that
[1:15:57] meeting for their healing because not
[1:15:59] all doctors are are atheist.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; But when you get a thought on you that
[1:16:10] going to the doctor is wrong,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that from the message.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. No, that's right.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; You did not get that from the message of
[1:16:22] William Brandon.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; He went to the Cleveland Clinic. He took
[1:16:26] his wife to the do.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, give me some help in here.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that out of the message.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Now, some people feel it's more
[1:16:42] spiritual if it's a home remedy.
[1:16:51] It ain't more spiritual.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; If it's divine healing, it's divine
[1:16:56] healing.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And whether you go to the best doctor on
[1:17:00] the planet or some witch doctor with
[1:17:01] their uh hoodoo medicine,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; if you get healed, the hoodoo person
[1:17:06] didn't heal you and the doctor didn't
[1:17:08] heal you. He said, "I am the Lord that
[1:17:10] healeth all."
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Healeth all.
[1:17:18] It's the truth.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You You know, you know, it's it's kind
[1:17:22] of a funny thing cuz cuz we qualifi we
[1:17:24] qualify that stuff. Lord, you get me in
[1:17:26] all kinds of trouble. We we qualify that
[1:17:29] kind of stuff. You know, it's the truth.
[1:17:30] It's honestly true, you know. And I was
[1:17:32] listen to a tape one day and I I come
[1:17:34] from early in my in my ministry. I
[1:17:37] probably lean toward the anti-docctor
[1:17:39] side a bit,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; but I was in my 20s.
[1:17:45] I hadn't needed a doctor at all.
[1:17:51] Funny thing is there's a Oh gosh,
[1:17:54] there's a there's a a preacher down
[1:17:56] there in Arkansas, you know, and they're
[1:17:58] not message, but they taught for years
[1:17:59] and years and years and years and years.
[1:18:02] Don't go to the doctor. They let their
[1:18:03] kids suffer, you know, little kids
[1:18:05] suffer and got pneumonia and can't
[1:18:06] barely even breathe and they lay there
[1:18:08] and we believe in healing. We let this
[1:18:10] kid suffer. We believe in healing. And
[1:18:11] then when they get old, Oh,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; and they get sick.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; They go down to the doctor and But you
[1:18:19] wouldn't want me to be in your church. I
[1:18:21] said, "Nuh-uh, buddy. No, sir. No doctor
[1:18:23] for the kid. No doctor for you.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You practice what you preach.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to take a kid to the
[1:18:30] doctor. Don't you dare go to the doctor.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Poor little old thing ain't got a power
[1:18:35] enough take itself and you won't take
[1:18:37] it."
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; That's rough, ain't it?
[1:18:44] Could I preach a minute? So we we walked
[1:18:48] in the back last week. Brother Ray sat
[1:18:50] there. He's such a gentleman. He looks
[1:18:52] he goes, "Well, that was an old Joe
[1:18:55] Olstein sermon."
[1:19:02] You know, the thing the thing is
[1:19:03] honestly though, there's a there is a a
[1:19:06] direction, right?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And the direction is a healing. But all
[1:19:09] these things get attached to divine
[1:19:11] healing. to come against divine healing.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; But you you you by by being it don't
[1:19:18] help it, it hurts it.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; And anything that helps God's people,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; praise God for it.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what it is? Amen. That the
[1:19:28] prophet of God is showing that healing
[1:19:31] is not some weird thing.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; It's not somebody taking a a magic wand
[1:19:36] and waving it over you. And and and if
[1:19:39] we hocus pocus enough, listen, these are
[1:19:41] biblical principles that Jesus died and
[1:19:44] took stripes. And if you'll take that
[1:19:47] seed of truth and you'll stand on that,
[1:19:50] Amen. God, Amen. God healed you already.
[1:19:54] And you got every right to tell the
[1:19:56] devil, "Devil, you get out of here. I
[1:19:58] believe God."
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I I Yeah. Well, can I use this? We
[1:20:08] always so deep, might as well use it.
[1:20:09] Uh, brother brother Ron Spencer and I I
[1:20:11] I have prayed for that man and I know
[1:20:13] you pray for that man and there's been
[1:20:15] so many pray for that man. Amen. But you
[1:20:17] know, I've sat with brother Ron and I
[1:20:19] I've went to church with him and him
[1:20:21] throw up five and six, eight times out
[1:20:23] there at the parking lot and get in the
[1:20:25] car and go to a meeting with me and I
[1:20:26] can show you the meeting
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and you can see him sitting behind me
[1:20:31] and that man sits there and he wasn't
[1:20:33] sitting there with his arm folded.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Right. He was so sick he couldn't move
[1:20:38] his head.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; But he was sitting there and you can
[1:20:41] watch him sitting there going, "Preach,
[1:20:42] Brother Wayne.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Wayne." You know why
[1:20:45] he's doing that? Because his attitude
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; is what I need is in that preaching
[1:20:50] going on right there. And he and brother
[1:20:54] Amen very very clearly. I I I mean I He
[1:20:56] showed me some things. He's talked to me
[1:20:58] privately. He's had preachers call him
[1:21:01] and say he's got cancer because God's
[1:21:03] judging him. He's had preachers call him
[1:21:06] and say, "Because you're taking
[1:21:07] medication, God can't heal you." Listen.
[1:21:10] Listen, folks. Amen. It gets so far out
[1:21:13] there.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I I How many knows what flint is?
[1:21:19] And Indian arrowheads and spearheads and
[1:21:21] knives. There's a there's an old boy
[1:21:23] called Roy Miller. I know that's not a
[1:21:25] popular name over in Amish country, but
[1:21:28] Roy Miller's Roy Miller over there. He
[1:21:30] he dig He's got a farm and he digs off
[1:21:33] of Flint Ridge. He's got some beautiful
[1:21:35] turquoise colored flint. I almost like
[1:21:36] the color of that. I called him the
[1:21:38] other day and I said, "Hey Roy, you got
[1:21:40] any flint?" And he said, "No, Wayne." He
[1:21:41] said, "I didn't get out this year." He
[1:21:43] said, "I got leukemia back in December."
[1:21:45] I said, "Oh man, I'm sorry to hear
[1:21:47] that." And he said, "Yeah." He said, "It
[1:21:49] was the most aggressive kind. They said
[1:21:51] that I had about six months." And he
[1:21:53] said, "But they did say that that that I
[1:21:55] had an option that I could treat it and
[1:21:56] maybe postpone it and you know, we could
[1:21:58] we could kind of break it." And he said,
[1:22:00] "But you know," and man, I felt so bad.
[1:22:02] I started, "Oh, man, I'm so sorry to
[1:22:04] hear that and I'm so sorry you're going
[1:22:05] through this." And he goes, "Oh, no, no,
[1:22:06] no." He said, "It's okay now." He said,
[1:22:08] 'I don't have leukemia anymore.
[1:22:11] Lord,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "You don't." He said, "No." He
[1:22:13] said, "I went to the doctor the other
[1:22:14] day and they said, "Sir, you don't have
[1:22:16] any leukemia at all." And he said,
[1:22:17] "Well," I said, "Well, well, don't it
[1:22:19] just go in remission and then come
[1:22:20] back?" And then they said, "Well, not in
[1:22:22] this case. You just don't have any more
[1:22:24] leukemia in your body." He said, "Mr.
[1:22:26] Lawson, have you ever heard anything
[1:22:27] like that?" that. And I said, "Sir, that
[1:22:29] would take God." He said, "That's
[1:22:31] exactly right." He said, "You know, over
[1:22:34] here in this country," he said, "All
[1:22:35] these Flint guys, they got their
[1:22:37] churches and things, and I went over and
[1:22:38] told all of them I had cancer, and they
[1:22:40] went home and started praying for me."
[1:22:41] He said, "Brother Lawson, it is a
[1:22:43] miracle." Or, "Mr. Lawson, he didn't
[1:22:45] know I was a preacher." He said, "Mr.
[1:22:46] Lawson, it's a miracle." And I said,
[1:22:47] "That's right." You know, that guy ain't
[1:22:49] a part even of the message. It's amen.
[1:22:51] But there's a simple principle, amen,
[1:22:53] that if you could believe, Amen. that
[1:22:55] God, Amen. Faith heals. Faith heals you.
[1:23:00] It's not I'm a good guy or a bad guy. I
[1:23:02] took medicine. I didn't take medicine. I
[1:23:05] go to the doctor. I don't go to the
[1:23:07] doctor. Forget the whole thing. Jesus
[1:23:10] took stripes. And because he took
[1:23:13] stripes, there's a healing this morning.
[1:23:15] And I've got a right to tell every sick
[1:23:18] devil. I've got a right to tell every
[1:23:20] devil of infirmity. You're trespassing
[1:23:23] on God's property. Take your leave,
[1:23:26] devil. I pray the power of a healing
[1:23:29] anointing would flow in this building
[1:23:32] this morning. I tell you, I think Jesus
[1:23:34] raised from the dead, and he said,
[1:23:36] "These signs shall follow them that
[1:23:39] believe.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[1:23:42] They lay their hands on the sick and
[1:23:44] they shall recover."
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "That's the problem we
[1:23:49] got today. We got a lot of runners and
[1:23:50] they're fit runners." He said, "But they
[1:23:52] ain't got a message when they get there.
[1:23:54] They have forgot to message was go tell
[1:23:57] my disciples that he has risen from the
[1:23:59] dead. I want you to know this morning I
[1:24:02] have not forgot what the gospel of Jesus
[1:24:05] Christ is about. He has risen from the
[1:24:08] dead and the healer is still healing and
[1:24:11] the creator is still creating. He still
[1:24:14] remains to be God this morning. We are
[1:24:17] not serving some dead idol. We are
[1:24:19] serving the God of Abraham. Christ Jesus
[1:24:23] that is raised up this morning and sits
[1:24:26] in power with all demons under his feet.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; This Holy Ghost Bible seed cannot grow
[1:24:32] in an atmosphere of intellectualism.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Can't do it.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; I do not understand trying to
[1:24:42] intellectualize our churches.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I I cannot personally conceive the idea
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; that we want to make a church like a
[1:24:50] classroom. Right.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Let me take another step.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Are like a morg.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; A morg is for dead people.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; And we most certainly are not dead.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Because he lives, I live.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And because he lives and I live, there's
[1:25:06] something in my heart this morning that
[1:25:08] loves him and wants to worship him.
[1:25:10] Amen. And build an atmosphere that every
[1:25:13] seed of this Bible can start living
[1:25:15] inside this church this morning. I
[1:25:18] believe it. I believe it's an
[1:25:19] atmosphere. I believe it's an atmosphere
[1:25:22] produced by attitude.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; An attitude of faith, an attitude of
[1:25:27] believing. It produces an an atmosphere
[1:25:30] of I believe it and I'll accept it. Now,
[1:25:34] the right attitude, the right attitude
[1:25:37] would make me confess healing
[1:25:39] when when everything in my body says I'm
[1:25:43] sick.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; What's your angle of attack? I'll tell
[1:25:47] you my angle of attack. I'm going to
[1:25:48] take the word of God. And I'm going to
[1:25:50] beat against the enemy whether he's in
[1:25:53] me or somebody else. Whether he's in my
[1:25:55] flesh or your flesh, I will not give up
[1:25:59] the position of the sons of God against
[1:26:01] sickness and infirmities.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; We will not resign.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; We will not retreat.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; We will testify the glories of God and
[1:26:10] we will confess this word and let the
[1:26:12] devil know we believe it.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, I'll tell you
[1:26:17] what they told Brother Bram." said,
[1:26:18] "Well, my faith is weak."
[1:26:21] Brother Bram said, "I wouldn't confess
[1:26:23] it."
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't say it.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here and your faith is
[1:26:28] weak, I'd never let that come out of my
[1:26:30] mouth.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't confess that.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; My faith is weak. I wouldn't confess it.
[1:26:35] Don't you ever let the devil know that.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; The devil is not all knowing.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; He don't know what you're really
[1:26:46] thinking. He is not a discerner of the
[1:26:49] thought and the intent of the heart. And
[1:26:51] he don't know what really you're feeling
[1:26:53] and think until you tell him.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever tell that devil I'm weak.
[1:26:58] Don't you ever tell him that I'm having
[1:27:00] struggles. Don't you let it become
[1:27:01] negative. Keep the positive.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. He can heal cancer. Can't he
[1:27:06] heal it? Let me see that witness. Yes,
[1:27:08] he can heal it. Amen. He can save and he
[1:27:11] can sanctify and he can fill with the
[1:27:13] Holy Ghost. Yes, he can do it.
[1:27:19] So, Brother Wayne, I got weak in faith.
[1:27:20] And I tell you what, I I've I've I've
[1:27:23] done it. I've done what you said do.
[1:27:25] Well, keep doing it.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; It's called perseverance.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; It works.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Keep doing it. It works. Brother Bam
[1:27:34] said, "Say it and keep saying it."
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Sounds Sounds ridiculous, don't it?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; If you accept it on those basis,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; you keep saying it over and over and you
[1:27:49] say it out loud.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; If you're sick in your body, won't you
[1:27:55] start it right now?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; There's an affliction in your life and
[1:28:00] you don't know how to get out of it,
[1:28:01] won't you start saying it right now? I
[1:28:03] am healed.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I am healed. If you accept it on those
[1:28:06] bases, you keep saying it over and over
[1:28:08] and you say it out loud and you say, I'm
[1:28:10] healed. and you say it till you actually
[1:28:13] believe it.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And when you believe it, it's going to
[1:28:16] take place. Don't you ever get a
[1:28:18] negative attitude.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Don't take a negative confession.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; So, preacher, what are you doing? I'm
[1:28:25] preaching you right out of it.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching you right out of your
[1:28:28] sickness.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching you right out of that
[1:28:31] valley you've been living in. I'm
[1:28:32] preaching if you'll take the attitude
[1:28:34] what that man's saying is true, you'll
[1:28:36] leave here on a mountain. You'll rise up
[1:28:39] out of that infirmity. You'll rise up
[1:28:41] out of that depression. You'll rise up
[1:28:43] out of the sin because God ordained you
[1:28:46] to be in that realm of faith and truth
[1:28:49] and to believe it.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; So, brother Wayne, where you get that
[1:28:54] kind of attitude out of the Bible?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; If you want a family attitude, here's
[1:28:59] you one.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I had a sister named Mary and she was 16
[1:29:04] years old.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; And she had never even known a man.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. But the angel of the Lord came
[1:29:10] to her and said that she would bear the
[1:29:12] Messiah, the savior of the earth. And
[1:29:14] when she heard it, she never questioned
[1:29:16] it could happen. She just didn't know
[1:29:18] how it would happen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And she said to him, "How should these
[1:29:21] things be?" And then when the when the
[1:29:24] Lord said to her, "Look, Mary.
[1:29:28] It's not impossible with God."
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; And Mary began to testify, "Be it unto
[1:29:34] me according to thy word." Now, Brother
[1:29:36] Brandon says it. He said, "Mary never
[1:29:38] waited till she felt it."
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; If you're waiting till you feel better,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; you'll never feel better.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; If you ever let the devil know that I'm
[1:29:50] wait I'm waiting till I feel better.
[1:29:52] Brother, he has got 200,000,000
[1:29:55] demons to sick on you.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He can keep he can keep a devil
[1:30:00] pestering you all day, every day, rest
[1:30:02] of your life. early, right?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; But when you want to get better, you you
[1:30:06] take Mary's attitude and with that one
[1:30:07] visible sign, with that one natural
[1:30:10] test, with that one positive affirmation
[1:30:13] outside of the word of God, you take the
[1:30:15] word of God and say, "At thy word, Lord,
[1:30:17] and you begin to worship the Lord and
[1:30:19] praise him." And brother Bram says,
[1:30:21] "See, you don't wait till you can move
[1:30:23] your foot. You don't wait till your arm
[1:30:25] is better. You don't wait till the
[1:30:26] cancer looks like it's gone. You don't
[1:30:28] wait till the heart trouble is better.
[1:30:30] You take the word of God, get a happy
[1:30:33] mental attitude, and start rejoicing.
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm healed.
[1:30:40] [Applause]
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; See, it it's it's the change of
[1:30:46] attitude. That's that's that's sometimes
[1:30:48] what we need.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Things that change it. A man come in
[1:30:51] brother Bram's prayer line. John Ryan
[1:30:53] came in brother Bram's prayer line and
[1:30:54] brother Brandham, he was a Catholic boy
[1:30:56] and brother Bram prophesied over him.
[1:30:57] Said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're
[1:30:58] healed." John John left a blind man went
[1:31:00] and sat down in the congregation
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; and he got up and come right back out in
[1:31:04] the prayer line and he said, "Brother
[1:31:06] Brandon, watch his attitude." Brother
[1:31:07] Brandham, you said I was healed.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. You said you
[1:31:11] believe me,
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I can't see." Brother
[1:31:15] Brandham said, "What's that got to do
[1:31:16] with it?"
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then what can I do?" Brother
[1:31:20] Bam said, "Now watch what it was." He
[1:31:22] said, "I seen right then." He needed
[1:31:24] something to say. He said, "So I said,
[1:31:27] "You go tell everybody you're healed."
[1:31:29] There was not one thing changed on that
[1:31:31] platform other than his confession.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And his confession changed. Brother
[1:31:36] Brandham said he was interrupting the
[1:31:37] meeting and everything, screaming out,
[1:31:38] "I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed."
[1:31:41] And two weeks later,
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; he was sitting on a barber chair when
[1:31:45] his eyes come open. Amen. What was it?
[1:31:48] Because the thing that changed was not
[1:31:50] his eyesight. It was the testimony that
[1:31:52] he was healed.
[1:31:55] Yes, sir.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Do you see it's amazing thing when you
[1:31:59] catch the reality that now now I'm
[1:32:02] telling you that about something
[1:32:03] happened in Mary's day. Something that
[1:32:05] happened with John Ryan. But I I I've
[1:32:07] seen that witness of it. Brother Vernon
[1:32:09] sitting right there. Amen. I watched a
[1:32:11] lady Dana Nelson who was suffering with
[1:32:13] a stroke and and and and she came in the
[1:32:16] prayer line on a Sunday morning and we
[1:32:18] watched her get up out of that prayer
[1:32:20] line out of her chair and she walked
[1:32:22] like this to the prayer line all the way
[1:32:25] up there and when she got there I went
[1:32:27] over and anointed with her oil and I
[1:32:29] said, "Sister Dana, what would you like
[1:32:30] prayer for this morning?" She said,
[1:32:31] "Brother Wayne, I've had this stroke and
[1:32:33] it's paralyzed half of me and I want God
[1:32:36] to heal me." And so I said a prayer over
[1:32:38] her, a prayer of faith. And I said,
[1:32:40] "Sister Dena, now you go and you testify
[1:32:42] God's healing power." And she stopped
[1:32:44] and looked up at me and she said,
[1:32:45] "Brother Wayne, my daughter is a nurse."
[1:32:48] And she said, "And when I talk about
[1:32:50] healing like this, she thinks I'm
[1:32:51] crazy." And I said, "Sister Dana, the
[1:32:54] Bible said, "Let every man word be a lie
[1:32:56] that the word of God be true." I said,
[1:32:58] "I don't care if your family likes it."
[1:33:01] No. I said, "They're not the ones
[1:33:02] needing the healing. You're the one
[1:33:04] needs the healing." I said, "So you go
[1:33:06] home and start testifying about that."
[1:33:08] Amen. And you know what? That night she
[1:33:09] comes back and Brother Ray, we've done
[1:33:11] it a bunch, you know, and she comes back
[1:33:12] that night and I get up and come to
[1:33:14] prayer line and she gets up out of her
[1:33:16] seat and she's starting to come down and
[1:33:17] she's walking up there same way she
[1:33:18] came. And when she gets up there, I'm
[1:33:21] thinking in my mind, we prayed for you
[1:33:23] this morning. All I can do is pray for
[1:33:25] you. And when she gets up in the prayer
[1:33:28] line, she looks up at me and I said,
[1:33:29] "What would you like, Sister Dana?" She
[1:33:31] said, "I'd just like to give a
[1:33:32] testimony, Brother Wayne." I said, "What
[1:33:34] about, Sister?" She said, "The Lord
[1:33:35] healed me this morning."
[1:33:37] And when she reached out to take the mic
[1:33:39] I had she reached out with that
[1:33:41] paralyzed arm and took a hold of that
[1:33:43] mic. She didn't get to testify. She went
[1:33:46] to dancing all over the front of that
[1:33:48] building in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:52] because it's true. It works. It's the
[1:33:55] truth. It's not psychology. It's the
[1:33:58] power of the living God. It's a creative
[1:34:02] anointing. You can walk out of that
[1:34:04] perilous this morning.
[1:34:07] You can you can get up out of your
[1:34:09] struggles this morning. The word of God
[1:34:12] said you could.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram left the building one
[1:34:18] morning. Man was laying over on the
[1:34:20] side. Brother Bram was walking out of
[1:34:21] the building and he said, "Everybody in
[1:34:22] the in the sound of my voice will be
[1:34:24] healed this morning." And a man, he was
[1:34:26] laying there on a cot. Brother Bram was
[1:34:28] walking by and he walked by and said,
[1:34:29] "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're healed."
[1:34:30] The guy just kept laying there. One of
[1:34:32] the other people reached over and shook
[1:34:33] him. Said, "Brother, get up from there."
[1:34:35] He said, "You're healed." He said, "I'm
[1:34:37] not healed." He said, "Yeah." He said,
[1:34:38] "Brother Brandham just walked by you."
[1:34:40] You didn't hear him say, "Thus sayaith
[1:34:41] the Lord, you're healed." He said, he
[1:34:43] said that. He said, "Yeah." The fella
[1:34:45] got up and started rejoicing. Amen.
[1:34:47] Amen. Because all he needed to realize
[1:34:49] is it's thus sayaith the Lord. If it's
[1:34:52] in the Bible, church, it's thus sayaith
[1:34:55] the Lord, you can have your healing this
[1:34:58] morning.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You talk about attitudes.
[1:35:06] I want this attitude.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; I want this attitude of of of where the
[1:35:11] Bible brother man preaches in the eagle
[1:35:13] stare at this nest and he said, "Listen
[1:35:15] now." Amen. I I won't be much longer. He
[1:35:17] said, "Listen now. If you ain't got
[1:35:19] enough faith to receive it right now, a
[1:35:21] miracle, then you take a adopted baby
[1:35:25] attitude."
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; That's pretty good, ain't it? Adopted
[1:35:29] baby attitude. Somebody said, "What's an
[1:35:31] adopted baby attitude?" Brother Bram
[1:35:34] says, "It's the attitude towards it."
[1:35:37] See, I've seen Sir Thomas Cancer leave
[1:35:40] people by that same thing. Now, maybe
[1:35:43] you won't be able to receive enough for
[1:35:45] your deliverance all of the sudden.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "But may I say tonight, I want
[1:35:50] you to take a moment. If you can't
[1:35:52] receive enough faith to be healed
[1:35:54] instantly, then you take the adopted
[1:35:57] baby route." Did you ever hear of
[1:35:59] adopting a baby?
[1:36:03] Now, you know th this is a this is a a
[1:36:06] spiritual principle, but it's not just
[1:36:09] spiritual, folks.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; It's a natural principle.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Just a quick Google search gave me
[1:36:15] details of several people, but there was
[1:36:18] a study done here a while back of women
[1:36:21] who were unable to have children
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; that went and adopted children because
[1:36:26] they were unable to have children. and
[1:36:28] had pre-adoption pregnancies of their
[1:36:30] own biologically.
[1:36:32] And out of 388 adoption uh just 388
[1:36:36] study of 388 of them women, 42 of them
[1:36:40] ended up with babies
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; biologically.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that that's almost 10%. And
[1:36:46] we're not even talking about a spiritual
[1:36:47] principle.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; We're talking about just the fact that
[1:36:51] when they adopted a baby, it relaxed
[1:36:54] them enough.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. it it it done something to them
[1:36:58] that they could relax their body and
[1:37:00] receive seed according to the way they
[1:37:03] should. And sometimes we get so we get
[1:37:06] so bent in our mind, we get so we we got
[1:37:08] to make it happen and we got to make it
[1:37:10] happen. Amen. And and and after a while,
[1:37:13] Amen. We we can't make it happen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You can't make it happen. It's not on
[1:37:18] that principle. It's on the principle
[1:37:20] God already did it.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And you adopt your baby. You confess the
[1:37:26] word of God.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to confess the word
[1:37:30] of God, what does it do? That that that
[1:37:32] brother Bram said, "Many times I tell
[1:37:34] people to go on and adopt a baby."
[1:37:37] You're you're needing you're needing a
[1:37:38] baby. He said, "I tell them to go on and
[1:37:39] adopt a baby." He said, "Because then
[1:37:42] they'll have their baby."
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? He's telling you if you
[1:37:46] don't have enough to get your instant
[1:37:48] healing, adopt a baby.
[1:37:52] confess your healing and it will relax
[1:37:55] you enough to let the healing happen in
[1:37:57] your soul.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But if you get if you're so if you're so
[1:38:02] white knuckled and you you
[1:38:04] I'm going to make it happen. You can't
[1:38:06] do it like that.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; It has to be Jesus died for it.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy of it. I could never make
[1:38:15] it happen, but he did it for me and I'm
[1:38:18] accepting his gift. And then when you go
[1:38:20] to praising him for what he did,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; it'll unlock something on the inside and
[1:38:26] it becomes the power of your confession.
[1:38:29] Now your confession is what overcomes
[1:38:31] it.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Your confession
[1:38:34] overcomes it. Your confession is the
[1:38:36] thing that overcame. And they said they
[1:38:38] overcame by the blood of the lamb and
[1:38:41] the word of their testimony. That's it.
[1:38:43] By the blood of the lamb. You cannot
[1:38:45] begin to testify till you really
[1:38:47] understand the blood. Because every time
[1:38:50] you start testifying of something God
[1:38:52] did for you, Satan has something you
[1:38:54] did, said, felt, or did, and he's going
[1:38:57] to put it over your head.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what exploiting a weakness
[1:39:02] means?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; You know what exploiting weakness means?
[1:39:06] exploiting weakness is when is when
[1:39:10] let's let's say there's a home and
[1:39:11] there's trouble comes up in a home and
[1:39:13] sometimes a a man will do something he
[1:39:15] shouldn't do but he's the leader.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; So then when he exposes that weakness
[1:39:21] and then if a sister's not in the right
[1:39:23] attitude sometimes every time he tries
[1:39:26] to lead differently than she wants
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; then she'll exploit the weakness in the
[1:39:32] man so she can take leadership.
[1:39:35] Sure.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I've seen men commit adultery on their
[1:39:43] families and live out in the world. Then
[1:39:44] the sister pray for years. God send my
[1:39:47] husband home. Then he comes home and
[1:39:49] then she don't let him lead,
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; you know. Then then every time he goes
[1:39:55] to spank a child,
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; if she don't like the way he spanks the
[1:39:59] child, then there's a disrespect raising
[1:40:01] up.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; So how do you fix that? Yeah.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; How do you fix that? I'll tell you how
[1:40:06] you fix it. Humility.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; You have to go to a place that you
[1:40:11] humbly repent of your wrongs.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; If you've done something wrong, acted
[1:40:15] wrong, felt wrong, don't just expect
[1:40:18] somebody to get over it.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching now.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Because you can make your choice. You
[1:40:26] can't choose the consequence.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; If you do something, somebody lose
[1:40:30] respect or trust for you. You made the
[1:40:33] choice to do it. Now you're trying to
[1:40:35] control the coinc the the the the
[1:40:37] consequences and that you can't change.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; But if you want the if you want the
[1:40:42] thing to make a a it's humility. You
[1:40:45] come in humility get in front of your
[1:40:48] family get on your knees and say I have
[1:40:50] done wrong. I have acted wrong. I have
[1:40:52] felt wrong. I am a son of God and I have
[1:40:55] asked the Lord to forgive me. Now I'm
[1:40:57] asking you to forgive me. But from this
[1:40:59] day on, I am commissioned to lead this
[1:41:01] home. And I must by the power of God
[1:41:04] lead.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Because your family needs you to lead.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Even if the sister's not ready to let go
[1:41:12] of it, she needs you to lead.
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; I asked a lady one time running over her
[1:41:19] husband. I said, "Why you do that?" She
[1:41:21] said, "Cuz he lets me.
[1:41:28] And we're talking about something.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The exploitation of weakness.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; So, Satan was there when you done wrong.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; So, every time you go to start
[1:41:39] confessing the word of God,
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; he's going to hold it over your head.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; He's going to That's what he's going to
[1:41:46] do.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, you think you're somebody.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You think you're spiritual.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to worship the Lord in
[1:41:54] the church.
[1:41:55] Yeah.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; You know what you do? You put your life
[1:41:59] under the blood.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; And when you get that life under the
[1:42:02] blood, then you tell that devil, "Look,
[1:42:04] Jesus knows everything about me.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; He knows my weaknesses. He knows my
[1:42:09] strength. And all that I am has been put
[1:42:11] under the blood. And I'll not let you
[1:42:13] bluff me. I'll not let you buffalo me.
[1:42:15] I'm a son of God. I'll live for God.
[1:42:18] I'll believe God's word." Amen. Because
[1:42:20] I'm coming under the blood. Listen this
[1:42:22] morning, Satan is trying to exploit the
[1:42:25] weakness of your life because you won't
[1:42:27] give it to Jesus.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; You won't put it under the blood.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible said if you confess your sin,
[1:42:34] he is faithful and just to forgive you.
[1:42:36] He's not looking to squash you. He's
[1:42:39] looking for you to confess it so he can
[1:42:41] fight for you. Put it under the blood so
[1:42:43] you can stand there and say to the
[1:42:46] devil, "You can't touch me. You've got
[1:42:48] no right to my family. I rebuke you,
[1:42:50] Satan, in the name of Jesus.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; See, and once you get it under the
[1:42:56] blood, then you got a position where you
[1:42:58] can stand and then you can overcome by
[1:43:01] your testimony. You can shut up the
[1:43:03] devil.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; You can shut up the devil by your
[1:43:06] testimony. And I love that last line.
[1:43:08] And they love not their lives
[1:43:11] unto death. Now, that's the spiritual
[1:43:13] application. That's the spiritual
[1:43:14] ambition we're talking about this
[1:43:15] morning. They love not their lives unto
[1:43:19] death. It means that you have soul sold
[1:43:21] out that you're willing to face this
[1:43:24] enemy at any cost.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; You're willing to destroy your enemy at
[1:43:29] any cost. And generally that means you.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Take Samson's attitude and say, "God, I
[1:43:35] want the power back in my life enough to
[1:43:38] die for it. I will die from my
[1:43:40] entertainments. I will die from the
[1:43:42] world. I will die from my pleasures. I
[1:43:45] will die from my lust. I will die from
[1:43:47] these things that's here. I will die
[1:43:49] from my jealousy. Lord, I want the power
[1:43:52] of God in my life. And when you begin to
[1:43:54] die, the power of God comes back into
[1:43:57] life. And there, Amen. They love not
[1:43:59] their lives unto death. So power
[1:44:01] returns. There's a possibility this
[1:44:03] morning for you in this ambition of God
[1:44:05] to see miracles take place in your life.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; You can have it this morning.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; But you're going to have to fight.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to fight. If our
[1:44:21] musicians would come, you you you can
[1:44:23] have it this morning, but you're going
[1:44:24] to have to fight.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Take a attitude.
[1:44:32] Who wants David's attitude?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; It's a Goliath,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; but I'm gonna run in the battle.
[1:44:45] It's a Goliath.
[1:44:47] But I got a secret. I've been anointed
[1:44:50] by a prophet before I met my Goliath.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; He knew God's purpose couldn't be
[1:44:57] destroyed.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; He ran. He ran to the battle.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; What an attitude.
[1:45:06] What an attitude lived in these men.
[1:45:09] Their angle of attack. I'm anointed.
[1:45:12] You're an uncircumcised Philistine.
[1:45:16] Shamgar whipped 600 of you. I surely can
[1:45:19] whip one.
[1:45:23] Me and me and Mariah Grace was talking
[1:45:25] the other day.
[1:45:28] And she was saying, "Dad, you ever
[1:45:29] notice that sometimes it's just one
[1:45:32] person in a service when they get their
[1:45:34] breakthrough, the whole church gets a
[1:45:36] breakthrough."
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, I've noticed that a lot."
[1:45:41] You know, Brother Bram taught that.
[1:45:44] He said when he was up there in Seattle,
[1:45:45] he said there was a an insane spirit and
[1:45:48] it was it was coming to attack him. And
[1:45:49] brother Bram said when the Holy Spirit
[1:45:51] conquered it and it fell over his feet,
[1:45:54] he said the chief devil was whipped.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And he said then from that time there
[1:45:58] was healings and miracles and every
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; So sometimes when you're attacking that
[1:46:04] devil from the angle God's gi you, it's
[1:46:08] not just for you.
[1:46:12] It's for other people in this room for
[1:46:14] other for other needs
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; that are sitting there. Do you see?
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; They love not their lives unto death.
[1:46:24] It's here in this America we have this
[1:46:26] great saying,
[1:46:29] give me liberty
[1:46:32] or give me death.
[1:46:35] It was a very famous saying of Patrick
[1:46:38] Henry. And here we are at the 4th of
[1:46:40] July, you know,
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; but what that really meant was,
[1:46:46] I'm ready for liberty
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; and I'm ready to declare my liberty.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; publicly
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; even if I die.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of attitude that guy
[1:46:57] had.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:00] Even if I die, even if they kill me,
[1:47:04] I'll declare my liberty.
[1:47:08] If you're if you like history,
[1:47:11] uh the Roman Empire itself in Rome, it
[1:47:15] it had great armies and generals, but it
[1:47:18] was a republic run by Congress.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; There was one Julius Caesar
[1:47:25] rode up to the river of Rubicon on his
[1:47:27] horse, and there was a law that if you
[1:47:30] crossed the Rubicon River with an army
[1:47:33] then it was considered rebellion and
[1:47:34] mutiny and it was considered an
[1:47:36] overthrow. So, so anytime an army
[1:47:40] returned under a general to the city of
[1:47:43] Rome, they had to disband as an army and
[1:47:46] they had to ride across citizens.
[1:47:49] But Julius de Caesar decided he would
[1:47:51] take Rome
[1:47:54] and he sat at the river of Rubicon. And
[1:47:55] when he rolled over that river, he cried
[1:47:59] out those great famous Italian words
[1:48:01] that uh the die is cast.
[1:48:06] Meaning
[1:48:08] this thing that I have did
[1:48:11] either give me liberty or it'll give me
[1:48:13] death. There's no return from here.
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see? You're going to have to ring
[1:48:22] that liberty bell this morning. True.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You got to take your stand.
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; It's your angle of attack, your
[1:48:31] attitude.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be bitter. I'm going to
[1:48:35] be better.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just not I'm not going to be bitter.
[1:48:41] I am not. You're going to not make me a
[1:48:43] victim in this story. I'm the overcomer
[1:48:46] in this story.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:53] I'm not going to let the devil crown me
[1:48:54] with no grumbling, mumbling spirit.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; I want to be crowned with the glory and
[1:49:00] happiness of God.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you this morning,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; great men, great people in this Bible
[1:49:08] took stands throughout their lives.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Because they had an ambition. And I pray
[1:49:14] this morning that your ambition becomes
[1:49:17] the ambition that God has for you. your
[1:49:20] purpose. If you're sick, his ambition is
[1:49:22] for you to be healed. If you're sitting
[1:49:25] here this morning, you need God's got an
[1:49:27] ambition for your life.
[1:49:29] And if if you're if you're there this
[1:49:31] morning, sitting there, I I just wonder,
[1:49:34] you know, sometimes sometimes actions
[1:49:38] throw up a rock and a whirlwind come.
[1:49:41] You throw dust and fleas and flies and
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You you you you give a little bit of
[1:49:46] oil, an action.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder if you could take an
[1:49:49] action with me this morning. And as you
[1:49:51] stand to your feet this morning, I want
[1:49:53] you to stand with purpose.
[1:49:56] I want you to stand as you've never
[1:49:58] stood before.
[1:50:00] As you stand to your feet, I want you to
[1:50:02] stand as one who will not be a victim to
[1:50:04] this no longer.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; To stand as one that is here to declare
[1:50:09] your rights before God. My weaknesses
[1:50:11] will no longer be exploited.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to accept it this morning.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to accept it this morning.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Father, with our
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; hands lifted,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; standing on our feet this morning, Lord,
[1:50:27] there's something screaming within our
[1:50:28] hearts.
[1:50:30] Father, I know I've been long this
[1:50:32] morning, but my heart is very burdened
[1:50:34] for your children, Lord.
[1:50:36] You've placed these things in my heart
[1:50:38] to speak to them, Lord.
[1:50:41] And Father, I pray this morning that as
[1:50:43] they stand, they stand as they've never
[1:50:45] stood. May they stand in liberty and
[1:50:48] freedom.
[1:50:49] May they stand this morning, Lord,
[1:50:52] knowing the enemy cannot exploit them
[1:50:54] any further.
[1:50:56] I pray if there be a a leader in a home
