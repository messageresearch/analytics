[Music] So we pour out our praise. You are [Music] [Applause] great. Sister Laura is going to testify tonight. Let's &gt;&gt; um two weeks before camp, I was in the hospital short of breath, sharp pain in my lungs, and I was diagnosed with pury, which is inflammation of the lining of the lungs, and they also said I had fluid in the sack around my heart. Starting in January, I could do what uh Brother Andrew said we shouldn't do, which is make a laundry list of everything that was wrong with me. My body has been fighting a lot this year and a lot of loss, but I just decided to just keep looking towards the healing. And I went to camp knowing that I was going to receive something special. And God verified it through Katie when she went up for prayer on Thursday. And I went through the prayer line and God touched me. But when I went back to my seat and brother Ben started singing, "It's your breath in our lungs." God said, "Your healing is coming now." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And his holy spirit just swept through the building at that moment. And you know how it is. You can't make that scream of that blessing up. And I'm telling you all the pain that I'd had in my lungs that had me sleeping in the recliner. It was so lovely to be able to lay down and sleep in my bed. And then Sunday morning, I went up for prayer that all the appointments that I have with specialist coming up would all just be testimonies of his goodness. And I had an appointment on Tuesday with the hematologist because my blood, y'all, it's it's been wacky all over the place. Um, lots and lots of testing, but long story short, well, it's too late for that. I'm sorry. His name was Hassan Aada and we sat and he was in my room for a long time taking lots of notes and um I just felt pressed to tell him I'm healed and I told him we had meetings and I know God touched me and the words that came out of his mouth were faith is such an important part of healing &gt;&gt; and he didn't discount it and we sat there and we talked about the things of the Lord and I was just so grateful because that was my specific prayer is that would be testifying of his goodness and just believe with me as I go through these other appointments coming up that it would all be glory to God that I'm completely healed in my body. &gt;&gt; It's your prayer in our love so we pour out. So we pour out our praise. Hallelujah. It's your bread in our love. Hallelujah. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise. It's your praise in our love. Oh, so we pour our praise to you all. [Music] [Applause] Oh, great are you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mighty are thy works, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going to have a testimony service tonight. &gt;&gt; All right. And uh two of my favorite uh uh traditions, if we could use the word, that we've we've sort of established along with our youth camp. One is the prayer service that we have with the young people before camp. &gt;&gt; The other one is the testimony service we have after camp. &gt;&gt; They both uh they both uh lend so much to the weekend itself. Maybe we'd like to stand for a scripture reading just before we say a few words of thanks and then go right to the testimonies. in Deuteronomy chapter 6 ju just read uh in verses 4 uh down a little bit and I know that I've shared this with the church sometime before uh this is something that struck my heart a little earlier this year. Now, this is just after the ten commandments have been delivered. And so, the uh you know, the law of the Lord has been put in the hands of the people. And so, it's a it's a dispensational change. It's a prophetic ministry uh turning of the corner for God's elect. And this is how they're instructed to respond here. Oh Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And watch this. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in your heart, and you shall teach them diligently unto thy children. shall talk of them when thou sitest in thine house, and when thou walst by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou riseest up. I know that people uh uh that that sometimes people look at youth ministry as something that's secondary in the church or optional or or uh you know, something that's a lower priority. But but God uh in this in this changing of dispensation is instructing the people in the same breath that he tells you to take the word of God and hide it in your heart and make it a part of your daily living and your daily communication. He's also instructing it to teach us teach it diligently to our children and establish them in the way. And so we appreciate all those who have supported in in in every different way uh to make our youth camp possible. Uh because that's the burden behind it &gt;&gt; is to give uh is to not not let the not let the message you know uh decline into dead traditions and &gt;&gt; you know just carry on on the inertia of ritual and &gt;&gt; you know and and family legacies but to give a new generation their own chance at a revival. And every fresh and true revival comes from one source. That's back to the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what we want to do is lift up the message not as a dead letter. Amen. But as a quickened spirit, a revealed Christ. And and uh so many have got behind it. Amen. Just to make it possible. So we want to thank you all. You could be seated. Just want to make a few words of thanks. I just uh you know, we really ought to spend an hour thanking everybody. uh a piece, you know, for the labor that's gone in, but we just run through uh some of the things and I and certainly I'll leave people out, but uh we just want to we want to thank all the workers uh the staff members and everybody that has just uh just uh it's unbelievable the amount of labor that goes into a weekend. Uh, but Sister Tara, Brother Richard, the McNelte family, and all those that would work with them. We appreciate our singers and our musicians that played and played to keep an atmosphere. Uh, Brother Ben and his his group, his team, the, you know, the medical staff. We kept them busy once again. Sister Lily and brother Chris helping her. And, uh, you know, uh, we sure thank God for that coffee. &gt;&gt; That really keeps uh, that keeps everyone going through the weekend. And it sure meant a lot, you know, to have brother Nathan's sister Natalie uh you know, uh just just starting up a fledgling business there to close down their personal business for a whole weekend to serve God's people is really an amazing gesture and we appreciate that. I appreciate all the dorm leaders who, you know, uh dorm leading isn't just uh it's not just staying up late and having fun with the kids. There's a lot of there's a lot of little situations, a lot of little sometimes sensitive or or or situations or a little bit of drama that rises up and it's just amazing how the Lord uses those dorm leaders to keep the testimony of the camp clean to protect everybody's experience and they just uh you know they they make a real sacrifice to be part of it and there and it's it's really incredible uh you know the effect that they have in lives and you know I I I don't know that I uh have forgotten a single dorm leader I ever had in all my years going to youth camp. They just make a mark on your life. And we thank the night guards uh gave up their sleep for the weekend. Just keep things orderly. And so uh and and certainly many that I forgot. Brother Matt Mccclard and running all those activities and things that our young people could have a good time because sure we sure believe in young people having a good time. &gt;&gt; So we just want to we just want to just lump them all into a big group and just give them a round of applause tonight and show our appreciation. acts of service. [Applause] Amen. We're so thankful for what God has provided. You know, and what would mean more uh than that, what I would appreciate is if everybody in this building, especially the young people, would go seek seek some of these people out. If you saw somebody working on the grounds and go tell them thank you personally face to face for the sacrifice that that was made. And you know, if they uh if they're in one of these rolls that that we've mentioned or but if it's somebody who you know, picked up some trash or cleaned a toilet or changed out, you know, some paper towels or something like that, tell them thank you twice because, you know, all that stuff needs to be done. And we appreciate those that don't despise the little things, but just looking for some way, just some way just shows what's in the heart, some way to be a part of what God is doing and and to just put up stock in these testimonies that are going to come forth tonight. Amen. So, we appreciate you all and I'd like to especially say that I'm so thankful for the the youth of True Word Tabernacle &gt;&gt; and I, you know, I'm just so proud, so proud of these young people, their testimony, you know, their their influence. And isn't it amazing that we could invite young people from all over the world, &gt;&gt; Yeah. other countries and everything all across the United States from many many many different churches uh actually 66 or more churches represented at the youth camp &gt;&gt; and not have our young people take a backseat to any of them in their testimony and their character uh just in their witness you know it's it's not hard to see what God has done in this youth group and and uh the sincerity comes through the character the loyalty you know they're invested in this youth camp and it makes a difference and and I I appreciate them. I want Amish to know that uh that that somebody's appreciating uh their overcoming life and uh and just grateful for them and what the Lord has done. And also, I'd like to thank our pastor, Brother Wayne. You know, none of this would be possible without the church getting behind this youth camp in a great way. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm sure that there's nobody in my position directing a youth camp that's given as much liberty as I am. And that's not lost on me. I appreciate that very much. &gt;&gt; And uh and you know that the church puts a lot financially behind making the camp possible uh believing in the vision and the and the return. And so uh I just appreciate the support, brother Wayne. It's a dream come true uh for us all to be able to do this. And we want to we want to thank God for the ministry. Brother Andrew Glover, Brother Josh Bennett. &gt;&gt; What what a wonderful word that we heard over the weekend. You know, it it just was uh it was just good, solid, clean preaching of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. With the dynamics behind it, you could see the effect in the young people. You know, as the young people were coming through that prayer line, I was just I was marveling and noticing what a good, clean, solid faith &gt;&gt; that you could sense in the hearts of the young people. Just standing on the word of God, believing in his word. No sensationalism in it. just a sincere strong faith by the preaching of the word that that only comes by hearing. Amen. And only if you're hearing the revealed word of the hour. Amen. It produces life. It produces power. Amen. It it puts a key in your hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. It can bind and it can loose. And so we just thank the Lord, you know, for for for preaching a word that would help our young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once again, being such a blessing. Amen. You know, uh we're here to testify of what the Lord has done. It's been uh several days since camp ended. And so there's been plenty of time for everyone that had a camp testimony to be attacked by the enemy to maybe stumble and fall and maybe uh you know to to to hear Satan's lies to have a mind battle to go through all of those things. &gt;&gt; You know that's just a normal part of the experience. Jesus himself, brother Brandham talked about right after he was baptized, he went out into the wilderness to be tempted of the spirit. He said that's just the way it happens. When you get the Holy Ghost, the first thing the devil comes right along for temptations when you claim your healing, watch the devil come right along to back her up and say that it's wrong. Brother Bram said that's the time to stand &gt;&gt; because you don't testify of what you see or feel. You testify of what you believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. and stay with it. Another time, Brother Bram said, "But you see, but you look at your symptom. You look at your symptoms, say, "Well, look here. I was prayed for maybe for a crippled hand, and my hand is no better." Brother Bam said, "That's no sign that you're not healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God said so. That's it. No matter what that hand takes place, it's what God said. It ain't from my hand. It's what God said. He said, "I accepted it and I'll stay with it and that's all." And he said, "Now, he could open it up. He today, tomorrow might be 25 years, but you let your testimony be positive. He said every time you get sick and you were prayed for and you go out and get a little sick, you say, "Well, I guess I lost my healing." Brother Bram said, "Then your testimony becomes negative and Jesus can't say no more for you because he's the high priest of your confession." Amen. As was preached over the weekend, he's sitting there making intercessions on your confession, what you believe. Amen. Amen. So, we're here just to give the devil a black eye. Amen. And to show that, hey, you know, no matter what I've been going through this week, I'm going to stand, Amen. on what God revealed to me at camp. I'm going to stand on the word of God and I'm going to testify of my healing, testify of my experience, testify of my deliverance. Amen. I'm going to make a positive confession. I'm going to carry that positive confession to the finished result. Amen. Because he's the high priest of my profession. I like what the what brother Brandham told John Ryan, I believe it was, that came in the prayer line because he was blind. Brother Brandham prayed for him that he would and told him he would have his sight. He came back around the line. He said, "Well, Brother Brandham, I can't see." He said, "Well, what does that have to do with it?" He said, "But you said I'm healed." He said, "You are healed." Amen. You said you believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Now, but he and so he sent him away with a positive confession." I like what he told him. He said, "Give the angel of the Lord a chance. give the angel of the Lord a chance. That's what you find, you know, a young person gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost where they stumble many times is they, you know, they they get a really experience with God in a meeting like we've had and they go home and then the first sign of trouble they be the devil comes and attacks that with doubt and makes you doubt your experience. Amen. I like the quote brother Caleb shared with some of the ministry today about Moses. how Moses after he'd stood on that sacred sands, after he met that pillar of fire face to face. Amen. When he walked away from the bush, the fire left the bush because the fire came from that bush and came into Moses and went with him. So, you know, when you run up against a red sea, you don't have to go running back to the burning bush. Amen. Because the fire that was burning in the bush, Amen. is identifying itself above you, Amen. looking at your obstacle, Brother Bam said, with angry eyes. Amen. To to take you forward. Amen. You know, and that's the thing it is. If you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the first time you get into trouble, you don't have to run back to youth camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. You stand on your experience. Amen. And profess, amen, that that the Holy Ghost came upon me and he said he'll never leave me. He said he'll never forsake me, but he'll be with me even in me to the end of the age. So, how many got a testimony tonight? Amen. We we uh we we we just want to give uh time uh whatever it takes. We we can't go all night, but we'll give a good amount of time here uh for testimony. Uh we'll just uh just a couple points of order. We appreciate as you testify, if you try to keep it brief, uh that sure helps. You know, I know it's hard to get our thoughts together sometime, but you know, the main thing of a testimony is give give God the glory. And that doesn't mean we need all the details. And and even things if they feel personal to you, there's no obligation to share because it's a testimony, not a not a confessional. Amen. Amen. But as far as you as far as you feel to share, amen, we're just behind you. Amen. We we we we support it. We just want to give God the glory. Even if it's, hey, I showed up to camp sick and I left healed. That's a complete testimony. Amen. You say, I showed up bound, but I left delivered. That's a complete testimony. Amen. That's all that's all there really is to a testimony. And so, we'll just uh we'll ask as best you can uh keep that brief and uh recognizing the struggle. Amen. Amen. If it gets going on, just tell everybody you're closing. And uh and we'll just uh I know there are many that have a testimony. Youth camp, we find out, is not only for the young people, but it's for all of us. &gt;&gt; But uh but just at first, we try to get a good amount of the young people time to testify. Amen. Because it's focused uh around them. Amen. Amen. Well, let's start. Amen. Who's got a testimony this evening? Brother Ben. All right, start us out, brother. &gt;&gt; Well, um, I don't really have a testimony from camp. It's more of a testimony about my my year-long walk with Christ so far. He has taken me so far. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; he has I I just I can't describe it. I he's been have he's been burdening this me on my heart for quite a while now. And I was just asking the Lord for a reason to or a time to ask to testify and he he brought this up this this service up and I just thank the Lord for it. Um so Lord help me I apologize. &gt;&gt; I I really can't think of anything. I'm sorry. [Laughter] Well, I just thank the Lord for all he's done in my life. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; he's given me a testimony. I can't really describe it right now, but he's still working in my life and he's still working in your life. Praise the Lord. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; If you I'm sure you've all noticed, but it's been an amazing trajectory brother Ben's had in his life about would it be about two years ago, you wouldn't have known anything about the message, anything about uh you know uh uh what you know now. So, he's just entered into a whole new world and it's been just inspirational to watch the Lord get a hold of him, to see the moving of the spirit in his life. And so, we're just thankful for you, Brother Ben. You're a testimony to us all. Amen. And, you know, Brother Ben's got a real good friend. Uh, Brother Micaia has done amazing work just being a friend to Brother Ben. And I I'm I'm proud of that. And uh I've told brother Micaiah this personally, but there's a lot of guys stand in a pulpit for a year and never produce something like the what we've seen in brother Ben's life. And so we just appreciate what the Lord has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody else got a testimony. You boys, brother Silas. So um I don't remember how long ago exactly it was. pretty sure it was a Sunday, but it was probably like two, three, four months ago. Um, I think it was brother Wayne that was preaching and he preached on it doesn't matter if you were raised in the message unless you have a personal encounter with God, it won't matter. &gt;&gt; And so, ever since that sermon, that's what I prayed for. That's what I wanted. I wanted my personal encounter with God. And uh I've been struggling with a well, pardon my testimony, I was struggling with a couple of different addictions and the devil had stole my peace and I was just a big wreck. Um and at this church camp, I really wasn't expecting much cuz I've been to a bunch of them. I went there and I was ready to I was there for a couple of different reasons, not all of them um church related, but um I went there and the first sermon he was uh preaching about your opportunity and that really hit me &gt;&gt; and it made me wake up for a second and made me actually pay attention. And then the second one um was about um you've been given the key. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um that's when my heart really opened and um the third night, I don't remember exactly what it was about, but um I walked through that prayer line and I will say that those addictions are gone now. I no longer deal with those anymore. I know that there's going to be temptations down the road, but I know that God has given me the key and I'm free. &gt;&gt; Um, and my pieces back and I'm just so, &gt;&gt; oh goodness, throat. Um, and I'm just so happy and I've got my peace back and I've got the I've got it and I'm just [Applause] that's what it's all about, church. [Music] [Applause] went through the prayer line on Saturday night and uh I just had a lot in my heart. We're just asking the Lord closer to walk with the Lord and went through the prayer line and um after the ministers had gotten through praying and they had went up and kind of just walking around and I went up back to my seat. I was just sitting there and I was just asked telling the Lord I love him. The angel of the Lord I felt him just come over and hover right above me and I knew it was the angel of the Lord. Just such a peace came over me and I just I don't can't describe it but it was all over the building. I know you guys felt it and I just I want to testify. [Music] [Applause] And to say the least, Brother Ben was right. It was the best weekend of my life. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Um, I had a few things I was going to camp for. I wanted another experience and um I wanted more joy in my life and um every sermon was super powerful and spoke to me. But uh Thursday night um he touched me in a special way. And um Saturday night I went through the prayer line and before I got past the first few ministers, I just started jumping up and down and they had to carry me out. And before they could get me all the way out of the prayer line, I heard Isaac pray um give her joy. And that was just a confirmation that he hears my prayers. &gt;&gt; And um I was out out of it for a little while, but uh that was a super amazing experience for me. And um we ended up staying in the church quite late that night because we were all drunk. But &gt;&gt; it was so amazing and I'm so grateful for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nathan, Nathan, if you can have him stand, that'd be great. &gt;&gt; See a little better. &gt;&gt; Um, I had been going to camp and um, I just really wanted peace and joy and I just wanted to be happy in the Lord. And I'll just say I came out happy. I had joy. I have peace and that's really my testimony. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; So, I had a few things that I was coming to camp for. Um, I really wanted the Holy Ghost and to have an experience. And Saturday night, I was standing in the prayer line waiting and my brother-in-law Tyler came and told me that he had went up to give brother Andrew a uh handkerchief. And he said that he felt the presence of the Lord up there and that whatever I wanted then he was up there and I went through and I believe that I got the Holy Ghost and I also got drunk that night. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for a couple months. I had been I had some questions and I was praying about them. I went and the first night I was thinking about those questions and he answered them just as I was thinking about it. [Music] [Applause] Amen. The word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Anybody else? Sister Shelby. Um on a couple days before camp, Fleece had posted something on the youth chat about testimony she had and at the end of it she wrote that no matter how big or small of a ask we had or a need to go ahead and just write it down at the beginning of camp and lay it aside. And so I'd been dealing with a lot of fear and anxiety for about nine months. And I just wrote down every lie Satan had told me over the past nine months. And next to it I would write, "He is my peace." Or, "He is my joy. He's my love." And at the end of it, I asked I said, "I'm asking for full deliverance." &gt;&gt; And on Saturday, while brother Andrew was preaching, God came down and delivered me of every single thing. Anybody? [Music] Anybody down there? Brother Samuel. &gt;&gt; Well, when I first came into camp, I was expecting to get a refilling of the Holy Ghost all through camp. If I was looking for it, I was following through, praying for it. And on Saturday night, I was I stood up in the prayer line. I was going through just thinking of what my prayer is, what what should I be praying for? And I I was taking as steps of faith. Every step I take, I pray for something. And I would I was waiting as I come up to I got a thought. Well, I want to be I want to be slain in the spirit. I want to be carried out. I don't I I've never had it before. I want to be feel his spirit just come down so heavy I couldn't stand. And when I was going through there were so many things that were answered that were I had prayed for for months and I was just so slain in the spirit that I was I had to carried out. I was laid out and then once I slowly came back then I ended I was got refilled with the Holy Ghost I was touched. Um I I ended up getting drunk that night as well but it was it was a wonderful feeling. Joy came back. That's my testimony. [Music] [Applause] Lord Thank you, Jesus. I just went through the prayer line and I was praying for something else and whenever I went through ministry said something that I didn't even go up for and I got delivered from that. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Okay. So, I went up uh I I went to the camp, whatever, expecting deliverance from an addiction. I've been kind of just hanging out on my phone every freak opportunity I got. kind of took away my focus from spending time with God and all that. And I just let it consume me and I went up uh to camp expecting deliverance and God delivered me from that. But not only that, uh, for quite a few years, my ankles have been, uh, super weak and anytime I'd play or even just walking, they just give out or whatever, I'd twist and roll them. And so I always had to wear a brace. Well, this camp I kind of asked I'd left it and I'd asked my mom to get me a new one and so she got it. Well, I ended up not even using it the entire camp and my ankles were completely healed. Never rolled them once, never hurt him. I'm thank the Lord for that. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We'll just open it to anyone who wants to testify now. Anybody? Brother Mike got to raise your hands high. I get tunnel vision when I'm holding a microphone. So, don't get old. Testimonies are awesome. Uh, Thursday at work, I ended up going to the ER. A lot of chest pressure. thinking I'm going to miss camp. Was looking forward to it. Spent 24 hours. They did all the tests. They did a stress test and all that. They kept me overnight and and all everything test came back good. It all came back good. The stress test came back good. They said they had noticed a nodule in my left lung. You know, fear tries to step in. And Saturday night, I I go up. I'm with the ministers standing up front and I don't know why I'm so nervous. I'm up with the ministers up front and I've been battling dizziness also for a couple years now. And as I was walking up there to the front, I'm dizzy as can be. I'm standing up there dizzy as can be praying over everybody. And at the end of it, I went down to the front after everybody had gone through and I was like, "That nodule is not going to be there. &gt;&gt; I'm going to claim my healing right now." And I went up there to the front and as I was walking through the power of God fell &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden I heard myself shouting, "It is over. I am delivered. I am healed. And I know that I know that I know that I know that that is now going to be there. I got some testing coming up. I've followed up with my doctor today." He said, "As far as your heart goes," he goes, "There's nothing wrong." And he's not worried about that nodule or anything. But I know when I go, so they're going to do some more imaging for another reason and it'll check out that nodule at the same time. It's not going to be there. &gt;&gt; And that dizziness has been gone ever since that time. It tried to come back tonight, but it's gone. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was praying for the filling of the Holy Ghost and on Saturday night through the prayer line I believe that prayer was answered. [Applause] [Music] Um, so one of the things I went to camp for was um my stomach issues and um our camp was the worst over like many years. Like I would have to take a bunch of pain pain and like acid medication and this camp I didn't have to take any whatsoever. So glory to God for that. And then uh one of my main thing was like Sunday mornings I could hardly last like I could hardly go through service usually like I'd throw up a bunch sometimes and like I could hardly go to the fellowship after. I'd be so sick and have to leave. And I just got delivered of that Saturday night and I haven't felt any pain since. [Music] I'll do my best to keep this short. Back in October, November of last year, I started to have a lot of hormonal issues, which caused me to have a lot of mental battles. Sometime in June, my doctor said I most likely had PCOS. I decided I wasn't going to accept that and went up for prayer sometime in July. Camp arrived in Thursday night. Brother Andrew was talking about recognizing and believing the Lord's presence and how anything could take place. I claimed my healing right then. The presence of the Lord was so strong and it felt like something physically dropped into my chest and it just settled there. I can't really explain it other than I knew I was healed and it was all over. Saturday came and it was a rough day. The devil was attacking me with some of the worst mind battles, fear, anxiety, and con condemnation about my past that I've ever experienced. I knew he was fighting me that hard because he was about to lose his hold on my life. &gt;&gt; When brother Andrew started talking about fear and anxiety at the end of the service, I was praying and I remember telling the Lord, I didn't know where or when all this fear and anxiety started, but I knew he had me in my future in his hands and I knew he could deliver me, too. The presence of the Lord swept through my row and those chains of fear, anxiety, and condemnation broke off of my life. There's so much more that happened, but it would be too long to tell. That Tuesday after camp, I had an ultrasound to check and see if something more serious was going on other than what they thought was PCOS. The devil began to fight me so hard that morning, but I kept reminding him that he was defeated by the sword in my hand and the word in my mouth. I got the ultrasound done and my doctor comes in to read the results and she says that I don't have PCOS and everything is perfectly fine and healthy. I told Annie what my doctor said and she was like, Lauren, your doctor probably doesn't even realize it, but you just got your healing. That's when it hit me that the Lord was so gracious and answered my prayers and healed me. I knew he he had and it took it a minute to sink in. The Lord answered so many of my prayers and I know he'll answer the rest of them. I'm so thankful for the Lord's grace in my life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One more camp testimony. Brother Ian Patton here got baptized on Sunday morning. Go stand everybody. &gt;&gt; We're sure proud of this young man. Amen. Any other hands? Sister Laura. &gt;&gt; Okay. First off, I was a counselor for the first time this year, but I had a really good group of girls, so I got broken easy. But I really enjoyed that. But well, it's actually a couple of months ago when uh Brother Ron and Brother Tim had come down and Brother Ron had preached a message and it was simple. was just God is a big God and um so uh you know we've been going through some different things and at that that that time I was going through a lot and um I'd went through the prayer line and uh actually it was brother Ron came he asked he goes can I talk to you and he goes uh sister he's like you can't carry this you're not strong enough he goes but God is a big God and and the spirit of God hit me and I just totally fell out which I had never done that. But uh so I held that in my heart. Well, um of course the God is a big God. Well, you know, you guys know of everything that's kind of been going on with with Zion and the different things. Well, um we come to Saturday and um um I'm helping in the prayer line while I I had seen Zion in the back and also there was a scripture the Lord had given me about and I actually put it in the house. I give it to Z. And it says um that the Lord will remember Zion. Yeah, this set time has come. He will favor her. And I I told Zion that well. &gt;&gt; So I seen her and it was amazing like how the song services, brother men, he's just in the spirit and like different situations where like I knew the situation and he would sing a song. Well, &gt;&gt; so I seen Zion and then that he started to sing that song that God is bigger, better, stronger, greater. And one part says, uh, I say to the mountain, it's time to move. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I just felt the Lord and I, right? You know, before she got into the prayer line and I I went to her and just I quoted that scripture and I said, "It, you know, it's time for this mountain to move." And uh, so she, you know, the presence of the Lord and then she gets into the prayer line and Brother Wayne says, "It's time for the mountain to move." And boy did God move. And we were all rejoicing, jumping and shouting. And anyway, so I just want to thank the Lord. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Just real quick, the uh Lord gave me a the meetings were wonderful and and I I can't tell you how wonderful it was to see the so many drunk young people. I'm so so happy. It was such a wonderful experience sitting in there and watching the Lord just sweep over you young people. But Sunday night or Sunday afternoon, I'm standing out there at the end of the road and I'm just thinking on the the goodness of the Lord and I look down and the devil, the serpent is laying dead between my feet. And every one of you that came in there Sunday drove over top of that dead devil. He was he was dried up. But every one of you got to drive over top of that dead devil. [Applause] [Music] Well, uh, God's been doing a lot in my life over this past couple months. Um, it's good to be good to be here and a part of the church. &gt;&gt; Um, well, for one testimony, uh, my lip that was cut. Um, I was supposed to go to an oral surgeon here in a couple weeks, but I went up and got prayed for. It's completely healed. I have to cancel it cuz there's there's nothing to look at. There's nothing to see there. It's completely healed. Um, but God has been doing so much in in my life. Um, there's Yeah, I God's been good. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Uh, so I had been wanting a a closer walk with the Lord before camp and uh cuz I hadn't I hadn't been reading my Bible or even listening to tapes as much as I knew I I could have or should have. Uh, and I kind of felt myself growing apart from the Lord. So, uh, when I went to the prayer line Saturday, I heard one of the ministers say, uh, give him a closer walk, Lord. And that really touched me. So, now after camp, I came out with my heart was burned with a new desire for the Lord. And so, now I can walk closer with him every day. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I just want to thank the Lord uh for touching my life again at camp. Um on Sunday afternoon when uh brother Josh was preaching about all the uh lost ones coming in um that just really touched me and I was just thanking the Lord in that moment and I just thank the Lord for his touch. [Music] [Applause] kept waiting on Z or Zoe to testify so I wouldn't have to do this. Um but and I wasn't going to, but I figured that if um you guys all prayed for me as much as you have, then you deserve the right to know about the victory that's came. Um, a couple weeks ago I ended up back in the hospital because I was passing out so much and I was hitting my head and and things were just in a really a really scary spot. And um, but in the hospital, the Lord had just revealed to me how much that fear was playing a part in all of it. And he took that fear away. And and from then on, I knew I knew I was healed. I just I had to walk into the full heal, you know, the full victory of it. And so, um, went into camp and I knew I knew that I was going to get my complete healing. And, um, the Saturday before service, I was praying and the spirit of the Lord came down in the house and and it was just a special such a special meeting. And I had never encountered anything like that where I just really felt like I met him face to face. And um and so I uh it just it hit me that um I was thinking about the prayer line and about the children of Israel coming to the Red Sea and how when they walked through that water swallowed up all of those enemies that had been coming after them. And I and I purposed in my heart when I walked through that prayer line that that enemy that had been following me for this last year and a half, he wasn't going to follow me through that prayer lineise. And I'll tell you, I have not passed out one time since Thursday &gt;&gt; and I'm getting stronger every day and that he has completely healed me. And I'm so thankful and I thank you all. And I' been on some certain medicines and things that I'd been on for a year, year and a half, and I've he's completely restored my peace and my joy and my sleep. And I thank you all for praying. And I just thank the Lord for what he's done. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I thank you all for um hosting the camp. It was a blessing and I had excruciating pain. I couldn't lift my arm. I couldn't do anything two days ago and now I can no pain. And then also um um Somali was like, "Can we go tonight for the testimony?" I said, "Oh no, we got work and school." And I was cooking and God said go. So I was like, Molly, hurry, get your clothes. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Um, I just want to say God did so many things for me at camp. Um, through the prayer line service. I believe that he filled me with the Holy Ghost. And I just want to say thank you all for being my friend. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] So, uh, I've been battling for about a year now with, uh, just different health conditions. Um, just, you know, similar to Bethany, just passing out and different things and just the devil trying to torment me. And uh well at camp that week before camp it was probably the one of the worst weeks. And uh well we Saturday night um was again it's pretty rough. I was just really weak and different things and Caleb was he had such a bad migraine actually in fact that he just said I've got to go lay down and he went in the car and laid down and I realized it astonished me like what are we doing no this is the devil has been fighting us for this moment I said texted him saying get back in here I was like no I was like we have not fought for all this for us to go lay down or something we can't I don't care and I said let's I said I I wasn't evening and go in the prayer line and uh but I just really felt that I should and uh I mean I was again I was weak. I kept having to sit down different things and uh when I got up to the prayer line honestly I didn't have any emotion. I wasn't crying. I was just Lord just whatever you want from me cuz you know Lord I believe that you've healed me. But and again mom said that brother Bend started singing that song. So I speak to the mountain, it's time to move. And a lightning bolt struck me like I've never felt before in my entire life. And Uncle Wayne said, "Speak, Zion. Speak." And I just started screaming, "I'm healed. I'm healed." And um the girl who could hardly walk danced for like 20, 30 minutes &gt;&gt; and was able to dance with her girls Bethany and Zoe, which we danced all over that devil, I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; And the girl who had to be carried out all the previous services was able to get a purse and she was able to pray with a couple other people. She danced and she was able to walk out on her own feet. Amen. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Um, I just want to thank the Lord. Um, I as as we moved here about seven years ago and and our heart's desires was our kids would be raised in this atmosphere and I believe that we've begun to see the impact of that and I'm so thankful. Um, I have witnessed firsthand the effects that the enemy has tried to place on my kids. Like, I've seen even in their young age when there's been fear, when there's been evil influences, when they've been tormented, but I've also now seen when they've been under the impact of the Holy Ghost. And someone recently told me, uh, "Brother, I think you're raising a fanatic." And I I want to say, well, I think all our kids here are fanatics, and I'm thankful for that. [Applause] [Music] share one that was texted in anonymously and that uh you'll understand why from the details here. This is from a young couple in the church here. Uh two months or so before camp, the Lord put on our hearts to give an offering to help out with the camp expenses. We decided that we would just give whatever the next month's commission check was. We never really know what it'll be. So when it came in for that month, it was over double the amount we had ever made in commission. Be careful what you ask for. Amen. But the same week, there was a big meeting at work that I had been praying about. It would be a big deal for me to get this client. I gave the check to the Lord. Two to three days later, the client decided to use our company. You just can't outgive the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] We all know that we have a restoration message &gt;&gt; and something really struck me. I can't remember all the details but when brother Josh was ministering I believe there was somebody in his assembly 20 years out from the Lord and the Lord restored him. So what really struck me on Sunday after the service in the back room where the ministers were, our brother Miguel from Pawne, Oklahoma gave his testimony of three of his loved ones. And I think one of them had one of them was his stepdad. I believe didn't want nothing to do with him for a time, but the Lord just restored all three &gt;&gt; and I think one of them was out from the Lord for many years. So people, I know that God is real and he's going to restore those that have backsliden. We're claiming them. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Okay, like Nathan said, I went to camp sick and I left healed. Um, after about eight months of um of passing out and feeling very out of control and um helpless, I um well, I didn't make it through the prayer line. I I did kind of crumble to the ground but um it was in a way of uh the Lord was carrying me and um he was holding me in his arms and instead of feeling helpless I was just I was just resting and yeah then yeah anyways it was really good. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Good evening, folks. Um, so there's been uh some promises I've been claiming for quite a few years and lately I've been getting to the point it's like I'm speaking the word and I'm waiting on the manifestation and I'm speaking the word and waiting on the manifestation and the devil started coming and fighting me like man what's the point? Because speaking the word over a situation takes a lot of energy out of you if you're not seeing it happen. And as it just happens over and over, year in and year out, and the devil's like, "Why you just keep wasting your time?" And I started feeling depressed about it. And uh then I um I was worshiping on prayer line was Saturday, right? Yeah. So I was worshiping on Saturday night and I was just thanking God for whatever he done for me and all that. And then all of a sudden about the time that God hid Zion and all them, I was like thanking the Lord like Jesus, thank you for them, you know. And he said, "Okay, so the same way I'm answering their prayers, I'm going to answer yours. But I want you to understand it's a privilege for you to speak the word and claim a promise and I don't answer it because it's your way of proving your fa your faith in my word." And so I started the depression left because I started saying, "Thank you, Jesus, for allowing me to have this chance of claiming my victory, of claiming my promise even when I'm not seeing it happen." And so that depression lifted. I ain't seen the promises yet, but I'm thankful. I mean, I want to see them happen, right? But on the other hand, I'm thankful that God has chosen me to be able to claim these victories and allow me to grow in that. And then the devil must have got upset about that because he healed oh God healed her of puricy and then I just got diagnosed with bronchitis yesterday. But the same God that can deliver her from pury can whoop this bronchitis. So I'll be all right. So [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wonder if we can get a few more young people in. We got back there. I'm coming. All right. I'm gonna try to make this quick, but uh God's done a lot for me. Um, not too long ago, I started to slip really bad and I started to get a lot of mental battles and um, just started doing things that I normally wouldn't. And uh, I guess to put in a way, I just started running from the Lord. Started, you know, skipping services, any excuses I could find to skip a service. So, you know, this is all going to tie in, but I took a vacation to Florida and made sure I was going to be gone for two Sundays and uh just telling the truth. And um one of the nights I was just, you know, cruising around and something happened at the Waffle House and uh I was just being nosy. So, I decided to pull over, talk to the employee, see what happened. And um you know it's as I talked to this guy it's uh not anybody thought I would be a believer at all. Um you know just the way he looked you know long hair and you know some tattoos which nothing wrong with it. It's just not somebody you would think firsthand would be believer and kind of had hippie vibe. And I was just talking to him and some point in the conversation you know he kind of just starts talking about God. Uh didn't expect that. And uh you know he kind of looks at me and he goes, "You know what, man? God's testing you." And um repeated that multiple times. And I remember as he left, you know, he said it again as he's walking away, he said, "God's testing you." And um it stuck with me. And you know, decided to come to church that Sunday and Brother Wayne was preaching and uh he said, you know, and I was in a really, really rough spot. And that's an understatement. But um and brother Wayne was preaching and he said, you know, God will, and paraphrase, I don't remember exactly how I said, you know, God will anoint somebody to, you know, out of a barroom or something like that, you know, just somebody that's not a believer to say something to you. And that stuck with me, but you know, with all the oppression that had going on, you know, Satan put all the stuff in my mind, you know, I felt like there was a Lord, but my thoughts just went to I failed the test. You know, I was a hypocrite. um let you know everybody at church down, my friends. Um so going into camp, you know, I just that's what I thought. I was a hypocrite. And um so I already made in my mind I was not going through the prayer line and I didn't just cuz you know I was too scared of what people would think. And um you know after the prayer line ended um you know it was dismissed and most people were gone. I remember I was kind of just sitting in my chair and disappointed, you know, that I, you know, I didn't want to live another year in, you know, the state I was in. And I I was just sitting there. I didn't know what to do, you know. And that's when uh brother Nick, right, you know, most people were gone, came into my aisle and started praying for me and real genuinely. And he prayed for me for a good bit and at some point it was very profound. You know, I had a lot of complexes, of course. you know, I just felt like something just left me. I got physically weak, but Nick was holding on to me tight, so I didn't fall. And um I remember it was really encouraging because, you know, it's easy to think it was an emotion or some sort. And Nick said, you know, hey, man, you I felt something leave you. And I'm like, that's interesting. I felt the same exact thing. And I remember at that moment, I was like, you know, now that that's gone, let me start praying to God. I really want to make my heart right. That's really the only thing I wanted out of camp. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know, I just couldn't get any words out. You know, I was just sitting there like, I don't know. I haven't prayed in a while. &gt;&gt; And I remember the only thing I could ask for was Lord, you know, I need somebody to lift me up in prayer. I need somebody to come here. And I remember there's a few brothers sitting in front of me and I was like, maybe him. And well, they got up and left and there was not that many people left in the building. And that's when um you know, and I was really I mean, I was desperate. You know, I didn't want to leave. You know, you know how brother Ram said, "You clean the house." And I knew I needed something else. And I was really desperate in my heart. You know, I just sat there and I was just waiting. I wasn't praying. I was just like, you know, thought, that's not how God works. You can't ask for something and it just comes. And I was praying for somebody to come pray with me. And that's when uh that's when Troy came in my aisle and he kind of looked at me and he said, "Hey man, I feel led to pray for you." And uh I'm like, "Well," I was like, "Okay." Well, I was literally waiting for somebody to do that, you know, and um he prayed for me and you know, I just lost it. Um I basically used him as a tissue, you know, um and I'm just I'm just so thankful, you know, and just presence, Lord, I felt it and you know, all that's gone. And I'm just glad for, you know, the people we have in church and, you know, the people led. I'm glad Troy listened to that voice. You know, I didn't know he was in the building. I'm just thankful. That's all I got from camp, you know. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] There's Sister Mandaline. I was looking for you. I just want to thank the Lord for what he's done. It just been a real blessing at camp. Brother Ben was right when he said it was going to be the best weekend of our lives. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I had been struggling a good bit this year and um had just let some things build up in my spirit toward the Lord, toward people, just I didn't think it was major, you know, just a little bit of bitterness or a little bit of whatever, but it had just started to wear on me. Um, and leading up to camp, I knew I was not in a good spot just mentally, emotionally, spiritually, you name it. I needed help. And, uh, I get to camp and for the first time in four years, I actually have to work. Uh, I didn't have an easest storm this year. I had a bit of a situation all weekend. Um, and that's it. It was interesting. So, I ended up missing um, a good amount of Thursday and Friday service. And then Saturday service I tried to stay in, but I was still out a little bit there. And again, like I went to camp to work. That's what I I had a burden to, but at the same time, it's just like that thought was in my head of but Lord, why do I always have to work? Like why can't I ever get the blessing? you know, these people will come and they have these epic Saturday night testimonies or they have these wonderful situations that happen and like the Lord has done stuff for me and I usually just weep and whail and ugly cry and that's it. And nothing wrong with that, but I was just like genuinely but also selfishly and kind of carnally like why can't I ever have anything more? Um, so I'm just sitting in my seat worshiping Saturday night and finally I decide to go ahead and go through the prayer line and and I was just, you know, at that point all I wanted was my joy back. I'm like, I don't really care about anything else. I just I feel like I've lost all joy of everything. I'm just going through the motions cuz I know it's right. Um, but that's not right. You're supposed to have more than that. So, I I get up to the the start of the prayer line and the songs that were being sung the whole time I was in the prayer line were just speaking to me, but I was just like, I I just want my joy. That's all I had on my my mind. And I get in the prayer line and Brother Wayne grabs a hold of me and uh like I went back and watched it and literally physically turned me to him and just like preached in my ear. And all I remember him saying was like something that the spirits that are are holding her be free and like she can like basically move forward. And I don't remember there was a bunch of other things said as I went through. Um and it got to the point where I was just crying out to the Lord. Like I wanted that. I I wanted just to be back. And um I I don't really remember much of the prayer line. I I blacked out and I think I had to be be carried over to a seat. And I remember just weeping and crying. And like when I came to um I just had this this genuine like thankfulness of like I'm not worthy. I I don't deserve his grace and his love and he he comes every time and just takes care of us. And I was just so overwhelmed and weeping with that. And I went back to my seat and like every time I would think about it, I would just start crying all over again. And I think I cried. I don't know. I thought it was just a couple hours. Turned out we were in there till like 108 is what I was told when I walked out. And the whole time I was just so thankful for his love and his grace and his goodness and everything that I didn't deserve as a human. And the young people were just slap happy and giggling. And it was just so precious to to watch the love from brother Nathan like just enjoying them being like that. And there was no no reproach, no pressure. It was just full liberty and love. And I just remember sitting in my seat like I wish I had strength to just run around screaming, "Look what the Lord has done." But I couldn't move. And I didn't think anything about that at the time um until I went to leave. And uh I thought I was fine. I gathered my stuff. I was aware that I was walking, but my toes weren't working. They felt longer than my feet. My knees weren't working. My body was kind of not right. And so I get out to the vestibule and my cousin Esther looks at me and goes, "Oh, Hannah, I don't know what I looked like, but apparently I sat down and she asked if I was a room leader and my eyes crossed and I don't know what I answered." And uh so I had to get carried uh to a golf cart, carried up my steps into my dorm. And I never had that happen before. And it just like made me realize the Lord hears like the desires of your heart and like he he will answer that. Um, and then in conjunction with that, part of my my interesting room all weekend, there was a situation and I was completely out of it on Saturday night. And I just really appreciate the staff and the support from Brother Nathan and the ministry that in an hour of need when I wasn't able to be there instead of, you know, being told I wasn't a good leader and should have been doing my job and not been in church getting drunk, they just stepped in and took care of everything. And like there was no no backlash for that. Just absolute love and support. And I really appreciate that and I'm thankful for what the Lord has done. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, we uh we get young people coming to the camp from I mean uh from situations darker than you can imagine sometimes. And uh there's all kinds of things that you just would never think that pop up during the week. And that's where I appreciate uh somebody like Sister Hannah, all our other dorm leaders, but she sure had the lion share this year. But uh but so anointed to be in that position, a minister with wisdom, with leadership uh just to make the right decisions and bring in the right people. And that that does so much to protect the testimony of the camp to to to to open a door for the Lord to touch lives. And so we so appreciate that service and Amen. and and that was a a testimony for me because a lot of those kind of things going on in the weekend. Uh we didn't get much time with our young people, which is usually priority number one. It's just to make some memories together. I missed almost all the volleyball games and just uh felt like we we didn't get a lot of the time together that I would like. last year, you know, uh the young people really lingered in the service and uh and just got drunk in the spirit, just enjoying it. And uh I missed that alto together last year. So God was good. Uh uh um Saturday night, right? We I was able to spend a little time after the service there. Some of our young people were lingering and uh we just had a special moment. You know, we just thank God for light hearts. uh these these young hearts carry so much heaviness of this world a lot of the time just to have a just to for God to have a place uh for laughter, for peace, for happiness, for light-heartedness. Uh that's such a blessing. That's such a blessing. And it's good to have that together. You know, uh if you don't travel around with these young people, you might not know, but I don't care where you're at and where they're having church. Uh our kids here will be the last ones out of the building every time. They know how to water that seed and they know just how to enjoy the presence of the Lord. And we thank God for that. Amen. We appreciate that, &gt;&gt; Kenzie. I came to camp with a lot of things on my heart. Um, anxiety and health issues. And uh actually last minute Saturday night right before before the prayer line, I had in my heart that I would have my own shout and my own unique dance. And I didn't want to look like anyone else. I just wanted my own my own experience. And I didn't tell anybody because it was super last minute. And I get up to the prayer line and I don't know if it happens to anyone else, but every single prayer line I've gone through, the minister that preaches never gets to pray for me fully cuz Brother Wayne grabs me. &gt;&gt; All right. Doesn't even let him. Just grabs me, speaks directly to me and tells me that he says, "Lord, you've given her every dream. You're making her dreams come true. I'm getting I got engaged and he said, "Make one more come true for her." And after that, I don't really remember much. And I specifically remember brother Matt McClard saying, "Uh, may my wall of Jericho fall tonight." And he says directly, "Give her her own unique shout." And I started yelling and the rest of the prayer line, people praying over my marriage and helping me to be a wife and a mom. one day and I just I and I had health issues right before the c the service that night. super weak in my knees and it was just really struggling that service and I was like man I cannot tonight and I every other prayer line I've been in my legs go out you know I have to be carried out and this one I walked I fully walked and was just led to a seat and I'm sh still shouting all the way to my seat and I'm praying and uh I don't even know if this she remembers this but sister Angela came and started praying over me and started speaking in tongues And I got a second experience and started yelling again. I couldn't even sit still while I was kneeling. I'm slamming my head on the seat in front of me and don't even know it. And I'm leaning forward and just just enjoying the presence of the Lord and still screaming out. And my mom told me she could hear somebody but didn't know. I was like, "That was me." And uh we're I'm testifying to them and I wasn't planning on testifying tonight. And my mom told me, "You need to tell somebody." I told Cara at the coffee shop and lucky brother Wayne walks in and he didn't get to hear it but I just I he specifically got what my priority was right before the prayer line and I'm still believing for the things I went through to come and uh you know what she probably doesn't want me. Abigail has a testimony of her own. My little sister has had nervousness for a very long time. Um she's seen a lot and he hurt a lot and she's just even at a young age has had a lot of mind battles keeps her up at night. She cries and she she's very attached and with this change coming it's going to be very hard and there was no climax in the service and I think it was brother Josh or brother and one of them brother Andrew was preaching and said specifically about nervousness give way and my sister starts screaming out and jumping. She had to hold on to the seat in front of her and she's just jumping up and down. A lot of a lot of people saw it and she ended up falling flat to the floor just screaming out to the Lord about nervousness and she claimed it. She's standing here today. She's fine at 9 years old. [Applause] [Music] I uh I know we're uh keeping the testimonies focused on the camp, but a lot of our young people go to the school here. Brother Richard u has a testimony to share about what the Lord's doing there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, as uh Nathan said, this testimony is about the school. Um the as many uh Bible believers school there in Lima, many of you know it, many of you young folks attend there. Um the about 15 months ago, I think it was the DAO Foundation that uh funded the school for 40 plus years found they were out of money and um it was a real existential crisis. The school was going to have to close. Bottom line. So we worked real hard. Many people uh prayed and worked on that. We worked out that we could get a charter from the state. We worked out we wouldn't have to teach about Paul and his two dads. We wouldn't have to teach common core math. We wouldn't have to compromise on our standards. We wouldn't have to. We wouldn't have to. Nothing. So, credit to Am I allowed to give credit to Republican government in state of Ohio for that? Okay. Seriously. So, no compromise is needed and that's a amazing thing. So, we applied for the charter. Um I just realized sitting here um they the state needs has to come and inspect the school. They will they won't do that in the last week of school. So the last day they would come was May the 16th and they couldn't come because they had so many things going on. Um and they made a special exception and they came on May the 20th. I just looked that up. It suddenly struck me. Any of you good at math? The difference between 16 and 20 is 4 days. They were 4 days late. And we got the charter. So we got that in June. So this is just two months ago. And uh so you know we've been working on the budget and what can we afford and so on and uh we sat there in a board meeting about just about a month ago and we're looking at all the numbers. How much will we get from the charters the SGOs's that many of you gave to you know you redirected your tax money from giving to the state of Ohio to giving to Bible believer school. Thank you raised 60,000 from that. Thank you to everybody who contributed to that uh and redirected your tax money. We will be doing that again this year by the way. So uh get ready for that. Um but the we looked at all the numbers and it was just really tight. We had 69 students enrolled which was up which was answer to prayer and it was super tight and we're looking through all the numbers and we could do it but it was just tight. It was pressure on all the different categories. There's pressure on could we you know do this do that. It was just really tight. So, I remember I I was sitting there. I'm looking at all the numbers and playing with them and it just struck me that we needed we had 69. We just needed to get to 80. I felt like if we could get to 80 and I put that 80 in the spreadsheet and everything looked better. The numbers look better. The numbers look fine. I said and I looked up I remember I looked up straight but brother Paul Priest was sitting right opposite me. I said, "Brother Paul, looks like we need to get to 80." And he looked straight back and said, "Yeah, I worked out the same thing. 80 students. That's what we need." So, I said, "Well, that's that's that's what we're going to pray for. 80 students there. So, so that was that was a month that was less than a month ago. I think it was about 3 weeks. We're at 69 and then we got another three and then we got another four and if I get the math wrong, forgive me. And we got another two and we got to 78 and that was uh last week. School started yesterday, by the way. So, it was last week we got to 78. And I was like, "Praise God, 78." Difference between 78 and 80, who cares? It's fine. But God cared. God cared. School started yesterday. On Monday, we got final two registrations to get to exactly 80. Not 81, not 79, but exactly to what we were praying for. So, I just want to give glory to God. Um, you know, so many of you have prayed and helped with the school. Again, it was like the school was literally going to have to close, but as of now, we got more students than we've had. I don't know if it's forever because uh but for a very long time for 20 plus years that's more students than we've ever had at the school. U I was there for opening day yesterday and many of you were there new teachers and so on and there was just such a joy and such a peace and such a reassurance from God that he was behind the efforts 100% and he was so gracious that he didn't give us didn't settle for 78. I settled for 78. Good grief. He gave us exactly the number we were praying for. So, I just want to give all glory to God. Thank you, Lord. [Music] [Applause] Like to get just one or two more of the young people if we can and then we'll probably bring it down to a close tonight. Here you buddy. um more related about camp, but uh so for a while I've been struggling with like anxiety for like what people would think about me if I did a certain thing. And brother Andrew was preaching about like fear and anxiety is under our feet and hope it's gone now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] if the musicians want to comment. I uh don't usually do this. It's my first time here and my first time at camp this year &gt;&gt; and it really opened my eyes. Um I just want to thank the Lord for that and I want to thank the Lord for the opportunity of going to camp this year. &gt;&gt; Um that's all. Thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; That's brother Kaden. If you want to go up and say hi after service and make him feel welcome among us. We're sure happy to have him. Um, in my thanks uh of everybody, of course, I left somebody out. Got reminded uh forgot to thank the soundmen. Ain't that a classic? So, if you can hear me through this microphone, why don't you why don't you appreciate the sound, man? [Applause] [Music] If you don't mind me slipping in a personal testimony just at the end here as we close. Um last year uh my wife had a surgery kind of a post-natal hernia surgery and uh something happened with the anesthesia there. Uh she reacted to it really badly and ever since then um we've had a real battle with anxiety. uh just right around the time the sun would go down a nervousness would come in just you know just irrational and knowing it's irrational but um just that just those physical symptoms of that uh been and different things feeding into that so it's been a battle uh so you know uh coming Saturday night uh brother Andrew's preaching just on speaking the word and a point that he made just settled my heart the inspiration came uh so clearly to me that it was time it was time to say speak something to that situation. So I just uh I just began to rebuke that spirit that's been working in my home and uh and and just going in for that kill. You know this is this is it driving down a steak. Um you know right at just just within moments of that brother Andrew took a little turn. He began to tell a story about brother Brandham talking to a mother. Remember back in the left corner and uh and uh it just was so precisely, you know, to to the fears that come and torment a mother's mind who's dealing with nervousness and those different things. And I and I I looked and I looked, you know, uh where Cheyenne would usually be sitting. I thought, "Oh, she's out with the baby." You know, you know how it is for a mother. Uh they they they just can't be in the service all the time. I thought, "Ah, she's she's not hearing this." But I I still knew it was the Lord. But then I looked over this way and for the first time the whole weekend she had come in that left door and she was right where brother Andrew was pointing and describing brother Brandham dealing with that issue. I could just see on her countenance that the Lord was working on that end too. And by the grace of God uh from that time uh sun up, sun down, uh fear and nervousness has left our home. That devil's defeated. [Music] You know, that that was such a a major point in the ministry this weekend. Uh such a major thing that our young people are dealing with. And it just you could feel it in the air uh from the first day on the camp. Just a a tension and a nervousness there. And uh and and so, you know, the devil was really fighting the meeting in general with that spirit. But uh but you know as as uh by that Saturday night as the faith was beginning to build from the ministry of the word, you could just feel that slip away from the room. See so many young people get a breakthrough. And I believe a son or daughter of God doesn't have to carry fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to carry nervousness. Amen. There there's no fear in love. Amen. But we've been given the spirit of power. Amen. Of love. Of a sound mind. And so we just thank God for deliverance. Thank God for victory. Amen. And uh how many how how many just just in a general testimony, how many were got a special touch from the Lord at camp? Amen. How many how many got something out of the ministry? How many enjoyed yourself in worship? How many just had a good time? Hasn't hasn't God been good. Amen. God is so good, friends, and we've been so blessed and Amen. It's just not hard to see what the Lord has done. So no wonder we got a heart of worship. I mean, how could we not praise him for everything that he has done? and he's poured out abundantly of his blessings, of his goodness, and and we just appreciate him for it. Amen. How many love the Lord? Amen. Let's just uh take a few moments to worship him then. You got a song to me. Precious are his thoughts of you and me. No way I could count. Maybe you'd like to stand and just make this your testimony. Oh, so I'll just thank him for being so kind. God has been good, so good. I have been blessed [Music] when he walks among us. All that he does. All of his mercy and all of his love. If the pen of the rider could ride every day, even this world could never contain. How much I' been blessed. I have been blessed. God so good to me. Precious are his thoughts of you. No way I could count. There's enough time. Oh, just thank you for [Music] God. So good.

Oh, I have been blessed. God so good to me. Oh, precious are his thoughts of you and me. No way I could count him. There's not enough time. So, I'll just thank him for being so kind. God has been good. So good. I have been blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God has been good. So good. I have been God has been good. Has he been good to you? God has been good. So good. I have been blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful testimony of the wonderful things that God has done. And Amen. to uh to see the the glory and the power and the contact the Holy Spirit has made with these youth. Amen. into the youth meetings, the camp. Amen. I think it's turned into more than just a youth meeting. Amen. Everyone's hearts are are excited and not just for our church, but for the community and those that are around it. And we want to thank the Lord for it. And we certainly uh appreciate each one of you that has been involved in this. And I want to thank Nathan, Amen, for his for his dedication to this and and the hours uh that he places in it. And of course, uh, they they call them Uncle Nate and Uncle Ronnie at the camp. And, uh, I hear everywhere I go, uh, people talking about these camps. They said, "Man, we are so blessed." I was just sharing the meeting with Brother Donnie Reagan there. I missed the Thursday night because we were doing the mission camp meeting there. And Brother Reagan said to me, he said, "Brother Wayne," he said, "Some of the young people, my granddaughters, they enjoy that camp above all they do through the year. They just so enjoy that camp." and and we we appreciate the Lord for allowing uh this to be a great blessing to them. And you know, u we we thank brother Nathan for that. He's kind of a he's a real kind of a little bit of a political diplomatic fell at times. He sent me the the final bill for this camp just before the testimony service. Uh I felt a lot better about it after the testimony service. I I was I was I was making the figures come out per testimony. I think I'm doing pretty good now. This is this feels a lot better. It's not too late for you to for you to get involved. Amen. So, but uh it's it's uh if our trustees and our senior pastor for forgive me for my expenditures over the weekend, I think it's money well spent. And we so appreciate each of you for your giving. And we so we so love you all. And my heart is full. I &gt;&gt; I uh sit here tonight and listen to these things. If I talk much, I'll I'll be crying ugly as Hannah says. Uh my heart is so full to hear of the wonders and the riches of of the God of Abraham. How that he would visit our our humble abodess and &gt;&gt; uh that he would step behind uh this this presence would come and minister and make real this. If you heard these testimonies, you hear a lot. He he did this and he did that. And &gt;&gt; I just love to hear that that Amen. &gt;&gt; He talking about that wonder, wonderful, awesome, wonderful God. And I I love the um how, you know, God uses men, but I loved how much was spoken about him &gt;&gt; and not so much about the minister or the one doing the praying, &gt;&gt; but the God that was doing the touching. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I'm so thankful for that tonight that we're setting him forward as being the living God who ministers and touches and and these these great uh prayer meetings uh have been effective and each of you that chose children and youth through this through this time and your prayers uh I know that you've been rewarded in hearing how God has ministered and what he's done. And we we want to thank you each of you. And I I was just listening to some of the camp songs and um I I I'm so proud of what's what's happening with our youth and the development of the gifts and uh the the refining of these these musicians and brother Ben, sister Lily that they're spending so much effort and work in in bringing out these wonderful gifts and this youth and the choirs and things and and you know, but uh we were just listening to it on the way to church. Um, no fear. I just we were we were just moving to that no fear and Chris and I were just discussing the the choirs and and we were discussing the cleanness of these young people and uh we we have beautiful young ladies. the the I don't you parents are blessed with you beautiful young ladies and but but but modest and godly and and it it is just brother brother Ray is just such a testament &gt;&gt; to the cleanness of this gospel and not that we beat everybody up every week with a with a standard but there's a there's a spirit that exists in this church &gt;&gt; that people want to live right and they want to dress right and and I I thank you I thank each of you for it and my my heart is just full tonight. So, I I you know, um I I just want to say thank you and we we're we're so proud and so honored uh to be a part of you and and to be able to call you our church. It it it's the greatest honor of our life and we love you so much and thank you for that. Amen. And Amen. Brother, uh just as we would maybe just close our eyes and bow our hearts and let's just have a word. Sorry, sister Martin. Okay. Yeah, sister Becca uh Mark and and brother Seth are not here tonight. Becca's having having some issues and we need to if we can just remember her in a word of prayer tonight. Father, as we bow our hearts tonight and Lord, with our hearts so full, we want to thank you from the depths of our soul. I want to thank you for all that you've done, Lord. And Lord, you're you're such a faithful God. how the sisters started this service singing about your faithfulness and how we've seen it through the years. We've seen you faithfully, Lord, how you answer the hearts and how you've met them and and Lord, to hear time after time that you would that you would meet these young people in their need and then Lord, give them a testimony that you're alive. I thank you for it. And tonight we ask you for Becca, Lord, that you would touch her body, that you would strengthen her, Lord, that whatever this is that's resting on her, Father, that you would break the powers of it even now, Lord, while we pray together as an assembly. Satan, you are defeated. &gt;&gt; My Lord conquered you 2,000 years ago at Calvary, and you're a defeated enemy. And we rebuke you, Satan, that you take your hands away from God's children. Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight for the grace that you've given, for the blessing, Lord, for each one that you've made apart. Lord, we thank you for it, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. We love you all. Be praying. Hopefully, Sunday we'll be speaking to you and just uh just be be praying and greet one another as we go tonight. keep us in your heart. Amen. Brother Ben, could we sing that song? Uh, God has been good. So good. Um, he's been good. [Music] God's been good in my &gt;&gt; This is my theme song lately. I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night. Though I've had my share of hard times, wouldn't change them if I could. Cuz through it all, God's been true. [Music] Lately, I've been looking back along this winding road to the old familar markers of the mercies as I have. I know it may sound simple, but it's more than a shame. There's no better way to tell you than to say God's been in my life. I feel bless when I go to sleep. Though I had my share of hard times, I wouldn't change everything if I could. Cuz through it all, God times we play. And I can see that I've cried some bit tears. But I've felt his arms around me as I face my greatest fears. You see, I've had more gaze than loses. And I no more joy later as his grace roll down upon me uner. Oh God saints you're dismissed in my life. I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night. And though I've had my share of hard times, I wouldn't change them if I could. Cuz through it all, God's been good. God's been good. God's been good in my life. [Music] I feel blessed beyond the wild dreams when I go to sleep each night. Though I've had my share of hard times, I wouldn't change them if I could. Cuz through it all, [Music] God's been good. singing thank you Jesus for the grace that you have given us. I could never repay.
