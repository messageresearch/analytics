He didn't ask what the circumstance was. You said it. &gt;&gt; We believe it. &gt;&gt; And we can move unmovable things. And we can change things that were not possible. And they become possible because we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I thank God this morning that he made it he made it so uh simple and so easy &gt;&gt; when that man came before the Lord Jesus and his child was falling in the fire and he described the situation to the Lord. He said Lord your disciples have not been able to help me. &gt;&gt; He said but but could you do something about this? &gt;&gt; And the Lord looked back at him and said can thou believe. &gt;&gt; The question is not whether God can do it. The question lays on, do we believe? &gt;&gt; And I say, God, help our unbelief. &gt;&gt; Increase our faith, Lord. Build our hearts toward him. Amen. What a wonderful morning. Amen. To serve the Lord. And Amen. to What a beautiful song service and worship service. Amen. How many's got the joy this morning? &gt;&gt; No. No. I mean, like joy, the real kind of stuff. How many got joy this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the kind that makes the the top pop off. You know, the kind that makes you get up in the morning say, "I'm drinking from my saucer cuz my cup's done overflow. That kind of joy. The kind of joy you got enough for yourself and some for your neighbor." Amen. You got enough for your neighbor this morning. &gt;&gt; You got enough joy for your neighbor this morning. Turn around, tell them say, "I got joy for me and you." &gt;&gt; If you if you having a bad day, that's I got joy for me and I got joy for you. Amen. I got double joy this morning cuz I've been saved and sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; You ought to be the happiest person on the face of the earth today. I'm a Christian. I'm not a Christian because I was good. I'm a Christian because he elected me. He made me. He called me. And I accepted it. Amen. And I say, "Hell, you better get out of the way because I'm a Christian. There is a host of angels about me and God has set in front of me and his presence can make mountains move. It can make trees move. It can make rivers move. It can make devils move. &gt;&gt; Cuz we're saints of God on our way to the very thing that God said we could have. &gt;&gt; And I got joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I refuse to be sad and downtrodden and depressed. I got joy. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's one thing the devil can't take from me &gt;&gt; is my joy. &gt;&gt; He didn't give it to me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The world didn't give it to me. &gt;&gt; No. No. &gt;&gt; So they can't have it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. I'm going to keep it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning? What a &gt;&gt; what a blessing to be in the house of God on a Sunday morning. Amen. Amen. If you um maybe just before we read the word of God, we bow our heart and in a word of prayer and thanksgiving and uh you know sometimes we come to the Lord and we ask him for things. When's the last time you went to him and just spent about a minute telling him what you think about him &gt;&gt; and about the glory of his presence and the power of his existence. &gt;&gt; All right. And then when you praised him just a little while, &gt;&gt; oh yes, &gt;&gt; the things you're about to ask him to do are going to be very small. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts. Father, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As many times your prophet would call you the author of creation, the father of us all. And Lord, to you whom hung the heavens, the sun, the moon just rolled off of your hand. The stars were blown into existence. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Just one word from you, Lord. Every tree, every bird, &gt;&gt; the waters filled the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The earth itself hangs in the heavens, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, before I knew you, before I knew this earth, you knew me, my name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You knew my parents. You knew the place of my birth. &gt;&gt; You knew the moment that I would come to know you. &gt;&gt; You aligned the stars and the heavens that would bring us to this earth, Lord. And then you place us together in a place like this this morning. And Lord, you are who are in supreme control of all things. We invite you that you would have your liberty this morning in this building. That your grace, Lord, would overflow our lives. Lord, it's been told us of the word of God that we're free moral agents. That we have a choice. And Lord, if I'm given a choice, I choose you. I choose to serve you in my troubled times. I choose to worship you when things are heavy. I choose to love you whether I'm on the mountain or in the valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you are the adoration of all my praise and all of my hopes and all of my life. &gt;&gt; Lord, without you, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're less than nothing. &gt;&gt; But because of you, Lord, we have a wonderful place to worship this morning. We have a family. We have life in our hearts. We have faith in our souls. And Lord, you that done that for me, you'll do that for anyone that would ask. And I pray this morning to the congregation that's gathered. Lord, if there be one that don't know you in that way, may you express yourself to them this morning. And may the great inspiration of the Holy Spirit use this meeting, Lord. And may you walk the aisles here this morning. If there's one of your children that's locked in the bars of misunderstandings, Lord, or some wrong spirit has got their mind, I pray you'd release them this morning, Lord. May they leave this building this morning as the two left that room that morning, saying, "Did not our hearts burn?" &gt;&gt; Lord, when they realize that you're alive and that you still move in your presence? And I pray this morning that the great witness of that resurrection would be among us. Lord, &gt;&gt; we ask you for these things now. take your word, speak to your children, Lord, and do that which only you could do. We thank you for it, Father, in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And God bless you. As I invite you to the word of the Lord this morning, I I want to go into the book of Philippians, the third chapter. Uh if you have your Bibles, Philippians chapter 3, we want to welcome all the visitors among us. And God bless you all. And it's certainly a great honor to have you here with us. And amen, we are a we are a place of gathering of eagles and believers that believe in this great end time message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which has exalted our Lord Jesus back to the head of the body. &gt;&gt; So our our adoration and our praises to his name. So if you love him like we love him, you you feel free to worship him in the word or in the praise and just just enjoy yourself within our gates. In Philippians chapter 3 and verse 12, not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after. Now Paul is not going to allow his imperfections or his troubles change his directions. I follow after if that I may apprehend that which I also am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Now, brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, &gt;&gt; forgetting the things which are behind me, &gt;&gt; all right? &gt;&gt; And reaching forth unto the things. And I love the way he says things because he doesn't detail because your things are different than his things. My things are different than your things, but there's things. &gt;&gt; True. So the things which are behind you and you're reaching forth under things which are before you. And then he tells you what thing was before him. I press toward the mark &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. May God bless his word as you could be seated this morning. I want to speak to you again. I'm I'm I'm off of that opening the word series again this morning. And I'm going to speak to you again on spiritual amii ambitions part two. Amen. Uh I just uh just have a lot of things in my heart concerning it. So I want to I want to revisit it. The spiritual amnesia or spiritual ambition part two. Of course a lot of times when you say the word ambition, you know, everybody thinks something negative, but I don't want to use it in a negative connotation. I want to use it in a positive that you might see that that it's not always wrong to have ambition. It's just what according is your ambition. That's what that's what matters is what is the ambition. And and the prophet of God says, "An eagle stareth their nest." God likens his heritage unto the eagles. Amen. How many eagles we got here this morning? Amen. Eagles. And where the carcass is, they're the eagles will gather. So you're you're God's children. You're likened unto eagles. Amen. Uh you're you're an eagle because another thing an eagle does, the eagle builds its nest up high. And how oft uh uh many times I got off my horse and tied to a little sapling and got my binoculars and searched the skies to find an eagle to study him in high in the Rockies and and the eagle builds his nest just as high as he can build it. See, it's safety and protection. He said it's so high until the predators can't get to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that brother Brandham actually said the problem with Billy Graham's ministry was he built his nest too low? He said, "So the snakes got in and got his his young." &gt;&gt; Amen. But eagles build their nest way up high. Amen. Way up high in the mountain. That's where the nest is built. And brother says, "Oh, that's the reason God likens his church under the eagle." He says, "Because the eagle's nest, which is the church, the eagle's nest, which is the church." He says, "It's built far beyond the cares of the world. It's out of the danger line. See, it's crossed the blood with a modern prowling of predators. never get to it. He said, "You're a city that setits on a hill. A candle that's lit in the room." Oh, something. The church of the living God is built on high ambitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have a high ambition? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see when I hear the church that hasn't got any ambition to grow, there's something wrong with that church? The church of the living God has a high ambition. And another thing, the church of God is built high because it's anticipations and expectations. He people say, "Well, we belong to our church and our father served in this church." He said, "That might be fine, but the church of the living God can't sit still there." See, its ambitions has got to go a little higher, a little farther. We We want to see the blind healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are watching tomorrow for the dead to be raised. When we see nature obey his voice, we're looking for the coming of Christ, its ambitions is high and its anticipations is high. Its inspe expectations are high because it's built high. Amen. As eagles, we are we're a different kind of bird. We're we're not built for the ground. You know, I think of the beauty of the of the examples of the creatures of how that we were teaching out of the Revelation series and Brother Bam said there was a lion and there was a man, there was an ox and then there was an eagle. But you watch that last one. It's not just an eagle. It's actually a flying eagle. Amen. And and you know, none of those other creatures go high on the mountain. But but when you speak about capstone age and you talk about the eagle age and and what you're talking about, it's when it goes high up on the mountain. So the church of the living God will never be satisfied in the valleys. Now I I know that I know that eagles can get in blowdowns and and brother Bam seen one one time in a blowdown. He and he said that he said it was an eagle in a blowdown. So there's a difference if it's a sparrow in the blowdown or if it's a hawk in a blowdown or if it's an eagle in a blowdown. And and if it's an eagle in the blowdown, amen, then that eagle still has its wings. It has the ability to to rise out of that. Amen. On the winds of God. And and and eagles are not ones with great fear. So So Brother Bam is giving us examples of of being able to know that it's an eagle. and and and and the spiritual ambition, amen, that's in the church. See, we can get low, but that don't mean it has to stay low. Like if you go through something as an individual, I think it's David that wrote it and he says, see, that we should have our youth renewed as the eagle. And and you know that I don't know how many uh how many uh details that we have that are exact because I'm not an eagle scientist, but but you know, brother Ram talks about the renewing of an eagle. Amen. He said it's the only bird that can get all the way down and then come all the way back to its youth again. And and and there's what they call a moloten stage where where they have to kind of rebirth themselves somewhere's along their age. And and I've seen uh Christians go through these kinds of things and I've seen them get real low and struggle through moments in their lives. But but see those times don't change what you are. They don't they don't make you a hawk or they don't they don't make you some kind of other animal. You're an eagle. And if you're an eagle, you was an eagle to begin with. And that's a nature. And then we'll renew that eagle. Amen. And and and an eagle, amen, it it's able to fly. See, it's able to it's able to get in the ambitions of God. See, God can have an ambition or God can have something, but other birds are not fit to fly in that realm or that or that way. But see, when God made you that, he made you that way for an ambition. Now, um, when you talk about spiritual ambition, it's the, uh, let me just give you a little bit of a my definition here. It's a relentless pursuit of God's purposes. &gt;&gt; It It's not a a selfish gain for for uh, for my kingdom, but it's a game for his kingdom. Amen. It's about wanting more of God for God. Amen. It's more about his presence. It's more about him working through us. Amen. In in the church age book, Brother Bannon will say this. He'll say, "See, those in the bride will only do his will." Now, that's the difference between Satan looking for a throne, amen, and the bride looking for a throne. See, they will only do his will. See, the bride, Amen, will actually live in harmony with the father. &gt;&gt; How many knows that? Brother said, "The same harmony that existed in the son will also exist in the bride." There'll be a harmony in there. Amen. I love that word harmony. Don't you? Do you know you can't get harmony on one string? &gt;&gt; Do you know you can't get harmony on one string? When you hear somebody riding the same string all the time, that's not a harmony. That's one part of the message in which usually it has a direction. You know, you you get somebody, they lean on a certain thought all the time. They're leaning, leaning, leaning. That that's what it is. It's not harmony. Amen. They're disccluding all the other strings, you know. Amen. So that you can get harmony on one string. I I love a symphony. Don't you? I love the harmony of a symphony. The beautiful thing about the Church of the Living God. Brother Brandham taught us it's a bit like a symphony. Amen. And Brother said, you know, sometimes God will call you, Amen, for one little thing. Amen. There's maybe a preacher called for one sermon or maybe a believer called for one witness or or maybe God puts you in here to be a deacon or a trustee or whatever. But there's a harmony that exists. Amen. A according to the word of God, you know. Amen. You ever you ever anybody ever watched I used I actually watched the uh the orchestra or the symphony. Uh brother Bam talked about Peter and the Wolf. So I went and looked it up and watched it because I wanted to see what one really looked like, you know, and and there's no actors on the stage. There's no birds. There's no wolf. There's no nothing. There's a French harp and there's a bass drum and there's a there's all kinds of different instruments, you know, a and and each instrument represented a certain thing. And then that instrument, Brother Bram says, "Watch it." Now, when it begins to sound, it's sounding with the sheet music. It's telling a story. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so when the symphony comes in, it's beautiful because one man will come out and and the thing's kind of in disarray, you know, and all of a sudden he'll kind of tap him in. He'll kind of tap his little stick there and he'll hold that stick and all of a sudden that whole symphony starts getting in his sway. Amen. And you know, the the drummer don't drum, right? It ever every ever beat. and and and the and the French harp don't hit every beat. And you know, sometimes they just sit there and they're waiting for that moment when it strikes. You know, it's kind of like a church service. You know, there when a man of God's preaching and he's reading quotes and he's laying down, he's building a principle. And if you get somebody just trying to yell right there, they're taking away the attention from the word being produced in that moment. So if you'll wait just a moment, the whole symphony in a minute, it'll hit that high point and and the whole church will go amen. Now that's when you stand and that's when you Amen. But if you start getting out of sync, then it starts becoming less about the conductor conducting and more about the player playing. Amen. You got a guy overbeating on the drum and and it's supposed to be the French heart playing. Then it becomes confusion. See, then that's the reason there's an orchestra. There's a there's a rhythm to the things of God. Amen. You know, and usually somebody really likes to beat on their instrument. Amen. They'll look around the rest of the church. Why ain't y'all hitting on your instrument? You know, there's nothing wrong with their abilities. What it is is there's an order to it and there's a a moving of the spirit and they're wondering, "Amen. When you going to wait on the sheet music, you know, so so there's a there's a way that things are are transpiring. There's a there's a movement of the Holy Ghost. We're built higher than one amen or we're built higher than one service." Amen. Yet see this message is supposed to work in and through the bride in harmony and in the will of God. See, see those in the bride will only do his will. Amen. He he, brother Bam says he didn't complete all of his work when he was here in his earthly ministry. &gt;&gt; See now, so he works in and through his bride. So you are actually his body on the earth. And when God gets ready to do something, you're going to be the vessel that God works through. See what it is. Now the prophet will say this in kinsman redeemer. He'll say now we want to draw this first into our mind that there's not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of him who created us has been fulfilled. See the God that created you. Amen. Also has a purpose for your life. Amen. And you cannot live in a place in your life thinking, Amen, that all of a sudden that you could just be squashed out like a bug because you're living in a in a in a in a realm where you're always it seems like you can't you can't live in victory and you can't live in joy because you're always worried about it. But the prophet said, "The guy that built you, the one that built you built you for a purpose." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you got to get along with that God and figure out what your purpose is. Amen. You got to figure out what's the purpose that God has for me. Now, I can't give you that purpose. I I can't tell you you're built for this and you're built for this and you're built for this. That alone comes from God. You have to get in prayer. And then as you as you pray, the Holy Spirit begins to reveal to you your position in the word of God. And and then when you find that purpose, I want you to know this now. There is nothing can destroy you until that purpose that God had for you is fulfilled. My when I think about that, the prophet of God said, "If you were put here for a purpose, then there is nothing that can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled for us, nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us for has made himself manifest." No matter how much trouble we have, Amen. How much heartaches or how much sorrows that we go through, all of these things are reasons. And there is a reason for it. Now, now I know this. I'm going to read a scripture the devil hates more than any scripture in this Bible. And we know that all things work together for the good that them that love God and to them that are called according to his purpose. I believe this morning I am talking to the called of God. I don't believe you just showed up at True Word Tabernacle. I believe our lives are harder than that. Amen. I believe that God, amen, in his great destiny and his plan anointed you, called you, sent you, Amen, and brought you to this place. He displayed the greatest omnipotence the world has ever saw to get you in this building. God called you to this. Jesus said, "No man can come to me unless my father first draw him." Amen. If God hadn't have called you, you wouldn't be here this morning. If God hadn't beckoned you, there would have been a drug that could have kept you. There could have been a bar that would have held you. There would have been a church house and some denomination that would have kept you on their books. But because God called you, because God called you, there was nothing that could prevent your coming. And once you come to him, there is nothing that can destroy you until that purpose is done. David and I say that are to give a liberty of the house of God. We are to have such a joy this morning. Amen. I don't have enough money, but I've been called of God. I don't Amen. I'm going through struggles, but I've been called of God. There's problems, but I've been called of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there is a purpose for my life, and all things work together for the good of them that have love God &gt;&gt; and are called according to his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I've always been amazed at the psychology side of that because the world itself uses purpose. Amen. As a way to drive companies and they they drive uh uh even in the nominal world, they they you've got to have purpose, right? It it's cuz God built you to have purpose. But don't never mix up your purpose, personal purpose &gt;&gt; with God's purpose. Now, God's purpose, many you hear them, God's got a purpose. God's got a purpose. Once a while, I stop and go, well, you know, I wish they'd tell us what his purpose is. &gt;&gt; But, but we've got a message where it tells you the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Now, in Colossians 1, brother, remember, brother reads it and he said, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." That's the purpose of God. And brother breaks it into a three-fold revelation. He said, watch this. The first purpose is for God to reveal himself so that that revelation can get in a body and become perminent and then that preeminent revelation will carry a body of people back to the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; So the first thing he had to do is reveal that in Christ Jesus. And when the revelation come into Christ Jesus, now that that God poured into Christ is poured into the church. Amen. So God's purpose is he he sends a message to declare that. He sends a word to declare that and God has invited you into that purpose. See, you are the claimed body of Jesus Christ. Now if if we could to be aware this morning that God before the foundations of the world and called you and anointed you for this section of life, then then you could recognize that you are predestinated. You're called. And because you're called, you're already glorified. How many knows that that you're already glorified? How many knows that you're already glor It's the Bible. You're already glorified. Now, now with that state of mind, you are prepared to meet anything that Satan would throw at you. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter what comes at you, you are now prepared to face that. And know this coming at me has nothing to do with whether God loves me or not. It has nothing to do with whether I'm loved of God or whether I'm a good Christian or a bad Christian. But because my Bible said they that live godly in Christ shall suffer persecutions. Amen. The Bible said many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God shall deliver them from them all. So afflictions and troubles and situations has nothing to do with the idea I'm called or uncalled. Come on, y'all know I'm in the message. Cloudy days are not a sign of God's disapproval. And sunny days are not a sign of his approval. He loves you because he said he loves you. He said it. I believe it. And I'll stand on it. In the midst of my troubles, in the midst of my cloudy days, I'll be saying Jesus loves me. Yes, I know because the Bible told me so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I I've been around a minute. I know how dominating and manipulative demon spirits are. They want you to do something, you have trouble, and all of a sudden that's God's judgment till you do what I want you to do. &gt;&gt; It was a real revelation to me, brother Mike, if you're part of a certain group and you have a real tragedy hit you, that's God's trials giving you character. But if you ain't a part of that group and you don't agree with their doctrine, that's God's judgment because you have transgressed the word of God. Isn't it something how men use the word to manipulate the situation they want it to fit? Amen. But I'll tell you this, if you see me going through something, you just say God's working on that boy. He's getting him ready for a millennium because my destination is already set. My ambition is to be a son of God. I didn't show up, Amen, to quit the first time I had trouble. I didn't I didn't show up to sit down the first time that struggles come to my life. But God filled me with the Holy Ghost to get me all the way. He sealed me. And when he seals you, the train's going to go through high spots, low spots. It's going to rock back and forth. But brother, if God put a seal on you, it'll hold you through the trial. &gt;&gt; It'll hold you through the struggle. It'll hold you through the problems. I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; My If I was a singer right now, I'd break out in song. Amen. I'm going through. I'm going through. &gt;&gt; No matter the price or whatever others do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, in that position, you you you can resist the devil. &gt;&gt; In that position, you can resist the devil. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. If you read this, resist the devil, he'll flee from you. But don't never forget the first part of that. &gt;&gt; There you go, brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Submit yourselves therefore to God. &gt;&gt; Ain't it beautiful? Humble thyelves and he will exalt thee. &gt;&gt; See, submit and then resist. &gt;&gt; If you're submitted, you got every right to resist. &gt;&gt; My Bible tells me that if one can make a thousand flee. &gt;&gt; That two can make 10,000 flee. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, when you get the devil on the run, just keep him on the run. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know, don't take a break. &gt;&gt; Keep him moving. &gt;&gt; Put some distance between you and that enemy. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, you see, he if you if you start resisting, he won't just walk away. He'll flee. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, resist the devil the same way our chief captain told us to do. Take that word and resist the devil. &gt;&gt; See, take that word. Take how you resist the devil is by the word of God. How do I do it, Brother Wayne? By the word of God. &gt;&gt; You can't resist with what you don't know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you don't know that that word spoke for you and gave you, you can't resist with what you don't know. &gt;&gt; Well, why do you think the enemy is attacking the word before he attacks you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows if he attacks you and you have the word, he's lost his battle. So, he attacks the word, then he attacks you. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God said, "See, we're taught to resist the devil. He will flee from us." Now, resist is to just simply turn him down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No matter what he's trying to tell you, you don't even listen to him. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Your ears are deaf to anything else. &gt;&gt; To he that has an ear &gt;&gt; that listens. See what the spirit saith unto the churches. one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches. &gt;&gt; To he that has an ear. See, because if you can hear it, you can speak it. And how many remembers several years ago, I actually preached a whole sermon on a woman I met down in Arkansas around the 4th of July, actually. And she was in Carl'sbad, New Mexico, and she was telling me, she found out I believe Brother Brand was a prophet, and she started testifying. She said, "I was in a meeting in Carl'sbad." And one of our neighbors, who was about a 18-year-old girl, was in the meeting and said she had never heard in her life. She was completely deaf and mute. And she come up in the prayer line, Brother Brandham prayed for her and said her ears come open. And he said when when when when the ears come open, the reason we all knew it was he says, "Brother Brandham whispered in her ear but put a mic in front of her mouth." And said when brother Bram would say he he would say uh he said say mama. And he says when brother Bram whispered mama said she spoke mama in the mic. Amen. Because if you can hear it, you can say it. See you if you if you're not hearing good, you're not saying good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan tries to twist how you're hearing. See? But if you can hear it, you can say it. Now, to he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit says. Amen. Then that's why the prophet said, "See that bride will speak the same word that he speaks." You You see the prophet, the bride, Amen. And the spirit will be speaking the same thing. &gt;&gt; And what they said would have already been in the Bible. See, the spirit gives the word. And if you have the spirit, you'll hear the word for your age. And true Christians took the word for their age. Amen. What is it? That word becomes the inspiration of the church. &gt;&gt; It becomes uh the leadership of the church. Let me just say, Amen. Uh you you you say, "Well, brother Wayne, why do you do it the way you do it?" It's because I was inspired from the message to believe a certain way on something. Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the inspiration, see some people get their inspirations from different places. Our inspiration comes from the message of the hour. So it inspires us to believe a certain way, to think a certain way, to do a certain way. Amen. And and I believe personally very clearly that this is the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we have received the mind of Christ. I I don't think that the message of the hour was just a fleshly mind of a man William Brandom. Amen. But I certainly believe it was the mind of Christ who brought pre-incarnate knowledge into a preacher and he would stand there and tell you about things that n amen I don't want to preach too long in it but it's beautiful in the beginning God created the heavens and earth. You going listen to brother Bam. He said now before that [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; in the beginning God then now now before that &gt;&gt; come on who had that kind of knowledge. It wasn't that eighth grade education William Brandham that Kuckian that couldn't say pullpit correctly. It was that dynamic gift that God placed into him that would allow him amen to operate under the inspiration what he surrendered to was the son of man. And the son of man that was there when heavens was created and told us the story stood there in the platform and told you what he was doing and how he did it and while he did it. And then I I love how Paul said it. Let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus. Then let this mind let the let the intention, the ambition, let the thought, let the will, let the thing that God has, let it be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. Because see, you've been called for greater things. You've been called into greater situations. Now, now one thing we can't control uh you know, at least uh at least in a majority, we can't control what happens to us. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh you know, I I wish that I could put you in a place where we could control Amen. how people talk with you and how they I'm sorry. It's just if you're in in this human world, somebody's going to hurt your feelings. Somebody's going to say something. Somebody's going to do something. If you're uh if you're in a city, you might get robbed. You you you know, you might get shot. You you know, all kinds of things going to happen to you. Somebody's going to run over your car. Somebody Amen. And you know, so some things are outside of your control &gt;&gt; and that's what happens. So you you you don't really have the choice on that side. See, but the what belongs to us is the choice of our response &gt;&gt; or what our attitude is according to it. And and I I think it's a beautiful title. Chuck Swindoll wrote a book that I haven't read. Uh but I like this title. Amen. 10% what happens to us and 90% of how we respond. 10% of our lives. Good title. Amen. 10% I don't know what's in the book, but good title. Amen. 10% of of of our life is is is is what happens to us. Amen. But 90% is how we respond to it. It's a true statement, folks. Amen. The same thing can happen to two different people and it destroys one person and builds another. It's because of the attitude that you take. Whether it's an attitude of success and spiritual growth or whether it's an attitude of self-pity and and self-envy and and you know uh poor little me. Amen. But you know, you'll never get anywhere with that attitude because that attitude is an attitude where you think too much of yourself. You know, I think the the humility, one of the great definitions of humility is not think less. Don't don't don't think uh less of yourself, just think of yourself less. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're going to somebody's wedding and you're attending the wedding and something happens in that wedding, something's off a little bit, I want you to know it's not about you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're attending this church and a little something happens and and you you think, "Well, they started a little late or Ben saying that." That's not about you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Not not everything that happens all the time is about you. But if you think less of your, you know, think of yourself less of the time, you're more worried how that affected your friend or how that affected someone or how &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's the truth. because it gets to dealing with the attitude and attitude of gratitude. I I like these little sayings. Attitude of gratitude. That's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; We're looking for thankfulness. You know, instead of wearing that the bench is a little hard. Thank God you got one. &gt;&gt; I just got a I just got some some stuff back from Uganda. Amen. You ought to see some of them places that people are worshiping and they God bless us. They're not coming for two-hour services. They want two hours to get there. Amen. Ain't three Ain't three cars in the parking lot. Amen. And 300 people in the church, you know, dirt floors and and and hard benches and Amen. and bad sound. Amen. But people are full of joy and loving the message of the hour. Now, that's not a bad America, good Africa. It's but it but it but it's a disposition of Amen. We will not allow the circumstance to take the joy of our praise and and how we enjoy the things of God, you know. Amen. There could be better sound. There could be better music. There there always could be better. But is better always better? &gt;&gt; It's better always better. Sometimes you need to just not think so much of the perfect note and think about the inspiration that's in the song. Think about the power of God. Amen. I've heard people that wasn't very good singers at all but start singing with all their heart and the anointing starts moving in the power of God. Amen. That's our ambition. Get the Holy Ghost in the church &gt;&gt; where the power of God can become. And I'll tell you how to do it. Just go to thanking God. You go to thanking God and gratitude for what he's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know this probably not some immaculate. I've been to the Basilica Chapel and we've seen Rome and we've seen their the money they spent on it and to to those kinds of things. Amen. This is not a very beautiful sanctuary. But to me, &gt;&gt; come on. What makes it beautiful is your your belief in this end time message. What makes it beautiful is the way these young women dress and the way these young men act. And what makes it beautiful is the response to the word of God. What makes it beautiful is when you're walking down that aisle as a preacher and you're stepping into a room and it's shaken with the power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Give me the glory of God. Let me see the presence of God. That's what's beautiful to me. That's real beauty when it lasts. See, gratitude, it'll it'll bring it to you. Get a thankful heart. You get a thankful spirit and it'll change everything in your life. &gt;&gt; It'll change your home life. It'll change your church life. &gt;&gt; It'll change everything. If you could just start thanking the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Just start thanking the Lord. You know, I I know when you start praising God, Amen. things start happening. Now, now I I I asserted this little thought last week, and I I just wanted to revisit just to put it back in your mind as we travel through this thought. But in the book of Numbers, we found people who had come out under the pillar of fire under Moses. They they they were eating angel food, &gt;&gt; murmuring, com man, the the mana was coming out of the heavens. The prophet was there with a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And they were complaining. &gt;&gt; Hey man, people don't change. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nah, people don't change. &gt;&gt; It's human. &gt;&gt; And the quicker you recognize that it's human and you're human, &gt;&gt; then you recognize it's something you better guard against &gt;&gt; because it comes to the human being. Wow. &gt;&gt; The human leans negative naturally. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; But there is a supernatural birth in a believer &gt;&gt; that gives them faith sight where they can see the good in things. They can see the good in people and they can begin to get gratitude and they begin to thank the Lord for what it was. You know it was the secret behind Paul and Silas. And Amen. Brother A. Paul and Silas were singing them songs of praise when they were in jail. They were doing it. &gt;&gt; They were in a prison not like this prisons we got. you know, prison rights and television time and air conditioned and he No, no. Amen. They they were in prison like real prison. Amen. Where they were being starved and beaten and chained to a soldier. Amen. I I say this, they could sing because it was not coming from the condition or the situation. It was coming from who they were with God. &gt;&gt; Real joy. Amen. Real joy comes from the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord is our strength. Do you see the joy of the Lord? It becomes strength in the believer and real joy comes from him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. I believe I believe uh I believe it's your attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's your choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to turn and look. Somebody say, "Your choice." &gt;&gt; Your choice. &gt;&gt; It's your choice. &gt;&gt; It's your attitude. &gt;&gt; It's your choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see your attitude will determine your destination? &gt;&gt; Your attitude toward this service. So you'll either leave here and say, "Oh, this was a wonderful service." Or, "I think Brother Wayne was after me this morning. What do you think?" &gt;&gt; Your attitude will be, "That's one of the best song services I was in in prayer." Or your attitude will be, "I think Ben's a little carried away sometimes, don't you?" &gt;&gt; No, I really don't. I kind of enjoy it. Amen. Turn it up, Ben. Amen. You you see I I I certainly believe in giving praise and thanksgiving and honor. Amen. I I don't know. Sometimes we ought to just have a thanks service. We ought to just get together and the whole service be thank you Jesus and and just thank you the Lord and and just go down the aisles. Amen. Have you got anything to thank him for? Amen. Brother Dallas, I know Sister Barb's having struggles this morning, but we thank the Lord there's a there's a hospital and she's got a loving husband and there's a Lord Jesus that thanks and cares about her. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. That you got wonderful sons and they're saved and full of the Holy Ghost. And and then thank you things to thank him for. Amen. I know some of y'all I could take the whole service myself. Amen. But let me give a little time to Aiden. Amen. Let me think about what he's got to thankful God for this morning. You we're discussing it one morning and and and we're discussing what God's done for him and blessed him. We're talking about brother uh Dalton and we're talking about Hattie Wright and all this and and and I finally looked at him. I said, "But brother Aiden, you realize God's done the same thing for you that he done for them." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet's not even here, but your attitude toward the message give your children to you. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Attitude, the right attitude, the right mental attitude, it could change everything about your life. &gt;&gt; My you start just praising him and thanking him. I tell you that old heavy feeling will start lifting. You ever you ever go in a service were just heavy? I preached in services that were heavy and I say, "Lord, I borrow brother Race. Help the people." Amen. Amen. I've come out and look around gosh, y'all scaring me. You know, but but the way to lift that, just start thanking the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know the devil tried to take my service, but I'm going to thank the Lord. I know the devil tried to put some heaviness in my mind, but I'm going to thank the Lord. Somebody took my seat, but I'm going to thank the Lord. Well, that's relative in this church, ain't it? Amen. Somebody took my seat, but I'm going to I'm going to shout so loud. Amen. Amen. There somebody next week's going to want to sit where I sit cuz wherever I sit, the glory of God's fallen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Let the glory fall." I say, "Let the praises go up." I say let us thank the Lord for his mercy, for his truth, for the faith in my heart, for the blessings in my life. And I want to thank the Lord for healing us, for touching us. And I don't want it one service. I want some more tomorrow. And I want some more next week. &gt;&gt; It's an attitude of gratitude. Amen. It's a It's a thanks. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. I don't mean to sound uh wrong, but I remember being in India one time and I was walking along and I was just on the street. I was minding my own business and there was a little little little kid come up and they were maybe 10 or something and they were begging and I could see over there that somebody had them doing it, you know, but they they they had a little kid doing it and little kid rubbing his belly and putting it out like that and and you know, you know when sincerity and then when it's a put on, you know. &gt;&gt; But I didn't have a lot of money in my pocket actually. It was at the hotel. So, I reached in there and I had some coins and I just took what I had in my pocket and put it in the hand of that little kid. And that little kid looked at me and went, "Huh?" I reached down and got it, put back my pocket, just kept walking. You got to have some gratitude. Turn that change into money. &gt;&gt; Get some Get some Get some Get some attitude. Your attitude's going to determine whether you give up or grow up. &gt;&gt; Either you're going to give up or you're going to grow up. Amen. That that situations and things that face your life is going to force something out of you and you got give up or you got grow up. Is there more in you? Has God put you in the right place? Can you Amen. Listen, I tell you, if you get any kind of a a position of life and and you're leading or you're doing something, Amen. you're going to have to do something. And you're going to have to figure it out. I'm be grow I'm giving up &gt;&gt; or I'm growing up. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got a couple more. Can we preach? &gt;&gt; You're either going to get better or you're going to get bitter. &gt;&gt; How y'all like them says? &gt;&gt; Stayed up all night for them. You're going to get bitter or you're going to get better. Say, boy, this happened to me. This happened to our church. This happened to my ministry. This happened to this. Have you ever heard the life story of William Brandham? &gt;&gt; You ain't got no excuses. &gt;&gt; All your excuses have just been taken away. Come on, church. You're going to get bitter or you're going to get better. Either you're going to bitter up and stay mad and spew out bitterness and people going to walk by you and you're going to, you know, the thing I I'm old hillbilly and brother hires. There's something I found out years ago. Amen. that a skunk can't spray one person in a room. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You get all bittered up and start spraying that out against somebody in a room full of people. You can't hit just the person you're talking to. That hits those babies in the floor and it hits the wife in the kitchen. It hits the whole family. Amen. And then that bitterness starts smelling. &gt;&gt; That's good stuff, preacher. I think I'll preach. Amen. That old bitterness will be there. Or you could get better. &gt;&gt; You could get better at ignoring things. You could get better at shutting your eyes at some things. Come on, church. You could get better. You could be better at it. I could be better at it. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the power to look away. &gt;&gt; I seen so and so the other day and they was going in that video store. &gt;&gt; I can't wait to have a prayer request next week. You know what brother Brandham said? Don't you tell one person that. &gt;&gt; He said you go and pray for that person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're sitting in a house full of people and so I don't man I guess the preacher showed up. You you you're sitting in a house full of people and somebody comes up says so and so. And you know what brother Brandham said? &gt;&gt; He said the moment that you believe that bad stuff about your brother, &gt;&gt; you have marred your experience with Jesus Christ. I don't want marred. &gt;&gt; Keep it to yourself. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bitter &gt;&gt; or better. &gt;&gt; Getting better hurts. &gt;&gt; Getting better hurts. Getting better causes you to exercise places of weakness and suffering and pain. Listen, I've always been amazed at our Lord Jesus because he's the only man that was ever right &gt;&gt; and he took the wrong. &gt;&gt; He was the only man ever right and he took the wrong. &gt;&gt; Look what he done when he was hanging on Calvary. They offered him bitter and go. How many ever studied that? It was a weed that was an anesthetic that helps you deal with the pain. &gt;&gt; It's a bitter herb that helps you deal with the pain. So when somebody hurts you, I tell you the best way to deal with it, just get bitter. Cuz if you get bitter, you get calloused and then you don't care. &gt;&gt; But the thing is, you can't numb your feelings without numbing your feelings for everything else. People come and sit in a church and they get bitter about something and the next thing you know, God could drop an atomic Holy Ghost atmosphere power and they're completely unmoved. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they could watch a kid die on the floor and have no feelings because they become so numbed because of the bitterness that's coming to them because to deal with it would hurt. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said he for Jesus actually spit out the bitterness, &gt;&gt; spread his arms and opened his heart &gt;&gt; for somebody to pierce it. &gt;&gt; And then when he cried out under inspiration, he said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they do." I'll tell you, that's the kind of better I want to be. I won't be the kind of better that I can deal with my bitter hurts and my failures and throw up my harms. Listen, I won't quit loving just cuz I got hurt. I won't quit preaching because I got discouraged. I won't quit because somebody [Music] &gt;&gt; I didn't start this race to quit. &gt;&gt; I didn't sell out. Amen. To just pack up and leave. But I come to finish the race. And and and whether it comes Amen. No matter the struggles that come, we're going to finish because God's anointed us. Amen. Amen. You got to either get bitter or get better. &gt;&gt; Somebody shout it with me. Bitter or better. &gt;&gt; Bitter or better. &gt;&gt; What you going to do? &gt;&gt; Tell somebody, I'm getting better. &gt;&gt; I'm getting better. &gt;&gt; I'm getting better with handling people's problems. I'm getting better with the complaints against me. I'm getting better with criticism. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Your attitude will determine on whether you complain or conquer. &gt;&gt; You're not going to do both, folks. &gt;&gt; When you start complaining, you're bringing the trouble higher. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, it gets higher and higher and higher. Complain or conquer. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to conquer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit on the inside of me is a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Not just a conqueror, but more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; I got one more for you. &gt;&gt; Victim &gt;&gt; or overcomer? &gt;&gt; Victim or overcomer? Where you at this morning? Are you a victim or are you an overcomer? &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to say that I've never heard someone talk about how they're victims. I would love to say that, but I'd be lying straight up. &gt;&gt; And you know, the problem with with a victim is anytime you try to help them out of it, they think you're on the other person's side. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When someone has been uh hurt or they've been victim and and they come to you and they're telling you all about it, I don't think they really want uh help out of the pit because you know what I mean? I so dumbily think they come to me for help. So then I try to help. You know, I I'll say something like, you know, well maybe that brother when he didn't shake your hand didn't see you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's possible. &gt;&gt; Maybe when that guy looked at you so sternly, &gt;&gt; he just got a phone call from the other side of the country &gt;&gt; and some little family was being torn apart &gt;&gt; and he had him on his heart and he was praying for them and when you looked at him, he was so stern and you left the room thinking, "For sure." &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; See what it is is a victim is always a victim. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're the victim in every story. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I promise you. Amen. If it's a business situation and you start talking to them, it don't matter what actually happened, they're the victim. &gt;&gt; If it's a if it's a car deal, they're the victim. &gt;&gt; If it's a family problem, they're the victim. &gt;&gt; Because the mentality or the attitude is what is making you a victim. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've kind of got I kind of get I kind of chuckle at people, you know, sometimes uh sometimes uh men will take certain directions, you know, uh sometimes uh maybe maybe a ministry, they'll they'll set out and attack a church, you know, they'll attack and attack and attack and then a church will just defend themselves with the word and said, "Well, we do it because of this and this and this." And then next week you talk to them and they're a victim. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Well, last week you were the attacker, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But now you're the victim. &gt;&gt; Now, do do you see what that do you see the mentality behind that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it's either you become a victim or an overcomer? You know, it's kind of like you met a met a guy one time. I read a story about a guy and he walks into a place and someone offered him a beer and he said, "No, I don't drink." And they said, "Well, why don't you drink?" He said, "Cuz my dad was an alcoholic." And his twin brother walks in the room and and and and somebody said, "Do you want a beer?" He said, "Oh, absolutely." He said, "I drink all the time." He said, "Why is that?" He said, "Cuz my dad was an alcoholic." &gt;&gt; See, you're you're going to have to choose your own attitude. &gt;&gt; See, you can't let it become a family attitude or or this, you know. Hey, man. But the thing is, it's either victim or it's overcomer. You're not going to do that both at the same time. &gt;&gt; But but you can be an overcomer. You can overcome by the word of God. I don't care what's happened in your life. You can overcome this morning because the Bible said to he that overcomemeth what I grant to sit with me in my throne. &gt;&gt; Then you can become an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what brother Ram said he would do. He said he would get the the atonement on his mind and his attitude toward that atonement actually would become something that would be there. Now attitude, Amen, is is a powerful reality in our lives. &gt;&gt; Attitude will make the difference of your home, of your family, of your church. The attitude you take concerning something uh you know um to you that don't uh hasn't heard this uh much about this area, I I'll say this attitude. We think of attitude like in our attitude humanly but attitude also is a word used in aerodynamics. &gt;&gt; How many ever heard the word attitude in aerodynamics? &gt;&gt; Now the law of aerodynamics it's like when Paul says that there is a li when there's a spirit within me he said there's a law and the law of sin and death works on my flesh. Right? &gt;&gt; He said but there's another law and that's the law of life &gt;&gt; which supersedes the law of death. So, so when you start reading scripture, you recognize then multiple laws can exist at the same time, but one causes dominance over the other. So, the law of gravity, it's a real law. &gt;&gt; The law of gravity is real. And when the law of gravity is there, Amen. But you can break the law of gravity with the law of aerodynamics. &gt;&gt; Now, there's four different four different things that deal with the law of aerodynamics. And I I preached on this one time, so I don't want to go into it different that much, but there is lift, of course, and then there's weight, and then there's thrust, and then there's drag. So there's four laws. Amen. Now, those are spiritual laws, too, right? Amen. Lift and and weight, and thrust, and drag. So, we're talking about power. But when you start talking about attitude, it's how the plane is set up to fly. &gt;&gt; Let's just say the plane is flying along and there's a big headwind. Now what it is is there's a direction of that plane is flying maybe west in a certain way. Well that plane sets at a certain altitude but how the nose is up or the nose is down is the attitude of that plane. So let's just say you got full throttle on and that thing's flying really fast and you got your nose down a little bit. Then you see you're you're changing your drag and you don't have any lift to that plane. So it don't fly smooth. Right. &gt;&gt; But but as they adjust the head, &gt;&gt; as you adjust the head, it makes a difference how you fly. &gt;&gt; Amen. And one of the I thought this was beautiful. I read this last night and it said, "Beginning with their first lessons, students should memorize and understand that attitude plus power equals performance." &gt;&gt; That's for a pilot. I think that's for a Christian. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Attitude plus power equals performance. You say, "By the way, I'm not performing right, but I got the Holy Ghost." Then it's the attitude. &gt;&gt; See, then it's it's how you set your head &gt;&gt; of whether or not it's going to be there. There's a law that is working and it gives the angle. Amen. It gives the angle. So, attitude is considered angle. Now, I I I Amen. I I don't want to educate you, but I think we could memorize this. Amen. Attitude, power, performance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Performance equals your attitude and your power. Holy Ghost power &gt;&gt; with a with a scriptural attitude &gt;&gt; gives you a super performance. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, the the the actual the actual attitude is dealing with what they call the angle of attack. &gt;&gt; It's how that you're attacking the opposition to get off the ground or it's it's called the angle of your attack. Now what is the angle of your attack? That's your attitude. &gt;&gt; See the opposition is going to be there. It don't matter what kind of plane you're flying in or I mean there is the law of gravity is the same for everyone. And every believer sitting here whether you're a mature believer, you're a young believer just getting started. Then there is a law working against you of humanity. your your sin and death. Your human bodies working out against you and things are coming at you constantly. &gt;&gt; Constant coming, ain't they? &gt;&gt; Sometimes your mind feels like an airport for the devil's bombs. &gt;&gt; It's just coming. It's just coming. Just coming. Just coming. Just coming. Well, what the attitude is is the angle that you will attack that. And it will matter whether it takes out the lift or puts on drag. So if it's going to come, change your angle that you attack it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Attack it. Yes. Attack it. &gt;&gt; Attack every opposition because Amen. You know, it actually helps a plane to have a headwind to bring its lift. &gt;&gt; Amen. A true sailor sail right into the wind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's how you approach the opposition. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly Amen. You know, you you take God give you things, but it's it's the attitude how we take toward it. Uh you take the great ministry of Jesus Christ, one man would look at it and he would call it the devil, and another man would look at it and call it God. &gt;&gt; And their angle of attack on the word of God made the difference in their destination. &gt;&gt; If they took the angle, it's Messiah. Look what their blessings. If they took the angle, the attitude, it's the devil. Look at what followed after. Do you see even here uh just in our generations, God has done such a wonderful thing. And you know, do you have that picture of the cloud out there in Arizona? Amen. Brother Brandham uh spoke about this. It's a beautiful it's a beautiful uh uh picture. Amen. And and it means so much different to so many different people. Uh but I was reading yesterday and brother Bam said, "Oh," he said, "I was standing there and he said he it was there with that white wig and looking down towards the earth showing supreme authority. Heaven's declared it. The Bible declares it. The message declares it. Supreme Authority with his white wig on. You'll see his black beard to the right sideways. Look at it. See, there it is. Just as perfect as it was, it had been photographed at him. But they were looking at it from the wrong angle. &gt;&gt; You got to look at it at the right angle. &gt;&gt; And the Lord God reveals the right angle. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, if you'll turn it to the right, amen, it is a perfect picture of Christ. But but but if you attack that with the wrong angle and you make it something that it's not or you take away from what it is, Amen. then what you're doing is your uh your attitude is attacking the things of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, some people are very zillious and they they they playing the game. I remember one time years ago, Billy Graham was talking about a football game. And I don't I'm not a football player. Some of you probably in here know the famous game he's talking about. But he was talking about a famous game and he was talking about uh uh the the crowd was going crazy. It was like a Super Bowl or something, I guess. And he said he said uh he said one old boy caught it. He said he was running his head off. The crowd was screaming. He said he thought he was doing the best kind of job a man could do. And when he got to the field goal, he turned around and looked and it was the it was the opposing team that was doing the cheering. &gt;&gt; He was running the ball the wrong way. &gt;&gt; So it it matters. Amen. You know, so somebody's cheering. Well, look who's cheering. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Who Who's the one egging it on? See, it's the attitude. Amen. That that you approach something. When you approach the word of God, you have to approach it in an attitude. Now, the prophet tells us this. If a man catches a vision of the invisible and he knows he's present, he said it'll stabilize that thinking. It'll stabilize actions. It'll stabilize a time of distress and trouble. It'll make him look upward above things that are happening around him because he starts looking into the unseen. &gt;&gt; You see, when you start seeing the unseen, the attitude is the unseen realm. That's what you're looking to. The unseen realm, I'm believing what I'm believing. I'm acting the way I'm acting. I have the attitude. I have is because I'm not looking at the circumstances. I'm not looking at the situations. I'm actually looking at the unseen promises of God that he has made. Now, amen. You say, "Well, preacher, what are you talking about?" Maybe you're sitting here this morning. You're needing a healing. Now, you've got to have an an attitude to get to that healing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Healings and miracles are different. &gt;&gt; Healings happen over time. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If you want a healing, Amen. God promised you healing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said it is there. Now, Brother Bam says, "Now, here's the thing. I would like to have an oak acorn tree or an oak tree in my front yard, and somebody gives you an acron. Now, you've got the tree, but it's in seed form, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Now, if you asked me for an oak tree and I gave you an acron, now you you might not want the acron, &gt;&gt; but this is what you do to get an oak tree. So my attitude is, well, it wasn't exactly what I wanted because it wasn't mature, but I'll plant it. And brother Bam says, you can't go out there every morning and dig that up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, you got to plant it and then you got to water it and start letting it grow because it's the right mental attitude. Somebody say the right mental attitude. &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude. Brother Ram says, see, amen. It's there. You can you can praise God as soon as you get that acron. Come on. &gt;&gt; You can start praising God because you've got the tree already. See, &gt;&gt; now I'm the Lord that health thee. Just start praising. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam is saying the scripture is your acron &gt;&gt; to the tree of your healing. &gt;&gt; And if you got the scripture, you can quote that scripture and start praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't see any results." But that don't make any difference. you go to it anyhow cuz the word of God is a seed and it's sold with incorruptible seed. It can't perish. It's incorruptible. Amen. Here's a statement I usually make in healing services. The right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass because it's a seed. &gt;&gt; That's a Bible. That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Luke 8 and 11, the parable is this. The seed is the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, this is fundamentally, see, the correct word of God, the Bible, every bit of it inspired and all of it is God's word. And when you receive the word, you have received God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the middle of that thanks service, let's have a Bible service just remembering what this really is. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it. He says, "If you receive the word of God, you have received God because that's God's plan." Yes, sir. God's motive and God's attitude and God's love and God's salvation, everything rest in this printed word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And those words are like grains of seeds. If you could pick them out and swallow them, every one of them would produce what it says it would do. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if you go through this Bible and you could just pick out, Amen. The Bible said he's the Lord that health all thy disease. Do you pick that out and swallow that? &gt;&gt; Then healing is coming from the inside. &gt;&gt; Your healing is flowing out of the of the very thing that you're eating and believing in the word of God. Now, the Bible is the word of God. Amen. I I love how Brother Bram says it. He says, "Watch now." Amen. Uh uh any person, it has a right now. And we always get what we expect. And when people expect something, you usually get what you look for. It's a mental attitude that you have. &gt;&gt; Now remember this and never forget it. The right mental attitude towards any divine promise will bring it to pass. The right mental attitude. &gt;&gt; Now, so the prophet is telling us to not forget. &gt;&gt; Let's have an attitude of remembrance. &gt;&gt; An attitude of remembering the word of God. Do you know that you can't quote what you don't know? &gt;&gt; True. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You you know it and and I know that denominational world goes crazy in this about quoting uh you know memorizing scriptures and things but the Bible says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, &gt;&gt; and forget not all his benefits, &gt;&gt; for he forgiveth all thine iniquity, &gt;&gt; and he health healeth all &gt;&gt; thine diseases." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Exodus 15, Jesus, the the Moses writes of Jehovah, and he said, "For I am the Lord that health thee." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, that's where they take from the scripture Jehovah &gt;&gt; Rafa. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa, the Lord our healer. That that's actually what Moses spoke of him. I am Jehovah Rafa. &gt;&gt; So, it is who he is &gt;&gt; in Isaiah 53 and5. Now, these are seeds to swallow, to eat, to devour, for healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was wounded for our transgressions, Jesus, &gt;&gt; and he was bruised for our iniquity. &gt;&gt; And the chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; we are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 24, and whose own self bear our sins in his own body, that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes ye are healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, I need I need healing this morning. I have just given you the seeds of your healing. &gt;&gt; I have just spoke to you the seeds of your healing." In James chapter 5 and verse 15, the prayer of faith shall save the sick. &gt;&gt; The prayer of faith shall save the sick. Brother Bam said, "There it is." Do you see? It's when the impossible becomes possible. Abraham took God's word and the impossible it was made possible. Mary the Virgin took his word and the impossible was made possible. I tell you this, if anybody can take the word of God this morning and this seed falls on the right kind of ground, it'll produce exactly what it said it would do. &gt;&gt; And you can put it on record and put it on tape that the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness, when you start hearing a prophet say these things that every word of God, Jesus said, he said it is a seed &gt;&gt; and every seed, it is a promise &gt;&gt; and every seed is a promise. Now, there's nothing like it. Nothing like the word of God because it's a seed and it's the seed of healing. &gt;&gt; It's the seed of hope. &gt;&gt; It's the seed of change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's what you take when you're ready to change something. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm I'm a I I I I you know, sometimes I don't prepare things well. Sometimes things just come up in inspiration, you know, uh as you're preaching along, but I do while we're talking this way, I I want to take a moment and thank our medical staff that's here in the church. &gt;&gt; How about you? &gt;&gt; You want to say, God, thank you for having these kind of people. We got doctors, we got nurses, we got firemen, first aid men, ambulances, we got every every kind of of medical uh thing. Now, now listen, let me let me just say this as we're moving along. Uh I was listening to brother Brandham some time ago and he said when he went to Africa, he said the Christian science had got there in front of him and had the medical doctors refusing divine healing. He said it was because of the way they were teaching it. &gt;&gt; Do you see? They were teaching that going to a doctor was a bad thing. &gt;&gt; And because they were teaching it that way, Amen. they were making it a uh they were making it an error. &gt;&gt; But when Brother Brandham started teaching divine healing according to scripture, the doctors started getting the ambulances and sending their patients down to the down to the to the meeting. I talked to one of the ambulance drivers. They said, "We took them and didn't bring them back." Yeah. &gt;&gt; The doctors were prescribing that meeting for their healing because not all doctors are are atheist. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; But when you get a thought on you that going to the doctor is wrong, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You didn't get that from the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. No, that's right. &gt;&gt; You did not get that from the message of William Brandon. &gt;&gt; He went to the Cleveland Clinic. He took his wife to the do. &gt;&gt; Come on, give me some help in here. &gt;&gt; You didn't get that out of the message. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, some people feel it's more spiritual if it's a home remedy. It ain't more spiritual. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it's divine healing, it's divine healing. &gt;&gt; And whether you go to the best doctor on the planet or some witch doctor with their uh hoodoo medicine, &gt;&gt; if you get healed, the hoodoo person didn't heal you and the doctor didn't heal you. He said, "I am the Lord that healeth all." &gt;&gt; Healeth all. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You You know, you know, it's it's kind of a funny thing cuz cuz we qualifi we qualify that stuff. Lord, you get me in all kinds of trouble. We we qualify that kind of stuff. You know, it's the truth. It's honestly true, you know. And I was listen to a tape one day and I I come from early in my in my ministry. I probably lean toward the anti-docctor side a bit, &gt;&gt; but I was in my 20s. I hadn't needed a doctor at all. Funny thing is there's a Oh gosh, there's a there's a a preacher down there in Arkansas, you know, and they're not message, but they taught for years and years and years and years and years. Don't go to the doctor. They let their kids suffer, you know, little kids suffer and got pneumonia and can't barely even breathe and they lay there and we believe in healing. We let this kid suffer. We believe in healing. And then when they get old, Oh, &gt;&gt; and they get sick. &gt;&gt; They go down to the doctor and But you wouldn't want me to be in your church. I said, "Nuh-uh, buddy. No, sir. No doctor for the kid. No doctor for you. &gt;&gt; You practice what you preach. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to take a kid to the doctor. Don't you dare go to the doctor. &gt;&gt; Poor little old thing ain't got a power enough take itself and you won't take it." &gt;&gt; That's rough, ain't it? Could I preach a minute? So we we walked in the back last week. Brother Ray sat there. He's such a gentleman. He looks he goes, "Well, that was an old Joe Olstein sermon." You know, the thing the thing is honestly though, there's a there is a a direction, right? &gt;&gt; And the direction is a healing. But all these things get attached to divine healing. to come against divine healing. &gt;&gt; But you you you by by being it don't help it, it hurts it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And anything that helps God's people, &gt;&gt; praise God for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what it is? Amen. That the prophet of God is showing that healing is not some weird thing. &gt;&gt; It's not somebody taking a a magic wand and waving it over you. And and and if we hocus pocus enough, listen, these are biblical principles that Jesus died and took stripes. And if you'll take that seed of truth and you'll stand on that, Amen. God, Amen. God healed you already. And you got every right to tell the devil, "Devil, you get out of here. I believe God." &gt;&gt; Now, I I Yeah. Well, can I use this? We always so deep, might as well use it. Uh, brother brother Ron Spencer and I I I have prayed for that man and I know you pray for that man and there's been so many pray for that man. Amen. But you know, I've sat with brother Ron and I I've went to church with him and him throw up five and six, eight times out there at the parking lot and get in the car and go to a meeting with me and I can show you the meeting &gt;&gt; and you can see him sitting behind me and that man sits there and he wasn't sitting there with his arm folded. &gt;&gt; Right. He was so sick he couldn't move his head. &gt;&gt; But he was sitting there and you can watch him sitting there going, "Preach, Brother Wayne. &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Wayne." You know why he's doing that? Because his attitude &gt;&gt; is what I need is in that preaching going on right there. And he and brother Amen very very clearly. I I I mean I He showed me some things. He's talked to me privately. He's had preachers call him and say he's got cancer because God's judging him. He's had preachers call him and say, "Because you're taking medication, God can't heal you." Listen. Listen, folks. Amen. It gets so far out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I I How many knows what flint is? And Indian arrowheads and spearheads and knives. There's a there's an old boy called Roy Miller. I know that's not a popular name over in Amish country, but Roy Miller's Roy Miller over there. He he dig He's got a farm and he digs off of Flint Ridge. He's got some beautiful turquoise colored flint. I almost like the color of that. I called him the other day and I said, "Hey Roy, you got any flint?" And he said, "No, Wayne." He said, "I didn't get out this year." He said, "I got leukemia back in December." I said, "Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that." And he said, "Yeah." He said, "It was the most aggressive kind. They said that I had about six months." And he said, "But they did say that that that I had an option that I could treat it and maybe postpone it and you know, we could we could kind of break it." And he said, "But you know," and man, I felt so bad. I started, "Oh, man, I'm so sorry to hear that and I'm so sorry you're going through this." And he goes, "Oh, no, no, no." He said, "It's okay now." He said, 'I don't have leukemia anymore. Lord, &gt;&gt; I said, "You don't." He said, "No." He said, "I went to the doctor the other day and they said, "Sir, you don't have any leukemia at all." And he said, "Well," I said, "Well, well, don't it just go in remission and then come back?" And then they said, "Well, not in this case. You just don't have any more leukemia in your body." He said, "Mr. Lawson, have you ever heard anything like that?" that. And I said, "Sir, that would take God." He said, "That's exactly right." He said, "You know, over here in this country," he said, "All these Flint guys, they got their churches and things, and I went over and told all of them I had cancer, and they went home and started praying for me." He said, "Brother Lawson, it is a miracle." Or, "Mr. Lawson, he didn't know I was a preacher." He said, "Mr. Lawson, it's a miracle." And I said, "That's right." You know, that guy ain't a part even of the message. It's amen. But there's a simple principle, amen, that if you could believe, Amen. that God, Amen. Faith heals. Faith heals you. It's not I'm a good guy or a bad guy. I took medicine. I didn't take medicine. I go to the doctor. I don't go to the doctor. Forget the whole thing. Jesus took stripes. And because he took stripes, there's a healing this morning. And I've got a right to tell every sick devil. I've got a right to tell every devil of infirmity. You're trespassing on God's property. Take your leave, devil. I pray the power of a healing anointing would flow in this building this morning. I tell you, I think Jesus raised from the dead, and he said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils. They lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "That's the problem we got today. We got a lot of runners and they're fit runners." He said, "But they ain't got a message when they get there. They have forgot to message was go tell my disciples that he has risen from the dead. I want you to know this morning I have not forgot what the gospel of Jesus Christ is about. He has risen from the dead and the healer is still healing and the creator is still creating. He still remains to be God this morning. We are not serving some dead idol. We are serving the God of Abraham. Christ Jesus that is raised up this morning and sits in power with all demons under his feet. &gt;&gt; This Holy Ghost Bible seed cannot grow in an atmosphere of intellectualism. &gt;&gt; Can't do it. &gt;&gt; I do not understand trying to intellectualize our churches. &gt;&gt; I I cannot personally conceive the idea &gt;&gt; that we want to make a church like a classroom. Right. &gt;&gt; Let me take another step. &gt;&gt; Are like a morg. &gt;&gt; A morg is for dead people. &gt;&gt; And we most certainly are not dead. &gt;&gt; Because he lives, I live. &gt;&gt; And because he lives and I live, there's something in my heart this morning that loves him and wants to worship him. Amen. And build an atmosphere that every seed of this Bible can start living inside this church this morning. I believe it. I believe it's an atmosphere. I believe it's an atmosphere produced by attitude. &gt;&gt; An attitude of faith, an attitude of believing. It produces an an atmosphere of I believe it and I'll accept it. Now, the right attitude, the right attitude would make me confess healing when when everything in my body says I'm sick. &gt;&gt; What's your angle of attack? I'll tell you my angle of attack. I'm going to take the word of God. And I'm going to beat against the enemy whether he's in me or somebody else. Whether he's in my flesh or your flesh, I will not give up the position of the sons of God against sickness and infirmities. &gt;&gt; We will not resign. &gt;&gt; We will not retreat. &gt;&gt; We will testify the glories of God and we will confess this word and let the devil know we believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, I'll tell you what they told Brother Bram." said, "Well, my faith is weak." Brother Bram said, "I wouldn't confess it." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't say it. &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here and your faith is weak, I'd never let that come out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't confess that. &gt;&gt; My faith is weak. I wouldn't confess it. Don't you ever let the devil know that. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The devil is not all knowing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He don't know what you're really thinking. He is not a discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart. And he don't know what really you're feeling and think until you tell him. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever tell that devil I'm weak. Don't you ever tell him that I'm having struggles. Don't you let it become negative. Keep the positive. &gt;&gt; Come on. He can heal cancer. Can't he heal it? Let me see that witness. Yes, he can heal it. Amen. He can save and he can sanctify and he can fill with the Holy Ghost. Yes, he can do it. So, Brother Wayne, I got weak in faith. And I tell you what, I I've I've I've done it. I've done what you said do. Well, keep doing it. &gt;&gt; It's called perseverance. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Keep doing it. It works. Brother Bam said, "Say it and keep saying it." &gt;&gt; Sounds Sounds ridiculous, don't it? &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you accept it on those basis, &gt;&gt; you keep saying it over and over and you say it out loud. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; If you're sick in your body, won't you start it right now? &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's an affliction in your life and you don't know how to get out of it, won't you start saying it right now? I am healed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I am healed. If you accept it on those bases, you keep saying it over and over and you say it out loud and you say, I'm healed. and you say it till you actually believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when you believe it, it's going to take place. Don't you ever get a negative attitude. &gt;&gt; Don't take a negative confession. &gt;&gt; So, preacher, what are you doing? I'm preaching you right out of it. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching you right out of your sickness. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching you right out of that valley you've been living in. I'm preaching if you'll take the attitude what that man's saying is true, you'll leave here on a mountain. You'll rise up out of that infirmity. You'll rise up out of that depression. You'll rise up out of the sin because God ordained you to be in that realm of faith and truth and to believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, brother Wayne, where you get that kind of attitude out of the Bible? &gt;&gt; If you want a family attitude, here's you one. &gt;&gt; I had a sister named Mary and she was 16 years old. &gt;&gt; And she had never even known a man. &gt;&gt; Come on. But the angel of the Lord came to her and said that she would bear the Messiah, the savior of the earth. And when she heard it, she never questioned it could happen. She just didn't know how it would happen. &gt;&gt; And she said to him, "How should these things be?" And then when the when the Lord said to her, "Look, Mary. It's not impossible with God." &gt;&gt; And Mary began to testify, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Now, Brother Brandon says it. He said, "Mary never waited till she felt it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're waiting till you feel better, &gt;&gt; you'll never feel better. &gt;&gt; If you ever let the devil know that I'm wait I'm waiting till I feel better. Brother, he has got 200,000,000 demons to sick on you. &gt;&gt; He can keep he can keep a devil pestering you all day, every day, rest of your life. early, right? &gt;&gt; But when you want to get better, you you take Mary's attitude and with that one visible sign, with that one natural test, with that one positive affirmation outside of the word of God, you take the word of God and say, "At thy word, Lord, and you begin to worship the Lord and praise him." And brother Bram says, "See, you don't wait till you can move your foot. You don't wait till your arm is better. You don't wait till the cancer looks like it's gone. You don't wait till the heart trouble is better. You take the word of God, get a happy mental attitude, and start rejoicing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm healed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; See, it it's it's the change of attitude. That's that's that's sometimes what we need. &gt;&gt; Things that change it. A man come in brother Bram's prayer line. John Ryan came in brother Bram's prayer line and brother Brandham, he was a Catholic boy and brother Bram prophesied over him. Said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're healed." John John left a blind man went and sat down in the congregation &gt;&gt; and he got up and come right back out in the prayer line and he said, "Brother Brandon, watch his attitude." Brother Brandham, you said I was healed. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. You said you believe me, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I can't see." Brother Brandham said, "What's that got to do with it?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Then what can I do?" Brother Bam said, "Now watch what it was." He said, "I seen right then." He needed something to say. He said, "So I said, "You go tell everybody you're healed." There was not one thing changed on that platform other than his confession. &gt;&gt; And his confession changed. Brother Brandham said he was interrupting the meeting and everything, screaming out, "I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed." And two weeks later, &gt;&gt; he was sitting on a barber chair when his eyes come open. Amen. What was it? Because the thing that changed was not his eyesight. It was the testimony that he was healed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see it's amazing thing when you catch the reality that now now I'm telling you that about something happened in Mary's day. Something that happened with John Ryan. But I I I've seen that witness of it. Brother Vernon sitting right there. Amen. I watched a lady Dana Nelson who was suffering with a stroke and and and and she came in the prayer line on a Sunday morning and we watched her get up out of that prayer line out of her chair and she walked like this to the prayer line all the way up there and when she got there I went over and anointed with her oil and I said, "Sister Dana, what would you like prayer for this morning?" She said, "Brother Wayne, I've had this stroke and it's paralyzed half of me and I want God to heal me." And so I said a prayer over her, a prayer of faith. And I said, "Sister Dena, now you go and you testify God's healing power." And she stopped and looked up at me and she said, "Brother Wayne, my daughter is a nurse." And she said, "And when I talk about healing like this, she thinks I'm crazy." And I said, "Sister Dana, the Bible said, "Let every man word be a lie that the word of God be true." I said, "I don't care if your family likes it." No. I said, "They're not the ones needing the healing. You're the one needs the healing." I said, "So you go home and start testifying about that." Amen. And you know what? That night she comes back and Brother Ray, we've done it a bunch, you know, and she comes back that night and I get up and come to prayer line and she gets up out of her seat and she's starting to come down and she's walking up there same way she came. And when she gets up there, I'm thinking in my mind, we prayed for you this morning. All I can do is pray for you. And when she gets up in the prayer line, she looks up at me and I said, "What would you like, Sister Dana?" She said, "I'd just like to give a testimony, Brother Wayne." I said, "What about, Sister?" She said, "The Lord healed me this morning." And when she reached out to take the mic I had she reached out with that paralyzed arm and took a hold of that mic. She didn't get to testify. She went to dancing all over the front of that building in the name of the Lord Jesus because it's true. It works. It's the truth. It's not psychology. It's the power of the living God. It's a creative anointing. You can walk out of that perilous this morning. You can you can get up out of your struggles this morning. The word of God said you could. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram left the building one morning. Man was laying over on the side. Brother Bram was walking out of the building and he said, "Everybody in the in the sound of my voice will be healed this morning." And a man, he was laying there on a cot. Brother Bram was walking by and he walked by and said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're healed." The guy just kept laying there. One of the other people reached over and shook him. Said, "Brother, get up from there." He said, "You're healed." He said, "I'm not healed." He said, "Yeah." He said, "Brother Brandham just walked by you." You didn't hear him say, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're healed." He said, he said that. He said, "Yeah." The fella got up and started rejoicing. Amen. Amen. Because all he needed to realize is it's thus sayaith the Lord. If it's in the Bible, church, it's thus sayaith the Lord, you can have your healing this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You talk about attitudes. I want this attitude. &gt;&gt; I want this attitude of of of where the Bible brother man preaches in the eagle stare at this nest and he said, "Listen now." Amen. I I won't be much longer. He said, "Listen now. If you ain't got enough faith to receive it right now, a miracle, then you take a adopted baby attitude." &gt;&gt; That's pretty good, ain't it? Adopted baby attitude. Somebody said, "What's an adopted baby attitude?" Brother Bram says, "It's the attitude towards it." See, I've seen Sir Thomas Cancer leave people by that same thing. Now, maybe you won't be able to receive enough for your deliverance all of the sudden. &gt;&gt; He said, "But may I say tonight, I want you to take a moment. If you can't receive enough faith to be healed instantly, then you take the adopted baby route." Did you ever hear of adopting a baby? Now, you know th this is a this is a a spiritual principle, but it's not just spiritual, folks. &gt;&gt; It's a natural principle. &gt;&gt; Just a quick Google search gave me details of several people, but there was a study done here a while back of women who were unable to have children &gt;&gt; that went and adopted children because they were unable to have children. and had pre-adoption pregnancies of their own biologically. And out of 388 adoption uh just 388 study of 388 of them women, 42 of them ended up with babies &gt;&gt; biologically. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that that's almost 10%. And we're not even talking about a spiritual principle. &gt;&gt; We're talking about just the fact that when they adopted a baby, it relaxed them enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. it it it done something to them that they could relax their body and receive seed according to the way they should. And sometimes we get so we get so bent in our mind, we get so we we got to make it happen and we got to make it happen. Amen. And and and after a while, Amen. We we can't make it happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't make it happen. It's not on that principle. It's on the principle God already did it. &gt;&gt; And you adopt your baby. You confess the word of God. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to confess the word of God, what does it do? That that that brother Bram said, "Many times I tell people to go on and adopt a baby." You're you're needing you're needing a baby. He said, "I tell them to go on and adopt a baby." He said, "Because then they'll have their baby." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? He's telling you if you don't have enough to get your instant healing, adopt a baby. confess your healing and it will relax you enough to let the healing happen in your soul. &gt;&gt; But if you get if you're so if you're so white knuckled and you you I'm going to make it happen. You can't do it like that. &gt;&gt; It has to be Jesus died for it. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy of it. I could never make it happen, but he did it for me and I'm accepting his gift. And then when you go to praising him for what he did, &gt;&gt; it'll unlock something on the inside and it becomes the power of your confession. Now your confession is what overcomes it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Your confession overcomes it. Your confession is the thing that overcame. And they said they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. That's it. By the blood of the lamb. You cannot begin to testify till you really understand the blood. Because every time you start testifying of something God did for you, Satan has something you did, said, felt, or did, and he's going to put it over your head. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Y'all know what exploiting a weakness means? &gt;&gt; You know what exploiting weakness means? exploiting weakness is when is when let's let's say there's a home and there's trouble comes up in a home and sometimes a a man will do something he shouldn't do but he's the leader. &gt;&gt; So then when he exposes that weakness and then if a sister's not in the right attitude sometimes every time he tries to lead differently than she wants &gt;&gt; then she'll exploit the weakness in the man so she can take leadership. Sure. &gt;&gt; I've seen men commit adultery on their families and live out in the world. Then the sister pray for years. God send my husband home. Then he comes home and then she don't let him lead, [Music] &gt;&gt; you know. Then then every time he goes to spank a child, &gt;&gt; if she don't like the way he spanks the child, then there's a disrespect raising up. &gt;&gt; So how do you fix that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do you fix that? I'll tell you how you fix it. Humility. &gt;&gt; You have to go to a place that you humbly repent of your wrongs. &gt;&gt; If you've done something wrong, acted wrong, felt wrong, don't just expect somebody to get over it. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching now. &gt;&gt; Because you can make your choice. You can't choose the consequence. &gt;&gt; If you do something, somebody lose respect or trust for you. You made the choice to do it. Now you're trying to control the coinc the the the the consequences and that you can't change. &gt;&gt; But if you want the if you want the thing to make a a it's humility. You come in humility get in front of your family get on your knees and say I have done wrong. I have acted wrong. I have felt wrong. I am a son of God and I have asked the Lord to forgive me. Now I'm asking you to forgive me. But from this day on, I am commissioned to lead this home. And I must by the power of God lead. &gt;&gt; Because your family needs you to lead. &gt;&gt; Even if the sister's not ready to let go of it, she needs you to lead. [Music] &gt;&gt; I asked a lady one time running over her husband. I said, "Why you do that?" She said, "Cuz he lets me. And we're talking about something. &gt;&gt; The exploitation of weakness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, Satan was there when you done wrong. &gt;&gt; So, every time you go to start confessing the word of God, &gt;&gt; he's going to hold it over your head. &gt;&gt; He's going to That's what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; Oh, you think you're somebody. &gt;&gt; You think you're spiritual. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to worship the Lord in the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what you do? You put your life under the blood. &gt;&gt; And when you get that life under the blood, then you tell that devil, "Look, Jesus knows everything about me. &gt;&gt; He knows my weaknesses. He knows my strength. And all that I am has been put under the blood. And I'll not let you bluff me. I'll not let you buffalo me. I'm a son of God. I'll live for God. I'll believe God's word." Amen. Because I'm coming under the blood. Listen this morning, Satan is trying to exploit the weakness of your life because you won't give it to Jesus. &gt;&gt; You won't put it under the blood. &gt;&gt; The Bible said if you confess your sin, he is faithful and just to forgive you. He's not looking to squash you. He's looking for you to confess it so he can fight for you. Put it under the blood so you can stand there and say to the devil, "You can't touch me. You've got no right to my family. I rebuke you, Satan, in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, and once you get it under the blood, then you got a position where you can stand and then you can overcome by your testimony. You can shut up the devil. &gt;&gt; You can shut up the devil by your testimony. And I love that last line. And they love not their lives unto death. Now, that's the spiritual application. That's the spiritual ambition we're talking about this morning. They love not their lives unto death. It means that you have soul sold out that you're willing to face this enemy at any cost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're willing to destroy your enemy at any cost. And generally that means you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Take Samson's attitude and say, "God, I want the power back in my life enough to die for it. I will die from my entertainments. I will die from the world. I will die from my pleasures. I will die from my lust. I will die from these things that's here. I will die from my jealousy. Lord, I want the power of God in my life. And when you begin to die, the power of God comes back into life. And there, Amen. They love not their lives unto death. So power returns. There's a possibility this morning for you in this ambition of God to see miracles take place in your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can have it this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you're going to have to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to fight. If our musicians would come, you you you can have it this morning, but you're going to have to fight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take a attitude. Who wants David's attitude? &gt;&gt; It's a Goliath, &gt;&gt; but I'm gonna run in the battle. It's a Goliath. But I got a secret. I've been anointed by a prophet before I met my Goliath. &gt;&gt; He knew God's purpose couldn't be destroyed. &gt;&gt; He ran. He ran to the battle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What an attitude. What an attitude lived in these men. Their angle of attack. I'm anointed. You're an uncircumcised Philistine. Shamgar whipped 600 of you. I surely can whip one. Me and me and Mariah Grace was talking the other day. And she was saying, "Dad, you ever notice that sometimes it's just one person in a service when they get their breakthrough, the whole church gets a breakthrough." &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, I've noticed that a lot." You know, Brother Bram taught that. He said when he was up there in Seattle, he said there was a an insane spirit and it was it was coming to attack him. And brother Bram said when the Holy Spirit conquered it and it fell over his feet, he said the chief devil was whipped. &gt;&gt; And he said then from that time there was healings and miracles and every &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So sometimes when you're attacking that devil from the angle God's gi you, it's not just for you. It's for other people in this room for other for other needs &gt;&gt; that are sitting there. Do you see? &gt;&gt; They love not their lives unto death. It's here in this America we have this great saying, give me liberty or give me death. It was a very famous saying of Patrick Henry. And here we are at the 4th of July, you know, &gt;&gt; but what that really meant was, I'm ready for liberty &gt;&gt; and I'm ready to declare my liberty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; publicly &gt;&gt; even if I die. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of attitude that guy had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Even if I die, even if they kill me, I'll declare my liberty. If you're if you like history, uh the Roman Empire itself in Rome, it it had great armies and generals, but it was a republic run by Congress. &gt;&gt; There was one Julius Caesar rode up to the river of Rubicon on his horse, and there was a law that if you crossed the Rubicon River with an army then it was considered rebellion and mutiny and it was considered an overthrow. So, so anytime an army returned under a general to the city of Rome, they had to disband as an army and they had to ride across citizens. But Julius de Caesar decided he would take Rome and he sat at the river of Rubicon. And when he rolled over that river, he cried out those great famous Italian words that uh the die is cast. Meaning this thing that I have did either give me liberty or it'll give me death. There's no return from here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you see? You're going to have to ring that liberty bell this morning. True. &gt;&gt; You got to take your stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's your angle of attack, your attitude. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be bitter. I'm going to be better. &gt;&gt; I'm just not I'm not going to be bitter. I am not. You're going to not make me a victim in this story. I'm the overcomer in this story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to let the devil crown me with no grumbling, mumbling spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to be crowned with the glory and happiness of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I tell you this morning, &gt;&gt; great men, great people in this Bible took stands throughout their lives. &gt;&gt; Because they had an ambition. And I pray this morning that your ambition becomes the ambition that God has for you. your purpose. If you're sick, his ambition is for you to be healed. If you're sitting here this morning, you need God's got an ambition for your life. And if if you're if you're there this morning, sitting there, I I just wonder, you know, sometimes sometimes actions throw up a rock and a whirlwind come. You throw dust and fleas and flies and &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You you you you give a little bit of oil, an action. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder if you could take an action with me this morning. And as you stand to your feet this morning, I want you to stand with purpose. I want you to stand as you've never stood before. As you stand to your feet, I want you to stand as one who will not be a victim to this no longer. &gt;&gt; To stand as one that is here to declare your rights before God. My weaknesses will no longer be exploited. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to accept it this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to accept it this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, with our &gt;&gt; hands lifted, &gt;&gt; standing on our feet this morning, Lord, there's something screaming within our hearts. Father, I know I've been long this morning, but my heart is very burdened for your children, Lord. You've placed these things in my heart to speak to them, Lord. And Father, I pray this morning that as they stand, they stand as they've never stood. May they stand in liberty and freedom. May they stand this morning, Lord, knowing the enemy cannot exploit them any further. I pray if there be a a leader in a home that Lord is failing to lead, God, may you inspire them today to rise up. I pray, Father, if there one today that don't know you, may you inspire them to know you. Lord, we're asking for your divine grace now that you would come among us. Lord, we we invite you now in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. Amen. God bless you, brother Ben. You said that when we ask, we will receive.
