[15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; He knows about every need and we thank

[16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to the Lord in prayer
[16:06] and open the service. Brother, I forgot
[16:09] your first name in the white in the red
[16:11] shirt, a red tie. Come, brother, please,
[16:13] and pray for us this morning.
[16:21] After a little bit in the service, we'll
[16:23] also be receiving uh the offering. So
[16:27] remember that in a little bit we'll call
[16:29] the brothers and to receive the
[16:31] offering.
[16:35] Let's just all pray together.
[16:39] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how
[16:42] we're at a loss for words
[16:45] with how thankful we are, Lord, that we
[16:47] saw the moving of your spirit last
[16:49] night,
[16:51] Lord. The healing, the deliverance,
[16:52] Lord, the touch that you gave us last
[16:54] night, Lord. It was just so amazing and
[16:56] we're just so thankful for it. Lord, our
[16:59] bodies may be weak this morning, but our
[17:01] spirit is willing. Father, we're just
[17:03] asking that you would just come down in
[17:04] the service yet once more. Father, we
[17:06] know that Hebrews 13:8 says that you're
[17:09] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[17:11] So Lord, we're just taking you at your
[17:13] word, Lord. That you're going to be the
[17:15] same today as you were last night. The
[17:17] same deliverance that was given to us
[17:19] last night. Lord, we're expecting that
[17:21] that'll be here for us this morning.
[17:23] Lord, we just ask that you would be with
[17:24] the minister as he's uh preparing
[17:27] himself for service, Lord. May he just
[17:28] be able to get himself out of the way,
[17:30] Lord. May he enter into the channel of
[17:32] the Holy Spirit, Lord. that we wouldn't
[17:33] be hearing from any man, but we would be
[17:36] hearing directly from the throne of God
[17:38] this morning. Lord, we come together,
[17:40] Lord, not necessarily just to see
[17:42] friends or to see familiar faces or to
[17:44] sing songs, but Lord, we've gathered
[17:46] ourselves together to grow closer to
[17:47] you. So, Lord, we're just asking that
[17:49] you would just come down, Lord. We're
[17:51] trying to make you welcome this morning.
[17:52] Be with the songs and the uh the
[17:55] worship. Lord, may it not just be words
[17:57] flowing from our lips, but may it be
[17:59] worship pouring out from our hearts.
[18:00] Father, be with each and every need. Uh
[18:03] Lord, there's many here that need
[18:04] deliverance and need healing. Lord, just
[18:06] touch them. We ask in the name of Jesus
[18:07] Christ. Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Why don't you shake the hands of those
[18:12] around you this morning?
[18:15] Ah, they're they're uh hold on hold on
[18:18] on the offering there. I don't know if
[18:19] they're ready. Everybody ready for the
[18:21] offering?
[18:24] I don't know if they I don't know if
[18:26] they had their pockets out yet. So, just
[18:29] uh I was just I was just warn I was
[18:30] going to give them a 10-minute warning
[18:32] earlier, but they're coming. I think
[18:35] they're coming now with the bucket. So,
[18:36] go ahead and we'll receive the offering
[18:38] at this time. We'll ask the Mavo sisters
[18:40] to come and sing for us also if they
[18:43] come up to the platform.
[18:46] Amen. Thank you for giving unto the Lord
[18:48] this morning.

[24:43] [Music]
[25:28] I may be walked and scorned
[25:33] by his whole world
[25:37] just like my Jesus
[25:41] was.
[25:44] I may be hunted down
[25:48] or even persecuted,
[25:52] but it's okay once I have
[25:56] his Holy Spirit.
[26:00] I know this world will reject me
[26:04] and my friends may despise me, but
[26:08] that's okay.
[26:11] [Music]
[26:12] Ooh, that's okay.
[26:16] I'm not here for these purposes.
[26:20] I'm a father as well. And my greatest
[26:25] desire
[26:26] is for the fullness of
[26:30] to be found in me
[26:35] when he returns that day.
[26:38] So I'm crying out
[26:42] for your holy spirit.
[26:46] It makes no sense for my existence
[26:50] without him.
[26:53] I'm crying
[26:57] for you.
[27:01] More of you is what I need. Without you,
[27:06] I cannot live.
[27:08] I need you, Lord.
[27:15] I'm desperate for you, God.
[27:22] [Music]
[27:25] Change
[27:28] from this whole body.
[27:31] But I know I will never see this thing
[27:35] if you're not within me.
[27:38] So I'm here on my knees.
[27:42] crying Jesus face me. Cuz when I see you
[27:47] can take a broken vessel and move it
[27:51] into your image
[27:57] and I'll be holding cuz I know my soul
[28:01] you can't reserve.
[28:04] But if you take me and you hold me into
[28:08] your
[28:12] I don't know I can make it for sure cuz
[28:15] I will have your Holy Spirit
[28:18] within me.
[28:22] It will be a daily walk with you Lord.
[28:25] So I'm crying out
[28:29] for your Holy Spirit.
[28:33] It makes no sense for my ex
[28:37] without
[28:44] your holy spirit.
[28:48] All you is
[28:51] without you
[28:58] always
[29:12] for your holy spirit.
[29:16] More of you is what I need. Without you,
[29:21] I cannot live.
[29:23] I need you, Lord.
[29:25] [Music]
[29:30] I'm desperate for you, Lord. I need you,
[29:33] Lord.
[29:37] I'm desperate for you, Lord.
[29:44] I'm desperate for you, Lord.
[29:53] I need you, Lord.

[38:50] That's that's uh
[38:55] that's pretty pretty much our typical
[38:58] services around here at home. Uh we just
[39:01] love the word.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; We love the word and the spirit
[39:04] responds.
[39:06] There's a responder inside here. And
[39:08] when the word comes,
[39:10] we just take it and feed on it and enjoy
[39:13] it. Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you love the word of God
[39:16] this morning? He's just given us so much
[39:19] revelation in this hour. We thank you.
[39:22] And that's what the word that's the word
[39:24] that's been coming this week. It's just
[39:26] been straight word 110%. Right out of
[39:29] the message of the hour.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's all we need. That's
[39:34] all we need as young people. Amen. Just
[39:36] the straight word of God. Amen. In our

[44:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What God has done in this
[44:58] generation for us,
[45:00] &gt;&gt; sent his word

[45:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; You're actually I'm looking I'm looking
[45:08] at the manifestation of this message.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; If the prophet was here,
[45:16] he would see
[45:18] &gt;&gt; what he labored all those years for.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And seeing the fruit
[45:24] &gt;&gt; that's come upon this young generation,
[45:28] &gt;&gt; not just the old generation. I want to
[45:30] say to you I just as an elder
[45:34] in 1967 the Lord came into my life and
[45:38] he gave me that grace and he's still
[45:40] giving me that grace. So it's possible
[45:43] people
[45:44] &gt;&gt; not just to have it one day
[45:47] &gt;&gt; but the rest of your life.
[45:50] [Applause]
[45:50] [Music]
[45:56] [Applause]
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[46:05] I've been so blessed myself with the
[46:08] ministry of the word from brother Joshua
[46:11] and brother Andrew this weekend
[46:15] and I think if I remember my right
[46:19] Friday brother Josh said there's there's
[46:21] not a message for the older people and
[46:23] the message for the young people it's
[46:24] the same message
[46:27] &gt;&gt; and it does the same work for us as
[46:29] older people as well as he'll do it for
[46:31] you
[46:32] &gt;&gt; as a young generation.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; So, I've just been blessed to hear the
[46:37] maturity of the word coming forth
[46:40] because I believe this is a season we're
[46:42] at.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; I think it's harvest time. Don't you?
[46:46] &gt;&gt; How many agree with me? It's harvest
[46:48] time.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[46:59] So, as the word goes forth this morning,
[47:02] still isn't over.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Got another service.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody needs something yet.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; But God is faithful.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Let's sing as brother Joshua comes this
[47:14] morning to brother Joshua Bennett
[47:17] ministers the word of God. Let's sing.
[47:19] He is Lord. He is Lord. He is the Lord.
[47:28] He
[47:30] is Lord. Make him your Lord this
[47:32] morning. Whatever you have need of him.

[50:37] But Lord, we want to confess right now.
[50:40] You're our Lord.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; You're the King of our hearts.
[50:45] Oh God, we're so grateful and thankful,
[50:47] Lord, to be in your presence. And Lord,
[50:52] as I was just thinking this morning
[50:54] about the ministry and the different
[50:56] ones that's had a part and and Lord, you
[51:00] just want to thank everybody. You want
[51:02] to show your gratitude to because all
[51:05] the efforts that's been made and
[51:06] sacrifices and but Lord, we don't want
[51:10] to forget to thank you.
[51:14] Lord, I think about the lepers that was
[51:16] healed and there was 10 of them, I
[51:19] believe, but one returned to give
[51:21] thanks.
[51:23] Lord, I want to be that one this morning
[51:25] is I want to come and just say thank
[51:27] you, Lord. Lord, we're so thankful, God,
[51:30] for the the different things that's been
[51:33] made possible this weekend and and and
[51:35] the ministers and the pastors and the

[51:44] they've done. But Lord, we're so
[51:47] thankful, Lord, that you've come by this
[51:49] way. Lord, because we know, Lord, that
[51:52] that's what's made the difference in
[51:53] these in these services. And Lord, we're
[51:56] just asking that you'd just come one
[51:58] more time. Lord, at the closing of this
[52:00] meeting, God, I pray, Lord, that you may
[52:02] your Holy Spirit just come. And Lord, I
[52:05] pray God that there would be something
[52:06] that just settle down into every heart
[52:08] of every young person in this building.
[52:11] Lord, that they would take it home with
[52:13] them and a and the blaze of fire that's

[54:15] the wrong way, but I'm just proud of the
[54:18] young people of this message.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:23] You know, you can say a lot of things
[54:26] and a lot of people have a lot of
[54:28] criticisms, but
[54:30] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to tell you young
[54:31] people, I'm proud of the young people.
[54:34] This is what the message of the hour
[54:35] produces.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well Josh, they ain't
[54:39] perfect." I know, but hey, hey, Amen. I
[54:42] tell you what, I'd put this group of
[54:44] young people up against any group of
[54:46] young people on the planet.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you know what? By the
[54:51] grace of God, Amen. We will prevail.
[54:55] Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Sure love you this morning. Daniel
[54:58] chapter nine,
[55:01] I'll read from the first verse.
[55:04] And you pray for my voice. I I I'm about
[55:08] it's about all gone, but Amen. I I know
[55:10] his grace is sufficient. Amen. In the
[55:13] first year of Darius, a son of a hazarus
[55:17] of the seed of the Mes, which was made
[55:19] king over the realm of the Chaldans. In
[55:21] the first year of his reign, I Daniel
[55:25] understood by books the number of years
[55:28] whereof the word of the Lord came to
[55:30] Jeremiah the prophet, that he would
[55:32] accomplish 70 years in the desolation of
[55:35] Jerusalem. and I set my face unto the
[55:39] Lord God to seek by prayer and
[55:41] supplications with fastings and
[55:44] sackcloth and ashes. I want to drop down
[55:47] to verse 20.
[55:52] And while I was speaking and praying and
[55:57] confessing my sin and the sin of my
[55:59] people Israel,
[56:01] and presenting my supplications before
[56:03] the Lord my God, for the holy mountain
[56:05] of my God, yay, whilst I was speaking in
[56:09] prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I'd
[56:12] seen in the vision at the beginning,
[56:13] being caused to fly swiftly, touch me
[56:16] about the time of the evening oblation
[56:19] or the evening sacrifice.
[56:21] and he informed me and talked with me
[56:23] and said, "Oh Daniel, I am now come
[56:25] forth to give thee skill and
[56:27] understanding."
[56:29] And at the beginning of thy
[56:30] supplications, the commandment came
[56:32] forth, and I am come to show thee, for
[56:35] thou are greatly beloved.
[56:38] Therefore, understand the matter,
[56:41] &gt;&gt; and consider the vision.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; May God add his blessings as you're
[56:45] seated this morning.
[56:48] I want to u just take for a few minutes
[56:51] and the Lord would help us maybe give
[56:54] you a little something to take home with
[56:55] you. And um I I want to speak on while I
[56:59] was praying and you can see in these
[57:02] verses of scripture that there is an
[57:04] angel, the angel Gabriel is coming to
[57:06] Daniel the prophet and he's coming while
[57:09] Daniel is in prayer. Now, there's
[57:11] something that has put Daniel in
[57:13] desperation. And and the Bible says that
[57:15] he understood by the books. He was
[57:17] actually reading the prophecies of
[57:19] Jeremiah. And as he was reading the
[57:22] prophecies of of Jeremiah, there was an
[57:24] understanding that came to him that he
[57:26] began to realize the day that he was
[57:29] living in. And he began to realize that,
[57:31] you know, that the time of deliverance
[57:34] had come. And Daniel got desperate
[57:37] before God. And the scripture says that
[57:39] he be to pray and Amen. He set his face
[57:43] to pray. Amen. And and the prophet of
[57:45] God said, "Oh God, if there was ever a
[57:47] time that we ought to be setting
[57:49] ourselves in order to pray is now. For
[57:53] we as his true servants, we see by the
[57:55] letters of the apostles, by the warnings
[57:58] of the Holy Spirit that we're in the
[58:00] last days." How many can agree with
[58:02] that? Amen. And I believe that if there
[58:05] was ever a time for the people of God to
[58:07] get desperate, it's right now. You know,
[58:10] sometimes I believe people get the wrong
[58:11] idea of desperation. You know, Brother
[58:13] Brown preaches a message, desperation,
[58:15] and a and he shows that a lot of times
[58:18] it takes uh uh you know, circumstances
[58:20] and bad things and and troubles to
[58:23] really bring out desperation. But but
[58:25] don't forget, he said it ought not to be
[58:27] that way. Amen. And this is what the
[58:30] prophet said. He said after the message
[58:32] that was preached this morning, which
[58:34] was the token, he said it ought to throw
[58:36] the entire church into desperation. I
[58:39] believe that when the word begins to
[58:41] come forth and you begin to realize the
[58:43] day that you're living in, it ought to
[58:45] make us desperate before God because we
[58:47] realize, amen, that we are living in the
[58:50] hour of the coming of the Lord. This is
[58:52] a time that a rapture is going to come
[58:54] and amen. Listen, friends, tribulation
[58:56] is getting ready to strike the the
[58:58] world. But but but we're not going into
[59:00] tribulation. Amen. Because we know we're
[59:03] going in a rapture. Amen. A but but our
[59:07] hearts has got to be desperate. Now, you
[59:09] know, I think about this, and I I don't
[59:11] want to get carried away in this part of
[59:12] it, but but I will say this. It's
[59:14] amazing to me that Daniel understood by
[59:17] the books. He understood by prophecy,
[59:19] amen, that the 70 years was accomplished
[59:21] and that God was getting ready to h
[59:24] bring uh uh the the Jews out of Babylon
[59:27] and restore Jerusalem. That's getting
[59:29] ready to happen by prophecy. He
[59:30] understood that. Amen. But Daniel didn't
[59:33] just sit back and say, "Well, you know,
[59:35] the prophet said it and God's going to
[59:37] do it and you know, and I I you know, I
[59:39] just might as well just relax and just
[59:41] just watch it play out." No. Daniel got
[59:43] desperate before God and he be to pray
[59:46] because Daniel knew that his prayer had
[59:49] something to do with it. Daniel Daniel
[59:51] also knew, listen, I know the time I'm
[59:53] living in, but I want to know how what
[59:56] that means to me. Amen. I want to know
[59:58] what the part I'm going to play in this.
[1:00:01] Listen to me, young people. It's one
[1:00:02] thing to know you're living in the end
[1:00:04] time, but it's another thing altogether
[1:00:06] to have an understanding of the hour
[1:00:08] that you're living in and know what it
[1:00:10] means to you as an individual. You got
[1:00:13] something to do with this. Amen. You got
[1:00:15] a part to play in this.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Daniel begin to pray. Now,
[1:00:20] Brother Baron would say about prayer.
[1:00:22] Amen. And I think this is s such a
[1:00:24] beautiful thing because I I I I believe
[1:00:26] that Amen. If I if God has done
[1:00:29] something for you in these meetings, I
[1:00:31] believe that there's something very
[1:00:32] important, a key that the prophet gives
[1:00:35] to us for you to keep living in a a an
[1:00:38] overcoming life. Amen. I It's very
[1:00:41] simple instructions, but but
[1:00:43] nevertheless, it's powerful because
[1:00:44] brother Brown said, "Read your Bible and
[1:00:47] pray every day." That's right.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen what the prophet said. He
[1:00:53] said, "What what man calls great, God
[1:00:55] calls foolish. And what man calls
[1:00:57] foolish, God calls great. So we've got
[1:00:59] to do the what we got to do is get back
[1:01:02] into the program of God and find out
[1:01:05] after all what God wants us to do as
[1:01:08] only way I know to do it is prayer.
[1:01:10] Prayer is the key. That's the answer.
[1:01:13] Prayer changes things. Prayer is the
[1:01:15] most powerful weapon that was ever put
[1:01:18] in the control of human beings. There's
[1:01:19] no atomic bomb. There's no hydrogen bomb
[1:01:22] as powerful as prayer. Amen. And the
[1:01:24] prophet of God said in one place he said
[1:01:27] the atomic bomb is not the most powerful
[1:01:29] weapon upon the earth today. He said a
[1:01:31] believer in contact with his maker. It's
[1:01:34] the most powerful force. Amen. That is
[1:01:36] on the planet today. Amen. He goes on to
[1:01:39] say, well the scripture I believe
[1:01:41] someplace says that devils tremble when
[1:01:44] the weakest of saints goes to their
[1:01:46] knees. Ain't that powerful? Amen. You
[1:01:50] ain't got to be the the pastor to make
[1:01:52] hell tremble.
[1:01:55] Amen. You ain't got to be an evangelist
[1:01:57] to make hell tremble. Amen. The weakest
[1:02:00] of Christians when they begin to pray.
[1:02:04] Amen. Demons begin to tremble.
[1:02:07] You see what prayer does? The prophet of
[1:02:09] God said prayer is not exactly bringing
[1:02:12] God down to man. It's bringing man up to
[1:02:14] God. See, as you pray, you lose sight of
[1:02:18] these earthly things. Amen. and and you
[1:02:21] sway out into somewhere else way beyond
[1:02:25] on and on until you come into his
[1:02:28] presence.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. James chapter 5. Amen. In verse
[1:02:32] 13, the Bible says, "Is any if any among
[1:02:35] you is afflicted, let him pray. Is any
[1:02:37] merry, let him sing songs. Is any sick
[1:02:39] among you? Let him call the elders of
[1:02:41] the church and let them pray over him,
[1:02:43] anointing with oil in the name of the
[1:02:45] Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save
[1:02:47] the sick.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; And the Lord shall raise him up, and if
[1:02:51] he's committed sin, they shall be
[1:02:53] forgiven him. Confess your faults one to
[1:02:56] another, and pray for one for another
[1:02:58] that you may be healed. Amen. Listen
[1:03:02] now. The effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:03:05] righteous man avaleth much. And then he
[1:03:08] says Eli Elias or Elijah was a man
[1:03:12] subject to lack passions as we are. And
[1:03:14] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[1:03:16] rain and it rained not for on the earth
[1:03:19] by the space of 3 years and 6 months. He
[1:03:21] prayed again and the heaven gave rain
[1:03:23] and the earth brought forth her fruit.
[1:03:25] Brother Bram said Elijah was not an
[1:03:27] angel. He was a man and he had his ups
[1:03:30] and downs. He had his troubles like we
[1:03:32] do. He had his passions. The Bible said
[1:03:34] he was a man with like passions. subject
[1:03:37] to passions as we are. He was just as
[1:03:40] apt to make a mistake as you are or I
[1:03:43] am. He's just as apt to do something
[1:03:45] wrong as you are or I am. Amen. I I just
[1:03:48] feel to stop here and say something cuz
[1:03:50] I I you know uh the devil's come along
[1:03:52] now and he and he wants to uh point out
[1:03:55] all the mistakes of our prophet and he
[1:03:58] wants to just show you every every
[1:04:00] mistake brother Ben Brandon made and and
[1:04:01] and you know what but I to me to a real
[1:04:05] believer I believe that's backfired on
[1:04:07] the enemy
[1:04:09] cuz I tell you amen if you come to tell
[1:04:12] me that William Brandon was a man I
[1:04:13] already knew that. Amen. But I tell you
[1:04:16] what, every time you show me a mistake
[1:04:18] he made, it gives me more faith. Amen.
[1:04:21] Because I just look at it like this. If
[1:04:23] God could take a man like that with all
[1:04:26] them failures that made all them
[1:04:29] mistakes and do what he did in his life,
[1:04:33] there's hope for me too, brother. If God
[1:04:35] can use a man like Elijah with his ups
[1:04:39] and his downs. Amen. He listen, he can
[1:04:42] use you.
[1:04:45] He was just a man.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; He was just as apt to make a mistake as
[1:04:49] you are. But he earnestly prayed.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen what the prophet said. He
[1:04:55] said, "And God listen to a mortal's
[1:04:57] prayer." And I say this with all true
[1:05:00] reverence. There's not another force on
[1:05:01] the earth. There's nothing on the earth,
[1:05:03] no matter what it is, what kind of gift
[1:05:05] it is. There is nothing in the world
[1:05:07] that will come ahead of prayer. Prayer
[1:05:10] is what does the work.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] Now, as Daniel began to pray, and I I I
[1:05:18] again, I don't want to spend a lot of
[1:05:20] time cuz I got some things I'd really
[1:05:21] like to share with you, but as Daniel
[1:05:24] began to pray, the Bible says he made
[1:05:25] his confession.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; I think it's pretty amazing because when
[1:05:29] Daniel begins to pray, you know, I I I
[1:05:32] look in the scriptures sometimes and
[1:05:34] some of the prayers that are recorded in
[1:05:35] the Bible, I believe that they're wrote
[1:05:38] in the and they're recorded in the
[1:05:39] scripture. Amen. For our benefit.
[1:05:42] Amen. I if if God thought so much of a
[1:05:45] prayer that he had it recorded in the
[1:05:47] scripture, then there's got to be
[1:05:49] something in that for our benefit. You
[1:05:51] know, a lot of times we call we we Jesus
[1:05:54] the disciples come to Jesus said, "Teach
[1:05:56] us to pray." And we call that the Lord's
[1:05:58] prayer. Really wasn't the Lord's prayer
[1:06:00] as much as it is our prayer, but Amen.
[1:06:02] But the prophet called it a model
[1:06:04] prayer. So Jesus was just giving us amen
[1:06:08] prayer to to to model our prayers after.
[1:06:10] Amen. And you'll find out, amen, that
[1:06:13] when Jesus, amen, be to teach us to
[1:06:15] pray, he said, when you pray, pray on
[1:06:17] this wise. Our Father, who art in
[1:06:19] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Amen. Thy
[1:06:23] kingdom come, thy will be done. Amen.
[1:06:27] Amen. He said, forgive us. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:30] So you see, Amen. Jesus is telling you
[1:06:32] that when you approach God, Amen. You
[1:06:35] want to first of all let him know how
[1:06:36] great he is.
[1:06:40] You see this in Daniel's prayer. Amen.
[1:06:42] As Daniel started praying, he said he he
[1:06:44] said unto the Lord my God. Amen. He
[1:06:46] said, "I prayed unto the Lord my God and
[1:06:48] made my confession and said,"Oh Lord,
[1:06:50] the great and dreadful God, keeping the
[1:06:52] covenant of mercy to them that love him,
[1:06:55] to them that keeps his commandments."
[1:06:56] Amen. In the next verse, he said, "We
[1:06:59] have sinned."
[1:07:01] Now,
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch something here
[1:07:03] because, Amen. When Daniel was taken
[1:07:05] captive into Babylon, he was just a
[1:07:07] teenager. He was just a young boy.
[1:07:10] Amen. A and they were in Babylon because
[1:07:13] of the sin of Israel. But Daniel never
[1:07:16] stood there and said they sinned.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; He said we sinned.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Tell you something, friends. Amen. When
[1:07:25] you get ready to make a confession
[1:07:27] before God, Amen. Listen, I'll just say
[1:07:29] it to you this way. They prayers and
[1:07:31] them prayers don't go nowhere.
[1:07:34] when it's always they and them and
[1:07:37] somebody else. Amen. But now when you
[1:07:39] start praying like this, it's me.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; We
[1:07:44] Amen. Listen, you could argue the point
[1:07:47] that Daniel didn't have nothing to do
[1:07:48] with the sin of Israel and the reason of
[1:07:51] their captivity. But when Daniel got
[1:07:53] ready to pray, he said, "We have
[1:07:55] sinned." He didn't stand there and make
[1:07:57] excuse. He didn't stand there, Amen. and
[1:07:59] try to amen make all kind of excuses for
[1:08:02] Amen. while they were there. Amen. And
[1:08:04] the reason that they have come short,
[1:08:05] but Daniel just said, "We come short. We
[1:08:08] have sinned."
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I tell you like this is I I
[1:08:15] read a story and uh and they said there
[1:08:18] was a back in the 50s. They said there
[1:08:21] was this sister in a meeting and she
[1:08:23] stood up and she said, "Pastor,
[1:08:25] pray for me that I would love the people
[1:08:28] of God more."
[1:08:32] And she and the pastor said, "Sister,
[1:08:34] anybody could say that."
[1:08:37] I mean, you know, most I think about,
[1:08:39] man, them old rugged men of God, they
[1:08:41] just,
[1:08:43] you know, she he knew she didn't really
[1:08:45] mean business cuz she was just saying
[1:08:47] she was making a half-hearted
[1:08:49] confession. I'm lacking something. But
[1:08:52] she put it in a way that I already love
[1:08:54] people. I just want to love them more.
[1:09:00] So he said, "Anybody can say that." And
[1:09:02] after a while, she stood up again. She
[1:09:04] said, "Pastor," she said, "my sharp
[1:09:07] tongue has caused all kind of trouble in
[1:09:09] this church." He looked over at the
[1:09:11] deacon. He said, "Now she's talking."
[1:09:15] That's real confession right there. Oh,
[1:09:18] now she's talking. Amen. Listen, Ren,
[1:09:20] when you get to business with God, Amen.
[1:09:22] you start really confessing him. You
[1:09:24] won't be just come and say, "Oh, Lord,
[1:09:26] if I've done anything, if I failed you."
[1:09:28] No, you'll be saying, "Lord, forgive me.
[1:09:31] I come up short. I'm a sinner." Amen. I
[1:09:34] I failed you. Amen. But I believe your
[1:09:36] grace. There's a power in you. Listen. I
[1:09:40] ain't got the ability. I don't have the
[1:09:42] strength, but I believe your grace is
[1:09:44] sufficient for me.
[1:09:50] And Daniel was praying and make his his
[1:09:52] confession. Amen. And I think it's just
[1:09:55] beautiful because as Daniel, you can
[1:09:56] read it when you get home. Daniel, Amen,
[1:09:58] begin to confess before God. And Daniel
[1:10:01] comes towards the end of that prayer. He
[1:10:02] said, "Now therefore, oh God, hear the
[1:10:04] prayer of thy servant." Amen. In his
[1:10:06] supplication and cause thy face to shine
[1:10:09] upon thy sanctuary. Amen. That is
[1:10:11] desolate for the Lord's sake. Amen. I
[1:10:14] love Daniel's prayer. I love his desire.
[1:10:16] Amen. Listen, friends. Daniel could have
[1:10:17] prayed for a lot of things and and and
[1:10:19] there was a lot of things that Israel
[1:10:21] needed at that point. Them them them
[1:10:22] Jews that were in captivity, they needed
[1:10:24] Daniel could have got Amen. He could
[1:10:26] have, you know, went through a whole
[1:10:27] list of things that the church needed.
[1:10:29] But Daniel knew, amen, if the face of
[1:10:32] God would shine upon them that every
[1:10:34] need they had would be supplied.
[1:10:38] I tell you, it's just something long
[1:10:40] like this. Amen. You got a a sick baby.
[1:10:43] Amen. You could write, you could you
[1:10:45] could tell, you could speak to, you
[1:10:47] know, 10 or 12 things that that baby
[1:10:49] needs, but you can wrap it all up in
[1:10:52] this, that baby needs this mama.
[1:10:55] Cuz if that baby ever gets this mama,
[1:10:58] amen, every one of them needs it has
[1:11:00] will be met. Cuz that mama ain't going
[1:11:02] to rest until that baby, Amen, the needs
[1:11:04] of that baby is supplied. And I tell you
[1:11:06] this, there's a lot of things the church
[1:11:08] needs. There's a lot of thing you need.
[1:11:10] There's a lot of things our youth need,
[1:11:12] but it can all be wrapped up in this
[1:11:14] this morning. What we need is God.
[1:11:18] What we need is a touch from the master.
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Daniel is praying with understanding
[1:11:31] friends. Now
[1:11:35] I want to come to my point now.
[1:11:39] He says, "Oh Lord,"
[1:11:43] he said, "forgive and hearken." Listen
[1:11:46] what the brother would say. You see his
[1:11:48] prayer? He made his confession of his
[1:11:51] people, a confession of himself. He
[1:11:53] wanted to be sure that he found out when
[1:11:56] they were to go back because he wanted
[1:11:59] to get the people ready to go back. And
[1:12:02] what I'm trying to do is find out when
[1:12:04] we're going up
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; and get the people ready to go up.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we've set our face to
[1:12:14] God through prayers and supplication to
[1:12:15] find out, Lord, what is the hour that
[1:12:18] we're living in? Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And while I was speaking and praying and
[1:12:24] confessing my sin and the sin of my
[1:12:26] people Israel, and presenting my
[1:12:28] supplication before the Lord my God, the
[1:12:30] holy mountain of my God, yay. While I
[1:12:32] was speaking in prayer, even the man
[1:12:33] Gabriel, whom I've seen in the vision at
[1:12:36] the beginning, being caused to fly
[1:12:38] swiftly, touch me. Amen. Amen. While
[1:12:42] Daniel was praying,
[1:12:45] the answer was coming.
[1:12:47] Listen
[1:12:49] friends, I tell you this. Sometimes,
[1:12:51] Amen. the answer is already on the way
[1:12:54] before you ever pray.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the answer is already here
[1:13:00] before you ever pray. Amen. Listen,
[1:13:03] friends. My Bible says, Amen, that our
[1:13:05] father knows the things we have need of
[1:13:07] before we ever ask it.
[1:13:10] And sometimes while you're praying,
[1:13:12] there's an immediate answer. Sometimes
[1:13:14] the answer was there all along and you
[1:13:16] just didn't know it. Can you say amen?
[1:13:20] Amen. But I tell you what, there's other
[1:13:22] times that you pray and pray and there
[1:13:24] seems to be no answer.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So what are you going to do then? What
[1:13:29] will you do if the answer don't come
[1:13:30] when you pray?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm encouraging with this cuz
[1:13:34] maybe somebody come through the prayer
[1:13:36] line last night and you say, "Well, I
[1:13:38] come but I don't feel no different. I
[1:13:41] didn't feel nothing."
[1:13:43] Amen. Well, what are you going to do?
[1:13:44] You're just going to say, "Well, there
[1:13:45] wasn't nothing to it." Amen. I guess God
[1:13:47] didn't hear my prayer. Amen. Well, we
[1:13:49] got another example in the book of
[1:13:51] Daniel. Amen. The Bible said he prayed
[1:13:53] for 3 weeks, 21 days, he prayed and
[1:13:56] sought the Lord. Amen. Amen. And on the
[1:13:59] 21st day, Amen. Gabriel came to him and
[1:14:01] said, "Daniel, I heard your Amen. Your
[1:14:04] prayer was heard from the first day you
[1:14:07] prayed it.
[1:14:08] But there was a war going on."
[1:14:12] Hallelujah. There was a battle going on
[1:14:15] in another realm.
[1:14:18] Amen. But Michael came by my side.
[1:14:21] Hallelujah. Amen. Listen to me, church.
[1:14:23] I want to tell you. Listen, young
[1:14:25] people. Amen. You might have prayed and
[1:14:27] maybe you didn't feel nothing, but just
[1:14:29] keep holding on.
[1:14:31] I can tell you something. With the
[1:14:33] assurity of the word this word, the
[1:14:35] answer is on the way.
[1:14:40] Hallelujah. Amen. And even right now,
[1:14:43] Amen. There's a battle that's raging.
[1:14:46] Hallelujah. But Michael the great
[1:14:48] warrior. Amen. He'll clear the way.
[1:14:52] [Applause]
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, brother Ram said. He
[1:14:56] said, "When God does says anything, it
[1:14:59] has to take place."
[1:15:02] So when you meet God's qualifications,
[1:15:04] you just remember God will manifest
[1:15:07] himself and take care of the rest of it.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You just go ahead. It's a finished work.
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ain't that wonderful?" Well,
[1:15:19] just think. Amen. You just tell God and
[1:15:21] say, "Well, you you you do this and I'll
[1:15:23] do this." Well, I I if I go and do this,
[1:15:26] then in other words, what brother Brown
[1:15:28] was saying, if you meet the
[1:15:30] qualifications of God's word, God's
[1:15:32] obligated to do his part.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; He said God has to do that.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Now, the devil will say he delays.
[1:15:42] That don't make any difference.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; See how you see how the enemy works?
[1:15:49] Some if something don't happen
[1:15:50] immediate,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; then the enem is right there
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; to discourage.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "That don't make no
[1:16:01] difference."
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Daniel prayed,
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. 21 days before the angel ever got
[1:16:07] to him. But he wasn't discouraged.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; He knowed it would come anyhow.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; He just waited till he got there. That's
[1:16:17] right. Amen. That's when you're getting
[1:16:19] faith. Don't get discouraged. Just wait
[1:16:22] until it gets there.
[1:16:24] [Applause]
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. And Amen. cuz I I
[1:16:29] I I'm right where I want to be right
[1:16:32] now. So,
[1:16:34] Daniel said, "And while I was speaking,
[1:16:36] while I was praying, the man Gabriel
[1:16:38] come." You know, I was thinking about
[1:16:40] this the other day, and I thought this
[1:16:43] section of the book of Daniel could be
[1:16:44] titled, "How the angel came to me. Come
[1:16:47] on. Come on.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; I And you know people, we hear about how
[1:16:52] the angel comes to brother Brandham and
[1:16:54] he describes him as a man.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Well, Daniel said the man, he called him
[1:16:59] a man,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Gabriel. Amen. He's talking about an
[1:17:02] angel coming to him. Amen. He's coming
[1:17:04] like a man. Now, I just want to say this
[1:17:06] now. None of us has got the ministry of
[1:17:08] a prophet. We're not going to have that
[1:17:10] kind of experience. Amen. But I do
[1:17:12] believe that angels can come to the
[1:17:14] church. Angels can come to a believer.
[1:17:16] Amen. Hebrews 1:13. Amen. But which of
[1:17:19] the angels said he at any time sit on my
[1:17:21] right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:17:23] enemies thy foottool? Are they not all
[1:17:26] ministering spirits sent forth to
[1:17:28] minister to them who are the heirs of
[1:17:30] salvation? Listen what brother saying.
[1:17:32] God still has angels. Amen. They visit
[1:17:34] people. Not the worship of angels but
[1:17:36] angelic beings. Amen. Who are attributes
[1:17:39] of God sent forth to minister to the
[1:17:41] church. Amen. Through the people. Amen.
[1:17:44] And brother Brown would talk about
[1:17:45] Zachcharias and Elizabeth and how that
[1:17:48] Amen. Gabriel came amen to their and
[1:17:50] visited them visited them. He said you
[1:17:52] know why? He said they were them good
[1:17:54] Christian people amen that believe God.
[1:17:57] He said they had a house amen that an
[1:18:00] angel could come to.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said you know why I think
[1:18:05] today the reason we don't have no more
[1:18:07] angelic visitations than we do. Amen. We
[1:18:10] who call ourselves Christians play cards
[1:18:12] half the night. Amen. Read true story
[1:18:15] magazines. Amen. Got beer in the ice
[1:18:18] box. Amen. Listen, that's the reason
[1:18:20] angels don't visit us. You can't mix oil
[1:18:22] and water.
[1:18:24] Oh, I love what the brother I'm just an
[1:18:27] oldfashioned sassifr
[1:18:29] Holy Ghost secondb born preacher. And I
[1:18:32] believe in an oldfashioned cornbread.
[1:18:35] Amen. Sauerkraut potatoes. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:39] It ain't ice cream, but it'll stick to
[1:18:41] your ribs and carry you through. I
[1:18:43] believe in an old time Holy Ghost
[1:18:45] salvation that cleanses a man's heart.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah. He said, "That's all I got
[1:18:50] to say about." I tell you what, you want
[1:18:52] to see the supernatural back in your
[1:18:54] home? Amen. Clean the shelves off. Amen.
[1:18:57] You want to see God in your life? Clean
[1:19:00] out your playlist.
[1:19:02] Clean up your cell phone. Amen. Come on,
[1:19:06] church. Amen. You want to see angels
[1:19:08] come back in the church. Amen. Let's
[1:19:11] clean the church out from the pullpit to
[1:19:13] the back door. Let's get back to an
[1:19:15] oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:19:19] sky blue sinkilling saint. Power
[1:19:23] revival.
[1:19:26] Brother, you get down, you'll begin to
[1:19:28] see supernatural visitations.
[1:19:34] It's amazing to me because when the when
[1:19:36] the when the angel came to Daniel, he
[1:19:39] found him in desperation and prayer.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people wonder, well, you know,
[1:19:45] I just don't I just can't I I I don't
[1:19:48] know why I can't live an overcoming
[1:19:50] life. I don't know why, you know, not
[1:19:53] I'm not trying to beat you up. Not at
[1:19:54] all.
[1:19:56] Amen. But I tell you this, you can't
[1:19:58] feed on the things of the world all the
[1:20:00] time.
[1:20:02] and expect to live an overcoming life.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; You want to have a testimony like
[1:20:09] Daniel, get back in the book.
[1:20:14] You want to see Listen, I'll show you
[1:20:15] where his revival started while he was
[1:20:17] down there in Babylon. He was reading
[1:20:19] the books of Jeremiah.
[1:20:21] Oh, come on, church. Amen. I'll tell you
[1:20:24] what. You want to have a revival? Amen.
[1:20:26] Get them tapes out. Amen. Get your Amen.
[1:20:28] Get that table app on your phone and
[1:20:31] start listening to the message of the
[1:20:32] hour, brother. It'll bring an
[1:20:35] understanding to you, too. Amen. And get
[1:20:38] a desperation in your heart.
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:42] You get people praying in the pews and a
[1:20:45] preacher praying in his office, you're
[1:20:47] going to hear from heaven, brother.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like I I feel good right now.
[1:20:55] And I just going to say something.
[1:20:56] Listen, friends. We Amen. We've heard a
[1:20:58] lot of good sermons and good preaching.
[1:21:00] It's got to be more than that. I say we
[1:21:03] need some men of God back in the pull
[1:21:04] pit that's prayed through, that's found
[1:21:06] the will of God. Amen. That's found even
[1:21:09] the message for that need in that
[1:21:11] moment.
[1:21:13] We ain't here to entertain.
[1:21:18] This is not entertainment.
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:21] We're trying to find out when we're
[1:21:23] going up and get you ready.
[1:21:27] Hallelujah. Come on, church. And I tell
[1:21:30] you what, I might as well preach. Amen.
[1:21:32] Cuz I tell you, Amen. There's people sit
[1:21:34] around in church and complain all the
[1:21:36] time.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; I wish the song leader would sing
[1:21:41] something different. And I I wish they
[1:21:43] wouldn't sing that song. They sung it
[1:21:44] last week. And then the preacher comes
[1:21:47] back and said, "Why don't he ever preach
[1:21:49] on the seven seals or on the other hand?
[1:21:51] Why don't he ever preach on the Holy
[1:21:53] Ghost?" And they just don't preach on
[1:21:55] and
[1:22:00] You want your pastor to preach something
[1:22:02] different, pray.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Stop complaining and pray.
[1:22:09] I tell you what, if you need to hear
[1:22:10] from God and you get desperate and you
[1:22:13] start praying, God can take a man
[1:22:16] completely off his notes and bring him
[1:22:19] right to your address.
[1:22:25] I say, "Oh God," Amen. Give us some
[1:22:27] mamas and daddies, amen, that pray. Give
[1:22:31] us some preachers that pray. Give us
[1:22:33] some young people that pray.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And while Daniel was praying,
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; there's all kind of examples of this in
[1:22:49] the scripture. I I'm going to go through
[1:22:51] a few of them right quick,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; but
[1:22:56] there's a man one time by the name of
[1:22:57] Cornelius, a gentile,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says
[1:23:04] that he prayed all to God always
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and he saw a vision
[1:23:14] while he was praying.
[1:23:17] God come to him.
[1:23:20] A message come to Cornelius and said,
[1:23:22] "Your prayers and your arms has reached
[1:23:25] unto God as a memorial."
[1:23:29] And he said, "You take men and send them
[1:23:31] down to and you find a man by by the
[1:23:33] name of Peter
[1:23:36] and tell and get him to come." And the
[1:23:39] next morning, while them men was on the
[1:23:41] way down there to get Peter, Peter went
[1:23:43] up, Amen. that afternoon on the on the
[1:23:45] on the rooftop. Amen. To begin to pray,
[1:23:49] Amen. And while Peter was praying, a
[1:23:51] vision broke out. Amen. And God be to
[1:23:54] show Peter a vision. Amen. Of a beast,
[1:23:57] Amen. Because Peter was in hunger. Amen.
[1:24:00] And he saw one of them beasts that they
[1:24:01] weren't allowed to eat. And and and the
[1:24:03] and the and the an instruction came to
[1:24:05] rise, kill, and eat. And Peter said,
[1:24:07] "Oh, not so, Lord. I I never touch
[1:24:10] anything like that." Amen. But what he
[1:24:12] didn't understand is there's a man, a
[1:24:14] gentile
[1:24:18] that they thought was unclean, but his
[1:24:20] prayer had reached to heaven. Oh, I
[1:24:23] could preach on out a little while.
[1:24:24] Amen. Listen friends, you might think,
[1:24:26] Amen. You might look at somebody and
[1:24:28] think they just too far gone and there
[1:24:30] ain't no hope for them. But I tell you
[1:24:33] this, amen. It be good for us to hear
[1:24:35] the same message Peter heard. Don't you
[1:24:37] never call something unclean that the
[1:24:39] Holy Ghost has cleansed.
[1:24:43] Hallelujah. Some of you young people
[1:24:45] might have come here dirty, but brother,
[1:24:48] you've been washed
[1:24:50] in the washing of the water of the word.
[1:24:53] And when the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:56] cleanses the heart, what God cleans is
[1:24:59] clean.
[1:25:04] The point I'm trying to make is this.
[1:25:06] Cornelius was praying and God came.
[1:25:10] Now at the same time he was working on
[1:25:12] the other end.
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The end of that story is
[1:25:20] this. Amen. Peter went down there to the
[1:25:22] house of Cornelius
[1:25:24] and while he be to preach,
[1:25:28] the Bible says while he yet spake these
[1:25:31] words, the Holy Ghost fell on them.
[1:25:35] Come on, church. Showing us the way for
[1:25:38] the Gentile to receive.
[1:25:40] Listen, I want to tell you something.
[1:25:42] You might be sitting here this morning
[1:25:43] think, well, I missed my opportunity.
[1:25:46] Saturday night is gone. There ain't no
[1:25:48] more prayer line. But listen, I got some
[1:25:50] good news for you. If you got a need
[1:25:52] this morning, even while the word is
[1:25:55] going forth,
[1:25:57] you can receive healing and salvation
[1:26:00] and the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:03] You don't even have to have somebody lay
[1:26:05] hands on you.
[1:26:08] The the power is in the word.
[1:26:12] You just start praying right now and see
[1:26:15] if the same God of this Bible is not the
[1:26:18] same yesterday, today, and forever. If
[1:26:20] he did it for Cornelius, he'll do it for
[1:26:22] you.
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Think about this
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; because a little bit later in the book
[1:26:37] of Acts, Peter's thrown into prison.
[1:26:43] And Peter was kept in the prison. But
[1:26:45] the Bible says, "But prayer was
[1:26:46] continually offered."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And while Peter was down there in
[1:26:52] prison, there was having a prayer
[1:26:54] meeting at John Mark's house.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; And while they were praying,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; an angel come into prison
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; woke Peter up and said, "Come follow me.
[1:27:12] You know what? Amen. And they're down
[1:27:14] there praying at John Mark's house and
[1:27:15] all of a sudden there's a knock on the
[1:27:17] door.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And there's a little girl
[1:27:23] went out there and looked out the window
[1:27:24] at the door. She come back and said,
[1:27:26] "Hey, Peter's standing at the door."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And they said, "It can't be."
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; No, you're mistaken. It can't be. I I
[1:27:38] think that story is amazing.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; They're praying for Peter's deliverance.
[1:27:43] The answer is knocking on the door.
[1:27:50] A little girl.
[1:27:53] Oh, you can you can say everything you
[1:27:55] want to say about that little girl, but
[1:27:57] I tell you what. Amen. She had enough
[1:27:59] faith to go look out the window and tell
[1:28:02] them the answer that you're looking for
[1:28:05] and standing out the door. Oh, come on.
[1:28:08] Some of them other people so caught up
[1:28:09] in tradition and everything else, they
[1:28:11] thought, "Ain't no way. Couldn't be."
[1:28:13] Amen. We've been praying for Oh, come
[1:28:15] on, church. How many times this church
[1:28:17] is praying for a revival and the answer
[1:28:20] comes knocking on the door?
[1:28:23] Thank God we got some young people
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:29] that's got enough faith to at least go
[1:28:31] look and say, "Hey, what y'all praying
[1:28:34] for is here."
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:39] This ain't no ghost.
[1:28:42] This ain't no work up. This is a
[1:28:45] revival.
[1:28:47] This is the answer to the prayer.
[1:28:51] Hallelujah. I say let one of these young
[1:28:53] people, you come back to your church and
[1:28:55] just open up the door and let the answer
[1:28:58] come walking in.
[1:29:01] Hallelujah. I say open up the door this
[1:29:04] morning. Say, "Hey, we've been praying.
[1:29:06] We've been praying for a move of God.
[1:29:08] We've been praying for deliverance, but
[1:29:10] I believe that the answer has come in
[1:29:13] True Word Tabernacle Camp. It's knocking
[1:29:17] at the door.
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:27] Hallelujah.
[1:29:30] My goodness. I could I I I could preach
[1:29:33] all day, example after example after
[1:29:35] example.
[1:29:37] while I just got to study it while I
[1:29:41] prayed,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; while he was praying, while they prayed,
[1:29:45] while I mean, just every which way I
[1:29:47] could put it. And you'll find out that
[1:29:50] God comes on the scene when people start
[1:29:52] praying.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; One of the most powerful things I found
[1:29:58] is brother Brown talking about Samson.
[1:30:02] And he said, "Here Samson was in a
[1:30:04] defeated.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; He'd been he'd been, you know, deceived
[1:30:13] by Delilah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Brown types that
[1:30:18] with the church, deceived church by the
[1:30:20] world."
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had been deceived. His he his
[1:30:24] his uh the locks of his hair, a sign of
[1:30:27] his covenant was cut off. His eyes was
[1:30:30] put out. He's standing there in that
[1:30:32] condition. Amen. And here they are
[1:30:35] celebrating a victory over a Jehovah's
[1:30:37] servant.
[1:30:39] Brother B said, "But what they forgot?"
[1:30:42] They were looking at a defeated man
[1:30:44] standing there in shame. He said, "But
[1:30:47] they forgot to watch. They forgot to
[1:30:50] realize that the locks of his hair
[1:30:52] started growing back out again.
[1:30:55] They didn't see the tears coming out of
[1:30:58] them dry sockets.
[1:31:01] Oh, hallelujah. They didn't see his lips
[1:31:04] begin to quiver and words begin to come
[1:31:07] out.
[1:31:09] And Sans begin to say, "Lord, I'm a
[1:31:11] failure."
[1:31:13] Amen. I'm a failure. I I failed you,
[1:31:16] Lord. Amen. But Sensson all the time was
[1:31:19] feeling them locks growing again. And I
[1:31:21] can hear as brother Nathan said last
[1:31:23] night for the final kill. I can hear a
[1:31:26] quote of the prophet. He said, "Amen."
[1:31:28] There's a new shock of hair that's
[1:31:30] growing out.
[1:31:35] Come on. I believe that some of these
[1:31:37] young people are a part of that new
[1:31:40] shock of hell.
[1:31:42] Boy, is there a session in the building
[1:31:44] this morning? Do you feel the rocks
[1:31:47] going? Do you feel it on your shoulder?
[1:31:52] Hallelujah. And the tears begin to fall.
[1:31:54] Even the words begin to come. Oh God, is
[1:31:57] there a possibility?
[1:31:59] Could you move one more time? Just once
[1:32:03] more, Lord. Just once more. Let me tell
[1:32:06] you something, friends. We don't just
[1:32:07] have a possibility. We have a promise
[1:32:10] this morning.
[1:32:13] You have a promise. The revival is not
[1:32:16] over.
[1:32:18] It ain't behind us.
[1:32:21] We are not looking back.
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Oh my," he said,
[1:32:33] "And while he was praying, while he was
[1:32:36] praying," Amen. and making his honest
[1:32:39] confession, every fiber in his body
[1:32:42] begin to vibrate.
[1:32:45] Oh God, if the body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:47] could just stand as one, every fiber and
[1:32:49] every member begin to vibrate with a
[1:32:52] literal baptism of the Holy Ghost again.
[1:32:54] Amen. Not new members, not in shaking
[1:32:57] hands or some kind of creed, but when
[1:32:59] the body of Christ could stand like
[1:33:01] Samson.
[1:33:03] Church, I tell you, Amen. I ain't just
[1:33:05] trying to excite you. Amen. Because I
[1:33:07] tell you what, Samson had to be really
[1:33:09] had to be ready to pay the price for
[1:33:12] that revival.
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:17] Samson had to get to a place that he was
[1:33:19] willing to die with his enemy.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, young people, until
[1:33:25] you're ready to die with that enemy,
[1:33:28] you will not see the victory.
[1:33:31] Come on. You can't walk through a prayer
[1:33:33] line and defeat lust until you're ready
[1:33:36] to die with it.
[1:33:38] You got to die with that enemy. The
[1:33:41] desire has got to die.
[1:33:46] But when we get some substance that's
[1:33:48] ready to die with the enemy, then the
[1:33:51] testimony will be this. He defeated more
[1:33:54] in the end than he ever did in the
[1:33:56] beginning.
[1:34:02] Listen,
[1:34:07] even even even our Lord
[1:34:10] standing I'm just trying to move through
[1:34:12] it and I'm coming to something. But
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; even our Lord standing in the garden of
[1:34:16] Gethsemane, probably one of the greatest
[1:34:18] examples I could give
[1:34:21] of of an angel coming in prayer.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus is standing there under the the
[1:34:28] the weight of the world, the sins of the
[1:34:31] world upon him. the a great burden that
[1:34:33] he was under. Sweat become his blood.
[1:34:37] He's praying a prayer. Oh God, he said,
[1:34:40] Lord, let this if there's any way, let
[1:34:43] the cup pass. He said, nevertheless, not
[1:34:45] thy will
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; but thine be done.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And an angel came
[1:34:53] to him and strengthened him."
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] Oh, that's good.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Even he prayed Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You see, it's all through the scripture,
[1:35:04] friends. What about in our day?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I I I would not have time.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; I just would not have time.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I just want to take just a few examples.
[1:35:17] You know, Brother Brand, one thing stood
[1:35:19] out to me. I was reading the other day,
[1:35:20] Brother Bram said he was in a meeting
[1:35:21] and he's praying. He said one of the
[1:35:23] first cases come up on the platform was
[1:35:25] a boy. He said he began to pray
[1:35:29] and he said and while I was praying for
[1:35:31] the boy, he said a light be to be get
[1:35:33] real bright and he said I thought the
[1:35:36] custodian or somebody had turned the
[1:35:38] lights up. He said and he said and I was
[1:35:40] just praying for the uh the young boy.
[1:35:42] He said he this crippled boy and he said
[1:35:45] that light just kept getting he said so
[1:35:46] I looked and he said and I seen he said
[1:35:48] this great light coming down. He said it
[1:35:51] was the morning star
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; coming down. He said just hovered right
[1:35:55] over
[1:35:57] He said, "I don't know." He said, "I
[1:35:59] don't know if I dropped the the the
[1:36:00] child or or what just happened." He
[1:36:02] said, "But when he hit the floor, he
[1:36:04] took off running."
[1:36:08] He said, "By that time, the mother of
[1:36:11] the boy started screaming."
[1:36:14] Come on, friends. You can criticize all
[1:36:16] the screaming and all that. Amen. But I
[1:36:18] tell you, the prophet said it happened
[1:36:19] in his meetings, too. While they were
[1:36:22] praying, Amen. And and the morning star
[1:36:24] came. Amen. And a crippled boy was
[1:36:26] healed. The mother began to scream. She
[1:36:28] fainted on the floor. And brother Brown
[1:36:30] said, "And while that was happening,
[1:36:31] there's a little Nazarene girl playing
[1:36:33] the piano." Amen. And she got so
[1:36:35] excited, she jumped to her feet, lifted
[1:36:38] up her hands. He said, "And the spirit
[1:36:39] of God," Amen. just continued to play
[1:36:42] the keys of the piano. The great
[1:36:44] physician now is here, the sympathizing
[1:36:46] Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. The Holy Ghost
[1:36:49] come at me. Amen. The music begin to
[1:36:52] play. Oh. Amen. What brought that down?
[1:36:54] a man praying, a man standing in his
[1:36:57] position,
[1:36:59] knowing the authority he had as a son of
[1:37:01] God, and he be to pray.
[1:37:06] Another place, brother was talking
[1:37:07] about, Amen. He was talking about how
[1:37:09] that he was standing out there, and he
[1:37:11] said he'd been on on the on the porch
[1:37:13] and he he said his daddy was on his
[1:37:16] heart and he was praying for his daddy.
[1:37:17] He said, "Lord, don't let my daddy be
[1:37:20] lost." He's praying for his soul. Yeah.
[1:37:23] And while he was praying, brother B
[1:37:24] said, while I was praying, he said, I
[1:37:26] looked towards the east and a vision
[1:37:29] broke. He said, and you know many of you
[1:37:32] know what it was. He said it was the
[1:37:33] Lord Jesus. And the Lord Jesus come to
[1:37:36] him. Amen. While he was in prayer, Amen.
[1:37:38] And he seen that man. He said, standing
[1:37:40] out there in that broom say spilled.
[1:37:42] Amen. And he was hovering just above.
[1:37:44] Amen. And he said he cleared his throat
[1:37:46] and he pinched himself. He done all
[1:37:48] these things. He said, but after a
[1:37:49] while, he got the courage up. He said,
[1:37:50] "Jesus," he said, "and he turned and
[1:37:52] looked at me." Amen. He said, "When I
[1:37:54] woke up," he said, "my my my my pajama
[1:37:57] shirt was completely soaking wet." Amen.
[1:38:00] Under the under the power of that
[1:38:01] vision, just one look from him and it
[1:38:04] changed him. He said, "I'll never be the
[1:38:07] same."
[1:38:09] Hallelujah. And I want to tell you,
[1:38:11] Amen. If you want to see Jesus,
[1:38:15] if you pray like he prayed,
[1:38:18] you can see him, too.
[1:38:21] Hallelujah. And he'll change your life.
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; He's standing up in Canyon.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; We tell it all the time. The sword come
[1:38:36] in his hand. But you know what that
[1:38:38] prophet was doing when that sword come
[1:38:39] in his hand? He was standing there with
[1:38:41] his hands lifted to heaven praying to
[1:38:44] God, "What must I do? Lord, what must I
[1:38:47] do? Well, God, give me. He was praying
[1:38:50] to God and he said, "And something
[1:38:52] struck my hand. The word came to the
[1:38:55] prophet while he was in prayer."
[1:38:59] Come on, church. Listen to me, young
[1:39:02] people. Don't you never fail to get this
[1:39:04] point? Amen. You want an understanding
[1:39:06] of this message? Pray.
[1:39:11] You can't read Revelation out of a book.
[1:39:14] I can't give it to you. Brother Andrew
[1:39:16] can't give it to you. There's only one
[1:39:18] that can give you the revelation and
[1:39:21] that's Christ himself, the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:24] Hallelujah. That's why I prophesy above
[1:39:27] all else, pray for revelation.
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:33] And I promise you, if you start praying,
[1:39:35] God, the understanding will come.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I feel it. I I feel I feel the
[1:39:43] inspiration of the Holy Spirit to tell
[1:39:45] you this. Quit trying to figure it out
[1:39:48] like a math a math equation.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to work out everything and
[1:39:54] make everything fit.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Quit arguing with it.
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to prove it. If there's
[1:40:06] something you don't understand, just lay
[1:40:07] it on the shelf and say, "God, I believe
[1:40:10] it anyhow." I may not understand it, but
[1:40:13] I believe it. And you just start
[1:40:14] praying. And I promise you this, God
[1:40:17] will send your pastor to the pull pit
[1:40:19] and he'll open up this Bible and the
[1:40:22] answer you've been looking for will come
[1:40:24] to you.
[1:40:28] Don't get a misunderstanding what we
[1:40:30] preach. You ain't got to understand it.
[1:40:31] Just believe it. The true understanding
[1:40:33] of the word will come to the eagle of
[1:40:35] the hour. God didn't reveal this message
[1:40:38] to keep you in the dark.
[1:40:41] If you want to know it, you can know it.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Pray
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; the word will come to you.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; we brought it all the way down out of
[1:41:06] the Bible, all the way down in Brother
[1:41:09] Brown's ministry.
[1:41:10] I got a little bit more time.
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Several years ago, I don't know quite
[1:41:17] how many, but brother Wayne was down
[1:41:19] there, brother Tim Puit's preaching on a
[1:41:22] Wednesday night. Was it was a Wednesday
[1:41:24] night, wasn't it? Wednesday night. Don't

[1:41:33] what he said. You go home and be
[1:41:35] faithful.

[1:41:39] Wednesday night.

[1:41:42] that midweek service ain't important.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; That that's not a a valuable service
[1:41:53] is on a Wednesday night.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; He's down there preaching. The spirit of
[1:41:56] God begin to move at the end of the
[1:41:58] service.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And there was a there was a a young
[1:42:02] sister come up. I believe that sister

[1:42:12] up in the prayer line praying for her
[1:42:14] brother.

[1:42:20] praying,

[1:43:25] uh uh just within a few years ago, out
[1:43:27] of her six brothers, there was only two
[1:43:29] of them serving God. My wife began to
[1:43:31] get desperate and she started praying.
[1:43:35] Amen. And she started praying and one of
[1:43:37] her brothers, Amen, that that been hurt.
[1:43:39] Amen. By, you know, we've all been
[1:43:41] there. We've been scarred. Pre we've
[1:43:43] been church hurt and preacher hurt and
[1:43:45] and we've seen all kind of stuff around
[1:43:46] the message that they listen that ain't
[1:43:49] got nothing to do with the message. Just
[1:43:51] man's ideas. And
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:43:56] and her brother had been hurt. Amen. He
[1:43:59] had got bitter and that boy hadn't
[1:44:02] stepped foot in a church in 20 years.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; 20 years. But my wife got desperate and
[1:44:08] begin to pray.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; And I've been in a series and I've been
[1:44:12] studying something. I've been preaching
[1:44:13] something and I preached through some
[1:44:14] verses of scripture and and the Lord,
[1:44:17] the spirit of the Lord just kept dealing
[1:44:18] with me, brother Ray. And he said, "Go
[1:44:20] back and preach that preach that verse
[1:44:22] again and come in a different angle."
[1:44:25] And God started dealing my heart
[1:44:26] preaching on the prodical son. And I
[1:44:28] went out of the office that morning and
[1:44:30] I looked and there said her brother on
[1:44:32] the left side of the church. Had been in
[1:44:34] church in 20 years. And I'm preaching on
[1:44:36] the prodical son
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:41] and he ain't missed the service hardly
[1:44:43] since.
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] She had another brother. He's a good
[1:44:49] boy. He's just a good good man. Good
[1:44:50] boy. You know, he he just uh you know,
[1:44:52] he never really done nothing wrong
[1:44:54] really, but he didn't have no desire to
[1:44:56] serve God. He didn't have no desire to
[1:44:57] go to church. He got married and had a
[1:45:00] couple kids. He didn't. But he was a
[1:45:02] good boy. He didn't really do nothing
[1:45:03] wrong. Amen. But I tell you what, being
[1:45:04] a good boy ain't good enough.
[1:45:10] And my wife, Amen, I think she got even
[1:45:13] more fervent in her prayer. When she
[1:45:14] seen that one boy or her that one
[1:45:17] brother come in, she just started
[1:45:18] praying harder.
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:22] And brother Ray, Amen. One day I got a
[1:45:24] text from him. He said, "I don't know
[1:45:26] what to do." He said, "But I got to be
[1:45:28] saved."
[1:45:30] He said, "I don't know how to do it. I
[1:45:32] don't know what to do." He said, "But
[1:45:34] I'm desperate." He said, "I can't live
[1:45:36] another day. I can't go another moment.
[1:45:40] I got to know Christ." And I let that I
[1:45:43] led him to Christ. Baptize him in the
[1:45:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he's
[1:45:48] been serving God ever since.
[1:45:52] Listen to me. Amen. Amen. If he did it
[1:45:54] for Amen. If he did it for Kimberly,
[1:45:57] Amen. We and he did it for my wife.
[1:45:59] Amen. He can do it for you, too.
[1:46:02] I'll turn that around a bit and say
[1:46:04] this. Some of you young people sitting

[1:47:23] service on a Sunday morning. He said,
[1:47:25] "You know my cousin." He said, "I got it
[1:47:28] on my heart to pray for him." And we
[1:47:31] couple of brothers in there and we just
[1:47:33] gathered around started praying. And
[1:47:35] friends, the spirit of God come down in
[1:47:37] that in that office and something so
[1:47:40] real just dropped down in that room. And
[1:47:42] just a couple days later, his cousin
[1:47:45] called him and they started talking
[1:47:47] about the Lord. He says, "Is there any
[1:47:50] way I can get on and start listening
[1:47:51] y'all services?"
[1:47:54] He gave him got him on the where he
[1:47:56] could listen to some services. Few
[1:47:58] couple Wednesday nights later, man. He
[1:48:01] showed up to church.

[1:48:10] people. Most of the church walked out.

[1:48:14] Spirit, I just kept singing a little
[1:48:16] bit, worshiping. Amen. There was about
[1:48:18] 15, 20 people stayed and lingered. Amen.
[1:48:20] While that was going on, I watched that
[1:48:22] young man stand up. Walk down to the
[1:48:24] altar and he stood there with his hands
[1:48:26] lifted up. He said, "Brother Josh, I

[1:48:42] going to happen.
[1:48:43] [Applause]
[1:48:45] While they were praying,
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:49] Hallelujah. What about in this camp?
[1:48:52] What about in this camp? Brother Nathan
[1:48:54] was telling me just the other day, he
[1:48:56] said, right before camp, the young
[1:48:58] people of True Word Tabernacle gathered
[1:49:00] up in a prayer meeting. He said, and
[1:49:02] while they were having prayer meeting,
[1:49:03] he said, "Brother, the spirit of God
[1:49:04] come in such a sweet way." Amen.
[1:49:06] Elizabeth is you can't have services
[1:49:08] like this except somebody's praying
[1:49:10] somewhere.
[1:49:13] You can't have a meeting like this
[1:49:15] except somebody is getting desperate
[1:49:17] before God and praying.
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:22] Hallelujah. I'm bringing it right down
[1:49:23] home now to you. Amen. How many of you
[1:49:26] are going to go home with this
[1:49:28] testimony? I went the true word and
[1:49:31] while I was praying,
[1:49:35] God filled me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:39] Hallelujah. I went to camp and while I
[1:49:43] was praying, God delivered me of
[1:49:46] anxiety.
[1:49:48] While I was praying, God broke the
[1:49:51] bondage of lust off of my life. While I
[1:49:55] was praying, I was healed.
[1:49:59] Hallelujah. What about it, brother
[1:50:00] Johnson? What about Zion? Amen. While I
[1:50:04] was praying, God healed my body. While I
[1:50:08] was praying, God delivered me.

[1:50:14] testimony?
[1:50:17] And listen, friends, if you ain't got
[1:50:18] that testimony yet, start praying now.
[1:50:22] [Applause]
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:32] David said it this way. I sought the
[1:50:34] Lord
[1:50:36] and he heard me
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; and delivered me from all my fears. They
[1:50:43] looked unto him and were light and their
[1:50:45] faces were not ashamed. This poor man
[1:50:48] cried and the Lord heard him
[1:50:52] and save him out of all his troubles.
[1:50:55] The angel of the Lord and kepteth round
[1:50:58] about them that fear him and deliverth
[1:51:02] them.
[1:51:03] Hallelujah. Listen friends, I ain't just
[1:51:05] a psalm in the Bible. That's your
[1:51:07] testimony.
[1:51:09] I sought the Lord and he heard me.
[1:51:12] Hallelujah. I cried and he delivered me.
[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:21] Hallelujah. As a musician's come this
[1:51:23] morning. Amen. Listen. Amen. I want you
[1:51:25] to catch this now. Amen. Because Amen.
[1:51:28] Daniel said, "And while I was speaking
[1:51:29] and praying and confessing my sin and
[1:51:31] the sin of my people and presenting my
[1:51:33] supplication before the Lord my God, or
[1:51:35] the holy mountain of my God. Yay. While
[1:51:37] I was speaking in prayer, even the man
[1:51:39] Gabriel come, Amen. who I had seen in
[1:51:42] the vision and began being caused to fly
[1:51:45] swiftly, touched me about the time of
[1:51:48] the evening oblation and informed me
[1:51:53] and talk with me
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; and said, "Oh Daniel, I am come to give
[1:51:58] forth to give thee."
[1:52:01] He come to give him skill and
[1:52:05] understanding.
[1:52:09] I was studying this the other day,
[1:52:10] Brother Jonathan, and I was sitting
[1:52:12] there and I was thinking, "Brother Ray,
[1:52:14] I'm sure you understand how this comes
[1:52:16] sometimes." I I I was I was praying and
[1:52:20] I was I was reading these verses and the
[1:52:23] Lord was dealing with my heart and said
[1:52:26] and something in me was just saying
[1:52:29] God sent the Holy Spirit to the church
[1:52:33] to do what Gabriel did
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; to Daniel.
[1:52:37] And I was thinking about that and I'm
[1:52:39] going to kind of tell myself how
[1:52:42] sometimes how little I know. But I was I
[1:52:45] was thinking about that and I thought,
[1:52:47] man, it would be really nice if Brother
[1:52:49] Brandham made that connection. And about
[1:52:52] five minutes later, I was reading a
[1:52:54] message, amen, about Gabriel's
[1:52:57] visitation to Daniel.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said this, the same
[1:53:01] way that that God sent Gabriel to
[1:53:03] Daniel, he sent the Holy Spirit to the
[1:53:06] church.
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:12] And I want to close I want to close this
[1:53:14] camp in telling you this. The Holy
[1:53:17] Spirit didn't come in these meetings
[1:53:18] just to give you a good feeling.
[1:53:21] Although we love it. How many loves to
[1:53:24] feel God? I ain't preaching against that
[1:53:26] at all. Hey, I love to feel God. And I
[1:53:28] thank God. Hey, it comes with emotion.
[1:53:30] But I tell you one thing. Amen. The Holy
[1:53:32] Spirit didn't come in these meetings
[1:53:34] just to give you emotion or just to give
[1:53:35] you a good feeling or give you a chill
[1:53:37] bump or give you some excite excitement.
[1:53:40] Amen. But the Holy Spirit come to give
[1:53:42] you skill and understanding. The Holy
[1:53:45] Spirit come to you this weekend. Amen.
[1:53:47] In the word to give you an
[1:53:49] understanding. You know what
[1:53:50] understanding is? The ability to
[1:53:52] comprehend. It's discernment. Amen. You
[1:53:54] It's giving you the ability to discern.
[1:53:57] And prophet of God said, "Amen. When we
[1:53:59] get the true revelation of who we are,
[1:54:01] amen, with the spirit. Amen. Oh, come
[1:54:03] on, friends. We can discern and
[1:54:06] withstand. You cannot withstand until
[1:54:09] you can discern. You got to have an
[1:54:11] understanding before you can withstand.
[1:54:14] And the Holy Spirit has come to give you
[1:54:17] understanding
[1:54:18] that you have discernment
[1:54:21] that you can withstand the antichrist
[1:54:23] spirit.
[1:54:26] But I love how the Bible connects two
[1:54:28] words there.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Skill
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; and understanding.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Because skill is the ability to do
[1:54:37] something
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; well.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; You can have understanding with no
[1:54:44] skill.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Be like a doctor. You know, he got all
[1:54:48] kind of understanding.
[1:54:49] They don't know how to put it into a
[1:54:51] practical use.
[1:54:53] Like an architect, he can draw anything,
[1:54:55] but he can't build nothing.
[1:54:57] You know what I'm tellers in here knows
[1:55:00] that's the truth. Oh, they can draw, but
[1:55:02] they can't they couldn't put together a
[1:55:05] bicycle.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; They got all kind of understanding, but
[1:55:10] no skill.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; But God didn't come in this camp just to
[1:55:13] make you a bunch of theological giants.
[1:55:17] So you can walk around and be all proud
[1:55:19] and oh I know about the seals and I know
[1:55:21] about this and I know Listen friends
[1:55:23] that ain't what the message come to do
[1:55:25] to make us a bunch of stuff shirt know
[1:55:26] it alls and amen walking around with a
[1:55:28] bunch of knowledge he come to give you

[2:45:05] [Music]
[2:45:07] Amen. Is your God awesome this morning?
[2:45:10] Amen. What a wonderful God.
[2:45:13] What a merciful, mighty, and awesome God
[2:45:17] this morning.
[2:45:19] I'll tell you what a wonderful weekend
[2:45:21] in the Lord. Amen.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're sitting here this morning
[2:45:24] and hearing this man of God preach. And
[2:45:27] you may say, "Lord, how long does it
[2:45:28] take for you to hear my prayer while I
[2:45:31] was praying? Was that an hour or was it
[2:45:35] an hour and a half? Was it 10 minutes?"
[2:45:38] You know, in the countdown, Brother
[2:45:40] Brandham was finishing his sermon in
[2:45:42] Bakersfield. He said, "Do you believe
[2:45:44] that little lady sitting there with the
[2:45:46] sunglasses on? You believe that?" He
[2:45:49] said, 'You had some deep thoughts right
[2:45:50] then and your eyes will be healed if
[2:45:52] you'll believe. Now, let me tell you,
[2:45:55] someone says she's got glasses on is the
[2:45:57] reason he knew it. He said, 'N no. Look
[2:46:00] here. See, just look at me just a
[2:46:03] moment. Do you believe me to be his
[2:46:05] prophet or his servant? Do you believe
[2:46:06] it? You should have with them thoughts
[2:46:09] you were having then thinking of how
[2:46:11] mysterious and what a great revelation
[2:46:13] that moon and representing. And he says,
[2:46:16] "Is that right?"
[2:46:18] Now, how could I know what she was even
[2:46:20] thinking in her heart? For the word of
[2:46:23] God is sharper than any two-edged sword,
[2:46:25] discerner of the thought and the intent
[2:46:27] of the heart.
[2:46:28] He said, "Now,"
[2:46:31] he's talking to her. He said, "Now pray
[2:46:34] for somebody
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; or do something." He said, "Here it is.
[2:46:39] Here's what popped in your heart right
[2:46:41] now. Here's what's in your heart. You
[2:46:43] got two brothers. you're praying for and
[2:46:46] they're both alcoholics. If that's
[2:46:48] right, raise up your hands. Brother
[2:46:50] Brandham hadn't even finished talking to
[2:46:52] her and she began to pray. He said,
[2:46:55] "Here's your prayer."
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz it don't take 2 hours for that
[2:46:58] prayer to get to heaven.
[2:47:02] He knows the moment you open your mouth
[2:47:07] and you even begin to pray.
[2:47:12] You come into a place like this and the
[2:47:14] atmosphere of God and the so much power
[2:47:16] and so much anointing that is coming
[2:47:18] here and I I certainly want to thank
[2:47:21] each of you that has come here today to
[2:47:24] bring yourself and come together with
[2:47:26] us. That's why we come together. Brother
[2:47:28] Bram said, "What is it?" He said, "When
[2:47:30] that little fire here and that little
[2:47:32] fire, each one of you is a part of God
[2:47:34] and when you come together, it's the
[2:47:37] body of Christ uniting.
[2:47:39] [Music]
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; And you bring your little liquifier from
[2:47:42] your church and your family and each one
[2:47:45] of you coming together is what builds up
[2:47:48] such a great manifestation of his spirit
[2:47:50] and his anointing." And and when it
[2:47:52] begins to happen, Brother Bam said, "You
[2:47:55] see what happens is," he said, "things
[2:47:57] begin to be get misunderstood when God
[2:47:59] begins to come like that." He said,
[2:48:01] "It's not really you they
[2:48:03] misunderstand." He said, "It's the Holy
[2:48:05] Spirit and how it makes you do things
[2:48:08] that they misunderstand."
[2:48:10] And when people begin to speak against
[2:48:11] it, they're not really speaking against
[2:48:13] you. They're speaking against what he is
[2:48:15] doing in you.
[2:48:17] And sometimes even even ministers
[2:48:20] misunderstand these things. They see
[2:48:22] people going through these prayer lines
[2:48:23] and being carried out the other end. Or
[2:48:26] they see these young people weeping
[2:48:28] their way and until they start uh uh
[2:48:31] uttering other tongues and they're
[2:48:32] rolling and snotting and having having
[2:48:35] just a real time in the presence of God.
[2:48:39] And even in the scripture it said there
[2:48:40] was a woman named Hannah that was down
[2:48:42] at the temple praying like that one day
[2:48:44] and the priest thought she was drunk.
[2:48:46] happened again in in the priest over
[2:48:49] there in Jerusalem in the upper room.
[2:48:52] 120 of them come down after being in the
[2:48:54] presence of that great light and they
[2:48:56] misunderstood what was happening. They
[2:48:58] thought they is all drunk and they begin
[2:49:01] to announce don't misunderstand what is
[2:49:02] happening. See because there was one
[2:49:05] among them with skill and understanding
[2:49:08] and he said this is that which the
[2:49:10] prophet Joel prophesied. It shall come
[2:49:13] to pass in the last days that I'll pour
[2:49:15] out my spirit upon all flesh. Amen. Some
[2:49:18] people say, "Well, I got a lot of
[2:49:19] understanding." But they don't
[2:49:20] understand the things they ought to
[2:49:22] understand. And skill and understanding
[2:49:24] would tell you that that great anointing
[2:49:26] that you have felt in this room is
[2:49:28] nothing less than the pillar of fire.
[2:49:31] It's the same pillar of fire that
[2:49:32] created the heavens and earth that met
[2:49:34] Moses and wrote the Bible, met Paul and
[2:49:37] wrote the New Testament, has come into
[2:49:39] this age to interpret the word in this
[2:49:41] age and bring this revelation to us. And
[2:49:44] he's been announced to be the anointing,
[2:49:46] the angel of the Lord, the resurrected
[2:49:49] Lord Jesus Christ. And it's a reality
[2:49:52] that he's here. And he's not just here,
[2:49:54] but he's right here in your hearts. And
[2:49:57] that's why when you get together like
[2:49:58] this, it's such a such a power and such
[2:50:01] a grace that comes in the room because
[2:50:03] that's him. You you got that picture of
[2:50:05] that Sam Houston Coliseum. You know,
[2:50:07] they took this picture uh in in in Sam
[2:50:10] Houston Coliseum in the 1950s with
[2:50:12] brother Brandham. And you all have seen
[2:50:15] it and you've seen the picture, you've
[2:50:16] looked on it many times, but you know
[2:50:19] that they took a picture just before
[2:50:21] these and and there's pictures after
[2:50:24] these. And you've seen many pictures of
[2:50:25] Brother Brandham, but what makes this
[2:50:28] one so special is it it's not really
[2:50:30] just Brother Brandham in the picture.
[2:50:33] &gt;&gt; It's that other one up above his head
[2:50:35] there
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; that we have recognized to be the
[2:50:39] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ visiting
[2:50:42] this generation in the form of the
[2:50:44] pillar of fire. And Paul saw that same
[2:50:47] thing in the book of Acts and he said,
[2:50:49] "Lord, who are you?" And he said, "I am
[2:50:52] Jesus."
[2:50:54] Now, you come here to this weekend and
[2:50:57] you've had great fellowship and you've
[2:50:58] heard great ministries.
[2:51:01] Brother Brandham's not been in any of
[2:51:02] these meetings.
[2:51:05] And when you go home, these ministers
[2:51:07] that's preached these powerful messages
[2:51:09] and the men of God that's prayed for you
[2:51:11] is not going to go home with you.
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; But see, there's two in that picture
[2:51:15] right there.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; One of them is not here today,
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; but that other one
[2:51:23] He said, "I'll never leave you
[2:51:26] and I'll never forsake you
[2:51:29] and I'll be with you, even in you, until
[2:51:33] the end of the age." And when you go
[2:51:35] home, you let him go home in you. You
[2:51:38] take him back to your churches. You take
[2:51:41] him back to your prayer meetings. You
[2:51:43] take that fire, amen, and let it burn so
[2:51:46] bright that others will want to be into
[2:51:48] the presence of that great angel. I
[2:51:51] certainly love you and I thank you all.
[2:51:52] We we there's no way that we could thank
[2:51:54] every person in the building, but we
[2:51:57] want to thank you all together and thank
[2:51:59] each minister, each pastor, all the
[2:52:01] churches and all the all the different
[2:52:04] ministries and the youth leaders and the
[2:52:06] and the I set out this morning having my
[2:52:09] coffee and some of the brothers came by
[2:52:11] and and they said, "Brother Wayne said,
[2:52:13] this has been the most amazing time."
[2:52:15] And he said, "Last night through that
[2:52:17] prayer line, one brother said,"I seen
[2:52:19] them carrying my daughter out." He said,
[2:52:22] "She got under the spirit and couldn't
[2:52:24] even walk no more." And he said, "I
[2:52:26] picked that." They picked her up
[2:52:27] carrying her out. And she he said
[2:52:29] something swept over me. He said, "I
[2:52:31] wanted to run all over the building."
[2:52:33] Amen. To see the power of God on this
[2:52:35] next generation moving them and blessing
[2:52:39] them. I tell you, we had we had our
[2:52:42] generation and we're and we're carrying
[2:52:43] on. Amen. But thank God that that spirit
[2:52:46] has never left the church.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; It's never left you, young people.
[2:52:52] And you just keep moving in his in his
[2:52:54] presence.
[2:52:56] Don't you let nobody tell you it was for
[2:52:58] another generation
[2:53:00] cuz it belongs to you. And we're so
[2:53:03] thankful this morning for it. And I I I
[2:53:05] I would echo the words of Josh Bennett.
[2:53:08] I am extremely proud of you, of what you
[2:53:11] do, of what you stand for, what you
[2:53:14] believe. We so thank you for each one of
[2:53:16] you visiting the camp and giving us the
[2:53:18] opportunity to be a blessing to you.
[2:53:20] Amen. And I I I do want to just bow our
[2:53:24] hearts this morning in a word of prayer.
[2:53:27] And you know, we've heard prayer changes
[2:53:30] things. We've heard it. And some of you
[2:53:34] maybe for time's sake you didn't want to
[2:53:35] come forward and you have that loved
[2:53:37] one. You have that need that you're in
[2:53:40] your heart and that situation. I tell
[2:53:42] you just in dismissal today won't you
[2:53:45] just reach over may put your hand on
[2:53:47] someone there because whether you know
[2:53:49] it or not your hand is powerful
[2:53:54] and the prayer you pray is powerful.
[2:53:57] So maybe just right now you just pray
[2:53:59] one for the other
[2:54:02] and ask God to answer that need that's
[2:54:04] in that life. Father, as we bow our
[2:54:07] hearts, as we bring this evening or this
[2:54:11] day to a close, Lord, and we bring these
[2:54:14] meetings to its end,
[2:54:16] Father, we are so thankful for the
[2:54:18] visitation that you have given us in
[2:54:20] this place.
[2:54:23] Oh God, how we're reminded
[2:54:25] that it was a mother's prayer
[2:54:28] that come knocking on my door and how I
[2:54:31] stand here today because somebody
[2:54:33] prayed.
[2:54:35] My mother got a hold of you and she
[2:54:37] wouldn't let go, Lord. And how you dealt
[2:54:40] with my heart, Lord. And I pray today,
[2:54:43] Lord, that Father, that every need
[2:54:45] that's been brought up before you in
[2:54:47] these meetings, Lord, may they be
[2:54:50] answered. May your grace be upon them.
[2:54:52] right now as we pray one for the other.
[2:54:54] I pray that Father as they lay their
[2:54:56] hands one on the other that Lord the
[2:54:59] revivals that have been asked for may
[2:55:01] they realize the answers Lord. I pray
[2:55:04] father Lord as you have moved among them
[2:55:07] I pray that you secure their experiences
[2:55:10] with the seal of your spirit. Lord may
[2:55:13] they go home with skill and
[2:55:14] understanding Father and Lord we thank
[2:55:17] you. We give you glory and honor. We
[2:55:20] thank you for Lord the prayers that have
[2:55:22] been prayed and answered. Now Lord we
[2:55:25] commit these great meetings in your hand
[2:55:27] and if there be any glory. We give it
[2:55:30] all to you father in the name of Jesus
[2:55:34] Christ our Lord. We thank you for it
[2:55:37] father. We thank you for it in Jesus
[2:55:40] name. Amen. There's a little song we
[2:55:43] used to sing years ago and I always
[2:55:46] really liked it because you know if uh
[2:55:49] if there is a next year and we're here,
[2:55:51] we're going to see one another. But
[2:55:53] maybe somebody that you see here today
[2:55:56] won't be here next year. But I'll tell
[2:55:58] you this, if I don't see you again until
[2:56:01] I see you over there,
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to do me a favor. When you
[2:56:06] enter that city, I want you to come look
[2:56:08] me up.
[2:56:10] I want you to come look me up and say,
[2:56:11] "Brother Wayne, you remember that camp
[2:56:14] meeting down there that night?
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; How the Lord came and and how the Lord
[2:56:19] had spoke to me in this need and you
[2:56:21] just Amen. I I I love that little song.
[2:56:24] Won't you look for me?" Can we sing
[2:56:25] that, brother Ben? Amen. I don't know
[2:56:28] what key song. Look for me
[2:56:35] cuz I
[2:56:37] will be there too.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I realize

[2:57:20] hand today and tell for me when you get
[2:57:23] there? I love you in the Lord. May God
[2:57:26] richly bless you as you dismiss this
[2:57:28] morning. Look for me
