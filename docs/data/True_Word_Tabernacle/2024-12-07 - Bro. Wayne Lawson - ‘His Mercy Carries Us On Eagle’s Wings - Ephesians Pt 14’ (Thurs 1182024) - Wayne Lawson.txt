to get closer to the Lord do you know brother Bram said a real secret to being good Christian is read your Bible and pray every day yes sir amen you'll be sure to get closer to the Lord by doing it amen and it's certainly a great honor to be here tonight on the Thursday evening and amen we um we know the roads are planning to get bad a little bit later tonight but we've had the grace to get together here and earlier and amen it's certainly on our heart and amen we um got a few things here that uh if it's okay with you we're just going to continue in this eisan series amen and uh I know I know there's more books in here than the book of Ephesians but this is exactly where the church is today is the book of Ephesians amen it's just a special anointing seems that has moved in on it and amen and uh it's been such a rich blessing and amen I my goodness did y'all appreciate that anointing on the end of the service there Sunday wasn't that so powerful Amen brother Ericson had everyone join him and praying people on the on the streaming out there said the power of God was just dropping in their homes and amen the anointing was happening and amen I thank the Lord amen I thank God he's not bound to this room amen but he can go out there in in the homes and in the lives and he can touch every need and every every heart amen it just feels really good in here tonight amen God bless you and amen it's a great honor amen and just before we read the word maybe we just address the author of it amen let's just speak to him this morning this evening father it is a great privilege to be with your children Lord and Lord we've had the honor to stand in your presence so many times and father your Prophet told us of a young man that wanted to see the ocean and there was an old salt setting there that had lived his whole life that couldn't see the big F but Lord that young heart that had never seen it was so real to him and I pray father that you always allow us no matter how many times we see you no matter how many times we're in your presence Lord help it to stay fresh to us help us to never Lord never to take for granted you're coming by and speaking to the needs and picking up your word and dealing with hearts for father we could open this book surely but there's no man that can open this Revelation but you and we ask that you would come tonight and pick your word up Lord and flip back the pages but Lord open up the corridors of our souls that we might see deep into your word father and we ask you for your mercy in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you tonight and I want to turn to the book of Ephesians the second chapter and I want to look here in the fourth verse of the book of Ephesians uh 2 chapter verse 4 amen uh just I'm just going to read this one verse I've read this section on Sunday but I want to specifically speak of this one verse tonight but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he hath loved us isn't that amazing God who is rich in Mercy sir he's rich in Mercy for his love so his love has manifested his mercy and he's giving Mercy to satisfy his love for us isn't that amazing because he has love his Mercy satisfies his love amen but God who is rich in mercy God bless you as you could be seated tonight I want to speak to you tonight if I can uh if I would take a context in this uh in this it's fision series but I'm going to take a specific title to this amen and he carries them on Eagle wings and he carries them On Eagle's Wings and I I think tonight if we're looking into this word um I've looked and studied the the the the the word mercy many times and we've took it through the scriptures and we've looked at he mercy endureth forever and he reduth his Mercy every morning and we've looked at the differences of mercy and Grace and and but I uh I don't know that I've ever specifically just settled down in the book God rich in Mercy and just spoke some declaring some things from there and I would like to do that tonight I'm going to be drawing some points directly from there and uh and I think it's a powerful time that we live and it's amazing how that it it's so in the scripture and what God has done uh I I think as we spoke a little bit Sunday here and and we saw that brother Bram says you know uh that that you were who once dead in sins and trespasses has God quickened or made alive and brother B starts begins that uh series of God rich and his Mercy he begins that tape with saying he said we were once dead in sins and trespasses but we're not tonight he says he said so what made that change amen it was God rich in his Mercy amen and then brother brandom tells us he wants to put a little Doctrine in there and uh and I wondered immediately what kind of Doctrine it was brother Brandon would teach that he'd have to excuse himself in the Pentecostal churches for teaching but he had that idea amen that a Believer was a thought to begin with as a part of the genuine attribute of God making them Eternal as the God in heaven is eternal and he knew that some of the people he was speaking to really didn't believe that but I I love how brother brandom says things because he was speaking to the believer he he was specifically speaking to the believer and when you listen to this God rich in Mercy he's addressing this whole book to a Believer or to the Believers of the age in the book of Ephesians Paul is addressing the book of Ephesians to the Saints or to the Believers of that age and brother bam is trying to spell out to the people he's trying to tell them that you were once dead but you're alive tonight because God who was rich in Mercy showed you Mercy amen when really we would have been out in the world and then he spells out his his thought he just gives us his thought and he uses two different uh stories to really expel the thought and he takes the duck who was in the chicken yard and he says oh he was he was really an ugly duckling but and when he smelt the water he said there he went right to that water nobody had to teach him anything nobody had to do only thing you had to do is get out of his way because he was a duck to begin with and then brother Brandon begins on to say he said this the same thing with the eagle the little fell was born down the chicken yard and then one day the mother Eagle come flying over screaming and she didn't have to make that baby an eagle she only had to make a noise amen that was different than the chicken now you sometimes people wonder why is it that we preach so much about the message and we quote brother brandom and things it's because if you're going to call Eagles you have to sound like an eagle to call Eagles now you'll never evangelize the world watering down this message to a Baptist message or to some denominational message but if we're going to catch Eagles we've got to preach the message of the hour and it will do exactly what it's supposed to do it'll call Eagles to itself amen I know sometimes people say well maybe you ought to water that down some but see this is too late in the season I believe amen that real eagles are going to catch the word of God Amen it's the season and if God's anointed you for it just go on and preach it and leave the rest of it up to God Amen I don't know about y'all but don't make my decision for me amen if it comes to Holiness don't water it down preach the gospel let me make my own choice amen amen I want to hear the word of God I want to hear it true and then let me decide how I'm going to believe or how I'm not you know amen I I think it's amazing years ago I was preaching a little meeting down in in Georgia and uh it was a powerful little meeting and there was just groups of people coming and it was a little bit of everybody was gathering into these little meetings and they wasn't probably over about 40 50 people but they was just hot you know and and I was preaching one night preaching Right Along on that eagle coming out of the chicken yard and there was a young man sitting back there he he was a baptist boy he was sitting back there and all of a sudden he just jumps up in the middle church and start speaking in unknown tongues and I'm preaching right away and he's preaching he's speaking back in tongues well and somebody said well was he out of order well let me say this to you nobody had taught him Church order CU he didn't even know nothing about speaking in tongues so it just struck him and he just jumped up and started rejoicing and he told me later he said I never done anything like that in my life Heen but what he told me later he said what happened was he said you you when you said something he said that anointing that was on you struck me and he said I knew it was the Holy Ghost and he said Lord I'll accept that Holy Ghost and when he received the Holy Ghost he done it right in the middle of preaching amen you know and I pray that we don't get so in order that somebody can't get saved while we're preaching anymore I I pray we get out of order enough amen that somebody can get the Holy Ghost while we're preaching the gospel that the spirit of God can just move into the hearts and lives amen and we can just preach the gospel I don't know about y'all but amen I say just preach the word and let the word of God come and move in the heart of the children of God and make it up and so brother bam is telling us see it was God rich in Mercy that done that cuz really amen we should all be dead in Traditions and we should be caught up in Creeds and how many of us were but we're not tonight now why aren't we there tonight because God who is a rich in Mercy amen decided that you would not stay there but God would call you out now brother br makes it clear he said now the reason this happens was is because God before the foundation of the world put your names on the Lamb's Book of Life and he said God didn't send Jesus to die and then come to find out somebody would hear the story feel sorry and come to the Lord he said but he was slain for those which were chosen before the foundation of this world even began God who was rich in Mercy sent Jesus to be slain for us because we desire desire to be saved and we desire to be healed is that right amen so because you desired brother B said then that's why God sent something because there was something in you Desiring to be saved something Desiring to be healed amen that's the reason he said something I I certainly believe tonight amen that brother bradam is teaching us amen that God was leading his children now in God rich and mercy he says something that's very powerful F he said now we find that God was so merciful to Moses out there in the Dead Sea Red Sea he says that when he said there in Exodus 19 and4 he said I carried you on Eagle wings and brought you under myself now carried them On Eagle's Wings and brought you to myself there was other men in the middle of that sea out there that were trying to impersonate that he said but he carried them on eagles wings now God always Likens His prophets to Eagles and what was it Moses was a messenger and they were following Moses and they was the Eagle wings that they were carried on because he was packing God's message and people that followed that they that were following God as they followed Moses with his message of Deliverance now the Bible said that they perish not with them who believe not because God was rich in Mercy because they were following his Commandments or his word or his providing way amen because they was ready to follow God's way God was rich in Mercy and they were not perishing with the unbeliever now I think it's powerful if you want to pull it up Exodus 19 and verse 4 this is where brother Adam's getting this Amen in in Exodus 19 and4 he said ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now look at this this is what he said says and you have seen what I done under these Egyptians amen I I wonder tonight have you seen what God done to these Egyptians when we start talking about the mercy of God listen amen those Egyptians were in the same sea the Israelites were in but tonight amen we know that the Egyptians died in the sea and the Israelites lived amen why because God was rich in Mercy towards those who were following the message of the hour amen they they come through the same thing one lived and one died amen because God was rich in Mercy they were following the message of the hour amen I think it's powerful when you see it now watch here amen let's turn to Exodus 14 and: 13 are do you have the ability to EQ this if you do just turn a little bit of the highs down and low give me bump me a little bit low Amen in Exodus 14 and13 and Moses said unto the people now this is we're going to take a look have you saw what I did unto these Egyptians and Moses said unto the people fear not and stand still for the sou for ye shall see look at that for you shall see the salvation of the have you seen what the Lord did stand still and you shall see the salvation of the Lord which you show to you today for the Egyptians whom you seen today you shall see them again no more more forever it's a long time and the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses now why criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward thank you that they go forward amen now watch this the Lord said why criest thou unto me Moses speak the words of these people go forward brother bam said he said watch he said stand still and see the salvation of God he said the people would have had Moses running up and down the Bank full of emotion trying to figure out how to get over it but God said just stand still and see the salvation of God wait on inspiration wait on God to to move something out of the way look what he says he said for the Lord shall fight for you and you hold your peace wherefore CRI thou unto me speak un the children of Israel that they go forward now lift up thy rod and stretch thine hand over this sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of this sea how many knows what that Rod represented the rod in the hand of Moses represented the name of Jesus Christ in the Church of the Living God and brother B said had Pharaoh ever got that Rod out of the hand of Moses he could have defeated the children of Israel but as long as Moses held on to that Rod as long as the church holds on to the name of Jesus Christ you're never going to defeat a people that has the name of Jesus Christ as their testimony in their hands see while Christ amen behold I will harden the hearts of these Egyptians and they'll follow them and I will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all the host upon the Chariots upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten honor upon Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the angel of God somebody say the angel of Godel of God the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between you got that you got that picture of the pillar of fire over brother bram's head and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by the night to these so that one came not near the other all the night long amen now watch what's happening the one one that was leading the children of Israel that great pillar of light that met them down there that had led them out of the camp of of Egypt it had led them up to this place amen it's now moved out from behind in front of them and has moved behind them now what was behind them was Egyptian Army so what God did now watch this God who is rich in Mercy the same one who was leading the church has now got himself in between the people of God and the thing that is trying to destroy them now I don't know amen if you've studied the mar The Mercy Seat very much but if you study The Mercy Seat you'll find out this that in the Ark of the Covenant later when Moses builds it and they build an ark of the covenant in the Holy Place how many knows what the mercy seat was there The Mercy Seat was they see they built a box you've seen the Ark of the Covenant they built a box and the wood when in and the uh the Commandment of the Lord went in there and I think it was later David's uh uh Goliath sword and some other things were stacked in there but it was where the word was now any man standing in the presence of that word would automatically die but what God did was he had Moses put a lid on it and that lid was a shittam wood covered amen with a golden uh layer and brother man said the wood represented the humanity he said but between the humanity and the blood he said he placed that deity showing it would be deity that stands between man and judgment he applied the blood to the gold showing deity itself would die to make a protection from the believer between the judgments of God see The Mercy Seat allows you to stand in the presence of God without dying something that's covering you something that's making a propitiation for you and here the children of is Israel are with their their Taskmaster their sins all of their past is upon them and God says I'm going to get between you and whatever it is that was going to destroy you that thing that followed you your whole life that trouble that has been upon your family that has cursed you and has tried to destroy you he said I'll get between you and the and the Very enemy that you have now brother brandom definitely identifies this now I go for Redemption by power I think I read this to you some time ago it stands reading again listen we got to tighten up our harness now and this angel of God which went before the camp of Israel is still here amen and the angel of God that went before the camp of Israel he says removed and went back behind them and that pillar of cloud went before the face and stood behind them he said a go between in the time of trouble when trouble begins to face you s sickness on every hand the angel of God comes up and goes out between you and the sickness and stands there in the way challenging you to take God's word God had give Israel the promise that they would go into that Land There was a million probably coming to pursue them and run them down and chop them down like a bunch of animals but the angel of the Lord who was there to carry them to the promised land rose up from the camp and went and stood behind them and the danger Hallelujah he still does it he will make a way oh I just love him don't you he'll make a way for every sick person sitting here right now he has already made the way and he is standing between you and the trouble oh I tell you trouble's on your Trail but I'm here to tell you that there is a light amen that is leading the church that the prophet of God said it has stood itself between you and the trouble that's going to destroy you I know every person sitting in this building had the enemy saying I'm going to destroy you I'm going to get you here or I'm going to get you here or I'm going to get you here but I'm saying tonight that Satan does not have the power to destroy the Church of the Living God I know what he's threatened to do to you but but pharaoh and all of his army could not destroy the children of Israel and neither with ever destroy you because the angel of God has sent himself between you and the enemy that would destroy you if the angel wasn't there you're right you would be destroyed overnight but God rich in Mercy no we don't deserve it but God rich in Mercy the angel of God is in this building tonight so that the enemy cannot destroy you hallelujah amen I tell you what brother R said I know he's here right now I know he's here right now and you can call me a fanatic if you want to I love how he says it I'm not responsible for what you say I'm responsible for what I say before God but he who led the children of Israel brother shouting ground right here he who led the children of Israel Hallelujah we are not alone tonight we are not a Fus people tonight we're not just a headless people dwindling out in the darkness trying to find our way but he that led the children of Israel is Right among the church tonight he's not only our leader he is our protector he is our sealed and our sword amen he's a strong and mighty tower I'm talking about the one brother bam says it very clearly I'm responsible for what I say and if I've judged it right on that light you see tonight or that you've seen in the picture yes sir that same angel of God is in this building right now to do exactly what Jesus did in that day he's here to confirm he said and now and he will always be the same and that angel of God is moving up to stand between you and your sickness oh I tell you tonight amen I know brother Ron Spencer gets these sermons and I pray tonight he's listening Amen brother Ron I'll say this the angel of God is between you and the sickness it's God who is rich in Mercy amen listen if the devil was going to get brother Ron he's had a long time to shoot at him but the devil will never get him until God says his purpose is finished until that time the devil can shoot all the darts he want to shoot he can hit as hard as he wants to hit I'm preaching to you tonight Satan is still a punch at you many times in your life but you're still standing oh you might have got knocked down but brother you got right back up he might have counted on you going down and he got to eight count but you got up and shook it off and said I'm here tonight because God rich in his Mercy has caused me to stand when times it don't seem like you can stand at all but God who is rich in Mercy the angel of God now friends this is this is not a Disney movie this is not fanaticism this is not some hype this is reality the angel of God that's in this picture is in this building tonight and he's standing between you and your trouble you said brother Wayne what makes the difference between somebody in trouble and somebody who this Angel it's whether you believe it or not however you judge that angel is how your life is going to go if you judge this as some as some some some idea or some fanaticism or some Pentecostal emotions oh you're going to judge it that way but you're going to receive the reward of that but to you who believe that this is the Angel of the Lord this is Jesus Christ in the baptism of the spirit to get in the church and deliver it you'll receive the reward of that in your life the man said judge it however you want to judge it but you'll receive the reward of your judgment in Exodus chapter 14 watch continue in the 21st verse and with the Lord standing there at their back brother Bram says watch to the Egyptians things got darker to the believer things got brighter the dark days turned into brightness when Moses be to part the waters things got brighter they begin to see a way out they begin to understand things can get better it looked like there was no way but God God made a way now listen friends you you've heard me preach and you've heard our brother Ericson preach it for years it does not change the fact to remember that God makes a way where there is no way listen when you come up to something and you can't get around it and you can't get under it and you can't get over it there is a God here that says when there is no way he's a God that makes a way and with every Temptation there is a way I've escaped do you know what brother Ram said the reason these men come to this place in the Red Sea he said they came to this place to prove to the believer that God will make a way where there is no way well whatever you're facing tonight is not a Red Sea I'll tell you that whatever you're looking at tonight is not trying to part a red sea but the same God that parted the Red Sea is the same God that can step into the situations of your life and change it because let me say without without hindrance without hesitation he is a god of mercy and because of his Mercy he has given us a richness tonight to stand here in a way where Moses could hand his just put his hand over the sea hallu and God caused a strong East Wind well we ain't got time to preach on all of it but you know that does sound something fierce don't it that gospel coming from the East under the west and here comes the Winds of the son of man isn't it something sunset and sunrise just after here comes that great wind Here Comes The Winds of the Gospel friends here comes the Winds of God it's what happened on the upper room it was a great wind amen the scripture says it was a great wind do you know something about a brush fire how many's ever been in a big brush fire you ever seen a great big brush fire you know what it does it generates its own wind amen it burns unwi but in a little bit it'll generate its own wind and I I've seen it I've seen it in meetings I've seen the the Holy Ghost settled down in the church and the power of God begin to burn and the next thing you know all you got to do is stand back from the platform and it starts generating its own anointing on the inside listen we're not serving a different God this is the same Jehovah god with a same power the same anointing these Egyptians you see what they did is they seen this Great Wall of water that was created by this wind of God and these Egyptians amen they decided to pursue them boys were not very smart but they figured that if a Believer went they could [Music] go brother Ram called it one place presumed they presumed that if you could do it they could do it oh my and brother Bram said you can't impersonate this you can't make a mockery of it amen watch what was it they said that came to in the morning he says look he says uh Egyptians pursued and went over after them in the midst of the sea and even all Pharaoh's horses and his chariots and his Horsemen see it was a setup folks it was a setup God set the devil up he would have never struck the way he struck if he didn't think he had the upper hand but because of where they were and what the situation was he thought for sure we we can put all the hell on him and we'll get him but God opened up a way and here they go in the middle of this sea and God the Bible said in the 25th verse this we we ought to write a song I think Moses already did but somebody write a new one on this one and he took off the chariot wheels God knocked the wheels off their wagons isn't it amazing here's the devil with all of his advantages and God just knocks the wheels off the wagons amen I tell you what amen every devil that's ever set upon you watch God knock the wheels off his wagon God just knocked the wheels right off and the Bible said and they drave them Heavenly or heavy so that the Egyptians said let us flee from the face of Israel let's get out of here guys this is not going well the Lord fighted for them and it do you know the Bible said I will be an adversary to your adversary do you know that this Bible says that God would be an enemy to your enemies do you recognize this tonight then that enemy of your life is not just your enemy that's God's enemy the enemy of your marriage is not just your enemy that's God's marriage amen that's God's enemy and God has taken your you said well brother Wayne this great enemy that's not just your enemy that's God's enemy this ain't just about you and the devil there's a God who is rich in Mercy oh thank you Jesus and he took the Chariot with Wheels that's just too good ain't it he just knock the wheels off their wagons I wonder if that's where they got that old scene uh uh I'll fix your wagon you know it don't you I I grew up with that term well he'll fix his wagon well God fixed the wagon he took the wheel off The Chariot amen so as that they decided we need to get out of here here amen but watch this but the Lord said unto now I'm still in Exodus 19:4 right have you not seen what I did under the Egyptians look what he did he stretched out thine hand over the sea that the waters May Come Again upon these Egyptians under the Chariots and upon their Horsemen God said to Moses take that name I've give you and hold it up now and cause the waters to implode upon this Army amen and mo Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to its strength and when the morning appeared the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and the waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them and there remain not so much as one of them what was the prophecy again the these Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever and here he says there wasn't one of them got out of the water not even one of them escaped on the other side the Bible said but the children of Israel walked upon the dry land of the midst of the Sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right and on their left and the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore I tell you the only way they ever saw them again was they saw dead ones I love how brother randam says it and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore and watch the 31st verse and Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done upon the Egyptians now in Exodus 19 Moses is saying to the children of Israel did you not see what God done to these Egyptians did you not pay attention to what God done to these Egyptians what did they do God so destroyed them that he saw them floating in the sea I I I I personally I've always loved this portion of scripture I've always thought about the Believers looking back in the ocean or the sea and and swirling up on the beaches come the problems of their past amen but dead have you ever have you ever had it you you know what I'm talking about you ever had that thing that you just you had to fight to keep it out of your spirit or that little trouble that seems to just haunt you and then later you come face to face with the same situation but it's just dead thankes have you ever seen it when it just becomes powerless like it just dies you know what that little thing that bother all of a sudden it's just dead and it's there it's the same as it always is but it just don't have any more power because God killed the thing amen because God is rich in Mercy he kills the thing so as that the believer can go free brother Bram said Israel had overcome those Egyptians passing through that by grace through that Red Sea and drowned those Egyptians he said which was a type of passing through the blood of the Lord Jesus and the Tas maskers that once drove you to the sins of this world are dead behind you I don't know amen of probably a better part of the message of the hour in my life amen is to understand that that seed was a type of the blood of our Lord Jesus and the enemies which were so hounding you are actually dead they are dead they have no more movement they have no more power amen they drove you for years but they're dead now amen amen they're haunting people amen only in the memory because the death has come to the enemy that would hold you and brother random says of course amen he said no wonder oh Miriam had that heart spell she picked up that tambourine and begin to dance and jump on those Banks he said oh you know the Holy Spirit it just catches from one to others he said you know that Holy Spirit it just catches from one to others see it was an old Holy Ghost meeting that's what it was they just begin to realize that the thing were dead now now if you see a little dancing and shouting going on around here y'all don't think nothing about it what it is is people recognize things died amen and there's nothing more glorious in a life when you packing things and carrying things and it's heavy on you and all of the sudden it dies and when it dies it is dead and all you feel like shouting all a sudden you just feel like rejoicing when's the last time you just you just said you know what devil you shot but you missed and I want to thank the Lord tonight that I have Liberty to be in the house of God I want to thank the Lord tonight that I love everybody I don't hold no grudges no feelings amen it's it's a blessing now some of you come from hard things but you're not carrying it with you tonight because that old thing died and you seen it in the blood of the Lord Jesus and now you can shout you can Rejoice you can amen the word of God you can have Liberty because everything is dead in the blood of our Lord Jesus listen amen can you ask yourself tonight why is it that others were swallowed up in the same thing but you're alive tonight can I say it it was God who was rich in Mercy it wasn't the that you're better than somebody else it wasn't amen that you deserve more than somebody else but it's God who is rich in Mercy amen there's one reason that there are some who never make it and there are others that are standing on the bank tonight with Joy in their heart it is God rich in Mercy don't ever get hotti don't ever get high minded don't ever get on a high horse and say big me and little them or amen look how wonderful I am and how little they are you just say oh thank God tonight that me a sinner was saved by grace and I'm not just saved I'm free I'm not just saved I've got the Holy Ghost I'm not just saved I can believe the message of the hour I've got a right to Liberty because God is rich in Mercy that's why it is the way it is God rich in Mercy now watch the prophet he said they bore them On Eagle's Wings in other words he carried them through the sea because they were following the message he said see now watch him say it here in paragraph 78 Moses knowed that he was to carry those children over into that promised land now can I do something here for you brother random knowed that he was to carry those children over into that Promised Land because the promise was given to him and he must pack them into that promised land and today the holy spirit is here to vindicate God's word and that's the eagle Wing that we're supposed to ride on not some man-made theology but were to ride on the wings of the eagle to the promised land right he Bears them or carries them on the wings of Eagle what's he talking about the prophet is talking about prophetic word he's talking about the message of the hour when God fulfills his word it lifts the church up and packs them out of denominational Creeds it lifts the church up and it packs them out of their unbelief and their ungodliness see if it wasn't for the mercy of God you'd be an Old Crow on the ground tonight if it wasn't for the mercy of God you'd be some Hawk sitting on a telephone wi somewhere but God rich in Mercy fulfilled these Seven Seals and unveiled a word in this age had caused you to rise up with Eagle wings to a a land Beyond denomination now now look what and now look what brother bam is doing here let's let's just examine here in uh God rich and mercy paragraph 108 but God rich in his Mercy sent back the Holy Spirit Upon Us vindicating his word tonight as he promised he would do God promised he would do these things and look what he did amen amen look what he did now how now we can see what he promised in each age a certain thing would happen we found out that it happened exactly like it that's what he said he would do because he is rich in his Mercy he always has Mercy to fulfill every word that he has promised watch in Exodus 19 and verse 4 reread that again and watch the scriptures lay together with what brother randam is saying it's it's a very beautiful it's a very beautiful thing here let me get back to it uh we can pull it back up there it is Exodus 19 and4 look at what it says ye have seen what I have done unto these Egyptians amen you have seen what I have done unto these Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself look here's here's brother brandom paragraph 109 look what he did how we can now see it here's a prophet just like Moses he's examining God rich and mercy and he's saying look look at what God did and and now how we can see it Moses standing back in the scripture was telling the children of Israel did you not see what God done to these Egyptians and how he took you up On Eagle's Wings and brought you to himself now here's the prophet saying God by Vindicated word is supposed to lift a bride up by Eagle wings and bear them unto himself now look what he did amen look what he did look what he did I I think it's powerful myself brother Bon preaches an entire sermon I have heard but now I see I have heard but now I see see it's like Moses Moses had heard of him being a great Jehovah but when he could see him he was in the form of a pillar of fire I have heard of thee but now I see thee what was it he seen his word Vindicated amen look at him what he has done what did Moses see his word Vindicated amen look at it paragraph 116 that burning bush gave V Vindication with what prophet Abraham had said Moses said I've heard of it but now I see it amen I think it's powerful and in paragraph 118 brother B said this and the church has heard of God they've read about him and what he did and the promises he made but now we see him with our eyes the same as job did I have heard of thee but now I see thee what a difference I have heard God was rich in Mercy but now I see God is rich in Mercy see I heard God was a deliverer but tonight look and see what God has done look at how he brought you out look at this we we talk about the message of the hour we talk about all the Chang es and Luther and Wesley and all the ministry of brother Ram we look at all of that but stand back and look a little a little bit in a different realm and realize that it was God rich in Mercy so you wouldn't be stuck in a denominational trap tonight had God never caused brother brandham to preach things contrary to the Pentecostals like that little Doctrine you'd be setting in a Pentecostal church tonight amen if God had to cause brother randam to dis agree with them on communion and on serpent seed and on marriage and divorce where would we be tonight we would be in the same trap they're setting in tonight but God rich in Mercy carried you on Eagle wings out of the denominational systems and bore you unto himself he has brought you to his own self amen that's why we find tonight knowing amen that if we're going to find the word of God Amen brother Adam says it very clearly that Jesus was an attribute he said so is every believer that comes to God an attribute of God manifested for the word of that day now see we're living in the age when the shuck has pulled away from it and where wheat is beginning to be seen yeah this is not a Pentecostal age this is a Latter Day age this is a bright age this is the evening light this is Malachi 4 this is to follow God's pattern of St Luke 17:30 he says see it's Jeremiah and all of the rest of them that Joe spoke of in the last day I have heard Lord it was coming but now I see it with my eye I heard that was going to be a perfect bride but I'm not hearing it tonight I'm seeing it with my eye because God is rich in Mercy that's why we could see what God done unto the Egyptians and how he bore you out to nomination on eagles wings and carried you into the revelation of himself somebody packed you to it you would have never found the Revelation you would have never come to it you would have never studied your way in amen I I don't mean to be arrogant one time I heard a preacher preaching and me and him had a discussion or two I'll have to be admit but he said to me he said brother he said look he said if I didn't ever come to the message he said i' didn't preach these things anyhow cuz they in the Bible and I just laughed at the guy I me I don't know of one thing I had right before I come to the message I don't know of one Doctrine or one understanding that I had correct but God rich in Mercy packed me out of my own unbelief and my own denominational mind and pack me into the word of God in this age unless God lifts you up you will be stuck in the Rut of denomination even if it's the denomination of one person even if it's in your own understanding it don't take a whole church or a whole group of guys to have denomination when you've decided what it is and that's it and period and nobody can teach you and nobody can help you because you're so arrogant in your own mind you have become a denomination of one but God rich in his Mercy can break that thing tonight and pack You On Eagle's Wings and bear you into the presence of God I say God is Rich and mercy mer I say he's a rich God in Mercy look what he done brother man said look what he done now isn't it amazing God rich in Mercy that he actually turns the service right there he said look what he done and automatically he brings up Hatty W Waldrop and he said she had cancer of the heart I thought it was amazing I studying that today and he said this woman was dying in my prayer line she was a nurse over in in Louis Lex Louisville and come into the prayer line said she was supposed to be a dead woman he said matter of fact they have her on the Scrolls amen as dead tonight over in the hospitals he said but God was rich in Mercy and come to that woman listen she had heart cancer folks amen and that's exactly what this Ley and age had it had cancer it had cancer the Heart It come on church that's exactly what was wrong with the heart this end time it was the heart of man it's not what was coming into them it was what's coming out of them him we and we were in trouble and a man's heart that's dark is blind and he can't help himself and it's veiled and he can't understand and he's dark in the world of unbelief but God rich in Mercy send a seventh angel to turn the light on and to Quicken the heart and heal it to set the church back in order and tonight here we say it with a healed heart I say Look What the Lord Has Done I I I I could break into this and y'all know I can Amen in this area because what a heart is the main functionary of a human being it's a sinner right split up in four cental amen coming in a going keeps the whole body alive cuz life is in the blood didn't he say it life is in the blood and the Heart of the Church of the Living God Amen life is in the blood take the Holy Ghost out and you got a dead church if you water the Holy Ghost down you got an anemic church amen and we don't want anemia we don't want diabetes we don't want a blood disease we want to eat the vitamins of the opening of The Seven Seals until the richness of the blood of the abrahamic Covenant [Applause] flows you know what I'm talking about brother BR said that he said that that that deity spirit bit him he said it bit me and he said but my blood was too rich he said so it couldn't affect me and it crawled right back in the mud puddle it went back in that group of people because it couldn't affect me and he says it he said and there's coming some vitamins in the opening of these Seven Seals that you can start eating on them vitamins listen the reason the deity spirit is still alive because they didn't eat that seven seal and if they had Feast on the unfailing body word they would find the vitamin in there that it's not brother random it's the angel of God that does these works so if it wasn't brother bradam it was the angel of God that then that same Angel is in this building tonight to perform the same thing you see it was it was a heart cancer that was look look what brother B said look what he did hady waldrip look what he done for Congressman up sh paralyzed that's not to me now it's not it's not always just a a a simple thing the reason brother B picks the people he picks the talk about but he talks about an important man but a paralyzed man now when when you're when you're reading about Congressman Upshaw almost every time brother brandham gets to Congressman Upshaw he stops and he says see what was happening in the meeting that night and he said I was I was sitting here and I started praying he said and and there was a a vision come up before me and he said there was a colored lady and he said I see a little girl on the doctor's uh uh uh surgery and he said I see a surgeon do something and he's operating on the voice of the child and the child is now paralyzed now if I get too spiritual y'all forgive me but I think the prophet told us things for a reason you let somebody operate on your voice you let them fool with your voice and it'll paralyze you yes that's you let them F now now brother Bram said it in in the message perfect Faith he said either your faith will paralyze the world or the world will paralyze your faith brother bam uh you know you know brother Wayne don't quote that part you know there's an area of the message I don't know if we really are to get into it because you know there's some Fanatics out there and some situations you know and things it'll paralyze you the devil knows what he's doing amen it'll paralyze and look brother Bram said that little girl went under the operation and she's paralyzed and the and the lady comes running up and says brother brandham will my daughter be healed and brother BR said I don't know Sister he said all I've seen is what was wrong with her yeah right and he said you know what that's the thing he said many people who come to the platform he said they only stayed long enough to find out what's wrong he said they don't stay long enough to find out another vision for the future he said the first thing that happened was the gift to tell her what was wrong he said but she got the pulling you paraphrasing now and in a little bit when she started pulling he said then the vision began to break and he said I seen a little girl crossing the street holding a baby doll y'all remember the story and he said I've seen her walking I said now now sister now she can walk isn't that something a minute before couldn't walk but now a vision has broke over a prophet God rich in Mercy she would have stayed in that condition but God rich in Mercy gave a vision to a prophet so as to fulfill the word of the Lord and the fulfill fing of the word gave life to the child isn't it powerful she she received her ability to walk and brother said right then when it broke open and I seen Congressman Upshaw that's when it broke right then and here's an important man paralyzed you know and then brother bradam begins to tell it what's he doing he's he's telling us God rich in Mercy look what he's done yeah look what he's done I know a matter of time look look look what he's done look what has happened in this age amen so brother Wayne I I I'm looking at Mercy Mercy's powerful for our own lives yes what God has done for our own being is powerful but God rich in Mercy look he sent this prophet and had nothing to do with us we didn't pray it down we didn't beg it down we didn't fast it down we didn't do anything but God but God yes sir rich in Mercy brother brother Earl your family was locked in the minites when all this was happening but God rich in Mercy see look what he's done for you it was God rich in Mercy brother you could have never believed it but God rich
