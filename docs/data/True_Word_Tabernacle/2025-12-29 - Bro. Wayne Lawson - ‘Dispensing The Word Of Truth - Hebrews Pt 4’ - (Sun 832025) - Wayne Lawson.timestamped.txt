[0:28] left in me. [music]

[0:34] All those [music] wasted
[0:37] hours [singing]
[0:39] and minutes in your head, they're yours
[0:43] now. [singing and music]
[0:45] From the start to the finish.

[1:42] [music]
[1:44] in me.

[1:49] All those wasted
[1:53] hours
[1:54] and [music and singing] minutes,
[1:57] they're yours now.
[2:00] From [music and singing] the start to
[2:02] the finish.
[2:04] I need more [music]
[2:08] of you.
[2:12] I [music and singing] need more.

[2:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[2:34] Amen. We start making room for him.
[2:37] Amen. Emptying out things and Amen.
[2:40] making the adjustments needed. I Amen.
[2:42] And I'm reminded of [music] the change
[2:45] of that great sermon up there on Mount
[2:47] Carmel. When after Elijah had saw the
[2:49] fire fall [music] and the people of God
[2:51] had seen the vindicated light of God
[2:53] come up on the mountain, they got to
[2:55] looking for the sign of that cloud in
[2:57] the heavens. And when they saw it,
[2:59] Elijah changed it. And he changed from
[3:02] go look for the cloud. He changed it to
[3:04] running down the city, get your barrels
[3:06] out.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Rains are coming.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I certainly believe there's
[3:10] been a a a change in the in the
[3:13] direction, [music] amen, of the message
[3:14] of the hour. We're no longer waiting for
[3:16] a message. Amen. But it's time to get
[3:18] your barrel out. Amen. And let the And
[3:21] as he would say, get ready. Amen. Get
[3:24] ready for the outpouring of his mercies
[3:26] and his grace. Amen. I I certainly love
[3:29] to hear the sound of that word when it
[3:32] comes forward to [music] tell us, Amen,
[3:34] preparations have been made. Amen. And
[3:36] it's time to open our vessels to receive
[3:39] of God. It's certainly good to be in the
[3:41] house of God on a Sunday morning, isn't
[3:42] it? Aren't you thankful? Amen. Get to be
[3:45] in the house of God on a Sunday morning.
[3:47] [applause]
[3:48] Amen.
[3:50] Thank the Lord for it.
[3:54] It's better than being in the best
[3:56] hospital there is in the nation. Amen.
[3:58] To be in the house of [music] God. Amen.
[4:00] I' I'd rather be right here today. Amen.
[4:03] And right here with all of our friends
[4:04] and loved ones. and we [music] thank God
[4:06] for it. And I just coming up the road
[4:08] and got to thinking on some of the good
[4:10] things of the Lord and I just about got
[4:12] a a thanksgiving spirit on me and I got
[4:15] to thinking about [music] the clothes I
[4:17] was wearing and
[4:19] riding up the road in that beautiful
[4:21] Cadillac.
[4:23] Amen. God supplied it, you know. And I
[4:25] was thinking about having this nice suit
[4:26] and one I got like brother Ray [music]
[4:29] and uh [laughter]
[4:32] I think about having that enjoying it
[4:36] and look over and got a beautiful wife
[4:39] sitting next to me. She's younger than I
[4:41] am, you know, and I I just I just almost
[4:44] let let it just let it go, you know,
[4:46] just thank you, Lord,
[4:48] &gt;&gt; and coming here and standing in front of
[4:50] this congregation, see all these
[4:51] wonderful faces and the smiles and the
[4:54] beauty and the hearts and the desire to
[4:56] serve God. And [music]
[4:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I I I don't know. Oh, I know
[5:00] the millennium is going to be good,
[5:02] &gt;&gt; but things are real good right now.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. With this faith in our heart and
[5:07] the love of the Lord and the spirit
[5:09] moving among us and [music]
[5:11] friends, I tell you, God has been so
[5:12] good. Ain't he been good?
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't he been good to you?
[5:17] [music and singing]
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Good to He's been so good to us and and
[5:20] to this assembly. And
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. that it it just it sometimes just
[5:24] [music] makes you want to tell somebody,
[5:26] Amen. God's been good
[5:30] [music] in my life.

[5:39] [music]
[5:45] I

[5:56] [music]
[5:57] it all.
[6:04] [music]
[6:07] [singing]
[6:09] [music]
[6:10] Heat. Heat.
[6:14] [music]
[6:15] [singing]
[6:19] [music]
[6:24] [music]
[6:29] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Sh.
[6:33] [music]
[6:34] [singing]
[6:38] [music]
[6:39] [singing]
[6:43] [music]
[6:44] Let's sing it to him one more time.
[6:48] [music]
[6:54] [singing] Thank you for it. [music] I
[6:57] want to thank you for your blessings.
[7:00] I want to thank you for the blessing of
[7:02] the spirit, Lord, that comes to loss. I
[7:05] want to thank you for the word of faith,
[7:07] [music] Lord, which you put in our
[7:08] hearts.
[7:11] Oh yes, Lord. I couldn't change it
[7:14] [music and singing] if I
[7:21] [music]
[7:27] [music]
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, he's been so good.
[7:30] Amen. Amen. As we uh come this [music]
[7:33] morning to the word of the Lord. Amen. I
[7:36] uh I'm just I'm just got something on my
[7:38] heart today. Uh, I'm I'm still in this
[7:40] book of Hebrews, but it's just been it's
[7:43] just been a real burden to me. Um, and
[7:45] and I I thought, well, I'm gonna step
[7:48] away from it for this morning, but uh
[7:50] yeah, it just wasn't able to do it. So,
[7:52] I I just want to speak a few things on
[7:55] it. And and just just before we read his
[7:57] [music] word, let's just speak to the
[7:58] author just for a moment. Father, we're
[8:01] so thankful today. Lord,
[8:04] there's just something in our heart that
[8:06] Lord, I am so thankful.
[8:09] I I don't know, Lord, what what I did
[8:12] [music] or said that gained your favor,
[8:15] Lord, that you would allow my heart to
[8:18] be [music] open to your great word. But
[8:20] I am so thankful, Lord. I'm so thankful
[8:23] for this morning for believers that
[8:26] would gather in this room that Lord that
[8:27] they would hear
[8:28] [music and clears throat]
[8:29] this word of life and Lord, it would be
[8:32] strength to them and they would [music]
[8:34] receive it with gladness. And Father, we
[8:37] ask you now as we would read your word,
[8:39] Lord, we know this word. It [music]
[8:41] contains the power of life, Lord, of
[8:44] deliverance, of healing, of mercy. And
[8:47] as we read your word and we speak upon
[8:49] it, we want to [music] invite you that
[8:52] you would come Lord and speak to the
[8:54] needs of your children this morning and
[8:56] you would walk the aisles of this
[8:57] building. We ask you for it now in Jesus
[9:00] name. Amen and amen. And God [music]
[9:04] bless you. If you have your Bibles today
[9:06] in the book of Hebrews, the first
[9:08] chapter, uh I want to [music] read uh
[9:11] chapter verses 1 uh to 3. Hebrews 1
[9:17] uh 1:3. Amen. Uh there's a [crying]
[9:21] there's such a depth uh in this and I
[9:24] know last Sunday you might have thought
[9:26] I was tying the whole Bible into the
[9:28] first book of Hebrews. Uh but it's
[9:31] there's such a depth in this uh that it
[9:34] uh that it's hard uh just to to maybe
[9:37] say it uh maybe in a in a a teaching
[9:40] way, but you know, sometimes you just
[9:42] say things right out and they are
[9:44] they're more a little more simple, but
[9:46] uh I want you to always know that
[9:48] they're backed up in the word of God.
[9:50] Hebrews chapter 1:es 1:3.
[9:53] Now God who in sunundred times and
[9:55] diverse manners spake in the times past
[9:59] unto the fathers by the prophets. So God
[10:01] did the speaking in various times in
[10:04] various ways by the prophets.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; But hath in these last days, can I just
[10:09] say this? The ultimate messenger.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; He hath in these last days spoken unto
[10:15] us by his son
[10:17] whom he appointed heir of all things.
[10:22] by whom also he made the worlds. Now the
[10:26] Bible says the Lord created the heavens
[10:28] and earth in six days. So then this son
[10:31] is also the Lord.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; He also made the worlds who being the
[10:37] brightness of his glory
[10:40] and the expressed image of his person
[10:44] and upholding all things.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody say it with me. All things.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; All things.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of things. [clears throat]
[10:51] Yeah.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Upholding all things by the word of his
[10:57] power when he had himself
[11:01] purged our sins and sat down on the
[11:04] right hand of the majesty on high. May
[11:07] God bless his word as you could be
[11:08] seated this morning.
[11:10] Uh, I want to take an uh maybe a
[11:13] subcontext here for this, but I want to
[11:16] talk to you about dispensing the word of
[11:20] his power. Dispensing the word of his
[11:23] power. As we have been speaking on this,
[11:26] there's been a a strong underlaying of
[11:29] dispensation. And you've been hearing me
[11:31] talk a lot about dispensation, but
[11:33] dispensation is truth. And if you want
[11:36] to know how to serve God and you desire
[11:38] to get something from God, you got to
[11:41] know the dispensation that you're living
[11:43] in. And that dispensation, amen, doesn't
[11:46] change God. It just changes your
[11:48] approach to God. Amen. Uh I I love the
[11:51] story. Brother Bam uses it so much. And
[11:54] he talks about the Sarapheneician woman
[11:56] in the Bible of a woman that was needing
[11:58] something from the Lord. And she
[12:00] approached the same Jesus Christ that
[12:02] blind Bardameus approached when he sat
[12:05] on the on the stone and in that
[12:07] beautiful story and said, "Thou son of
[12:09] David, have mercy on me." And and the
[12:11] Bible said, "And the man's blind eyes
[12:13] were healed because he cried for mercy
[12:16] from the son of David." And this woman
[12:19] tried the very same thing. And she and
[12:21] she spoke to him. But we find out
[12:23] because she was a gentile that he wasn't
[12:26] he wasn't even willing to accept her
[12:29] worship when the Bible said she
[12:30] worshiped. Amen. And he spoke not a word
[12:33] to her. And he basically he was ignoring
[12:36] her. Amen. Because she was not
[12:38] approaching him from the right direction
[12:41] from the from the from the right word.
[12:43] Amen. From from her dispensation of
[12:46] being a gentile. But then the Bible says
[12:48] this is what you do when the Lord ain't
[12:50] answering. Now, we all know what to do
[12:52] when he does, but what did it do when he
[12:54] don't? Amen. And the Bible said she
[12:56] worshiped the more.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; She didn't give up on the idea that
[13:00] power is right in front of me. God is
[13:02] standing right here in this man. So, she
[13:05] didn't just worship a little bit because
[13:07] she didn't get a response. She just
[13:08] stopped. The Bible says she worshiped
[13:10] the more and begin to say, "Lord, have
[13:13] mercy on me." And when she used that
[13:15] word Lord, she said the right thing
[13:17] right there because then Amen. then it
[13:20] got the Lord's attention and then he
[13:22] began to speak to her and she said,
[13:23] "Well, I got some need of healing." And
[13:25] he said, "Well," he said, "I didn't
[13:27] isn't healing the children's bread?" And
[13:30] Amen, but you're you're just a dog. In
[13:32] other words, the and and then of course
[13:34] she could have got angry. You know, she
[13:36] could have got angry and said, "Well, if
[13:37] you're not going to help me and you're
[13:39] going to talk to me that way, I'm just
[13:40] going to go now." Amen. But she didn't
[13:42] do that at all. She knew she was in the
[13:44] presence of the one that could change
[13:46] things and help. So then she looked upon
[13:48] him and said, "That's nothing, of
[13:50] course, but the truth." She began an
[13:52] agreement with the word of God in the
[13:55] right age. And what did it do? It
[13:57] released healing unto her. And brother
[13:59] Ram said it very clearly. He said she's
[14:00] the first first miracle among the
[14:03] Gentiles. Amen. And she received it
[14:05] right there by agreeing with the word of
[14:08] God. Amen. Do you see? Had Jesus never
[14:11] spoke to her, there would have never
[14:12] been a place for her agreement. But
[14:14] because he spoke to her because she took
[14:17] the right attitude and she said the
[14:19] right thing. He spoke to her and she
[14:22] agreed with the word. And when she
[14:23] agreed with the word, she got her
[14:25] healing. Amen. Amen. That's exactly
[14:28] where brother takes it. When he talks
[14:29] about Hadtie Wright, amen. When Hadtie
[14:32] Wright receives, Amen. the salvation of
[14:34] her children, Brother Bam said, "What is
[14:36] it that you would have had?" Amen. And
[14:38] she said the right thing. You remember
[14:40] she had said amen to the power of God
[14:42] falling on brother Bam's life. You he he
[14:44] told the story unto you that uh that
[14:47] study you know amen what really was
[14:49] behind the scenes as brother Bam had
[14:51] talked about a seven squirrel and
[14:53] somebody was wondering whether he had
[14:54] told the truth about the story or not.
[14:57] And he went out the next morning and he
[14:59] found the seven squirrel but he didn't
[15:01] find it normally. He just said, "It'll
[15:03] be there under that log." And walked
[15:05] over and picked it up and took it back
[15:06] and said, "Here's the seventh squirrel."
[15:08] Amen. And somebody in the room, amen,
[15:11] was well well, we knew you would find
[15:13] it. Basically, they were calling him
[15:15] like he was telling the story wrong. And
[15:17] and and Hadtie said, "Brother Bam said,
[15:19] how in the world did that happen?" She
[15:21] said, "Well," he said, "Well, sister had
[15:24] all I can tell you is it like it was
[15:26] when Abraham was up there on that
[15:27] mountain and that ram was in that bush."
[15:30] He said he's still the same Jehovah
[15:32] Gyra. And that lady had the right thing.
[15:35] She said that ain't nothing but the
[15:37] truth. Amen. And there come an agreement
[15:40] with the word of God. And when that
[15:42] agreement came, the power of salvation
[15:45] fell in that room and her children were
[15:47] saved. And I I TELL YOU, IF YOU WANT TO
[15:49] GET SOMETHING FROM GOD, just start
[15:51] agreeing with the word of God. Amen.
[15:52] Amen. When the WORD OF GOD SAYS
[15:54] SOMETHING, PUT YOUR HEART WITH IT and
[15:56] begin to agree with it. Amen. AND YOU
[15:58] WILL FIND that it WILL UNLOCK A POWER TO
[16:01] YOU. AMEN. That goes back to the very
[16:04] source of almighty God. We're not
[16:06] talking about denominational power.
[16:08] We're not talking about rel religiosity
[16:11] or traditional power. We're talking
[16:13] about the power of God is released when
[16:17] you go into agreement with the word of
[16:19] the age that you're living in.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; My when I think about that today, I I
[16:24] think about these beautiful scriptures
[16:26] that are laying here. Amen. When the
[16:28] when when when when Paul is trying to
[16:30] tell the Hebrews, he's trying to tell
[16:33] them, "Listen, Amen. I know you have
[16:35] your Jewish laws and you have your
[16:36] prophets and you have your Jewish
[16:38] traditions and and it's all laying
[16:40] there." Amen. But there's a power to be
[16:42] excessed by the one that created the
[16:45] heavens and the earth. Amen. Has changed
[16:48] sensations. And he's the same God. Amen.
[16:52] But these things have been given to you
[16:54] and I through the word of God. When I I
[16:57] think about that this morning, I think
[16:59] about the parallel of that time because
[17:01] in the changing of dispensations, that's
[17:04] when people get mixed up. You know,
[17:05] Brother Brandon said it. He said it's
[17:07] hard for the Lutheran to see. He said
[17:09] when the Wesley begin to preach the
[17:11] message of sanctification, he said so
[17:13] hard for them to see it. He said, "And
[17:15] when the Pentecostals begin to receive
[17:17] the gifts and the spirit began to fall,
[17:19] he said IT WAS SO HARD FOR them Wesley
[17:22] and that that sanctified group, it was
[17:24] so hard for them to receive the moving
[17:27] of that spirit." He said, "And is it's
[17:29] so hard today for those Pentecostals to
[17:32] see the message of the hour. It's hard
[17:34] for them to see it, but God sent it
[17:36] anyhow." Amen. And what they don't
[17:38] realize is every bit of the power that
[17:40] they experienced in Isuza Street, God
[17:43] wasn't taking that away. When he brought
[17:45] the word, he was giving an access not to
[17:48] just a part of it, BUT TO THE COMPLETE
[17:51] POWER of God through the message of the
[17:54] hour. When I think about this today, I
[17:56] think of the prophet of God and the
[17:58] unveiling of God. And he begins to talk
[18:00] to the church. And he said, now notice
[18:02] here, he says, he came as a prophet and
[18:05] they crucified him.
[18:07] He said he came, amen, as the son of
[18:09] man. Then after the Holy Spirit came, he
[18:12] was then the son of God. God is a
[18:15] spirit. And he was the Holy Spirit, son
[18:17] of God who lived through the church ages
[18:20] as the son of God. And in the
[18:22] millennium, he'll be the son of David.
[18:24] Now, we're changing dispensations. He'll
[18:26] be the king, the son of David in the
[18:28] millennium, sitting upon the throne of
[18:30] his father, David. He is the son of
[18:32] David. Now, and remember between the son
[18:35] of God and the Leodysia church age had
[18:37] put him out and Luke said he would be
[18:40] revealed again as the son of man the
[18:43] prophet will be fulfilling the rest of
[18:45] it. See the scripture ties perfectly
[18:47] together. The son of man, the son of
[18:49] God, the son of David. What is it? It's
[18:52] the same God all the time. He said just
[18:56] changing his form.
[18:58] Amen. What is it? It's just changed.
[19:00] It's the same God all the time. It's
[19:04] just changed. NOW, WHAT HE'S DOING IS is
[19:06] when he comes to fulfill the scriptures.
[19:09] It's not that he does away with it. He
[19:11] fulfills it so as that you will know if
[19:14] you are a workman of God. The Bible said
[19:16] that we had to rightly divide the word
[19:18] of truth that the workman be not
[19:20] ashamed. Is that right? So, brother
[19:22] Random tell us this. He'll say you can't
[19:25] do Saturday's work on Tuesday and you
[19:28] can't do Amen. Sunday's work on
[19:30] Saturday. And brother Brandham is
[19:32] telling us in the rising of the sun,
[19:34] this ain't Saturday, folks. Amen. IN
[19:36] OTHER WORDS, HE'S telling you this is
[19:39] not just another Pentecostal age. This
[19:42] is the resurrection of the SON OF GOD.
[19:45] WE HAVE WENT BACK TO THE FIRST day
[19:47] again. THE CHURCH IS AN ORDER OF THE NEW
[19:49] CREATION. WE'RE NOT JUST A A LITTLE
[19:52] AMPED UP PENTECOSTALS. WE'RE NOT
[19:54] PENTECOSTALS THAT JUST UH AMEN. STUDIED
[19:57] THE WORD A LITTLE BETTER. AMEN. WE'RE OF
[19:59] THE ORIGINAL BRANCH OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
[20:02] CHURCH. AND THIS WORD HAS BROUGHT US
[20:05] BACK TO THE FOUNDATION of the teachings
[20:07] of the word of God in the age we're
[20:09] living in. And now what it's done is
[20:11] this message has fulfilled the
[20:13] generations. NOW IN GOD'S chosen place
[20:15] of worship, how many knows God chooses
[20:17] where you worship?
[20:19] &gt;&gt; IN GOD'S CHOSEN PLACE OF WORSHIP,
[20:20] brother Bam said, I want to ask you
[20:22] something. HE SAID WE MIGHT SAY IN
[20:24] Malachi 4 that aren't we also a promised
[20:26] an eagle a pillar of fire to be
[20:29] following to cho show the Aaron church
[20:31] of this day that in Hebrews 13 and8
[20:34] Jesus the same yesterday today and
[20:36] forever aren't we promised another one
[20:38] to come flying from the wilderness
[20:40] that's exactly the truth how fitting and
[20:43] matching is Luke 17:30 where the son of
[20:46] man eagle will be revealing himself to
[20:50] bring to not all other worship places
[20:54] such as denominations and so forth. Now,
[20:56] that I want you to hear what he just
[20:58] said. He said, "It'll come to not." Now,
[21:00] that's a good hillbilly word. Amen.
[21:02] It'll come to nothing. In other words,
[21:04] when this message comes forward, Amen.
[21:07] The only approach and worship to God is
[21:10] under what he releases. Now, somebody
[21:13] said, "Well, then you mean, AMEN, YOU
[21:15] GOT to come to BUT BUT IF YOU JUST MAKE
[21:17] IT the message of William Brandom,
[21:19] that's cultish, friends. that that's
[21:21] just another creed, another
[21:23] denomination. But if you recognize that
[21:26] it's not just the message of William
[21:28] Brandham we're talking about, it is the
[21:30] second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:34] And the FIRST PART OF THAT SECOND COMING
[21:36] IS ATTACHED TO THE APPEARING of the son
[21:38] of man which is fulfilling 1
[21:40] Thessalonians 4, Luke 17, Malachi 4,
[21:44] Revelations 10, REVELATIONS 5, the end
[21:46] of Revelations 3. SEE, IT'S THE
[21:48] FULFILLING OF THE WORD OF GOD. THIS IS
[21:50] NOT JUST ABOUT A MAN, A KUCKIAN. IT'S
[21:53] NOT ABOUT JUST THAT HILLBILLY BROTHER
[21:54] BRANDHAM AS GOD BLESS HIM. We love
[21:56] Brother Brandham. Don't Amen. BUT IT'S
[21:58] NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. DON'T YOU REDUCE OR
[22:00] WEAKEN THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO JUST ONE
[22:02] MAN. THIS IS THE COMING OF THE LORD
[22:05] JESUS CHRIST AND MANIFEST AND FULFILL
[22:08] THE WORD OF THE AGE WE'RE LIVING IN. WE
[22:10] HAVE CHANGED IN DISPENSATIONS. WE ARE
[22:13] NOT JUST IN THE CHURCH AGE AT THIS
[22:15] POINT. WE HAVE COME INTO THE
[22:17] MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE AGE
[22:19] WE'RE living in. My goodness, to bring
[22:22] to place all other worship. In other
[22:24] words, you know, you can worship God and
[22:25] it be in vain. There are many gatherings
[22:28] this morning, Amen, that's in vain. I I
[22:30] hate to sound that way, but folks, it's
[22:33] in vain. Amen. Don't you start looking
[22:35] at other generations and other
[22:37] denominations and thinking, "Well, it
[22:39] ain't so bad after all." Yes, it is. No,
[22:42] no, it is not worship to God.
[22:46] It's the truth, folks. Amen. What is it?
[22:49] Amen. It's brought to not all other
[22:51] places of worship. You know, the Bible
[22:53] tells us, Amen, that it'll come to pass
[22:55] in the last days that it'll be such a
[22:57] deception, AMEN, THAT EVEN the elect
[23:00] would be deceived if it was possible.
[23:02] But it's NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE GOD HAD
[23:05] PUT a seed inside of your heart to
[23:07] recognize THE CHANGE THAT HAS HAPPENED
[23:10] IN THIS GENERATION. My goodness, to
[23:12] think of this. Brother Bam said in
[23:14] Malachi 4, he'll turn the hearts of
[23:16] these children. These things are not for
[23:18] another age. This baptism in Jesus' name
[23:21] is not for back there. He's now the
[23:23] same. And he's brought to not all other
[23:26] places of worship. That's what this last
[23:28] a eagle is to do. Amen. The rest of it
[23:31] is foolishness and denominational folly.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; THE REST OF IT IS foolishness and
[23:40] denominational folly. Amen. but to point
[23:43] them again with the same sign. He's the
[23:46] same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[23:50] have not just received a prophet, we
[23:53] have received the son of man.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. See what is going on.
[24:00] You you see what Paul is introducing
[24:02] back here in the Hebrews is he's telling
[24:04] those Jews, this is more than just this
[24:07] what you're what you're calling Jesus of
[24:09] Nazareth and just this movement around
[24:11] this man. And it THAT'S ALL THEY THOUGHT
[24:14] IT WAS IS THIS DRUNKEN soldier son and
[24:18] he's a bastard born and you can make fun
[24:20] of him AND YOU YOU SEE WHAT THEY SAW.
[24:22] THEY THEY THEY RIDICULED it and within
[24:24] their own camps THEY SO MINIMIZED IT
[24:27] THAT IT REALLY HAD NO IMPORTANCE AT ALL.
[24:29] BUT WHEN ISAIAH SAW IT, HE SAID, "MY,
[24:31] WHEN HE COMES," HE SAID, "THE MOUNTAINS
[24:34] WILL BECOME low and THE AND THE VALLEYS
[24:36] WILL BECOME HIGH AND THE CROOKED PLACES
[24:38] WILL BECOME STRAIGHT." ISAIAH SAW IT AS
[24:40] CATACLYSMIC CHANGE UPON THE FACE OF
[24:43] GOD'S CREATION. AND WHEN THE PHARISEES
[24:45] SAW IT, they saw nothing more, amen,
[24:47] than something they could laugh and
[24:49] SCORN AND MAKE FUN OF. But when HE DIED
[24:52] AND WAS BURIED and resurrected again,
[24:54] WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED him in Jerusalem, it
[24:57] all changed right there. and they can
[24:59] crucify another million lambs and it has
[25:02] no effect with God.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; My goodness. I'll tell you, brother man
[25:07] SAID IT LIKE THIS. GOD IS CHRIST as
[25:09] God's provided lamb. How appropriate.
[25:12] Showing that Jerusalem was ceasing and
[25:14] it was in effect until the hour the
[25:16] blood of the lamb was all right until
[25:19] that day. Do you know the crucifixion
[25:21] changed it
[25:24] &gt;&gt; and the old system was done?
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Now you you notice the Bible there. They
[25:28] crucified him. Brother Brham said the
[25:29] most holy people, the most holy city,
[25:31] the most holy God. There they crucified
[25:33] him. And somebody says to me, "Brother
[25:35] Wayne, when did the dispensation
[25:37] change?" Brother Brham said the
[25:38] crucifixion changed it.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; We had the message a long time before
[25:44] they crucified it.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; JUST GO WATCH OUR LORD JESUS AND WATCH
[25:48] HIM ON THE earth 33 years. But when they
[25:51] crucified him, it changed
[25:54] &gt;&gt; UNTIL THAT VERY HOUR. BUT THEN THEY
[25:56] CRUCIFIED HIM. It changed. And brother
[25:59] Bam said the crucifixion is what changes
[26:01] it. The old system is done and there was
[26:04] a new one and the lamb was a sacrifice.
[26:06] Now they were condemning and doing the
[26:08] very thing they had to do. That's right.
[26:10] God be blessed for seeing this wonderful
[26:11] heavenly light in this last day because
[26:13] the churches are doing the same thing
[26:15] again today until the hour that the
[26:18] organization and religion is condemned.
[26:20] And they have proved to be sacrificing
[26:23] Christ's word. From then on comes the
[26:25] word and the word only. My, that's a
[26:28] refrigerator quote for you. It's the
[26:31] word and the word only. We're not
[26:33] joining a denomination. We're not
[26:35] joining a creed OR A GROUP OF brothers
[26:37] or SOME ORGANIZATION. AMEN. FROM that
[26:40] moment on, it is the word and the word
[26:43] only. AND THE WORD COMES to a prophet.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can get together with all your
[26:51] buddies AND AND MAKE UP A BELIEF SYSTEM.
[26:53] And God ain't going to order it.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU CAN SEE A WHOLE GROUP OF
[26:58] GUYS CAN GET TOGETHER AND SAY, "WELL,
[26:59] THEM THEM BUNCH OF RANDOMMITES DOWN
[27:01] THERE. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF CRAZY PEOPLE
[27:03] AND YOU AIN'T GOT TO LISTEN TO THEM."
[27:04] AND GOD AIN'T HONORING one thing they
[27:06] have to say.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to take it a little
[27:09] deeper for just a moment. And that DEVIL
[27:11] CAN GET ALL OF THE HIS LITTLE DEMONS
[27:13] AROUND him and they can have them a real
[27:15] rally and revival and they can make fun
[27:17] of YOU AND TALK BAD ABOUT YOU AND THEY
[27:19] SAY, "WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT MAN,
[27:21] HE AIN'T NO GOOD FOR NOTHING." AND AND
[27:23] I'LL TELL YOU AND AND THEY CAN JUST
[27:25] START PILING IT ON AND THEY'LL COME
[27:26] RIGHT TO YOUR SLEEP AND THEY'LL GET THAT
[27:28] WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING, THEY'LL
[27:29] BE RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE NO GOOD. AND
[27:31] AMEN. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HEAR ONE
[27:33] word of it.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; THE MOMENT THEY CRUCIFIED THIS WORD, IT
[27:38] BECAME THE WORD AND THE WORD ONLY. AMEN.
[27:41] IF THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "I WAS A SON
[27:44] BEFORE THE WORLD EVER BEGAN. I DON'T
[27:46] HAVE TO HEAR NOTHING ELSE. I AIN'T GOT
[27:49] TO TALK TO NOBODY. I AIN'T GOT TO ASK
[27:51] SOMEBODY. I DON'T HAVE TO GET CHURCH
[27:54] PERMISSION. I DON'T HAVE TO GET A
[27:55] PREACHERS'S PERMISSION. AMEN. I'M A SON
[27:58] BECAUSE HE SAID I'M A SON.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO BE TO GOD. AMEN. FORGET IT.
[28:05] AWAY WITH RELIGION. WHAT DOES THE WORD
[28:07] OF GOD SAY ABOUT YOU?
[28:09] &gt;&gt; SHE'S A SPOTLESS BRIDE BEFORE THE
[28:12] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND THOUGH HALF
[28:14] OF THE NATION THINKS SOMETHING CRAZY
[28:16] ABOUT YOU, IT DON'T MATTER WHAT THEY
[28:18] THINK about you. Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; You know, the greatest delivering power
[28:23] in the world is when you quit caring
[28:24] what people think about you.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; When you let the words of man lose
[28:30] gravity over you and you just believe
[28:32] the word of God,
[28:35] &gt;&gt; IF THEY SPOKE THAT WAY OF OUR LORD, WHAT
[28:38] DO YOU EXPECT them to say about you?
[28:41] &gt;&gt; It was so far that the Bible said, "When
[28:43] all men speak well of you, YOU TAKE
[28:44] HEED. YOU WATCH OUT. WHEN EVERYBODY
[28:47] TALKS GOOD ABOUT YOU, YOU WATCH OUT. YOU
[28:49] OUGHT TO HAVE A GOOD TESTIMONY among
[28:51] your own. AMEN. BUT PEOPLE'S GOING TO
[28:53] THINK YOU'RE A FANATIC. WHO CARES?
[28:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; You really believe in THAT HOLY GHOST
[29:00] STUFF AND ROLLING IN THE FLOOR AND
[29:01] STUFF. ABSOLUTELY.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[29:06] I'm a one of them.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL really believe in like PILLARS OF
[29:10] FIRE AND PROPHETIC THINGS. And y'all
[29:13] really believe in that? I'm one of them.
[29:16] Amen. Before I could read THE BIBLE,
[29:18] GOOD, I ALREADY HEARD WHAT JESUS COULD
[29:21] DO. DON'T TELL ME BECAUSE I LEARNED TO
[29:23] READ THE BIBLE. AMEN. THAT JESUS QUIT
[29:26] DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE I HAD ANY
[29:28] KNOWLEDGE.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; BEFORE I GOT SAVED, I KNEW HE WAS A
[29:33] CREATOR AND A HEALER. AND I KNEW BEFORE
[29:36] I WAS SAVED, I KNEW HE WAS MIGHTY AND
[29:38] POWERFUL. AMEN. COME ON. THERE'S THERE'S
[29:40] PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD THAT AIN'T even
[29:42] ever heard of the message. Amen. I'll
[29:43] tell you the miracle working power
[29:45] working of God. IT DON'T TELL ME WE come
[29:47] in the message and then somehow that
[29:49] dampened or watered down.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; You see that old pascal lamb passed away
[29:56] and Christ become our lamb at the
[29:57] crucifixion.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; And the day the denomination crucified
[30:01] the word of God and accepted creed
[30:03] instead of the word. That's the day
[30:06] &gt;&gt; that the word come into full effect.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; That's just been recently. That's out of
[30:11] the second the indictment of this
[30:13] generation. Brother Bam indicted them
[30:15] for the second crucifixion of our Lord
[30:16] Jesus. He said not on a cross, a rugged
[30:20] wood cross. He said from a wooden pull
[30:22] pit they did it.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; He said but they can't crucify the flesh
[30:25] cuz it ain't here. He said so they'll
[30:28] crucify the effect of that word.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; My it's no good and it's just another
[30:34] man and it's
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the day they crucified it,
[30:37] they become ineffective places of
[30:39] worship. and from the word and the word
[30:41] only. Amen. Brother man said it was the
[30:43] end of the church age. The son of man
[30:45] was revealed and Jesus was ending that
[30:47] Jewish age.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God was entering ending
[30:52] in end ending this gentile dispensation.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's I don't have time to preach
[30:57] these things, but I'll give it to you.
[30:58] That's why he said the seven seal ends
[31:00] all things.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Did it end it right then? No.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; But it ends all things.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when a prophet began to
[31:08] announce it, it was over. Whether it was
[31:10] a day or a year or a month, it's over.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Now, now watch it. Watch, Brother Bam. I
[31:15] I often I often say it like this. You
[31:18] climb you climb top of a tower. If you
[31:20] could see Goomer about at about uh 10:00
[31:23] this morning, had you been real high
[31:25] with a good pair of binoculars and you
[31:27] could have seen me leave my driveway and
[31:30] you could have announced to the people
[31:32] standing around that tire, "Hey, Brother
[31:33] Wayne's coming." But it would HAVE BEEN
[31:36] A HALF HOUR BEFORE I pulled up in that
[31:37] drive out there. Amen. BUT WHEN DID I
[31:40] LEAVE?
[31:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN THE GUY SAW ME DO IT
[31:44] &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE HAD A PROPHET AMONG US THAT
[31:46] HAS CLIMBED UP THERE IN ANOTHER WORLD
[31:49] and made an ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CHURCH.
[31:51] WE HAVE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE
[31:53] PENTECOSTALS. WE HAVE GOT THE WORD OF
[31:56] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND GOD HAS
[31:59] BROUGHT US OUT OF ALL THE DEAD DARK
[32:01] DENOMINATIONALISM AND THE CONFUSION OF
[32:04] THIS AGE. WE HAVE A MESSAGE.
[32:07] GLORY BE TO GOD. I'm so glad this
[32:10] morning that I'm not in the hands of a
[32:12] bunch of traditional idealists and amen
[32:14] and confusion and amen following
[32:17] somebody this way and follow another guy
[32:18] that way and following it this way. Oh,
[32:20] I say amen, raise up the banner of the
[32:23] pillar of fire AND LET'S FOLLOW HIM.
[32:25] AMEN. THE LEADER OF THE CHURCH. Let's
[32:27] follow him.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; It's the son of man.
[32:33] Amen. I I know you're familiar with
[32:35] these things. That's why I hit them
[32:36] fastly. Amen. It's the son of man. These
[32:39] words are fulfilled before us. If you're
[32:40] watching, watch the attraction. Brother
[32:42] said, "3 years ago, these things was a
[32:44] prophecy."
[32:46] But what time is it, sir? It was a
[32:48] prophecy. But now is it history? The
[32:52] promise is fulfilled. So what time is
[32:54] it? And what's the attraction? God
[32:56] fulfills his word. SO YOU'RE WONDERING
[32:58] WHAT TIME is it? God fulfilled his word.
[33:00] That's the time. It's the time that when
[33:02] God does it, then you turn to what God
[33:04] did. We're at the end time. End time
[33:06] evangelism. Brother Brand, I'm going to
[33:08] say this. We're at the end time. You
[33:09] see, we have changed dispensations from
[33:12] the old church age back there where the
[33:14] dismal day was. And we got to join the
[33:17] church and put your name on a book until
[33:19] the evening light, the restoration, the
[33:21] return again of the Holy Spirit upon the
[33:23] earth. Another Pentecost, another sign,
[33:26] ANOTHER THING THAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE.
[33:28] AND ALL THE people doesn't believe it
[33:30] because they're SO SET LIKE THEY was in
[33:32] the days of Jesus. And he told us this
[33:35] day would be here. It is a changing of
[33:38] dispensation.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; It is a changing of dispensation. Watch
[33:43] here in the adoption. I love this little
[33:45] uh quote here. You believe in
[33:47] dispensations of the Bible. Amen. See
[33:50] the dispensation of the fullness of
[33:51] time. There's been a dispensation SEE OF
[33:54] THE MOSAIC LAW. There's been a dis
[33:56] dispensation of John the Baptist. There
[33:58] was a dispensation of Christ. There's a
[34:00] dispensation of church organization.
[34:02] There's a dispensation of the outpouring
[34:04] of the Holy Spirit. BUT NOW IT'S the
[34:07] dispensation OF ADOPTION. HALLELUJAH.
[34:11] THE CHURCH IS GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
[34:13] MIND OF GOD.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE, FOLK. WE'RE NOT
[34:18] JUST FLOATING ALONG AS CHURCH MEMBERS.
[34:21] WE HAVE DIRECTION by the pillar of fire.
[34:24] We're going somewhere.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Can I pull up Hebrews chapter 1 and
[34:28] verse three? I want to read this to you
[34:30] again. Who being the brightness of his
[34:32] glory and the expressed image of his
[34:35] person and upholding all things.
[34:38] Somebody say it with me. Upholding all
[34:39] things. Upholding all things by the word
[34:43] of his power. Now, I want you to think
[34:45] about this. Not just spiritual things.
[34:49] We're not just talking about spiritual
[34:51] things. We're talking about all things.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just spirit things, but all
[34:55] things. FROM THE GALAXIES IN heaven to
[34:57] the breath in your lungs, he upholds all
[35:00] things.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; My, if you got breath this morning,
[35:04] that's why the Bible said every man that
[35:05] have breath. LET HIM PRAISE THE LORD.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; That breath don't belong to you. IT
[35:10] BELONGS TO GOD. YOU'RE UPHELD. THE VERY
[35:13] THE VERY LIFE THAT YOU HAVE THIS MORNING
[35:15] comes from God. Everything around you,
[35:18] all things are upheld by the word of his
[35:21] power. AMEN. SEE, GOD DOES NOT UPHOLD
[35:24] THINGS WITH ARMIES. He doesn't uphold it
[35:27] with effort. Aren't you glad? It's not
[35:29] human effort. It's not human ability. He
[35:31] doesn't uphold IT LIKE THAT. HE DOESN'T
[35:33] even hold it even maybe with his hands.
[35:36] But he upholds it with his word.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS IS NOT JUST A PASSIVE
[35:42] STATEMENT. THIS IS ACTIVE and constant
[35:44] sustaining OF THE SOVEREIGN ONE OF GOD.
[35:47] THIS Y'ALL REALIZE that this word I just
[35:50] love this word upholding. Amen. It's
[35:52] upholding. Look how he says upholding.
[35:55] Not just uphold. Upholding.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Now, it matters because in the Greek,
[36:00] this word is not a noun or an adjective.
[36:03] It's a verb.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; This is an action statement. YOU I
[36:07] ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT IT. WELL, HE
[36:08] UPHOLDS THINGS LIKE HE JUST TAKES IT IN
[36:10] HIS HAND. He holds it up. Amen. That's
[36:12] no. HE'S UPHOLDING. IT'S a it's a it's
[36:15] an active verb. It's something THAT HE
[36:18] CONTINUES TO DO. HERE WE ARE 4,000 YEARS
[36:21] PAST CREATION AND GOD'S STILL HOLDING
[36:23] THE UNIVERSE.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; I was listening to the brother Bram last
[36:26] night and the power of God. He said,
[36:28] "You tell me when it turns nighttime who
[36:30] hangs out all the stars in the heavens?"
[36:32] He said, "The power of God."
[36:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHO IS IT IN THE MORNING TOOK
[36:36] the sun and put it there?" Amen. And
[36:38] told it to rise? He said it was God. WHO
[36:41] IS IT THAT TAKES A BRUSH AND THE SUNSET
[36:43] AND BRUSHES THE PAINTS THE THE SKIES AND
[36:45] THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL? HE SAID IT'S THE
[36:47] POWER OF GOD. AMEN. WHAT IS IT MAKES THE
[36:49] SONG IN THE BIRD? IT'S THE POWER OF GOD.
[36:52] WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU COME TO CHURCH
[36:54] AND WORSHIP ON A SUNDAY MORNING? IT'S
[36:56] THE POWER OF GOD. AMEN. HE IS UPHOLDING
[36:59] ALL THINGS
[37:01] &gt;&gt; BY THE power of God.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; My when I think about him upholding
[37:05] these things by his word, not with
[37:07] armies or efforts, but by the word of
[37:09] God. It's a Greek word fiel which means
[37:12] to carry to bear forward toward a goal.
[37:14] It's the idea that Jesus didn't just
[37:17] hold creation, but he's moving it toward
[37:19] a purpose.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; He's moving it toward a purpose. Amen.
[37:26] You know, the word was powerful in
[37:29] creation.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be."
[37:33] &gt;&gt; There was.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be," it
[37:36] responded.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; It's not because of the power of the
[37:40] word.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; It's because of who spoke. That's right.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; You see, it was the word of creative
[37:49] power that was speaking.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So when he spoke something, something
[37:54] responded
[37:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS CREATION. THAT SAME one
[37:58] that said, "Let there be," stood on the
[38:00] bow of a boat, in the Bible and said,
[38:03] "Peace be still." to the waves he
[38:05] created.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Because the words, "PEACE BE STILL,"
[38:10] COULD HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY MANY PEOPLE.
[38:12] BUT WHEN THE ONE WHO CREATED THE WAVES
[38:15] SAID, "PEACE, BE STILL," THEY HELD STILL
[38:18] BECAUSE IT WAS POWER THAT WAS SPEAKING.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T just empty words. It wasn't
[38:22] just man's words. It was the power of
[38:24] God released upon that storm by word.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; My when I think about it, I think about
[38:31] that same one that walked to Lazarus
[38:33] tomb and said, "Lazarus, come out of
[38:35] there." They thought it was too late,
[38:36] folk. Everybody thought it was too late.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; They thought it was too late for
[38:40] revival. you know, it's too late for
[38:41] something to happen. IT'S TOO LATE.
[38:43] AMEN. GIVE UP ON THAT PERSON. YOU KNOW,
[38:45] IT'S JUST TOO MUCH, TOO LATE. THEY'RE
[38:46] ALREADY STINKING and rotten. They're
[38:48] full of the world. There's no helping
[38:50] THEM AT ALL. SEE, BUT BUT BUT EVEN
[38:53] MARTHA SAID TO THE LORD, "LORD, HAD YOU
[38:55] BEEN HERE, HAD THEY BEEN AWARE OF THIS,
[38:57] THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DIED." And Jesus
[38:59] said, "Martha, even now, Amen. Right
[39:02] now, I am the resurrection and the life.
[39:04] And he that believeth on me, though he
[39:07] were dead, he shall live. WHOSOEVER
[39:09] LIVETH AND BELIEVETH IN ME SHALL NEVER
[39:11] DIE.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? HE SAYS, DO YOU
[39:15] BELIEVE THIS? AND BY THE WORD of his
[39:18] power, HE TURNED AROUND. THE POWER OF
[39:20] RESURRECTION WAS IN HIM. HE SAID, HE
[39:22] SAID, LAZARUS, COME FORTH. Oh God, I
[39:25] love it. And brother Bon said it. He
[39:27] said, if he' have said that in general,
[39:29] the whole the whole graveyard would have
[39:31] EMPTIED BECAUSE POWER WAS SPEAKING. HE
[39:34] HAD to name Lazarus. He had to he had to
[39:36] name him or there WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[39:38] CHURCHWIDE REVIVAL. THERE WOULD HAVE
[39:39] BEEN A NATIONWIDE REVIVAL. BUT IF HE'
[39:42] JUST SPEAK THAT NAME, IT WOULD BE TO THE
[39:44] INDIVIDUAL HE MEANT IT TO BE. IT WAS NOT
[39:47] a powerful word for the man laying NEXT
[39:49] TO HIM. IT WASN'T POWERFUL FOR THE MAN
[39:52] THREE TOMBS DOWN. BUT THE MAN NAMED
[39:54] LAZARUS, IT WAS THE WORD OF HIS POWER
[39:57] THAT SPOKE TO HIM. AND HE HAD TO COME
[40:00] FROM THE DEAD TO AGREE WITH IT.
[40:03] HALLELUJAH. HE HAD TO COME OUT OF THE
[40:05] DEAD TO AGREE WITH IT. AND I'LL TELL
[40:07] YOU, SOMETIMES GOD'S GOT TO BRING YOU
[40:09] OUT OF A STATE OF WHEN YOU GET NERVOUS
[40:11] AND UNDERNEATH THINGS AND ALL THIS AND
[40:14] HE'LL PREACH A WORD RIGHT TO YOU, BUT
[40:16] YOU'LL HAVE TO COME OUT OF IT TO RESPOND
[40:18] TO IT. I SAY COME OUT OF IT. I SAY AWAKE
[40:22] AND RISE, OH THOU THAT SLEEPEST, AND
[40:24] AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD. THAT'S A
[40:27] WORD FOR ME THIS MORNING. THAT'S A WORD
[40:29] FOR MY LIFE TODAY. WON'T MEAN nothing to
[40:31] a guy three rows down, but in my heart,
[40:35] HE SPOKE MY NAME.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody give ME SOME ROOM. HALLELUJAH.
[40:41] TELL SOMEBODY, GIVE ME SOME ROOM. I FEEL
[40:43] LIKE PRAISING GOD THIS MORNING. I FEEL
[40:45] LIKE PRAISING. I FEEL LIKE RESPONDING TO
[40:47] THE WORD OF GOD. I FEEL LIKE AGREEING TO
[40:50] THE WORD OF GOD. I'M LOOKING FOR A
[40:52] SUPERNATURAL MOVE IN THE HOLY GHOST. AND
[40:54] THE WORD IS COMING. AND THE WORD IS
[40:57] COMING. MY OPPORTUNITY HAS ARRIVED.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; You wake up on Friday, say, "Well, I
[41:05] can't wait for Sunday." You can wake up
[41:07] on Saturday, you say, "I can't wait for
[41:09] Sunday." Well, Sunday is here. Amen. You
[41:12] have arrived. You ain't got to wait
[41:14] another hour, another day, and man of
[41:16] God is preaching THE WORD OF GOD. YOU
[41:18] GOT A SEED IN YOU THAT HAS A NEED FOR
[41:20] THE WORD OF GOD. AND THAT IS THE WORD OF
[41:22] HIS POWER THAT IS coming into your heart
[41:25] this word. Amen.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; He had to wake up to respond.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Well, [sighs]
[41:37] &gt;&gt; you know what had to happen? Demons had
[41:39] to let go of him.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Corruption had turned him loose.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; When it was spoken,
[41:47] it wasn't just awaken,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; it was loosening.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Look, look what he done. The word
[41:53] upheld.
[41:54] And it it didn't just awaken him. It
[41:56] took him from an awakening state. And
[41:59] the word produced a transformation THAT
[42:02] PUT HIM BACK LIKE HE WAS BEFORE SICKNESS
[42:04] GOT A HOLD OF IT. THIS WORD, THIS
[42:07] MESSAGE IS NOT JUST TO WAKE YOU UP OR
[42:10] JUST TO GIVE YOU A NEW BIRTH. IT'S TO
[42:12] PUT YOU BACK IN THE ORIGINAL STATE THAT
[42:14] GOD HAD IN HIS MIND OF WHAT A TRUE SON
[42:16] IS. COME ON. WE'RE NOT A CHURCH. WE'RE A
[42:20] SON, A DAUGHTER OF GOD, THE BRIDE OF
[42:23] JESUS CHRIST. IT WAS BUILT TO DO MORE
[42:26] THAN JUST GIVE YOU a birth.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S UPHOLDING YOU. IT'S MOVING YOU.
[42:32] IT'S BEARING YOU. HE'S BEARING YOU ON
[42:34] EAGLE'S WINGS. HE'S PICKED YOU UP AND
[42:36] HE'S CARRYING YOU INTO the adoption.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Do you see that dispensation's adoption,
[42:43] folks?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; So, you're hearing the word of your
[42:47] adoption.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; You remember the story? He would took
[42:52] him out on a in a and the angels would
[42:54] take him in a public place and then
[42:56] announce authority over him. What do you
[42:57] think happened when the seals opened,
[43:00] &gt;&gt; we had them out? We had a a Jordan and
[43:03] transfiguration and so did we have an
[43:05] Ohio
[43:06] &gt;&gt; and a sunset,
[43:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:09] &gt;&gt; And on sunset a word opened.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; And that word brought to not all your
[43:14] other teachings.
[43:17] It finished
[43:20] &gt;&gt; everything everybody else was telling
[43:21] you.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, Moses. It was the end of your
[43:24] Egyptian education. That's what
[43:25] happened.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; And God sent a word at an appointed time
[43:32] by angels to announce over brother said
[43:36] they come for that day. He said the word
[43:38] of God came for you. Right
[43:41] &gt;&gt; now, think of this because it's a word
[43:44] of adoption.
[43:46] This this word furial, it's a beautiful
[43:48] word. It's powerful, more more powerful
[43:50] than we could ever exhibit here. But
[43:53] I'll say this, it means to bear, to
[43:56] bring forth, to carry. It means to be
[43:59] driven, to endure, to go on, to lay, to
[44:01] lead, to move, to reach, to rushing, to
[44:02] uphold.
[44:04] So it's an active word.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Now, if you read that again, it's so odd
[44:09] how it reads. and upholding all things
[44:13] by the word of his power. You know, the
[44:15] Bible said the word doesn't go out void,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; but it'll uphold all things.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; It'll accomplish.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; It'll it it'll accomplish that which was
[44:27] spoken
[44:28] &gt;&gt; until it fulfillment. Uh uh in first
[44:30] Peter, the same word uh Greek is used.
[44:32] 1st Peter 1:13, it's beautiful. He says,
[44:35] "Being brought," see, completely the
[44:38] hope of grace now being brought. But
[44:40] pull that up in the in the uh 1st Peter
[44:42] 1:13. Read it like this. Wherefore g
[44:44] your loins of your mind and be sober and
[44:48] hope to the end the grace
[44:51] that is to be brought unto you at the
[44:53] revelation Jesus Christ. How many knows
[44:55] what grace that is right there?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; There was a grace delivered and then
[45:00] there's a grace to be brought.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; That's why that Zechariah 4 said grace.
[45:04] Grace to the headstone.
[45:06] grace that started the dispensation
[45:08] &gt;&gt; and a grace to be delivered.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Which we would title it rapture grace.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; That's why when the thunder's open,
[45:15] brother Bram said it'll be faith for
[45:16] grace.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Because you can't set this grace without
[45:20] faith.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. But watch what he says under the
[45:25] hope of him. For the grace that is
[45:27] brought unto
[45:29] Now watch this. The fuller expanded
[45:31] rendering of this Greek. Amen. I'm just
[45:34] reading it out of dictionary. Yes. He
[45:35] says, "Having girded up the loins of
[45:37] your mind, being radically moderate,
[45:41] completely hope on the grace being
[45:43] carried along to you in the revelation
[45:47] concerning Jesus Christ."
[45:49] &gt;&gt; The word is carrying along
[45:53] &gt;&gt; something that that will be revealed to
[45:55] you. It's carrying along. Don't you
[45:57] think every writer here put something in
[45:59] here for you?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And it was carried along. The word was
[46:04] carrying along something
[46:06] &gt;&gt; that would be revealed at the
[46:08] revelation. It means to bear up to
[46:10] carry. Now I I I think this this is an
[46:14] amazing um section of of scripture. I I
[46:18] like I like how he says it here. He said
[46:20] the following is an expanded view of
[46:23] this. We're in in the view of the
[46:25] meaning of salvation that extends to
[46:28] glorification.
[46:30] A salvation that extends. So he upholds
[46:33] all things. So it extends
[46:35] unto glorification. In other words, this
[46:37] word of his power will move you
[46:41] &gt;&gt; from salvation to glorification.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; As brother Bam teaches us, we're in a
[46:45] humiliated tabernacle.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; But we're moving to a glorified
[46:49] tabernacle.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; How are you going to go from humiliation
[46:55] to glorification? How you getting there?
[46:57] &gt;&gt; The word of his power. Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; That's the agent that will carry you
[47:04] from humiliation to glorification. It's
[47:06] what will carry you from sadness to joy.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; It's what's going to carry you from
[47:13] sickness to health.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; DIDN'T HE SAY, "I'LL SEND MY WORD AND
[47:16] I'll heal them."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When his WORD COMES, THE HEALER is
[47:21] in that word. AND IF YOU'RE SICK AND YOU
[47:24] NEED HEALING, THERE IS SOMETHING THAT
[47:26] WILL uphold you in that word AND IT'LL
[47:29] BEAR YOU TO A HEALING. IT'LL BRING YOU
[47:31] TO YOUR HEALING. BROTHER said it would.
[47:33] He said when you have prayer OVER YOU
[47:35] AND THE BIBLE SAID CONFESS YOUR faults
[47:37] one to the other and then lay hands AND
[47:38] HAVE PRAYER. BROTHER Ba on every time
[47:41] nearly he prayed for somebody, he
[47:42] followed it up by saying, "Now go thank
[47:44] the Lord for your healing
[47:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WORD YOU GO THANKING GOD
[47:50] FOR WHAT YOU DID AND HE IS A HIGH PRIEST
[47:52] OF YOUR CONFESSION." AMEN. ISN'T IT
[47:55] SOMETHING THAT GOD GIVE US SOMETHING TO
[47:56] SAY? Y'ALL Y'ALL have heard me preach on
[47:58] old uh that that blind fell the sitting
[48:01] in the barber chair. I forget his name
[48:03] just now, but Amen. He he said in the he
[48:05] said in the barber chair and and brother
[48:07] Bham said when he come into prayer line
[48:09] he was blind. Brother Bham said you're
[48:10] going to heal. Thus sayith the Lord
[48:12] you're healed. And he left blind come
[48:14] back in the prayer line blind. And he
[48:16] said brother Brandham you said I was
[48:17] healed. Brother Bam said you said you
[48:18] believe me.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I can't see. He said what's that got to
[48:22] do with it?
[48:24] And and the man said, BROTHER B SAID,
[48:26] "THEN I SAW I had to give him something
[48:28] to say,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; the word
[48:33] &gt;&gt; of his healing."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; BROTHER MAN SAID, "YOU GO TESTIFY YOU'VE
[48:36] BEEN HEALED." Nothing changed.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; His eyesight DIDN'T CHANGE. HIS AMEN.
[48:41] NOTHING CHANGED,
[48:43] &gt;&gt; BUT HIS CONFESSION. AND WHEN HE LEFT
[48:46] AGREEING,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO AGREE WITH.
[48:51] AND WHEN HE LEFT AGREEING, HE COME BACK
[48:53] HEALED
[48:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT TOOK HIM FROM HIS BLINDNESS
[48:56] TO HIS SIGHT.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU TODAY, YOU TAKE A HOLD
[49:00] OF THIS MESSAGE AND YOU SAY WHAT THE
[49:02] PROPHET SAID ON THESE BOOKS AND TAPES
[49:04] AND IT'LL TAKE YOU FROM THIS MORTALITY
[49:07] IMMORTALITY. IT'LL TAKE YOU FROM A LAND
[49:10] OF DARKNESS AND CLOUDINESS AND CONFUSION
[49:13] INTO THE LAND THAT'S BRIGHTER THAN DAY.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. It'll carry you.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother man says, "Who's got any
[49:20] more power than God?" So, what kind of
[49:22] power have you got? Amen. Uh, overtake
[49:24] you that'll care for you. The power that
[49:27] created the universe. What power is
[49:30] taking care of you more. It's the power
[49:32] that created the universe. Now, in this
[49:35] sign of the end, Brother Bam makes this
[49:37] statement. He says, "See, now there's a
[49:38] third pull coming. Don't you try to
[49:41] explain it. See how I approached it
[49:43] tonight. I feel duty bound to my church
[49:46] to say something to draw your own
[49:47] conclusion. Amen. Brother Bam laid out a
[49:49] lot of stuff. Said now draw your
[49:51] conclusion from this. Is it the thunders
[49:53] or is it the climax of my ministry or is
[49:56] it the seven seal or he named several
[49:58] things. Well, if you'd like to study the
[50:00] message, it was all those things. Okay.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; This the third pull was all those
[50:07] things. The same as Jesus was the high
[50:09] priest, the lamb. All of them was a type
[50:12] of something. And it all pointed to him.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; And that's why when you get to the third
[50:17] pole, you start to recognize that it was
[50:19] him.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; See, the third pull was Christ. It
[50:23] wasn't It wasn't Brother Brandham.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; It was him. That's why Brother Brham
[50:26] said, "Watch these first two pools.
[50:27] Satan can impersonate them."
[50:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Matter of fact, Satan can
[50:32] impersonate anything God does, but he
[50:34] can't be him."
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And you see what he says about that
[50:38] third pole. They'll never impersonate it
[50:41] &gt;&gt; because it's him.
[50:43] That's right.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; It was him doing the speaking.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; How could William Brandham create that
[50:48] squirrel?
[50:50] &gt;&gt; HE COULD ONLY SPEAK IT. BUT IF IT WASN'T
[50:52] THE WORD OF POWER, IT WOULDN'T HAVE
[50:53] NEVER DONE NOTHING.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; You see, BUT WHEN HE SPEAKS, AMEN. THE
[50:59] CREATIVE power is in his word.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; I I I thank God. Amen. Do you see
[51:04] brother Bam said that this mystery will
[51:06] begin to open up and it'll bring power
[51:09] to the church.
[51:11] And it'll bring power to the church. You
[51:13] want to experience power, real power in
[51:15] your life, learn your dispensation.
[51:18] It's adoption.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Learn the messenger of your
[51:22] dispensation.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; It's Christ.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Do do you see how everybody's getting
[51:29] mixed up and they want that eighth
[51:30] messenger?
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Well, listen. There is an eighth
[51:33] messenger. It's Christ.
[51:37] Somebody said to me one time, "If it's a
[51:39] bride age, who's the messenger?" Christ.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of there's a lot of names
[51:46] out there. People trying to make eighth
[51:47] messengers and eighth ages and all that
[51:49] stuff. Amen. YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO? BUT
[51:51] they're the truth ALWAYS HAS TO SURVIVE
[51:55] the fanaticism.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; THERE AND THERE IS A MESSENGER OF THIS
[52:01] AGE, BUT THAT MESSENGER IS CHRIST. AND
[52:04] BECAUSE HE WAS OPERATING IN THE HUMAN
[52:07] BODY OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM, EVERYBODY
[52:10] CAN'T GET THE TWO SEPARATED.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; But if YOU CAN GET IT SEPARATED, IT WAS
[52:15] MORE THAN A MAN SPEAKING.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW,
[52:24] buckle your seat belt.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; But when the angel of the Lord moves
[52:29] down, it becomes a voice of God to you.
[52:35] IF I OFFENDED YOU BY saying that,
[52:36] forgive me. But I felt that might have
[52:38] been resented.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; But I am God's voice to you.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; That was an echo, wasn't it? Boom. Glory
[52:44] to God. I SAY THAT AGAIN. THE TIME was
[52:48] under inspiration. I felt bad about it
[52:50] the first time, but it repeated it.
[52:52] Amen. I like that revelation. It's the
[52:54] echo of Revelations 18, right? Come out
[52:56] of my people. Come out of heaven. But
[52:57] brother Bram said, "It's the seventh
[52:59] angel on earth that said it." But the
[53:01] heaven so recognized the message on
[53:02] earth that it just echoed it back.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; And here, brother Bram says that I'm
[53:07] God's voice and an echo come right back.
[53:10] But where did the echo come from?
[53:12] &gt;&gt; IT COME OUT OF THE SAME GUY.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Look at this. AMEN. BROTHER RAM IS
[53:18] SAYING, "I FELT bad the first time, but
[53:20] he repeated it."
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Now in anointed ones of the end time,
[53:24] Brother Brandham tells us over and over,
[53:26] but this is a beautiful setting. He
[53:28] said, listen now. HE SAYS, "I WASN'T THE
[53:31] ONE THAT appeared down on the river.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he
[53:34] appeared. I'm not the one that performs
[53:37] things and fortells things and happens
[53:38] as perfectly. I'm only the one that's
[53:40] near when he does it. I was only a voice
[53:43] that he used
[53:45] &gt;&gt; TO SAY IT."
[53:47] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT wasn't what I knew, it's
[53:49] what I surrendered myself to that he
[53:52] spoke through isn't me.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the seventh angel.
[53:57] Yeah,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE MANIFESTATION of the son of
[54:01] man.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THE SEVENTH ANGEL.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; SEE, now to a whole group of people, you
[54:07] just demoted brother Brandham. You just
[54:09] That's real almost blasphemy. It wasn't
[54:11] the seventh angel, did it? Amen. But to
[54:14] another group, Amen. You see, it's a
[54:17] revelation to us that brother Brandon
[54:19] was born to prophet. But a prophet is a
[54:21] channel that another being was using. I
[54:25] RECOGNIZE THE BEING that was using THAT
[54:28] MAN AS THE SAME JESUS THAT WAS IN THIS
[54:31] BIBLE. MATTER OF FACT, ISAIAH WAS THE
[54:33] ONE THAT CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE
[54:35] EARTH AND HE INTRODUCED THIS AGE TO
[54:38] &gt;&gt; OH, WE HAVE SEEN HIM.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE HANDLED HIM. WE HAVE HEARD THE
[54:44] WORDS OF LIFE.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Our eyes have beheld my you. YOU SAY,
[54:49] "PREACHER, what are YOU TALKING ABOUT?"
[54:50] HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN.
[54:54] It wasn't the seventh angel.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No. Come on. Brother Bram's
[54:59] voice wouldn't do to you what this
[55:02] message does to you.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; How in the world?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; How could that man's voice rearrange
[55:11] your entire life?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Just a man. Come on.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Brother
[55:18] Ronnie uh over there in West Virginia.
[55:21] Brother Ronnie. Uh,
[55:23] yeah, man. I'm forgetting names like
[55:25] crazy today. Amen. Brother, Brother
[55:27] Brother Ronnie uh used to go up there
[55:28] and Ron Lily, he used to go up there in
[55:31] Canada and he visited with a group up
[55:32] there and they they got these tapes into
[55:34] the into the library of the prisons and
[55:38] they had a they had a guy who was having
[55:41] serious temper problems and he he went
[55:43] off on this temper fit and and and and
[55:47] somebody had bought him a tape recorder
[55:49] and they put him in confinement and put
[55:51] him in there with a tape and tape
[55:52] recorder, some of the other inmates and
[55:54] they pushed play on the thing and he sat
[55:56] in there and it so mellowled him out
[56:00] &gt;&gt; that they started using it like a
[56:02] prescription for people who were having
[56:04] anger problems in the college or in the
[56:06] prison.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, "PREACHER, WHAT ARE YOU
[56:12] TALKING ABOUT? I'M SAYING THAT THE BIBLE
[56:14] SAID IT WAS THE PRINCE OF PEACE."
[56:17] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN THAT LITTLE TAPE BRING PEACE
[56:20] RIGHT IN THAT HOME IN THE MIDST OF I I
[56:22] KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HOW CAN IT
[56:24] JUST BRING PEACE RIGHT IN THERE? I GOT
[56:26] TO THINKING about this this morning. Me
[56:28] and brother Isaac standing out there. I
[56:29] got to thinking about that when the
[56:31] writers start writing about him and he
[56:33] said, "Oh, he's the prince of peace."
[56:34] And I thought, "I'm glad he didn't stop
[56:36] there.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't just say he's the
[56:39] prince of peace and feel the end of his
[56:42] commitment." But he went on to say he's
[56:44] the mighty God.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE EVERLASTING FATHER.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; I SAY TELL ON PROPHET. AREN'T YOU GLAD
[56:51] BROTHER BRANDON DIDN'T COME TO 54 AND
[56:53] QUIT? OR HE COME TO 56 AND QUIT? AIN'T
[56:56] YOU GLAD THAT HE KEPT PREACHING? AMEN.
[56:59] UNTIL HE TOLD IT ALL, UNTIL WE HAD A
[57:01] MESSAGE BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE IS THE WORD
[57:04] OF HIS POWER.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; He gave us something to agree with.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; WILL PAUL BE JUDGED?
[57:18] OH, THEN I PREACHED WHAT PAUL AND THERE
[57:20] WAS A LOT OF people said.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; We're resting on that. DO YOU SEE IN
[57:25] YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS MESSAGE, YOU'RE
[57:27] NOT AGREEING WITH THE SEVENTH ANGEL.
[57:29] YOU'RE NOT AGREEING WITH JUST THAT MAN,
[57:31] WILLIAM BRANDHAM. YOU'RE AGREEING WITH
[57:33] THE AUTHOR OF THE BIBLE. HALLELUJAH.
[57:37] AMEN. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, THEY'RE
[57:39] GOING TO PLAY MY TAPES BACK. THEY'RE
[57:41] GOING TO PLAY THESE RECORDINGS BACK OVER
[57:43] THERE, MAYBE IN HEAVEN, AND I'LL GET TO
[57:45] HEAR MY OWN VOICE SAY IT JUST LIKE
[57:47] BROTHER RANDOM SAID IT. SOMEBODY SAID,
[57:49] "WELL, BROTHER WAYNE, you aren't say it
[57:51] LIKE HE SAID IT." AMEN. THAT'S OKAY
[57:53] right here. And you know, you didn't get
[57:54] in all these little groups and everybody
[57:56] got this opinion. This family GOT THIS
[57:58] OPINION. SOMEBODY ELSE GOT THIS OPINION.
[58:00] I'M NOT looking right here, folks. I'm
[58:02] not looking down right here. I'm
[58:04] thinking about another day. I'M THINKING
[58:06] ABOUT A day when I stand BEFORE THE LORD
[58:08] AND I COULD HEAR HIM SAY, "THOU HAS DONE
[58:10] WELL, MY GOOD AND MY FAITHFUL SERVANT."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; FAITHFUL TO WHAT? FAITHFUL TO THE
[58:17] SERVICE, TO THE MESSAGE HE GAVE ME.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T HELP WHAT he gave the other
[58:22] ages.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; He gave me this one.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And I know and and I hate it. I I do
[58:33] hate that the message causes separation.
[58:35] I hate it. And some people, bless their
[58:38] hearts, they're so loyal to a church,
[58:40] but they're not faithful to this message
[58:42] at all.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; They're so loyal to a church. They let a
[58:47] pastor, a preacher say anything he wants
[58:49] to, and they'll just dismiss it as as
[58:51] some little something. Listen, I'm
[58:52] sorry, not me.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; We come too far. WE'RE TOO FAR GONE. IF
[58:57] WE START DOING THAT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
[58:59] TO GO BACK IN OUR past and and we're
[59:01] going to HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERY
[59:03] PREACHER AND EVERY SITUATION we walked
[59:05] away from to stay WITH THIS MESSAGE.
[59:07] LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
[59:09] ARE GOING TO DO, BUT AS far as me AND MY
[59:12] HOUSE, WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS
[59:13] MESSAGE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE,
[59:16] FOLKS. WE DIDN'T COME HERE JUST FOR ONE
[59:18] SERVICE. WE'RE GOING BACK IN THE
[59:21] PRESENCE OF THE KING.
[59:24] IT'S THE WORD OF HIS OWN POWER.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; That angel was not the son of man. He
[59:33] was only a messenger
[59:35] &gt;&gt; from the son of man. That son of man is
[59:37] Christ.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Now I clarified my eighth angel spot,
[59:40] didn't I? That that that messenger is
[59:43] Christ. The son of man is Christ.
[59:45] Revelations 10 is Christ.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He's the one that you're feeding on.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man. His words
[59:52] are going to fail you
[59:54] &gt;&gt; feeding on the unfailing body word of
[59:56] the son of man. Do you see that? His
[59:58] words will fail you. Then you get these
[59:59] folks get so locked up in this every
[1:00:02] word brother Bam says thus sayaith the
[1:00:04] Lord. So when a when a preacher comes
[1:00:06] along and tries to preach the revelation
[1:00:08] and stay with the message then folks are
[1:00:10] thinking well he's trying to say every
[1:00:11] word brother Bram said. No that's the
[1:00:13] straw man you created.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's the devil's straw man. That's not
[1:00:17] Wayne Lawson.
[1:00:20] Come on.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Pick that spirit up, didn't I?
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S THE DEVIL'S STRAW, MAN.
[1:00:27] THAT'S NOT ME.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people get they they get other
[1:00:33] preachers in their mind and they try to
[1:00:36] to label me with that.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Keep your labels.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; I'm a message preacher.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; I didn't know nothing when God brought
[1:00:46] me in this message. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE
[1:00:48] OLD TESTAMENT WAS IN THE NEW OR THE OLD.
[1:00:50] I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH THE
[1:00:51] BIBLE. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH
[1:00:53] LIFE. I HAD LIVED 22 YEARS AND WAS A
[1:00:55] WRECK. BUT GOD, RICH IN HIS MERCY,
[1:00:59] OPENED MY HEART TO THIS WORD AND IT'S
[1:01:02] UPHELD ME AND IT TOOK ME FROM MY
[1:01:04] SALVATION AND BROUGHT ME TO WHERE I AM
[1:01:07] TODAY. DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT
[1:01:09] BROTHER BRANDHAM'S MISTAKES. I'M GOING
[1:01:11] TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE ANGEL OF THE
[1:01:13] LORD THAT'S BROUGHT ME THIS FAR. HE KEPT
[1:01:16] ME. HE'S CARRYING ME. HE'S GOING TO KEEP
[1:01:19] CARRYING ME.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; WELL, I FEEL LIKE TAKING A SHOUTING
[1:01:23] SPELL. AMEN. HE'S THE GOD OF MY LIFE.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; AND THIS MESSAGE came from him.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I love it when I'm listening to
[1:01:35] the prophet cuz I know I know who he is
[1:01:37] and I know who he's speaking for.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "When you hear my voice
[1:01:42] speaking, when that inspiration is on, I
[1:01:44] have no more control of that than
[1:01:46] nothing.
[1:01:47] I do not have control of that. It speaks
[1:01:50] itself.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; It's my voice and I'm listening to
[1:01:54] myself talk just as you're listening to
[1:01:57] me talk. Me and Brother Brandham was
[1:02:00] listening to the voice that was coming
[1:02:01] out of him. And we were both holling
[1:02:03] amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE WAS SAYING THINGS HE DIDN'T KNOW.
[1:02:07] HE WAS SAYING THINGS HE DIDN'T
[1:02:09] UNDERSTAND. BUT HE WAS A CHANNEL. HE WAS
[1:02:11] A PROPHET OF GOD. THAT WAS THROUGH THIS
[1:02:14] GENERATION.
[1:02:16] YES.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I stake my life ON IT. I STAKE MY SOUL
[1:02:19] ON IT.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; THERE AIN'T NOTHING ELSE TO FOLLOW in
[1:02:23] this generation.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; He signs. Brother ma'am said, "See,
[1:02:29] [laughter]
[1:02:30] it's not for you to follow me.
[1:02:33] It's are you TO FOLLOW THE LORD JESUS?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will lead you." Now,
[1:02:39] Brother Bam's got some beautiful
[1:02:40] statements. You heard me telling
[1:02:42] something, didn't you? He said, 'Well,
[1:02:44] that was my voice, but I was not
[1:02:46] operating it.
[1:02:49] Amen. Jesus authority on the word.
[1:02:51] Brother man says it like this. You
[1:02:52] believe this is him speaking, not me,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; but he's speaking through here.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Then if that be his voice speaking
[1:03:00] through me, his presence is here.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham described himself
[1:03:05] like a microphone.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; And if I don't speak, this microphone
[1:03:10] don't say nothing.
[1:03:11] And it's got no words of its own. It's
[1:03:13] got no vocabulary of its own. It's only
[1:03:15] magnifying what I put in it.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown was telling you, I'm a
[1:03:21] mute, folks.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; What you're hearing,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; I'm hearing with you.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And some people, they think brother
[1:03:31] Brown was way off because, you know, he
[1:03:32] said the White Horse Rider in 1960, it
[1:03:34] was the was the Christ. Then he comes in
[1:03:36] the seals and says
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; it's the Antichrist.
[1:03:39] And for some reason that discourages
[1:03:41] people.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Well, it was a great encouragement to me
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; cuz here I am believing that
[1:03:47] dispensations are changing.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "These things
[1:03:52] which I'm about to reveal has been
[1:03:53] hidden
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; and no man knows what they ARE." WELL,
[1:03:57] IF BROTHER BRANDON WOULD HAVE KNEW, HOW
[1:03:58] hidden would they have been?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE REALLY HIDDEN
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD SAID, "SEAL IT UP." BUT IN THE
[1:04:06] END TIME, HE SAID, "THE VOICE OF THE
[1:04:09] SEVENTH ANGEL, THESE THINGS WILL BE MADE
[1:04:10] KNOWN, AND THE WORD OF HIS POWER WILL BE
[1:04:13] SPOKEN OUT."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; My goodness, it might have been my
[1:04:17] voice, but it wasn't me speaking.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Now, you if you if you look into this,
[1:04:23] you you you can look at brother
[1:04:25] Brandham. The hour has come. It's some
[1:04:26] beautiful beautiful things. You're you
[1:04:30] you know, can you imagine now? You're
[1:04:31] standing before the prophet. You're
[1:04:33] conscious that something is here, isn't
[1:04:34] you? You're conscious. It's the spirit
[1:04:36] of the Lord. You believe me? Yes, ma'am.
[1:04:39] I'm coming back again now. Oh, yes. You
[1:04:41] have something. It's It's your stomach
[1:04:45] and you have stomach trouble. I see the
[1:04:48] foods and stuff that you can't digest,
[1:04:50] right? Isn't that right? It's something
[1:04:52] like, see, that caused you to have a
[1:04:54] spasm in the stomach, a regurgitation, a
[1:04:56] sour, and your teeth become sensitive
[1:05:00] cuz you have persistent headaches and
[1:05:02] things. Isn't that right? Yes, true,
[1:05:05] sister. Now, that wasn't me talking.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; That was something else talking.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Then he identifies it was the angel of
[1:05:15] the Lord.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Now, let let let's just say, Brother
[1:05:19] Brandon said, "Do you believe me to be a
[1:05:21] prophet? Do you believe me to be a
[1:05:23] prophet?" Now, what watch when he says
[1:05:26] in a greater witness than in John, I
[1:05:27] I'll not read the whole thing. I'll go
[1:05:28] down here. There's a woman is also
[1:05:30] suffering. I see her changing garments
[1:05:33] and she's suffering with something in
[1:05:34] her leg. It's a varicose vein. She's
[1:05:36] rubbing with cramps in her legs. Those
[1:05:38] things are true, aren't they? If they
[1:05:41] are, raise up your hand. Do you believe?
[1:05:44] Now, I do not know what I said to the
[1:05:46] woman. That wasn't me talking. That was
[1:05:49] the angel you see on that picture. Just
[1:05:51] bring that picture up.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; That's the angel you see on that
[1:05:55] picture. A lot of people's really scared
[1:05:57] of that word paracia because people used
[1:05:59] to pronounce it per ruia. And you know,
[1:06:02] I guess if you pronounce it peruia, then
[1:06:04] you preach it like peruia. But if you
[1:06:06] pronounce it paracia, you preach it like
[1:06:08] the Bible.
[1:06:10] [laughter]
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; They said it wrong and preached it
[1:06:13] wrong.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; We're going to say it right and preach
[1:06:17] it right.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; The word paracia is strictly a Greek
[1:06:21] word in the Bible. It means revealing or
[1:06:24] coming.
[1:06:25] Come on, church.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; You know what the real meaning is? One
[1:06:29] alongside of.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; There's one alongside of. IN OTHER
[1:06:33] WORDS, THERE'S TWO of them.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, JOSHUA AND MOSES, YOU SAW IT. JOHN
[1:06:38] AND JESUS, YOU SAW IT. BUT HERE, IT'S A
[1:06:41] SUPERNATURAL BEING.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And brother BAM SAID, "WHEN YOU HEARD ME
[1:06:45] SPEAKING, IT WASN'T ME. It was that
[1:06:47] angel of the Lord speaking."
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Now, that pillar of fire is the one
[1:06:52] Paul's talking about here in the
[1:06:53] Hebrews. Yes.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Because he takes it to creation, takes
[1:06:57] it to Moses, and then takes it in his
[1:06:59] meeting with him. And he Paul Paul asked
[1:07:02] this light what its name was.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Got it in the Bible.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, who are you? So he told us it was
[1:07:08] Jehovah. He knew that,
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; but he didn't know the name of the Lord.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, I am Jesus.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; That light is the angel of the covenant.
[1:07:18] See, now watch Brother Brandham. He'll
[1:07:20] go over. He'll go over it and he'll say
[1:07:22] it here like this in living uh in the
[1:07:24] living Christ. Now, if you be reverent,
[1:07:26] how do you do, sister? Believe with all
[1:07:28] your heart. The son of God is risen from
[1:07:30] the dead. He's revealing in this line of
[1:07:32] divine healing, the mercies of his
[1:07:33] resurrection. Do you believe him with
[1:07:35] all your heart? Something very strange
[1:07:37] about you, lady. You look like somebody
[1:07:39] I know or something. Your features are
[1:07:41] disturbing me a little. I want to watch
[1:07:43] this. And as Elijah said, "Look, if it
[1:07:46] wasn't that I respected the presence of
[1:07:47] Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at
[1:07:49] you." And Peter and John said, "Look on
[1:07:52] us." In other words, not to look to them
[1:07:55] as healers, but look on us. We've got
[1:07:58] something to say to you.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Why are we looking that way?
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Because he had something to say to us.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; This woman is looking at a prophet. HE
[1:08:12] HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER. And look
[1:08:14] what he says. You've just been operated
[1:08:16] on.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; You've had an operation. And that tumor
[1:08:19] operation, they removed a tumor and that
[1:08:22] was on the bladder. And do something.
[1:08:24] They put some kind of treatment in you
[1:08:26] to see if something else was wrong. And
[1:08:28] that treatment was in a thing that
[1:08:30] dissolved and went out and they now
[1:08:33] think it's a malignancy. Your niece, I
[1:08:35] see, standing there. I haven't seen her
[1:08:38] in the meeting, but I know see I see her
[1:08:40] standing by your side smiling and these
[1:08:43] things are so whatsoever I told you it's
[1:08:45] the absolute truth. Now that wasn't me
[1:08:47] talking to you lady. That was my VOICE
[1:08:51] BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE TALKING. Do
[1:08:53] you believe it was the Lord Jesus
[1:08:55] Christ?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it was the Lord JESUS
[1:09:02] CHRIST? NOW THIS PICTURE SHOWS YOU TWO
[1:09:04] BEINGS. It shows you a human being.
[1:09:06] Shows you a supernatural being. But it
[1:09:08] was brother Ram WAS TELLING YOU THAT
[1:09:10] pillar of fire is using my voice to
[1:09:12] speak to you.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; It's pretty powerful, folks. In 1953,
[1:09:18] watch Brother Bam says it like this.
[1:09:20] Everyone believe now with all your
[1:09:21] heart. Do you believe? We're strangers.
[1:09:23] We're perfect strangers. I don't know
[1:09:26] you, but if if there would be anything
[1:09:29] in your life and us strangers, it'd have
[1:09:32] to come from a supernatural resource.
[1:09:34] Isn't that right? You're aware that
[1:09:36] you're standing near something. Now
[1:09:38] watch it. She knew she was standing next
[1:09:41] to brother Brandt.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "But you're aware you're
[1:09:45] standing near something more than your
[1:09:48] brother."
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's his presence.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Did you ever see that picture they took
[1:09:54] of him? You've seen it. Well, that's
[1:09:58] what you're aware of. That's so close.
[1:10:00] Now,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; do you believe me to be his prophet?
[1:10:03] You're very upset, aren't you? Your
[1:10:05] doctor recently gave you an X-ray
[1:10:07] picture and you're afraid of cancer,
[1:10:09] aren't you? See, but it's down in your
[1:10:12] bowels. See, it's a tumor. They said a
[1:10:14] tumor. You was afraid it was cancerous,
[1:10:16] but it is in the boughels. Isn't that
[1:10:19] right? It's the truth. That's the truth.
[1:10:20] Raise your hand. You know, lady, I never
[1:10:23] seen you in my life. That wasn't me
[1:10:25] talking. You might have heard my voice.
[1:10:28] THAT WAS HIM TALKING. WELL, THEN IF HE'S
[1:10:30] THAT CLOSE TO YOU NOW, won't you accept
[1:10:32] him?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT HE DONE. HE SHOWED YOU YOU'RE
[1:10:36] FEELING SOMETHING THAT AIN'T your
[1:10:37] brother and you're hearing something
[1:10:39] that ain't your brother. You're in HIS
[1:10:41] PRESENCE.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; SO, GO AHEAD AND ACCEPT HIM WHILE YOU'RE
[1:10:45] IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; OH, I'LL TELL you this. I'M GLAD THAT
[1:10:48] GOD GAVE US THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE THIS
[1:10:51] MESSAGE IS NOT SOMETHING that's coming
[1:10:52] just from a man. It's coming from the
[1:10:55] one that created the heavens and the
[1:10:56] earth. COME ON NOW. AND HE'S COMING TO
[1:10:59] THIS AGE FOR ANOTHER CREATION, FOR THE
[1:11:01] CREATION OF HIS BRIDE. AND HE HAS A
[1:11:04] WORD. He has a word that is different
[1:11:06] than what brother Brandham thought. He
[1:11:08] has a word that was different than some
[1:11:09] of the Baptists thought. He has a word.
[1:11:11] He has a message. Now, in the rising of
[1:11:14] the sun, you can take that down. In the
[1:11:15] rising of the sun, what's the prophet
[1:11:17] say it here? HE SAYS, "AS CHRIST WAS THE
[1:11:20] FIRST ONE TO raise from all of the
[1:11:21] prophets that slept in many places, he
[1:11:24] was the first fruits of those that
[1:11:25] slept. And in the bride coming of
[1:11:27] Christ.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Now you got to watch how you put those
[1:11:30] uh commas and all that the punctuation
[1:11:32] because it really means the bride coming
[1:11:34] of Christ.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride coming of Christ coming
[1:11:38] out of the church. There will have to be
[1:11:40] a sheath waved again in the last days.
[1:11:42] Now waving of that sheath. What was that
[1:11:44] sheath? The first one to come to mature.
[1:11:46] The first one to proved it was a wheat.
[1:11:49] Now I'm sure you see what I'm talking
[1:11:51] about. It was waved over the people.
[1:11:54] Now, what was William Brandham waving
[1:11:56] over those people by saying, "It's not
[1:11:59] my voice.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; That's not me." That's that angel of the
[1:12:03] Lord. That's that pillar of the fire.
[1:12:05] What was he waving over those people? He
[1:12:08] was waving to them. The son of man has
[1:12:11] come to fulfill his word in this
[1:12:13] generation. NOW, WATCH THIS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:16] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about.
[1:12:18] For the first time, there will come
[1:12:20] forth for the bride age, a resurrection
[1:12:23] out of dark denominationalism.
[1:12:26] IT'LL BE A MESSAGE THAT THE FULL
[1:12:28] MATURITY of the word has turned back
[1:12:31] into full power.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHAT THE BRIDE'S GOING TO
[1:12:35] HAVE A MESSAGE AND THIS MESSAGE WILL BE?
[1:12:37] THE WORD HAS RETURNED TO ITS FULL POWER.
[1:12:41] WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT this morning,
[1:12:43] then it it's a beautiful thing to THINK
[1:12:45] BECAUSE NOW WHAT you're what you're
[1:12:46] hearing is it's not the power of the
[1:12:49] word.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Look, I've heard some powerful sermons
[1:12:53] by people don't even preach truth.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; They say powerful words.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; You you've heard you've heard atheists
[1:13:01] say powerful words.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; You you I mean, when I was in the world,
[1:13:05] country music stars could sing powerful
[1:13:07] words. They could move you emotionally.
[1:13:09] had nothing to do with God.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Powerful words.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; But there's a different in the word of
[1:13:14] his power.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM HIM. YOU SEE,
[1:13:19] THEN IF YOU CAN PICK UP THE SAME WORD he
[1:13:22] brought to you NOW. IT'S NOT ME SAYING
[1:13:25] IT.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S NOT ME. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT YOU
[1:13:29] GOING AROUND AND SAYING, "WELL, THE
[1:13:30] SCRIPTURE means this and the SCRIPTURE
[1:13:32] MEANS THIS." YOU'RE NOW USING the word
[1:13:35] of his power.
[1:13:37] DO YOU SEE A PROPHET HAS BROUGHT A
[1:13:39] MESSAGE to the believer? And in
[1:13:41] agreement with that message, we're
[1:13:43] standing here this morning WITH THE WORD
[1:13:45] OF THAT power coming through the church.
[1:13:47] WHAT POWER? THE SAME POWER.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; THE POWER that created the heavens and
[1:13:51] earth have come right here into this age
[1:13:54] into the men and women that's got the
[1:13:55] Holy Ghost.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And you're sitting right here this
[1:13:59] morning. You say, "Brother Wayne, I
[1:14:00] crave the power of God." How many craves
[1:14:02] the power of God?
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I crave the power of God. Brother
[1:14:05] Brandham said, "If you are CRAVING THE
[1:14:07] POWER OF GOD, THEN THERE IS A POWER OF
[1:14:09] GOD SOMEWHERE TO MEET IT."
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:14:13] POWER. AS LONG AS THE HUMAN BEINGS are
[1:14:16] searching and hungering AND CALLING FOR
[1:14:18] THE POWER OF GOD, THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:14:20] POWER SOMEWHERE TO RESPOND TO IT. IF
[1:14:23] WE'RE HUNGRY FOR IT, IF WE'RE CALLING
[1:14:25] FOR IT, IF WE'RE ASKING FOR IT, GOD IS
[1:14:28] HERE THIS MORNING TO RESPOND TO THAT to
[1:14:32] give you the power, amen, that has been
[1:14:34] released in this word. This message is
[1:14:36] the most powerful force that's ever been
[1:14:38] put on the earth.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, you you we we talk about
[1:14:41] Pentecost. We say, "WELL, THIS HAPPENED
[1:14:43] on the day of Pentecost, and there was
[1:14:45] there was 120 in the upper room, and
[1:14:47] hey, listen, that that's wonderful,
[1:14:48] brother." Amen. And then 3,000 were
[1:14:51] saved right after that. Oh, that's a
[1:14:52] beautiful story. BUT WHAT ABOUT DURBAN,
[1:14:55] SOUTH AFRICA?
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; AND IF THE PENTECOSTALS WASN'T SO UH IF
[1:14:59] THEY WASN'T SO BEAT DOWN BY THE
[1:15:01] DENOMINATIONS, MOST OF THOSE PENTECOSTAL
[1:15:03] BROTHERS WOULD START EVERY SERVICE BY
[1:15:05] TELLING YOU THAT 30,000 PEOPLE GAVE
[1:15:08] THEIR LIFE TO JESUS in one altar CALL IN
[1:15:11] DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA. 10 times the POWER
[1:15:14] OF PENTECOST HAS VISITED THIS
[1:15:16] GENERATION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK BACK
[1:15:18] TO ACTS 2 TO FIND THE POWER OF GOD. THE
[1:15:21] POWER OF GOD HAS COME UNTO US. IT HAS
[1:15:24] COME UNTO US BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:15:27] HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT going to WATER IT
[1:15:29] DOWN. I'M NOT GOING TO WATER THIS
[1:15:31] MESSAGE DOWN TO JUST A LITTLE TEACHING
[1:15:33] OR JUST A LITTLE IDEA. IT IS THE POWER
[1:15:36] OF GOD UNDER SALVATION. IT IS THE POWER
[1:15:39] OF CHANGE. IT IS THE POWER OF ADOPTION.
[1:15:42] IT IS THE POWER OF LIFE. IT'LL DO
[1:15:44] SOMETHING for you there ain't nothing
[1:15:46] else going to do for you. Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; If the power of the devil could take a
[1:15:51] hold of a man and make him 10 times more
[1:15:53] powerful, what would happen if you
[1:15:55] surrender to God?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I need a witness.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I need a witness of the power of God
[1:16:01] this MORNING. I NEED A WITNESS THIS
[1:16:03] MORNING. SOMEBODY THAT COULD SAY,
[1:16:05] "BROTHER WAYNE, I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE
[1:16:07] power of God."
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; If you're hungering for the power of
[1:16:11] God, I want you to look around this
[1:16:12] room. I I'M HUNGRY FOR THE POWER OF GOD.
[1:16:15] I'VE EXPERIENCED THE POWER OF GOD.
[1:16:17] LISTEN, I KNOW some of you sitting here,
[1:16:18] we're getting ready to go to camp and I
[1:16:20] know your heart is overflowing right now
[1:16:22] cuz some of you never even knew about
[1:16:23] the power of God until you visited that
[1:16:26] little camp meeting over there. Amen. I
[1:16:27] I was talking to somebody the other day
[1:16:29] and they told me said, "Brother Wayne, I
[1:16:31] come down there and I didn't know what
[1:16:32] to expect, but I had to go through that
[1:16:33] prayer line cuz I seen all them people
[1:16:35] getting under that anointing." He said,
[1:16:37] "I walked in and they carried me out."
[1:16:39] Amen. He said, "I don't know what
[1:16:40] happened, but I ain't never been the
[1:16:41] same." Amen. CUZ IT WAS THE power of
[1:16:43] God. COME ON. THERE'S SOME OF YOU
[1:16:45] RECEIVE THINGS, AMEN, THAT YOU CAN NEVER
[1:16:48] BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. BROTHER KYLE, IS
[1:16:50] IT TRUE? IS IT TRUE THE POWER OF GOD IN
[1:16:53] COMING INTO A CHRISTIAN'S LIFE, SOMEBODY
[1:16:55] THAT'S ALREADY BORN AGAIN? BUT THE POWER
[1:16:59] OF [screaming] GOD IS MORE THAN JUST
[1:17:01] BEING BORN AGAIN. IT IS THE ADOPTION OF
[1:17:03] THE CHURCH TO TAKE YOU BACK TO
[1:17:06] EVERYTHING THAT YOU LOST. AUTHORITY.
[1:17:09] SPOKEN WORD AUTHORITY.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:14] OH, there's a Goliath in the land. I
[1:17:16] know. I know there's a Goliath in the
[1:17:18] land that we live in today.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Well, if God still heals, then you know,
[1:17:23] heal somebody.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; That's the same exact voice.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And on the day of judgment,
[1:17:32] God's going to hear that voice agreeing
[1:17:34] with the voice of them Pharisees that
[1:17:36] said, "Jesus,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; if you can't even save yourself, come
[1:17:39] off the cross.
[1:17:42] Let me see you do a miracle.
[1:17:44] [clears throat]
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's the same spirit.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Let me let me see you do a miracle.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, if that third pull's for the bride,
[1:17:50] let me see you create a squirrel. God
[1:17:52] didn't commit all of us to create
[1:17:53] squirrels.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T CREATE US ALL. BROTHER SAID
[1:17:59] SOME OF YOU ARE MOSES. HE SAID MOSES WAS
[1:18:01] DONE the miracle AND THERE WAS BELIEVERS
[1:18:02] TO follow the MIRACLE
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AND NOT EVERYBODY'S A MOSES.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IF GOD COMMITTED YOU JUST TO
[1:18:08] FOLLOW THE MESSAGE?
[1:18:11] COME ON, CHURCH. WHAT GOOD IS THE THIRD
[1:18:13] PULL IF THERE'S NO FOLLOWERS?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THE THIRD PULL COME TO CREATE
[1:18:18] FOLLOWERS. PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED THE
[1:18:20] PILLAR OF FIRE. THAT'S IN THE BOOK OF
[1:18:22] MATTHEW, THE MAGI THAT FOLLOWED THE
[1:18:23] STAR. COME ON, CHURCH. WHY WAS THEY IN
[1:18:26] THE BIBLE? BROTHER BRAM SAID to have a
[1:18:27] type of people who followed a
[1:18:29] supernatural light.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said, "AND WHEN JEHOVAH
[1:18:32] GOD, THAT GREAT ANGEL COME OUT of the
[1:18:34] heavens and and created a star, they
[1:18:36] followed it.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Well, now we got this Goliath and and
[1:18:43] you know it's easy when when when
[1:18:45] troubles are up and things are
[1:18:46] happening. That's when Goliath really
[1:18:48] comes out. That's when brother Ram said
[1:18:49] when the odds are against you when when
[1:18:51] when the chips are down.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; When you've been sick a couple years,
[1:18:55] you know, you ain't never getting over
[1:18:57] this.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; There's your Goliath.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got cancer and they just keep
[1:19:03] suffering and suffering. So, well, see
[1:19:04] there, God don't heal cancer no more.
[1:19:07] Oh, here's your one.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I knew a guy claimed
[1:19:11] his healing and he died.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I know a bunch of people that took
[1:19:16] chemo and died.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Now, there's been a lot more die under
[1:19:23] medical care
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; and you still going to the doctor.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; I'm [clears throat] not against the
[1:19:30] doctor. Just don't be against divine
[1:19:31] healing.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, brother Bam said it like
[1:19:37] this. He said, "And when you allow the
[1:19:40] channel of memory to be your access,
[1:19:42] you'll never get your healing in that
[1:19:44] channel."
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because in the channel of
[1:19:46] memory, you know, somebody claimed their
[1:19:48] healing and didn't get it." He said,
[1:19:50] "So, you got to go over that memory to
[1:19:52] get to your healing." He said, "But if
[1:19:54] you'll bypass all those channels, and
[1:19:57] you'll go straight to the word of God,
[1:19:59] it's the word of power. It's the word OF
[1:20:01] HEALING. IT'S HOW YOU GET YOUR HEALING.
[1:20:04] IT'S HOW YOU OVERCOME YOUR GOLIATH.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it. I love how Brother
[1:20:09] Bram says things. He said, "I'm a
[1:20:11] witness of the power of God." You see,
[1:20:13] oh David run up there. It's come out of
[1:20:15] the message witness 53. He said, "You
[1:20:17] see old David run up there and they got
[1:20:18] this Goliath and David runs up in the
[1:20:20] middle of him says, "I'm a witness of
[1:20:21] the power of God."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Little shrutddy kid
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; ain't even got his ain't even got his
[1:20:28] license to carry spear. No CCW, nothing.
[1:20:33] He He can't can't carry a gun.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And he walks up in the middle of the
[1:20:38] crowd
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm a witness of the power of
[1:20:41] God.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; WHO WHO IS THIS UNCIRCUMCISED
[1:20:44] PHILISTINE?" AMEN. That that that's out
[1:20:46] here bragging like this.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS JUST A KID,
[1:20:52] there's a bear come in. I killed it.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; I'M A WITNESS
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; THAT A LION COME in to get one of
[1:20:58] father's sheep AND AND AND AND I SLAYED
[1:21:00] THAT LION. I'M A WITNESS. YEAH.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU THIS, IF HE'LL KILL A
[1:21:05] BEAR and a lion over a LITTLE SHEEP,
[1:21:07] WHAT'S GOD GOING TO DO TO THIS GOLIATH
[1:21:09] over his children?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHEN DAVID TOLD HIM, "I'M NOT
[1:21:13] JUST A WITNESS, BUT I'M ABOUT TO MAKE
[1:21:15] YOU A WITNESS.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I'M ABOUT TO LET YOU SEE." AMEN. THAT IF
[1:21:19] YOU'LL JUST LET GOD BE GOD, HE'S STILL
[1:21:22] GOD.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER WHEN I first got saved,
[1:21:25] Brother Levi, I wanted to believe that
[1:21:26] God still did miracles. And I still
[1:21:28] wanted to believe that God healed. I
[1:21:30] want to believe God was everything that
[1:21:31] he'd ever been. And there was all kinds
[1:21:33] of people had all kinds of things to
[1:21:34] say. But one day I found out that the
[1:21:37] Jesus that did it in the Bible, Amen. He
[1:21:39] didn't stay in the tomb. But on the
[1:21:41] third day, he rose. Amen. And he's right
[1:21:44] HERE THIS MORNING. AND HE'S JUST AS MUCH
[1:21:46] GOD THIS MORNING AS HE WAS BACK THERE IN
[1:21:48] THE BIBLE. AND WHEN HIS WORD COMES TO
[1:21:51] YOU, IT IS THE POWER OF GOD THAT IS
[1:21:54] COMING TO YOU.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you what he done. He whipped that
[1:21:57] Goliath. And you've whipped yours, too.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You can whip that Goliath of your life
[1:22:02] this morning. Do you know that them
[1:22:03] people, let me encourage you, you can
[1:22:05] whip that Goliath that says you've been

[1:23:23] noisy religion.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Job, where were you when the foundations
[1:23:27] were planted and THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED
[1:23:29] FOR JOY? THE RELIGION OF A TRUE
[1:23:31] CHRISTIAN IS A NOISY RELIGION.

[1:23:39] THIS NEW BODY, BROTHER. AMEN. YOU THINK

[1:23:44] HERE. YOU WAIT TILL I GET A NEW BODY AND

[1:24:03] GOD FOR this word.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; OH, THEY'RE TOO NOISY. OH, BROTHER
[1:24:09] BRANDHAM. AMEN. BROTHER BRANDON, they're
[1:24:10] too noisy. He said, "It's not them
[1:24:12] shouting. IT'S THE POWER OF God moving
[1:24:15] through them.
[1:24:17] WOO.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ME SHOUTING. IT'S THE POWER OF
[1:24:20] GOD MOVING THROUGH YOU. THE POWER THAT
[1:24:22] SAVED YOU IS THE POWER MOVING THROUGH
[1:24:24] YOU WHEN YOU SAY HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO
[1:24:27] GOD. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:24:30] HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? IT'S COMING FROM
[1:24:33] another world. And when IT SWEEPS DOWN
[1:24:35] IN THE CHURCH, OH, I say, let that
[1:24:38] chariot sweep through the church of the
[1:24:40] living God.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Just as I was getting in the car this
[1:24:44] morning. Amen. in a scripture I ain't
[1:24:46] heard in years. It come right up in my
[1:24:49] ear. He said, "I withholdeth no good
[1:24:51] thing from them that are good or right
[1:24:53] from the upright. I holdeth no good
[1:24:55] thing. I withhold no good thing." I
[1:24:58] thought, "Lord, what does that mean?"
[1:24:59] Amen. DO YOU KNOW THIS GOSPEL IS good
[1:25:01] news? Do you know it's THE GOOD NEWS
[1:25:03] YOU'RE SAVED? DO YOU KNOW IT'S THE GOOD
[1:25:05] NEWS YOU'RE FILLED? IT'S THE GOOD NEWS
[1:25:07] HE'S ALIVE. IT'S THE GOOD NEWS HE WALKS
[1:25:09] AMONG YOU. AMEN. DON'T WITHHOLD THE GOOD
[1:25:11] THINGS. COME ON. WE DON'T WANT TO GET SO
[1:25:14] INTELLECTUAL THAT WE WITHHOLD THE GOOD
[1:25:16] THINGS FROM GOD'S CHILDREN. GIVE THEM
[1:25:18] THE GOOD THINGS, THE POWER OF GOD, AND
[1:25:20] THE REALITIES OF GOD. I certainly
[1:25:23] believe this morning. I believe it. I
[1:25:25] believe people get so messed up in their
[1:25:27] traditions until they withhold the
[1:25:30] things of God. They withhold the moving
[1:25:32] OF THE HOLY GHOST. THEY withhold the
[1:25:34] shouting and rejoicing and the dancing
[1:25:37] in the spirit. Well, listen. AMEN. YOU
[1:25:39] MIGHT BE OLD. AMEN. AND YOU MIGHT BE
[1:25:41] TIRED. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A GENERATION,
[1:25:43] AMEN, THAT'S READY TO WORSHIP GOD. THEY
[1:25:45] WANT TO SERVE GOD. I'M 52 AND I ain't
[1:25:48] old and tired. I tell you what I WANT IS
[1:25:50] AN OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST FILILLED
[1:25:53] REVIVAL THAT'LL CHANGE HEARTS, CHANGE
[1:25:55] LIVES.
[1:25:57] [cheering]
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I'm in the message. I'm in THE MESSAGE.
[1:26:01] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "AMEN. What is
[1:26:02] it?" HE SAID, "THEY HAVE A form of
[1:26:04] religion, but they deny the power
[1:26:06] thereof. It's the resurrection of JESUS
[1:26:10] CHRIST THAT PRESENTS HIM TO YOU TONIGHT.
[1:26:12] WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE power of God to
[1:26:15] change a man. That's right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POWER OF GOD TO CHANGE A LIFE.
[1:26:19] LISTEN, SOME OF YOU MAYBE got the Holy
[1:26:21] Ghost and you said, "Well, we're just
[1:26:22] cruising now." Amen. But you know, you
[1:26:24] got habits that you need to get rid of.
[1:26:26] Do you know the word of his power will
[1:26:28] change that? DO YOU KNOW GETTING in a
[1:26:30] good meeting somewhere WILL CHANGE THAT?
[1:26:32] YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME MARRIAGE
[1:26:33] SITUATIONS IN THIS BUILDING right now
[1:26:35] that if you would GET IN A GOOD
[1:26:36] OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST MEETING AND GET
[1:26:38] A REFILLING OF THE HOLY GHOST, IT WOULD
[1:26:41] CHANGE YOUR MARRIAGE. IT WILL CHANGE
[1:26:43] YOUR CHURCH. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR FAMILY.
[1:26:45] IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING BECAUSE THE
[1:26:47] POWER OF GOD IS WHAT WILL CHANGE IT.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; AH, it'll make a sunny day in the middle
[1:26:55] of your clouds.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Don't withhold a good thing. Ain't you
[1:27:01] glad? Ain't you glad Malachi didn't quit
[1:27:03] writing when he said, "Unto them that
[1:27:05] fear my name." Ain't you glad he didn't
[1:27:07] stop right there? Ain't you glad he went
[1:27:09] on to say, "Don't withhold it, Malachi.
[1:27:11] Don't withhold the good thing unto them
[1:27:13] that fear my name." Keep writing,
[1:27:14] brother. He said, "The son of
[1:27:16] righteousness shall arise with healings
[1:27:18] IN HIS WINGS. BEHOLD, I SEND UNTO YOU
[1:27:21] ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE GREAT AND
[1:27:24] DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD. MY GOD DID NOT
[1:27:26] WITHHOLD THE GOOD THINGS."
[1:27:29] He spoke the word of his power.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And that word coming to the church.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Lord said, "Preacher, what in the
[1:27:39] world?"
[1:27:41] The word of his power is where you get a
[1:27:43] new beginning this morning.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; How many like start over?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; How many like a like a new start?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Would you a new start? And
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; don't get hung up on my old and tired
[1:28:06] statement. That's some young people,
[1:28:08] too. So,
[1:28:11] you ever heard they're old in their
[1:28:12] spirit, you know,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; they stay home, don't get out, don't go
[1:28:15] nowhere, don't have no friends, don't
[1:28:16] nothing. You know,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; they're tired. They're old and tired.
[1:28:20] Even young people.
[1:28:25] But wouldn't it be something
[1:28:28] if the Holy Spirit that wrote this Bible
[1:28:30] that created the heavens and earth come
[1:28:32] in this building right now
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and start you over.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Preacher, what are you really
[1:28:40] discussing? I'm discussing the things
[1:28:41] that people have said to you and about
[1:28:44] you.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I'm discussing the things that you carry
[1:28:47] in your spirit daily
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; because of some little criticism.
[1:28:51] Somebody made fun of the way you dressed
[1:28:52] or they made fun of you because you
[1:28:54] quoted brother Brandham or you was one
[1:28:55] of them faith people.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You know, you went down there, you go
[1:28:59] over, oh, you go you you go over there
[1:29:02] where they shout and holler and stuff,
[1:29:05] you know. Oh, you go over there with the
[1:29:06] believe the prophet. And you see, every
[1:29:08] word of criticism that you take into you
[1:29:10] is just like latching you spiritually
[1:29:13] and just just comes to bind your spirit
[1:29:15] to hold you. Listen, I don't care what
[1:29:17] anybody says.
[1:29:20] I got a place to dump it off.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; I got a place to just come along and
[1:29:24] say, "Look, look, devil. I've heard all
[1:29:26] of you I want to hear.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; I've heard all of you I want to hear."
[1:29:33] He'll send somebody. Well, I tell you
[1:29:35] what, y'all keep that shouting up. Y'all
[1:29:37] just going to turn into a bunch of
[1:29:38] fanatics. Well, fanatic to who?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Fanatic to who?
[1:29:47] It's kind of like somebody said, "Well,
[1:29:49] we believe." Brother B said, "Who's we?"
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You and who?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Not you in the Bible.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; I tell y'all, y'all just fanatic. I'll
[1:29:58] tell you what I preached. I preached in
[1:30:00] Africa, Nathan.
[1:30:02] And about the third time that lady run
[1:30:04] up the middle of the aisle shouting and
[1:30:05] hollering, blowing the whistles like we
[1:30:07] at the soccer game, I said, "Well, we
[1:30:08] laidback people back this day.
[1:30:12] [laughter]
[1:30:15] Man, I was praying for myself and her
[1:30:17] cuz I was hoping she'd choke on it one
[1:30:18] time and I was like [laughter]
[1:30:21] I say that
[1:30:25] we would have prayed for HER [laughter]
[1:30:31] fanatical to who?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH TO WHO?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Not to the person THAT'S UNDER THE
[1:30:39] FOUNTAIN. NOT TO THAT PERSON THAT'S BEEN
[1:30:41] FIGHTING DEVILS FOR A WHOLE YEAR AND THE
[1:30:44] ANOINTING GETS ON THEM AND THEY FEEL
[1:30:45] LIGHT ENOUGH.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; THEY FEEL ENOUGH LIKE DANC.
[1:30:50] AMEN. IT'S NOT FANATICAL TO THAT GUY.
[1:30:52] IT'S NOT FANATICAL TO THAT [cheering]
[1:30:54] GIRL THAT'S BEEN UNDER THAT ANXIETY AND
[1:30:56] NERVOUSNESS AND SHE PRAYS UNTIL TONGUES
[1:30:59] START COMING OUT AND SHE STARTS LIFTING
[1:31:02] HER [cheering] HANDS AND SHE STARTS
[1:31:03] SPEAKING IN OTHER TONGUES TO HER. OH,
[1:31:06] IT'S NOT TOO FANATICAL. IT'S THE BEST
[1:31:08] DAY OF OUR LIFE. [cheering]
[1:31:09] LET ME TELL YOU, I BELIEVE IN A
[1:31:11] FANATICAL RELIGION THAT SAVES HEARTS,
[1:31:14] THAT CHANGES LIVES, THAT GIVES HEALING
[1:31:17] AND POWER TO THE BELIEVER. YOU
[1:31:19] [cheering] BRING ME A FANATIC IF YOU
[1:31:21] WANT TO, BROTHER. THIS FANATIC IS GOING
[1:31:23] TO GO TO HEAVEN ONE MORNING. I'M GOING
[1:31:25] TO BREAK FROM ONE DIMENSION TO ANOTHER.
[1:31:28] AND WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN, AMEN. It'll be
[1:31:30] fanatical there for sure.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You're all standing. Stand with me.
[1:31:38] It'll be fanatical for sure.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come. It'll be
[1:31:42] fanatical, folks.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; At least to somebody.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; It struck me one day. I was preaching a
[1:31:55] certain part of the message. Seemed like
[1:31:56] nobody wanted to preach and I was
[1:31:58] preaching right along. Had some guys
[1:32:01] start, well, Brother Wayne's wrong on
[1:32:02] this. Brother Wayne's wrong on this. So,
[1:32:04] I went back to the message and I
[1:32:05] listened to Brother Ram real careful.
[1:32:09] And I took what he said and said it just
[1:32:10] like he said it. And they said, "You're
[1:32:13] wrong on that." And then I realized I
[1:32:15] can't preach what Brother Ram said and
[1:32:17] be right by them.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to have to quit wearing
[1:32:22] what they think
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; and say what he said.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Do you see what you got to come to?
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; The word of his power. Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; If you come under that word, you're
[1:32:34] agreeing
[1:32:36] not with William Brandom.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You're agreeing with the one that was
[1:32:40] talking through him.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe there's a I
[1:32:46] believe there's another being behind
[1:32:48] this message.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; We've announced it many times to you.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is not here this
[1:32:57] morning,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; but the one that used him
[1:33:01] the Almighty,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; the one that spoke through him.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; The counselor,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; the prince of peace,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; the mighty God.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; How far will he be from me, brother
[1:33:17] Matt? How far will he be? Arm reach or
[1:33:19] will it be up in the heavens or? He
[1:33:21] said, "I'll be above you."
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I'll be with you."
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, but there's coming a time
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; that I'll be with you even
[1:33:33] Amen.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; How far is the power from you right now?
[1:33:36] Then
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; how far is the power from you right now?
[1:33:41] How much the power the power of God? How
[1:33:43] far is it from you?
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use the Bible on you.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; My Bible said he was asleep in the ship.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; And Brother Brham said it just like
[1:33:54] this. He said, "And you're a mud ship,
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; and he's asleep in you right now,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; and the one that saved you is resting
[1:34:04] there."
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The one that heals the
[1:34:06] sick is resting there."
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "But if you just wake him up,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; he could speak the word of his power
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; and your storms would settle right now,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; things would change." Listen, he's he's
[1:34:21] an ontime God, folks.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; He's an ontime God. He's
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He's come. Y'all y'all forgive me for my
[1:34:27] length this morning. There's something
[1:34:29] on my heart.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; I want to I I I know I preached four in
[1:34:35] a row lately, and y'all forgive me for
[1:34:36] that. I I don't want to seem like a hog,
[1:34:38] but there's something on my heart. I
[1:34:39] tell you what I'm doing. I want to get
[1:34:41] my words
[1:34:43] in with the words of a prophet.
[1:34:46] And I want to get your words. I want to
[1:34:48] get your conscience. I want to get your
[1:34:50] belief systems. I want to get what you
[1:34:51] think. I want to get it in line with
[1:34:53] that prophet
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; because it's more than William Brandom.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Don't, brother Adam, don't you want when
[1:35:03] you get there if if perhaps they pull a
[1:35:06] tape of your life out and they they play
[1:35:08] your speech
[1:35:11] when they push it, don't don't you want
[1:35:13] to hear the voice on that tape before
[1:35:15] the whole saints of God? Don't you want
[1:35:17] to hear it say what you heard brother
[1:35:19] Brim say? And then you're standing there
[1:35:22] because that's already been accepted.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; What an opportunity to love him this
[1:35:30] morning.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; What an opportunity to serve him.
[1:35:32] Brother Ben, you got something?
[1:35:34] Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] [music] Hallelujah.

[1:37:11] healed.

[1:37:15] is awome
[1:37:17] today. I am forgiving.
