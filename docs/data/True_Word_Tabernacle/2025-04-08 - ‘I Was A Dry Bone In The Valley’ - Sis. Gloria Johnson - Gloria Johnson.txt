TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I was a dry bone in the valley. [Music] When Jesus found me, a dry bone in the valley when he put flesh upon me, said, "Son of a man, Can these dry bones live? And I answered, oh Lord, thou knowest. [Music] You have given us prophetic eyes so we won't believe Satan's lies. And although this world thinks us absurd, we will keep on holding to your word. Said, son of a man, can these dry bones live? And I answer, oh Lord, thou knowest, son of man, said, son of [Music] man, can these dry bones live? And I answer, oh Lord, thou knowest. We are the flowers and you are life's essence. May, oh Lord, you have the preeminence. For that's the reason why you made us to achieve your greatest purpose. [Music] said, "Son of a [Applause] man, can these dry bones live and I hurt?" Oh [Applause] Lord, thou knowest. Son of man, said son of man, car is the stri to live and I hurt. Oh Lord, thou knowest. [Music] Now I stand justified and I do appreciate the outpouring of your wonderful grace. Yes, I'm sanified from the bondage of sin. As your holy spirit now dwells within. I am no longer a dry bone in the [Music] valley since Jesus has set me free. [Music] And now I'm growing in his grace. And someday soon I'll see his face said son of a [Music] man can live as I serve. Oh [Music] Lord, thou know it. Son of man, said son of man, can be striled to live and I answer. Oh Lord, thou knowest. Thou know, thou know I [Music] answer. Oh Lord, thou knowest. [Music] [Applause]
