[0:00] so we find that the tree of knowledge
[0:02] provides an abundance of comforts
[0:04] hey man people are
[0:06] people are in in a certain way healthier
[0:08] than they've ever be been before at
[0:10] least they've better better health care
[0:12] than they've ever had before more
[0:13] intelligent than they've ever been
[0:15] before amen they have more conveniences
[0:18] more pleasures more comforts than they
[0:20] ever had before
[0:21] but it's all from the tree of knowledge
[0:24] but the tree of life
[0:25] that's meant to be our satisfaction
[0:28] and so the christian is separated from
[0:30] these things
[0:32] and have you ever thought about it this
[0:33] way you know there's something i think
[0:34] that happens in the christian life
[0:35] especially for a young person that's
[0:37] raised in church and they're raised
[0:39] really in a religious home and they're
[0:41] raised to follow certain rules and do
[0:42] certain things and so it colors their
[0:44] perception of what the christian life is
[0:46] it's a life of separation and and to a
[0:49] young person that seems like works it
[0:50] seems like rules or regulations or or or
[0:53] or or certain burdens that are placed on
[0:55] their shoulder but did you know brother
[0:57] brown preached that message that god's
[0:59] word calls for a total separation from
[1:01] unbelief could i spin that around amen
[1:03] and make you look at it from a little
[1:04] bit different perspective today god's
[1:07] word offers a total separation from
[1:09] unbelief amen you know there's a life in
[1:12] christ that's that that is available to
[1:14] the christian amen that it's not a
[1:16] burden to you it's a relief it's not a
[1:18] amen it's not a it's not a it's not a a
[1:21] work or an effort it's actually a
[1:23] release it's actually a refuge amen how
[1:25] many know what i'm talking about today
[1:27] amen that's a reality friends and god's
[1:30] word is offering you a place where you
[1:32] can get to a christ where you can escape
[1:34] this eden and escape this rat race and
[1:36] get out of break the cycles amen of this
[1:39] generation amen and get in there with
[1:42] god amen oh it offers a separation it
[1:45] offers a hiding place it offers a refuge
[1:48] but you know brother braham said man
[1:50] hasn't changed very much he's still
[1:51] wandering about in the world seeking
[1:53] pleasure
[1:55] amen talking about how got man left the
[1:57] garden of eden and he wandered
[1:59] and he said now he's still wandering
[2:00] he's seeking pleasure he's restless
[2:03] he's never satisfied he's never come
[2:05] into any right conclusions
[2:07] never finding rest he's just about in
[2:09] the same condition that he was when he
[2:11] left god in the garden of eden and went
[2:13] out to shift for himself and he's been
[2:15] shifting ever since
[2:16] he's been shifting ever since and he
[2:18] finds it's a rough way to go maybe that
[2:21] would prick a heart this morning of a of
[2:23] a of a son or daughter of god who's
[2:25] living a religious life join a church
[2:27] believing god sent a prophet and
[2:29] acquainted with the culture of of the
[2:31] message of the hour amen but you find
[2:33] that there's something in your heart
[2:35] though you have not found that
[2:36] satisfaction you're restless you're
[2:39] shifting from place to place oh friends
[2:41] there's an eden for you amen there is a
[2:44] satisfaction for that thirst
[2:46] on the inside amen but you find you see
[2:49] most of the issues that we're facing
[2:51] down here is because we're chasing
[2:53] substitutes instead of the hidden manna
[2:55] that's behind the veil but the hidden
[2:58] life in christ doesn't need a substitute
[3:00] it doesn't hunger it doesn't thirst it's
[3:02] not looking for a refuge amen but it's
[3:05] founded satisfaction behind the veil in
[3:07] jesus christ now amen now bear with me
[3:10] now we're just laying a foundation and
[3:12] you see you find that uh that you're not
[3:14] supposed to be part of this world or
[3:16] you're not compatible with this world
[3:18] you're like israel you're a chosen
[3:20] people you're called out and we find
[3:23] that you're a spiritual israel what does
[3:25] that mean it means this world's full of
[3:26] temples this world is full of religions
[3:28] and movements and groups
[3:30] and peoples amen
[3:32] in the days of the bible the world was
[3:34] full of temples it was full of
[3:36] worshipers but there was only one people
[3:38] that had an ark
[3:39] amen that was that spiritual israel and
[3:42] that's what the bride of jesus christ
[3:43] has by the message of the hour amen
[3:46] everybody's got churches everybody's got
[3:48] good pastors everybody sings good songs
[3:50] and enjoys getting together and enjoys
[3:53] the social side of it but you've got an
[3:55] ark
[3:56] you've got a hiding place you've got a
[3:58] refuge
[3:59] you can get away from this world where
[4:02] it doesn't matter what they say or how
[4:04] they think you want to live your life or
[4:05] what you need to buy or what you need to
[4:07] be a part of or what you need to watch
[4:08] or consume
[4:10] your thirst and your hunger is satisfied
[4:13] with the hidden manna
[4:15] hallelujah you're the only one with an
[4:17] ark
[4:18] and watch what that means now brother
[4:20] band said when a man gets a hold of
[4:21] anything he perverts the main cause
[4:24] he said make see what is perversion
[4:26] making something different from the
[4:27] original watch god made man to live
[4:29] happily with one another
[4:31] amen perversion change them makes them
[4:33] enemies
[4:34] man makes us enemies while god made us
[4:36] brothers
[4:37] man made men to be immoral god made man
[4:40] to live true to his wife
[4:41] god gave us cool good clear water to
[4:43] drink man's got to mix alcohol or
[4:45] something else with it before he drinks
[4:47] it it's perverting from the real
[4:48] beginning of it amen this is from the
[4:50] beginning of what's not so and in doing
[4:52] so he said now taking it to the
[4:54] spiritual we find it in the church these
[4:57] things have taken place because man
[5:00] began to tamper into the things of god
[5:02] and he draws his conception of what it
[5:04] means
[5:05] he doesn't just take it the way it's
[5:06] written but he gets his own idea mixed
[5:08] into it
[5:09] and then by that he makes a tradition
[5:11] and he teaches that and jesus said when
[5:13] he was on the earth and found such he
[5:15] said in vain do you worship me
[5:18] amen now there is then possibility
[5:21] and it is so that there can be a genuine
[5:23] worship of god
[5:26] but wrong
[5:28] amen now we know about satan's eden we
[5:30] know about a generation of people who
[5:31] are worshiping the devil brother brahm
[5:33] said anointed ones at the end time and
[5:34] all those things that he taught but he
[5:36] said he said we find that there's a
[5:38] possibility of a genuine worship of god
[5:41] but wrong he said in vain they worship
[5:44] me why teaching for doctrine the
[5:45] commandments of men now we don't have a
[5:47] church creed but we've got personal
[5:49] opinions amen we've got we've got
[5:51] individual backgrounds we've got
[5:53] cultures and we've got family spirits
[5:56] and national spirit we've got all these
[5:58] things that are at play in the church
[5:59] it's no different amen than a
[6:01] denominational creed when you begin to
[6:03] take the word of god but you're trying
[6:05] to substitute your own opinion you're
[6:07] trying to make this message fit you
[6:09] you're trying to make this life
[6:10] compatible with uh with what your your
[6:13] tastes and your interests and things
[6:14] like that it doesn't work like that
[6:16] friends
[6:17] can you imagine and it's a true worship
[6:19] of god but it's in vain in vain he said
[6:22] they worship me why because instead of
[6:25] taking what i have offered them they're
[6:27] looking for their substitute they're
[6:29] chasing after something else
[6:31] amen so it becomes in vain just like we
[6:33] read the quote last thursday it's just
[6:35] enough religion to make you miserable oh
[6:38] that's a relatable statement just enough
[6:40] religion to make you miserable just like
[6:41] adam and eve when they chase out the
[6:43] garden they tried to cover their
[6:44] nakedness with fig leaves and brother
[6:46] bam said those fig leaves was man-made
[6:48] religion
[6:50] amen man made religion man tampered man
[6:53] perverted amen man oh friends that's not
[6:56] just denominational amen that's any man
[6:59] or woman who's trying to tamper amen
[7:01] with what god has given us amen but when
[7:04] you drink freely
[7:06] when you drink freely when you when you
[7:08] when you come with oh my and drink fully
[7:11] of the word of god it's a different
[7:13] experience
[7:14] it's a different experience
[7:16] amen because
[7:18] see
[7:19] in vain you worship me teaching
[7:21] traditions brother braham said they
[7:22] swapped the in the nicean council there
[7:25] that that that eve fell
[7:26] that original church fell at the nicene
[7:29] council why because they swapped the
[7:30] word of god for the wisdom
[7:32] and culture
[7:34] for the wisdom
[7:35] and culture of man
[7:38] see
[7:39] sometimes it's not the doctrine that's
[7:40] the problem it's the culture
[7:43] the culture of man and that's the same
[7:44] thing lucifer did in the garden of eden
[7:47] and they died right there the
[7:48] pentecostal church died at nicaea
[7:51] but to be resurrected in the bride tree
[7:54] amen now see there's plenty of nominal
[7:56] message believers with a man-made
[7:57] religion i think we understand these
[7:58] things but we've got to check ourselves
[8:00] amen so we won't we won't linger on that
[8:02] too long but but jesus said in vain do
[8:05] you worship me
[8:07] teaching traditions teaching tradition
[8:08] now he said it was not so here's what
[8:11] we're coming to it was not so
[8:13] from the beginning
[8:15] in the beginning we didn't have all
[8:17] these trappings of religion in the
[8:18] beginning it wasn't a social group in
[8:20] the beginning there wasn't a culture
[8:22] around it there weren't all these
[8:23] traditions there wasn't all this
[8:24] backstory there weren't all these this
[8:26] water under the bridge and fightings and
[8:28] feuds and and history and and this
[8:30] church and that church and that ministry
[8:32] and this there was none of that
[8:33] in the beginning
[8:35] was the garden
[8:36] and in the garden it was god
[8:39] and his son
[8:40] god
[8:41] and his daughter alone
[8:43] no no church
[8:45] no history no creed no opinions no
[8:49] tampering
[8:50] it was god and his children in the
[8:52] beginning that's what it was you know
[8:53] it's no coincidence brother branham
[8:55] preached the message he preached
[8:56] actually a series on why we are not a
[8:58] denomination why we're not a
[9:00] denomination and he's trying to free the
[9:02] people from the culture and from that
[9:04] mindset trying to fit into that
[9:06] denominational structure because it can
[9:08] never it can never uh it can never bring
[9:10] us to where the lord's trying to take us
[9:12] amen why we're not a denomination and
[9:15] the very first thing he preaches after
[9:17] establishing why we're not a
[9:18] denomination is it was not so from the
[9:21] beginning you see what he's trying to do
[9:23] trying to take you back beyond
[9:25] the church experience
[9:27] beyond the joining beyond the religion
[9:29] beyond the culture and the and all those
[9:31] things and take us back to the beginning
[9:34] what does that mean back to eden
[9:36] back to the original worship amen
[9:39] it was not so from the beginning it
[9:41] wasn't man in the world it wasn't man in
[9:43] the church it was man and god and i
[9:46] believe this message came to take us
[9:48] back to that amen that's what i'm
[9:50] longing for that's what i'm looking for
[9:52] in the message of the hour that's what
[9:53] it means to me it's my it's my avenue
[9:56] the veil is open i can get back to that
[9:58] place where i can get past the church
[10:00] pass the family pass the history pass
[10:03] the creed pass the culture or the
[10:05] opinions and get back to the garden with
[10:07] god
[10:08] amen shut into that holy of holies
[10:11] an individual affair with god the
[10:13] message came for that see the message is
[10:15] taking us back it's restoring us back
[10:17] not just to pentecost not just to the
[10:20] upper room it's taking us all the way
[10:22] back to eden
[10:23] that's what it was sent to do i've got
[10:25] the quotes and we're getting to them
[10:26] amen but watch now what this message
[10:28] came to do brother brown said in the
[10:29] message the messiah this is powerful
[10:32] he said when a man is born again with
[10:34] the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in
[10:36] him
[10:37] and as he can let that spirit grow
[10:39] here's what you do young person with a
[10:41] new birth god gives you experience god
[10:43] fills you with the holy ghost let that
[10:45] grow
[10:46] and take out all the roots of bitterness
[10:48] and press god's way through him again
[10:50] now if you'll let that happen brother
[10:51] brown said a man can become back in the
[10:54] same condition that he was
[10:57] in the garden of eden you believe that
[11:01] friends he said you can go you can
[11:03] there's a way
[11:04] there's a way you can get back to the
[11:06] same condition
[11:08] that he was in the garden of eden verily
[11:10] verily if i say any you say to this
[11:12] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[11:14] you can have what you said brother brown
[11:16] said that puts him right back supreme
[11:18] again it puts him right back in the
[11:21] condition amen no wonder friends no
[11:24] wonder those that are baptized with the
[11:26] holy ghost they struggle to fit into
[11:28] this world and they're struggling with
[11:29] this society and this culture because
[11:32] you're not compatible with satan's
[11:33] paradise you're of another eden
[11:36] you're of another land another existence
[11:39] amen another another oh another
[11:41] environment
[11:43] that's why power comes by the holy ghost
[11:45] what is that power it's the power of the
[11:48] adamic covenant amen it's eden power
[11:51] restored to the human race if he could
[11:53] speak to the wind if adam could speak to
[11:55] a tree and cause it to move then you can
[11:57] speak to your storm you can speak to
[11:59] your mountain
[12:00] as the brother said recently your
[12:02] mountain your voice
[12:04] why because of a power that's been
[12:05] restored
[12:06] to the people of god that's the reality
[12:09] friends you want to talk about the third
[12:11] pole amen uh what is this third pool
[12:13] anime why would god share a sovereign
[12:15] power like that with human beings
[12:17] must be because he wants them to have it
[12:20] must be because in the beginning that's
[12:22] the way it was amen not just a sovereign
[12:25] god but a man brother graham said an
[12:27] omnipotent in the human flesh
[12:30] and when those two omnipotents meet
[12:32] it's back to eden again
[12:34] back to ian again you believe that
[12:35] friends where god's trying to take us
[12:37] now we know about a millennium
[12:39] we know about things that are laying on
[12:41] the other side but what about right here
[12:42] in the middle of satan's eden friends
[12:45] amen god god did not send us a message
[12:48] to make us cope with this eden he sent a
[12:50] message to call us out and if we're
[12:52] called out then what are we called to
[12:54] heavenly places in christ jesus another
[12:56] eden
[12:57] it's another eden
[12:59] oh my brother
[13:01] and he wants you to have it
[13:04] the message pardoned brother brown's
[13:05] speaking about the love that he had for
[13:06] the human race and yet he had to see
[13:09] them separated from him see we're
[13:11] talking about a loving god and having to
[13:13] see his children separated from him and
[13:15] eating
[13:16] amen and the fellowship that he had with
[13:18] his children the garden guard him it
[13:19] wasn't an angry god
[13:21] it wasn't a god that said well i never
[13:23] liked them anyway
[13:24] they they did they didn't listen to my
[13:26] word they fell for the satan's lies i'm
[13:27] kicking them out it wasn't like that
[13:30] brother bram said he was in a
[13:31] heartbroken condition
[13:33] and he has been all the time because his
[13:36] word said the day you eat there of that
[13:38] day you die so what did he do in his
[13:40] heart broken condition amen when we were
[13:42] when our race was cast out of eden amen
[13:45] he sent jesus sin his only begotten son
[13:48] amen when when the the when the eden
[13:51] covenant said if you eat it you'll die
[13:53] amen but he said jesus who said
[13:55] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[13:58] shall never die
[14:00] they shall not taste of this of this
[14:02] spiritual death
[14:04] hallelujah eden's what he wants friends
[14:07] he's building us a future home
[14:09] that's god's desire to take you to eden
[14:11] it's god's desire to fellowship with you
[14:13] it's god's desire to take you back to
[14:15] that place
[14:16] to that existence
[14:18] then why should the backslider say well
[14:20] if god even wants me back
[14:22] why should we why should we allow
[14:24] condemnation to crawl up on us and say
[14:26] god never loved you anyway you were
[14:27] never good enough you're not accepted no
[14:30] amen i'm talking about a loving god amen
[14:33] who's been heartbroken ever since you
[14:35] left the garden of eden ever since his
[14:38] children were cast out of his presence
[14:40] his heart has been broken and the desire
[14:42] of the very heart of god
[14:44] is to bring it back
[14:46] bring it back
[14:48] to bring you back
[14:50] hallelujah
[14:52] amen
[14:53] oh my a future home now brother bram
[14:55] said it's a revelation christ the
[14:57] mystery of god revealed it's as eternal
[14:59] as god's word is eternal look at the
[15:01] threefold purpose of god god manifested
[15:04] in christ
[15:05] christ manifested in the church
[15:08] in order to what
[15:09] what's it all about what's the third
[15:11] poll all about
[15:12] what's the seventh seal all about what's
[15:14] the message of the hour
[15:15] amen god sent a message what is the
[15:17] message
[15:19] here is where brother brandon brought it
[15:20] to a culmination in order to redeem the
[15:22] lost eve back to the original condition
[15:25] in the garden of eden
[15:29] you know we just got to pause and think
[15:31] that's what he wants
[15:33] that's what he wants and that ought to
[15:35] that ought to flips the devil's
[15:36] narrative on its head in your life amen
[15:38] when we begin to think well what does
[15:40] god want maybe god doesn't uh maybe
[15:42] god's angry with me maybe maybe god has
[15:45] rejected with me maybe i'm not gonna
[15:47] make it maybe the rapture is not for me
[15:50] but eden is what he wants for you
[15:53] god's desire is to take you unto himself
[15:55] and call you out of this world
[15:57] shut you in with god it's his desire now
[16:00] that's a revelation
[16:02] amen but you'll have to see the picture
[16:03] of this message what he's been going
[16:05] after the whole time
[16:07] it changes the narrative
[16:09] brother man said he's that seed the
[16:10] woman's seed the tree of life in the
[16:12] garden he had to be chopped down
[16:15] and he was put on a tree of disgrace
[16:17] curses he that hang on a tree
[16:19] and he became a curse for the human race
[16:22] and watch this now
[16:23] that through that he brings forth a
[16:25] bright tree now what is that bride tree
[16:28] brother bram said which will be
[16:30] the tree of life restored back to him
[16:34] as husband and wife in the garden of
[16:36] eden
[16:37] hallelujah why did god call a bride what
[16:39] are you to him amen you're more than
[16:42] you're more than a fallen creature
[16:44] amen more than a sinner saved by grace
[16:47] god has restored his bride back and this
[16:49] bride tree is none other than the same
[16:51] tree of life which was granted into the
[16:54] root oh i know satan has eaten at it i
[16:57] know every pest out of hell amen has
[16:59] tried to bring false religion on you to
[17:01] put creeds on you to try to bury this
[17:04] tree but the life of this tree cannot be
[17:06] stopped amen because it's driven by the

[23:52] because he was angry amen because
[23:56] because he was trying to defend that

[35:11] hallelujah because satan has spent six
[35:14] thousand years building in eden amen and
[35:16] he thinks he's got away with it he
[35:18] thinks he won a victory when he deceived
[35:20] eve amen as she was cast out the garden
[35:23] the devil thinks that he won a victory
[35:25] when he deceived the early church and
[35:27] caused him to go into the nicean council
[35:29] and come under denominational darkness
[35:32] he thought he won the victory and just
[35:34] now it looks like that satan has built
[35:36] his eden he's built his world and he
[35:38] looks like he's on the verge of victory
[35:41] over the bride of jesus christ but we've
[35:43] got another message for the devil
[35:45] this one is different and the only
[35:48] reason the devil got this far to try to
[35:50] put his pressures on you to try to bring
[35:52] his darkness on you the reason he's
[35:55] built this eden is to prove once and for
[35:57] all
[35:58] that this one
[36:00] is different
[36:01] this eve won't fail she's not that kind
[36:04] of woman she doesn't play around with
[36:06] the word of god
[36:08] no she's back to an eating condition
[36:10] she's shut in with god she's shut off
[36:13] from the voice of the devil
[36:15] you're different
[36:18] you're different
[36:20] this one's different
[36:22] this one's not gonna fail oh glory to
[36:25] god brother braham said as god took from
[36:27] the body of adam the woman god has took
[36:29] from the body of christ
[36:31] amen and is bringing a bride out that
[36:34] won't fail by denomination or creed he
[36:37] said i hope that every man that hears
[36:39] this tape and every woman and i say let
[36:42] the devil pay attention
[36:43] i pray that every man will understand
[36:46] that she is the second eve but she's not
[36:48] breaking
[36:50] she'll stay with this world regardless
[36:54] with this word regardless
[36:56] of what anybody says
[36:59] because she's shedding with god this eve
[37:00] won't fail brother sister this one's
[37:02] different this evening will last this
[37:04] one will never fall this one will never
[37:06] be taken you'll never be chased out of

[37:11] oh this one this one's a victory
[37:14] this one's eternal
[37:16] hallelujah brother man said when the
[37:17] holy fire of god sterilizes the earth
[37:20] and he's lifted his bride into heaven
[37:21] with him when she comes back on the
[37:22] earth again a new heavens and a new
[37:24] earth cold winter can't hurt it

[41:22] in step with his environment
[41:24] he walked with god i hope this
[41:25] resonating with somebody
[41:27] amen this rapture will be for the people
[41:29] who don't walk in satan's eden
[41:33] you got nothing to look for down here

[41:58] adam and eve weren't destined they
[41:59] weren't they weren't going to be alone
[42:00] in the garden forever that spoken word
[42:03] they had a spoken word that was that's
[42:04] going to bring forth family it's going
[42:06] to be for children it's going to bring
[42:07] forth prosperity it's going to it's

[42:13] message it'll give you a family it'll
[42:15] give your friends it'll build a good
[42:16] church
[42:17] it'll do all those things but it starts
[42:19] in the garden
[42:23] alone
[42:24] in the garden
[42:31] where art thou
[42:35] adam
[42:37] where art thou do you ever think about
[42:39] that he knew where adam was
[42:41] he was an omniscient god he knew right
[42:44] he knew exactly the the tree or the
[42:46] shrub or wherever it was that little fig
[42:48] tree adam was hiding behind he knew
[42:50] right where he was but you know
[42:51] he loves to hear his children answer his
[42:53] call
[42:54] so he called out adam where are you
[42:58] where are you adam and thank thank uh
[43:00] think of this moment now god comes to
[43:02] his garden again in the cool the evening
[43:04] comes down
[43:06] steps into a body
[43:07] calls out adam
[43:10] amen and this time he came
[43:13] for the last time
[43:16] it was the last moment
[43:18] before adam was to be kicked out of the
[43:20] garden
[43:21] hallelujah
[43:23] and just for that last time he wanted to
[43:26] hear
[43:26] his child his son his creation
[43:30] call out
[43:32] respond his call
[43:34] he was actually calling adam to remove
[43:36] him and it must have felt so final
[43:38] to adam
[43:40] god's last call of his name in the
[43:42] garden
[43:44] before he had to leave
[43:47] maybe he walked with him a little while
[43:50] said listen adam
[43:52] said i i'm sorry my son
[43:57] i know it it seems like this is our last
[43:59] walk in the garden

[44:04] terrible
[44:06] but you know adam
[44:09] i'm in control of this thing
[44:13] i haven't i haven't lost control
[44:16] but you know adam there's something i
[44:18] got in my heart to express
[44:21] and that's why all this is happening
[44:24] the serpent seed must run its course
[44:28] satan's eden has got to
[44:30] but this isn't the end adam
[44:34] eden's not lost
[44:38] but this has to happen
