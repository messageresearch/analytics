[22:59] to go to the Lord in prayer this morning
[23:01] also want to let you know Apostolic
[23:03] Tabernacle North Carolina brother Josh
[23:04] Bennett will be having their annual
[23:06] meetings on June 20th through the 23rd
[23:08] so remember that the 20th June 20th
[23:11] through 23rd there at Apostolic
[23:13] Tabernacle so remember that also we have
[23:16] a testimony from sister Haley it
[23:20] says I bit my lip and March and somehow
[23:23] hit a vein that wouldn't stop bleeding a
[23:24] couple days later I had a purple vein
[23:26] showing through my lip that called it a
[23:29] Venus Lake after about a month it wasn't
[23:31] going away so I made an appointment with
[23:33] the vein doctor to have her laser it a
[23:36] week before my appointment I was
[23:38] brushing my teeth and the vein burst it
[23:39] bled for a couple hours and wouldn't
[23:41] stop so I called the doctor and she got
[23:43] me in that day to laser it which
[23:45] cauterizes the vein another week goes by
[23:48] and it still kept bleeding so she
[23:49] lasered it again and turned it up even
[23:51] hotter that time she said it's a big
[23:53] vein and it actually goes almost to the
[23:55] jaw so after cauterizing it within a
[23:58] couple weeks the vein the vein should
[24:00] shrink back down well it didn't it
[24:03] turned into a sore that would not heal
[24:05] and it kept growing it turned into a
[24:07] tumor called a pyogenic
[24:09] granuloma basically means tumor that
[24:11] bleeds often it bled every day and some
[24:14] days I would feel washcloths full I went
[24:16] to a dermatologist to see if she could
[24:18] remove it and she thought it might need
[24:20] actual surgery because of the bleeding
[24:22] and how it would scar so she referred me
[24:24] to a plastic surgeon I got a hold of one
[24:28] and he was going to take a look at my
[24:30] pictures to see if I needed surgery or
[24:32] not that day I was feeling really
[24:33] discouraging so I messaged his sister's
[24:35] group asking them to please pray that
[24:37] the plastic surgeon would have some
[24:39] answers for me and that the Lord would
[24:41] stop the bleeding and heal my lip with
[24:43] no big scar I felt silly asking for my
[24:46] lip but I was dep desperate for answers
[24:48] and healing the surgeon's office called
[24:50] me the next morning say I definitely
[24:51] needed surgery because of how much it
[24:53] would bleed they said it would be over
[24:55] an hour long and be under anesthesia
[24:58] and they would remove the vein inside my
[25:00] lip and Stitch the top I asked how much
[25:02] that was going to cost they said that
[25:03] didn't they didn't take insurance and it
[25:06] would be over 2,000 I got off the phone
[25:08] feeling totally discouraged thinking we
[25:10] didn't have that kind of money to spend
[25:12] on something so silly as me body my lip
[25:15] so I prayed and called the second place
[25:17] the dermatologists had recommended they
[25:20] took insurance and scheduled me for an
[25:21] appointment this past Friday while all
[25:24] this was going on I had read online that
[25:26] someone in another country put salt on
[25:27] that kind a tumor and it dissolved
[25:29] within 2 weeks this was the evening
[25:32] after I had asked the sisters to pray
[25:34] and a week before my scheduled
[25:35] appointment I had nothing to lose so I
[25:37] decided to try the salt treatment that
[25:39] night the next morning I woke up and it
[25:42] was black and drying out it completely
[25:44] stopped bleeding within 3 days the tumor
[25:46] was completely gone all I have left is a
[25:49] tiny spot that's getting better every
[25:51] day I called the surgeon this week and
[25:53] canceled my appointment no surgery no
[25:56] scar no more tumor he's an on time God
[25:58] and cares for the little and big things
[26:00] in our life nothing is too silly or
[26:02] simple for him he cares friends praise
[26:06] the name of the
[26:08] Lord praise the name of the Lord

[55:02] let it on into a to a real Holy Ghost
[55:04] meeting amen and you know um I love the
[55:07] way he said that the enem is going to
[55:08] come around and say that was just a uh
[55:10] just uh just your feelings or something
[55:12] of that nature but I believe the Holy
[55:14] Spirit when he begins to move on his
[55:16] children and they begin to react you got
[55:19] every right Amen to to to Worship the
[55:22] Lord and praise him and I thank God for
[55:24] every testimony we have this morning
[55:26] amen and amen do you know your testimony
[55:28] brother bam actually calls it a rock and
[55:31] you remember he said to Peter he said
[55:32] I'll call thee Peter little Stone and he
[55:34] said it was a rock of confession you
[55:37] know back in the Bible there was a time
[55:39] when the children of Israel was out in
[55:40] the middle of the desert and they got in
[55:42] trouble and remember when they called
[55:44] Elisha on the scene and he went out
[55:46] there and they didn't have any water and
[55:48] they was in the middle of a battle and
[55:49] he told him he said what you need to do
[55:51] is start digging and he said if you dig
[55:54] digging these ditches he said you're
[55:55] going to find water and the Bible said
[55:58] when they dug down in those ditches that
[55:59] they had slept overnight and when they
[56:02] woke up the next morning there had been
[56:03] no rain or anything but every ditch was
[56:05] full of water but said the secret behind
[56:08] that was the water that come out of that
[56:10] rock with Moses was still there in the
[56:12] in the country but it was bling beneath
[56:14] all that sand and it was on the Bedrock
[56:16] and when they dug down to that rock that
[56:18] Prophet knew if you dig the sand out of
[56:20] the way the old dirt you dig it out of
[56:23] the way that that that Spirit would
[56:25] start coming and the next morning when
[56:27] the enemy looked upon it they thought it
[56:29] was rivers of blood and they thought
[56:31] well we've lost the battle so so they
[56:33] turned and ran and Elisha commanded them
[56:36] he said now you rise up from your places
[56:38] and go over and fall all the trees in
[56:40] the enemy territory and you take rocks
[56:42] and you put it on every well because the
[56:45] enemy's Welles was something that was
[56:46] putting out in that in that country and
[56:49] brother brandom types it to formalism
[56:51] and he said see there's former Wells
[56:53] there's people going around and saying
[56:55] God don't do these kind of things
[56:56] anymore but God gave you a testimony
[56:59] last night you take your rock and you
[57:01] put it right on that former well and you
[57:03] stop the mouth of Amen of nayay and and
[57:06] brother Bram said God you said what you
[57:08] need to do is each man took a rock and
[57:10] they got over on them old former Wells
[57:12] and they had a rock testimony that's
[57:14] what it is a rock testimony and they
[57:17] said praise God God give me the Holy
[57:19] Ghost amen and you just place it right
[57:22] on that well and I thank God this
[57:23] morning that he's give us the Rock Amen

[1:06:14] as we look into the word today I pray
[1:06:17] that God will just open our hearts to
[1:06:20] the word of truth that we have been so
[1:06:23] blessed with in this day as we preached
[1:06:25] not from a closed book but from an open
[1:06:29] book amen where the word of God has been
[1:06:33] made known to us in this day and the
[1:06:36] full word of God has been born into
[1:06:38] manifestation and I so thank God for
[1:06:41] that Psalms
[1:06:43] 139:7 whei shall I go from thy Spirit or
[1:06:47] whether shall I flee from thy presence
[1:06:50] if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art
[1:06:53] there if I make my bed in hell behold
[1:06:56] Thou Art there if I take the wings of
[1:06:58] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[1:07:01] parts of the sea even there shall my thy
[1:07:05] hand lead me and thy right hand shall
[1:07:08] hold me if I say surely the darkness
[1:07:11] shall cover me even the night shall be
[1:07:14] light about me yay the darkness hideth
[1:07:18] not from thee but the night shineth as
[1:07:22] the day and the Darkness and the light
[1:07:25] are both alike to thee and then turn
[1:07:28] with me to 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 13 1
[1:07:33] Thessalonians 4 verse
[1:07:36] 13 but I would not have you to be
[1:07:38] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[1:07:41] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:07:44] others which have no hope for if we
[1:07:48] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:07:52] even so them also which sleep and Jesus
[1:07:55] Will God bring with him for this we say
[1:07:58] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:08:01] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:08:04] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:08:07] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:08:10] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:08:13] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:08:16] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:08:19] in Christ shall rise first and then we
[1:08:22] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:08:24] caught up together
[1:08:25] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[1:08:27] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:08:31] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another
[1:08:35] with these words God bless you can be
[1:08:39] seated I'm going to speak to you from
[1:08:43] that passage in the
[1:08:45] Psalms and also hinge from this verses
[1:08:49] in
[1:08:50] Thessalonians and I'm going to speak to
[1:08:52] you on about on the wings of the morning
[1:08:57] all right and and of course um as we
[1:09:00] have also read from the scripture in
[1:09:03] Thessalonians where Paul gave us words
[1:09:07] of comfort that were to be give us
[1:09:10] strength and I believe that people and
[1:09:12] men and women down to the ages have
[1:09:15] received strength from these very words
[1:09:17] and comfort from the scripture and the
[1:09:21] psalmist speaks of the wings of the
[1:09:23] morning you know those first
[1:09:26] rays of light that comes with the
[1:09:29] Dawn and it you know it just seems like
[1:09:32] sometimes that night will never end and
[1:09:37] you know some of us you know we we just
[1:09:40] can't wait for the
[1:09:41] dawn you know we we yearn for it we sing
[1:09:44] of it just as we heard it sung by sister
[1:09:47] Bethany and those a while ago of come
[1:09:50] Jesus
[1:09:51] comes and you know it we yearn part we H
[1:09:55] for it you know um many songs have been
[1:09:58] written about it by and by when the
[1:10:01] morning comes when all the saints of God
[1:10:04] shall G be gathered home you know on
[1:10:07] that bright and cloudless morning when
[1:10:10] the dead in Christ shall rise and the
[1:10:12] glory of his resurrection share and when
[1:10:15] his chosen ones are gathered to their
[1:10:18] home beyond the skies When the Roll is
[1:10:20] caught up yonder I'll be there it's the
[1:10:24] hope of the ages
[1:10:26] like the psalmist says you know some
[1:10:29] golden Daybreak Jesus will come amen and
[1:10:33] for the world we have a new era that is
[1:10:37] Dawning that will change the world as we
[1:10:39] know it there's some a thing called
[1:10:42] artificial intelligence that is here and
[1:10:45] many fear that it will destroy human
[1:10:48] life and brother Bram tells us in
[1:10:51] countdown that he had learned that all
[1:10:53] things that are natural are types of
[1:10:55] spiritual things and that we were to
[1:10:58] remember that when you see anything in
[1:11:00] the natural it is Type in a spiritual
[1:11:02] thing and I'm sure you just re you just
[1:11:06] um noticed in the news recently where
[1:11:09] the US um completed the first dog fight
[1:11:13] between AI controlled
[1:11:16] F-16 um you know where where did it
[1:11:19] would fly without a um human pilot and
[1:11:24] uh you know that even our Air Force
[1:11:26] secretor secretary Frank Kendall flew in
[1:11:30] that F-16 and it matched up well against
[1:11:33] an experienced human pilot in dog fights
[1:11:37] so he flew in this dog fight or this
[1:11:40] plane and and practice dog fights
[1:11:42] without a human touching any
[1:11:45] controls and so we we have a lot of
[1:11:50] advancements that are taking place in
[1:11:52] the world today and we know that brother
[1:11:55] ran and prophesied back in
[1:11:58] 1933 seeing um the seven continuous
[1:12:02] visions and one of them that that we'll
[1:12:05] speak of and maybe several of was it was
[1:12:08] um you know the the artificial
[1:12:10] intelligence on the and bringing the
[1:12:13] automation of driverless cars that are
[1:12:16] now on the road and and of course that
[1:12:18] was 91 years ago that these things were
[1:12:22] spoken to us and that was not by
[1:12:25] artificial intelligence but it was by
[1:12:28] God's intelligence through a prophetic
[1:12:31] eye by Vision that saw driverless cars
[1:12:34] and he he called it shaped like an egg
[1:12:37] the word
[1:12:38] aerodynamics was was not even invented
[1:12:41] back at that time nobody knew what that
[1:12:43] was and so they had to even make up
[1:12:46] words to describe it just like we use
[1:12:48] the word computer today in our language
[1:12:50] and and 91 years ago nobody would have
[1:12:53] known what that was we had actually
[1:12:55] speak a new new binacular today in our
[1:12:58] time than what we did 100 years ago you
[1:13:01] know but but I mean just even in our
[1:13:04] small town of of Menan the other day we
[1:13:08] we there was um an an a car driving
[1:13:12] along the road without a without a
[1:13:14] driver in it the wh Mo autonomous car is
[1:13:18] now clocked over 20 million miles of
[1:13:22] real world driving experienced through
[1:13:24] countless situations and it's that's
[1:13:27] equivalent of driving to the Moon and
[1:13:30] Back 40
[1:13:32] times and so you know we also know that
[1:13:36] on the other hand the bride of Christ is
[1:13:39] also going beyond the wisdom of man by
[1:13:42] receiving the message it's the
[1:13:45] intelligence of God and the body for
[1:13:48] Christ has been built up Through the
[1:13:50] Ages as brother randam stated like a
[1:13:53] seed the church in the ground and came
[1:13:56] up as it were the feet with Luther then
[1:13:58] Advanced through Wesley and then in the
[1:14:01] Pentecostals of tongues and then he said
[1:14:04] now it's in the eyes of prophetic of
[1:14:07] Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's
[1:14:10] nothing left for it but for him himself
[1:14:14] to step into that CU that's the last
[1:14:17] thing there is the next is the
[1:14:20] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[1:14:23] of our of our own it's his we have no
[1:14:25] sight of our own how can a man foresee
[1:14:28] those things he can't it's God himself
[1:14:31] and as we come into place he's govern
[1:14:33] the body all the way down through then
[1:14:34] the complete body of Christ is revealed
[1:14:37] in the form of a bride that was taken
[1:14:40] out of his side like Adams was at the
[1:14:43] beginning so we we as he described have
[1:14:47] come through the feet with Luther and
[1:14:49] Wesley the body Pentecost the tongue the
[1:14:52] prophetic eye and now Christ is here
[1:14:55] with his
[1:14:56] intelligence and and this is why that we
[1:14:59] can be told things with accurate
[1:15:02] accurate discernment you know other
[1:15:05] gifted mens in in this generation would
[1:15:08] rise up and maybe 80% own and other and
[1:15:12] 20% wrong or 20% right and 80% wrong but
[1:15:17] but this intelligence was God it was
[1:15:20] used in a man and through that prophetic
[1:15:23] voice proven to us that the complete
[1:15:26] word was here because only the word can
[1:15:30] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:15:33] heart now those with that are familiar
[1:15:36] with artificial intelligence tell us
[1:15:38] that that the power grids that we have
[1:15:41] today will not supply the need for the
[1:15:43] energy required by this artificial
[1:15:46] intelligence but however this
[1:15:49] intelligence that we have received comes
[1:15:52] from with a energy Supply
[1:15:55] of the fullness of the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:58] his Dynamic working power amen because
[1:16:02] this is the time that the Dynamics come
[1:16:04] to the mechanics and make that word live
[1:16:09] you know when brother Ram left us he
[1:16:11] left us with a car that would drive amen
[1:16:14] it was running and it would drive it
[1:16:16] would drive down to Divine Healing it
[1:16:18] would drive down to Miracles it would
[1:16:20] drive down to the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost it would drive down all amen it
[1:16:25] had power in it it would move sir well
[1:16:28] we've had a too many fiddle Fatt with
[1:16:31] mechanics amen we got to come back to
[1:16:34] what the way the prophet left the car he
[1:16:36] left it running and it ought to be able
[1:16:38] to run down to Divine Healing
[1:16:40] Deliverance salvation every promise of
[1:16:44] God
[1:16:45] Amen
[1:16:48] sir brother Brandon said in this very
[1:16:52] thing he said what is it he said the
[1:16:53] quickening power of God has come to us
[1:16:56] to open up the Seven Seals he said what
[1:16:59] was that the intelligence of a man no
[1:17:02] that was a quickening power of God I'm
[1:17:05] so glad for the quickening power amen
[1:17:08] and so the in this same intelligence now
[1:17:12] just going through a couple of things
[1:17:14] this morning I'm trying to keep track of
[1:17:17] time so um believe it or not I do pay
[1:17:20] attention to time
[1:17:26] I
[1:17:29] do after I'm
[1:17:38] done
[1:17:40] yeah okay I'm
[1:17:43] old turning 70 this year and I'm old and
[1:17:47] it takes me a while to get
[1:17:51] going so I'm like the old Indian that
[1:17:54] was watching this straight train trying
[1:17:56] to get going and they had this you know
[1:17:59] had this building it up with coal and
[1:18:02] building up the engine and you know
[1:18:04] trying to get the fire up and he was
[1:18:06] watching he said man that thing can
[1:18:08] never go that thing it'll never run
[1:18:11] it'll never run it'll never run after a
[1:18:14] little bit got steam up in that old
[1:18:17] engine blew some blew uh some sound out
[1:18:20] the whistle and he'd go to grinding down
[1:18:22] the the track and started running and he
[1:18:24] said yeah they'll never stop it they'll
[1:18:26] never stop
[1:18:28] [Applause]
[1:18:30] it I know how you feel
[1:18:33] today amen so you know he just takes us
[1:18:38] a little longer to tell what we know
[1:18:42] amen and so anyway you know but the
[1:18:46] intelligence this Divine intelligence
[1:18:49] tell told us of a woman rising in power
[1:18:53] yeah and that and let me tell you that's
[1:18:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ who is the
[1:18:58] fullness of the godhead in a body yeah
[1:19:03] and she is a complete manifestation of
[1:19:07] the word of God Amen that intelligence
[1:19:10] showed us in the preview of the Bride
[1:19:13] that when the rest of the church goes
[1:19:15] down this one goes
[1:19:17] up amen and and that that this that
[1:19:21] woman that Christ has stepped into is
[1:19:25] now here upon the
[1:19:27] Earth and this Al those this
[1:19:30] intelligence also told us of another
[1:19:33] woman rising through the popular vote of
[1:19:36] women this is back in
[1:19:38] 1933 who you know there wasn't even
[1:19:41] women in the Senate and the Congress and
[1:19:42] the and and and all of that but anyway
[1:19:45] he said it would either be vice
[1:19:46] president or president but a woman of
[1:19:49] great power perhaps a Catholic Church he
[1:19:51] said who who would oh would hold America
[1:19:55] in her complete sway he looked at it he
[1:19:57] said I can't I I I I know it was a woman
[1:20:00] but maybe it was the Catholic church I'm
[1:20:03] not not sure you know it wasn't part of
[1:20:06] the vision that it was the Catholic
[1:20:08] church but he said I saw a woman rising
[1:20:11] and so in the 70th week of Daniel he
[1:20:13] said he said now that brings us then to
[1:20:16] the election of President Kennedy and
[1:20:19] and um this car coming on the scene and
[1:20:22] bringing five of The Seven Things that
[1:20:24] has happened exactly and I predicted I
[1:20:27] saw a great woman stand up beautiful
[1:20:30] looking and dressed in the real highly
[1:20:34] Royals like purple and I got parentheses
[1:20:37] like here she was a great ruler in the
[1:20:39] United States and perhaps a Catholic
[1:20:42] Church a woman some woman I don't know
[1:20:44] her to be a Catholic church I don't know
[1:20:46] all I can I can't say only thing I seen
[1:20:49] it was a woman that was all and I just
[1:20:51] say we got both right
[1:20:56] and she was dressed exactly like the
[1:20:58] prophet
[1:21:00] said amen even described her her
[1:21:03] inaugural dress in Royal Purple just
[1:21:07] like the prophet of God said amen and
[1:21:11] she vice president but we also got the
[1:21:14] first Catholic
[1:21:16] President since
[1:21:18] Kennedy and we have the same repeat of
[1:21:21] the same thing crooked voting that's
[1:21:24] right
[1:21:25] that brother bandam said got Kennedy in
[1:21:27] back then is now happened
[1:21:30] again amen so we we are here right at
[1:21:34] this very very hour you know you you can
[1:21:36] start checking the box
[1:21:39] that's amen you just start to click you

[1:21:44] went right down and showed you know the
[1:21:46] the the the king the the kingdoms coming
[1:21:49] together and and the war between Germany
[1:21:52] and so on and and the and Hitler leading
[1:21:54] of war and melini's fall and all that

[1:22:23] night is about over
[1:22:27] over amen I'm seeing a bride rise on the
[1:22:31] scene Hallelujah I'm seeing the Dynamics
[1:22:35] come to the mechanics I'm seeing a bride
[1:22:37] move in the power of his
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:42] resurrection I'm seeing people beginning
[1:22:44] to believe their hearts turned back to
[1:22:47] Faith
[1:22:49] again amen now brother brandham said of
[1:22:52] this woman now we we got both we got we
[1:22:56] got Catholicism we got the the woman we
[1:22:59] got it both in the same thing she will
[1:23:02] lead
[1:23:03] thetion to
[1:23:07] ruination I'm quoting and this
[1:23:10] Administration has had gay and
[1:23:12] transgender celebrations in the White
[1:23:15] House advancing their cause more than
[1:23:17] any other
[1:23:18] Administration they boast that roughly
[1:23:21] 15% of all appointees identify
[1:23:23] themselves as as lesbian gay bisexual
[1:23:26] transgender and queer and we even have
[1:23:29] the the the first Senate confirmed
[1:23:32] cabinet secretary in US history as our
[1:23:36] Transportation uh uh secretary is being
[1:23:40] the the the first openly gay man you see
[1:23:45] and and if you just remember it you
[1:23:48] remember just even the liberal man Bill
[1:23:52] Clinton back years ago he signed in the
[1:23:55] law the Defense of Marriage Act
[1:23:58] protecting the right of marriage between
[1:23:59] a man and a woman and all of that has
[1:24:03] been undone and Biden signed into law
[1:24:07] samex
[1:24:08] marriages and brother Bram told us then
[1:24:11] he said she will guide or lead this
[1:24:15] nation to
[1:24:17] ruination and then he then he said these
[1:24:20] other things she held the people in her
[1:24:23] complete power right and this
[1:24:27] Administration does what it wants to
[1:24:29] do if the Supreme Court says they cannot
[1:24:32] forgive student loans this
[1:24:35] Administration does it
[1:24:37] anyhow they circumvent laws they've been
[1:24:40] and flooded the the country with 7
[1:24:43] million illegals and who they're now
[1:24:45] giving voting
[1:24:46] rights Opening Our borders now inviting
[1:24:50] the Palestinians who not only hate
[1:24:52] Israel but hate America
[1:24:55] look at what is happening you know
[1:24:57] brother brandham said always for us to
[1:24:59] look at Israel if you want to know what
[1:25:01] time it is she's under attack the world
[1:25:05] courts and the world opinion is against
[1:25:07] her this is a spiritual
[1:25:11] war Amen brother Ram told us many years
[1:25:14] ago and feast of of trumpets he said
[1:25:16] those Spirits had been released that had
[1:25:19] been held up under Euphrates and he said
[1:25:21] they come there and he used and
[1:25:23] described them as they they came the
[1:25:25] hatred against the Jews and he and he
[1:25:28] said you know it would it would be
[1:25:30] against us in the same way but ours
[1:25:33] comes in the ecclesiastical
[1:25:36] manner amen but remember the pressure
[1:25:39] that was put upon you when you were
[1:25:42] there many of you were in the the the
[1:25:46] camps there and you were held in the
[1:25:49] bondage of denominational systems and
[1:25:52] there you were dying and in emancipated
[1:25:55] being killed with every kind of false
[1:25:58] Doctrine amen what did it do it caused
[1:26:01] something to rise
[1:26:03] up within us and that we must have a
[1:26:06] Homeland we've got to have a place where
[1:26:09] the word can be
[1:26:10] preached amen where the baptism of
[1:26:13] jesus' name can be proclaimed where
[1:26:16] healing and miracles and signs and
[1:26:18] wonders and the promises of God can be
[1:26:21] manifest we've got to have our homeland
[1:26:23] we got to get back to the
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:28] Bible and God opened the book for us for
[1:26:31] the us to come
[1:26:36] in now and Israel is over there in their
[1:26:41] Homeland and there they are World courts
[1:26:45] her against her and they she becomes the
[1:26:47] burdensome Stone spoke of in Zechariah
[1:26:52] 12 and3 I I'm just giving use some check
[1:26:55] marks Zechariah 12:3 and in that day I
[1:26:58] will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone
[1:27:01] for all people and all that burden
[1:27:04] themselves with it shall be cut into
[1:27:06] pieces though all the people of the
[1:27:08] earth be gathered together against
[1:27:12] it amen it's already
[1:27:15] prophesied the world's going to be
[1:27:17] against
[1:27:18] her amen we go we go and see where that
[1:27:23] man is got into God's laboratory and
[1:27:26] here's the plague I want you to look in
[1:27:28] the Bible Zechariah 14:12 and this shall
[1:27:32] be the plague where with the Lord will
[1:27:35] Smite all the people that have fought
[1:27:37] against Jerusalem their flesh shall
[1:27:39] consume away while they stand upon their
[1:27:42] feet and their eyes shall consume away
[1:27:45] in their holes and their tongues shall
[1:27:47] consume away in their mouth nuclear
[1:27:52] destruction atomic fod
[1:27:54] yes amen goes right over to Revelation
[1:27:57] 13:13 he does wonders so that he maketh
[1:28:00] Fire come down from heaven on the earth
[1:28:03] in the sight of men this is this what
[1:28:05] give power and authority now now look we
[1:28:08] are here this intelligence has shown
[1:28:12] what is going to happen smoke bombs
[1:28:15] craters all over the land of America
[1:28:18] this is what's coming
[1:28:22] next I said this this is what's coming
[1:28:27] next amen but but let me just tell you
[1:28:30] at the same time even though that's
[1:28:32] coming next Jesus said that we should
[1:28:35] pray
[1:28:36] always to be accounted worthy to escape
[1:28:40] the things that are coming on the
[1:28:42] earth God has provided a way out he's
[1:28:46] provided a Rapture for the church and
[1:28:50] Escape Hallelujah we are in an exodus
[1:28:54] we're not going to be left behind and
[1:28:56] neither are we leaving a ho behind we're
[1:28:59] taking our loved ones our children
[1:29:01] hallelujah we're taking out our Promised
[1:29:04] Land we are going in an
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:11] exodus this
[1:29:12] intelligence admonished us watch Russia
[1:29:16] watch Russia keep your eye on the King

[1:29:56] where the powers are divided between the
[1:29:59] iron and the clay and it is here it is
[1:30:03] here at this point at this stage of the
[1:30:06] image we all agree we you know we we're
[1:30:10] going back to Daniel's interpretation of
[1:30:12] Nebuchadnezzar's dream come down from
[1:30:15] The Babylon Empire meets in Persian
[1:30:18] brass on down to uh the Greek and down
[1:30:21] into iron into Rome and runs all the way
[1:30:24] down to the end to where we're here at
[1:30:26] the end of the Gentile kingdoms have we
[1:30:29] arrived are we here amen but it is that
[1:30:34] place that and that time that a stone
[1:30:37] without hand hits the feet of the image
[1:30:41] and will sweep away the people and that
[1:30:43] stone becomes a great mountain of the
[1:30:46] Lord for the millennial Kingdom
[1:30:50] ahead this prophetic voice told us
[1:30:55] Babylon is a head of gold another
[1:30:59] kingdom with silver brass the Greek
[1:31:03] comes down and here we are right at that
[1:31:07] place and then a
[1:31:09] stone a stone without hand comes to
[1:31:13] Smite the feet of the image and breaks
[1:31:15] them into pieces and they crumble and
[1:31:17] fall and become a great Mountain because
[1:31:20] the Bible said the kingdoms of this
[1:31:22] world will become the kingdoms of Our
[1:31:25] Lord in his Christ there will be a
[1:31:30] millennium amen for the Bible said in
[1:31:33] Daniel 2:44 and the days of these King
[1:31:37] in the days of these Kings shall the god
[1:31:39] of Heaven set up the kingdom which shall
[1:31:43] never be destroyed and the kingdom shall
[1:31:46] not be left to other people but it shall
[1:31:49] break into pieces and consume all these
[1:31:52] kingdoms and it shall stand
[1:31:54] forever and we're here we are here
[1:31:57] because already the spiritual
[1:32:00] forerunning of this event has happened
[1:32:04] already we've seen the kingdoms of man
[1:32:07] come down as the Stone smoke the image
[1:32:11] become a great Mountain filling the
[1:32:14] earth and the god of Heaven setting up a
[1:32:16] kingdom in the hearts of men and women a
[1:32:20] kingdom that will never be moved because
[1:32:22] he said yeah once more I shake not the
[1:32:25] Earth only but also heaven but we have
[1:32:29] received a kingdom that will never be
[1:32:33] moved Hallelujah that's the promise that
[1:32:38] was given this is the
[1:32:40] intelligence that we
[1:32:42] receive yeah the book holds many
[1:32:46] wonderful truths and Revelation and
[1:32:49] Promises of the time when darkness will
[1:32:53] be over
[1:32:54] when will morning
[1:32:56] come right now still dark so very dark
[1:33:00] even the Book of Revelation shows the
[1:33:02] Gentile ages are nighttime because there
[1:33:06] are seven stars and seven lamps and
[1:33:09] they're not seen in the day they're only
[1:33:11] useful at night as he said in the church
[1:33:14] ages that he said and I quote this from
[1:33:17] the church age book and this very hour
[1:33:20] he is walking in the midst of the last
[1:33:23] age golden Candlestick what he was as he
[1:33:26] walked in the first stage he is even now
[1:33:29] in this last stage Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:32] yesterday today and
[1:33:34] forever but sometimes it just seems
[1:33:37] morning will never come you know the
[1:33:39] seventh Church age supposed to be the
[1:33:43] the shortest has now exceeded the first
[1:33:46] year Church age by here the
[1:33:49] messenger left he left us when he was
[1:33:52] but 50 6 years of age and now has been
[1:33:56] gone 58
[1:33:58] years two years longer than he was
[1:34:01] here when will morning come we see the
[1:34:05] world get darker and darker and the haer
[1:34:09] to this coming is that that the delay
[1:34:12] will make a way for scoffers to arise
[1:34:16] yeah and they will come expressing doubt
[1:34:19] and that would be one of the signs you
[1:34:21] know you you got to have scuffers
[1:34:25] yeah amen you got you know you got to
[1:34:27] have scoffers and
[1:34:29] mockers you know Canaanites and Jeb Jeb
[1:34:33] sites and
[1:34:37] websites all rising up to express doubt
[1:34:40] it it'll be one of the last signs and in
[1:34:44] this time many will lose
[1:34:47] Faith second Peter 3 and 3 saying
[1:34:50] knowing this first so he established
[1:34:53] first first first when it comes to
[1:34:56] identifying the last days and the coming
[1:34:59] there shall come in the last days
[1:35:01] scoffers walking after their own lust
[1:35:05] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:35:07] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:35:11] all things continue as they were from
[1:35:13] the beginning of the
[1:35:14] creation you know here they were in that
[1:35:18] time and Peter's having to deal with
[1:35:20] this because Jesus wasn't coming back
[1:35:25] like they thought he
[1:35:29] was they had it all figured
[1:35:32] out surely he'll come this year and
[1:35:35] there was date
[1:35:39] Setters date Setters we you know he's
[1:35:41] surely going to come by this time and
[1:35:44] and that time and you know whatever and
[1:35:46] you know white you K that's going to be
[1:35:48] the end of everything and better store
[1:35:50] up I tell you you know it'll be it'll
[1:35:52] start there you better get ready you
[1:35:55] know and 2000
[1:35:58] comes we change
[1:36:06] calendars people were concerned about
[1:36:09] the delay in Paul's day and said Paul
[1:36:12] said the things you wrote to me about
[1:36:14] and he begins to explain the scripture
[1:36:16] in first Thessalonians 4 you know he
[1:36:19] could write of these things because he'd
[1:36:21] went into the third heaven
[1:36:24] and so he is one who could tell us of
[1:36:26] celestial bodies and he could tell us of
[1:36:29] you know all kinds of things you know
[1:36:31] that this house of this habitation you
[1:36:33] know we we'll give way and we already
[1:36:35] got one in glory I I he didn't say it
[1:36:38] but he could say I saw him
[1:36:40] there cuz he visited that place but you
[1:36:44] know again at least by his prophetic eye
[1:36:47] he saw it cuz he told us things about
[1:36:49] heaven that no one else could new bodies
[1:36:53] no else could but you know the people
[1:36:56] were just concerned about the delay and
[1:36:59] and because of the delay it it gives
[1:37:01] occasions to scoffers and it's even hard
[1:37:05] on us who are believers right you know
[1:37:09] just recently I had a dream now this is
[1:37:12] just a dream it wasn't wasn't a vision
[1:37:14] and just chalk it up as a dream but I'm
[1:37:16] going to tell it anyway it was a
[1:37:18] dream and do you know I had a dream I
[1:37:20] went to
[1:37:22] heaven and I as I walked into the entry
[1:37:27] there I was stopped and there was an
[1:37:31] angel went and came with records and he
[1:37:35] opened the book and he looked into the
[1:37:38] book and he said it is not your time to
[1:37:42] come
[1:37:42] here you must go back but when you go
[1:37:46] back you must rest
[1:37:50] more all I woke up from that and I
[1:37:54] thought rest
[1:37:57] more I must rest
[1:37:59] more so I went to cabin on the lake and
[1:38:02] I rested and I watched the waves come
[1:38:05] and feeling the winds blow and
[1:38:08] contemplating what I was told to do I
[1:38:11] was told to take a
[1:38:13] rest but then I realized it's not
[1:38:16] physical
[1:38:17] rest but resting on the
[1:38:20] promise it's looking at what God said
[1:38:23] and resting on it oh if I can get you to
[1:38:27] do that your hands were laid on you last
[1:38:30] night we did what the Bible said rest on
[1:38:33] that
[1:38:34] promise rest on
[1:38:37] it amen knowing he will never fail
[1:38:41] heavens and earth will pass away but his
[1:38:43] word can't
[1:38:45] fail if there's anything we must do is
[1:38:49] enter into rest don't get anxious don't
[1:38:53] get worried don't get fearful Don't Be
[1:38:57] Afraid God's got
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:03] this rest is not going on vacation it's
[1:39:07] not getting eight hours of sleep Jesus
[1:39:10] said come to me and I'll give you rest
[1:39:13] it's an active exchange you know your
[1:39:15] burden his
[1:39:18] rest the world says rest is is to be a
[1:39:22] complete engagement from everything but
[1:39:25] Jesus says Jesus says rest is a complete
[1:39:29] it is complete
[1:39:31] engagement engagement with the person of
[1:39:33] Jesus Christ he he is your rest Giver he
[1:39:36] is your burden lifter so it's not
[1:39:39] disengaged from all of this and other
[1:39:41] and getting eight hours of sleep and you
[1:39:43] know resting up I mean we're get we're
[1:39:46] getting more vacations than any other
[1:39:47] age ever
[1:39:49] did better work laws and ethics and
[1:39:52] everything else than anybody else we'll
[1:39:54] we will Riot for our rights but Jesus
[1:39:57] said rest is not disengagement it's
[1:40:00] complete engagement it's it's engagement
[1:40:03] with the person of Jesus Christ he is
[1:40:05] your rester he is your burden lifter so
[1:40:09] cast your cares on him for he cares for
[1:40:14] you amen humble yourself under the
[1:40:17] mighty hand of God and he will lift you
[1:40:21] up we got to come to Jesus saying I
[1:40:23] humble myself I cast my cares on you I
[1:40:28] can't do this by
[1:40:30] myself I'm a
[1:40:33] dependent come on the bride a woman is
[1:40:36] to be a dependent dependent that's right
[1:40:40] he shows your due
[1:40:45] benevolence he wants you to cast your
[1:40:47] cares on
[1:40:48] him and I want you to make an exchange
[1:40:53] completely he
[1:40:55] says give me your
[1:40:58] burdens take your rest amen if we can
[1:41:02] only realize that in in your situation
[1:41:05] whether You' got a death notice of
[1:41:07] cancer or you've had a wicked past or
[1:41:11] whether you've been abused or mistreated
[1:41:15] stop rest on your
[1:41:18] promise and say yes God knew all about
[1:41:21] this and and this is a path he's used to
[1:41:24] bring me to God but oh God now just let
[1:41:27] me rest in your
[1:41:29] promise amen you know many times we we
[1:41:33] have bad situations in our past and and
[1:41:36] things but remember it's those kind of
[1:41:39] things that brought us to
[1:41:42] God it's those difficult moments that we
[1:41:46] realize I need a
[1:41:47] savior I need
[1:41:52] Jesus amen last night as we entered the
[1:41:55] prayer line we prayed with Brother Ray
[1:41:58] Ericson for him and his wife Ruth you
[1:42:02] know they were just young people in
[1:42:04] their 20s when they embraced this
[1:42:08] truth many of us
[1:42:10] were we were just
[1:42:13] kids and brother Ry our senior pastor
[1:42:17] here be 86 years old this year they
[1:42:22] started out this
[1:42:23] this Christian Journey as young people I
[1:42:27] myself was a boy as I've told you in
[1:42:29] brother Brandon's meeting now we're old
[1:42:32] men and and I you know and
[1:42:36] we we're looking at the wings of the
[1:42:39] morning right the signs of the
[1:42:42] approaching son and we're saying hurry
[1:42:44] up
[1:42:45] son you know my time on Earth is about
[1:42:48] up and we're hearing the signs of the
[1:42:51] night or the sounds of the night and and
[1:42:53] the spirits of darkness and we're asking
[1:42:56] why is all this
[1:42:58] delay how come we have to continue to
[1:43:01] wait you know 60 years ago the prophetic
[1:43:05] voice like a morning star that Heralds a
[1:43:08] day come out and said
[1:43:12] Shalom good
[1:43:14] morning I'm catching the first raise of
[1:43:17] the coming
[1:43:18] son he ain't here yet but he's coming
[1:43:22] and I see the sign of it amen he says in
[1:43:25] Isaiah 60 And1 arise and shine for thy
[1:43:30] light is come and the glory of the Lord
[1:43:33] is risen upon thee for Behold The
[1:43:35] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[1:43:37] darkness of people but the Lord shall
[1:43:40] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[1:43:43] seen upon
[1:43:46] thee but here we are 60 years
[1:43:49] later looking for the night to be over
[1:43:53] yeah some of the darkest hours is just
[1:43:56] before the
[1:43:57] dawn and the world is getting darker and
[1:44:04] darker Peter explained the
[1:44:08] delay said first people are willingly
[1:44:14] ignorant they're willingly ignorant that
[1:44:17] God made the world and it belongs to God
[1:44:19] this is God's world this is God's Earth
[1:44:23] yeah and Satan will not rule here
[1:44:29] forever amen he he's got an expiration
[1:44:32] date on
[1:44:33] [Applause]
[1:44:34] him his kingdom has to come to an end he
[1:44:38] cannot rain forever the Bible said in
[1:44:42] Psalms 24 And1 the Earth is the Lords
[1:44:44] and the fullness thereof the world and
[1:44:46] they that dwelleth in there and for he
[1:44:48] founded it upon the Seas and established
[1:44:51] it on the floods
[1:44:53] right now Satan is a prince of darkness
[1:44:57] and he rules this Earth and it belongs
[1:45:01] the Earth belongs to God but he's a
[1:45:07] squatter he's a
[1:45:09] squatter and he but let let me tell you
[1:45:12] God's not going to give up on this
[1:45:14] Earth amen the Earth belongs to God I
[1:45:17] just read it in the Bible he will redeem
[1:45:20] it and he will live upon it with his
[1:45:22] people
[1:45:23] and I tell you from Divine intelligence
[1:45:26] the word of God says that Satan's Reign
[1:45:30] cannot continue
[1:45:33] forever so he says in second Peter 3
[1:45:36] and3 and this may be a little different
[1:45:38] translation but mostly most importantly
[1:45:41] I want to remind you that in the last
[1:45:42] days scoffers will
[1:45:44] come mocking the truth and following
[1:45:47] their own desires and they will say what
[1:45:49] happened to the promise that Jesus is
[1:45:51] coming again for from before the times
[1:45:54] of our ancestors everything has remained
[1:45:56] the same since the world was first
[1:45:59] created and they deliberately forget
[1:46:01] that God made the heavens Long Ago by
[1:46:03] the word of his command and he brought
[1:46:05] the Earth out from the water and
[1:46:07] surrounded it with water and then he
[1:46:09] used the water to destroy the ancient
[1:46:11] world with the mighty flood and by the
[1:46:13] same word the the he the present heavens
[1:46:16] and earth have been stored up for fire
[1:46:19] and they are kept for the day of
[1:46:21] judgment when ungodly men will be
[1:46:23] destroyed but you must not forget this
[1:46:25] one thing dear friends a day is like a
[1:46:29] thousand years to the Lord and a
[1:46:31] thousand years is like a day the Lord
[1:46:34] isn't really slow about his promise as
[1:46:37] some people think no he is being patient
[1:46:40] for your sake he does not want anyone to
[1:46:43] be destroyed but he wants everyone to
[1:46:46] repent what a gracious
[1:46:49] God what a God rich in Mercy
[1:46:53] what a God that isn't willing to give up
[1:46:56] on
[1:46:57] one that ain't going to leave a ho
[1:47:00] behind amen that he's going to redeem
[1:47:03] his children and take every one of them
[1:47:06] home amen but the day of the Lord will
[1:47:09] come as unexpectedly as a thief and then
[1:47:12] the heavens will pass away with the
[1:47:14] terrible noise and the elements
[1:47:17] themselves will disappear in fire in the
[1:47:19] earth and everything on it will be found
[1:47:21] to deserve judgment
[1:47:23] amen what other age tell me what other
[1:47:28] age could the Earth be destroyed with
[1:47:30] fire many times
[1:47:33] over the arsenals of just the US and
[1:47:37] Russia have enough to destroy this world
[1:47:40] over many
[1:47:43] times never in the history of the world
[1:47:46] have we been so close to the
[1:47:49] burning right we're right on the edge of
[1:47:52] this
[1:47:54] scripture this Earth is a Fallen Earth
[1:47:57] before it was like a
[1:47:59] millennium there was peace the lion but
[1:48:03] laid down by the lamb how do you know
[1:48:05] that brother Tim well that's the way
[1:48:07] it's going to be in the
[1:48:09] Millennium which is only a reflection of
[1:48:11] what the first day was before the fall
[1:48:15] right amen so the Earth is Fallen Earth
[1:48:19] and before then it was a millennium that
[1:48:21] was peace the line laid bound with the
[1:48:23] lamb and many you know many times people
[1:48:26] look at situations in their life and and
[1:48:28] they wonder why did God let this happen
[1:48:32] to
[1:48:33] me if he's God why did I suffer the way
[1:48:36] I
[1:48:37] do you know why did bad things happen to
[1:48:41] good
[1:48:42] people oh why did why did people abuse
[1:48:47] me well I mean the answer is really
[1:48:50] simple th this is not the millennium
[1:48:54] last time I
[1:48:56] checked now I know there's some people
[1:48:58] believe they're already in a new body
[1:49:00] but I ain't happy with
[1:49:06] mine you know they you know they but
[1:49:10] they look at it and they say why why why
[1:49:13] does this happen to me why why does
[1:49:15] tragedies happen why why do good men you
[1:49:18] know that that are preaching the gospel
[1:49:20] get cancer how come this happens to to
[1:49:23] to good people well when God made the
[1:49:27] Earth it was all
[1:49:29] perfect there was no sin there was no
[1:49:32] adultery there was no murder there was
[1:49:33] no sickness there was nobody ever hurt
[1:49:35] nothing could hurt or destroy in all his
[1:49:37] holy
[1:49:38] mountain you know that that you know but
[1:49:43] but man chose between
[1:49:45] life and the knowledge to know what good
[1:49:49] and evil
[1:49:51] is and now everything that we receive
[1:49:54] comes from that tree of knowledge and we
[1:49:58] come of that to know good and evil so
[1:50:02] everything good evil comes with
[1:50:04] it I mean you you can't even take any
[1:50:07] kind of medicine without looking at all
[1:50:09] the side
[1:50:10] effects something else is destroying
[1:50:12] your body these heart attacks this man
[1:50:14] has had because of the
[1:50:16] chemo the the dead pancreas that he has
[1:50:19] caus of the
[1:50:20] chemo you you see it's it's it it's
[1:50:23] knowledge and and here is fighting
[1:50:25] cancer and keeping that a bay while it's
[1:50:27] destroying the rest of the
[1:50:29] body amen now so everything we receive
[1:50:34] that is good evil comes with it it's
[1:50:37] it's a world with a
[1:50:39] mixture the good that wonderful moment
[1:50:42] that a baby is born the The Joy the
[1:50:47] excitement and with that same child one
[1:50:50] day evil will come and someone will lay
[1:50:53] it in a
[1:50:54] grave every young man standing before
[1:50:57] the altar with a pretty beautiful
[1:51:01] bride will one day close the other's
[1:51:04] eyes in
[1:51:09] death we don't think of that in that
[1:51:13] moment but some of us have lived to
[1:51:15] experience
[1:51:18] that Satan rules the Earth as a prince
[1:51:23] of this
[1:51:24] world and he gets into people and he
[1:51:26] hurts other
[1:51:28] people why won't God stop it he
[1:51:33] will but because man chose this when he
[1:51:37] chose to know good and evil God has
[1:51:40] allowed us to live in these decrepit and
[1:51:44] temporary
[1:51:46] bodies and he's put an expiration date

[1:53:31] knowledge and you can choose Satan and
[1:53:35] hell are God and Heaven right now we
[1:53:39] sing the song this world is not my home
[1:53:42] of course this Cosmos is not our home
[1:53:45] but this Earth is and those who go to
[1:53:48] heaven will only be there
[1:53:51] temporarily and because we will come
[1:53:53] right back here to live the Earth
[1:53:56] belongs to God and he redeems it as he
[1:53:59] did of in the days of Noah he flooded it
[1:54:03] and washed it clean he baptized it with
[1:54:07] water and then some thousand years later
[1:54:11] he comes along and he sheds his blood
[1:54:13] upon it and sanctifies that that's right
[1:54:17] amen and doing that he was claiming this
[1:54:20] Earth he was even claiming your body for
[1:54:24] the
[1:54:26] resurrection hallelujah amen claiming
[1:54:29] you amen your body oh thanks be to God
[1:54:33] am me claiming you to be the Temple of
[1:54:36] the Holy
[1:54:37] Ghost think about that a man or woman
[1:54:40] born in sin with Satan the ruler over
[1:54:43] their lives amen and then through the
[1:54:46] new birth Satan is dethroned and a new
[1:54:49] king come sit down upon your thr
[1:54:53] and these this mouth that used to curse
[1:54:56] now blesses God these hands that did
[1:54:59] Evil now raises our hands up to praise
[1:55:02] the name of the Living
[1:55:04] God
[1:55:06] hallelujah and it makes your
[1:55:10] cursers bless the name of the
[1:55:15] Lord but he said I'm going to redeem it
[1:55:18] I'm going to fix it I'm going to make it
[1:55:21] all over again again behold as he read
[1:55:24] last night I make all things
[1:55:27] new so
[1:55:29] therefore he baptized it with water he
[1:55:34] shed his blood upon it but he's got one
[1:55:37] more thing to do to
[1:55:38] it he's got to burn it with fire and out
[1:55:42] of that fire will birth a new world a
[1:55:45] new Heavens right A New Earth right now
[1:55:48] I know I'm jumbling some of the
[1:55:49] Millennium and and the and new heavens
[1:55:51] and earth together but you know we're
[1:55:53] just we're just not trying to to to
[1:55:56] cross every tea and Dot every eye right
[1:55:58] here you see but you see God does the
[1:56:00] same thing with you you come to
[1:56:03] repentance through the water through the
[1:56:06] sanctification of the blood then you
[1:56:08] come to receive his Spirit where God
[1:56:12] comes to live in you when he and when he
[1:56:15] does he's claiming your body for the
[1:56:19] resurrection that's right Amen brother
[1:56:22] ad tells us in the future home he said
[1:56:25] you know the heavens and the Earth will
[1:56:27] pass away with a great noise when it
[1:56:29] gets his new birth and he said if you
[1:56:32] think if you think that that the heavens
[1:56:35] and the Earth and make a great noise he
[1:56:37] said what about a man or woman when they
[1:56:40] get born again they make a great noise
[1:56:43] and the old thing pass away and behold
[1:56:46] All Things become
[1:56:48] new you're not born without emotion
[1:56:52] emotion is an it but you're not born
[1:56:54] without
[1:56:56] it it comes with it the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:00] not some sensation but it is
[1:57:07] Sensational it is not the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:10] not a feeling but brother you feel when
[1:57:13] it
[1:57:14] comes hallu it itself is not a feeling
[1:57:18] it's a person but when he comes in your
[1:57:21] life something
[1:57:23] happens it's not an imagination it's an
[1:57:28] experience where you meet God and the
[1:57:31] old life passes away behold all things
[1:57:35] and like the New Jerusalem God comes
[1:57:37] down to dwell within your
[1:57:41] heart well when Jesus went
[1:57:43] away two angels
[1:57:46] came and spoke with some of the 500 who
[1:57:49] saw him after his resurrection and the
[1:57:51] Bible say said in Acts one while they
[1:57:55] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[1:57:59] received him out of their
[1:58:00] sight behold two men stood by them in
[1:58:03] white
[1:58:04] apparel which also said you men of
[1:58:07] Galilee why stand you gazing up into
[1:58:10] heaven this same Jesus which is taken up
[1:58:13] from you into heaven shall Al so shall
[1:58:17] come in like manner as you have seen him
[1:58:20] go into heaven
[1:58:23] what a wonderful word Amen brother I
[1:58:26] tell you if I was standing there I would
[1:58:29] take it Jesus is coming in my
[1:58:32] lifetime I heard what the angel said I
[1:58:36] saw Jesus go away and he told me I would
[1:58:39] see him come in like
[1:58:43] manner but instead of coming if you read
[1:58:47] M Mark chapter 16 the Bible said that
[1:58:51] when he sended up he sat down on the
[1:58:54] right hand of the Majesty on
[1:58:57] high and there the book of Hebrews
[1:58:59] teaches as he becomes our intercessor he
[1:59:02] sat down on the right hand of majesty on
[1:59:04] high and became the intercessor between
[1:59:07] God and sinful
[1:59:11] man so he says in 2 Peter 3:14 wherefore
[1:59:15] beloved seeing that you look for such
[1:59:18] things be diligently that you be found
[1:59:21] of him and peace without spot and
[1:59:23] blameless and account that the
[1:59:25] longsuffering of our God is salvation so
[1:59:28] he said this Longs suffering that you're
[1:59:31] going through he said is actually
[1:59:34] salvation and so he says it again 1
[1:59:37] Peter 3:20 the long suffering of God
[1:59:39] waited in the days of Noah while the ark
[1:59:42] was a preparing wherein few that is AG
[1:59:46] Souls were saved by
[1:59:49] water well
[1:59:52] the
[1:59:56] longsuffering why why not come back
[1:59:59] then
[2:00:01] well I'll ask
[2:00:04] you what if Jesus had to come back then
[2:00:08] right what if you just close a book and
[2:00:11] say that's all my family taking them
[2:00:13] into the
[2:00:14] glory that's it these few Jews that were
[2:00:17] saved that's
[2:00:20] it it's over with
[2:00:24] but God had more in his mind there were
[2:00:28] more in his
[2:00:31] family you see I I I'm the fourth child
[2:00:34] in my family what if my my mother and
[2:00:37] dad would have said three kids is good
[2:00:41] enough we ain't going to have no fourth
[2:00:46] one like one family said I ain't having
[2:00:49] no fourth child cuz I hear that every
[2:00:52] fourth child born in the world's a
[2:00:53] chinan and I sure ain't having no
[2:00:58] well I'm the chinan in my
[2:01:03] family what if that had stopped at three
[2:01:05] I wouldn't have been here that's right
[2:01:07] what if God would have called a halt way
[2:01:09] back then you wouldn't be
[2:01:13] here Amen Brother Ray what if Jesus had
[2:01:16] come in
[2:01:18] 1967 when you embrac the message and and
[2:01:22] took this glorious truth and many of you
[2:01:24] wouldn't be
[2:01:26] here that's right but you see there were
[2:01:28] more names in the book that still had to
[2:01:31] be manifested on the
[2:01:33] earth and so we have waited on you to
[2:01:40] come you know when I started preaching
[2:01:42] in 1970 I was preaching his
[2:01:45] coming but he didn't come and thank God
[2:01:48] he didn't
[2:01:52] right you know one thing we thought cuz
[2:01:55] we had got the word brother we got the
[2:01:57] message that that was man we had it and
[2:02:00] we were ready to go we didn't realize it
[2:02:02] had to take on
[2:02:08] flesh come on Amen we just stopped cuz
[2:02:12] we started getting collections of books
[2:02:14] and tapes and whatever else and that
[2:02:16] buddy we had it we were ready to go we
[2:02:18] weren't
[2:02:22] God's got a lot more wisdom than we
[2:02:25] do amen we I have called a Hal a long
[2:02:27] time
[2:02:30] ago cuz I get in a
[2:02:33] hurry but you know the hours get weary
[2:02:36] and and and and long but the Bible said
[2:02:39] in Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore
[2:02:43] your confidence which has great
[2:02:45] recompense of
[2:02:47] reward in other words whatever you do
[2:02:49] don't lose confidence in the promise
[2:02:53] amen it's has great recompense of reward
[2:02:56] even listen even without a
[2:03:00] heaven even if there was no
[2:03:03] Rapture even if death ends in
[2:03:08] nothingness the way of a Christian Life
[2:03:11] Is A Better
[2:03:14] [Applause]
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:17] Way the way of God denying a man and a
[2:03:22] woman together in holy matrimony and
[2:03:25] raising up children is a better
[2:03:30] way amen the words of his commandment
[2:03:33] Thou shalt not kill or Thou shalt not
[2:03:35] steal is a better
[2:03:38] way so cast not away therefore your
[2:03:41] confidence which has great recompense of
[2:03:44] reward the Christian life has great
[2:03:48] recompense of reward even without heaven
[2:03:53] but heaven will be even a greater
[2:03:58] reward oh wonder what it'll be like when
[2:04:01] we get
[2:04:04] home for you need a patience that after
[2:04:07] you have done the will of God you might
[2:04:10] receive the promise you see so what you
[2:04:14] should seek for your life is God let me
[2:04:17] find your
[2:04:19] will amen you have a purpose you got a
[2:04:22] plan for my life and your longsuffering
[2:04:24] is allowed me to be here because my name
[2:04:27] was in the Lamb's Book of Life so let me
[2:04:30] find your will and let me find your
[2:04:33] purpose for my life for yet a little
[2:04:36] while and he that shall come will come
[2:04:39] and will not Cary now the just shall
[2:04:42] live by faith but if any man draw back
[2:04:45] my soul will have no pleasure in him the
[2:04:49] just or the righteous shall live by
[2:04:51] faith
[2:04:53] I don't understand sometimes I just
[2:04:58] trust I just
[2:05:01] rest I just take another
[2:05:04] step I understand life
[2:05:07] situations and I'm going forward I'm not
[2:05:09] going
[2:05:10] backwards many times we're standing at
[2:05:13] Red Sea
[2:05:15] moments and here we're surrounded in
[2:05:17] every way but you don't know which way
[2:05:19] to turn but just go forward
[2:05:22] you don't know how it's going to open up
[2:05:24] you don't know how it's going to come
[2:05:26] but you just know he put a promise in
[2:05:28] the word there's a promised land before
[2:05:30] us and we just take another
[2:05:35] step amen knowing he made the promise
[2:05:38] I'm going to take you to that Promised
[2:05:40] Land you know and so therefore I won't
[2:05:42] go back to Egypt I will not surrender to
[2:05:45] the world no I'm going through Jesus yes
[2:05:50] I'm going through
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:53] so Peter says in in in the scripture he
[2:05:57] said as you wait for the day of God do
[2:06:01] your best or you do your part to make it
[2:06:05] come
[2:06:07] soon all right the day when the heavens
[2:06:10] will burn up and be destroyed and the
[2:06:14] heavenly bodies will be melted by the
[2:06:16] heat well I know many anxious hearts
[2:06:22] And Delay sometimes can be so
[2:06:25] frustrating so
[2:06:28] upsetting but there's always been a
[2:06:34] delay of course we
[2:06:36] get weary of the night we long for it to
[2:06:40] be
[2:06:41] over it seems like the longer we go the
[2:06:44] longer we
[2:06:46] wait the more difficult it
[2:06:50] is however ever we are living in the
[2:06:54] Fulfillment of the word of God I I I
[2:06:56] just want to point to you some things as
[2:06:59] we see the signs of the
[2:07:02] morning we are living in the Fulfillment
[2:07:04] of the word of God after a long delay of
[2:07:06] 2,000 years for this is the age where
[2:07:09] many scriptures and all types and
[2:07:13] shadows are being
[2:07:16] fulfilled you
[2:07:17] know things can happen and rock rock
[2:07:21] along long rather and and nothing seemed
[2:07:23] like it's happening but it's as it was
[2:07:25] in the days of Noah the Bible said while
[2:07:28] the ark Was preparing while things were
[2:07:31] being made ready for the great climatic
[2:07:34] change that was going to happen you see
[2:07:37] certain things had to be in place it's
[2:07:39] kind of like brother bisc you know going
[2:07:41] out uh there with a green checkered
[2:07:43] shirt having it you know not even
[2:07:46] knowing he brought it along and here was
[2:07:48] a vision and he was a you know on that
[2:07:51] vision there's going to be an animal
[2:07:52] with panel horns and and uh some kind of
[2:07:55] animal like that be 42 in long and you
[2:07:58] know the the details of it there'd be a
[2:08:00] Grizzly a silver tip Grizzly I I would I
[2:08:04] would um um I I'll kill and and uh you
[2:08:08] know and there's a man right about that
[2:08:10] time before it comes there'll be a man
[2:08:12] step out he'll have a green checkered
[2:08:14] shirt on you see everything had to come
[2:08:18] to place in the vision
[2:08:27] sometimes people misjudge the prophet of
[2:08:31] God about the visions and that's pretty
[2:08:35] dumb to
[2:08:36] do because again you know many people
[2:08:40] have never had a vision so how in the
[2:08:41] world you're going to tell somebody how
[2:08:43] to have one or how it
[2:08:48] works pretty dumb
[2:08:54] just put your hand to your your finger
[2:08:55] your head and say
[2:09:04] Mt you know it's it's like the brown
[2:09:08] bear Vision brother brandham had you
[2:09:10] know and and and he saw and and he saw
[2:09:13] that he was to get a brown bear and and
[2:09:16] and um you know I've been in pastor's um
[2:09:19] offices where it says Visions never fail
[2:09:21] in a in an image or a statue of a brown
[2:09:24] bear and so on and and and you know
[2:09:27] things like that and I was I was coming
[2:09:30] along studying the message of brother
[2:09:33] brandham in chronological order and and
[2:09:36] as I was just going from place to place
[2:09:38] with him he goes to Port Albini and
[2:09:41] different places in Canada then he comes
[2:09:43] back home and he says you know I I I
[2:09:45] missed a vision first time I've done it
[2:09:47] in years he said the vision transpired
[2:09:50] right in front of me and he said or
[2:09:52] right before us and he said I wasn't at
[2:09:54] the right place at the right
[2:09:56] time I failed to be God brought his part
[2:09:59] to pass but I failed to do mine I didn't
[2:10:03] listen to
[2:10:08] him and so brother randam you know in
[2:10:11] that he he tells about I I call I was
[2:10:14] actually in 1989 I was with brother bcll
[2:10:18] and I was I preached a a meeting for him
[2:10:20] there and and um we were watching the
[2:10:22] northern lights on the way home as I'd
[2:10:24] never seen them I'm a southern boy and I
[2:10:27] was watching these northern lights
[2:10:28] flicker in the darkness and we just kind
[2:10:29] of pulled off the side and and I said
[2:10:32] brother bisc I've been watching I've
[2:10:34] been listening to the the the port
[2:10:36] Albini and this those sermons was was
[2:10:39] you with Brother brandom at that time he
[2:10:41] said yes yes I said did y'all go hunting
[2:10:44] afterwards he said yes yes he said well
[2:10:47] uh well I said well what about the the
[2:10:51] brown bear did you he said I saw that
[2:10:53] brown
[2:10:54] bear and I said you did tell me about it
[2:10:59] by the way when I went home I wrote it
[2:11:01] down exactly what he told
[2:11:03] me and then many years later when he
[2:11:06] came out and told about it himself I
[2:11:08] just got my notes out it was exactly
[2:11:10] what he said he didn't make up no
[2:11:12] stories
[2:11:15] right so anyway as I as I he told me you
[2:11:19] know he said brother Bram had told about
[2:11:21] the vision and thought maybe you know
[2:11:24] could happen on this trip and you know
[2:11:27] we uh we we would the boy said they were
[2:11:30] teasing us the older guys teasing us
[2:11:32] younger guys oh y you'reall too scared
[2:11:34] to go in the woods by yourself you know
[2:11:35] you're just a bunch of Cheers you know
[2:11:38] you you're you're just young kids and so
[2:11:41] him and him brother Bram and and um Bud
[2:11:45] South was making fun of Blaine and Eddie
[2:11:47] and saying you know Billy and saying you
[2:11:49] know you're you're not grown up like us
[2:11:51] you know so the next day they went out
[2:11:54] and but said well I'm taking brother
[2:11:56] brand this way and you boys go that way
[2:11:59] brother bram's goes with bud and here he
[2:12:03] goes and you have brother brandham on
[2:12:05] tape saying the Holy Spirit kept nudging
[2:12:07] me to go with those younger
[2:12:09] Fells but he said I didn't want to hurt
[2:12:12] that other brother's
[2:12:15] feelings and he said I missed a vision
[2:12:18] and he said God I did not behave as a
[2:12:20] ser of God I didn't do what you told me
[2:12:23] to do I didn't listen to The Obedience
[2:12:26] let me tell you something it wasn't
[2:12:28] really important whether or not to get a
[2:12:31] bear but don't miss the the the
[2:12:34] visitation of those seven angels I'm
[2:12:37] going to send you and you're going to
[2:12:39] have to get up and move from Indiana all
[2:12:42] the way to Tucson and it's going to be a
[2:12:45] colossal thing but what have you do you
[2:12:47] can you can miss a brown bear but don't
[2:12:49] you miss this
[2:12:53] on that's it and brother brother brother
[2:12:58] Bisal said while we was out there we saw
[2:12:59] that bear and he said we thought man if
[2:13:02] we can get brother brandom here we'll go

[2:15:11] and whipped around on those little
[2:15:13] branches and there was not even a drop

[2:17:33] flood there was no rain there was no
[2:17:35] clouds there was no Thunder there was no
[2:17:37] warnings other than a prophet's Voice
[2:17:40] who with Divine intelligence had warned
[2:17:42] them and told them and the day probably
[2:17:44] began like a another usual day the
[2:17:48] Rapture is going to take place like
[2:17:50] another usual ual day it ain't going to
[2:17:52] be car wrecks and airplanes crashing and

[2:19:02] story autonomous cars a plane that could
[2:19:04] even well even with the the right
[2:19:07] Brothers aren't that far behind us men
[2:19:09] flying in the sky much less a
[2:19:15] pilotless that was fiction back then and
[2:19:18] maybe the church world has taken this as
[2:19:20] is fiction but it's not fiction amen
[2:19:23] it's not it's not it's a Divine
[2:19:26] intelligence has told us that we're here
[2:19:29] and we have arrived and we're at the end
[2:19:32] time we know in that day halfway
[2:19:35] Believers stood around the heart AR and
[2:19:37] said hey you know might have been right
[2:19:40] maybe the old man was you know I helped
[2:19:42] build that church I I was a deacon there
[2:19:44] I was I mean how many have we seen Fall
[2:19:47] Away deacons trustees and yeah
[2:19:53] this one and that one even
[2:19:58] preachers the Bible prophesies of
[2:20:01] it so you say he tells you what would
[2:20:03] happen in this last
[2:20:05] day but you know God is always right on
[2:20:08] time he is never too late nothing's out
[2:20:11] of order you think sometimes it's all
[2:20:14] out of order brother Tim I mean surely
[2:20:16] it would be over by now but even like
[2:20:18] the three Hebrew children he he might
[2:20:21] even wait till your thrown in the fire
[2:20:23] but he'll be right there on
[2:20:24] time amen you might be like Daniel and
[2:20:27] the Lion's Den but he's right there on
[2:20:30] time but we've got so much that God has
[2:20:33] done at his age and yet we have not yet
[2:20:36] seen full and total fulfillment you know
[2:20:39] you you you see how he's worked setting
[2:20:42] up end time events and searching the
[2:20:45] scriptures we can see all the types of
[2:20:47] the Bible whether it be of women such as
[2:20:49] Ruth or Rahab or Esther or Virgin Mary
[2:20:53] or men like
[2:20:55] Enoch
[2:20:58] Abraham Moses with the Exodus Joshua
[2:21:03] with with the placing into the
[2:21:05] inheritance every one of them were
[2:21:09] pointing through this
[2:21:10] hour and we can actually spend hours and
[2:21:13] hours on these Bible
[2:21:15] characters we can talk about Samson you
[2:21:19] know how that you know he is a type of
[2:21:21] the church and and and and and even you
[2:21:24] are typed in Samson and the church just
[2:21:27] come through playing with the harlots
[2:21:28] and all the other thing and lost its
[2:21:30] power but that's not the end of them
[2:21:33] that's amen there's a new crop that is
[2:21:36] growing amen there is a people coming
[2:21:39] back into the Covenant strength is
[2:21:41] returning into the body the Rapture is
[2:21:44] at hand and we're going to destroy
[2:21:46] Satan's kingdom as we leave here
[2:21:52] amen hallelujah
[2:21:55] amen God is a god of
[2:21:58] restorer brother brandham said that Holy
[2:22:00] Ghost would strike a little church
[2:22:01] that's coming out of the world women
[2:22:03] that's got wees long hair and nazarites
[2:22:06] to prove they separated themselves from
[2:22:07] the world but each of these lives were
[2:22:11] prophesying of this day because their
[2:22:13] lives were not just an
[2:22:15] event in history but their lives were
[2:22:18] prophesying
[2:22:22] of the very hour that we're living amen
[2:22:25] I submit to you today that the
[2:22:28] Bible every Prophecy in the Bible is
[2:22:32] pointing right
[2:22:34] here
[2:22:35] amen Jesus would look in the scripture
[2:22:38] himself and he would tell us search the
[2:22:41] scriptures for he said they testify
[2:22:46] me and and no doubt he had been doing
[2:22:49] the same thing because he looked into
[2:22:51] Jonah uh and he didn't see himself in
[2:22:54] the negative he didn't see himself as a
[2:22:56] backsliding
[2:22:58] prophet that's right running from the
[2:23:00] presence of the Lord that's not the part
[2:23:02] he saw in there you know some people go
[2:23:04] look in it and get a negative well I can
[2:23:06] never be saved brother Tim I'm that Cain
[2:23:09] in the Bible I said what I'm no
[2:23:14] Cain you're no can that's not the part
[2:23:17] where to be fulfilled
[2:23:21] well C didn't even have a chance oh yes
[2:23:23] he
[2:23:26] did oh yes he did said don't you know if
[2:23:28] you do right you'll be accepted just
[2:23:30] come the way that Abel did humble
[2:23:32] yourself down don't you see I have
[2:23:34] accepted this sacrifice just come and
[2:23:37] sacrifice away
[2:23:42] no he
[2:23:44] chose the wrong
[2:23:47] way right you don't have to choose that
[2:23:52] way choose
[2:23:54] life like I said you're between you well
[2:23:57] I don't even have a choice I'm
[2:23:58] predestinated I don't never even have a
[2:24:01] choice no you are
[2:24:04] predestinated and God does revealed it
[2:24:06] to you upon your new
[2:24:09] birth but until
[2:24:12] then you don't know
[2:24:15] it and the devil don't know
[2:24:19] it I I sometimes think the devil gets a
[2:24:22] little idea that you might be like the
[2:24:24] woman at the well he kind of had a
[2:24:26] figured out there's something about this
[2:24:27] girl I tell you what I'll smutter with
[2:24:29] sin so bad she can never
[2:24:32] believe but I'll tell you no matter how
[2:24:35] dark her life
[2:24:36] was amen how wrong she was there was a
[2:24:40] Divine appointment for her life and the
[2:24:43] same one that in the beginning said let
[2:24:45] there be light and there was light came
[2:24:48] and said let there be light and there
[2:24:50] light upon a predestinated seed and that
[2:24:53] woman said come see a man who told me
[2:24:56] the things I've done isn't this the
[2:24:59] [Applause]
[2:25:05] Messiah
[2:25:07] amen the devil don't know only God does
[2:25:10] preachers don't know only God
[2:25:13] does that's right I'm going to heaven
[2:25:16] cuz my preacher told me so no you're
[2:25:19] not no no preacher knows you're going to
[2:25:21] heaven or we stand up man this guy's
[2:25:24] going to heaven you know he died he was
[2:25:26] faithful we don't
[2:25:29] know that person was so wicked we don't
[2:25:32] know his last
[2:25:36] moments you you know the Bible said all
[2:25:39] judgment is given to the son so why are
[2:25:42] you
[2:25:43] judging just put him in the hands of God
[2:25:45] so well my son he died and he wasn't a
[2:25:47] real Christian brother Tim put him in
[2:25:49] the hands of Jesus nobody can treat him
[2:25:52] any better than
[2:25:53] Jesus nobody is more fairer than Jesus I
[2:25:58] me you know just decide I don't have to
[2:26:00] make a decision on this I just put him
[2:26:02] in the hands of Jesus that's
[2:26:08] all I'm going down Pastor I don't know
[2:26:11] why I'm going down today but
[2:26:13] anyway amen like a sewer he just goes He
[2:26:17] sews seed and here there
[2:26:20] but but Jesus could see himself in the
[2:26:22] scripture and he would say as Jonah was
[2:26:25] in the belly of the well three days and
[2:26:27] three
[2:26:28] nights amen he said so will the son of
[2:26:31] man be in the heart of the earth and he
[2:26:34] will
[2:26:35] raise he saw himself in the scripture
[2:26:38] you see we are looking back and this is
[2:26:41] what it does when God has opened the
[2:26:43] book to us why we see Abraham not as
[2:26:46] just a story in the Bible not just as a
[2:26:49] somebody body's inheritance and then you
[2:26:51] know you know whoop dooo my your your
[2:26:54] your grandfather great great great with
[2:26:56] George Washington whoopy
[2:26:58] dooo who
[2:27:00] cares Abraham who cares no God put this
[2:27:04] in there and he was showing a prophecy
[2:27:07] in this man's life that somebody was
[2:27:11] going in this day in their old age this
[2:27:13] old 2,000 year old Sarah that can't get
[2:27:18] around is somebody with me is going to
[2:27:21] straighten up and be
[2:27:23] changed and she's expecting a child
[2:27:27] after 2,000 years of baress there is a
[2:27:30] bride coming into
[2:27:32] [Applause]
[2:27:36] being there's an expected woman on the
[2:27:39] scene amen and this we heard last night
[2:27:43] and the as the spirit of God moved among
[2:27:45] you it was just the baby kicking in the
[2:27:48] womb it's the signs of Life coming forth
[2:27:52] amen we're about to give birth to the
[2:27:55] coming of the Lord Jesus hallelujah what
[2:27:58] a day we're living
[2:28:00] in but we're living in a day where
[2:28:02] multitudes of hundreds of thousands of
[2:28:05] scriptures that have been pointing to
[2:28:07] this hour is being
[2:28:09] fulfilled scriptures that late dormant
[2:28:12] in the Bible for thousands of years
[2:28:15] behold I sended you Elijah the prophet
[2:28:18] before the coming of the Great and The
[2:28:19] Dread ful day of the Lord he'll turn the
[2:28:22] hearts of the children back to the faith
[2:28:24] of the fathers or I'll Smite the Earth
[2:28:27] with a curse he prefaces all of that
[2:28:30] behold the Earth will burn like an oven
[2:28:33] and all that are proud and do wickedly
[2:28:35] will burn like a
[2:28:37] stubble amen but that those who fear my
[2:28:40] name will the son of righteousness arise
[2:28:44] there be morning dawn upon them and they
[2:28:46] will rise with healing in their wings
[2:28:50] Hallelujah the son of righteousness
[2:28:52] bringing
[2:28:53] healing that's what this message done
[2:28:55] for me prophetic ey looked out there in
[2:28:59] Joel's prophecy and saw you coming and
[2:29:02] said in the last days I'll pour out my
[2:29:04] spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and my
[2:29:08] daughters shall prophesy my old the old
[2:29:11] men shall dream dreams and young men
[2:29:13] shall see
[2:29:15] vision and all my handmaids and my
[2:29:17] daughters my sons I'll pour out my
[2:29:19] spirit
[2:29:20] and here you are today fulfilling that
[2:29:24] scripture it's come alive in
[2:29:27] you prophetic eye come and gave us
[2:29:32] intelligence and so what happened in the
[2:29:34] Bible would go all the way back to the
[2:29:36] serpent all the way down Trail him all
[2:29:39] the way down to the scripture to the end
[2:29:41] age a prophetic eye of God's
[2:29:44] intelligence you know we're not in the
[2:29:46] first of the
[2:29:48] Bible where it starts out in the
[2:29:50] beginning
[2:29:51] God we are in the last of the scripture
[2:29:55] we're the last prayer of the Bible that
[2:29:58] said even so come Lord Jesus because
[2:30:00] that prayer is going to be answered in
[2:30:02] this day for a group of people who are
[2:30:04] alive and remain for the coming of the
[2:30:06] Lord so you are not you are not living
[2:30:09] at the beginning of the book you're
[2:30:11] living over here in the end of the book
[2:30:13] where the last prayer is being fulfilled
[2:30:17] as we
[2:30:18] speak
[2:30:22] am we are the continuation of the book
[2:30:24] of Acts we're not writing a new book of
[2:30:27] Acts as if it's another book but it's
[2:30:30] the same Holy Spirit continuing his
[2:30:33] ministry so we're here in the end of the
[2:30:36] Bible writing the last acts of the holy
[2:30:39] spirit in the Gentile
[2:30:42] bride now so here we are at this time
[2:30:47] wherever Bible promise that's been spoke
[2:30:50] of the Bride is being fulfilled right
[2:30:53] now in this day it is a day that God has
[2:30:57] done and it's doing many mighty
[2:31:00] wonderful things because it's not all
[2:31:02] just past God continues to work as all
[2:31:05] the events that begins to be wound up
[2:31:09] that has to do with the coming of the
[2:31:11] Lord when you think about it in his
[2:31:13] first coming the the scripture had lay
[2:31:17] dormant there for many many years
[2:31:20] of promises that were given for example
[2:31:24] you know I I can imagine Isaiah standing
[2:31:28] there that day and he said behold I a
[2:31:30] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[2:31:33] son you know he he told him here's a
[2:31:35] sign you want to sign I'll give you
[2:31:37] one and out of his mouth said a virgin
[2:31:40] shall conceive well that wouldn't be 700
[2:31:43] years for it be
[2:31:45] fulfilled but it had to be
[2:31:48] spoken and a promise given it had to it
[2:31:52] had to prepare put scriptures there and
[2:31:56] lay them for the Messiah to come are you
[2:31:58] with me now and so you see from Malachi
[2:32:02] to John the Baptist there was hardly
[2:32:05] nothing that God
[2:32:06] spoke if you go from here to the Old
[2:32:10] Testament to the New Testament there's
[2:32:12] nearly 500 years that there was not a
[2:32:16] prophet not a prophecy
[2:32:20] come on not a word from
[2:32:24] God for 500
[2:32:28] years it looked like nothing was
[2:32:30] happening but all the time things were
[2:32:33] getting into place Daniel's vision's
[2:32:36] coming in the part there's got to be got
[2:32:39] got to be the red dragon that at Rome
[2:32:41] that is going to step up into place it's
[2:32:44] got to be in this position this has got
[2:32:46] to be here this the vision you see it
[2:32:48] it's like like when said the green shirt

[2:35:29] happening in this Supernatural boy but
[2:35:32] you know but we don't really see nothing
[2:35:35] and you know God has given us a time of
[2:35:37] of growth where the word is taken on
[2:35:40] flesh where the the people who coming to
[2:35:44] know their God who established dress

[2:36:25] elect getting ready for the Messiah to
[2:36:28] come making the path

[2:48:19] life begins to end the process of the
[2:48:22] end time this is a process of things
[2:48:24] being
[2:48:25] fulfilled and we're in the process of
[2:48:33] fulfillment and when the 7eventh seal
[2:48:35] was
[2:48:37] open the Bible said that there was
[2:48:41] incense that was mixed with the prayers
[2:48:43] of the
[2:48:45] Saints now it could be a million miles
[2:48:48] off if I am forgive me and we'll just go
[2:48:50] on be
[2:48:51] friends but I just look at it like
[2:48:55] this I think of one prayer that's never
[2:48:59] been
[2:49:01] fulfilled it's the last prayer of the
[2:49:04] Bible even so come Lord
[2:49:12] Jesus and the Bible tells us that when
[2:49:14] the seventh seal was open it was mixed
[2:49:16] with the prayers of the Saints I submit
[2:49:18] to you that in every age down there they
[2:49:21] all prayed for his
[2:49:22] coming they all wanted him to come in
[2:49:25] their generation I want him now right
[2:49:27] now I want him to come
[2:49:29] today but he didn't but God has to
[2:49:32] answer those
[2:49:35] prayers come on Amen but at the right
[2:49:38] time he couldn't answer it back then if
[2:49:40] he answered it back then he had call the
[2:49:41] role it all been over you wouldn't be
[2:49:43] here but there Comes A Time amen the
[2:49:47] last day where he mixes it with the
[2:49:50] incense and it goes into the heavens and
[2:49:54] when it
[2:49:56] does God throws down lightning and
[2:50:00] thunderings and
[2:50:04] voices and the end time
[2:50:09] Begins the end time begins and Jesus has
[2:50:13] started answering the prayer for his
[2:50:16] coming by sending Malachi 4
[2:50:19] by sending a prophet in this last day by
[2:50:22] restoring the word by restoring
[2:50:25] you am by turning your heart back to
[2:50:28] believing again amen by come on this is
[2:50:31] what he's been doing he's been restoring
[2:50:34] you you're part of that restoration
[2:50:36] you're part of that coming he's been
[2:50:38] coming into your life changing your life
[2:50:42] making Sons and Daughters of God out of
[2:50:46] you and he said into motion
[2:50:49] the end time
[2:50:51] process and we come down to the
[2:50:56] end when will morning
[2:50:59] come well let's go back 2,000 years
[2:51:03] ago the Saints had been sleeping a long
[2:51:07] time first one
[2:51:09] laid into that place of
[2:51:14] resting first one was
[2:51:17] Abel he would be followed by
[2:51:19] others they would all be waiting for the
[2:51:25] Messiah they had received the promise
[2:51:27] then he's going to come he's going to
[2:51:30] come as the seed of a
[2:51:33] woman surely this was
[2:51:36] it
[2:51:38] even you know even Eve would get
[2:51:40] confused on
[2:51:41] that they would think oh this is him
[2:51:44] here's the one here's the Manchild here
[2:51:46] here's the seed that that is going to
[2:51:48] correct what the serpent did and it
[2:51:50] winds up being
[2:51:54] gain there's a
[2:51:58] delay Abel Waits until at the sacrifice
[2:52:02] that he offered was prophesying of a
[2:52:04] lamb that would come and shed its
[2:52:07] blood
[2:52:09] now they
[2:52:11] wait then others gather Abraham will
[2:52:15] gather
[2:52:17] there I Isaac and Jacob
[2:52:21] Joseph Great Men
[2:52:25] prophets Ezekiel Jeremiah yes all the
[2:52:29] way down to Malachi and others that
[2:52:33] believed under that blood
[2:52:36] offering of bulls and
[2:52:41] goats and it was a dark hour it so
[2:52:44] dark They Crucified their Messiah
[2:52:48] like this day is so dark they crucify
[2:52:50] the word in this Darkness amen so dark
[2:52:55] and he lay in a
[2:53:01] tomb while no one knows what's going on
[2:53:04] on the
[2:53:05] earth something's happening in that
[2:53:07] other
[2:53:09] realm Abraham wakes up

[3:06:41] many people see the evil that was in the
[3:06:44] days of Noah but brother brah said don't
[3:06:46] fail to see
[3:06:48] that in the days of Noah was also his
[3:06:50] days of
[3:06:51] longsuffering and we're living in the
[3:06:53] days of the longsuffering of God and we
[3:06:55] thank God you know in the hands of ease
[3:06:59] interpreter as he always tries to
[3:07:01] interpret everything in the hands of
[3:07:03] ease interpreter God ain't kept his word
[3:07:06] he's left us here he's not going to move
[3:07:09] it's not in in the hands of that
[3:07:11] interpreter but in the hands of the
[3:07:13] interpretation of the word of God God's
[3:07:16] raised up men of God like our brother
[3:07:18] Tim to take the word and speak of God's
[3:07:21] interpretation amen of the time period
[3:07:23] we're here has nothing to do with God
[3:07:26] lacking and promise but it's the
[3:07:28] longsuffering of God that our children
[3:07:31] would receive the Holy Ghost and the
[3:07:33] manifestation of the word would come
[3:07:35] into fruti and how the word would live
[3:07:37] up in life and and the time that we have
[3:07:40] here it's so it's so sacred the hour is
[3:07:43] so sacred we feel the wings of the
[3:07:46] morning as it rushes in and and and it's
[3:07:49] as though that we're Rising with it and
[3:07:53] with every breath of it amen we get
