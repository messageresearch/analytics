========================================

I've anchored my soul in the [singing] heaven of rest. [music] I'll serve the wise seas no more. [music] The tempest [music] may sweet or the [music] &gt;&gt; brother Wayne Jesus [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; I'm safe [singing] ever [music] more. Oh, I [singing] may turn my [music] soul in [singing] the heaven. [music] I'll say [singing] [music] the wild [singing] sea. No more the tempest [singing] on [music] the day. This makes sweet for the wild stormy [music] in Jesus. [singing] I'll sing [music] [music] as we come together this morning on a Sunday morning. One of my favorite, it is my favorite service of the week is Sunday mornings. I often think of the resurrection and what it what it means to us as believers and Amen. So, you know, I was just um I was just reading uh the prophet saying this morning he was looking in the book of Hebrews and he he called the Bible. He said this is himself in print. He said, "So, when we read it, he said we'd like to stand together." So, if if I could get you to stand one more time. Amen. We're going to uh just have a word of prayer and then we would like to read the scriptures. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts. Father, we thank you today for your grace upon us, Lord, for this gathering of people. We thank you for the great Holy Spirit, Lord, which you have put in our midst and in our hearts today. Father, we ask that you would just lead us now. And father, as we would come to your word, Lord, that you would take your word, that you would touch your children, you would bless them, Father. We ask you to be the voice behind the voice, may you speak to the individual needs that's in this building today. Father, now we ask it, Lord, for your grace. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. And if you have your Bibles today, I would like to turn into the book of Hebrews, the first chapter. And I want to read Hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 and two. Um I don't know that I'll take every service uh on these uh but I would like to take at least the next couple services, Lord willing, Sunday and then again Thursday uh upon these first two verses. There's so much here. Um I don't think that it's quite possible uh that we would be able to cover it all. Uh at least not if we keep within kind of keep within the times, amen, of something that we are comfortable with. Amen. So in Hebrews chapter 1:es 1 and:es 2. Now God who at sunundra times and in diverse manners he spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets. But he hath in this last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom he also made the worlds. Amen. God bless you this morning. As you could be seated, I uh just like to if I could to speak to you a little bit here. I'm going to get situated in a moment. We were trying something new and it's not working out. Amen. So, amen. So, in Hebrews chapter 1, uh I I I just uh speaking Thursday along this line, something really just striking my heart personally. Um and uh you can take the crowd out of that a little bit, Ben, wherever you are. Just take the crowd out. Thank you. Amen. Um, so you can see it and uh I was just thinking about this the book of Hebrews and uh something really just striking my heart that we were that we uh would seeing the deepness and the richness of this book and just introducing a little bit if you wasn't here Thursday uh we we spent quite a bit of time on introducing it. So I don't want to reiterate a lot of that but I will say that uh some of the things that brother Brandham had to say about the book of Hebrews is number one he said that the book of Hebrews was written by Paul and he said I think with some spiritual discernment he said I think we could say that that it was written by Paul and then he turned around again and said well maybe not exactly just written by Paul he said but you know uh he said that but the beginning of the scripture says that God who it's under a time so he said, "You can see then it wasn't just Paul that wrote it, but it was a creative being inside of Paul that was using Paul to write the scriptures." Amen. That it was uh God who had sundra time. So, it's a very deep and rich book. Brother Brandham actually calls it the key letter that Paul wrote because it's a letter that is separating the law from the grace. And what it's actually is is it's a dispensational book. It's it's it's changing of dispensation from law unto grace which has given us a a reality. Amen. That God uh is still as much God as he ever was God. But he is changing dispensations. Now we are dispensationalists. We believe in dispensations. And uh maybe on Thursday I'll get deeper into this. But in dispensations we certainly believe in them. uh because here in the scripture it begins by saying God who at sunund times and diverse manner spake in times past and it it literally means by many portions by many times by many ways but it it just is singular God by many portions by many times by many ways has been the one speaking and it's amazing as Paul would say this and then in Hebrews 13:8 Paul will nail down that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever. So he remains the same even though he speaks in many portions. He's the same God. If he speaks in many ways, he's the same God. He speaks in many times, but he's the same God. Because it's God that is doing the speaking, he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. One thing that we've learned uh throughout the years of studying brother Brandham of course and studying scripture in the light of truth of dispensations we have found out that God's nature never changes. His attitude never changes. It's just his mask or his form is the only thing that actually changes about God. He appears in many different forms remaining the same in attitude, the same in power and the same except for the corporal body. Jesus Christ is the same right here this morning as he was when he walked on the shores of Galilee. He's the same Jesus right here this morning. He's just as live and just as real as he ever is. He is here in another form in another dimension. Amen. Unseen by the eye, but the prophet said by a new birth, you could feel the charge when he steps into the room. Amen. Of course. Amen. The scripture tells us, amen, that God who at Sundra times, now when you think about God who in sundra times, the Bible said many times, many ways, diver manners, he spake in times past. Do you know God can still speak? &gt;&gt; God was speaking back in those days and God can still speak. Amen. As he spake in times fast. Now, in the Old Testament, we're taught that there's three different ways that God was speaking. Amen. and and we found out, brother Bam says we learned, he says that there was three ways to know whether it was God doing the speaking or whether it was man. Now, that's the probably one of the greatest criterias of a believer is to have discernment of what is it you're hearing. Because of course, just because you hear a voice don't mean that you automatically believe that voice. Amen. For the scripture said you should try the spirits. Amen. And so there should be some way. You remember Paul begins or excuse me, John writing the book of Revelations and he starts right there in the first chapters and he said there's many who say they're apostles but they're not. Amen. And and and he says it sounds like you're trying them but you wasn't trying them. You was trying them by the word. You let the word do the trying to determine whether you're hearing from someone who is of God or if it's a different spirit. The spirit of truth, the spirit of error. But in the Old Testament, we could learn whether it was God or not speaking for first it was by a dreamer. See, uh, Brother Bam says like you take it was a dreamer and and and and you take a dreamer that would come or a prophet. He says, uh, if you wanted to see it was right or not, you could take it to the breastplate of Aaron, which they actually called the urum of thumb. How many ever seen pictures that was recreated of the urum of thumb? Actually, it was the breastplate of the high priest of Aaron. It was embedded with 12 different stones. And those stones were each one represented under the birth of the 12 tribes of Israel. And and whenever there was a prophet or a dreamer that dreamed or prophesied, they would speak that over that ura mathum. And if it was from God, the lights would flash across it and it would speak to them that yes, this is God. And if it wasn't of God, then they would usually stone the speaker to death because they were trying to bring deception. Now the prophet teaches us very clearly that though the priesthood changed and the yurma thumbum the breastplate was done away with but a new priesthood has a new uromum and the yurmothum of the modern man of the modern church amen is the bible. The bible is the uromothum. So the things that is spoken must flash a light across the Bible. Not across one scripture, but it must dovetail a truth throughout the Bible from the book of Genesis all the way to the book of Revelations. It should dovetail itself if it is truth. Now of course that the Aionic priesthood and under that Levitical law they had the ways that they would do it. See prophets or preachers or dreamers or any of them had to try what they were doing. But there see there is a difference between uh uh maybe just a spirit of prophecy or a minor prophet than there is a major prophet. I mean he realizes the Bible makes a difference in this when he speaks there in the book of Exodus talking about Moses. He said see there's many people prophets who see dreams and have prophecies. He said but now Moses is different. I speak mouthtomouth with Moses and and and and Moses was an actual vindicated prophet. In other words, Moses was born a prophet. Do you KNOW THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE in the spirit of prophecy and a prophet? How many knows that's the truth? There's a big difference. AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF prophecy is a spirit that comes upon them. In the Old Testament, like Saul, a king, would go among them and they could get under the spirit of prophecy and prophesy, but they wasn't actually a prophet. We've seen it in modern times under the gifts of the spirit under the Pentecostals where there was the spirit of prophecy will fall on the congregation. And because we're all believers, do you know the spirit of prophecy can work on any believer in the church that has the Holy Ghost? How many knows that's right? But just because the spirit of prophecy works on you doesn't make you a prophet. &gt;&gt; See, but prophets are born prophets. Amen. In other words, like you take uh brother Brandham. And brother man was born all the way all the way back into even his childhood. He was already seeing visions and having dreams and and God was using him in a spiritual way because prophets are actually born. Do you know Moses's birth was predicted over 400 years before he was born. When God speaking unto Abraham said, "Thy children should sojourn for 400 years in a strange land which they know not, but then I shall deliver them with a mighty hand." Amen. That mighty hand that God prophesies to deliver his children by is by the hand of Moses. Amen. It was God was going to call a man named Moses. So they were all waiting for a deliverer to be born. And just because God moved upon different men, amen, it was Moses that they were waiting for because of his birth. Now there is a difference in the gift of prophecy and the prophet. There's a huge difference. And the difference is one of them must be judged and the other he does the judging &gt;&gt; like the the spirit of prophecy. A prophecy comes forth and we all are well taught in this as Paul would teach from 1 Corinthians chapter 14. Before prophecy can be given to the congregation, it must be judged. How many know that's true? You other words someone in here couldn't just stand up and start prophesying over our people because see there's no way to return that prophecy until in other words if it's wrong what are you going to do? It's already out among the people. But so that's why that Paul said to take away the confusion because God's not an author of confusion. Amen. To take away the confusion, then a prophecy was judged. Amen. And you have two good witnesses that says, "This is coming from God." Then the person prophesying and the two witnesses stand before the congregation and say, "God has spoken to us and this is the word of the Lord." And if that's the truth, amen, the spirit of God is working among you. And if that's not the truth, it's a lie. And those three are to come to the platform and repent for their lie so that people, Amen, can keep trusting God. Otherwise, it is confusing and makes people wonder, CAN WE TRUST WHAT'S SAID? CAN GOD REALLY BE TRUTHFUL? Is it OR IS IT ALL JUST CONFUSION? You Now, now there's a point behind this, but when it comes to a VINDICATED PROPHET, AMEN. YOU DON'T JUDGE HIM. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T STAND THERE and say, "Well, is he speaking the truth or not the truth?" A vindicated PROPHET SPEAKS the word of God and everything else is judged by what that prophet has to say. That's the kind of prophet Moses was. IF MOSES SAID, "GOD, THERE'S GOING TO MEET US IN THAT TENT." That was no argument. That's where God was going to MEET US. IF MOSES SAID THERE'S GOING TO BE SEVEN FEASTS, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THAT they were going to worship God. MOSES WAS THE KIND OF prophet that could tell them WHERE TO MEET GOD. He could tell them the orders of their WORSHIP AND THEIR SACRIFICE, HOW TO WEAR THEIR CLOTHES. HE COULD TELL THEM HOW TO SET UP THEIR TENTS. He could tell them how to SET UP THEIR FOOD. HE COULD TELL THEM WHAT TO EAT. AMEN. Eat clean, eat unclean. HE COULD TELL THE PRIEST HOW TO APPROACH GOD, WHAT FIRES TO BUILD, WHAT NOT TO BUILD. AND IF YOU GOT ANY OF IT WRONG, YOU WOULD DIE UNDER THE sacrifices or under the great curses of God. How many knows that's right? Amen. because it was the scripture. See, then the words of that prophet became the judge unto that generation. Now, amen. It's not just a a a spirit of prophecy. It is a prophet whom God is working through. And and when you look at the Bible here in Hebrews chapter 1, there's a point behind this. Hebrews chapter 1. If you're looking at the Bible, what Paul is doing here in the first two verses is he's now going to separate for you the difference between the prophet and the son of God. HE'S FISHING TO show you that as MUCH AS YOU SAW MOSES is a prophet, he's going to tell you there is a difference between a prophet and the son of God. He's going to set up to you and I. Amen. That God at one TIME SPOKE UNTO OUR FATHERS. AND GOD SPOKE BY PROPHETS. BUT IN THIS LAST DAY, he is GOING TO SPEAK THROUGH HIS son Jesus Christ. Oh, what a glorious revelation when you see what God is doing here. How that God is using Paul to show us the difference between a prophet AND JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU GO BACK in the scriptures, it's amazing because all of the testaments of the Old Bible testifies of Jesus, doesn't it? When you speak of the of the tabernacle in the wilderness, it's talking about Jesus. It's a three- room house built of skins. Amen. Took nine months to prepare. Amen. You it come from God. Amen. You You see, it's it's and I could go through it. It's the It's the Jesus Christ, the tabernacle. The sacrifices are the tabernacle. I mean, or or are Jesus. The high priest is Jesus. Is that right? Amen. But none of them is actually Jesus. They're only a type of Jesus. That's why you could accept the sacrifice of the Old Testament, but you still needed Jesus. Do you do you see? BECAUSE THEY TYPED who he was. They wasn't him. And receiving those sacrifices was not receiving the fullness of it, which was God himself. If you go back all the way back unto the prophets, like of Moses, and and the Bible tells us that Moses was much like Jesus. Remember, amen. In his birth, he was a deliverer and he was a young child and he was all of the different types that made of Moses. Amen. And but yet Moses wasn't Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You could look at Moses and take places in Moses's life and say that type Jesus, but it wasn't Jesus. YOU COULD GO IN YOUR BIBLE AND YOU COULD TAKE A man like David. It's David's a great example because Jesus when he comes will actually be called the son of David. And in the book of Psalms, when you start reading some of the Psalms, you say Psalms chapter 22. And when THE BIBLE STARTS TALKING IN PSALMS 22, you can listen to David. And it almost sounds like, amen, that David is speaking of himself on the cross. WHEN HE SAID, WHY THOU FORSAKEN ME? THY bones they stare at me and my tongue cleave to my lip. AND DAVID STARTS CRYING OUT IN THIRST AND TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE MOCKING HIM AND HOW THEY'RE LOOKING UPON HIM, SAYING THAT HE COULD NOT SAVE HIMSELF. How could he save others? BUT THAT WASN'T DAVID. AMEN. THAT WAS CHRIST CRYING THROUGH DAVID. AMEN. YOU SEE, BUT HE COULD TYPE. HE COULD TYPE JESUS. BUT DAVID wasn't Jesus. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Do you see that? It was the spirit of a prophet working there. It was a type of it. It was a type of God using David. If you look at the life of Joseph, Joseph's life doesn't mean very much UNTIL JESUS Christ comes. You can go see the life of Joseph and watch how that Joseph typed Jesus. Amen. How he was hated of his brother and loved of his father. Amen. You you know it's the types. And I'll take just a moment and speak about them. Just remind you remember how how he was loved of his father. They hated him without a cause. Amen. Just as they hated Jesus and the brethren piled on him and beat him and stripped his robes from him just like they did Jesus. Amen. They threw him in a pit just like they did Jesus. Amen. They told the father he was dead and they put blood on the road and told the father he was dead. But he wasn't dead. He was becoming the Lord of another country just like Jesus. They say he was dead there in Israel. He wasn't dead. He was thrown in the grave, but on the third day he rose up. Amen. And become the Lord of the Gentiles. SEE, IT'S JUST LIKE JOSEPH. Every knee will bow. EVERY TONGUE SHALL CONFESS. AMEN. HE WILL reveal himself to THE BRETHREN JUST LIKE JESUS. BUT JOSEPH WAS not Jesus. &gt;&gt; MOSES TYPE JESUS. David type Jesus. AMEN. JOSEPH TYPE JESUS. BUT THEY wasn't him. It was NOT THE ONE THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR. Though they were a type of him. I think of this today. I think of the grace of God that when you can look at all of the prophets, but there was none of him, them was actually him. And that's what Paul begins to say in the book of Hebrews. He said, "But in the last days, he has spoke through his son, Jesus Christ." See, it was prophets back there. But today, AMEN. IT'S CHRIST THAT IS INSIDE THE CHURCH DOING THE SPEAKING. IT'S NOT JUST A PROPHET. IT'S GOD HIMSELF THAT IS SPEAKING to the church. The first thing we HAVE TO DO IS RECOGNIZE THAT PAUL COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS WORKING ON THEM PROPHETS BECAME FLESH AND THE MAN JESUS CHRIST AND HE WAS SHOWING YOU JESUS IS NOT A CONTRADICTION TO THE PROPHETS. HE IS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHETS. HE'S NOT JUST A TYPE OF THE PROPHETS. HE IS A FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHETS. OH, WHEN I THINK ABOUT it this morning, oh, what Paul WAS TRYING TO SAY UNTO THEM, HE WAS TRYING TO say that Jesus Christ was God. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Listen, the first of all revelations that we should see is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You must know he is when you hear his voice. It's the same voice that sounded on Mount Si, that sounded on Mount Transfiguration. It's the voice. It's the son of man. THAT'S RIGHT. SEE, now every time that Jesus comes forward in the church ages, every time he introduces himself, he puts forth something of his deity. That's the first thing he tries to make known to a church is that he's deity. He's God. You see great issues back here with Iranius and them fussing. They tried to say THAT GOD WAS THREE IN cosmics and God was three in persons. Amen. But there is no such a thing. IT'S THE TITLES OF ONE BEING. HE IS THE ALMIGHTY GOD. YOU SEE, IT MIGHT BE FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST. BUT THERE'S NOT THREE GODS. There is just ONE GOD WHO WAS IN THE ATTRIBUTE MANIFESTING AS A FATHER WHO WAS ABOVE US. AMEN. AS A PILLAR OF FIRE. BUT WHEN IT BECAME A SON OF FLESH IN JOHN CHAPTER 1, he became God with us. AMEN. BUT THE BIBLE MADE A PROMISE THAT THOUGH HE WOULD DIE AND BE BURIED AND RESURRECTED, YET A LITTLE WHILE AND THE WORLD SHALL SEE ME NO MORE, BUT YOU SHALL SEE ME FOR I WILL BE WITH YOU EVEN IN YOU UNTIL THE COMING OF the Lord. You see, IT'S IN YOU. THAT'S THE FIRST OF ALL REVELATIONS is that Jesus is deity. HE IS NOT THE third person of A GODHEAD. HE IS THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY IN ONE MAN. OH, IF I COULD GET THAT ACROSS TO THE WORLD TODAY, IF I COULD SCREAM IT FROM THE MOUNTAINTOPS THAT JESUS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF EVERY SCRIPTURE IN THE BIBLE, he is the son of God. He is God himself manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; The first of all revelations in every church age, he will address himself as deity. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we find it the first of all revelations is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Now, we're talking about Hebrews 1 and 2. Don't forget our topic. It is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Do you know the most important revelation in this Bible? How many knows what it is? The most important revelation in this Bible, the most important one, Amen. in the Bible is that Jesus, Amen, is the God of the Amen. Listen, he was in the Old Testament Jehovah, but in the New Testament, he is Jesus. Watch the scripture here. O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God. The New Testament does not reveal another God. Amen. It is a further revelation of the one and the same God. Christ did not come down to make himself known. He did not come to reveal the son. He came to make known THE FATHER. HE NEVER TALKED about two gods. He talked about one God. And now in this last stage, we have come to a capstone revelation. The most important revelation, amen, of the Godhead in the whole Bible is that Jesus is God. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. True word tabernacle. Where you at this morning? You let no compressing spirit hold you back from your amens. AMEN. THE MOST IMPORTANT REVELATION in this Bible IS THAT JESUS IS GOD. LISTEN, IF YOU MAKE HIM THE SECOND PERSON OF A GODHEAD, YOU HAVE LOST YOUR POWER. AS A BELIEVER, YOU ARE A POWERLESS CHURCH. YOU'RE A POWERLESS PEOPLE. FOR JESUS SAID, "ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH IS GIVEN UNTO ME." THERE'S NOT A SECOND PERSON UP THERE THAT'S A LITTLE LESSER THAN GOD. HE IS OMNIPOTENT IN POWER. AMEN. AND JESUS IS THE SAME THIS MORNING AS HE ALWAYS IS. AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, HE'S GOT ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW THAT UNBELIEVING DEVIL RIGHT OUT OF THIS BUILDING THIS MORNING. HE IS THE SUPREME DEITY. HE IS A SUPREME GOD. AND THERE IS NO GOD THAT CAN STAND BEFORE HIM. HE IS THE GOD OF ALL GODS. &gt;&gt; AND HE IS MY GOD. &gt;&gt; AND WE EXALT HIM THIS MORNING AS PAUL IS exalting him. His name is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a name that's above every name. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; ABOVE EVERY PROPHET. THERE IS NO NAME OF ANY PROPHET THAT WILL COME to the name OF JESUS CHRIST. IT IS A NAME ABOVE every name of every disease. IT'S ABOVE EVERY DEMON. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT. I DON'T YOU CALL IT ANXIETY, NERVOUSNESS, SICKNESS, CANCER, TUBERCULOSIS. YOU CALL IT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. YOU CALL BLINDNESS, DEAFNESS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. THIS NAME OF JESUS IS ABOVE EVERY DEMON, EVERY POWER, EVERY UNBELIEF BECAUSE IT HAS POWER. AND WE EXALT HIM AS GOD. WE DO NOT EXALT HIM AS SOMEBODY WHO WOULD JUST WORSHIP ONCE IN A WHILE. HE'S WORTHY OF OUR WORSHIP. ON OUR GOOD DAYS, ON OUR BAD DAYS, IN OUR MOMENTS OF TROUBLE, IN OUR MOMENTS OF STRUGGLE, HE IS STILL WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. AND WHEN YOU EXALT HIM, YOU BRING A POWER AMONG YOU TO CONTROL THE ATMOSPHERES YOU'RE SITTING IN. &gt;&gt; I know the atmosphere of this world would like to suppress the revelations of God and the power of it. But brother, let me tell you, there's enough power in this message to blow the unbelief right off OF A PERSON, OFF OF A CHURCH, OFF OF AN INDIVIDUAL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. I REFUSE TO suppress the revelation of God &gt;&gt; to the spirits of unbelief. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the fullness of the Godhead bodily. In the book of Hebrews, this is the revelation that Paul is delivering. And he writes it in other places. To be clear, in Colossians 1:15, he said, "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. FOR BY HIM WERE ALL THINGS CREATED that are in heaven, that are in earth, visible, invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities, whether they be powers or things that are created by him and for him. He is before all things, and by him all THINGS CONSIST. HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BODY, THE CHURCH. GLORY TO GOD. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH? IT IS JESUS CHRIST. COME ON. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE HEAD? COME ON. I KNOW PASTORS, AND GOD HELP US. I KNOW PASTORS WANT TO BE THE THE HEAD OF EVERY HOME. LET ME TELL YOU. AMEN. A PASTOR IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN. AMEN. THERE'S ONE HEAD OF A MAN AND THAT HEAD IS CHRIST. AND CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. AND AS LONG AS A PASTOR COMES UNDER CHRIST, AMEN, THAT HE OPERATES IN THE OFFICE OF HEADSHIP OVER AN ASSEMBLY. BUT ONLY IF HE'S WALKING in the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We ain't following a man. We're following that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My goodness. Amen. Enough with man-made kingdoms. Enough with the denominational and organizational SYSTEMS AROUND THIS MESSAGE. FORGET IT. WE NEED ONE AMONG US AND THAT IS JESUS CHRIST. AND HE IS HIS WORD &gt;&gt; and his word leads. &gt;&gt; Call me a maverick if you want to. I'm going to follow this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS AND BY HIM ALL things consist. He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, and that in all things he might have preeminence. &gt;&gt; In all things he would have preeminence. For it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. Now, how much is going to dwell in him? &gt;&gt; You know, a partial portion kind of like Moses or kind of like David or No, in him the fullness dwells. &gt;&gt; My goodness, look at Paul. HE CHANGES IN COLOSSIANS 2. He never changes his revelation. He just changes chapters. He said, "For in him, in the ninth verse, dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him." Listen, you'll never be a complete person till you get in him. &gt;&gt; You're never going to have the life you want till you get in him. There will be nothing can bring you happiness until you get in him. THERE WILL BE NOTHING CAN CONFIRM, COMFORT YOU. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY. THERE IS NO SUSTAINING JOY. FOR MY BIBLE SAID THAT THE WICKED WILL HAVE NO PEACE &gt;&gt; IN THIS LAYOUT OF AGE. YOU CAN SEE IT. WE GOT more than we ever had. INCREASED IN MATERIAL GOODS, increased in education, INCREASED IN SCIENCE. WE'VE INCREASED IN EVERYTHING. BUT PEOPLE are more troubled right now than they've ever been. BUT THERE IS A WAY TO SETTLE THE HEART. IT'S TO COME INTO JESUS CHRIST. HE IS THE FULLNESS. AND HIM IN YOU MAKES A COMPLETE PLAN. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. Amen. I can't preach for preaching. Amen. But you see, in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead. You you you know it was the pillar of fire itself spoke. Amen. In Matthew chapter 3 and said, "Lo, a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." Let me just give you a a a let me give you a a a good a good uh translation of this. in the one I'm pleased to get in. &gt;&gt; Amen. The one I'm in, the one I dwell in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the it's scripture for Jesus said, "I doeth not the works, but my father which dwelleth in me." &gt;&gt; He doeth the works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, now if you go to Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5, this is later in Hebrews. We'll get to it. Wherefore when he cometh unto the world, he saith sacrifice and offerings, thou wouldest not, but a body thou hast prepared. Amen. Do you see that Jesus is the very body that God has got into in its fullness? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the the Bible didn't go away because Jesus came, right? &gt;&gt; In the book of Amos, the third chapter, if you're a Bible reader, you know it. THE BIBLE SAYS, "SURELY the Lord God will do nothing, but what he revealth his secret unto the servants, the prophets." &gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful, isn't it? Do you think that changed because the dispensations changed? &gt;&gt; No. No. God still reveals to the prophets. &gt;&gt; Now, IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE IT PAUL IS NOW separating the prophets from God, from the son of God or the fullness of God. And many people are trying to take scripture like this and make it sound like that God doesn't remain to be prophetic when when when Moses IS NOT TAKING AWAY A PROPHETIC GOD. He's just showing you it will not be partial no more THROUGH PROPHETS LIKE IT WAS IN THE OLD. But in the new it will be God speaking through his son Jesus Christ. Now here's the thing. Amen. Somebody said, "Well, you know what about Jesus?" Well, let me just say very clearly, you do know Jesus is a prophet, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know in Deuteronomy the 18th chapter, the 15th verse, it said, "The Lord God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren, liken unto me, and him shall you hearken." You know that Moses prophesied that the Messiah that was coming was going to be a prophet. And when Jesus come, was he a prophet? &gt;&gt; In Acts 3 AND:E 20, THE BIBLE SAID, "AND HE SHALL SEND JESUS CHRIST, which was preached before unto you, whom the heavens must receive until the time of the restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began." So, so, uh, Peter says here in Acts that God has took the body of our Lord Jesus and brought him into heaven. HE SAID, "AND THEN HE SAYS, WATCH UNTIL THE TIME OF the restitution OF ALL THINGS." NOW, NOT ALL THINGS WAS NOT RESTORED in the days when Jesus was on the earth. &gt;&gt; It was not all restituted, was it all? No, it wasn't. All the restitution wasn't there. But look AT WHAT HE SAYS. BUT MOSES TRULY SAID UNTO the fathers, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you the brethren, liken unto me, and whom shall ye hear in all things." Do you know that Jesus himself is that prophet like Moses? &gt;&gt; Jesus himself is that prophet like Moses but he is more than Moses. &gt;&gt; He is a prophet like Moses but he is more than Moses. WE KNOW THE PROPHETS WERE IN the days gone by but today it's Christ. IT'S NOT JUST A PROPHET. IT IS MORE than a prophet. DO YOU SEE THAT? GOD NEVER LOST THE ABILITY TO PROPHESY OR TO FORETELL THE FUTURE. AMEN. BUT NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST A PROPHET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOD OF THE [screaming] PROPHETS. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. In this last DAY, HE HAS PROMISED that he would speak through his SON JESUS CHRIST. NOW, THAT CORPORAL BODY IS NOT HERE. AMEN. THEN HOW ARE WE GOING TO HEAR FROM GOD? BUT THE BIBLE PROPHESIED the Holy Ghost would come and he would speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Hebrews chapter 1, watch this. Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one. Let's tie it to a beautiful scripture in Luke 16. But I want to read this ahead of it. In Sundra Times and diverse manners, he spoke to the prophets. Amen. And the law and the prophets were until John, right? And then the kingdom of God. Uh, put it back up. Put Luke 16:16 up there. We're coming to it now. But in the last days, he is speaking through his son. This is from Hebrews 1. He's speaking through his son, God. in sunundra times in diverse manner spoke through the prophets doing the same thing. He's speaking to the fathers through the son Jesus Christ. He's doing God's doing the same things but he's just changing from prophets of the old testament and the law which they pointed to now it's coming to Jesus Christ. He has raised him up from the dead and he lives within us identifying himself and foretelling things. God in sundry times that scripture can't be tampered with and that scripture cannot lie. I've had many people say to me, well, you know, because we believe in a prophet in the end times, they'll say, well, brother Wayne, the law and the prophets were unto John. And it's the oddest thing that they quote that and have no clue what it actually means. They have never considered that there is something written behind the very scripture they're quoting. Let's read it. The law and the prophets were until John. But since that time, the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressth to it. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? In the Old Testament of law AND PROPHETS, MAN COULD NOT GO INTO THAT INNER VEIL. THEY COULD NOT GO INTO THAT HOLY PLACE. THEY COULD NOT GO INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD. BUT SINCE THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS WERE FINISHED, AMEN, now every ONE OF YOU BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CAN PRESS INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD WHERE THE VERY GOD OF THE PROPHETS CAN COME RIGHT INTO THE CHURCH AND USE HIS GIFTS AND MANIFESTATIONS among you. Amen. Oh, when I think about this, I think about the kingdom of God that is within you. Somebody say, "Where is the kingdom of God?" Well, in Luke chapter 17, Jesus in his own words, he says it here, "And when he dreamed or when he demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom should come," he answered them and said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." Neither say, "Lo here or lo there, but the kingdom of God is within you." Do you see what Hebrews 1 is saying? It's saying that he spoke through those prophets, but in the last days, the son is going to get into his church. Jesus said it's the law and PROPHETS UNTIL JOHN, BUT AFTER THAT, SOMETHING IS GOING TO COME INTO THE CHURCH. A KINGDOM IS GOING TO BE SET UP WITHIN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. JESUS IS GOING TO BECOME THE KING IN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM OF EVERY LIFE IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. My when I think about that this morning, it's the kingdom. It's where his word is made power. It's don't have borders like America. But you and all know the Virgin Islands down there is American territory. Puerto Rico, I believe it's No, it's not Puerto Rico, is it? Yeah, it's American territory. Amen. They speak American, spend American money, act like American, do American, BUT THEY'RE NOT actually within the border. But our kingdom rests there. LOOK AT BRITISH BRITISH AND AND THE FRENCH. I RUN INTO the Africans DOWN WAY IN THE JUNGLES speaking a French language. I see THEM SPEAKING A A BRITISH ENGLISH down there in those jungles. WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THAT? From the dominion of England over Africa because English kingdoms were carried to Africa and made those Africans come under THEIR KINGDOM. AND SO HAS JESUS COME FROM THE HEAVENS OF HEAVENS AND HAS SET UP A KINGDOM IN THE HEART OF EVERY BELIEVER. AMEN. AND SET HIM HERE THIS MORNING. JESUS MAY NOT BE THE KING OF THE WORLD, BUT HE IS THE KING OF EVERY BELIEVER SET HIM HERE BECAUSE HIS WORD HAS POWER IN THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is where the word has power. 1 Corinthians 4:20 tells us that the kingdom of God is God's word made power. What is the kingdom of God? It's within you. The kingdom is in you. And when the word comes in there, what does it word begin? It turns itself into power. &gt;&gt; When a man has the Holy Ghost and the word comes into you, THIS HOLY GHOST IN YOU turns it into power. When God says you should or you shouldn't, it should be this way. It shouldn't be this way. If you HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, that is a kingdom. It's a command from the throne of God. Do you see? Amen. I know Jesus ain't sitting on a millennial kingdom. So, we'll get into that dispensation later, but let me Y'all remember David, don't you? Who was David had a had a whole host of mighty men and one day laid up there in Bethlehem over Bethlehem looking at that at that well of Bethlehem and laid there and and and just said, "I I would like to have a drink out of the well of Bethlehem." He was not a king down there in Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; but he was certainly a king over the followers he had. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And the prophet made a point out of it and he said David desired a drink from that well. But David's desire to them was a command. AMEN. HE didn't have to to command them a certain thing. HE JUST TOLD THEM HIS DESIRE and it became a command of their heart. That's why you don't have to beat believers into believing the message or beat them INTO CERTAIN LIFESTYLES BECAUSE if they KNOW GOD DESIRES IT. AMEN. IT'S A COMMAND in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you this, the millennium's coming, but we won't change kings. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not going to change kings. Amen. We got the same king now. You see, PAUL'S TELLING THEM THIS IN THE HEBREWS, YOU'RE NOT CHANGING KINGS. JEHOVAH, WHOM YOU HAVE FOLLOWED, HAS JUST BECOME JESUS CHRIST IN THE FLESH. You didn't change kings, &gt;&gt; right? But he's manifesting fuller among you, church. See, what is it? It's the Holy Spirit. I love how Brother Brandon speaks this. He says, see, Hebrews 1 is saying the Holy Spirit will take possession. &gt;&gt; He's taking the possession to operate Christ in the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what's going on. He's taking possession. Hebrews 1 is a prophecy. He's going to take possession of human bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is going to claim human bodies for his own body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Think about that. That you'll be bought with a price paid for &gt;&gt; and claimed by Jesus Christ. What What you I I don't have a better word to say it than modern terms. It's a Holy Ghost takeover. YEAH, &gt;&gt; IT'S A HOLY GHOST TAKEOVER. THAT'S WHAT PAUL is predicting HERE IN HEBREWS 1. HE'S NOT SAYING GOD IS FINISHED WORKING. HE'S SAYING GOD IS GETTING CLOSER. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ABOVE YOU. HE WAS WITH YOU. BUT NOW HE'S COMING IN YOU. GOD AIN'T GETTING FARTHER. GOD'S GETTING CLOSER. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE HOW MEN will take the scripture AND THEY'LL BLOCK GOD out of the PEOPLE BY SCRIPTURE. THIS SCRIPTURE IS not ending the manifestations of God. It's bringing them closer to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My goodness. My goodness. Amen. That you you can can I I'm going to just touch this because I'm coming back to it later in the series. But in Hebrews chapter 2, watch this in the first verse. Hebrews 2:1. Therefore, we ought to give a more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. I'll have to come back and preach on that. That's really good, ain't it? Amen. For if the words spoken by angels, now listen to that, if words spoken by angels were steadfast, look up the word angel, it's a small a, it's angelos, which means messengers. &gt;&gt; Let me let me read it to you as if you wasn't reading it English transferred Greek. Let's just say it like this. If the word spoken by prophets, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward. In other words, if the things that were spoken by prophets were powerful and and and must be understood and took notice of, how then shall we escape if we would let a such a great salvation which has began to be spoken? &gt;&gt; Not by angels. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; WHO'S DOING THE SPEAKING NOW? &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S NOT ANGELS SPEAKING. IT'S SPOKEN BY THE LORD. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHAT PAUL IS PUTTING IN HEBREWS 1? NOT PROPHETS, JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S COMING TO THE CHURCH IN THE NEW TESTAMENT? IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AN OLD TESTAMENT LAW. It's it's God getting in a man and speaking to the church. Look at how powerful this is. Amen. Look in Hebrews chapter 3 because we're talking about God speaking, right? Hebrews chapter 3, watch in the seventh verse. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted me and proved me, and saw my works 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved with them that generation, and said, they do heir in their heart, and they have not known my ways. So I swear in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest. Now look what it is. Wherefore though, as the Holy Ghost said, today if you will hear his voice. So, HE WAS SAYING GOD WAS SPEAKING back there to them. And they didn't get in their rest. Now, why didn't they get there? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW GOD'S WAY. THEY WASN'T ABLE TO RECEIVE GOD'S VOICE. BUT HE SAID, "DON'T YOU DO THE SAME THING NOW THAT THE LORD IS SPEAKING? When you hear his voice, don't you harden your heart." &gt;&gt; Look what he tells us in Hebrews chapter 4 and verse one. And he begins to say, "Therefore, let us fear a promise left of us of entering the rest." In other words, Amen. Here's where you get scared. There's no rest. But if there is a rest, don't have any fear. It's a promise. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached DIDN'T PROFIT THEM, NOT being mixed with faith that heard it. NOW, WHY DIDN'T THEY GO into the promises back there under Moses? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MIX WHAT THEY heard with faith. &gt;&gt; Do you see? It wasn't the immorality that was killing Israel. It wasn't the transgressions of the LAW THAT WAS DESTROYING ISRAEL. IT WAS THE LACK OF BELIEVING WHAT GOD HAD SAID UNTO THEM. AMEN. AND I SAY THE SAME THING TODAY. IT'S NOT JUST UNCLEAN LIVING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD LIVING PEOPLE THAT DON'T BELIEVE GOD, BUT IT'S THAT SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WILL HAVE A HEART FOR THE THINGS THAT GOD SAYS. And I I don't have time to preach it, but I'll just give it to you in the Bible just so you remember. Jesus looked at the Pharisee. What did he say to him? You snake in the grass. You're full of dead man's bones. Remember, he said, "You garnish the tombs of the prophets and you're THE ONE." LOOK AT HOW HE TALKED TO THEM. YOU HYPOCRITE, YOU WHITEED WALL. JESUS IS TALKING TO THEM THAT WAY. WHY IS HE DOING IT? For their immorality? Nope. &gt;&gt; CUZ THEY WASN'T IMMORAL. THEY had the law down to the letter. You couldn't put one THING ON THEIR LIFE. IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY REFUSING THE VOICE OF GOD IN HIS FULLNESS IN THAT AGE. YOU CAN LIVE HOLY. You can live clean. BUT WHEN GOD SPEAKS, YOU'VE GOT TO HUMBLE YOUR HEART AND SAY, "LORD, I ACCEPT YOUR WORD IN MY GENERATION." IT'S NOT THAT GOD QUITS SPEAKING, but he speaks various WAYS IN VARIOUS TIMES, BUT TODAY HE SPEAKS through his son, Christ Jesus, who is our king. My goodness. Then I say, "Let us labor to enter into the rest of God." [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHERE THE HOLY Ghost rules over every life. Now, when I when I think of this, you see what's going on is Paul is showing that God is now transferring into the church. He's become the Holy Spirit in the church. In John 14 and verse 16, let's read something here. very very uh beautiful reading where sometimes people will take you to say there's well there's a couple of them in in the godhead but watch this and I will pray the father see there's one and he shall give unto you the comforter there's two and they shall abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive so Jesus is talking and the father and the spirit he he's discussing this as it's different doesn't he &gt;&gt; but how many realizes the father and the spirit's the same thing &gt;&gt; yeah Yeah. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 1. &gt;&gt; Amen. The father of Jesus Christ is God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible tells us it's his father. &gt;&gt; But when the Bible also speaks that when the angel come to Joseph, he said to him, "Fear not to take Mary thy wife, for the thing she conceived is is of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Who was the father? The Holy Ghost or the father? BUT BECAUSE GOD IS A SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; The father is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Then the father and the spirit's the same thing. USING TWO DIFFERENT ENGLISH WORDS, but it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; It's not two different spirits. NOT TWO DIFFERENT GODS. SAME THING. &gt;&gt; But watch what Jesus says here. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot see. Now he's making it sound like the comforter is different from him. But watch what he says now. The world cannot see because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But you shall know him. He dwelleth with you. Shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. For I will come. Oh, I thought the Holy Ghost was coming. &gt;&gt; But I will not leave you comfortless. For I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye shall live because I live. You shall live also. And at that day you going to know this that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? Amen. He's prophesying of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. IS GOING to speak through the believer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? Amen. When I look at this and look at our Lord Jesus coming to the earth, how many knows the Bible called him Emmanuel? Amen. &gt;&gt; He was God with us. Amen. Matthew chapter 1 and 23 in John. John records him in John 1 and1 and said, "In the beginning was the word &gt;&gt; and the word was with God and the word was God." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; In the 14th verse, he said, "And that word was made flesh and dwelt among us." &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I'm moving too fast. I got a lot to hit. But in the book of Hebrews, the 4th chapter and THE 12TH VERSE, PAUL is saying that the word is a discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart. &gt;&gt; SO LET'S SEE. JESUS WAS the word. And when he went to the woman at the well, how many ever read the account in John chapter 4? And Jesus went to the woman at the well. And when he began to talk to her, he talked about her going to get her husband and bringing him. And she said, "I don't have one." He said, "That's right." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. you've had six and the one you're living with ain't yours. AND SHE GOT SO EXCITED. SHE SAID, "SIR, I perceive thou art a prophet." He said, "That's right." &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, WE WE'RE EXPECTING THE MESSIAH." HE SAID, "I am he." &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet and the Messiah was the same thing. &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? JESUS WAS MORE than a Messiah. HE WAS THE PROPHET. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THAT THEY HAD LONGED TO see and proved it by the discernment of the spirit of the woman at the well. Brother man, it's a beautiful reading. If you like the Bible, it's beautiful because this woman heard it one time and recognized that was the Messiah talking. &gt;&gt; Amen. DIDN'T MATTER WHAT HIS body looked like because, AMEN, THE BIBLE said he wasn't anything to look at. AND ISAIAH 53 said he was uncumbly. Amen. And the tree OF LIFE HAS ALWAYS been uncumbly. It's the TREE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IS BEAUTIFUL and looks good. Come on, church. Amen. But he BEGAN TO DISCERN THAT same Jesus. That was a Samaritan. He walked over to the Jews and he looked at them Jews and and and he walked over. Remember, Amen. Nathaniel run down to Philillip and said, "Come see the Messiah. I found him." And Philip goes up the hill and sees this man Jesus who's no different than any other Pharisee or any other theologian. He looks just like the rest of them. But when he walks up in the prayer line, this man looks at HIM AND SAID, "PHILLIP," AMEN. He calls him, he said, "An Israelite in whom no G." And the man says to him, "Since when do you know me?" &gt;&gt; And the most beautiful words come out of his mouth. He said, "I knew you." He said, "Before Nathaniel come to you up there at that fig tree?" &gt;&gt; And the man WAS SO BLOWN AWAY THAT HE SAID, "THOU ART the king &gt;&gt; of Israel." NOW, NOW LOOK WHAT HE DONE. HE HAS NOW identified that that word is a discerner. It is God. IT IS THE MESSIAH. IT IS THE PROPHET. IT IS THE KING. AND THAT JUST ONE TIME, MY GOODNESS, JUST ONE TIME. AND PHILIP KNEW WHO HE WAS. ONE TIME THE WOMAN KNEW WHO HE WAS. JUST ONE TIME. And Peter knew who he was. And we have today, amen, records of over 8,300 TIMES ON TAPE WHERE A PROPHET HAS SAID THINGS TO PEOPLE WHERE YOU'RE FROM, WHAT YOUR NAME IS, WHAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE, WHAT YOUR ADDRESS IS, WHAT YOUR SICKNESSES ARE. I SAY, SIR, THOU ART A PROPHET. AMEN. BUT THERE MUST BE MORE THAN A PROPHET THERE. &gt;&gt; It's got to BE MORE THAN A PROPHET THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Glory be to God. Amen. It was. Amen. The word is a discerner. &gt;&gt; It was the son of God that was upon the earth. Now, look what he says here in Hebrews 5. I'm going to preach the whole book of Hebrews to this morning. Hebrews chapter 5, look in the fifth verse. I'm sorry. I'm I'm going to probably throw about 100 scriptures at you. It might feel more like Bible study than preaching, but but it's going to feel pretty good because you know I'm telling you the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 5, SO ALSO CHRIST glorified not himself to be made manifest a high priest, BUT HE THAT SAID unto him, there it is, he that said unto him, thou art my son, and today I have begotten thee. So he did have a father because it was he was not his own father. He was the son of the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. as he also said in another place. I always like when Paul says that IN ANOTHER PLACE, "THOU art a priest forever after the order of Melkazedc, who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered prayers and supplication, strong crying and tears unto them that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared. Though he were a son, yet he learned he obedience by the things he suffered." He was altogether human, wasn't he? And though he were a son, HE SUFFERED. AND BEING MADE PERFECT, HE BECAME THE AUTHOR of eternal salvation. My I don't know if I I feel like shouting right there. HE BECOME THE AUTHOR OF ETERNAL. THERE IS AN ETERNAL SALVATION, FOLKS. THERE IS A SALVATION THAT'S NOT A CHURCH SERVICE TO A CHURCH SERVICE. IT'S NOT YEAR TO YEAR. IT'S NOT PROBLEM TO PROBLEM. IT IS ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; Just as much as GOD IS ETERNAL, THE SALVATION of God is eternal. Paul is introducing something, sister Rald. It's different than that Old Testament. From year to year, they had to go. But Paul is saying now there's an eternal. We're not returning yearly. We come to this priest one time and it fixes it eternally. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Man made perfect and eternal salvation. He was called of God a priest after the order of Melkazedc. [laughter] Man, what a reality. Melkazedc sound like a big name, doesn't it? But you know, I know people are all confused on who that Melazedc was. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU YOU GOT A Bible in front of you. &gt;&gt; And though things were written here, there was not understanding on some of this. But according to the book of Revelations, if you won't discount it now in Revelations the 10th chapter and the seventh verse, my Bible said, "In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery OF WHAT?" &gt;&gt; GOD &gt;&gt; OF GOD should be finished. AMEN. THEN IF THERE WAS A GREAT MYSTERY over who's this Melazdc, wouldn't it be this seventh angel coming to solve out the matter? Wouldn't it be him that was going to tell us WHAT IT REALLY WAS and will it really come from? AMEN. IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF, CHURCH. LOOK IN REVELATIONS the 10th chapter in the first verse and SEE WHEN JOHN SEES A MIGHTY angel descending out OF HEAVEN. IT'S NOT ONE OF THE PROPHETS. &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF THAT IS COMING TO THE CHURCH. IT'S NOT ONE OF THE PROPHETS. &gt;&gt; He's coming. And when he comes, he has seven thunders. And they uttered their voices. But John, he couldn't write it back then. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when this seventh angel begins to sound, &gt;&gt; well, seven thunders, what are they? That's that's real easy. That is not a complicated thing. You want me to tell you what they are? It's the voice of God. &gt;&gt; The voice of God. And when the seven seals sounded, it's the revelations contained in the seven seals that God has spoken in this generation. &gt;&gt; So those seven thunders, do you see? Now watch this. in Hebrews chapter 7. Amen. This is the thing. The one that came, the one that Paul is talking about, this Melkazedc, DO YOU KNOW HE WASN'T A PRIEST, he was a person. He wasn't just a priesthood or figment. He was an actual person. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 7, watch Paul will say this. Consider now how great this man was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, he's talking about he's talking about in the Bible Melazedc that met Abraham. And when Paul talks about him, he said, "Think about how great this man was." So, Brother Bam said, "I want to point out here to you that it was not a priesthood. It was a person." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And whoever that person was, he's still alive. &gt;&gt; Because the next verses said he was without beginning of days or an ending of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was God. He was a person. And that PERSON WAS GOD. NOW, YOU can't really catch the revelation until you until you look at the at the Bible and and you and you and you see that God is Elohim, right? Self-existent. &gt;&gt; He's a spirit, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, GOD wanted to talk to Abraham. So, he just reached down and picked up 16 elements, created a body, stepped into it in various times, in various ways. He spoke into Abraham. HE GOT INTO THAT BODY and went down and visited with Abraham in Genesis the 14th chapter. Now, Paul was reading Genesis 14 when he's commenting in Hebrews 7. See, he's taught in THE BIBLE THAT PAUL HAS THE SAME OLD TESTAMENT you got. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Read Hebrews uh Genesis with me. Let's see what Paul had to read about about this what he's speaking of in Genesis 14 and 18. And Melkazedc, king of Salem, brought forth the bread and wine. And he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him. And he said, "Blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth." And he blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. He was a man. He was a person. He spoke and talked to Abraham, and he brought brine and bread. The first communion served. Here's the man that served communion. &gt;&gt; Now, it's amazing because this man was speaking unto Abraham. Now, it's God in various times, in various ways. NOW, IF YOU GO BACK TO THE BIBLE, HOW FAR can God come down and you still recognize he's God? See, because you can recognize Elohim, the pillar of fire. You, OH, THAT'S GOD. BUT WATCH NOW. AMEN. Later in Genesis 18, THE BIBLE RECORDS THAT THREE MEN COME, AMEN. to Abraham's tent door. And one of them Abraham looks at and says, "My Lord." &gt;&gt; HE CALLED THAT MAN his God. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. Have you ever wondered how far God can come down? Well, let me tell you this. He come all the way down until he got into a body that had dust on his clothes. He had a stick in his hand. He had dirty feet because Abraham washed them. HE WAS HUNGRY. He could eat. HE COULD SERVE BREAD. HE COULD BE A PART. AMEN. HE COULD TALK AND FELLOWSHIP WITH ABRAHAM. BUT ABRAHAM WAS A SEED. AND HE KNEW THERE'S ONLY ONE GOD. AND THIS IS HIM IN THIS MAN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Look at the power of that. Recognizing that God was in that man. Now, now Abraham believed in one God. That's all he believed &gt;&gt; in one God. He didn't believe in multiplicity of gods. He didn't come out of Babylon. You couldn't sell him that. Amen. But he believed in one God. Paul is trying to show the church, these Jews. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; These Jews that And you can't see it for us till you see it for them. &gt;&gt; He's trying to show them Jews. That pillar of fire that y'all's worshiped over with Moses. And that pillar of fire that you believe in, he's the one that got into this man, JESUS CHRIST. THIS GUY YOU'RE CRUCIFIED, THE ONE YOU HAVE THROWN OUT. AMEN. THAT IS GOD THAT HAS MANIFESTED in his son. &gt;&gt; He was telling them God ain't changed. He is just now manifesting himself in the form of his son. DO YOU KNOW THAT THE BIBLE TELLS US, AMEN, THAT THAT that when gen and and and this is relative to our thought in Genesis chapter 14 when when Melazdc comes, he's representing the coming of Jesus Christ, right? &gt;&gt; He's coming with communion. But when he comes, he's not coming with a lamb at this time. &gt;&gt; He's bringing a restoration to Lot and he's bringing a restoration to the ministry, but he's not coming with a lamb at this time. But he did serve them communion. Do you know that Jesus himself serves communion years later just like Melazdc did because Melazdc became Jesus Christ? BUT IN GENESIS 14, he didn't have a lamb for a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he have a lamb, folks? Because he was God. &gt;&gt; Now, look, David had a lamb, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and and and Moses had a lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PEOPLE, THEY HAD A LAMB THAT THEY could offer. But until Jesus was born, GOD HAD NO LAMB HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, HE COULDN'T OFFER THE FIRSTLANDS of the flock. GOD COULDN'T OFFER. HE COULDN'T GO DOWN AND TAKE ONE OF THEM LITTLE LAMBS LIKE MOSES DID AND OFFER SYMBOLOGY. BUT WHEN GOD OFFERED A LAMB, &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; IT HAD TO BE THAT ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIS MIND BECAUSE MOSES WAS ONLY OFFERING A LAMB BECAUSE IT WAS A TYPE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN GOD MADE AN OFFERING, IT WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE. IT WAS THE MAN CHRIST JESUS. That's right. &gt;&gt; My when Jesus walked into the water that morning, IT WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT SAW him coming and said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." LET ME TELL YOU THIS MORNING, OUR LAMB IS GOD'S LAMB. I don't have David's lamb. I DON'T HAVE MOSES'S LAMB. I DON'T HAVE THAT LAMB THAT YOU CAN SACRIFICE AND GO AWAY THE SAME OR A SINNER AND REMAIN. BUT I'VE GOT A LAMB THAT IF YOU EVER COME TO THIS LAMB, YOU ARE SANCTIFIED FOREVER. YOU ARE CLEANSED BY THE BLOOD OF GOD'S LAMB. GOD SLAY THE LAMB. In Isaiah 53, it said it made his soul an offering for sin. Then it wasn't the blood of just a man. It wasn't the blood of just a Jew. It was the creative blood of God which redeems you AND I THIS MORNING. NOW, PREACHER, AMEN. AND BELIEVER, YOU MIGHT NOT CATCH THE REALITY of what that means, but what it means IS WHAT PAUL IS SAYING THAT GOD IS COMING TO GET HIS PEOPLE, but he couldn't do it without a lamb. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO OFFER A LAMB before he could get into his people. That's where he really wanted to go. So when he brought Christ Jesus and he offered him, he was offering his own lamb. Do you see Jesus? Amen. He wasn't just a normal man. &gt;&gt; You know, when they were talking to Jesus in John 6, he said, "I am the bread of life." &gt;&gt; They said, "Our fathers did eat man in the wilderness." And he said, "There everyone dead." &gt;&gt; But I am the bread of life. You hear that? I am. &gt;&gt; When they were talking about the need of light, Jesus said, "I I am the light of the world." Yes. &gt;&gt; Look at what he said. He said, "I am the door of the sheepfold." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I AM the good shepherd." There's several of them. "I am the resurrection and the life. I am the way, the truth, the life. I am the true vine." &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY LOOKED UPON HIM AND HE SAID, THEY SAID, "WELL, WE BELIEVE MOSES AND WE BELIEVE ABRAHAM." AND JESUS LOOKED RIGHT AT HIM AND HE SAID, "BEFORE ABRAHAM WAS, I am." AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEM PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT? BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT WAS the name of the GOD THAT HAD SENT MOSES AND HAD BUILT THE OLD TESTAMENT LAW. HE SAID, "I AM THAT I AM." AND JESUS WAS THERE TO FULFILL EVERYTHING THAT MOSES HAD SPOKE ABOUT HIM. JESUS DIDN'T COME TO DO AWAY WITH THE LAW. HE COME TO FULFILL THE LAW. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THE LAW WASN'T DONE AWAY WITH. THE LAW WAS FULFILLED IN JESUS CHRIST. NOW YOU AND I ARE NOT UNDER LAW AND PROPHETS. WE ARE UNDER THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, THE BLOOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CAN GET A HOLD OF SOMEBODY THIS MORNING. I'LL tell you what he can do. Amen. Amen. He can COME RIGHT HERE AND TAKE FULL POSSESSION of your body. Do you know that? He has a right to make full claims of the body that is here. Amen. Now, now you know as you're as you're looking into this, of course, people say, "Well, Brother Wayne, you know, why why do y'all talk about an end time message? What's the point?" You know, that's a good question. Honestly, it is. &gt;&gt; It is honestly a good question because if the cross and the blood did everything, [snorts] &gt;&gt; then why would there be any need for anything else? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. That's a that's a good question, isn't it? But do you know after the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus, after the great atonements that he made that Apostle Paul come to that young church? And he said, "Look, folks, grievous wolves are about to enter this flock." &gt;&gt; And he said, "They're going to take away the truth. &gt;&gt; Grievous wolves are going to come." And Paul began to prophesy. Jude not over 30 years from the death of our Lord Jesus already began to say he was going to contend for the faith in the book of second Peter almost a exact replica of the book of Jude and he starts talking about false prophets coming among them and they were going to be leading the people astray what was they doing they was leading them away from the great sacrifice that God had made for humanity &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; you know one of the greatest scriptures in the Bible John chapter 3 can you pull that of go to John chapter 3 and and and you know the 16th verse. Go to John chapter 3. Look at the 16th verse and look at what the Bible so beautiful how it reads. For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but him that have everlasting life. Look at the next verses. He said, "For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved, &gt;&gt; that he that believeth on him is not condemned. But he that believeth not is condemned &gt;&gt; already." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. &gt;&gt; Now, it isn't it odd that it says in the name of the only BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD. It doesn't just say in the name of Jesus. Isn't that odd to you? Amen. But you you you GOT TO REALIZE THE BIBLE tells us why. It said you can only worship in the gate where HE PUTS HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; NOW PAUL IS TELLING YOU ABOUT DISPENSATIONAL TRUTHS. AMEN. And he's telling you there's more than ONE GATE. AND MAYBE GOD USED a gate one time and he used a gate another time. And he used the Pentecost and the Lutheran and the Baptist and he used all these gates. &gt;&gt; But there's one where he put his name. Now, brother Bram tells us this, and this is a very very beautiful uh uh uh statement from a prophet. He says, "The word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, when when you hear the word, to believe upon that word is to believe upon the name of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you can't believe on the name of God by believing some denominational nonsense that's been taught about him. &gt;&gt; Now, watch &gt;&gt; when you start looking at this that there's a reason the scripture says it in Isaiah chapter 60. I won't be too much longer. In Isaiah the 60th chapter, watch in the first verses. HE SAYS, "ARISE and shine, for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you." Do you know the light of God is supposed to shine in the end time? &gt;&gt; Zechariah chapter 14, look at the seventh verse in the 16th verse or the sixth and seventh verses. Amen. Zechariah tells a clear statement. Amen. That in the evening time there shall be light. In Zechariah, not Zephaniah. Sorry, I got ahead of you here. I'm doing it for for timing. Amen. In Zechariah, he said, "In the evening time, there shall be light." Isaiah says, "Arise, shine, there's coming light." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Zachchariah says, "In the evening there shall be light." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's amazing to me that the Bible also says in Malachi 4 that God would send Elijah the prophet before the grateful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Malachi 4 and:5. In Luke 17, Jesus prophesies of the same thing and says, "So shall it be when the son of man IS REVEALED." WHO IS the son of man? It's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; IT'S TO BE REVEALED in the end times. SEE, IT'S NOT ANOTHER GOSPEL. THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING IS NOT SOME OTHER GOSPEL MADE UP BY SOME OTHER PROPHET OR LIKE JOSEPH SMITH OR THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN FROM GOD'S OWN LIPS. And in the end time, he promised you to return to the original word of the living God. Look, it shall be light about the evening time. Is that right? Evening time. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it's evening time of the ages? &gt;&gt; In the evening time, there shall come light. &gt;&gt; Now listen. What good does light do without eyes? And do you know the body of Christ is like a human body? It's built from the feet up. &gt;&gt; And do you know in the ages throughout the ages that we were in a foot and then we were in the legs and we were in the hips and the church has grown in progression of the human body throughout the ages. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see Pentecost in that lip tongue. You you've seen it. &gt;&gt; But the next part of the BODY WAS THE EYES. YEAH. &gt;&gt; And what is the eyes of a of a people? It's a prophetic. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE EYES. NOW, WHAT good would light come and there not be eyes TO CATCH THE LIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHY TURN ON A LIGHT IF THERE WAS NO EYES IN THE BODY? BUT A PROPHET IS AN EYE TO THE BODY. AND WHEN GOD SENT a light in the evening time, he also sent a prophet in the evening time that would BE A LIGHT TO THE BODY. AND WHEN HE CATCHES THAT LIGHT, he begins to shine light upon certain parts and upon the word of God. Now, if you're if you're if you're with me now, I'm not going to be long. Look in Matthew chapter 6. And watch this in the closing. Now, Jesus himself, speaking of light, he says, "The light of the body is the eye. &gt;&gt; And if thine eye be single, thine whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thine whole body shall be full of darkness. And if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, oh, how great your darkness. &gt;&gt; Now, what's Jesus talking about? &gt;&gt; He's talking about your understanding of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, if what you're believing about his word, let's just say it's new light, you got to be careful your new light isn't darkening the light that God has sent. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I I'll read it to you again. Luke chapter uh uh Luke chapter 11 and uh we'll look in the 32nd verse. Uh let's see. &gt;&gt; No, let's go down to 34. The light of the body is the eyes. Jesus speaking. Therefore, when thine eye is single, thine whole body is full of light. But when thine eye is evil, thy body is full of darkness. &gt;&gt; Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. &gt;&gt; See now, Amen. If thine eye be dark, now watch. If thy if thine eye the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thine whole body therefore be full of light, there shall be having no part darkness, the whole shall be full of light. Even when the bright shining of a candle doeth light. Now look what he's telling you. When the light comes, if you have an eye to catch that light, &gt;&gt; then the whole body &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; will be full of light. If the light that you're catching is darkness. Now, now this is not an old thought. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This goes back to Genesis the 3 chapter. &gt;&gt; When the serpent come in the garden and he started talking to Eve about the word, remember? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was one to make her wise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing that someone always wants to make you a little wiser? &gt;&gt; They use knowledge. I got some new light on a subject. &gt;&gt; But you have to be careful that the light you're receiving is not darkness. &gt;&gt; See, BECAUSE EVE DIDN'T BECOME WISER. BROTHER BAM SAID, "LOOK, IN THE DAY AND SATAN SAYS IN THE DAY THAT YOU EATETH." AMEN. AMEN. AND SHE SAID, "GOD SAID I DIE THAT YOU MIGHT MAKE ME WISER in the worldly terms, but you're GOING TO KILL ME SPIRITUALLY." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IF IF YOUR EYE be single, IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU HAVE A PLACE ONLY FOR THE WORD OF GOD, THEN YOUR EYE is it's a light and it's a light upon you. And you say, "Now, Brother Wayne, now what's this got all to do with what you're preaching about?" Amen. Now, now think about this just a moment. You've got to have light, folks. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND JOHN SAYS IT. If you walk in the light, &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; AS HE is in the light, THEN YOU HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM. and his blood cleanseth thee from all your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see the Bible tells us this? THAT THE SACRIFICE THAT GOD MADE, God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. And sister Mariah, everybody is saved by that sacrifice. You know that's true. If a baby dies in the womb of a mother, that's a saved baby. IF A BABY DIES BEFORE IT COMES, AMEN, to the age of accountability, that's a saved baby. Amen. THE BLOOD OF JESUS. AMEN. IT FIXED THE SIN THAT CAUSED THE WORLD'S SIN. IT WAS WHAT happened in THE GARDEN AND JESUS FIXED IT ALL. AMEN. BUT IF YOU COME PAST the age of accountability, you got TO ACCEPT IT. BUT WITH THAT SACRIFICE, EVERY PERSON IN THE WORLD ought to be saved. THERE OUGHT NOT BE ONE LOST person in this world. WITH THE SACRIFICE OF GOD'S OWN SON AND THE COVENANT BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE PERSON IN THIS WORLD THAT is lost. But I can use your Bible and prove that there will be. &gt;&gt; My Bible says that they have to enlarge the borders of hell. &gt;&gt; There shouldn't be anybody lost. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "HOW DID THEY GET LOST?" BECAUSE people got new light. &gt;&gt; Because they got new light. DO YOU KNOW WITH ALL THAT SACRIFICE, BROTHER ASHTON? YOU know what's amazing is that if you take the light off of it, there's no sacrifice at all. Can you imagine the great blood of Jesus Christ can exist and it not be your sacrifice? You said, "How's that happen?" Go to Hebrews the 10th chapter and watch it. The Bible said, "He that sins and willfully disbelieves once he's heard the truth." He said, "Now he hath no more sacrifice." NOW, WHAT'S THAT MEAN? HE'S NOT TALKING TO A BELIEVER. NOW, AMEN. You You got to get that out of your mind. HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN AGE THAT'S LOOKING AT THE SACRIFICE OF JESUS CHRIST AND SOME DENOMINATION IS PUTTING BLINDERS over their EYES AND THEY'RE THROWING THE LIGHT OFF OF THE BLOOD. THEY'RE THROWING THE LIGHT OFF OF THE POWER OF GOD AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S IN THE CHURCH OR it's in the teacher, it's in this, IT'S IN THIS, BUT IT'S NOT IN THAT SACRIFICE. BUT WHEN A PROPHET of God come to THE EARTH, HE TOOK THIS CHURCH AND EXALTED THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. HE SAID, "YOUR CHURCH CAN'T SAVE YOU. YOUR PREACHER CAN'T SAVE YOU. THERE AIN'T NOBODY CAN SAVE YOU. SHAKING MY HAND CAN'T SAVE YOU. COMING TO AN ALTAR CAN'T SAVE YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. MY PUT A LIGHT BACK ON THE SACRIFICE. IT IS THE BLOOD THAT DESTROYS SIN. IT'S THE BLOOD THAT SAVES DRUNKERS. IT'S THE BLOOD THAT DELIVERS ALCOHOLICS. IT'S THE BLOOD THAT BRINGS DRUG ADDICTS AND MAKES PREACHERS OUT OF THEM. IT'S THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. PUT A LIGHT ON THE SACRIFICE. DO YOU SEE WHAT the message is doing? It's putting a light on the original SACRIFICE TO TAKE A man and CLEAN HIM UP SO MUCH THAT HE COULD MANIFEST JESUS CHRIST THE SAME AS JESUS DID WHEN HE WAS UPON THE EARTH. Let me tell you this. I KNOW THAT GOD CAME AND CLAIMED THE BODY OF Jesus as a lamb of God. But that same God is looking for a bride body THIS MORNING. THE SAME GOD that said, "Behold the lamb OF GOD AND TOOK THAT LAMB TO A SACRIFICE IS THE SAME GOD THAT PROPHESIED IN HEBREWS 1 THAT HE WOULD POSSESS a body." WHOSE BODY? YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; NOW, you got to think about that just a moment because ever since you've been a little boy, the devil's been telling you that you don't belong to him and you're for somebody and there's this spirit here. And Amen. I know how it is. Chase these little girls around and say YOU'RE NERVOUS NOW AND AND I YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING to be nervous and you're always going to be LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE WHAT A LIE. [screaming] PUT ANOTHER LIGHT ON IT. JESUS BLOOD WAS SACRIFICED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A CLAIM TO YOU THIS MORNING. LISTEN, THE DEVIL DON'T HAVE A CLAIM. THE DEVIL'S A LIAR. HE'S GIVEN YOU A NEW LIGHT. ONE THAT DESTROYS THE BLOOD OF THE SACRIFICE OF JESUS CHRIST. BUT THIS MESSAGE HAS come to claim believers for the word of God. LISTEN, I KNOW THAT THIS LED TOAN'S TRYING TO CLAIM OUR YOUNG BELIEVERS. THEY'RE TRYING TO CLAIM them for their clothing. Make a MAKE MOVIE STARS OUT OF THEM. MAKE MAKE A A BALL CHAMPIONS OUT OF THEM. Make game champions OUT OF THEM. I TELL YOU THIS MORNING AS A PASTOR OVER THIS CONGREGATION, I CLAIM YOU. AND I CLAIM YOU FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. I CLAIM YOU FOR THE TEACHINGS OF THE BIBLE IN THE LAST DAYS. NOT JUST ANOTHER CHURCH, BUT A BRIDE BODY JESUS HIMSELF can step into. &gt;&gt; He's come to claim you. &gt;&gt; And if you put enough light on the sacrifice, if you let this message be preached without darkening it with man's ideas, &gt;&gt; there's not one person in this building can't be saved. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you was born. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you was illegitimate or born TO A DRUNKARD'S FAMILY. IF YOU PUT THE RIGHT light on this sacrifice, IT COULD TAKE THAT ILLEGITIMATE BIRTH AND MAKE YOU A LEGITIMATE SON OF GOD. PUT THE RIGHT LIGHT ON IT. BROTHER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BORN TO THE BRANDON FAMILY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BORN IN THE LAWSON FAMILY OR THE ERICSON FAMILY. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT FAMILY YOU'VE BEEN BORN INTO. AS LONG AS YOU'RE BIRTHED UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, PUT THE RIGHT LIGHT ON IT. &gt;&gt; There's not a person in this room can't be saved right now with the right light. &gt;&gt; You You light up this sacrifice and it'll clean the hands of the dirtiest hearts. It'll clean any heart. IT'LL SANCTIFY ANY LIFE. IT'LL SAVE THE ONE. I DON'T CARE HOW LOST. I DON'T CARE HOW TROUBLED. WELL, I TELL YOU, BROTHER WAYNE, you don't know. I was born in the home of an alcoholic. That's all right. William Brandon was carrying water to a moonshine steel WHEN THE PILLAR OF FIRE APPEARED to him. That went your excuse, didn't it? You ain't got any EXCUSES LEFT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW DOWN YOUR WATER POT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW DOWN YOUR YOUR IDEAS AND YOUR TRADITIONS AND YOU MIGHT COME TO JESUS AND SAY, "LORD, USE ME FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO USE ME FOR." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. Yeah, I I can't be used because I was born in a drunkard's home. Amen. But Taz, stand up right there. As you witness, YOU AIN'T GOT any more excuses. I don't care what kind of home you come OUT OF. YOU CAN BE a man of God. YOU CAN BE A LEADER. YOU CAN RAISE CHILDREN THAT BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. YOU CAN BE SOLID. YOU CAN BE AN ELDER. YOU CAN BE A PART OF A BODY. [applause] THERE'S NO MORE EXCUSES LEFT. COME ON, CHURCH. MAYBE SOME OF YOU WERE BORN INTO BAD HOMES AND YOU SAID, "WELL, BROTHER, I COULD NEVER DO IT." I TELL YOU, THAT'S THE BIGGEST LIE THAT'S EVER BEEN TOLD. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. It don't matter what your birth is or what your raising was. Oh, I tell you they I tell you they got a lot of trouble cuz the way they was raised and they can't never and humanly I believe you're you GOT A GOOD POINT. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A NEW birth now. AND IF YOU SHINE THE RIGHT LIGHT on that new birth, A PERSON CAN START SURRENDERING TO THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST AND THEIR HERITAGE CHANGES AND THEIR NATURE CHANGES AND THEIR ATTITUDE CHANGES. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BLOOD. THE BLOOD OF JESUS. THE BLOOD THAT SAVES, THE BLOOD THAT SANCTIFIES, THE BLOOD THAT SPEAKS. DON'T TALK TO me about LAW AND PROPHETS. I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE GRACE OF GOD THAT HAS COVERED THIS GENERATION. I'M TALKING ABOUT the one THAT SAVED ME AND SANCTIFIED ME, FILLED ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND PUT ME IN A PULL PIT TO TELL THE WORLD HE IS A GOD THAT CAN SAVE YOU, SANCTIFY YOU, FEEL YOU. HE'S NOT DEAD, YOUNG PEOPLE. HE IS ALIVE AND HE'S RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING THIS MORNING WITH POWER. &gt;&gt; Put some LIGHT ON IT. PUT SOME LIGHT ON IT. HE'S THE HOLY GHOST. HE STILL SPEAKS WITH TONGUES. HE STILL SEE VISIONS. HE STILL RAISES THE DEAD. THERE'S GIFTS OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND PROPHECY. HE STILL CAUSES THE LAME TO WALK AND THE BLIND TO SEE. AND HE USES YOUR HANDS TO DO IT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; Put some light on it. &gt;&gt; Don't let some devil tell you God don't do that no more. &gt;&gt; He absolutely does it. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, you you're just too far shot, man. God can't do nothing to you. What a lie from hell. &gt;&gt; That's right. trying to darken the light on the sacrifice of God. &gt;&gt; Whether it's coming, &gt;&gt; y'all know I'm in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And Paul said they would transform themselves into angels of light. &gt;&gt; But you better be careful. Your light's not darkness. &gt;&gt; That's far enough there. &gt;&gt; But you see what happens? People begin to darken &gt;&gt; and they take away the sacrifice. That's what they done throughout the ages. &gt;&gt; That's why the message of William Brandham is not about William Brandom. &gt;&gt; But just because you say I'm a man follower, you will not take my liberty to believe what God done in this generation. &gt;&gt; I refuse. &gt;&gt; I refuse to let people take my liberty to quote a prophet, to believe a prophet, to follow a prophet. the one God sent to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, this this world's strong with their unbelief, folks. &gt;&gt; They get right up in your face with their unbelief. &gt;&gt; But for some reason, when the light of God shines, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; but it shined in my path. It saved me. &gt;&gt; And let me promise you, if he saved me, but he saved you. &gt;&gt; Come on. There ain't a person in this building this morning he can't take and use your life the way he ordained it to mean &gt;&gt; but you're going to have to let some light on the sacrifice &gt;&gt; you're going to have to let us put some light on the sacrifice &gt;&gt; and when you do it'll start getting empowered &gt;&gt; it'll power it'll it'll come in manifestation in your life it begins to take over somebody sitting here this morning you need the Holy Ghost and you're saying, "Brother, I've got this issue and I got this issue." See, you're focused in the wrong place now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's Satan darkening. &gt;&gt; He's darkening the light on the sacrifice. Listen, no matter how you're born, no matter where you're born, no matter what your attitude was. Do you know we brother said this clearly? He said he would ignore your doctrine to give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. because really intellectually, I don't care what your doctrine was. It ain't right till you get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You didn't have him this morning. You didn't have the Holy Spirit this Maybe you're sitting here this morning wondering. Let me tell you, let me tell you this. The Holy Ghost is real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I know some of you may be wondered for the Holy Ghost, didn't they? Yes. &gt;&gt; Do y'all know why they did that? &gt;&gt; It was 10 days from the resurrection of Christ, the 40 days &gt;&gt; until the 50th, which was Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And God was waiting on the 50th day, which met the festival laws that he had set up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God came on that 50th day. They didn't tar 10 days to pray for the Holy Ghost. Right. &gt;&gt; They used those 10 days to get themselves out of the way. But the Holy Ghost fell on the 50th day, which tells us this. You don't have to come up here and tar at the altar. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost came 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But look, look, if you you said, "Brother Wayne, I need prayer." Listen, if you need prayer one time or you need prayer hund times, &gt;&gt; don't quit &gt;&gt; till you get the Holy Ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't quit. [applause] &gt;&gt; Just keep coming. And when you RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, you'll know you did. And then you it'll be satisfied in you. &gt;&gt; But but watch now. Don't give up on it &gt;&gt; because it's real. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I mean, how many here got the Holy Ghost? If you got the Holy Ghost, just stand on your feet right now. If you got the Holy Ghost, I want you to stand on your feet. And if you're looking for the Holy Ghost, I want you to look around the building just a moment. &gt;&gt; It's just real, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you want to if you want to receive it, go on and stand up with them and become a part of it &gt;&gt; and look around and say, "Well, I'll tell you this. This is a real thing. This is real people. This is a real life experience &gt;&gt; and I could have it." If our musicians would come this morning, &gt;&gt; I certainly believe today. I believe Hebrews chapter 1:es 1 and two is not discussing the end of God &gt;&gt; or the end of the work of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is discussing a further manifestation of the same God. &gt;&gt; It just changed dispensations. &gt;&gt; And oh, how we if we could see it for them, how we are to see it this morning. Dispensational changes. God has moved in this in this age in such a way. It's not a different God. &gt;&gt; It's the same Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's just the same right now &gt;&gt; as he ever was. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts right now. Father God, Lord, I've spoke my heart to these believers. They they've endured many scriptures. Lord, I I have put so much word out this morning. Maybe even just the mind can't even conceive the scriptures that's been given. But Father, I know when I give your word, I know it's true. &gt;&gt; And as we have spoke the truth over this congregation, Lord, I pray that the God of this Bible that you would move upon the heart of your children, Lord, in today. May you destroy every dark place, anything that would cause darkness on this sacrifice, any word spoken by any man, any ideas, any teachings, anyone that would hold up and say that it ain't the same, that Jesus ain't the same, his healing ain't the same, his mercy ain't. I pray this morning, Lord, that your light would shine in on that sacrifice and that every heart this morning would know that that sacrifice lays open for them today. If they have a need, Father, I pray they could receive it right now. I pray, Lord, that through the gift of your spirit, may as you move among your congregation, Lord, let us release things that are trying to make claim to our life. Let us release the things that are trying to take control. And Lord Jesus, we want to give it to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. &gt;&gt; He's my master, Savior. [music] Yes, he is. Jesus like a fragrance [singing] after through the [singing] rain. [music] Jesus. [singing] Jesus. [music] Jesus, [singing] [music] let all heaven and [music] earth proclaim. [singing] [music] Kings [music and singing] and kingdoms shall all [singing] [music] pass away. [singing] [music] My [singing] Jesus, [music] Jesus, [singing] [music] Jesus. [singing] There's just something [music] about [singing] that name. [music] passes [music] through Jesus [music and singing] like a fragment [singing] [music] the rain. Oh [music] my Jesus. [singing] Jesus. [music] Jesus. [music and singing] And all heaven and [music and singing] earth proclaim [music and singing] [singing] [music] shall [music] pass. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Father, [music] [singing] kings and kingdoms.
