[48:32] God goes before you say, "Let there be."
[48:36] He's healing your wounds. setting free.
[48:40] Sending his angels fighting from all
[48:43] sides, leading the way as he is the
[48:47] guide. Trust in him. He will never fail.
[48:52] He walks with you along this rugged
[48:55] trail. Just lift up your hands. This is
[48:59] your victory day. Give him the praise
[49:02] and worship the Lord.
[49:07] Heat. Heat.
[49:19] worship.
[49:37] It's important
[49:40] to understand
[49:44] when God is speaking
[49:53] and sometimes he may seem
[49:57] to be silent
[49:59] but that's when he is working
[50:07] Oh, but just have patience.
[50:12] Just wait and see what our mighty God
[50:18] will do.
[50:25] Oh, when you lift up your hands,
[50:32] God will pull you through.
[50:35] We worship you now.
[50:38] Hallelujah.
[50:41] Oh worship.

[51:07] praise
[51:11] before you say, "Let there be." He's
[51:14] healing your voice and setting you free.
[51:18] He's sending his angels fighting from
[51:21] all sides
[51:23] away.
[51:26] Trust in him. He will never fail. He
[51:31] walks with you.
[51:49] I
[51:53] worship God.
[52:01] Worship.
[52:05] Worship.
[52:11] Oh,
[52:13] I love
[52:15] you.
[52:25] Yeah.
[52:27] Heat.
[52:37] Worship
[52:45] the Lord.
[52:58] worship.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to worship him,
[53:08] things just begin to change. Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; I've been in the countries of the of the
[53:15] uh worshippers of idols. And I've seen
[53:18] out in the streets and you go with them
[53:20] and you see people standing and they
[53:23] maybe bring a sick baby and lay it
[53:25] before a stone idol and that's their god
[53:27] of healing. And then they have another
[53:29] god around the corner, an idol, and it's
[53:31] a god of peace. And then they have a a
[53:34] god of understanding and a god of
[53:36] fertility. And and when they want
[53:38] something, they go worship at the feet
[53:40] of that idol.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; But you know, uh that's a a man-made
[53:44] idol. Yeah.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And it's a demon power that allows
[53:47] someone to believe that they can receive
[53:49] something from that stone.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; But yet, we have been given the grace,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; amen, to know the name of Jesus Christ.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to worship him, he's
[53:58] the God of peace.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; He's the God of understanding. He's the
[54:02] God of mercy. He's the God of truth.
[54:05] Amen. He is God. And when a worshipper
[54:08] begins to worship him, the things from
[54:10] him begins to come back upon the
[54:11] worshipper. Maybe you'll walk away never
[54:14] the same. You know, you come to the
[54:16] house of God like this on a on a service
[54:18] and you you come and gather in here and
[54:21] people say, you know, what what good
[54:23] does it do? But see, this is God's
[54:25] program of power.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; This is God's program to for saints to
[54:30] gather together and to worship him in
[54:32] song and in music and then and then in
[54:35] front of the word. And then the word
[54:37] begins to be preached. And as the word
[54:39] preaches, uh it casts out spirits. It
[54:42] drives back the enemy. It It forces the
[54:45] devil to leave the mind while the word
[54:47] begins to work in the heart. And under
[54:49] the power of the spoken word,
[54:51] deliverances begin to happen. Things
[54:53] that that you maybe took a lifetime,
[54:56] you've not understood how to do it, but
[54:58] all of a sudden under the preaching of
[55:00] the word, everything has changed.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Just in that moment, it it completely
[55:04] will change you. I I think brother
[55:07] brother Howard's son Jonathan was in a
[55:08] meeting here a couple years ago and he
[55:10] said, "You know, I've spent my whole
[55:12] life in the message." But in one
[55:14] service, in one service, he come into
[55:16] the presence of the living God and he
[55:19] walked away and said, "I found what I
[55:20] was looking for."
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And you know, that might be where you
[55:23] are tonight. You You may be looking for
[55:26] something and and wondering what it is,
[55:28] but right here in one service, it can
[55:30] forever change your life. Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Something you struggle with your heart,
[55:34] your life, something in there and you
[55:36] you're looking for an answer. But when
[55:38] you begin to pull on the word of God, it
[55:39] it it immediately has the power to
[55:42] change. And I certainly believe tonight
[55:44] that we have gathered in this place.
[55:46] Amen. In in a way to welcome the mighty
[55:49] God among us.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And he is his word. Amen. I I know you
[55:53] want to invite him. And I think often of
[55:56] Brother Brandham when he said that he'll
[55:58] come where he's invited. Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; If we had a nicer place to offer him
[56:04] tonight, we we would give it to him. We
[56:06] we would give him the best that we could
[56:08] give him. But right now, this is where
[56:10] we are, this building, what we have.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; But we want to make him welcome.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to welcome him in this
[56:16] place and invite him, open the door to
[56:20] him. Leotaa's got the door closed, but I
[56:23] I I stand here tonight and and and as a
[56:26] as a as a pastor standing here, I I want
[56:30] to open the door.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; I want to say, Lord, this door
[56:34] &gt;&gt; is open to you.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And to every manifestation of your life.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; We want you more than in the front door.
[56:41] We want you to walk into every corridor.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Healing and power. These men of God
[56:47] sitting here all in the in in one
[56:48] agreement. the the people are in
[56:50] agreement. How many would just open the
[56:52] door tonight and say, "Lord, come on in
[56:53] this place.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Come on in here and deal with my heart,
[56:56] my life, my family. We invite you to
[56:59] this platform tonight, Lord." And Amen.
[57:01] We are going to invite Brother Ronnie
[57:03] Long. Amen. A a real gifted uh young
[57:06] man. He's here in our assembly, but we
[57:09] we certainly appreciate the gift that
[57:11] God has placed in his life. And I've
[57:14] seen God use him many times. Uh,
[57:16] brother, uh, I I I don't want to brag
[57:19] too much because these brothers are in
[57:20] our church, but you know, uh, last night
[57:23] hearing, uh, brother Nathan, brother
[57:25] Isaac speak these things, uh, you know,
[57:28] uh, to hear that level of of the of the
[57:31] word.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Coming out of a young man.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I was just sitting there and I was
[57:37] listening to that. I look over at
[57:39] Brother Ray and I hear him hollering,
[57:40] "Amen." And I was thinking, "There is a
[57:42] chip off the old block right there."
[57:45] I tell you man, uh I was just thinking
[57:48] what a you know uh I don't want to take
[57:51] but long but I really want to say this
[57:53] you know I remember when I first come in
[57:55] ministry I was what about 23 what are
[57:57] you now 26 and I was about 23 years old
[58:02] and there was an elder brother been
[58:03] around brother Brown a lot and I went to
[58:05] hear him in these meetings down in
[58:07] Arkansas and he come in there and oh
[58:10] within about the first hour or two of
[58:12] the meeting within two or three days
[58:14] there. He just started talking and he
[58:17] was saying openly
[58:19] that there was no more uh men on the
[58:22] field and God was done and and and what
[58:27] are we going to do cuz there ain't no
[58:29] young men coming up and they I mean he
[58:32] he was I was so discouraged when I left
[58:34] there. I thought my goodness
[58:36] is you know does anybody see the future?
[58:38] Is there any vision? you know, and and
[58:40] then um so, you know, I I look back at
[58:44] that and then I sit there last night and
[58:46] hear Brother Ericson
[58:48] and see the the training that he has put
[58:51] in brother Isaac through all these
[58:53] years.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; And to see that God has men with vision
[58:57] that knows
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; knows how to take the the the message
[59:01] that was on the tapes
[59:03] &gt;&gt; and put it into a generation that's
[59:05] going to make it live.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and we're hearing this
[59:09] generation and the revelation of this
[59:11] message, knowing this that if if if
[59:14] there is a tomorrow, this message will
[59:17] live on.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; There are there are young men catching
[59:20] this revelation
[59:22] &gt;&gt; that'll preach this with power and
[59:24] reality. And and and I'm I'm not just
[59:26] speaking of Brother Isaac alone, but
[59:28] he's a great example last night for all
[59:30] of the men of God. Amen. Of what is what
[59:32] this message is about. And and we
[59:34] certainly want to thank him for it. And
[59:36] tonight we we know, amen, that that
[59:39] Brother Ronnie is a is a is a a
[59:41] tremendous man of God with a great gift.
[59:43] But I've seen the Lord use Brother
[59:45] Ronnie in a very supernatural manner.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And he's moved in behind and took care
[59:50] of some things uh that I've watched it
[59:53] personally happen. And so tonight, I
[59:56] know the availability
[59:58] of the supernatural is in this building.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you'll have confidence and
[1:00:05] begin to pull on the anointing of God,
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; you'll leave here different than you
[1:00:10] can.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; We want to invite him tonight. We want
[1:00:13] to invite more than our brother Ronnie.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; We want to invite our Lord Jesus to take
[1:00:18] a hold of a young man's life
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; and use him for his glory. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:22] Let's let's invite him tonight. Amen.
[1:00:24] Brother
[1:00:26] Ben.
[1:00:28] Oh hell king Jesus.
[1:00:36] Oh
[1:00:40] man,
[1:00:45] the king of kings.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Is he your king?
[1:00:54] Oh,
[1:01:10] heat, heat.
[1:01:28] One more time.
[1:01:38] Jesus.
[1:01:47] Heat. Heat.
[1:02:00] He's the bright
[1:02:02] starity.
[1:02:17] I'm going to praise
[1:02:21] him
[1:02:27] forever.
[1:02:31] I
[1:02:33] will
[1:02:35] with thee.

[1:02:40] all hand
[1:02:43] throughout
[1:02:45] eternity.
[1:02:50] I'm going to praise
[1:02:54] him
[1:02:59] forever.
[1:03:04] I
[1:03:06] will reign
[1:03:08] with you.
[1:03:13] Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. just to think this is just the
[1:03:17] beginning of the longest worship service
[1:03:20] that there ever was.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; We're over in eternity. We'll still be
[1:03:23] worshiping.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe that we have to wait
[1:03:26] till we cross over all the way. I
[1:03:28] believe we can start that uh that mighty
[1:03:30] reunion here and worship him all the way
[1:03:33] into glory tonight. Amen. We just are
[1:03:35] thankful to be in the house of the Lord
[1:03:36] with you this evening and uh just
[1:03:39] amongst uh such such believers that
[1:03:42] would come out on a Saturday evening and
[1:03:44] the rain and the cold, but knowing that
[1:03:46] there's a there's a greater reward for
[1:03:49] those that can overcome the storm. Amen.
[1:03:52] I like it. I I know there's a storm
[1:03:54] going on outside, but I like what
[1:03:56] brother Isaac said. I believe there's a
[1:03:58] storm going on inside as well. Amen. And
[1:04:01] we just thank the Lord and certainly
[1:04:02] appreciate your time and confidence to
[1:04:05] be here tonight. Amen. We just thank you
[1:04:07] for the songs and the specials that were
[1:04:10] sung.
[1:04:12] Amen. We just trust the Lord has been
[1:04:13] working on your hearts tonight as
[1:04:16] he uh has prepared us in the way. Just
[1:04:19] turn to the book of Matthew, the 11th
[1:04:21] chapter.
[1:04:22] Just get into the word tonight. And
[1:04:26] they told me there's cold sandwiches, so
[1:04:28] they can't get any colder. So, we're not
[1:04:30] in a hurry. Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:33] Amen.
[1:04:36] Taco Bell's not good for you anyway.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven's not here. I could say
[1:04:43] they get away with that.
[1:04:47] Amen. Good to have my parents with with
[1:04:50] us tonight.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. came in and uh just appreciate
[1:04:55] them and certainly appreciate you know
[1:05:00] you know as you're a young man and and
[1:05:02] maybe you're a young man tonight and
[1:05:04] here and your your dad is always telling
[1:05:05] you no matter what happens this message
[1:05:08] is right
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; it it pays off down the road
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; you dads keep telling your kids whatever
[1:05:15] happens
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; this word is true
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; amen we can look back over the trials of
[1:05:20] life and see that this This one thing
[1:05:22] has never changed
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; and it always remains. Amen. Certainly
[1:05:27] good to have brother Diego with us. We
[1:05:28] got to hear from him and just spent a
[1:05:31] lot of time on the battlefield with my
[1:05:33] brother and found him to be a real man
[1:05:35] of God and mightily used by the Lord in
[1:05:38] this hour and I believe that there will
[1:05:40] be a great reward on the other side for
[1:05:44] the the diligence to bring this word to
[1:05:46] a
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; thank you
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; to a generation. Amen. Matthew the 11th
[1:05:50] chapter. We'll just begin at the third
[1:05:51] verse.
[1:05:54] And said unto him, "Art thou he that
[1:05:57] that should come, or do we look for
[1:06:00] another?" And Jesus answered and said
[1:06:02] unto them, "Go and show John again those
[1:06:05] things which ye do hear and see. The
[1:06:09] blind receive their sight, and the lame
[1:06:11] walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and
[1:06:13] the deaf hear, and the dead are raised
[1:06:15] up, and the poor have the gospel
[1:06:17] preached to them. And blessed is he
[1:06:20] whosoever shall not be offended in me.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And John asking a question at the
[1:06:28] changing of a dispensation.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Is this him?
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Or do we look for another?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; I would just like to title this tonight,
[1:06:37] this thought. Is this him
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; or do we look for another?
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just ask the Lord to bless
[1:06:43] this tonight. Father, we just love you.
[1:06:45] We thank you for your word in this age,
[1:06:47] Lord, that you Lord have chosen us,
[1:06:50] Lord, out of the Lord to think on a
[1:06:53] Saturday evening, Lord. The world is
[1:06:54] just in its chaos and its confusion, its
[1:06:57] darkness. But Lord, here tonight we have
[1:07:00] sanctuary, Father. We have a light in
[1:07:02] this age, Lord. It's it's your word that
[1:07:05] has come forth, Father. It's not a Lord
[1:07:08] a workup of emotion, but Lord, it's a
[1:07:10] manifestation of your presence, Father.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And Lord, how aware where we are, Lord,
[1:07:15] as Lord, as insufficient as we are as
[1:07:18] humans, Lord, but yet you chose before
[1:07:21] the foundation of the world, Lord, a an
[1:07:23] earthn vessel that you might have
[1:07:25] tabernacle there, Father. Lord, we just
[1:07:27] thank you for your grace to us, Lord. We
[1:07:29] just ask that you would just break open
[1:07:30] your bread to us as we may know you,
[1:07:33] Lord, along life's way tonight. We pray
[1:07:35] in Jesus name.
[1:07:37] Amen. You may be seated. Is this him or
[1:07:41] do we look for another? I could sum this
[1:07:43] message up real short. I told the
[1:07:44] brothers if you want me to, I can just
[1:07:46] preach about 30 seconds. And brother
[1:07:48] Jonathan, the answer is yes.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; I have I have seen the one that I'm
[1:07:57] looking for.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for another one or
[1:08:00] another one to come. I'm not looking for
[1:08:02] another dispensation or another era or
[1:08:05] another age or another prophet or
[1:08:06] another Messiah. This is the one that
[1:08:10] our eyes have been looking for. We're
[1:08:12] not looking for another one to come. And
[1:08:13] I I believe that that we have we have
[1:08:16] come too far to look back. Right? But I
[1:08:19] believe if we maintain the focus of
[1:08:21] forward, we'll realize we're already
[1:08:23] walking in the light of the Son of Man.
[1:08:25] We're not waiting for it to come. We're
[1:08:27] not waiting for revival to come. As
[1:08:29] brother Isaac said last night, we are in
[1:08:31] the middle of the bride's revival. This
[1:08:33] is the middle of the revival time. So,
[1:08:36] if you're if you're sitting there in
[1:08:38] yourself and you're wondering when is
[1:08:39] revival going to come or when are these
[1:08:41] great things going to happen, don't look
[1:08:43] for another thing to come. This is that
[1:08:45] that was prophesied that would come. And
[1:08:48] we are living in the in the fullness of
[1:08:50] times where all of the word has come
[1:08:52] together. to to sum it up, I'm going to
[1:08:55] take about an hour to get here, but the
[1:08:56] long answer, the short answer is yes.
[1:08:59] This is what we've been looking for.
[1:09:01] This message is what we've been waiting
[1:09:03] for. We're not waiting for another
[1:09:05] another angel or another messenger or
[1:09:07] another prophet or another gift of the
[1:09:09] Messa sign. This is what our hearts have
[1:09:12] longed for. This is what we've been
[1:09:14] predestined to receive in this age.
[1:09:17] Hallelujah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; As you can tell, I got a lot of here.
[1:09:20] I'm just going to preach.
[1:09:23] Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Three or four people said, "Just preach
[1:09:26] it." Well, that's what I intend to do.
[1:09:27] Revelations the 18th chapter.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; And after these things, I saw another
[1:09:33] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:09:36] power, and the earth was lightened with
[1:09:39] his glory.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And he cried mightily with a strong
[1:09:42] voice, saying, "Babylon." How he knows
[1:09:44] what Babylon is. It's confusion. So, we
[1:09:46] can say it like this. Confusion the
[1:09:48] great has fallen. There's a great
[1:09:50] confusion in Leodysia. Confusion the
[1:09:53] great has fallen because another mighty
[1:09:56] angel has already come down in this age
[1:09:59] and with a loud voice of a trumpet has
[1:10:01] said confusion has fallen and the earth
[1:10:05] was lightened with his glory. Now you
[1:10:07] know I I know I know maybe as a as a
[1:10:09] child uh you might might think maybe
[1:10:11] just children are afraid of the dark but
[1:10:13] I actually have a confession. I'm pretty
[1:10:15] afraid of the dark. I I I you know I was
[1:10:17] just working in a house this week and
[1:10:19] and the lights all went out. And I was
[1:10:21] in the basement of this place I've never
[1:10:22] been. I don't know anybody there.
[1:10:23] Actually, it was a big old huge house
[1:10:25] for sale. There was nobody there. And
[1:10:27] the power went out and I was down I was
[1:10:28] down in the basement where there's no
[1:10:30] light at all from the outside world. And
[1:10:32] I I got to be honest, brother Josh. I
[1:10:33] thought, well, I got to get up. I got to
[1:10:35] There was something I thought, well,
[1:10:36] what am I running from?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Kyle's laughing. He knows what
[1:10:40] I'm talking. What are you running from
[1:10:41] when you're in the dark?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; There's some fear there in the dark that
[1:10:45] you you don't know because you don't
[1:10:47] know what's out there, right? Or maybe
[1:10:49] you do know. Maybe you've seen a
[1:10:52] supernatural world enough to know what
[1:10:54] lays in dark places and what hides in
[1:10:56] darkness, right? And and and it it puts
[1:10:58] this feeling within you that when you're
[1:11:00] in the darkness, there's there's a fear
[1:11:01] that grips you somehow. And you're not
[1:11:03] thinking of any specific thing or any
[1:11:05] specific issue. But it's just something
[1:11:07] I got to get out of the dark. I I I got
[1:11:09] to get out of this darkness. I I got to
[1:11:11] get to where there's light because when
[1:11:12] I'm in light, then I'm safe. And you
[1:11:14] know, if we're all honest with each
[1:11:16] other, I'm sure we've come into a dark
[1:11:17] room. And the first thing we want to do
[1:11:18] is turn on the light, right? Because
[1:11:20] light brings it brings the darkness out
[1:11:23] of the room, right? It it causes light
[1:11:25] to overtake the darkness of the room.
[1:11:28] And now what was a mystery has been
[1:11:30] revealed.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Now it's not confusing to you anymore,
[1:11:33] but it has been revealed. And you can
[1:11:35] see, you know, Brother Isaac, you might
[1:11:37] be walking through the room in the
[1:11:38] morning when you're getting up real
[1:11:39] early and your wife's asleep. you got
[1:11:41] little babies and uh you know you you
[1:11:43] I'm speaking from experience and you
[1:11:44] just you get dressed in the dark and
[1:11:45] sometimes your shirt's on inside out and
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; you've tripped over something you don't
[1:11:50] know what it is but when you turn on the
[1:11:51] light
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; you see oh that's that's what that is
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; it's not confusing it's not dangerous
[1:11:58] it's not something that I should be
[1:11:59] scared of but when the lights turned on
[1:12:02] then all of the mystery has been
[1:12:04] revealed right well I believe this
[1:12:05] Revelations 18 has come down with power
[1:12:08] and authority in this age and the earth
[1:12:11] is lightened by the glory of the
[1:12:13] manifestation of the word in this hour.
[1:12:16] So there's nothing mysterious anymore.
[1:12:19] If I could say it shortly, Christ is the
[1:12:21] mystery of God revealed. That's why the
[1:12:24] message came to reveal to us, not to
[1:12:26] confuse us, not to mystify it, not to
[1:12:29] wrap us up in some kind of doctrine or
[1:12:30] some kind of man-made theology, but to
[1:12:33] reveal that his light has come in this
[1:12:36] age. And his light will remove all leoty
[1:12:39] and confusion. His light takes away the
[1:12:42] mystery of it. Right? Isaiah 9 would say
[1:12:44] this. The people that walked in darkness
[1:12:47] have seen a great light. As it was in
[1:12:50] those days, they didn't have a prophetic
[1:12:51] voice for 400 years. But Isaiah had
[1:12:55] prophesied 400 years before that that
[1:12:57] there would be a great light come.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; And even if you're in the valley of the
[1:13:01] shadow of death, there's a light coming.
[1:13:04] And then you're not in darkness anymore,
[1:13:07] but upon them hath the light shine. Is
[1:13:10] that you tonight?
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Ah, I'm thankful to be preaching some
[1:13:14] message, believers. Upon you has the
[1:13:17] light shined. I don't know if you know
[1:13:18] that, but that's you in the scripture.
[1:13:20] Upon you has this light shine. You say,
[1:13:23] "Well, that was speaking of of the
[1:13:25] Virgin Mary bringing forth the Christ
[1:13:26] child." But I would ask, how is it
[1:13:28] different than where we are living
[1:13:29] today? This is not another gospel. This
[1:13:33] is not another Christ which we're
[1:13:34] preaching to you. This is not another
[1:13:36] message. This is the same message that
[1:13:38] he was coming down in the womb of a
[1:13:41] Virgin Mary has come down in the womb of
[1:13:43] the church of the living God in this
[1:13:45] age. It's you, friend.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has overshadowed you.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to that word.
[1:13:55] Ephesians 5 would say, "For you were
[1:13:57] sometimes in darkness, but now are ye
[1:14:00] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[1:14:03] the light.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Don't stay still as children of the
[1:14:06] light. You know, one thing about light
[1:14:07] in the gospel, it's always progressing,
[1:14:09] right? So, you've got to move on with it
[1:14:11] or you get left behind in darkness. You
[1:14:13] can't just hold up and say, "Well, this
[1:14:15] was a good place to camp." But you've
[1:14:17] got to move on. When the light moves,
[1:14:19] you move. Now, we have the picture of
[1:14:20] the pillar of fire and we see it as a
[1:14:22] still picture. But actually, that that
[1:14:24] picture is moving. That was just a still
[1:14:27] photo of a moving fire. If you if you go
[1:14:29] back and listen to the tape, Brother
[1:14:30] Benham is constantly saying, "There it
[1:14:31] is over there. There it is over there.
[1:14:33] There it is over there." It's moving
[1:14:35] around. It's never stagnant. It's never
[1:14:37] still, but it's always on the move. And
[1:14:39] this word is never still. This word has
[1:14:42] no end. This word will never cease, but
[1:14:44] it's always on the move. And you've got
[1:14:47] to be children of the light, walking in
[1:14:49] the light. We're on the move, friend. We
[1:14:52] have been given orders to march on into
[1:14:55] the light. Ye are the children of the
[1:14:57] light of this hour.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; March on as Isaiah 60 would say, "Arise,
[1:15:02] shine." I'm not apologizing for
[1:15:03] repeating anything. Lord gave me this
[1:15:05] before. I'm just going to say we're
[1:15:07] going to repeat. Arise, shine for thy
[1:15:09] light. Whose light?
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Thy light has come. Is this him
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; or do we look for another?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Is this your light or do we look for
[1:15:19] another light to come? Thy light has
[1:15:22] come and is risen upon thee.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:28] Hallelujah.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; We're not in the darkness, friend.
[1:15:31] Behold that darkness shall cover the
[1:15:33] earth and grope darkness upon the
[1:15:35] people. But the Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But the Lord.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; You could have been in darkness of
[1:15:43] Leodysa. You could have been in
[1:15:44] confusion of Babylon. But the Lord. Oh,
[1:15:48] hallelujah. Brother Kyle, you could
[1:15:49] still be on the side of the road as a
[1:15:51] 16-year-old boy. But the Lord, you could
[1:15:54] have been wrapped up in some false
[1:15:55] doctrine somewhere under some nickelian
[1:15:58] theology. But the Lord, but the Lord has
[1:16:02] shined upon you. His mercy has renewed
[1:16:05] in your life. But the Lord shall raise
[1:16:07] you out. But the Lord shall raise up a
[1:16:09] standard. But the Lord shall change your
[1:16:12] situation. But the Lord shall heal you.
[1:16:15] But the Lord shall reveal himself to
[1:16:17] you. But the Lord shall make all things
[1:16:19] new in you. But the Lord has risen upon
[1:16:23] the church in this age. I don't know
[1:16:25] about you, friend, but I've seen his
[1:16:26] light. I've seen his star, and I've come
[1:16:29] to worship him. I'm
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; not waiting for the star to appear. I've
[1:16:33] already seen it. I've been a witness, a
[1:16:35] partaker,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; and his glory
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; shall be seen upon thee.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; This is not a good place for a frowning
[1:16:46] believer.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; God's glory don't look like this.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; His glory has risen upon you.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I borrow one from my buddy brother
[1:17:11] Timothy.
[1:17:12] Do you know you're saved?
[1:17:14] Notify your face.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; That's why, brother Nathaniel, I don't
[1:17:21] care if people get mad if I have a good
[1:17:22] time at church, cuz his glory has risen
[1:17:25] upon me. His glory has shined upon me. I
[1:17:28] know that I was headed for destruction,
[1:17:31] but his glory has been seen upon my
[1:17:34] life. And I know that he had made a
[1:17:36] change, and I turned from where I was
[1:17:38] going and turned in the direction of
[1:17:40] upward. His glory has been shown upon
[1:17:43] us. That's what healing comes through
[1:17:45] the room. It's his glory
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; that's being shown upon you. His glory
[1:17:49] has made all things new.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And his glory has come down in the
[1:17:54] stage. Darkness is is in the worst
[1:17:56] conditions it's ever been. Right
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; for the Leodysian church. But we're not
[1:18:01] of the Leodysian church. We're of a
[1:18:04] bride church in a bride age under a
[1:18:06] bride light in bride time under a bride
[1:18:09] glory in this hour. This is a new day. I
[1:18:12] know it's Saturday night, but I'm going
[1:18:13] to say shalom.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Good morning to the church. Good morning
[1:18:18] to the believer. We are in the victory
[1:18:21] lane. We are onward and upward. We're
[1:18:23] not looking down. We're not discouraged.
[1:18:25] We're not afraid.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Peace be unto you. Good morning,
[1:18:32] friends.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Good morning, friends. Lamentations.
[1:18:39] This I recall to my mind. Therefore have
[1:18:41] I hope. It is of the Lord's mercies that
[1:18:43] we are not consumed because his
[1:18:45] compassions fail not.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; They are new.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Every morning.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; It's morning time, friends.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; It means you're laying aside the former
[1:18:58] things. You're laying down the weights
[1:19:01] that has so easily beset you and you're
[1:19:03] running the race which you've been
[1:19:04] called to to run because the morning has
[1:19:07] arisen upon thee and you're new.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; You're new.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; If if if an old devil's trying to hold
[1:19:14] on to you from yesterday or last year, I
[1:19:16] think it's convenient. Hey, we're at
[1:19:17] January. This is a new year service.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; If some old devil's trying to hold on to
[1:19:22] you from 2025, it's time to lay it down.
[1:19:25] And your mercies have been made new
[1:19:27] today. And you may have made a mistake
[1:19:28] there, but this is a new day. You might
[1:19:31] have fallen into darkness at one time in
[1:19:33] Leodysia, but this is a new day. The sun
[1:19:36] is shining again. The sun is up, friend.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; The sun has risen upon us. It's a new
[1:19:43] day. Not looking back to yesterday, but
[1:19:45] it's a new day. In message shalom, I'm
[1:19:47] going to say the church, that's the
[1:19:48] reason I say shalom to them is because
[1:19:50] it's God's peace. My when a vindicated
[1:19:53] word prophet would say that to me, God's
[1:19:56] peace, it drives away every worry and
[1:19:59] every fear. And that's what I want to
[1:20:01] bring you to this new year is not
[1:20:02] looking back, but we're looking forward
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; to the breaking of a new day until there
[1:20:08] is something great laying ahead of us
[1:20:09] where the year has been the joy that
[1:20:11] we've looked forward to the pressing
[1:20:13] coming of the great light and now we can
[1:20:15] see it breaking over the horizontal
[1:20:17] realm. It's breaking between mortality
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and immortality. I don't know if
[1:20:23] you know where you're standing yet in
[1:20:24] the ages, but it's a pretty important
[1:20:26] place. Breaking between mortality and
[1:20:28] immortality. We see it breaking between
[1:20:31] heavens and earth and an earthbound
[1:20:33] sickness in a troubled world into a
[1:20:35] bright shining day of an immortal life
[1:20:38] and an immortal body and an immortal
[1:20:40] earth that shall never pass away. It's
[1:20:43] shalom to the church.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Now it's light time. I don't know what
[1:20:48] time it is for the Leodysans, but in
[1:20:50] here it's light time. This is light
[1:20:53] time, friend. It's recognizing time.
[1:20:55] It's light time. It's time to look up
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; from where your help cometh from.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Look up.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; It's light time. This is the light age.
[1:21:06] You can call whatever you want. The
[1:21:07] bride age, the eagle age, the overcoming
[1:21:09] age. You know, you could there's Brother
[1:21:11] Bannon plainly lays it out for us.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; We're not in Leodysia. Nor are we in a
[1:21:16] Pentecostal age. We have moved on into
[1:21:19] the word age where the word is the light
[1:21:22] among men. We're not looking for a
[1:21:24] natural electricity light. We're looking
[1:21:26] at a supernatural vindicated light that
[1:21:28] has been there since before the
[1:21:30] foundation of the world. Thy light has
[1:21:32] come in this age.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; No longer are we children of darkness,
[1:21:37] but we've been made children of the
[1:21:39] light. All things new. Psalms 34 would
[1:21:42] say this. Oh, magnify the Lord with me
[1:21:44] and let us exalt his name together. I
[1:21:47] sought the Lord and he heard me and
[1:21:49] delivered me from all my fears.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; That means he answers when you call.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; They looked unto him and they were
[1:21:58] lightened
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; and their faces were not ashamed.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. This poor man, somebody say
[1:22:06] this poor man cried. And the Lord heard
[1:22:09] him and saved him out of all his
[1:22:13] troubles. The angel of the Lord
[1:22:15] encampeth round about them that fear him
[1:22:18] and deliverth him. Taste and see that
[1:22:20] the Lord is good. Blessed is the man
[1:22:23] that trusts in him. Oh, fear the Lord,
[1:22:25] ye saints, for there is no want or lack
[1:22:28] to them that trust in him or fear him.
[1:22:32] There is no lack in us, brother Ben. We
[1:22:34] don't have to go out to TD Jake. We
[1:22:37] don't got to go out back to Charles
[1:22:38] Stanley. We don't got to go back to
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I don't have to pull from an old Oral
[1:22:43] Roberts sermon. I don't have to pull
[1:22:45] from from this from this internet
[1:22:47] phenomena or this internet phenomena. I
[1:22:50] have a vindicated word in this age. I'm
[1:22:52] not looking for another, but my light
[1:22:55] has come. Hallelujah. Blessed are your
[1:22:58] eyes that have seen and beheld his
[1:23:01] glory.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tasted and see.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Two phases to that scripture. Tasting
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; and seeing
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; in that in that word see there. If you
[1:23:13] go back to the to the the old uh uh uh
[1:23:15] Hebrew of it, it means appearance.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; The ability to see, to perceive, or to
[1:23:22] have a vision. Remember in John 4, I
[1:23:25] perceive
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; that thou art a prophet.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Same word, right?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Taste and see. I perceive
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; that thou art a prophet.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Right? She had the faith to see he was a
[1:23:36] prophet. But when he then he began to
[1:23:38] tell her all of the secrets of her life,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; she said, "Now I know.
[1:23:44] Now I know that thou art the Messiah,"
[1:23:47] which we prayed for. She didn't say, "Is
[1:23:49] it you?
[1:23:51] Are you the Messiah that I've been
[1:23:52] praying for? We've been instructed since
[1:23:54] we were babes that there would be a
[1:23:56] Messiah come and we worship at this
[1:23:58] mountain. Is it you or do we look for
[1:24:00] another?
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; No, she was convinced.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; She was convinced and then concerned and
[1:24:05] then she carried out the work which the
[1:24:07] Lord had for her. She recognized
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; she was in the fellowship with somebody
[1:24:11] other than just a man. Yeah,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; it wasn't just a man, brother carrying a
[1:24:15] robe,
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; but she had come in contact
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; with something that knew every secret
[1:24:22] about her.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That knew every every secret thing,
[1:24:27] every thought that she had within her, a
[1:24:30] every element that she was holding
[1:24:32] within her. That being knew
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; everything about her.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a man.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Something had appeared unto her. She
[1:24:43] knew
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; this is the Messiah. This is the one
[1:24:48] that I've been waiting for. The age of
[1:24:50] confusion was over for her.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Babylon the Great had fallen for her.
[1:24:55] Once your eyes get fixed on the
[1:24:57] vindicated truth, confusion is over for
[1:25:00] you. I don't know how to tell you this
[1:25:01] any planer, friend. Once you get your
[1:25:03] eyes on the vindicated truth, sickness
[1:25:05] is over for you. Depression is over for
[1:25:08] you. Anxiety is over for you. All fear
[1:25:11] is over for you because your eyes are
[1:25:13] not fixed on a man or a man's idea or a
[1:25:16] church or a theology, but your eyes have
[1:25:18] been fixed on the Messiah that you have
[1:25:21] been waiting for. We have longed to see
[1:25:23] this day. We have rejoiced to see this
[1:25:25] day. Don't tell me to be quiet when I
[1:25:28] recognize the coming of the Messiah in
[1:25:31] this age. It does something to me that
[1:25:34] the world cannot do.
[1:25:36] You
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; say, "Well, brother,
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; you just need to get more revelated."
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; No, my light has come.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord has been seen upon
[1:25:47] me.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:50] I feel like if there's a spirit in the
[1:25:52] age today that would try to stomp out
[1:25:53] the worship of the believer recognizing
[1:25:55] their Messiah, I would say it's a false
[1:25:57] Christ.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It's a false anointed one in this age
[1:26:01] because God never told you to calm down
[1:26:03] your praise and calm down your worship.
[1:26:05] Isaac quoted it last night. We've seen
[1:26:07] joy spells and jumping spells, but they
[1:26:09] were because they recognized
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; their name on the Lamb's Book of Life.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; You know, that tells me it's a full
[1:26:17] access pass when you recognize your name
[1:26:19] is on the Lamb's Book of Life.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You won't do anything out of order.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Simple.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I don't think I I don't think it's a
[1:26:31] it's a it's an issue of
[1:26:35] Maybe, maybe, maybe I just was hearing
[1:26:38] the prophet today saying, "Maybe that
[1:26:39] brother just misunderstood me."
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's what it was.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Like how Isaac brought that out last
[1:26:44] night. It's not the brother. It's an
[1:26:45] unclean spirit.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; It was never that brother. That brother
[1:26:48] is a a son of God.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; But it's an unclean spirit that anointed
[1:26:52] him.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; So you got to recognize it's not a
[1:26:55] brother that's against you. It's a
[1:26:57] spirit that's against the move of God in
[1:26:59] this age. And I would say that if if
[1:27:02] somebody that's suffering with that
[1:27:03] spirit of leodyian trample on worship
[1:27:07] would get more enlightened and more
[1:27:09] revelated, they would recognize that the
[1:27:11] seals release true worship in this age
[1:27:13] of spirit and truth.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Just shine the light on it. It's not
[1:27:17] it's not it's not mysterious anymore.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Remember the man would talk about those
[1:27:20] uh mysterious mountains in Arizona?
[1:27:22] Superstitious, right?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of superstitions around
[1:27:26] the move of God,
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; And and Satan would love to hijack the
[1:27:31] move of God and create false things and
[1:27:33] create false directions so that our to
[1:27:35] take our focus off of it. And what's he
[1:27:36] doing? He's trying to get us to go from
[1:27:38] one ditch to another ditch. But if our
[1:27:40] eyes remain focused on him, then we're
[1:27:42] not going to the left or right depending
[1:27:44] on who does this or who does that. Two
[1:27:46] or a tabernacle is not governed by any
[1:27:49] other person than the Holy Ghost
[1:27:50] himself. We are not basing on what this
[1:27:52] internet guy said or this internet guy
[1:27:55] said. This church is a word church and
[1:27:57] we are looking at the word and we will
[1:27:59] not take our eyes. This is what we
[1:28:02] waited for. This is a word revival. This
[1:28:05] is what a word revival looks like.
[1:28:08] Sometimes we dance. Sometimes we cry.
[1:28:11] Sometimes we shout. But we are in a word
[1:28:13] revival.
[1:28:15] This is what it looks like. Friends,
[1:28:17] don't wait for something else. The devil
[1:28:20] putting a carrot stick in front of you.
[1:28:22] But it's a false light.
[1:28:26] This is the bride's revival. This is why
[1:28:29] he came in this age. So that you could
[1:28:31] have joy.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; The confusion's over, friend.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; We've tasted and we're seeing the
[1:28:44] goodness of God. Psalms 119, how sweet
[1:28:47] are thy words unto my taste. Hallelujah.
[1:28:51] Yay, they're sweeter than honey to my
[1:28:54] mouth. Though my precepts I I I I get
[1:28:57] understanding.
[1:28:59] Therefore, I hate every false way.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Thank God for understanding in this age.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And I hate every false way. Thy word is
[1:29:12] a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:29:16] path. Thy word has illuminated my
[1:29:19] footsteps to walk on into victory. We
[1:29:21] can't make it without the word. Friend,
[1:29:23] if you're trying to walk this walk
[1:29:24] without the word, you'll be left in
[1:29:26] utter darkness. But we've been given a
[1:29:28] light in this age, a commission in this
[1:29:30] hour that we have a light to walk under.
[1:29:33] Hallelujah. I could go back to the Old
[1:29:35] Testament, show you that pillar of fire,
[1:29:36] but they might get moved, right? And
[1:29:38] they would try to put down a camp,
[1:29:40] right? That's why you never build your
[1:29:42] revival on a man. You never build your
[1:29:44] revival on an idea or a church or a
[1:29:48] building or you build your revival on
[1:29:50] the word because even though that man
[1:29:52] might be anointed for that time, if he
[1:29:54] does not choose to go on with the pillar
[1:29:56] of fire, he will get left behind and
[1:29:59] everybody under his ministry will get
[1:30:00] left behind. But thank God that there's
[1:30:03] true leadership in this age that will
[1:30:05] walk in the light as we are children of
[1:30:08] the light. Don't get caught in the glare
[1:30:10] of a former age, but walk on with God.
[1:30:13] Just sail on. Just sail on anyway. No
[1:30:16] matter what it looks like, just sail on.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I know this maybe be a little little
[1:30:22] deep. I usually try to take like more of
[1:30:23] a you thought, but this is what's on my
[1:30:25] heart.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Sail on into the word of God.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You know, if you don't eat, you're going
[1:30:32] to get left behind.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Take the book and eat the book.
[1:30:37] You've got to eat the book. You've got
[1:30:39] to taste it and then you see. You can't
[1:30:43] see until you taste the book. You've got
[1:30:45] to take the book, eat it, and become the
[1:30:47] book. And then you'll see the glory of
[1:30:49] God upon thee. Then you'll see a vision.
[1:30:51] We're not looking for a brother Brandham
[1:30:53] type vision. This vision of the word is
[1:30:55] the bride's vision. This is the array
[1:30:58] that he set before the church. This is
[1:31:00] what a perfect word bride looks like.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That's the vision that we're seeing.
[1:31:04] Without a vision, the people will
[1:31:06] perish.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; So, we need a vision. So, we've got to
[1:31:09] be in the word. We've got to be eating
[1:31:11] the book. We've got to be partaking of
[1:31:13] the glory of God to see the vision.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Little scriptural background for you.
[1:31:18] 1st Samuel 14. And the men of Israel
[1:31:20] under a man leadership were distressed
[1:31:22] that day. For Saul had adjured the
[1:31:23] people, saying, "Cursed be the man that
[1:31:25] eateth any food."
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Great kind of leader. Brother Ray
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; would tell his his people, "Don't eat
[1:31:33] any food."
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Cursed is the man that eateth any food.
[1:31:38] Don't be studying those tapes.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, you stay away from that book. You
[1:31:44] know, that was pre63. You know,
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; what kind of leader
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; would try to keep you from the good
[1:31:51] fruit of God?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; It's a scarecrow.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It's a scarecrow in front of the good
[1:31:58] crops. Any anointing that tells you that
[1:32:01] quote is not suitable for a believer is
[1:32:03] a false anointing.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Your brother said the best way to get
[1:32:08] rid of a scarecrow
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; is you light a match. You know what? A
[1:32:12] scarecrow is afraid of fire. The best
[1:32:15] way to get rid of a scarecrow standing
[1:32:16] in your way is to light it on fire. It
[1:32:19] cannot stand the heat of true word in
[1:32:22] this hour. It cannot stand the heat of a
[1:32:24] pure gospel light in this hour. I say
[1:32:26] turn up the heat. Let's get rid of the
[1:32:28] scarecrows. We are believers believing
[1:32:31] the end time message,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; friend. I can't tell you. You're not
[1:32:36] going to get out of order. You're a
[1:32:38] believer.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; If you withhold your praise, then the
[1:32:43] rocks will cry out.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Richard, there's no rock that
[1:32:47] can take your place
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; because I've been commissioned and sent
[1:32:52] here to be a worshipper in this hour.
[1:32:57] Any
[1:32:59] anointing that would try to take the
[1:33:00] worship away from God is a false
[1:33:02] anointing.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That was free. Cursed
[1:33:10] be the man that eateth any food until
[1:33:11] evening that I may be avenged of my
[1:33:13] enemies. You see how selfish
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; uninspired leadership can be.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; So none of the people tasted any food.
[1:33:21] My what a sad situation.
[1:33:24] And all are they the land came to wood,
[1:33:26] and there was honey upon the ground. And
[1:33:28] when the people were coming to the wood,
[1:33:29] behold, the honey dropped. But no man
[1:33:32] put his hand to his mouth. For the
[1:33:35] people feared the oath. But Jonathan
[1:33:38] heard not when his father charged the
[1:33:40] people with the oath. Wherefore he put
[1:33:42] forth to the end the rod that was in his
[1:33:44] hand, and dipped it in a honeycomb, and
[1:33:47] put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes
[1:33:51] were enlightened.
[1:33:58] That's why the devil don't want you to
[1:33:59] get in the message of the hour cuz he
[1:34:01] doesn't want your eyes lightened to the
[1:34:03] glory of God that is coming this day.
[1:34:05] Oh, stay away from that. You'll get in
[1:34:07] the ditch. Stay away from that. You'll
[1:34:08] get in the ditch. Stay away from bright
[1:34:10] age. You'll dry up. Stay away from
[1:34:12] Pentecost. You'll get crazy. There's a
[1:34:15] middle of the road, friend. Keep your
[1:34:17] eyes on the message of the hour. Taste
[1:34:21] and see that this word is true. This is
[1:34:25] the vindicated word of the hour. This is
[1:34:28] mana for the believer. Any anointing
[1:34:32] that would try to take that away from
[1:34:33] you is a false anointing.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I'll say this. From 47 to 65 is bride
[1:34:43] food.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. The problem is is men have
[1:34:48] denominated on one sentence
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; and not continued on with the light of
[1:34:52] the pillar of fire. And so therefore
[1:34:54] they failed to go on with pressing
[1:34:56] revelation.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Go back and read shalom when you get
[1:35:01] time. This is not a a darkness winning
[1:35:05] battle.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; But can I say this? Darkness is not
[1:35:08] controlling this battle.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God makes it very
[1:35:11] clear. The light is pressing it. The
[1:35:15] light is pressing the darkness. So the
[1:35:17] darkness has no control in this hour,
[1:35:20] but the light is in control. Ye are the
[1:35:22] light of the world, friends. Ye are the
[1:35:25] children of the light. You're pressing
[1:35:26] against the darkness. You may not feel
[1:35:28] like it. You may not always sound like
[1:35:30] it, but you are pressing against the
[1:35:32] darkness in this age.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; This is that this is that time. Isaac
[1:35:36] was right there last night. This is that
[1:35:38] transition time.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. This is a transition from
[1:35:42] an evening time message to the sun is
[1:35:45] up.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know where you're
[1:35:49] standing, friend, but I
[1:35:52] wish that same anointing, brother
[1:35:53] Jonathan, that revealed it to me would
[1:35:55] come down.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; That same anointing that just confirmed
[1:35:59] it to me just a few hours ago would come
[1:36:01] down again and reveal it to hearts that
[1:36:03] are that are needing and wanting and and
[1:36:06] seeking revelation and seeking God. This
[1:36:08] is the bright time. This is the hour of
[1:36:11] the manifestation of the word in the
[1:36:14] church. But the church has received a
[1:36:17] heavenly sign, an astronaut. Amen. Jesus
[1:36:20] Christ in the form of the pillar of
[1:36:22] fire. He was in the Old Testament and
[1:36:24] that he was when he met Saul down there
[1:36:26] on the road to Damascus. The same Jesus
[1:36:29] here today. And what does it do? Does it
[1:36:31] bring fear? No. It brings love.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How's the third pull
[1:36:39] activated?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; It brings
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; love,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; a uniting of one another. Amen. A
[1:36:45] feeling for one another.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It brings the love of God or uniting us
[1:36:49] and brings us to the body of Christ into
[1:36:52] the unity as a bride. That's what it's
[1:36:54] doing now. The great union.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; They're they're uniting themselves. One
[1:37:00] group here over here to fight with
[1:37:01] another one.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you friends, but I'm
[1:37:05] not interested in fighting with another
[1:37:06] group.
[1:37:09] I'm interested in progressing with the
[1:37:10] word.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; I've lost some good friends along life's
[1:37:16] way,
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; but I progressed with the word. I've
[1:37:18] lost ministering brother that we were at
[1:37:20] a meeting one time and a brother that I
[1:37:22] was a good friend of mine, brother
[1:37:24] Gideon, he came to me in the middle of
[1:37:25] that meeting and said, "This message
[1:37:26] isn't the truth."
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And we were preaching a meeting overseas
[1:37:29] together.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother, it was nice knowing you.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you. I'll pray for you, but
[1:37:36] I can't fellowship where you're going.
[1:37:39] I've got my eyes fixed on something
[1:37:41] else. Something has been revealed to me
[1:37:43] that I can't fellowship with you in
[1:37:45] darkness because I have been made a
[1:37:47] child of the light in this age. Now, you
[1:37:50] might lose some good friends. You might
[1:37:51] lose some family. But wait till we get
[1:37:52] to the end of this and find out. But the
[1:37:54] church, the bride is united by one God
[1:37:57] under one spirit. The spirit of God in
[1:37:59] the holy union of God to be one holy
[1:38:02] bride to God all together. Unity of the
[1:38:06] body. The body waiting as the bride. We
[1:38:08] call ourselves the bride for the uniting
[1:38:10] time. The church is so coming together.
[1:38:13] Oh, can you feel it?
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Can you feel the pulsation of the saints
[1:38:18] of God coming together for something
[1:38:21] great? Something they're anticipating.
[1:38:23] It's it's coming together getting under
[1:38:25] the word
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; the church is coming together should
[1:38:28] create just a love.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; among us
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; that we could hardly be away from one
[1:38:33] another
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; when you just you don't have to beg the
[1:38:37] people to pray.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to beg them to worship
[1:38:40] God. You don't have to beg them to do
[1:38:42] what's right. They're just so in love
[1:38:44] with him. Hallelujah. This is not a
[1:38:48] workup or a force. You're just so in
[1:38:50] love with him that there's nothing you'd
[1:38:53] rather do than to fellowship in his
[1:38:55] courts, than to fellowship in his
[1:38:58] presence, than to fellowship with
[1:38:59] another believer, than to fellowship
[1:39:02] around the throne. Hallelujah.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; There's nothing I'd rather do.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else. Hallelujah. 2
[1:39:11] Corinthians 4, God who commanded the
[1:39:14] light to shine out of darkness. You know
[1:39:16] it's a commandment for you to Micaiah to
[1:39:18] stand out
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; oddballs has shined in our hearts to
[1:39:22] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:39:24] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:39:26] Christ. But we have this treasure in
[1:39:27] earth and vessels that the excellency of
[1:39:30] the power may be of God and not of us.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, brother Aaron, God has a
[1:39:38] sense of humor. I you know sometimes I
[1:39:40] look at my faults and my failures and my
[1:39:42] mistakes and my inabilities and it's so
[1:39:44] the glory can't be put on me.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Ray, it's so the glory can't be
[1:39:51] put on a man
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; but that the glory might be of his
[1:39:54] excellency.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; I never did trust a slicker that looks
[1:39:59] like he's perfect because the glory goes
[1:40:01] to him. But God has made you a misfit, a
[1:40:04] reject, an outcast of society, someone
[1:40:07] who never fit in. never never got in
[1:40:10] until you came to the place where you
[1:40:12] were called. And that is because no
[1:40:14] glory can go to a man.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; All glory goes to God.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Why do you think he made the prophet the
[1:40:22] way he did with all his complexes and
[1:40:24] everybody hated Brandhams and nobody
[1:40:25] liked me and I never had friends. What a
[1:40:27] sorrowful life. But he had to go through
[1:40:29] it
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; so that no glory, he knew how unable he
[1:40:33] was.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; He knew his inabilities so no glory
[1:40:37] would come to him. It must go to God.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; All glory, power, and honor will go to
[1:40:44] God. We have this treasure in earth and
[1:40:46] vessels. We are troubled on every side,
[1:40:49] yet we're not distressed.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; We're perplexed,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; but we're not in despair,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; persecuted,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; but we're not forsaken.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Cast down, but not destroyed. always
[1:41:03] bearing about in the body of the dying
[1:41:05] of the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[1:41:07] Jesus might be made manifest in your
[1:41:10] body.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I like preaching to a preaching church.
[1:41:16] Lord God, I'm asking the bride tonight,
[1:41:18] the ones I feel that is pulled away and
[1:41:20] waiting, may they separate themselves
[1:41:23] from everything in the world, they must
[1:41:25] lay in the presence of the warm sunlight
[1:41:27] of the son of God, bathing in his word,
[1:41:30] in his love. It's a vision of his
[1:41:33] appearing.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Without a vision, the people perish.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; But this message came to give us a
[1:41:40] vision
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; of his appearing
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; in this age. He says, "Don't you take
[1:41:46] nobody else's word for it.
[1:41:48] I don't need You don't need me, Ben, to
[1:41:52] break down this message to you. This
[1:41:54] message will speak for itself."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; You don't need a man
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; to break down this word to you. This
[1:42:01] word speaks for itself. This word has a
[1:42:05] voice. This word has a voice in this
[1:42:07] age. And he may use a man. He may be
[1:42:09] using a man tonight, but you don't need
[1:42:11] man for this word to come. God has a
[1:42:13] voice.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Let me clear this up. It's not a
[1:42:19] mechanical device.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It's not a mechanical device that
[1:42:25] controls the voice. The pillar of fire
[1:42:26] controls the voice. The fire has a voice
[1:42:29] in this age. If you just if you just get
[1:42:32] under it long enough, you'll be
[1:42:33] surprised what might come out of your
[1:42:35] mouth when that fire gets over you and
[1:42:37] you abide in the presence of the son of
[1:42:39] man light and you abide under the shadow
[1:42:41] of the almighty. You might be surprised
[1:42:43] what your voice is used for. Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah. You know that voice sings,
[1:42:48] the pillar of fire sings. I watch a
[1:42:50] service after service here and I'll have
[1:42:52] a song or I I'll be picking up anointing
[1:42:55] in the preaching and brother Ben will
[1:42:56] get under that pillar of fire and that
[1:42:58] anointing will drop on him and he'll
[1:43:00] pick up right off where the preacher
[1:43:01] left off. And the same anointing, the
[1:43:03] pillar of fire also sings.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire has a voice. It will
[1:43:10] speak for itself.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Doesn't need me, but I'm glad to be a
[1:43:16] part of it. I'm glad to be under the
[1:43:18] shadow of the Almighty.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a voice and I want my
[1:43:22] voice to go along with this pillar of
[1:43:24] fire. He is the word. That's right. He's
[1:43:28] the word to identify his own self.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He'll identify him.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Not some man saying this is what it is
[1:43:36] or this is what it is or this is what it
[1:43:37] is. He came under no private
[1:43:40] interpretation. He came to you.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; You're not smart enough. Right.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much education you've
[1:43:52] had,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; how much doctorate you have,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; you're not smart enough to understand
[1:43:58] the wisdom of God. That's why he had to
[1:44:01] come down to a Kentucky hillbilly who
[1:44:03] knew I'm not smart enough to figure this
[1:44:05] out. So it took God to come and anoint
[1:44:08] some broken vessel that he could use him
[1:44:10] like he's used no other man before to
[1:44:12] speak the words of God in this age that
[1:44:15] we might have life and have it abundant.
[1:44:17] Hallelujah. This message is our
[1:44:20] identification.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; My face is not ashamed of the message of
[1:44:26] the hour. I've been identified with it.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; We know what the message came here for.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Remember the short version of this
[1:44:33] sermon. Yes.
[1:44:37] This is it.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; This is that.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; This is what was prophesied.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; This is it. It's been thoroughly
[1:44:47] identified to us through all of the ages
[1:44:50] of coming prophecy. This message has
[1:44:53] fulfilled every period,
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; every line, every jot, every tit,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; and it's come down to your home.
[1:45:02] That's right.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; I think brother Kyle did it on New
[1:45:06] Year's. You say that we know what the
[1:45:07] third pole is. We know what the third
[1:45:09] pole is.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for somebody to come.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Some great revelator.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; I got news for Can I preach a little
[1:45:20] bit?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; The thunders have already thundered.
[1:45:24] We're not waiting for another thunder to
[1:45:26] come and reveal and break it down to us
[1:45:29] that we have to come worship at some
[1:45:30] man's feet that he might bring unto us
[1:45:32] the bread of life. But this thunder has
[1:45:34] already sounded in this age that we can
[1:45:37] have freedom and liberty.
[1:45:40] You've got the message in your hand,
[1:45:42] friend. You've got authority in your
[1:45:44] head. You don't need a thunder to come.
[1:45:47] The thunder is already sounded in this
[1:45:49] age. The thunder is already rang. It's
[1:45:52] the voice of God.
[1:45:54] And it's revealed the mysteries unto
[1:45:56] you. You're not waiting for something.
[1:45:58] The light has come.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a mystery anymore.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Shalom, friend.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Thy light has come.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; This is the perfected word in this hour.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; It's come. We know what the third pole
[1:46:17] is. We all understand that. We You You
[1:46:20] have the tape. He says,
[1:46:23] Come on.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "I think it'll just lay dormant
[1:46:26] for a while,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; brother Mike."
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; They're for about a 50 60 year span,
[1:46:32] maybe.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; That third pole
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; will lay dormant for a while.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; But at the appointed time,
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; that vision will speak for itself.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; That third pull power will speak once
[1:46:44] again. And it'll have a voice because
[1:46:46] they'll be so surrendered to the word of
[1:46:48] God that they will be the final voice in
[1:46:52] the final age. The third pull is
[1:46:54] speaking again. Brother Ray, he's riding
[1:46:56] this trail again. This is the third pull
[1:46:59] manifestation of the sons of God. This
[1:47:02] is the authority. This is the fullness
[1:47:05] of sons. This is if you say to this
[1:47:08] mountain, that is this age that we are
[1:47:11] in.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Man, I got news. It's not coming. It's
[1:47:14] arrived.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; It's not a far out somewhere. It's here.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; He comes where he's invited and he's
[1:47:23] here.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, if I was in a cabin back in
[1:47:30] Kentucky, like had he ride and the
[1:47:31] prophet came to me, the authority that
[1:47:33] was in that cabin is here."
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that the anointing
[1:47:40] in that room was greater than it was at
[1:47:42] the dawn of creation.
[1:47:45] What a light.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; What a light, brother Aiden. Not just a
[1:47:49] light switch flicking on, but that light
[1:47:51] was greater than the one at the
[1:47:52] beginning of creation. And it has come
[1:47:54] down into this age
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; unto these people.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I just listened to the prophet today
[1:48:07] talk about that scene.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Just thinking about it. Yeah,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; brother Aaron, when your haddy riot
[1:48:15] moment comes,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; what are you going to ask for?
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; What's important?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm speaking to Hattie rights.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the truth. Your hadyright
[1:48:40] moment has come.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; What will you speak?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; What's really important?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham said she thought
[1:48:53] for a minute, well, what would I ask
[1:48:54] for?
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; What would I ask for, brother Jonathan?
[1:48:56] What would I ask for?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; And a revelation struck her.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; What's the thing that your soul has
[1:49:04] longed for? What's the thing that you
[1:49:06] have been travailing for and crying out
[1:49:08] for? What's the thing that you hunger
[1:49:11] for more than anything else? What is
[1:49:13] that to you, Hattie? Write what is the
[1:49:15] thing that motivates your prayer life?
[1:49:17] What is the thing that motivates your
[1:49:19] worship unto him?
[1:49:23] This message wasn't just one had right
[1:49:25] opportunity and done.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; But it's always if he did it for her,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; brother Robson, if he did it for her,
[1:49:34] then he's obligated by his word to do it
[1:49:37] for me and for you and for you and to
[1:49:40] all them. Hallelujah. This is the
[1:49:42] promise of the end time believer. If you
[1:49:46] say
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; no other age has had this commission
[1:49:49] until this time under this age under
[1:49:52] this ministry.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[1:49:57] glory
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; that's when it will be
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; it'll speak.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; It'll be manifested just like the five
[1:50:05] straight signs without failure
[1:50:07] perfectly. And now just wait to see what
[1:50:09] it done.
[1:50:12] It'll speak. Yes. Amen.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Habacook says, "And the Lord answered to
[1:50:16] me and said, write the vision
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; and make it plain upon the tablets that
[1:50:21] he may run that readeth it. For the
[1:50:23] vision is yet for an appointed time."
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; You're there.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; You've arrived.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; But at the end, what time are we in?
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; The end.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; It shall speak
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; and it shall not lie.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Though it tar, wait for it.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Because it will surely come.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; What would I ask for?
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Well, this takes a great understanding.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; We ask not because we have not.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; And we have not because we ask not.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And we ask not because we believe not.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And why don't we believe? Because we
[1:51:03] don't understand.
[1:51:09] It's not any harder for God
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; to heal cancer.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take any more power from God.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; To heal cancer.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Than it does for for for you to have a
[1:51:23] successful walk out to the car tonight.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; God's power is infinite.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; So therefore, you cannot take from it.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:34] It's ever growing.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; It's It's ever going on. So, it doesn't
[1:51:38] take It's not going to take any more
[1:51:39] power. Sister Ella, when when you were
[1:51:41] filled with the Holy Ghost, it didn't
[1:51:43] take any more power out of God.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; He's still all powerful.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And the same God that filled you once
[1:51:50] will refill you again. And the same God
[1:51:52] that gave you healing once will heal you
[1:51:54] again. But that same power isn't just
[1:51:56] for healing of a temporary body. That
[1:51:59] power is for an understanding of a
[1:52:01] heavenly realm where you will not cease.
[1:52:03] You will have no end. Oh, this body.
[1:52:05] That's why Hatty Wright couldn't ask for
[1:52:07] her sister or her mom or her dad cuz
[1:52:10] they would eventually die. But she knew
[1:52:12] a greater revelation of understanding
[1:52:14] was that the soul liveth on. The soul
[1:52:17] has no end. The soul that trusts in God
[1:52:20] shall never perish.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:28] Hallelujah. Now I want to try I believe
[1:52:30] the Lord has somehow this is a quote at
[1:52:32] a prisoner has given me a little insight
[1:52:33] on the reasons why there is some people
[1:52:35] that are not healed. I think the prophet
[1:52:37] would know something about that sir
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; and I believe it's a lack of
[1:52:42] understanding
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; and I believe we'll maybe speak on that
[1:52:46] on Sunday morning. He says, "So, uh, you
[1:52:50] know, me being me, I skipped ahead
[1:52:57] to what he would speak on that. It's a
[1:53:00] day of confusion
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; where the devil has taken the people
[1:53:03] into a state of confusion where they
[1:53:06] don't understand that God's healing is
[1:53:08] for you.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; When you get the revelation of who of of
[1:53:11] who he is, then you get the revelation
[1:53:13] of who you are. And when you get the
[1:53:15] revelation that he's a healer,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; We don't lack understanding, friends. We
[1:53:24] have the message of the hour
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; if we're in it.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; If we would only know what day we are
[1:53:30] living in. There wouldn't be so much
[1:53:32] confusion about this message and about
[1:53:34] the scriptures that we're trying to
[1:53:35] bring to the people. If the people only
[1:53:37] understood that we're at the end time.
[1:53:40] And when that when that light hit that
[1:53:41] little woman in that shape, a a red
[1:53:44] light woman, if that word that
[1:53:45] identified she had read the scripture
[1:53:47] and she knowed what the word said and
[1:53:49] then she seen that word manifested
[1:53:51] quickly, she recognized it to be the
[1:53:54] Messiah.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; If she could do that under them
[1:53:58] conditions,
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to show hands, man. Any of
[1:54:01] you married to to six people right now?
[1:54:05] If she could do that under them
[1:54:06] conditions, what ought we to do tonight
[1:54:09] if we could see him do the same thing? A
[1:54:12] bornagain church filled with the Holy
[1:54:14] Ghost looking for his coming. It ought
[1:54:17] to empty every wheelchair through here.
[1:54:19] Every sinner ought to fall out around
[1:54:20] the altar. It proves he lives.
[1:54:23] Hallelujah. If she can do that for for
[1:54:26] her,
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; then what would this message do for
[1:54:28] sanctified lives that are know we're
[1:54:30] trying our hardest to live this word?
[1:54:32] What would it do for us?
[1:54:37] The same God that spoke to the woman at
[1:54:40] the well. It's the same God in this
[1:54:42] message today is the same God in
[1:54:44] authority that comes out from this
[1:54:46] pulpit today. The same God.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see a man who's told me
[1:54:57] the things.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; This must be the Messiah. Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With the eyes of God's
[1:55:05] fellowship with the Lord today and it
[1:55:07] hit me so real.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne, it just opened to me.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; This message,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; It is Messiah.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; This message is the Messiah.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another one to
[1:55:19] come.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; This is Messiah.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Come see the one who told me. Come see
[1:55:25] the one.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; This is the Messiah. I'm not waiting for
[1:55:29] another one to come. This Messiah has
[1:55:32] come and he's revealed the secret of my
[1:55:35] heart. He's revealed the secret of my
[1:55:37] mind. This is the Messiah message.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; This is the Messiah. Is this it? Or do
[1:55:45] we look for another? No, friend. This is
[1:55:47] the promised Messiah of this age. The
[1:55:50] creator of heavens and earth, the prince
[1:55:52] of peace, the mighty God, king of kings.
[1:55:58] Hallelujah.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil put it out for you
[1:56:00] somewhere.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, one day.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; One day.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't miss the rapture,
[1:56:09] Ella.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; You can't miss it,
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; cuz it's happening now.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; This bride's revival is the rapture of
[1:56:17] the church.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; This is we're stepping into another
[1:56:20] reality.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; We're stepping into another dimension.
[1:56:24] This rapture is not the the finished
[1:56:26] work of the rapture is the changing of
[1:56:27] our body. But the changing of our spirit
[1:56:30] is happening right now. The changing of
[1:56:32] the dominion of what we're under is
[1:56:34] happening right now. We're not waiting
[1:56:36] for it to come.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; It's already come.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; You're not missing it. Get in it. You're
[1:56:42] not going to miss the rapture. Step into
[1:56:44] the rapture and get on board. This is
[1:56:48] the prize move in this hour. You can't
[1:56:50] miss it, friend. It came for you and it
[1:56:53] called your name.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; How many knows that the message can
[1:56:56] speak your name directly?
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Can it not speak your name directly
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; and call you out of the middle of your
[1:57:04] situation?
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Did it not happen last night, Zion?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; This message will call your name.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; This message will call you out of your
[1:57:14] situation. Is that right, Sister Tara?
[1:57:17] It'll call you right out of confusion
[1:57:19] into a perfect light. Amen.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; This message will call your name. It has
[1:57:25] a voice.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; It might be used in Isaac or Wayne or
[1:57:28] Ray or whoever, but it has a voice.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; And any surrendered vessel,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; the only gift that I possess
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; is a gift to get out of the way
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; and let his voice
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; the creator of heaven and earth.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, how do you
[1:57:50] do that? That's his word. That's the
[1:57:52] word itself being made manifest. The
[1:57:54] word will make itself manifest in you if
[1:57:57] you'll believe it. Take away the clouds
[1:57:59] of doubt. The sun is shining. The sen is
[1:58:02] shining. His power is here in the room
[1:58:04] to make every one of you well.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; If you believe it.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Have you heard your name called?
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got too much here.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Have you heard your name called? Have
[1:58:20] you understood?
[1:58:23] Remember you hit that road to Emmas last
[1:58:25] night. Oh fools and slow of heart to not
[1:58:29] understand.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; But friend, the word has been broken
[1:58:33] unto us.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; The bread of life has been broken up
[1:58:38] unto us.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; And it was the way that he revealed
[1:58:42] himself to them.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:58:49] Can I be honest with you, brother Eric?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I've been a fool and slow of heart.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; No, Lord. This is too great.
[1:58:59] It's too great for me. I'm just a sinner
[1:59:02] saved by grace.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's too great for me.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; I cannot attain it. My ways are too
[1:59:09] high.
[1:59:11] Oh, fool and slow of heart.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; To not believe all that the prophets
[1:59:16] have taught. Come on.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; You know that your pride can get in the
[1:59:20] way of your victory.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; And not in the way you think.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just so good.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; No. Your pride to not accept his grace
[1:59:30] can get in the way of your victory.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; I didn't come up with this. The Lord
[1:59:35] gave it to me. Your pride can get in the
[1:59:38] way of him dealing with you because you
[1:59:40] can be a fool and slow of heart to
[1:59:42] believe all that the word has promised
[1:59:44] in this age. Is he God or is he not God?
[1:59:47] Did he come to ransom the captive or did
[1:59:49] he not? And you're in captivity maybe
[1:59:52] right now, but that's why he came. Not
[1:59:54] so you can remain in captivity or
[1:59:56] confusion that you can recognize your
[1:59:59] hour has come.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Your light has come.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let pride get in the way of a move
[2:00:04] of God in your life.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Your grace is sufficient for me. Yes,
[2:00:13] sir.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You can clean even the
[2:00:18] dirtiest sinner's heart.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You can come and heal me in
[2:00:23] the middle of my situation.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You can fill me with the Holy
[2:00:27] Ghost even now. Yes, Lord.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I renounce my pride and I say,
[2:00:35] "Have your way with me, Lord. If you
[2:00:37] want to use me, use me. If you want to
[2:00:39] fill me, fill me. If you want to heal
[2:00:41] me, heal me." just now. Lord, I
[2:00:43] surrender my pride to you.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; He resists the pride.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; He's trying to get his grace into the
[2:00:52] church and they're not allowing it.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Some legalism called formalism has
[2:00:58] defied the grace of God.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; He resists the proud.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; If God's not God enough to deal with a
[2:01:07] sinner, then I don't want to serve him.
[2:01:13] If God's not mighty enough to heal
[2:01:15] diseases they don't have names for, then
[2:01:17] I don't want to serve him.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; If God's not mighty enough to fill
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; the most confused heart with his spirit,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; but Warren, I don't want to serve him.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; I'm a witness.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; But I serve a God. serve a true God.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I serve a Messiah
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; that has come in this age
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; and he is able to take the fest sinner.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Nothing to
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; He's able to turn a cold heart on fire.
[2:01:54] Yes.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; You may think that you've gotten cold on
[2:01:59] the Lord and you're you're too far away
[2:02:01] and you think something's blocking my
[2:02:02] victory. Something's in the way.
[2:02:04] Something is hindering me from getting
[2:02:05] into the presence of God. And and and
[2:02:07] these words are powerful, but they're
[2:02:09] just not striking me. And they're just
[2:02:11] not coming to my street or my avenue.
[2:02:13] And I'm not going to be healed tonight.
[2:02:14] And I'm not going to be victorious
[2:02:16] tonight because there's something I've
[2:02:17] done in my life that's a lie from the
[2:02:19] devil.
[2:02:21] Our
[2:02:24] God is a mighty conqueror and he takes
[2:02:26] every spirit captive under his spirit.
[2:02:29] He has the authority. He has the power.
[2:02:32] He has the anointing in this hour to
[2:02:34] take every spirit subject under his.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it's called. I don't
[2:02:41] care how cold you are. I don't care how
[2:02:43] distant you are. You may not even
[2:02:45] believe in the God that I'm talking
[2:02:47] about, but he cares for you anyways.
[2:02:51] Hallelujah.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Heard the prophet say, "Oh God, create
[2:02:56] in me a care.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; You cared.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; You cared so much for me, Lord. Create
[2:03:02] in me a care to care for you like that.
[2:03:05] Create in me a care to care for your
[2:03:07] people like that. Created me a care for
[2:03:10] your word, Lord." Oh, hallelujah.
[2:03:14] Hallelujah.
[2:03:15] His His knowledge is too great for us to
[2:03:18] comprehend. How could we limit the grace
[2:03:20] of God in our lives?
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; I And that's the reason today that the
[2:03:28] churches are blind is because they won't
[2:03:30] accept revelation that's being
[2:03:32] vindicated.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; If the word says so and it's revealed,
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; then it's proven.
[2:03:44] That's the reason these Jews, the Jews
[2:03:45] today will not, you cannot talk to them
[2:03:47] about Christ because the veil is still
[2:03:49] over their face.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; They're blinded, but not for long,
[2:03:53] friend.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Messiah's back.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; The Messiah that they missed the first
[2:04:01] time
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; has come again.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; He's come again in this ministry, in
[2:04:05] this age.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; The Messiah is back. You can't talk to
[2:04:09] them about that in the church today. You
[2:04:11] can't talk to them about the full gospel
[2:04:13] and the power of God. You all know you
[2:04:15] know when you start sharing testimonies
[2:04:17] with some make believer
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; you start sharing them. Brother Donovan
[2:04:30] you start sharing about your experience.
[2:04:31] We got filled with the Holy Ghost and
[2:04:33] you know how it is. We work in
[2:04:34] construction. We had to interact with
[2:04:35] all kind of spirits. You start
[2:04:36] witnessing to them and sharing with
[2:04:37] them.
[2:04:43] He's one of those.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Guilty.
[2:04:51] I is. I'm one of them. Brother Ben kind
[2:04:54] of said it the other day. We used this
[2:04:56] saying when I was a kid, when I was on
[2:04:57] fire for the Lord. I said, "If loving
[2:04:59] the Lord is wrong, I don't want to be
[2:05:01] right." Yes, sir. Cuz I love him and I
[2:05:04] want to be right in his eyes. I want to
[2:05:06] be right in his ways.
[2:05:09] I don't care what man thinks about me.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; I'm way too far gone for that.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; So why would we dumb down to some Leo to
[2:05:16] see an idea of what we should look like
[2:05:18] and how we should act when we are the
[2:05:20] children of the light and we are walking
[2:05:22] in the light and the fullness in this
[2:05:24] age.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Because the god of this world has
[2:05:31] blinded them from the truths of God and
[2:05:35] they lean to their own understanding.
[2:05:37] There's a veil over their face. They've
[2:05:39] been blinded. But I believe I'm speaking
[2:05:41] of some Lazaruses
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; that have been resurrected from the dead
[2:05:45] that have been called back to life. And
[2:05:48] not only did he just leave you in that
[2:05:49] broken state, but he loosed you. He
[2:05:51] broke the binds off your hands. Brother
[2:05:53] Caleb, why did he loose your handshuh?
[2:05:55] Cuz he knew you'd need to wave them. Why
[2:05:58] did he loose your feet? Cuz he knew
[2:05:59] you'd need to dance. Why did he loose
[2:06:02] you from the grave clothes of
[2:06:03] depression?
[2:06:05] You
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; know, last thing he did for the raid of
[2:06:07] me, he took the veil off my face. He
[2:06:10] took that napkin off my face that I
[2:06:12] could see him as he is. That I could see
[2:06:14] the glory of the Lord.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; As Simeon said, I'll see the Lord's
[2:06:20] Christ.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; I'll see the coming of the Messiah in
[2:06:23] this age. I'm looking at him.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the Messiah coming in
[2:06:28] this age. Your Messiah. How marvelous is
[2:06:32] this thing in our eyes? This is the
[2:06:35] Lord's doing. This is the day that the
[2:06:38] Lord hath made. We will rejoice.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; You can't use that word in church.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; We will rejoice.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Hey man, you might be stuck in
[2:06:50] Pentecost, but I'm in a bride age. This
[2:06:53] is the day that the Lord has made, and I
[2:06:56] will rejoice and be glad in it. This is
[2:07:00] our day. This is our dispensation. This
[2:07:04] is our time. This is pride time. Don't
[2:07:08] be weary, friend. Don't be down. Shalom.
[2:07:12] The Messiah has returned.
[2:07:16] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[2:07:19] And it is good. It is good in his sight.
[2:07:23] It is good that they would praise the
[2:07:26] Lord.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; It is good to recognize.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:31] Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Is appearing.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; It's recognizing time, friends.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I get a little simple,
[2:07:42] brother?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Right out of the the Strong's
[2:07:45] concordance,
[2:07:48] the teacher's favorite weapon, the
[2:07:50] strong concordance.
[2:07:52] Rejoice properly to spin around
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; under the influence of any violent
[2:08:01] emotion.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; That is usually rejoice, be glad, be
[2:08:07] joyful, at peace.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; This is the day that the Lord has made.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; I will rejoice.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know I'm scriptural when
[2:08:21] I do that. I'm just going to whack that
[2:08:24] devil run one more time.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; You would try to steal the praise and
[2:08:27] the worship out of our young people say
[2:08:29] they're fanatics or they're going off
[2:08:30] too far somewhere. This is the day.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; There has never been a day like this day
[2:08:37] to rejoice because the Messiah has
[2:08:40] returned.
[2:08:42] A Pentecostal revival doesn't even know
[2:08:44] what this is about because the son of
[2:08:47] man has come. The son of man is being
[2:08:50] revealed in the church. This is the time
[2:08:52] to rejoice and be glad in it. This is
[2:08:57] the Lord's day and it is good in my
[2:09:00] sight.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; It is good in the sight of God that men
[2:09:04] would worship the Lord.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Defy that cold old formal devil.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for revival. We're in
[2:09:15] revival.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's day.
[2:09:19] That's right.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; It's his glory,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; not your inability.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; I know the Bible says that there's
[2:09:36] specific people called for specific
[2:09:38] roles, right?
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Not everybody's a dancer.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; God knows. Don't give me a microphone to
[2:09:43] sing a special.
[2:09:47] Come on.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a role.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; But can I help our dancers out for a
[2:09:52] minute?
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; How many of you would like to just
[2:09:57] rejoice in the Lord? Spring up and just
[2:09:59] let that freedom ring, but there's some
[2:10:01] old condemnation,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; some old condemnation come down on you
[2:10:06] and say, "Oh, you you're you're in the
[2:10:08] flesh.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; You're not even a real believer." reach
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; you know he's told you that and you that
[2:10:20] and you that
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; you know what we're doing right now
[2:10:23] we're exposing him
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; cuz it takes the mystery off of it.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; It takes that mysteriousness off of it.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Well, should I be or should I not be?
[2:10:31] Well, what is the Lord telling you to
[2:10:32] do?
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hey man, I know for me, Lord comes down,
[2:10:38] I can't control it. Me and Brother Diego
[2:10:40] have been preaching some meetings
[2:10:42] together. Lord, come down. I lose my
[2:10:43] interpreter for about 15 minutes running
[2:10:45] around the building dancing. I say,
[2:10:47] "Praise the Lord.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Let the glory of the Lord fall among
[2:10:51] us."
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're not we're not robots,
[2:10:55] friends.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; We're not programmed by some by some
[2:11:00] computer chip inside of us.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; I like preaching at home.
[2:11:11] You're free.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be ashamed of how you
[2:11:17] worship.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the Lord comes and I can just
[2:11:21] do nothing but weep in his presence. I
[2:11:23] don't think about dancing. I don't think
[2:11:24] about running. I just think about
[2:11:26] weeping. Sometimes I let out a whale.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Brother asked me one time here in this
[2:11:32] assembly. He said, "Do you think it's
[2:11:33] it's odd that I let out a whale in the
[2:11:35] presence of the Lord?" I said, "No,
[2:11:36] brother. I do the same thing when the
[2:11:38] Lord comes down. When I'm in my study,
[2:11:40] if you'd have been in my room just a few
[2:11:41] hours ago, you'd have heard some
[2:11:42] whailing. You'd have heard some some
[2:11:44] some wailing and thanking God for his
[2:11:47] grace that has come in this age.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; The Messiah's amongst us.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Some pray standing. Some pray on their
[2:11:55] knees.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; You're not robots, friends. You're free
[2:11:59] to worship the Lord.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; You're free to give him glory as you
[2:12:03] feel led to give him glory.
[2:12:07] The light has come in this age.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; It's been unsealed. I've waited too long
[2:12:16] to get to my point. Just give me a few
[2:12:18] minutes. I'm not going to say five cuz I
[2:12:20] don't know.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; It's been unsealed in this age.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; So rich.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:32] That's why I don't worry, Tyler,
[2:12:34] if somebody calls me Pentecostal.
[2:12:36] They're
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; just not as revelated as me.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; It's been unsealed in this age.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; One time, I probably told you the story.
[2:12:48] We were in Hawaii. There was no message
[2:12:50] church there. And brother Mark, we went
[2:12:51] to UPC church. Not one time did I hear
[2:12:55] the Son of Man being preached. That's
[2:12:56] right.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Not one time did I hear did I hear the
[2:12:59] seals being preached and opened. Not one
[2:13:02] time did I hear that Jesus had returned
[2:13:04] on the earth in this age.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Not one time.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; And people tried to call me a Pentecost.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Running around the building like crazy
[2:13:15] and I didn't feel a thing. Brother
[2:13:16] Richard didn't feel one thing.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Pastor comes up to me, "You spoke in
[2:13:22] tongues?"
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Said, "Yes, sir." He asked my wife, "Are
[2:13:26] you spoken in tongues?" She said, "Yes,
[2:13:28] sir." He's like, "Ah, you're one of the
[2:13:29] weird ones." And then takes off running.
[2:13:36] But I learned a valuable lesson that
[2:13:37] day.
[2:13:40] The devil will try to imitate
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; and try to mimic anything he can to get
[2:13:46] your distraction away from the true move
[2:13:49] of God and to look at the false
[2:13:51] anointing and the false anointing over
[2:13:53] here.
[2:13:55] Don't make me come against the
[2:13:56] Methodists either.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Well, in my church, we don't act like
[2:14:04] that.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; There's never been a day like this day,
[2:14:11] friend.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; There has never been a revealed word in
[2:14:14] this hour like there is right now that
[2:14:16] the Son of Man is in plain view. He's
[2:14:19] been open to the age. Let me tell you
[2:14:21] this. If you're ever going to rejoice,
[2:14:23] Ellie, if you're ever going to rejoice,
[2:14:25] it's going to be in this age
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; because you're not going to change when
[2:14:30] you get over there. Don't think, brother
[2:14:32] Elijah, one day when I get a real
[2:14:33] victory, then I'm going to
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; It's happening now.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; This is the revival of the bride.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Don't withhold something from him when
[2:14:44] he has come down into our midst and he
[2:14:47] is asking of us.
[2:14:50] Do you recognize me?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; We're not looking at nail pierced hands.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; We're looking at the word.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; We're looking at the Messiah word
[2:15:01] returned in this age.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; I know where my eyes are fixed. Not
[2:15:07] fixed on some man. You could call me a
[2:15:08] man worshipper. You have no idea what I
[2:15:10] believe. I believe in the Messiah has
[2:15:12] come down in this age and he used the
[2:15:15] voice of William Brandham and he
[2:15:17] anointed his life that he could be
[2:15:19] someone to reach the pinnacle of what
[2:15:21] God can do in this age. But it didn't
[2:15:24] stop there. Thank God it continued on
[2:15:27] that you might be partakers of his
[2:15:29] holiness. That you might be partakers of
[2:15:32] his grace. That you can reach the
[2:15:34] heights of heaven.
[2:15:43] You're not given a Messiah sign. There's
[2:15:45] not another one coming.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Stop trying to measure yourself to what
[2:15:51] you think brother Brandon was.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Behind the gift, he was a believer.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; He was an adopted son of God
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; with the mechanics and the dynamics
[2:16:04] falling at the same time. I'm doing
[2:16:06] something dangerous. I'm I'm skipping
[2:16:07] through a bunch of notes.
[2:16:10] The mechanics and the dynamics at the
[2:16:13] same time, right? We've got mechanics.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Our Sunday school kids could out teach
[2:16:20] most theologians.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; We know the mechanics, friends, and we
[2:16:25] need them.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Do we need them?
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Be right in the scripture.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Be right in the scripture.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; But it'll just be dead works.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Right. Without the dynamic power
[2:16:38] applied,
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; it'll just be death theology without the
[2:16:42] dynamic power applied. Dynamics means
[2:16:45] the branch of mechanics concerned with
[2:16:47] the motion of bodies under the action of
[2:16:49] forces. The forces of properties which
[2:16:53] stimulate growth, development or change
[2:16:56] with the process
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; to stimulate growth
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; or change within the process.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that adopted sons
[2:17:12] can rejoice?
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; That adopted sons can have liberty to
[2:17:16] praise. that your adoption does not take
[2:17:19] away your ability to give God praise.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; But the dynamics and the mechanics have
[2:17:24] come together to grow you into the
[2:17:27] stature of Jesus Christ in this age.
[2:17:30] This is why the message camel
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; to grow you into the stature of what you
[2:17:38] were meant to be. This is the coming of
[2:17:41] Christ.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; This is his coming. This is why he has
[2:17:48] promised to come in this age. Remember,
[2:17:50] Satan will impersonate. He'll try to
[2:17:51] impersonate everything that the church
[2:17:53] will do. He's tried to do it. And we
[2:17:54] notice that in this one thing, he cannot
[2:17:56] impersonate.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; There will be no mimics cuz he don't
[2:18:00] know it.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; He don't know it. There's no way for him
[2:18:07] to know it. It's the third pole.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; He knows nothing about it. He doesn't
[2:18:13] understand it. But there's a secret that
[2:18:16] lays beneath that. Glory to God in the
[2:18:18] highest. I can never think the same the
[2:18:21] rest of my life. Hallelujah. I could
[2:18:23] relate. I can never think the same
[2:18:24] again. I don't know. I don't know where
[2:18:26] this next step is. I don't know what how
[2:18:28] to interpret that. It won't be long. But
[2:18:29] I've got it wrote down here when it
[2:18:30] happened.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; And right here, it tells them to stop
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; and go no further.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; You're not here.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Seal it up till the end time.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; What time are we in, friends? The
[2:18:44] mystery of it is those seals. Each one
[2:18:46] of those churches has made an
[2:18:47] organization and got into it. And that's
[2:18:49] one of the secret things that's been
[2:18:51] wrong before God. So there were secrets
[2:18:53] of what the church was falling into
[2:18:55] revealed in the seals. But there was a
[2:18:57] secret for the bride
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; revealed in them seals. Hallelujah. And
[2:19:03] the true word will come to a certain
[2:19:04] group of people. And the son of man will
[2:19:06] reveal himself in the midst of them. The
[2:19:09] same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh
[2:19:12] my. I love that. I love to brag on him.
[2:19:14] I love to make him big before the
[2:19:16] people. I don't have to make him big.
[2:19:18] He's already big. He's so high you can't
[2:19:21] get over him. He's so deep you can't get
[2:19:23] under him. So wide you can't get around
[2:19:25] him. And yet you got room in your heart
[2:19:27] for him. Oh, won't you receive this
[2:19:30] wonderful Lord tonight?
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What a mighty God we
[2:19:34] serve.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:45] So big you can't attain him. Yet he's
[2:19:47] small enough to come live in you.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were sometimes in
[2:19:53] darkness, but now we are in the light.
[2:19:56] Proving what is acceptable unto the
[2:19:58] Lord. Have no fellowship with the
[2:20:00] unfruitful works of darkness.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; You hear me, young people?
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Get it? have no fellowship with the
[2:20:09] unfruitful works of darkness.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; But rather reprove them,
[2:20:16] but all things are made manifest by the
[2:20:19] light.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Wherefore he say, awake thou that
[2:20:21] sleepeth and arise from the dead, and
[2:20:23] Christ shall give thee light. Who hath
[2:20:26] put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who
[2:20:28] hath given understanding to the heart?
[2:20:30] Job would say, the entrance of thy words
[2:20:33] giveth light. It giveth understanding
[2:20:36] unto the simple.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; brother Ben.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; It giveth understanding unto the simple.
[2:20:44] Now, remember, as I've said,
[2:20:45] everything's in a three. He's coming in
[2:20:47] a three. The first time he came to
[2:20:49] redeem his bride. The second time he
[2:20:50] comes to catch away his bride. Love
[2:20:51] affair comes around and steals out. At
[2:20:53] night time, takes her away from the
[2:20:55] world. Meet him in the air. The secret
[2:20:57] coming of the Lord. See, the second time
[2:21:00] he come is to receive his bride. first
[2:21:03] time to redeem her, second time to
[2:21:04] receive her, and the third time with her
[2:21:07] king and queen.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we're living in the
[2:21:13] seven church age when the Bible said in
[2:21:14] the seven church age uh sound his
[2:21:16] message that the mysteries uh and the
[2:21:18] things would be all twisted up and down
[2:21:20] through the age and revealed in that
[2:21:22] time. And here we see it, the son of man
[2:21:25] coming among his people and doing just
[2:21:27] exactly confirming his message that he
[2:21:30] said he would do it. And here we find it
[2:21:33] in the last age and the seven watches.
[2:21:35] The seven how he remembers the seven
[2:21:36] watches in the scripture. He didn't come
[2:21:38] the first watch, the second, third,
[2:21:39] fourth, but he come in the seventh
[2:21:41] watch. That was Enoch the seventh which
[2:21:43] was translated and Noah being a type of
[2:21:45] the ren of the Jews is carried over.
[2:21:48] Thinking about the watches now. Now
[2:21:50] we're not divided into hours.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; The night is not divided in hours in the
[2:21:56] Bible.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; It was divided in watches.
[2:22:00] There was three watches. Now the first
[2:22:02] watch was to start at 9 to 12. The
[2:22:04] second watch started from 12 to 3. And
[2:22:07] the third watch was was the night was
[2:22:09] counted 3 to six. Now we got three three
[2:22:11] which is nine an imperfect number.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; So three is only perfect in certain
[2:22:16] rotation.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Nine an imperfect number. Then we come
[2:22:22] back to the seven for the rapture which
[2:22:25] will take place I believe between 6 and
[2:22:28] 7:00 or 6 and 9:00 some morning for the
[2:22:33] trumpet of the Lord shall sound.
[2:22:36] Hallelujah.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; What time is it, friend?
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; It's between 6 and 9.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the coming of the
[2:22:47] Lord.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; If you're looking for him to descend,
[2:22:50] you missed it. The Lord has already
[2:22:52] come. We're not in the evening time. The
[2:22:55] evening time message was to prepare the
[2:22:57] church to receive the seed of God, but
[2:23:00] we're not in the night phase anymore.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got so much to preach on
[2:23:07] this. I'm just going to preach. We're
[2:23:08] not in the night season anymore,
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; but we're in another season. This is
[2:23:12] your season to be blessed. This is your
[2:23:15] season to raise up out of darkness. This
[2:23:18] is the breaking light. How do you know?
[2:23:20] The pastor said a few weeks ago, "How do
[2:23:21] you know whether it's a sunrise or a
[2:23:22] sunset?" It depends on which direction
[2:23:24] you're looking. It depends on if you
[2:23:26] know what time it is. I know what time
[2:23:28] it is. This is bride time. This is not
[2:23:32] going into an evening, but the evening
[2:23:34] and the day were the first day and the
[2:23:37] second day. And God said it was good
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; because it's the rising of the sun.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Friend, the Messiah is rising over the
[2:23:45] church.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:49] It's the rising of the sun, friend.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; It's bride time.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; It's morning time.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; We're not going down.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; We're coming up.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; We're not getting ready for a great a
[2:24:01] great tribulation.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Not me.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I'm rising up. I've been called and
[2:24:07] elected to see a bride rising up in this
[2:24:10] day.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; I say there's a bride age open. Why
[2:24:13] don't we step all the way into it?
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:17] The anointed one. Is that what Messiah
[2:24:20] means?
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; That's what the message means to me.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; This is the anointed one.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; And it knows who's his.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; It knows who belongs to him.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; It has their names inscribed on the
[2:24:42] palms of his hands. Amen.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; You're not going to miss it, friend. You
[2:24:47] just got to step into it.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Rather, I'll say this. He's stepping
[2:24:51] into you.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; There he was. Brother Bram said, pulled
[2:24:57] some pot ash and some chemicals and
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; he created a body in Melzdc.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Came and stepped into it. Brother
[2:25:05] Jonathan, he's doing the same thing in
[2:25:07] this hour.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; He's stepping into you.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; He's stepping into your body.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; I know what this kind of preaching does.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; It challenges us.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; You think, "Oh, no."
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Don't let your pride
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; get in the way of his grace.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Couldn't get away from it. Noah got to
[2:25:29] preach grace.
[2:25:31] Don't let your pride
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; get in the way of his plan.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; If he chose you,
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; then he's able to change you.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes,
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; if he chose you and he's stepping into
[2:25:46] you, then he's able to make all things
[2:25:48] new. This is the age we're living in.
[2:25:51] It's one of the grandest ages of ages,
[2:25:54] the grandest of all church ages because
[2:25:56] it's the ending time blending of
[2:25:58] eternity. And now we're approaching
[2:26:00] these seven seals. We just finished the
[2:26:01] message of the seventh ages. This
[2:26:03] message on teaching that's going to be
[2:26:04] redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[2:26:06] That eternal age at the end of the
[2:26:08] seals.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; You know where we're at now, right?
[2:26:14] Now you see it's a door.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; I just was thanking the Lord when you
[2:26:17] said that brother Wayne Leo to see his
[2:26:19] door shut
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; but we're not in Revelations 3.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; We're in Revelations 4
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; and there's another door opened.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not in Leodysia, friend.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; This is the coming of the Lord. You see
[2:26:35] it's this door. The next thing is the
[2:26:37] coming of the Lord. Amen.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we realize we're at the
[2:26:46] closing time. Time is running out. It's
[2:26:48] blending with eternity.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; We're at the west coast and civilization
[2:26:52] has traveled east to west. So has the
[2:26:53] gospel traveled with it. And now there
[2:26:55] is no place to go back to.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; It's completed.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; The work is finished. He has arrived. I
[2:27:09] know you know it well. Perosa, Matthew
[2:27:12] 24, the coming, arrival, event,
[2:27:17] the future visible return of heaven from
[2:27:20] heaven to Jesus to raise the dead and
[2:27:23] set up formally his glorious kingdom.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; What I wanted to take from this is that
[2:27:28] noun, brother Diego, if it was perceio,
[2:27:32] it would be masculine,
[2:27:34] but it's parosia.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. Bride
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; is feminine.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; He's coming in the bride body.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? He's come
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; looking for
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; this is the one.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; That my soul has longed for.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; This is the one. And when it becomes a
[2:28:02] revelation to you
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; that Messiah has come in you
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; and has brought all of his benefits with
[2:28:10] you.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; It's the end of all strife.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; It's the end of all depression.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; It's the end of all sickness.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; When it's a revelation to you
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; that you're already healed.
[2:28:29] You know, some of you could have been
[2:28:30] healed and were healed while this word
[2:28:33] was going forth.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; You know, spirits were lifted.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Hearts were turned.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Last night, I watched a man of God get
[2:28:44] so out of the way, come right down into
[2:28:46] somebody's living room.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; What does that?
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; It's not Isaac.
[2:28:55] It's not me. It's not Nathan,
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; It's the Messiah.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Troy, what gave you the
[2:29:05] authority to talk to your sister-in-law?
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing in his church.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; He's arrived
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; in her. She is him.
[2:29:22] She is him. Brother Ben, if you come or
[2:29:25] whoever's doing the music,
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; When you have the revelation within you
[2:29:34] that healing is not coming,
[2:29:37] it has come.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Your joy is not coming,
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; it's arrived.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Your victory is not going to show up one
[2:29:49] day. is here now.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; God heals in many ways.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; We believe that doctors help people. I
[2:29:58] believe that God heals by medicine.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; God heals by surgery.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; But God heals by understanding.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; So as the word's being preached
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; and understanding is striking the soul,
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; healing is taking place. Amen.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Understanding is changing. Understanding
[2:30:21] is bringing love. Love is activating the
[2:30:23] third pole.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; It's a word revival, friend.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not shouting because I feel like it.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; I'm shouting because the word has
[2:30:34] returned.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever source it is, it's God that
[2:30:42] heals.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm the Lord that health all thy
[2:30:45] diseases.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like music.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; You know, God heals by music.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; God heals by music. God heals by love.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; God heals by medicine. God heals by
[2:31:05] prayer.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; God has many ways of healing. Depends on
[2:31:09] what type you need. Come on.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes a little love
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; stretched out.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't know how far your
[2:31:18] hugs go.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord likes it.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Can I share? Me and
[2:31:30] Brother Ray had a moment.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Just a hug.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Turned into a visitation of an angel.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:31:40] He inhabits love.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; And how can he love? How could God
[2:31:48] embrace you?
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; God heals by that. There's many ways of
[2:31:53] healing.
[2:31:55] Sometimes little love will just cure an
[2:31:56] old sore.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; An old place where there's been a grudge
[2:32:01] or something. It'll heal it right over.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Just a little love,
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; a little care.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been struggling with
[2:32:09] somebody in your life. Why don't you ask
[2:32:10] the Lord, "Create in me a care."
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Create in me a care. Sometimes when you
[2:32:17] feel all down, as we call it, just a
[2:32:19] street expression down in the dump seat.
[2:32:21] Just put on one of those tapes.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; I'll say this, maybe sometimes the best
[2:32:27] thing you can do when you're feeling
[2:32:29] down in the dumps is put on a tape.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Cuz God heals in there.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; God heals in that music. God heals in
[2:32:39] that preaching.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; God heals through that word.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Might just be a little grain of sand.
[2:32:44] But when that little grain of sand, you
[2:32:45] stand on it. It's not like the rock of
[2:32:48] Jialter. It's the rock of ages.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Stand there and you will feel the sound
[2:32:52] of abundance of rain. You are God's
[2:32:55] child. Satan has put that affliction
[2:32:58] upon you. And you know what? And Christ
[2:33:00] has already healed every one of you.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; This is a vindicated word prophet.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Christ has already healed every one of
[2:33:09] you.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus has already paid the price. And in
[2:33:16] the sight of God, you are already
[2:33:18] healed. There's no sickness in the sight
[2:33:20] of God. Every sinner here inside out,
[2:33:22] wherever you are, all your sins are, as
[2:33:24] far as God is concerned, are forgiven
[2:33:28] now.
[2:33:30] Yes, sir.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; with his presence?
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed that the
[2:33:42] Messiah has come in this age?
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; I just took an hour and a half to tell
[2:33:46] you scriptures you knew front and back.
[2:33:48] But it identifies he's here now.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; He's here amongst in the midst of his
[2:33:54] people. And I saw one in the midst of
[2:33:57] them. Right.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; In the middle of their situation, in the
[2:34:01] middle of their sickness. Oh, he cares.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; He cares enough to come down.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; And change hearts and change lives. Turn
[2:34:15] situations around. Open blinded eyes
[2:34:17] that they could see.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Open ears to hear.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, how much he cares.
[2:34:26] This is it, friend.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; He couldn't go no further to reveal this
[2:34:30] secret. At that time, it had already
[2:34:33] been revealed when the spirit come upon
[2:34:35] him and said, "Pick up your pen and
[2:34:36] write, "This is the secret, Nathan."
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; The word is in the bride.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's the great mystery, friend.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; The son of man has returned in
[2:34:52] authority.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:55] Hallelujah.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; We are standing
[2:35:07] on holy
[2:35:09] ground.
[2:35:16] And I know
[2:35:20] that there
[2:35:22] are angels
[2:35:26] all around.
[2:35:34] Let us pray.
[2:35:39] Won't you stand with us?
[2:35:42] Jesus
[2:35:50] for we are standing
[2:35:55] in
[2:35:57] his presence
[2:35:59] on holy
[2:36:02] ground.
[2:36:07] Yes, we are standing.
[2:36:26] And I know
[2:36:29] that there
[2:36:31] are
[2:36:49] Jesus.
[2:36:55] Oh, we are standing
[2:36:59] and we are standing
[2:37:03] in
[2:37:05] his presence
[2:37:07] of holy
[2:37:14] He is here.
[2:37:19] Hallelu.
[2:37:23] He is here.
[2:37:33] He
[2:37:34] is here.
[2:37:38] Holy,
[2:37:40] holy,
[2:37:43] I will bless
[2:37:47] his name
[2:37:50] again.
[2:37:52] He is here.
[2:38:08] Your name.
[2:38:11] He is here.
[2:38:16] You
[2:38:18] can touch him.
[2:38:21] You will never
[2:38:25] be
[2:38:27] the same. Yes, he is here.
[2:38:46] Father,
[2:38:53] holy,
[2:38:56] holy,
[2:38:58] I will bless
[2:39:02] his name
[2:39:05] again.
[2:39:07] He is here.
[2:39:16] See,
[2:39:24] your name
[2:39:27] is
[2:39:31] you
[2:39:33] can see.
[2:39:36] You will
[2:39:41] be
[2:39:42] the same.
[2:39:58] little girl was lying there.
[2:40:03] People all were weeping.
[2:40:07] They just laughed at Jesus way.
[2:40:12] He said she's only singing.
[2:40:17] As he took her by the hand,
[2:40:22] she began to live again.
[2:40:27] Some began to praise the Lord.
[2:40:32] Some begin
[2:40:42] in the house.
[2:40:45] So death
[2:40:48] to
[2:40:51] now there is light
[2:40:55] where darkness used to be.
[2:41:00] Now there is there's no
[2:41:12] name
[2:41:18] in the house.
[2:41:27] We were like that little girl,
[2:41:32] dead in all our sin.

[4:01:48] You know, we've heard a word tonight.
[4:01:51] We've experienced the grace of God
[4:01:53] tonight.
[4:01:55] Amen. I I identify with Jonathan.
[4:01:59] Amen. When he didn't listen to the words
[4:02:01] of Saul, he went up and found the honey.
[4:02:04] And Amen. And he didn't have the
[4:02:07] limitations
[4:02:09] of Saul who was a type of that of that
[4:02:12] king. That was the choice of those that
[4:02:14] had rejected Samuel.
[4:02:17] But Jonathan, he wanted he wanted
[4:02:19] something. Amen. That man said he
[4:02:21] couldn't have. And there's a lot of
[4:02:23] people said we can't have what we have
[4:02:25] tonight.
[4:02:27] &gt;&gt; But brother, Amen. I got a mouthful of
[4:02:29] the goodness.
[4:02:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:02:31] &gt;&gt; I got a life full of the sweetness.
[4:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:02:36] I think over the last few weeks I've
[4:02:38] realized something more.
[4:02:40] It's something I know,
[4:02:42] &gt;&gt; but it's something I've realized more
[4:02:43] and more and more. God
[4:02:47] is love.
[4:02:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:02:50] &gt;&gt; God
[4:02:52] is love.
[4:02:55] &gt;&gt; And when the love of God begins to move
[4:02:57] around you, you can't mistake it for
[4:03:00] anything else.
[4:03:02] &gt;&gt; That feeling, I want to forgive
[4:03:03] somebody. That's God dealing with you.
[4:03:06] &gt;&gt; That feeling I I I want to love
[4:03:07] somebody. I want to I want to thank God
[4:03:09] for their mercy. God give them gra.
[4:03:11] That's that's God dealing with you.
[4:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:03:13] &gt;&gt; God is love.
[4:03:16] You know, in a message of total
[4:03:18] deliverance, brother Brandham preached
[4:03:20] about Moses and he talked about Moses
[4:03:23] who was in Egypt and he could never he
[4:03:25] could never totally deliver the children
[4:03:28] &gt;&gt; until he was totally delivered himself.
[4:03:31] And when he was a totally a prophet,
[4:03:33] they could be totally delivered. And in
[4:03:36] that sermon, brother Ram said Moses
[4:03:38] wasn't a compromiser.
[4:03:40] He wanted a complete deliverance. He
[4:03:42] said, "We'll not even leave one hoof
[4:03:44] behind.
[4:03:46] &gt;&gt; We'll take everything that belongs to us
[4:03:50] when we go to worship the Lord."
[4:03:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the way the church ought to
[4:03:54] be.
[4:03:55] &gt;&gt; We'll take righteousness. We'll take
[4:03:57] holiness. We'll take the Holy Spirit.
[4:04:01] We'll take a unified group when we go to
[4:04:03] the altar. We'll be a real group. We'll
[4:04:06] not leave nothing behind. We'll take
[4:04:08] everything. There won't even be one
[4:04:11] hoof. Stay back here. You know, people
[4:04:13] can pray in such a way to the devil.
[4:04:15] We're going to just have to give in.
[4:04:18] Amen. I say, God, make this that kind of
[4:04:20] church. Make this that kind of church.
[4:04:24] When we pray, we pray together. When we
[4:04:27] rejoice, we rejoice together.
[4:04:30] Amen. I thank God for it tonight. Don't
[4:04:32] you? What a merciful God. What a
[4:04:35] merciful God. Hallelujah.
[4:04:39] Amen. Amen. What a powerful word
[4:04:41] tonight. Let's bow our hearts. Almighty
[4:04:43] God, we thank you, Lord. We thank you
[4:04:46] for the surge of the anointing, Lord. We
[4:04:49] thank you for the man of God that's
[4:04:51] stealed away, Lord. And Lord, we know
[4:04:54] what we know what those sermons cost a
[4:04:57] man, Lord. They give part of their life
[4:05:00] to this. There's there's times, Lord, I
[4:05:03] know locked away,
[4:05:06] Lord, with you and away from family,
[4:05:09] away from friends. Lord, just locked
[4:05:12] away seeking the mind of God for the
[4:05:15] children of God. And Lord, I thank you

[4:05:21] you would reveal it openly. And Lord,

[4:05:29] that he would surrender that gift for
[4:05:31] this body tonight. We thank you for the
[4:05:34] words that's been spoke through him.

[4:05:37] that's visited this place. Lord, I I

[4:05:45] that have gathered in this building.

[4:05:58] that is among them. Father, I know that
[4:06:01] in an age of division and confusion,
[4:06:03] there could be so much. But Lord, God,
[4:06:06] you've made it such that the men of God
[4:06:09] in this place have joined hearts
[4:06:10] together to come against the enemy. And
[4:06:13] I thank you for them, Lord. And I ask
[4:06:15] that you would anoint them and bless
[4:06:17] them. I pray, Father, that the blessings
[4:06:19] of God be upon this families and upon
[4:06:22] the lives of these people here tonight.

[4:06:38] journey, Father. We ask it in Jesus'
