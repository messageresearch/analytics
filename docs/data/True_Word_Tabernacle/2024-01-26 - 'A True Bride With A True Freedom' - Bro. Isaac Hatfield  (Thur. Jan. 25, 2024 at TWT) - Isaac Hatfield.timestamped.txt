[29:44] and that he's given me and it's just
[29:47] been wonderful in my life and just the
[29:49] church as a whole all the support that
[29:52] has always been given I sure appreciate
[29:54] it as a young Minister and everything it
[29:57] it means the world to me and I know not
[29:59] everyone has that and so I just want to
[30:01] say thank you amen and we appreciate you
[30:04] from our hearts and if you have your
[30:06] Bibles tonight and you could turn with
[30:07] us to the Book of
[30:09] John have a couple texts out of John and
[30:13] then John 8 and then we'll go to
[30:18] Galatians and we'll read John 8 starting
[30:22] in the 31st
[30:26] verse
[30:31] says then said Jesus to those Jews which
[30:35] believed on him if you continue in my
[30:38] word then are you my disciples indeed
[30:41] and you shall know the truth and the
[30:43] truth shall make you free they answered
[30:46] him we be Abraham's seed and were never
[30:48] in bondage to any man so how sayest thou
[30:51] you shall be made free Jesus answered
[30:54] them verily verily I say unto you what
[30:56] whosoever commit commited sin is the
[30:58] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[31:01] not in the house forever but the son
[31:03] abideth forever if the son therefore
[31:05] shall make you free you shall be free
[31:08] indeed and then down to 43 and 47 it
[31:11] says why do you not understand my speech
[31:14] even because you cannot hear my word and
[31:17] he that is of God heareth God's words ye
[31:20] therefor hear them not because ye are
[31:22] not of God we want to turn over to
[31:24] Galatians 4 for one more reading and
[31:26] then
[31:28] we can have you be seated Galatians
[31:32] 4 starting in verse 21 down to the end
[31:36] of the
[31:38] chapter says tell me ye that desire to
[31:40] be under the law do you not hear the law
[31:44] for it is written that Abraham had two
[31:46] sons the one by a bondmaid the other by
[31:48] a free woman and then brother Brandon
[31:51] would go on to tell us that third son
[31:54] was that that Royal seed son not not
[31:56] through Hagar Sarah but through Christ
[31:59] The Royal seed and he said but he who
[32:02] was of the Bond woman was born after the
[32:04] flesh but he of the free woman was by
[32:06] promise which things are an allegory for
[32:09] these are the two covenants the one from
[32:11] the Mount Si which gendereth to bondage
[32:13] which is AAR for this AAR is Mount Si in
[32:16] Arabia and anth to Jerusalem which now
[32:18] is and is in bondage with her children
[32:21] but Jerusalem which is above is free
[32:23] which is the mother of us all for it is
[32:25] written Rejoice thou baren that bearish
[32:27] not break forth and cry thou that
[32:30] travest not for the desolate hath many
[32:32] more children than she with hath an
[32:34] husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are
[32:37] the children of promise but as in he
[32:39] that was born after the flesh persecuted
[32:42] him that was born after the spirit even
[32:43] so it is now nevertheless what saith the
[32:46] scripture cast out the Bond woman and
[32:48] her son for the son of the Bond woman
[32:51] shall not be Heir with the son of the
[32:52] free woman so then brethren we are not
[32:54] children of the Bond woman but of the
[32:57] free amen we could just bow our
[33:00] heads Heavenly Father we just thank you
[33:02] for your grace in our lives Lord that
[33:05] you saw fit to gather us together once
[33:07] again into your house and Lord we just
[33:10] believe that you've got something in
[33:12] mind father Lord every time you bring us
[33:15] together that you've pre-arranged the
[33:17] the moments father Lord that you would
[33:19] speak to your children and Lord although
[33:22] we don't have any ability of our own
[33:24] we're asking that you just come by and
[33:25] just take these words and just use them
[33:28] to speak to the hearts of your children
[33:30] father Lord even those that couldn't be
[33:32] here tonight that are homesick father I
[33:34] pray that you just go by their way and
[33:35] just send them a word of encouragement
[33:38] father many of them Lord are in that
[33:41] state for some years now Lord and and
[33:44] how they would long to be in this
[33:45] Fellowship Lord here but Lord You've not
[33:49] forgotten them Father and we've ask that
[33:51] you just go by their way and just come
[33:53] by the pews here every chair Lord and
[33:56] just speak Lord the words of life to the
[33:59] hungering children father we just commit
[34:01] the service to you in Jesus name amen
[34:03] amen you could have your seats if we
[34:06] just want to take a little thought out
[34:07] of that about a true bride with a true
[34:11] Freedom a true bride with the true
[34:13] freedom and and brother brandham uh
[34:16] deals with Jubilee uh often times he
[34:19] preaches return in Jubilee Jubilee year
[34:21] ausa Jubilee and in this Jubilee he
[34:24] talking about the children of Israel how
[34:26] they were given in inheritance and
[34:28] Joshua divided the inheritance you know
[34:30] as those names were spoken out and they
[34:32] were given a portion of land to to each
[34:35] son to e to each one that that that they
[34:38] would be spoken under that adoption that
[34:41] they would have a lotted inheritance to
[34:43] them and and but if time would go on and
[34:46] and they would come into maybe a
[34:49] situation of of poverty or or things
[34:51] like that where they would lose their
[34:53] inheritance God provided a way that they
[34:56] could return back back to what they had
[34:57] lost that every 50 years there would be
[34:59] a jubilee year where where Sons true
[35:02] Israelite true born Israelites could
[35:04] return back to the inheritance that they
[35:07] had lost for it was a god-given
[35:09] inheritance and God had provided away
[35:11] but it was only for trueborn Sons it
[35:14] wasn't just for anybody it wasn't for
[35:15] the servants it was for sons and brother
[35:18] brandom takes that and ties that back to
[35:20] that John 8:35 that says the servant
[35:23] abideth not in the house forever but the
[35:25] son abideth forever he said he said
[35:28] that's why it had to be for Sons because
[35:29] Sons abide they weren't just brought
[35:31] into there by their own free will they
[35:33] were placed there before the foundation
[35:35] of the world they were predestinated
[35:37] onto that inheritance and and and God
[35:39] provided a jubilee for those Sons which
[35:42] came from God which were in God's mind
[35:44] and he said the servants get their
[35:46] reward but you're different as a Son of
[35:48] God you're different you're you're not
[35:50] airs with the world you're not air with
[35:52] the natural church but you're a
[35:54] different people you're separated people
[35:56] he said even even the Hypocrites get the
[35:57] reward but you're different there's
[35:59] something about you you've got an
[36:01] inheritance you've got a positional
[36:03] placing in this word and if you've
[36:05] fallen from that what man could do in
[36:07] failing and in sin and in mistakes what
[36:10] man could do in Falling Away God could
[36:12] do a greater work to bring you back in
[36:15] in all your mistakes and all your
[36:16] Humanity God provided a way that you
[36:19] could return back to your joy back to
[36:21] your peace back to the baptism of the
[36:23] Holy Ghost and everything that God's
[36:26] provided for you but you had to know the
[36:27] sound of a trumpet you had to know the
[36:30] sound of the word that went forth which
[36:31] is why you had to be a son because he
[36:34] said my sheep know my voice only Sons
[36:37] could recognize that trumpet sound only
[36:39] sheep could recognize that Shepherd's
[36:41] voice and mean you can't be joined or
[36:44] bought you have to be
[36:46] birthed uh uh through by one Spirit
[36:49] you're baptized into one body and by
[36:52] Grace you could return to your
[36:53] inheritance and he said I believe this
[36:55] is the hour again of Jubilee only this
[36:58] time it's not a priest sounding forth
[37:00] the trumpet as you all know but it's the
[37:02] the minister sounding forth the gospel
[37:04] trumpet declaring onto you who you are
[37:07] where you came from where you're going
[37:09] and that you have a right to return uh
[37:11] for for man was not made to be a slave
[37:13] but man was made to be free man was not
[37:16] made to be caged up in in condemnation
[37:19] and confusion and and the the teaching
[37:22] of men throughout the ages who would
[37:24] pervert the scripture but man was made
[37:26] for free Freedom he said those slaves
[37:28] out there on those block they would take
[37:30] little girls and sell them he said that
[37:31] was never God's program that was never
[37:34] God's desire man was not made for that
[37:36] he said there's nothing to dominate over
[37:38] us but himself our only headship our
[37:41] only Dominion was ever meant to be this
[37:43] word was ever meant to be almighty God
[37:46] this word is our headship no man is our
[37:48] headship no denomination is our headship
[37:51] no idea is our headship but God's called
[37:53] and placed a word in this age to be our
[37:55] headship and mean it's he the word it's
[37:58] Christ the word no other headship he
[38:01] said he resents anyone taking over his
[38:03] lordship and Authority you know maybe
[38:05] like you go out and you buy a new
[38:07] car and your neighbor just comes and he
[38:10] just starts driving it around without
[38:12] asking he starts using it whenever he
[38:14] wants to and and Wrecking it into other
[38:16] cars not even taking care of it and you
[38:18] say well I paid good money for that I I
[38:21] bought that with my own money I got the
[38:22] deed right here that's mine and that's
[38:24] how God feels about his bride he paid
[38:26] his own blood for this bride and he
[38:29] resents any other lordship trying to
[38:31] come over his bride but it's his bride
[38:33] it's it's his chosen ones that he has
[38:36] dominion over amen even so much till he
[38:39] said it said that he hated the very
[38:41] Deeds of the
[38:43] nians what was so wrong about that that
[38:46] after Pentecost this false Vine started
[38:49] to get in and intertwin with that True
[38:51] Vine he said what was so wrong what was
[38:54] so terrible about it is because God
[38:55] never ordained that his church would be
[38:57] under the hands of elected leadership
[39:00] with moves that moves with political
[39:02] mindedness he has placed his church in
[39:04] the care of God ordained spirit filled
[39:07] word living men who lead the people
[39:09] through feeding them the word you see
[39:11] it's brother brandom's attitude on
[39:13] slavery he could look out and like
[39:15] Abraham Lincoln could say if it takes my
[39:18] life I'll get the slave Bell off of
[39:20] those slaves naturally brother Brandon
[39:22] could look out say if it takes my life
[39:24] I'll get that unbelief off the people
[39:26] people I'll get them free from this this
[39:28] bondage this denominations I'll lead
[39:31] them to a freedom in the word I'll lead
[39:32] them to a place where they can be loosed
[39:35] from all the confusion and the worry and
[39:37] all the other ideas and all if it takes
[39:40] my life you see he wasn't he wasn't he
[39:43] wasn't giv no place to the devil to have
[39:46] rulership in the lives of the Bride amen
[39:49] he said it's the saddest thing I saw was
[39:51] an eagle in a cage the saddest thing he
[39:54] saw you know when he would go to the zoo
[39:56] and he would would see that eagle
[39:57] beating its head against the cage said
[39:59] it's the saddest thing I saw there he
[40:01] was looking to that sky and because he
[40:03] was an eagle the only Instinct he had in
[40:06] him was to try to get to that Sky try to
[40:08] get to that Higher Ground because that's
[40:10] what he was ordained for he said even
[40:12] sadder was to see mankind caged caged up
[40:16] because that eagle didn't put himself in
[40:18] that cage it was the cunningness of man
[40:21] that put him in that cage and there he
[40:23] was under that cunningness of man and
[40:26] and how brother Brandon could look out
[40:28] and he say I see Sons and Daughters of
[40:30] God and they're not caged by their own
[40:32] decision but man had tooken this gospel
[40:35] and perverted it and added their own
[40:37] ideas into it and their own their own
[40:39] opinions into it and it's cage Sons and
[40:41] Daughters of God and held them back from
[40:43] their inheritance held them back from
[40:45] the promise of the Holy Ghost and and
[40:48] true joy and true peace amen he said
[40:51] they're caged amen but but God has
[40:53] provided a better way for man was not
[40:56] made to rule over man but brother B said
[40:58] God sent the Holy Ghost on the day of
[41:00] Pentecost to rule in the heart of man
[41:03] and mean that's the leadership he's
[41:04] called us
[41:05] to and then you see those children of
[41:08] Israel and maybe we've shared it before
[41:10] how they were back in the early days
[41:14] they they walked brother said that God
[41:15] was a father King to them God provided
[41:18] for them he fought their battles he won
[41:20] their Wars he he he brought them Mana he
[41:23] he he he led them to water he was he was
[41:26] their the father King he busied himself
[41:28] over them but when they looked out and
[41:30] they saw those Philistines led by a
[41:32] natural Army there's something in their
[41:34] hearts because man has a natural
[41:36] tendency to want to be ruled by men and
[41:39] and want to be ruled so brother brandham
[41:41] looked out and he could see this first
[41:43] church how they traded the rulership of
[41:45] man the rulership of a living God for
[41:47] the rulership of man and they looked out
[41:49] at that Philistine Army and said uh we
[41:51] want to be ruled by them we want a king
[41:54] like they had to lead us into battle we
[41:56] want a a natural leadership but but they
[41:59] say we still want to blow the trumpets
[42:00] we still want to do all these things we
[42:02] still want to to walk and and go into
[42:05] battle with the priest going before us
[42:06] but the only thing is we want a natural
[42:08] leadership instead of this Pillar of
[42:10] Fire that makes us different but what
[42:13] they didn't realize that the very thing
[42:14] that made them different was that Holy
[42:16] Ghost leadership they thought they made
[42:18] have thought the Miracles were coming
[42:19] from the trumpets or the priests but it
[42:21] wasn't so the Miracles came from a
[42:24] living God in their midst and they Creed
[42:26] that for the rulership of man and went
[42:28] into the same kind of slavery but God
[42:30] did not intend for man to be ruled by
[42:33] man but God provided a holy ghost
[42:34] leadership to lead the church to lead
[42:37] you to your inheritance to lead you to
[42:39] your land amen that was God's way and it
[42:42] doesn't do away with true men of God it
[42:45] doesn't do away with the five-fold
[42:46] ministry because men who had that spirit
[42:49] in them you can't separate that Spirit
[42:51] from that word and if a true Holy Ghost
[42:53] Place son or daughter of God ruling in
[42:56] Authority has that spirit in them they
[42:58] won't Lead You contrary to this word but
[43:00] it'll be the leadership of the Holy
[43:01] Ghost that's picked up vessels of Flesh
[43:04] and use them to preach the gospel use
[43:06] them to Pastor the Sheep use them to
[43:09] evangelize it's not the leadership of
[43:11] man but it's just God has took on flesh
[43:13] and can speak through lips amen you you
[43:16] say uh we don't have a headship issue we
[43:19] don't have an issue with the fold
[43:20] Ministry it's just let them be born
[43:22] again don't let them enter the sacred
[43:24] desk without an experience on the
[43:26] backside of the desert that God could
[43:28] rule through their lives anden God's
[43:31] always used man but man is not the
[43:33] leader it's God you're just a vessel
[43:35] that he took a hold of brother Mike that
[43:37] God could use your lips that you could
[43:39] lay yourself aside and it's he that
[43:40] comes in you it's he that speaks through
[43:43] the lips of these men it's he that uses
[43:45] them and and you wonder how did he know
[43:47] that how did he know I was dealing with
[43:49] that it's not them it's God ruling and
[43:52] leading through his sons and his
[43:54] daughters but you got to have men that
[43:56] will let the word lead that was what was
[43:59] so special about Joshua was though he
[44:01] was a great leader though he had great
[44:03] abilities he had enough humility and
[44:05] enough wisdom to let the word lead let
[44:08] the word lead into battle because he was
[44:09] under a commission stay with the message
[44:12] of Moses stay with what Moses said and
[44:14] if you let the word lead and you keep
[44:16] that direction it'll keep you anden you
[44:19] can get out in your own ideas and end up
[44:21] in a ditch somewhere if you want to oh
[44:23] but it's blind leading the blind but if
[44:25] you let that word lead it'll lead you
[44:27] into the Rapture it'll lead you to that
[44:29] third pole it'll lead you to everything
[44:31] it'll lead you to a resurrection if you
[44:33] just let the word lead amen but you got
[44:36] to be able to get out of the way and let
[44:38] the word
[44:40] lead see we're not prisoners to the
[44:42] church we've been called come out from
[44:44] among them you see brother BR we talk
[44:47] about these ones is that I I burn a
[44:49] candle every night brother brandom or I
[44:51] belong to the Methodist I belong to the
[44:53] Baptist he said people will get down to
[44:55] the altar
[44:56] and maybe even cry and get up and all
[44:58] they can talk about is their
[45:00] church and what God's doing in in their
[45:03] church and their new building and all
[45:05] this natural stuff and and they don't
[45:07] know church or church order they don't
[45:09] even have a real love for God he said it
[45:11] shows they it shows they got a church
[45:13] Spirit instead of his spirit and there's
[45:15] no comparison in the two you must
[45:17] receive the spirit of God it'll make you
[45:20] different I don't think we should water
[45:22] it down to just joining a church or
[45:24] sitting on a Pew the spirit of God is De
[45:27] dwelling in flesh again it'll make you a
[45:29] son it'll put you in adoption it'll
[45:31] change your body it'll bring you healing
[45:34] Deliverance it'll take you into every
[45:36] step of this word brother Seth it'll
[45:38] lead you through this scripture it'll
[45:40] show you things you never thought you
[45:41] could understand because it's not the
[45:43] spirit of a man it's the spirit of a God
[45:46] that could come into human flesh amen
[45:49] don't be deceived in your experience the
[45:51] Bond woman shall not be air with the
[45:53] free woman he said one is the bride and
[45:55] one is the church they'll not be heirs
[45:58] together they're not associated together
[46:00] they're absolutely two different
[46:01] promises two different times two
[46:04] different peoples all together one is
[46:06] the bride and one is the church just as
[46:09] Ishmael and Isaac could not be heirs
[46:11] together this church and bride cannot be
[46:13] hirs together brother Bram said it's the
[46:15] natural church and the spiritual church
[46:18] they are two different separate times
[46:20] two different separate people under two
[46:22] different separate covenants not that
[46:24] Mount Si you're not under that law
[46:27] anymore you're not under that bondage
[46:29] anymore you're under grace you see you
[46:32] got to recognize who you are in the
[46:34] scripture if you want to come to True
[46:36] Freedom you got to recognize who you are
[46:38] you got to recognize are you a part of
[46:40] the church or are you a part of the
[46:42] bride and if you're a part of the Bride
[46:44] you can realize that you're under a
[46:45] different Covenant you didn't deserve it
[46:47] you didn't do nothing to earn it but
[46:49] it's your land God's put you under a
[46:51] Grace Covenant you're not under legalism
[46:53] anymore you're under a message crying
[46:55] Grace Grace onto you you're not under
[46:57] the Methodist bondage or the Pentecostal
[47:00] bondage he say well if I don't dance it
[47:02] I don't got it that's legalism that that
[47:05] we come out of God's called you out of
[47:07] that legalism brother B said it's not if
[47:09] we dance or if we shout we've already
[47:11] made it God did a work in your life and
[47:13] the devil cannot reverse it whether you
[47:16] shout or whether you don't whether you
[47:17] dance or whether you don't whether you
[47:20] cry or whether you don't he said come
[47:22] out over my people and come into the
[47:24] liberty of my word
[47:26] oh I've called you out of that come out
[47:28] from among that legalism Amen brother BR
[47:31] said Ruth worked through those stages of
[47:33] legalism because she was trying to find
[47:35] favor with Boaz so she worked through
[47:37] Methodist
[47:38] legalism of trying to find favor through
[47:41] works and and then she worked through
[47:43] the stages of Pentecost but now she's
[47:45] coming to the stage of rest now she's
[47:47] coming to the stage you're not trying to
[47:49] find favor with God you're already
[47:51] favored you're blessed and highly
[47:54] favored amen the very fact that he chose
[47:57] you and put the Seal of his Spirit on
[47:59] your life shows that you're
[48:02] favored there's no comparison in them at
[48:05] all brother Brenham said when the
[48:07] carinal and spiritual meets there's
[48:09] always a clash but come out from among
[48:12] them and be ye separate saith the Lord
[48:15] touch not the unclean thing and I will
[48:17] receive you he said if there ever was a
[48:19] coming out time it ought to be
[48:22] now brother bam said I am a
[48:24] segregational
[48:27] well that flipped the flipped the script
[48:29] there he said because I can't care how
[48:30] much they argue you cannot be a
[48:33] Christian and an
[48:34] integrationist God separates his Nations
[48:37] his people what does that mean I I try
[48:39] to look up a definition of what an
[48:42] integrationist is and it's to bring
[48:45] together or incorporate into a whole to
[48:47] make up combine or complete to produce a
[48:50] whole or larger unit as parts do he said
[48:53] he said I'm not a segregationist as
[48:54] slavery but I am a there is a
[48:57] segregation he said the bride of Christ
[48:59] is segregated from the rest of the
[49:01] churches he said it's the church natural
[49:03] and the church spiritual the church
[49:05] carnal and the church the
[49:07] word amen so we're not under a false
[49:10] Unity they say well in the multitude of
[49:12] counsel there's safety he said you
[49:14] better be careful who you're counseling
[49:16] with he said they take you can take the
[49:18] scripture and make it mean anything you
[49:20] want to he said that scripture was
[49:22] actually meant for war it wasn't meant
[49:24] for church it wasn't meant for for the
[49:26] believer it was meant for war in the
[49:27] multitude of counsel but when it comes
[49:29] to the church Ahab had 400 voices that
[49:32] were leading him straight into death but
[49:34] he had to come back to that one true
[49:36] voice that would lead him in the truth
[49:38] and guide him in the path that God was
[49:40] trying to trying to take them because
[49:42] 400 voices amen though there be more
[49:45] more multitude did not necessarily mean
[49:48] more truth am man and when brother
[49:51] Brandon was even studying on the church
[49:53] ages he would say go back to the
[49:56] beginning he said if we're going to talk
[49:58] on the church age we've got to go back
[50:00] to the beginning laying aside every
[50:02] statement that any man has made down
[50:04] through the age you see it seems like it
[50:06] would make more sense sister Momo I I I
[50:09] if we got all the voices together and
[50:11] all the commentaries throughout all the
[50:12] ages that we would have a greater truth
[50:15] but you got to lay aside every other
[50:16] voice and go back to the beginning what
[50:18] was at the beginning what was the truth
[50:20] before the foundation of the world and
[50:22] how can we get to that truth except God
[50:24] would reveal it under the servants the
[50:26] prophets and just a few verses before
[50:29] that in Amos 3:3 says how can two walk
[50:31] together except they be degreed amen
[50:35] there's that false Unity that ecumenical
[50:37] move that rejects the word for
[50:39] Fellowship they'll reject the word
[50:41] they'll push Christ out for more
[50:43] Fellowship say we want our churches to
[50:45] come together whether Christ the word is
[50:47] involved or not but I can't walk with
[50:49] this message and your opinion at the
[50:51] same time I can't walk with this message
[50:53] and all the other opinions at at the
[50:55] same time but you got to come back to
[50:57] the plum line back to the lifeline that
[51:00] guy that'll lead you into all truth me
[51:03] but don't put it off into another
[51:05] another church don't say well he's just
[51:06] picking on these other brothers I can't
[51:08] walk with this message in my opinion at
[51:10] the same time that's what it comes down
[51:12] to You' got to come out of it friends
[51:15] come out of those mind battles you can't
[51:17] walk with those opinions in this word
[51:19] any longer if the word says you're
[51:21] healed and the devil says that you're
[51:22] never going to be healed you can't walk
[51:24] with those together you got to pick one
[51:27] you got to choose the word choose this
[51:29] day who you will serve and walk in it
[51:32] walk in that word amen lay aside every
[51:34] other way you can't walk with it and
[51:37] walk with this word how can two walk
[51:39] together except they be agreed man what
[51:41] are you going to walk with amen he said
[51:45] he said lay aside those
[51:48] things cast down that
[51:50] reasoning when brother Brandon when the
[51:52] Lord was leading to him in the new
[51:53] ministry he said you walk with too many
[51:56] to walk with me you'll walk alone a amen
[52:00] and see because you might have been born
[52:03] you might have been born in this message
[52:05] but when God called you out he didn't
[52:07] just call you out of the Baptist Church
[52:10] or the Methodist Church but it's calling
[52:12] you out of anything contrary to this
[52:15] word and you can sit in the message pure
[52:17] your whole life and in your mind you got
[52:20] another opinion going on you got a voice
[52:22] telling you that you're not going to
[52:23] make it you got a voice telling you that
[52:25] the Holy Ghost isn't for you you got a
[52:28] voice telling you that maybe this
[52:29] message isn't right or or all this
[52:31] confusion and you don't know what truth
[52:33] really is you say well the Pentecostals
[52:35] have life so maybe we're just like them
[52:37] but it's a devil and you can't walk with
[52:40] that in this message at the same time to
[52:42] walk with this word you'll have to walk
[52:44] alone you can't bring any other buddies
[52:46] along any other voice along you got to
[52:49] come back to that true voice oh to walk
[52:52] with this word you'll have to walk alone
[52:57] cast down reasoning God is calling
[52:59] individuals to stay with this word come
[53:02] out from among them he said you can't be
[53:05] married in The Invisible Union he's he's
[53:07] bringing together a picture of a
[53:09] marriage he said you can't be married to
[53:11] law and Grace at the same time you you
[53:14] can't be you're not the Bond woman and
[53:16] the free woman you're you you can only
[53:18] be under one you can't be under the law
[53:21] and the grace you can't be under legal
[53:24] and the truth
[53:26] you got to come back come out from among
[53:28] it me don't pick up that old nature
[53:31] anymore when that old nature is dead
[53:33] young people when God gives you an
[53:35] experience don't go back and pick up
[53:37] that old nature don't go back and try to
[53:39] dig him up and say well well I don't
[53:42] know if I can let go of those old mind
[53:44] battles I don't know if I can let go of
[53:46] that but you can come to a truth that'll
[53:49] set you free who you are where you came
[53:53] from where you're going me what does the
[53:56] Bible say about it what does the Bible
[53:58] say it this message is our freedom amen
[54:02] not all your thoughts not all your
[54:05] opinions uh are pure word not everything
[54:08] that goes on up here goes on in here and
[54:12] you got to come to a place where you can
[54:14] discern the two you see God might even
[54:16] put a gift in your life and you become
[54:18] scared of it because maybe maybe you're
[54:20] sensitive more to the Lord because
[54:22] there's a gift in your life to sing or
[54:23] to preach and you let become a fear to
[54:26] you because you yield that sensitivity
[54:28] to the devil and he's always able to
[54:30] plague your mind and he's always able to
[54:32] get you under worry but God put that in
[54:34] your life for a blessing and don't let
[54:36] the devil steal your blessing don't you
[54:38] can yield that sensitivity to the Lord
[54:40] and he can work through your life way
[54:42] you never thought possible and mean it's
[54:44] a lie the devil's tried to steal your
[54:46] joy when it was a true gift to begin
[54:48] with it was a true blessing to begin
[54:50] with it just matters what you yield
[54:52] yourself to amen come out of the fear
[54:55] come out of the confusion God didn't
[54:57] make you for that you were created for
[54:59] more than confusion you were created for
[55:02] more than fear and worry and unbelief
[55:04] the Deep calling to the deep is calling
[55:06] you out of those systems he said you're
[55:09] going to pass Esau's Mountain but that's
[55:11] not your inheritance but do you hear the
[55:13] trumpet calling you do you hear the
[55:15] Jubilee sound saying there's more for
[55:17] you there's more than that fear there's
[55:20] more than that worry come out from it
[55:22] you were created for more amen
[55:25] maybe sometimes you young man get a
[55:27] temptation to try to be a little bit
[55:29] more like the world because you'll fit
[55:31] in more others will like you more but
[55:33] that's a lie you were created for more
[55:35] than that you were created for this word
[55:38] you got an inheritance am man maybe the
[55:40] young sister think if she just cuts her
[55:42] hair or dresses a little bit tighter
[55:45] that that that that they'll like her
[55:46] more she'll fit in more but you were
[55:48] created for more than that you were
[55:50] created for more than than the the the
[55:52] Eye Of The Devil more than a spirit of
[55:55] Gossip more than a spirit of bitterness
[55:58] more than a spirit of heaviness more
[56:00] than a spirit of mourning you were
[56:02] created for a higher plane it's a change
[56:04] of rulership you're not under the
[56:06] rulership of man anymore you're not
[56:08] under the rulership of a church but you
[56:10] come under the rulership of God he'll
[56:13] give you the oil of Joy he'll give you
[56:15] the Garment of Praise he'll give you a
[56:18] blessing but you got to remember it's
[56:21] the oil of joy for mourning it's the
[56:23] Garment of Praise for this Spirit of
[56:25] heaviness what's that mean it means you
[56:27] can't wear them both at the same time
[56:29] you're not air with this world you're
[56:31] not a part of the church you're a part
[56:33] of the Bride amen I'm not trying to make
[56:35] it so loose that you can do whatever you
[56:36] want amen this is a freedom that belongs
[56:39] to the bride alone it's not for the
[56:41] church man your neighbor may not be able
[56:44] to experience that freedom but the bride
[56:46] is under a different Covenant it's an
[56:49] unconditional Covenant amen that you can
[56:52] walk with the Lord he'll lead you and
[56:54] guide you in all truth
[56:57] amen separate and enter into your
[57:01] inheritance he said you got to separate
[57:04] from the world to be unionized with God
[57:07] God has ordained that his people act
[57:09] different from the
[57:10] world and it's not just what when Moses
[57:14] passed through that country what what
[57:17] made Moses different was not just the
[57:20] anointing because balum sat there with
[57:22] with the anointing as well but brother
[57:25] Brandon would say that what made Moses
[57:26] different was his teaching was perfect
[57:28] he had spirit and Truth he was right in
[57:31] line with every word that laid in the
[57:34] hour that he lived in that's what
[57:36] separates you amen there's something in
[57:39] you that knows truth you know the sound
[57:42] of the Gospel trumpet God is calling you
[57:46] calling a people to a higher plane
[57:48] calling you to be that true
[57:50] bride what does it mean to be the true
[57:52] bride brother brandom these are just
[57:55] things he would say about that true
[57:56] bride says she has oil in her lamp she
[57:58] takes the word and brings forth word
[58:00] children she's a virgin WB bride unified
[58:03] with the word loyal to her mate she
[58:06] attracts God's attention by keeping the
[58:08] word she's elected out of every age she
[58:10] listens to the spirit she has no mind of
[58:13] her own but her mind is his will and his
[58:15] word she though rejected she's
[58:17] persecuted she's made fun of but she's
[58:19] elected predestinated and forn she came
[58:22] from the Eternal thoughts of God she's
[58:25] the spoken word seed bride that can't be
[58:27] denominated she's separated looking up
[58:30] and she's going in the Rapture and God
[58:32] will have a true bride that but it'll
[58:34] have to be going back to the beginning
[58:37] brother brand said this is the
[58:39] foundation cut off those Old Rag lines
[58:42] there so the life can get into you then
[58:44] you'll have prophecies you'll have
[58:45] discernment you'll have Spirit you'll
[58:47] have power you'll have the restoration
[58:50] of the true church when you get back to
[58:52] the True Vine and the true life amen
[58:56] from the beginning it was not so those
[58:59] those false teachings those Creeds those
[59:01] cold formal ritualistic they weren't so
[59:03] from the beginning it never was so so
[59:07] God's calling a church back to the
[59:08] beginning back to the power of God back
[59:11] to that True Vine that back to that
[59:14] another book of Acts that's written
[59:16] behind her I mean only this time it's
[59:18] not through Peter and through Paul but
[59:20] God's writing another book and you could
[59:22] read that book and it looks like the
[59:24] exact same actions all the same verbs
[59:27] they're still sick or being healed bound
[59:29] or being delivered lost or being saved
[59:31] but it's a different name this time it's
[59:33] the name of Aaron and it's the name of
[59:35] Samuel and it's the name of Nathaniel
[59:38] because God is writing another book
[59:40] through this New Testament Church but
[59:42] it's got to go back to the beginning
[59:45] back to what God set in order I mean
[59:47] you're God's taking you back to who you
[59:50] were in the beginning from the beginning
[59:52] you were a son from from the beginning
[59:55] you were Eternal from the beginning you
[59:57] were in the back part of the mind of God
[59:59] brother Taz from the beginning you were
[1:00:01] a gene of God from the beginning you
[1:00:03] were an attribute of almighty God God is
[1:00:05] taking you back as an individual to who
[1:00:07] you were and it's not just who you are
[1:00:09] all of a sudden it's who you were from
[1:00:11] the beginning it was so from the
[1:00:14] beginning you were a son from the
[1:00:15] beginning you were ordained for a
[1:00:17] Rapture from the beginning you were a
[1:00:19] child of God Amen from the beginning you
[1:00:22] were built to believe this message you
[1:00:24] see brother BR would talk about that gun
[1:00:27] and he put the wrong kind of bullet in
[1:00:29] the wrong gun and it wouldn't fired it
[1:00:31] off it wouldn't fire it off because from
[1:00:32] the beginning it was not built to fire
[1:00:34] that bullet and you maybe tried to fire
[1:00:37] all kinds of things through your life
[1:00:39] you tried to fire the world you tried to
[1:00:41] fire a black sliden life you tried to
[1:00:43] fire drugs and alcohol you tried to fire
[1:00:46] all kinds of things and every time it
[1:00:48] wouldn't go off and it might have even
[1:00:50] blown up a time or two and left you with
[1:00:51] a bunch of scars a scarred passed a
[1:00:54] scarred life because you were trying to
[1:00:56] fire the wrong bullet through the gun
[1:00:58] but one day the lord gave you another
[1:01:00] bullet he said if this one don't work
[1:01:02] I'm just going to take my life what's
[1:01:03] the point of living but you put the
[1:01:05] bullet in and you fired it off and it
[1:01:07] went off with perfect accuracy because
[1:01:09] that's what you were built to fire from
[1:01:11] the beginning that's what you were
[1:01:13] always built of fire anden you put this
[1:01:15] message on and it fit like a glove oh
[1:01:18] because that's who you were from the
[1:01:20] beginning you were never meant to fire
[1:01:23] you were never meant to fire those
[1:01:25] things God's called you out of it amen
[1:01:29] and when you're out of it that
[1:01:31] Taskmaster has no has no authority over
[1:01:34] your life right now you are sons of God
[1:01:38] right now you are you are sitting in
[1:01:41] Heavenly places amen and sometimes you
[1:01:44] can come out of that and the devil still
[1:01:47] has a right to whisper in your ear the
[1:01:49] devil still has a right to crack his
[1:01:51] Whip and so you think maybe something
[1:01:53] wasn't right maybe I never got the Holy
[1:01:55] Ghost maybe the devil tries to put that
[1:01:57] in your mind that you never got the Holy
[1:01:59] Ghost because you still hear that whip
[1:02:00] cracking but you don't realize that he
[1:02:02] can't get to you he's still cracking his
[1:02:04] whip but he has no right to your life he
[1:02:07] has no right to your joy he has no right
[1:02:09] to your peace he has no right to your
[1:02:12] inheritance because the Jubilee has
[1:02:14] sounded and you're free you are a son
[1:02:16] now you have a right to have authority
[1:02:19] over that devil and and discern it as a
[1:02:23] lie cuz he which the son is made free he
[1:02:26] is free indeed like that old Johnny crow
[1:02:30] that would walk around but one day go
[1:02:33] the farmer came and on tied him but he
[1:02:35] kept walking in circles because he
[1:02:37] thought maybe that that it was just the
[1:02:39] same old day just another day just
[1:02:41] another day tied to that old devil but
[1:02:44] what he didn't realize that he was free
[1:02:45] all
[1:02:46] along and you can walk in that devil
[1:02:49] that that that Devil's lie for day after
[1:02:51] day but when Christ came to Calvary he
[1:02:54] untied you and what would set you free
[1:02:57] tonight is to realize you're already
[1:02:59] free what would set you free is to
[1:03:01] realize what Christ did at Calvary to
[1:03:03] realize that you're a Son of God that he
[1:03:05] paid for your healing he paid for your
[1:03:08] deliverance a mean you you say how can I
[1:03:11] go free uh do I have to go on a 40-day
[1:03:14] fast or do I have to kneel down and do I
[1:03:16] have to do all these rituals but that he
[1:03:18] which the son is made free is free
[1:03:20] indeed and sometimes Sons and Daughters
[1:03:23] of God get into real traps and and
[1:03:25] sometimes there's real situations that
[1:03:27] need to be dealt with maybe through
[1:03:28] prayer or or maybe through repentance
[1:03:31] and things like that but sometimes you
[1:03:34] get in a trap and it's nothing but a lie
[1:03:36] and you live under that trap for years
[1:03:38] and years because you think that that's
[1:03:40] the truth over your life that you really
[1:03:42] are uh predestined for suicide you
[1:03:45] really are you really are just a foolish
[1:03:47] virgin you really are just nothing but
[1:03:50] but a devil but you don't realize that
[1:03:51] that's a lie that the devil has spoken
[1:03:53] over your life but if you could ever
[1:03:55] find out the truth about who you are
[1:03:57] that truth would set you free and you
[1:03:59] could walk out that very moment you see
[1:04:02] under that emanci Emancipation
[1:04:04] Proclamation they had to wait till the
[1:04:06] sun rose over the hill to realize that
[1:04:09] they could go free but brother random
[1:04:11] said that the time now is the time you
[1:04:13] believe that's the time you can go free
[1:04:16] amen there was a girl a sister one time
[1:04:19] that had a dream that she was walking in
[1:04:23] white sand but black clouds begin to
[1:04:25] roll over and she got to worry and
[1:04:28] what's wrong and her son I believe and
[1:04:32] daughter-in-law were involved in the
[1:04:33] dream and said brother brandom she would
[1:04:35] begin to discuss it with brother brand
[1:04:36] said our whole family's gone to into a
[1:04:38] nervousness our whole family is walking
[1:04:41] in this darkness and we don't know
[1:04:42] what's wrong and brother brandom could
[1:04:44] take them and he could just by a simple
[1:04:47] explanation say no the White Sands prove
[1:04:49] that you're walking in Purity and
[1:04:51] righteousness the only thing is you've
[1:04:53] let the devil get get in and make you
[1:04:54] nervous amen and from that point on they
[1:04:57] could walk out of that cage me isn't
[1:04:59] that right from that point on if you
[1:05:00] could ever figure out the truth that you
[1:05:02] really are free that God's not giving
[1:05:04] you the spirit of fear but of power and
[1:05:06] of love and of sound mind there's no
[1:05:08] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:05:10] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:05:12] after the spirit if you could ever
[1:05:14] figure out what the truth was about it
[1:05:16] you could go free amen if from that
[1:05:18] moment they could walk out is said one
[1:05:20] time there was a a sister going through
[1:05:22] menopause and they told her that she had
[1:05:25] five devils and one told her that she
[1:05:27] had seven devils and she just begin to
[1:05:30] degrade until her home was a mess she
[1:05:32] wouldn't even take care of her home
[1:05:34] anymore she couldn't even do the dishes
[1:05:36] anymore she was under such a nervousness
[1:05:38] that said I'm not going to eat until I
[1:05:39] figure out what's wrong me but when
[1:05:41] brother Brandon got to her he could tell
[1:05:44] her no sister it's just the time of life
[1:05:46] you're in it's not a devil at all and
[1:05:49] she can say well do you have to lay
[1:05:50] hands on me what can I do to get out of
[1:05:52] this she said no the TRU shall set you
[1:05:54] free it was never there to begin with
[1:05:57] you never had a devil on you to begin
[1:05:59] with it was just a lie it was just a
[1:06:01] black cloud of Oppression that was
[1:06:03] hanging over you but you didn't realize
[1:06:05] that the Sun was shining all along but
[1:06:08] one day the truth came by and rolled
[1:06:09] back the clouds and you saw who you were
[1:06:13] what you had a right
[1:06:15] to amen he which the son has made free
[1:06:18] is free indeed and the spirit of Truth
[1:06:22] is calling you calling you to
[1:06:25] calling you to be a prisoner not to the
[1:06:27] devil but you can be a prisoner to this
[1:06:30] message you can be a prisoner to this
[1:06:32] word am mean this is a Revival not just
[1:06:35] of feeling free this is a Revival of
[1:06:37] being free this is a Revival of being
[1:06:40] free and knowing that you're free the
[1:06:43] the you could go and you could you could
[1:06:44] dance and you shout and we believe in
[1:06:46] all those things but the next day you
[1:06:48] feel like you've just been hit by a
[1:06:50] truck and and you feel the weight of the
[1:06:53] world on your shoulder
[1:06:54] and you go right back to that same old
[1:06:56] cage but if you could change over from
[1:06:58] basing your victory over feeling free to
[1:07:01] basing your Victory to being free it'll
[1:07:03] change your walk it'll change your talk
[1:07:06] it'll change your testimony you'll no
[1:07:08] longer be wowy wowy woo you'll be I'm a
[1:07:10] Son of God today and I'm a Son of God
[1:07:12] tomorrow if I die today if I die
[1:07:15] tomorrow it doesn't matter to me at all
[1:07:17] for death has no victory over my life
[1:07:20] the grave has no sting and if the
[1:07:22] Rapture comes the spirit that dwells in
[1:07:24] me will lift me up why should I fear
[1:07:26] tomorrow why should I fear next week why
[1:07:29] should I fear what's going on around me
[1:07:32] when I'm under a Revival of being free
[1:07:34] knowing that I'm free knowing who I am
[1:07:38] knowing where my absolute lies it lies
[1:07:41] in Jesus Christ the word not just the
[1:07:43] letter but the revealed word that come
[1:07:45] into our age and showed us there is a
[1:07:48] path you can walk that you can live an
[1:07:51] overcoming
[1:07:52] life you got to walk it may be straight
[1:07:55] and narrow you may have to walk alone
[1:07:58] but if you just stay there may my prayer
[1:08:01] many times is Lord just take me by the
[1:08:04] hand and walk me through your word walk
[1:08:07] me through this message lord I can't
[1:08:09] understand it I have no ability of my
[1:08:11] own to understand it but Lord if you
[1:08:12] just take me by the hand I I you can
[1:08:15] lead me you can guide me why what's the
[1:08:19] evidence of the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:08:21] you could receive the message of the
[1:08:23] hour you could receive the word for your
[1:08:25] day but that ability to hear came from
[1:08:28] God and God alone because this Jubilee
[1:08:31] is for Sons this Jubilee isn't for
[1:08:34] servants why could you receive this word
[1:08:36] because you're a son how could you enter
[1:08:38] into this Jubilee because you had
[1:08:40] god-given hearing that before the
[1:08:42] foundation of the world you were
[1:08:43] ordained to hear this message amen it's
[1:08:46] not it's not speaking in tongues it's
[1:08:48] not even the fruits of the spirit the
[1:08:51] evidence is to receive the word because
[1:08:54] he'll send you a spirit of Truth and
[1:08:56] that Spirit of truth will lead you and
[1:08:58] guide you into all
[1:09:00] truth God is bringing the church back
[1:09:05] back to what it was in the beginning
[1:09:07] brother Brandon would say at the Harvest
[1:09:10] Time the seed is back to its original
[1:09:12] life back to the Bible and it must have
[1:09:16] all the word to be the seed which is why
[1:09:18] we needed Malachi 4 why we needed
[1:09:21] Revelation 10:7 because you couldn't be
[1:09:24] a true seed without a true word to bring
[1:09:26] you back to that original condition and
[1:09:29] that life that was in the tassel and the
[1:09:32] and all these things is gathering into
[1:09:33] the seed amen not just the gifts but the
[1:09:36] life of the gifts more than just the
[1:09:38] gift but the life of the tastle the life
[1:09:40] of the Methodist the life of the
[1:09:42] Pentecostals coming into that fullness
[1:09:45] that seed because brother brandom
[1:09:47] said he said at the end of the lean age
[1:09:52] just before Jesus came the church would
[1:09:54] go back to being a wheat seed bride
[1:09:57] while the tears would be harvested and
[1:09:58] burn in the Lake of Fire and he said the
[1:10:01] tears are already maturing fast under
[1:10:04] corrupt teachers who turn the people
[1:10:05] from the word but the wheat also must
[1:10:08] mature and to her God is sending the
[1:10:10] prophet messenger with the Vindicated
[1:10:12] mystery that Ministry that he might be
[1:10:15] accepted by the elect God will have a
[1:10:18] wheat seed bride God will have a bride
[1:10:22] God will have a true bride a true bride
[1:10:24] that is truly
[1:10:26] free me and he sent us the spirit of
[1:10:29] Truth to lead us into truth you see he
[1:10:32] didn't just call us out brother Seth out
[1:10:34] of the denominations but he said I'll
[1:10:36] give you a guide and who'll lead you
[1:10:38] into all truth you see that false Vine
[1:10:40] was saying that you got to come to us to
[1:10:43] hear it's hard to understand this word
[1:10:46] it's hard to understand these
[1:10:47] Revelations uh you come and we'll put a
[1:10:49] priest you see because brother Chris
[1:10:52] when they started teaching that Nic
[1:10:53] Doctrine he said it was it didn't go
[1:10:55] over good with some people because they
[1:10:57] had the ability to read and and they
[1:10:59] could say no that ain't right and so
[1:11:01] they had to try to kill all those off
[1:11:03] until they could form the religion that
[1:11:05] said no you got to come by us the priest
[1:11:07] can read the priest can understand it
[1:11:09] takes a special person to understand but
[1:11:11] God had a different plan for his bride
[1:11:13] he said I'll send you a guide I'll send
[1:11:16] you a spirit of Truth and he'll lead you
[1:11:18] into all truth man brother Brandon Tells
[1:11:21] a Story one time
[1:11:24] about being lost in the
[1:11:26] woods and he was on his honeymoon and he
[1:11:30] had it perfectly arranged that it was
[1:11:31] during hunting season and mean I I think
[1:11:35] maybe some of you would do that if you
[1:11:38] could I I I think brother Jeremy's is
[1:11:41] during elk season amen but but brother
[1:11:44] Brandon wasn't too upset about it and
[1:11:47] the Lord actually gave him that day
[1:11:49] anyhow but he was out in the woods and
[1:11:51] he said he said uh well why don't you
[1:11:54] stay here and I'll go get us some meat
[1:11:55] from the winter I I'll go get us a nice
[1:11:58] deer and and a nice bear and and you
[1:12:01] just stay here and she said all right
[1:12:02] but just remember I I'm not used to this
[1:12:04] Wilderness I I don't know what I'm doing
[1:12:06] out here and so brother Brandon said you
[1:12:08] know okay you know I'll be I'll be back
[1:12:10] by dark and things and so he goes out
[1:12:12] and he starts looking for a deer starts
[1:12:15] looking for a bear and he goes out and
[1:12:17] he sees a cougar and and he goes out and
[1:12:19] he he smells a bear and and all of a
[1:12:21] sudden he this black figure pops out and
[1:12:24] it was a deer and he kills it and he
[1:12:26] starts dressing it but all the while fog
[1:12:28] was starting to settle into the woods
[1:12:30] and it was starting to get a little
[1:12:31] darker he says so he thinks my I better
[1:12:34] get back to my to my wife and my baby uh
[1:12:37] they're back at home and they won't know
[1:12:38] what to do if it gets dark and it gets
[1:12:41] cold and so he starts walking back and
[1:12:43] he starts walking and he's walking for
[1:12:45] about 30 minutes 45 minutes and all of a
[1:12:48] sudden he looks up and there's his deer
[1:12:49] again he's like my what did I do wrong
[1:12:52] how did I end up back here and he
[1:12:54] started getting into what they call the
[1:12:56] Indian death walk walking in circles
[1:12:59] walking around and not really getting
[1:13:01] anywhere and he he goes and he walks
[1:13:03] again and he goes and walks again for
[1:13:05] another while and he sees his deer again
[1:13:07] and he thinks my what's wrong how did I
[1:13:09] end up here and so he starts saying well
[1:13:12] Bill you can't get lost you're you're
[1:13:15] you're the greatest Trapper there ever
[1:13:16] was you you're the son of an Indian and
[1:13:19] and you can't get lost and but all the
[1:13:21] while that subconscious was telling them
[1:13:23] that
[1:13:23] you're getting nervous you don't know
[1:13:25] your way back your wife are going to die
[1:13:27] tonight if you don't get there and he
[1:13:29] starts walking in circles and it starts
[1:13:31] getting darker and darker and he and all
[1:13:33] of a sudden he hears a voice speak out
[1:13:35] I'm a very present help in the time of
[1:13:37] trouble I I'm a very present help in the
[1:13:41] time of trouble and here he was walking
[1:13:43] in circles and and maybe sometimes you
[1:13:46] found yourself in that same spot the fog
[1:13:48] starts settling in and you find yourself
[1:13:51] in a confusion you're walking in circles
[1:13:54] you don't know who the real you is you
[1:13:57] think you're ordained for the message
[1:13:59] but there's another voice you're trying
[1:14:01] to serve the law and Grace at the same
[1:14:03] time but God is not the author of
[1:14:05] confusion there is a truth and you walk
[1:14:08] in circles wondering wondering if it's
[1:14:10] for you wondering if you're going to
[1:14:12] make it walking in that confusion but a
[1:14:15] voice spoke out I'm an everpresent help
[1:14:17] in the time of trouble and so he just
[1:14:20] began to walk and he begin to think oh
[1:14:22] my God this fog has settled in it's too
[1:14:25] late now I'll never be able to get back
[1:14:28] I'll never be able to get back to my
[1:14:29] family and so he kneels down and say
[1:14:31] Lord forgive me Lord forgive me for my
[1:14:34] pride thinking that I was somebody
[1:14:36] thinking that I was a Trapper thinking
[1:14:38] that I could make it back on my own Lord
[1:14:40] forgive me lead me the right way I won't
[1:14:43] be able to make it back without you Lord
[1:14:45] I need you to be my guide and he got up
[1:14:48] and he said all right I've got to be
[1:14:50] determined this is the way I'm going to
[1:14:51] walk and he starts walking that away and
[1:14:54] a hand reached out and laid on his
[1:14:55] shoulder brother Mike and turned him
[1:14:57] around and brother random said God
[1:14:59] cleared the fog back for six miles and
[1:15:01] he saw Hurricane Mountain and he started
[1:15:04] walking towards that mountain he didn't
[1:15:06] turn himself around in his own ability
[1:15:08] to guide he would have been in Canada
[1:15:10] somewhere but God put a hand on his
[1:15:12] shoulder a god rich in Mercy turned him
[1:15:15] around and said this is the way to walk
[1:15:17] it was that same hand that could come
[1:15:19] into the room before he went to preach
[1:15:21] the seals he said I wouldn't make a huge
[1:15:23] mistake today if God didn't come and
[1:15:25] meet me in my room and show me the truth
[1:15:27] of this it's the spirit of truth that's
[1:15:29] leading this bride it's not the ability
[1:15:31] of a man it's not the ability of you to
[1:15:34] overcome but God's planted a seed in
[1:15:36] your life and you can't be deceived
[1:15:38] because you're not a part of this Bond
[1:15:40] woman you're a part of this free woman
[1:15:43] God's putting you a jean seed to lead
[1:15:45] you into all truth and you're a virgin
[1:15:47] wom bride because God got to you before
[1:15:50] the devil ever could and sealed you
[1:15:53] sealed that womb to only receive this
[1:15:55] word seal that room till the only
[1:15:57] trumpet you could hear is this Jubilee
[1:15:59] trumpet that could declare unto you I'm
[1:16:02] free return return to your
[1:16:06] inheritance anden the elect cannot be
[1:16:09] deceived in your own ability you would
[1:16:11] have in your own ability how many times
[1:16:14] would we have got off these men that
[1:16:16] have preached for years if it was their
[1:16:18] ability they would have got off
[1:16:19] somewhere but it's more than their human
[1:16:21] ability it's the spirit of truth guiding
[1:16:23] their lies guiding them into Revelation
[1:16:26] guiding them into truth amen and all of
[1:16:30] a sudden that Spirit of Truth starts
[1:16:31] speaking out to you during this service
[1:16:34] and starts to dissolve your
[1:16:36] doubts amen have you ever been there
[1:16:39] where you're sitting in the right in the
[1:16:40] Pew and all of a sudden it's it's no
[1:16:43] longer just brother Wayne or Brother Ray
[1:16:45] it's another voice that's coming by your
[1:16:47] way and it begins to discern your heart
[1:16:50] and it begins to tell you that you don't
[1:16:52] have to be a slave to that fear you
[1:16:54] don't to be slaved to that depression
[1:16:55] any longer the spirit of Truth is
[1:16:58] concerned about this bride concerned
[1:17:00] about getting her home me we were
[1:17:02] sitting in the house the other day and
[1:17:05] our little baby was born with toric
[1:17:07] callus a crooked
[1:17:09] neck and a stiff neck and because of the
[1:17:11] way he would lay he was born with this
[1:17:13] anden and and I was worried about it but
[1:17:16] Bethany especially gets a real burden
[1:17:18] for the baby that's the mother gets a
[1:17:20] real burden for that baby and she was
[1:17:23] worried about that baby and she would do
[1:17:24] exercises with him but one day she's
[1:17:27] just sat down from cooking supper I
[1:17:29] think it was and turned on the prophet
[1:17:33] and he just starts going through the end
[1:17:35] of the service and he's just going
[1:17:37] through and all of a sudden he calls out
[1:17:39] you mother you got that baby with the
[1:17:41] crooked neck if you just believe he'll
[1:17:43] be healed anden it's more than the
[1:17:46] ability of a man it's the spirit of
[1:17:48] truth that's concerned about you
[1:17:51] concerned about where you're at
[1:17:53] concerned about that cage that you've
[1:17:55] been beating your head against for years
[1:17:56] and years that cage of condemnation that
[1:17:59] cage of fear amen come out from it that
[1:18:03] Spirit of Truth still brooding still
[1:18:07] speaking talking with brother Tyler
[1:18:10] Rachel earlier about a time he was
[1:18:12] sitting in his car and he was listening
[1:18:15] to that discernment line and he was
[1:18:17] having a back problem and all of a
[1:18:19] sudden brother brandom's just Discerning
[1:18:21] those situations and just discerns that
[1:18:23] back problem and and somebody in the
[1:18:25] line and he said that substance Faith
[1:18:27] just dropped down in his heart and he
[1:18:29] was instantly healed in that moment amen
[1:18:32] he hasn't left that guide has not left
[1:18:35] the church that Spirit of Truth is still
[1:18:38] here leading you into all truth leading
[1:18:41] you to the
[1:18:42] Millennium Hallelujah sons of God
[1:18:47] they're led by the spirit of God Amen
[1:18:50] and you're going to be marked yeah yeah
[1:18:53] you're going to be marked one way or
[1:18:55] another friends anden and those who did
[1:18:59] not receive that trumpet they were
[1:19:01] marked in their ear they were marked
[1:19:04] where they couldn't hear that word
[1:19:05] anymore they couldn't go free no more
[1:19:08] they that was the mark that went to
[1:19:10] those who would not hear that Jubilee
[1:19:11] trumpet but brother B said God marks his
[1:19:14] when they come God marks his by
[1:19:17] vindicating his promised word through
[1:19:18] them amen you'll either be marked in
[1:19:21] your ear never to hear again or you'll
[1:19:23] be marked for the Vindicated
[1:19:25] word couldn't hear the Glorious gospel
[1:19:27] no more but he said ours will brother B
[1:19:30] said these will be marked John 14:12
[1:19:33] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:19:35] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:19:37] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:19:39] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:19:42] father and me what is the father's
[1:19:44] business that this bride is about it's
[1:19:47] to vindicate the word vindicate Malachi
[1:19:50] 4 vindicate Revelations 101 107 you're
[1:19:54] about the father's
[1:19:56] business you say what is truth what is
[1:20:00] truth pilate asked that question one
[1:20:03] time amen Jesus said thou sayest I'm a
[1:20:06] king to this end was I born and for this
[1:20:08] cause came I into the world that I
[1:20:10] should bear witness unto the truth
[1:20:12] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:20:14] voice and pilate saith unto him what is
[1:20:17] truth and there the very truth was
[1:20:20] standing right in front of him the one
[1:20:23] that said I am the way the truth and the
[1:20:25] life not just the letter but the truth
[1:20:29] the word that was in the beginning was
[1:20:31] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:20:33] the Word was God and mean in The Book of
[1:20:36] Revelations he said these things sayth
[1:20:39] he that is Holy he that is true and so
[1:20:42] we find that the one was standing in
[1:20:44] front of pilate was a man of truth but
[1:20:47] brother BR said that word true it
[1:20:49] doesn't just mean opposite of false it
[1:20:52] means per perfect realization in
[1:20:54] contrast to partial realization standing
[1:20:57] right there in front of pilate was the
[1:20:59] one that when they spoke of the Bread of
[1:21:01] Heaven when they spoke of the Mana that
[1:21:03] would come down he was that Bread of
[1:21:05] Heaven when they spoke of the vine that
[1:21:07] would bring forth branches he was that
[1:21:09] vine when they spoke of one likened onto
[1:21:12] the prophet Moses he wasn't just a
[1:21:14] prophet he was the prophet he wasn't
[1:21:16] just one like unto David he was one
[1:21:19] greater than David he was the perfect
[1:21:21] realization of every scripture spoken
[1:21:23] over his life it wasn't just the truth
[1:21:25] that laid in the Scrolls the truth was
[1:21:27] standing there in flesh the perfect
[1:21:30] realization amen and people going about
[1:21:33] in this age today looking where is truth
[1:21:35] do the Methodist have it do the Baptist
[1:21:38] have it do the Pentecostals have it but
[1:21:40] I say I'm looking at it I'm looking at
[1:21:43] truth it's standing right in front of me
[1:21:46] God has took on flesh and brother bam
[1:21:48] said he this word was made flesh and it
[1:21:50] wants to be your flesh and mean you're
[1:21:52] not just a bride you're the bride it's
[1:21:55] the greater than Esther the greater than
[1:21:57] Sarah and Rebecca the one that fulfilled
[1:22:00] all these types is standing on the Earth
[1:22:03] today tabernacled in flesh it's the
[1:22:06] truth the perfect
[1:22:10] realization amen and this bride is
[1:22:12] free it's a free bride and we could
[1:22:15] spend all this time talking about the
[1:22:18] freedom of the Bride but if you can't
[1:22:21] determine whether not you're that bride
[1:22:24] then you'll stay in that cage you got to
[1:22:27] recognize who you are because although
[1:22:30] the bride is free you can still be an
[1:22:32] individual slave in your mind but the
[1:22:36] Bible said Paul told us be not entangled
[1:22:38] again with that yoke of
[1:22:40] bondage that yoke of fear you know you
[1:22:43] wake up afraid you go to bed afraid
[1:22:47] you're afraid you're going to miss the
[1:22:48] Rapture you're afraid you're not good
[1:22:51] enough afraid no one loves you afraid
[1:22:53] you're not good enough for this message
[1:22:55] afraid of death afraid of defeat afraid
[1:22:58] to claim your inheritance but God has
[1:23:01] not given you the spirit of fear but of
[1:23:03] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:23:07] and then that devil starts to put that
[1:23:09] condemnation on you because you felt a
[1:23:11] little fear and you think I'm I'm a holy
[1:23:13] ghost Christian I I shouldn't fear so it
[1:23:15] starts putting condemnation on you
[1:23:18] something's wrong with me and until you
[1:23:20] can't hardly pray you can't hardly talk
[1:23:22] to the Lord you're beating your head
[1:23:25] against that cage over and over again
[1:23:29] but you can come back to the truth come
[1:23:31] back to what the word says about it and
[1:23:34] there's no judgment to that Royal
[1:23:37] seedu a perfect blood that has perfectly
[1:23:40] loosed you and you're wondering about
[1:23:43] your future you see
[1:23:46] Sarah brother Wayne how could
[1:23:49] Sarah how could Sarah laugh in her heart
[1:23:51] at the promise promise how could Sarah
[1:23:54] in that condition yet God would choose
[1:23:57] her to bring that seed through because
[1:23:59] she was a part of Abraham look in
[1:24:02] brother brandom's meetings a a a Critic
[1:24:04] would rise up and half the time they'd
[1:24:06] have to pack him out or they'd walk out
[1:24:09] and be hit by a car but something in
[1:24:11] Sarah she was a part of Abraham and
[1:24:14] something in Paul Paul could go and
[1:24:16] persecute those Christians and God
[1:24:18] didn't strike them dead but God went and
[1:24:20] crowned his life to be the first
[1:24:23] messenger what was it it was under a
[1:24:25] different Covenant he wasn't under the
[1:24:28] law he wasn't under the bondage of Mount
[1:24:30] Si God was calling them to a different
[1:24:33] Covenant I've called you to be my
[1:24:35] messenger I've called you to be my bride
[1:24:38] amen and you worry about your future
[1:24:41] worry about where you're going to end up
[1:24:44] am I going to go to hell am I going to
[1:24:46] go am I going to go into all these these
[1:24:49] problems but can I tell you this if
[1:24:52] you're a part of that bride your future
[1:24:55] is wherever Jesus is there you will be
[1:24:58] also but will this bride going to Hades
[1:25:01] brother Brandon talks about it in the
[1:25:03] church age book I believe it is about
[1:25:05] how how how this bride won't go into
[1:25:07] Hades how could she go when she's been
[1:25:10] bought when she's been redeemed but your
[1:25:12] future is wherever Jesus is there I will
[1:25:15] be anden that'll bring a peace to your
[1:25:17] mind wherever Jesus is I will be also
[1:25:21] Hallelujah
[1:25:23] and then he said they will never come
[1:25:25] into con condemnation they will never be
[1:25:28] in that Lake of Fire they can never be
[1:25:31] lost for he will lose none of them not
[1:25:33] one of the redeemed will be anywhere
[1:25:35] except where Jesus is hallelujah amen
[1:25:38] it's what sets us free tonight it's the
[1:25:41] revealed truth that sets us
[1:25:43] free anden and you don't have to stay
[1:25:45] bound to lie
[1:25:48] anymore cuz from the beginning it was
[1:25:52] not not
[1:25:53] soj and and maybe I just read this quote
[1:25:56] as we bring it to a close brother Bon
[1:25:58] said do you believe that message is the
[1:26:00] truth do you believe it back to the
[1:26:02] beginning back to the beginning if
[1:26:05] somebody says I don't believe in Divine
[1:26:07] Healing you say it wasn't so from the
[1:26:09] beginning I don't believe in the baptism
[1:26:12] of the Holy Ghost it wasn't so from the
[1:26:13] beginning I don't believe in Divine
[1:26:15] Healing it wasn't so from the
[1:26:18] beginning for in the beginning they
[1:26:20] believed in the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:21] Ghost
[1:26:22] they believed in speaking with tongues
[1:26:24] they believed in all the spiritual gifts
[1:26:26] Paul wrote them in the book of
[1:26:27] Corinthians and set the church in order
[1:26:30] that's the way it was at the beginning
[1:26:32] that was the will of God at the
[1:26:33] beginning and he is the infinite God he
[1:26:36] cannot change if that was his will at
[1:26:38] the beginning that's his will tonight
[1:26:41] anything contrary to that is
[1:26:44] thieves anything contrary to that is a
[1:26:48] thief amen and that Thief goes about
[1:26:51] trying to steal
[1:26:52] trying to kill and trying to destroy he
[1:26:56] goes about like shamgar trying to steal
[1:27:00] all your joy trying to steal all your
[1:27:02] peace that thief's going about trying to
[1:27:04] steal it but the only way he could ever
[1:27:07] do it is through a lie the only way he
[1:27:10] could ever do it is by something that
[1:27:12] wasn't so from the beginning and he goes
[1:27:15] about and there Comes A Time in your
[1:27:17] life when you say I don't have to live
[1:27:19] under that anymore like shamgar could
[1:27:22] say I've got a right who is this
[1:27:25] uncircumcised Philistine anyhow when I'm
[1:27:27] a circumcised Son of God and
[1:27:30] I but when those thiefs would try to
[1:27:33] come in God would put it in a shepherd's
[1:27:36] heart to lay at the gate and guard those
[1:27:38] thieves from robbing those sheep and
[1:27:42] from stealing and killing and me and God
[1:27:44] could put it in a Shepherd's Heart like
[1:27:47] your pastor to stand at that door and
[1:27:49] preach the truth every service he could
[1:27:51] stand there and preach it and if he had
[1:27:53] his own ability if he could in his own
[1:27:56] ability come and open that cage to let
[1:27:58] you out he would how he would how it
[1:28:01] would burn in his heart just to be able
[1:28:03] to open that cage but God has God has
[1:28:06] ordained brother brand said you're an
[1:28:08] eagle in a cage and you're just as
[1:28:10] helpless as can be L somebody would come
[1:28:12] by and open the cage and brother B said
[1:28:14] God did that and calling you he opened
[1:28:17] the cage to let you out so all he can do
[1:28:20] stand up here and declare that word over
[1:28:22] your life stand up here and sound that
[1:28:24] trumpet over your life knowing that a
[1:28:27] true son will hear it and return to his
[1:28:30] inheritance amen but when God ordained
[1:28:32] this scripture and God put in there the
[1:28:35] truth of water baptism he put in there
[1:28:37] the truth of Pentecost he put Matthew to
[1:28:40] stand there as a guardian of that truth
[1:28:42] there stood Matthew with the truth of
[1:28:44] the Sacred baptism there stood Mark Luke
[1:28:47] and John guarding that Pentecostal truth
[1:28:50] that Pentecostal Church
[1:28:52] amen and it was the truth that's your
[1:28:55] guard that you got to let the truth be
[1:28:58] your guard amen the devil's going about
[1:29:00] like a thief but he's a liar but the
[1:29:04] truth is your guard that brother Wayne
[1:29:07] might not always be around but in your
[1:29:10] prayer closet all of a sudden that
[1:29:12] Spirit of Truth starts to settle in and
[1:29:15] brings to Rememberance those scriptures
[1:29:18] those quotes you start worrying well
[1:29:20] maybe I I'm not going to make it after
[1:29:22] all and then that Spirit of Truth just
[1:29:24] begins to settle over you you've already
[1:29:27] made it it's not if you're going to make
[1:29:29] it you've already made it and that truth
[1:29:32] just begins to guard you from that lie
[1:29:34] that tormenting spirit all of a sudden
[1:29:36] you just feel a different atmosphere to
[1:29:37] begin to settle in so that's right
[1:29:40] that's the truth about it I may not feel
[1:29:43] free right now but I know by the word I
[1:29:45] am free I know by the word I have a
[1:29:48] right to my inheritance as a son of God
[1:29:52] and then just abide there just abide in
[1:29:55] the truth if it don't happen today it'll
[1:29:59] happen tomorrow if it don't happen
[1:30:01] tomorrow it'll happen the next day
[1:30:04] because you are sons of Abraham you are
[1:30:08] the Seed of Abraham and it'll be a
[1:30:10] greater testimony tomorrow than it was
[1:30:13] today amen you that have been going
[1:30:15] through longlasting trials it'll be a
[1:30:17] greater testimony tomorrow than it was
[1:30:20] yesterday and you're the Seed of Abraham
[1:30:23] and so you just keep holding on to that
[1:30:25] truth holding on to that amen as the
[1:30:28] musicians
[1:30:31] come you may be in that cage
[1:30:34] tonight amen you may be in that cage
[1:30:38] that cage of
[1:30:40] confusion where you don't really know if
[1:30:43] it's for you or not you know that's a
[1:30:47] tough place to be where you hear about
[1:30:50] the millennium
[1:30:52] my you start listening about the future
[1:30:56] home and the
[1:30:58] greatest fear or bondage the devil try
[1:31:01] to put on you is that you're not going
[1:31:03] to be able to enjoy that you're not
[1:31:05] going to be able to partake in that and
[1:31:08] that would be the greatest fear because
[1:31:09] you know the the bride belongs to those
[1:31:13] things and you know that it's for the
[1:31:14] bride but the devil will try to keep you
[1:31:16] in that cage so that way you can't enjoy
[1:31:19] your salvation you can't enjoy your
[1:31:21] Liberty you can't enjoy your sound mind
[1:31:25] but God could come by and just in a
[1:31:28] moment that truth could just come and
[1:31:30] settle and open that cave that you could
[1:31:33] go free that cage of that cage of
[1:31:36] offense that that John found himself
[1:31:39] that one time Amen brother Carrie that
[1:31:41] eagle was in that cage God wasn't using
[1:31:44] them and so the devil started working on
[1:31:47] him and I remember you sharing some of
[1:31:49] those things with me but that cage of of
[1:31:51] offense here he was he introduced the
[1:31:55] Lord you know as a as a mighty God as
[1:31:57] the mighty coming of the Lord and here
[1:32:00] he was meek and lowly and there he is
[1:32:02] wondering in his cage have I believed on
[1:32:04] the wrong thing why hasn't it happened
[1:32:07] yet why are things taking so long and
[1:32:09] started to get into a cage of offense
[1:32:12] why why are we still here why hasn't
[1:32:15] these things come to a manifestation why
[1:32:17] hasn't the Rapture come yet why hasn't
[1:32:20] my prodigal come home yet why hasn't
[1:32:22] this happened why am I still sick it's a
[1:32:25] cage of offense that the devil will try
[1:32:28] to keep you in but if you just let the
[1:32:31] word lead say Lord You're my guide and
[1:32:36] Lord I'm just going to walk with you
[1:32:38] amen as long as he is here what doesn't
[1:32:42] matter anyhow it's being
[1:32:45] fulfilled right according to the
[1:32:47] symphony the word is beginning to beat
[1:32:50] those drums are are sounding
[1:32:52] everything's right in step your healing
[1:32:55] is Right In step your deliverance is
[1:32:58] Right In Step everything's right in
[1:33:00] order the coming of the Lord is right as
[1:33:03] it should be amen you can follow that L
[1:33:07] that that that Spirit of
[1:33:09] Truth and who'll Lead You amen who'll
[1:33:12] guide you amen amen I just was enjoying
[1:33:17] the prophet telling about that it was he
[1:33:21] it was he he up in Sabino
[1:33:23] Canyon it was he down at the river that
[1:33:25] day it was he it was he that spoke those
[1:33:29] things it was he that said Don't Fear to
[1:33:32] do anything for he'll be with you and
[1:33:36] and be strong and courageous and and all
[1:33:39] these great things that would begin to
[1:33:40] happen through brother Bron's Ministry
[1:33:42] how squirrels would be spoken not once
[1:33:45] but twice he said it was he it was he my
[1:33:50] I just begin to think on those things
[1:33:51] things how it was he it was he that
[1:33:55] brought you this far it's he that dwells
[1:33:58] inside of you it really has nothing to
[1:34:00] do with you God just picked up some
[1:34:02] flesh it's he that's in me it's he the
[1:34:06] spirit of truth that's leading us into
[1:34:08] all truth it's he that began the good
[1:34:10] work that'll finish it I mean it's he
[1:34:13] brother Ronnie that could lead you from
[1:34:14] Arizona to Ohio it's he that could take
[1:34:17] fear from my life it's he that could
[1:34:20] take depression from my wife's life it's
[1:34:23] he so why should I worry about tomorrow
[1:34:26] why should I worry about next week it's
[1:34:29] been he all along it's been that Spirit
[1:34:31] of Truth all along it was he that healed
[1:34:34] your body it was he that delivered you
[1:34:37] it was he that spoke to your heart and
[1:34:40] revealed this message to you it was been
[1:34:43] he all
[1:34:44] along and it'll be he it'll be he that
[1:34:47] finishes the work amen he the spirit of
