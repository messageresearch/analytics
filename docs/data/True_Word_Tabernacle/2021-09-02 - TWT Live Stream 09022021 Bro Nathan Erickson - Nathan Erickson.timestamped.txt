[31:15] amen how many are happy in the lord
[31:16] tonight praise the lord we've had a
[31:19] wonderful couple weeks

[31:28] amen with the things that he's doing in
[31:29] our midst god is so good amen we just
[31:32] want to remain in the channel tonight
[31:35] amen just a little simple thought in my
[31:36] heart tonight we'll just go directly to
[31:39] the
[31:39] word and let the lord have his way
[31:43] amen
[31:45] isaiah the 32nd chapter
[31:47] we'll just take the first two verses
[31:49] there and then we'll also take a verse
[31:51] out of proverbs 18.
[31:59] amen
[32:02] well i know we're missing a lot of the
[32:03] saints tonight how many are going to
[32:04] help me out tonight
[32:06] amen
[32:08] thank you i need it
[32:10] amen isaiah chapter 32 and the verse
[32:12] first two verses there
[32:15] the word says behold a king shall reign
[32:18] in righteousness
[32:19] and princes shall rule in judgment
[32:22] and a man shall be as a hiding place
[32:25] from the wind
[32:27] and a covert
[32:28] or shelter from the tempest
[32:31] as rivers of water in a dry place
[32:34] as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
[32:36] land
[32:38] proverbs 18
[32:40] and i think these words really resonate
[32:41] to the day that we're living in
[32:44] amen we are people in need of a shelter
[32:48] proverbs 18
[32:51] and the 10th verse
[32:56] the name of the lord
[32:58] is
[32:59] a strong tower
[33:01] and the righteous runeth into it
[33:04] and is safe
[33:06] and it's safe of course brother branham
[33:07] used these scriptures to preach letting
[33:10] off the pressure i've been studying
[33:12] those messages letting off the pressure
[33:14] as well i've been studying all three of
[33:16] the
[33:16] hidden life in christ
[33:18] sermons of brother branham preached and
[33:20] my title tonight is are you alive in
[33:23] there
[33:24] are you alive in there a question for us
[33:26] tonight let's just have a word of prayer
[33:28] heavenly father lord you look down upon
[33:31] us tonight father and see our inadequacy
[33:33] lord
[33:34] father just the just the hopelessness
[33:36] lord of human flesh
[33:38] lord to to make a refuge in this weary
[33:41] land lord for your people but oh god i
[33:43] thank you lord that you've given us a
[33:45] word father and you've given us a
[33:47] leadership lord and and lord although we
[33:50] don't maybe know always how to navigate
[33:52] our way through this world lord yet you
[33:53] know where the green pastures are father
[33:56] and you've been the shepherd of our
[33:57] lives father and given us a word lord
[34:00] that's able to lead us into the place
[34:02] father that we need to come where we can
[34:04] find safety father where we can find
[34:07] something that will satisfy our thirst
[34:09] oh god i pray lord that just in this
[34:11] moment for these few minutes lord as we
[34:14] labor to bring forth your word lord may
[34:16] your anointing come amongst this father
[34:18] may your spirit be free to move oh god
[34:20] that you may usher us into that place
[34:22] lord that we could join lord not just uh
[34:25] brother to brother sister to sister
[34:27] father but may we be joined with you in
[34:29] fellowship lord in that holy of holies
[34:32] father may we press beyond the crowd
[34:34] father and even in the lack of lord our
[34:37] our full numbers here tonight may we be
[34:39] shut in with god i pray and have a
[34:41] personal encounter lord with your
[34:43] presence that's our desire and that's
[34:45] our very dire need lord is for more of
[34:48] you father so lord as we just saying
[34:50] lord making a gesture of an uplifted
[34:52] hand father here's my cup lord and these
[34:55] people are raising their vessels to you
[34:57] father asking that you would fill us
[34:59] once again lord with your anointing with
[35:02] your spirit lord with your and pour your
[35:04] glories out once again in the name of
[35:06] the lord jesus christ amen amen amen god
[35:09] bless you they're seated tonight are you
[35:12] alive in there
[35:14] are you alive in there and just bear
[35:15] with me for a little bit uh uh just i
[35:18] want to i just want to share some things
[35:19] from my heart just to lay a foundation i
[35:21] just don't know quite how
[35:23] how uh how it's how it's meant to be put
[35:26] together but i'm just trusting in the
[35:27] lord tonight for the leadership amen
[35:30] thank you buddy
[35:31] amen but brother branham spoke preached
[35:33] the message of course letting off the
[35:34] pressure and it was a very relevant
[35:37] message for the time it was one of the
[35:38] last uh it was one of the the the in the
[35:42] last years of his ministry he was
[35:43] preaching this in the 1960s about a age
[35:46] of such a pressure in such a hurry and
[35:49] it's such a uh it's such a load and a
[35:52] burden that people are carrying and
[35:53] stress upon people and and people's
[35:55] minds failing and all the things that
[35:57] are prophetic of the age that we're
[35:59] living in and and of course i think that
[36:01] we could claim to say that we've seen an
[36:03] increase in those things that pressure
[36:05] has not gotten less it's gotten more
[36:08] there's more of a pressure today there's
[36:10] more of a load on the people of god and
[36:12] and and brother branham said uh had a
[36:15] quote there that i thought was quite
[36:16] powerful he said there's a pressure on
[36:18] the people today and that pressure has
[36:19] no limitation
[36:21] it has no limitation it has no
[36:23] denominational lines it's on everybody
[36:25] christian sinner uh no matter the person
[36:28] if you're a human being and you're
[36:29] living in this age you're under pressure
[36:32] it also he said it has no age line it
[36:34] has no respecter of persons it's on
[36:36] young and old it's on good and bad it's
[36:39] on everybody there's a pressure amen and
[36:41] brother branham is preaching these
[36:43] things to to to bring us to a
[36:45] recognition that we're living in satan's
[36:48] eden we're living in a world that's
[36:50] falling apart this this world is not a
[36:52] it's not a whole world or a healthy
[36:54] world or a or or or even a good world
[36:58] it's satan's eden and i think the the
[37:00] key takeaway from uh from that message
[37:02] of satan's eden that the the takeaway
[37:05] from these things is that we you and i
[37:06] need to realize that this world that
[37:08] we're living in was not built for us
[37:11] it was not built for you was not built
[37:12] for me or for my good or for my peace or
[37:14] for my joy it was built for satan for
[37:18] amen for the worship of satan amen for
[37:20] the pride of satan and the arrogance of
[37:22] satan that's what this this society that
[37:24] we're living in is satan's eat and it
[37:26] was not made with you in mind amen all
[37:29] of the pressures of this life this rat
[37:31] race that we're that we're going after
[37:33] and that's why people are miserable in
[37:35] their jobs and miserable in their work
[37:36] because they find no meaning in it they
[37:38] find that it's not contributing anything
[37:40] to the world it's not bringing any more
[37:42] goodness into the world but it's just
[37:44] feeding this great machine amen which is
[37:46] going away from god it's going away from
[37:49] from peace away from joy it's getting
[37:51] worse and worse and worse all the time
[37:54] amen and so this life that we're trying
[37:56] to live is not a life that was meant for
[37:58] us amen and i think there's actually a
[38:00] refuge in that for a christian because a
[38:03] lot of the troubles that we go through
[38:04] as christian especially as young people
[38:06] is we're trying to find in our life a
[38:09] way that we to make our christian life
[38:12] and
[38:13] and the life of of a christian boy or
[38:15] christian girl and trying to make that
[38:17] fit somehow with this world it will
[38:19] never fit amen because the world was not
[38:21] made for christians it was not made for
[38:23] the sons and daughters of god it was
[38:25] made for the devil amen it'll perish
[38:27] with the devil amen but oh my
[38:30] amen but there is a refuge
[38:32] you see it it's just such a deceitful
[38:34] world all of the measures of success of
[38:37] wealth and power and popularity and
[38:40] and all those things that that this
[38:42] world measures success by amen they hold
[38:45] no satisfaction
[38:46] the things that we truly desire even as
[38:48] human beings even biologically speaking
[38:51] those needs are not met by the successes
[38:53] of this world amen uh the way that
[38:56] society is run our our anti-social media
[38:59] is making relationships worse than it's
[39:01] ever been amen amen i i could say that
[39:04] as a technological statement amen that
[39:06] that social media and and the way that
[39:09] that that that society is conducted
[39:11] online today it was not engineered it
[39:13] was not created in a way to make
[39:15] meaningful relationships but that's not
[39:17] just a
[39:18] that's not just a technological
[39:20] statement it's a scriptural statement
[39:22] because the bible said the love of many
[39:23] shall wax cold amen that families would
[39:26] fall apart friendships would fall apart
[39:28] that people would become distant they
[39:30] would become cold that the love and
[39:32] fellowship in people's heart would begin
[39:34] to diminish amen and what a pressure
[39:36] it's bringing on people hey man
[39:39] but because of because of the way that
[39:41] we're meant to project our lives and on
[39:44] social medias and things then then it
[39:46] poisons all our affection with
[39:47] jealousies and and competition and well
[39:50] my life's better than you and i've got
[39:52] more of this or more of that and more to
[39:54] show off and and and all of it friends
[39:57] is putting a pressure on the people
[39:59] it's putting a great pressure it's
[40:01] poisoning everything amen amen we run to
[40:04] entertainments and things and and and
[40:07] and the majority of people in this world
[40:09] and in this society are addicted to
[40:10] entertainment because that's what it
[40:12] serves for entertainment is a drug young
[40:15] people and the purpose of entertainment
[40:17] amen is to dull your senses until you'll
[40:20] become satisfied with a lesser life and
[40:23] a lesser existence
[40:24] and the misery of a layout of seeing
[40:26] life amen not everything not all the
[40:28] devil's traps are to destroy you some of
[40:31] them are to make you settle for less
[40:33] amen for a lesser life for less peace
[40:36] less joy amen but just a little bit of
[40:39] an entertainment you can shoot in amen
[40:41] and and and get a little bit of enough
[40:43] of a buzz to get you through the night
[40:45] to get you to fall asleep amen to get
[40:47] you to go through that same cycle the
[40:49] next day
[40:50] amen
[40:51] all of it does is dulls the pain of a
[40:53] life without purpose without meaning
[40:55] that's why people are more miserable
[40:57] than they've ever been amen they're
[40:59] chasing after fashions and fads amen and
[41:02] things of this world
[41:03] amen and and that's and fashion makes a
[41:06] promise it promises that if you conform
[41:08] to the fashions of this world then you
[41:10] will receive acceptance amen so you must
[41:13] chase after a fashion amen you must buy
[41:15] it you must dress a certain way you must
[41:17] watch a certain movie and you've got to
[41:19] be in on a certain joke or something and
[41:21] then you'll be accepted for a time and
[41:23] then it'll move on and you've got to
[41:25] chase it and chase it and chase it and
[41:28] amen until we become a society of
[41:31] consumption
[41:32] amen we consume and we consume and we
[41:35] just devour and devour and we spend and
[41:38] we spend
[41:39] and we're never allowed to stop
[41:42] and we never we never are able to
[41:44] purchase what our heart is longing for
[41:47] amen satisfaction never comes friends
[41:51] amen it's a it's satan's eden
[41:53] and so it's brought a pressure on the
[41:55] people until we have a society that has
[41:58] more wealth than it's ever had before
[42:00] it's more healthy than it ever has been
[42:02] before it's got more pleasures than
[42:04] we've ever had before more comforts like
[42:06] we ever had and on the inside people are
[42:09] dead
[42:11] dead on the inside
[42:13] but in christ
[42:15] is promised life
[42:17] life is in jesus christ
[42:20] life is in christ
[42:22] in this world is no shelter
[42:24] there's no home coming there's no
[42:27] satisfaction there's no rest but in
[42:29] christ
[42:30] he is a strong tower friends the bible
[42:33] says he's a shelter he is a refuge he is
[42:36] a place where you can run and you can
[42:38] find your rest when the world and the
[42:40] environments of the world are not giving
[42:42] you what you are needing there is a
[42:44] shelter amen if there's a thirst then
[42:46] there is a there is a brook amen in dry
[42:49] land
[42:51] hallelujah shelter in jesus christ
[42:53] excuse me for a moment
[42:58] now
[42:59] what does it mean for him to be a
[43:00] shelter
[43:02] for him to be your shelter
[43:04] means that the world
[43:06] you're on the inside
[43:08] and the world is on the outside
[43:11] if you're in a shelter if you truly if
[43:13] if you're in christ
[43:15] scripturally speaking then you're on the
[43:17] inside and the world is on the outside
[43:20] and christ becomes a barrier
[43:23] not only a barrier but actually a
[43:24] defense between you and the outside
[43:27] world
[43:28] amen and we were sharing with the young
[43:30] people there at the camp how we're
[43:31] living in a day when these cold layout
[43:33] of seeing winds are blowing it's a it's
[43:36] a cold age there's storms in this world
[43:38] amen and we could liken it to a to a
[43:40] great storm that's come and it's blowing
[43:43] cold winds over the whole earth and
[43:45] everyone everyone is becoming cold
[43:47] they're becoming lukewarm the love of
[43:49] many is waxing cold amen in these cold
[43:52] layouts seeing winds and what those
[43:54] winds are influences
[43:56] amen because it's an age of many voices
[43:58] it's a it's an age of many uniters and
[44:00] many causes and many many gatherers and
[44:03] and these winds these cold winds are
[44:05] blowing trying to bring an influence on
[44:07] the people amen trying to expose our
[44:09] young people to to some ideas or or to
[44:12] some lifestyle or or something of this
[44:15] world which will not ultimately satisfy
[44:17] them
[44:18] amen and we find that there that any any
[44:21] any you brothers that that you like to
[44:23] be you're an outdoorsman you know that
[44:25] when you get out uh if you're a
[44:26] survivalist and you get out in the
[44:28] wilderness one of the biggest dangers
[44:31] for you is exposure
[44:33] it would be to be out in this world with
[44:35] no control over the temperature no
[44:38] control over the wind or the weather or
[44:39] the rain
[44:40] and and so you're exposed amen
[44:43] and without a shelter
[44:45] then you could die to the exposure
[44:48] and i tell you there's only one way
[44:50] for our young people for our old ones
[44:52] there's only way in this age of
[44:53] influence in this age of a pressure the
[44:56] age where satan's agenda is being
[44:58] preached to us over every pulpit over
[45:00] every platform every second of every day
[45:03] amen
[45:04] there's only one way to survive the
[45:06] exposure
[45:07] and that's to get in this shelter
[45:10] amen
[45:11] when we see the world when we see these
[45:13] voices trying to unite the world as the
[45:14] scripture said there would be two
[45:16] unities in the in the end time there
[45:18] would be a uniting of the tares and the
[45:20] uniting of the seed amen and all these
[45:22] voices are trying to unite and brother
[45:25] bran said they'll even quote scripture
[45:26] trying to unite the people they said
[45:28] well jesus said we should all be one
[45:30] brother brahm said not that kind of one
[45:32] the kind of unity that you're looking
[45:33] for the shelter that you're needing amen
[45:36] is just like jesus said i and my father
[45:39] are one i'm in them
[45:42] and they are in me
[45:44] in this shelter shut in with god the
[45:47] world is shut out we're not part of this
[45:50] world we're not trying to fit in with
[45:51] this world we're not trying to find
[45:53] peace in this world
[45:56] but we are in christ brother braham said
[45:58] what a beautiful picture it is today
[46:00] hidden life in christ of a consecrated
[46:02] life once they enter into christ they're
[46:04] dead to the things of the world hid away
[46:06] with god and the veil drops around and
[46:08] all the world shut off then christianity
[46:11] and religion becomes a pleasure
[46:14] to every believer now this is quite
[46:16] powerful now check your life by this
[46:19] amen today people have just enough
[46:21] religion to make them miserable
[46:24] isn't that a true statement just enough
[46:26] religion to make them miserable knowing
[46:28] that they ought to do this but they're
[46:30] just trying to escape hell
[46:32] he said well if that's the way i felt
[46:33] about it brother i don't know what i
[46:35] would do to think about that just enough
[46:37] religion to make you miserable we got
[46:39] plenty of that kind of religion around
[46:41] this message brother sister amen that
[46:43] spirit is just as alive and messes
[46:44] churches as in any denomination amen
[46:47] just enough religion to dress the part
[46:49] to swap the quotes amen sing the songs
[46:52] quote the scriptures attend the meetings
[46:54] but brother branstad are we getting
[46:55] people to christ are we just getting
[46:57] them to the church amen well how will
[47:00] you know if you found christ or if you
[47:02] just found religion when you've got a
[47:04] hidden life with christ nobody else is
[47:07] in there with you but you're in that
[47:10] shelter amen it doesn't matter what the
[47:12] crowd does it doesn't matter what the
[47:14] church does doesn't matter what your
[47:16] friends are doing or the life that
[47:18] they're going after or the standards
[47:20] that they're holding you are shut in
[47:22] with christ
[47:23] and nobody exists in that place but you
[47:25] and god
[47:27] and you found a personal fellowship with
[47:29] christ it's just you and the shekinah
[47:31] glory and nobody else figures into it
[47:35] hallelujah that's what we need friends
[47:37] we need to get in there
[47:39] into that shelter oh my and then you'll
[47:41] be alive then you want to be dead inside
[47:44] like these miserable zombies of this
[47:46] world amen but you'll be alive in christ
[47:49] shut in with god in a shelter where the
[47:51] cold winds of laodicea can't touch you
[47:54] they can't destabilize you
[47:56] they can't hook you on satan's gospel
[48:00] you're shut in with god having therefore
[48:02] brethren boldness to enter into that
[48:04] holiest
[48:05] by the blood of jesus a new
[48:08] and living way
[48:09] through the veil
[48:11] through the veil that's where we got to
[48:12] get to we got to press through the veil
[48:15] and meet god
[48:17] and nothing else no other substitute
[48:19] will will suffice friends oh brother
[48:21] brahm said get in with christ
[48:23] shut off from the things of the world to
[48:25] commune with him is a pleasure
[48:28] to commune with him is a pleasure amen
[48:31] if you got just enough religion to make
[48:33] you miserable
[48:34] amen what the problem is we lose a lot
[48:36] of our young people we lose a lot of
[48:37] people out of the churches because they
[48:38] get just enough religion to make them
[48:40] miserable and then they decide for
[48:42] themselves that it'll be easier to
[48:43] believe that there's nothing more to it
[48:45] that everybody's just as miserable as
[48:47] they are and that that religion is just
[48:49] as bad for for everyone else as it is
[48:51] for them and everybody's playing a
[48:53] hypocrisy friends can i get a witness
[48:55] tonight of somebody who's been shutting
[48:57] with god amen and you know the pleasures
[49:00] amen the pleasures the the glories the
[49:03] joy a day in his presence is better than
[49:06] a thousand elsewhere
[49:08] hallelujah friends don't ever let the
[49:10] devil make you believe that this kind of
[49:12] a life is not available to every son and
[49:15] daughter of god
[49:16] there is a veil that as the way has been
[49:18] made the veil was torn to you and i
[49:20] could boldly enter in there
[49:23] into a life that goes beyond a lifestyle
[49:26] beyond a religion
[49:28] and you're living in there with christ
[49:30] and you're alive and your heart is alive
[49:33] and quickened and full of life
[49:35] brother branham said to commune with him
[49:37] as a pleasure
[49:38] it's beautiful it's something that fills
[49:40] and satisfies the soul something that
[49:42] gives you peace that passes all
[49:44] understanding all the crosses become
[49:46] flying wings
[49:48] all the burdens are chariot wheels oh
[49:50] you can fly away my burdens are light he
[49:52] said yoke up with him and the yoke is
[49:54] all padded with hallelujahs
[49:56] amen when you're inside the veil with
[49:58] him he becomes your life
[50:02] he becomes your life just like aaron's
[50:04] rod a dead branch when it goes in that
[50:06] presence it bears fruit
[50:08] it brings forth life
[50:10] amen and that's where our fruit comes
[50:12] from that's where the supernatural comes
[50:14] from that's where signs and wonders come
[50:16] from the fruits of the spirit come from
[50:19] a a believer who has gone beyond the
[50:21] church pressed through that veil and
[50:24] they're fellowshipping in there
[50:26] in the shekinah with god
[50:28] amen and the reason our churches aren't
[50:30] bearing fruit is because they're not
[50:31] dwelling in the mach in the shekinah
[50:34] amen
[50:35] now brother brahms spoke about the three
[50:37] courts of the temple and i i i'm gonna
[50:39] gloss over some of these things i know
[50:40] we're educated in these things but how
[50:42] the temple had three courts representing
[50:44] justification sanctification and then
[50:47] the baptism of the holy ghost takes you
[50:49] into the holy of holies right
[50:51] amen but but uh but in that there was an
[50:53] inner court brother braham said of
[50:55] sanctification and he said in that in
[50:57] that inner court they had light
[50:59] there is a light to sanctification
[51:00] sanctification would be let's call it
[51:02] churchianity
[51:04] i think that's a i think that word has a
[51:06] meaning to all of us but in in that in
[51:08] that in that court there's light but
[51:10] brother brown said it was an artificial
[51:12] light and this really struck me here he
[51:14] said in there they had a seven point
[51:16] lamp
[51:18] you know the candlesticks they're spoken
[51:19] of the scripture they had a seven-point
[51:21] lamp that would give them light but he
[51:22] said sometimes those lights got low
[51:25] sometimes they got smoked up amen
[51:27] sometimes see friends amen we know all
[51:30] about seven church ages
[51:32] i know we got people in our ranks that
[51:34] they can they can draw out all the
[51:36] diagrams they can explain the seven
[51:37] church ages they got their candlesticks
[51:40] all right they got all the everything
[51:41] everything's just right the only thing
[51:44] that's missing is amen something when it
[51:46] gets all smoked up that'll keep that
[51:48] fire burning amen because it's an
[51:50] artificial light it's a man-made light
[51:53] and so ultimately it will be
[51:55] extinguished amen and so that's where
[51:57] people get in the cycle of a christian
[51:59] life save one day and backslid in the
[52:01] next and one day your confession is
[52:03] you're a believer and the next day
[52:04] you're lost amen but in that cycle
[52:07] that's sanctification brother there's a
[52:09] deeper life in christ there's an inner
[52:12] court there's a holy of holies amen and
[52:15] so and in that holy of holies it becomes
[52:18] not what you know
[52:19] and now what you've been educated not
[52:21] the church that you belong to or the
[52:22] doctrines that you hold to be true
[52:25] amen but it's a it it's going from an
[52:28] artificial life to the shekinah light
[52:30] amen amen well we could talk about
[52:32] doctrines and we can talk about all the
[52:34] reformations of the church ages and and
[52:36] and and we could we can go through all
[52:38] the lights of those seven candlesticks
[52:40] and every single one of them is an
[52:42] artificial light amen living in the
[52:44] glare of a past ages
[52:46] amen living in the glare of doctrines
[52:49] and and and head knowledge and
[52:51] intellectual understandings amen you see
[52:53] you can fellowship in that inner court
[52:56] but you and and all your candlesticks
[52:58] arrange just writing all your diagrams
[53:00] drawn and quote all the quotes
[53:03] and be artificial but i believe god
[53:06] didn't send a prophet to educate us
[53:07] about seven church ages
[53:09] but i believe god sent a prophet to
[53:11] usher us into a bride age and what that
[53:13] means to me is to go beyond amen the
[53:16] artificial light of just being a
[53:19] quote-unquote message believer a quote
[53:21] quote message believer amen but you've
[53:24] gone past the veil and you've met the
[53:26] present jesus christ that this message
[53:29] is testifying of his presence this
[53:31] message came to forerun amen a
[53:34] restoration of the abiding presence of
[53:36] the shekinah glory the very zoe life of
[53:39] christ in you christ in you
[53:43] amen
[53:45] and it's real
[53:47] oh you think i'm content to live in a
[53:49] layout i see in existence friends i'm
[53:50] not trying to eke out a life in this
[53:52] world i'm trying to get in that little
[53:54] room amen i'm trying to get me i'm
[53:56] trying to get i i believe i'm part of
[53:58] that tent vision amen you know where i'm
[54:01] in abraham's tent waiting for this
[54:02] promised son i'm in that holy of holies
[54:05] beyond the veil and nobody can enter in
[54:07] there amen and drag me out because it's
[54:09] death tanner in there not the not satan
[54:12] himself can't drag me out
[54:14] because i'm shut in with god
[54:18] i've been called out of of an age of
[54:20] laodicea and i'm in a bright age amen in
[54:24] fellowship with my redeemer
[54:27] with my bridegroom
[54:29] oh friends brother said the man who
[54:32] entered in that veil fell behind him he
[54:34] didn't depend on the sunlight the
[54:35] starlight the moonlight or the seven
[54:37] golden candlesticks the shekinah glory
[54:40] of the lord was in there and he lived
[54:43] amen whether clouds were going on
[54:45] whether the rain was falling thunder
[54:47] rolling whether an army was coming it
[54:49] didn't mean a bit of difference to him
[54:51] he was protected he was in the shekinah
[54:54] glory
[54:55] living in the presence of god hallelujah
[54:57] brother branstad now he said you think
[54:59] i'm a holy roller maybe i am let me tell
[55:02] you something brother if it takes a call
[55:04] to a holy roller to live in the shekinah
[55:06] glory let me stay with god in the
[55:08] shekinah glory call it what you want to
[55:10] friends amen now we're getting into the
[55:12] burning of my heart for this message
[55:14] tonight i would rather be a whooping
[55:16] hollering fanatic to this world and know
[55:18] that i've got something real then have
[55:20] all of my candlesticks polished and all
[55:23] of my quotes right and all of my
[55:24] doctrines figured out and all of my
[55:26] constellations name and living
[55:28] artificial life
[55:30] i'm looking for a reality
[55:33] i don't mean shouting with the crowd i
[55:34] mean shut in with god where the glories
[55:37] of the lord are
[55:38] raining down
[55:40] that kind of a holy ghost
[55:42] amen that don't go out it don't get it's
[55:44] not extinguished it never goes
[55:46] stale a manna
[55:51] brother bran said no matter how much you
[55:52] shout or try to do if you haven't got a
[55:54] life that your neighbor knows you're a
[55:55] christian there's something wrong
[55:56] somewhere amen see we know these things
[56:00] but he said there's nobody in the world
[56:03] who believes in any old time of old
[56:05] times shouting and blessing and praising
[56:08] god then i do
[56:09] oh hallelujah brother man said i believe
[56:11] a baby that's born in it don't move it
[56:13] don't whimper it don't do nothing he
[56:15] said you know what a doctor does he
[56:17] picks that stillborn baby up and he said
[56:19] he gives it us good spanking amen until
[56:22] it gets to whining and crying to show
[56:25] that it's got some life into it friends
[56:27] i think in this lukewarm age it's all
[56:29] right to have a little fiery preaching
[56:31] amen that'll smack that spiritual
[56:33] deadness out of the people amen and
[56:36] bring a stillborn child to life
[56:39] amen then we would have less of this
[56:41] artificial laodicean so-called message
[56:44] believing that's just a bunch of quote
[56:46] quoting and no life to back it up no
[56:48] supernatural no signs and wonders no
[56:51] realities of his presence
[56:53] no pillar fire moving in the meetings
[56:56] friends give me a reality
[56:58] letting off the pressure that's why we
[57:00] need friends brother brown said when you
[57:02] get in that tower when you get in that
[57:03] holy place then you can let off some
[57:05] steam amen that's why we get a little
[57:08] noisy sometimes in the church of the
[57:09] living god amen it's because you've got
[57:11] people that are under such a pressure of
[57:13] this age amen but to get in the presence
[57:16] of god where that valve gets released
[57:18] friends we got a little steam to blow
[57:20] off
[57:21] we got a little pressure to let loose
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:25] amen
[57:27] it's because it's a refuge it's a
[57:29] release it's a rest it's
[57:31] oh it's a hiding place you can let off
[57:34] that steam
[57:35] let off that stress that pressure it's
[57:38] joy to worship god it's a joy
[57:41] amen
[57:43] to have a shout in the camp
[57:45] amen we had a little testimony that was
[57:46] really dear to my heart it really meant
[57:48] a lot to me one of the young men that
[57:50] came to the youth camp the guerrilla
[57:51] went back to his uh to his home church
[57:53] and he said in the in those meetings you
[57:55] know the young people were shouting and
[57:57] dancing and there was a lot of that
[57:58] going on amen which i thought was
[58:00] wonderful amen and uh and uh and so this
[58:03] young man testified and he made a
[58:05] confession he said i was sitting there i
[58:07] was a critic
[58:08] and i liked the way that he explained
[58:10] how it was he said i was watching this
[58:12] one i'm watching that one i was saying
[58:14] is that right
[58:15] is that right
[58:16] is that right and i like the phrase that
[58:18] used for it he said i was micromanaging
[58:20] god
[58:21] until god couldn't move unless i was
[58:23] controlling it
[58:24] god couldn't do anything for somebody
[58:26] unless i was involved and keep a damper
[58:28] on the situation friends amen amen he
[58:31] said you know he said he was dealing
[58:33] with that amen
[58:34] trying to control how everyone else was
[58:36] being affected but he said you know it
[58:38] was wonderful how brother timothy there
[58:40] on sunday morning spoke something to him
[58:43] he said it spoke directly to his heart
[58:45] through the preaching of the word and
[58:47] loosed him for that and he said the next
[58:48] thing i knew i was out there dancing
[58:50] with them glory to god friends amen when
[58:53] you've gone past the veil it doesn't
[58:55] matter what anybody else thinks it
[58:57] doesn't matter what anybody else is
[58:59] doing nobody else is in there with you
[59:02] that's how you know if you've got a
[59:03] critical spirit if you're really shut in
[59:05] with god if you're shutting with god
[59:06] you're not watching everybody else
[59:09] and you're not thinking about what
[59:10] everyone else thanks to you it's you and
[59:12] god in a reality of a fellowship
[59:15] and then you can get a little excited
[59:17] and you don't have to worry
[59:19] you don't have to think about it friends
[59:21] glory be to god they can criticize or
[59:23] not criticize they can shout or not
[59:24] shout they can dance or not dance they
[59:26] don't make any difference to the
[59:27] believer
[59:29] because he's he's in there
[59:31] oh are you alive in there
[59:34] are you alive in there friends when we
[59:36] come to when we come to church and we
[59:38] hear the preaching of the word and god
[59:39] begins to move amongst his people people
[59:41] begin excited people's lives are being
[59:44] touched amen are you alive in that
[59:46] presence or are you sitting out in that
[59:48] outer court watching everybody else
[59:50] sitting there in your sanctified
[59:52] self-righteous religion and looking at
[59:55] everybody else you're not supposed to be
[59:56] in that court you're not supposed to be
[59:58] out there in the public you're supposed
[1:00:00] to be shut in with god
[1:00:06] hallelujah
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:08] when that lame man brother josh was
[1:00:10] preaching about was leaping and dancing
[1:00:12] and whooping and hollering and carrying
[1:00:14] on at the gate beautiful amen anybody
[1:00:16] passing by might have looked at him and
[1:00:18] thought well he just get a little
[1:00:19] emotional he's just got in his flesh a
[1:00:21] little bit friends they would have
[1:00:23] thought that if they hadn't seen him the
[1:00:25] day before but anybody who saw him the
[1:00:27] day before they would understand why uh
[1:00:30] a man that was lame could leap and shout
[1:00:33] and dance for joy friend if you don't
[1:00:35] understand why i get a little noisy to
[1:00:38] worship my god
[1:00:39] you might have been there amen when he
[1:00:41] lifted me out of where i was in amen you
[1:00:44] weren't there amen when he took me out
[1:00:46] of a fake religion
[1:00:48] and brought me into that holy of holies
[1:00:51] you don't know about it
[1:00:54] oh but you could find out hallelujah
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:59] back in that old tabernacle outside of
[1:01:00] that tabernacle the man would fall
[1:01:03] oh yeah they'd have camp meetings they'd
[1:01:04] have outpourings they'd have movings and
[1:01:07] dancings and rejoicings and they had
[1:01:09] experiences they had manna
[1:01:12] amen well after a while that man would
[1:01:13] go stale
[1:01:15] brother brown said that's some trouble
[1:01:17] he actually talked about camp meetings
[1:01:18] he said that's trouble with can with
[1:01:20] people they just get a camp meeting
[1:01:22] experience and they didn't get past the
[1:01:23] veil
[1:01:24] right but
[1:01:25] but friends he didn't throw out the camp
[1:01:27] meeting all right
[1:01:29] amen but you see because the outside
[1:01:32] that manna was always falling the
[1:01:33] blessings were being poured out but on
[1:01:35] the inside in that holy of holies there
[1:01:37] was a golden pot and the manna in there
[1:01:40] never went stale
[1:01:42] it never went bad over the centuries
[1:01:44] friends that that that that experience
[1:01:47] that manna brother brand said that's the
[1:01:49] holy ghost he said in that holy ghost
[1:01:51] that's in there in a in a hidden life in
[1:01:53] christ he said it never goes oh it never
[1:01:57] runs out
[1:01:58] it's just as fresh every day
[1:02:01] oh friends brother bram said and we
[1:02:03] don't have brother bran said we don't
[1:02:04] have to get some kind of emotional or
[1:02:05] mental makeup he said we can get not
[1:02:07] only a mouthful but we can get a soulful
[1:02:11] of the original baptism of the holy
[1:02:13] ghost that fell on the day of pentecost
[1:02:16] and it'll bring the same results as it
[1:02:18] did
[1:02:19] on the day of pentecost see some
[1:02:22] some people's shout doesn't hold but
[1:02:23] that doesn't mean it wasn't manna
[1:02:25] friends i i really want so i really want
[1:02:27] you to get this tonight it was manna
[1:02:30] it strengthened them for the season
[1:02:33] now if it didn't hold out that don't
[1:02:35] mean it wasn't a real blessing from the
[1:02:37] lord the thing about it is let that
[1:02:39] strengthen you to get in where the man
[1:02:42] is always fresh
[1:02:43] oh gloria you see this means a lot to me
[1:02:46] because this is a personal experience
[1:02:47] friends you say well some of those young
[1:02:49] people they were just caught up in
[1:02:50] emotion they were just saw well what in
[1:02:52] the world is wrong with that
[1:02:54] friends i would rather our young people
[1:02:56] get caught up in the joy of the lord
[1:02:58] than be caught up in depression or
[1:03:00] caught up in drugs or caught up in this
[1:03:02] miserable old world let him escape for a
[1:03:05] moment
[1:03:06] you see i'm a young person i shouted in
[1:03:09] a lot of services before i got the holy
[1:03:11] ghost but i'm so glad for the manna that
[1:03:13] got me to the ark
[1:03:15] i'm so glad that i didn't go home
[1:03:17] thinking well there's nothing to these
[1:03:18] to these services there's nothing to
[1:03:20] this holy ghost amen oh i'm so glad i
[1:03:24] didn't find a cold formal fake religion
[1:03:27] but it's a real holy ghost and if you
[1:03:30] ever get that really dwelling on the
[1:03:32] inside of you not just the outpouring of
[1:03:35] a one service but living on the inside
[1:03:37] and christ is living in you and you're
[1:03:39] living in christ friends
[1:03:40] that'll be fresh amen
[1:03:43] amen but it's the holy ghost it's the
[1:03:45] manna
[1:03:46] i wouldn't speak a bit i wouldn't speak
[1:03:48] against it what we have is a bunch of
[1:03:50] half-star theologians trying to explain
[1:03:53] away the movie they haven't eaten manna
[1:03:54] in so long until they can't hardly move
[1:03:57] amen until they can't hardly function
[1:04:00] until they're just about dead on the
[1:04:01] inside about to be dead on the outside
[1:04:04] trying to explain away the moving of the
[1:04:06] holy ghost that smells like garlic to me
[1:04:09] amen to leave this outpouring of to
[1:04:11] leave the bride's revival and go back to
[1:04:13] some baptist or methodist methodism and
[1:04:16] and some kind of a dry religion and a
[1:04:18] cold formality friends
[1:04:21] no sir
[1:04:22] no sir give me the fire of the holy
[1:04:24] ghost not some garlic breath egyptian
[1:04:27] trying to take me back to a dead
[1:04:29] seminary psychology amen with no life in
[1:04:32] it with no movement in it with no
[1:04:33] emotion in it
[1:04:36] what a farce friends i have it's too
[1:04:38] late for me i've already crossed the
[1:04:40] jordan
[1:04:41] i'm not in the wilderness anymore we
[1:04:42] were sharing with the young people on
[1:04:44] sunday about the baptism the holy ghost
[1:04:46] what that really means is brother graham
[1:04:48] said the baptism holy ghost doesn't mean
[1:04:49] no more struggles it doesn't mean no
[1:04:51] more fighting actually when you get the
[1:04:53] holy ghost that's when the battle really
[1:04:54] begins but the wonderful thing is when
[1:04:56] you got the holy ghost you got something
[1:04:58] to battle with
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:01] oh you got a cause friends because in
[1:05:03] that sanctification experience just
[1:05:06] trying to live and warm up you and just
[1:05:08] be a religious church member that's
[1:05:11] fighting for survival that's what they
[1:05:13] were doing it out in the wilderness
[1:05:14] wandering for years and years fighting
[1:05:17] for survival but in canaan we're
[1:05:19] fighting for our rights and there's a
[1:05:21] big difference
[1:05:22] between fighting for your rights and
[1:05:24] just fighting for survival because if
[1:05:26] you're fighting for your right spread
[1:05:28] rights for liberty rights for healing
[1:05:30] rights for the supernatural rights for
[1:05:32] power rights for the baptism of the holy
[1:05:34] ghost it's your right to have peace it's
[1:05:36] your right to have joy when you're
[1:05:38] fighting for that oh it puts a fight in
[1:05:40] your heart puts a fire in your belly
[1:05:42] puts a war cry in your mouth
[1:05:45] a battle shout
[1:05:47] a battle cry friends i'm ready to
[1:05:48] declare war
[1:05:50] i'm ready to declare war on every devil
[1:05:53] that standing between me
[1:05:55] and a total victory in christ every
[1:05:57] devil that would keep would try to keep
[1:05:59] me out of that inner place friends that
[1:06:02] and no devil has a right to enter that
[1:06:04] holy place amen i've got to write any
[1:06:06] devil that would try to trespass on my
[1:06:09] hidden life in christ he must be cast
[1:06:11] out
[1:06:12] because i have a right that i'm fighting
[1:06:14] for
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] what it's time to do amen is not get
[1:06:18] messing around with a bunch of theology
[1:06:20] and psychology and trying to explain
[1:06:22] away the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:06:24] make excuses for why the spirit's not
[1:06:26] moving in our churches and try to find
[1:06:28] some reason in the message why nobody
[1:06:30] got the holy ghost in your church for 10
[1:06:32] years amen friends we got we got
[1:06:34] something to fight for
[1:06:36] not this ain't a time to give land away
[1:06:38] this is a time to fight for every step
[1:06:41] fight for every acre fight for every
[1:06:44] promise fight for the joy fight for the
[1:06:47] noise fight for the for the liberty of
[1:06:50] worship
[1:06:52] amen let's see it's a battle cry it's
[1:06:54] somebody who's not satisfied with just
[1:06:57] showing up to church and just going back
[1:06:58] the way they came or worse
[1:07:00] but it's somebody who wants to come and
[1:07:02] hear the preaching of the word and they
[1:07:04] want to they want to exercise a poll on
[1:07:06] that word because they're looking to
[1:07:08] receive something real
[1:07:10] that's why somebody would shout that's
[1:07:11] why somebody would cry out amen amen
[1:07:14] don't be afraid of that you know that
[1:07:16] noise is a part of holiness
[1:07:19] it's a part of holiness
[1:07:21] friends you know without that noise
[1:07:22] you're not even sanctified yet
[1:07:24] in the aaronic priesthood
[1:07:26] that priest that high priest was the
[1:07:28] only one who had the right to go in that
[1:07:29] inner place
[1:07:31] because he was the only one who went
[1:07:32] through that ritual of sanctification
[1:07:34] and he was the only one sanctified
[1:07:36] enough who had a right to go in there so
[1:07:38] he's typing the true believer right and
[1:07:41] he had to walk right
[1:07:43] he couldn't just walk anyway he wanted
[1:07:44] he had to walk a certain way
[1:07:47] he had to dress right
[1:07:49] he had to eat right he had to feed on
[1:07:51] the right things there was all these
[1:07:53] things that went into sanctification
[1:07:56] amen that would make him eligible for
[1:07:57] that experience of going in there and
[1:07:59] part of the see he had to dress he had
[1:08:01] to be dressed with the robes of holiness
[1:08:04] and part of those robes of holiness was
[1:08:06] a golden bell and a pomegranate
[1:08:08] there was a bell in a pomegranate that
[1:08:10] was on
[1:08:11] the hems of his robe how many know this
[1:08:13] is a scripture amen and he would walk a
[1:08:15] certain way and he would walk that way
[1:08:17] to make those bells make a noise amen
[1:08:20] they would play a certain song brother
[1:08:21] braham said that song was a holy holy
[1:08:24] holy uh
[1:08:26] unto the lord in other words he never
[1:08:28] entered the pro the he never entered
[1:08:30] silent into the presence of god when he
[1:08:32] went into the prayer yeah he was
[1:08:34] reverent but he was not silent
[1:08:36] no he went in with a noise playing a
[1:08:38] song amen with a singing with a wither
[1:08:41] with the noise friends
[1:08:43] oh brother bram said you know he said
[1:08:45] his first time he went around the
[1:08:46] pentecostals he said i noticed many of
[1:08:48] the young preachers were preaching and i
[1:08:50] listen to their message and i thought
[1:08:52] they were kind of noisy
[1:08:54] but then he said you know if you're not
[1:08:56] a little noisy that's a sign that you're
[1:08:58] dead
[1:09:00] if your religion hasn't got some emotion
[1:09:02] in it i can prove to you anything
[1:09:05] without emotion is dead
[1:09:09] he said when aaron went into the holiest
[1:09:11] of holies they put a pomegranate and a
[1:09:13] bell and the only way they knew that he
[1:09:16] was still alive in there
[1:09:18] amen it's because he made a noise
[1:09:20] amen every footstep that he had he was
[1:09:22] making a noise there was a noise in his
[1:09:25] life there was a song in his heart there
[1:09:27] was something that was ringing out until
[1:09:29] people didn't have to wonder is that
[1:09:31] brother saved is that brother is that
[1:09:33] brother got the holy ghost or is he just
[1:09:35] a church member no there was a witness
[1:09:37] there was a noise
[1:09:39] and the noise let them know
[1:09:42] amen they didn't have to cry out and say
[1:09:43] aaron
[1:09:44] are you alive in there
[1:09:46] they could hear that he was alive
[1:09:48] because they were all friends and
[1:09:50] anybody who's ever been shunned with god
[1:09:53] amen it is eating that fresh manna and
[1:09:56] in the riches of the glory of that
[1:09:57] shekinah presence you don't have to
[1:09:59] wonder if they're alive because you'll
[1:10:01] see that emotion you'll see that tears
[1:10:04] running down you'll hear that shout
[1:10:06] you'll see that dancing you'll see that
[1:10:09] smile
[1:10:10] you'll see that expression
[1:10:13] because if there's no expression if
[1:10:15] there's no emotion
[1:10:17] it's dead
[1:10:19] oh friends
[1:10:20] amen see i today i'm not trying to just
[1:10:23] be noisy i'm not trying to work up your
[1:10:25] emotion
[1:10:26] with this sermon honestly
[1:10:28] i'm just looking for a witness
[1:10:30] are you alive in there
[1:10:35] sure we're tabernacle are you alive in
[1:10:37] there
[1:10:38] oh then we ought to ring those bells

[1:10:43] rejoice and worship god there ought to
[1:10:45] be a holy holy holy unto the lord not
[1:10:49] just a holy life a sacrificial but a
[1:10:51] holy praise a holy worship holy hands
[1:10:55] lifted up in prayer

[1:11:25] cracked and it's been worn down amen but
[1:11:28] but but you see there's thousands of
[1:11:30] replicas that were struck off of that
[1:11:32] bell
[1:11:33] amen and in this country we ring those
[1:11:35] liberty bells amen and that that ringing
[1:11:38] that that joyous noise that is
[1:11:40] testifying not that we were free
[1:11:43] but we ring it to remind the to make a
[1:11:46] memorial over the nation that we not
[1:11:48] only were free but we are free amen it's
[1:11:52] a and friends we're free this afternoon
[1:11:55] this evening we're free
[1:11:57] we're free from the yoke of sin we're
[1:11:59] free from the bondage of laodicea we're
[1:12:02] free from the pressures of this age
[1:12:06] we're free to soar above it all
[1:12:08] that's why we ring that bell that's why
[1:12:10] we worship god
[1:12:12] with a zeal with a passion
[1:12:14] with an emotion
[1:12:16] we ring it to remember our liberation
[1:12:18] just like israel at the red sea amen oh
[1:12:21] they danced because they were free
[1:12:23] they sang because they were free
[1:12:27] brother brahm said moses sing in the
[1:12:29] spirit
[1:12:30] miriam beat the tambourine all the
[1:12:31] daughters of israel and up and down the
[1:12:33] banks they went a dancing
[1:12:35] he said if that ain't a pentecostal
[1:12:36] meeting i don't know what one is
[1:12:39] oh someone said to me long ago said
[1:12:40] brother branham you're preaching this
[1:12:42] new kind of salvation aren't you
[1:12:45] you got this new
[1:12:46] you got this new salvation
[1:12:48] he said no
[1:12:49] she said oh i said ain't you got some of
[1:12:51] this new salvation no i got a new case
[1:12:53] of the old salvation
[1:12:56] that's right he said oh this is the
[1:12:58] oldest there is they said well when was
[1:13:00] it organized he said before the
[1:13:01] foundation of the world
[1:13:03] where were you when the morning stars
[1:13:05] sang together and the sons of god
[1:13:07] shouted for joy friends where were they
[1:13:09] they were in the mind of god oh
[1:13:12] hallelujah and as long as i've gone
[1:13:14] beyond the veil and i'm in christ why
[1:13:16] shouldn't i shout for joy
[1:13:18] i know that i'm a son i know that i've
[1:13:21] received my capstone i know that this
[1:13:23] message has come down to adopt me out of
[1:13:25] this world then i ought to shout because
[1:13:28] i'm just as much in the mind of god now
[1:13:30] as i was back there so i got a right to
[1:13:33] shout i got a right to sing for joy
[1:13:38] give me that old-time religion none of
[1:13:40] this post-modern layout seeing lukewarm
[1:13:43] amen bunch of well they're just just
[1:13:45] haphazard amen half-hearted religion
[1:13:49] but a true
[1:13:51] passionate
[1:13:52] emotional
[1:13:53] zealous
[1:13:55] reality
[1:13:58] hallelujah oh friends brother bram said
[1:14:01] people might say we're too emotional
[1:14:04] but he said it is an emotion
[1:14:07] well actually he said in one way it is
[1:14:09] emotion
[1:14:10] but he said anything that hasn't got
[1:14:11] emotion
[1:14:12] is dead now i know this is every
[1:14:14] evangelist favorite quote
[1:14:16] but maybe we ought to believe it
[1:14:20] if it hasn't got emotion
[1:14:22] that's a great sign that it's dead
[1:14:24] inside
[1:14:26] so if your religion he said hasn't got a
[1:14:28] little emotion about it you better bury
[1:14:30] it because it's dead
[1:14:32] you know i know this message
[1:14:34] has become so complicated
[1:14:37] and it has become so religious and so
[1:14:39] deep to people until they've got soul
[1:14:42] they got so you know doctrinally and
[1:14:44] mystery minded
[1:14:45] until they're afraid of any emotion
[1:14:48] but you know they wrote an old song back
[1:14:50] in the day
[1:14:52] that makes it real simple
[1:14:54] real simple and i think this is the
[1:14:56] deepest thing you might get tonight
[1:14:58] is the words to this song
[1:15:00] i sing
[1:15:02] because
[1:15:08] i
[1:15:08] shout because
[1:15:12] i dance
[1:15:14] because
[1:15:17] i'm happy
[1:15:20] and it doesn't have to get any deeper
[1:15:21] than that friends
[1:15:23] i believe oh
[1:15:25] we don't have to be scared of this
[1:15:27] the thing about it is when you when you
[1:15:29] come into the house of god you put all
[1:15:31] your sins under the blood and you're
[1:15:33] standing there in fellowship with the
[1:15:35] message of the hour and the word of god
[1:15:36] and something starts to stir in your
[1:15:38] heart you begin to think about where
[1:15:40] he's brought you from you begin to think
[1:15:42] about his goodness in your life you
[1:15:43] begin to think about the victories he's
[1:15:45] been giving you friends then it would be
[1:15:47] a sin not to shout it would be a sin not
[1:15:50] to be emotional because it would be a
[1:15:52] deception but we should worship from the
[1:15:55] honest heartfelt and genuine feelings of
[1:15:58] our heart
[1:15:59] and react to what the lord has done
[1:16:02] there's nothing sin oh
[1:16:04] friends
[1:16:05] what do you call somebody who's excited
[1:16:07] but they can't shout
[1:16:09] someone who's happy but they can't dance
[1:16:13] or move but they can't cry
[1:16:15] that's not mature
[1:16:17] that's
[1:16:18] dead that's dead
[1:16:21] and friends don't don't don't ever be
[1:16:23] deceived by that amen because that that
[1:16:25] deadness that lay out of sea and
[1:16:27] deadness it'll use any quote any
[1:16:29] scripture any rationale any reasoning
[1:16:32] that it can find anything it can come up
[1:16:34] with to justify why it's not dead but
[1:16:37] it's easy to tell that it's dead because
[1:16:40] it's got no emotion and it's got no
[1:16:42] movement it's got no feeling
[1:16:46] it ought to be the least descentful
[1:16:47] thing
[1:16:48] the least deceitful thing to someone
[1:16:50] who's really shut in with god and tasted
[1:16:52] this manna
[1:16:53] taste and see friends
[1:16:54] you'll never accept a substitute after
[1:16:56] that
[1:16:58] it's not mature it's dead you know
[1:16:59] friends
[1:17:00] you know uh you know the the thing of it
[1:17:03] is we're always gonna have people
[1:17:04] criticizing and there's always gonna be
[1:17:06] people trying to micromanage god and
[1:17:08] trying to question is this right is that
[1:17:09] right is that right is that right is
[1:17:11] that right and you can't hardly break
[1:17:12] into a dance with god or or something
[1:17:15] like that without the devil coming to
[1:17:16] your mind trying to make you think about
[1:17:18] what somebody else is thinking about it
[1:17:19] but you know i think i'm getting to the
[1:17:21] age finally friends where i just don't
[1:17:23] worry so much well p i think i'm going
[1:17:25] to be a big boy now
[1:17:26] amen i i i really it really uh i find
[1:17:30] that it just bothers me less and less
[1:17:32] what somebody might think about i know
[1:17:33] where i stand with god i know in whom i
[1:17:36] have believed i know my position in
[1:17:38] christ i'll shout if i want to i got
[1:17:40] something to shout about
[1:17:42] i got something to dance about
[1:17:44] i got something down deep in my heart
[1:17:47] gives me glorious feelings amen be free
[1:17:50] to worship god amen be honest and be
[1:17:52] sincere and be heartfelt don't withhold
[1:17:54] from the lord
[1:17:56] he loves the worship and the praises of
[1:17:58] his people
[1:17:59] amen if the praises of the angels were
[1:18:01] enough he never would have had to come
[1:18:03] to redeem us but he was not satisfied
[1:18:05] with an angelic worship but he called
[1:18:07] forth flawed sons of adam amen
[1:18:11] sinners come into the world speaking
[1:18:13] lies out of their mother's womb fallen
[1:18:16] and corrupt and he redeemed those people
[1:18:18] so that their praise would mean
[1:18:20] something to him their worship would
[1:18:22] mean something to him they would have a
[1:18:24] song that the angels couldn't sing
[1:18:27] they sent a message to give you a new
[1:18:29] song
[1:18:30] a new worship
[1:18:31] a new liberty a new freedom
[1:18:34] don't ever let anyone take it from you
[1:18:36] oh if you're still stuck in this
[1:18:38] sanctification court and you could talk
[1:18:39] about all the candlesticks and church
[1:18:41] ages or whatever but you ain't got your
[1:18:43] bells yet you might be smarter than me
[1:18:45] but you're not deeper because i'm in
[1:18:46] there
[1:18:47] i've gone past that court of religion
[1:18:49] past that court of sanctification passed
[1:18:52] the veil amen and i'm in the holy of
[1:18:54] holies in a personal communion
[1:18:57] with the shekinah glory
[1:19:00] and nothing is deeper than that
[1:19:02] there's no room deeper there's no
[1:19:05] experience deeper
[1:19:07] than to be then to be dead to your old
[1:19:09] husband and married and one with christ
[1:19:14] in that ark
[1:19:16] between the wings of the cherubim
[1:19:19] surrounded by the angels
[1:19:21] friends somebody who feels things but
[1:19:23] they can't freely express them that's a
[1:19:25] damaged person and we've got too many of
[1:19:28] our people too many of our young people
[1:19:29] i've been hearing testimonies too many
[1:19:31] young people have been damaged by
[1:19:32] somebody trying to bully them out of any
[1:19:34] emotion bullying them off of any feeling
[1:19:37] amen there ought to be nobody happier
[1:19:39] than a young person nobody with more pep
[1:19:41] in their step and more zeal in their
[1:19:43] heart than a young person and satan has
[1:19:45] tried to rob that amen but i will
[1:19:48] restore saith the lord
[1:19:50] i'll pour out my spirit and young men
[1:19:52] will prophesy and a young miriam will
[1:19:55] take a tambourine and have a dance
[1:19:58] i'll turn your ashes to rejoicing i'll
[1:20:01] turn your sorrows to glories
[1:20:03] i will restore
[1:20:06] i'll heal
[1:20:07] amen we got too many damaged people
[1:20:10] trying to make excuses why they're
[1:20:11] damaged excuses why they can't feel why
[1:20:14] they can't worship why they can't shout
[1:20:16] or why they can't dance
[1:20:18] stop making excuses
[1:20:21] run to this healer run to this rock
[1:20:24] get into the shelter
[1:20:26] until you stop worrying about what
[1:20:28] everyone else thinks
[1:20:32] and you can worship god like no one else
[1:20:34] in this world exists
[1:20:36] like you've been raptured up onto
[1:20:38] another planet
[1:20:39] amen i'll tell you could almost like
[1:20:41] brother man said speak another one to
[1:20:42] existence in your own mind and go there
[1:20:45] and worship god with abandon and with an
[1:20:47] open heart and freely
[1:20:49] you got a right to do that if if god's
[1:20:51] bride doesn't have a right to worship
[1:20:53] him who does
[1:20:55] if you don't have a right to worship him
[1:20:57] the angels should shut up
[1:20:59] amen
[1:21:00] the heavens should hold silent
[1:21:03] if the redeemed and ransom bride of
[1:21:05] jesus christ can't give him the glory
[1:21:10] we've been attacked by so many lies
[1:21:12] people have been so damaged
[1:21:14] people have been so bullied off of any
[1:21:16] emotion until they're afraid of it
[1:21:18] until we got people that they feel joy
[1:21:21] they feel freedom
[1:21:23] they feel like they got a victory they
[1:21:25] feel like they've been delivered but
[1:21:26] they dare not show it
[1:21:28] because of what someone might think
[1:21:30] oh france
[1:21:33] may god give us liberty tonight
[1:21:36] well you say well brother nathan he must
[1:21:38] be really woke up tonight he must be

[1:21:44] you know that personally i'm sure there
[1:21:46] were criticism personally i haven't
[1:21:47] heard a word
[1:21:49] a single word of criticism

[1:21:52] weekend france and that's something we
[1:21:54] really got to get a hold of amen i have
[1:21:57] not heard a word of criticism about it
[1:21:58] and yet every young person amen who who
[1:22:02] breaks into worship amen

[1:22:06] when those chains come off they fall
[1:22:08] noisy they fall they fall all of a
[1:22:11] sudden people feel light amen and then
[1:22:13] these young people got to deal with fake
[1:22:15] this attack in their mind and the
[1:22:17] devil's making a worry about what
[1:22:18] someone might say and you know we're
[1:22:20] going to all this worry and all of this
[1:22:22] in all of this this wrestling in our
[1:22:24] mind over about five miserable people
[1:22:27] amen who's never felt the joy of the
[1:22:29] lord in their life we ought to forget
[1:22:31] what the devil thinks we ought to we are
[1:22:33] not we ought to not to give that spirit
[1:22:35] the time of day we ought not to hardly
[1:22:38] legitimize it by speaking about it it's
[1:22:40] so insignificant in the face of a worthy
[1:22:44] god who's worthy of worship and praise
[1:22:48] hallelujah it's time to drown out the
[1:22:50] critics there's more with us than there
[1:22:52] are with them

[1:22:55] rejoicing with us

[1:22:58] of god what's happened in heaven at this
[1:23:00] time which is a sinner coming to christ

[1:23:11] and their white victory flags

[1:23:19] ringing melodies as for one sinner

[1:23:41] god friends i tell you heaven is
[1:23:44] rejoicing
[1:23:45] and it's rejoicing at such a level where
[1:23:47] some of these old critics if they were
[1:23:49] there they'd freeze to death brother
[1:23:50] bran i'm set amen think these coldly out
[1:23:53] of sea and winds or something wait till

[1:23:59] could only see him tonight just circle
[1:24:01] in the building amen just whirling
[1:24:03] through this place waving white flags
[1:24:05] saying yes people of god yes redeemed of
[1:24:08] the lord sing the song that we angels
[1:24:10] cannot sing we lift up the worship that
[1:24:13] we can't even know amen oh sing that new
[1:24:16] song of revelation
[1:24:20] hallelujah
[1:24:22] one sinner coming to christ
[1:24:24] you say brother nathan you're trying to
[1:24:25] get everybody worked up just so you can
[1:24:26] feel like a big prayer i know how your
[1:24:28] preachers are brother nathan you just
[1:24:29] want everybody to get pumped up and then
[1:24:30] you'll feel like you did something
[1:24:34] can i be honest with you tonight i'm not
[1:24:35] that small of a person
[1:24:38] amen my desires preach a word of
[1:24:40] substance my desire is to preach a word
[1:24:41] that will change your life my desire is
[1:24:43] to carry this message amen not and not
[1:24:46] measure my success by by an outward
[1:24:48] reaction of the people
[1:24:50] but i'll tell you what i am trying to do
[1:24:51] tonight
[1:24:53] amen is in the bible it spoke of a man
[1:24:55] named lazarus
[1:24:57] amen who was raised
[1:24:59] from death unto life
[1:25:01] and he was raised from death but you
[1:25:02] know that man was dead one moment
[1:25:05] and alive the next
[1:25:07] amen a perfect type of the resurrection
[1:25:10] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:12] but he found that even though he was
[1:25:14] raised alive he came waddling out of
[1:25:16] that tomb
[1:25:17] because he was wrapped up in all those
[1:25:19] grave clothes
[1:25:21] jesus raised him from the dead and he's
[1:25:23] just as alive that he could be but he
[1:25:24] couldn't raise his hand
[1:25:26] couldn't sing a shout because he was
[1:25:28] muffled he was bound he was tied up with
[1:25:30] those rags of sin
[1:25:33] and jesus sent the servants and said
[1:25:35] loose them loose him
[1:25:38] and let him go oh and what i'm trying
[1:25:41] with all my heart as we stand tonight
[1:25:43] hey man
[1:25:44] i'm just his servant today
[1:25:46] trying to help somebody
[1:25:49] just just get rid of a little more of
[1:25:50] those grave clothes
[1:25:53] just get a little less bound
[1:25:55] a little more free
[1:25:56] get a little more movement a little more
[1:25:58] voice a little less muffled friends
[1:26:00] because i know this world's pressing on
[1:26:02] you like it's pressing on me and i know
[1:26:04] he's the satan's doing everything he can
[1:26:06] to bind us up and hold us tight till we
[1:26:08] can't hardly move friends but there is a
[1:26:11] power the same power that raised you out
[1:26:13] of the death of sin is able to lose
[1:26:15] those grave clothes is able to put a joy
[1:26:18] where there used to be a joy maybe like
[1:26:20] you never had before a peace and a
[1:26:23] worship and a shout and a glory there's
[1:26:26] a lot of people say well you know i'm
[1:26:27] just a quiet person you know i don't i'm
[1:26:29] not that person who dances and shouts
[1:26:31] and screams maybe you're not but maybe
[1:26:33] you are and you just don't know it
[1:26:35] because you just never you never pushed
[1:26:38] against those grave clothes a little bit
[1:26:40] i i'm saying it because i know that's
[1:26:41] how it was for me amen where one day i'd
[1:26:43] be a young man you know with my head
[1:26:45] down self-conscious worried what
[1:26:46] somebody would think about me and then
[1:26:48] but the lord began to deal with me by
[1:26:50] the word and and you know then the next
[1:26:51] day it'd be maybe just i just raise a
[1:26:53] hand just nod my head and maybe whisper
[1:26:56] and amen
[1:26:57] whisper an amen but you know then that
[1:26:59] whisper turns to a shout
[1:27:01] and that little wave turns into a it
[1:27:03] turns into a dance
[1:27:04] you get looser and looser the more that
[1:27:06] you press against those grave clothes
[1:27:10] may god loosen someone today
[1:27:13] loose him and let him go let him worship
[1:27:15] god i'm i'm crying out to you lazarus
[1:27:18] are you alive in there
[1:27:21] are you alive in there
[1:27:24] let's have a word of prayer
[1:27:27] lord jesus i just
[1:27:29] deliver my heart tonight lord out of
[1:27:31] sincerity and i thank you for this
[1:27:33] wonderful people
[1:27:34] god that would respond to the preaching
[1:27:36] of the word such a simple thought
[1:27:38] oh god but it's such a reality father
[1:27:42] how we're just looking for a place lord
[1:27:45] for a way to let off the pressure of
[1:27:47] this world
[1:27:50] god we got people so bound up and
[1:27:54] so much condemnation so much pressure so
[1:27:57] much
[1:27:58] so many things in this world just
[1:27:59] sucking the joy right out of us oh god
[1:28:02] i pray that you'd restore our joy
[1:28:04] tonight
[1:28:05] father may you just do something
[1:28:07] supernatural in our midst there would be
[1:28:08] more lord than just a noisy service but
[1:28:11] god made the holy ghost do something in
[1:28:13] every heart lord and i and that includes
[1:28:16] me lord may you just go in there and
[1:28:19] shut me in there with you god
[1:28:23] and just lord may i remember what it
[1:28:26] feels like
[1:28:27] to be shut in with god and the world
[1:28:29] shut out
[1:28:30] and as if nobody else exists
[1:28:33] maybe somebody here tonight would enter
[1:28:35] into that holy of holies for the first
[1:28:37] time
[1:28:39] that holy ghost would just come in so
[1:28:41] sweetly that shekinah glory would brood
[1:28:43] over that heart and they say oh god set
[1:28:46] me free to worship you
[1:28:49] oh
[1:28:50] give me a reality
[1:28:52] give me something that'll hold me
[1:28:55] give me something that'll give me joy in
[1:28:57] a joyless world oh god may you grant it
[1:29:00] father
[1:29:01] may you put the broken pieces together
[1:29:04] lord not only the broken pieces of this
[1:29:06] sermon lord but the broken pieces of
[1:29:08] every heart those that have been bullied
[1:29:10] those that have been damaged those have
[1:29:11] been given complexes those that can't
[1:29:14] hardly raise a hand without thinking
[1:29:16] they've been taught to think what
[1:29:18] somebody might think lord what somebody
[1:29:20] might be criticizing somebody might call
[1:29:22] it a motion but god
[1:29:24] may we break through that
[1:29:27] may it be broken lord may those chains
[1:29:29] fall may those grave clothes
[1:29:33] come falling off god and may we be
[1:29:36] loosed lord to go on our christian life
[1:29:39] rejoicing

[1:31:55] new power
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:10] with
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:23] there's a
[1:32:24] worship in your heart
[1:32:28] you're just set free
[1:32:31] you don't care what anybody else says
[1:32:33] that's right
[1:32:34] you actually get shut in like i've
[1:32:36] rather preached
[1:32:38] it don't make any difference what
[1:32:39] anybody thinks
[1:32:42] i was thinking about it you know and one
[1:32:43] of the
[1:32:44] brothers ministered you know
[1:32:46] you know
[1:32:48] people shouted ball games
[1:32:51] and they just go crazy
[1:32:53] in fact they get in fights over certain
[1:32:55] things and
[1:32:56] they go berserk
[1:32:58] and you know
[1:32:59] the world don't think anything about
[1:33:01] that
[1:33:02] but you let a believer start opening up
[1:33:05] and praise the lord
[1:33:07] and worship the lord
[1:33:09] the devil don't like it
[1:33:12] i know nathan sent me a testimony
[1:33:15] from the meeting
[1:33:17] it's one of our dear sisters by the end
[1:33:19] it's one of your daughters i don't
[1:33:20] remember her name but in it right now
[1:33:22] but anyway
[1:33:24] she was set free
[1:33:25] so she can worship now
[1:33:28] and had a great love in her heart
[1:33:31] great love in her heart for
[1:33:33] other people
[1:33:35] oh my that's a victory
[1:33:38] can i give you a little testimony about
[1:33:39] worship
[1:33:41] it goes right along with this preaching
[1:33:42] tonight
[1:33:44] i haven't talked to my neighbor for
[1:33:46] quite a while i don't necessarily barge
[1:33:48] into his house and say hey robert what's
[1:33:50] going on now
[1:33:53] but he was out mowing yesterday
[1:33:55] and so we got in the conversation
[1:33:58] and
[1:34:00] i can put it right along with this
[1:34:02] incidentally he's further along in the
[1:34:04] church age booking i wanted to know what
[1:34:06] what his pastor thought about
[1:34:08] what his congregation well he he didn't
[1:34:10] mention a whole lot he showed it just
[1:34:12] showed him the book
[1:34:13] but he was really wondering who i was
[1:34:16] you know what's the deal with this guy i
[1:34:18] guess you know but he's an independent
[1:34:21] man but my neighbor
[1:34:23] was sharing with me he said you remember
[1:34:25] brother ray or not not didn't call me
[1:34:27] brother but ray he said remember
[1:34:29] about two years ago
[1:34:32] you actually prayed for me out on the
[1:34:34] lawn but he said i
[1:34:36] i had a a terrible case of anxiety
[1:34:40] terrorism anxiety and my blood pressure
[1:34:43] was up that's all he ever told me
[1:34:46] but yesterday he told me what was really
[1:34:48] behind it
[1:34:49] he said you know really i don't believe
[1:34:50] i ever told you
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] but he said i was diagnosed i think it's
[1:34:56] called i don't know your medical people
[1:34:57] have to forgive me but something has to
[1:34:59] do a roman something but it has to do
[1:35:01] with a partial some type of leukemia
[1:35:05] some type of leukemia in his blood
[1:35:09] and he said you know one day
[1:35:12] i just
[1:35:13] i had a song in my heart i wanted to
[1:35:15] hear and somebody's singing i don't
[1:35:17] remember the name of the person but he
[1:35:20] said he started saying it and i started
[1:35:21] worshiping
[1:35:23] he said i just started just worshiping
[1:35:26] and he said i don't have a bit of that
[1:35:27] leukemia
[1:35:30] the lord heal them
[1:35:32] i've got repeat
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:39] so there's something about worship
[1:35:42] about praise and thanksgiving oh my god
[1:35:46] god bless you nathan
[1:35:48] i know that came from your heart
[1:35:53] we're a blessed people
[1:35:57] we're really a blessed people
[1:36:00] now as a pastor once again we're
[1:36:03] we're facing situations
[1:36:06] i find out about more sick people just
[1:36:08] before church
[1:36:10] so
[1:36:12] it you know you just have to be open and
[1:36:15] if if you can surrender let me lead
[1:36:19] okay and make decisions
[1:36:21] some of the churches gotta have already
[1:36:23] shut down brother donnie's and brother
[1:36:25] tim's before
[1:36:27] and i don't really want to do it i love
[1:36:29] church
[1:36:31] so i just want you to pray
[1:36:34] that the lord will guide us
[1:36:35] these people now there's different
[1:36:37] things happening
[1:36:39] some of it is cool but
[1:36:41] some of it is like ruth and i had a bad
[1:36:43] cold there's no fever no nothing
[1:36:46] and i

[1:42:38] something that we can
[1:42:40] take as substance
[1:42:43] and put in our hearts and apply it
[1:42:50] lord
[1:42:52] may the pomegranates ring
[1:42:55] may we walk in the step of the word
[1:42:59] and may there be a shout in the camp
[1:43:02] to notify the devil we're alive
[1:43:06] and we're not going to die
