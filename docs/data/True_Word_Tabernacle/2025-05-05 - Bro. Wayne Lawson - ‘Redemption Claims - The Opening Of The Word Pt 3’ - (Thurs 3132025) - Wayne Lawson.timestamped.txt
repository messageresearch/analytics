[5:18] All to

[5:23] I

[5:37] Oh the joy
[5:42] of sal. Glory, glory. Yes,

[5:56] I serve him.
[6:00] [Music]
[6:17] My
[6:19] blessed
[6:22] [Music]
[6:27] Savior
[6:30] all. Amen. Amen. That's our heart's
[6:34] desire tonight. Amen. Is to give him
[6:36] every little portion. Amen. that he
[6:38] might be the ruler and the reigner of
[6:41] our lives. And we want to tonight, it's
[6:43] um on our heart here, a few things that
[6:46] we've been been speaking just before we
[6:48] uh took a a couple days off here. We uh
[6:51] we're looking at the opening of the word
[6:53] and I want to continue there. Uh but
[6:56] just before we read the Bible tonight,
[6:58] can we just ask the Lord uh to bless his
[7:01] word? Father, we come to the house of
[7:03] the Lord tonight, Lord, believing that
[7:06] you would meet us here, Lord. We believe
[7:09] truly that your grace, Lord,
[7:12] reaches, Lord, far beyond even the hand
[7:15] of judgment. And we thank you tonight,
[7:18] Lord, that you have met us, Lord, in our
[7:20] place. And you gave us the grace to
[7:22] believe this great word that you've sent
[7:24] in this age. And Lord Jesus, you put it
[7:27] in our heart and you you made it so real
[7:30] to us that it became our life. Now I
[7:33] pray tonight, Father, as we would speak
[7:35] on some of these things, I pray that
[7:38] Lord, may the spirit of
[7:40] revelation, may it grip the heart of
[7:43] your your people, Lord. Father, may it
[7:46] comfort them and strengthen them. And
[7:48] Lord, set them a new of flames in their
[7:50] hearts and courage and strength for the
[7:53] future. We ask tonight if there be any
[7:55] sick among us, may you heal them, Lord.
[7:57] Father, and we ask you now, may you
[7:59] bless the reading of your word, Father,
[8:02] instruct us in this. We pray in Jesus
[8:05] name. Amen. And amen. And God bless you.
[8:09] If you have your Bibles tonight, uh we
[8:11] want to read in the word of God. And uh
[8:14] I I want to read uh 1 Thessalonians
[8:17] chapter 4 and verse 16. I have uh uh
[8:20] several more scriptures to go. Uh but I
[8:23] I I'll get to them along the way. So we
[8:25] want to just just for a scripture
[8:27] reading uh for 1 Thessalonians chapter 4
[8:30] uh uh verse
[8:32] 16. For the Lord
[8:35] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[8:40] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[8:44] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[8:46] in Christ shall rise first. May God
[8:50] bless the reading of the word. As you
[8:51] could be seated tonight, I'm going to be
[8:54] speaking to you tonight on the opening
[8:55] of the word part three. I'm going to
[8:58] speak to you a little bit tonight about
[8:59] redemption claims. About redemption
[9:02] claims. Now, when we are uh talking
[9:05] about the opening of the word, what
[9:07] we're really discussing with you is the
[9:10] is the ministry of William Brham uh
[9:13] which would have been the third part of
[9:15] his ministry. It was the time when a
[9:18] prophet took the word and begin to uh
[9:20] outline and detail the teachings on the
[9:23] things of God which would usher the
[9:25] church into uh it would usher them into
[9:28] another dispensation. So we're talking
[9:30] about the dispensational changes and how
[9:33] that this had taken place. And I I find
[9:36] that in the book of Thessalonians here,
[9:38] it's a powerful reading because before
[9:41] the time that brother Brandham uh
[9:43] preached the message of the rapture, do
[9:45] you realize that there had been nobody
[9:47] teach the actual full truth on the
[9:50] rapture from the time of Paul all the
[9:53] way the time of brother Brandham? So all
[9:55] the things that was written between the
[9:57] times, amen, become tradition such as
[10:00] brother Nathan was speaking on Sunday
[10:02] morning that people would begin to
[10:04] believe this about it and they believe
[10:06] something else about it and they begin
[10:07] to believe something else about it. But
[10:09] the Bible is clear that God doesn't
[10:12] anything until first he sends a prophet.
[10:14] And if surely if it was going to be
[10:17] something so important as the rapture of
[10:19] the church, he would have to send a
[10:21] prophet. Didn't Paul actually call the
[10:23] rapture a mystery when he said it, I'll
[10:26] show you a mystery how you will not all
[10:28] sleep, but you shall be changed. So, it
[10:30] took a prophet to unlock that mystery.
[10:33] Now, I I'm not going to spend a long
[10:34] time there, but I want to just say this
[10:36] for this portion. For the Lord himself
[10:38] shall descend from heaven with a shout.
[10:40] The spirit of the Lord, where the spirit
[10:42] of the Lord is, there is liberty. Now,
[10:44] it says in the book of Corinthians that
[10:46] the Lord is that spirit. Amen. that
[10:49] spirit of liberty that that opens up the
[10:51] word. The Lord himself, Christ himself
[10:54] would descend from heaven. But he would
[10:56] do it differently than the theologians
[10:58] traditionally had you thinking because
[11:00] everyone was thinking it was just going
[11:02] to be just like that and it's all going
[11:04] to be over in just one moment. But we
[11:05] didn't realize that there had to come a
[11:08] shout and and that shout would be if
[11:11] you've heard the opening of the seven
[11:12] thunders. The symbology has been removed
[11:15] and we can read the Bible plainly now
[11:18] and we could see easily that the shout
[11:20] is the message of William Brandom. Amen.
[11:23] It's not just the message of brother
[11:25] Brandham. It's the third pull of his
[11:27] message. So it's it's not the a it's not
[11:30] the days of preparation. It was the days
[11:33] when the message was being preached.
[11:35] Amen. Now it was the Lord himself. So
[11:37] it's a shout. So that's the first thing
[11:38] God does to rapture the church is to put
[11:41] a shout out. The next thing that happens
[11:44] is the message that is preached becomes
[11:47] preeminent in the church and it's called
[11:49] the voice of resurrection. In other
[11:50] words, you are the voice of the
[11:52] resurrection. The same as the grain out
[11:55] in the field in the in the fall of the
[11:57] year. That grain tells the farmer when
[12:01] harvest comes.
[12:02] The farmer don't tell the grain when
[12:04] harvest comes. The grain tells the
[12:06] farmer when harvest comes. And so is the
[12:09] bride, the voice of resurrection. Her
[12:12] maturity speaks her resurrection. Her
[12:15] maturity in the word calls for Christ to
[12:19] come and receive them for they're ready
[12:21] to go. That's the voice of the
[12:23] resurrection. That's what we would also
[12:25] call the second part of the adoption of
[12:28] the church. The first part, the shout is
[12:30] the tutorship. The second part is the
[12:32] voice or the preeminence. And we know
[12:35] the fullness of adoption is the changing
[12:37] of our body. Is that right? So you see
[12:39] the three phases of adoption laid out
[12:42] clearly in 1 Thessalonians 4. There has
[12:44] to be a tutorship. There has to be a
[12:47] living out what is taught. And then
[12:49] there is a taking away. Amen. Or a body
[12:51] change. The trump is the change of the
[12:53] body. Now I'm saying that because
[12:55] brother Random said, see three things
[12:57] have to happen. A shout is the message
[12:59] going forth. It's the living bread
[13:02] bringing forth the bride. Now God has a
[13:04] way of doing thing and he never changes
[13:06] his policies. He's the unchanging God.
[13:09] Now he quotes Amos the third chapter and
[13:12] the seventh verse. He would do nothing
[13:14] and in the earth until first he revealed
[13:16] it to the servants the prophet. Now so
[13:19] let's say it real plainly. The message
[13:21] of William Brandham is the shout of 1
[13:23] Thessalonians 4. And the shout is the
[13:26] third pull of brother Brandham's
[13:29] ministry. So the revival of the church
[13:31] today is not under the first pull. Our
[13:34] revival does not exist under the second
[13:36] pull of his ministry. But the the
[13:38] revival of the bride exists under the
[13:42] opening of the word of God. Amen. If
[13:45] you're going to have an unending revival
[13:47] that's going to last more than just the
[13:50] feeling that that falls on the church,
[13:52] it has to be established in the word.
[13:54] See, because no matter how you feel,
[13:57] this Bible reads the same every day.
[13:59] When you're in a good mood, I'm the
[14:01] bride. When I'm in a bad mood, I'm the
[14:03] bride. When I'm on the mountain, I'm the
[14:05] bride. When I'm in the valley, I'm the
[14:08] bride. It is a sustaining revelation
[14:11] that brings the church into that
[14:13] authority of the adoption in the day
[14:16] that we're living in. I'm just going to
[14:18] say it real plainly that you cannot come
[14:20] to adoption outside of the message of
[14:23] William Brandham. It is, let's say it
[14:25] real plain, okay? The adoption is the
[14:28] message. It's coming under the headship
[14:31] of the message of the hour. Amen. Amen.
[14:34] So, so I can prove that a hundred ways,
[14:36] but we'll move on. Amen. Now, what
[14:38] that's dealing with is that you come
[14:39] under the word of God. You you you you
[14:41] you have allowed the word to come. It's
[14:44] the word of the hour. Now, when brother
[14:47] sees the vision of the third pull, you
[14:49] all know he says that he says that he
[14:51] saw it and and uh and we're going to get
[14:53] into this a little later, but you know,
[14:55] he seen that vision of the third pull
[14:57] and it was about a tent vision. Amen.
[15:00] And it was about how that God told him
[15:02] uh he he moved to that little room. He
[15:04] said, "And I'll meet you in there, and
[15:06] that'll be the third pull." Is that
[15:07] right? He says, "I'll meet you in there,
[15:10] and that will be the third pull." I love
[15:13] how he says it. "I'll meet you in there,
[15:15] and that will be the third pull." But he
[15:18] said the other day up in Sabino Canyon,
[15:20] he said, "I was praying and when that
[15:22] sword came into my hand," he says, "This
[15:26] is the third pull." See, in 1956, he
[15:29] said, "It will be the third pull." But
[15:32] in Sabino's canyon when that sword came
[15:34] in his hand, he said this is the third
[15:37] pull. So we move from it will be till it
[15:41] is. Amen. In other words, the church is
[15:43] not waiting for their revival. We're
[15:46] we're not looking for a personality to
[15:49] rise up on the scene that's going to
[15:51] lead us into this great revival. Amen.
[15:54] But you find out where the revival came
[15:56] is when the person of Christ came into
[15:59] the church. And you can have a revival
[16:01] with, Amen. three local brothers. Amen.
[16:03] Amen. Because of the message of the
[16:05] hour. Amen. It's done away with
[16:08] personalities and brought us to the
[16:10] person of Jesus Christ. This isn't about
[16:13] me building up my ministry. It's about
[16:15] us building up the ministry of Christ
[16:18] inside the heart of the bride of Jesus
[16:21] Christ. Amen. To establish the kingdom
[16:23] of God. Brother Bam said, "I'll meet you
[16:25] in there and that will be the third
[16:27] pool." But in Sabino Canyon, this will
[16:30] be the third pool. And they won't
[16:32] nobody, you won't tell nobody about
[16:34] this. And he didn't. Amen. He hid it
[16:37] till he till he passed. And then they
[16:38] released the second part of the tape
[16:40] which says it. And Sabinho, he said this
[16:43] is the third pull. Now watch. We find
[16:45] out then that what is that third pull?
[16:48] It is the sword in the hand. That's the
[16:50] symbology is the sword, right? And we
[16:52] all know that the word of God is God's
[16:56] sword. Amen. That is the Bible says that
[16:58] the word is the sword of the spirit.
[17:01] Amen. It is his sword. So, brother
[17:03] Bradom will uh in the anointed ones of
[17:05] the end time, he'll come in again and
[17:07] he'll say, "Now, notice the very day
[17:09] when this messenger starts, when he
[17:11] begins to declare his message, the first
[17:14] pull will be healing."
[17:16] Now, do we still believe in healing? Of
[17:19] course we do. But our revival is not a
[17:22] healing revival. Amen. The second pool
[17:26] is a prophesying. In other words, a
[17:28] discerning of the hearts. Now, does the
[17:30] word still discern hearts? Absolutely.
[17:33] If you've ever sat under an anointed man
[17:35] of God, you've had your heart read.
[17:37] You've had your story told. But it's not
[17:39] the Messiah sign that was applied to the
[17:43] message of William Brham that was
[17:45] vindicating one man to tell you the
[17:48] truth concerning what was coming in the
[17:50] third pull. Now he says, "Then the third
[17:52] pull is the opening of the word." Amen.
[17:55] So let's say it together. The third pull
[17:58] is the opening of the word. Amen. I'm
[18:00] not trying to treat you. I want you to
[18:02] to to hear yourself say it. The third
[18:05] pull is the opening of the word. It's
[18:07] not some great mystery you can't
[18:09] understand. It's not some big uh uh oh,
[18:12] that's a buzz word. You Oh, you got to
[18:14] be careful around that third pull stuff.
[18:17] Listen, the tradition is dead. It's
[18:19] dead. Amen. that we are alive with the
[18:22] resurrected one among us tonight and
[18:25] that third pool is the opening of the
[18:27] word which you are a part of by
[18:32] predestination. So then the message is
[18:34] what is opening up the true
[18:37] interpretation of your life. Why you are
[18:40] here is because of the message of the
[18:42] hour. You are written epistles that have
[18:45] been written by the hand of the living
[18:47] God. Spirit spoken sons and daughters of
[18:51] God. Amen. You are not a tape. You are
[18:54] not a book. You are a living epistle
[18:56] that has been read. Amen. Of all men.
[18:59] When men look around, they should be
[19:01] able to see manifested sons of God in
[19:05] the age we're living in. That's what
[19:07] this message produces. It does not
[19:09] produce church members. It does not
[19:11] produce leodysans. It produces
[19:14] manifested sons of the living God who
[19:17] operate under the divine power of the
[19:20] living God. Oh my. No. Tell him what
[19:22] will happen when the church fully comes
[19:24] under that word. Amen. Do you see that
[19:27] third pull is the opening of the word.
[19:28] The mysteries revealed. And there is not
[19:30] a higher order to reveal that word than
[19:32] a prophet. And the only way a prophet
[19:35] can be vindicated is by that word. And
[19:38] remember that third pull. Now watch, he
[19:40] didn't say it's the opening of the word.
[19:42] One place, now watch what he says, was
[19:44] the opening of them seven seals. So the
[19:46] opening of the word is the opening of
[19:48] seven seals.
[19:50] To reveal the hidden truth that's been
[19:53] sealed in the word. So the message is
[19:57] not bringing something that's not
[19:59] written in the word. It's revealed of
[20:03] what's hidden in the word. Amen. It's
[20:06] what's hidden in the word. It's the
[20:08] opening of the word. Now, brother
[20:10] Brandon will say it and look away to
[20:11] Jesus. Now, that's a powerful sermon.
[20:13] Look away to Jesus. He says it like
[20:16] this. He says, "Everyone knows the first
[20:18] was identified. Second has been
[20:20] identified." And we think real close you
[20:22] that are spiritual. And the Bible said
[20:24] that here is to him that has wisdom. The
[20:26] third pool is properly identified.
[20:30] We know where it is. The third pull is
[20:34] here
[20:36] now because because you've been birthed
[20:39] in a word church. That's not big news to
[20:43] you.
[20:45] You're waiting for the news and that
[20:46] means we done our job. That means you're
[20:49] a welltaught individual because you're
[20:52] like, "We know that, brother Wayne." And
[20:53] I say, "Thank God. Thank God that
[20:56] doesn't remain a mystery even in our
[20:58] young people." Amen. Because see, Amen.
[21:01] It's not just an emotional move
[21:04] happening in True Word Tabernacle. It is
[21:06] a word experience, a word birth. Now, we
[21:11] get awfully excited about that. But the
[21:13] basis of the word of God is where every
[21:17] heart can stand. No matter where we are,
[21:19] no matter what is happening, there's a
[21:21] there's a place to stand that you'll be
[21:23] able to stand against every w the enemy
[21:26] puts at you. The third pull is properly
[21:28] identified. So when somebody comes by
[21:30] and says, "Well, we're expecting Brother
[21:31] Bam to bring a big tent and you
[21:33] preachers need to just play tapes till
[21:34] it gets here." Amen. You know what you
[21:36] can say? Oh, wait a minute, buddy. Wait
[21:38] a minute. Brother Bam said the third
[21:39] pull was here back in 1963.
[21:43] They said, "Well, it's going to be this
[21:44] and it's going to be this and it's going
[21:46] to be this." And I tell them like this.
[21:47] I'm not going to argue about what it
[21:49] will be, but I certainly know it's here
[21:51] and what it's doing now. And that's what
[21:53] I'm interested in is it's doing exactly
[21:56] what he said it would do. It would
[21:58] create a bride and would be able to go
[22:00] home. Amen. To meet her, Isaac. I
[22:03] believe that. I believe the third pull
[22:05] is here. It's the opening of the word.
[22:07] Now, if you start using terms to kind of
[22:10] describe the third pull is the opening
[22:12] of the word. The third pull was
[22:14] preaching to souls in prison. Amen. And
[22:17] it's also the creation by the spoken
[22:20] word. Amen. Remember, brother Bam said
[22:23] the third pull is to the total lost. But
[22:26] it's for the bride. I like that one.
[22:29] It's to the lost, but it's for the
[22:32] bride. It's not for somebody else. It's
[22:35] for you. Other people will hear it.
[22:37] Amen. But it will be judgment to them,
[22:40] but rather it is a blessing to you. See,
[22:42] it's creation by the word. Now, what is
[22:45] that third pull? See, three pulls. First
[22:47] two pulls
[22:48] 1947, brother met the angel in the cave.
[22:51] received two pulls. But in 1956, he saw
[22:54] another vision which spoke of the third
[22:56] part of his ministry which would be the
[22:58] fulfillment of the scriptures of Luke 17
[23:01] and Malachi 4 and Revelations 10. It
[23:04] would be the fulfilling of it. And there
[23:06] is where God promised to meet the
[23:08] prophet was in the fulfilling of his
[23:10] word in the end time in this age. Now we
[23:14] know of five manifestations. Is that
[23:16] right? Five manifestations of the third
[23:18] pole. I'm just teaching a moment and
[23:19] we'll move along. But there's five
[23:21] manifestations. Now, probably any of our
[23:23] young people could name those five
[23:25] manifestations. If you start thinking a
[23:27] minute, five manifestations of that
[23:29] third pull where it made itself known.
[23:31] And brother Bamma identifies them in the
[23:34] sermon, look away to Jesus. Now, he's
[23:36] telling us that Jesus is the word
[23:39] interpreted. He's the word living word.
[23:42] So when he says look away to Jesus, he's
[23:45] not pointing you to the nailed scarred
[23:47] body of Nazareth. He says, "Look away to
[23:50] Jesus." And then starts naming the
[23:53] manifestations of the third pull that
[23:55] has happened among you. Amen. Now, let's
[23:58] let's just real quickly, I'm not going
[24:00] to preach through them because it take
[24:01] you all night just for those, but I'll
[24:02] just put out five of them. Remember, he
[24:04] created them squirrels, right? And then
[24:07] he spoke to that fish and then Amen.
[24:10] Then he spoke to that cancer and then he
[24:12] spoke to that storm and then he created
[24:15] squirrels. Amen. and and we we find five
[24:18] times uh that this was used, Amen, in a
[24:22] prophet's life. So I I I don't I you the
[24:25] potential is there for any believer all
[24:27] the time. But please don't think you're
[24:29] going to walk around every day and poof,
[24:31] you're gone and poof, you're gone and
[24:34] but because you you put the wrong
[24:36] interpretation to manifested sons and
[24:39] make it about just what you can do
[24:41] rather than what you can surrender to.
[24:45] Somebody said, "Well, amen. If it's
[24:46] that, it'd be a great big ministry.
[24:48] Brother Bram said Elijah didn't have
[24:49] that kind of ministry and even Jesus or
[24:52] Moses didn't. Jesus said, "I do that
[24:54] which pleases my father." He didn't just
[24:56] go around say, "I we'll do this and do
[24:58] this and do this and do this." He waited
[25:00] till the leadership come and then he
[25:03] followed it. I'm I'm I'm quoting
[25:04] scripture. John 14, Jesus said, "Yet a
[25:07] little while the world see me no more,
[25:08] but you shall see me for I will be with
[25:09] you even in you to the end of the
[25:11] earth." And then the Bible said Judas
[25:13] not as scariot said Lord how is it that
[25:15] you will show yourself unto the world a
[25:18] to us and the world not see you. He said
[25:20] because I will manifest myself unto you
[25:24] and he that loveth me will do my
[25:26] commandments. In other words when the
[25:28] word is fulfilled you'll be seeing me in
[25:31] the life of that believer. And the whole
[25:33] earth has been waiting for sons that can
[25:36] handle amen the very creative power of
[25:39] God. Amen. and not be arrogant and
[25:42] high-minded. Amen. But operate under the
[25:45] humility of the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[25:48] Now, I that's another whole sermon. But
[25:50] but we find out this. We we see that
[25:52] those manifestations, Amen. brought
[25:54] forth the proof that it was vindication
[25:57] that it was God speaking, not a man. You
[25:59] know, a man couldn't create. You know
[26:01] that. Now, the Bible tells us that what
[26:04] we were looking for was the opening to
[26:06] them seven seals. And I'll just say from
[26:07] the breach, brother Bam said the seven
[26:09] seal book. Remember it was closed in
[26:12] Revelations the 5th chapter and in
[26:15] Revelations the 10th chapter is opened.
[26:16] Have you ever noticed that a mighty
[26:18] angel comes down out of heaven. He has
[26:20] an open book in his hand. That open book
[26:23] of Revelations 10 is the closed book of
[26:26] Revelations 5. And brother Bam says,
[26:29] "Now we're going to see what the book
[26:31] says about how it become open." I love
[26:34] that. Don't you? Amen. He's going to
[26:36] take the book that's open and going to
[26:38] tell you how it became open. Amen. So
[26:41] what he's going to show you is is that
[26:44] his ministry is a part of the opening of
[26:47] that book. Now, brother Benam will say
[26:49] it this. He says, "Now it's not made
[26:51] until the l known until the lamb takes
[26:53] the book and breaks the seals and opens
[26:54] the book." And the lamb, he's got to
[26:56] take that book. Now it's hid. And
[26:58] remember, no man, no man in heaven or
[27:01] earth, no pope, no bishop, no cardinal,
[27:03] no state protest, wherever it is, can
[27:06] break them seals and reveal that book.
[27:08] But it's got to be the lamb, right?
[27:10] Amen. It's been probed at, presumed at,
[27:12] stumbled at, wondered at, and reasoned
[27:14] at. Amen. See, but something's got to
[27:18] come to tell us what it is.
[27:20] Vindicated truth. Yeah. With these
[27:24] divine promises, this this book of
[27:26] redemption will be perfectly opened by
[27:28] the lamb and the seals will be loose by
[27:30] the lamb in the last days in which we're
[27:32] living now. I love that. I love that. In
[27:36] the last days, which we are living now.
[27:40] In other words, it will be a complete
[27:41] secret until the seventh angel sounds.
[27:44] Amen. Somebody tells you they had the
[27:46] revelation of the book before brother
[27:48] Brandham had it. Forget it, man.
[27:52] Just forget it. Amen. Do you see what it
[27:55] is? Here's the book of redemption. Now,
[27:57] Brother Brandham preaching in the
[27:59] breach,
[28:00] 1963 on March the 17th. Boy, we're
[28:03] getting close, aren't we? He's preaching
[28:05] the breach, March the 17th. Amen. And
[28:07] it's the it's the introductory service
[28:10] to the seven seals. And he's making the
[28:13] breach between seven seals and the seven
[28:16] church ages. He He is standing in the
[28:19] gap, right? He's a prophet. He's the one
[28:23] in the breach. He's pulling together the
[28:26] dispensations. He's a John between the
[28:29] Old Testament and Jesus Christ. And he's
[28:32] pulling the dispensation. He is the gap.
[28:35] He's the breach between the two of them.
[28:37] And he's standing there preaching. Amen.
[28:40] The changing of the dispensation. Look.
[28:42] Now, what he's going to do is he's going
[28:44] to Amen. I I I if you ever listen to it,
[28:46] go to par paragraph 157 and hear what
[28:49] he's talking about. Revelations 5. And
[28:51] he said, "And a strong angel proclaiming
[28:53] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[28:56] the book and to take the book and was
[28:58] able to loose the seals?" He said, "The
[29:01] angel asked it." John saw it. He said,
[29:04] "And no one was worthy." Or maybe I'm
[29:08] just feeling this way. Brother Bram
[29:09] said, "But let him that's
[29:12] worthy." Amen. Let let him said the
[29:15] angel. Here's the book of redemption.
[29:17] Here's the plan of redemption. Here's
[29:19] the only way to ever be
[29:21] redeemed. Here's the title deed of
[29:24] redemption. The whole earth. Let him
[29:27] hold come forward now if he will. Let
[29:30] him speak or forever hold his peace. It
[29:32] sound like a wedding, don't it? Let him
[29:34] speak or forever hold his peace. Let him
[29:37] come forward and claim that book. Who is
[29:41] worthy to do it? Amen. That's pretty
[29:44] powerful, isn't it? Who is worthy to do
[29:47] it? Now, he's reading Revelations the
[29:49] 5th chapter and he's quoting that angel.
[29:52] Who is worthy to do it? Now, Brother
[29:54] Brandham is the one standing in the pull
[29:56] pit saying to the church, who is worthy
[30:00] to come and take the book? Let him that
[30:03] is come forward. Now, so he's telling
[30:06] I'm going to introduce the one that has
[30:09] the ability to open these things to the
[30:12] church of the living God. Now, what he's
[30:14] dealing with, watch the reason he says
[30:16] no man is worthy because he goes back
[30:18] into the breach and said, "Adam sin by
[30:20] heeding to his wife's reasoning."
[30:22] Instead of holding on to the word of
[30:23] God, that's what made Adam sin. His wife
[30:26] reasoned and he then produced to the
[30:29] product to Adam and Adam turned loose
[30:31] the word and sold out and lost his
[30:35] inheritance. When he lost his fellowship
[30:37] and the right to the tree of life now
[30:41] when he lost his life he lost the right
[30:44] to the inheritance in that life. Yeah.
[30:48] So there's an inheritance in life and
[30:50] Adam lost it when in other words he let
[30:53] me just say this book of Revelations 5
[30:55] and Revelations 10 was in the hands of
[30:58] Adam.
[31:00] Now now you were in that book and we're
[31:02] just going to use it and type it as a
[31:04] book. You were in that book then, right?
[31:07] And had Adam and Eve held on to that
[31:10] book, every one of you would have been
[31:12] manifest in the Garden of Eden by the
[31:14] spoken word.
[31:16] You would have bypassed your sex birth.
[31:18] You would have come in there by spoken
[31:20] word and you would have went directly
[31:22] into theophony to glorify it and you
[31:24] would have never ever had the trials
[31:26] that you have tonight. Amen. But Adam
[31:29] now, oh my goodness, he let the devil
[31:32] talk it out of him. He let Eve, can you
[31:36] imagine Eve holding the the very right
[31:39] entitled deed to the whole earth and and
[31:42] and Satan reasoned her out of it. She
[31:45] let it slip right out of her hands. Can
[31:47] you imagine? Now, now, now if you can
[31:50] see what it was that they released, you
[31:53] can see tonight what you receiving
[31:57] when you go back and you look and you
[31:58] say, "Oh my, they gave up the right to
[32:01] the tree of life. They gave up the
[32:02] fellowship with God. They gave up these
[32:05] wonderful things. They gave up the title
[32:06] deed of inheritance. They gave up the
[32:09] creation by the spoken word." If you can
[32:11] see what they gave up, you can see what
[32:14] you're being offered in the age that
[32:16] you're living in. This is the return of
[32:19] the title deed of redemption. And you
[32:21] are accepting what Eve turned down in
[32:24] the Garden of Eden. And let me say right
[32:26] now, there ain't no websites and there
[32:27] ain't no Jebusites and there ain't no
[32:29] YouTube going to talk this man out of
[32:32] their title deed of redemption to
[32:35] eternal life. I don't care what they got
[32:38] to say about it. I don't even want to
[32:39] hear what they say to God about Listen,
[32:41] if Eve would have turned around and
[32:42] walked away from that devil, Amen. she
[32:44] could have stayed in a paradise, but the
[32:47] devil talked her out of a paradise.
[32:49] Isn't it something tonight when the
[32:51] devil starts whispering to you and he'll
[32:53] talk you out of a paradise? I say
[32:55] tonight, what you ought to do is turn
[32:56] your ear off to that nonsense of that
[32:59] devil and hold on to the things of God
[33:02] that you might hold the tree of life by
[33:05] your hands. You got a right to it
[33:06] tonight. You got a right. That's what he
[33:09] lost and that's what Jesus was going to
[33:11] redeem for the church. Now watch because
[33:14] here we find out. Brother Bam said he
[33:16] lost his inheritance of the earth. He
[33:17] passed to the hands of of the devil,
[33:19] Satan. He sold his faith into God's to
[33:23] he sold his faith in God to Satan's
[33:25] reasonings. Therefore, the eternal life,
[33:27] his right to the tree of life, his right
[33:29] to the earth that belonged, he forfeited
[33:31] it into the hands. Now, you've often
[33:34] heard of us talk about redemptive
[33:36] rights. All right? That's why we call it
[33:39] redemptive rights is because it was
[33:42] forfeited rights by Adam and it's
[33:45] redeemed rights by Jesus Christ. So,
[33:48] what we're dealing with tonight is
[33:50] redemptive rights that belong to the
[33:51] church. We didn't have nothing to do
[33:53] with losing them and we don't have
[33:56] nothing to do with buying them back.
[33:58] Hallelujah. All we got to do tonight is
[34:01] accept what is being offered by the
[34:04] grace of God. You can't work this up,
[34:06] folks. And you can't work this up. Well,
[34:09] we'll get more love. You know, we'll get
[34:10] more brotherly love. We'll get more. We
[34:12] I tell you, when we get all the way up
[34:14] there, we're going to climb and climb
[34:15] and climb when we get up there. Come on,
[34:17] folks. Why does it say grace grace on
[34:19] the top of that pyramid? Because it'll
[34:22] be the grace of God that brings you up
[34:24] there. It'll have to be a message that
[34:26] lifts you out of the age that we're in
[34:29] by the word of God. Revelation striking
[34:31] the heart.
[34:33] Now, when that when that book left the
[34:36] hands of Adam, where'd it go? Brother
[34:37] Ram said it couldn't go to the hands of
[34:38] that greasy devil. He said it went back
[34:42] to the hands of the original owner and
[34:44] God himself held it because it had his
[34:47] possessions. It had it had the bride was
[34:51] in that book. He wasn't going to let the
[34:52] devil a hold of you. Do you know this?
[34:55] You never been lost a day in your life.
[34:59] Come on, church. The Bible said he died
[35:02] for you before the foundations of the
[35:05] world and put your name on the lamb's
[35:07] book of life before the foundations of
[35:10] the world. And you have never been in
[35:12] the hands of that greasy devil. Your
[35:14] first birth put you in the cosmos which
[35:17] belong to the devil. and you come under
[35:20] his claims and rights. But this message
[35:22] come to declare that before the devil
[35:24] ever got a hold of you, you belong to
[35:27] God and God's grace come upon your life.
[35:30] And we're here tonight to notify the
[35:32] devil, this message is here to bring the
[35:35] children of God back out of this cosmos
[35:37] and dead world that we're living in.
[35:40] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[35:43] I certainly believe it. Brother Bam said
[35:45] it went out of the hands of of of Adam
[35:47] into the hands of God. He said, "What's
[35:49] it doing there?" Waiting for redemption
[35:52] claims.
[35:53] Waiting for redemption claims. He made a
[35:56] way of redemption. He made a bay back.
[35:58] Someday there was going to be a redeemer
[36:00] bring it back. Amen. Now think about
[36:02] this. What does redemption means? The
[36:05] redemption of that book would mean
[36:07] everything that was legally lost, we now
[36:10] legally possess. Yeah. Amen. Everything
[36:12] that Adam and Eve lost. Amen. Oh my.
[36:15] What that ought to do to a born again
[36:17] Christian, the legal possession of that
[36:20] abstract title deed of eternal life
[36:22] means you possess everything that Adam
[36:25] and Eve lost. Whoa. What of it,
[36:28] brethren? The possession of that deed. I
[36:30] love Brother Francis years ago here. He
[36:32] he brought the three things. I thought
[36:34] they were great. Three things, right?
[36:36] The right to the tree of life, the right
[36:38] to fellowship. Amen. and the right to
[36:40] inheritance or life. Amen. What is it?
[36:43] Amen. We we we know this that that book
[36:46] was waiting. Now, if you read
[36:48] Revelations 5, go to Revelation 5 and
[36:50] verse one and let's watch uh uh the
[36:52] story that John tells when he sees this
[36:56] redemption process taking place. Watch
[36:59] what he says. Revelation 5:1, he said,
[37:01] "I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[37:03] on the throne a book written within on
[37:06] the backside sealed with seven seals."
[37:07] That's the book Adam had. Right? But the
[37:10] devil couldn't have it and God kept it.
[37:12] And brother Bram said it was waiting for
[37:14] redemption claims.
[37:16] He says, "But in the second verse, John
[37:19] being the bride said, I saw a strong
[37:21] angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who
[37:24] is worthy to open that book and to loose
[37:27] the seals thereof." Now, it's amazing if
[37:30] if if you don't throw me out now. I
[37:32] don't want to choke you to death, but
[37:34] you could hear that with your own ears
[37:36] on March the 17th of 1963
[37:40] when brother Brandham says, "Who is
[37:42] worthy to open this book, let him come
[37:45] now or forever?"
[37:49] There's only one seventh angel, folks.
[37:51] Amen. Had that had that book not been
[37:55] introduced at that time, there would not
[37:58] have been Amen. a redemption of the
[38:00] church.
[38:02] Now you said, "Brother Wayne, the cross,
[38:04] but Malachi 4 said unless he sends
[38:07] Elijah, the whole thing would be burn up
[38:09] by a curse." Is that right? Amen. Now,
[38:12] we'll get into it just a moment. Amen.
[38:14] He was able to say, "Let him come
[38:16] forward." Now, why was Brother Benham
[38:18] able to do it? because he knew it was
[38:20] his position to do it. That's right. And
[38:22] he knew what it required for something
[38:25] to take it. Now, when the Bible said who
[38:28] is worthy to take that book, I will say
[38:30] this, the worthiness of the one to take
[38:32] that book had to do with a right that
[38:34] someone had to have that book. And no
[38:36] different than if you went and pond your
[38:38] favorite gun and and and and you did it
[38:40] cheap because you want to hurry up and
[38:42] get down there and get it back and
[38:44] somebody else went down there and said,
[38:45] "Oh, you got that 45 caliber." They pond
[38:48] it for 100 bucks. I'll take it. The guy
[38:50] said, "No, you can't have it. You got no
[38:52] right to it."
[38:54] Just because it's in pond don't mean
[38:55] anybody can get it out. It takes the
[38:58] owner to do it. Or somebody with the
[39:01] ticket. Well, but you but you see that
[39:04] the scripture says that it had to be a
[39:08] kinsman. Now you know that word kinsman.
[39:11] It means in the Old Testament the law
[39:13] was that if something was lost now just
[39:16] real quickly in in the Old Testament God
[39:18] gave him the land of Israel and every 50
[39:21] years he restored it. It'd be like me. I
[39:22] give you a house and I say now if you
[39:24] get any debt on that house 50 years I'm
[39:26] going to clear all the debt and give it
[39:27] back to you. Yeah. That's that's exactly
[39:29] what God done with Israel. He said,
[39:31] "Every 50 years, I'll blow the trumpet
[39:32] and if you got any debts or you're you
[39:34] you you're sold out, you're going to go
[39:36] back because the land belonged to God
[39:38] and the people belong to God." And he
[39:39] said, "I can put you on there if I want
[39:41] to. I got the first act. I got the first
[39:43] right. So don't do dealings with those
[39:45] Jews cuz you're going to lose."
[39:48] Amen. Cuz God just forgives them and
[39:49] puts them back. Amen. Now, but but you
[39:52] watch. But but the people that redeemed
[39:54] it had to be a kinsman, right? They in
[39:57] other words, they had to have
[39:58] inheritance in the land. And and I'll
[40:00] just say this because God used Joshua to
[40:03] divide the land by families. So a family
[40:06] owned that portion of land, Reuben or or
[40:08] or or uh what whatever maybe tribe that
[40:11] they were under. They owned that portion
[40:13] and it stayed within that and and and
[40:15] it's a story laid out. My goodness, I
[40:17] hate time. But but the story is laid out
[40:19] in the book of Jeremiah when the
[40:21] children of Israel are going from
[40:23] Jerusalem to Babylon for 70 years. And
[40:26] God tells Jeremiah, "Sell your property
[40:29] to your cousin, your uncle's son,
[40:32] because when 70 years is up, we're going
[40:35] to come back and he's going to be able
[40:37] to have rights to this property." Right?
[40:40] So, the kinsmanship was there. Now, if
[40:42] you're if you're a student of the word,
[40:45] you're going to you're going to ask
[40:46] yourself, what is the process of
[40:48] redemption then? What what is the
[40:50] process of redemption that all the way
[40:52] in the end time 2,000 years after Christ
[40:55] that that book would still be in the
[40:57] hands of him that's on the throne? How
[41:00] is this possible? Because it's not until
[41:03] you go and study the book of Ruth. How
[41:05] many knows the book of Ruth is the book
[41:06] of redemption of the Bible? And you
[41:09] study the book of Ruth. Of course,
[41:10] people who study the book of Ruth, most
[41:12] of the most of the theologians says it's
[41:14] just a love story and it's of no
[41:16] pertinence at all to the church. But
[41:18] brother Brandham said there's a hidden
[41:20] revelation there. If you catch the
[41:22] meaning of it, it'll bring you close to
[41:23] God.
[41:25] Can I say it a little clearer to you? If
[41:27] you catch the revelation, it'll get you
[41:29] redemption.
[41:31] Redemption is what's hid in the book of
[41:33] Ruth of how that a gentile woman could
[41:37] become the wife of a great man in
[41:40] Israel. It stories written in here and
[41:43] and and Ruth is laid out. Now, if you
[41:45] don't know who Ruth is, Ruth and and the
[41:48] Bible calls her, I think, Ofra and and
[41:50] and Naomi. Now, Naomi was a woman who
[41:53] lived in Israel and had a wonderful
[41:55] family and and the and the Bible tells
[41:57] us that a famine come and they moved out
[42:00] and went down to Moab and she had a
[42:01] couple sons and they married into the
[42:03] families down to Moabs and and they was
[42:05] priests, Moab priests and things and uh
[42:08] uh uh they married the girls out of the
[42:10] out of the priesthood even and it was
[42:12] just a real mingling up. It wasn't long
[42:14] after they got down there, a holocaust
[42:16] struck. And I'll just give you a real
[42:17] quick run over the book of Ruth and and
[42:19] a holocaust struck. Of course, we see
[42:22] the same thing in the 1940s. Israel out
[42:25] of their homeland. Holocaust strikes.
[42:27] What's the first thing Israel do? They
[42:30] start returning home. When the Holocaust
[42:32] strikes Naomi, what she do? She heads
[42:35] home. Amen. And when she gets ready to
[42:37] go home, her daughter-in-laws are
[42:39] following her. She said, "Wait a minute.
[42:40] I don't have any sons to give you any
[42:42] seed. You might as well just stay in
[42:44] your country. Amen. And and and one of
[42:47] the daughter-in-laws said, "Oh, that'd
[42:48] be great. I'll go back to my old gods."
[42:50] Brother man said, "There's that
[42:51] borderline Christian." Turns around
[42:53] whenever little struggle comes up or
[42:55] little problem. Well, they go right back
[42:56] to the world, right back to God. Amen.
[42:59] But there was a roof there that couldn't
[43:01] be shook off. She said, "Wait a minute."
[43:03] No. She said, "I lodge where you lodge
[43:05] and I go where you go, and I cleave unto
[43:08] you." Brother Bram said, "There today is
[43:10] still real Ruth among the church." And
[43:13] those that have made their decision that
[43:15] no matter what happens, no, no matter
[43:17] what takes place, I'm I'm going to stay
[43:19] with Christ. He said, "There she is.
[43:20] That's that real Christian. That's that
[43:23] real, you know, preacher said something
[43:25] I don't like. I don't think I'm coming
[43:26] back." That wasn't Ruth.
[43:29] Matter of fact, if you read the story,
[43:31] Naomi tried to convince her to go back
[43:34] and she couldn't be persuaded. That
[43:36] sounds like Elisha, don't it? When
[43:38] Elijah said, "Just keep going back." He
[43:40] said, "No, sir. No, sir. There's a
[43:42] promise up ahead. I want a part of
[43:44] what's going on up there." A and the
[43:46] scriptures detail how Ruth Amen. A
[43:49] gentile moabitetist uh uh uh came into
[43:52] the land of Israel. Now, here's the
[43:54] beautiful part, folks. Do you know when
[43:56] she came back to Israel, she came in
[43:59] during harvest season? Yes, sir. And it
[44:02] was barley harvest season. Do you know
[44:04] what barley harvest is in Israel? It's
[44:06] Passover. That's when they come out of
[44:09] Egypt and also when they went in the
[44:11] promised land. Do you think it's mishap
[44:13] that this gentile woman is coming in
[44:16] with Naomi at the time of Passover and
[44:19] Exodus? When the when the church of the
[44:22] living God returns back to their true
[44:25] homeland of Christ, so does Israel. Now,
[44:28] I know the I know the scriptures and the
[44:30] Bible said in book of Matthew, I'm just
[44:32] going to preach. I ain't got time to
[44:33] read. You go in the book of Matthew and
[44:35] you see the Bible says that when you see
[44:37] the olive tree putting forth its
[44:38] branches, the fig tree, know the season
[44:40] is not. Even at the door. Is that what
[44:42] it says? Even at the door. Read the
[44:44] church ages. Behold, I come quickly.
[44:47] Behold, I come quickly. Behold, I come
[44:48] quickly. Seventh age, I stand at the
[44:53] door. What is it? Amen. It's the
[44:55] presence of his coming. So, the Bible
[44:57] said when the fig tree put forth their
[44:59] food. But it's another scripture in the
[45:00] book of Luke that said when the fig tree
[45:02] and all other trees put forth their for
[45:06] their fruit then you know the hour. So
[45:08] the gentile has a tree as well. And what
[45:10] is that gentile? Brother Brandon said it
[45:12] was Oral Roberts and Billy Graham and it
[45:14] was that last messenger. Amen. And they
[45:16] were bringing revivals. Now folks, I
[45:19] ain't left the thought yet. Because you
[45:21] see that the same time the Jews were
[45:24] returning to their homeland, the bride
[45:26] of Christ was getting a gentile prophet
[45:29] who was bringing them to the Boaz of
[45:33] Christ in this age. They was happening
[45:36] at the same time. Book of Ruth happened
[45:38] at the same time. And that time was a
[45:41] time of Passover. Y'all know what
[45:42] Passover is? It's new beginnings.
[45:45] So, she was going to get a brand new
[45:48] beginning. It was going to be all things
[45:50] passed away and behold, all things are
[45:52] becoming new. But it was going to be
[45:55] when she got into that land. Amen. She
[45:57] got there at the right timing.
[45:58] Hallelujah. I know God's got timing for
[46:01] the church. I I know it's right on time.
[46:04] Amen. And it's perfect in its order. And
[46:06] when she gets there, sure enough, it's
[46:08] seasoned. They're broke. They have
[46:10] nothing. And Naomi says to her, "I have
[46:13] a kinsman up on the hill. Let's just
[46:15] dramatize it." He says, "Go on up there
[46:18] and you go up and get into that field
[46:20] and start working." And the scripture
[46:21] tells us after she was out there working
[46:24] and she working in the field trying to
[46:25] glean a little bit of barley. Amen. Here
[46:28] comes Boaz descending on his horse. I
[46:32] like that. Don't you hear that?
[46:33] Descending. Amen. He started descending
[46:35] into that field. And so happened she was
[46:39] in the field he would descend into.
[46:42] Oh, come on, church. Y'all know the
[46:44] prophet said he's opening up to us now a
[46:47] new field, the field of the son of man.
[46:49] And if the bride is working in that
[46:52] field, it is the field of his
[46:54] descension. And as he's descending into
[46:56] the field, he asks, "Who is this woman?"
[46:59] And she's identified. And he gets
[47:01] interested.
[47:04] And he says, "How could I claim this
[47:05] woman? Yeah. How could I take her as my
[47:08] own? Who are you? Where are you from?
[47:11] Oh, Naomi is your mother-in-law.
[47:15] Now look at this. She ain't got any
[47:17] husband that can give her seed. Her
[47:19] husband's dead.
[47:23] Pentecost can't give seed to the bride.
[47:26] It's dead,
[47:28] right? And she needs to be redeemed. But
[47:32] no redemption is going to come outside
[47:35] of being pregnantated by the seed of
[47:37] that word. And watch what happens when
[47:39] she goes to Naomi. Now folks, you you
[47:42] hear the prophet and sometimes you hear
[47:44] him deeper. And I want to hear him
[47:46] deeper on this point. He said when Ruth
[47:49] went to Naomi and she said, "What should
[47:51] I do?" The Bible says Naomi instructed
[47:53] her in the law of kinsmen. She she
[47:56] taught her how to go into that field and
[48:00] then to go to his feet and taught her
[48:03] how the process to be redeemed. Brother
[48:07] said Naomi is a representative of the
[48:09] Old Testament teaching the New Testament
[48:13] bride the story of redemption. In other
[48:16] words, you don't know how Revelation 5
[48:18] works until you have read the book of
[48:21] Ruth. It is a process of redemption.
[48:24] It's not that he just plucked her out.
[48:26] It's the process of redemption. It goes
[48:29] through a process. Oh, you got something
[48:31] on your you got something on your credit
[48:32] score that you want to get off. It don't
[48:34] go poof gone. There's a process. You
[48:36] contact somebody, this happens, that
[48:38] happens, and it's removed. Amen. And to
[48:40] bring this bride back to glory. There
[48:43] was a process of the redemption of this
[48:46] bride. And that process began with
[48:49] Christ. When Christ come, watch what he
[48:51] done. He died on Calvar's tree, right?
[48:53] He died on the tree, but that was only
[48:56] the payment for your sins.
[48:59] That book was still in the hand of the
[49:01] father sitting on the throne, but the
[49:03] sin debt was paid. Listen, and he he
[49:06] took care of it. I I got a whole section
[49:08] I'll have to preach later on the merits.
[49:10] How many How many ever thought about the
[49:12] merit? How you going to get to heaven?
[49:14] You ever think about that? You ever you
[49:16] ever you ever study in Catholic
[49:18] doctrine?
[49:19] They got a whole treasury of merit.
[49:21] Y'all know that? Yeah. Do you know that
[49:23] when they baptize a Catholic, that's the
[49:26] work and process towards salvation,
[49:28] justification lays on the other side of
[49:31] of the communion and they go in through
[49:33] the sacraments and they start getting
[49:35] through the sanctify and they start
[49:36] building up merit to get to the place of
[49:39] justification that that what they really
[49:42] believe is you got to sanctify before
[49:44] you justify. Oh, how they missed it.
[49:48] Amen. Justification is by faith and
[49:50] faith alone. There is no merits outside
[49:54] of the marriage of Jesus Christ. There
[49:56] was no one worthy. The Bible said there
[50:00] was no man worthy. There's no angel
[50:02] worthy. There's nobody that could die
[50:04] for you but God. The God of glory.
[50:07] Brother Bam said he took on the robe
[50:09] form of a man and become kin folks to
[50:12] you and I that he might come down in
[50:14] humanity and die to shed his blood and
[50:17] he would buy and pay for you. Come on.
[50:21] Redemption buying back redeeming Ruth is
[50:23] redeeming the bride. How'd he do it? He
[50:25] had to buy you first. Just like you buy
[50:27] a car and pick it up later. He bought
[50:30] this bride that day at Calvary. There's
[50:33] a full price paid for you. He don't owe
[50:35] no debts on your life. Listen, he could
[50:38] come and get you tonight and he don't
[50:40] have to explain it to the devil. He
[50:42] could come and take you tonight and
[50:44] there's nothing that the devil can do
[50:46] about it because Satan has no claim on
[50:49] this bride.
[50:51] Hallelujah.
[50:53] Church, I'll tell you, it's proof in the
[50:55] Bible. Why did Jesus not let the devil
[50:58] give him the world? Just kneel and I'll
[51:01] give it. Brother Bram said, "Because the
[51:02] devil tried to steal it by giving it."
[51:05] Because if Jesus hadn't bought it, Satan
[51:07] would still have a claim on it. But when
[51:09] Jesus said, "I won't let you give it to
[51:12] me. I'm going to buy it because someday
[51:15] I'm going to come and get it and I ain't
[51:17] going to get no static. There won't be
[51:19] no bills due."
[51:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. See, Naomi
[51:27] was teaching Ruth.
[51:29] There's a process of redemption.
[51:32] It has to be kinsmen. And if the kinsman
[51:35] would agree to the redemption, then
[51:38] you're okay. Hallelujah. So, she just
[51:41] goes and finds Boaz and lays at his
[51:43] feet. You know the story. And Boaz
[51:45] covers her and she tells him, said, "I'm
[51:47] your kinsman. I'm Naomi's
[51:50] daughter-in-law, but my husband's dead
[51:51] and I need
[51:52] redeeming." And he wakes up the next
[51:54] morning about the rise of the sun. And
[51:57] he gives her six barrel uh six bushels
[52:01] of barley. Yeah. and sends her home.
[52:04] Yeah. With a sign, the labor's finished.
[52:10] What did he say, Ruth? What did he say?
[52:11] He said he would redeem me.
[52:14] You know what redeeming her meant?
[52:15] Buying Naomi. Paying the debts of Naomi.
[52:18] If Naomi's debts are paid, Ruth was
[52:20] going to be his wife. Him, man's buying
[52:23] his own bride. Yes, sir. That's right.
[52:27] But he says to her, "Look now, I'm going
[52:30] to do the work of a kinsman for you."
[52:32] And then then Ruth tells Naomi, said,
[52:34] "Well, he's going to do the work of a
[52:36] kinsman for me." She said, "Look, see
[52:38] the Old Testament says to her, the Old
[52:40] Testament says to you, if he said he
[52:43] would do it, rest."
[52:45] [Applause]
[52:47] Listen, listen. The the Bible, the Old
[52:50] Testament is telling you, the process of
[52:53] redemption is when he tells you, "I'm
[52:56] going to claim you, I'm going to redeem
[52:59] you, rest."
[53:02] Rest. Amen. Amen. The days of the labor
[53:05] of the church have finished. We have
[53:07] entered into our seven seal rest.
[53:10] Hallelujah. The book has come open. We
[53:12] know our name was in that lamb's book of
[53:14] life. Hallelujah. You got to rest. Amen.
[53:18] Listen. Hey, can can we just say it? He
[53:20] was going to marry her. She's going to
[53:22] rest. Amen. Now, now now the act of
[53:24] redemption, if you if you continue
[53:26] teaching, watch the process. Because
[53:28] there was one nearer kin than than him,
[53:31] right? Brother said, "That's the devil.
[53:32] He's more kin to you than God cuz the
[53:35] flesh."
[53:36] He said, "But he can't redeem you." So,
[53:39] he turned down redemption. And Naomi had
[53:42] one closer. Yeah. But he wouldn't take
[53:44] her because he didn't want to mar his
[53:46] inheritance.
[53:48] I tell you, you can't mar the
[53:49] inheritance of Jesus. He redeemed the He
[53:52] redeemed the lowest one on the street
[53:55] and you'll never change. You'll never
[53:56] bring him down. He'll bring you up.
[54:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It don't matter
[54:01] how low he marries. He'll bring you up.
[54:05] Amen. That's the way the bride's going
[54:07] to rapture. He's going to marry you low
[54:10] and bring you up. Come on, church. He
[54:13] ain't coming down to our nonsense. He's
[54:16] lifting us up to his glory and his
[54:19] presence and his reality. Thank you,
[54:21] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[54:24] Listen, what what happens is is Boaz
[54:27] marries this girl, takes her, but but he
[54:29] has to redeem her. You know the story.
[54:32] You know the story. The near kinsman
[54:33] said, "I won't take her." And Boaz said,
[54:35] "I will." So, what was the act? What was
[54:37] the
[54:38] process? It was a testimony to 10
[54:41] elders. He had to go before 10 elders
[54:44] and tell them, "I'm king. I'm going to
[54:48] pay the debts." And those 10 elders had
[54:51] to agree he was worthy. Yes, sir. And
[54:55] that's why you get a pre-approval before
[54:57] you put an offer on a house.
[55:01] Don't go look at a house. If you ain't
[55:02] got pre-approval, they don't want to
[55:03] hear it. You might not be able to pay
[55:06] it, man.
[55:08] But when they saw he can pay the debts,
[55:11] Yeah, he's a kinsman to her. His part of
[55:15] that besides he had to pay the price.
[55:18] The blood had to be shed, but then he
[55:20] had to testify, she belongs to me.
[55:24] I take her. This is my kinsman. The
[55:28] testimony had to come after the payment.
[55:31] Hallelujah. Watch now. Amen. For all
[55:34] these years since the cross, the blood,
[55:37] the payment of the church has been
[55:39] laying there. But he has never took the
[55:41] book. He has never stood up and
[55:44] testified, amen, to the kinsmen to this
[55:47] gentile church. But in the last days,
[55:50] according to this Bible in Revelations
[55:53] 5, at the time of the sounding of the
[55:55] seventh angel, that the lamb would take
[55:57] that book and the first act that he
[56:00] would do is he would testify to the
[56:02] church and he would tell you, listen, I
[56:05] I I know I don't I don't want to preach
[56:06] too fast. Forgive me, but it's just all
[56:08] over me. Amen.
[56:12] He's in heaven and and you know you the
[56:15] people that are taught know there's 24
[56:17] elders there apostles and disciples and
[56:19] they're up there in heaven. They all
[56:21] know the laws of redemption. They all
[56:23] know what's required. Amen. And when he
[56:27] begins to testify when he stands up in
[56:29] Revelations 5 and takes the book, what
[56:31] does the Bible say? They threw down
[56:33] their crowns and said worthy. That's
[56:37] right. Worthy. In other words, you've
[56:39] got the right to do it. You've got the
[56:41] payment to do it. You got the ability to
[56:43] do it. You can do what you want to. They
[56:46] belong to you. You're king. You paid.
[56:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When that word
[56:51] worthy come over there, listen. It meant
[56:54] he had a right. That's right. He had a
[56:57] right to marry. Now watch in Revelations
[57:00] 5. You watch how the scripture says it.
[57:01] No man was able to do it. And John wept
[57:04] much. Amen. And one of the elders
[57:06] finally said, "Don't weep about this,
[57:07] for the lion, the tribe of Judah, hath
[57:09] prevailed to open this book, and to
[57:11] loose the seals thereof. And I beheld in
[57:13] the lost of the throne, four beasts in
[57:15] the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[57:16] being slain, having seven horns, seven
[57:18] eyes, which are the seven spirits of God
[57:20] sent forth in the earth." In Revelation
[57:22] 5:7, he said, "And he came
[57:25] and he took the book."
[57:29] Do you know that happened in your
[57:31] generation? Yeah. You see, that's what
[57:34] happened in our day. People say, "What's
[57:36] the message about?" He came and he took
[57:39] the book. This is the second part of
[57:42] redemption. This is the final process of
[57:45] the church going into the rapture. This
[57:47] is more than just a Pentecostal meeting.
[57:50] It's more than Baptist and Lutheran and
[57:52] Methodist and teaching and church
[57:54] joining. It's the rapture of the church.
[57:57] It's the marriage of the bride.
[58:00] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I'm excited. It's
[58:02] marriage time for the church of the
[58:04] living God. It means we can secure our
[58:07] future in God.
[58:12] Amen. Now, I'm I'm quoting the breeze.
[58:14] He took the book glory, opened that
[58:16] book, tore off the seals, and sent it
[58:18] down to the earth to the seventh angel
[58:22] to reveal it to his people. There you
[58:24] are. What is it? This message claims the
[58:27] inheritance of this bride. See, today
[58:30] this message is the calling out of the
[58:32] bride. That's what it's doing. It's
[58:34] calling you out. Why is it calling you
[58:36] out? It's calling you out to marry.
[58:39] And when when you when you study it when
[58:42] you study it, brother Brandham said, "To
[58:43] the elected, God's calling." And
[58:46] remember, he'll say this. He says, "See,
[58:49] this brings these books into
[58:51] view." And when the preaching of this
[58:54] message goes forward, it's the calling
[58:56] of the name. That's why you maybe don't
[58:59] understand all the doctrine,
[59:03] but you understand it's right,
[59:08] brother. I can't put all them quotes
[59:09] together, but oh, when you do, it sure
[59:12] drops something inside my soul.
[59:17] What is that? That's that's him calling
[59:20] you.
[59:22] And that call was so great
[59:25] that the that the world lost its pull
[59:28] and the power of God became a greater
[59:31] pull. Not a first pull, not a second
[59:34] pull, a third pull. And it was greater
[59:37] than all the other pulls in your life.
[59:42] That preaching would call your name. It
[59:44] will be called the word of his power.
[59:47] Improving his word. Brother Bam said the
[59:48] bridegroom call will come right through
[59:50] this. When the son of man will come down
[59:52] in human flesh and unite the two
[59:54] together, the church has to be the word
[59:56] and he is the word and the two unite
[59:59] together. It'll take the manifestation
[1:00:01] of the revealing of the son of man. How
[1:00:03] many knows in that very quote he says
[1:00:05] that the marriage takes place here.
[1:00:07] Yeah.
[1:00:10] Didn't know when you was listening to
[1:00:12] this message and you were a man, you was
[1:00:14] getting married, did you?
[1:00:17] That's exactly what's happening. Amen.
[1:00:20] He's the word. Amen. You're the hearer.
[1:00:23] And when you hear and accept the word,
[1:00:25] you become one under a unity with the
[1:00:30] word of God, which is the final act of
[1:00:33] redemption of the last days. Amen. What
[1:00:36] is it? It's it's bringing forth. Now, I
[1:00:38] love how this and I I hope you can see
[1:00:40] the continuity here. The invisible union
[1:00:42] of the bride. Watch Brother Bram say it.
[1:00:44] Your name is now in the new book, the
[1:00:46] book of the life. But the lamb's book of
[1:00:48] life, what the lamb redeemed, not the
[1:00:50] old book, your natural union, but your
[1:00:52] new bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is
[1:00:55] in the lamb's book of life. Your
[1:00:57] marriage certificate.
[1:01:01] This book of Revelations 5 that's closed
[1:01:04] is open in 10 is your marriage
[1:01:07] certificate.
[1:01:09] Wow.
[1:01:11] Now, now, now, no
[1:01:14] wonder the Bible in Revelations 19, give
[1:01:17] me a few minutes and we'll close.
[1:01:18] Revelations 19, watch what he said. Let
[1:01:20] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:01:22] him for the marriage of the lamb has
[1:01:24] come. How many knows that's right? In
[1:01:26] the time of the 60s up through right
[1:01:28] now, the marriage of the lamb hath come.
[1:01:30] He had granted that she would be arrayed
[1:01:32] in fine linen, clean and white, and
[1:01:34] righteousness of the saint. Now, watch
[1:01:36] this. And he saith unto me, right?
[1:01:38] Blessed are they that are called under
[1:01:39] the marriage supper of the lamb. He
[1:01:40] saith unto them, these are the true
[1:01:42] sayings of God. And I fell at his feet
[1:01:46] to worship him.
[1:01:48] And he said unto me, see thou do it not.
[1:01:50] I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:01:52] brethren that had the testimony of
[1:01:54] Jesus. Worship God.
[1:01:57] For the testimony of Jesus is a spirit
[1:01:59] of prophecy. Watch the Watch that
[1:02:00] seventh verse. Be glad and
[1:02:03] rejoice. Watch him command them.
[1:02:05] Marriage. Be glad and rejoice. Marriage
[1:02:08] certificate is the opening of that word.
[1:02:12] Right? Watch him. But don't worship me.
[1:02:17] Be glad and rejoice but don't worship
[1:02:21] me.
[1:02:22] But he didn't say don't worship.
[1:02:25] He said worship God.
[1:02:27] Right? Don't worship me. Worship God.
[1:02:31] Amen. I I love it. Brother brother
[1:02:32] quoted it uh quoted it Sunday. I want to
[1:02:35] quote it to you because I want to show
[1:02:36] you something I think is beautiful.
[1:02:38] Brother Bam says, "You see, I've seen
[1:02:40] jumping spells, joy spells, but there
[1:02:42] wasn't nobody hurt." See, the mountains
[1:02:44] run up, the sun went down, everything
[1:02:46] took place, but there was nobody hurt. I
[1:02:48] seen meetings go where the power of God
[1:02:50] was revealed to the people. They were
[1:02:51] free from the world and things of the
[1:02:53] world, and the joy of the Lord filled
[1:02:54] the congregation. They stood and
[1:02:56] screamed and cried and shouted to the
[1:02:58] top of their voices for the glory of
[1:02:59] God. And I never did see anything
[1:03:02] disorderly, right?
[1:03:04] that was always right in order. And I
[1:03:07] always wondered about that cuz I know
[1:03:10] church order. Holy Spirit don't get out
[1:03:12] of order. The church does, right? So I
[1:03:14] always wondered why would Brother Bram
[1:03:16] take such a chaos of worship and say
[1:03:19] it's in order.
[1:03:21] But if you watch what he talks about, he
[1:03:23] says, watch now. It was in order because
[1:03:25] they had recognized
[1:03:28] that their name had been written on the
[1:03:31] lamb's book of life from before the
[1:03:33] foundation of the world. They had
[1:03:35] recognized their name was on the lamb's
[1:03:38] book of life before the foundation of
[1:03:40] the world. So it is in order to worship.
[1:03:42] That's right. It is in order to shout
[1:03:44] and rejoice. Amen. It's not out of
[1:03:47] order. It's in order. Look, look what he
[1:03:50] says. Rejoice. The marriage of the lamb
[1:03:53] hath come. Don't worship a prophet.
[1:03:56] Worship God. Look, look what he's doing.
[1:03:59] Amen. He's trying to show you. Brother
[1:04:01] Bam takes that woman at the well. Now,
[1:04:02] this is very uh very pertinent to where
[1:04:05] we're standing. He said she took that uh
[1:04:08] woman at the well and he said when he
[1:04:10] began to give that messiah sign, he said
[1:04:12] she recognized her name was on there.
[1:04:15] That's right. She recognized it and a
[1:04:17] spark went off. Remember what she done?
[1:04:19] She threw down her pale and went running
[1:04:20] into the city. Come see a man. What was
[1:04:23] it in John chapter 4? What Jesus say? He
[1:04:25] said, "The hour has cometh and now is
[1:04:28] that worshippers must worship in the
[1:04:30] spirit and truth." So there was an hour
[1:04:33] when the son of man was on the earth,
[1:04:35] but he's back at the whale again. Amen.
[1:04:38] A dispensational change has taken place
[1:04:41] and the church must worship in spirit
[1:04:43] and in truth. Now watch. Amen. I hope
[1:04:46] you wore your joy shoes tonight. Amen.
[1:04:49] You got them on. Amen. Brother man said
[1:04:51] if you got your joys on, your joy shoes
[1:04:54] on. Listen, if you're a Christian, then
[1:04:56] Amen. That's not no preacher. That's the
[1:04:58] Bible. It said your name was in the
[1:05:00] lamb's book of life from before the
[1:05:02] foundation of the world. The same time
[1:05:04] that Christ that God sent him slain, he
[1:05:06] wrote your name in there. Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] Hallelujah. Before the foundation of the
[1:05:11] world. You said, "Preacher, what are you
[1:05:13] talking about?" Let's watch another
[1:05:14] scripture. Revelation's the 22nd
[1:05:16] chapter. This is the unsealing the book,
[1:05:18] isn't it? Revelation 22. Watch the
[1:05:19] eighth verse. And I, John, saw these
[1:05:21] things and heard them, and I had heard
[1:05:24] and seen, and I fell down to worship
[1:05:26] before the feet of the angel who showed
[1:05:27] me these things. It was a time of
[1:05:29] worship for sure. He said unto me, but
[1:05:32] don't do it. Right? I'm my fellow
[1:05:35] servant, the brethren, and the prophet,
[1:05:36] which keeps the sayings of these books,
[1:05:38] worship God.
[1:05:40] Watch. Don't seal these things. Let them
[1:05:44] thunder now. Let the seals become
[1:05:46] unsealed. Let the worship begin in the
[1:05:49] house of God. We're at rest. Listen,
[1:05:53] we're not wanting. We're not sitting on
[1:05:55] the edge of our seat wondering who won
[1:05:56] the football game. We know who won.
[1:06:01] I
[1:06:04] won. Brother Ray last night telling his
[1:06:06] testimony. I'm going to steal your
[1:06:07] thunder on this one. He he was telling
[1:06:09] his testimony. He said he was remembers
[1:06:10] when World War II ended. He said he was
[1:06:13] out in the field. He said, "Man, the
[1:06:14] phone call came and I don't remember who
[1:06:16] was your uncle. I think he said it was
[1:06:18] or somebody. The feed grinder. The feed
[1:06:20] grinder. He stopped what he's doing
[1:06:21] around the field. The war's over. War's
[1:06:24] over. War's over. I feel like taking a
[1:06:26] mic tonight and telling you the war's
[1:06:29] over. The war is over. It's been a
[1:06:31] victory day. This book has been opened.
[1:06:34] We have been redeemed. It's in order to
[1:06:36] rejoice. It's in order to shout. It's an
[1:06:39] order to release your emotions before
[1:06:43] God. Come on, friends. This is not a
[1:06:46] Pentecostal church. This is a word
[1:06:48] church.
[1:06:52] Don't never forget they're twins. Don't
[1:06:54] never forget that. Pentecostal churches
[1:06:57] shout. Pentecostal churches dance.
[1:07:00] Pentecostal church has good music. They
[1:07:02] have atmosphere of worship and praise.
[1:07:05] They got all kinds of things. But what
[1:07:06] they ain't got is they ain't got the
[1:07:09] word of the hour under the seven seal
[1:07:12] messenger. And listen, this twin, this
[1:07:14] twin has the word of the hour, the
[1:07:17] token, the birthright. Hallelujah. You
[1:07:20] said, "Preacher, what are you talking
[1:07:21] about?" Can I say it to you real plain?
[1:07:23] Amen. You can go in a Pentecostal church
[1:07:25] and let that thing be as high as the
[1:07:27] heavens. Amen. And as long as you're
[1:07:28] singing, it'll go right good. You start
[1:07:31] breaking into this opening of the word
[1:07:33] and they'll clam up on you and come the
[1:07:35] quietest people in the earth. But you
[1:07:37] start preaching this open book among the
[1:07:39] bride of Jesus Christ and she'll start
[1:07:42] getting higher and higher and higher and
[1:07:45] higher. What is it? The message produces
[1:07:49] a revival in the heart of the
[1:07:52] church. It's the word. The word does the
[1:07:56] preaching in this age. I say this.
[1:07:58] Somebody said, "Well, amen. Brother
[1:07:59] Wayne, you are not worshiped the way you
[1:08:01] do." Now, you can condemn me by
[1:08:02] tradition, but you can't condemn me by
[1:08:05] this word. As this word said, when the
[1:08:07] book opened, don't worship brother
[1:08:09] Brandham. Worship God. When the when the
[1:08:12] seals were opened up, Amen. When the
[1:08:14] marriage comes, rejoice.
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:20] What are you? Amen. What are you What
[1:08:22] are you talking about? Can I read it to
[1:08:24] you? Yes, sir. I'm going to quit. I
[1:08:25] really am. And he came and took the book
[1:08:28] out of the right hand. Fifth fifth
[1:08:29] chapter, seventh verse. And he came and
[1:08:31] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:08:33] him that sat on the throne. And when he
[1:08:35] had taken the book, the four beasts, and
[1:08:36] 24 elders, fell down before the lamb,
[1:08:38] having one of them harps, and golden
[1:08:41] vows full of odors, which are the
[1:08:42] prayers of the saints, and they sung a
[1:08:45] new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
[1:08:50] take the book, and to open the seals
[1:08:52] thereof. Thou was slain, and has
[1:08:55] redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of
[1:08:57] every kindred, tongue, people, and
[1:08:58] nation, and hast made us unto our God,
[1:09:02] kings, and priests. and we shall reign
[1:09:04] on the earth. Amen. How many knows in
[1:09:06] Revelations one when he's thanking God
[1:09:07] for the blood, he said, "Jesus shall
[1:09:09] reign." But when the seals come open, he
[1:09:11] saw his name was in the title deed and
[1:09:14] it wasn't Jesus going to reign by
[1:09:16] himself. He knew John knew I'm going to
[1:09:18] reign and this bride is going to reign.
[1:09:21] Amen. And behold, I heard the voice of
[1:09:23] many angels around about the throne and
[1:09:25] the beast and the elders. And the number
[1:09:26] of them was 10,000 time 10 thousands and
[1:09:29] thousands of them saying with a loud
[1:09:31] voice, who is worthy? Worthy is the lamb
[1:09:35] that was slain to receive power and
[1:09:37] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:09:38] and glory and blessing. Every creature
[1:09:41] which is in heaven and on the earth and
[1:09:43] under the earth such as are in the sea.
[1:09:45] And all them heard I saying, who's I?
[1:09:48] That's me. The bride. John heard the
[1:09:52] they heard the bride saying blessing and
[1:09:55] honor and glory and power be unto them
[1:09:57] that sitth on the throne and unto the
[1:10:00] lamb forever more. And the four beast
[1:10:01] said, "Amen." And the four and 20 elders
[1:10:03] fell down and begin to worship him that
[1:10:05] liveth forever and ever. What was going
[1:10:07] on? Brother man said it like this. John
[1:10:10] worshiped him. He said, "Until every
[1:10:12] creature in the heaven and under the
[1:10:14] earth heard me saying blessing and glory
[1:10:16] and honor and wisdom unto the Lamb." I
[1:10:19] don't think you've I don't think you've
[1:10:21] reached your pinnacle until everything
[1:10:23] in the earth and everything in the
[1:10:25] heaven and everything under the earth
[1:10:27] heard me John saying blessings and glory
[1:10:30] and honor and worthy is the lamb of God.
[1:10:34] This message is coming from God to
[1:10:36] redeem the church.
[1:10:41] So Wayne, it's out of time. It's not.
[1:10:43] This is the time when everything must
[1:10:45] worship. remember how appropriate.
[1:10:49] That's why brother Ram said it wasn't
[1:10:51] out of order because it's actually
[1:10:53] appropriate at this time. At the time of
[1:10:56] the opening of that book, it becomes
[1:10:58] appropriate. Don't let us miss this now.
[1:11:00] When all the mysteries of the church has
[1:11:02] been finished, when all the mysteries
[1:11:03] and the plans of redemption and the
[1:11:05] seals were opened right immediately.
[1:11:07] Now, look, it's time for everything in
[1:11:10] heaven and everything on earth to
[1:11:12] worship God. Watch what takes place.
[1:11:14] Listen, they sung a new song, thou art
[1:11:16] worthy. Listen at what a worship that
[1:11:19] was. The elders and the beast and
[1:11:22] everything fell right before him like
[1:11:24] that. When he made his complete plan,
[1:11:27] it's time to worship now. Look at this.
[1:11:31] When he finished his plan, it's time to
[1:11:35] worship now. Look what he's telling the
[1:11:37] church. The plan is finished. Amen.
[1:11:40] Become that. Which which gives it I I
[1:11:42] love how Brother Bam says it. He said,
[1:11:44] "Listen now. Listen at what John did."
[1:11:47] That's kind of good English, ain't it?
[1:11:48] Listen what John did. Every creature in
[1:11:51] heaven, in earth, and under the earth,
[1:11:53] and all that was in them heard blessings
[1:11:55] and honor and power unto him that sat on
[1:11:57] the throne of the lamb. John must have
[1:11:59] really had a Pentecost of his own.
[1:12:04] He said, "Every creature in heaven,
[1:12:05] every creature in earth, everything
[1:12:06] beneath the earth was in the sea heard
[1:12:08] me saying, "Amen." And glory and honor
[1:12:13] and power and blessings to be him that
[1:12:16] siteth upon the throne. Would you stand
[1:12:19] to your feet with us tonight?
[1:12:23] Appropriate worship.
[1:12:26] Oh yes. For him that has redeemed us.
[1:12:31] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:35] Can you imagine what it was smelt like?
[1:12:41] That
[1:12:42] room, little harlot with
[1:12:44] a with a bottle of ointment in her hand.
[1:12:50] She just broke the top off of it.
[1:12:52] Hallelujah.
[1:12:54] She poured it all on him.
[1:12:59] She lost herself in it. Y'all any y'all
[1:13:01] ever do that? She lost herself in it.
[1:13:05] She got the snotting and the crying and
[1:13:08] and her washing his feet and taking her
[1:13:10] glory and wiping his hair and all them
[1:13:13] people were saying, "Look at her."
[1:13:17] Must have been a
[1:13:20] moment. I I I I know the feeling.
[1:13:24] There must have been a
[1:13:26] moment when she looked
[1:13:37] up. Was that
[1:13:41] wrong? Too wrong.
[1:13:43] oil and sweat and tears and
[1:13:46] snot hair.
[1:13:52] And all of a sudden, Jesus looks over at
[1:13:54] one of the Pharisees and he said, "I got
[1:13:57] much things to say unto you."
[1:14:02] Cuz they were thinking, "If he knew who
[1:14:04] she was,
[1:14:08] right? If he knew what kind of person
[1:14:12] that was. Wow.
[1:14:15] He wouldn't let her do that. Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] But see, yeah, she wasn't the one
[1:14:24] worthy.
[1:14:28] Right. Hallelujah. He was
[1:14:33] He was the one worthy. Amen. Listen, I
[1:14:36] want to tell you something tonight.
[1:14:39] You're never going to be worthy of that.
[1:14:45] But he's always going to be worthy.
[1:14:48] [Music]
