[5:38] out. Amen. That's our welcoming prayer
[5:42] to him that he would just pour his
[5:44] spirit out upon us. Amen. A a place that
[5:47] he would be able to to fill our hearts.
[5:50] And we just want to tonight if we can
[5:53] just to bow our hearts for a word of
[5:55] prayer.
[5:56] Father, it is such an honor to come into
[5:59] your house tonight to have the
[6:01] privilege, Lord, to be able to gather
[6:04] together with such a wonderful group,
[6:06] Lord,
[6:07] and love you. And Father, they have
[6:10] found this message to be the answer to
[6:13] their
[6:14] hearts. And Lord, I just pray tonight
[6:17] that you would help us as we have looked
[6:18] upon these things that you would bring
[6:21] the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[6:23] among us, Lord. that you would speak to
[6:26] the needs, Lord, that you would develop
[6:28] these thoughts and that you would feed,
[6:31] Lord, the inner part of man. And Father,
[6:34] as we bow our hearts in your presence,
[6:36] we we recognize the great need of you
[6:39] upon these things. And we'd ask, Lord,
[6:41] that as your children eat the bread, may
[6:43] it be like it was in the Exodus, Lord.
[6:46] May there not be a feeble one among us,
[6:48] Lord. May you heal the bodies. May you
[6:51] take care of the needs. Father, we ask
[6:54] you for your great mercy upon each of
[6:56] them. Father, we ask tonight that you
[6:58] would touch our brother Johnson, Lord,
[7:00] that you would bless him. And Father, uh
[7:04] I ask that your grace would be upon him.
[7:07] And Lord, as we look to you for the for
[7:10] the meat of each need, we ask it in
[7:13] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. And God
[7:17] bless you. Amen. Uh I was going to read
[7:20] this. appreciate everyone's prayers for
[7:22] brother Samuel Johnson. He was admitted
[7:24] yesterday into the hospital and he is in
[7:26] pretty rough shape. He needs a real
[7:28] touch from the Lord. Amen. So, just keep
[7:31] him in mind and prayer. Amen. God bless
[7:34] you tonight if you have your Bibles with
[7:36] you. Um I'd like to uh if I could speak
[7:39] a little bit further on the subject
[7:41] there um from Sunday. Um, of course I'm
[7:45] in a bit of a series right now looking
[7:47] at the opening of the word. And uh,
[7:49] Sunday I was showing of God's provided
[7:53] uh, and providence or his provision in
[7:56] the time of famine. Tonight I want to
[7:57] speak to you, if I title it, I want to
[7:59] talk to you on feeding on the secret
[8:02] things of God. And uh if we can look in
[8:05] Revelations the 10th chapter, I'd like
[8:08] to read the uh seventh verse down to the
[8:10] 11th and also the book of Matthew the
[8:13] 4th chapter and the fourth
[8:15] verse. But in the days of the voice of
[8:18] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[8:21] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[8:24] finished as he has declared unto his
[8:26] servants the prophets. And and the voice
[8:28] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[8:31] again, and said, "Go and take the little
[8:34] book, which is open in the hand of the
[8:36] angel, which standeth upon the sea, and
[8:39] upon the earth." And I went unto the
[8:42] angel, and said unto him, Give me the
[8:45] little book. And he said unto me, Take
[8:48] it, and eat it up, and it shall make thy
[8:52] belly bitter, but it shall be in thy
[8:54] mouth sweet as honey. Now that is the
[8:56] book that they couldn't touch in
[8:58] Revelations 5. And now since that the
[9:01] angel, the seventh angel has revealed
[9:03] it, John has been invited to take it and
[9:06] eat it up. And he said, "And I took the
[9:09] little book out of the hand, out of the
[9:12] angel's hand and ate it up." Now,
[9:14] Brother Brandham actually uses this uh
[9:17] place and he says that these revelations
[9:20] are coming to us. He said from the hand
[9:23] of vindication.
[9:25] So when you reach to take this book,
[9:27] you're taking a revelation from the hand
[9:30] of vindication.
[9:32] That's what you're doing. So he said,
[9:34] "Give me the book." And he took it to
[9:35] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[9:37] but it shall be as sweet in thy mouth.
[9:38] 10th verse. And I took the little book
[9:40] out of the angel's hand. And I ate it up
[9:44] and it was in my mouth. He one place he
[9:46] says, "Do it and it shall be." Now he's
[9:48] doing it and found as it was. And he ate
[9:51] it up and it was in my mouth sweet as
[9:53] honey. And as soon as I had eaten, my
[9:55] belly was bitter. And he said unto me,
[9:57] "Thou must prophesy again before many
[10:00] peoples and nations and tongues and
[10:02] kings." Let's also look at Matthew the
[10:05] 4th chapter and the fourth verse. Of
[10:08] course, this is the great temptation of
[10:10] the Lord. And when Satan is coming
[10:12] against him uh and he has asked uh the
[10:14] Lord, Satan has asked the Lord to uh to
[10:17] make a stone into bread. And the Lord
[10:20] answered him and said, "It is written
[10:22] that man shall not live by bread alone,
[10:26] but by every word that proceedth out of
[10:30] the mouth of God." Amen. May God bless
[10:32] his word tonight as you be seated.
[10:34] Again, I'd like to talk to you a bit on
[10:36] feeding on the secret things of God.
[10:39] Amen. Now, of course, this this opening
[10:42] of the word that we've been speaking
[10:43] about, of course, is the divine
[10:45] provision of the age. It's the it's the
[10:48] word that has proceeded out of the mouth
[10:51] of God. Amen. It's what God has given
[10:53] for us. When brother Bam preaches the
[10:55] message spiritual food in due season, he
[10:57] actually talks about how that Elijah
[11:00] visited a gentile woman uh the the widow
[11:03] of in Sarapet there. And when he visited
[11:06] her, amen, that it was in the time of a
[11:08] judgment and it was a time of famine.
[11:11] Amen. But because that she gave unto
[11:14] Elijah, amen, it was predicted that her
[11:17] mill barrel would never run dry and her
[11:19] curse of oil would never run out. Now,
[11:21] of course, Brother Brandham is typing
[11:24] spiritual food in due season. He's
[11:25] talking about Elijah of that day. But,
[11:28] you know, he's talking about his own
[11:30] ministry and how that it was to a widow
[11:32] then in the time of famine. And he then
[11:35] tells us that according to the Bible
[11:37] that there is a a famine prophesied in
[11:39] the last days in Amos the 8th chapter,
[11:42] the both the 11th and the 12th verse
[11:44] speaks of this. But the Bible said, "The
[11:46] days come, sayaeth the Lord, that I will
[11:48] send a famine in the land, and will not
[11:50] be a famine of bread, nor thirst for
[11:52] water, but for the
[11:54] hearing of the words of the Lord." Amen.
[11:57] For the hearing of the words of the
[11:59] Lord. When brother Brandham describes
[12:00] that famine, he actually tells us that
[12:03] America now is the place that Amos saw
[12:06] and prophesied of. And when he
[12:09] prophesied of that, brother Brandham
[12:10] beyond the curtain of time actually will
[12:12] tell us or curtain of time will tell us
[12:14] the secret. He says, see what it is is a
[12:17] man won't know what to believe. It's not
[12:19] that there's not plenty of preaching.
[12:21] It's just nobody knows what to believe.
[12:23] Amen. Because people are confused. He
[12:25] said, see, they're confused because one
[12:27] man says it this way and another one
[12:29] says it this way. He said, "But we
[12:31] should base our thoughts on thus saith
[12:34] the Lord." Amen. Amen. So I I certainly
[12:38] believe that a minister ought to preach,
[12:40] Amen. Thus sayaith the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[12:43] And and and and we find out then of
[12:46] course it's a time of famine such as
[12:48] never before. And if it's the pale horse
[12:50] of confusion, the only thing that will
[12:53] uh raise a standard against confusion of
[12:55] the pale is the eagle of the great
[12:58] ministry of a prophet. And he brings
[13:00] revelation because revelation is the
[13:03] thing that conquers confusion.
[13:04] Revelation takes a hold of it and David
[13:07] describes this in Psalms 37 and he says
[13:10] it in the 19th verse. He said there's
[13:12] they shall not be ashamed in an evil
[13:14] time and in the days of famine they
[13:17] shall not be satisfied. Amen. So so
[13:20] David is saying that my people will not
[13:22] be ashamed. Amen. Now the word ashamed,
[13:24] brother Bram says it in the message
[13:26] ashamed is exactly it's like a person
[13:29] that's embarrassed and they're
[13:31] embarrassed because they don't know what
[13:32] they're talking about. In other words,
[13:33] they're not sure of something. So then
[13:35] they're they're ashamed to talk about
[13:37] it. That's why sometimes people are
[13:39] ashamed of the gospel because they're
[13:40] not just solidly sure about that gospel.
[13:44] But but according to scripture, they
[13:45] will not be ashamed. Do you see then?
[13:47] Amen. In the time of famine, to be
[13:49] satisfied means, Amen. There's a famina
[13:52] going on. But the famine is because
[13:54] people are confused about what to
[13:56] believe. But there will be a people, the
[13:59] people of God, that will not be confused
[14:01] because we have had a message. We've had
[14:03] a thus sayaith the Lord. We we have
[14:06] taken the book from the hand of
[14:09] vindication. There has been a vindicated
[14:12] prophet. Romans 9 and3 was given to
[14:14] brother Brandham when he he was uh
[14:17] having the vision of the seven angels
[14:19] bringing him his commission. And in
[14:21] Romans 9 and 33 it is written, "Behold,
[14:24] I lay in Zion." How many know Zion is
[14:26] the bride city? I lay in Zion a
[14:30] stumbling stone a rock of offense. But
[14:32] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[14:36] ashamed. Amen. Amen. Speaking of the
[14:39] message of the hour coming into the
[14:41] bride church that it would take away the
[14:43] shame of the church. Amen. Brother Bam
[14:45] actually says she won't be ashamed
[14:47] because she has an absolute. Amen. She
[14:49] has the the truth. Amen. You know Jesus
[14:52] uh who was the word in Matthew 5 tells
[14:55] us in the biatitudes that blessed are
[14:57] they which do hunger and thirst after
[14:59] righteousness for they shall be filled.
[15:02] Now he knew the Bible said there would
[15:04] be a famine in the last day. But the
[15:06] same writer, the same God that said a
[15:09] famine was coming also said that if
[15:11] you're hungry you'll be satisfied. Amen.
[15:14] And therefore, we recognize then God had
[15:16] to have something in mind to be able to
[15:20] hide some food away for his bride in the
[15:23] time of famine. Amen. There would be
[15:25] some stored up food. There would be food
[15:28] that would be placed in a place, amen,
[15:30] that that bride would be able to eat
[15:32] during the time of famine. I I think so
[15:35] wonderfully of a of of a message to
[15:38] describe that to us in this age. You
[15:40] know, brother Bannam talks about this in
[15:42] trying to do God a service without it
[15:44] being his will. And he talks about how
[15:46] that men can worship God. He said, "But
[15:49] they they do it in vain." And Jesus said
[15:52] they do it in vain. How many knows what
[15:54] he he meant by that? Jesus said they
[15:56] teach for doctrine the commandments of
[15:59] man. And since they do that, the the the
[16:02] the worship is in vain. The preaching is
[16:05] in vain. It doesn't feed the church
[16:08] because it's coming from a man. It
[16:10] produces a famine rather than producing,
[16:13] amen, a bride food. Amen. Because it is
[16:16] a time of confusion. Now, Brother Bam
[16:18] preaches two sermons back to back. And
[16:20] you won't really understand the the
[16:22] greatness of spiritual food and season
[16:25] until you listen to the morning service
[16:27] trying to do God a service without it
[16:28] being his will. And he's describing how
[16:31] that David tried to bring the word of
[16:33] God without consulting a prophet. He's
[16:35] trying to bring a bride's revival
[16:37] without a prophet. And brother said,
[16:39] "See, then that's what's happened.
[16:41] Instead of bringing revival,
[16:42] denomination brought death, thinking
[16:44] they're doing something for God, but
[16:46] they're actually killing the hearer." I
[16:49] hope you're hearing me. Men that think
[16:51] they have a little better idea than the
[16:53] prophet, they're not bringing revival.
[16:56] They're killing the people that is
[16:58] listening to it. and putting them in a
[17:00] famine. Amen. Of spiritual famine that
[17:02] they won't know what to believe. Amen.
[17:05] Amen. You see, they're teaching for
[17:06] doctrine. Brother man said, "But now I
[17:08] know nothing but the message of the
[17:10] Lord." I love that. Don't you? He said,
[17:12] "I don't know nothing but the message of
[17:14] the Lord." He said, "And tonight then, I
[17:17] want to speak on me in season if the
[17:20] Lord willing, spiritual food in due
[17:22] season." Now, uh you got to catch this
[17:24] because we're going to use it later.
[17:25] Brother Bam says his evening service
[17:27] would be titled spiritual food in due
[17:30] season, but he's telling you it's called
[17:32] meat in due season. Meet in due season.
[17:36] He's going to teach us how to receive
[17:38] it. Amen. Isn't that beautiful? Because
[17:40] when Elijah went to the widow's path,
[17:43] she had to know how to receive it. It
[17:46] wasn't it see it wasn't just everybody
[17:48] that had food. There was a famine going
[17:50] on. Amen. But there was a channel to
[17:53] receive food if you knew how to receive
[17:55] it. And the same thing in this age.
[17:58] There's a great storehouse full of the
[18:00] secret mana of God. But you got to know
[18:02] how to receive it. You You can't come to
[18:05] this message with a ton of ideas and
[18:07] walk away fed in your soul. Amen. But
[18:10] when you steal away and you forget your
[18:13] unbelief and and you lose all the
[18:15] naysayers and the critics and you get
[18:18] away from all that, then you're able to
[18:19] eat this message and it brings
[18:21] sustaining life on the inside. Amen.
[18:24] Brother Brandham says they're trying to
[18:26] do it. He said they're trying to bring
[18:28] it. Amen. But it's not the will of God
[18:30] to bring it that way. He said, but now
[18:32] this is spiritual food in due season.
[18:34] He's speaking of his own message. This
[18:37] is spiritual food in due season. This is
[18:41] the time of judgment. But we have a
[18:43] message of God that has allowed us to go
[18:47] into the secret place. Amen. To go into
[18:49] the secret place. And I I certainly
[18:51] believe this. I believe that the same
[18:54] prophet that called judgment on this
[18:55] nation also called us in our secret
[18:58] place. He's the one that told us you'll
[19:01] not get fed in the Pentecostal age any
[19:04] longer. Do y'all know you can't feed
[19:06] this bride Pentecostalism? You know, you
[19:09] can't feed her that. Amen. She won't eat
[19:11] the husk down there with the prodals.
[19:13] Well, remember said that the Bible said
[19:15] the prodal was down there. But I'm ready
[19:17] to eat the husk. It was a time of
[19:19] famine. But then he thought down at my
[19:21] father's house, even the servants eat
[19:23] better than that. See? See, you can't
[19:25] feed the bride of Pentecostalism that
[19:28] comes from Isuza Street, this bride
[19:30] would feed on the unfailing body word.
[19:33] They they come into the message of the
[19:35] hour. Amen. Where they're able to come
[19:37] into the secret place of God by the plan
[19:39] of God, by the call of God, by the word
[19:41] of God. That's exactly what Elijah did.
[19:45] He went into a secret place. And that's
[19:47] exactly what the bride does. She goes
[19:49] into a secret place. And in that place,
[19:52] there's a lot of food. There's plenty to
[19:54] eat. Amen. Amen. In the book of Psalms,
[19:56] the 27th chapter, little this is
[19:58] rehearsal, so I'm getting you back where
[20:00] we where we're at. But in Psalms 27 and5
[20:03] the Bible said, "For in the time of
[20:05] trouble shall he hide me in his
[20:08] pavilion.
[20:10] And in the secret of his tabernacle
[20:13] shall he hide me." Amen. He shall hide
[20:16] me in the secret. Can you just say it?
[20:18] In the time of trouble, in the time of
[20:20] famine, in the time of confusion, in the
[20:22] time when the world's falling apart,
[20:25] I'll take you in the secret place. And
[20:27] in that secret place, there'll be plenty
[20:29] to eat. There'll be revival there.
[20:32] There'll be grace there. Amen. A prophet
[20:35] knows this because he is the one that
[20:37] brought the judgment on this nation.
[20:39] He's the one that said that judgment is
[20:42] about to strike us and the church went
[20:45] for they went for the secret place.
[20:47] Amen. I'm I'm going to give you my title
[20:49] out of my quote. We notice here again,
[20:52] if the word is in us and has come to us
[20:54] as it did Elijah in that day, it'll do
[20:57] the same thing today he did. He would
[21:01] feed on the secret things of God which
[21:04] is hid from the world. That's right. You
[21:08] got to hear that it's hid from the
[21:10] world. Amen. It makes the message and
[21:13] the messenger one. See, the spiritual
[21:16] food is ready and it's in season now.
[21:20] And each one of you can have this food
[21:22] if you wish. If you're willing, now
[21:25] watch. If you're willing to steal away
[21:27] from unbelief of this hour, if you're
[21:29] ready to come into Christ, then you can
[21:32] come into Malachi 4. You can come into
[21:34] Luke 17. You can come to Revelations the
[21:37] 10th chapter. You can go into Revelation
[21:39] 5. You can go into Revelations 18.
[21:41] Matter of fact, the book has been open
[21:43] for the church to come into the secret
[21:46] place of God that they would be able to
[21:48] feed on the word of God. I believe today
[21:51] that we have a message that has been
[21:53] that has that that God has stored a
[21:56] message for us. Amen. In for the time of
[21:59] famine. Now, now, now y'all all know
[22:02] Brother Bam had a great uh vision, had
[22:04] dreams, and was told that he was to
[22:06] store food for the church. How many
[22:09] knows that
[22:10] God told him to store food? Now, now you
[22:14] would have thought some places you store
[22:15] food maybe in a pyramid or in a
[22:17] Tupperware container or you store food
[22:20] in grain bins, right? But the prophet
[22:22] stored our food in tapes. How many knows
[22:24] that? And he said, "Lord, give us a
[22:27] tapeful or a barrel load." Amen. So the
[22:30] the tapes that's in your we call them
[22:32] tapes now. This went digital. I know.
[22:34] But but but but it was stored in
[22:36] magnetic. It was stored in his voice.
[22:39] Aren't y'all glad that we can go and
[22:41] listen to what the prophet said? Amen.
[22:44] You you you know and I did it. I've
[22:47] looked at quotes and think brother might
[22:48] have meant this or something and go
[22:50] listen to it and he puts a different
[22:51] inflection and and takes the confusion
[22:54] out and sets it right back. And amen.
[22:56] There was a reason that God said in the
[22:58] days of the voice,
[23:01] Amen. There's a reason I I I would
[23:03] implore every person in the building,
[23:05] take your time and listen to the
[23:07] messages at home. Listen listen to those
[23:10] tapes, you know, let those tapes ring
[23:12] out and play and and and and let feed on
[23:16] it and fellowship with the Lord. Brother
[23:18] Bam says, "Of course, God gave them uh
[23:20] uh him to put on there." And and now he
[23:23] says this, "And I've done all I know how
[23:26] to do, Lord, to feed them on the bread
[23:28] of life as in the vision many years ago
[23:32] with a big curtain laid in the west and
[23:33] a mountain of the bread of life and that
[23:35] little book." Now, now I'm going to Can
[23:38] I reread this vision for you? It it's a
[23:41] very necessity. Brother gives a vision.
[23:44] And he said, "Seemingly, I was walking
[23:45] northeast on a road when a spirit turned
[23:48] me and pointed me toward the west and I
[23:50] was facing a great mountain and it
[23:52] seemed to be a mountain of the Lord. It
[23:53] was towering high church steeple on the
[23:55] top of it. And then I asked to go west
[23:57] toward the mountain and I was entered
[24:00] through the door and on the inside I met
[24:02] a woman who had a garment that might
[24:04] have been Snow White at any time, but
[24:05] now the garment was sold." And she asked
[24:08] if I was Brother Billy Brandom. I
[24:09] replied, "I am." She then introduced
[24:12] herself as Miss Me. Miss Mrs. Methodist
[24:15] that was the former age. And I asked
[24:16] her, "Where'd you get all the spots on
[24:18] that lovely garment?" And she said,
[24:19] "I've been so busy." That's right. You
[24:22] Methodist have been making organizations
[24:24] and societies in your church, and you
[24:26] haven't had much time for the Lord. And
[24:28] she said, "Well, I told you that you
[24:30] were being sent to me, but maybe I
[24:32] should awaken my husband." And then she
[24:34] disappeared. Now looking to my left, I
[24:36] saw a small heap of smooth baked bread
[24:39] and there were white fouls standing near
[24:41] it, but they would not eat it. Not much
[24:44] of it. Now then the Lord said, "Do you
[24:46] know them?" And I said, "No." He said,
[24:47] "That is your tabernacle, and they won't
[24:50] eat the bread of life anymore. So I'm
[24:53] sending you this way." And then I
[24:55] journeyed westward.
[24:57] Now this is in the 40s. And brother Bam,
[24:59] don't go westward to the 60s. Now, not
[25:02] disobedient. He said, "I was then
[25:04] brought to a plane where there was a
[25:06] platform that was erected seemingly. It
[25:09] was under a large tent." Now, this is in
[25:11] the 40s. He's already telling this in
[25:13] 56. He has a tent meeting, a vision. And
[25:16] the Lord told me to pull back the
[25:18] curtains. And when I did, I saw a great
[25:19] mountain of the bread of life. And he
[25:22] said, "Feed these." See, the the the the
[25:25] brand tabernacle wouldn't eat it
[25:27] anymore. So, he was told, "Feed these."
[25:30] and turning, I saw white robed people
[25:33] coming from everywhere, making up a
[25:36] large audience. Amen. White robed people
[25:38] coming from everywhere. How many How
[25:40] many realizes this? First pull was right
[25:42] there in Jeffersonville. Amen. That
[25:44] second pull started off up there in
[25:46] Saskatchewan, but that third pull is a
[25:49] worldwide bride who's coming to feed on
[25:53] the word of God. The message doesn't
[25:55] belong to Jeffersonville, folks. Amen.
[25:58] And I could get deep in this, but that's
[26:00] the reason that white horse rider come
[26:02] riding out of the west because this
[26:04] message that was given to you, this this
[26:06] bread of life wasn't just something out
[26:09] of Jeffersonville. It was something out
[26:11] of the west. Amen. That God was meeting
[26:14] there. I I have a lot in it, but I don't
[26:16] have time for all of it. But I'll say
[26:17] this. Amen. That the people who was the
[26:20] the the the peoples of the world would
[26:22] saw that great mountain of bread and
[26:24] white road saints coming to eat that
[26:26] bread of life. Now what is the bread of
[26:28] life of this age? It's the message that
[26:31] William Brandham spoke to us in this
[26:33] age. God gave us bread for the time of
[26:37] famine. Amen. Now according to brother
[26:40] Brandham, Amen. He actually declares
[26:42] that in 1 Thessalonians the 4th chapter
[26:45] and the 16th verse, he calls the shout
[26:48] of 1 Thessalonians 4 the living bread
[26:52] which is his message. Amen. You've heard
[26:54] him say it. The shout is the message.
[26:56] But he also says the shout is the
[26:59] message, the living bread bringing forth
[27:02] life. This message is bread and it's a
[27:06] germatized seed that has been stored on
[27:08] the tapes to bring a climax to this
[27:11] rapturing church that in this last day
[27:14] of all of this wickedness and all of
[27:16] this darkness that would still be a
[27:18] message of truth. Amen. That would still
[27:20] be sounding out in the age we're living
[27:22] in. Listen, I I know we've come up to
[27:25] this age and you remember this quote
[27:26] from Sunday. Amen. But the prophet said
[27:28] he got bit by a deity spirit, but
[27:31] because of the richness of his blood, it
[27:33] didn't affect him. He said, "Now you
[27:36] wait, and when these seals opened up,
[27:38] there's going to be some vitamins that's
[27:40] going to come out of this that's going
[27:41] to put the church with some rich blood."
[27:44] So all of these doctrines that have been
[27:46] spread out through the age, there'll be
[27:48] a bride if she'll feed on this message.
[27:50] Amen. Her rich blood. Now, it doesn't
[27:53] say you won't get bit, but it says it
[27:55] won't have an effect on you. Amen.
[27:58] Something begins to turn it because of
[28:00] the richness of the blood. Amen. That
[28:03] comes upon it. I I'll say this. Brother
[28:05] Bam said, "Thank God. We're so thankful
[28:07] tonight. We're so thankful, Lord, for
[28:10] the spiritual food of these seven seven
[28:12] seals that was promised to be opened."
[28:15] Amen. These this spiritual food, Amen,
[28:18] of seven seals. Do y'all know a lot of
[28:20] people thinks that's where brother
[28:21] Brandham lost his mind was on the seven
[28:24] seals. They they agree all his prophetic
[28:26] side was great. But when he started
[28:28] teaching, that's when he really went
[28:30] off. Amen. Do you recognize? Amen. But
[28:32] that's where the bride's food is. Amen.
[28:35] Is in not in the first portion of his
[28:37] message. The bride's food is in that
[28:40] latter part of that message when after
[28:42] the opening to the seals, Brother
[28:44] Brandham stepped into Revelations 10 as
[28:47] a prophet in the second climax of his
[28:49] own messages and took the bride and
[28:52] ushered her out of a Pentecostal age
[28:55] into a bride and to manifest that bride
[28:58] in this age. Now, you'll not do this and
[29:01] without the message of the hour. You you
[29:03] can be a good church and you can get a
[29:05] good gathering. You could get a good
[29:07] following, but to be that bride, you've
[29:09] got to have bride food. Amen. And that
[29:12] bride will only feed on the unfailing
[29:15] word of the living God. Amen. That's the
[29:18] reason. Now, now this this richness of
[29:20] this message, it's rich. Now, it's real
[29:22] rich. The things that this messenger
[29:24] taught are very rich. And the prophet of
[29:27] God said, "That's why it don't go out in
[29:28] these big places. That's why it don't go
[29:31] out in the crusades amongst the
[29:33] denominations. Why? Why ain't it on
[29:35] every television program in America?
[29:37] Brother Bam said, "Because it's not
[29:39] their food."
[29:41] Come on, church. God ain't playing
[29:43] games. He's not trying to see the
[29:45] biggest crowd he could get. Do you know
[29:47] that before Noah ever built the ark, God
[29:50] gave him the measurements.
[29:52] God gave him the measurements. He built
[29:54] the ark. Preached 120 years. But before
[29:56] he preached the first word, God knew how
[29:59] many people would get on that ark. Amen.
[30:02] And every person that's going to believe
[30:04] this message is already in the lamb's
[30:06] book of life from before the foundation
[30:08] of the world. This food was not sent
[30:11] here for everybody. It was sent for that
[30:13] bride. Amen. The the wife of Christ. You
[30:17] know, it's it's an amazing thing. It's
[30:19] not bride. It's not their food. This is
[30:21] bride food. And it's spiritual food.
[30:23] Brother Brham said it would make them
[30:25] sick to their stomach. It's too rich.
[30:30] Now, I I'll get into it maybe in another
[30:32] sermon, but I I just want to place it
[30:33] just here for you. But in John the 6th
[30:35] chapter, how many realize that Jesus fed
[30:37] 5,000? Right? And then after he fed the
[30:40] 5,000, he turns around. Amen. And then
[30:44] says they they said, "Well, what what
[30:46] what what miracle will you give us?"
[30:49] Seeing that we're going to follow you,
[30:50] Moses gave them mana in the wilderness.
[30:52] And Jesus corrected them. He said,
[30:54] "Moses didn't give you the bread." He
[30:57] said, "But my father gave the bread."
[31:00] Remember that. And then he said, "But I
[31:02] am the true bread that cometh down out
[31:04] of heaven. I am the bread of life that
[31:06] cometh from heaven." And then let him
[31:08] know that no man come to me unless my
[31:11] father first draw him. In other words,
[31:13] there's no miracles that's ever going to
[31:16] bring the bride. Amen. It'll have to be
[31:18] the true bread that'll bring the bride
[31:21] into him. Now, now look, I I can say
[31:23] this far beyond that. Jesus immediately
[31:26] ties predestination to him being bread.
[31:28] No man come unto me lest my father first
[31:31] draw him. Immediately he tells you not
[31:34] everybody's going to eat this food.
[31:36] That's why there's a first pull, a
[31:37] second pull, and a third pull. He said
[31:40] them first two pools were there, but the
[31:42] bride is drawn by that third pull. It's
[31:46] the food of that great Now, not
[31:49] everybody can eat it. Amen. And I I'm
[31:51] not throwing off on anybody. I'm just
[31:53] saying some some people, it's pretty
[31:55] funny. Somebody told me today said,
[31:57] "Well, if you ever have your gallbladder
[31:58] moved out, you can't eat certain foods."
[32:00] And and you know, that's the truth. And
[32:02] but thank God, amen, that that you know
[32:05] that happens in the natural, right?
[32:07] Foods you can eat, foods you can't eat.
[32:09] But when it comes to this message, it
[32:10] takes the bride to eat the bride part of
[32:14] the message of the hour. Amen. Now, the
[32:16] food's in season, spiritual food. It's
[32:19] something the world knows nothing of it.
[32:22] See, that's what he says. The same place
[32:24] Elisha walked up and said, "Do will not
[32:27] come until I ask." He said, "I have food
[32:30] that you don't know about." Do you see
[32:32] the true the true believer, the body of
[32:34] believers has access to food, spiritual
[32:36] food that nominals know nothing about.
[32:41] Now, the world knows nothing about this
[32:43] food.
[32:44] But father, but your church, your
[32:47] people, the bride of your son loves it.
[32:52] They love it. What is it? It's it's the
[32:55] food of the season or bride food. Would
[32:58] you uh find Brother Bam in the unveiling
[33:00] of God? Powerful sermon. Brother
[33:02] Brandham in the unveiling of God does
[33:04] something wonderful is he takes the
[33:06] tabernacle in the wilderness and he
[33:08] shows you there's an outer court, an
[33:09] inner court, and a holies of holies. You
[33:11] all know that. And in that holies of
[33:13] holies, remember, was the word. And in
[33:15] there was also the golden oafer full of
[33:18] the hidden mana. But then the pillar of
[33:20] fire was over that word. Now, brother
[33:22] Bam teaches us that the word is a seed.
[33:25] And he said the seeds of that promise
[33:27] was laying there on that shakana light
[33:30] and that it would manifest or ripen. He
[33:33] said that's why they had shoebre laid
[33:36] outside of the holies of holies in the
[33:39] holy place where the priest would come
[33:41] in. They you remember there was bread
[33:43] there and they would eat that bread and
[33:45] that was called the bread of his face or
[33:47] the bread of his presence. And what it
[33:49] was saying is you're eating this because
[33:52] there's something else behind that veil.
[33:54] So there was a there was a there was
[33:56] actually a shakana glory that would bake
[33:58] the shoe bread. Brother Ram says it
[34:00] makes it bread for believers. Now,
[34:02] that's what the shakana does in this
[34:04] age. It takes the word that's in the
[34:06] Bible and ripens it for the bread of the
[34:10] church that they might be able to eat
[34:11] things that's been laying in this Bible
[34:14] throughout seven ages. Amen. Nobody ever
[34:17] was able to eat it. But when God ripened
[34:21] it, he put it in a place that we could
[34:23] eat it. Amen. I don't know how to say it
[34:25] other than hillbilly. Let's say it like
[34:26] this. You didn't eat green beans until
[34:29] you open the can.
[34:31] Amen. You can't you can't eat something
[34:33] that ain't open. And when God opens it,
[34:36] he manifests it or he makes it come into
[34:40] bread, into edible, something brings it
[34:43] to pass. See, when God brings his word
[34:46] to pass, that's when it becomes bread to
[34:49] the believer. Amen. Do you see? Now,
[34:52] Brother Manimma, tell us this. Now, if
[34:54] you like it, if you like a bit of a
[34:56] Bible study, you can look in Leviticus
[34:58] 24 and watches verse 5 down to verse 8.
[35:02] And it tells you of how they made the
[35:04] fine bread that went into the holy place
[35:07] which was called shoebre or called the
[35:10] bread of his presence. In Exodus 13:16
[35:14] and31, Exodus
[35:16] 16:31-35, it'll actually tell you how
[35:19] that there was mana that fell in the
[35:21] wilderness and the people could eat it.
[35:24] But then Moses was commanded to take a
[35:27] part of that bread and put it in the
[35:29] holy holies of holies. But see, Christ
[35:32] was both of those breads. He was the
[35:35] shoe bread and he was the bread in the
[35:37] holies of holies. Amen. Each one of them
[35:40] symbolized, amen, a bread of his
[35:42] presence or a bread that was hidden,
[35:45] amen, that could be eaten. Now, of
[35:46] course, in Revelation chapter 2, Jesus
[35:48] uses this and said, "He that hath an
[35:50] ear, let him hear what the spirit says
[35:53] to the church and to him that
[35:55] overcomemeth." Yeah. Will I give to eat
[36:00] of the hidden mana? I will give to eat
[36:04] of the hidden mana. Now, what was that?
[36:07] That was speaking of that Old Testament
[36:09] thought of where the mana was put in
[36:12] that holies of holies. And Jesus was
[36:14] saying, "If you overcome, I'll let you
[36:16] eat of that hidden mana." Amen. What are
[36:19] you overcoming? Criticism, doubts,
[36:21] unbelief, self. You've got to overcome.
[36:25] Amen. To believe to eat. Now, Brother
[36:28] Brandon will say it here in hidden life.
[36:29] He said, "He that overcomemeth shall
[36:31] inherit all things, and he shall be my
[36:33] son. I will be his God, and I will give
[36:35] him hidden mana. I will hide him away
[36:39] and I will give him the hidden things
[36:42] that the world on the outside of this
[36:44] curtain don't know nothing about. They
[36:47] don't know nothing about and you can't
[36:49] tell them about it. I I don't mean that
[36:51] in a in a negative way, but I mean it's
[36:54] food for you. It's it's it's rich. It's
[36:56] beautiful. It's it's food. It's
[36:58] encouraging. It's strength. It's faith.
[37:01] But to others, it it's not food.
[37:05] They don't know about it. Religious but
[37:08] don't know about it. I I'll give you
[37:11] God's wrapped gift. Brother Brandham
[37:12] tells us of how the three magi are
[37:14] coming to find the word made flesh.
[37:17] Jesus said he was the bread of life.
[37:19] They were on their way. Amen. To find
[37:21] the bread of life. And when they and
[37:23] when they come to Jerusalem, the the the
[37:26] the sinner of religion,
[37:29] they come in and said, "Where is he born
[37:32] king of the Jews?" And they didn't even
[37:34] know what they were talking about.
[37:37] Think about that. That great event had
[37:39] happened and transpired right in their
[37:42] just right by their city in Bethlehem,
[37:45] but they didn't even know it had taken
[37:47] place. Amen. It was it was Do you see
[37:50] God could do great miracles and we don't
[37:53] even know that it happened. So just
[37:54] because somebody will say, "Well,
[37:56] Brother Wayne, if the message is so
[37:57] right, why didn't the whole world know
[37:59] about it?" Cuz the world don't know
[38:00] everything. and actually prophesied in
[38:03] this age to be a secret. Have y'all ever
[38:05] thought about that? All the hundreds of
[38:07] prophecies of the birth of Christ. Amen.
[38:10] How he was to come the first time and
[38:12] they missed it. And it wasn't supposed
[38:14] to be a secret. But in this age, it's
[38:17] promised that it will be a secret. Then
[38:20] how much greater will they miss it in
[38:21] this age than they did in that age? But
[38:24] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[38:28] blessed are your ears for they hear that
[38:30] you might feed on the secret things on
[38:33] the secret things of God. Amen. They
[38:36] didn't have an answer. They didn't know
[38:37] what it was. Brother Ram says it very in
[38:40] return in Jubilee. How many remembers
[38:41] when the Jubilee horn would sound? Amen.
[38:44] That it's what separated the slaves from
[38:46] the sons.
[38:48] Remember that when the horn would sound,
[38:51] they'd be working in the field. the son
[38:53] of a farmer that had been sold off into
[38:56] slavery. He'd be working out in the
[38:58] field right next to a slave in the same
[39:01] field and you couldn't tell the
[39:02] difference. But when the Jubilee trumpet
[39:04] sounded, it said to the son, "You can
[39:08] return to your inheritance." But the
[39:10] slave didn't know nothing about it
[39:12] because he had no inheritance to return
[39:15] to. And when the bride hears the message
[39:18] of the hour to her, it's a return. It's
[39:21] a return to her glory. It's a return to
[39:24] the presence of God. It's a return to
[39:26] her inheritance. Come on, church. As
[39:29] she's feeding, she's feeding on divine
[39:32] inheritance. Oh my goodness. That's
[39:35] exactly if Eve could have just got back
[39:37] to that tree. She could have had
[39:39] everything back. If she could have just
[39:41] ate of that tree, hope that we are
[39:43] living in an age where we have returned
[39:45] to the tree, the tree of life.
[39:49] Amen. There's not a cherub with a sword
[39:51] trying to keep you out of it tonight.
[39:53] There's a cherub with a sword driving
[39:55] you back the presence of God where you
[39:59] could receive everything that has been
[40:01] lost. My when you feed on this message,
[40:04] you take back. It's an authority in your
[40:06] mouth. It's an authority in your life.
[40:09] It's so rich. And people that begin to
[40:11] eat it begin to believe things like that
[40:13] they were the sons and daughters of God
[40:16] before the foundation of the world. They
[40:17] begin to believe that they have
[40:19] authority over the devil. They begin to
[40:22] believe that they are the bride of Jesus
[40:24] Christ. Oh, when they begin to feed on
[40:27] these things,
[40:29] amen. Hallelujah. Begin to return to
[40:32] their inheritance.
[40:34] The world don't know nothing about it
[40:36] because there's no representation.
[40:40] Yes, sir.
[40:42] Oh, but to you that come from God,
[40:45] the world don't know nothing about him.
[40:47] Brother Bam said, but we seen him and we
[40:50] identify him. He identifies himself.
[40:54] Now, the prophet will tell us this. All
[40:56] the glory of God is hid in his word.
[41:00] It's in the unveiling again to the
[41:02] unbeliever by tradition.
[41:05] See, all the glory of God's hid in it.
[41:09] They looking right at it but don't see
[41:12] it
[41:14] because it's hid.
[41:16] It's hid by a tradition.
[41:19] Now here brother Bama tell us this. He
[41:21] said all that God was was in it but it's
[41:24] hid. And he said now we being in him we
[41:28] are veiled to
[41:29] religionist and professors of the world.
[41:33] Our glory that we have and are enjoying
[41:37] is still veiled to the outsiders. They
[41:40] think we're crazy.
[41:43] Yeah. Look right at it and think we're
[41:46] crazy. We're out in the aisle dancing
[41:49] and shouting and running and jumping,
[41:51] enjoying the presence of God. Great
[41:53] spiritual blessings falling. Amen. Think
[41:56] we're crazy. Why? Because we're feeding
[41:59] on a secret thing. Something they don't
[42:01] know anything about. Hey, listen. It was
[42:03] prophesied to be a secret. It's a
[42:06] prophecy. It's not just a written word
[42:09] to us tonight. This is a reality to us.
[42:12] It's not just a a word that's written.
[42:15] It's been a manifestation. And the true
[42:18] believers of this age see it. They see
[42:20] the open word manifested. Now, of
[42:24] course, Brother Bam deals with this and
[42:26] talks about the difference in the birds.
[42:27] And he talks about an eagle, how he sees
[42:29] and how a hawk sees. Yeah. Now you see
[42:32] when you're coming into this age, you're
[42:35] climbing way high on the mountain,
[42:36] right? But brother Ram says, "See, but
[42:38] by the time other birds get up to that
[42:42] place, they can't see nothing." Amen.
[42:44] There there's other birds existing in
[42:47] religion the same time as eagles are rel
[42:50] they're there. We're all there. But
[42:52] brother Bam said, "But when they get
[42:54] that high, they go blind. They can't see
[42:57] what you see. They can't see the things
[42:59] that you're getting because they can't
[43:01] see it. They can't eat it. But to that
[43:04] true bride, come on. Now listen, let's
[43:06] tie it together. They don't know it.
[43:07] They can't see it. They can't look at
[43:09] it. Amen. That's why, watch, the prophet
[43:11] said it. That angel's voice said to me,
[43:13] "I'll meet you in there. This will be
[43:16] the third pull, but nobody will know
[43:19] nothing about it."
[43:22] Nobody will know nothing about it. It
[43:25] will not be a public show. Come on,
[43:29] church. This is not a public show. This
[43:33] is not Amen. It's not It's just not a
[43:36] public show. This is happening behind
[43:38] the veil. This is happening in the
[43:40] secret place where the church of the
[43:43] living God are feeding on the secrets of
[43:45] God. My having a revival and nobody else
[43:49] can figure out what you're excited
[43:51] about. What they excited about? What's
[43:53] what's so inviting to a Thursday night
[43:55] service that would excite people to get
[43:57] out of their homes and come together and
[43:59] worship? It's a secret to the world.
[44:01] They don't know.
[44:04] Seen a guy the other day, he said,
[44:05] "Brother, brother, what do y'all do to
[44:07] have all them young people y'all got?" I
[44:08] said, "It's a secret.
[44:11] It's a secret." Amen. What is it? It's
[44:13] the secret things of God. It's the
[44:16] feeding of this message. The devil don't
[44:18] know nothing about it. The world don't
[44:19] know nothing about it. Hey, I'll tell
[44:21] you the prophet of God said it. He said,
[44:23] "If you'll think real closely, the Bible
[44:25] said, "Here is it who has wisdom. The
[44:27] third pull is properly identified. We
[44:29] know where it is. And the third pull is
[44:32] here." All them years him saying it was
[44:34] hidden and it was a secret. Everybody
[44:36] got to thinking it wasn't even open. But
[44:39] it wasn't open to the public. It wasn't
[44:41] open to everybody. But to that bride
[44:44] that was willing to go behind the veil,
[44:46] come on. He's not looking for a blessing
[44:48] bride tonight. He's not looking for a
[44:50] bride that won't go into the experience
[44:52] of God. Come on, church. This is now
[44:56] Y'all know me. I'm separating Pentecost
[44:58] from the message, not the blessing of
[44:59] Pentecost. But the Pentecostal age come
[45:01] up to the veil and they didn't want to
[45:03] go in there.
[45:06] You see it? They denied. They committed
[45:08] adultery by denying a furtherance of the
[45:10] word of God. They said, "We've got it.
[45:12] We've shouted. We've enjoyed it. We've
[45:14] got denomination. We don't need anything
[45:17] further." But to that bride, she knows
[45:19] the relationship is not in the kitchen.
[45:22] It's not in the living room. It's beyond
[45:25] the veil. There's a relationship behind
[45:27] the veil. Come on, church. Amen. A young
[45:31] couple gets married, it's all physical.
[45:33] It's physical. Physical. But if that
[45:35] relationship's going to continue,
[45:37] something's got to change. Something's
[45:40] got to change because it won't stay that
[45:42] same way your whole married life. But
[45:44] after a little while, you begin to find
[45:46] that everything happens in wording. It
[45:49] becomes a stimulation by the sharing of
[45:52] secrets and inner thoughts and and
[45:54] setting with relationship until it
[45:56] becomes stimulating. There's a bride
[45:58] tonight that's went beyond just a
[46:01] physical workup of emotion. She's heard
[46:03] the word and she's went behind the veil
[46:06] where the presence of God is in there
[46:09] revealing. He's revealing himself. Come
[46:12] on. Amen. He built a place, sir. He
[46:15] built a place that nobody could see him
[46:19] that he could unveil himself to you.
[46:24] He's not unveiled himself on the corner.
[46:26] He built a secret place. Hallelujah.
[46:29] Glory. Wonderful. And with love secrets,
[46:34] he said, "Come on back here. Come here,
[46:36] honey. Come on back in this room.
[46:39] There's a relationship the world won't
[46:40] know nothing about. But to her, it's a
[46:43] love affair. To her, it's a revival. To
[46:46] her, it's her Lord. It's the food of her
[46:49] life. It's the joy of her soul. There's
[46:52] nothing greater than when you break
[46:53] beyond the veil. And you don't care what
[46:55] the world thinks. You don't care what an
[46:58] unbeliever thinks, but you're in the
[47:00] presence of that shakana.
[47:04] Glory. Glory begins to move forward.
[47:07] He's not He's not looking for a blessing
[47:11] bride.
[47:13] He's looking for a people to press in
[47:14] behind the veil.
[47:17] Don't be ashamed of him.
[47:21] It's so sacred. Brother Bam said, "I
[47:23] can't say anything about it.
[47:26] It's so sacred. It's so secret. It's so
[47:30] hidden." Yeah.
[47:33] But to you that have wisdom,
[47:36] to you the third pull's here to you.
[47:42] To you, the first pull it was a healing.
[47:45] And to you that has wisdom, the second
[47:47] pull, it was a prophesying. But to you
[47:50] that has wisdom, the third pull is the
[47:52] opening of the word. It's the revealing
[47:55] of the mysteries where the bride will
[47:58] climb back into her former glory through
[48:00] the veil of the word. And when she goes
[48:03] in behind the veil, all the glory, all
[48:05] the power, all the things that God had
[48:07] for her in the beginning are right there
[48:09] in that place.
[48:11] Oh my. That third pull was the opening
[48:14] of them seven seals. Let's say it again
[48:16] together. The third pull, third pull was
[48:18] the opening of seven seals.
[48:22] The third pull is the opening of the
[48:24] word.
[48:26] See the third pull, the opening of the
[48:27] word. Brother Bam was calling the
[48:29] opening of seven seals the opening of
[48:31] the word. These are old arguments we had
[48:34] as kids coming up. People used to argue
[48:36] about the seventh seal. You know, it was
[48:37] kind of fun back in the day, wasn't
[48:40] it? They had quotes and you had quotes
[48:42] and they had quotes and you had quotes
[48:44] and it was it was it was good. It was it
[48:47] was iron sharpened and iron. I didn't
[48:48] always think it was good, but some, you
[48:50] know, looking back on it, it was a
[48:52] pretty good
[48:54] time. Of course, I was always
[49:02] right. Well, if you believe that, I got
[49:04] a Golden Gate Bridge for
[49:07] sale right here in
[49:12] Ohio. You see, it's not going to be a
[49:16] public show, right? But he will reveal
[49:19] it to the people that will believe it.
[49:21] Amen. See, brother Bam says, "See, the
[49:23] reason they don't believe it is because
[49:25] they don't believe the messenger."
[49:28] Remember that they can't do the works of
[49:30] God because they don't believe the
[49:32] messenger. And the message and the
[49:35] messenger
[49:37] are one. Amen. So the bread of the age
[49:40] was coming through the messenger as he
[49:43] personally
[49:45] manifested Christ in the age so much
[49:49] that men wanted to worship him
[49:52] and he was saying oh no don't do that
[49:54] it's the prophecy of the age that bread
[49:57] was to come through a messenger your
[49:59] bread now thousands and thousands
[50:02] brother Bam says have heard it seen it
[50:04] across the magazines and everything else
[50:05] they look right at it they don't know
[50:07] what it is. But to you that recognizes
[50:10] it releases the power to heal. It
[50:13] releases a power of forgiveness. Do you
[50:15] see as you eat it, you find that it's
[50:18] the son of man that's revealing himself
[50:21] and the word is becoming flesh among us.
[50:25] This message should open your eyes.
[50:29] Amen. Eating this bread should open your
[50:32] eyes. Y'all remember in Luke 24, it was
[50:35] the resurrected Christ. They were, but
[50:37] they didn't know it.
[50:39] But when they got in that little room,
[50:41] Yeah. Come on. And he broke the bread in
[50:44] the evening. In the breaking of the
[50:47] bread, they recognized it's him. Do you
[50:50] see that? This is the age. He broke the
[50:52] bread. He opened the seals. And we
[50:55] looked up and said, "That ain't brother
[50:56] Brandham doing that. Only the lamb can
[50:59] open that book. It's the resurrected one
[51:02] bringing back this age of food for the
[51:04] church. It ought to open your eyes. If
[51:07] that opened their eyes, this should open
[51:10] your eyes to who it is. It's an evening
[51:13] message and it will produce evening
[51:15] results. It's too plain not to see it.
[51:20] Amen. It's too plain not to see it. Now,
[51:22] I'm a I'm a I'm a message preacher. I am
[51:26] not going to apologize for that. I'm
[51:27] sorry.
[51:29] I'm just not.
[51:31] Do you know that I believe with all of
[51:33] my heart and brother brother Ericson is
[51:36] in 100% agreement with me on this point.
[51:39] We're in agreement period but in this
[51:41] point
[51:42] doubly that this church is not for just
[51:47] everything.
[51:49] It's not just for every preaching and
[51:51] every teaching and every idea. This is
[51:54] for the preaching of the message of
[51:56] Malachi 4 of Revelations 10. Do you see
[52:01] it? It it it whether whether people can
[52:03] receive it or whether they can
[52:04] understand it or not. Why do y'all
[52:06] preach messages? Why do y'all read
[52:07] quotes? Why why do y'all talk about a
[52:09] prophet? Why do y'all do all that? Cuz
[52:11] the Bible said,
[52:13] in Jeremiah 3 and 15, I will give you
[52:16] pastors according to mine heart and
[52:20] which shall feed you with knowledge and
[52:23] understanding.
[52:25] You tell me where I can get the
[52:26] knowledge of the son of man outside of
[52:28] William Brown's message. Where am I
[52:30] going to feed the understanding of the
[52:32] revelation of the son of man, the coming
[52:34] of the Lord, the change of the body,
[52:36] predestination, water baptism. Amen.
[52:38] Where's it all going to be come from?
[52:40] Amen. Listen. God, the God of knowledge
[52:43] and wisdom sent this message because we
[52:46] are to preach the message.
[52:49] Yes, sir. Jeremiah 23:4, I will set up
[52:52] shepherds over them, which shall feed
[52:55] them, and they shall fear no more, nor
[52:59] be dismayed, neither shall they be
[53:02] lacken, sayaeth the Lord. What's this
[53:05] Ephesians 4 ministry to do? She's to
[53:07] take this message and preach it back in
[53:10] the church. John, eat the book, but then
[53:13] prophesy the book. Amen. Don't don't
[53:15] just eat the book and keep it to
[53:17] ourselves and go read every book in the
[53:19] Listen, I I don't know how to say it
[53:21] better because I don't want to sound
[53:23] legalist. I don't want you to catch a
[53:25] legalist idea here, but but there's a
[53:27] lot of good books and there's a lot of
[53:30] good bookstores and there's a lot of
[53:31] good writers and and you might find a
[53:33] good book and God bless you for doing
[53:35] that, but you'll not find a book like
[53:38] this message that God has attended the
[53:41] very preaching of it and did it in his
[53:44] own presence because the message is food
[53:46] from the presence of God. It's not from
[53:49] the intellect of a man or the study of a
[53:52] man or the education of a man. This is
[53:55] the presence of the living God. And he
[53:58] has brought forth this message. Amen.
[54:00] According to Jeremiah, amen, that will
[54:02] be shepherds. Amen. That will be
[54:04] preaching this so that people won't be
[54:06] lacking.
[54:08] Build them up in the holy oracles of God
[54:10] according to Bible. Build them up under
[54:12] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[54:15] I'll tell you in John 21:17, he saith
[54:18] unto them the third time,
[54:20] Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me
[54:24] three times. He's asked him this. And
[54:26] you y'all know how many times Peter
[54:28] denied him, right? Three times he denied
[54:31] him. Three times. And he is an
[54:32] embarrassed man right now. And the Lord
[54:34] said, "Do you love me?" He asked him
[54:36] this three times. And finally, Amen.
[54:38] Peter was grieved because he said unto
[54:41] him the third time, "Lovest thou me?"
[54:44] And he said unto him,"Lord, thou knowest
[54:46] all things, and thou knowest that I love
[54:48] thee." And Jesus said unto him, "Feed my
[54:52] sheep." Listen, listen. Years ago, the
[54:55] Lord gave me a direct commission. I was
[54:57] praying, "God, what do I do with my
[54:59] life? What do I do with my ministry?" He
[55:01] said, "If you love me, feed my sheep."
[55:05] And I don't know of any other way to
[55:07] feed the sheep than to preach this
[55:09] message. It is sheep food. Come on. This
[55:12] is food. This is not everybody's food,
[55:15] but for the sheep, it's his food. It's
[55:18] his food. Look in Acts 20 and verse 28.
[55:20] Take heed therefore unto yourselves. And
[55:22] to all the flock, which the Holy Ghost
[55:24] hath made you overseers, to feed the
[55:27] church of God, which he hath per
[55:29] purchased with his own blood. In 1 Peter
[55:32] 5:22, he said, "Feed the flock of God
[55:34] which is among you, taking oversight
[55:37] thereof, not by constraint,
[55:40] but by willing, not by filthy lure, but
[55:44] of a ready mind. Feed the flock of God."
[55:47] Can I Can I say that the message is to
[55:50] be preached in a message church? It's
[55:53] not a denomination. It's a bride.
[55:58] It's not denominational. It's not it's
[56:00] not this denomination called the
[56:02] message. That's right. It's the truth of
[56:05] God for the bride of the last days.
[56:09] There's another way of saying this. The
[56:11] message of the hour, the word of the
[56:13] hour. Meat is the word of nourishment.
[56:17] It's the season. See? Amen. It's it's
[56:20] it's this is the time to bring the
[56:22] church to an adoption. Yeah. Amen. It's
[56:26] time to bring it to an a full authority.
[56:31] Do you all know what that means? A
[56:32] knowing.
[56:34] It it it's bringing to a maturity the
[56:37] the developed thought that God had. As
[56:40] long as you don't know the developed
[56:41] thought, you don't know how to stand.
[56:43] You don't know what's coming. But we've
[56:45] had a message of maturity to bring the
[56:48] people to maturity. Now listen, I
[56:51] believe this. Brother Graham says it in
[56:53] faith is a substance. He said, "I so I
[56:54] think real true ministers of the gospel
[56:57] ought to be up and going, ought to be
[56:59] giving the people the right thing, meet
[57:03] in due season." Amen. And can I read it
[57:06] to you what Jesus said? Matthew 24 and
[57:09] verse 44. Therefore, be also ready. In
[57:12] such as an hour you think not, the son
[57:14] of man cometh. So then is a faithful and
[57:18] wise servant, whom his lord hath made
[57:22] him rule over his household, to give
[57:25] them meat in due season. Yeah, he made
[57:30] them a pastor to give meat in due
[57:33] season. As a faithful and wise servant,
[57:37] a preacher in this age, if he's going to
[57:39] be faithful and wise, he is going to
[57:42] have to preach the message of this hour.
[57:46] Come on, church. Blessed is that servant
[57:48] of whom the Lord when he shall come
[57:50] shall find him doing it. Meet in season.
[57:52] Now, now watch this because this is not
[57:54] just any season. In 1 Thessalonians 4,
[57:57] it's the season of the rapture. For the
[57:59] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[58:01] with a shout. This is a message. It's
[58:04] the season of rapture. This is the bread
[58:07] of the age. It's a time to change the
[58:09] diet of the church. I'm not specifically
[58:12] speaking to you. You've been on a word
[58:14] diet a long time. Amen. But I'll say
[58:16] this, it's a time of change. That's the
[58:18] season that we're living in. People
[58:21] People have a hard time understanding
[58:24] that the season changed. The
[58:26] dispensation changed, the diet changed.
[58:32] Listen, that that that you you can you
[58:34] can watch it. You can you can watch it
[58:36] if you if you study your scriptures.
[58:38] Moses gave them food. It was for the
[58:40] journey, wasn't it? Yeah. It was food in
[58:42] the journey. When Jesus multiplied the
[58:44] fishes and loaves, it was for the
[58:46] journey home. Amen. When Abraham met
[58:49] Melazdc on the road, he was on his
[58:52] journey home. And it was then that
[58:54] Melazdc brought bread and wine. And the
[58:58] church is on his journey home now. Come
[59:00] on. The message is not our destination.
[59:03] The message is the food we eat that we
[59:06] can get to the destination. Amen. As
[59:08] this message comes into our lives, it'll
[59:11] build a strength in the church that'll
[59:13] take them up higher and higher and
[59:15] higher until the presence of God
[59:18] overtakes their lives. It's a change of
[59:20] diet. Amen. Come on. Can I show it to
[59:22] you in the Bible? It's a change of diet.
[59:24] Amen. Do you know for years, Amen. They
[59:26] ate the mana that fell from the heaven.
[59:28] It was a supernatural mana. You couldn't
[59:30] think it could get better than that,
[59:32] could you? I mean, think about it. How
[59:33] could it get better? It rain mana out of
[59:35] heaven every day. But my Bible says when
[59:37] they crossed the Jordan under Joshua,
[59:40] Amen. And when they got under Joshua and
[59:42] crossed the Jordan, Amen. They come over
[59:44] in Gilgal at the time of Passover.
[59:49] Listen to this. They came in the time of
[59:51] Passover. It's a harvest season they're
[59:53] coming in. And while they're coming into
[59:56] this harvest season, they're going to
[59:58] have a Passover. Amen. But what they
[1:00:00] did, the Bible said they ate of the old
[1:00:02] corn of the land. And on the tomorrow
[1:00:05] after that Passover, unleavened cakes
[1:00:08] and parched corn in the cell same day,
[1:00:10] and the mana ceased,
[1:00:13] the mana from heaven ceased. Amen. But
[1:00:16] they didn't quit eating, folks. They
[1:00:18] didn't quit eating, but the mana changed
[1:00:21] how it was coming. This is not just a
[1:00:23] Lutheran revival. It's not a Methodist
[1:00:26] revival. It's not a Pentecostal revival.
[1:00:29] This is a revival of the
[1:00:31] word. Amen. Preacher, what are you
[1:00:34] preaching? I'll show you what happened.
[1:00:35] They went over there and they found the
[1:00:37] corner of that land and they started
[1:00:39] eating up. Now listen, how many how many
[1:00:41] decades, how many centuries have they
[1:00:43] been looking for this message? I mean,
[1:00:45] this land,
[1:00:48] how many decades have they been looking
[1:00:49] for this land that they could eat out of
[1:00:51] it? Man, they've been eating out of the
[1:00:54] heavens, but they never ate it in their
[1:00:55] own promises. And they just through the
[1:00:57] journey, the journey, the journey. But
[1:00:59] when they got in that promised land,
[1:01:01] when they got there, they started eating
[1:01:03] out of the land of their own promise. Do
[1:01:06] you see that God's going to send a
[1:01:08] message to this bride and she's going to
[1:01:10] be able to start feeding right out of
[1:01:12] the message of a promise that has been
[1:01:14] given through all these ages? Amen.
[1:01:16] There it is, church. Watch. The mana
[1:01:19] ceased and they begin to eat out of the
[1:01:22] land.
[1:01:23] And you said, "Preacher, Amen, what in
[1:01:25] the world are you talking about?" I'm
[1:01:26] talking about this. But I'm talking
[1:01:28] about a change of battle, a change of
[1:01:29] diet. They've been running from the
[1:01:31] enemy now all the way throughout the
[1:01:33] wilderness. They've been on the move.
[1:01:35] They've been running. They've been
[1:01:36] dodging. But now when they start eating
[1:01:39] this corn, they turn aggressive and they
[1:01:42] go on an offensive. And if you want to
[1:01:44] see somebody that that runs scared, it's
[1:01:47] somebody not feeding out this message.
[1:01:49] But when a man starts feeding on this
[1:01:51] message, it'll make a boldness come into
[1:01:53] your life. It'll make a strength come
[1:01:55] into your life. and you'll pull a sword
[1:01:58] and say, "Give me my land. I'm here to
[1:02:01] possess everything that God has promised
[1:02:04] me to give."
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:07] Yeah. They eat the They eat the corn
[1:02:09] right up on the hill. And Joshua went
[1:02:11] down and met the captain of the host and
[1:02:12] challenged him to a fight.
[1:02:15] Tell me, he wasn't aggressive. He was
[1:02:17] ready to walk down the walls. I'm
[1:02:19] talking about a change in revival,
[1:02:21] folks. There was a change happened. It
[1:02:23] wasn't a lesser revival. It was the same
[1:02:26] pillar of fire, but the revival was
[1:02:28] coming a different way.
[1:02:32] You'll blind yourself looking in the
[1:02:33] rearview mirror trying to get the same
[1:02:35] revival they had behind you.
[1:02:38] You know what they did when they crossed
[1:02:40] the river? I I love these. I love these
[1:02:42] points as you study them through your
[1:02:43] life and you see the seriousness of them
[1:02:46] when they come across the Red Sea back
[1:02:48] there in that journey. You know what
[1:02:50] they done? They grabbed a tambourine and
[1:02:52] they shouted and they danced and they
[1:02:54] rejoiced after they got over. After they
[1:02:57] got over. But now in this new revival,
[1:03:02] now in this land eating this corn,
[1:03:04] eating this food, they come up to the
[1:03:06] walls of Jericho and march six days
[1:03:09] which seemingly they would have
[1:03:11] weakened. But when they come up to the
[1:03:13] seventh day, Amen. Before the first
[1:03:16] stone moved, before the wall fell,
[1:03:18] before any sign that there was any kind
[1:03:21] of victory, they begin to shout and they
[1:03:24] begin to rejoice because the walls were
[1:03:27] coming down. Well, listen. If you study
[1:03:29] this message, you'll begin to find out,
[1:03:31] I may still be in this body, but it's
[1:03:34] going to change in the moment, in the
[1:03:36] twinkle of an eye. I can already begin
[1:03:38] to shout a victory knowing that death
[1:03:40] has been swallowed up in victory. Let me
[1:03:43] say tonight, I believe this. I believe
[1:03:45] we have come into a revival. You don't
[1:03:47] have to wait till you're healed to begin
[1:03:48] to rejoice.
[1:03:51] You can eat it right out of the book.
[1:03:54] Come on. You can't get this out of
[1:03:55] former ages. But at this prophet of this
[1:03:57] age said it like this. Amen. We've got a
[1:04:00] rapture faith. We've got healing faith.
[1:04:02] He said, "Listen, if you come in this
[1:04:04] prayer line and you got something hurt
[1:04:05] and you get prayed for," he said, "you
[1:04:08] might not feel a bit better. Your hand
[1:04:10] might not be healed. Your back might not
[1:04:12] be healed, but you're not looking for a
[1:04:14] healing in the body. You're looking for
[1:04:16] a healing in the spirit. And if your
[1:04:18] spirit gets healed, your body will come
[1:04:21] in behind your spirit. Then you can
[1:04:24] shout all the way back to your chair. I
[1:04:27] might be hurting, but I'm healed. I
[1:04:29] might be troubled, but I'm saved. Amen.
[1:04:31] Because you're feeding on the word of
[1:04:34] the living
[1:04:36] God. They think we're crazy. We're not
[1:04:38] crazy. We're just eating from a
[1:04:40] different place. Hallelujah.
[1:04:44] G. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You get to
[1:04:48] feeding on this kind of food and after a
[1:04:50] little while you get up there so high.
[1:04:55] I got I'm I know. I'm going to I got to
[1:04:58] bring her down.
[1:05:02] She gets to feeding on
[1:05:05] that. Brother Matt, this is not the mind
[1:05:09] of a man. That's right.
[1:05:13] You are not feeding on the mind of a
[1:05:16] man. This is the unfailing body word of
[1:05:21] the son of man. I'm not feeding on
[1:05:24] William Brandom. Are you with me? We
[1:05:26] were feeding on the presence of the
[1:05:29] angel that was alongside him,
[1:05:33] performing these things that man could
[1:05:35] not do. And he manifested that that we
[1:05:38] might eat that and be able to prophesy
[1:05:40] again. Listen, I believe it. I believe
[1:05:42] we're feeding on things right now. How
[1:05:44] is it that a woman How many How many
[1:05:46] sisters in here claiming their children
[1:05:48] right now? How many of you claiming
[1:05:50] children right now? And some of them
[1:05:51] children you got a claim on. Amen. Is so
[1:05:54] far away from the Lord. One look at it
[1:05:56] would take all your it just brings such
[1:05:58] doubt and such discouragement and such a
[1:06:02] head bowing and such a shame. Amen. But
[1:06:04] you can reach in the message and pick
[1:06:07] out that story with Hatty Wright and
[1:06:09] just go to eat in a little while and you
[1:06:11] forget whatever shape they're in and you
[1:06:14] begin to say, "I got a token and I'm
[1:06:16] going to claim them by the glory of
[1:06:18] God." and you begin to shout aloud
[1:06:20] knowing that God's going to give you
[1:06:22] your babies. Listen, it's a different
[1:06:24] revival. We don't have to wait until
[1:06:27] it's over. We know what'll take place.
[1:06:31] This is a prophetic word.
[1:06:34] I'm not eating history.
[1:06:37] I'm eating to see the fulfillment of the
[1:06:40] prophecy that's coming in life in our
[1:06:42] lives. I already know the walls are
[1:06:45] going to fall. I already know my body's
[1:06:47] going to change. I already know there's
[1:06:49] a theophony waiting on me. I already
[1:06:51] know there's a heaven. I already know
[1:06:52] the devil. Do you see the revival
[1:06:57] feeding from the
[1:07:00] corn of the message,
[1:07:05] digging digging into the sermons and
[1:07:09] coming out with a handful
[1:07:11] of secret food
[1:07:14] give you victory in the middle of your
[1:07:16] battle.
[1:07:18] God bless you. Stand to your feet with
[1:07:19] me tonight.
[1:07:21] Oh yeah.
[1:07:30] Now, being y'all know I believe in the
[1:07:33] Pentecostal blessing, you know, I'm not
[1:07:34] after my Pentecostal blessing.
[1:07:38] If it gets a little bit if it gets a
[1:07:40] little steal in here, I'll preach a
[1:07:41] whole three sermon sets on the
[1:07:43] Pentecostal blessing and experience of
[1:07:44] God in the human life.
[1:07:51] Do you do you see your identification?
[1:07:53] How many knows where you identified?
[1:07:56] You're identified in the pillar of fire.
[1:08:00] And when the pillar of fire was in
[1:08:01] Luther's age, that's the part of Luther
[1:08:04] you are. That's right. But the rest of
[1:08:06] the Luther, you're not. Right. And when
[1:08:10] it moved into the sanctification age,
[1:08:12] that's the part of sanctification you
[1:08:14] are is the part that identifies with the
[1:08:16] pillar of fire. But when it moved into
[1:08:18] the Isuza street in Pentecost and it
[1:08:20] caused tongues and gifts and prophecies
[1:08:22] and all kinds of manifestations that
[1:08:25] identifies the church in that but when
[1:08:28] they begin to denominate and make a show
[1:08:29] out of it and all that stuff that don't
[1:08:32] identify you. That's right. You moved on
[1:08:35] with life.
[1:08:38] You moved on with the life and now
[1:08:41] you're in the
[1:08:43] land. And if you want if you want
[1:08:45] strength for the
[1:08:47] age, you want courage for the
[1:08:49] battle, feed on the secret things.
[1:08:56] I I'm I'm not one y'all know this. I'm
[1:09:00] not one to say to y'all, don't listen to
[1:09:02] other ministers and stuff like that. But
[1:09:04] let me ask you, wouldn't it be good if
[1:09:08] you'd just listen to the prophet for a
[1:09:10] little while
[1:09:12] again? just just for a little while. Go
[1:09:14] back to listening to sir spiritual food
[1:09:17] and season and harvest time and
[1:09:19] unveiling of God.
[1:09:23] Amen. I tell you what'll happen. Some of
[1:09:25] that confusion,
[1:09:27] some of that that fear, it'll start
[1:09:29] going away.
[1:09:34] That's true.
[1:09:36] I believe it. Amen. I believe you can go
[1:09:38] in that little room,
[1:09:41] feed on the secret things.
[1:09:44] Come out there with a sword in your
[1:09:46] hand. Where's my possession?
[1:09:51] I believe it. I believe you can do it
[1:09:53] tonight. Amen. Do you love him? God
[1:09:56] bless you. It's been good to be here
[1:09:57] tonight. Brother
[1:09:59] Ben with
[1:10:01] God in a
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:05] secret place.

[1:10:14] spirit

[1:10:21] face

[1:10:27] power to run.
[1:10:30] Oh, that's it.
[1:10:32] You get power to do it. I
[1:10:37] long to be
[1:10:40] shining with
[1:10:43] God. Oh
[1:10:45] shining,
[1:10:49] shining with
[1:10:52] God in a
[1:10:56] secret
[1:10:59] place.
[1:11:02] There in the
[1:11:05] spirit behold.
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:12] Oh, I'm

[1:11:18] power to run in the race. Oh, how I
[1:11:27] long to be shut
[1:11:31] in with
[1:11:34] God once again. Yes,
[1:11:39] [Applause]
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:43] shut in a sea.
[1:11:47] Go ahead to the sacred
[1:11:50] places.
