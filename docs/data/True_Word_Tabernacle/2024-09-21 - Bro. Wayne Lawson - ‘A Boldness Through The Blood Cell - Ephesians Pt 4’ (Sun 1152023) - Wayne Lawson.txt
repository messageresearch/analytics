========================================

uh we'd like to speak from here this morning if we could Ephesians chapter 1 verses 6 and seven I'm sorry I I just can't hardly ever get used to his presence it's just so it's just breathtaking at times Ephesians chap 1 and verse 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we ask the Lord bless his words you could be seated this morning I I want to speak to you just a few minutes here on the book of Ephesians here this paragraph part six and seven here of uh of Ephesian chapter one uh if I would take a title this morning I would like to just take the title of a boldness through the blood cell a boldness through the blood cell and uh I want to uh refer back to something brother brandham says here in the adoption part three paragraph 86 I think it's a very powerful he said that we could go back and he said we could see Elohim where he self-existent and come back through Jehova who made something who gave man dominion over the earth now what are we waiting for the manifestations the Earth is groaning now let's get down to it and read it all right predestinated unto the adoption of children by himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace what is his grace now back before when he wasn't a father his grace is love made himself a child that we might be predestinated unto the adoption of children to the praise of his grace wherein he has made us acceptable the person the Beloved which is Christ he made us accepted by him and how do we get into him by one Spirit we're all baptized into him in whom we have Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins now how can we preach predestination of God and for anation and setting unless there's a sin atonement somewhere so Prophet is taking the scripture to prove the predestination of God and then he asked it's a it's a very a very powerful question how can we preach predestination as such as we do and not preach an atonement to go along with it because it would be impossible to predestinate without paying the sin debt for man where he's going to be so why is it each day now I'll just reread here this portion how can you preach predestination of God and for ordaining and setting unless there's a sin atonement somewhere why is it that each day you make a mistake and each day you do wrong but if you're born again man or woman as soon as you make that mistake God knows you're sorry for it my you can stand in the president of uh uh presence of President Roosevelt or anybody and say I'm wrong God forgive me for this thing and theirs were the blood atonement you notice sins now the scripture says Redemption through the blood and the Forgiveness of sins now brother Ram said don't forget this book's not to everyone this is to the church he said so forgiveness of sins is not speaking to the sinner because he's not accepted Christ yet he's just a sinner he said but this is speaking to the believer who has already been redeemed and there is a forgiveness of sins now you notice that sins a sinner is a sinner he does not commit sins but the church commits sin does wrong gets a wrong thought has a wrong impression makes Scruples wobbles like a little child walking trying to learn how to walk he just don't know how to walk good yet cuz he's a little boy but we have a hand that reaches down oh God and he steadies us and says make the step this way son he doesn't pick us up and spank us because we made a mistake he doesn't beat us to death because we're trying to walk he loves us like we love our children now if anybody's everever taught a child to walk in here now you're Understanding God's uh attitude toward you as a Believer he's not waiting for something that he can destroy you for but if he sees the if he sees the failure he just reach and pick you up and set you back on your feet now the prophet of God again he'll he'll tell us in Redemption by power it's a powerful sermon if you haven't listened to it it's in 1954 brother BR says but see the trouble with the church today is we're scared to death we're going to make a failure he says but how can you fail when you're in Christ you can't fail he says you've got everlasting life and all demons in hell can't shake you you got everlasting life Jesus said so so don't be scared of failure isn't that powerful don't be scared of failure you say well I'm afraid I'll get to be a fanatic I'd rather have a little fanaticism than to sit still and do nothing he says a man has got to do something he said I was a man getting hired the other day and a fellow said to him he said sign your name here and he said he he took his pencil to sign and he says where's your eraser at and the man says I don't have none he said he said he said I don't make mistakes and he said uh the boss said well I can't use you cuz you ain't going to do nothing he says that's right you don't no make no mistakes he says that means you're not doing nothing amen go ahead amen because you see that when someone does something amen there's always the opportunity for a mistake or a failure or a wobble or a situ a amen but we don't want to be found setting we we don't want to be found just idling along we want to be moving in the presence of God and uh you know when I read things like this it it makes me think of how the prophet says in the message of Grace he said I think of Abraham and all the mistakes that he made now Abraham this great patriarch brother BR immediately Abraham and all the mistakes he made amen and Moses and all of his mistakes he said but when Abraham's commentary AR was written when the Divine commentary was written Paul wrote Abraham's commentary and he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief he said no he says because it wasn't accounted to him Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God and brother R said my humble prayer is by Grace he says I hope mine's wrot like that that he won't see my mistakes that when my commentary is written when my OB is given he said I pray that it won't be able to read out the mistakes that I made and done wrong that he'll only see the things I tried to do for him this is pretty powerful stuff to me Amen in the private interview in 1964 brother bam lays a thought to our sister Bruce who is is is very troubled and brother bam steps in the back right before the Masterpiece and has an interview with her and when he begins to talk to her he describes to her amen about him going to pray for her and he said I'm fixing to pray for you he said but I'm not worthy of that I think but what would Jesus do if he was sitting here now and what would he do if he was sitting here now watch brother BR said in myself now I don't feel like I could do this he said but what would Jesus do if he was sitting here he said he'd lay your hands on you with great faith and you'd get well well I think I think I'm a sinner he said but I'm not but I can come to represent him and remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner and I always like this quote and neither are you amen isn't that powerful but neither are you so brother M explaining to her you're sitting there as a Believer and you're having these struggles with your own mistakes and your own issues and your own problems and he says but see I'm going to be praying for you and I'm in the same seats you are but I've got to pray for you Amen brother B says it one place he talks about going down somewhere said I'm waiting on a vision from the Lord to go pray for a certain person and he said but see after the vision comes it would be the same dirty hands that pray as it would before the vision but Faith In The Blood would remove see it gives the it gives the courage to go ahead and make the prayer it gives you the courage to go ahead and believe and the prophet of God says it like this we got a blood sacrifice laying there and God don't see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ oh he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice but it's Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners anymore we are Christians well glory to God if that could ring through this congregation this morning the devil would lose every battle in every home in every situation and every problem there wouldn't be one amen one defeated soul in this building this morning if you could recognize what the blood of Christ has done for you as an individual and you could just say I'm not a sinner but I'm a Christian I a Believer and Satan just get out of the way this morning because I come to worship God under the power of the blood amen I tell you this when you start seeing the church coming out from under the condemnation standing under the power of the blood sister Bruce is going to is going to argue with brother brandom as we would let's go ahead and read her AR argument I make so many mistakes amen and I fail so many times here's brother bram's answer that's why Christ had to die he says with your mistakes wouldn't be deloted to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him oh my that's what he died for so you could serve him amen if you're sitting here this morning you said brother Wayne My Desire is to serve god brother Ram said that's why he died so that you could serve him without the condemnation of sin but you could serve him and love him with all of your heart when I think of this this morning when he says to her he says your mistakes are not lotted not lotted to you he is your propitiation he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ has took your sins and became you because you desired to serve him I'll tell you one thing amen the devil can can beat you around on a stump amen but he can't take that desire to serve God out of your heart and as long as that desire is in there to serve God there's a blood sacrifice laying there for you as a Believer he said brother man said I said but look sister don't you look at yourself now here's the problem right don't you look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you're trying to do and if you really love the Lord you'll try to serve him with all your heart then all of your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord see he made a way I tell you what I I just in my own studies when I was reading this I just wanted to get up and run around the table or or get up and run around the office or something I mean it just it just it just explodes in your heart to know that God is looking at the desire of the Christian to serve him and that's where it's at do you see Amen brother Bram is is saying some very theologically powerful things here he don't even see you it's hid in the blood now that comes from Colossians chapter 3 you know three and three for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God Amen you're actually hid in God the deity of Jesus Christ brother R said I know people don't realize who you are but every person in here can live above sin can live without sin they can live in God you're going to make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you come on Church your sin is not am mean your mistake is not sin in that way but as a Believer you're already been purchased by the blood and Satan is just trying to stop you he's trying to trap you put you in a place that you can't serve God with all your heart because even the devil knows it you might not know it but you are the most powerful force on the face of the Earth as a son or daughter of God if you could feel a complete Liberty this morning under the power of the blood amen there's nothing can stop a Believer once he contacts the reality that God is not holding sin against him but he's free to serve him and love him with all of his heart amen I'll tell you this in the position of the believer brother maram says in 1955 he says listen he said inside with Christ shut out of the world the very nature of God is in us but still subject to mistakes isn't that amazing I'm so glad he said that I'm so glad brother brandham outlined this for me because he says the believer is in God he says but subject to mistakes now I don't have time to teach the sermon to you but you know there's a cuckle bur nature on the outside and there's a weak nature on the inside and brother B said long we're in this body there's going to be a little bit of a sticky nature now I don't I I I I don't want to teach a teaching but I want to say it like this God's done something in you and even subject to mistakes but God can't see it now here's what he says because it's covered by the blood and God God can't see through the blood every time he looks through the blood he looks it looks white to him now isn't that amazing that God does look but when he looks he looks through the blood you it's amazing to me that God couldn't even see the Ten Commandments that he wrote without looking to the blood to see them that the law would be dispensed with mercy and thank God this morning that this word comes with Mercy it comes with the blood it comes with the nature and the riches of Christ amen that you don't have to remain a sinner amen and bound in situations but as a Believer you have a total right to Liberty now Joshua chapter 1 and verse 5 my Bible says as I was with Moses so will I be with thee and I will not fail thee nor forsake thee 1960 as I was with Moses brother B said it like this Moses had his mistakes he says a great man like like him then when Joshua come up he was going to have his too but God said I was with Moses and so will I be with thee hey man do you know the prophet of God tells us he knew this hour was coming and he knew it was there you know I I find in the age we're living in of course Amen brother bam teaches it all the way back in the 60s and it's only it's only uh exemplified and magnified in our time but we're living in a generation that would like to remove the blood from relationship and worship remove the blood from the church well I I I I have to be honest with you if you remove the blood from a body you have a dead body but the blood is the thing that flows in the body right it's a constant movement is the blood and if you don't have blood in a body you don't have life in a body but you need the blood our songs need to be about blood our ministry has to include the blood our worship has to have the blood because we worship God under the power of his atoning blood and what he's done for us you know the blood you you can look in the Bible and you can see the you can see the thread of the of the blood all the way through the scriptures you know I I I I was just sitting here thinking amen of of how you could just Trail it and I don't go long in it but I'll say this from the very first fall in the Garden of Eden blood showed up it was not an angel it was not it was not just a messenger or a prophet but it was God himself saw his children in problems amen and he went and got something to fix the problem he made a way amen that he might be able to keep his child and God himself killed an animal and brother B said god is perfect in his decisions so his first decision had to be a correct decision and that decision was to use the blood to cover his children to keep them amen and if God did it there he would have to do it in every decision throughout history or the future of the world God chose blood there in the garden when he wrapped his children in a bloody skin it was there when the first lamb died it was Noah the first thing he done after the flood the very first thing that Noah does in the new world is show that the blood is still God's program it was the blood amen that Abraham on a Lonely Mountain with Isaac when he places Isaac on the Altar and he's going to take a human sacrifice but God said not this Blood of this Isaac's going to work but I have a created spoken word over here and it's going to carry a blood that will take the place of your children and the lives of your children and there it was on that Lonely Mountain where there was the slain of an innocent blood oh think of it friend it was there that it spoke from that mountain we're talking about it thousands of years later because it was saying the blood would be what would atone for man time it would be the children of God who were in slavery in Egypt and when they got ready to leave Egypt now how would they leave they would leave under the Seal of the blood it was the blood that brought them out it was the blood that redeemed them it was the blood that set them apart from all the other Egyptians showing us that it would be nothing less than the blood today that that God would be able to separate us and bring us into his Mercy the blood is what stained the ground there at calvary's Cross but it wasn't just any blood it was the blood of God's only begotten son and that blood would speak from the ground it would be different than what Cain's blood when it accused his Brethren and it would put his brother under judgment but this blood that fell on the ground in the middle of the Bible would be that which spoke of redemption and the glory of God that would be what would say the Heathen from the other nations you can see the thread all the way back there with Rahab when Rahab was there see that was saving other nations she was connected to the thread you couldn't see it but you could see that he man I I I don't know how to how to say it but Joshua parallels Ephesians correctly and when the walls of Jericho were falling what is it that saves her so it was blood and coming out and it was blood going in and when they begin to fall the walls of Jericho fell amen ell it's powerful to know Rahab lived in the wall of Jericho and brother said look how thick them walls were she lived in the wall in a house in that wall and our Bible said the wall completely fell down around the walls of Jericho but there was one little section of that entire wall amen that brother R said not even a rock moved out of the wall of rahab's house and what held it all together was that tread that was hanging out that window and let me say this morning in a world that's shaking that thread is still hanging out of the window of the Bride of Jesus Christ when the world is falling apart brother there's a Believer here this morning that is saying my house is under the token and I found the blood and it's been applied to my home it's a thread that held it all together it's a thread that holds congregations together it's a thread that holds families together it's what holds our lives together it's nothing but the blood but all of the blood that was in the Bible only spoke of the blood of the Son of God all the way in the back of the Bible in the middle of the Bible and even in the end of the Bible yeah all the way in Revelations 12 it's being spoken spoke back there and he said it's by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony that we would overcome it's in Revelations 19 when he comes from the heavens of Heaven riding on a white horse and he's got a vesture that is dipped in blood it is God's program it has always been his program it will remain God's program it is the blood of Jesus Christ which is an eternal and Redemptive promise to every believer and wants to come to God blood is God's plan in Hebrews the 9th chapter my Bible says that there is no sin remitted without the blood without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins the blood is God's plan blood has always been God's program blood is God's program and that's the only way that sin can be remitted is by the blood Matthew 26 and 28 for this Blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins it was a wine that was being presented to the believer but it was only a symbol of the one that was holding it that the blood of the Son of God would be the only way to remit sin and it would be the blood of this New Covenant Amen in Matthew 26 and 28 it would be for the remission of sins brother bandom tells us in the book of Acts when they started baptizing people of course people begin to say it was by what baptism that sins were remitted entire denominations have built on it's the water that saves you amen but you know what that ain't correct at all because it's the blood that saves man amen the Bible teaches us it was the blood if it was water baptism amen that poor thief on the right would have never made it it was it was they received the Holy Ghost before they were ever baptized the first Gentiles had ever received the Holy Ghost they received it and then were baptized you see you're not saved by the water you're saved by the blood but the blood in this age is not a chemistry that we can sprinkle on you but it's the baptism of the holy ghost that comes on the church that presence you feel this morning that anointing that is upon the church is nothing less than the blood of Jesus Christ and giving back evidence that the blood is real he's raised from the grave we're not here as a bloodless church or a bloodless worship but the anointed worship and the anointed preach ing is a Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the blood the blood the blood will never lose its [Applause] power well [Music] Hallelujah my Bible said repentance and remission of sins should be preached in the name among all the nations beginning at Jerusalem Acts chapter 2 said repent and be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus for the remission of sins now I do not believe water remits sins but it's the blood that remits sins in Ephesians 1 and 7 it tells us that Redemption is through the blood isn't that powerful we have Redemption through the blood isn't that amazing that Redemption Could Happen by the of another that Redemption the the redeeming of the church was not your doing at all is't that amazing you cannot pull yourself to the Moon by your bootstraps neither can you cleanse yourself neither can you redeem yourself but but the Bible tells us this it's as if a a a leopard is licking Its Spots amen now you don't what that that means he's only showing the spot really exist when he starts the mud might have mingled the spot with the rest of but when he starts licking it just shines when man tries to cover himself with something besides the blood it just shines it shines Humanity do you see Redemption brother Ram says Ken have been Redeemer Redemption actually is applied in the Greek word to having a slave from a market he said said I can't spell the Greek word just now I like him he I get brother bradam he said I can't spell it and he didn't even try to pronounce it he just says it takes a slave from the market it's redeemed sir to redeem means to take a slave from the market a man has done something wrong Master sold him into slavery actually under death and he's in a market he's a slave but a man comes along a worthy man that's able to do it and he finds this man and finds Grace in his side he redeems him and this takes him from the slave market takes him out to himself notice and the slave once redeemed I I hope you're listening real close sir a slave once redeemed can never be sold in the market again I think it deserves a praise God he can never be sold again he's marketed and if he was thought of enough one time to be redeemed no one can never sell him again for a Slave oh thanks to God that when a man once comes to Christ has been redeemed by the precious blood the devil can never make you a slave again well Hallelujah then the slave belt has been taken off brother we don't have to keep it around just in case but we can throw it away because we'll never need the devil's slave belt again this bride is free and she's not only free for one day she's free until just she takes a Rapture she'll not come back under the slave belt but she is free he's come to Christ has redeemed Us by the precious blood the devil can never make you a slave again you're secure in the blood of Christ until the day of your Redemption a slave look it up in the Exodus and find out if you can't find it levitical law a slave once redeemed can never be sold again as a slave brother Brams reading at levitical law he's telling you that God set you at Liberty not to be in bondage again watch Paul tell you in Galatians 5 he's speaking to people who understood the law and he said Stand Fast in the Liberty wherein Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage look at what he's saying to you now now if you go into the Greek in this it actually means it like this it it literally would mean in our wording it would say for Freedom Christ has set you free he didn't set you free to be a slave he sets you free to be free you see it's just like sometimes people come out of certain situations and and they're looking maybe trying uh the devil tried to put them something so but God never brought you out of one thing to go into something else he brought you out to be free now what because the Bible said if the son shall make you free and John 8 he said You shall be free indeed if Jesus made you free you'll not be a bond slave to a church entity or a religion or a denomination or a click of preachers or a great big bunch of people you will be free and free indeed free to love God free to serve God come on Church y'all know what I'm talking about amen I'm tired of people trying to dictate worship to the church amen I believe in Liberty let the quiet people be quiet with Liberty but let the dancers dance with li Liberty let the shouts Shout with Liberty God didn't make everybody the same he made us different but we are different by God's grace and we can have Liberty in our differences because Christ has met us free we are free indeed you know what I mean brother randam said I walked into that Zoo the other day and I seen them Eagle in there beating again them bars he said I'd give everything I had to set him free now brother Brandon wasn't buying him to take him to to the house and put him in the down there in the closet or to put him in his own cage brother Randon wasn't talking about buying the eagle so he can reage him in his own manm B cage he wanted him to go back to the skies he come out of this message never liberated you to put you in another cage of denomination of man's made building listen if this bride is behind bars they are manmade bars God never barred the church God never set the church and amen well glory be to God you can put all the wet blankets you want on it but there's a fire that it's burning in True Word Tabernacle that'll burn up every wet blanket it'll burn up every oppressing spirit amen go back to hell where you come from devil amen we will refuse the oppression of this leot ofan age we are children of the light we worship with [Applause] Liberty so preacher what are you talking about y'all y'all know what I'm talking about everybody's trying to label everybody right now you're either on the intellectual side formalism or you're on the fanatical worship side where it's just emotional driven and everybody tried to make you one or the other well look we ain't [Applause] either brother B said if I could get the fundamentals to get with the people who worship if I could just get them together well this is that this right here is that the prophet said that's what I want and brother I believe the word of God is produced assemblies amen that believe the message and you can't teach it too deep and you can't teach it too strong but brother you better get out of the way cuz this message has power in it and it starts releasing worship within them I know I know I know it's oppositional but listen for such a time was you put here to meet the opposition right right now anybody knows that that's the that's the opposition right that's the challenge if you're a real worshipper and it's funny I I'll watch you I I'll show you something real quick now we'll move on I I I can't preach too long I got some preaching to do but y'all know what I'm talking about but you watch this how many quiet people in here ever felt pressure to be something different than you were I mean honest from your heart felt like somebody was pushing you for amens and pushing you for sure you felt that way sir the same way you feel about that I feel that way when someone says I can't amen isn't that a it's the same thing just turn different so it should be a liberty right so so so that that wherever God can just have Liberty because then it feels now how many people in here that shouted and danced that have filed a pressure to not do that just be honest now yes sir do you see that the devil the opposition is to pressure both sides to make them uncomfortable where they can't relax themselves in the presence of God so if someone's teaching on the teaching side the shouters will think well they're against me and they'll get quieter and Tighter but then you get on the other side and somebody pushing for amens and then the quieter people will start tightening up even tighter because quiet people are not nor noty don't never mix up quiet with tight we got some quiet people in here that'll pull the buttons off of my shirt we're not preaching from here we're preaching from here it ain't the noise level it's the anointing and the spirit when it begins to pull it opens a gift and out of that gift then starts flowing things that transpires in the life so it's an opposition but through the blood cell we've got a boldness to meet the opposition and you've been anointed to meet the opposition for such a time like this has God anointed you who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world so this Blood he gave would be a deliverer from the present evil from the darkness of this age in Colossians 1 he says he has delivered us from the power of Darkness now it's easy to say power of Darkness watch the next verse and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son so darkness and Kingdom watch what he's doing he's switching from light and darkness to Kingdom so he's using darkness in one and Kingdom in the other telling you Satan's kingdom is just one word off but God is taking you out from under s Satan's kingdom and placing you in the Kingdom of his son where the word is given power where the word is giving power translated watch this next verse in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins watch him separate him again Redemption and the Forgiveness of sins brother bam is translating this as meaning that the redeemed still have the blood for their sins Hallelujah their mistakes thank you they're failures Hallelujah Redemption now watch here in the Greek I'll give you the word here amen it actually means Redemption we're still on Redemption redemption or Deliverance it means a releasing affected by payment of Ransom amen a releasing that has been caused by payment or Ransom See Redemption means a Deliverance or a Liberation preceded by the payment of a ransom in Matthew chapter 20 Amen in verse 28 even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and gave his life a ransom somebody say Ransom with me a li a ransom so all of you know somebody kidnapped somebody here while back there was arist of of a big a big family out in California got kidnapped by The Liberation Army uh it's been years and years back but she was in out there and they were demanding millions of handsome for her demanding Millions for just one person because she had a wealthy family and here the scripture says we have Redemption through his grace even the Forgiveness of sins because of the riches of his grace amen so God's grace was so rich that that he was demanding a ransom that exceeds what anybody else could pay can you imagine that you were worth more to God and he put such a pain payment of Ransom on you that nobody else could redeem you think about it God set a price on you only he could pay by doing that he knew no one else would ever own you Hallelujah he put a price tag nobody else can pay it nobody else can pay what God desired for you to be paid for he put that kind of price tag and then he knew only he could pay the price for your Ransom so the Bible said he gave his life for a ransom for many man I Hallelujah 1 Timothy Chapter 2 and verse 6 he gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time acts chap 20 and verse 28 look what he said take heed therefore unto yourselves and feed the flock of the Holy Ghost have made you overseer to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood now sometimes people wonder why that I take the direction towards the church I do and mostly it's always positive isn't it I'll tell you why I'll give you a secret because you're the Blood Bought bride of Jesus Christ this is the wife of Jesus Christ this is the queen of all of Heaven might just be somebody almost nobody to some people but in heaven the greatest Price that has ever been paid to Ransom anything that has ever lived was paid for you brother random actually says it like this he said which would be more precious he says the thing or the thing it buys he said if we had a blood drop of Jesus Christ how we would cherish that blood drop he said but look it it purchased a people so the people it bought is worth more than the blood that was given for it so we're literally handling the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ to me to me it's the greatest uh opportunity in the world to address the queen of all of Heaven yes sir to remind you that the price has been paid for you and you've been liberated from God by God bought with a price for you are 1 Corinthians 6: 20 you are bought with a price you are bought with a prize that's why we are not our own we've been bought with a prize amen now in First Peter chapter 1 watch what Peter brings around amen he said for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things of silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers now I don't have time to dig into this but I want to say this to you in the Old Testament you heard me mention it Sunday morning when I said that a a priest would place a value on a soul they actually had had prices for the number of men who were of a certain age in the sanctuary and they put gold and silver in the Tabernacle that was a payment for them firstborn Sons had to be bought out of the firstborn because they were brought out of the priesthood otherwise they immediately a firstborn son would become a priest amen that's why you called The Church of the firstborn but you would but but there was a payment that was made but but but it was it was a prize a ransom paid silver and gold do you but it's a powerful thing to watch in scripture cuz nobody ever paid a ransom for Jesus in his birth and being a firstborn son he become a priest though after the order of mecdc he come from the line of Judah not from Levi he had no right as a levite as a Jew he had no right as a priest but he come through the line of Judah and become a king priest now y'all know there was no price paid for his birth so he had to enter the service of the priesthood as a firstborn the scripture said he was the firstborn of many Brethren now there was then gold and silver in the Old Testament was placed in the treasuries for the Redemption of the souls because God knew the price had to be paid but watch how Peter says this but you can't redeem these people with gold and silver am right listen there's not enough gold in the world to redeem you on now you could take all of the gold in the world and it could not buy one Soul you could take all the silver there is in the world and it could not redeem or ransom one Soul that's why Peter says in the next verse he said but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without BL and now that word precious oh precious is the flow that makes me whiter than snow no other Fountain I know it's nothing but the blood of Jesus it would seem to be just blood but it could do what no other blood could do for 4,000 years they had bled animals and oxen and poured out thousands and thousands and thousands of gallon and of blood and it had never removed one sin from anybody it only pushed it Forward amen they paid ransoms and it didn't help and they piled gold in the sanctuaries and it didn't help but one drop of the blood of Jesus Christ was so precious that it could pay the payment of the sin that was against man from the Garden of Eden all the way to the rapturing of the church I don't know if you've ever thought about it but the blood of Jesus Paid the debt of Adam and all the way through Abraham and Moses and every child that God had up through them ages and if you're an Old Testament Bible reader he was a bunch of Scallywags come up through that Isaac line but the blood paid it for it all the blood paid for David's problems and Solomon's problems and Abraham's problems it paid for the whole thing it paid for every disob obedience it paid for every trouble it pray for every adultery it pray for every broken but listen brother it's more powerful than that this payment is so powerful that one payment at the cross would remove sin forever from the blood amen of the children of God who would be Abraham's line there was sin forgiven at the cross that you hadn't even committed yet the payment was made and the sin was disced was destroyed that you haven't even committed Yet brother Darren there is no trustee in the world that could foretell all of the expenses of a church and we're about ready to get to build a church here before long Brother Ray has a few things to say to help us uh understand where we are in the process but let me say this to you the best you can plan you're going to have to add cost to it you can say it's going to cost D D D D and put a dot and that's the end of it but brother it's not to you finish that you know our trustees are good ones but none of them has a sharp enough pencil to tell us in 10 years where our church will be financially what it will need and how it will have no debt or we have nobody available that can do that right now but our lord Jesus from Calvary he screamed the last words out of his lips and said it is finished the some of the greatest words that would ever be spoken from human lips it is finished the debt has been paid from Adam all the way to the change of the church it is finished amen sin debt had been settled now think about this folks now some of these sicknesses that were having now our doctors wouldn't have knew about in the 50s and 60s but when he took them stripes in his back he paid the payment of every disease and every sin everything that was and would come no wonder Paul could say that things present nor things past nor things future can separate me from the love of God there has been a payment made that no man could retract no man could sell me back into slavery we are free by the blood of Jesus Christ may I say it I wish I had the voice of a thousand angels to say it the precious blood of Jesus oh my God my God my God the precious blood s the precious blood the one that could use an evangelist's hand to touch a tumor and make it disappear that's the blood I'm talking about I'm talking about the blood that can come down in the prayer line and Swit the anointing over you and you live differently than you [Applause] [Music] came brother Seth's not here this morning he's sick but I pray online he told me when he come through the prayer line over the camp meeting he said brother Wayne I walked in they had to carry me out yeah see the precious blood that is not just precious in those days it has never lost its value inflation can't touch [Music] it it'll buy as much today as it bought back then the precious blood Peter calls it why is it precious cuz it can do what nothing else can do it can pay what nothing else can pay it can clean the hearts that nothing else can clean the Bible called it the Fuller soap is't that amazing brother man said what could clean the hands of Lady mcabe he said I tell you the blood of Jesus not can only clean the hand it can clean her heart and I don't care what sinner I don't care how low they are dope smokers drunks whoremongers whatever whatever wherever they are bring them in and let me show you the blood of Jesus Christ will clean every heart it'll clean every man don't you dare put your nose in the air and say we ain't got no place for them yes we do bring them in and let the blood let the blood of Jesus clean them up it's the precious blood oh if I was a singer I'd break out in song what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what is it could make me whole again brother levit it's nothing but the blood of Jesus some things are better left alone folks listen when you get something fixed quit digging it up and buing and burying some people say brother Wayne I'm going to go back through these things I'm going to go back through my past and brother I'm going I'm going to fix all these things sometimes you're not fixing sometimes you're tearing up because if the blood has forgave you leave it there and go on with God come on about every time you get one step up the rung the devil pours condemnation on you and tries to drive you back 20 years in your life Paul said this very thing he said I have not yet reached Perfection but this thing I do I forget the things that are behind me and I press on to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus listen well glory to God we don't need a couch for the psychologist we need an altar with a power of God can cleanse hearts and minds and change [Applause] lives it's the precious blood of Jesus that was for ordained before the foundation of the world to manifest it let me say this very clearly it was not human blood that's why it's so precious it wasn't human blood it was God's blood brother man said how was it God's blood he said God condescended through the word and came in the womb of a woman amen and brought a creative blood that would change lives it washed in Revelations 1:5 amen it's John that says brother Abraham is John that he just opens up and says that he that has loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood brother Bram comes along and he said the word wash is not a good word there he said let's use this word loosed let's loose the people from their sins Hallelujah yes Lord now if the son has set you free you're free GL the word means loose brother Ram says if it was the blood of God the blood of the Lamb the Precious Blood of lamb first Peter the Precious Blood of the Lamb they call it the blood of lamb in one scripture but the blood of God in another scripture so that was God's lamb right and it done what no other lamb could do Redemption is through the blood Colossians 1:14 said in whom we have Redemption through his blood in Isaiah 53:10 it said it pleased the Lord to bruise him he have put to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he became our high priest and a priest was to offer blood is that right the blood that the high priest offered in the Old Testament they had to offer it every year isn't that amazing it was an atonement date y Kapur they've done it every year because the power of the blood of a sacrifice could not pay the ransom so they had to redo it every year amen but here the Bible Paul is this great Master teacher brother Bram calls him this great Master teacher says this that by the blood of Jesus he entered one time he went in one time I want you to hear me now he entered in one time and perfected forever those that are Sanctified amen you don't need perfecting every week he entered in one time he went in one time and it was enough the Bible said he did it once and for all isn't that powerful so brother Wayne I'll tell you what man we we we we've got issues and we need another crucifixion do you know that's one of Moses's mistakes it's right there in the scripture one of Moses's biggest mistakes is because the The Rock was in the wilderness now we didn't know The Rock was Christ until Paul comes along and said that rock was Christ and then brother random comes along and picks it up and he said it was a masterpiece but it had yet been formed it was Christ in prefigure he said and when God had the children of Israel come under judgment Moses Struck it with his Rod a wooden stick showing Calvary in the desert gave them life moisture come from the rock isn't that powerful but a little later they needed water again and God said to Moses speak to the Rock and he smoke the rock again and the prophet said he broke the scripture when he did it right but God still honored his word now put that in a legal box and tell me how it comes out see now watch this God still honored his word but brother B said but what he done was testified of a second crucifixion he said and Jesus wouldn't have to die again because one time would be enough isn't it amazing that one time in the presence of the blood of Jesus Christ is Enough it is enough to take a man from a bar stool and fill him with the Holy Ghost it's enough to take a religion out of a man and put the Holy Ghost in him just one drop will'll do I tell you what I I love the songwriters that climb up this mountain where there still Springs a fountain there's still a fountain flowing in the house of David a spring of the righteousness of the blood that could wash a man this blood has become the mediator of a brand new testament The Testament the New Testament it was Jesus that prayed it according to Paul he said I come to do thy will oh Lord he said I come to do thy will oh God see sacrifices and offerings he would have not but a body thou Hast prepared Jesus body prepared sacrifice as a lamb to the slaughter Jesus was slain to pay the ransom price for the church and he Sanctified us through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all it was the will of God hear it in Paul he came to do the will of God hear it in Jesus prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane not my will but thy will be done first shedding of the blood seven sheddings first one took place in the garden he died for the will of man when his blood dropped as sweat out of his brow in painful Agony he gave up his own will as a human being brother B said he could have had a family he could have had children he said he could have had a normal life but he set all of that aside for the will of God to die as a sacrifice for the church hallelujah thank youus see nothing else will work and he said it and you've heard me say it before but he said it very clearly when he said if there be some other way let the cup pass from me if there might be another way so he he know assuredly there's not another way this is God's only provided way somebody says well come and join the church sorry it's not the way come and shake a hand with the preacher it's not the way come put your name on our book it's not the way can we join your church brother Bram said I've been a brandom for 40 years I never joined the family he said I was born into the family and it's the family of God you don't have to join the family you're born into the family brother bam said of course he was born of brandom so when you're born again you're born not by your human name you're born by a new name this this Blood has redeemed us from the curse of the law this Blood according to Revelations 5:9 has redeemed us to God Hallelujah the Bible said when John saw this he saw his name on the book and when it opened up now it's amazing to me that some of the end time preachers even in the message when they seen the old of the seals they quit preaching the blood thinking that Mercy had quit when John didn't even scream about the blood till the book opened but when the book opened he held a Revival on the blood he held a Revival and begin to sing songs about it that the blood has redeemed us out of every Kindred Nation tongue and people the blood the blood has done it for us it was God's plan is God's plan will always be God's plan it is the law of Redemption how many remembers the law of redemption brother B tells the law of redemption I'm not read it to you but the law of redemption brother M includes it in the law of Kinsmen and then he brings it to the law of redemption gives us two different laws law of redemption law of Kinsmen the law of redemption he he tells it powerful in the kinsman redeemer brother Tom spoke a lot about kinsman redeemer last weekend I thought it was very good amen Ty Ruth and Boaz in there but you but you it's amazing because it it's reliving again now because we're returning to Israel we see Israel returning to its Nation as in the Book of Ruth you have a Holocaust in the 1940s you had one start in the Book of Ruth they all died and then they went to their Homeland and Ruth went with them do you know that when the prophet came on the scene he said three prophets come out between the sixth and seven seal he said two went to Israel and one come to the Gentiles so it was happening at the same time now they ain't showed up yet out there but they'll be there and it was happening at the same time but when Ruth got there she needed a Kinsman to meet the law of redemption and remember whenever that Boaz decided to redeem her I'm not going to preach on it when Boaz decided to redeem her that he had to go to the elders and testify because he had to meet the requirements of the law so when he be to explain how he was kin to Naomi and he had a right to the land she owned and that he could redeem it amen the Bible says that they had had to they had to acknowledge he's worthy Kinsman when John saw this in Revelation chapter 5 whenever they saw the lamb come out with the book The Bible said all of the elders begin to say Worthy is the Lamb he didn't come to do away with the law he come to fulfill the law and when the law was fulfilled Even Heaven had to say he's worthy to be the Kinsman of these people he is is their blood sacrifice and lamb and they have the right now to all of the inheritance that has been lost law of kinsman brother B says the law of kinsman is best explained because you can actually uh I'm going to use a better word for for our young people but it's best explained when you talk about the Redemption of a of a donkey and brother BR said any old donkey can be redeemed any old donkey but brother BR said but particular case he tells it you remember and he said particular case was when one donkey was born he said he was a little donkey first born he said he had Lop ears and crossey and knot knees and bold legs y'all heard him talk about it he said he was an ugly fell and he said when a little boy got little little fella got up you know I don't know maybe he wandered over to a pond or to a creek or something but he got a reflection of himself yeah because it scared him and he said you know what I'm probably going to die the first first moment that farmer lays eyes on me he's going to take my life because I'm useless to him and and and and brother Bram said he had a good scripture taught mother and said she seen the state he was in and said what's wrong with you said well I seen myself the other day and my ears are lot my back is bold and my knees are not my eyes are crossed I'm all I'm just all messed up this farmer ain't going to want me for nothing he's going to kill me and she she said but wait a minute you don't know the law here so what law is that there's a law that can save you it's called The Law of redemption and said what it is is that here in Israel when when a mule is born that a farmer has to offer a lamb for the first born of the Matrix it has to it has to offer a lamb for this mule she said so son when the farmer comes out he's not looking for a mule to sacrifice they don't sacrifice mules here they sacrifice Lambs he said so he's going to look for a perfect lamb so in the morning when the when the farmer comes out he's not even looking over to mule he sees there's a mule there but then he goes to looking looking for a lamb and when he finds that perfect lamb he bottles him up and takes him in I can see that little fellow over there with his knot KNE and crosseyed and he's having him a time probably knocked over a song book you know what it was about it was about that there was a it was there was a lamb and he had to examine that lamb to see so when they started examining the lamb brother B said see he never examined the donkey if you ever catch this Revelation he not trying to examine you he examines your [Music] lamb my lamb is the perfect Son of God and the scripture said we were accepted in the Beloved and the Bible said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased My Sacrifice has accepted in Calvary it was accepted in heaven My Sacrifice is the blood of Jesus Christ so when God comes down this morning he's not looking at me he's looking at My Sacrifice oh the blood of Jesus this morning that comes across the church to realize he's not looking at you he's looking at your sacrifice hallelu Hallelujah some of you some of you got troubles and I I know you do some of your home some of your family some of the issues and I know some sometimes you run into problems and sometimes as ministers Brother Ray can really agree with me here on this he he he'll understand this portion real well sometimes people can't understand how you can work with certain individuals because they have already decided that they're not workable sincerely the difference is a burden and when God puts a burden on your heart to help someone you see things differently it's kind of like a kind of like Aiden seeing an old house and he sees a home place somebody else may have just seen an old house but go by and look at it looks pretty good these days but he saw something he wanted to fix and instead of letting somebody say well that ain't no you you're just wasting your time there he said it ain't wasting time I want to be here I got a burden here and I have the ability to do this and so he started working until now you it don't even resemble but you know even prophets feel this way in the Bible have you ever read the book of Hosea do you know that the prophet was wondering how God do you put up with these people I'll just put it I'll just put it simple he was a little bit uh Lord how do you keep dealing with these people and God said I want you to go take a wife of whoredom yeah yeah you're going to understand me in a minute and he goes and takes a wife and has children by her now his family is invested so he's going to teach Hosea what Grace means sometimes you have to go outside of your reasoning to hold something together the law might say this needs to be done and that needs to be done but Grace but Grace thank God for Grace that'll look at the same situation and say no we don't have to throw it away Grace can fix this amen and you know you know the story so hose's wife she does what she's been doing her whole life and she goes right back into whoredom but this time she's married it's different now do you see after you become a Christian Christian it's different now yeah am you say well I'm going to go back and do go ahead just go on you just go do whatever you want to do just go do it we ain't holding you from doing nothing do you know what's going to happen about three days in you're going to find yourself on the motel floor and you're going to say God why am I acting like this you're going to be in your bedroom somewhere and you're going to throw that something whatever you're holding you'll throw it again the wall and you'll say I'm a Son of God I don't want this in my life because come on I know I know that once you're married it's different now and once you're saved it's different now you can't be the old Jew anymore you can run you can hide you can do whatever you want you will never be that old man anymore he's dead and he can never be sold back into slavery again God paid a price for you you're a free church he paid for you he redeemed you he ransomed you y'all know the story so the Bible said that Hosea went down there and bought her he went down there and B he bought his own wife amen silver and barley which only is a story to tell Hosea if you ever had your wife in the shape my wife's end You' pay the price to get her out of it and to every individual sitting here this morning I want you to know that the ultimate price has been paid the ultimate price has been paid for your life for your families it's been paid for every person brother Eric testify to everybody you can and tell them as long as they got life in their ball as long as life is moving through I don't care what denomination they are I don't care what church they're in if it's the life is in their body they have an opportunity to serve God and and and God help us to remember this it's different it's different once you give your heart to the Lord our musicians come I I remember I remember when I was sitting I was sitting in a in a service and I had been I mean early on in my life and I I I just come in and I I hate to tell it's shameful to me it's not a but I I chewed tobacco I'll just say just put it out there I chewed Copenhagen tobacco it was the I was a South and Southern boy and that was the thing to do if you didn't have a if you didn't have a ring in your pocket you wouldn't cool I think some people just put a gum box or something in there so they had to look at you know but I I went ahead and entered in the whole thing man I could I could take a Copenhagen Can and it had paper on it and they were tight I don't know if any you ever saw them but they were tight and had to open it you know well man I got so good at that I could just hang it on a tooth and open then I give my life to the Lord yeah started serving the lord man that thing was a struggle and it was back and forth and three days on two days off back and forth back and forth and I sit in the church one day and they worship service was going on I wanted to Worship the Lord but I was so condemned I started trying to count up the days how long it been since I chewed anybody ever been there maybe it wasn't chewing tobacco but you know now I was counting up the days and a voice spoke to me just as clear and he said you've never done it in the first place in the moment when that come and it was another he spoke right behind it and he said and you will never have to do it again and when the presence of God settled on me I left that church service that day and next day I was driving and I was going down to the home place there's a couple miles and some of the boys I went to school with and chew to backa with and you know hung around with all the time one of the boys was walking and I stopped and picked him up he' walked up town and got him a big old can of Copenhagen he jumps in my truck and you know we're Copenhagen buddies so he jumps right in my truck first thing he does whip out a can and he starts trying to open it you know so I reached over brother Earl reached over and grabbed that can and I hung it going going to put it in that tooth just to and just as I got it about right here I got it sick I got so sick I thought dear God what's wrong with me and I went to do it I mean my insides turned inside out and I realized I didn't have to ever do that again you don't have to you don't have to won't you stand to your feet with us today thank you Jesus you know there's the there's the redeemed and there's the Redeemer there's the price of redemption but you know something brother Bram said he said when the church gets into the heavens he said the angels will have to stand with their wings folded because they'll sing a song This redeemed will sing a song that the Angels can't sing isn't that amazing they sing a song they can't even sing I tell you this morning what a what a time to remember what God's done for you the Redemption the Redemption that he's made for you what a what a tremendous day to think of God you saved me You You released [Music] me brother Bram said you remember he stood in that museum with a fellow and he said he said he's seen a fella come in I believe brother Ram himself was there but he said a man come in he said they were looking at the at the Museum of Abraham Lincoln and said there was a colored man standing behind him and he sing the dress there where Mr Lincoln had been shot and his blood had Spilled Out on the dress and he said the ma' just stand there [Music] weeping he said see that blood was the blood that took the slave belt off me he said if a man could say that about the blood of Lincoln see that blood was the blood that took the slave belt took it all of me to never be a slave [Music] again look we owe him we owe him our praise and our worship you let no Spirit come back along and start to op press in your mind and condemning you and and holding you under that you've been liberated for his freedom I don't know about you just in the study of this sermon I just was going over some of them quotes brother Greg it just carried me away I caught I caught myself thinking about Theon night that I met the Lord and and then when he filled me with his anointing and the spirit [Music] and I just lay in the bed last night and just for a time I couldn't help it I just brother Ash I just laid there and wept thinking about the years and what God has done and his mercies and I never started out to be a preacher I didn't start out to be that I just wanted to be a Christian I never started out saying Lord I'm going to travel here and I'm going to do this and I'm going to I didn't even have that in my mind I just wanted to be a Christian I just want to be free I wanted to serve the Lord and stand in a meeting and put my hands up and feel the conviction of the Holy Ghost and be out from under the bondage of all the sin and the the world that I was living in to have that kind of Liberty and friend that desire has never left me this is this you know if somebody comes to your house tomorrow and they got a sweep Stakes check and they tell you you want a million dollars well that person's happy for you but they're not invested but let me say this to you I I'm carrying a message we we have won a million [Music] dollars my name's on the check too not just a preacher up here preaching about something but I'm a part of this to see the covering of that blood and what it could do for our hearts and what could do for you this morning just to remember remember that you're free remember your sacrifices made remember this you don't have to live under that condemning it's it's you don't have to live that way you could have such Liberty this morning cuz he's so merciful to [Music] us
