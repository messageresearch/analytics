[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:20] you know
[1:04:22] a lot of believers
[1:04:24] of this message
[1:04:27] we got to the place where
[1:04:29] we're so revelated
[1:04:31] so advanced in our own mind so
[1:04:33] intellectual
[1:04:34] in our understanding of this message
[1:04:38] you know until we got so far away
[1:04:41] from emotion
[1:04:42] we just can't feel anymore
[1:04:49] but you know in the simplicity of god
[1:04:52] someone captured that in a song many
[1:04:54] years ago
[1:04:56] a lovely little song
[1:04:59] that goes like this i sing because
[1:05:06] that's what it is friends
[1:05:08] you know if some people leave the seat
[1:05:09] of the scornful and
[1:05:11] and join a group of young people like
[1:05:14] this that's what you would discern in
[1:05:15] the hearts of sincere young people
[1:05:18] is a genuine and a
[1:05:20] and a true and an earnest passion for
[1:05:23] the word of god
[1:05:24] something on the inside bubbling a
[1:05:26] response to the word
[1:05:28] amen we sing because we're happy it's
[1:05:30] not a whole lot deeper than that we
[1:05:32] shout because we're happy we dance
[1:05:35] because we're happy we say ma'am
[1:05:38] because we're happy
[1:05:40] we get excited
[1:05:41] we feel something
[1:05:45] many people are afraid of getting a
[1:05:46] little out of order brother branham said
[1:05:48] one time and why it has to be shepherds
[1:05:49] he's talked about that great shepherd
[1:05:51] when he was smitten back there
[1:05:53] he said it was finished
[1:05:56] brother graham said that minute as soon
[1:05:58] as that shepherd was smitten it was over
[1:06:01] sin is settled there was no more sin
[1:06:04] they were clean and the penalty was paid
[1:06:06] and the believers whose names were
[1:06:08] written in the book of life
[1:06:10] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:06:12] world it was finished the very minute
[1:06:15] that jesus said it was finished
[1:06:18] amen brother ram said no wonder the
[1:06:20] mountains jumped and shouted on that day
[1:06:23] no wonder the sun hit its face and
[1:06:25] screamed for joy no wonder all nature
[1:06:28] broke loose the wind shook the trees
[1:06:30] until they shook and shook and joyed and
[1:06:33] jumped because they seen the prophet
[1:06:35] shepherd on the mountain redeem every
[1:06:38] name on the book of life and they seen
[1:06:40] that their own nature was redeemed they
[1:06:42] screamed and jumped and the world went
[1:06:44] into an earthquake and the mountains
[1:06:46] rent and the rocks fell out and the sun
[1:06:48] went down and everything took place
[1:06:52] he said that's like any meeting when the
[1:06:54] shepherd reveals to you that it's
[1:06:57] finished
[1:06:58] he said i've seen jumping spells and joy
[1:07:00] spells but there was nobody hurt
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:03] but the mountains amen nobody hurt and
[1:07:06] he said and i've seen meetings where the
[1:07:08] power of god was revealed to the people
[1:07:10] that they were free from the world and
[1:07:12] the things of the world and the joy of
[1:07:14] the lord filled the congregation they
[1:07:16] stood and screamed and cried and shouted
[1:07:19] to the top of their voice for the glory
[1:07:21] of god i never did see anything
[1:07:23] disorderly i never did see anything
[1:07:26] disorderly i never did see anything
[1:07:29] disorderly
[1:07:31] they were always right in order because
[1:07:34] they had recognized that their name had
[1:07:37] been written on the lamb's book of life
[1:07:39] before the foundation of the world when
[1:07:41] john saw that name written on the lamb's
[1:07:43] book of life the bible says everything
[1:07:45] above the earth everything under the
[1:07:47] earth everything on the face of the
[1:07:49] earth and everything in the sea heard me
[1:07:52] john the bride cry
[1:07:54] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:07:58] be to the lamb of god
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:01] it's in order to worship god
[1:08:05] it's in order
[1:08:09] hallelujah
[1:08:10] amen we're not here trying to
[1:08:12] manufacture anything but when the
[1:08:14] preaching of the word amen goes forth it
[1:08:17] causes a reaction on the hearts of the
[1:08:19] people why because the light which is
[1:08:21] the manifested word pierce the darkness
[1:08:24] and by revelation amen reveal to you
[1:08:27] that you're one of his
[1:08:28] reveal to you where you came from and
[1:08:30] what you're doing here and where you're
[1:08:31] going
[1:08:33] amen no wonder there be a shout in the
[1:08:34] camp
[1:08:36] hallelujah
[1:08:37] light pierced the darkness if the word
[1:08:39] would bring a shout it would be a word
[1:08:41] shout if the word brings a revival it's
[1:08:43] a word revival
[1:08:45] if the word would bring a baptism
[1:08:47] it'll be a word baptism
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:52] a friend of mine said you might think
[1:08:53] we're a crazy group
[1:08:55] then go join some other crazy group
[1:08:57] we're going to worship the lord
[1:08:59] young people we're here to defend your
[1:09:01] right to worship the lord with liberty
[1:09:05] with freedom from the earnest expression
[1:09:07] of the human heart
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:13] brother branstad we're not afraid of
[1:09:14] wildfire
[1:09:15] said don't you think we'd recognize it
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:21] i'd rather have a little wildfire than
[1:09:23] no fire at all but i don't believe it is
[1:09:25] wildfire but i believe it's what brother
[1:09:26] brown said the pillar of fire
[1:09:29] amen as it was on the day of pentecost
[1:09:31] when it divided itself into licks and
[1:09:33] tongues amen and baptize the souls of
[1:09:35] men
[1:09:36] that's what this is this is that
[1:09:40] this is that how many believe the pillar
[1:09:42] of fire
[1:09:43] is here tonight if he's here
[1:09:46] you can touch him
[1:09:48] he could touch you
[1:09:50] he's here friends
[1:09:52] so i think it'd be in order to sing the
[1:09:54] song that the angel of the lord enjoys
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:58] and whatever you whatever need is laying
[1:10:00] in your life
[1:10:03] now would be a time in the presence of
[1:10:04] god knowing that the angel of the lord
[1:10:06] is here knowing what a great opportunity
[1:10:09] that we're facing
[1:10:11] to have a genuine experience with god
[1:10:13] then i'd lay aside every doubt lay aside
[1:10:16] every weight
[1:10:18] put the past behind you put these
[1:10:20] distractions of this life
[1:10:22] out of your mind and only
[1:10:25] only believe

[1:25:13] he will cause to come down for you the
[1:25:16] rain and the former rain and the latter

[1:25:51] and you shall know that i am in the
[1:25:53] midst of israel and that i am the lord
[1:25:56] your god
[1:25:57] and none else and my people shall never
[1:25:59] be ashamed
[1:26:01] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[1:26:03] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:26:05] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:26:07] prophesy and your old men shall dream
[1:26:09] dreams and your young men shall see
[1:26:12] visions
[1:26:13] revelations chapter
[1:26:14] 10 and verse 1
[1:26:17] and as you're turning there
[1:26:19] brother branham said each one of you
[1:26:21] here is standing
[1:26:22] as believers then the life that was in
[1:26:25] christ is in you it can if you could
[1:26:28] just see it he said it's the devil's
[1:26:30] business to keep you blocked off
[1:26:33] from that
[1:26:35] it's the devil's business to keep you
[1:26:36] blocked off from being a real believer
[1:26:39] but it's god's business to open it up to
[1:26:41] you
[1:26:42] revelations chapter 10 and verse 1 and i
[1:26:44] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:26:46] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:26:48] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:26:51] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:26:54] pillars of fire verse 7
[1:26:56] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:26:58] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:27:00] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:27:01] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:27:03] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:27:06] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:27:08] again and said go
[1:27:09] and take the little book which is open
[1:27:13] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:27:15] upon the sea and upon the earth and i
[1:27:18] went unto the angel and said unto him
[1:27:21] give me the little book and he said unto
[1:27:23] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[1:27:26] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:27:28] thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the
[1:27:30] little book out of the angel's hand and
[1:27:32] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:27:34] as honey and as soon as i had eaten it
[1:27:36] my belly was bitter
[1:27:38] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:27:41] again
[1:27:42] before many peoples and nations and
[1:27:44] tongues and kings may god bless his word
[1:27:48] he may be seated in the presence of the
[1:27:49] lord
[1:27:51] as we said we'd like to speak to you on
[1:27:53] when heaven turns loose so why don't you
[1:27:55] turn to your neighbor give him a high
[1:27:57] five elbow him and tell them let's have
[1:27:59] church
[1:28:02] it's all right y'all can do that in the
[1:28:03] back there too when heaven turns loose
[1:28:05] so let's let heaven turn loose in this
[1:28:07] place tonight
[1:28:11] hallelujah
[1:28:13] let's have church i think it's an
[1:28:15] amazing thing that we can stand here
[1:28:17] this evening and we can preach to this
[1:28:19] most powerful young people that's ever
[1:28:21] been upon the face of the earth and we
[1:28:23] can we can preach to them from an open
[1:28:25] book to not not not so not saying
[1:28:27] something or not preaching to them
[1:28:29] something that we're not aware of but
[1:28:30] we've had we've had a prophet that would
[1:28:33] stand here in this in this evil day and
[1:28:35] stood here and preached to us the
[1:28:37] revelation of the seven seals and i
[1:28:38] think it's amazing thing that we can
[1:28:40] stand here and we can preach to these
[1:28:42] young people and recognize real
[1:28:45] realizing and recognizing what has been
[1:28:47] released in this hour is that none other
[1:28:49] than the holy ghost and that's what you
[1:28:51] have been experiencing throughout your
[1:28:53] walk and throughout this week and you
[1:28:55] have been experiencing that of the holy
[1:28:58] ghost and that what you feel in this
[1:29:00] atmosphere this evening has has been
[1:29:02] said and electrified is that of the holy
[1:29:04] ghost and maybe maybe you're new to this
[1:29:07] and maybe you've never been accustomed
[1:29:08] to this don't you be nervous about
[1:29:10] what's going on here tonight it's just
[1:29:12] heaven that is coming down upon its
[1:29:14] children just like earlier in the day
[1:29:16] there was a there was a bad storm that
[1:29:18] came through here and many of you got
[1:29:19] caught out and caught out in the rain
[1:29:21] and it was the rain that would begin to
[1:29:23] fall and there's a lot of people that
[1:29:25] don't like to look at the rain but i
[1:29:26] enjoy the rain i enjoy hearing the rain
[1:29:28] hit on the metal roof and i enjoy
[1:29:30] watching it fall because we recognize
[1:29:33] that it's the rain that brings life it
[1:29:35] brings new life both naturally and both
[1:29:37] spiritually you can't live without it
[1:29:39] and you've got to have it and we
[1:29:40] recognize that there's power in the rain
[1:29:43] and we could look throughout the bible
[1:29:44] and we'd see a type of noah that that
[1:29:47] there is such power of rain when it had
[1:29:49] not rained had it not rained before but
[1:29:52] god had given noah in his ministry to go
[1:29:54] out there and build an ark and he told
[1:29:56] him that it was going to rain and and
[1:29:58] you watch the power of that rain as it
[1:30:00] would begin to fall for 40 days and 40
[1:30:03] nights that it covered the whole entire
[1:30:04] earth but you find that when the bible
[1:30:06] said that in genesis 8 that the bible
[1:30:09] said that the windows of heaven were
[1:30:10] stopped and the rain from heaven was
[1:30:13] restrained and you see thy rain stopped
[1:30:15] in that day but i want you to recognize
[1:30:17] that the rain that is falling in this
[1:30:19] building tonight and upon this
[1:30:21] generation and upon this bride it's a
[1:30:23] rain that will not be stopped that what
[1:30:25] you are witnessing is not that now of a
[1:30:28] teaching rain but you are under a
[1:30:30] harvest rain it is what what william
[1:30:32] branham said would bring us rapturing
[1:30:34] faith he said it's a harvest reign or
[1:30:36] it's a rapturing faith and we recognize
[1:30:39] that that the rain falls on the just and
[1:30:40] the unjust and you remember when william
[1:30:43] branham was up there in mishawaka and he
[1:30:45] saw how the spirit of the lord fell on
[1:30:47] this brother and that brother and you
[1:30:48] know the story how that he sat there one
[1:30:50] was a real christian and one was a was a
[1:30:53] man that was running around on his wife
[1:30:54] and those things what was it brother
[1:30:56] branham went up there in his cave and he
[1:30:58] found out that it was a rain that was
[1:31:00] falling on the just and the unjust but
[1:31:02] you recognize that the rain was meant
[1:31:05] for the wheat but yet those that were
[1:31:07] those tares that were there it wasn't
[1:31:09] meant for them but yet they were
[1:31:11] rejoicing under that and we recognize
[1:31:13] that they are that we're living in an
[1:31:14] age where we've seen such carnal
[1:31:16] impersonations like never before and you
[1:31:19] get you get caught up young people and
[1:31:21] you see some people that that get
[1:31:22] excited at youth camp they get excited
[1:31:24] under the anointing and man they can run
[1:31:26] all over the building and they can shout
[1:31:28] all over the building and then they can
[1:31:30] go back out and live the way the world
[1:31:32] does you recognize they are under that
[1:31:35] reign just because you see a counterfeit
[1:31:37] does not mean that it's not right or
[1:31:39] that it's not real you recognize that
[1:31:42] the rain is falling and the rain is for
[1:31:44] you and i'm gonna say this to you
[1:31:46] tonight it is this holy ghost rain
[1:31:48] that'll fall upon you and it'll change
[1:31:51] your mortal bodies it'll change your
[1:31:53] thought path it'll change your channel
[1:31:55] it'll change your ideas it'll change you
[1:31:58] it's the same rain that was falling on
[1:32:00] abraham and it changed his body
[1:32:04] i tell you what you're witnessing is
[1:32:05] that of the holy ghost
[1:32:07] this is the third pull and we recognize
[1:32:10] that i know i know that you're gonna sit
[1:32:12] here and you're gonna see things that go
[1:32:14] on here that maybe disturb you this
[1:32:16] weekend but i want you to know that
[1:32:18] under this third pool there can be no
[1:32:19] mimics there can be no carnal
[1:32:21] impersonations and you might see people
[1:32:23] that would rise up and work under the
[1:32:25] first or the second pool but there can
[1:32:27] be no mimics the devil doesn't know what
[1:32:28] to do if this third pulled people that's
[1:32:31] why i have the liberty to be able to
[1:32:33] preach to you that heaven has come now
[1:32:35] that the mighty angel is right here
[1:32:38] right now and we recognize that he's
[1:32:40] willing and wanting to get into your
[1:32:42] heart change your life and
[1:32:44] supernaturally charge you with the
[1:32:46] baptism of the holy ghost and i'll tell
[1:32:48] you this if you completely surrender to
[1:32:50] him god will take over your life it
[1:32:53] won't be some put on it won't be some
[1:32:55] makeup it won't be some workup it'll be
[1:32:57] the same power
[1:33:00] it'll be the same power that fell upon
[1:33:02] the day of pentecost this second rain is
[1:33:05] a holy ghost rain and it is a rain that
[1:33:07] produces the crop and i'll say this i
[1:33:10] believe with everything that's within me
[1:33:12] this is the final generation we are
[1:33:15] sitting here tonight and i believe that
[1:33:17] every one of us are sitting here we are
[1:33:19] the final runners
[1:33:22] a final voice and we've got everything
[1:33:25] we have need of to finish the race so
[1:33:27] let us run
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:30] if heaven's come down let's go to him
[1:33:33] and let's run with everything that's
[1:33:35] within us
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:39] i'll tell you what there's an angel that
[1:33:41] is amongst us
[1:33:42] to do the supernatural
[1:33:44] maybe you don't witness him right here
[1:33:46] tonight but i'm telling you that that
[1:33:48] pillar fire that you watched in houston
[1:33:51] is right here tonight maybe you don't
[1:33:53] see him tonight but i'm telling you that
[1:33:55] he's here because we have the word of
[1:33:56] the lord that tells us that he's the
[1:33:58] same yesterday today and forever and you
[1:34:01] might be sitting here and say well i'm
[1:34:03] not getting anything but i'll tell you
[1:34:05] this that god's got angels in place to
[1:34:07] feed his children he's got if he had
[1:34:09] porters up there when elijah had went up
[1:34:12] there and he shut up the heavens and
[1:34:14] those crows came up there and fed him
[1:34:16] when he was up here at the brook of
[1:34:17] teresa and he went up there and they fed
[1:34:20] him the porters were feeding him up
[1:34:22] there when the rest of the world was in
[1:34:23] famine but yet elijah was feasting on
[1:34:26] those sandwiches and brother branham had
[1:34:28] a man challenge him one time he said you
[1:34:30] really don't mean to think that that man
[1:34:32] that elijah was fed by sandwiches he
[1:34:34] said absolutely i believe he was fed by
[1:34:37] those porters they was giving him
[1:34:39] sandwiches he said where did it come
[1:34:41] from he said well i don't know where it
[1:34:42] came from he said but i believe he did
[1:34:44] it he said well
[1:34:46] i don't understand why these people
[1:34:47] shout and i don't understand why they
[1:34:49] get so excited he said it's the manna
[1:34:52] that is falling down upon them and i'm
[1:34:55] telling you that heaven has come down
[1:34:59] now you know you know
[1:35:01] you know that which was given
[1:35:02] interpretation of danny henry and those
[1:35:04] things that was there and that thing
[1:35:06] that the thing that was spoken when when
[1:35:08] he said that this could be revelations
[1:35:10] 23 you remember when he went in there
[1:35:13] and you remember what he said because of
[1:35:15] your momentous decision a huge portion
[1:35:18] awaits a huge portion of heaven awaits
[1:35:20] you now that's not that brother branham
[1:35:22] gets a bigger slot in heaven but i
[1:35:24] believe with everything that's within me
[1:35:26] that heaven had come down and i believe
[1:35:29] what you are witnessing amongst your
[1:35:31] young boys and amongst your young girls
[1:35:34] is heaven coming down i don't have to
[1:35:36] preach to them some low down nonsense
[1:35:39] that they can barely live we can preach
[1:35:42] this full message to this young people
[1:35:44] because heaven has come down heaven's
[1:35:46] opened it up heaven's released itself
[1:35:49] and there's a huge portion of heaven
[1:35:51] that's here
[1:35:58] brother branham said in the key to the
[1:36:00] door he said
[1:36:01] he said i believe in the full gospel
[1:36:03] every word of god
[1:36:04] that turns the power of god loose that
[1:36:07] turns his blessings to the people
[1:36:09] he said it's the key
[1:36:10] to the door that unlocks it and to think
[1:36:13] that tonight
[1:36:15] that the full gospel is what is the key
[1:36:18] to unlock the door
[1:36:20] and to think if you can stand here and
[1:36:22] you can believe this word if you can
[1:36:24] accept this word and it's preached in
[1:36:26] its entirety that it'll lose heaven to
[1:36:28] your situation
[1:36:29] so what i'm trying to tell you is that
[1:36:31] you're not just another association
[1:36:33] you're not just another group you are
[1:36:35] the elect of almighty god god chose you
[1:36:38] before the foundation of the world and
[1:36:40] if god chose you he can't unchoose you
[1:36:42] you see you were the one that had god
[1:36:45] seen before the foundation of the world
[1:36:49] and i'll say this there's not another
[1:36:51] church there's not another creed there's
[1:36:53] not another dogma that can unmatch the
[1:36:56] identity of the bride of jesus christ
[1:36:58] the restoration of gifts of pentecost
[1:37:01] and on azusa street man it looked close
[1:37:03] but yet it wasn't the full wheat
[1:37:07] but there is another people under their
[1:37:10] messenger who is a final voice
[1:37:12] and we're standing here tonight there's
[1:37:14] not one anybody that can match the
[1:37:16] similarity of the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:20] you are the gene seed of almighty god
[1:37:23] i'll tell you this we're not just some
[1:37:26] donkey or some mule where we're some
[1:37:28] hybrid where we don't know where we came
[1:37:29] from we are we have a pedigree we're
[1:37:32] like a pedigree thoroughbred we know
[1:37:34] where we came from we know who our daddy
[1:37:36] is and we know exactly where we're going
[1:37:38] and when brother branham is preaching on
[1:37:40] the adoption series he said there's
[1:37:42] coming a time when sons of god when
[1:37:44] there will come a time of manifestation
[1:37:47] of sons of god will walk out there and
[1:37:49] take the very power away from satan i'm
[1:37:52] telling you that you are that generation
[1:37:55] that is under the obligation of heaven
[1:37:58] to take satan's power away don't you let
[1:38:01] depression rule you you rule it
[1:38:05] this is the believer's domain and it
[1:38:07] reaches from eternity to eternity
[1:38:12] it's time you start rising up as a son
[1:38:15] and daughter of god and taking anxiety
[1:38:17] away from satan taking depression away
[1:38:19] from him taking your troubles away from
[1:38:22] him rise up young boys rise up young
[1:38:25] girls you are under commission
[1:38:30] and god never departs from his
[1:38:32] commission it's time to rise
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:47] i had a young man
[1:38:48] i had a man that was working on my house
[1:38:50] not too long ago
[1:38:52] a carpenter he was working on my house
[1:38:54] and
[1:38:54] he got telling me a real nice guy i
[1:38:56] believe he's coming to the message real
[1:38:58] soon but anyways he got he got to
[1:39:00] working on my house and he began to tell
[1:39:02] me he does a lot of work for
[1:39:04] for a lot of people with
[1:39:05] some bigwigs
[1:39:07] and he got to doing some work for a
[1:39:09] ambassador
[1:39:10] of a country that lived here in america
[1:39:13] lived up there close to washington dc
[1:39:14] just on the outskirts of it and he began
[1:39:16] to tell me he said no he said i go up
[1:39:18] here and i was building this i was
[1:39:20] building this thing for him this project
[1:39:21] for him he said but i found out
[1:39:24] when i went up there he said because
[1:39:25] he's an ambassador he said when i went
[1:39:28] up there even though he lives here in
[1:39:29] america he said i was on his national
[1:39:32] turf because he was under that
[1:39:34] ambassador and he said when i was up
[1:39:36] there i was on his
[1:39:38] soil so let me tell you this
[1:39:41] this is not satan's domain this is
[1:39:44] christ's domain this is your domain and
[1:39:47] you can look at hell right in the face
[1:39:49] and say this is my turf get your filthy
[1:39:52] hands off of god's property you have no
[1:39:55] right
[1:39:56] you have no authority this is my turf i
[1:40:00] am not going down the lay ought to see
[1:40:01] it or lose heaven come down for me
[1:40:12] brother man
[1:40:13] brother random in 1956
[1:40:16] he stood there and he preached a very
[1:40:17] powerful message
[1:40:19] on the junction of time
[1:40:20] you ain't listen to it i admonish you
[1:40:22] after this meeting to go and listen to
[1:40:24] it
[1:40:24] one of my favorite services
[1:40:27] it'll do your heart much good
[1:40:29] but there brother branham tells us in a
[1:40:30] junction he said angels appear
[1:40:33] prophets arise and signs and wonders
[1:40:35] appear
[1:40:36] at the end time and at every junction
[1:40:39] and we recognize that counterfeits arise
[1:40:43] at the junction
[1:40:44] and we recognize what a junction is it's
[1:40:46] a blending it's a blending of a roads
[1:40:48] it's a change over in the roads and
[1:40:50] right here we are as a church of the
[1:40:52] living god and we're standing here in
[1:40:54] the blending of time and the blending of
[1:40:56] eternity and we recognize that the
[1:40:58] angels are here signs and wonders are
[1:41:01] here and the omnipotence of almighty god
[1:41:04] is here to prove that he's the same
[1:41:06] yesterday today and forever don't get
[1:41:09] your eyes on the counterfeits
[1:41:13] don't get your eyes on the ones that are
[1:41:15] walking away don't get your eyes on this
[1:41:17] that or the other you keep your eyes
[1:41:19] focused on the angel young people let me
[1:41:22] tell you when you're all alone he's
[1:41:23] still there
[1:41:24] when you sin all you've got to do is
[1:41:26] repent and he'll come back to you the
[1:41:28] dove may fly away when you backslid but
[1:41:31] i want you to know that there is a water
[1:41:33] that is coming from the rock and he's
[1:41:35] still in speaking distance from you he's
[1:41:37] not that far if you'll just go to
[1:41:39] talking to him he'll open up the windows
[1:41:41] of heaven and pour out a blessing on
[1:41:43] your life when you think he's not there
[1:41:45] he's always there when you think he
[1:41:47] isn't looking he's always looking when
[1:41:49] he don't think he's making a way he's
[1:41:51] always making a way when he don't think
[1:41:53] he's working he's always working when he
[1:41:55] don't think he's healing he's always
[1:41:57] healing when he don't see him moving in
[1:41:59] your life he's still moving in your life
[1:42:01] when you don't feel like winning
[1:42:04] that means you are winning because there
[1:42:06] is somebody that's bigger than me that's
[1:42:09] standing at this pulpit and it's
[1:42:11] charging you to recognize that all
[1:42:13] heaven has come down for the church
[1:42:16] of the living god
[1:42:22] he said it always takes the miraculous
[1:42:25] to speak of the omnipotence he said
[1:42:26] omnipotences they're all powerful and it
[1:42:29] takes the miraculous to vindicate the
[1:42:31] omnipotence and only the miraculous can
[1:42:33] do that he said teaching the word is a
[1:42:35] very fine thing he said but faith comes
[1:42:38] by hearing and hearing the word he said
[1:42:40] but it always takes the miraculous to
[1:42:43] vindicate that the omnipotence still
[1:42:45] lives
[1:42:46] and reigns he said we must have the
[1:42:49] miraculous and i believe that the church
[1:42:52] is now standing on a threshold of the
[1:42:54] greatest vindication of omnipotence that
[1:42:56] the world has ever known and there ever
[1:42:59] has been
[1:43:00] and to think that you're right here
[1:43:02] you're right here at the threshold what
[1:43:04] it is is you are that
[1:43:10] how many is a believer tonight how many
[1:43:12] is filled with his spirit
[1:43:14] you are standing here as proof of the
[1:43:17] omnipotence
[1:43:18] you remember when moses was back there
[1:43:21] when he was back there under egypt
[1:43:23] before god ever did one thing he proved
[1:43:26] to them the supernatural and it was a
[1:43:28] supernatural that liberated egypt from
[1:43:30] their bondage you see what god was doing
[1:43:33] is he was working out his word
[1:43:36] i'm going to tell you i'm gonna tell you
[1:43:38] what brother random said in the junction
[1:43:40] he said how can the great turmoil in
[1:43:42] this world that we realize that's caused
[1:43:45] that the bible said that spirits great
[1:43:46] spirits has came down evil spirits and
[1:43:49] god unto the people and they've done
[1:43:51] these things and we just see the same
[1:43:53] evil spirits working in our day
[1:43:56] i'm going to tell you
[1:43:58] we've never seen such a release
[1:44:00] of the power of hell like we're
[1:44:02] witnessing right now
[1:44:05] but notice what brother ranum says right
[1:44:07] here
[1:44:07] he said but notice again that not only
[1:44:10] that he said when all hell turns loose
[1:44:13] all heaven turns loose also
[1:44:15] you see what god is doing what he said
[1:44:17] in isaiah 59 that when the enemy comes
[1:44:20] in like a flood that god would raise up
[1:44:22] a standard so what is it it's god
[1:44:24] responding
[1:44:26] so there's evil that's being poured out
[1:44:28] but there's good that's being poured out
[1:44:30] there's supernatural devils that are
[1:44:32] being released that were held back there
[1:44:34] under revelations 9 when william branham
[1:44:37] goes in there in the feast of the
[1:44:39] trumpet and he goes in there and he lays
[1:44:41] out the borders for the supernatural
[1:44:43] believers in this day he goes in there
[1:44:45] like joshua and he lays out the borders
[1:44:47] and said this is yours go in there and
[1:44:49] possess the gate of your enemy footsteps
[1:44:52] means possession and william branham
[1:44:54] lays out the borders
[1:44:57] he lays out the borders but he goes over
[1:44:59] in there in matthew 24 and 24 and he
[1:45:02] tells us that false christ and false
[1:45:04] prophets would arise in the last day
[1:45:06] that if it were possible that it would
[1:45:08] deceive the very elect if it was
[1:45:09] possible
[1:45:10] but it ain't possible
[1:45:12] god chose you god elected you god
[1:45:15] qualified you and all hell can't stop
[1:45:18] you
[1:45:22] i'm telling you that god will have a
[1:45:24] testimony god's wanting young
[1:45:28] boys that'll rise up
[1:45:31] and tow the line with satan and say i
[1:45:34] will not back off of my god i will not
[1:45:36] back off of these blood-bound promises i
[1:45:38] will not back off of this message
[1:45:42] god had some young men by the name of
[1:45:44] joshua and caleb that was willing when
[1:45:47] everybody else said they wouldn't go
[1:45:49] when everybody else said it was too big
[1:45:51] for them when everybody else said there
[1:45:52] was too many giants out there for them
[1:45:54] there was two young boys that walked
[1:45:56] outside and said we're more than able to
[1:45:58] go in there and conquer that land
[1:46:01] what did brother branham said he said
[1:46:03] caleb and joshua came walking back the
[1:46:05] evidence
[1:46:08] now you might get mad at me mamas and
[1:46:10] daddies and maybe pastors that are
[1:46:11] sitting here that don't have the holy
[1:46:13] ghost but let me preach to you this
[1:46:15] there's going to be some young boys and
[1:46:17] some young girls that walk out of this
[1:46:20] this camp walking back the evidence of
[1:46:23] the holy ghost and will prove that this
[1:46:25] message is alive and it's working right
[1:46:27] here
[1:46:30] it's time that you start walking back to
[1:46:32] the evidence when god when satan says
[1:46:35] there is no more holy ghost walk back
[1:46:37] the evidence
[1:46:39] was elected to do it and so is this
[1:46:41] church of the living god
[1:46:44] brother branham said in the invisible
[1:46:46] union of the bride he said the
[1:46:47] pentecostal church is in no commit in no
[1:46:50] condition to finish out the great
[1:46:52] commission he said but it'll be an
[1:46:53] elected people that's elected for it so
[1:46:56] you are an elected church of the living
[1:46:58] god to carry out the great commission
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:03] i'm not looking at a bunch of weak
[1:47:05] christians i'm looking at strong
[1:47:07] christians that same mighty angel
[1:47:11] is anointing you to tear satan's kingdom
[1:47:14] down
[1:47:21] brother mariam said that's a deathstroke
[1:47:23] to satan when a man takes god at his
[1:47:25] word he said that's the hardest hitting
[1:47:27] that satan can get is when a man will
[1:47:29] take god at his word
[1:47:32] and i'm gonna tell you what
[1:47:33] i didn't told you i know how to fight
[1:47:35] but there were some times that i got
[1:47:37] into some fights that was a little bit
[1:47:39] too big for me
[1:47:40] but i had a big brother
[1:47:43] i was never dumb enough to fight him
[1:47:47] i got all the veggies and ice cream and
[1:47:48] he got all the steak and taters
[1:47:53] i ain't going to tell you everything
[1:47:54] tonight
[1:47:57] but i'm going to tell you this
[1:47:59] i've never watched a boxing ring like
[1:48:02] we're watching right now
[1:48:05] cause we got some young girls that are
[1:48:07] taking god at his word and they're
[1:48:09] hitting satan with it
[1:48:12] we got some young boys that are throwing
[1:48:14] down depression and throwing down
[1:48:15] anxiety and throwing down suicide and
[1:48:18] throwing down homosexuality and saying
[1:48:20] i'm not going to be a part of that i'm
[1:48:22] going to come out of it and i'm going to
[1:48:24] lay my life down and i'm going to come
[1:48:26] to the cross and i'm going to come over
[1:48:27] here and i'm going to take back what was
[1:48:29] rightfully mine and i'll tell you this
[1:48:32] there's no weapon that is formed against
[1:48:33] the bride of jesus christ that can
[1:48:35] prosper there's going to be a young boy
[1:48:37] that says i'm i'm sick and tired of
[1:48:39] being being held back by change and held
[1:48:42] back by dogmas held back by creeds
[1:48:44] brother branham said that the church had
[1:48:46] been bound that the spirit of god had
[1:48:48] been bound at the doors of dogmas and
[1:48:51] creeds he said but there's coming a
[1:48:53] liberation of it and i'll say this you
[1:48:55] are under the greatest liberty that
[1:48:57] there's ever been brother branham said
[1:49:01] in the third seal he said the bride's
[1:49:03] not received her revival yet
[1:49:05] he said it'll take those seven unknown
[1:49:07] thunders and wake her up you are
[1:49:08] witnessing the greatest bride's revival
[1:49:11] that there's ever been that's why hell
[1:49:14] is trying to keep you
[1:49:15] he's trying to keep you from this open
[1:49:18] word it's because it will defeat him
[1:49:23] you better back off me devil i know what
[1:49:25] i'm talking about and i know where i'm
[1:49:26] standing at

[1:50:07] girls got

[1:50:48] satan's kingdom down

[1:51:17] prosper i'm elected to overcome a
[1:51:20] prophet announced that i would be here
[1:51:22] so i am here
[1:51:25] i am here fulfilling what william
[1:51:28] branham said that there would be a bride
[1:51:30] in this last day that would be born of
[1:51:32] his bold life of his life power of his
[1:51:34] power anointing of his anointing it's
[1:51:36] the same body that's being led by the
[1:51:38] headship because heaven has come down
[1:51:44] this body ain't moving without the
[1:51:45] spirit it's her handshape
[1:51:59] oh
[1:52:03] oh give up
[1:52:05] don't you give up
[1:52:07] that angel's here with this message and

[1:52:26] i'm not worried i'm not worried tonight
[1:52:28] who's going to get it who ain't going to
[1:52:29] get it because god is not the kind of
[1:52:31] male man that drops off the male at the
[1:52:33] wrong house
[1:52:35] what god has for you is for you and if
[1:52:38] you need healing he'll drop off healing
[1:52:40] at your house if you need deliverance
[1:52:42] he'll drop it off at your house god is
[1:52:44] the kind of mailman that he sends a
[1:52:46] messenger by the way and makes sure that
[1:52:48] the message gets to its spot
[1:52:52] i say that that same angel is whirling
[1:52:55] through this building
[1:53:05] you watch those
[1:53:06] 120 up there
[1:53:08] on the day of pentecost
[1:53:10] they got up there with one mind
[1:53:12] they got up there with one goal
[1:53:14] they were united on the same fact and
[1:53:17] upon the same basis that god was going
[1:53:19] to release upon them what was spoken
[1:53:22] over in the book of john then he
[1:53:23] breathed on them the holy ghost and they
[1:53:25] went up there and they received that
[1:53:27] promise on the day of pentecost when
[1:53:29] peter come out there and he preached to
[1:53:31] them the inauguration message he
[1:53:34] preached to them that you shall repent
[1:53:37] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:53:39] jesus christ for the remissions of your
[1:53:41] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:53:44] the holy ghost and if you have not been
[1:53:46] baptized in his name then you have never
[1:53:48] been baptized
[1:53:50] it's the most precious name and it's the
[1:53:52] most holy name but witness what they
[1:53:54] were doing up there they were under one
[1:53:56] union
[1:53:58] and i wonder what would happen in this
[1:53:59] place tonight if we'd get in here in the
[1:54:01] same mind in the same accord into the
[1:54:03] same union
[1:54:05] now i know it hurts your feelings back
[1:54:07] there but it's time that you come up
[1:54:08] here and unionize with me just for a
[1:54:09] minute not what i'm i ain't trying to
[1:54:11] get you to unionize to me but i'm trying
[1:54:13] to get you to unionize with the bride
[1:54:15] with the word of jesus christ brother
[1:54:17] branham said in a union he said a union
[1:54:20] creates a worship he said a union he
[1:54:22] said you have to beg people to worship
[1:54:24] you don't have to beg people to give you
[1:54:26] don't have to beg people to say amen
[1:54:28] because they're in a union and when you
[1:54:30] come in a union it breaks every power
[1:54:32] that satan's got it holds back the very
[1:54:35] power of hell when you come here
[1:54:39] i wonder if everybody here under the
[1:54:41] sound of my voice just for a moment in
[1:54:44] time forget about who you are forget
[1:54:46] about what your last name is forget
[1:54:48] about what church you came from and we
[1:54:50] gather under the same goal to see empty
[1:54:53] vessels filled and watch them shake the
[1:54:56] world with it
[1:54:57] i say let god feel them let god do the
[1:55:00] work
[1:55:01] [Applause]
[1:55:10] when william branham goes
[1:55:12] in the unveiling of god and i'm just
[1:55:13] going to lay some things down before we
[1:55:15] go further
[1:55:16] when william branham comes there and he
[1:55:18] preaches on the unveiling of god
[1:55:20] he goes in there and he grabs prophecy
[1:55:22] he goes in there and grabs joel chapter
[1:55:24] 2 and he goes into hebrews and he goes
[1:55:26] in there and he breaks into the greek
[1:55:28] here's a hillbilly kentuckian breaking
[1:55:30] into the greek and he goes in there and
[1:55:32] he starts breaking into god in morphine
[1:55:34] that god was just he said he's same in
[1:55:37] his nature he's same in his nature and
[1:55:39] he's he cannot change he said but he
[1:55:41] can't change his form he said he can't
[1:55:43] change his he can't change his nature
[1:55:45] he's because he's the same yesterday
[1:55:47] today and forever he said he simply that
[1:55:50] same god that was back there in the
[1:55:51] beginning that was rolling worlds off of
[1:55:53] his fingertips was the same one that met
[1:55:55] moses up there on that mountain up there
[1:55:58] it was him in that pillar fire it was
[1:56:00] god just simply changing his mask
[1:56:03] and what brother branham does when he
[1:56:05] goes in the unveiling of god he goes in
[1:56:08] there and he breaks into joel chapter 2
[1:56:10] he said and it shall come to pass that
[1:56:12] afterwards that i will pour out my
[1:56:15] spirit
[1:56:16] now notice what he's doing he said now
[1:56:18] we look at that in the english word he
[1:56:20] said we looked at it and he said it
[1:56:22] means vomit up he said but you've got to
[1:56:24] look at it in the original greek he said
[1:56:26] it's not like it is in the english here
[1:56:28] he said to give something that's not of
[1:56:30] itself he said but he himself poured
[1:56:33] himself into the church so it's christ
[1:56:36] in you the hope of glory
[1:56:40] so what you're witnessing is that which
[1:56:42] was spoken by joel chapter 2 that this
[1:56:45] is that that was spoken
[1:56:48] that it's the same lord jesus it's the
[1:56:50] same pillar of fire it's the same
[1:56:52] anointing it's the same mighty angel
[1:56:55] it's jesus christ
[1:56:57] he's not going to leave you he's pouring
[1:57:00] himself out he's emptying himself out
[1:57:03] into the final runners
[1:57:05] and our lives are here
[1:57:08] to meet the challenge of the day
[1:57:14] i'm quoting to you your prophet he goes
[1:57:16] in there and he says you watch a man
[1:57:18] with his gifts and you watch him how
[1:57:19] he's built he's built in such a way to
[1:57:22] meet the challenge of that day he said
[1:57:24] and so now you are made creatures a son
[1:57:27] and daughter of god manifested son and
[1:57:29] daughter of god to meet the challenge of
[1:57:31] this hour to vindicate that the true and
[1:57:34] living god of this hour that the message
[1:57:36] coming forth in its time and to think
[1:57:38] that we're right here under the greatest
[1:57:41] message that's ever been released
[1:57:43] that's why i can preach to you that
[1:57:45] heaven has come down and heaven has
[1:57:47] released itself this is christ that has
[1:57:50] descended upon the church
[1:57:52] of the living god we are matching the
[1:57:55] promise of the archangel
[1:58:02] when paul goes on first thessalonians
[1:58:03] chapter 4 and verse 16 he said the lord
[1:58:06] himself shall descend from heaven
[1:58:08] with a shout and with the voice of the
[1:58:09] archangel and with the trump of god and
[1:58:11] the dead and christ shall rise first and
[1:58:13] when brother branham preaches the
[1:58:14] rapture he goes in there and he said he
[1:58:16] does all three things as he's descending

[1:58:21] wakes the sleeping by but it's the
[1:58:23] trumpet that is the catching away it's
[1:58:25] the ascension that is calling a body

[1:58:32] is christ that has descended upon the
[1:58:34] church of the living god but it's the

[2:00:05] dancing partner i wonder if there's
[2:00:07] anybody that would like to dance with
[2:00:09] king jesus
[2:00:23] now you know
[2:00:24] you know you're getting in rhythm with
[2:00:25] music
[2:00:26] because you're watching the conductor
[2:00:28] and you're watching the director and
[2:00:30] everything's in step and everything's in
[2:00:33] order and you're watching this one take
[2:00:35] their place and you're watching that one
[2:00:37] take the place don't get mad everybody's
[2:00:40] got their part
[2:00:44] and he said if the conductor says that
[2:00:47] the days of miracles are not passed then
[2:00:50] the choir has got to say
[2:00:55] now i know you
[2:00:57] i know you don't listen to that message
[2:00:58] shalom and you've heard it enough
[2:01:01] if he says that the days of miracles are
[2:01:02] not past then the choir says
[2:01:09] it's time that we start let's stop
[2:01:11] listening to the devil and we start
[2:01:12] listening to the one that preached this
[2:01:14] message
[2:01:15] he said i'll say the words you just
[2:01:17] repeat them
[2:01:19] why don't you start saying what william
[2:01:20] branham said on the tape and stop taking
[2:01:22] away from it you'll watch liberty come
[2:01:25] amongst these young people when you take
[2:01:27] away from it and when you add to it you
[2:01:29] are taken away from the authority of the
[2:01:31] word and when you can stand there and
[2:01:32] preach it in its entirety
[2:01:35] you're going to watch some young people
[2:01:36] that rise to the challenge and beat down
[2:01:39] the devil
[2:01:41] i'm sick and tired of the devil beating
[2:01:43] around our young girls and telling them
[2:01:45] that they've got to crown themselves
[2:01:47] with depression and with anxiety
[2:01:51] it's time that you take your position
[2:01:53] say heaven's come down to me and i've
[2:01:55] come to take over
[2:02:06] ain't no other age has been promised
[2:02:08] this
[2:02:09] like in this age of malachi 4 luke 17
[2:02:11] 30.
[2:02:13] john 14 and 12 joel 2 38 this message
[2:02:16] was to bring you into fellowship with
[2:02:18] none other than jesus christ not to
[2:02:20] educate you but to contact the living
[2:02:23] god that's why he's moving with one
[2:02:25] purpose is to get into his believing
[2:02:27] children that's why he's appearing to us
[2:02:37] he appeared
[2:02:38] to abraham
[2:02:40] he talked to him along
[2:02:42] all of his journey
[2:02:45] you had some rough roads
[2:02:48] you had to separate from friends
[2:02:50] because of this message
[2:02:56] you had to walk away from family because
[2:02:58] of this message but abraham
[2:03:01] there's something coming for you
[2:03:04] abraham get ready
[2:03:08] you got to separate from your mother
[2:03:10] you got to separate from your father
[2:03:11] you're going to walk in a strange land
[2:03:14] but where god's leading you he'll never
[2:03:15] lead you into a mistake
[2:03:17] he'll never lead you down trouble
[2:03:19] he'll never lead you down a road that
[2:03:21] his grace isn't strong enough to get you
[2:03:23] out of the mess that you got yourself in
[2:03:27] abraham he's got you
[2:03:30] abraham he knows where you're going to
[2:03:32] live at
[2:03:33] he's already got a spot picked out
[2:03:35] and you're walking and you're searching
[2:03:38] for a building
[2:03:44] who's builder and maker is god
[2:03:48] and he's watched over your life
[2:03:51] it's the same one that's been speaking
[2:03:53] you all the way from genesis chapter 12.
[2:03:56] he'll be the same one that takes you all
[2:03:57] the way to genesis 22.
[2:04:00] you're going to have to go through some
[2:04:01] stuff abraham
[2:04:03] but this elohim is going to be with you
[2:04:06] he ain't going to leave you
[2:04:08] because there's something in store for
[2:04:10] you abraham
[2:04:13] there's going to come a time when you go
[2:04:15] all the way through justification
[2:04:16] abraham and you go all the way through
[2:04:18] sanctification abraham and then you're
[2:04:20] going to go all the way in genesis 18
[2:04:22] and you're going to get the baptism of
[2:04:24] the holy ghost abraham abraham just keep
[2:04:27] walking with jesus
[2:04:31] just keep on walking
[2:04:32] god had god has a witness at all times
[2:04:35] when nimrod was up there and he was
[2:04:37] building his babylon god had a witness
[2:04:39] there was one enoch that was walking
[2:04:41] with god and he had this testimony that
[2:04:43] he pleased god he walked so much with
[2:04:46] that hell
[2:04:48] that he could not leave him here i
[2:04:50] happen to believe that there's a church
[2:04:53] there's a group that has walked so close
[2:04:56] with this elohim that you have lived a
[2:04:58] testimony that you've lived a life that
[2:05:00] you cannot leave you here
[2:05:04] abraham keep walking
[2:05:06] keep walking
[2:05:08] keep walking
[2:05:13] abram
[2:05:14] i'm no longer going to call you abram
[2:05:17] but i'm going to call you abraham
[2:05:19] because you cannot do this on your own
[2:05:22] you know you can't do it on your own
[2:05:24] you know you can't walk up there in
[2:05:25] genesis 22 with isaac and you know you
[2:05:27] can't come down without me
[2:05:33] you know you need me
[2:05:35] you know you can't live without me you
[2:05:37] know you'll never make it without me but
[2:05:39] i promise you that i'll never leave you
[2:05:41] and i'll never forsake you
[2:05:43] abraham i've got to change your name
[2:05:45] because i've got to put a part of myself
[2:05:47] in there and when he put the h in there
[2:05:49] he put the very breath of god on the
[2:05:51] inside of abraham he had so much god on
[2:05:54] the inside of him that he could produce
[2:05:56] an isaac
[2:05:58] [Applause]
[2:06:05] brother andrew i'm never gonna make
[2:06:08] i'm never gonna make it i'm never gonna
[2:06:10] get through i'm never gonna be good
[2:06:12] enough i'm not gonna do it let me tell
[2:06:14] you when god puts himself on the inside
[2:06:16] of you you gonna make it
[2:06:18] you're gonna produce
[2:06:22] that's why william branham stood here he
[2:06:24] said i'll no longer call you church but
[2:06:26] i'll call you bride so that you
[2:06:27] understand it
[2:06:29] you couldn't do it on your own but when
[2:06:31] god put himself when god poured himself
[2:06:35] on the inside of you it made you strong
[2:06:38] enough abraham
[2:06:39] [Applause]
[2:06:43] people have made fun of you all your
[2:06:45] life
[2:06:49] made fun of you because you've been
[2:06:50] listening to a voice
[2:06:53] that's led you down some roads that
[2:06:55] looked inconceivable to the rest of the
[2:06:57] world
[2:06:59] how is this going to produce
[2:07:01] how is this voice going to produce
[2:07:04] what abraham's name really means a
[2:07:06] father of nations how is it going to
[2:07:08] produce it
[2:07:10] everybody's mocked you
[2:07:12] because you've said here under the
[2:07:13] revealing of the word and they're out
[2:07:15] there having their fun and they're out
[2:07:16] there enjoying their time but you're
[2:07:18] fellowshipping with elohim
[2:07:26] brother brandon said you watch
[2:07:28] the effect of the revelation
[2:07:30] that it had on abraham
[2:07:33] now he's here
[2:07:35] he's right here right now
[2:07:38] you watch the effect of the revelation
[2:07:40] that it had on abraham
[2:07:42] that when he was sitting there with his
[2:07:43] back turned to the tent
[2:07:46] and god came down
[2:07:48] in human bodies and he said gabriel you
[2:07:51] take this one and michael you tap into
[2:07:53] this one and here i step in and god blew
[2:07:56] himself a body and he stepped into it
[2:07:59] and when abraham watched the effect of
[2:08:01] the revelation
[2:08:03] he said my lord
[2:08:07] you watch the effect of the revelation
[2:08:09] that it's had on these young people they
[2:08:10] don't see three gods
[2:08:12] they don't see jesus as a weaker god or
[2:08:14] the lesser god
[2:08:15] they see him who he is
[2:08:18] don't you be afraid of pastors to preach
[2:08:20] to them this message they recognize who
[2:08:22] this is they're sensitive if our little
[2:08:24] girls are sensitive to the moving of the
[2:08:26] spirit you can preach to them this
[2:08:28] message
[2:08:31] don't you be ashamed to preach to them
[2:08:33] don't you be ashamed to preach to them
[2:08:35] the gifts of the spirit god's wanting a
[2:08:37] body that's in full operation
[2:08:39] god's will in the body that he can move
[2:08:41] in god's will in the body that he can
[2:08:43] work in
[2:08:45] heaven is here
[2:08:47] let him in

[2:09:35] you can walk up there on mount moriah
[2:09:36] you can walk up there and watch with the
[2:09:39] spirit of the prophecy that was upon
[2:09:41] abraham when he walks up there with his
[2:09:43] two servants he said i and the lad will
[2:09:46] come down again it was a spirit of
[2:09:48] prophecy that was on abraham that he
[2:09:50] walked up there and isaac knew how to
[2:09:52] worship isaac knew how the sacrifice was
[2:09:54] to be he said here's

[2:18:56] william branham

[2:20:16] but i guarantee you tonight
[2:20:20] that the spirit of prophecy is here
[2:20:24] and i'm going to prophesy over this
[2:20:25] generation
[2:20:28] over these young people
[2:20:31] just like moses prophesied over top of
[2:20:33] those israelites you will not go out of
[2:20:35] here empty
[2:20:42] tonight it's going to be different
[2:20:45] tonight there's a change coming
[2:20:50] don't get scared on me
[2:20:52] the spirit of prophecy is the testimony
[2:20:54] of jesus christ
[2:20:58] my dad told a story for years you
[2:21:00] probably sat here and heard it
[2:21:04] but he was on a plane one time
[2:21:07] he was on a plane one time brother wayne
[2:21:08] and he was sitting there and he was
[2:21:09] coming down and you know how as you're
[2:21:11] coming down to the close
[2:21:13] of the flight that's where everybody
[2:21:14] wants to talk to you they don't want to
[2:21:15] talk to you the whole entire time
[2:21:17] until it's calm close
[2:21:20] till you're getting ready to get off and
[2:21:21] everybody want to talk to you then
[2:21:24] it's smart to do that sometimes you
[2:21:26] never know what kind of nut you're going
[2:21:27] to be setting aside
[2:21:30] there's power and silence there's
[2:21:32] somebody knows what i'm talking about
[2:21:39] but he was sitting in between two
[2:21:41] insurance agents
[2:21:45] and they asked him said no
[2:21:47] what do you do he said well i'm a
[2:21:49] preacher
[2:21:51] i'm a preacher
[2:21:52] he said what do you preach
[2:21:59] well they was pulling it out of me
[2:22:02] hey so i preached the teachings of
[2:22:04] william branham
[2:22:05] and when one insurance agent
[2:22:08] so i know about william branham
[2:22:10] i know about these stories you probably
[2:22:12] heard him tell this
[2:22:14] talked to him along
[2:22:15] along the way until they got off and
[2:22:17] brother ron never seen that man again he
[2:22:19] said i always wondered
[2:22:21] i always wondered what happened to that
[2:22:23] guy or where he was at he'd tell that
[2:22:25] story of meetings thinking well maybe
[2:22:26] one day i'll run into him again
[2:22:29] we did we do
[2:22:31] we do some things just out of the
[2:22:33] ordinary sometimes we don't always after
[2:22:34] we get done preaching we we don't feel
[2:22:36] like fellowship and there's there's
[2:22:39] you forgive us for that
[2:22:41] but we're pretty much tuckered out by
[2:22:43] the time we get done
[2:22:44] but we did something kind of out of the
[2:22:47] ordinary last weekend
[2:22:50] we have a family
[2:22:51] we have a family that we hadn't had to
[2:22:53] have a whole lot of fellowship with but
[2:22:54] we decided we want to take some time and
[2:22:57] right after brother ron preached and you
[2:22:59] all know that
[2:23:00] me and brother matthew are doing a very
[2:23:01] good job of
[2:23:03] keeping him protected
[2:23:05] and you i appreciate you bearing with me
[2:23:06] on that
[2:23:08] brother ron said he said let's let's
[2:23:10] let's have some dinner here we go down
[2:23:12] and
[2:23:13] there was a family member that came up
[2:23:14] to meet this family
[2:23:16] be with them for the weekend
[2:23:21] he was an insurance agent
[2:23:25] mother on sitting down there beside him
[2:23:26] all of a sudden the spirit of the lord
[2:23:27] says that's the man
[2:23:34] god knows where you're at
[2:23:36] ain't that right sister alyssa
[2:23:39] god knows where you're at
[2:23:42] when you think what's that mean
[2:23:44] god knows where you're at tonight
[2:23:48] god knows where you're sitting at
[2:23:50] and he knows what you have need of
[2:23:54] last year we witnessed some very
[2:23:56] supernatural things right here
[2:23:59] right here last weekend supernatural to
[2:24:02] say the least
[2:24:03] lives were changed
[2:24:05] hearts were changed young girls young
[2:24:06] boys went back to their churches filled
[2:24:08] with the holy spirit
[2:24:10] there was such a powerful anointing here
[2:24:13] much like is tonight
[2:24:17] you remember they
[2:24:19] they carried me off back there
[2:24:23] and there were some people that bumped
[2:24:24] into an angel
[2:24:29] that same angel's here
[2:24:37] but i got a real friend here
[2:24:40] and ronnie long
[2:24:49] life's been pretty
[2:24:50] tough sometimes on brother ronnie
[2:24:53] but ronnie long's an overcomer
[2:24:57] he's a real testimony of this message
[2:25:03] his brother ronnie was taking care of me
[2:25:05] and taking me back to my
[2:25:07] caper last year
[2:25:09] i told brother ronnie i said mother
[2:25:11] honey i'm going to give you this
[2:25:13] handkerchief
[2:25:16] i'm going to give you this handkerchief
[2:25:18] inside of it is a prayer cloth that
[2:25:20] william branham prayed over
[2:25:22] it's for you
[2:25:24] it meant a lot to brother ronnie because
[2:25:26] there were some details there
[2:25:27] that i won't share right now
[2:25:30] that the lord knew
[2:25:34] you know god cares where you are
[2:25:38] is it okay if i prove to you that god
[2:25:40] knows where you're at
[2:25:47] we had a real tragic accident happen to
[2:25:49] the bride of jesus christ
[2:25:53] we lost
[2:25:55] a young boy and a young girl
[2:25:57] mother charlie and sister rachel
[2:25:59] brother ronnie and sister felice had
[2:26:01] some belongings there
[2:26:03] at their house when that explosion took
[2:26:05] place
[2:26:06] ain't that right
[2:26:09] and he asked sister felice
[2:26:13] they lost about
[2:26:15] 75-80 percent of their belongings in
[2:26:17] that
[2:26:19] he asked sister felicia
[2:26:21] was that handkerchief
[2:26:23] was that handkerchief in there
[2:26:27] in the explosion
[2:26:28] she said yeah i put it in there with the
[2:26:30] rest of your handkerchiefs down in a
[2:26:31] little
[2:26:32] box hunted for it it meant something to
[2:26:35] him
[2:26:36] but god knows where you're at
[2:26:39] just last month brother ronnie
[2:26:41] brother nathan were coming back from
[2:26:43] australia
[2:26:47] and they were they were really tired
[2:26:48] from the meeting
[2:26:50] they'd walked away
[2:26:52] brother ronnie come back to a seat where
[2:26:54] he had been sitting at and he looked
[2:26:56] underneath that chair
[2:27:00] he said
[2:27:01] nathan
[2:27:03] is that yours
[2:27:05] and floated up
[2:27:07] underneath that chair that should have
[2:27:09] been an explosion
[2:27:10] was this handkerchief
[2:27:19] god knows
[2:27:21] how to take care of you
[2:27:24] the supernatural is here
[2:27:27] if god can provide a ram and a thicket
[2:27:32] if god can provide squirrels if god can
[2:27:35] provide a handkerchief surely he can
[2:27:37] produce a change in your life

[2:27:44] is here
[2:27:47] now tonight as the musicians come

[2:29:19] and she stepped back in the line
[2:29:21] and always forgiven
