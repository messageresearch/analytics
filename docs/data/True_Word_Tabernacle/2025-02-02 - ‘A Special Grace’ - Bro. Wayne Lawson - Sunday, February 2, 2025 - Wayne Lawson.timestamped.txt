[1:19] faithful hands in the name of Jesus
[1:22] Christ we pray amen and amen if you got
[1:26] your Bibles today we'd like to just turn
[1:29] into the word of the Lord amen in the
[1:31] book of 2
[1:34] Corinthians I'd like to read the 12th
[1:36] verse 12th chapter the first verse it's
[1:40] a little bit of a lengthy reading here
[2:04] it is not expedient for me doubtless to
[2:07] Glory I will come to visions and
[2:09] Revelations of the Lord and I knew a man
[2:12] in Christ above 14 years ago now whether
[2:15] in the body I cannot tell or whether out
[2:18] of the body I cannot tell God knoweth
[2:21] and such a one was caught up in the
[2:22] third heaven and I knew such a man
[2:26] whether in the body or out of the body I
[2:28] cannot tell God knowth and how that he
[2:31] was caught up into paradise and heard
[2:33] unspeakable Words which is not lawful
[2:36] for a man to utter of course Paul has
[2:39] went beyond and seen into the Paradise
[2:42] in the heavens of
[2:43] God of such one will I Glory yet of
[2:47] myself I will not Glory but in my
[2:51] infirmities for though I would desire to
[2:54] Glory I shall not be a fool for I will
[2:57] say the truth but now I forbear lest any
[3:00] man should think of me above that which
[3:03] he seeth me to be or that he heareth of
[3:05] me and L I should be exalted above
[3:08] measure through the abundance of
[3:09] Revelations there was given to me a
[3:11] thorn in the
[3:12] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[3:15] me lest I should be exalted above
[3:19] measure for this thing I sought the Lord
[3:22] Thrice that it might depart from me and
[3:25] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[3:28] for thee
[3:30] for my strength is made
[3:32] perfect in weakness and most gladly
[3:35] therefore whether I glory in my
[3:37] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[3:41] rest upon me may God bless his word as
[3:43] you could be seated this
[3:45] morning I'd like to uh just take a few
[3:48] minutes in this and speak to you on a
[3:50] special
[3:53] Grace a special Grace um Josh was
[3:57] preaching there brother Josh was
[3:59] preaching last Sunday morning he said
[4:00] something was very powerful he was
[4:02] talking about the change of life and he
[4:04] was talking about the change of seasons
[4:06] and he talked about a a lady and he
[4:08] talks about how that she goes through
[4:10] certain changes and he says and he kind
[4:12] of paraphrases brother brandom he don't
[4:13] say it exactly but he says in that
[4:16] season he said that's when you show a
[4:18] special kind of Grace and it just struck
[4:21] my heart very strongly amen that in the
[4:24] time of change that's when it takes a
[4:26] special kind of Grace amen and I I just
[4:29] want to speak from that a special kind
[4:32] of Grace uh Paul is speaking here when
[4:34] the Lord told him my grace is sufficient
[4:38] for thee that my strength is made
[4:40] perfect in weakness can I uh if you'll
[4:44] bear with me and give me some Grace I'm
[4:46] going to read you something from the
[4:47] Amplified Bible here concerning this he
[4:49] said should I desire to boast I shall
[4:51] not whis bragger for I shall be speaking
[4:53] the truth but abstain from it so that no
[4:56] May from a higher estimate of me than is
[4:58] Justified what see sees in me or hears
[5:00] me and to keep me from being puffed up
[5:02] and too much elated by the exceeding
[5:04] greatness and preeminence of the
[5:06] revelations which has given me a thorn
[5:08] or a splinter in my flesh a messenger of
[5:10] Satan to rack and Buffet me and harass
[5:13] me and to keep me from being excessively
[5:16] exalted three times he said I called
[5:18] upon the Lord and besought and begged
[5:20] that it might depart from me but he said
[5:22] to me my grace my favor and loving
[5:25] kindness and mercy is enough for you
[5:28] sufficient again any danger and enables
[5:31] you to hear to Bear the trouble manfully
[5:35] I like that amen a Grace that lets you
[5:38] bear trouble manfully my strength and my
[5:42] power are made perfect fulfilled and
[5:44] completed and show themselves most
[5:47] effective in your weakness therefore I
[5:50] will more gladly glory in my weakness
[5:53] and my infirmities that the strength and
[5:56] the power of Christ the Messiah May rest
[5:58] yes that that he may pitch his tent over
[6:01] me and that he may dwell upon me I like
[6:04] that in the Greek daglock it actually
[6:06] says this that the power of the anointed
[6:08] May abide on me I don't know about you
[6:11] but I want him to pitch his tent on me
[6:14] amen and abide in me and use me but you
[6:17] see it's in our weaknesses is when he
[6:20] and his power is most evident amen
[6:23] because it's something that's beyond
[6:25] amen uh it's beyond what man can do it's
[6:28] beyond the limitation of man and it has
[6:31] to be the sufficiency of his grace amen
[6:33] the prophet of God says this that that
[6:36] that that Christians of course are not
[6:38] promised a flower bed of ease but they
[6:41] are promised a Grace that is sufficient
[6:44] for every need that they have I thank
[6:47] God for that this morning don't you that
[6:49] every need we have there is a sufficient
[6:52] Grace amen you see brother bam says it
[6:54] like this God promised to go through
[6:56] life any believer to walk without
[6:58] troubles never promised that but he did
[7:01] promise a Grace sufficient to take care
[7:04] of every
[7:05] trouble amen and the Holy Spirit brother
[7:08] B says it like this God has not promised
[7:10] a flowery bed of EAS but has promised
[7:12] Grace sufficient for every trial that
[7:15] can hit you indeed grace is sufficient
[7:19] not on a flower not on a flowery bed but
[7:22] he promised Grace to overcome in every
[7:25] Temptation that's the kind of Grace he's
[7:28] talking about and brother explains this
[7:30] because of apostle Paul had had this uh
[7:33] happen to him and writes about it here
[7:34] in Corinthians he says now Paul said it
[7:37] like this brother Ram said there was
[7:38] about 10 or 15 of them with Paul he said
[7:41] but he was the only one of them that saw
[7:43] that light he said and some people can
[7:45] see things when others don't see Paul
[7:48] saw the light in so much that it blinded
[7:51] him amen and for several days and such
[7:53] reality later on we see letters he wrote
[7:56] and he said his eyes bothered him and he
[7:59] wrote of great big letters seeing that I
[8:01] have written to you in large letters he
[8:03] could hardly see he was in jail and
[8:05] asked the Lord to heal him and consulted
[8:08] him three times but what did the Lord
[8:10] say my grace is sufficient Paul Paul
[8:14] then said I will glory in my infirmity
[8:17] because he said except that I would be
[8:18] exalted above the abundance of
[8:20] Revelation was given a messenger of the
[8:22] devil a thorn in my flesh to Buffet me
[8:25] he'd better uh be for a while then it
[8:27] would he would get better and then it
[8:29] would go away and then it would come
[8:30] back and he said it would Buffet him it
[8:33] was like a blow after a blow like a ship
[8:35] on a sea you know waves blow after blow
[8:39] he said he would get better and then
[8:41] he'd have it again and then he'd get
[8:42] better and then he'd have it again and
[8:44] he'd say Lord what's the matter with me
[8:48] don't why don't you take this from me
[8:50] and he would say my grace is sufficient
[8:53] amen and brother B says see we got to
[8:55] just keep on Amen the grace is
[8:58] sufficient amen I I say this and brother
[9:00] Ram explains this so powerfully in the
[9:03] message Shalom he said I then shall
[9:05] glory in my infirmity I know you're the
[9:08] Healer Lord I've seen you heal the sick
[9:10] can you imagine Paul now suffering his
[9:12] own self I've seen you heal the sick
[9:15] Lord I've seen you as a Healer I've seen
[9:18] you raise the dead I've seen you cast
[9:21] Devils out I've seen you open the eyes
[9:23] of the blind but I have consulted you
[9:26] and you tell me it's your grace is
[9:28] sufficient brother BR said then this
[9:31] devil that bothers me is The Growing
[9:34] Pains of his grace this devil that
[9:37] bothers me is The Growing Pains of his
[9:40] grace amen amen I I want to read I want
[9:42] to say that again so we all on the same
[9:44] page the devil that bothers you is The
[9:47] Growing Pains of your grace amen the
[9:50] devil that bothers that's the thing see
[9:52] amen you you you said brother man says
[9:54] he allowed that devil to attack Paul he
[9:57] said to keep him in a place of pray to
[9:59] keep him in that place of humility now
[10:02] Paul himself is not a false Apostle and
[10:06] a false Apostle someone who was coming
[10:07] along trying to make something of
[10:09] himself would have never revealed his
[10:12] weaknesses to the people he would have
[10:14] never told them of his trials and of his
[10:16] weaknesses because the first time that
[10:18] religious people hear that there's a
[10:20] trial or a Temptation or a sickness of
[10:23] course there's something wrong or
[10:24] there's some weakness in that man or
[10:27] something but Paul on the other hand
[10:28] used used his weaknesses as a credential
[10:32] amen that he would suffer for Christ
[10:34] then Paul didn't brag on his
[10:36] Supernatural side he bragged on the
[10:38] weakness side he told you of the
[10:40] infirmities of his life so that he could
[10:43] tell you I will then glory in my
[10:45] infirmities I will if I'm going to brag
[10:47] to you I'm going to brag to you about
[10:50] the things that I have suffered for the
[10:51] cause of Christ amen and I've not give
[10:54] up yet amen Paul is still writing and
[10:57] Paul is still preaching and the devil
[10:59] has told everything that he has at Paul
[11:01] but Paul is not giving up he's saying
[11:03] look if I'm going to boast to you I'm
[11:06] going to boast to you about the
[11:07] infirmities that I have and what I have
[11:09] went through 2 Corinthians 11 says it
[11:11] like this I have needs of Glory if I
[11:14] must needs Glory I will glory in the
[11:16] things that concern my infirmities amen
[11:20] I love it can I use another version new
[11:22] international if I boast I'll boast of
[11:25] the things that shows my weakness if I'm
[11:27] going to boast I'll boast in show my
[11:29] weakness and that that's a that's a far
[11:31] cry from this religious world that we
[11:34] live in today where where no preachers
[11:36] can say they're sorry no more and nobody
[11:38] can repent in the church no more and if
[11:40] and and if an elder come to the to the
[11:42] to the altar well God forbid there's
[11:44] something Temptation in their life or
[11:46] some trouble that they might need God
[11:48] but I think it's time to do a way with
[11:50] religiosity and traditions of man that
[11:53] prevent men from coming to Christ when
[11:55] they have needs of Christ when they
[11:57] desire Christ amen and the day that we
[12:00] get too big amen to be able to apologize
[12:03] for wrongs or weaknesses in our lives
[12:05] amen is the day that Satan has cut us
[12:07] off from the grace and the help that God
[12:10] has designed for every one of us setting
[12:12] in here today I thank God Amen that we
[12:15] had a pattern like Apostle Paul because
[12:17] this is the very pattern that Willam
[12:19] Brandon followed when he talked about
[12:21] his weaknesses and his struggles and
[12:24] I've had people who were critics of
[12:25] brother random said how do y'all follow
[12:27] a man that was so depressed wanted to
[12:29] take his life at times how do youall
[12:31] follow a man that could lie to the tax
[12:34] amen and and evade being able to talk to
[12:36] the tax man how can y'all follow
[12:38] somebody like that I said because every
[12:40] one of them has troubles but he was the
[12:42] only one transparent about the trouble
[12:45] amen and I would rather know that the
[12:47] man we're following in this age had
[12:49] weaknesses but he knew how to teach the
[12:52] church when you're weak that's when you
[12:54] become strong because you're going to
[12:56] allow God to come on the inside and deal
[12:59] with your life listen friends we have
[13:01] got to religious we have got to the
[13:04] place where we don't don't feel Liberty
[13:06] to say I need help amen pride has shut
[13:09] the door on forgiveness pride has shut
[13:12] the door on repentances of people who
[13:15] living in agony this morning struggling
[13:18] against strongholds in their lives but
[13:20] they're afraid of what somebody's going
[13:21] to think or what somebody's going to say
[13:24] listen I don't care what anybody says I
[13:27] don't care what anybody thinks I want to
[13:29] live free I want to live forgiven I want
[13:32] to live healed I want to live saved I
[13:35] want to live with the power of God in my
[13:37] life and there is times that we must
[13:40] admit the weaknesses and the struggles
[13:44] to know that Christ could pitch his tent
[13:46] Upon
[13:48] Us my goodness Apostle Paul was a very
[13:51] powerful man amen who who was saying
[13:54] that if I'm going to boast I'm going to
[13:58] boast in my weakness
[14:00] that Christ might be
[14:01] glorified because Paul was not trying to
[14:04] sell
[14:05] himself he was trying to sell the
[14:07] messiahship of Christ that can help
[14:10] every man I do appreciate the spirit in
[14:13] our senior pastor here brother Ray
[14:15] because it might have been some of the
[14:17] first times I ever really seen a man
[14:19] admit a weakness or repent or say hey
[14:21] folks I don't have all the answers and I
[14:23] appreciate it because you know what I
[14:25] recognize the spirit of Jesus Christ the
[14:28] spirit of humility is the spirit of
[14:31] Jesus Christ do you see Paul said this
[14:34] therefore my son be strong be strong in
[14:38] the grace that is in Jesus Christ if
[14:42] you're going to be strong now be strong
[14:44] in the grace that is in Jesus Christ
[14:46] that thou has heard me among many
[14:49] witnesses the same commit thou Faithful
[14:51] Men Who Shall be able to teach others
[14:53] thou therefore endure
[14:55] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[15:00] Christ he wouldn't have told Timothy how
[15:02] Amen to endure hardness L hardness was
[15:05] coming but he was preparing him for
[15:07] hardness because he knew hardness was
[15:09] coming and that he would have to endure
[15:11] it as a soldier amen and I believe this
[15:13] morning that we Are Soldiers I like that
[15:17] uh I like that little little song there
[15:19] s Sister Mary she's and all these little
[15:22] kids cuz once a while we get Eevee down
[15:23] there and some of the kids will be in
[15:25] the in the living room and we'll get
[15:26] them singing Sunday school songs and we
[15:28] get them singing they they like that one
[15:30] I'm in the Lord's army amen I'm in the
[15:34] Lord's army they know it man they know
[15:36] that song at a four-year-old they're in
[15:38] the Lord's army now they don't shoot
[15:40] missiles they Don't Ride Calvary but
[15:42] they're in the Lord's army and I believe
[15:44] God's looking for soldiers come on
[15:47] church amen sometimes we get a hang nail
[15:50] and we want to resign from the battle
[15:52] some little struggle come we want to
[15:53] resign from the battle we'll we'll just
[15:55] pull back because we got our nail
[15:57] clipped or somebody Ste on our toe amen
[16:00] listen God's looking for soldiers this
[16:02] morning amen people that is able Amen to
[16:05] face the battles of this life and
[16:08] understand that God saved me he didn't
[16:11] save me for a day he didn't save me for
[16:13] a moment he saved me for Time and
[16:16] Eternity and he sealed me knowing I was
[16:19] going to go through struggles and
[16:20] battles and ups and downs and ins and
[16:22] outs amen this is Christian walk is not
[16:25] a fiery bed of ease and he would have
[16:27] sealed you he would have never said it
[16:29] that he sealed you to the day of
[16:30] redemption unless it was a reason to put
[16:32] a fast seal on you where later Jude was
[16:35] saying that God has kept me from failing
[16:39] he has kept me by the power of God
[16:41] listen I'll tell you this amen when you
[16:43] brother Ram talks about the sealing of
[16:45] that rail car he said that that that was
[16:47] sealed because it had a
[16:49] journey and this Christian walk is a
[16:52] journey it's not a Sprint it's not the
[16:55] 40 yard dash amen this is a journey and
[16:59] the day you become a Christian it begins
[17:01] and it don't end till you cross into
[17:03] that Immortal Life and God has given us
[17:06] a Grace this morning that is good from
[17:08] the very moment that we have accepted
[17:11] him until the time that we cross the
[17:13] finish
[17:14] line I'm glad to know that he knew what
[17:18] he was doing when he gave us his seal
[17:20] upon this life in Hebrews chapter 4 the
[17:23] Bible said he is a high priest he said
[17:26] we don't have one that cannot be touched
[17:28] but the feeling of the infirmities but
[17:30] he was in all points tempted like we are
[17:34] without sin I love this verse let us
[17:37] therefore come
[17:39] boldly under the throne of grace that we
[17:42] may obtain
[17:44] mercy and find Grace to help in the time
[17:48] of need isn't that powerful to find
[17:51] Grace in the time of need help in the
[17:54] time of need I know sometimes it's so
[17:56] hard for us to admit that we need help
[17:59] we've been we've been serving the lord
[18:01] all these years so L sometimes you need
[18:04] help sometimes you got to just get rid
[18:07] of all the religion and say God help me
[18:10] I don't even know how to ask for what I
[18:12] need but I know I need something brother
[18:14] Tom sometimes you can go to places in
[18:17] prayer where you don't know how to even
[18:19] talk anymore but there's an Angelic
[18:21] language that takes over the tongue and
[18:24] there's an intercessor prayer and you
[18:26] begin to tell God what you need and he's
[18:28] answering back because you don't know
[18:30] how to explain
[18:32] it sometime people say well there's
[18:35] something wrong with me and I ask him
[18:36] what's wrong they said I don't
[18:38] know I just need
[18:41] help just need help come on that woman
[18:44] woman at sishan Watch What She Done
[18:46] Jesus unlocked a truth to her that
[18:48] changed her both dispensation and
[18:51] dimensionally when she looked at him and
[18:53] she said Lord amen but before she said
[18:55] that she actually worshiped him and the
[18:57] Bible said he didn't pay or no
[19:00] mind so we know what to do when he
[19:02] answers prayer but what we do when he
[19:04] don't answer
[19:05] prayer she didn't get mad and leave you
[19:09] know what she did the Bible said she
[19:10] worshiped him the more and said Lord and
[19:14] when that truth unlocked it unlocked the
[19:16] dispensation she was in and it unlocked
[19:19] the den dimension of healing that she
[19:22] was needing her body it released it to
[19:24] her amen because of her approach to him
[19:28] when she just told him she needed
[19:33] help sir don't get so
[19:37] prideful and don't forget this that he
[19:40] can be
[19:41] touched I want you to remember this you
[19:44] can contact God don't young people
[19:47] listen don't you forget this that your
[19:49] daddy and masas got this far CU they
[19:51] knew how to get a hold of
[19:52] God and I don't care what your age is if
[19:55] you need help he answers prayers he
[19:58] prayers you can get to a place with God
[20:01] Amen now we've got to the place where we
[20:02] pray I know we pray over our meals and
[20:04] we pray over one another and we say
[20:06] prayers and that's all good but
[20:08] sometimes you got to pray
[20:11] through sometimes amen you got to pray
[20:13] through you know what that means you got
[20:15] to pray till you break through the
[20:17] feeling nobody loves me nobody cares
[20:20] nobody wants me around nobody's
[20:22] accepting me I'm not in the click I'm
[20:24] not in the circle I what is it it's
[20:26] designed to isolate you from the help
[20:29] that you need amen but if you just begin
[20:32] to pray there's a place you can go that
[20:35] there is Grace in the time of your need
[20:38] if there ever was a people that need him
[20:40] I don't know about you but I need him I
[20:42] need him I need him for my walk I need
[20:45] him in my mornings I'm not such a good
[20:47] person I got to have him every day I got
[20:50] to have him every morning I got to start
[20:52] my days off with
[20:55] Jesus and you may be inherently a good
[20:58] person I'm not I needed
[21:00] saving altto together I needed saving
[21:04] was it one good thing about me I needed
[21:07] him then and if I needed him then God
[21:10] have mercy I need him this morning I
[21:13] need him more than I've ever needed him
[21:15] and I say God help us help us as a
[21:18] church help us as a people help us as a
[21:21] as a lifegiving source to this
[21:23] generation that we are living
[21:26] in now if you're gonna if you're going
[21:29] to pray like that and you're going to
[21:30] get in his anointing like that and
[21:32] you're going to invite his presence in
[21:34] like that don't be surprised when people
[21:37] come needing
[21:39] help because now he's resided in
[21:43] you and that mercy seat this morning is
[21:46] not in heaven
[21:47] folks that Mercy seat's in this bride
[21:51] and if anybody's going to show Mercy
[21:53] they're going to have to find it in the
[21:55] place Mercy can be
[21:57] found I know teachers went away off with
[21:59] that but it still remains true brother B
[22:02] said on the day of Pentecost that Holy
[22:03] Ghost came down and made the heart of
[22:05] man his throne and this morning amen you
[22:09] are the seed of mercy no wonder God
[22:12] sends certain individuals in your life
[22:14] brother kind no wonder amen God would
[22:16] send people amen they talk to you and
[22:19] sometimes they're beaten and they're
[22:20] broken and you say what are they doing
[22:21] talking to me it's because you had
[22:24] fellowship with a merciful god and he's
[22:26] trying to get you to distribute rute
[22:28] that Mercy to somebody else come on we
[22:32] want Grace for us and we want Grace in
[22:35] us but let Grace flow through
[22:38] Uso
[22:41] brother let it flow through US
[22:47] Lord he never promised a trouble-free
[22:51] life but he did promise Grace sufficient
[22:54] to take care of the trouble that come
[22:57] you know
[22:59] in the exposition of the church ages
[23:00] brother BR speaking of this he goes he
[23:03] talks about the death of Antipas and the
[23:06] faithful mortars and them that live
[23:08] their lives under death and he said we
[23:11] think of it of these people that it
[23:13] would be almost impossible to be a
[23:15] mortar but we dare to recall that the
[23:18] faith that we daily use to Triumph in
[23:21] Christ is the same faith that upholds
[23:24] the poops and the martys
[23:26] martyrs a supreme faith
[23:29] will give Supreme
[23:31] Grace for a supreme
[23:33] hour I think if there has ever been a
[23:37] supreme hour We're living that
[23:39] one if there's ever been a dark day
[23:41] that's this
[23:42] one if there ever was a time of Darkness
[23:46] it's the age we're in now the prophet
[23:48] said it's been blacked out and announced
[23:51] that Satan was the God of this age we're
[23:53] living in he is the worshiped one of
[23:56] this age this is Satan's Eden it has
[23:59] become so dark but I find that in
[24:02] Supreme hours is when there's given
[24:05] Supreme Grace you know I I think of this
[24:08] in James chapter 4 and verse 6 but he
[24:12] giveth more
[24:14] grace ain't you glad that's in the Bible
[24:17] but he giveth more grace so brother
[24:20] Wayne I need more he giveth more grace
[24:25] in a supreme hour he giveth Supreme
[24:29] Grace special kinds of
[24:33] Grace he giveth more grace and I you
[24:35] read the rest of this and it really
[24:37] brings it into Focus wherefore he saith
[24:39] God resisteth the
[24:41] proud but giveth Grace unto the humble
[24:46] why does he give grace to the humble
[24:47] because they're humble enough to
[24:50] realize they're insignificance their
[24:53] littleness their inabilities their their
[24:56] need for God and by doing so they
[24:58] approach him in a way that he can help
[25:03] them the day that we think that we did
[25:06] it on our own is the
[25:08] day that we find out we
[25:13] didn't
[25:15] now brother Bram invisible union he
[25:18] comes out and preaches Romans the 7th
[25:19] chapter he said well a lot of people
[25:20] thinks this is a marriage and divorce
[25:22] chapter he said but really is not it's
[25:24] prothetic of the end time of the
[25:26] marriage of the bride and bridegroom
[25:28] room and he said when when Mr Moody
[25:31] Dwight moody in Chicago read this he
[25:34] said he ran out into the
[25:36] streets and said do you know
[25:40] Grace and somebody said Grace who he
[25:43] said oh the grace of
[25:45] God do you know him do you know Grace I
[25:48] mean the grace of God not not man's
[25:51] Grace not that kind that they give it
[25:53] and take it back and there's limitations
[25:55] to it and and you know it's graceful up
[25:57] to this point you know you talked about
[26:00] my family you did this you said that
[26:02] amen Grace to that no I'm not talking
[26:04] about that I'm talking about a prophet
[26:07] standing and looking to the grace of God
[26:08] and saying you can exhaust his
[26:10] Mercy but you can never yes exhaust his
[26:16] grace
[26:18] Hallelujah Lord you see grace whom
[26:21] brother B said it like this he said he
[26:22] was so thrilled to see what Grace had
[26:24] done separating the law he said Amazing
[26:27] Grace oh when I get to the other side
[26:30] brother Bram said I'm going to sing an
[26:33] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[26:37] saved a wret like me see grace precious
[26:40] Grace more of Grace to know for it was
[26:44] by Grace you were saved and not what we
[26:46] could do whatever we do is not counted
[26:49] to us for Grace is what saves Us by
[26:52] Grace you are saved and it is through
[26:55] faith now watch what brother M will say
[26:57] he said said and may I add to this this
[26:59] woman of Grace I'll Place her in the
[27:02] Bible she is the elect lady oh have you
[27:06] ever noticed this in Revelations the
[27:08] 21st chapter the Bible said come and let
[27:10] me show you the
[27:12] bride the Lamb's
[27:15] wife now that's that's an important
[27:19] significance he doesn't say the Lion's
[27:22] wife he said the Lamb's wife and when he
[27:25] looks in the fifth seal and sees them
[27:27] crying for V he said by that I know
[27:30] that's not the
[27:31] bride because the bride would never be
[27:34] crying for for for vengeance she would
[27:36] have been crying for
[27:38] forgiveness because she's the bride the
[27:41] Lamb's wife she is the wife of the
[27:43] attribute of lamb come on he was the
[27:46] lion the tribe of Judah and his Justice
[27:49] would have destroyed everybody but the
[27:51] lamb nature overcome the line and
[27:54] prevailed to give Grace and we married
[27:57] the Lamb of God
[27:59] oh I'll tell you I'm married to a lamb
[28:01] I'm married to a graceful I can tell you
[28:04] this I got a checkbook and before I even
[28:06] ask him I know I can show grace to you I
[28:09] can write it out for whatever you need I
[28:12] can write it out I can say yes we got
[28:14] you covered amen because I know I know
[28:17] the one I married I know his nature I
[28:19] know his character there is no case he
[28:21] can't cure there is no person too low he
[28:24] can't save there's nobody that he cannot
[28:27] show Grace to
[28:28] because he is Sovereign
[28:32] Grace oh that woman Grace she's the
[28:35] elect lady she's the
[28:38] bride she's the
[28:41] elected uh brother Brown talks about it
[28:45] and he says it here he says you know he
[28:47] says back in 1962 and it's it's a in the
[28:50] message communion it's in
[28:53] 62204 and brother man begins this
[28:55] talking about astronomers
[28:59] excuse
[29:01] me he talks about astronomers and while
[29:04] he's talking about
[29:07] this he says the Indians have seen the
[29:11] Indian people have seen that there's
[29:13] some Stars lining up and he names five
[29:15] of them and he says and they're
[29:18] expecting something to happen like the
[29:21] Earth to blow
[29:22] apart he said and the Americans are
[29:25] laughing at them on TV for believing
[29:27] that and brother Bram said' now I don't
[29:29] believe what they're saying is going to
[29:31] happen but there is some significance in
[29:34] it and he said 'I predict it has a
[29:36] spiritual
[29:37] application and I believe it's the
[29:39] coming in of the issue of God that great
[29:41] Revelations of the word will be open
[29:43] during this
[29:45] time now that's in the spring of
[29:50] 1962 that he says look now there's
[29:52] there's Stars lining up and they're
[29:54] thinking it's the end of the world he
[29:56] said but as a prophet I'm predicting to
[29:57] you you that the words F to open
[29:59] something that you ain't seen yet now
[30:02] watch what's happening remember they
[30:03] claim three stars came together in the
[30:05] orbits when Jesus was born but now this
[30:07] is five which is Grace the number of
[30:10] perfection see the number of Grace Jesus
[30:12] see grace the number of Grace God ever
[30:15] sends his power to the church it'll be
[30:17] his grace It Won't Be The Obedience of
[30:21] the
[30:22] people and then he's going to quote
[30:25] Isaiah the 40th chapter when the Bible
[30:27] says yet see what he says remember when
[30:29] he sends John he says your Warfare is
[30:32] over for the Lord had to Pardon your
[30:35] iniquities and you have received double
[30:37] for your
[30:39] sins and and it wasn't the people the
[30:42] people was not in any better shape when
[30:44] John came than there was hundreds of
[30:46] years before that but the three stars
[30:49] had lined up and God was giv grace to
[30:52] the dispensation so the word was coming
[30:54] into flesh which was bringing Grace
[30:57] despite the people that were on the
[31:00] earth now you said preacher what are you
[31:03] talking about here's a number five and
[31:05] here's a prophet saying it's not the Son
[31:08] of God it's his wife that she's going to
[31:11] be borned into the Earth and the word
[31:14] itself is going to have to birth her
[31:16] into its presence I'll tell you this a
[31:18] prophet stood there and called for a
[31:20] virgin bride didn't he didn't he call
[31:22] for a virgin bride and you showed up
[31:25] because a prophet put those words words
[31:28] into the atmosphere he was more than a
[31:31] theologian he was more than a preacher
[31:35] he was a prophet of God that didn't have
[31:37] his own thought but he was expressing
[31:39] the thoughts of God and he began to say
[31:41] an infant church is going to be birthed
[31:44] in the years of 1962 and 3 there's going
[31:46] to come an infant Church into the Earth
[31:48] she's going to be
[31:50] birthed what's it going to be the grace
[31:53] of
[31:54] God come on now now you you got know
[31:58] this enough to know that Pentecostals
[32:00] could fast and pray all they want to how
[32:01] you ever going to break them
[32:04] seals John was crying and said and only
[32:07] the lamb could take the book so who's
[32:10] going to take it and how are they going
[32:11] to manifest it and how's it going to be
[32:13] unless the grace of God would come
[32:16] because it's in the season of change
[32:18] there has to be a special Grace given in
[32:21] that hour what's the hand of Grace with
[32:23] Abraham and Sarah at the time of her
[32:26] change she laughed at the angel of the
[32:29] Lord and God could have killed her but
[32:32] he didn't take her life because she was
[32:34] a part of the prophecy she was a part of
[32:37] the very plan that God had and how could
[32:40] he kill her amen and not kill his own
[32:43] plan but God showed a special kind of
[32:46] Grace to Sarah amen that she might
[32:49] understand and believe in the season of
[32:51] her change and I'll say this this
[32:53] morning there has been a a special Grace
[32:56] given in this bride Church that has took
[32:58] you some of come on some of us has been
[33:00] put every which direction but
[33:04] right God never left you in
[33:08] that what if he had left us where he
[33:10] found
[33:11] us what if he had left us in some of
[33:14] them doctrines we got engulfed in and
[33:16] some of the fellowships are mind and we
[33:18] were so RI in them wasn't we we were so
[33:21] R in them amen but God rich in Mercy he
[33:25] came to you anyhow and he broke into
[33:27] your darkness and he stepped in there
[33:30] and said son it's not right daughter
[33:32] it's not right and it broke that thing
[33:35] off of you and then it give you Grace to
[33:37] come out of it it give you Grace to
[33:39] follow after it it's a special kind of
[33:43] Grace Hallelujah I'll give it to you in
[33:46] a more simple way you just had a real
[33:48] Fallout with somebody in your home or
[33:49] your church or something like that and
[33:51] you go sit down in your chair and you
[33:52] fold your arms so this ain't going to
[33:54] get fixed till they fix
[33:56] it and you just not all up you know I I
[33:59] know nobody's ever done
[34:01] that and I'm explaining it pretty good
[34:04] ain't
[34:07] I I'm just not going to apologize for
[34:09] this I didn't do it there's no sense in
[34:13] this that's a good old hillbilly word
[34:15] right there no
[34:18] sense but all of a sudden some almost
[34:22] something starts starring in your
[34:25] heart what if I would have treated did
[34:27] you this
[34:32] way oh
[34:38] my what if he would have had the
[34:41] impatience with
[34:43] me that I've had with his
[34:50] children but it's only in those in those
[34:54] sacred moments like that
[34:58] that you really understand what God is
[35:00] really trying to get to you yeah is I
[35:04] don't want you to read about
[35:06] Grace I don't want you to think about
[35:09] Grace I want you to give
[35:14] Grace to give it you had to possess it
[35:16] in a special
[35:20] way it's almost like you have to
[35:23] understand it's not yours to
[35:26] give could I say it to you like this if
[35:28] I walked up to
[35:30] you let's just say you had $100 in your
[35:33] pocket I said Nathaniel give Samuel $100
[35:35] you
[35:37] go I work 10 hours for that
[35:41] $100 but if I just walk up and give you
[35:43] $100 and said hey would you hand that to
[35:44] Samuel you
[35:48] just because it's not yours you're just
[35:52] giving away what you have received
[35:59] when he give you Grace he gave it to you
[36:04] freely and we could go we could go very
[36:07] deep in this area but I'm not going to
[36:09] I'm just going to I'm just going to
[36:10] touch it in Romans the 5th chapter the
[36:13] Bible said that we are justified by
[36:15] faith didn't it we are justified by
[36:18] faith therefore we have peace with God
[36:19] Ephesians says that we are saved by
[36:21] grace and that is through faith yes
[36:24] right well let me ask you this where'd
[36:26] you get the faith to believe it
[36:28] yeah the entire concept of Christianity
[36:31] comes from you believe right as a as a
[36:34] gentile Soldier you can only receive
[36:37] what you can believe why is it you
[36:40] believe and somebody else don't
[36:42] believe you might you might aale that to
[36:45] your birth or to your raising I can't do
[36:47] it because I've seen people raised just
[36:49] like you and don't believe I've seen
[36:51] people raised just like you and turned
[36:53] it away I've seen people come from The
[36:54] Gutter and believe it and people come
[36:56] from mansions and disbelieve it so it
[36:58] ain't where you come from in this life
[37:03] but God who is rich in Mercy put a seed
[37:06] on the inside of you that belongs to him
[37:09] and the Very salvation that you have
[37:11] didn't belong to you to begin with you
[37:14] was not saved by your desire you were
[37:18] saved by the desire of God but you were
[37:21] dead in sins and trespasses unless God
[37:24] gave Grace you would not be here this
[37:26] morning
[37:29] so old brother Wayne soup I believed it
[37:31] but it's not even your faith to believe
[37:33] [Applause]
[37:35] with you how do you how do you muster
[37:38] the faith to
[37:40] believe but if you hadn't had something
[37:42] to believe you couldn't receive Grace
[37:46] but grace started Hallelujah grace
[37:49] started when God chose you and elected
[37:52] you before the foundation of the world
[37:55] and when you heard this beautiful
[37:56] message you said I believe
[37:59] that don't run off with your nose in the
[38:02] air like you've done something on your
[38:06] own and when somebody else don't believe
[38:09] God have mercy don't look down on
[38:12] them because God rich in Mercy gave us
[38:16] an opportunity and a Grace that we could
[38:19] stand there and say Lord we don't
[38:21] understand it but maybe I could conduct
[38:23] myself in such a way they'd be nice to
[38:25] me
[38:28] come
[38:29] on CU you might not believe who you are
[38:32] but he knows who you are do you know
[38:34] Grace do you know the elect lady called
[38:37] the Lamb's wife do you realize the Bible
[38:39] predicted out of Zion shall come saviors
[38:42] and you are in an unredeemed form coming
[38:45] to the Earth but you're an attribute of
[38:47] the savior of God and he comes down and
[38:49] saves you fills you with the Holy Ghost
[38:51] and the same one that healed the blind
[38:54] that saved the lepers that gave life is
[38:57] on inside of every person sitting in
[38:59] this
[39:00] building and though somebody may never
[39:02] read a
[39:04] Bible every time they come into contact
[39:07] with the bride of Christ they have
[39:09] contacted the god of
[39:15] Eternity
[39:19] Hallelujah now the classes that I'm
[39:22] talking about that elect lady brother
[39:23] bramy divides them in s his church age
[39:26] he said listen we could go a step
[39:28] further and let me know let you know
[39:30] this the purpose of God in election
[39:32] stands his purpose stands in
[39:35] election this bride who was forn and
[39:38] beloved before she was ever brought
[39:40] forth in the ages she was Redeemed by
[39:43] his blood and can never somebody say
[39:46] never and can never come into
[39:48] condemnation she can never be in the
[39:51] Judgment because
[39:53] sin
[39:55] cannot be imputed under her
[40:00] her you I got Bible for it Romans chap 4
[40:03] and: 8 blessed is the man whom the Lord
[40:04] will not impute sin amen blessed is he
[40:09] for he cannot go through judgment now
[40:12] there's there's other people so don't
[40:13] get don't don't get that mixed up now
[40:17] because there's another class who have
[40:18] their names on the land's Book of Life
[40:20] that'll come up in the second
[40:21] resurrection and they'll be judged by
[40:23] their deeds right because they have a
[40:25] book of of life and they'll be judged
[40:27] for from what they did that's in Matthew
[40:29] 25 that is where he divides them from
[40:32] the left and right remember there's
[40:33] people on the left and people on the
[40:35] right those people on the right they
[40:36] divide them as sheep and goat brother B
[40:38] says it's not sheep because the bride's
[40:39] not in that judgment she sets in
[40:43] judgment she's on the other side of the
[40:45] of the she's not on that side she's on
[40:48] this side of the Judgment so she's
[40:51] passing judgment and those that are on
[40:53] the right now there's there's different
[40:54] classes of everybody on the right there
[40:56] and some of them did good to people and
[40:58] this is theologically hard on a lot of
[41:00] people but some people will be there
[41:02] that never were born
[41:05] again the prophet of God said just
[41:07] because they had been
[41:13] good who are
[41:17] you have you considered who you
[41:22] are that the way somebody approaches you
[41:25] could determine their eternal
[41:33] life have you considered
[41:40] that tears me to pieces to know my
[41:43] weaknesses to know my my inner
[41:46] conscience and my fears and and but I
[41:48] say God help
[41:51] me I'm more than just a preacher or just
[41:54] a pastor or your friend I am a son of
[41:57] the almighty
[41:59] God Grace has been dispensed through
[42:03] this life into this Earth and people
[42:05] that come in contact with that life have
[42:07] come in contact with the grace of
[42:12] God do you know
[42:14] her missg
[42:17] grace I know I know that's theologically
[42:19] hard but I'm a Believer and I just
[42:21] accept the prophet as
[42:24] true that's part of that what Grace I
[42:26] was talking about I just believe
[42:29] him don't ask me why I do I just
[42:33] do now there's also another group of
[42:37] course that brother Bram said are
[42:38] borderline Christians and you saw them
[42:40] when you saw Judas and balum there's a
[42:43] fourth and a final one who never have
[42:45] their names on the Lamb's Book of Life
[42:47] of course which of them like pharaoh and
[42:49] they were made for this day of
[42:50] wickedness now brother bandam says that
[42:53] that this portion of the word is really
[42:55] hard for the human mind to Gra ASP yeah
[42:58] he says see it must be accepted and
[43:00] believed by
[43:02] faith some will be offended by what I
[43:06] have set forth and they will fail to
[43:09] understand the sovereignty of God which
[43:12] sets forth that God is good and because
[43:14] he is God one cannot defeat his counsel
[43:17] or thought or will or his purpose he is
[43:20] omnipotent and ruling in all Affairs
[43:24] look at this the reason people don't
[43:26] understand is because they they don't
[43:27] conceive the sovereignty of God right
[43:31] amen God is Sovereign I believe I
[43:33] believe without any
[43:36] hindrance that he sovereignly
[43:38] rules over the whole
[43:41] world then people of course say you mean
[43:44] God lets this happen he lets this take
[43:46] place he lets this take place now watch
[43:48] the prophet teaches us easily uh if
[43:51] you've ever read author pink he wrote a
[43:53] a sermon called the sovereignty of God
[43:55] brother B actually read it and then
[43:56] talks about it in God of this evil age
[43:59] amen and what he says is people say well
[44:01] because of all the sickness and all the
[44:03] evil and all the trouble has God lost
[44:07] control see if he's Sovereign and all of
[44:10] this is happening has he lost control
[44:13] brother R said oh no he said it's been
[44:16] prophesied in Scripture that LE oosa age
[44:18] would come and it describes the age and
[44:21] it described what it would be like he
[44:23] said but God could never lead the world
[44:26] into that he said so he allows the
[44:29] spirit of Truth and error to come into
[44:31] the Earth and he says the people that
[44:34] believe the truth will escape that but
[44:37] the people that believe the error will
[44:38] go into the cages of the unclean bird
[44:41] because they're following a
[44:45] lie and be damned by the LIE they
[44:47] believe but God is Sovereign so he
[44:49] allows Satan into these situations so
[44:52] when the world is full with all these
[44:54] troubles amen what kind of God would he
[44:56] be to step
[44:59] back his
[45:01] grace when he knew these kinds of times
[45:05] were coming folks you are living in the
[45:07] age of pressure there has never been
[45:10] more pressure on a human being than the
[45:12] age we're living in brother man said
[45:15] pressure is on it's on from the top to
[45:17] the bottom on rulers on leaders on
[45:20] religion it's on
[45:22] everybody come on you heard the sermon
[45:24] let off the pressure amen pressure is on
[45:27] everybody but what is it at the age of
[45:29] pressure he said with every Temptation
[45:32] there is a way of Escape at the age of
[45:35] pressure there's going to come a special
[45:41] Grace God's going to tell the whole
[45:44] story in your
[45:45] dispensation he's going to give you
[45:47] Revelation that has not been given to
[45:49] any age prior to your age he's going to
[45:52] give a revelation to help you understand
[45:55] why am I here why am I going through
[45:57] this and what will the outcome of what
[45:59] I'm happening will be men have faced
[46:01] these for years and didn't have the
[46:03] answers but when you face the trials of
[46:05] this age when you face the age you're
[46:07] living in you have had the three-fold
[46:10] purpose of God revealed to you in this
[46:12] dispensation brother Bram says it like
[46:15] this he says in the first seal he says
[46:17] them Thunders them Revelations 10 he
[46:19] said there're a mystery and we don't
[46:21] know what they are yet but my opinion
[46:23] they'll be revealed right away and when
[46:24] it does it will give us faith for
[46:27] rapturing grace for the church to move
[46:30] out now I could preach an hour on that
[46:34] just just say this term and and I want
[46:36] you to write this one down faith for
[46:40] Grace faith for Grace the human mind
[46:44] won't be able to grasp this one it will
[46:47] take Faith for this kind of
[46:50] Grace it'll take it'll take your faith
[46:53] to believe God for this kind of Grace
[46:57] right the kind of Grace that could call
[46:59] you in all of your troubles brother Bon
[47:02] says it like this he says God knows he
[47:04] says now wait a minute it'll reveal in
[47:06] that day don't write it John because
[47:08] they're going to stagger over
[47:10] it he said but let it go I'll reveal it
[47:13] in the day when it needs to be
[47:17] done there were other ages he could have
[47:19] released this Revelation but they didn't
[47:22] have the faith to believe
[47:25] it they would have staggered over the
[47:28] realities of what we're talking about
[47:29] this morning but Grace has given you
[47:32] Faith to believe
[47:36] Grace oh Hallelujah in Exodus 33 and13
[47:41] Moses said this I pray thee if I have
[47:43] found Grace in thy sight show me now thy
[47:46] way that I may Know Thee that I may find
[47:49] Grace in thy sight what's what's Moses
[47:51] doing he said Lord if I found Grace show
[47:55] me your way so he's tying together the
[47:58] idea of Grace and
[48:00] Revelation that when God gives Grace he
[48:02] gives Revelation that's his that's his
[48:05] understanding Revelation comes by Grace
[48:07] see when Grace really strikes your life
[48:09] then you understand something because it
[48:11] comes to you by faith or it comes by
[48:14] Revelation spiritual Revelations brother
[48:17] B tells us this he says we can be just
[48:19] as religious and sincere and perhaps he
[48:22] says as what this man was of Cain he
[48:25] said but the only thing that made the
[48:27] difference this man had a spiritual
[48:29] revelation of God's requirements the
[48:31] difference between Cain and Abel was
[48:34] Cain didn't have the requirements of
[48:37] spiritual Revelation he didn't know what
[48:39] God required amen do you see amen
[48:42] spiritual Revelation see it's it's what
[48:45] works by Grace see and the only way
[48:48] you'll ever know the difference see the
[48:50] my Presbyterian Lutheran Baptist the
[48:52] only way that you'll ever know is God
[48:54] has got to personally reveal himself to
[48:56] you you in the power of the Holy Ghost
[48:59] before you can know it Jesus said
[49:02] himself that the scripture said no man
[49:03] can save can call me Jesus except by the
[49:06] Holy
[49:07] Ghost see then it takes the Holy Spirit
[49:10] to reveal to the individual and that
[49:13] shows him Grace watch here in Works
[49:16] Faith expressed brother B said here he
[49:18] said I where where I want to say faith
[49:20] is a revelation from God faith is a
[49:23] revelation and I want to say just a
[49:24] moment now it's a revelation he has
[49:27] revealed it to you by his
[49:31] grace I've been studying the seventh
[49:33] seal for about a week I thought I'd be
[49:34] preaching on it this weekend but Lord
[49:36] put something different on my heart here
[49:38] Friday night so this is where we are but
[49:41] this seven seal he says this in the end
[49:43] of his book he says this he said now you
[49:45] may understand this that it's your grace
[49:48] to them that these things are
[49:53] revealed now I'm going to try to get
[49:56] into that seven still pretty soon and
[49:57] you'll see what he's talking about all
[49:59] of them things that
[50:01] happened and it's his grace to you that
[50:05] they're
[50:05] revealed do you see in in in in here in
[50:09] Zechariah Chapter
[50:11] 4 what the scriptures were were uh if
[50:15] you if you know of zerubabel how many
[50:17] knows who zerubabel is in the Bible I
[50:19] just see your hand so I can kind of most
[50:22] of the crowd knows who zerubabel was
[50:24] zerubabel was an Israelite in the time
[50:28] when Daniel and the Hebrew children were
[50:29] carried into Persia or Babylon then it
[50:32] became Persia and and zerubabel was one
[50:35] of the men jerub and Joshua two of them
[50:37] were released to go back to Jerusalem
[50:39] and rebuild the Temple that had been
[50:42] tore down Solomon's Temple it had been
[50:44] released to do so and when this had
[50:46] happened in Zechariah the 4th chapter he
[50:49] said who art thou oh great Mountain
[50:51] before zerubabel for thou sh become a
[50:53] plain so when he gets ready to go back
[50:55] he says to him what what's the mountain
[50:57] between him and what I'm sending him to
[51:00] do now whatever that mountain is it
[51:03] shall become a plane you see he's
[51:05] telling him that what I'm sending you to
[51:08] do is my sovereign
[51:10] will and there's no mountain going to
[51:13] stop
[51:15] it there's no troubles that can
[51:18] prevent this from taking place then
[51:21] there's going to be a time of trouble
[51:22] there's there's things things going to
[51:24] happen like crazy zable he but that
[51:27] mountain shall become a plain and I say
[51:30] this to you amen when William Brandon
[51:32] fulfills this scripture in the end time
[51:34] he's rebuilding the Church of the Living
[51:36] God and there was some mountains of
[51:38] Pentecost and Baptist and Lutheran and
[51:41] Presbyterian and there was every kind of
[51:43] witch doctor and every kind of sickness
[51:45] and problems and even in his own life
[51:48] his birth to a alcoholic family with an
[51:51] illegitimate raising amen come up
[51:53] without without illiterate I mean come
[51:56] up literate in no understanding not
[51:58] through any channels any schools he had
[52:00] mountains before
[52:02] him but God intended for you to get this
[52:06] message and he said whatever mountain is
[52:09] between this messenger and them people
[52:12] shall become a plane and God got this
[52:15] message to you listen let me say this if
[52:18] God was God enough to get this message
[52:20] to you he's got enough to keep you once
[52:23] the message gets to you hey you think
[52:25] about all the things God did to get this
[52:27] message into your life brother L you
[52:30] think about all them things that God did
[52:32] now once he gets you there he's going to
[52:34] keep you there it is already written he
[52:37] that had begun the work he will also
[52:39] finish the
[52:41] work I tell you this he's a finisher and
[52:45] when this messenger comes brother R says
[52:47] he shall bring forth a headstone now
[52:48] that's the finishing piece and he will
[52:50] cry
[52:53] Grace he's going to double the grace
[52:58] in the bringing forth of this message it
[53:01] will be

[53:32] you can only take Grace and add to Grace
[53:34] this message was Grace to
[53:37] Grace I'll tell you this amen when you
[53:39] when you look at it now some people
[53:41] maybe wouldn't agree with me here and I
[53:43] I I don't mind them disagreeing but this
[53:45] is something the Lord showed me
[53:46] personally in Titus Chapter 2 it says
[53:49] for the grace of God that bring us
[53:51] salvation has appeared unto all men
[53:52] that's J when Jesus came it appeared
[53:55] unto all men and he says so
[53:57] but we are looking in the 13th verse we
[53:59] are looking for that blessed hope and
[54:01] the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
[54:04] so he knew something had come but he
[54:06] knew something was coming watch in First
[54:08] Peter chapter 1 he said wherefore go to
[54:10] the loins of your mind and be sober to
[54:13] the help of the end for the grace that
[54:15] is to be brought to you at the
[54:17] revelation of Jesus
[54:20] Christ the grace of God had appeared
[54:22] unto all men and they had for 2,000

[55:41] Christ do you see what brother Bram says
[55:43] in the message of Grace he said see he
[55:46] ties himself to this ministry how many
[55:48] realizes that that brother BR puts
[55:51] himself in Zechariah 4 and said just as
[55:54] zerubabel was committ to rebuild that
[55:57] Tabernacle I have been commissioned to
[56:00] rebuild this church and remember in
[56:03] statute of the perfect man he comes
[56:04] along and he says not an
[56:07] organization I'm not building
[56:09] organizations I'm building
[56:12] individuals to be powerhouses with
[56:15] almighty God what's he doing he's

[57:15] going to fill your life and Revival will
[57:18] surge through
[57:21] you this ain't Grace plus what you can
[57:23] do this is the grace of God that's right
[57:27] Grace Grace plus Grace that's why he
[57:31] says not by my but by my power saith the
[57:35] Lord and brother Bram actually actually
[57:39] ties this
[57:41] together and I have to slow down just a
[57:43] moment to say this not by might not by
[57:47] power but by my spirit as Zechariah 4
[57:51] right sir and he says see he will cry to
[57:54] it when these Mysteries
[57:59] unfold he will cry to it Grace
[58:04] Grace see when these things begin to
[58:07] unfold he'll begin to say that it's the
[58:10] grace of
[58:12] God now brother Bram actually will come
[58:16] along and he's going to have some very
[58:18] contradictory statements for the
[58:22] churches but brother bandam says this
[58:24] after he goes beyond the the curtain
[58:26] watch Paul did it now brother randam
[58:29] does it and when he comes back he said I
[58:31] seen y'all over there in white
[58:36] robes and he had the he had the grace to
[58:39] ask the question I'm glad he asked it he
[58:42] said where did these
[58:43] people get those
[58:47] robes and the angel said by the
[58:50] pardoning grace of the word
[59:00] now this this message has placed you
[59:03] under Sovereign pardon
[59:07] power Sovereign I I got to I got to skip
[59:09] a big place here but I got to get to
[59:11] this it's
[59:13] Sovereign it's Sovereign power brother
[59:16] Bram says it like this he said see grace
[59:19] is old and reaches all the way back to
[59:21] Eden remember he said the Blackness of
[59:23] Eden and when they'd sinned how far they
[59:25] was from God he said but that's when God
[59:28] broke in and the grace of God offered a
[59:31] way out through a sacrifice that was the
[59:35] grace of God to Adam because he couldn't
[59:37] help himself so God reached down his
[59:40] hand and brother B said that same Grace
[59:42] reached into Noah's age and the Bible
[59:45] said and Noah found Grace in the sight
[59:46] of the Lord that same hand reached into
[59:50] Moses's age that same hand reached into
[59:53] David's age that same hand was preacher
[59:56] and brother B says and what was it doing
[59:58] Grace was providing and making a
[1:00:02] way not for people that could help
[1:00:07] themselves but people that couldn't help
[1:00:10] themselves the grace of God see grace
[1:00:13] will make a way brother B said he'll
[1:00:15] make a way one of the greatest
[1:00:17] experiences of my life is to see God
[1:00:19] when I get over it and I get under it
[1:00:21] and I can't get around it or there's no
[1:00:23] way God opens a way right yeah somehow
[1:00:28] or another his grace is sufficient to
[1:00:30] carry us
[1:00:32] through and then brother Bram announces
[1:00:34] something in the message of Grace that
[1:00:36] is this is probably first time I've
[1:00:38] heard it all the way up through my
[1:00:40] Ministry it's one of the things that
[1:00:42] never leaves
[1:00:43] you and he announces that Sovereign
[1:00:47] Grace is from a sovereign
[1:00:50] one that Sovereign Grace comes from a
[1:00:52] sovereign one he said then Sovereign
[1:00:55] what what can it
[1:00:58] do have you ever ask yourself this
[1:01:00] morning what can we talk about Grace but
[1:01:02] what can Grace do what is the extensive
[1:01:06] power of Grace what can it do brother B
[1:01:09] says see it can only be given by one
[1:01:11] that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign
[1:01:13] and he gives Sovereign Grace therefore
[1:01:15] being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask
[1:01:19] anybody it does what it wants
[1:01:22] to isn't that wonderful you say can I do
[1:01:25] this this or shall I do this or must I
[1:01:27] do this it doesn't do that Grace is
[1:01:30] Sovereign therefore he can save the
[1:01:33] viest H how did God save him how'd God
[1:01:36] save me because he can
[1:01:38] do what he wants to
[1:01:41] do he is Sovereign brother BR said
[1:01:44] that's right then he saved a Wretch like
[1:01:46] Me it was Grace for William brandham see
[1:01:49] it's Sovereign we don't have to ask
[1:01:51] anybody and then brother Ram proves this
[1:01:54] case he's a Biblical preacher yeah then
[1:01:57] he proves his case at
[1:01:58] Calvary right and he takes the two
[1:02:00] thieves and the thief that's on the
[1:02:02] right and he said the thief on the r is
[1:02:04] in his dying moments and brother
[1:02:06] brandham really expresses this when he
[1:02:09] says in that moment there that dying
[1:02:11] Thief Rejoice to see The Rock in his day
[1:02:13] remember yeah and he says when he looked
[1:02:15] over and seen the Savior hanging there
[1:02:18] and he had the he had the faith to be
[1:02:21] able to say Lord Remember Me In Your
[1:02:25] Kingdom Remember Me Lord I need saving
[1:02:28] Lord and there's a guy hanging just on
[1:02:30] the other side of the
[1:02:33] Cross why didn't he believe who he
[1:02:36] was why did that man believe in the
[1:02:39] other amen come on now something
[1:02:40] Sovereign happened there and when the
[1:02:43] sovereignty of God broke open brother
[1:02:44] bam made an understanding and he said
[1:02:47] that thief on the right he said God had
[1:02:50] never come into his mind before that
[1:02:53] time right he had never served God until
[1:02:58] that moment and people say well there's
[1:03:00] no such thing as deathbed confessions
[1:03:07] sir well they wasn't baptized they ain't
[1:03:09] no way they could be
[1:03:14] saved boy it just tears that legal
[1:03:17] Doctrine to Pieces don't
[1:03:19] it you can't box this God up he's
[1:03:23] Sovereign he's God
[1:03:26] he can save anybody he can heal anybody
[1:03:30] the vest and the lowest but yet God can
[1:03:34] put his t on you and show his glory from
[1:03:38] you he's Sovereign hallu we serve a
[1:03:41] sovereign God now there's two things
[1:03:44] with Sovereign there's a noun and an
[1:03:45] adjective if you're talking about the
[1:03:47] noun it's the person that's Sovereign if
[1:03:49] it's an adjective it's the ACT that's
[1:03:51] Sovereign and the adjective means it
[1:03:54] means you possess a supreme ultimate
[1:03:56] power it means it's unlimited and
[1:03:58] unrestricted and Unbound and God is
[1:04:01] unrestricted and unlimited and Unbound
[1:04:04] and what that he could save because he
[1:04:05] saves because of this pardon power y y
[1:04:08] y'all know when we say the word pardon
[1:04:10] power in English do you know why you
[1:04:12] know what that means why they use the
[1:04:14] word pardon in the King James
[1:04:18] Bible it's because it comes from
[1:04:21] England the pardon the pardon that we
[1:04:23] talk about in political world
[1:04:26] which is used in your Bible comes from
[1:04:29] way back in the early
[1:04:31] 500s after Christ they can dat all the
[1:04:33] way back to a King wesex in England who
[1:04:36] used it in 16 or 688 and when he used it
[1:04:39] he called it the prerogative of
[1:04:42] Mercy a king believed he was King by
[1:04:45] Divine Right how many knows that they
[1:04:47] believed they were King by Divine
[1:04:49] there's an Englishman right there he's a
[1:04:51] king by Divine Right In other words he
[1:04:54] wasn't just King God meting King so by
[1:04:57] divine right he had a prerogative to
[1:04:59] show Mercy to whom he would show
[1:05:04] Mercy later in in 1535 King Henry VII I
[1:05:10] can't read roman numerals but it's a V
[1:05:12] and 31 so I'm thinking that's the eighth
[1:05:15] and 15th is that it it's King Henry VI
[1:05:18] eth told you I had some
[1:05:21] weakness in 1535 he then made it law
[1:05:26] that pardon power was exclusive to the
[1:05:28] crown and he titled it the act of
[1:05:32] Grace it was then that this privilege
[1:05:34] was a
[1:05:36] concession and not a right but it was
[1:05:39] the right of the king to show it to whom
[1:05:41] he would it was called The Royal
[1:05:43] prerogative of
[1:05:45] Mercy the act of Grace do you see this
[1:05:49] is the very thing that happened when
[1:05:51] George Washington become the president
[1:05:52] of the United States when he had a the
[1:05:55] first Rebellion that he had rise up was
[1:05:57] called the Whiskey Rebellion they didn't
[1:05:58] like him taxing the whiskey so they had
[1:06:00] a Whiskey Rebellion show up and George
[1:06:02] Washington pulled out the old history
[1:06:05] pardon to end a
[1:06:09] rebellion brother
[1:06:13] brother he see it was his own people
[1:06:16] that were in
[1:06:17] Rebellion people that he had fought with
[1:06:20] against the British and people that he
[1:06:21] had established a country with and they
[1:06:24] were rebelling against against him see
[1:06:26] you know what he did he pulled out a
[1:06:28] pardon power to make the enmity go
[1:06:33] away to make it where they could be
[1:06:35] American citizens again and just because
[1:06:38] they rebelled or had become enemy it
[1:06:40] would not be
[1:06:42] forever it was an act of Grace it was a
[1:06:45] prerogative of Mercy you might know this
[1:06:48] uh might be kind of amazing to know this
[1:06:50] that they actually pardoned a bunch of
[1:06:52] pirates one time they wanted to end
[1:06:54] piracy didn't
[1:06:57] work do you know Blackbeard was pardoned
[1:07:00] I didn't know that till I got to reading
[1:07:02] this but Blackbeard actually received
[1:07:05] the
[1:07:06] pardon and then later he went back to
[1:07:08] being a
[1:07:11] pirate he enjoyed the benefits of the
[1:07:16] pardon in the United States it's written
[1:07:19] in our constitution I I'll just read
[1:07:21] this to you this is just the portion of
[1:07:23] pardon the president shall have the
[1:07:25] power to Grant reprieves and pardons for
[1:07:29] offenses against the United States
[1:07:31] except in the cases of
[1:07:33] impeachment now watch
[1:07:36] this Congress itself cannot
[1:07:40] constrain the pardon
[1:07:42] power Congress can neither limit the
[1:07:46] effect of his pardon nor exclude it from
[1:07:49] its exercise in any class of
[1:07:54] offender you know they didn't give
[1:07:56] pardon power to the Department of
[1:07:57] Justice they gave it to the executive
[1:08:00] branch y'all know why because the the
[1:08:04] part the Judgment Branch the legal
[1:08:08] Branch Justice is
[1:08:10] blind and if you break the law it's
[1:08:13] blind to who broke it it only passes
[1:08:16] judgment but in the executive branch
[1:08:18] they knew that a man would be able to
[1:08:21] discern what really happened and that
[1:08:24] Mercy would be issued from a
[1:08:26] president instead of the judicial I
[1:08:28] thought oh dear lord listen this first
[1:08:31] used by George Washington then Andrew
[1:08:33] Johnson actually used it amen and
[1:08:35] pardoned Jefferson
[1:08:38] Davis when you say Jefferson Davis is a
[1:08:40] southerner you you're supposed to put
[1:08:42] your shoulders back a
[1:08:46] little you always see them in the room
[1:08:48] they kind of set
[1:08:49] up he was the president of the
[1:08:52] Confederate
[1:08:53] states and the president of America
[1:08:56] pardoned the president of the
[1:08:59] Rebellion to
[1:09:01] end the
[1:09:03] Rebellion it actually was used by both
[1:09:06] Andrew Johnson and President Lincoln
[1:09:09] that when they tried to stop the Civil
[1:09:11] War they begin to issue blanket pardons
[1:09:14] of all
[1:09:17] Rebels anybody that would come in and
[1:09:20] pledge allegiance to the flag could walk
[1:09:23] away with a pardon power
[1:09:27] it was a blanket am mean anybody any any
[1:09:30] Rebels anybody that's broken our laws
[1:09:33] come back in and say you're sorry and
[1:09:36] take the oath to this flag and you can
[1:09:39] be a citizen again oh I'll tell you
[1:09:42] somebody somebody you know this is this
[1:09:44] is big in news right now you know
[1:09:46] because president uh uh uh Trump yeah
[1:09:50] that's his
[1:09:51] name president Trump just pardoned man
[1:09:53] he pardoned a bunch of people yeah I
[1:09:56] think it was, 1600 of them got everybody
[1:09:58] mad except those
[1:10:02] people do you know that that this is the
[1:10:04] very thing that did that Ford did when
[1:10:06] he pardoned
[1:10:07] Nixon yeah when Ford pardoned Nixon it
[1:10:11] was it was basically the end of his
[1:10:12] political career because it was so
[1:10:14] unpopular what he was doing but he was
[1:10:17] trying to bring that man and Salvage
[1:10:20] him even before judgment struck him now
[1:10:24] now there's a there's an amazing case of
[1:10:26] these all these people that's been
[1:10:28] pardoned do you know there's one of them
[1:10:29] one of the women he pardoned said she
[1:10:30] didn't want
[1:10:32] it I mean she better been
[1:10:36] thinking she said I did the crime I've
[1:10:39] did the time I don't want no
[1:10:41] pardon I don't need your
[1:10:44] help so you know the thing is brother
[1:10:47] Brandon brings it up in the message and
[1:10:48] I don't know if you've ever studied it
[1:10:50] or not but he talks about Abraham
[1:10:52] Lincoln having pardoned somebody that
[1:10:54] actually died if capital
[1:10:56] punishment now I couldn't find that
[1:10:58] specific case but now Lincoln was
[1:11:01] pardoning a lot of people and there is
[1:11:04] hundreds of documents where it's just
[1:11:06] written I I I found a bunch of them
[1:11:08] online where the the pardon was written
[1:11:11] on just a little card and it said from
[1:11:13] the executive branch or something like
[1:11:14] that and it had just a little scribble
[1:11:16] and his his signature and that was a
[1:11:17] pardon they had them things all over the
[1:11:19] country during the Civil
[1:11:23] War but there actually is case that's
[1:11:26] still on the books right now it's
[1:11:27] actually predominant law it's United
[1:11:29] States versus Wilson and it was in 1833
[1:11:32] two men robbed a mail truck and somebody
[1:11:35] got hurt and they they judged them and
[1:11:37] it was during the time of Andrew Jackson
[1:11:39] one of the men was killed uh for his
[1:11:41] crimes and the other man uh Mr Wilson
[1:11:45] actually denied the pardon that Jackson
[1:11:48] gave
[1:11:49] him he actually said I won't want it and
[1:11:52] they went ahead and killed the man it's
[1:11:54] still in case of today Wilson refused
[1:11:57] the pardon and the Supreme Court was
[1:11:59] asked to rule upon it and the ruling
[1:12:01] still stands today it said the decision
[1:12:03] that the prisoner does not accept the
[1:12:05] pardon is not in effect a pardon this is
[1:12:08] this is direct quote from your Supreme
[1:12:10] Court a pardon is a deed to the validity
[1:12:13] of which delivery is essential and
[1:12:16] delivery is not complete without
[1:12:20] acceptance a pardon has to be
[1:12:24] delivered and it cannot only be brought
[1:12:27] it has to be
[1:12:28] received you see that's why when the
[1:12:31] message of the hour comes along brother
[1:12:32] bam meets that girl up there in Toledo
[1:12:35] and he comes back around there remember
[1:12:37] and he's judging her you heard it on tap
[1:12:39] ago and he's judging her and he said and
[1:12:41] the Lord I seen my sins going up and he
[1:12:43] said I seen somebody writing them all in
[1:12:45] a book he said and I said Lord is that
[1:12:48] my
[1:12:49] sins and he said I said Lord forgive me
[1:12:52] and he said he put his hand in his side
[1:12:54] and he wrote pardon across the book and
[1:12:56] threw it
[1:12:57] backwards and from there brother bam
[1:12:59] begin to preach on Romans 8th chapter he
[1:13:02] freely give us all things how much more
[1:13:05] has he gave
[1:13:06] us a
[1:13:09] pardon a pardon is a release from
[1:13:15] guilt can you see that man used
[1:13:18] it to stop the
[1:13:22] Rebellion man used it to stop the war
[1:13:26] and that's exactly what God used his
[1:13:29] pardon power
[1:13:31] for for we that were
[1:13:35] Rebels for we that were enemies unto God
[1:13:39] he put out a blanket pardon to whosoever
[1:13:42] will let him come to the Waters of Life
[1:13:44] freely and let him ask and let him drink
[1:13:47] Amen to whosoever can come amen there's
[1:13:49] a pardon laying there this morning even
[1:13:52] so much when the great power of judgment
[1:13:55] Begin to Fall upon the age you know I'm
[1:13:57] just going to I'm just going to ask you
[1:13:59] do you have that picture of the cloud
[1:14:00] brother Bram brings you you've seen that
[1:14:03] picture you've seen it hundreds of times
[1:14:05] and you looked at it every which
[1:14:09] way but in 1963 when that cloud came
[1:14:12] down there and had his picture taken
[1:14:15] somewhere there between Tucson and
[1:14:19] Flagstaff it's not something just to be
[1:14:22] made fun of or mimicked or somebody to
[1:14:26] act like that it wasn't something
[1:14:28] important but the prophet of God said it
[1:14:30] was our Lord up
[1:14:32] there and he said that white ring around
[1:14:35] his face you're looking at was the white
[1:14:38] was the seven angels of God forming his
[1:14:43] wig which told that he is the Supreme
[1:14:48] judge of Heaven and
[1:14:50] Earth The Sovereign one showed up in
[1:14:54] this this age right and you know what he
[1:14:57] did Brother Bram looked at that picture
[1:15:00] and he said but I want you in the middle
[1:15:02] of all of this great Revelation yeah he
[1:15:05] said but I want you to notice if you get
[1:15:06] a picture sometime look at it he said
[1:15:09] he's looking to the
[1:15:13] rightall where he on the cross
[1:15:17] pardoned The
[1:15:20] Sinner and here it is this morning being
[1:15:24] exercised
[1:15:27] listen the message has been
[1:15:30] delivered the pardon has came but it's
[1:15:33] not complete till it's
[1:15:39] received you might want to get down
[1:15:41] there this
[1:15:43] morning if our musicians would come you
[1:15:45] might want to you might want to take
[1:15:47] out your old pardon paper and look it
[1:15:51] over
[1:15:52] again somebody said brother Wayne what's
[1:15:54] our pardon brother R said John
[1:15:57] 3:16 he said that was your pardon he
[1:15:59] said because watch the next verse he
[1:16:01] that believeth not is
[1:16:03] condemned
[1:16:08] already therefore being
[1:16:11] justified by
[1:16:13] faith brother John where did you get
[1:16:16] your
[1:16:18] faith so well brother Wayne you know I
[1:16:21] just believe God there's you know I I've
[1:16:24] did all this and I've worked all this
[1:16:26] and I've just did this do you know your
[1:16:28] Bible says in John
[1:16:29] 6 that no man cometh unto
[1:16:34] me unless I first draw
[1:16:41] him it would be amazing if you look up
[1:16:44] that word in the Greek
[1:16:46] draw because you can use it a bunch of
[1:16:49] different ways in the English but in the
[1:16:51] Greek it literally
[1:16:53] means to be drug
[1:16:56] off it don't mean to draw it means to
[1:17:00] drag it means that God came
[1:17:04] down and by an inward work of Grace in
[1:17:06] your life made you believe
[1:17:09] something had you believe something gave
[1:17:11] you the grace to believe
[1:17:13] something that would take you out of
[1:17:15] every bit of the situations you're in
[1:17:18] you talk about the grace of
[1:17:21] God a special kind of Grace
[1:17:25] a special kind of Grace I wonder this
[1:17:27] morning you you you you say preacher
[1:17:30] what are you getting at well look at the
[1:17:32] grace of God look at the pardons that he
[1:17:34] gave down Through the
[1:17:35] Ages but the one took the cake for me
[1:17:38] was that President
[1:17:41] Biden just minutes left in his in his
[1:17:46] term and he starts passing out what they
[1:17:49] call preemptive pardons
[1:17:57] yes you mean these folks ain't even been
[1:17:59] charged
[1:18:01] yet and you're going to Pardon
[1:18:08] them if that's true in the negative
[1:18:12] realm you got to think about what God
[1:18:15] has done for
[1:18:16] you there is a preemptive pardon over
[1:18:19] your
[1:18:20] life and he's told the devil no matter
[1:18:23] what you dig up on them
[1:18:25] no matter what you charge them for no
[1:18:28] matter the dirt you get no matter how
[1:18:29] much you focus on them I have
[1:18:32] preemptively pardon them and there's
[1:18:34] nothing you can do with
[1:18:36] them tell that devil this morning I am
[1:18:40] justified by my faith I believe it I
[1:18:44] receive it it's a pardon power stand to
[1:18:47] your feet with me this
[1:18:50] morning you preemptively pardoned you
[1:18:58] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank
[1:19:02] you
