Branson Missouri with the Saints and uh amen it's a been something we've been doing for years I think uh we figured out brother Andrew Glover myself and Bethany was the only uh people there that had been there all the 10 years that we've done Bible Conference through the years and uh and uh but it was a tremendous time and fellowship and felt like it was a a benefit to the area and amen and our our heart was to be able to further the kingdom of God and amen to u to lift the message in the heart of the people amen it was certainly good to be there and be fellowship with him and amen but it's it's real good to be home amen and uh we certainly appreciated the services at home and amen and uh so we we we want to just say God bless you this evening and uh we have a few things on our heart tonight and amen just before we get into the work we just bow our hearts for just a moment and let's just speak to the Lord father we thank you today for your grace Lord upon your word and Lord just sitting and and looking over these things today Lord how it puts a burden in our heart for your children and for the times that we live Lord and the needs that are among us and God have we need you how we need you to move Among Us Lord how we realize that it's so far beyond human ability Lord that without you lord it would just be all in vain but we invite you tonight Lord as your Prophet said that you would come with your invited and tonight Lord we just invite you we invite you into this meeting we invite you Lord into the platform yes Lord we ask you would direct the word Lord tonight you would speak to the need of your people oh God now father we're committing this service into your faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen and amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight let's go to the book of Ephesians the first chapter amen like to welcome the visitors tonight amen certainly good to have you with us amen Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 13 uh we've been working on this book of Ephesians some and I I I'm not going to I'm going to continue in it I may not continue every service consecutively in it and but uh but it's it's uh this next few verses are pretty heavy on my heart and I just want to if I can give some time to it uh Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise now let's turn to the book of Acts the 19th Chapter and I'd like to read the first six verses of Acts 19 and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto them what were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism and then said Paul John verily baptized with a baptism of repentant saying unto the people they should believe on him who which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated uh this these two scriptures are are very powerful in Reading Ephesians in the first chapter here and reading the 13th verse and then reading the book of Acts it kind of gives you a little bit of an idea because Paul was passing through Ephesus and uh it's a it's a pretty amazing Point here brother brandom speaks on this specific scripture a number of times all the way throughout his ministry being that he was dealing with a lot of Baptist early in his ministry being a Baptist himself he said that's where the Baptist actually had missed the truth was on this scripture and um and uh I want to read something to you out of the the church AG book I'm going to be speaking tonight from this uh Ephesians 1:13 and uh but I want to read this from uh the church age book and I just love some times you you get uh you get different things like maybe one thing said this way and one thing said another way and you can read brother brandom and he kind of almost sometimes like he makes it sound one way or another but then there's times where he will just concentrate the thought and then he'll just teach it very directly and then and then it kind what it does is it ties the loose ends together it ties like all the quotes together it ties the scripture together and then it leaves you with a solid understanding of the subject itself and in the church age book brother Ram's going to handle this and he says something and I just want to read a few phrases of it to you and brother R said he said now here's the thing he said I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is the one and the same now I realized that this is going to be confusing for a moment and most people know that I was ordained Baptist preacher and I steadfastly declared that the Baptist had missed it for saying you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe amen now I don't want to be negative but I think we got some Baptist in the message these days uh that if you just believe the prophet then you got it but brother Braham is saying that's where you missed it actually he said see that's not so he said have you received him sensu in Acts 19 and2 and then brother brandom uh uh reads the scripture here and he said there it is see Paul asked have you received since not when you believe but after uh there there is a great difference here for it is after we believe that we received and Ephesians 1 and13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in Ephesus according to Acts 19 so I don't know if I ever really noticed him saying it that way but in Ephesians 1 and 13 is exactly a word repeat of what happened in Acts 19 in whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed not when you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise now here is my point too many of our modernists and even fundamentalists so-called believe under salvation as a surf a certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again now to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be born again see to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost Now isn't that something to receive his spirit is to be born again which means to be baptized with the Holy Ghost now these folks that is wonderful but they stop there see you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe it's always been that way and it always will be that way of course uh Peter will tell us in the book of Acts that we should repent and be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now brother B says see here's the thing Peter or none of the Apostles ever said be born again and then be filled with the spirit he said that that this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving the Holy Spirit note carefully the very next time the spirit fell upon the people let's read this together acts chap 5 and let's uh acts chap 8: 5 to 17 and this is a very good reading for the point we're we're looking at here um Acts chapter I didn't put that in there sorry acts chap 8 verse 5-1 17 then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto the things which Philip had spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did now for the unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with uh pusies and they were lame and they were healed now they were with great joy in the city but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people to Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom all PA had gave heed for the least of the greatest saying this man is the great power of God now to him that had regard because that a long time he had Bewitched them with his sorceries but when they had believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women now Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philli and wandered beholding the Miracles and the signs which were done now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John in whom they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost now these people had been baptized but they had never received received the Holy Ghost for as yet it was he was Fallen upon none of them and only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus the next verse and that and then land they they laid their hands upon them and they received the Holy Ghost now here are the prophets making the point that when they were believed and they were baptized but not yet having received the Holy Ghost now according to this he said they believe the word then they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and in spite of that they had still not received the Holy Spirit it was only after believing and being baptized correctly that they receive the holy ghost that is the exact pattern set forth in Acts the 2 chapter now what we find out then is that brother brother bam is telling us that we have to be understand this to be clear that Paul never you you never ever found Paul at any time saying be born again and then be Spirit fi they they have inferred that it is there and they have put their own meaning to make it say that but scriptures does not say that but scriptures does not say that amen if you go to uh Joel chapter two it says he would pour out his Spirit The Book of Matthew Jesus said he that receiveth me shall be like rivers of ring water flowing out of him and and the prophet of God said see amen what it is is it that the rivers and the waters were the same spirit amen it wasn't two distinct two different things it's the same thing do you see that that this places the experience at Pentecost what gives the power to the church is not just believing the word but it was the experience of Pentecost amen and you got many people say well brother Wayne We Believe amen a lot of people believe but but you have to be careful with that because then a prophet would say this he would say the devil believes and trembles amen but the devil ain't saved and the devil haven't received the Holy Ghost amen but as the Church of the Living God not only are we to believe but we're to believe unto but we are to go on and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is when we can say we have been born again because we receive of his life it is the spirit that gives life and power and it came at Pentecost I'm directly saying amen it is the spirit that gave life and Power and it came at Pentecost now what has caused this misunderstanding this is a powerful quote what has caused this understanding and the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word now there's a lot of people that'll take this specific quote and they'll say see then you can't go by your experience you got to go by the word but if you go on and read the quote and you don't just quote that portion but you read the quote brother brandom is actually saying the opposite he's saying you've used your experience as a measuring line saying basically that we have been baptized and we have believed and that's enough he said but see the word of God has never taught you that the word didn't teach that to you your experience may have taught you that your church may have taught you that a theologian may have taught you that but the scriptures never taught a person that the scriptures are declaring unless a man is baptized with the Holy Ghost he does not have eternal life it takes an experience with God Amen to have the Holy Ghost amen the prophet of God said we have gone by experience and not the word we need to get back to the word what does the word teach a man needs to go in the Rapture he needs the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost is a confirmation of your faith in the word of God Amen brother Ram said away with experience as a measuring line there was only one Plum line there's only one rod and that is the word amen it's the word it's the word that says a man must repent and be baptized Amen in in the name of Jesus Christ remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed now that was the question he was asking amen a lot of people has believed but have you received the Holy Ghost sent you believe listen I I want to say this tonight amen what we need in the church Church of the Living God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it it it gives power to the believer it's what strengthens you and gives you something that is sustaining and gives you a rest now brother BR says it like this he said the whole of our problem is right here the whole of the problem the same quote the whole of the problem is people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto receiveing the spirit believe Believing on Jesus is a step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost but people stop there they go as far as the water then they stop they believe then they stop but the Bible does not say that you receive when you believe have you received the Holy Ghost s you believe that's the exact literal translation did you previously believing receive the have you received the Holy Ghost people believe and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having been repented now that's what's wrong with the fundamentalist is they say well we believed it so we've got everything we need when we believe but brother R said that's not true at all amen because it still leaves you wide open amen now I I'll say this something to you tonight amen it leaves you wide open somebody asked brother bam they said brother bam do we need a definite experience with the Holy Ghost here's his answer that's a good question and the baptism of the holy spirit is a definite experience that person must receive amen every person must have their experience with God all of our experiences are going to be different amen but we must have a place where we have met God and we know that we have met God his Spirit has ignited our lives amen because it is the spirit of God that is the Seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's him that seals our life now I'll say let me reread this from Ephesians chapter 1 he said in whom also we trusted after that we've heard the word of Truth The Gospel of Salvation whom after that you have believed you were sealed somebody say sealed se you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise and watch uh uh uh and we what we know the holy spirit is a promise but we also know that it's a seal now let me just read something here brother bam says seal something or excuse me the definition of seal is something that confirms ratifies make secure it is a guarantee or an assurance yes amen one of the definitions it's a device with a cut or raised emblem you've all seen this amen or a word specifically to certify a signature an authenticate a document a medallion a ring face bearing such a device amen a piece of wax a wafer something to make an impression you've all received the uh the wedding invitations that's been sealed and or sometimes you get something that's got wax sealed in the old days they sent messages they put seals on them and then they uh uh stamped them with their hot wax with a certain seal in their in their signant ring and what it was doing it's an impression or a device it's a mark amen uh uh that uh of course that is given or is recognized and one of the definitions it's an or mental adhesive stamp that may be used to close a letter or a package in in other words uh it's something that secures it could be a wax seal on a document uh it could be a closure that must be broken to be open thus reveals tampering like uh like a seal on a on a window or a seal on the door and you put a piece of tape there and back in back in the days years ago I remember as a kid you go out on your on your uh electric meter out on your house and there was always this little wire thing with this tab on it and it said the electric company's name and what it was is it was a seal on that meter cuz they didn't want nobody fooling with it so they put that seal on it and it belonged to them keep you from tampering with it or they would know and another way of saying a seal is like uh something like the windows last night we was actually talking about it last night the windows in your house can they they have a double pain but there's gas in the middle and if something happens and it breaks the seal then the gas gets out of it so so it's something that seals in amen anybody that use an old old water pump anybody ever use one of them an old pump house water pump and down we used to have one down in town there where I lived as a kid and we'd go down there it had an old leak and seal on it you know and and what it do is it never keep a prime you know every time you went down there you you everybody if the guy before you didn't leave a cup of water you were in trouble amen but but usually everybody knew when you get done last thing you do is fill the pil up and set it back cu the next guy comes along is going to have to prime the pump because the seals are are are bad on them old pump houses amen so so it was a leaking seal anybody ever canned any any fruit or they ever canned any beans they you got to you got to put put the you got to cook it all and set them cans in in something and as they start cooling you and set in a night and you've all heard it and a pop and it'll start popping and and what's happening is the seals sitting on the on the canned goods for the preservation amen and we all understand seals and and we know uh government seals and we know uh all kinds of seals but we have to ask ourselves what is the Seal of God Amen okay now now to to there's many people and you think this would be a great simple subject but many people have used uh uh many directions to say a lot of things some well you know well if a person's coming to church all the time that's the seal uh maybe a person pays plenty in offerings and they're kind to the preacher and they they come up and shook they they dress pretty good and they got pretty good attitude well then that's a seal you see amen there's a lot of different ideas of what seals are or in other words what God's approval is but brother B says but you got to recognize that the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's the only thing God's going to recognize is that Holy Ghost in the in at Thy word 1951 brother bam says it like this he said there's only going to be two classes in the last days right there's going to be them that are marked by the Beast and them that are sealed of God now the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the mark of the beast is to deny the Holy Ghost now friends amen I I know people say well the Holy Ghost is something you can leave or take but it's not amen we are out of time there is no leave or take in this generation it's either you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost where God seals you into his word or you deny the Holy Ghost and the devil seals you from hearing the truth of the word amen the mark of the beast is to turn down the Holy Ghost so when the Holy Ghost comes to your life it's up to you whether you're going to receive it or not because as a church we re receive the Holy Ghost right amen as a as our leadership and our our officers and our people as a whole we receive the Holy Ghost we've opened the doors up and we've asked him come on in here Lord and receive it but every individual within the sanctuary has to receive their own experience with God where they are sealed by God for Ephesians 4:30 now we're going to jump ahead and and and we'll get into it later but Ephesians 40 4:30 says that we should not grieve the holy spirit of God whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption now here's the thing the Seal of God is the Holy Ghost and when a man receives the Seal of God we have to last how long does that last now the prophet said it would last until the day of redemption when you are redeemed to be with God now how long does the Holy Spirit seal you not from revival to Revival but from eternity to Eternity you are sealed by the Holy Spirit that's what the holy H spirit is it is a seal of God he has found you have found Grace in his sight and he loves you and he believes you and he has set his seal upon you I tell you when you ever see that the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God you will see the importance of the Holy Ghost you see the necessity of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not something to laugh at make fun of ridicule talk about blackmail it's not something to say a those Pentecostals all those em of people it it amen it's not something to talk about it's not something to ridicule it's something to set in the highest place in the church and say this is the achievement that we want every child every man every person in this building we want to pray with you we want to preach to you we want to help you we'll hold your hand we'll we'll do whatever we need to do to be sure that every individual in this place receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is essential unto you it is necessary for your life it's not something to read about and set aside you have to have the Holy Ghost there is a huge difference between a Believer and somebody who has received the Holy Ghost amen the prophet of God tells us this he tells us and what is the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the Seal of God's approval in other words he says watch when when a man gets ready uh uh to pack up a a train y'all have heard brother bam talk about it and he said if it's to ship a train off he said somebody Stacks that train car full and packs it up and then seals it he said but now the inspector putting those things in there he says he has to make sure they're in their right place before he seals that car otherwise it'll come apart on the journey amen because whoever it is you know maybe you're maybe you're here at the train depot in ly they're and they're stacking a bunch of Munitions and they they got everything just the way they want and them babies has got to go all the way to Los Angeles California well the Rocky Mountains is between here and there amen there's all kinds of of changes and there's Crossroads and there's uh bumps and there's all kinds of things that's going to happen Train's going to rock maybe they got to make emergency step and the guy that's responsible to see that is from here to there is the guy that shuts the door on it and the Holy Spirit is the inspectors of our life to see that we have everything in us that we need for the journey ahead of us listen when God seals a Believer with the Holy Ghost he is saying that you have what it takes to go into the Rapture that's in our future now I do say this that some people don't get sealed with the spirit brother B said the reason they don't he said because they're living too loose he said see there's too many loose things in the house now we might as well just go ahead and preach hav't we some people don't receive the Seal of God because they meant maybe they still got their temper brother B said they're too loose with it they just Li off at the handle some people have never been able to train their mouth they just just talk anyway say anything talk about backbite bitterness in their heart jealousy malice how could God seal that right amen so that has to be corrected and then ask the Holy Spirit to seal that life are we are we are we there I don't I don't want to preach condemnation I just want to show you that the Holy Spirit seals you unto the day of redemption when he shuts the door and sets the seal on it he is saying that this thing is going to make it to the other end because there's a lot's going to happen but I just love to know tonight that when the Seal of God is set on the life that that seal is good for time out of the way to Eternity other words amen that somewhere down the road somebody's not going to stop that train and try to figure out if they can go on the rest of the way when God seals your life you may go through a lot of rough patches between here and there amen but if you got a seal on you amen there ain't nobody can tamper with that seal amen you're good to go Amen in other words it's a place you can rest why I think the Church of the Living God that's been sealed with a holy ghost are to know something that when God has set that seal upon you amen Amen Let me let me just say this very clearly dare not anybody touch that seal the prophet of God said dare not not anybody to touch that seal until it's reached its destination he said there it is touch not my anointed and do my profits no harm when God seals your life up brother let me say this the devil ain't got no business with you no more amen when the devil can't touch that life no more amen now we we're not getting into a we're not don't don't don't don't get into the negative now amen you said well Wayne I had this problem and I had this you you think maybe I don't have the Holy Ghost well sometimes you don't some people don't have the Holy Ghost I get that amen and we're not up here amen if the holy spirit's telling you you need the Holy Ghost we're not here Amen to tell you you don't have it if you don't have it because if you don't know you got it why not go on and get an assurance that you do got it but when you get it drive down your steak and quit asking about it anymore and hold on to that till you get to the end of the line amen I don't believe I don't believe we ought to break that seal ourself do you amen if God's put it on us we are to Rejoice all the way knowing we're on our way going amen because God has given it there now touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm I love that amen I love it that God can give a man the Holy Ghost and then he can turn around and look at somebody and tell that devil keep your hands off of this isn't that powerful keep your hands off of this this belongs to me I've set my seal upon it amen I love when God draws a line and tells that devil this belongs to me you know what the prophet of God said he said this seal Came Upon them that were forn of God he said he did not come to seal somebody else's children he said he didn't die and send the Holy Ghost and then H somebody might get it he already knew every believer that would receive the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God has come to seal the forn of God to get them to the destination that they need to go to listen you can't trust your human nature can you no sir that's why we needed the Holy Spirit to seal his spirit in us to protect us from our own nature if you can EQ this thing it's the base is a little bit heavy in it amen uh you see the prophet of God said this an unpardonable sin he said the devil looks upon that seal and he can't come to it he can tease at it he can Buzz at it he can fuss at it but he can't get to it amen he can't get it because there's a seal of God that forbids him Hallelujah forbids him to touch it that's God's private property Hallelujah yes sir that's what makes a man walk boldly they're not scared of backsliding they're not scared of what the devil has to say Amen you know your God's Property you know the Seal of God upon your life is a do not disturb sign to the devil you know it's a get off of my property signed to the devil the Seal of God Amen is recognized whether the devil likes it or not he can Buzz around you he can tempt at you he can argue at you but he'll never get to the soul because the soul is sealed by almighty God a you don't you love it amen the body might get sick but the seal is on the soul amen the spirit might get tempted but there's a seal that's on the soul come on Church you know what I'm talking about because then some people preach the baptism of the spirit as a as a uh can I can I preach to you amen the baptism of the spirit is perfect sinlessness in other words a a perfect Perfection amen and and it's always got some guy who's always the measure and stick to that right amen then you got to go to them every week and figure out whether you got it or don't got it and according to how they feel so they approve and disapprove after a while you become their little minion you know you got to seek their approval what listen you don't need my approval you don't need the church's approval if you you got God's approval you can go in the you can go in the Rapture come on Church we're not looking for handshakes with the preacher we're looking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost to ass sure believer I belong to God I'm going in a Rapture and there's not enough devils in hell to break the seal that God has set upon my life amen listen to me you don't have to live an insecure life you are a Believer with the Holy Ghost and you're ready for the Rapture because God has set his own approval over you listen I I know how it is I know what man leadership's like and you if you watching a man and one day he likes you your spirit's up here next day he don't like you your spirit's down here and your whole life is according to how somebody feels about you well if you ever get that seal of God down on the inside the whole world can turn against you but brother you got joy on the inside your heart is happy because you know God has accepted you I have been accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah yes sir you see what it is when God sets that seal on you you are dead and your life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost how could that devil get to you how could that devil get to you I know what brother Bram said he said he can't get to you without being baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost he said you're in a place he can't get to Hallelujah this old body might be in a place where he can punch it and this old Spirit might be in a place and he can get to once in a while and he can trouble your spirit amen but there's a soul down there there's a real believer down there and in the midst of everything he'll step out on the bow of the ship and say peace be still fear not it is high there somebody in control of the ship tonight amen when the Holy Ghost is the one in the tower and a keep in the castle and the castle won't fall my when you study old that old history lessons you get to studying it and you find out that that's what they always want to conquer right is the keep in the castle well let me tell you our King the Lord Jesus Christ amen they killed him in the body that was a dumb mistake they killed him in the body cuz he could only be king to a certain amount of people why he was on the Earth but when he become immortal he could become the king of all the nations of the earth and he can live in the heart of the believer tonight and there's a king in this heart ruling over this Kingdom it's the Lord Jesus Christ and there's no devil can overcome it amen oh Church you are dead and how's that devil going to get in there now the beautiful thing is we've got scriptures and we have examples in the scriptures of great and perilous times with judgments have struck you go to the Book of Exodus and you uh you can watch the Ten Commandments it gives you a little hint of it you can listen to the Token brother bam talks a lot about it um I I don't know I don't think I have the ability uh to pull you into the Judgment scene that was there on that per first Passover when God was executing judgment Against The Gods of Egypt now he was mad because they had kept his firstborn and his wrath was falling upon and judging Egypt and their gods now there was 10 different plagues right there were 10 major deities that were in Egypt and God was overcoming each one of those the like the god of the Nile and he was supremely overcoming it his wrath was coming upon those Nations but in the middle of that wrath he had children that he was calling his firstborn child and he had to have a way to mark them and tell the difference amen between the children of Israel and the children of Egypt there had to be a way for God to set a mark upon them to say this one's mine go around this house in the time of judgment don't touch this one this one belongs to me now how did they know how did how did the death angel know which house to go in and which house to not because it fell over all of all of Egypt amen the the the death angel was going into Egypt and to Goa was going to ever house but Moses had been among them a prophet and had said what you do is you know you go you know the laws of the Passover but let me just make a short one here what you do is you put the blood over it right you put the blood over the doorpost over the mantle of of the door and and brother B said there it was he said the blood on the door and the lamb inside now y'all y'all y'all can go with me real quickly because you can't see the Corporal body at the time of the SE of God the Corporal body is hid from view the Lord Jesus's body is not the lamb you can't see it right now but you can see the display of the token which is the literal life so what what the token is is not the Corporal body that literal life is the token the blood the baptism of the the Seal of God it was a resemblance of what Moses saw coming and Moses had him put in natural blood on the door because he was saying to them this is the only way to escape escape the death that's coming now the prophet when he picks this up he comes in there and he takes a little boy who's the first born and it would matter being the first born because you're the one under judgment and and the prophet said watch he's standing there and he says to his father what's the wind blowing out there that's not the normal wind and brother Bram says it was The Winds of judgment and the Death Angel was coming down the streets and this young man was unsettled knowing that people were dying all around him him judgment was literally setting in and and he said to his father Heen are you sure that blood's going to work but see a Vindicated Prophet had told him this is what will make the difference I hope you're hearing me amen you know maybe maybe uh maybe Pastor uh Pastor Benjamin down the street down there said well don't listen to that old Moses and put that blood on your door that it's not really necessary you guys believe the Covenant don't you and we're the Abraham seed and y'all believe y'all believe the Covenant God made with Abra y'all believe all that don't you oh yeah yeah well don't you worry about that old messy uh uh fanaticism of that blood all over your door like that that guy's just lost his mind you see but it didn't matter what anybody else said it still wouldn't keep it out yeah now well I I I can be real just real open here just for a moment with you but one time I heard a young guy preaching he's preaching his Pastor you know he's and I I have to be honest I love our church but but I don't want our brothers going on the field and preaching true word to the people preach the message I don't want our young brother our our evangelists and our brothers going out and I mean they need to represent us well I believe that don't y'all but the best representation of this of this church is preach the message CU that's what we're not preaching our own Ministries or building our own light we're preaching this message for the people right and and I heard a guy's preaching this pastor and he's wanting everybody to get under his pastor and and his Pastor was wrong in some areas and and the guy was saying well you know just believe the pastor even if he's wrong God will hold him accountable not you and I thought to myself we're in the world what Catholic dogma did you get that out of that's not in the Bible sir you don't believe a preacher when he teaches different in this message I don't care if it's me if I say something different brother random forget what I said amen if a prophet said it would take the Holy Ghost to tell the difference between the foolish virgin and the wise virgin it will be the holy ghost that tells the difference and somebody say well we understand all the Mysteries and all the seals and he said though you understand all Mysteries and have not charity which is the catstone which is the token of the Holy Ghost unless you have the life of the Holy Ghost you a go in the Rapture it don't matter what anybody says 10 points of living a better life amen it won't be better in a little while Amen brother amen every man has to come subject to this Prophet brother BR even went so far to say this he said they could have took them out back and showed them they were circumcised Jews he said but L they had that blood on the door it didn't matter come on Amen and the literal life of this word that is coming to this age is not just the Pentecostal isusa Street Revival it is the fullness of the word it is the son of man that has come into the fullness of the Holy Ghost which brought the word and the spirit into our lives this is back to the original Pentecost right on Amen now I know people when you preach on experiencing things they use the quotes brother ra talk about Pentecost and they try to say well we're not don't believe in that but but brother man's talking about 1906 he's not talking about he's not talking about the acts the book of Acts but actually brother Bram doeses say that if the branch ever puts forth another limb it will be a continuation of the book of Acts and every person must have an upper room experience with God there is a seal that he sets upon a life it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's the only thing that'll keep the devil out of that heart brother Bram says he said watch that boy's asking his father are you sure brother B said he said the blood was there uh years ago they used to sing a song maybe somebody look it up and sing it for me sometime I love it they said the winds and the rain but the blood is still there you know the blood is I think Kevin Spencer sang it amen the blood is still there amen and and that's that's the reality is Moses had told them what would make the difference am now wouldn't that be simple if we just heard what Moses said about it and if brother B says the only difference in between the fundamental Church who is the foolish virgin and the wise virgin is the baptism of the spirit my goodness then the Holy Ghost is going to be there now watch it's the only thing that's going to tell the difference now in so so we're talking about seal right so when you go to the Book of Exodus and you watch the 12th chapter that blood on the doorpost was a seal it sealed the believer in safety and it sealed the wrath of God on the outside it worked in Exodus the 12th chapter proves that God's seal no matter how silly to man God recognized the seal on the door and it worked you might have been able to see the light you might if you was stand in the street and looked into their home you probably could have seen the light from the candles and the fire where they were cooking the lamb you could have seen through the cracks and everything else so that blood ain't going to keep nothing out of that house but the prophet said it would and because it was God's word God saw it honored it and it worked see there's a seal go into the message of the Ark and brother B talks about when Noah is getting ready to launch into the Judgment Waters that was coming upon the Earth God instructed Moses uh Noah and told him to build an ark right and take gopherwood brother B said they laughed him to scorn over the gopherwood because it was such a porest it was such a porest board it would have been the last thing somebody would used to build a ship he said but God knew what he was doing because he told him to pitch it in and out see the gopher wood wouldn't be the seal the pitch would be the seal the gopherwood represents Humanity you can soak anything in take a take one of you guys and go in a room amen and set set you in a room with a certain group of people next thing you know you nod your head just same way talk same way now reason I know that I got a lot of Indian friends and I spend a lot of time in India and let one of them guys call me on the phone Crystal say what Indian brother you talking to cuz you it's just Humanity you you you you're able to pick up and and you talk like somebody or you take an action so it's Humanity but see the human being has no no ability to seal out things the human nature soaks in things and the gopherwood soaked in things so the gopherwood wouldn't be the seal the seal would be the pitch now the prophet teaches us something if you go into history it's more powerful and I it needs more time than I'm going to put on it but I want to just make the point but but but what they where they got the seal from Elijah is powerful because they got it from an evergreen tree yeah amen tree of life yeah Jesus was a tree a tree of Evergreen everlasting life and they would cut down the Evergreen and brother B said see it had to give up its life for them to be able to seal that boat so it gave up its life one tree for another the Evergreen for the gopherwood and they had to have something that could be applied to the gopherwood so when they cut it down brother BR said they took took the sap out of it but to get the sap they had to beat it and they had to basically misuse the wood to squeeze out because the seal for the for the ark was coming from the pressure on the Evergreen take its life take its life take the SAT from it after you kill it and then they would put it through a boiling process and make a tire out of it and then apply it isn't it amazing that it would take the life of an evergreen tree to seal the Ark in the days of Noah which was speaking of our Lord Jesus Christ who would have to give his life that he might seal Our lives our lives would sink in the waters of judgment today but there's been a life that has been given for our life and the Holy Ghost has been given to seal our boat oh I'm so glad that there was somebody pitched this inside and out now that word pitch and you've heard me preach on it but if you've never been here getting into it but that word pitch actually is a is a Hebrew word Cofer which actually means atonement that pitch was the atonement what it done is it kept judgment on one side and it kept the believer on the other side all that was Judgment of course in the days of Noah everything died in the earth except what was behind that pitch anything behind that tire never hit the judgment of God they were saved from judgment amen because they were behind the pitch listen that's telling us God has a seal you see it in Exodus 12 God had a seal but it was blood God had a seal in the days of Noah it was pitch point being God seal works whatever seal God provides it works and in the age we are living Paul said the Seal of God is the Holy Ghost and when a life is begin to be Sealed With God Amen it is sealed let me give you some scriptures Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption Bo I like that my goodness Brother Ray how long you had the Holy Ghost 68 since 68 so so come on mathematician 32 and 23 32 and 23 52 58 right I I'm I I cut numbers sorry give me the number2 52 years 55 years let's just say this we now are sure in this church the seal last at least 55 years amen so brother what are you talking I'm telling our young people you can get this seal today you don't have to wait till you're older thinking it's going to run out or it's going to get old amen it's kind of like you want to buy a new tractor you want to wait a while cuz they're going to run out on you but this seal you can get it when you're a child and it'll stay with you till you're old amen it'll it'll last you your whole life and it'll get you through every situation because the Seal of God is unto the day of redemption Ephesians 1:13 amen you are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise in 2 Corinthians 1 and 21 now he which shall establish you us with you in Christ hath anointed us is God who hath also sealed us amen and given us the earnest of his Spirit now I want you to I want you to watch something that's powerful because in the end time we know that there's great plagues coming upon the Earth right if you go into the scriptures and uh let's let's just go over in the scripture right quick and and watch the prophet say this we're going to go to Revelation 7 Revelations 9 brother man says the death angels and plagues were commissioned by God here's the thing commissioned by God don't come near any of those who has the seal in their forehead yeah the seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit see grieve not the Holy Spirit where about you're sealed into the day of redemption now matter how hard the ark rocked no matter how many times the lightning struck 10,000 shall fall on thy right and thousands to thy left it shall not come nigh theeen now the scripture tells us that the last plague that's going to fall is spiritual death let me read him he says it like this brother bam says the last plague that struck the Earth or struck Egypt was death Bible readers know that Sunday school lessons and so forth but death was The Last Enemy that struck Egypt and The Last Enemy that's going to strike the church now is death spiritually speaking yes sir those who will not follow Christ into the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will spiritually dry up and die let's go to Revelations the 9th chapter so brother way and I don't want to die get the Holy Ghost keep life in you Revelations 9 now watch this and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven who knows who that star was you go over to the next part of the verses and you'll find out that it was it was Lucifer and he was given to him the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the Bottom's pit and There Rose smoke out of the pit and the smoke a great furnace and the Sun and the air darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and they came out of their Locust upon the Earth and they were given power as scorpions upon the Earth have power and it was commanded them now watch that and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the Seal of God in their foreheads amen God commanded them yeah amen don't touch my oil touch not my oil or my wine when you read Revelations the 7th chapter watch in Revelation chapter 7 we'll read something very quick that's beautiful here first verse after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the the Living God and cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads now the prophet of God said you see there it is there's the first world war and y'all y'all in the history of the world the world has never went to war yeah the whole world never was fighting at the same time but in that in 19 was it 1914 the whole world went to war and millions were dying and and the Bible is telling us that destruction was going to take the Earth but there was this angel coming from the East that said hold the hold up guys you can't destroy this until I seal these see whatever that man had whatever he was going to do to that 144,000 was going to be so powerful that those angels was going to be able to let loose the judgments again but it wouldn't hurt the ones that had the seal upon their foreheads God's got a seal that you can stand in the greatest judgments and trials and situations and it will not come nigh thee it has been commanded of God that it cannot do it look at that first world war amen it stopped y'all know I'm telling you the truth it stopped on the 11th Hour of the 11th minute of the 11th day amen and and the whole world does not know why it stopped we know why it stopped because this angel said hold on stop hold on that's enough of this until I get the Seal of God upon their foreheads now y'all know amen that that's when Jesus said amen that you take a a Workman that comes into the field and there's been there's been 11 hours and and one hires at the first part of the day and he works all day day that's brother Ericson he's worked all day working 50 years in the field amen and and and God has gave him great payment amen but watch but at the last hour just before the Rapture a young man comes in and wants to work in the field Jesus is promising the same pay to the 11th Hour worker as he did the first hour worker amen so the people in the message if you started in the 60s don't get any more than the people that started last night it's all the same pain come on Amen see the day of Pentecost they got the Holy Ghost and 2,000 years later we're getting the same Holy Ghost they got it's not a different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost the same power the same anointing the same Miracle the same sign the same seal of God is coming upon the church isn't it beautiful that that happened in the early 1900s just before the Great Revival amen of the baptism of the spirit begin to catch and go across the the planet what is it amen somebody said well what are you talking about there's a there's a there Israel over there right now there's a war and God bless them boys we're praying for them that's that's a tough deal they're in right now amen but do you know what but the the message teaches us something Noah that there's 144,000 Jews God owes them three and a half days he owes him a half a week of Daniel's last 70th week but he can't start that time until that bride is out of the way and this bride can't get out of the way without taking a Rapture and there can't be a Rapture till that last one gets the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost comes upon that last part of the bride and Away she'll go brother and when she does those two witnesses will preach the same thing I'm preaching tonight listen I'm people think well they're going to preach this and they're going brother Bram said I'll tell you what they're going to preach go read Revelation 7 he said the Seal of God is the Holy Ghost there'll be two Jews over there preaching the Holy Ghost amen with signs and miracles following they'll shut up the heavens and they you you you see amen what is the Holy Ghost is going to them not just a bunch of learning and a bunch of teaching amen it won't just be them sitting and reading across things they're doing that right now but there's got to come a quick in of the spirit to understand that the Jesus of this Bible they have crucified him but he's not dead he rose again and he's alive in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's there to seal the people of God he's here to seal you tonight he's here to seal the Church of the Living God now if you if you like to read can we read one more scripture I'm running out of time I know but we'll we'll we'll hurry watch Ezekiel the 9th chapter read read them first four or five verses there and watch that Ezekiel 9 it's a powerful reading uh we'll have to come back but we got to read this tonight and he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which Li toward the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen oh God and with a Rider's ink horn by his side they went in and Stood Beside the braing altar there it is Judgment altar but look at that there was six men had weapons but one had an acorn oh I thank God for that one with that incor I thank God that there was one of them and behold six men came from the way watch this and one man among them was clothed with a linen and was a rider horn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen altar next verse and the glory of God of Israel was gone up from the church whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with the linen which had the Riders inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto them go through the midst of this city and through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon their foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for the Abominations that's done in the midst thereof isn't that beautiful Revelation 7 and4 Revelation Ezekiel 9 and4 look and the others he said in his hearing go after him through the city and smite and let not your eyes spare nothing neither ye have pity amen Slaughter utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come near any man upon who is the mark and begin at the sanctuary and then they began at the ancient men which were before the house now this is this is this is this is amazing they were going to slaughter everything there's a real Point here they're going to slaughter everything what the Bible said utterly babies children women men everything was going to be slaughtered but before the slaughter come that Rider with the inkhorn was going to go out in front of them and he was going to set a mark on certain ones of them and when those were slotting weapons begin to move in they were going to see that they going to see that Mark as a seal of God don't touch this one and don't touch that one and don't touch that one now I w't show you something brother mam said this he said do you see there even them little babies were going to have seals set upon them I said dear God if he's going to have to utterly destroy them then there must be an opportunity for them think about it tonight our young people sitting here I tell you what young people I just wept when I read that cuz I realize you don't have to be old for that right aorn to come by your Pew tonight he can come by our 10 year olds and our 8y olds and our seven year olds and set a mark upon them amen because judgments are coming but God set a mark upon our [Applause] children brother bam said that happened in Jerusalem and we all read the account we all got history books we read the account where Titus come in and killed everything but not one believer died in Jerusalem you know why because they had received the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost made them listen to the words of the Lord Jesus when you see the city can pass head for the hills don't come back and get your coat get out of here amen get out from these walls get out of these denominations get out of this Christ Denine Age come on church amen Jesus told them they don't want the Holy Ghost in Jerusalem so they're going to die that Jerusalem represented the denominational churches in the end time and they don't want the Holy Ghost they put him on the outside but by the grace of God that ecorn Rider would come by the church and he would set a mark upon his people in the last days it's not just Jerusalem that's going to get destroyed it's the whole world now somebody might say to me tonight said brother Wayne hey man I don't think this has any connection brother BR says if you want to see whether my message is connected or not the very hour Israel signed that agreement that angel appeared unto me he said the same Angel is on the earth now Milling around Hallelujah you say judgment's coming I say there's an anchorn Rider right in front of it I say that same man that was in Ezekiel 9 is walking through the a of True Word Tabernacle tonight judgment's coming but the Seal of God is here tonight that same one that marked them in that day brother let me tell you what I done I got in a private place in my office and I said oh man and who have that Mark we welcome you in true Earth Tabernacle we ask you to walk down every aisle we ask you to visit every home come to every child and set a mark upon them Father I invited him personally and the prophet of God said whoever would invite him he'll come where you're at it don't matter the building we don't have to have no great big building stained glass amen if God gives us one we'll enjoy it but it don't take it for God to come it don't take a a great preacher it don't take great singing it takes a humble heart that believes almighty God and he'll come where he's invited he said come unto me all ye weak and heavy later than I will set a mark upon you that the devil can't get to you brother Wayne who is that man I'll tell you what brother Braham said he said he's the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Oh Sister Lisa it come into my heart there's a man here yeah greater than Solomon is hereen Brian sent me a quote the other day I loved it he said John looked around he said and Jesus was standing there and he said John said it like this there's a man here he's here now whom you know not but brother Bram said but I can't say it that way today he said I have to say there's a man here who you see not there's one here tonight you don't see him but he's here that same that same one that Mark them in Ezekiel 9 is right here in this building tonight that same one that told him to put that blood over that door in Exodus is right here tonight that same protector that stood by the by the by the ark when Noah had pitched it according to the word that kept it floating in all the times of judgment that same one is here tonight the same one that guided Moses's little basket down the river he sealed it up so the alligators couldn't get to him because God had purpose that same sealer is in this building tonight and you can receive it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to learn a list of Creeds you don't have to learn a list of dos and don'ts and how can I what can I it's not what not to do it's what can I do repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus for the remission of sins and you shall receive the seal said brother when I got the Holy Ghost then you ought to be shouting like none other if you got the Holy Ghost tonight you ought to be telling that devil get out of Dodge buddy you can't have my joy you can't have my peace you can't have my amen you can't take it away from me I'm not going to live nervous I'm behind the seal I know the war is Raging but I'm behind the seal God's seal is upon me I'm not wearing a church seal I'm not wearing the Seal of a favorite preacher the seal we're wearing tonight Heaven recognizes it hell recognizes it judgment recognize it it's the Seal of God Jew Greek Bond free Rich poor come on Church you ain't got to be anything more than what God called you to be so brother Wayne if I was a little older you don't have to be older right I about had Revival brother Levi when I read that and it said he would utterly destroy the young and brother Brown just later says it he said so God is even going to seal the young ones that's what he's doing brother R that's what this young Revival is about my even our young my but carot does something to me but gent it takes the responsibility off of us puts it on him I ain't got to stay up late night and wonder what's going to happen to our young people if something happens they're his responsibility oh I'm going to pray for him but he's there they're his responsibility amen I think I could say it tonight with every parent sitting in here devil take your hands off of our young people [Applause] right ain't got not one right with you not none amen Lon devil that's right he's a roaring lion right as a roaring line can our musicians come tonight thank you Lord Jesus that that man is here amen amen you you you say to him tonight so brother Wayne what does it what does it really require what CRI is are experience with God see here's the thing a human life ain't sealed without the Holy Spirit and you can you can sit and watch people and you you you can see what I'm saying you you can see people who were pretty good people and they come around the church a little bit and then they got out in the world yeah and you watch them and you just see the tragedy and you see how far they go and what and you think well they really used to believe and then they're not believeing and and it's it's it's a it's a it's a it's a story over and over and over and over and see what it is is you can live a decent life in the right atmosphere but if there's no seal you could do anything and you can get mad at those people and say well they should and this this this but listen except for the grace of God except he except God have been merciful to you you can't hold yourself you can't just make up your mind somebody they get out here and get to become dope addicts and things and I've heard people man they get rough on me and I understand it's it's a dumb way to go with life but do you think they like do you think a person actually sat down and said oh boy I'm going to be a drug addict that's what I'm going to do with my life I'm going to I'm just going to become filthy and I'm going to become a drug addict and I'm going to lose all my money and I'm going to steal from my parents and I'm going to they didn't start like that they were just like you and the Holy Spirit Come by them and they turned it down and they thought I can do it without him but you can't you can't do it without him amen amen you said brother Wayne does that require like like hours at an altar and and now we'll get into exact theology scriptural some of these people were baptized repented believing and had never received the Holy Ghost Paul laid his hands on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied and received the Holy Ghost some of them Peter preached to them and while he was preaching the Holy Spirit entered their heart by the word and they said that's exactly what I need I receive that Lord Jesus and the Holy Ghost filled them and some of them they stood in a crowd on the day of Pentecost and said what must we do but they they all had an experience with a living God and he sealed their lives you don't never read about Peter denying the Lord again you never read about Paul going back into drugs and alcohol and he was sealed and a keeper was upon his life right so you're sitting here tonight you say well brother way you know I want to I want to have that in my life just receive himen don't turn him down don't look around and see someone under the anointing and say oh that's just fin that's just oh that's just nonsense we don't believe in that stuff around here the very one the very man who does the ceiling causes people to act unseemly they cry they Rejoice they're energized they they're anointed yes Jesus see don't throw out the one that does the ceiling you need him we need him tonight we need him tonight could you stand to your feet with me thank you Lord I'm just wondering with our hearts bowed uh there's there's a little song I was just thinking about it today when I was reading that quote brother B said said that that man wearing white with the ink horn by his side he said that man is the Holy Ghost and when he said that I this little little song hit my heart we used to sing years ago I used to hear some of the black African Brothers they sing and say come by here Lord come by here do you know that I know I think I've heard you say my [Music] come come by here my Lord come ain't he the one we [Music] want my Lord [Music] come oh [Music] Lord watch you as you sing it just make a prayer out of oh come by

have it won't you say tonight Lord Jesus while you're here you're on others Don't Pass Me By Lord Don't Pass Me By father set that seal Lord upon each heart if one don't have it tonight that that seal of God that assures them of that rapture I pray tonight May the Holy Ghost of God move into that heart I pray the Holy Spirit of God Lord that you'd just come by Lord sealing sealing lives Lord maybe one here tonight Lord they just need to give up something right now they just say Lord I'm going to let it go cuz I want you in my heart I want to make room for you tonight Lord I want you to just come and seal me away into your great Kingdom tonight father I want to receive it Lord father we receive you we welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray we thank you for it father Brother Ray
