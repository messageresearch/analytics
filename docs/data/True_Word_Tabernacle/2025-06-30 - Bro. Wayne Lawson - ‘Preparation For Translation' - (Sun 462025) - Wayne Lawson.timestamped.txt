[0:00] Amen. We want to say God bless you to
[0:02] all that's able to be here. I I know um
[0:05] it's a it's a great time to serve the
[0:08] Lord on this this resurrection morning.
[0:11] Amen. If we could maybe just bow our
[0:13] hearts for a word of prayer. I just
[0:16] wonder maybe you'd take somebody by the
[0:17] hand or maybe lay your hand over on
[0:20] someone and let's ask the Holy Spirit
[0:22] just to help them today to encourage
[0:25] them to open their hearts. Father,
[0:28] Lord, we know there's needs that's far
[0:30] beyond this building this morning.
[0:32] There's some that'll be streaming the
[0:34] meetings, Lord, that can't get here
[0:36] today. But, Father, I pray that you
[0:38] would bless them,
[0:40] Lord. But here in the building right
[0:42] now, there's just such an atmosphere.
[0:44] Oh, hallelujah. Such a divine presence,
[0:47] Lord. Your children gathering around
[0:49] your table, Lord. To eat the great food
[0:52] from heaven. Thank you, Lord. Lord, I
[0:55] pray this morning as they join arm and
[0:57] arm, Lord, hearttoheart.
[1:00] Father, I pray that there would be a
[1:02] forgiveness move through the building.
[1:04] Lord, may there be the tender branches,
[1:07] Lord, of your great Holy Spirit, Lord,
[1:10] begin to grow. And as the watering of
[1:13] this praise and the pouring of your
[1:15] spirit loosens the soil and the dirt,
[1:18] Lord, may the little roots of bitterness
[1:20] be plucked away, Lord. And every weed
[1:23] and every foul thing, may it be plucked,
[1:26] Lord. And may the the flower garden of
[1:28] your presence, Lord. Just may it grow
[1:31] with peace this morning upon each life.
[1:33] And Father, we're asking you this
[1:36] morning that the sick among us would be
[1:38] healed. Father, may the the the
[1:40] depression, anxieties, and
[1:42] discouragements that build up, may
[1:44] Father, they just disappear this morning
[1:48] like the fog in the middle of the day
[1:50] when the great sun begins to shine.
[1:53] Father, as we take one another by the
[1:55] hand and Lord, we pray one for the
[1:57] other. Father, we ask you today that
[2:00] your great spirit would come with a
[2:02] spirit of revelation and wisdom. And
[2:05] father, may an inspiration strike the
[2:07] hearts of the people that have gathered
[2:08] in this building today. And Father, may
[2:11] you deal with them so wonderfully in the
[2:14] enlightenment of your word. Father, we
[2:16] ask you now take lead, Lord. Take divine
[2:19] presence in this place. Father, we ask
[2:22] it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. And
[2:26] God bless you this morning. If you have
[2:29] your Bibles, we would like to turn to
[2:30] the book of Revelations, the 6th
[2:32] chapter. And I want to read two verses
[2:34] here. Revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and
[2:37] 2. And and we will continue on uh
[2:40] shortly in verses. But just now uh these
[2:43] things are just coming on my heart. And
[2:45] in Revelation chapter 6, I want to read
[2:49] here in the first verse. And I saw when
[2:51] the lamb had opened one of the seals,
[2:54] and I heard as it were the noise of a
[2:57] thunder, and one of the four beasts
[3:00] saying, come and see. And I saw, and
[3:03] behold, a white horse, and he that sat
[3:04] upon him had a bow, and a crown was
[3:07] given unto him, and he went forth
[3:10] conquering and to conquer. May God bless
[3:13] his word. As you be seated this morning,
[3:15] I want to continue if I can from this uh
[3:18] concept of the opening of the word, but
[3:20] I'm going to narrow this down to
[3:22] Revelations contained under the seals.
[3:26] And uh this morning the revelations
[3:28] contained under the seals. I want to
[3:29] speak to you about preparation for
[3:31] translation about preparing for
[3:33] translation.
[3:35] Now in the uh in the uh Thursday service
[3:38] we dealt a little bit with some of the
[3:40] things that the revelations that were
[3:42] really contained under the seals and how
[3:44] the difference in a reformer and a
[3:46] prophet and how that a prophet was a
[3:48] revealer and he wasn't just reform
[3:50] reforming the church but he was
[3:52] restoring the original word to the
[3:54] church. And under that first seal,
[3:56] brother Brandham describes to us the the
[3:59] uh the the great story of Joseph in the
[4:02] Bible and how uh that Joseph being uh
[4:06] rejected from Israel had went over into
[4:09] Egypt. And there he became Pharaoh's
[4:12] right hand and lifted up. And as he was
[4:14] lifted up to sit on the throne next to
[4:16] Pharaoh, amen, it was there that Joseph
[4:19] took a gentile bride, becoming the Lord
[4:22] of the Gentiles. Amen. But it wasn't
[4:25] until a man that uh the famine had had
[4:29] returned uh uh Jacob and Benjamin. And
[4:32] when Benjamin come in, he dismisses his
[4:35] wife. And when he dismisses his wife, he
[4:38] begins to reveal himself. Amen. And in
[4:41] that revealing, he opens the eyes of his
[4:43] brethren and and lets them know that he
[4:46] got the scars he was wearing in the
[4:48] house of his friends. and and and you
[4:50] you see the prophet of God said see now
[4:53] the Gentiles would have not been brought
[4:55] in if the Jews hadn't been done
[4:57] blindfolded. He said see that he saved
[5:01] the life of the church by the things
[5:03] that he done. Amen. If you remember the
[5:06] story of Joseph, it's a powerful story.
[5:09] And when the uh when the brethren began
[5:11] to repent to him and they said, "We're
[5:12] so sorry we done these things to you."
[5:15] He said, "Whoa, wait a minute." it. He
[5:17] said, "Don't be sad what you done unto
[5:19] me." He says, "It is what God hath
[5:22] done." Amen. To preserve the prosperity
[5:25] of the church, of the people. He said,
[5:27] "What the what what you might have done
[5:29] for evil, God had made it turn to good."
[5:32] He wouldn't let him take a uh he
[5:34] wouldn't let him take a and say they had
[5:37] did anything because he knew that
[5:39] nothing that was done to him could be
[5:41] done unless his father permitted it to
[5:44] be done. Amen. And that's the Bible when
[5:46] you read it's beautiful in Isaiah 53 it
[5:48] said for the Lord hath bruised him for
[5:50] it pleased God that he would bruise him.
[5:53] So the things that would happen to Jesus
[5:56] Christ as it was to Joseph. Amen. The
[5:58] Jews in Rome had no power over Jesus
[6:02] unless it be given unto him of their
[6:04] father. Amen. So they couldn't have done
[6:05] it. God allowed it and and so did God
[6:08] allowed. And brother Bam said, "And the
[6:09] reason today they can't understand this
[6:12] gospel," he said, "because it isn't the
[6:14] hour." Isn't that isn't that so simple?
[6:18] It isn't the hour. Amen. Uh the brother
[6:20] Brandon was going to Israel and God
[6:23] stopped him and pulled him behind. And
[6:25] brother Duran told him, said, "It's not
[6:26] the time." Amen. He didn't tell him he
[6:29] didn't have a ministry. He didn't say,
[6:31] "What you got won't work." Amen. He
[6:33] said, "It's not the time." Amen. because
[6:36] that that gentile bride wasn't yet
[6:39] finished. Amen. Uh in the 1960s, I was
[6:43] listening to a tape not long ago,
[6:44] brother said, "I met a general who
[6:46] received orders to fire the nuclear
[6:49] missiles." He said, "And the man paused
[6:52] and said, "Something come over him.
[6:53] Don't do it." And he didn't do it for
[6:55] some reason. And brother said the reason
[6:58] was he said there was still some of the
[7:00] seed to come in. Amen. That's why
[7:03] Israel's eyes are not open today. It's
[7:05] not that God couldn't open their eyes in
[7:08] one moment and the whole nation receive.
[7:11] Amen. The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[7:14] but the hour is not yet. That's why,
[7:16] Amen, the hour is there. And brother Bam
[7:18] says, now watch, he's going to be, this
[7:20] is the first seal. It's real powerful
[7:22] when you catch it. He said, the reason
[7:24] they can't see it is because it's not
[7:27] the hour. no more than we could
[7:30] understand these things until the time
[7:33] comes for us to understand it. Amen. And
[7:36] and and the same as Israel was blinded,
[7:39] so was these great mysteries hid in the
[7:43] Bible. And I don't care what your
[7:45] education, you couldn't see it. Amen.
[7:48] For God hides himself in simplicity. But
[7:51] man said, and then reveals himself the
[7:53] same way. And he was hid right there.
[7:55] And you could not understand these
[7:57] things until the time come that you
[8:00] would be able to understand them. Oh my,
[8:03] these seven thunders of revelation. May
[8:06] it show this bride how to prepare for
[8:09] that great translation faith. My that's
[8:12] it. The hour of it when it's opened.
[8:15] It's telling you that that becomes the
[8:17] hour of how to prepare for that great
[8:20] translation. Yeah,
[8:22] you you couldn't know it until God
[8:25] opened it. But when it became opened, it
[8:27] became a time of the preparation for the
[8:31] church for a translation. Now in and and
[8:34] brother Brandham tells us this very
[8:36] clearly when he's discussing sers is
[8:38] this the time he said this seventh angel
[8:40] messenger when he comes he's excuse me
[8:43] he's going to be solving out some
[8:45] mysteries and he said the second mystery
[8:47] that he's going to be resolving for us
[8:49] is Israel's blindness during the age in
[8:53] Romans 11:25 it takes the context so one
[8:56] of the great mysteries the seventh angel
[8:58] was to reveal was Israel's blindness
[9:00] amen and that was not opened until the
[9:03] seventh angel sounded. Of course, we
[9:05] talked very strongly on it on Thursday,
[9:07] how that those reformers were anti-mitic
[9:10] in their in their all their
[9:11] understanding, but they couldn't know it
[9:13] until the hour. But when a prophet comes
[9:16] along, he opens the mystery of it and
[9:18] said, "Oh, don't be upset at them.
[9:20] They're blind because God was making a
[9:22] place for you." Amen. And then right
[9:24] behind that, he said, "And the next
[9:26] mystery that he will make known is the
[9:29] mystery of the translation of the end
[9:31] time of the saints in 1 Corinthians 15
[9:34] and and Thessalonians 4 and verse 17."
[9:37] You see, the same as he made known the
[9:39] mystery of why Israel was blind, that
[9:42] same prophet's going to known to you the
[9:45] mystery of how this bride is going to
[9:48] change or translate from one dimension
[9:52] to another. I'll tell you, it's a
[9:54] powerful thing. They asked Brother
[9:55] Bandom in in in questions and answers,
[9:58] and they said, "Brother Bam, could you
[9:59] explain to us the mystery of the
[10:02] translation of the bride?
[10:04] Can you explain to us the mystery of the
[10:06] translation of the bride?" He said,
[10:08] "It's just a change."
[10:11] He said, "Our bodies." Now, let me say
[10:13] this. You know what I mean when I say
[10:15] that? I don't mean to be sacriiggious. I
[10:18] mean to say ours. I don't mean to say
[10:20] the this church, but I mean believers,
[10:23] every believer. Abraham was looking for
[10:26] a promised son and that was promised him
[10:29] is right. And the church is looking for
[10:32] a promised son. Is that right? Amen. And
[10:35] the bride, is that right? The bride is
[10:37] looking for the promised son, our Lord
[10:39] Jesus Christ. The corporal body of Jesus
[10:43] Christ. Amen. Before the promised son
[10:45] could come to Sarah and Abraham, their
[10:48] bodies had to be changed. Amen. And so,
[10:51] so she was too old to have a baby and
[10:54] she had no milk veins in her breast and
[10:56] her breast was dried up and her womb
[10:58] wasn't fertile and she was sterile. She
[11:00] could not have a baby. Her heart was too
[11:02] old to stand the labor. So, what
[11:05] happened? God changed her back to a
[11:08] young woman. And he did that to Abraham
[11:11] the same thing because he said his body
[11:15] was as good as dead. See, and he had to
[11:18] change their bodies in order to receive
[11:20] the promised son. And we could not
[11:22] receive the promised son that's promised
[11:25] us today in the bodies that we live in.
[11:28] These bodies are sin.
[11:31] So before we can meet the corporal body
[11:33] of Jesus Christ, there has got to be a
[11:36] change in the body. Now, many people
[11:38] don't even know that there was a body
[11:40] change in the book of Genesis with
[11:41] Abraham and Sarah, but it was one of the
[11:43] mysteries that was being solved out in
[11:45] the age we're living in. And brother
[11:47] Brandham went back in there and he said,
[11:49] "Oh, it's in there. It's just between
[11:50] the lines now." He said, "Watch." He
[11:52] said, "Here Abraham is old and stricken
[11:55] with age." He said, "Little old
[11:57] grandma." Brother puts it on. He says,
[11:58] "There's little old grandma out there
[12:00] with Abraham." And they went on a
[12:02] 300mile hike across the desert. And when
[12:06] they got on the other side of that
[12:07] 300-mile hike, the king of a country
[12:10] wanted to marry that old grandma.
[12:12] Brother Bram said there was something
[12:14] changed in there somewhere. Amen. They
[12:16] had a change. See, Elohim had brought
[12:19] them a message and it was a message of
[12:21] change. And that change had happened
[12:24] over that processes of time. Amen. And
[12:26] there had been a change in their body.
[12:28] Brother man says, "See the first thing
[12:30] is the conscience controls the body.
[12:32] See, taste, feel, smell, hear." He says,
[12:34] "And and just got all of that scrupled
[12:37] up and and we reason and everything
[12:39] else, but that new body that comes from
[12:41] this born again." See, not this first
[12:44] conscience, it's going to pass away.
[12:46] It's that inside something that lives.
[12:49] Everybody understand that? Say amen.
[12:52] Amen. If it's not this outside, taste,
[12:55] feel, smell it, hear, it isn't, it's
[12:57] subject to death and it will die. But
[13:00] the inside part of you down in there,
[13:03] that inside is the person that cannot
[13:06] die. And that's the person that that new
[13:09] life starts from from this new birth.
[13:12] And it builds up into another person
[13:15] that is in the image of the person you
[13:18] are around that life. Do you get it?
[13:20] Potentially, it's in there. What is it?
[13:22] It's the word promised before the
[13:25] foundation of the world. And around
[13:27] there, this only reflects the negative.
[13:30] See and the reflect the positive of the
[13:32] word and the same thing is of the
[13:34] translation of this bride will be the
[13:37] same thing the word that's in you
[13:39] somebody say the word in you the word
[13:41] that's in you this body will materialize
[13:45] around that word hallelujah church why
[13:49] are you in church this morning because
[13:51] the word in you is where the new body
[13:55] materializes you will never have a
[13:57] rapture without the word Amen. Some
[14:00] people don't see the word of God as
[14:02] important. They don't see a prophet as
[14:04] important. But if you believe
[14:05] translation is important, I'll tell you
[14:08] the word is the most important thing in
[14:09] your life. It's how the new body is
[14:12] formed is around that word. It's a
[14:15] promise that comes into you. Brother
[14:18] says it like this. The same thing that
[14:20] word that's in you, that body will
[14:22] materialize around that word. The same
[14:24] thing as it did to Sarah. That old body
[14:26] she had, that first body, it had to be
[14:29] changed in order to produce a son. You
[14:31] get it? That body could not do it. And
[14:34] this body cannot do it. It's got to have
[14:37] a change. It must receive the sun. Now,
[14:40] I'm not I'm not just out here in the in
[14:42] the space or or some scientific uh movie
[14:45] somewhere or some Disney channel. Amen.
[14:48] This is reality. This is the bride's
[14:52] body coming from the word of God in this
[14:55] generation. This is scriptural as
[14:58] anything that's ever been taught to you
[14:59] in your life. Amen. There is in this
[15:02] Bible that we call the infallible word
[15:05] of God. The inherent word of God. There
[15:08] is no error in this word. This word
[15:10] cannot fail. Not a jot or a tit of this
[15:13] word can fail. And this Bible said the
[15:16] things that were done a four time was
[15:18] only done for your example. A prophet of
[15:21] God said a shadow for you, a type for
[15:24] the church. And we can read here how
[15:26] there was a translation in the Bible for
[15:28] Enoch. There was one for Elijah. There
[15:31] was one for Philip. There was one for
[15:33] Paul. There was one for John. There was
[15:35] even one in our generations with brother
[15:38] Brandham when he went beyond the curtain
[15:40] of time in a translation when he when he
[15:43] walked with God on the mountain and
[15:45] turned into a young man and walked into
[15:47] an Eden condition right here in these
[15:50] generations because all we need is a
[15:53] change, a translation. Amen. Now, now if
[15:57] we're going to be uh believers, and I I
[15:59] believe we're not just a headless
[16:01] church. I I don't believe we're just
[16:03] taking off in direction without a word
[16:05] of God. Amen. But you got a type in this
[16:08] Bible. And you can't out live your type.
[16:12] Amen. And the type that the prophet
[16:14] picked for you was an Enoch type. He
[16:16] said, see, he didn't have to die. He
[16:19] said God made a translation for him. So
[16:22] God made a rapture for him. God had to
[16:25] do it in order to make a type out of
[16:28] Enoch. That's right. Can you imagine?
[16:31] Amen. God raptured Enoch. He translated
[16:34] Enoch to make a type for you and I.
[16:38] Well, glory to God. Amen. I say this. If
[16:41] God did it for a type, what's he going
[16:43] to do for the reality? If God would do
[16:46] that to make a type, Amen. then God is
[16:49] surely going to do that for the church
[16:50] to make a translation. Amen. Watch.
[16:53] Enoch was translated. And brother Bam
[16:55] says, "But when Elijah come to die, he
[16:58] had already showed the type that there
[17:01] was a translation." He said, "Now he was
[17:03] going to show us how to do it." Amen.
[17:05] And he let us see that Elijah crossed
[17:08] the Jordan, died on a chariot of fire,
[17:10] and rode up into the heavens right in
[17:12] front of Elisha to show that when God
[17:16] needs a way, God can make a way. When
[17:18] there is no way, God makes a way. Amen.
[17:21] Isn't it amazing that Elijah is the one
[17:24] that is tied to the type that will
[17:27] instruct the bride on the way to make
[17:29] translation? Now, we know there's a
[17:31] translation, but how is it done? How do
[17:34] I get involved in preparing for the
[17:37] translation? That's the real question
[17:39] this morning. There's a whole world that
[17:41] believes in rapture. There's a whole
[17:43] world that believes in translation, but
[17:45] how do I get to be a part of it? How do
[17:47] I prepare myself for the translation of
[17:51] my body? My goodness, I'll say like
[17:54] this. Amen. There's a there's a way. And
[17:56] God used Elijah to show the way.
[18:00] And that same spirit of Elijah is the
[18:02] one that is here today making a way for
[18:05] you and I to show us. Amen. It's a
[18:08] question that Paul asked us in Romans
[18:10] the 7th chapter in the 24th verse. old
[18:13] wretched man that I am. Who shall
[18:15] deliver me from this body of death? My
[18:18] uh Paul must have been having a week
[18:20] like some of us have sometimes.
[18:23] Oh, wretched man that I am. You read the
[18:26] rest of that Romans 7 and he's sitting
[18:28] there saying it very clearly. The things
[18:30] that I would do, I don't do them. And
[18:33] the things that I wouldn't do, them that
[18:35] I do. Amen. He said, "Oh, then who who
[18:38] is it that could deliver such a warfare?
[18:41] Because my outer man wants to serve
[18:44] something different than the inner man.
[18:46] And with my mind, I serve God. But this
[18:49] flesh, he's telling you that evil is
[18:51] present everywhere he goes. Because
[18:53] brother Random teaches us the evil one.
[18:56] Now you got to y'all y'all got to be
[18:58] believers now. Buckle your seat belt.
[19:00] Amen. But the evil one is see, taste,
[19:03] feel, smell, and hear. It's that one on
[19:06] the outside. Do you do you know brother
[19:08] Ram said it? He said, "It's time for
[19:10] this believers to separate from all
[19:13] unbelief." And God is calling Abraham's
[19:16] seed to totally separate from that evil
[19:18] one. That that seed, taste, feel, smell
[19:21] here. That outward man, amen, is a
[19:25] hybrid. But there is a call coming from
[19:28] this message to separate from your
[19:30] senses, to separate from your feelings,
[19:32] separate and believe the word of God.
[19:36] Believe that word of God. Oh wretched
[19:38] man that I am. I could preach a week on
[19:41] that one. Oh wretched man that I am.
[19:43] Amen. Finding himself short of what he
[19:46] wants to be.
[19:49] But while he's suffering and while he's
[19:52] he's being buffeted in his flesh, you
[19:54] hear him tell it. Amen. And in the
[19:56] middle of it, he knows there's
[19:58] deliverance somewhere because he asked,
[20:00] "Who shall deliver me from this body?"
[20:03] It wasn't what, it's certainly who. And
[20:06] I say this morning, it ain't what will
[20:08] deliver you. It's who will deliver you.
[20:10] Because Jesus is a person. Amen. And it
[20:13] would take the person. It would take the
[20:15] very presence of of God to bring
[20:18] deliverance to the church. He's the
[20:20] great emancipator, isn't he? And he's
[20:22] the one that would would would save a
[20:24] man. Amen. And give him deliverance from
[20:26] his sin. Don't you know the same great
[20:29] emancipator that delivered you from your
[20:31] sin will also deliver you from this body
[20:35] of death that you find yourself trapped
[20:37] in. Oh, thank God this morning, church.
[20:40] I don't know if it's a day or an hour or
[20:43] 50 years, but there is a deliverer
[20:45] that's going to change this body. And I
[20:48] say he's already on the scene.
[20:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[20:54] My, what a morning to think, who is it
[20:57] that will change this body of death. My
[21:02] goodness. Now, now I I I'm going to to
[21:05] to to to deliver me from this body of
[21:07] death. Now, let's read Philippians 3 and
[21:10] 21. Because sometimes people will say to
[21:11] me, "Brother Wayne, where is the body
[21:14] change exactly in scripture?" Let me
[21:16] read it for you. Amen. The same writer.
[21:20] Who shall change our vile body?
[21:24] Isn't it something? He actually switches
[21:26] from from a wretched man to a vile body.
[21:29] Who shall change our vile body? So it's
[21:31] a new the new birth. Amen. Is already
[21:34] began the processes.
[21:36] Watch now. Who shall change our vile
[21:38] body that it may be fashioned like an
[21:41] unto his glorious body. Now, if you ever
[21:44] have a question about the physical body
[21:47] of the Lord Jesus, I think this one
[21:49] should answer it for you.
[21:52] A body likened unto his own glorious
[21:55] body. Yeah. So Jesus had theophony
[21:58] before he had flesh, right? He went
[22:00] theophony flesh, theophony in the grave,
[22:04] and then that theophony picked up the
[22:07] dead body and glorified it. And today he
[22:10] sets immortal in heaven in a glorified
[22:13] body.
[22:15] Amen. Do you see the promise of our body
[22:17] change is connected to the fact that the
[22:20] head of the church has already
[22:22] experienced the change and sets in
[22:24] heaven right now. And he may be
[22:26] fashioned like an unto his own glorious
[22:28] body according to the working whereby he
[22:30] is able to subdue all things to himself.
[22:33] Now Thessalonians tells us about the
[22:35] catching away. But now Paul is going to
[22:38] tell us the process. You you've read it
[22:39] in Thessalonians. For the Lord shall
[22:41] descend from heaven with a shout, the
[22:42] voice, and the trump of the archangel,
[22:44] and the dead in Christ shall rise first,
[22:45] and we which are alive and remain shall
[22:48] not prevent them which are asleep. Amen.
[22:51] Amen. Listen, the living won't hold up
[22:52] the resurrection in this generation.
[22:55] Amen. There's coming a people who are
[22:58] ready for rapture. Yes. See, the
[23:01] Thessalonians tells us, Paul's telling
[23:03] us, but in the book of Corinthians, he
[23:06] actually discusses the process of it.
[23:09] Watch what he does in 1 Corinthians
[23:11] 15:51. I will show you a mystery. Now,
[23:14] just for sake, if you're listening uh
[23:16] maybe uh deeply for the first time of
[23:18] this subject, I will show you a mystery.
[23:20] Now, that word mystery there, you know,
[23:22] and I know in the book of Amos, it says
[23:25] God would never show a mystery without a
[23:28] prophet.
[23:29] So he locked the resurrection and
[23:32] rapture mystery right there in 1
[23:35] Corinthians 15. It's locked until the
[23:38] seventh angel would sound in the end
[23:40] time to unlock the mystery of what has
[23:43] been hid in the writings of Paul in the
[23:46] book of Corinthians. See Paul Paul and
[23:47] brother Bram are not preaching two
[23:49] different things. Right. But Paul didn't
[23:52] fully under didn't fully write the
[23:54] understanding of what was coming because
[23:57] there was an angel behind him. Amen. A
[24:00] seventh one. But we all shall be changed
[24:03] in the moment in the twinkle of an eye
[24:05] at the last trump. For the trump shall
[24:06] sound. The dead shall be raised
[24:07] incorruptible. We shall be changed. For
[24:10] this corruptible must put on
[24:12] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[24:16] on immortality. There's the secret. The
[24:19] corruptible must put on incorruption,
[24:22] and the mortal must put on immortality.
[24:26] And when this corruptible have put on
[24:27] incorruption, and this mortal shall have
[24:29] put on immortality, then shall be
[24:31] brought to pass the saying, death is
[24:33] swallowed up in victory. Amen. So, we've
[24:36] got to see that the corruption has to
[24:39] stop. Yeah. Amen. And there has to be a
[24:42] reverse of the process or the cycle of
[24:45] death.
[24:46] Something has to be able to put the
[24:49] whole thing in reverse.
[24:52] How can you put it all in reverse? Think
[24:54] of this. There has to be a reverse, a
[24:56] process, and and and we'll look at this
[24:58] and see it in a mystery form. Now, if
[25:00] it's the truth, it's in the Bible,
[25:02] folks. And it's there more than one
[25:04] time. Right now, if you go to the book
[25:07] of Job, we were just studying pretty
[25:09] intensively on the book of Job for this
[25:11] uh for the funeral for brother Johnson.
[25:12] And and and as I was looking pretty
[25:14] intensely on some of these things, I I
[25:17] just thought it it's so amazing when you
[25:20] read Job the 14th chapter and Brother
[25:22] Bon uses it in many funerals and and and
[25:25] he will make a huge point in a lot of
[25:27] funerals and he will say it like this.
[25:29] He will say, "We recognize that the the
[25:32] person is not with us here today." He
[25:34] says, "But does man live beyond this
[25:38] place?" And he says, "It's the oldest
[25:41] question in the Bible." He says, "And
[25:43] it's the one Job asked." Amen. And Job
[25:46] in Job 14, he asked it. He said, "Oh,
[25:49] that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
[25:50] that thou wouldest keep my secret until
[25:53] the wrath be passed till thou wouldest
[25:54] to appoint a set time and remember me?
[25:57] And if a man die, shall he live again?"
[26:00] There's the question. If a man die,
[26:02] shall he live again? And all the days of
[26:05] my appointed time will I wait till my
[26:07] change come. Thou shalt call. I will
[26:09] answer and thou will have a desired work
[26:11] of thine hands. Now Paul uh Job asked
[26:14] this question. Now if you like to study
[26:16] scripture and along with the message,
[26:18] you'll find in there's a sermon preached
[26:20] spoken word original seed. How many's
[26:22] ever heard it? And brother Bam separates
[26:24] it in two parts. I like to see that.
[26:26] Praise the Lord. Oh them hands. Spoken
[26:28] word original seed. Amen. Uh we're doing
[26:30] our jobs, brother Ray. We got them
[26:32] listening to the tapes. Amen. Spoken
[26:33] word original seed. Amen. Is split in
[26:36] two parts. Remember the first part is
[26:38] the seed is the word. The second part is
[26:43] the bride is the soil of that seed.
[26:46] Amen. Uh you know in parables you got to
[26:49] watch it because it gets mixed up you
[26:51] know cuz like if you go to Matthew 13
[26:53] remember there's two parables there
[26:54] right? The first parable of Matthew 13
[26:57] is God the Lord Jesus speaking the
[27:00] parable of the swer and how he sews the
[27:02] word on the ground. remember. And he
[27:05] says it's good seed because it's the
[27:06] word. He said, "But it don't work
[27:08] because it's uh uh falls on bad ground."
[27:11] Remember, or chokes out with weeds or
[27:13] the cares of life. And he's showing you
[27:16] that the word has to fall on good
[27:18] ground. And in that parable, the word is
[27:21] the seed and you're the soil. That's
[27:24] right. But if you turn just over on the
[27:26] next in my Thompson, it's the next page
[27:28] there. And you you see the second
[27:30] parable and he says two sers went out
[27:32] sewing into the world and and he said
[27:35] one dressed in white sold and then one
[27:37] in black sold behind him and he was the
[27:40] one in white was going to go out and
[27:41] pluck everything up and the voice said
[27:43] no wait until they grow up together
[27:46] remember and then I'll send my reapers
[27:48] into the field and the parable is the
[27:51] world amen is the is the field but the
[27:55] seed is the children of God. Yeah. So,
[27:58] see, you're you're in different
[28:00] parables. One parable you're a seed.
[28:01] Another parable you're the you're the uh
[28:04] you're the ground. That's how people get
[28:05] mixed up on predestination. They get
[28:08] mixed up thinking that you're that you
[28:10] only start really being who you are when
[28:12] you hear the message that it plants a
[28:14] seed in you and then you become bride
[28:16] from that point. But it's quite quite a
[28:19] let me say um I don't know how to say it
[28:23] nicely. I'll say it best way I know.
[28:25] They should keep studying. Yeah. They
[28:29] just they just need to progress. Just
[28:31] they just need to go on past the first
[28:32] four books of the Bible. You remember
[28:34] the Samaritans? Amen. They were mixed up
[28:36] on worship because they didn't continue
[28:39] with the word, right? Amen. And and and
[28:42] if you watch now, brother Random will
[28:44] describe this and then and then he will
[28:46] make beautiful statements about Mary and
[28:48] and watch Mary in Isaiah 7:14. Behold, a
[28:53] virgin shall conceive. So the virgin is
[28:56] now a seed into the earth by Isaiah. So
[29:00] she's she's coming and Mary is
[29:02] predestinated on the earth. But then the
[29:05] angel stands in front of Mary and says,
[29:08] "Amen, that thou shalt have a child and
[29:10] call his name Jesus." And he's quoting
[29:12] Isaiah 9 and6 to her. So what is it? The
[29:16] seed and the seed come together. So
[29:19] there's a word seed, a bride seed,
[29:21] right? So you're already anointed of God
[29:24] to come into the earth. When Ephesians
[29:26] 5, Paul said there would be a bride
[29:28] without spot or wrinkle. Now that bride
[29:31] is on the earth awaiting the coming of
[29:33] that message that comes into them.
[29:36] Because when the Bible said they which
[29:38] are alive and remain under the coming of
[29:40] the Lord is speaking about somebody, I
[29:44] don't believe it's talking just about
[29:45] any generation. My faith, my belief,
[29:48] he's speaking of this generation. I
[29:51] literally believe, brother Richard,
[29:53] there will be people that we are
[29:55] preaching to this morning that will
[29:57] manifest the translation of this body. I
[30:00] believe that we are preaching the last
[30:02] sermons to the human race. I believe the
[30:05] bride is hearing the last of the
[30:07] messages. If I had one message to
[30:10] preach, I would say it this morning.
[30:13] Prepare yourselves for change. The
[30:15] change is upon us. The hour is here. The
[30:19] anointing is here. The word is here.
[30:23] Hallelujah.
[30:25] It's the season for it. It's the hour
[30:27] for it. It's the time for it. My do do
[30:32] you see then now when we we say this uh
[30:35] and I'm approaching it this way for a
[30:36] reason because Job, Amen, in spoken word
[30:39] original seed, brother man preaches a
[30:41] sermon right behind it and it's entitled
[30:44] end time seed sign. And he begins it
[30:46] with Amos the third chapter and he said
[30:49] surely our Lord our God will do nothing
[30:50] till first he reveals it to the servant
[30:52] the prophet. And I remember distinctly
[30:56] stopping and going why is he starting
[30:59] with Amos the third chapter for this
[31:02] sermon about Job? Because Job is a
[31:05] prophet
[31:07] right? And there's no written scripture
[31:10] while Job is on the earth.
[31:13] There's no there's no Bible. Brother
[31:15] said he didn't have a Bible to read and
[31:17] Job was sitting on the ash heap and with
[31:20] the question with the see he asked the
[31:23] question can man live again and brother
[31:25] Bham said being that Job was a prophet
[31:28] God showed him what was wrong with man
[31:31] that he went in the ground and that the
[31:34] tree died but come again it just it just
[31:37] springs in the sin but you in in the in
[31:40] the in the spring but you put your
[31:42] friend in the ground he stays there and
[31:43] brother and said, but what he did was
[31:45] God being a prophet showed Job. He
[31:48] showed him the problem was that the sin
[31:51] did not come from the plant of the
[31:53] flower. It come from man. Yeah. See,
[31:57] when God in the beginning in the Garden
[31:59] of Eden, he spoke a word and that was a
[32:02] perfect word and Adam and Eve was behind
[32:04] that word. But when Eve corrupted that
[32:08] seed,
[32:10] she took mankind down the path of death.
[32:13] And brother B said, "And watch now. Job
[32:15] saw that that the path of corruption
[32:18] began in the Garden of Eden when the
[32:21] word that God had spoken had been
[32:23] corrupted and it caused all the death he
[32:26] was looking at." Amen. But watch the
[32:29] prophet said, "But while he's sitting on
[32:30] that ash heap, he rises up and begins to
[32:34] speak out." And brother said, "What he
[32:35] does, he saw a vision of the
[32:37] resurrection of Jesus." And he said, oh,
[32:39] he said he saw a man that could reach
[32:42] between
[32:44] fallen man, corrupted man, and the
[32:46] sinless God. And he could he could make
[32:49] the gap back again. Now, this is
[32:51] powerful, church. Please don't miss
[32:53] this. And he said when he saw it, he
[32:56] stood up and saw the thing that no other
[32:59] prophets had saw. He said, "Oh, Abraham
[33:02] saw some good things and and Ezekiel saw
[33:04] some good things." He said, "But oh my,
[33:07] Job seen the resurrection." And he said
[33:10] when he stood up and began to prophesy,
[33:12] he be to say, "Though the skin worms
[33:15] would destroy this body, in my flesh,
[33:20] shall I see God who is my redeemer?" And
[33:24] he begin to cry out, "My redeemer
[33:25] liveth." Now, now, now folks, if you're
[33:28] a Bible reader, you know that it's
[33:30] nearly 4,000 years later before Jesus
[33:33] ever appears on the earth. Amen. And
[33:36] when he comes on the earth, Job is
[33:38] nothing but ashes in the grave. But man
[33:40] said he wasn't more than a teaspoon of
[33:42] ashes left of Job laying in that grave.
[33:45] But the words that Job had prophesied
[33:48] was just as real that morning as they
[33:51] was when he said it. Because this body
[33:54] wasn't where change was coming from.
[33:57] Hallelujah. This body is not where
[33:59] change comes from. It was the word that
[34:03] Job spoke. That word was prophesy. My
[34:07] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The word
[34:10] that was prophesied.
[34:13] He spoke his own change.
[34:19] My goodness. But I'm sorry. This whole
[34:21] whole whole audience just almost went
[34:23] milky for about 3 minutes here. Amen. It
[34:26] it's Listen, folks. We're we're standing
[34:28] on the precipice on the edge of the
[34:32] chains of the bodies. You say, "My body,
[34:35] my troubles." It's not coming from your
[34:38] body. It's not coming from your
[34:40] troubles. It's not coming from the
[34:42] problem. It's coming from the word.
[34:46] The word has already been spoken. Amen.
[34:51] Yes, sir. My Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Oh,
[34:55] hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[35:00] Brother man said he seen it. There had
[35:02] to be another spoken word. That was the
[35:05] mystery.
[35:07] It had corrupted from the Garden of
[35:08] Eden, and there had to be another spoken
[35:10] word. And Job being a prophet, he didn't
[35:14] just see the problems, he spoke the
[35:17] answers. Amen.
[35:19] Glory to God. Brother Ram said Job being
[35:22] a prophet, the secrets of God was known
[35:23] to him and he spoke a word and when he
[35:26] spoke the word, God showed him it become
[35:29] material because it was a spoken word of
[35:32] God. And in its season, it took place.
[35:36] That's it. Amen. When God has a prophet
[35:39] speak something, it stops whatever's
[35:42] happening
[35:44] and begins a re. It may be 4,000 years
[35:47] before it happened, but the word of God
[35:50] cannot return void, but it must
[35:53] accomplish that which God has sent it
[35:55] unto this morning. Amen. That the
[35:58] corruptions of our bodies begin to stop.
[36:01] Amen. The moment that a prophet begin to
[36:04] prophesy and he be to speak of the
[36:06] rapture that was happening in this
[36:08] generation. I don't care folks what
[36:10] happens to this corporal body, this
[36:12] physical body. Satan has already lost.
[36:16] Amen. Rapturing grace has already been
[36:19] given to the church.
[36:21] I got news for you, devil. You're too
[36:24] late. Amen. Hallelujah. You're too late.
[36:27] The message has already been preached.
[36:34] There is no stopping it now.
[36:38] Hallelujah. You'll never stop her. She
[36:41] is the word, the spoken word
[36:45] of almighty God. I don't care what
[36:47] you're facing right now. I don't care
[36:49] what you're facing in your families,
[36:51] what you're facing in your job, what
[36:52] you're facing in your life. There's a
[36:54] word spoken over you. It's not It's not
[36:58] some man prophesying. It's God
[37:00] prophesying.
[37:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[37:07] It'll break every barrier. It'll pull
[37:10] down every stronghold. It'll open the
[37:12] cities. It'll tear down the walls.
[37:16] Glory.
[37:18] Hallelujah. Victory.
[37:21] Yes, sir.
[37:23] Eve was corrupted by Satan's words
[37:29] and physically
[37:31] changed
[37:33] because of the words spoken to her.
[37:37] She entered into relationship with Satan
[37:39] because of words. And those words took
[37:43] on life. And the life that was produced
[37:47] brought death.
[37:50] If we're going to stop the cycle, we've
[37:52] got to be willing to admit really what
[37:54] happened in the garden.
[37:57] It wasn't just the physical that
[37:59] happened back there. It was she let down
[38:01] the guard and believed what the devil
[38:03] was telling her.
[38:05] And if we're going to change the
[38:06] direction, then the same thing in this
[38:09] bride in the last days, we've got to
[38:11] remember, Amen. never one reason doubt
[38:15] what the prophet of God has spoke over
[38:17] our lives. Amen.
[38:19] The stopping of a death cycle, of a
[38:22] corruption cycle, the beginning of
[38:24] another cycle. And I know this is old
[38:26] news for some of you, but it's good
[38:28] news.
[38:30] Amen. Oh, it's so good.
[38:34] It's so good. This such good news. Oh
[38:36] yes.
[38:38] Somebody say rapture cycle. Rapture
[38:40] cycle. It's a good word to remember.
[38:44] Rapture cycle. I'm a hillbilly.
[38:48] Y'all know that already. Simple.
[38:52] We We got uh I don't know how many
[38:54] cycles exactly is on that worst machine.
[38:56] I don't know. Maybe I I I ain't used it
[39:01] much.
[39:03] But I hear it.
[39:06] Got one of them quieter ones, Brother
[39:07] Alex. And now, not much, but a little.
[39:10] And you hear it running once in a while.
[39:11] And then,
[39:13] honey, what you're doing, I'm washing
[39:15] clothes. It don't matter if it's the
[39:17] wash cycle, the rinse cycle, the dry
[39:20] cycle.
[39:23] They're in a process.
[39:26] They're in a cycle. Yes. Listen, this
[39:30] bride is in rapture cycle.
[39:36] You have reached
[39:38] spin cycle,
[39:41] brother. You You see that last just
[39:44] before
[39:46] that that that very last cycle before
[39:48] the clothes come out. You have reached
[39:50] it. The last cycle. We're in the middle
[39:54] of it.
[40:00] Amen. In first 2 Corinthians 11:2, if
[40:03] you've never studied serpent seed, this
[40:05] is a good scripture for you. I am
[40:07] jealous over you with a godly jealous.
[40:09] For I have espoused you to one husband.
[40:11] Amen. Why Paul say that? One husband.
[40:15] Yeah. Do you ever notice why he says in
[40:16] the book of Romans the n 8th chapter he
[40:19] says uh Jacob and Esau
[40:22] one father
[40:25] one mother. Why why does he say that?
[40:28] They just had one father. Why would he
[40:30] why would he make a point of that there
[40:32] was just one? Yeah
[40:35] because somewhere in the history
[40:38] there were two fathers
[40:40] to twins.
[40:42] And he's making a point that there's
[40:45] just one husband to the church. And may
[40:48] I present you a chasteed virgin.
[40:51] But I fear less by any means a serpent
[40:53] begal Eve. See, I ain't awful on a long
[40:56] chase, am I? I a serpent begal Eve
[41:00] through his subility. So your minds
[41:03] would be corrupted from the simplicity
[41:05] that is in Christ. What where did
[41:07] corruption start?
[41:09] Through the corruption of the word.
[41:12] Where did the corruption of the human
[41:14] life begin? The corruption of the word.
[41:18] So if you're going to correct the error,
[41:23] the word has to become correct.
[41:26] See, they were corrupted. Brother Bam is
[41:28] teaching us that that Paul is trying to
[41:31] keep the church from being corrupted.
[41:33] Brother Brandham is coming along and
[41:35] he's telling you, don't allow Satan to
[41:37] corrupt you. Listen, and and I'll say
[41:40] this as as as a pastor, just preaching
[41:42] to you this morning, don't let someone
[41:45] corrupt this message to you. Amen.
[41:47] That's right. Don't let them remove the
[41:50] simplicity
[41:52] that's in Christ.
[41:55] Don't let them remove that thing. Say,
[41:57] "Well, I know brother Bam said it, but
[42:00] No, no, no, no, no, no. The only thing
[42:03] goes behind Brother Bam said it's amen."
[42:05] Amen.
[42:06] That's right. That's the only way to
[42:08] finish a sentence. Brother Bam said it.
[42:10] Amen.
[42:12] Amen. That's the way I finish all my
[42:14] good sentences.
[42:16] Proper English here. See that that word
[42:20] delivers and will change our body. Now,
[42:22] now the the scriptures tells us that the
[42:24] whole creation actually groans for the
[42:27] manifestation of sons. Romans the 8th
[42:29] chapter. So the whole thing is depending
[42:32] on the opening of these seals. Now I
[42:36] know folks I know people have so
[42:38] minimized what the opening of the word
[42:40] means but it is paramount.
[42:44] It is pinnacle. It is it is the climax
[42:48] of the entire dispensations
[42:52] that when God releases these seals he's
[42:56] releasing a reverse of the corruption
[42:59] that man has been under all the way to
[43:02] Eden. Yes. Somebody says, "Well, I
[43:05] thought it was just back to the cross."
[43:06] Then why does Malachi 4 say that if
[43:08] Elijah don't come, there's a curse will
[43:10] destroy the whole earth.
[43:13] The cross paid the price. This message
[43:16] is the claim of what he done at Calvary.
[43:20] I tell you, it's good thing to buy a
[43:21] car, but if you don't go pick it up,
[43:23] what difference does it make? But that's
[43:25] when the contention comes is when you
[43:27] drive up and say, "That one belongs to
[43:29] me." And some salesmen that don't know
[43:31] what they're doing say, "Well, I think
[43:32] that belongs to so and so, or I think
[43:33] that belongs to so and so. It's time to
[43:35] produce the papers." Come on, church.
[43:38] And God is coming to pick up this bride,
[43:41] and he's producing the paperwork of the
[43:43] opening of seven seals, which proves
[43:46] that before the devil ever touched you,
[43:48] God already made a claim on you. And
[43:51] Satan can't hold you in this hour.
[43:54] Hallelujah. He can't hold you.
[43:57] That's right.
[43:59] Do you see? That's why. Amen. Now, now
[44:01] these these small statements, I wish I
[44:03] had the voice of an archangel to make
[44:05] them, but the sound of the gospel is
[44:08] connected to the body change.
[44:12] Amen. The sounding of the trumpet, of
[44:14] the unsealing of the book will cause it
[44:17] to move from prophet to prophecy.
[44:21] In Revelation 22 and 10, Amen. That's
[44:24] why that John was told by the angel,
[44:27] "Seal not the sayings of this book." The
[44:31] time is at hand. Listen. Amen. There was
[44:35] a time it needed to be sealed up.
[44:40] But John unseal it. Let the thunder
[44:43] thunder. It's time for the translation
[44:45] of the church of the living God. This is
[44:48] what will do it.
[44:52] Amen. Now, Eve was corrupted just by
[44:54] Satan talking to her. Think about that.
[44:58] Don't talk to him much. He'll mess you
[44:59] up.
[45:00] [Music]
[45:02] Come on. Now, man lives by every word
[45:06] that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[45:08] And if you study Brother Brandham,
[45:10] you'll find Brother Bram saying that
[45:11] you're held over hell by a chain of the
[45:14] word. He don't call it a rope, he calls
[45:17] it a chain because a chain has links.
[45:21] And he said, "The Bible is not written
[45:22] by paragraphs. It's written by words."
[45:25] He said, "And that chain is only as
[45:29] strong
[45:30] as its weakest link."
[45:34] You said, "Brother Wayne, you mean one
[45:36] promise? What took him out of the Garden
[45:38] of Eden?"
[45:41] One word. Brother Ben said she only
[45:44] failed on one promise. What was that
[45:47] promise? That God keeps his word.
[45:51] That was the promise that Satan got her
[45:53] on. Look and watch now. If Satan,
[45:57] if he could drag her out of the
[46:00] perfection of God,
[46:03] his words hung into her
[46:07] and drugg her from peace and prosperity.
[46:10] It drugg her from perfection. It drugg
[46:13] her from joy. It it it drugg her out of
[46:17] the Garden of Eden. Think about it.
[46:20] Talking to that devil brought her out of
[46:22] a perfect place in a perfect condition.
[46:26] Listen, I I I'm just that guy. I'm
[46:28] sorry, but I'm not a negative preacher.
[46:30] And if there is a negative, there is
[46:32] bound to be a positive. Amen. And if
[46:35] Satan's words could drag her out of
[46:38] that, then why do you think that God
[46:42] can't send a messenger in Satan's Eden?
[46:45] Amen. And fellowship with you and drag
[46:48] you out of depression and drag you out
[46:51] of anxiety and drag you out of fear.
[46:55] Amen. What is it? The power of this
[46:58] message is the pull of God. It's not the
[47:01] third push. It's the third pull. He's
[47:05] pulling you, dragging you into the
[47:07] presence of almighty God. Hallelujah.
[47:10] He's leading the way. He's leading the
[47:12] victory. He's leading the power. He's
[47:14] leading to anointing.
[47:17] The message has the power to take you
[47:20] there. Come on, Eagle. Spread your
[47:23] wings. There's a there's a wind that is
[47:25] coming in to the church of the living
[47:27] God, and it's an updraft. He's carrying
[47:30] you into the presence and the power.
[47:33] Hallelujah.
[47:34] It's a positive. It's a positive gospel.
[47:38] Amen. This message never came to make
[47:41] you somebody's prisoner other than Jesus
[47:45] Christ. It come to make you a free man.
[47:48] Amen. To soar into the presence of
[47:51] almighty God.
[47:53] Come on up here, church. You can't feed.
[47:56] Amen. on these things down there in
[47:58] Leodosa, but come on up a little higher
[48:01] where you got liberty.
[48:04] Amen. Hallelujah. The gravity of
[48:06] people's words. Don't weigh so much. No.
[48:11] In his presence. Hallelujah. The power
[48:15] of this gospel
[48:18] and take you out out of the hands of the
[48:20] enemy. Oh, if I had about an hour right
[48:22] here,
[48:25] you don't know what I got coming.
[48:29] It break the chains of corruption and
[48:31] unbelief.
[48:36] I don't mean to be overspiritual, but
[48:37] listen, there's more here than
[48:40] deliverance. Yes. There's more to this
[48:43] message than just coming out of
[48:45] something.
[48:48] There is. There's more coming, folks.
[48:50] Oh, hallelujah. Listen. Amen. Here it
[48:53] is. He's showing you that the gospel is
[48:55] pulling them. Now, Peter will say these
[48:57] words, and they're they're more
[48:59] important than we first thought. Peter
[49:02] said it in verse 20, verse one and 23.
[49:04] He said, "Being born again,
[49:07] not of corruptible seed, but of
[49:10] incorruptible
[49:12] by the word of God." Amen. What's he
[49:15] saying? Incorruption comes from the word
[49:18] of God. What's the mystery of the
[49:21] translation? That this corruptible would
[49:23] put on incorruption.
[49:26] Preparation for the translation comes
[49:29] through the word of God.
[49:32] Now, I just want to take a moment here
[49:34] as we as we transfer into this idea that
[49:37] the translation. Now, if you're saying
[49:39] the word translation, I want you to also
[49:41] recognize that brother Brandham directly
[49:43] try ties together Matthew 25 and 10
[49:48] virgins with the translation of the
[49:50] church. How many knows that
[49:53] directly? Now, I didn't get a lot of
[49:56] hands, so I'll just say it. Amen. The
[49:58] Bible says there were 10 virgins went
[50:00] out to meet the bridegroom, and five
[50:01] wise, and five are foolish, but they
[50:04] were all virgins. And every one of them
[50:06] but five was wise. And they had oil in
[50:08] their lamp. And they went out to meet
[50:10] the bridegroom. And the bridegroom came.
[50:14] And the ones that had oil went in. See
[50:16] the translation
[50:18] the going with the bridegroom. Do you
[50:21] see? They meant what what you're what
[50:24] you're hearing now. When you hear us
[50:26] read quotes and and and and some of you
[50:30] you it's amazing how how virgin you are.
[50:34] It it's now some of us has had to war
[50:36] through a lot. But some of you are such
[50:39] is so innocent in your That's right.
[50:42] that if brother Ray or myself, one of
[50:44] these wonderful brothers read a quote
[50:45] and it says the marriage has taken place
[50:48] here and we're going to the marriage
[50:50] supper. Y'all just say amen because
[50:51] brother Bram said it. Amen. But there's
[50:54] a lot of theologians in the message that
[50:58] can't just read that and just say amen.
[51:02] Yeah, that's right. A lot. A lot of
[51:06] trouble with that, right? Because we we
[51:09] realize now, I mean, it's so easy for me
[51:13] is that the of course there's a type
[51:16] when you go to heaven. It's a marriage.
[51:17] It's a type. But, Brother Brandham said,
[51:19] but really, it's just the marriage
[51:21] supper
[51:23] because the marriage took place here.
[51:26] Right now, now he he's likened this
[51:30] showing you that the marriage takes
[51:32] place here. See, when you marry him, how
[51:35] do you know how you marry Christ? How do
[51:36] you do it here? Brother Bam said he's
[51:38] the word. You're the hearer. And when
[51:42] you come together, the word and the
[51:44] hearer, it makes a union. Brother Bam
[51:46] called an invisible union. Amen. And
[51:50] that union is happens on the earth. And
[51:52] brother Brandham is elevating that to
[51:55] marriage in Revelations 19 under his
[51:58] ministry.
[52:00] I am Elisure.
[52:02] See, see, brother Biscll years ago, he
[52:05] said something so powerful I never
[52:06] forgot it. He said the church ages, he
[52:09] said, is the feminine, but the seals are
[52:12] the male. He said, and when you bring
[52:14] the two together, you got a wedding.
[52:16] See, the church was on the earth, but
[52:18] these seals were coming out of heaven.
[52:20] Now, now y'all, I don't have time to
[52:22] preach everything I know, but I I I just
[52:24] want y'all to realize this is the age of
[52:26] the astronaut,
[52:28] right? Amen. Do y'all know y'all's
[52:30] living in the age the first people that
[52:33] ever got married when the husband was in
[52:36] heaven and the bride was on earth, they
[52:39] actually had a wedding and they become
[52:42] man and wife. Amen. He was in the space
[52:44] shuttle uh space station up there and
[52:47] she's on the earth. Amen. and they had a
[52:49] wedding and they become married. Listen,
[52:51] they wasn't more married later. They
[52:53] were married right then. And listen,
[52:55] this bride is not going to be more
[52:58] married later. She's already married
[53:00] now. Let me let me let me just say this.
[53:03] He ain't leaving here with a flirt. He's
[53:05] not coming to pick up a girlfriend. He's
[53:08] not going to take a girlfriend home with
[53:09] him. He's taking a bride home with him.
[53:13] Somebody that's married.
[53:17] You're already wife. This is not an
[53:21] illegal relationship.
[53:25] [Music]
[53:27] No, this marriage is the beginning of
[53:30] the translation of the church.
[53:33] Hallelujah. That's right. Think of it.
[53:36] This this wise virgin represents the
[53:39] bride who was ready.
[53:42] Matthew 25 is clear. The five foolish
[53:45] didn't go in. Why? They wasn't ready.
[53:50] Why wasn't they ready? Read first
[53:52] Thessalonians 4. The Lord shall descend
[53:54] from heaven with a shout voice and a
[53:56] trump. Brother said that shout is the
[53:58] message
[54:00] getting the bride
[54:03] ready. See, without Malachi 4, you turn
[54:07] into the foolish virgin.
[54:10] You're not ready to go. Nobody prepared
[54:12] you to go. You don't know how you're
[54:14] getting there. You don't know what bus
[54:15] to take. You don't know what clothes to
[54:17] wear. You don't know where you're
[54:18] staying. You don't know where you're
[54:20] going. It's all a surprise event. You
[54:22] know why most people don't know? Cuz
[54:24] it's a need to know only basis.
[54:27] This is a top secret mission. And only
[54:29] need to know people are going. And if
[54:31] you're going to go in the rapture,
[54:33] that's the reason this message came to
[54:35] your house. It's the reason it came to
[54:37] your life because you needed to know how
[54:40] do I prepare before I go into heaven.
[54:44] Hallelujah. Oh yes, sir.
[54:47] Yes, sir. Sometimes, Ro, when you get
[54:50] ready to go on a trip, you start
[54:51] preparing a long time before you go,
[54:53] don't you? Amen. One of the big things
[54:54] you girls like to do is you got to get
[54:56] your clothes right. Right.
[54:58] Come on, church. Amen. Our our sisters,
[55:01] they got to get their clothes right.
[55:02] Yeah. And I'm glad they want to get your
[55:04] clothes right cuz it's it's right to
[55:06] look nice. It's it's a good thing. It's
[55:08] not a bad thing. Amen. And I think it
[55:10] only speaks of a bit of a symbol that
[55:12] this bride getting ready to go. In
[55:14] Revelations 19, it tells us she
[55:17] receives. Amen. Her righteousness is the
[55:20] fine linen of his word. Listen, there's
[55:23] a fine linen given to this bride that is
[55:26] more valuable than gold, than oil. It's
[55:29] more valuable than your traditions or
[55:30] your families. Listen. Amen. I know some
[55:33] of you wear expensive clothes, but there
[55:35] ain't nobody ever wore clothes that has
[55:38] the value of the clothes that had been
[55:41] given to this bride that she could be
[55:43] dressed in the royal garments. And
[55:46] listen, when you put on these garments,
[55:49] it puts a thing in you that you can
[55:51] break the laws of the universe and walk
[55:54] from one dimension to another. The law
[55:56] of sin and death, it ceases under the
[55:59] power of the clothes this bride wears.
[56:04] Hallelujah. What kind of clothes has she
[56:06] got on? And she can walk from one
[56:08] dimension to another. And she can walk
[56:10] in the darkest of all ages. And she's
[56:12] light.
[56:17] My Hallelujah, brother. Sorry y'all.
[56:20] Hallelujah.
[56:23] Oh, if I by myself
[56:33] Well, glory to God. Hallelujah. What an
[56:37] hour. Thank you, Jesus. The value,
[56:41] the value of this message. It's the most
[56:44] valuable thing that's ever come into
[56:47] your home. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[56:50] Hallelujah. It's the value of it.
[56:54] The value is just the fine linen of the
[56:57] bride of Jesus Christ.
[57:00] Hallelujah.
[57:02] And I'll say this, if God put value on
[57:04] it, don't you devalue it. That's right.
[57:08] That's right. Man said to me one time,
[57:10] why you reading all them quotes? Because
[57:12] they're valuable. Yes. That's right. You
[57:16] can't you can't find this anywhere else.
[57:20] Go ahead. And me and brother Josh
[57:22] Bennett was talking yesterday and we
[57:24] were just discussing some of the things
[57:26] and and we were discussing points in the
[57:28] word and he said it's so funny brother
[57:30] Wayne how that sometimes you find the
[57:32] same point about the same story
[57:36] and then we talk and it's amazing
[57:38] because we found the same point. I said
[57:40] I believe brother Josh God made the
[57:42] point and we're just finding it.
[57:46] That's the reason brother Ray and I mean
[57:48] we didn't know each other. I mean I mean
[57:50] I mean he was a grandpa before I even
[57:52] knew him.
[57:53] But when we got together, we believe the
[57:56] same message the same way, same quote,
[57:59] same understanding, same content. Amen.
[58:02] How do we do that? Because that one that
[58:04] was leading him was over there in
[58:06] Arkansas leading me. And he's right here
[58:09] this morning leading you. And he led
[58:11] you. And he led you. And he's still
[58:14] leading us. And in this place, there is
[58:16] a value to place upon this word. It's of
[58:20] the highest value there is.
[58:23] And I say God bless you this morning for
[58:25] being at the house of God, placing value
[58:28] upon hearing the word of God, upon
[58:31] tending the church, upon being a part.
[58:34] See, now the prophet tells us this has
[58:36] to happen so the bride could know her
[58:38] mate, the revealed word. That's right.
[58:40] See this blindness happened to the
[58:43] Gentiles
[58:44] so you could come in. And brother Bam
[58:47] says, "Watch, it's so clear that the
[58:50] reason they didn't see it because it
[58:52] wasn't the hour."
[58:54] And you couldn't understand these things
[58:57] because it wasn't the hour. But you see,
[59:00] now these thunders are revealing to
[59:03] bring revelations
[59:05] that will prepare you for a translation.
[59:09] Listen, I I want to say this as strong
[59:12] as I I know how. The rapture is a
[59:16] revelation.
[59:19] The rapture is a revelation.
[59:24] Do you see? It's revelation that brings
[59:26] you out of your discouragement. It's
[59:30] revelation that lifts you out. Amen.
[59:32] It's what picks you up. You was the same
[59:35] sinner sitting on the pew, but you heard
[59:37] the message. And revelation came said,
[59:40] "I'm saved." What else changed?
[59:44] Faith changed it right there. Sitting in
[59:47] your seat.
[59:49] That's right.
[59:51] Revelation. See, it broke open in the
[59:54] rapture to bring to you an
[59:56] understanding. Revelation. Brother
[59:58] Brandon said, "The bride of Christ will
[59:59] be waiting for the revelation of the
[1:00:01] rapture." Now, it is a revelation for
[1:00:03] the revelation is faith. Now, that's
[1:00:05] page paragraphs 65 and 66 of the
[1:00:07] rapture. If you're a student of brother
[1:00:09] Brandham, just turn over about two pages
[1:00:12] and he'll say, "Now, here's my
[1:00:14] revelation of it." Yeah.
[1:00:18] The bride is waiting.
[1:00:21] See, it wasn't the hour yet, but the
[1:00:24] bride is waiting. And two pages later,
[1:00:27] here's my revelation on it.
[1:00:31] Yeah. And people that was setting in
[1:00:33] them congregations so devalued that
[1:00:38] he wasn't from our school. Poor man. He
[1:00:42] don't have an education, you know. He
[1:00:44] just, you know, he's just a he's just a
[1:00:47] simpleton, you know, and watch his
[1:00:49] manners and things. He says heat and
[1:00:51] taint and tote and ferry and pool pit
[1:00:53] and you know
[1:00:59] the value of what was happening in their
[1:01:01] midst could not have a human value
[1:01:05] placed on it.
[1:01:08] Yeah. Right. And God was opening to them
[1:01:12] the greatest mystery in the earth of how
[1:01:16] the bride would escape the tribulation
[1:01:18] that's coming on the earth. Do you see?
[1:01:21] May may Brother Bam said it like this. I
[1:01:24] love how he says this one. May great
[1:01:26] faith be built translating faith that'll
[1:01:29] make the people ready for the
[1:01:32] translation. Amen. Now, now I'm not
[1:01:34] trying to just hammer these thunders,
[1:01:36] but I want you to see it's not a scary
[1:01:38] thing. This nothing to run from, folks.
[1:01:42] Seven thunders of Revelations in
[1:01:44] Revelations 10 is the message that you
[1:01:47] read.
[1:01:50] Put a definition on it. It's the
[1:01:51] message.
[1:01:53] Not the first part of the message. It's
[1:01:55] the third pull of the message. The seven
[1:01:58] thunders, brother Bam said, to show the
[1:02:00] bride how to prepare. Now what is a
[1:02:03] thunder? What does it mean? The thunder
[1:02:05] was the voice of God when the seal
[1:02:09] opened.
[1:02:10] It was God speaking on the mystery when
[1:02:13] it opened. Now what's it there to do?
[1:02:15] It's to build faith. Faith cometh by the
[1:02:17] hearing and the hearing of the word of
[1:02:19] God. This is the word of our season. The
[1:02:22] word of faith. The word of the hour.
[1:02:24] Brother Bam says it in spiritual food.
[1:02:26] He said, "I'd like to get you built up
[1:02:28] now in the holy oracles of God. the
[1:02:30] faith of this hour. Not faith to justify
[1:02:34] you, not faith to sanctify you only, not
[1:02:37] faith just to get you the Holy Ghost,
[1:02:39] but a faith that would translate you
[1:02:42] from one dimension to another. Oh my
[1:02:44] goodness. It's going to take more faith
[1:02:46] than any other age. This has to be a
[1:02:49] rapturing faith that will take you up.
[1:02:51] It's going to take a rapture message.
[1:02:53] That's why Luther can't put you in it.
[1:02:55] That's why Wesley can't put you in it.
[1:02:58] That's why Pentecost can't put you in
[1:02:59] it. It would take the messenger of
[1:03:02] Malachi 4. Come on now. And even more
[1:03:05] than Elijah, it would take the one he
[1:03:08] introduced.
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:13] You say, "Brother Wayne, what in the
[1:03:15] world?" Listen, I I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:03:16] declare a few things, and I have to do
[1:03:18] it from the scripture. 1 Corinthians
[1:03:20] 14:8. If the trumpet would give an
[1:03:22] uncertain sound, who shall prepare for
[1:03:25] the battle? Somebody said, "What battle
[1:03:27] are you preparing for?" Brother B said,
[1:03:28] "The coming of the Lord." It's a great
[1:03:31] battle. It's a great battle in the end
[1:03:33] time. It's a great battle of who is
[1:03:35] right and who is wrong and what the
[1:03:37] truth is and the confusion. But there
[1:03:39] has been a trumpet sound in this age. A
[1:03:41] seventh messenger sound has brought
[1:03:44] forth a sound of change.
[1:03:47] Glory to God. It's the change that is
[1:03:49] coming. That was a change in the music.
[1:03:52] That was a change in the rhythm. There
[1:03:54] was a change in the symphony. There's a
[1:03:56] change in what's about to happen. People
[1:03:58] have been living and dying and going to
[1:04:00] grace for years, but there's a change
[1:04:03] that is coming upon the earth and a
[1:04:05] prophet is causing the change.
[1:04:09] [Applause]
[1:04:11] Hallelujah. Amen. How how how can you
[1:04:14] prepare if I was up here saying, "Y'all
[1:04:17] need to store up a bunch of food and get
[1:04:18] you some gold and and get your get your
[1:04:20] get your electric set this way and get
[1:04:22] your boxes here and get online and order
[1:04:24] a bunch of rations and listen, get get
[1:04:26] cars that don't have electric uh and and
[1:04:28] and make sure you get off of the grid
[1:04:30] and hold my God. Let's take all the kids
[1:04:32] out of the schools and out of the public
[1:04:34] and out of the workplaces and let's go
[1:04:35] hide in the woods somewhere and let's
[1:04:37] build bunkers and caves."
[1:04:40] Men have took this message and come out
[1:04:42] with that.
[1:04:44] But if a trumpet would give an uncertain
[1:04:46] sound, how shall we prepare for the
[1:04:49] battle? That's not how you prepare to
[1:04:51] meet God. You would prepare in the words
[1:04:54] just as Esther was prepared to meet a
[1:04:57] king. This bride is prepared under the
[1:05:00] messenger of her hour. Come on. Brother
[1:05:03] Bam said she could be dressed in this
[1:05:05] word. Listen, I I know if and and I'll
[1:05:08] take some other things later. I just
[1:05:09] want to tie a few things in as we go.
[1:05:11] But listen, if this is the season of
[1:05:13] translation,
[1:05:15] we're we're watching spring things ain't
[1:05:17] the same.
[1:05:19] They ain't the same now. And nobody can
[1:05:22] at times you don't know if it's winter.
[1:05:24] You don't know if it's spring. You don't
[1:05:26] know if it's summer. Cuz everything's
[1:05:28] mixing. All the laws are shifting around
[1:05:31] and the wind blows one way and the Amen.
[1:05:34] Y'all know what I Everything's all odd,
[1:05:36] but if you got a calendar,
[1:05:40] you can declare the season, no matter
[1:05:43] the weather, because the calendar is
[1:05:46] telling us how this is going to go. And
[1:05:48] I don't care what it looks like. The
[1:05:51] season is transition. The season is
[1:05:53] translation. There's a rapture upon this
[1:05:56] bride. I don't care if you're high or
[1:05:59] low. I don't care if you're old or
[1:06:01] you're young or you're troubled or
[1:06:03] you're victory. It is rapture season.
[1:06:06] It's transition season. Listen, when
[1:06:08] things begin to transition, laws begin
[1:06:11] to change.
[1:06:14] Things are abnormal.
[1:06:16] Things turn different. They things are
[1:06:18] different. There's transitioning.
[1:06:20] Presidents begin to There's
[1:06:22] transitioning things that happen and
[1:06:24] laws that are happening. And in this
[1:06:26] season of translation, there's laws of
[1:06:29] gravity and there's laws of sin and
[1:06:31] death. But there are laws that are
[1:06:33] breaking in on those laws. Hallelujah.
[1:06:37] If you don't believe it, read your
[1:06:40] prophet. Right? And he broke the laws
[1:06:43] and went to that sixth dimension. But
[1:06:45] Paul said it was unlawful.
[1:06:49] And he didn't come back and write a
[1:06:50] letter. He made a tape.
[1:06:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:57] He's open. He's changing the laws,
[1:06:59] folks.
[1:07:01] It's because it becomes a law. Do you
[1:07:03] see when it is these laws are broken,
[1:07:08] paradoxes begin to happen,
[1:07:12] if you want to prepare for something,
[1:07:14] don't prepare for tribulation.
[1:07:16] Prepare for paradox.
[1:07:18] Prepare for a miracle to happen,
[1:07:20] something to happen in your life.
[1:07:22] Listen, the if God could save you,
[1:07:24] wasn't that a miracle? If God could give
[1:07:26] you the Holy Ghost, wasn't that a
[1:07:27] miracle? If he could put you in church,
[1:07:29] wasn't that a miracle? Why are you
[1:07:31] stopping on those things? Why not go on
[1:07:34] into the greatest miracle with every
[1:07:37] revival that was divine healing? But the
[1:07:40] bride's revival, it'll end in a great
[1:07:42] divine healing. It ends in the changing
[1:07:45] of the body. Come on. It's the word. The
[1:07:48] miracle follows the word.
[1:07:51] We're not following the miracle. We're
[1:07:53] following the word. Amen. But if you're
[1:07:55] in the word, you're going to get the
[1:07:57] miracle.
[1:07:59] Glory. Thank you, Jesus. I believe it
[1:08:01] this morning. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:06] Now,
[1:08:08] now, Brother Bam said this and and and
[1:08:10] and I there's some things that require a
[1:08:14] lot more than we have to give to them,
[1:08:15] but I I want I want you to hear it. The
[1:08:18] people who follow the pillar of fire.
[1:08:23] Who is that?
[1:08:27] Y'all know why the magi was in the Bible
[1:08:30] and three magi. Brother Bam said, "I
[1:08:33] always wondered why they were in
[1:08:35] scripture." He said it was to give a
[1:08:36] type that there would be people that
[1:08:40] would follow a supernatural light.
[1:08:46] The children of Israel follow that same
[1:08:48] light.
[1:08:50] Then the children of Malachi 4 are
[1:08:52] following that same light.
[1:08:56] And brother Brown makes it clear and he
[1:08:58] said people who follow that pillar of
[1:08:59] fire will certainly have a rough time.
[1:09:02] And haven't we? And haven't we? They
[1:09:06] will certainly have some hills and some
[1:09:08] deserts and some red seas. And they will
[1:09:10] certainly have some hard times. Yeah.
[1:09:13] Now, the reason I say that is if you're
[1:09:16] not expecting hard times, they'll
[1:09:18] surprise you and then you'll say, "Well,
[1:09:20] I thought we was going into rapture. It
[1:09:21] wasn't going to be no more hard times.
[1:09:24] No, no, no.
[1:09:26] If you're following this pillar of fire,
[1:09:28] sometimes it leads you through red seas,
[1:09:31] sometimes to better waters,
[1:09:33] it leads you to all kinds of places, but
[1:09:35] just make sure he's leading." Amen. And
[1:09:37] brother Bram said, "Listen, there'll be
[1:09:38] a rough time, but they're ready for
[1:09:41] translation at the time.
[1:09:44] If they follow this pillar of fire, they
[1:09:46] may have a rough time, but they'll be
[1:09:48] ready at the right time."
[1:09:53] Glory,
[1:09:54] Gracie.
[1:09:56] you know, years ago before she was
[1:09:59] married and understood all these
[1:10:01] important facts of life, she was just a
[1:10:04] young girl running around with her dad,
[1:10:05] you know, and we were down at down at
[1:10:07] brother Homer Longoras. And Homer lives
[1:10:10] about a half hour from town. I was
[1:10:11] staying there in No Hatchee or no up in
[1:10:14] town aniston, I believe it is. And
[1:10:16] there's a little western sizzling around
[1:10:18] the corner. I think they have got
[1:10:20] Homer's name uh uh tagged in that table.
[1:10:23] I think he comes there every day. and uh
[1:10:25] it's about a half hour from his house,
[1:10:26] so he knows just how long it takes. So
[1:10:28] me and Gracie was there and we were
[1:10:30] preaching a I think we were preaching a
[1:10:32] Saturday night fellowship, Sunday
[1:10:33] morning service. And the Saturday
[1:10:35] morning before the service, he calls me
[1:10:37] up in the midm morning. He said, "Hey,
[1:10:39] brother Wayne." He said, "Look," he
[1:10:40] said, "I'm just about to leave the house
[1:10:41] here." He said, "Uh, I'm going to head
[1:10:43] over to that western sizzling down in
[1:10:45] town." He said, he's just one of them.
[1:10:47] He said, "Uh, I'll phone you when I get
[1:10:50] close." He said, "Y'all go ahead and get
[1:10:52] ready and stuff." So I said, "Okay." So
[1:10:53] I got off phone. And I'm studying there
[1:10:55] at the desk and Graciey's behind me and
[1:10:56] I'm not sure what she was doing, but she
[1:10:58] was just there on the couch and and I
[1:11:00] said, "Hey, Gracie. Brother Homer will
[1:11:01] be coming in a bit." Well,
[1:11:05] about a half hour later, the phone
[1:11:06] rings. It's Brother Homer. He said,
[1:11:09] "Hey, I'm I'm just about there. You
[1:11:10] ready?" And I turned and looked and
[1:11:12] Gracie was still right there.
[1:11:15] And I said, "Honey,
[1:11:19] why didn't you get ready?" She said,
[1:11:20] "Well, Dad," she said, "look." She said,
[1:11:23] 'You said that he was going to phone us
[1:11:25] and we was going to get ready.'
[1:11:29] I said, 'Well, honey, couldn't we got
[1:11:32] ready and waited
[1:11:37] instead of waiting
[1:11:40] to get ready?
[1:11:44] Now, that cannot define my daughter
[1:11:46] today. She's always ready.
[1:11:52] That sermon may have did it.
[1:11:56] And not only I've used it, I've heard it
[1:11:58] around the world now.
[1:12:02] See, you you you want to get ready and
[1:12:06] wait.
[1:12:09] Don't don't don't put off getting ready.
[1:12:13] You can do that right now.
[1:12:16] Get ready. Get ready for change. Get
[1:12:19] ready for the move. Get ready for the
[1:12:22] power of God. Get ready. And when you
[1:12:24] begin to get ready, listen, that getting
[1:12:26] ready, Amen, will make you Amen. It'll
[1:12:29] make the waiting better. I'll tell you
[1:12:30] that. But when you're when he calls, you
[1:12:33] can answer. Listen. See, it's it it
[1:12:36] takes it takes a getting ready. Now, the
[1:12:38] Bible tells us here very plainly that
[1:12:41] Enoch was translated that he should not
[1:12:43] see death because God translated him
[1:12:48] before his translation. Somebody say
[1:12:50] before. Before before his translation he
[1:12:54] had this testimony that he pleased God.
[1:13:00] But without faith it is impossible to
[1:13:02] please him. For he that cometh to God
[1:13:04] must believe that he is and a rewarder
[1:13:06] them that diligently seek. Watch now.
[1:13:08] Before he was translated,
[1:13:11] he pleased God. Before he was
[1:13:13] translated, he was ready.
[1:13:16] He He was ready. He was pleasing. See,
[1:13:18] he was walking in revelation and in
[1:13:20] faith. Now, Brother Bam does us a
[1:13:23] tremendous favor here. And he ties
[1:13:25] together Enoch's translation with the
[1:13:28] adoption of the church. How many knows
[1:13:29] he does that? He literally ties together
[1:13:33] Enoch's translation with the with the
[1:13:35] with the adoption of the church. And he
[1:13:37] says this. He says, now Enoch had a
[1:13:40] testimony by faith that he pleased God.
[1:13:42] And the Bible said without faith. He
[1:13:43] says, you've got to have the same kind
[1:13:45] of faith that you believe and know. Now
[1:13:47] in here you him, brother Bam says it
[1:13:49] like this. He said see that's exactly
[1:13:51] where this church has got to be. Jesus
[1:13:53] was always about his father's business.
[1:13:56] Not the carpenter Joseph but the father
[1:13:59] the word. He was doing the father's
[1:14:01] business now doing this and the church
[1:14:04] becomes to do it but it's about the
[1:14:06] father's business. And Jesus had this
[1:14:08] testimony that I always do that which
[1:14:11] pleases the father. Didn't he say that?
[1:14:14] And Enoch before his translation, he
[1:14:16] walked with God 500 years and had a
[1:14:19] testimony that he pleased God and he was
[1:14:21] a type of the raptured church. Then a
[1:14:24] child, see, God has to raise up another
[1:14:26] child. If Pentecost fails, God's able
[1:14:30] these stones to raise children out of
[1:14:31] Abraham. God can call them from the
[1:14:33] Lutheran and from the Baptist and the
[1:14:35] Presbyterians, and God's able these
[1:14:37] stones to rise children to Abraham.
[1:14:39] Somebody's going to get the vision.
[1:14:42] Somebody's going to see this vision.
[1:14:44] Amen. Now watch, brother Benham. He says
[1:14:46] it here you him. He says it now watch.
[1:14:48] He said now watch Luther raising up a
[1:14:50] Methodist and raising up a Nazarene,
[1:14:52] raising up pilgrim holiness, raising up
[1:14:54] a Pentecost. He will keep raising and
[1:14:57] raising until he gets one. Yes, sir. I
[1:15:01] hope to live to see a church when she
[1:15:03] rises in power and the beauty of the
[1:15:05] resurrection with the powers of God
[1:15:07] working through her, signs and wonders
[1:15:09] following and the believers like that in
[1:15:11] the New Testament. Do you see? He's
[1:15:13] telling you very clearly, somebody's
[1:15:15] going to walk with this message.
[1:15:19] Somebody's going to walk with the word
[1:15:21] of God of this age. But I I I I'll just
[1:15:23] cut to the chase of this. How is it that
[1:15:26] you could walk with something that
[1:15:27] wasn't here?
[1:15:29] I don't care how hard the Pentecostals
[1:15:31] prayed. They could not walk with what
[1:15:34] you're walking with because it wasn't
[1:15:36] revealed yet. I them them Jews over
[1:15:39] there are praying night and day, but
[1:15:42] they can't see what you're seeing
[1:15:44] because it ain't open to them. But one
[1:15:47] of these mornings, it'll become real to
[1:15:49] them and they will be able to walk with
[1:15:51] the same revelation you walk with. Amen.
[1:15:54] And the Lutherans couldn't walk with it
[1:15:55] and the Pentecostals couldn't walk with
[1:15:57] it. But think this morning of a bride
[1:16:00] who could walk worthy with her Lord in
[1:16:03] the presence of God this morning. The
[1:16:05] value of this message is it puts you in
[1:16:08] step with God.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah. It puts you in step with
[1:16:12] God. Listen, you you know how people
[1:16:14] march, you know, and you watch people
[1:16:16] get out of step. Brother Ram said he saw
[1:16:17] that bride getting out of step and what
[1:16:20] a prophet.
[1:16:22] What a prophet. He knew visions, right?
[1:16:25] He knew visions had to come to pass. And
[1:16:28] he corrected the vision.
[1:16:32] N y'all didn't get it.
[1:16:36] He corrected the vision.
[1:16:41] He put her in step.
[1:16:45] Get back in line. Look what he done. He
[1:16:49] wouldn't let the vision go without the
[1:16:52] bride walking in step. Somebody's going
[1:16:54] to get that vision. Somebody's going to
[1:16:57] see that this message puts us exactly in
[1:17:00] step with God. He says, "Step this way.
[1:17:03] Walk this way." And that's exactly the
[1:17:05] way this bride is going to walk. And
[1:17:07] she's going to step. Brother Brandon
[1:17:08] calls it a harmony. It'll put the bride
[1:17:11] in harmony. Listen, let me let me just
[1:17:13] let me just finish saying here a few
[1:17:15] things in this finishing thought. Amen.
[1:17:17] That this bride, unlike the first Eve,
[1:17:20] Brother Bram said, who failed by
[1:17:22] corruption. Do you know that it's
[1:17:24] actually impossible for this bride to
[1:17:26] commit adultery?
[1:17:29] You can't commit adultery because you're
[1:17:32] already pregnant. He can't take a hold
[1:17:34] of you. The womb of life is closed to
[1:17:38] anything else. You're already his by
[1:17:40] predestination. And the seed has to come
[1:17:43] to life and no world can get in. Oh, if
[1:17:46] we'd stay on that for an hour, I'm sure
[1:17:48] you'd understand. He's already finished
[1:17:50] it. The seed was there. The seed was
[1:17:53] already when was it put there? Before
[1:17:55] the foundation of the world, he's
[1:17:57] predestinated you unto eternal life. And
[1:18:00] as soon as that lifegiving flow, that
[1:18:03] seed, he said, other seeds just would
[1:18:06] come in, but wouldn't take hold.
[1:18:12] My God, I'm so glad they couldn't take
[1:18:14] hold. They would come in, but they
[1:18:16] couldn't take hold. You just couldn't do
[1:18:19] it. But when that seed come in quickly,
[1:18:22] he stopped up the womb and the rest of
[1:18:24] the seeds were driven out. My goodness.
[1:18:27] And this message is driving out every
[1:18:29] unbelief and every seed of man, every
[1:18:32] denominational seed, every antichrist
[1:18:34] seed, every Lutheran and Baptist and
[1:18:36] Pentecostal idea. The message is shoving
[1:18:39] them out of your life. It is translation
[1:18:43] time. Thank you, Jesus. My goodness, she
[1:18:47] can't commit adultery.
[1:18:49] I'm skipping a lot to say some of these
[1:18:51] things here very quickly.
[1:18:54] Now, you said, "Brother Wayne, you're
[1:18:57] you're forecasting a huge a huge move, a
[1:19:00] huge thing." I am.
[1:19:04] But the power to do it is not coming.
[1:19:11] The power I'm talking about is in this
[1:19:14] room right now.
[1:19:19] Amen.
[1:19:22] I'm not announcing something that's on
[1:19:24] its way. Oh, glory. I'm announcing that
[1:19:27] something that is already here. And a
[1:19:30] prophet will say it very clearly. He
[1:19:32] said, you have already been translated
[1:19:35] into heavenly places with Christ Jesus.
[1:19:38] Not you will be. You are right now
[1:19:41] translated. You say, "Preacher, what are
[1:19:44] you talking about? My body's here, but I
[1:19:46] ain't here. Oh, hallelujah. It's Bible,
[1:19:50] folks.
[1:19:51] In the spirit realm, you're already
[1:19:54] seated in a heavenly place in Christ.
[1:19:58] Brother Bram said, "They're filled.
[1:19:59] Every fiber fiber of your body is filled
[1:20:02] with the Holy Ghost fibers and beings
[1:20:04] has already been preserved of God. There
[1:20:06] is a glorified body waiting. And all you
[1:20:09] have to do as soon as this is over is
[1:20:11] those that he has justified, he has
[1:20:13] already glorified.
[1:20:16] In the Easter Seal, we said the Holy
[1:20:17] Spirit is here to find you. And when it
[1:20:20] finds you, you recognize its call. You
[1:20:24] know the hour you're living. You know
[1:20:26] these things are supposed to happen. And
[1:20:28] quickly, you're raptured up to
[1:20:34] either he's a prophet or he ain't.
[1:20:37] Yeah. Right.
[1:20:39] And he's telling me that I'm already on
[1:20:42] my way.
[1:20:44] He's telling me that the translation
[1:20:46] power has already got a hold of me. It's
[1:20:50] already seated me in a place where
[1:20:53] Christ is king. It's already seated me
[1:20:55] in a place where my soul can never reach
[1:20:58] death no more. I have already died and
[1:21:01] passed from death to life and cannot
[1:21:03] come into condemnation. Listen, if if
[1:21:05] you want to say it openly, my soul has
[1:21:08] already reached where my body's going.
[1:21:11] There's just going to be one of these
[1:21:13] mornings that this body can't hold this
[1:21:15] soul no more. And there's a change
[1:21:17] that's going to come over the church of
[1:21:19] the living God. This is the season for
[1:21:22] it.
[1:21:25] Brother Bam says it's already changed
[1:21:27] your affections. What it's done to your
[1:21:29] mortal bodies, it changed your opinions.
[1:21:32] Come on, anybody? Is the message ever
[1:21:34] changed the opinion you have?
[1:21:37] It already changed your opinion. And
[1:21:40] honestly, sometimes that's the hardest
[1:21:41] thing to change.
[1:21:43] But it already changed your opinion. It
[1:21:46] changed your notions. And it took your
[1:21:49] affections and set them on things above.
[1:21:52] Amen. And smoking and drinking and
[1:21:55] gambling and them things you used to do
[1:21:57] is dead and they're beneath you.
[1:22:00] You say, "Preacher, what happened? And
[1:22:02] the Easter Seal, Brother Brand said,
[1:22:03] "The quickening power has brought your
[1:22:06] body into a raptured condition already."
[1:22:10] My goodness. Amen. You said, "Brother
[1:22:13] Wayne, what in the world are you talking
[1:22:14] about?" I'm talking about eating a
[1:22:16] message this morning that is changing
[1:22:18] the way I think, the way I feel, the way
[1:22:20] I act, the way I talk. It changes my
[1:22:23] opinions, my affections, my life. It has
[1:22:25] already delivered my soul. And the
[1:22:28] message that delivered my soul is going
[1:22:30] to deliver my body. Why would God live
[1:22:33] it half done? He's not a halfway God.
[1:22:37] Somebody said, "Well, I know somebody
[1:22:38] passed. Brother Johnson just passed and
[1:22:40] he looked for the rapture." That's all
[1:22:41] right. Don't you know the prophet of God
[1:22:43] said if you go to sleep waiting on him,
[1:22:45] he'll wake you up in the same
[1:22:47] expectation you went to sleep. He's not
[1:22:49] going to wake up differently than he
[1:22:51] went to sleep. He went to sleep looking
[1:22:53] for the coming of the Lord. And when he
[1:22:55] wakes up, he'll be the coming of the
[1:22:57] Lord. Amen. I tell you something this
[1:22:59] morning. There is a translation power in
[1:23:02] the hearing of the gospel. There is a
[1:23:04] translation power in the eating of this
[1:23:06] message. Let me ask you very clearly.
[1:23:09] Where else could you go to get
[1:23:11] translation?
[1:23:15] Where else could you go to get
[1:23:17] translation? I'm going through some good
[1:23:19] stuff right now. Sorry.
[1:23:23] bar time.
[1:23:25] No, you don't mean it.
[1:23:30] This is 4:00 stuff right here.
[1:23:37] It becometh us to fulfill righteousness.
[1:23:38] Brother Bam said, "In the days of Enoch,
[1:23:41] just before the flood, Enoch looked out
[1:23:44] there and saw Noah building an ark. And
[1:23:46] Enoch was a prophet. And Enoch knew he
[1:23:49] was a type. And he knew before the
[1:23:52] floods came that he had to give an
[1:23:54] example. And one afternoon he come
[1:23:56] become to take a walk and it becoming to
[1:23:59] him that he had take this walk with God.
[1:24:01] And somehow the day he changed his path
[1:24:04] instead of going around the side of the
[1:24:05] hill, he took the king's highway and he
[1:24:08] just kept walking.
[1:24:09] 500 years he walked with that God. But
[1:24:12] that morning they just took a different
[1:24:15] route.
[1:24:18] He was walking with him every day. Wow.
[1:24:22] It wasn't a visitor.
[1:24:26] It was a daily companion.
[1:24:29] And they just took a different path.
[1:24:33] I bet when they took that one, Enoch
[1:24:35] looked over and says, "This the one Adam
[1:24:36] walked out of."
[1:24:40] It leads right back where Adam come out
[1:24:43] of. Instead of going out of the hill,
[1:24:45] they went on the king's highway. Brother
[1:24:47] Ram said, "There it is." See, Enoch
[1:24:49] knowed it was becoming of him to be a
[1:24:51] prophet. That's right. He says, "What is
[1:24:53] it?" He said, he said, "There it is."
[1:24:56] They said unto him, "Where you going?"
[1:24:58] He said, "I'm just going to take a
[1:24:59] little walk." Yes, he was going for a
[1:25:01] stroll. He didn't want to leave, but it
[1:25:04] was fulfilling of him to fulfill the
[1:25:05] type. He was a type of this church.
[1:25:09] Now, I I say this morning, if you're
[1:25:11] following the pillar of fire, you're
[1:25:12] walking with God, you're walking this
[1:25:14] message, you're doing something that
[1:25:18] many times has become unconscious faith.
[1:25:23] Not all of your faith is conscious all
[1:25:25] the time.
[1:25:27] Sometimes you're operating an
[1:25:29] unconscious faith. Just like uh brother
[1:25:32] Bram explains it simply. He said, "You
[1:25:34] get up in the morning, go out and start
[1:25:35] your car. Yeah, right. You don't even
[1:25:37] expect it to not start. Unless you drive
[1:25:40] a Ford, you know.
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:44] Sorry.
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:49] If it's a GM, you can have faith.
[1:25:54] Oh, yeah. Somebody said, "Well, Brother
[1:25:56] Bram had a Ford, but in the end, he had
[1:25:57] a Cadillac
[1:26:00] after the opening of the
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:05] Lordy Jesus. Let's have a prayer meeting
[1:26:08] in the church.
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:11] I'm sorry. I'm
[1:26:15] It's a
[1:26:18] It's unconscious.
[1:26:20] He drives a Toyota. He don't care.
[1:26:24] It's an unconscious faith. And brother
[1:26:27] Bam said, "I've learned as I traveled
[1:26:28] around the world meeting these," he
[1:26:30] said, "Faith is unconscious.
[1:26:33] You've got faith and you don't even know
[1:26:35] it."
[1:26:38] Now, think about this. The faith of the
[1:26:41] ages, the faith of translation,
[1:26:44] the faith of change
[1:26:46] is residing in you. And you may be
[1:26:50] totally unconscious,
[1:26:52] right, of what really is laying there. I
[1:26:55] I I I've I've I've studied this in depth
[1:26:57] at one time and you go go study it. But
[1:26:59] but brother Brandham simply would be in
[1:27:02] a prayer line or like he would be on the
[1:27:04] platform and he'd turn over and discern
[1:27:06] somebody and he'd say, "You got more
[1:27:07] faith than you thought, don't you?"
[1:27:10] Remember he'd say that. He said, "You
[1:27:11] were a bit unconscious of that, but that
[1:27:13] faith was and then he would point that
[1:27:15] out and he would bring that faith up
[1:27:17] that was already in them. Do you see?
[1:27:20] Faith is unconscious. And brother Bam
[1:27:21] says, "Listen, Jesus Christ, no matter
[1:27:24] if he was in a storm or gale, knocking
[1:27:25] the boat one side to the other. He was
[1:27:27] standing in the face of a mess of
[1:27:29] demons. If he was hanging anywhere, if
[1:27:31] he never, it never moved him. He walked
[1:27:34] along just as calm and as quiet as he
[1:27:36] could be. He was simply unconscious of
[1:27:39] fear.
[1:27:41] There you go. Simply unconscious of
[1:27:43] fear."
[1:27:45] He says, "My, that's right. whether it
[1:27:49] was going to happen or whether it wasn't
[1:27:51] going to happen. He knowed if it was
[1:27:54] going to happen because God said so. And
[1:27:56] if he didn't say, "Oh, I wonder if I
[1:27:59] prayed through. I wonder if I fasted
[1:28:01] long enough. I wonder if I did this." He
[1:28:03] just walked unconscious.
[1:28:05] That's right. He believed that God said
[1:28:08] it was the truth and the words must be
[1:28:11] fulfilled and he knew his life was to
[1:28:15] fulfill them.
[1:28:17] My goodness. You see where revelation
[1:28:20] places you? My life is to fulfill these
[1:28:24] words God spoke. Now you can you can
[1:28:27] become unconscious and just walk. And
[1:28:29] watch what Brother Bam says. You're here
[1:28:31] to fulfill it, too. So you can walk
[1:28:33] unconscious of fear. You can walk
[1:28:36] unconscious of criticism. You can walk
[1:28:39] unconscious of the world. You can walk
[1:28:41] as you walk in Christ. Walk with him.
[1:28:44] Not paying any attention to your left
[1:28:46] hand or your right hand. If something
[1:28:48] comes up in the church, walk with God.
[1:28:51] Hallelujah. If sickness strikes you,
[1:28:54] walk with God. If a neighbor don't like
[1:28:56] you, walk with God. Just keep walking
[1:28:59] with God. Enoch walked like that. You
[1:29:02] know what he done? He walked all the way
[1:29:04] home with God. He got so far up the
[1:29:06] road.
[1:29:08] My goodness, folks. Do you hear how he
[1:29:10] got there? Yeah, he just kept walking.
[1:29:14] Hey, have you ever had to walk a long
[1:29:16] distance and you just keep walking and
[1:29:17] after a while you're further up the road
[1:29:19] than you thought and the devil's still
[1:29:21] trying to tell you you got a long ways
[1:29:22] to go and here you have been in the
[1:29:24] message 15 years or 20 years. Amen. And
[1:29:27] he can't take all that away from you cuz
[1:29:30] you're already further up the road than
[1:29:32] you thought. Look what he said. Just
[1:29:34] keep walking. Enoch walked with that
[1:29:36] when walk with that. Walk with God. If
[1:29:38] the doctor says you're going to die,
[1:29:40] just walk with God. If the doctor says
[1:29:43] says, "Well, you can't." Well, just walk
[1:29:44] with God. That's all. For God promised
[1:29:47] you, "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[1:29:49] forsake you. I'll be with you to the end
[1:29:51] of the world." He took an oath by the
[1:29:54] covenant that he gave and he confirmed
[1:29:56] it. Just walk with God. Listen. Amen. I
[1:29:59] believe this this morning. He says,
[1:30:01] "You're going to have your ups and
[1:30:02] downs, but don't you worry." Oh, glory.
[1:30:06] I'm preaching to you this morning.
[1:30:07] You're going to have your ups and downs,
[1:30:09] but don't you worry. You're going to go
[1:30:12] through the bride patches. You're going
[1:30:13] to go over sharp rocks. You're going to
[1:30:16] go over bluffs and down hillsides and up
[1:30:18] through the mountains and over the
[1:30:19] waters. But walk with God. It's a rough
[1:30:23] path, but you're walking with God.
[1:30:26] My when I think of it this morning,
[1:30:28] Amen. You You can have it, but it's a
[1:30:31] rough path, but walk with him.
[1:30:34] Walk with him this morning. Our
[1:30:36] musicians come walk with God. Amen. Oh,
[1:30:40] over the briars. And
[1:30:44] what if you could walk unconscious
[1:30:45] criticism this morning?
[1:30:49] Wouldn't that be something?
[1:30:52] People criticize you a little bit and
[1:30:55] man, that's heavy, ain't it? For a long
[1:30:57] time sometimes.
[1:31:00] You know how to you know how to take
[1:31:01] away the gravity of people's words? Get
[1:31:04] up there where gravity ain't.
[1:31:06] Hallelujah.
[1:31:08] Get on up there.
[1:31:11] And things get a lot lighter.
[1:31:16] That's the only way. That's the only
[1:31:17] way, folks.
[1:31:19] Just walk with God.
[1:31:22] Say, "Preacher,
[1:31:25] I I I want to walk with God." Let me
[1:31:26] tell you something straight.
[1:31:29] If you walk with God, you'll never walk
[1:31:30] the same again.
[1:31:33] It'll change it.
[1:31:36] It'll change it. It sure will.
[1:31:39] Jacob met him.
[1:31:43] Old guy wrestling with an angel.
[1:31:47] But when he left there,
[1:31:51] he didn't walk the same ever again. With
[1:31:54] every step it spoke, there had been
[1:31:57] change.
[1:32:00] Think about it.
[1:32:03] There had been change.
[1:32:07] The dead can't change without the
[1:32:10] presence of God.
[1:32:12] The living can't change without the
[1:32:14] presence of God. The sick can't be
[1:32:16] healed without the presence of God.
[1:32:19] Translation can't take place without the
[1:32:21] presence of God. That's right.
[1:32:25] If you desire to walk with God, you can
[1:32:27] do it today. Amen. The power to do it is
[1:32:30] here. Yes. The word to do it is here.
[1:32:34] There is a there is a way that you can
[1:32:37] walk with him this morning. Listen. And
[1:32:39] and as you walk with him, it's it's
[1:32:41] different now
[1:32:43] because this is under vision.
[1:32:46] Y'all remember one of one of the great
[1:32:48] stories that uh Brother Bram told. It
[1:32:51] wasn't a story. It was a vision. But one
[1:32:53] of the great visions that he told is
[1:32:54] there was a he it was I think it was the
[1:32:58] same time uh of Congressman Upshaw, but
[1:33:01] he was sitting there and he said there
[1:33:03] was a there was a young girl she blue
[1:33:05] colored girl was in the back and brother
[1:33:06] Bram said I see a vision
[1:33:10] he said and I see a girl going under an
[1:33:12] operation for her voice. Isn't it odd?
[1:33:15] It was her voice. He said going under
[1:33:17] operation for her voice and it has
[1:33:19] paralyzed her. He said I'll see her
[1:33:21] later. Brother Brandham said, "Her
[1:33:22] mother ran run to the front of the
[1:33:24] building and said, "Brother Brandham,
[1:33:26] that's my baby. That's my baby." He
[1:33:30] said, and she screamed out to him. He
[1:33:32] said, "Can she walk now?"
[1:33:36] Glory. And brother Bram said, "Just a
[1:33:37] moment."
[1:33:39] And you know what he said? He said,
[1:33:41] "Many people don't stay long enough for
[1:33:44] the second vision to strike." He said,
