[3:24] here Daniel CH 11 and verse
[3:27] 32 I'm skipped a whole chapter on on you
[3:31] um I'm I'm moving into inspiration here
[3:34] I I found some things that I just want
[3:36] to move forward into so but I I want to
[3:38] make this link here if I can Daniel chap
[3:41] 11 and verse
[3:43] 32 and such as do wickedly against the
[3:46] Covenant shall be corrupt by
[3:48] flatteries but the people that do know
[3:52] their
[3:53] God they shall be strong and do exploits
[3:58] let's just bow our hearts father we
[4:00] thank you this
[4:01] morning we thank you by the grace Lord
[4:04] that you have given us in this life and
[4:07] Lord we thank you for a wonderful place
[4:09] this morning to worship we thank you
[4:12] Father for the ministry Lord that you
[4:15] have placed here in True Word Tabernacle
[4:18] to lead and and Lord to give them Grace
[4:22] to stand through all these years Lord
[4:24] and we we give you honor and praise for
[4:26] that this morning Lord we we understand
[4:29] the trials the tribulations and Lord to
[4:32] see the grace that you have put there we
[4:34] give you praise and honor this morning
[4:36] Lord we want to thank you for a word
[4:38] Lord that has been sent into this
[4:41] dispensation and we ask you Lord this
[4:44] morning that Lord for your people that
[4:46] have gathered here in this place may you
[4:49] bless them Father may you take your word
[4:52] and may you open it to each Heart Lord
[4:54] that it may be an influence in their
[4:56] life and give them Grace father now Lord
[4:59] Lord we're asking you for these things
[5:01] today in the name of Jesus Christ we
[5:04] pray amen and amen God bless you as you
[5:08] be seated this morning uh I'm want to uh
[5:12] take from this this morning I want to
[5:13] talk to you about the exploits of
[5:16] Faith uh I I'm going to be making some
[5:19] uh a movement uh from Daniel here and
[5:23] I'm going to be moving towards uh the
[5:25] third pool I want to maybe take a couple
[5:27] Services coming very soon here from this
[5:30] point that I'm that I'm looking today so
[5:32] hold that in your mind that we're
[5:34] talking about something uh in the in the
[5:37] very near future we're going to to to
[5:40] examine these areas of Daniel 11 Daniel
[5:43] 12 with the ministry in the Endtime
[5:46] concerning the opening of the word and
[5:48] the Power released under that in Daniel
[5:51] chapter 11 uh he said they that do
[5:53] wickedly against the Covenant shall be
[5:55] corrupt by flattery but the people that
[5:58] do know their God shall be be strong the
[6:00] people that know their God uh shall be
[6:03] strong now according to Paul in the book
[6:07] of Ephesians Paul is the one that ties
[6:09] together the idea that the opening the
[6:12] eyes of the understanding or the
[6:14] bringing of knowledge is also the
[6:16] bringing of power so so it's uh you you
[6:20] can't separate power from understanding
[6:23] because there is power is in
[6:26] understanding when you uh when you go to
[6:28] it Ephesians chapter 1 we can read the
[6:29] 17th verse uh I did I don't know if I
[6:32] put that down if I did yeah for the god
[6:34] of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[6:36] Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[6:38] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[6:40] of him now if you read the rest of that
[6:43] text you'll find out that in the of
[6:45] course it moves directly to the power of
[6:48] the Cross and then the power of the
[6:50] Resurrection which was the exhibition of
[6:53] the power of God was in the power of his
[6:56] resurrection uh that's how God exhibited
[6:58] his power when you say the power of God
[7:00] it was exhibited in the resurrection of
[7:03] Jesus Christ so when God gets ready to
[7:05] exploit give exploits or give exhibition
[7:08] of power it is an exhibition in the
[7:10] resurrection of Jesus that is the power
[7:13] of God is in Resurrection now when we
[7:17] look at this and see that the Lord maybe
[7:19] he increase our understanding and when
[7:21] he does it releases a holy ghost
[7:25] boldness in the church when when true
[7:28] understanding of the word word comes
[7:30] into your heart it will release an
[7:32] increase of understanding will also
[7:34] bring a boldness because you know where
[7:36] you're standing if you're not sure about
[7:39] something uh you'll be a little flaky
[7:41] concerning the point but if you know
[7:43] exactly where you're standing now you
[7:45] you know what I'm talking about you've
[7:47] argued with your brothers and your
[7:48] sisters maybe you got siblings at home
[7:50] and if you don't really know where
[7:52] you're at you back out of it but if you
[7:53] know you're right and you know where
[7:55] you're at it it it brings a different
[7:57] tenacity out of the person you know
[7:59] because there's a there's vigorous uh I
[8:01] know where I'm standing you know and
[8:03] that's and that's the thing is that when
[8:05] God sets the church in a place that they
[8:08] can understand then there's a boldness
[8:10] that's released and then the Unseen it
[8:13] brings it to the seene the things that
[8:15] are unseen or un uh uh out there in the
[8:18] fog it brings them to the scene and then
[8:21] it brings you understanding it'll bring
[8:23] you from glory to glory understanding
[8:27] will actually bring you into a an
[8:30] understanding beyond the current measure
[8:32] of where you are when understanding it
[8:34] level brings the level up or the measure
[8:37] of it the measure of your knowing him
[8:39] which takes the limitations off of your
[8:42] life and all of a sudden the
[8:44] understanding of God will make you
[8:46] understand that things that are
[8:47] impossible become possible and the
[8:50] deeper knowledge you have of God things
[8:52] are unlimited things are completely
[8:54] become impossible to you because there's
[8:57] no word that God speaks that that is
[8:59] void of power there's no way that God
[9:01] can say something that is void of power
[9:04] such as when that when the Gabriel
[9:06] talked to Mary and he said Thou shalt
[9:08] have a child and not know it a man and
[9:10] she said this is impossible basically
[9:12] and he says back to her but all things
[9:14] are possible with God Amen so in that
[9:17] translation of that in the Greek
[9:19] actually means that no word spoken is
[9:22] void of power so when God says something
[9:25] it has the power of fulfillment with it
[9:28] then when you bring the understanding of
[9:30] the word it releases the power of
[9:32] fulfillment in the life of the believer
[9:35] now uh the scripture says here in the
[9:37] Book of Daniel I found it very relevant
[9:40] that it says here that they the the
[9:42] people shall know their God now I'm I'm
[9:45] I guess maybe I I I I look into some of
[9:48] these things a little tightly because uh
[9:50] if this was speaking to just one
[9:52] individual it would say the person that
[9:55] knows their God shall do great exploits
[9:58] but the scripture doesn't read that it
[9:59] puts a plurality to them that know and
[10:02] them that do exploits so it's the
[10:05] plurality is the people now I'm not
[10:08] going to spend all the service on it but
[10:09] this we must understand that this is a
[10:12] body movement of the Bride of Jesus
[10:15] Christ so this isn't just a a holy man
[10:17] and and a People amen uh that's just uh
[10:20] enduring or just trying to watch the
[10:22] exercise and observation but it is God
[10:26] manifesting in the church now I say that
[10:29] because because there is an approach to
[10:30] the message of the hour that brother Ram
[10:32] done these things and that they're Way
[10:34] Out Of Reach of the bride of Christ but
[10:36] if God meant that then he would have put
[10:38] it in the scripture then he would have
[10:40] said well he that knows God he would
[10:42] have placed it in an individual but
[10:44] rather he placed it in a people which
[10:47] would mean an anointed body remember he
[10:49] said it was the anointed man but now
[10:52] it's the anointed people of God Amen now
[10:55] in saying that that that doesn't destroy
[10:57] the order of leadership of God by the
[10:59] way Brother Ray we're right behind
[11:01] you amen right behind you amen amen but
[11:04] but you see the direct order of of God
[11:07] Amen but but to say that that what's in
[11:10] the ministry or what's in the prophet
[11:12] would not be in the people would be a
[11:14] misstatement Amen in showing that God is
[11:17] Desiring a personal relationship with
[11:20] every individual in the church whether
[11:22] you're a widow woman whether you're a
[11:24] married woman whether you're a young
[11:26] girl or an older boy or teenager
[11:28] whatever you're state life is God
[11:30] desires an experience or a personal
[11:33] knowledge this is past the age of church
[11:37] you see it's the ending of the church
[11:39] age and it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[11:43] which is a personal knowledge amen of
[11:45] God it is that that people shall know so
[11:48] there is a is a body movement of Christ
[11:51] that the people shall know that they
[11:53] will know to know is to learn or to
[11:55] perceive it's the Hebrew word used here
[11:57] means to recognize or to admit to know
[12:00] by experience to acknowledge to confess
[12:03] to be acquainted with to know to be
[12:05] skillful with to have knowledge of to be
[12:07] known or to be revealed amen it's it's
[12:10] the acquaintance it's it's a known so we
[12:13] we we find out of course he wants people
[12:15] to know him so so in this age we're
[12:17] living no means Amen to some people
[12:20] joining Church uh uh no means that we
[12:23] read about him in the Bible remember
[12:25] brother Bram says it over and over he'd
[12:27] be talking scripture with a theologian
[12:29] and they say well brother BR you don't
[12:31] know much about your Bible he said well
[12:32] but I know the author real well amen
[12:36] I've read books written by man that I
[12:38] have never met don't know them at all I
[12:40] don't know what they like to eat I don't
[12:41] know what they like way they like what
[12:43] they drink or the way they live or the
[12:44] car they drive or the nature if I met
[12:47] them I would have no way to entertain
[12:49] them because I have no clue of their
[12:51] personality or their character I'm Li to
[12:53] serve them steak when they like chicken
[12:55] I don't know them I've read their book
[12:57] amen but here brother random was and I
[12:59] of course read his book he said but I
[13:01] have a relationship with the author in
[13:04] other words brother brandom knew how to
[13:05] entertain him when he came into the
[13:08] house of God now there's people sitting
[13:09] here today maybe not with a Biblical
[13:11] theological order of every teaching in
[13:14] the Bible but this church knows how to
[13:17] entertain God when he comes into the
[13:19] building they know what he likes they
[13:21] they know how to bring his presence and
[13:23] then to hold him in the room a little
[13:25] while I don't know about y'all but I
[13:26] don't want to see God come amen but I
[13:29] want to make an atmosphere he wants to
[13:31] stay a while when he comes I want to see
[13:33] God come in amen and then feel such a
[13:35] welcome and you've done it you went to
[13:37] somebody's house and left the car
[13:38] running outside and they have such a way
[13:41] about them that an hour later you're
[13:43] like I need to go shut the car off cuz
[13:45] it made you feel so welcome amen and and
[13:47] and to think that God would visit this
[13:50] generation and we make him feel so
[13:52] welcome here amen he comes weekly he
[13:55] every time we come together he comes and
[13:57] meets and and he'll over I oh God I've
[14:00] seen it amen we're leaving church people
[14:02] still in here praying rejoicing because
[14:05] of the entertaining because they know
[14:08] him they know his nature they know what
[14:10] he likes and the desire of him amen they
[14:13] know him amen the brother Bram said it
[14:15] like this he said now we want to know
[14:17] him after the power of his
[14:20] resurrection that's the way we want to
[14:22] know him is in the power of his
[14:24] resurrection Amen brother B says see uh
[14:27] uh to know him is to know him is to have
[14:31] life to know him is to have life now
[14:35] other things I don't know about maybe uh
[14:37] maybe I don't identify as a smart man
[14:39] Paradox brother brandom actually
[14:41] discussing something him and brother
[14:42] Billy Paul was talking about he said
[14:44] Billy Paul said something about a song
[14:45] on the radio and brother brand said what
[14:47] song and he said brother he Billy Paul
[14:49] said to brother brandom he said well you
[14:51] don't know very much about anything
[14:52] besides just Christ do you and brother B
[14:54] said well that's all I want to know
[14:56] about he said that's all I want to know
[14:58] and these other things things I don't
[14:59] know about maybe I'm not a smart man I
[15:01] don't want to be a smart man I want to
[15:03] know him I don't want to be a smart man
[15:06] I want to know him amen and he said Paul
[15:10] said in the power of his resurrection
[15:12] that when he calls me I will come out
[15:14] from among the Dead I want the kind of
[15:16] relationship that he'll call me and I'll
[15:19] come out of the Grave amen amen that's
[15:21] the way Lazarus knew him amen he had a
[15:24] fellowship with him that when he called
[15:26] he heard his voice and understood that
[15:28] he meant him Paul says in Philippians
[15:30] chapter 3 and the 10th verse that I may
[15:32] know him and the power of his
[15:35] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[15:36] suffering may be made comfortable uh uh
[15:39] conformable unto death now to know him
[15:42] is not to know him by the word
[15:44] only amen that's the Cry of the world
[15:46] today is to know Christ and he said Paul
[15:49] said we should know him and to know
[15:50] Christ is life and when we knew him in
[15:53] the power of his resurrection now not to
[15:55] know him by word not to know him by word
[15:58] that all right but that's a long ways
[16:01] from being sufficient to know him by
[16:03] word we got to know him by the person of
[16:06] his resurrection am how many people sat
[16:09] in brother braham's meetings and read
[16:11] the Bible with him and said they
[16:12] believed it completely but the moment
[16:14] they seen the sign of the Resurrection
[16:16] didn't believe that sign because they
[16:19] didn't know him he said had you known me
[16:21] had you been of Abraham you would have
[16:23] loved me you would have loved me the way
[16:26] Abraham acted you would have acted the
[16:27] same way had you really known amen but
[16:30] you see now so there can't be just a
[16:32] word only experience there has got to be
[16:35] an experience with the person of the
[16:37] Resurrection amen you must be born again
[16:40] 1961 brother bam said the true word
[16:42] comes to the true prophet and he tells
[16:44] you the true word and you'll follow the
[16:46] true word and you'll get a true
[16:49] experience of the word so you're not
[16:51] just knowing him in the word but the
[16:53] word has an experience to know him in
[16:55] the experience of the word because the
[16:57] word is made flesh in you and you become
[17:01] God's son so the power of the
[17:03] Resurrection is when the word comes into
[17:05] you and that word takes on life the word
[17:08] of God begins revolving right out of you
[17:10] because you are of his nature his Spirit
[17:13] and the works of God you will do in the
[17:15] shame 1965 brother R said we notice
[17:18] today amen people say well somebody says
[17:21] are you a Christian he says it's a very
[17:23] popular thing to say I'm a Christian but
[17:25] do you believe the word of God where it
[17:27] said these signs shall follow them that
[17:29] believe even ministers faces will begin
[17:32] to blush Are you ashamed to say of
[17:35] Divine Healing Are you ashamed of the
[17:37] Full Gospel Are you ashamed of a
[17:40] Pentecostal experience that's being
[17:43] ashamed of his word that's his word made
[17:46] flesh in you you see not just knowing by
[17:50] reading the word but an experience with
[17:52] the word means in a Pentecostal
[17:54] experience of knowing him in the power
[17:57] of his resurrection ction Amen in the
[18:00] upper room they were more than just
[18:01] reading about him they were experiencing
[18:04] him the light that had been in Jesus
[18:07] Christ was now in them in the power of
[18:11] the Resurrection Amen to receive the
[18:13] Holy Ghost is to receive an experience
[18:16] with god with a person with him to know
[18:19] his experience now I know people be you
[18:22] say the word Pentecost and they say well
[18:24] that's another age well the Pentecostal
[18:26] age was another age but Pentecost isn't
[18:28] experience and that was where we brother
[18:30] bam identified he said if we need
[18:33] ministers to preach the gospel and bring
[18:35] the church back to a Pentecost AG again
[18:37] or a Pentecost again excuse me bring
[18:39] them back to a Pentecost again we need
[18:42] ministers to preach the gospel and bring
[18:44] the church back to Pentecost again amen
[18:47] 1960 Eagle Ste his n we need preachers
[18:51] to preach the Pentecostal experience in
[18:54] the church amen I know people are
[18:55] getting shy of it because it it produces
[18:58] a mess and and people get messy amen but
[19:01] brother man said where is birth not a
[19:03] mess if it's in a hospital room if it's
[19:05] in your bedroom if it's in a b it
[19:07] doesn't matter it's always a mess and
[19:10] people today don't want the mess on
[19:12] their hand they don't want to deal with
[19:13] the babies they don't want to deal with
[19:15] the acts 238 tongue talking B they don't
[19:17] want to deal with somebody shouting and
[19:19] running the a so they're going to water
[19:21] it down and calm it down to just a word
[19:23] experience of reading and you believing
[19:26] but if you ever get the word of God
[19:28] it'll do do more than just believe it'll
[19:30] become a manifestation on the inside of
[19:33] you it'll shake things up amen it'll
[19:36] cause a mess in your home it'll cause a
[19:39] mess in your church it'll break the
[19:41] forms of your religion because God still
[19:44] uses the anointed word to change the
[19:47] lives of the people hey I tell you this
[19:49] I don't know about you but I welcome the
[19:51] experience of God to bring it to a hey
[19:54] man I love it to bring it to Pentecost
[19:56] again to bring it to an eagle experience
[19:59] there it is to bring it to an eagle
[20:01] experience we're not a bunch of
[20:03] Pentecostal chickens but we are eagles
[20:06] we are the Eagles of God we fly up there
[20:09] in a realm that man don't understand
[20:11] they don't know where we're getting our
[20:12] joy they don't know where we're getting
[20:14] our food they can't catch the Revelation
[20:17] they're in another age thinking about
[20:19] other things but we are having a
[20:22] Pentecostal experience in the bride age
[20:25] amen what is it we're moved by the Holy
[20:27] Ghost with power and with authority amen
[20:30] I tell you it's a experience it's Amen
[20:32] it's what the church needs we don't want
[20:34] to be chickens we want to be
[20:37] Eagles what the church needs is a is an
[20:40] eagle experience people say well I'm
[20:42] going to I want to be an eagle well to
[20:43] be an eagle it'll take a Pentecost
[20:45] experience people say well I I don't
[20:47] want to be the Shu brother bam said it's
[20:49] the wheat there's a Ministry on the
[20:51] earth that's just like the one that went
[20:53] into the ground back under a real
[20:55] Pentecostal experience the wheat and the
[20:59] eagle both is both a Pentecostal
[21:01] experience and I I've been around enough
[21:03] I understand that people use both eagle
[21:05] and wheat to explain why we don't have
[21:07] pentecost's experiences but it's a
[21:10] direct it is a direct contradiction to
[21:13] what a prophet
[21:14] taught see you can take a quote and take
[21:17] a Direction with that quote to make it
[21:18] mean something that it don't
[21:20] mean I tell you I'm not going in the
[21:22] direction of a bunch of dead formal
[21:24] church members I'm looking for the power
[21:27] of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ with
[21:29] an anointing with life and with truth
[21:32] amen amen I know we can take it the
[21:34] wrong directions but that's why we're
[21:36] directly behind a preacher that believes
[21:38] in the Full Gospel and the experience of
[21:41] God Amen this direction will end up in
[21:44] the changing of your mortal body it's an
[21:48] experience of the holy ghost power and
[21:50] anointing come on you're not going to
[21:52] read your way into no Rapture you're
[21:54] going to have to have an experience with
[21:55] a body changer somebody that can change
[21:58] your Adams if you don't even believe in
[22:00] Divine Healing how are you going to
[22:02] believe in a complete healing of the
[22:05] body I believe it ought to be preached I
[22:07] believe it ought to be believed and let
[22:09] the experience of God come in the church
[22:12] with anointing and with
[22:16] truth oh there's some people that
[22:17] believe they're
[22:19] God there's a people that know they're
[22:22] God yes sir they know him my sheep know
[22:26] my voice and a strange danger they will
[22:29] not
[22:30] follow amen yes sir do you say you said
[22:34] well preacher then does that separate it
[22:35] from the message brother B said it like
[22:37] this people that's believe in him know
[22:39] it unless they're constantly in the word
[22:42] now you can have an experience and not
[22:44] be a word experience you can have an
[22:46] experience and this is where it gets
[22:48] everybody because the Antichrist will be
[22:51] so close that the deceive the elected is
[22:53] possible so people ride that side of it
[22:56] and say even Antichrist speaks in
[22:57] tongues even the Antichrist has
[22:59] manifestations even the Antichrist but
[23:01] have you ever stopped to listen it said
[23:04] so much like it's so much like in other
[23:07] words the real believer that's what
[23:09] happens to him that's why they're
[23:12] impersonating it amen people well we
[23:14] don't want no dancing in the church
[23:16] because so and so danced and they fell
[23:17] into sin amen but you see what they were
[23:19] doing they were impersonating the real
[23:22] so if there is a if there is a false if
[23:25] there's an antichrist there is a real
[23:27] dance somewhere as a real shout
[23:30] somewhere as a real anointing somewhere
[23:33] I believe I'm in the middle of a bunch
[23:35] of eagles this morning and knows what
[23:37] the reality of the baptism of the Holy
[23:40] Ghost you won't sell us off as just a
[23:42] bunch of Pentecostals we are word born
[23:45] word believing Holy Ghost filled tongue
[23:48] talking Bible believing Church of the
[23:51] Living God and we will not apologize for
[23:54] it and we're not going to take it back
[23:57] and if I believe if it's morning I
[23:59] believe in the power of God for a
[24:02] reality do you see what it is amen now
[24:05] now if you're if you're can you can get
[24:07] experiences and them not be biblical
[24:11] experiences sure amen but when Peter did
[24:14] it he said this is that which Joel
[24:18] prophesied I tell you what it was a
[24:20] Bible experience they were
[24:22] having and the brother Ram says it like
[24:24] this he said the people believe in him
[24:26] how would they know him unless they're
[24:28] con stantly in the word to know what it
[24:30] is see if you get the right experience
[24:32] it'll put you in the word and while
[24:35] you're in the word you'll get a
[24:37] fellowship by the spirit to know what
[24:39] you're reading about remember remember
[24:42] the Bible said no man call me Lord
[24:44] except by the Holy Ghost unless a man's
[24:47] got the Holy Ghost all you're reading
[24:49] does you no good you're reading about
[24:51] somebody you're never going to meet and
[24:53] you can meet him and say I've cast out
[24:54] devils in thy name I've healed the sick
[24:56] in thy name he said but I never knew you
[24:59] I never knew you never knew me you never
[25:01] had that experience with me amen but now
[25:04] I I know that's what a prophet taught
[25:06] because what he said he said they
[25:07] prophesied my name he said there's the
[25:09] preacher he said preaching but denying
[25:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes him
[25:14] a worker of iniquity knowing to get it
[25:16] and won't go it he said then he's a
[25:18] worker of iniquity and never knew him
[25:21] amen now the people that believe him are
[25:22] constantly in the word now watch he's
[25:24] going to go directly he's going to go
[25:26] directly to the Book of Daniel he he
[25:28] said now that Daniel said the wise shall
[25:30] know but the foolish and unwise wouldn't
[25:32] know they shall know their God Amen and
[25:37] now how they shall know their God he's
[25:40] got a direct quote from Daniel he said
[25:42] how he said they shall know their God he
[25:45] shall appear in the last
[25:48] days now these people don't even believe
[25:50] in the appearing but he said he shall
[25:52] appear in the last days to bring him the
[25:55] people back to the word so that the
[25:58] bride will know her husband he will know
[26:01] her mate the revealed word the revealed
[26:06] word is the mate of the church amen it's
[26:09] the match experience it's the grace of
[26:12] God that's why this has to happen of
[26:14] course when the word is made flesh then
[26:16] it is the light of the
[26:18] age now if you if you like to look in
[26:21] scripture the Bible is is beautiful in
[26:24] the Book of Daniel the 12th chapter
[26:25] brother B will tie together Daniel 12
[26:27] and Daniel 11:32 and he'll type them as
[26:31] just one as one time generally he'll say
[26:33] them together like they're the same
[26:35] scripture but they're separate
[26:36] scriptures now in Daniel chapter 12 he
[26:38] said go thy Way Daniel for the words are
[26:40] closed and sealed up until the time of
[26:43] the end now it's a time period of when
[26:45] Daniel is going to predict the wise
[26:48] shall know their God now it's a time
[26:50] period of the end now watch's the next
[26:52] verse many shall be purified and made
[26:55] wide and tried but the wicked shall do
[26:58] do wickedly the wicked shall do wickedly
[27:01] and none of the wicked shall understand
[27:04] but the wise shall
[27:06] understand amen you you you see the wise
[27:09] shall understand now y'all I read this
[27:11] here to you hear while back in
[27:13] revelation 22 remember the angel that
[27:15] came to John in the in Revelation
[27:17] chapter 10 it said seal the seal it
[27:19] until the seventh angel but in
[27:21] revelation 22 it speaks and he said it's
[27:24] the time to unseal the book John
[27:26] remember and he said the wicked shall go
[27:28] on and be Wicked but the righteous shall
[27:32] be righteous Now read this the wicked's
[27:34] going to go on and be Wicked but the
[27:36] wicked amen they're going to do their
[27:38] works and will not understand but the
[27:39] wise shall understand the wise shall
[27:42] understand the righteous the wise shall
[27:45] understand the spirit of understanding
[27:48] has come upon them they know how the
[27:50] message pulls in the experience of the
[27:52] word and they understand that they
[27:55] understand that it takes an experience
[27:57] with God and a leadership in the word
[28:00] amen they understand the wise shall
[28:04] understand now watch because see the
[28:07] Bible said the people shall know their
[28:10] God now think of this because in Daniel
[28:13] chapter 12 again the Bible is speaking
[28:16] of end time and here um here in the
[28:20] verses of Daniel 12 you'll find Daniel
[28:23] asking the Lord about the end time and
[28:25] remember a man in White shows up on the
[28:27] water and I'm not taking time here
[28:28] because I went through this a month ago
[28:31] amen but when Daniel is asking about the
[28:33] end time he sees a vision of a man
[28:34] standing in white who's upon the river
[28:37] and then there's a man on the left and
[28:39] right brother B said who is the man in
[28:41] white on the water he said that's the
[28:44] Holy Ghost on the people in the end time
[28:48] watch the people shall know their God
[28:50] and do
[28:51] exploits the Holy Ghost shall be on the
[28:54] people they shall know their God and do
[28:58] exploits see the Holy Ghost is supposed
[29:01] to come on the people that's how they're
[29:04] going to do the exploits the Holy Ghost
[29:07] has got to come on you he said for I am
[29:10] the vine and ye are the branches and
[29:13] without me without the holy ghost coming
[29:15] on the people they will do
[29:18] nothing look at what he's saying he's
[29:20] saying that the the understanding would
[29:22] come to the church now here in uh
[29:24] beginning and ending of the dispensation
[29:26] brother R said what is the mystery of
[29:28] God it's the hope of glory shining forth
[29:31] this the baptism of the Holy Spirit now
[29:33] when these things take place time will
[29:35] be no more they that know their God he's
[29:37] going directly they that know their God
[29:39] in the last days many run to and fro but
[29:41] they know their God shall do exploits
[29:43] they shall do exploits exploits of Faith
[29:46] breaking around the world tonight over
[29:48] and over in all the nations in great
[29:49] campaigns blind or seeing deaf or
[29:51] hearing lames walking people of all
[29:53] works of Life are coming in and
[29:55] receiving the Holy Ghost not only the
[29:57] poor and the PO ER but the millionaire
[29:59] in everything God is taking and putting
[30:02] on this robe on each of them and giving
[30:04] them an invitation to the wedding
[30:06] supper again beginning and ending of
[30:09] dispensation morning Stars shouted for
[30:10] Joy the morning Stars shouted The
[30:13] Shining ones that shouted for Joy when
[30:15] they seen that someday the Tabernacle
[30:18] here on Earth and king mecdc would come

[30:25] outshine the Stars forever job where
[30:28] were you before the foundations of the
[30:31] world when the sons of God shouted for
[30:35] Joy now here brother bandham takes that
[30:38] shouting for joy and ties it to Daniel
[30:41] the 12th chapter for the righteous shall
[30:44] shine as the stars of the heaven amen
[30:47] he's showing you this shout religion is
[30:50] God's religion this is not a new
[30:53] religion brother they they were shouting
[30:55] in the church and they said brother
[30:56] Brandon what's this new religion he said
[30:58] this ain't a new religion this is the
[31:00] oldest religion there is in the Book of
[31:03] Job it said job where were you when the
[31:06] sons of God were shouting for Joy when
[31:10] the morning Stars sang together and the
[31:13] sun shouted for Joy I tell you you
[31:15] talking about a new song brother amen
[31:17] you you see that you were them morning
[31:19] stars and the sons of God shouting amen
[31:23] this Bible is not talking about just a
[31:26] general reference it was talking about
[31:28] your Worship in this generation them
[31:31] that know their God shall shine as the
[31:34] stars of their Heavens my they'll be
[31:37] there holding their place come on Church

[31:51] darkness is upon the Earth gross
[31:53] Darkness on the people but the light is
[31:55] shining upon the Church of the Living
[31:58] God my she's shining forth my we could
[32:01] say it this morning we could Twinkle
[32:03] Twinkle Little Star go ahead and shine
[32:05] tell the world what you are go ahead and
[32:08] break out and let the worship of God
[32:10] come off of your life that people will
[32:13] have to identify
[32:16] you if you if you read that abstract
[32:20] that that's talking about a different
[32:22] people a different time amen I want to
[32:25] assure you that was this time and you
[32:28] are the
[32:30] people I've got a couple quotes here
[32:33] that really nails that
[32:34] down in Christ The Mystery of course
[32:37] brother Ram talks about this is what's
[32:39] been revealed Amen in Revelation book of
[32:42] symbols brother Ram will take the Book
[32:44] of Revelations and he'll say this the
[32:46] mystery of God he says see what's
[32:49] happened he says the people has not been
[32:51] taught the mystery of
[32:54] God the book of uh uh of symbols and
[32:57] Revelations tells us that the Book of
[32:59] Revelations is for this time right now
[33:02] people will take and teach the word by
[33:06] letter again the letter
[33:12] kills but the spirit gives
[33:15] life now watch this he said the mystery
[33:18] of God they've not been taught the
[33:20] mystery of God people think they're
[33:22] teaching Mysteries and they surely are
[33:26] it's a mystery to me how they can take
[33:27] brother man made clear and Mumble it up
[33:30] till nobody can understand
[33:32] it it's a mystery you got to be a smart
[33:36] man to take something simple and make it
[33:37] so complex nobody can understand
[33:40] it amen do you see what he's saying the
[33:42] mystery of God they've not been taught
[33:44] the mystery of God they've been taught
[33:46] to join a church they've been been
[33:48] taught to put their name to be a good
[33:49] fellow to treat their neighbor right
[33:51] that's all right you must know the
[33:53] mystery of God and no man can reveal it
[33:55] to you except the one that has the book
[33:59] what is the mystery of God brother BR
[34:01] said what is the mystery of God it's God
[34:03] in you the hope of glory shining forth
[34:07] the baptism of the holy spirit amen to
[34:11] be taught the mystery of God is to be
[34:13] taught the holy ghost in the life of an
[34:16] individual Daniel saw this in Daniel the
[34:19] 12th chapter I'm from Revelation book of
[34:21] symbols it I don't have time to read
[34:22] through it but if you got time it's
[34:24] powerful amen look what he says Daniel
[34:26] was told by an Angel he heard seven
[34:28] Thunders now how did Brother bandam know
[34:31] that Daniel heard seven Thunders Heen
[34:34] when Daniel sealed it
[34:36] up but inspiration was showing that
[34:39] Daniel and John was seeing the same
[34:41] thing from Daniel 12 to Revelations 10
[34:44] compare it sometimes beautiful reading
[34:46] he began to get his pen amen and just in
[34:49] about five minutes listen don't write it
[34:51] John saw the same thing and it had
[34:53] already been written outside the Bible
[34:55] he seen the seals on the back of the
[34:57] book and no money could touch those
[34:58] seals and them voices here it is in the
[35:01] Bible which is a mystery itself but on
[35:03] the back side of the Bible was the
[35:04] Revelation Noe to Daniel there's the
[35:06] seven voices uttered no man could open
[35:09] no man knowed what it was but the Bible
[35:11] said in Daniel's Daniel and also to John
[35:15] that in the last days that seven voices
[35:17] would be known by the real true church
[35:20] you get it can you see where the false
[35:22] and the counterfeit is trying their best
[35:24] to keep great men from places like that
[35:29] isn't that something trying to keep
[35:31] great men from these places the places
[35:34] of revelation of the spirit what God
[35:37] reveals look here in the book of
[35:38] Ephesians the church age brother Ram
[35:40] said Daniel heard those Thunders and was
[35:42] forbidden John heard the voices and this
[35:45] book was sealed and on the back of the
[35:46] book was sealed with Seven Seals but in
[35:47] the days these seals was to be open the
[35:50] mystery of God would be finished in
[35:54] other words God would be known to his
[35:56] church not three people but one person
[36:00] the mystery of God would be revealed
[36:05] completely revealed the seven Mysteries
[36:07] would open to the church the church
[36:09] would be living under the inspiration of
[36:12] the holy spirit amen isn't it beautiful
[36:14] that when the seals open what did they
[36:16] reveal they didn't reveal the church
[36:18] they revealed Christ he took the church
[36:21] ages and revealed the church feminine he
[36:23] took the seals and opened the seals
[36:26] masculine do you see what was it was
[36:28] Christ and the church and a prophet was
[36:31] standing in between the two to bring
[36:33] them together to bring the church and
[36:36] God together how can you do it without
[36:38] the Holy Ghost how can you weld the
[36:41] church together with the word without
[36:43] the Holy Ghost otherwise you put the
[36:45] word on you and it'll fall off the first
[36:48] tribulation the first trou the first
[36:50] issue it'll fall off of you but let the
[36:53] Holy Ghost put that word in you one time
[36:56] and brother he'll seal word in you and
[36:59] the devil can't get it out and problems
[37:01] can't get it out churches can't get it
[37:03] out because it's an experience in you oh
[37:07] that's what he was saying the Bride In
[37:09] Christ have become the self-same person
[37:12] come on Church you're a part of this
[37:14] when the people begin to know God unfold
[37:17] God down and see where you find him
[37:20] today unfold him out of the heavens and
[37:23] see where the last unfolding has
[37:25] happened amen deity is not an in heaven
[37:28] this
[37:28] morning deity is in you brother man said
[37:32] don't let them give you a cold Tater and
[37:34] tell you to stand in the corner and wait
[37:36] he said we are now the sons of God we
[37:39] are right now the sons of God we're not
[37:42] going to be in some future State we are
[37:44] now the sons of God and we know our God
[37:48] we know who he is we know who we are we
[37:51] know what we're doing here I'm quoting a
[37:53] prophet to you church amen she now has
[37:56] the revelation that will gather her for
[37:58] the Rapture remember the word is in the
[38:01] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[38:03] what he wants done with the
[38:06] word
[38:08] my amen God put a flesh he unfolded this
[38:12] now watch in the message of the guide he
[38:15] said the Holy Spirit speaks the word I
[38:17] got many things to say but cannot
[38:19] understand it now you cannot understand
[38:21] it now the days of the Apostles
[38:22] everybody want to go to the days of the
[38:24] Apostles but in those days Jesus said I
[38:26] got something to say that you can't
[38:28] understand but when the spirit of
[38:30] understanding
[38:31] comes when these books come open he said
[38:35] there's a reason for the coming of them
[38:37] seals he said I'll guide you to it I'm
[38:39] going to say some things to the end time
[38:41] and the Holy Spirit will guide you to
[38:44] what he spoke have you ever read the
[38:46] messages and you're sitting there
[38:47] reading through the sermons and
[38:49] something just guides you into one part
[38:52] and guide you into the next these
[38:53] preachers know what I'm talking about
[38:55] it's like he picks you up and Carries
[38:56] you through the spoken words of God
[38:59] until you gather up enough that your
[39:01] faith turns into a place of
[39:04] invincibility I know where I'm standing
[39:06] on this subject I understand what I'm
[39:08] talking about I'm not just putting words
[39:11] out here no denomination Tod it's no you
[39:14] see what it is it's an experience with a
[39:16] God my he'll guide you to it that's the
[39:19] reason of these coming seals at the
[39:20] finishing of the seventh seal the
[39:22] mystery of God would be finished to know
[39:24] who God is what he is how he lives his
[39:27] nature his being you're supposed to be
[39:29] all the way up here by that
[39:32] time it was a mystery you can go to the
[39:35] scripture is powerful Paul says it in
[39:37] the book of Timothy he said great is the
[39:39] mystery of godliness for great is the
[39:41] mystery without argument great is the
[39:43] mystery of godliness for God was
[39:46] manifested in the flesh we handled him
[39:48] seen him received him up into Glory
[39:50] witnessed By Angels Vindicated on the
[39:51] earth God sure it was a great mystery
[39:54] but it's all solved
[39:58] but it's all
[39:59] solved oh Lord I'm know I'm going to
[40:01] probably put some of our message
[40:03] professors out of business this morning
[40:05] it's already solved brother we don't
[40:07] need somebody to come along and solve
[40:09] these things out it's already solved
[40:11] just say what the prophet said just say
[40:14] what the message had to say and the
[40:16] power of God can back up the ministry in
[40:19] the last day we don't amen I tell you I
[40:21] have to be honest with you the reason we
[40:23] don't have to pump up and make a motion
[40:26] and preach a motion brother M fan told
[40:28] me the other day in his meetings of
[40:29] course they got a little emotional he
[40:30] said brother Wayne he said you're an
[40:32] emotional preacher he said but I you
[40:34] never preach emotion I said the reason I
[40:36] Don't Preach emotion is because I don't
[40:38] have to preach emotion if you'll preach
[40:40] the message of the hour the God of this
[40:43] Bible will back up his own word and this
[40:46] is a message of authority it's a message
[40:48] of anointing listen to me this is a
[40:51] lifechanging message you can't actually
[40:53] look at what this message mean and
[40:56] remain the same person it will forever
[40:58] change you it will anoint your life it
[41:01] will change your experience it will put
[41:03] something in you I know it's a
[41:05] controversy that it's a great mystery
[41:07] but it's
[41:08] solved it's solved the mystery solved
[41:11] you don't have to be an algebra scholar
[41:13] to understand this you don't have to be
[41:16] three degrees in school to understand
[41:18] this it will take the simple to less let
[41:21] the revelation of God come into
[41:24] them I don't have anything to present I
[41:27] don't have any idea to compete with I
[41:29] never come through any school I never
[41:31] preached any denomination I just want to
[41:33] say what the message had to
[41:36] say so it's congregation appreciation
[41:39] time and I thank God for a group of
[41:41] people that's okay with just what the
[41:43] messenger had to say I thank God for a
[41:46] group of people that has had enough of
[41:48] Dr so and so and Professor so and so and
[41:51] teacher so and so and ideal so and so
[41:54] I'm glad that there's a people said just
[41:56] give me the word
[41:57] I don't need society and publicity and
[42:01] popularity and politics what I need is
[42:04] the power of the Holy Ghost with
[42:06] anointing and with truth we don't need a
[42:08] robed choir are you hearing me we don't
[42:11] need a thousand better musicians we need
[42:14] the anointing of the word of God in
[42:16] authority and power burning out every
[42:20] heart burning out every life until the
[42:22] Praises of God drops into the church
[42:28] brother man said what's the matter with
[42:30] the church he said we took the fire amen
[42:32] off of The Altar and put it in the
[42:33] furnace but what we needs a fire of God
[42:36] we need something to burn within the
[42:39] heart and the life of the people not a
[42:41] fire that goes out the first time
[42:43] somebody gets a little sideways but a
[42:45] fire that'll burn through every
[42:47] situation and every
[42:50] problem well I feel a preacher coming on
[42:52] this morning I'm sorry but I believe we
[42:54] need it I need we need old fashioned
[42:57] Holy Ghost pillar fire experience with
[43:00] God's
[43:01] [Applause]
[43:02] word it'll make the message more
[43:05] important to
[43:08] you afraid some people don't know what
[43:11] that Pillar of Fire is he solved this
[43:14] out he solved it out to bring strength
[43:17] to
[43:19] you it's what he's doing he's bringing
[43:21] God did that to bring strength if you w
[43:23] sure where you're at then you're going
[43:25] to be vamboo
[43:29] where's Ashton did I get that
[43:33] right I was wanting to say lament one
[43:36] time and I said
[43:37] laminated he said brother Wayne I'm not
[43:39] sure how we're going to laminate the
[43:40] people
[43:46] but one thing about it my vocabulary
[43:49] give us a laugh every
[43:52] time so what it is you got to get under
[43:54] inspiration because new words come to me
[43:56] you know
[43:58] made it spiritual didn't
[44:03] I I don't I'm not sure it's what it
[44:05] meant but we can use it they'll speak a
[44:08] new
[44:12] language Abraham's Covenant
[44:15] confirmed by the way speaking of
[44:18] covenants God bless you brother Isaac
[44:19] that was a powerful
[44:21] word that was a powerful
[44:24] word hey this is what the message
[44:26] produces
[44:28] men of God standing with this
[44:31] message amen I certainly enjoyed that
[44:34] amen do you see what it is it's the it's
[44:37] the red body raised up on the Easter
[44:39] morning set him at the right hand of the
[44:41] throne but the spirit that was in him
[44:44] was sent down to the
[44:46] church so when the church covenant is
[44:49] brought into full
[44:51] strength now look at this God took his
[44:54] body that was God's part of the C
[44:57] Covenant was the body of Jesus he has
[44:59] it the our part of the Covenant that he
[45:02] give us our receipt of the Covenant is
[45:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said so
[45:08] when that is brought into full effect so
[45:12] then the holy ghost in the age of
[45:14] Pentecost wasn't in full
[45:16] effect it was only under a shook see it
[45:20] was the Holy Ghost but it wasn't in full
[45:23] effect it hadn't done everything it was
[45:26] supposed to do it hadn't guided to the
[45:27] open of the seals it hadn't brought the
[45:29] church to the fullness of adoption the
[45:31] Holy Ghost is supposed to do them things
[45:33] but it wasn't Under full effect but when
[45:35] the Covenant is confirmed with God the
[45:36] church the people that goes into that
[45:38] body here as a bride will be exactly the
[45:41] same spirit that was upon Christ doing
[45:43] the same things the same Ministry with
[45:45] the same power now them people that know
[45:49] their God we on that is the same period
[45:52] of time when Abraham's Covenant comes
[45:55] into full effect
[45:57] so it's not doing away with the Holy
[45:59] Ghost it's the full effect of the Holy
[46:01] Ghost you mean it didn't just stop with
[46:04] a portion of it it brought you into the
[46:06] weed age look what he says in see not AB
[46:08] the Shu he says he talks about brother
[46:11] Luther moved to justification he said
[46:13] well it's moved to sanctification he
[46:14] said but then watch those Pentecostals
[46:16] come along he said but watch now but now
[46:19] it's coming to say I and my father are
[46:22] one and these other things these Shucks
[46:25] begin to pull away and their genuine
[46:27] bride in the church will bring forth the
[46:29] entire word of God in its fullness and
[46:33] in its
[46:35] strength this church will bring forth
[46:38] the word in its fullness and in his
[46:40] strength I'm reading about you now amen
[46:44] see not every the sh brother R said the
[46:45] elected church somewhere in this world
[46:47] that's pulling out and set aside from
[46:49] these things the Manifest God
[46:50] manifestation of God has attracted it
[46:53] we're at the last day the Shu has G
[46:56] forth its strength into the
[46:58] seed it's went on out it was a good
[47:01] shuck but it served its term it is the
[47:05] word Bride of the word groom see the
[47:09] shuck served its term now the life that
[47:12] was in the shock was put into the seed
[47:15] life so we ain't lost anything but what
[47:19] was only able to produce a Shu in
[47:21] Pentecost has come to produce an entire
[47:24] wheat in this age we're not put anything
[47:27] off we're putting on
[47:29] Perfection they knew him but not
[47:31] imperfection oh God they knew him they
[47:34] knew him in certain ways but not in
[47:36] Perfection but there's coming a bride
[47:39] that will know him in perfection in
[47:42] other words she will have seen a full
[47:44] revelation of him and who else will a
[47:47] man fully reveal himself to but his own
[47:49] wife do you see it comes into
[47:53] Perfection amen this this this coming
[47:56] forth this this husk that give its life
[47:59] to the seed it was the strength of it is
[48:02] what was given to you the strength now
[48:04] if you go to Psalms 28 David says this
[48:07] he said the Lord is my
[48:09] strength so the Lord left that shuck and
[48:13] come right into the seed now they're
[48:16] left with forms and traditions and ideas
[48:18] but the Lord left it the Lord's not with
[48:21] it
[48:22] anymore but the Lord is with his word
[48:26] which is in Perfection watch David said
[48:28] the Lord is my strength and my shield in
[48:31] the eth verse he said the Lord is their
[48:33] strength and he is saving strength of
[48:36] his
[48:37] anointed look in Psalms 27 And1 David
[48:40] said for the Lord is my light and my
[48:41] salvation Whom Shall I Fear for the Lord
[48:45] is the strength of my life and of whom
[48:48] shall I be afraid raptures right Rapture
[48:52] right the strength for Rapture The
[48:55] Virtue for rapture the Lord is the
[48:57] strength of my rapturing life that
[49:00] that'll change you and Rapture you is
[49:03] the Lord that's the only thing that'll
[49:04] do it is the Lord he is the strength of
[49:07] my life the Lord is my salvation now
[49:10] according to David I'm going to stay
[49:11] with David a minute and David in Psalms
[49:13] 84 and verse 5 he said blessed is the
[49:16] man whose strength is in thee he said
[49:20] brother Wayne why have you transitioned
[49:22] to strength all of a sudden well the
[49:23] Bible in Daniel 11:32 said they know
[49:26] know their God they'll be
[49:29] strong now if I say to you you're going
[49:31] to be strong you're going to say how am
[49:33] I going to get strong what am I going to
[49:35] do to get strong here it's showing the
[49:38] strength coming from the Lord blessed is
[49:41] that man who gets his strength not from
[49:43] his knowledge not from his ability but
[49:46] from the Lord do you see what it is if
[49:48] he gets that from the Lord he says man
[49:51] blesses the man whose strength is in the
[49:53] Lord now think about this then if your
[49:55] strength is in the Lord no matter what
[49:57] you're going through you're always going
[49:59] to be
[50:00] strong because the weakening conditions
[50:03] of lead deia will not be affecting the
[50:06] strength of the Lord the Lord will be
[50:08] just as strong but the Bible even
[50:11] predicts a stronger anointing in this
[50:13] age than the ages that were previous the
[50:17] conditions are worse but if your
[50:18] strength is coming from the Lord the
[50:20] Lord has prophesied a presence in this
[50:23] age by the appearing of the son of man
[50:25] which brings the Church in amen watch
[50:28] blessed is the man whose strength is in
[50:29] thee whose heart and the way of them and
[50:32] David explains it in the next verse and
[50:33] I'm not going to take you to a Biblical
[50:34] lesson today on this point but I think
[50:36] it's a good point blessed is a man whose
[50:38] strength is in thee who passing through
[50:41] the valley of
[50:42] baka make it as a whale the rain also
[50:46] filth the pools now there's a huge
[50:49] argument brother BR didn't touch it so I
[50:51] don't have any Authority at all on it
[50:53] but I'll say this there's a huge
[50:54] argument about what that Baka means some
[50:57] says it's a Valley of Tears some says it
[50:59] means a mberry bush some it there's a
[51:01] there's a huge H huge argument over the
[51:04] Hebrew of what Baka actually means which
[51:07] is exactly what brother Randon was
[51:08] saying he said see how can you get a
[51:10] Revival off of Just translations when
[51:13] the people who are doing the
[51:14] translations don't agree so there's got
[51:16] to come a revelation of what it is you
[51:19] see now watch because the Baka here it
[51:22] will be made as a well the rain also fth
[51:23] the P so blessed is a man whose strength
[51:26] comes from the Lord even passing through
[51:28] the valley of baka many people actually
[51:30] agree in the in the and the writers
[51:32] actually put this out mostly that it's
[51:34] actually not a place in Israel at all
[51:37] but it's actually a picturesque thing
[51:39] that deals with conditions of life in
[51:41] other words dry seasons of life now
[51:44] think about this a man whose strength is
[51:45] coming from the Lord when he's passing
[51:48] through the deserts of life when he's
[51:50] passing through the Wilderness amen you
[51:52] see what he's saying he's saying here
[51:54] that even then there his will filth the
[51:57] pools amen though thou wst in the dry
[52:00] places there's still water there though
[52:03] you walk through the most desperate
[52:05] times of your life there's still Joy
[52:07] there because your strength is not
[52:10] coming from the circumstance it's coming
[52:13] from the Lord hey I think we ought to
[52:15] put on our joy shoes this morning and
[52:18] remember where our strength is coming
[52:20] from we're not strong because someone
[52:22] approves of us we're not strong because
[52:24] somebody a certain group likes us or
[52:26] don't like us our strength is because we
[52:29] have an experience with the almighty God
[52:32] and he's a strength Giver in the hour
[52:34] when a man needs strength amen now I'm
[52:37] going to talk about you a minute in
[52:39] verse seven it says they go from
[52:41] strength to strength a man who gets his
[52:43] strength from the Lord goes from
[52:45] strength to strength and everyone that
[52:47] appear before them in Zion I love how
[52:49] the the Amplified Bible has this point
[52:52] it says they go from strength to
[52:54] strength increasing in in Victor
[52:56] Victorious
[52:58] power increasing in Victorious power
[53:01] we're not walking from strength to
[53:02] weakness we're not going backwards
[53:05] Church we're not going to become a
[53:07] weaker people as the Nations get weaker
[53:10] as troubles get greater actually it's
[53:12] predicted of you if your strength is
[53:14] coming from the Lord you're going to go
[53:16] from strong to Stronger amen from
[53:19] strength to strength you're going to
[53:21] increase in strength now you might not
[53:24] even understand the strength increase if
[53:26] your life but if you amen you you got to
[53:29] see that God's given you Grace remember
[53:31] that he said amen Paul said take this
[53:33] trial away he said my grace is
[53:35] sufficient remember that my grace is
[53:37] sufficient and my strength is made
[53:39] perfect in your weakness amen so humanly
[53:43] weaker amen but greater in the strength
[53:45] of God in other words look you're you're
[53:47] not existing as a Christian Amen in the
[53:50] in the easy times you're not existing as
[53:53] a Christian when the Great revivals of
[53:55] the 40s and 50s were were clipping off
[53:57] and everybody was believing what you're
[53:58] believing you have remained with your
[54:01] integrity upon the word of God in an
[54:04] hour when you can't hardly find a clean
[54:06] heart nowhere it's the days of Noah
[54:09] again but you got a strength within you
[54:12] that makes you walk this way it makes
[54:14] you talk this
[54:15] way so brother Wayne what are you saying
[54:17] I'm saying if you're still existing
[54:19] right now it's only because your
[54:21] strength has increased because the age
[54:23] has got worse and you're still here so
[54:25] without an increase of strength you
[54:27] would have fell off a long time ago God
[54:29] ain't left you just walking with the
[54:31] same thing you had 10 years ago if
[54:34] you're alive this morning you are
[54:36] stronger than you were 10 years
[54:41] ago well from strength to strength
[54:43] they're going to walk it from strength
[54:45] to strength they're going to get
[54:47] stronger
[54:48] now that's what David had to say he said
[54:51] you will increase in Victorious
[54:54] strength so if you're on your way home
[54:57] and there's a there's a obstacle between
[54:59] you and home then just move
[55:02] it you're walking you're walking that
[55:04] way just move it you have strength to
[55:06] move it now when David preaches this and
[55:10] David says this I thought I think of
[55:12] David I think of the writer I can't help
[55:14] it but the writer means something to me
[55:16] when David writes this when strength to
[55:18] strength and I think who was David
[55:20] actually writing about what kind of
[55:21] examples would David have to write this
[55:24] kind of text they'll walk through
[55:26] through the valley of baka they go
[55:27] strength to strength blessed is the man
[55:28] who's Lord and I'm thinking now who was
[55:30] David's
[55:31] forefathers amen now y'all know there's
[55:35] one that just sticks right out in your
[55:36] mind one who followed the Lord in the
[55:39] Bible there was a man named
[55:41] Caleb remember David knew about Caleb's
[55:45] life all of Israel knew about Caleb's
[55:48] life Caleb's life was so important that
[55:50] it found its way in the Book of Numbers
[55:52] whenever that 12 Spies were sent over
[55:55] into the land and they were to spy out
[55:56] the land it was a land of promise
[55:58] remember and they went over and there
[56:00] were 12 Spies went over and looked into
[56:02] the land amen and when they come back
[56:04] the scripture tells us amen that 10 of
[56:07] the spies seen
[56:09] Giants they acknowledged milk and honey
[56:12] but they only sing the Giants of the
[56:14] land and comparably to themselves they
[56:17] were getting their own strength from
[56:18] themselves comparably they became
[56:20] grasshoppers in the sights of those
[56:21] giants remember those 10 they did but
[56:24] there were two of them Joshua and Caleb
[56:26] on the other hand that had seen the same
[56:28] Giants experienced the same problems but
[56:31] when they come back they brought
[56:32] evidences of an unseen land to an
[56:35] expected people those evidences were
[56:37] milk and honey oh my Amen in the land of
[56:41] milk and honey they brought evidences of
[56:43] grapes and milk and honey what were they
[56:45] doing they were bringing evidences
[56:49] exploits of another land they were
[56:52] bringing those evidences where people
[56:54] could literally taste they could taste
[56:57] of the other land though they had not
[56:58] been there though they had not been in
[57:00] those places now the others can only
[57:02] talk about the Giants that they had
[57:04] visited in those places but somebody had
[57:06] their mind on the evidences of that
[57:08] place oh church amen you know brother
[57:11] Ram said it he said there's a land of
[57:13] Divine Healing he said and when you go
[57:15] over in that land God will send
[57:16] Witnesses into that land he said but
[57:18] somebody will know somebody amen who
[57:20] didn't get healed and all the thing they
[57:22] can come back with as a testimony as
[57:24] they believed and didn't get healed he
[57:26] said there's that giant that you will
[57:27] face every time you go to testifying
[57:29] about your healing amen there's Giants I
[57:32] I I tell you I I want to preach a sermon
[57:34] almost titled it milk honey and Giants
[57:37] amen amen you see what it is they're all
[57:39] there but where's your focus amen what
[57:41] you going to focus on the Giants the
[57:43] problems the failures the situations let
[57:46] me tell you if you're looking for
[57:47] something to discourage you you've come
[57:49] to the right place because every time
[57:52] the sons of God come together the devil
[57:54] come also and brother bam said if you
[57:56] you expect to find something wrong the
[57:58] devil will make sure you find
[58:01] it that's right he said but if you've
[58:03] come expecting something from God he
[58:06] said God will get you your expectation
[58:09] so I want to know who's going to meet
[58:10] your expectation today are you going to
[58:12] have fellowship with God if you do
[58:15] you'll leave here strong and you'll have
[58:17] exploits in your life if you let the
[58:19] devil get a hold of you you'll start
[58:21] looking at the negative and you don't
[58:23] have to ask when a man's looking at the
[58:24] negative cuz everything's disappointing
[58:26] they go to the edge of Life they're
[58:28] troubled by everything they can't
[58:29] Fellowship hardly anymore they things
[58:31] they used to build up now they tear down
[58:33] a depressive negative Spirit begins to
[58:35] move around them why is it they got
[58:37] their eyes on the wrong thing and the
[58:40] devil is working overtime to get your
[58:41] eyes off of the things of God because

[1:02:41] saying drink till you can't drive I'm
[1:02:43] saying drink till you lose who you are
[1:02:45] and what you think about brother brand
[1:02:47] said we ought to get so drunk that we
[1:02:50] forget our own
[1:02:53] name come on Church one thing about a
[1:02:56] drunk is he don't remember tomorrow what
[1:02:58] he did and it's time to start forgetting
[1:03:00] a few things it's start time to start
[1:03:02] forgetting some of the problems that
[1:03:04] have collected through the years of True
[1:03:06] Word Tabernacle why not just take a
[1:03:08] flesh start this morning and let the
[1:03:11] same Vigor of the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:13] Ghost come into you with
[1:03:16] life get drunk on the anointing get
[1:03:20] drunk and forget it forget about who's

[1:03:26] God and drink ourselves into a
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:32] place so preacher you shouldn't be you
[1:03:34] shouldn't be proposing these things well
[1:03:36] brother Ram said we should get drunk and
[1:03:38] he said the stimulation of Revelation
[1:03:40] should have the same effect on the
[1:03:41] church as a natural wine has and natural
[1:03:44] wine don't care what color you are it
[1:03:47] don't care what race you are amen people
[1:03:49] say well brother way that's just not our
[1:03:50] nature and it wasn't nobody's nature
[1:03:52] till they got to drinking wine but it
[1:03:54] changed their nature it affected the
[1:03:56] most unaffected because glory to God
[1:03:59] it'll put a smile on your
[1:04:05] face it's in full effect now come on the
[1:04:08] Revelation is in full
[1:04:10] effect brother Wayne I can't believe you
[1:04:14] that mean can I can I just continue for
[1:04:16] a moment I I stay right in the word is
[1:04:18] all right I'll stay right in the word
[1:04:19] direction of the word brother BR said
[1:04:21] what we need is to get drunk he said why
[1:04:24] do we need to get drunk brother brand
[1:04:25] said well the other day Salvation Army
[1:04:27] went and picked the drunk out of the
[1:04:28] street it was below freezing he was out
[1:04:30] there without a coat passed out in the

[1:04:33] him into salvation they said are you
[1:04:35] going to take him to hospital he said no
[1:04:36] need to go they said well I thought he
[1:04:38] might have H hypothermia he said the
[1:04:40] Salvation Army said the man Ain got
[1:04:42] hypothermia he said his blood alcohol
[1:04:44] content is so high he said that his
[1:04:46] veins are running with alcohol he said
[1:04:48] you couldn't freeze him to death if you
[1:04:50] wanted to he said I think the church
[1:04:52] then are to get so full of the Holy
[1:04:54] Ghost Power and so drunk on the word of
[1:04:57] God that you can't cool them
[1:05:01] off Leia can't cool her off travels

[1:05:25] those it comes out of that other land
[1:05:27] grapes from Canaan they brought back
[1:05:30] evidences of another land and Caleb was
[1:05:33] so influenced by what he saw that he
[1:05:35] stood against everything around him and
[1:05:38] said there is a land and we are more
[1:05:40] than able to take
[1:05:42] it he couldn't change his Direction
