[1:32] it father to absorb it into our
[1:35] lives to take it as food that it become
[1:38] strength to our bodies Lord in this late
[1:41] hour Lord you promised an evening time
[1:44] communion that if we'd open our hearts
[1:46] you'd come in Lord and reveal the things
[1:49] Lord it would become strength that we
[1:51] would feed on Lord that it would be the
[1:55] unfailing body word the Lord's strength
[1:58] to Fly Like an Eagle to get above the
[2:00] things of this world and Lord Lord to
[2:04] find ourselves in that Rapture cycle oh
[2:07] God and we pray tonight father that Lord
[2:09] your word would be rich Among Us that
[2:12] you would help us Lord that you would
[2:15] bring the inspiration the context of the
[2:17] scripture Lord and be more than just as
[2:20] comparing like a newspaper or reading a
[2:22] book but may you bring the inspiration
[2:24] Lord of which it was written that it
[2:26] might inspire a Heart Lord from the
[2:29] things that others have went through
[2:30] that it might be an example to our lives
[2:32] and we ask you tonight that you would
[2:34] lead us Lord that you would heal the
[2:36] sick Lord may you touch them that is not

[3:04] tonight if you have your Bibles we're
[3:06] going to look in Daniel the 3rd Chapter
[3:08] amen uh brother Nathan would you join me
[3:10] again so so uh so graciously join me um
[3:16] it I and sometimes we go uh maybe where
[3:18] we read a scripture or something as
[3:20] where context but I just thought it was
[3:22] amazing if we could just read some of
[3:24] the scripture as we're preaching it and
[3:26] maybe sometimes it's been a long time
[3:28] since someone actually read the the
[3:30] portions that we're talking about so
[3:32] we're just going to read it if it's okay
[3:33] with you Daniel the third
[3:42] chapter if you have it say Amen we'll
[3:46] just read the whole
[3:47] chapter Nebuchadnezzar the king made an
[3:50] image of gold whose height was three
[3:53] score cubits and the bread thereof six
[3:55] cubits he set it up in the plain of
[3:57] durah in the province of Babylon
[4:00] then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to
[4:02] gather together the princes the
[4:04] governors and the captains the judges
[4:06] the treasurers the counselors the
[4:08] sheriffs and all the rulers of the
[4:10] provinces to come to the dedication of
[4:12] the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king
[4:15] had set up then the princes the
[4:17] governors and captains the judges the
[4:19] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[4:21] and all the rulers of the provinces were
[4:23] gathered together unto the dedication of
[4:25] the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
[4:27] had set up and they stood before the
[4:30] image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
[4:32] then in Herald cried aloud to you it is
[4:35] commanded oh people Nations and
[4:37] languages that at what time you hear the
[4:40] sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut
[4:44] saltery duler and all kinds of music You
[4:47] Fall Down and Worship the golden image
[4:49] that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up
[4:52] and who so falleth not down and
[4:58] worshipthe at that time when all the
[5:00] people heard the sound of the Cornet
[5:02] flute harp sackbut saltery and all kinds
[5:04] of music all the people the Nations and
[5:07] the languages fell down and worshiped
[5:09] the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[5:11] king had set up wherefore at that time
[5:14] certain Chaldeans came near and accused
[5:16] the Jews and they spake and said to the
[5:18] King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever
[5:22] thou oh King has made a degree decree
[5:24] that every man that shall hear the sound
[5:26] of the Cornet flute harp sackit sutty
[5:29] and duler and all kinds of music shall
[5:31] fall down and worship the golden image
[5:33] and who so falleth not down and woreth
[5:36] that he should be cast into the midst of
[5:38] a burning fiery furnace but there are
[5:40] certain Jews whom thou has set over the
[5:42] Affairs of the province of Babylon
[5:44] Shadrach mesach and Abednego these men
[5:47] oh King hath not regarded thee they
[5:49] serve not thy Gods nor worship the
[5:52] golden image with thou has set up then
[5:54] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[5:56] commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and
[5:58] Abednego then they brought these men
[6:00] before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[6:03] said unto them is it true oh Shadrach
[6:06] meach and amedo do you not serve my gods
[6:10] nor worship the golden image which I
[6:12] have set up now if you be ready that at
[6:15] what time you hear the sound of the
[6:16] Cornet flute harp sackit Suter and duler
[6:19] and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and
[6:21] Worship the image which I have made well
[6:24] but if you worship not you shall be cast
[6:27] the same hour into the midst of of a
[6:29] burning fiery furnace and who is that
[6:31] God that shall deliver you out of my
[6:33] hands Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[6:36] answered and said to the king oh
[6:38] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[6:40] answer thee in this manner if it be so
[6:42] our God whom we serve is able to Deliver
[6:45] Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he
[6:47] will deliver us out of thine hand O King
[6:50] but if not be it known unto thee Oh King
[6:53] that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[6:55] worship the golden image which thou Hast
[6:58] set up then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
[7:00] Fury and the form of his Visage was
[7:02] changed against Shadrach meach and
[7:04] Abednego therefore he spake and
[7:06] commanded that they should heat the
[7:07] furnace one seven times more than it was
[7:10] want to be heated and he commanded the
[7:12] most mighty men that were in his army to
[7:14] bind Shadrach mhach and Abednego and to
[7:16] cast them into the burning fiery furnace
[7:19] then these men were Bound in their coats
[7:21] their hos and in their hats and their
[7:23] other garments and were cast into the
[7:25] midst of the burning fiery furnace
[7:28] therefore because the King's Command was
[7:29] urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the
[7:32] flame of the fire slew those men that
[7:34] took up Shadrach Meshach and menego and
[7:37] these three men Shadrach mhach and
[7:39] Abednego fell down bound into the midst
[7:41] of the burning fiery
[7:43] furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[7:45] astonished and Rose up in haste and
[7:48] spake and said unto his counselors did
[7:50] not we cast three men bound into the
[7:52] midst of the fire they answered and said
[7:54] unto the king true oh King he answered
[7:57] and said lo I see four men loose
[8:00] walking in the midst of the fire and
[8:01] they have no hurt and the form of the
[8:03] fourth is like the Son of God then
[8:06] Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of
[8:08] the burning fiery furnace and spake and
[8:10] said Shadrach meach and ameno you
[8:13] Servants of the most high God come forth
[8:15] and come hither then Shadrach Meshach
[8:17] and Abednego came forth of the midst of
[8:19] the fire and the princes Governors and
[8:22] captains and the King's counselors being
[8:24] gathered together saw these men upon
[8:26] whom the bodies upon whose bodies the
[8:28] fire had no power nor was a hair of
[8:31] their head singed neither were their
[8:32] coats changed nor the smell of fire had
[8:35] passed on them then Nebuchadnezzar spake
[8:37] and said blessed be the god of Shadrach
[8:40] meach and Abednego who hath sent his
[8:42] Angel and delivered the servants that
[8:45] trusted in him and have changed the
[8:47] king's word and yielded their bodies
[8:48] that they might not serve nor worship
[8:50] any God except their own God therefore I
[8:54] make a decree that every people nation
[8:56] and language which speak anything amiss
[8:59] against the god of Shadrach Meshach and
[9:01] Abednego shall be cut in pieces and
[9:03] their houses shall be made a dungill
[9:05] because there is no other God that can
[9:07] deliver after this sort then the king
[9:10] promoted Shadrach mhach and Abednego in
[9:12] the province of
[9:14] Babylon God bless you you may be
[9:17] seated that's a powerful reading isn't
[9:19] it amen that's enough to have church on
[9:21] out there Amen to to think of the grace
[9:24] of God Amen and uh to hear the story
[9:27] read together like that and uh just been
[9:30] personally been studying over this and I
[9:31] want to maybe just continue this Daniel
[9:33] series another service or two and and I
[9:35] want to if I take a context tonight I
[9:38] want to look at here upon the war of
[9:40] worship on the war of worship and this
[9:43] is exactly what we're uh looking at here
[9:46] in Daniel the thir chapter is you're
[9:48] looking at something that is actually
[9:50] following after that Daniel has just
[9:53] opened up the revelation of the great
[9:55] image and at the end of the the
[9:57] revelation of that image uh you can see
[10:01] that the the uh that the Revelation has
[10:04] come and then immediately after this
[10:06] Nebuchadnezzar sets up an image for
[10:09] everyone to worship now brother Bram uh
[10:11] emphatically teaches that the image that
[10:14] he built was a image of Daniel now you
[10:17] can see this in the previous verse in
[10:19] the end of Daniel the 2 chapter you can
[10:21] see that he already began worshiping
[10:24] Daniel at the Revelation and then he
[10:26] sets up this image and of course I'm
[10:29] sure that he probably thought he was
[10:31] doing a good thing by setting up an
[10:32] image of Daniel because that God had so
[10:35] manifested through Daniel the god of of
[10:38] the universe had manifested through a
[10:40] human being and being an idolator uh
[10:43] they would they would worship the thing
[10:45] that they seen God in not realizing uh
[10:48] that the the Jew worships an invisible
[10:50] God and that invisible God can make
[10:52] itself known in a human being but you
[10:54] never worship the vessel that you're
[10:57] seeing the power manifested in rather
[10:59] you worship the god that is working in
[11:01] the vessel amen and and as seeing this
[11:04] of course uh what we're viewing when
[11:07] brother Bram teaches uh he teaches
[11:09] Daniel the thir chapter as an end time
[11:11] revelation of the Book of Revelation
[11:13] chapter 13 and also the Book of
[11:15] Revelation chapter 17 and he is showing
[11:19] brother brandom is actually showing a
[11:21] couple phases of this of the worship of
[11:23] of images now he teaches us that when
[11:26] the Gentile age comes in he said says it
[11:29] comes in under idolatry and it comes in
[11:32] under image worship he said now we find
[11:34] it will go out the same way that it came
[11:37] in it will go out in idol worship or
[11:40] image worship now of course when we look
[11:43] at this the scriptures tells us in
[11:45] Daniel the third chapter that
[11:46] Nebuchadnezzar and you notice the Bible
[11:48] keeps saying he set up this image he set
[11:50] it up in other words it was erected by
[11:52] man it was put forward by man it wasn't
[11:55] anything that God done it was what man
[11:57] done and he put forth this image now in
[12:00] the scriptures if you go back and refer
[12:02] to it again you'll find that the entire
[12:05] world was worshiping this Beast of this
[12:07] image of what that that Nebuchadnezzar
[12:10] had made the Bible tells us that when he
[12:12] got ready to worship that he called
[12:14] everyone the princes the governors the
[12:16] sheriffs it goes on in names everybody's
[12:19] going to be doing it which is an exact
[12:21] example that we see in the scripture if
[12:23] you go to the Book of Revelations the
[12:25] 13th chapter uh you just turn over there
[12:28] with me the book of Revelations the 13th
[12:30] chapter and you'll see that this is
[12:32] exactly brother Bram brother Bram ties
[12:34] this and I won't take a long time to
[12:35] read here but in Revelations the 13th
[12:37] chapter you'll see of course the Beast
[12:39] of Revelations 13:1 we've been talking
[12:41] about but then in the verses uh uh verse
[12:45] uh uh 10 here verses 9 down through the
[12:48] end of the chapter of 13 you're going to
[12:50] read about a beast that come up out of
[12:52] the earth and then the scripture says
[12:54] that there was an image that is set unto
[12:56] this beast and brother Bram says here of
[12:59] course in the in the 14th verse that
[13:01] they should make an image to the Beast
[13:04] amen that had its wound By The Sword and
[13:06] did live and then the 15th verse it says
[13:09] he had power to give life unto the image
[13:11] of the Beast and that image of the Beast
[13:13] should both speak and cause as many
[13:15] would not worship the image of the Beast
[13:17] should be killed now you can see
[13:19] immediately that what Nebuchadnezzar was
[13:21] doing in Daniel 3 is exactly the plan
[13:25] that Satan has in Revelations chap 13
[13:28] it's not going to be in natural Babylon
[13:31] that it's happening but it will take
[13:33] place in mystery Babylon it will be a
[13:35] spiritual Babylon in that time and the
[13:38] Bible is telling us an image will be
[13:40] lifted up in the end time that will be
[13:43] done in the spiritual Babylon and when
[13:44] the image is lifted up amen there will
[13:46] be a forced worship of an image now of
[13:50] course this goes into multiple levels
[13:52] this is the this is the order of worship
[13:55] of the Antichrist of the end time amen
[13:57] and if you study what brother Ram says
[13:59] he he he's very clear in saying that
[14:01] this is the way the Gentile age was
[14:03] issued in and this was also condemned
[14:06] now when you read the scripture here
[14:09] you'll find that the image of course is
[14:12] the image and brother bam tells us that
[14:14] that image is uh the World Council of
[14:17] churches that's exactly what it is it's
[14:19] the Protestant church that has been made
[14:22] in the image of the Roman church amen
[14:25] and so it's a system or an image that
[14:27] everyone will be required to worship
[14:30] therein now there's a lot of uh there's
[14:32] a lot of uh different ideas concerning
[14:35] this but watch how brother Bram will lay
[14:37] this together and he'll show he says now
[14:39] watch this is forced worship that's why
[14:42] he goes back and teaches that why we are
[14:45] not a denomination he teaches we're not
[14:47] a denomination because denomination ends
[14:50] up in a forced worship and he said
[14:52] there's no way that you can ever find in
[14:55] the Bible where God forced people to
[14:57] worship but if you're going to fine
[14:59] denomination you can only find it in
[15:01] Babylon when they set forth a teaching
[15:04] and then forced people to worship under
[15:07] that kind of a teaching listen no no
[15:10] true man of God no true spiritual
[15:12] leadership would ever force a certain
[15:15] worship upon the church and that's why
[15:17] the Bible said in the New Testament when
[15:19] it come into the church ages remember
[15:21] the sin of the ages that they they had
[15:23] the niad in spirit remember and the Nick
[15:26] in spirit was a forcing a people to
[15:29] follow a man-made leadership brother bam
[15:31] said see but God always leads by the
[15:33] word and he never leads by force in
[15:36] other words he he doesn't force people
[15:38] to do a certain thing amen he leads by
[15:41] the word and the Sheep of God will
[15:43] follow that word and they'll believe
[15:45] that word and that's when brother random
[15:47] actually puts it out and I know a lot of
[15:49] people don't like these kind of things
[15:50] but brother ROM says it plain he said
[15:52] see you follow me as I follow Christ and
[15:54] he said we follow as we follow the word
[15:56] he said now if I leave the word you
[15:58] leave me he said because see you're not
[16:00] following me as a man you're following
[16:02] you're following Christ amen and I've
[16:05] always said it and I I want to always
[16:07] make this statement is that anytime you
[16:09] hear me say something different than
[16:10] brother bradam said and you just forget
[16:12] anything that I said about it and you
[16:14] just follow what the prophet said I
[16:16] don't have any desire whatsoever to set
[16:18] something different than what a prophet
[16:20] has already said concerning a matter and
[16:22] if you hear me say something that seems
[16:25] something different than what the
[16:27] prophet said it means I just just forgot
[16:29] he said something where I hadn't come to
[16:30] that study yet and we'll just correct it
[16:33] and move right on CU we're exactly going
[16:35] to teach what a prophet said concerning
[16:38] every matter and and I believe any true
[16:40] five-fold Ministry has that same kind of
[16:42] heart that they want to teach it but
[16:44] watch now in the world system of images
[16:47] they're setting up an image and that
[16:49] image is a holy man early in brother
[16:51] bram's Min he teaches that of course to
[16:53] be the pope it's a world worship of the
[16:56] Pope uh the World Council of churches
[16:58] will end up worshiping the image that
[17:01] worship that Pope that's what they're
[17:02] going to do everybody's got to go back
[17:04] to Mama that's what's going to happen a
[17:06] few years ago they started pushing that
[17:08] right going back to Mama now when it
[17:10] gets a little closer to home is when you
[17:12] start realizing that homemade religion
[17:15] in the message amen has set brother
[17:17] brandom as that image and and and there
[17:19] are people that actually are worshiping
[17:22] the image of the Prophet that God so
[17:24] wonderfully Vindicated in the age that
[17:26] we're in now now of course that was
[17:28] wasn't exactly what brother randam was
[17:30] trying to say but it fits very clearly
[17:33] that brother brandham was been made an
[17:35] image in this end time among message
[17:37] some of the message people amen and they
[17:39] don't believe anybody can preach but the
[17:41] prophet they don't believe anybody can
[17:43] pray for the sick but the prophet they
[17:45] don't they don't believe anything like
[17:46] that but but how in the world could we
[17:49] ever stand as true children of God Amen
[17:52] and worship the man instead of the god
[17:55] that was working through the man if
[17:57] there was anything brother random ever
[17:58] had to say was don't you worship me I'm
[18:02] not here to make a name for myself nor
[18:04] am I here to make a following but I am
[18:07] here to introduce Jesus Christ remember
[18:10] in Bruce serpent brother Bram was so
[18:12] hurt he'd come home from a hunting trip
[18:14] 1960 Bru serpent Revelation series he
[18:17] come home from a hunting trip and he
[18:19] said I had to get out of the woods he
[18:21] said I was afraid I was going to follow
[18:22] my gun accidentally and shoot myself
[18:25] because he was so tore up over the idea
[18:28] that someone was worshiping him as Jesus
[18:31] Christ he said I would rather answer to
[18:33] God as a quitter as an antichrist he
[18:36] considered it completely an antichrist
[18:39] Doctrine to worship Him in any manner
[18:42] whatsoever amen and we've got to be
[18:44] careful church that we never set a man
[18:47] is God but remember that we are
[18:49] worshiping Jesus Christ we are true
[18:52] Christians we are not worshiping an
[18:54] image or an idea or a Doctrine but God
[18:58] is a person person amen and a person who
[19:00] requires the worship of every individual
[19:03] and we are the worshippers of almighty
[19:06] God now of course these these uh in the
[19:09] days of in the days of Nebuchadnezzar
[19:11] setting up a natural image trying to get
[19:13] people to worship of course is in
[19:15] Revelations the 13th chapter and then
[19:17] remember they're going to have to
[19:18] receive a Mark or the number of his name
[19:21] now of course that number of his name is
[19:22] the number of a man which
[19:24] 666 brother R said which is exactly the
[19:27] Roman numerals amen of the of where the
[19:30] pope sets they have it they have the
[19:32] name of that written over in V of Christ
[19:34] brother R said take the numerals and
[19:36] spell out the name and you'll get
[19:38] exactly the number 666 in numer Roman
[19:41] numerals teaching us and showing us that
[19:43] the Antichrist is the pope amen and the
[19:46] devil will completely incarnate him and
[19:49] we and the whole world's going to see it
[19:50] at some point amen but the Church of the
[19:53] Living God Amen is able to see it before
[19:55] it happens amen and they come under the
[19:58] revelation
[19:59] of the word of their season now in
[20:01] saying that that forc worship that would
[20:03] come now I thought it was amazing that
[20:06] the devil always is a perverter of the
[20:09] true things of God Amen isn't it
[20:11] beautiful to know that God himself is
[20:14] being Elohim but we call him God by the
[20:17] word of English but brother Bram said
[20:19] see that means an object of worship and
[20:23] that's exactly why God created man was
[20:25] for worship youall know that when God
[20:28] created the Angels the Angels worshiped
[20:30] him and then he created man and then man
[20:32] worshiped him but all of them was
[20:34] created with only knowing about the
[20:36] worship of God but brother random
[20:38] teaches us that the entire fall happened
[20:41] so that somebody would worship God by
[20:44] choice rather than by being made to
[20:46] worship him he wanted somebody to choose
[20:49] to worship Him amen and to think tonight
[20:52] amen that God has called this bride to
[20:55] do something that nobody else could do
[20:57] amen you have been called to worship him
[20:59] in a way that nobody has ever worshiped
[21:02] God in the entire ages now I think we've
[21:05] come to a beautiful time in the word of
[21:07] God we've come to a beautiful time in
[21:10] the seasons of God I believe we have
[21:12] come to a time of worship and I believe
[21:15] that was what was happening in the Bible
[21:17] amen the seals were opening up Daniel
[21:19] was seeing a for viiew of the opening of
[21:22] the book in the end time when he seen
[21:24] the stone smiting the image and that's
[21:27] exactly what happens in theend end time
[21:29] when Revelations 10 comes and a mighty
[21:32] angel opens up the book what is it it's
[21:34] a picture of Revelations the 5th chapter
[21:37] and the Bible says when the when the
[21:39] seals were open or when the book was
[21:41] open in Revelations 5 y'all remember
[21:44] what happens the Bible says that the
[21:46] elders begin to worship and and they
[21:48] begin to throw down their crowns and
[21:50] they begin to sing the song Worthy is
[21:53] the Lamb of God Amen to take away the
[21:55] sin of the world Amen the song of the
[21:57] Lamb amen remember what he said Worthy
[22:00] is the Lamb to take away the sin of the
[22:02] world it was a new song that was being
[22:05] written in a certain season amen and
[22:08] that was a season of Revelation a season
[22:11] now I've often looked at this and I
[22:14] thought it was amazing in Revelations 15
[22:16] the Bible says that after uh after we're
[22:19] up in heaven they said they sang a song
[22:22] and the Bible said they sang the song of
[22:24] Moses and they'll sing the song of the
[22:26] Lamb up in heaven now if you go back and
[22:28] read in the scripture the song of Moses
[22:30] was written right after they crossed the
[22:33] Red Sea Exodus 15 you can go go read it
[22:36] amen and they they right after they
[22:37] cross the Red Sea Moses wrote a song in
[22:40] Inspiration now that song that was
[22:42] written in Inspiration was written on
[22:44] the banks of a sea right after God had
[22:48] destroyed an entire Army now now it's
[22:51] important to see this because that song
[22:53] could not have been written until that
[22:55] time Amen in other words Moses wasn't
[22:58] singing a song from a different
[23:00] generation he was singing a song about
[23:03] the season he was living in under an
[23:05] inspiration and we could call it a new
[23:08] song because it was the first time that
[23:10] God had ever destroyed an army by water
[23:13] nobody had ever seen anything like this
[23:15] before how could they write a song about
[23:18] something they never saw amen I I I got
[23:21] to point what I'm saying amen and so is
[23:23] it in Revelations 5 when John sings a
[23:27] new song Nobody had ever seen the
[23:29] opening of the Lamb's Book of Life so
[23:32] how could they sing about the
[23:34] revelations of the book until it was
[23:36] opened up do y'all realize that there's
[23:39] millions of people who are written in
[23:41] the Lamb's Book of Life there are people
[23:43] written from Adam until our day written
[23:45] in the Lamb's Book of Life but do you
[23:47] know that you are the first people in
[23:49] the seasons of the world to ever know
[23:51] their name was written in that book amen
[23:54] that God has opened that book in our
[23:57] season and if if there ever was a
[23:59] generation that ought to be able to
[24:01] Worship in the Revelation and the
[24:04] newness of song in the inspiration of
[24:06] this hour I know that we have
[24:08] songwriters I know we have songwriters
[24:10] of every kind but even sometimes worldly
[24:13] people write songs Under the inspiration
[24:16] that's been released amen you don't
[24:18] think God released the seals and it only
[24:20] affected the bride do you the whole
[24:22] world felt the effects of the Revival of
[24:25] the message of the hour there are songs
[24:27] written and preachers preach sermons had
[24:29] never even heard of the message amen but
[24:32] there's inspiration that's been released
[24:34] and men get under that inspiration well
[24:37] how much more then should the Church of
[24:39] the Living God get under the inspiration
[24:42] of the Holy Ghost and the power of God
[24:44] somebody told me here a while back well
[24:46] y'all can't sing that song cuz certain
[24:47] certain person wrote it I said my
[24:49] goodness think about this amen they are
[24:52] living off of the benefits of my
[24:54] inspiration amen and now you're telling
[24:57] me I can't take what belongs to me that
[24:59] song don't belong to the world that song
[25:02] don't belong to those songwriters it
[25:04] belongs to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[25:06] there would be no life if it wasn't for
[25:09] the bride any inspiration you hear
[25:11] that's a Godly inspiration is coming
[25:14] from the benefits of the bride of Christ
[25:16] being on the earth that would be no
[25:19] worship outside if there was nothing
[25:21] amen coming from the inspiration of God
[25:24] it's in that season of worship now you
[25:26] might say brother Wayne how'd you get
[25:28] there so quick let me let me just go
[25:29] back to Daniel the 3rd Chapter at the
[25:31] same time that they're going to worship
[25:33] that image isn't it beautiful that the
[25:36] devil does exactly what God does at the
[25:39] same time that God is introducing an
[25:42] image of worship so does the devil
[25:44] introduce an image of worship and they
[25:46] both predate it by song Amen God's order
[25:50] is song and Nebuchadnezzar is leading
[25:53] Worship in song Amen he's literally
[25:56] before he introduces his word of worship
[25:59] he has literally got them singing and
[26:01] playing and got everybody together
[26:04] setting an atmosphere to get everybody
[26:06] in One mind in one Accord get everybody
[26:09] in One agreement of worship amen the
[26:11] whole world is moved into worship by
[26:14] music then how important should music
[26:16] really be amen I I was just studying the
[26:19] other day I was in a ministers meeting
[26:21] and I thought it was amazing God pulls
[26:23] us in a ministers meeting at the same
[26:25] time concerning music and that I'm
[26:27] preaching on worships I thought well God
[26:29] just knows exactly but in doing so I
[26:31] found some powerful scripture and quotes
[26:34] where the Prophet teaches us that that's
[26:36] exactly the order of God for the battle
[26:38] do you know that God always his order is
[26:41] music that's God's order how many you
[26:43] ever read about when Jehoshaphat had
[26:45] seen the had seen if you ever heard me
[26:47] speak on that message Against All Odds I
[26:50] took it out of when Jehoshaphat seen a
[26:52] multitude coming against him and when he
[26:54] seen that multitude he went to the house
[26:56] of God and began to pray and invoke the
[26:58] name of the Lord and when he got done
[27:00] praying one prophesied remember one
[27:03] prophesied and got in the spirit and
[27:05] said that tomorrow you go out to battle
[27:07] but it won't be your battle this is the
[27:09] Lord's battle and he said he told him to
[27:11] appoint singers and to appoint musicians
[27:15] and put them out in front of the Army
[27:17] and the Bible records that when they
[27:19] begin to worship God said to them that
[27:22] you will not even need to fight in this
[27:24] battle for this battle belongs to the
[27:26] Lord I don't think sometimes we
[27:28] understand the power of praise in our
[27:30] music amen I I think we got gifts amen
[27:33] that have been squatched amen because
[27:35] they're fearful that somebody's going to
[27:37] think something or somebody's going to
[27:38] feel something I I just have to be
[27:40] honest with you I believe our preachers
[27:42] are to preach with all their heart I
[27:44] believe our musicians are to play with
[27:46] all their heart I believe singers are to
[27:49] sing with all their heart if we're doing
[27:51] it for somebody then have a seat but if
[27:53] we're doing it for the Lord amen it
[27:55] deserves every ounce of our heart we are
[27:58] to let go of our fear lift up our heads
[28:02] and praise God because you can worship
[28:04] amen like an angel can't even
[28:07] worship my amen it's exactly what God
[28:11] did he set the music out in front of the
[28:14] battle and the Bible said amen that by
[28:16] the time that the church got there and
[28:19] begin to praise God set up an ambush and
[28:23] the Devils were dead and instead of
[28:25] three days of fighting there was three
[28:27] days of gathering spools I'll tell you
[28:29] what you get your song service and let
[28:31] the spirit of God begin to move and you
[28:33] let people get in the service and let
[28:35] them sing and clap their hands and
[28:37] worship God Amen and turn loose in the
[28:40] spirit amen and there are things you are
[28:42] fighting amen that you won't have to
[28:44] fight the entire service amen but
[28:46] instead of spending a service of
[28:48] fighting you can send a service of of
[28:51] reaping the benefits of the spools of
[28:53] the Dead enemies that's in your life
[28:55] when you begin to worship amen I Believe
[28:58] In Worship and I Believe In Praise I
[29:00] believe in it I believe it's the truth I
[29:02] believe we ought to worship this is a
[29:04] bride's Revival amen God sets it in
[29:07] order amen now sometimes amen God gives
[29:10] us another scripture in the book of
[29:11] Kings concerning amen that when the
[29:13] children of Israel went to a dry Place
[29:15] seven days remember and they got in a
[29:17] dry place and they they wanted to get
[29:19] out of this dry place and they said
[29:21] anybody can help us they said well
[29:22] Elisha who poured water on the hands of
[29:25] Elijah bring him out here remember what
[29:27] he did he got out there and found out
[29:30] that Israel found out that Israel and
[29:33] and Judah had joined together and he was
[29:35] hot about it he couldn't believe that
[29:37] Jehoshaphat had taken in and was and was
[29:40] keeping the company that he was he was a
[29:42] little bit upset the brother man said he
[29:44] was he said he was a little out of humor
[29:46] he said his he he kind of like his
[29:48] temper had flared up on him a little bit
[29:50] and he was upset about the situation and
[29:53] you know what he said he said somebody
[29:54] go get me a
[29:56] minstral somebody go get get me a
[29:58] musician and let him begin to play
[30:01] listen friend that was that was what
[30:03] brother Ram said in the Bible and here's
[30:04] what he said concerning that he said
[30:06] shame on you that don't believe in music
[30:08] in the church he said shame on you for
[30:11] not believing in music he said that's
[30:13] God's way he said watch now the whole
[30:16] church was depending on a vision from
[30:19] God to get out of that situation he said
[30:22] but the vision wouldn't come until the
[30:24] spirit got right he said so the order of
[30:27] the church is to bring in music get the
[30:30] spirit right and then the prophets can
[30:33] prophesy then the Visions can be seen
[30:35] then the gifts can come into order if
[30:38] you want to see a real Ministry and an
[30:41] activated gift of a Preacher let the
[30:43] atmosphere of worship into the building
[30:45] under music and every Spirit come under
[30:48] control oh come on Church brother man
[30:50] said if you come in in a bad of humor
[30:52] you ain't going to get nothing out of
[30:53] that service you come in here all messed
[30:55] up I know I've done it I I've seen
[30:57] people do I've sat and preached to
[30:59] people and at 34s the way through
[31:00] service before they finally decide to
[31:02] even crack a grin amen they so mad maybe
[31:04] upset at the doctor upset at their wife
[31:06] upset at me upset at somebody else amen
[31:09] just upset whatsoever but that should
[31:11] have been settled in the music and
[31:13] should have been something in your heart
[31:15] released in that season in that hour
[31:18] because you're being drawn into worship
[31:20] amen you want to see Visions break out
[31:22] get in the spirit of God you want to see
[31:25] miracles happen get in the spirit of God
[31:28] but his Spirit has an order now somebody
[31:30] say well brother Wayne I'm not a
[31:31] musician amen or I'm not Elisha but you
[31:34] should still enter into worship but you
[31:36] know Amen brother bam said this he said
[31:39] you might not be an Elisha he said but
[31:41] if you're a musician you can be the man
[31:43] that brought the anointing on Elisha
[31:46] amen that brought the vision in the camp
[31:48] I tell you it's a powerful thing thank
[31:50] you for your for your song leading
[31:52] tonight brother Alex amen he brought me
[31:54] out on the song I thought was very
[31:55] fitting to what I was about to get to
[31:56] tonight and amen do you see that the
[31:58] music amen the music should set the
[32:01] stage the music should set the order
[32:04] that's why we don't cramp down the music
[32:06] that's why we don't have a bunch of
[32:07] rules and regulations and somebody said
[32:09] well brother Wayne shouldn't there be
[32:10] all these rules and regulations well I
[32:12] the problem I have with that is you got
[32:14] no absolutes from the prophet on what
[32:16] they should be so what you do is you set
[32:19] up a rule that is according to one man
[32:21] and now you got one man telling you what
[32:23] who can sing and who can't sing what you
[32:25] can sing what you can't sing now we've
[32:28] locked the holy ghost out of the church
[32:30] and the people are sitting there
[32:32] wondering why the spirit of worship
[32:34] doesn't come it's because we locked out
[32:37] the leader of worship but if we would
[32:39] let the Holy Ghost come in he'll tell
[32:42] you what songs to sing he'll tell you
[32:45] what Spirit to have and when he comes in
[32:47] the building he'll settle things and
[32:49] bring in gifts among the church now see
[32:52] what they did is they set up a music and
[32:54] their music led to man worship it led to
[32:58] imagery isn't that something amen that
[33:01] you can you can start approaching
[33:03] manmade worship through
[33:08] music isn't that something in other
[33:11] words I can make it where you're
[33:12] worshiping
[33:14] me or another or a pope or it's
[33:18] according to that what you're bringing
[33:20] so that Liberty in the music should be
[33:23] according to the leadership of the Holy
[33:25] Ghost somebody said brother Wayne how do
[33:27] you how do you settle all that so I tell
[33:29] you how you really settle is get you
[33:30] some godall song leaders let them get
[33:33] filled with the Holy Ghost and then get
[33:34] out of their way and let him
[33:36] lead then get out of the way and let
[33:38] them worship amen and then get behind
[33:40] them come on church amen when you get a
[33:43] man of God leading songs amen he
[33:45] shouldn't be he shouldn't have to fool
[33:46] with a congregation Wonder amen we ought
[33:48] to get behind him sobody well I think it
[33:50] ought to be a slower song we get behind
[33:52] him and God will slowing him down amen
[33:55] it ought to be faster get behind him and
[33:57] God will speak him up amen God can lead
[33:59] a man if we all come together under the
[34:03] unity of the Holy Ghost let the power of
[34:05] God come in the building and the spirit
[34:08] of God will shake the church woo Glory
[34:13] my you see what it is it's about it's
[34:16] about worship everything is about
[34:18] worship everything that we're talking
[34:20] about is worship our church is about
[34:22] worship your life is about worship it's
[34:24] a war of worship between what are you
[34:27] going to worship ship God or what some
[34:29] man has set up what some man has put
[34:31] forward with the Church of the Living
[34:33] God Amen refuses to worship under the
[34:37] dictation of any man they are following
[34:40] a pillar of light and they're going to
[34:42] the resurrection since we don't have a
[34:44] headquarters in Jeffersonville we'll be
[34:46] following the angel of the lord we don't
[34:48] have a headquarters in Rome we'll be
[34:51] following the angel of the Lord our
[34:53] headquarters has been set up in
[34:56] heaven
[34:59] yeah I could name a few other places to
[35:02] go along with that but we
[35:03] won't amen but you got to notice that it
[35:06] must come leadership from God Amen now
[35:09] what it is you see is God doesn't change
[35:12] people say well I don't know I don't
[35:14] know if people if if God likes music
[35:16] brother BR said listen God likes music
[35:18] and so do I he said and God ain't
[35:21] changed amen you said well that's all
[35:23] preservice but the after effects of the
[35:25] church do you know brother B teaches
[35:27] that we shouldn't just dismiss and go
[35:28] home he actually said that the early
[35:31] church they love the after effects of
[35:33] the Holy Spirit bathing them and that
[35:35] early church in the time of irus and
[35:37] Martin them the death of the Lord Jesus
[35:39] when the church was going forth before
[35:40] it went into Catholicism oh they love
[35:42] that they love to sit in the service
[35:44] after the word and lift their hands and
[35:47] worship in the spirit I have seen
[35:49] Visions in the middle of that worship I
[35:51] have seen miracles in the middle of that
[35:53] worship I personally have been sitting
[35:56] on the platform when the worship Worship
[35:57] in the end of the service and see
[35:59] Visions right in the church I've seen
[36:01] Miracles take place I've seen people get
[36:04] the Holy Ghost I've seen homes fixed and
[36:06] delivered and nobody doing nothing but
[36:08] people just worshiping God after the
[36:11] word has come forward I believe if God
[36:13] is God enough to come down and talk to
[36:16] us we ought to believe it enough that we
[36:18] can worship him for his talk and what
[36:21] he's done for us I don't know about you
[36:23] but I'm ready to worship God I'm ready
[36:25] to tell him that he's a mighty God that
[36:27] he's a powerful God that he's the god of
[36:29] Abraham Isaac and of Jacob my Lord think
[36:33] about it amen now people say brother
[36:36] Wayne can it get too fanatical
[36:37] absolutely it can and I'm not talking
[36:39] about that amen anything that that gets
[36:42] too far I promise you amen the the
[36:44] pastor will correct that it'll get right
[36:46] back in line amen but but you recognize
[36:50] amen that there's got to be an order to
[36:52] it there has to be a worship amen now
[36:56] now think about this because getting
[36:58] getting back to these boys I think it's
[37:00] amazing the Bible said the whole world
[37:02] was worshiping do you know that there
[37:04] was more Israelites in Babylon than
[37:06] these four men Hebrew three Hebrew
[37:09] children and Daniel four men there was
[37:12] multiple accounts of princes and
[37:14] magicians and wise men and and Craftsman
[37:18] they were all there and in the Bible
[37:19] even names 10,000 of them was
[37:22] there but there was only four of them
[37:24] that wouldn't
[37:26] bow there there was a bunch of people
[37:28] there but there was only four of them
[37:29] wouldn't bow I want you to watch this it
[37:32] wasn't until that time that we found out
[37:34] who was
[37:35] who cuz see see the chameleon the
[37:38] chameleon uh version of humanity is that
[37:41] they can move with a
[37:43] crowd they can blend in it's called a
[37:45] political Spirit they can blend in
[37:48] wherever they are they can blend in amen
[37:50] but at this moment in time you're going
[37:53] to worship God or you're going to
[37:55] worship the image you're going to
[37:56] worship the word or you're going to
[37:58] worship the image you see what it was
[38:00] God doesn't force you to worship but he
[38:03] forces you to choose who you will
[38:05] worship when it's the time of worship
[38:08] you see it's a it's a spiritual
[38:10] discernment one day amen everything was
[38:12] good but the CH but all a sudden Jesus
[38:14] looked at Peter said who do you say I am
[38:16] then it was a it was a command to
[38:18] discern what you're looking at
[38:20] everything is good until this hour and
[38:23] the moment that they begin to worship
[38:25] the whole world it was a moment that was
[38:28] demanding of a discernment from these
[38:29] three who were children of what would
[38:31] they were going to worship now God was
[38:33] not going to force them to worship but
[38:34] he would force them to make a choice to
[38:36] worship either I'll worship this and if
[38:40] you don't make a choice it is a choice
[38:42] to worship the
[38:44] Beast amen if you don't worship by
[38:47] choice it is a choice to worship the
[38:50] Beast do you see what it is many people
[38:52] say well brother Wayne what is what is
[38:55] the mark of the beast the Bible says it
[38:56] now the mark Mar of the Beast brother
[38:57] bam says to the mark of the beast in Los
[38:59] Angeles he says this he said listen I've
[39:01] seen guys set up charts he said take up
[39:03] this whole wall he said to explain the
[39:06] mark of the beast he said I believe it's
[39:08] much more simple than that he said
[39:09] matter of fact I only have about three
[39:11] pages of notes to to speak on this and
[39:14] I'm going to take you the scripture he
[39:15] said now some people believe it's in the
[39:18] past some believe it's in the future he
[39:20] said but I'm going to prove to you it's
[39:22] right here and he said what is the Seal
[39:24] of God it's the baptism of the Holy
[39:26] Ghost chapter 4 he said what is the mark
[39:30] of the beast he said it's rejecting it
[39:33] isn't that beautiful amen it's that
[39:35] simple the Seal of God is the baptism of
[39:38] the Holy Ghost and there are people that
[39:40] don't even believe in get in the Holy
[39:42] Ghost but it's the Seal of God and to
[39:45] reject it is the mark of the beast
[39:47] brother B said there's your two classes
[39:49] then then we then we got to be careful I
[39:51] know I've already preached on it so we
[39:53] ain't going to go there but you got to
[39:54] be careful cuz the devil's selling
[39:56] everything is the mark of the now all
[39:58] these conspiracy theories and it's
[40:00] politics and it's communism and it's
[40:01] China and it's the vaccine it's co and
[40:04] it's this and it's this and this listen
[40:06] amen that don't have anything to do with
[40:07] the bride of Christ has nothing to do
[40:09] with the Church of the Living God if you
[40:11] have been sealed in by the baptism of
[40:14] the Holy Ghost you are sealed unto the
[40:17] day of your Redemption and I tell you
[40:19] one thing that's going to happen this
[40:21] church is going to raise up in a
[40:23] resurrection before the Satan can ever
[40:26] touch her amen now now watch what
[40:30] happens when this when this
[40:32] Nebuchadnezzar saw that the boys defied
[40:35] his word he couldn't let that go could
[40:38] he just couldn't let that go so he had
[40:40] to single them out and say to them now
[40:44] it's come to you now as an individual
[40:47] now what are you going now there was
[40:48] three of them boys but it was their own
[40:49] personal stand on the word of what they
[40:52] were going to do I think it's amazing
[40:54] amen that the whole world was doing this
[40:56] and these boys would
[40:58] isn't it amazing the whole world to do
[41:00] something but there's just a few that
[41:02] want now I I think it's I think it's uh
[41:05] I think it's uh mentionable that if you
[41:08] read Daniel chapter 1 and you were with
[41:09] us you'll find out that they had already
[41:12] purposed in their heart that they
[41:14] wouldn't defile themselves with the
[41:16] king's meat isn't it funny they wouldn't
[41:19] drink the King's Wine but in Revelation
[41:22] 17 it ends up to be the wine of
[41:25] fornications they wouldn't drink his
[41:27] wine
[41:28] they wouldn't eat his meat they wouldn't
[41:30] dance to his tune and they wouldn't bow
[41:32] to his image these boys were just a
[41:35] these boys were just something else
[41:37] wasn't they they were just hard to get
[41:39] along with couldn't you be just a little
[41:41] more pliable and get under our
[41:44] regulations and rules everybody else is
[41:47] doing it everybody else is join the
[41:49] everybody else thinks it's okay
[41:52] everybody else is ready to get on board
[41:54] what's wrong with you boys don't you see
[41:56] that you can have a little better future
[41:58] you can have more friends and be widely
[42:00] accepted if you just maybe just kneel
[42:04] maybe maybe everybody don't even have to
[42:05] see you do it if you just politely kneel
[42:08] to this image amen you know your your
[42:11] life would go out better for you and I
[42:13] imagine amen that on Nebuchadnezzar had
[42:15] some people to point out Amen to these
[42:18] Hebrew children to kind of pour down
[42:20] their resolve amen can you imagine when
[42:21] he turn around and look now I ain't
[42:23] talking about our deacons here but can
[42:24] you imagine when he turn around and pick
[42:26] some deacons out the crowd and said look
[42:28] at there there's the deacons bowing over
[42:29] there can you imagine when they turn
[42:32] around look there was a group of
[42:33] ministers over there and they were all
[42:35] bowed at the same time and here these
[42:37] little boys were amen with a heart set
[42:39] they were going to serve God and they
[42:41] couldn't figure out why them Elders were
[42:43] doing that they couldn't figure out why
[42:45] are they bowing like that why why would
[42:47] they put down a knee to this kind of
[42:50] thing they it it just didn't it just
[42:52] didn't make sense in their mind amen but
[42:54] you got to find out that these boys were
[42:56] burn
[42:57] these boys were born for a certain
[43:00] purpose and they could not do anything
[43:03] else because it was what was in them now
[43:05] the prophet of God tells us some
[43:06] beautiful stories concerning these boys
[43:09] but I think it's powerful when you see
[43:11] amen that they were sitting here looking
[43:13] at the most powerful man on the face of
[43:16] the
[43:17] Earth they were looking at the most
[43:20] powerful man on the face of the Earth
[43:22] they were looking at their own
[43:23] destruction in a fiery furnace they were
[43:26] looking at the end of their wealth the
[43:28] end of their lives the end of their
[43:30] popularity the end of their Ministries
[43:33] the end of all friendships they were
[43:36] literally having to put everything on
[43:38] the line and the only thing they would
[43:41] have to do Amen to get everything back
[43:43] as that one simple little thing is just
[43:45] put down a knee that's all you got to do
[43:48] just take a knee that's all we'll let
[43:50] you we'll let you have whatever you want
[43:51] just take a knee that's all you got to
[43:54] do just bow but you see there was
[43:56] something different about these boys and
[43:59] he didn't even know who he was talking
[44:01] to he didn't realize who he was talking
[44:04] to these boys were the Hebrew children
[44:07] amen they were the true Seed of
[44:09] Abraham I think it's powerful when you
[44:12] go back and read here Amen in the Book
[44:14] of Daniel 3rd Chapter 16th verse he says
[44:17] they said to him oh King we are not
[44:20] careful to answer thee in this
[44:22] matter oh King we are not careful to
[44:25] answer thee in this matter I think
[44:27] that's powerful we're not careful of our
[44:29] answer in other words we've already got
[44:32] our mind made up it really doesn't
[44:34] matter what you do we've already made up
[44:37] our mind what we're going to do and
[44:39] we're not careful to give the answer
[44:41] we're not we're not going to make this a
[44:42] political speech we're we're going to
[44:44] say it right out we will not worship
[44:47] we're going to just put it out we will
[44:48] not bow we will not follow we only have
[44:51] one God that we're able to serve and
[44:53] that's it that's all we can do isn't
[44:56] that something these boys is going to
[44:58] answer like that there ain't nothing
[45:00] like a madeup
[45:01] mind you ever get a child of God with a
[45:04] madeup mind and you'll never get nothing
[45:06] else out of them you ever get it up come
[45:08] on brother Howard you get somebody don't
[45:10] have no double mind these boys didn't
[45:13] have a double mind they didn't have a
[45:15] mind to serve the world and serve their
[45:16] God they had a heart that they were
[45:18] going to serve God and that alone that's
[45:20] the only thing they were able to
[45:22] do I imagine whenever the King start
[45:25] twisting their arm he I imagine they
[45:27] could have pulled up a scripture and
[45:28] said God had not given us the spirit of
[45:31] fear but of power and of love and a
[45:35] sound mind for God has give a sound mind
[45:38] to the church and it's a mind to serve
[45:41] the Lord can you think about God putting
[45:44] something in a man amen the scripture
[45:46] tells us here amen that the that the
[45:49] Hebrew children said the god whom we
[45:51] serve is able to Deliver Us from this
[45:54] burning furnace to deliver us out of the
[45:56] hand of th King he he says but oh he
[46:00] says listen it be known unto thee Oh
[46:02] King we will not serve thy Gods nor
[46:05] worship the golden image that thou has
[46:06] set up in other words it doesn't matter
[46:10] what our God does we've already made up
[46:13] our mind not determined on what God is
[46:16] going to do or about to do we've made up
[46:18] our mind what we are going to do because
[46:21] they had already been taught by
[46:22] scripture they can't worship two
[46:24] different gods they already knew the
[46:26] first commandment is have no other God
[46:28] before me and do not bow and worship any
[46:31] other God what did God tell Joshua when
[46:33] he went in the land he said you're going
[46:35] to go in the land and they're going to
[46:37] set up Idols but don't you bow to their
[46:40] images don't you bow to their gods amen
[46:43] what was it amen Joshua knew you can't
[46:45] bow to these gods and become Victorious
[46:48] you can't bow to these gods and serve
[46:50] God and these men knew this they knew
[46:52] they couldn't bow and serve God at the
[46:55] same time amen they already made up
[46:57] their mind who they were going to serve
[46:59] and they were going to serve God because
[47:01] they were the Seed of Abraham do you see
[47:05] now take take just for a moment and
[47:06] think about where these boys are they're
[47:08] in the valley of
[47:10] shenar which is a portion of the land of
[47:13] Babylon the valley of shenar is where
[47:15] Abraham come from to begin with and God
[47:18] had called Abraham out of a polytheism
[47:22] of multiplicities of false gods and they
[47:25] took him in a land where he would have a
[47:27] seed who was fatherless who was married
[47:30] to a barren woman but he would have a
[47:32] seed and that seed would be of the Seed
[47:35] of Abraham who would only believe in one
[47:37] God now hundreds of years later this
[47:40] seed is carried back in these boys and
[47:44] they're back in the same land in the
[47:46] same places and they're being tried by
[47:49] the same Gods amen and this seed has
[47:52] already been tested through time and has
[47:55] returned for approving ground in Babylon
[47:58] can you imagine friend that God brought
[48:01] that seed all the way back to Babylon to
[48:03] prove to that devil that this seed will
[48:05] not worship you no matter where you put
[48:07] it if you put it in Babylon if you put
[48:10] this seed in the desert if you put this
[48:12] seed anywhere Abraham's seed has been
[48:15] proven to be a worshiper of only one
[48:19] God now this this wasn't this wasn't a
[48:22] test for the first time on this sea
[48:24] brother Mike when God got Abraham
[48:26] remember made him wait 25
[48:28] years he waited 25 years before he could
[48:31] ever get a son and at the end of that 25
[48:34] years he took him by a challenge from
[48:37] God to test his faith and said take that
[48:40] boy upon the mountain and destroy him by
[48:42] fire cut him up put him on the Altar and
[48:44] burn him and Abraham obeyed
[48:47] God he tested the seed or the faith of
[48:51] Abraham to destroy the promise that had
[48:54] been given and Abraham said it was God
[48:57] that gave him to me it's God that'll
[48:59] raise him up again do you see the faith
[49:01] of Abraham knew God give it to me by the
[49:04] supernatural God will raise it up by the
[49:07] supernatural he knew the supernatural
[49:09] hand of God and watch when he was tested
[49:11] to its limit there was something that
[49:13] come behind it and when it did God said
[49:16] to him that thy seed shall possess the
[49:20] gates of its enemy now that same seed
[49:23] that was in Abraham was in those boys
[49:26] and they were before a gate of fire and
[49:28] that seed had already been tested let me
[49:30] put it to you like this them that are of
[49:32] the same faith that Abraham is they
[49:34] shall possess the gates of their enemy
[49:37] in other words the seed that they were
[49:39] of was not able to Bow but rather that
[49:43] seed had Amen to worship one God had no
[49:46] choice but to worship one God now the
[49:49] thing is that these boys worshiping God
[49:51] seemed like that it was going to be the
[49:53] end seemed like it would be the
[49:54] destruction but the thing is is man is
[49:57] not able to see the Unseen it takes a
[49:59] prophet to see it and in this generation
[50:02] we have had a prophet comes in and
[50:03] breaks in the scripture right here and
[50:06] says while they were being carried to
[50:08] the furnace there was something going on
[50:10] in heaven don't you ever think that when
[50:13] you're facing a furnace that you're
[50:15] standing by yourself don't you ever
[50:18] think when you're facing fire you're
[50:20] standing by yourself but let me assure
[50:22] you if you're in the middle of a trial
[50:25] amen there's a conversation going on in
[50:28] heaven concerning the Seed of Abraham
[50:32] amen I tell you brother Braham helps us
[50:33] amen cuz you think you're all right
[50:35] brother B said he knows he knows what
[50:37] you're going through and brother Bram
[50:38] breaks into Revelation goes up into the
[50:40] heavens and he said I can see a
[50:42] conversation going on up
[50:44] there con conversation concerning the
[50:47] Hebrew children and them going to the
[50:49] fiery furnace while them boys are on
[50:51] their way to be burned by the forc
[50:55] religion of the age God is up in heaven
[50:57] discussing their discussion and their
[51:00] choices that they made with the angels
[51:02] of heaven brother brandom he opens up
[51:04] things so beautifully he said do you see
[51:06] one of the Angels even Gabriel runs up
[51:08] draws his sword said God have you not
[51:11] seen what they're doing down there have
[51:13] you not seen the pressure that they're
[51:15] putting on your people have you not seen
[51:18] what's going on and God said yeah I've
[51:20] seen it Gabriel he said well then let me
[51:22] go down there and take my sword and let
[51:23] me destroy him he said no Gabriel no
[51:26] Gabriel you just go over and sit and
[51:27] wait a moment I see what's going on then
[51:31] brother brandom said he said then them
[51:33] wormwood how many knows who wormwood is
[51:35] he's the angel that flooded the the
[51:37] world in the time of
[51:38] Noah he said wormwood run up there and
[51:42] said Lord let me go down there I'm going
[51:44] to put the fire out I'll open up The
[51:47] Fountains of the deep I'll flood this
[51:49] Babylon I'll put the fire out I'll
[51:52] destroy I'll show what kind of God we
[51:55] are serving brother B said he told
[51:56] Gabriel Gabriel no you can't go and and
[52:00] and and because I won't let Gabriel go I
[52:02] can't let wormwood go he said see
[52:05] because this is not a job for angels He
[52:08] said this is a man-sized job and I'm
[52:10] going down there myself can you imagine
[52:14] when God stood up off of the
[52:16] throne come on Church there's a time in
[52:19] the Bible he's going to stand up and
[52:22] when he stood up off of the throne was
[52:23] in the same hour that the image of the
[52:26] Beast was trying to destroy the saints
[52:28] of God and he stood up off of his throne
[52:30] and said I'll go down there myself and I
[52:32] love how brother Bram does it he said he
[52:34] went over there and put on his
[52:35] Rhinestone Cowboy Boots amen with his
[52:38] big old big old Spurs on them he said he
[52:41] put his chaps on reached over and pulled
[52:43] up a thunder head mounted it and began
[52:46] to ride into the into the Earth he said
[52:48] while he was riding that zigzag boat of
[52:51] lightning coming down out of Glory he
[52:53] said there he pass the Sea of life and
[52:56] he reached over and grabbed a palm leaf
[52:58] off of one of the
[53:00] trees he said when he when he rode into
[53:03] that fire he said he had that palm leaf
[53:06] and begin to bring the breezes from the
[53:08] sea of life into that fire and he begin
[53:11] to Fan back the Flames the prophet of
[53:14] God said them them Hebrew children were
[53:16] right there at the gate he said and in
[53:19] one place he said it like this he said
[53:21] and the reason they went ahead and
[53:23] stepped in because they had already seen
[53:25] he was in the fire waiting on them they
[53:28] knew that I step in the fire but I'm
[53:30] going to step in the presence of God let
[53:32] me tell you something young people
[53:33] you're never going to be a long serving
[53:35] our God you might get into an hour when
[53:38] choices seem like you're going to lose
[53:40] everything but it's not the end it's the
[53:43] beginning it's not the end of these boys
[53:46] it's the beginning of these boys when
[53:49] they get in that fire brother Bram said
[53:50] he was over there planting the
[53:53] Flames I love I love how brother Bram
[53:55] tells it he he said it was faning in
[53:57] Flames back and they were having
[54:00] Fellowship it was hot enough that the
[54:03] men that threw them in had died so don't
[54:05] think that the Flames had got any cooler
[54:08] but the breezes of Calvary had cooled
[54:10] the Flames to them until they had become
[54:14] fireproof brother you talk about
[54:16] fireproof that's a Church of the Living
[54:18] God that has become so full of the fire
[54:21] of God until Devil's fires can't hurt
[54:24] them amen the fire of God was upon their
[54:26] lives and there they stood in the middle
[54:28] of it brother B said they were in there
[54:30] having a
[54:32] conversation fellowship and I I always
[54:35] love this you probably heard me mention
[54:36] it before because I love to tell it he
[54:38] said they were fellowship and I always
[54:40] when brother bam said they were
[54:40] fellowship and I searched for a while
[54:42] what were they talking about brother
[54:43] brandom I want to know what kind of
[54:45] conversation does God have with a man in
[54:47] the middle of a fire that's what I want
[54:49] to know brother Bram said they were
[54:50] discussing their
[54:52] future amen there they are in the middle
[54:54] of a fire and they're discussing the
[54:56] future they're not talking about their
[54:58] end look right here in this age when the
[55:01] son of man descended in the middle of
[55:04] this wicked age what did he do he talked
[55:07] about a future home things that are to
[55:10] be he talked about a glorified body he
[55:13] talks about a theophany brother let me
[55:15] tell you if that don't make you want to
[55:17] Worship in the middle of the fire listen
[55:20] if God is in the fire then I'll get in
[55:22] the fire with God look at what oh
[55:25] brother look at what they did when they
[55:27] got in that fire amen that there was a
[55:29] there was an anointing in there talking
[55:31] about their future home and the Bible
[55:33] even says amen that when when they saw
[55:35] it going on the king actually answered
[55:38] and said didn't we put three men in
[55:40] there didn't we put three men in there
[55:43] but I see four men walking in there and
[55:46] one is like another Son of God somebody
[55:47] said brother Brandon was that Daniel he
[55:49] said no it was Jesus he was one liking
[55:51] under the Son of God and he was right
[55:53] there in the fires with them I'll tell
[55:55] you what the Bible says said though that
[55:57] you make your bed in hell I will be
[56:00] there come on Church the angels of the
[56:02] Lord are encamped about them that fear
[56:05] his name think about this amen when when
[56:08] God was right there in the middle of
[56:09] that fire with them boys and there he
[56:11] was discussing the future home that
[56:13] Fourth Man was standing there now y'all
[56:15] ain't y'all y' y'all's message Believers
[56:18] y'all know that son of man goes through
[56:20] justification sanctification baptism of
[56:22] the Holy Ghost and then the son of man
[56:25] the Lord in self isn't it something he's
[56:28] descending into the middle of Satan's
[56:30] Eden it's seven times harder it's a Ley
[56:34] and age there's destruction everywhere
[56:37] there's Force everywhere to get you to
[56:39] bow to entertainment get you to bow to
[56:41] popularity get you to bow to everything
[56:44] but if you won't bow as a God in the
[56:47] middle of the fire and is standing there
[56:49] that a fellowship with you about your
[56:51] future home my goodness I don't have
[56:54] time to preach it but I'll say it to you
[56:55] like this and Corinthians 10 the Bible
[56:57] said with every Temptation there is a
[56:59] way of Escape if God has made a fire
[57:03] he's made a way to get out of the fire
[57:06] and the presence of God is our Escape in
[57:08] this age listen let me tell you amen
[57:11] these boys were in the middle of that
[57:12] fire said brother Wayne it must have
[57:13] been awful insensitive of God to let
[57:16] them go through such a thing but let me
[57:17] tell you God already had a way to fix it
[57:21] he already knew that he would take the
[57:23] heat out of that fire brother Bram said
[57:25] he'll take the he out of that trial if
[57:27] he's in there with you amen you'll
[57:29] suffer a trial but he take the heed out
[57:31] of it and he's a Fourth Man in it had
[57:33] you ever seen somebody go through a fire
[57:36] without getting any effects of the fire
[57:39] I I'm just studying here and I thought
[57:41] Lord amen what what effects would Le DEA
[57:44] have on the church what what what what
[57:46] effects will all the trials have there's
[57:49] some of you been through things that you
[57:50] would think y'all be just wrecked and
[57:52] done amen I I've sat and thought about
[57:54] families and some of the things they've
[57:55] lived through and the situations of
[57:57] person and you think my they'll just be
[57:59] wrecked forever and you see them at
[58:01] church next week they're shouting
[58:02] praising the Lord and you're thinking
[58:05] how do they do that how how do they make
[58:07] it through all these kind of things and
[58:10] there's no effect but if you read right
[58:12] here the Bible said that Nebuchadnezzar
[58:14] noted that they put three men Bound in
[58:17] the fire but he saw four men walking
[58:21] loose he saw four men brother B said the
[58:24] only effect the fire had on them is when
[58:26] they put them in they were bound and
[58:28] when they come out they were loose let
[58:30] me tell you something I believe amen
[58:33] that the devil amen he loses every time
[58:36] that he fools with the children of God I
[58:38] tell you what every Temptation every
[58:40] trial that ever come to you it cannot
[58:42] harm you all things work together for
[58:44] the good of them that love God and them
[58:47] that are called according to his purpose
[58:49] I'm talking to you tonight church amen
[58:52] when God lets a trial come your way he's
[58:54] not going to let this F has destroy you
[58:57] he's going to loose you from things that
[58:59] you have suffered in your life my can
[59:02] you imagine all bound up before the
[59:04] trial and there they out there in that
[59:06] fire glorifying god walking around with
[59:09] a son of man in the middle of
[59:11] Temptations and trials out there waving
[59:13] their hand and worshiping God their feet
[59:16] was free their hands were free their
[59:18] mouths were free their lies were free
[59:21] come on church I believe that there's a
[59:23] freedom in the house of God from manmade
[59:26] worship and ideas of man there's got to
[59:29] be something that'll loose the church
[59:31] this message didn't come to bind you it
[59:33] didn't come put you under a bunch of
[59:35] legal matters and you got to doth this
[59:37] ey and doth this te and you got to you

[59:43] message come to give life and it come to
[59:46] give Abundant Life and it come to put
[59:48] something in you and it make you worship
[59:50] God in tress and Oneness of the Holy
[59:55] Ghost

[59:59] trial and I wonder how it's going to
[1:00:01] affect me let me tell you how it's going
[1:00:02] to affect you you're not even going to
[1:00:03] have the smell of smoke on you brother
