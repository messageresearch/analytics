[6:44] if there be one good thing done this
[6:46] evening Lord we give you all the glory
[6:48] and the honor and the praise we thank
[6:51] you father in Jesus name amen and amen
[6:55] and God bless you tonight amen if you
[6:58] have your Bibles with like to turn to
[7:00] the Book of
[7:01] Daniel we'd want to look in Daniel chap
[7:04] 11 um the 32nd verse amen I took a
[7:08] little pause uh the other Sunday from a
[7:11] from a bit of a of a series we've been
[7:14] preaching on I don't usually do that
[7:16] much but when the Lord just directs you
[7:18] to do something then you just follow
[7:19] that direction and what's amazing is is
[7:23] usually he has an intention in it and
[7:25] you'll do it and then you'll find out
[7:27] that that will tie directly back and God
[7:30] will use it for his glory amen amen in
[7:34] Daniel 11:32 I want to read here
[7:37] tonight and such as do
[7:40] wickedly against the Covenant shall be
[7:43] corrupt by
[7:45] flatteries but the people that
[7:48] do but the people that do know their God
[7:52] shall be strong and do exploits amen God
[7:57] bless you as you can be seated tonight
[7:59] I want to take that for a reading
[8:01] tonight I want to speak to you again off
[8:03] of this subject of the exploits of Faith
[8:07] um I am I'm working on something here
[8:09] that I see in the scripture and uh
[8:12] sometimes it takes me a little bit to
[8:13] get there uh but uh we we probably could
[8:17] take about a three-hour service Brother
[8:19] Louie and just pile it all in or we can
[8:21] take a few at a time and and and get to
[8:23] it amen in a series and amen so we're
[8:26] we're just looking into a little bit of
[8:28] this and uh if we look into the
[8:30] scripture here in Daniel
[8:32] 11:32 amen uh I want to look over here
[8:35] in the Feast of the trumpets uh a
[8:38] scripture brother brandham will use that
[8:40] scripture in a way that just really
[8:43] stands out to me personally let me read
[8:46] this paragraph 113 and brother Bram says
[8:48] and how will the Messiah the people
[8:52] that's believing him know it unless
[8:54] they're constantly in the word amen to
[8:58] know what he is amen Daniel said the
[9:02] wise shall know but the foolish and the
[9:05] unwise wouldn't know now he's tying
[9:07] together Daniel 12 and Daniel 11 he's
[9:10] tying those scriptures together he said
[9:13] they shall know their God and he
[9:15] speaking a direction like a prophecy
[9:18] they shall know their God now how he
[9:20] shall appear in the last days he says is
[9:24] to bring the people back to the word so
[9:28] that the bride will know her husband or
[9:31] know her mate the revealed word that's
[9:35] why this has to happen so the bride
[9:38] would know her mate the revealed word so
[9:41] then the message of the hour is not just
[9:44] uh something to read and set aside but
[9:46] rather it is the mate to the church it's
[9:49] it's what we've been married to that's
[9:52] what our womb is open to but if you can
[9:54] uh read Daniel 11 let's read it and
[9:56] listen to that latter part but the
[9:58] people that do know their God shall be
[10:01] strong and do exploits and and listen to
[10:03] how brother brandham says it and the
[10:05] bride will know her mate the revealed
[10:08] word when Daniel wrote it he said the
[10:11] people shall know their God when brother
[10:13] brandham used the same scripture he
[10:15] speaks it and says the bride will know
[10:18] her mate so the people becomes the bride
[10:21] and God Becomes Her mate you see the
[10:23] difference in the personalization if you
[10:25] go back there in the Bible in the book
[10:27] of Hosea and it says for the people who
[10:30] were not a people should be called the
[10:31] people of God Amen that that's a very
[10:34] direct scripture and Hosea doesn't say
[10:36] just a people he said but they shall be
[10:38] called the children of God and brother
[10:40] bam tells us then that you know if he's
[10:42] speaking of Israel he's speaking of
[10:43] servants but when he speaks of Gentile
[10:46] he speaks of sons so then Hosea is
[10:49] speaking of people in general of course
[10:51] he's talking about Abraham's seed but
[10:53] then when Paul picks up the same
[10:55] scripture in the Book of Romans in the
[10:56] ninth chapter Paul begins to quote Hosea
[11:00] and then he comes back and says them
[11:01] people not Jew only but also Gentile and
[11:05] then over in the book of Peter when
[11:07] Peter preaches about the Royal
[11:08] priesthoods you know uh I think it's
[11:10] John in Revelations 1 he'll say you're
[11:12] Kings and Priests but when Peter spoke
[11:15] of you he just shortened it and called
[11:17] it royal priesthood so it's a king
[11:19] priest and then he says a chosen
[11:22] generation remember but the very next
[11:24] verse Peter will say a people who were
[11:27] not a people but are now the children of
[11:29] of God so Peter and Paul connect the
[11:32] book of Hosea to the Gentile
[11:35] church right but then we find out that
[11:38] brother brandham takes it a step further
[11:40] and then he goes in beyond the curtain
[11:42] of time and sees these people coming to
[11:44] and he says something said the prophets
[11:47] are gathered with their people he said
[11:48] are these all Broms he said no these are
[11:50] your converts so these people now those
[11:53] people then become the Bride of Jesus
[11:56] Christ so the people in Daniel that was
[11:58] just called called a people amen but in
[12:01] the latter days they will be called the
[12:03] followers of a message they will be the
[12:05] Bride of Jesus Christ in Revelations 18
[12:08] John connects it when he said them
[12:10] people heard a voice and it said come
[12:13] out of her my people so you see that the
[12:16] people he's describing is the bride and
[12:19] that's why brother bandam just cuts it
[12:21] and said the bride will know her mate so
[12:23] the people becomes more clear as a
[12:26] people as an identification of a church
[12:28] so if God's identifying that side then
[12:31] he makes a Clarity of the people that
[12:33] shall know their God so if it's just God
[12:36] somewhere uh somehow then it's a bit
[12:38] unknown yet but when it becomes the
[12:41] revealed word then the prophet is
[12:43] narrowing it down to identify to the
[12:46] church that you are the people and this
[12:48] revealed word is God so it's showing our
[12:51] connection because we being the bride
[12:54] and him being the bridegroom he said
[12:57] he's the word and we're the hear of the
[12:59] word so there's an actual Union that's
[13:02] going on between us and this word in the
[13:05] last days so what you're seeing then is
[13:07] this here's a prophet then he's actually
[13:09] depicting a certain area of scripture
[13:11] and this is something that uh that that
[13:13] I got into in this little thought uh you
[13:16] remember one of the first times I spoke
[13:17] on this specific scripture we got into
[13:20] that they become strong and and uh you
[13:23] forgive me but I just got to explain how
[13:24] I got where I'm going uh uh but but they
[13:27] become strong and and when you think
[13:29] think about they become strong remember
[13:30] I picked a man out of scripture and said
[13:33] David said the they that have the
[13:35] strength are blessed and they move from
[13:37] strength to strength the Victorious
[13:38] power and then we took the example of
[13:41] that as being a man named Caleb and how
[13:44] Caleb was a man in the scripture amen
[13:47] that was 85 years old but was demanding
[13:50] that he receive a mountain in the land
[13:53] of Hebron remember that amen now if you
[13:56] if you study Caleb a little bit deeper
[13:58] which I want to talk about Caleb for
[13:59] just a few minutes tonight but Caleb if
[14:02] you studied a little bit deeper said he
[14:03] was a kenite he said but but if you if
[14:06] you look beh in the back parts of
[14:09] Caleb's story is Caleb actually wasn't a
[14:12] Jew by birth he was in a Jew by adoption
[14:15] he had been brought into to the tribe of
[14:17] Judah and received his promise of a land
[14:21] of inheritance but he only received it
[14:23] by promise from Moses so everybody else
[14:26] in the tribe of Judah would have been
[14:27] receiving because they had been born in
[14:29] the tribe of Judah but Caleb on the
[14:32] other hand was receiving benefits not
[14:35] because of him being born an Israelite
[14:38] but his benefits was because that he had
[14:41] received an Israelite by faith so his
[14:44] his his his position or his portion in
[14:48] the land was only there by promise it
[14:52] was because that he had a different kind
[14:54] of spirit now now when you see things
[14:56] written in the scripture I I'm I'm that
[14:59] I'm the person that I got to stop and
[15:00] think a minute about it because if if
[15:02] you see something so dramatic in
[15:05] scripture of how that a man a gentile
[15:08] like Caleb could get included into the
[15:10] promises of God into that Promised Land
[15:13] then there's got to be something he is
[15:15] typing or God wouldn't do something so
[15:18] drastic in scripture to make it stick
[15:20] out because it looks like it's a
[15:22] controversy but it's not a controversy
[15:25] it's actually a revelation laying there
[15:28] that under that Revelation it details
[15:31] the idea that God for ordained a
[15:34] generation in the last days who would be
[15:37] a gentile people and those Gentiles
[15:39] would come into the land of promise and
[15:41] they wouldn't come because they were
[15:43] born Jews but they would become under
[15:45] Abraham's seed because of their new
[15:48] birth and that new birth only comes by
[15:50] faith is that right then we are the
[15:52] faith Seed of Abraham now I found it
[15:55] interesting that Moses when he got ready
[15:58] to make a promise to the children of
[15:59] Israel that he picked out the land of
[16:02] Judah and he detailed Judah as being
[16:04] belonging to the land of Hebron he and
[16:07] and and you remember that's exactly
[16:09] where when they went out to spy the land
[16:12] they they picked up 12 tribes they came
[16:14] to Kadesh barnia and they had heard
[16:16] about this land and they're going to go
[16:17] over so God sends 12 Spies and he picks
[16:20] out every Spy but there was a spy that
[16:22] was connected to tribes and one of the
[16:25] tribes the tribe of Judah specifically
[16:28] Caleb was representing that tribe and he
[16:30] was the he was the man who was
[16:33] representing the entire tribe of Judah
[16:34] Now isn't it odd that a gentile would be
[16:37] the representation of that tribe and
[16:40] would actually get to spy out the land
[16:43] and it would be the land of Hebron amen
[16:45] I I think it's pretty powerful amen that
[16:47] God was putting that much responsibility
[16:50] on a man and making him stick out amen
[16:53] and have all the 12 Spies amen he comes
[16:57] back from the tribe of Judah and he he
[16:59] he then has told about Hebron now there
[17:01] was a couple things that was told is
[17:03] that there would be a good land over
[17:05] there and it would be a land with milk
[17:07] and honey and then they were also to
[17:09] look into the they were also to look in
[17:11] the inhabitants of the land and they
[17:13] were to see the dwellings whether it be
[17:14] tents or strongholds or what they were
[17:16] to do so these 12 Spies were to spy out
[17:18] the land and come back with a report
[17:21] concerning milk and honey good land and
[17:24] whether it was the right kind of
[17:25] dwelling strongholds or tents and what
[17:27] was the people of the land were they
[17:29] easy to take you know so they had these
[17:31] things when they went and look but the
[17:32] scripture says when they returned amen
[17:35] they didn't only bring back reports of
[17:37] milk and honey remember they they
[17:39] brought back the the cluster of grapes
[17:41] that was so big they had to put it on a
[17:43] staff to carry it back when they got
[17:46] back in the land and the scripture tells
[17:48] us that they begin to give the report
[17:50] and all the spies said it's a good
[17:53] land and all the spies said that it was
[17:56] a land flowing with milk and honey so
[17:58] those those two portions were exactly
[18:01] like God said but then the other spies
[18:04] the Bible said gave an evil report now I
[18:07] don't know about you all but whenever
[18:08] the Bible calls something evil I want to
[18:10] ask myself what did God call an evil
[18:13] report have you ever read what the
[18:15] report was amen they just simply said
[18:18] that we are not able to take the land
[18:20] because it is inhabited by Giants and we
[18:23] are grasshoppers in their sights you
[18:24] know to think that that was what was
[18:27] considered evil before God
[18:29] amen that people would regard the size
[18:32] of the Giants rather am amen rather than
[18:36] the promise of God in other words God
[18:38] thought it evil that they would compare
[18:41] themselves to the Giants rather than
[18:43] comparing their God to Giants amen I
[18:46] think it's amazing because the Bible
[18:48] said amen that they they they went forth
[18:50] with all these reports and people began
[18:52] to get angry and then Joshua and Caleb
[18:55] they be they begin this report and I I I
[18:57] think it's powerful because Amen brother
[19:00] Bram said Caleb stealing the people amen
[19:02] you know what it meant was they were
[19:04] going every which way with every idea
[19:07] concerning the land but Caleb was to
[19:09] steal the people and when he stealed the
[19:11] people he began to say to them that
[19:14] these Giants are bread to us amen I got
[19:17] to thinking about it amen they had they
[19:18] had milk and they had honey they had
[19:21] grapes and now they got bread amen these
[19:23] were not Giants unto Caleb this was
[19:26] bread for his eating he had a he had a
[19:28] he had a he had a battle thirst he he
[19:31] had a hunger for battle and to him this
[19:34] was the bread for a thirst to take a
[19:36] land he this man was not an ordinary man
[19:40] he was hungry amen the Bible calls his
[19:42] name Caleb I don't know if you ever
[19:44] looked it up but in the Hebrew his his
[19:46] name actually meant dog how many knows
[19:49] that amen I'm telling you the truth it
[19:52] means dog his name means dog now if you
[19:54] go into the New Testament when Jesus
[19:56] spoke unto the Gentile the sanan woman
[19:59] remember what he said to her when she
[20:01] was looking after healing and he said
[20:03] unto her that you cannot receive healing
[20:05] because you're a gentile he said this is
[20:08] meat for the children's table and she
[20:10] said but Lord even the dogs get the
[20:13] crumbs that fall from the master's table
[20:15] even the dogs amen amen and she was a
[20:18] gentile and here she had a forefather in
[20:21] the tribe of Judah amen that had a a
[20:24] thirst if you look up the name just in
[20:26] the Hebrew look up the name Caleb and it
[20:28] says a dog one place it calls it a
[20:31] ravaging dog or an aggressive dog and I
[20:33] thought now that explains the nature of
[20:36] Caleb amen he was looking at the Giants
[20:38] that were causing people to back up from
[20:41] grapes and to back up from milk and
[20:43] honey to back up to they was at KES
[20:46] Baria they just come out of Egypt they
[20:48] had had lived in a Wilderness land and
[20:50] they were looking at possessions they
[20:52] were looking at homesteading they were
[20:55] looking at building houses and having a
[20:57] place for their children but but they
[20:58] were more scared of the Giants than they
[21:00] were remaining in that in that place
[21:03] that they were but oh Caleb amen he he
[21:05] had a thirst and a hunger for the battle
[21:08] and he said no what these Giants are is
[21:10] they are bread for our eating amen
[21:13] that's only bread for us amen I want you
[21:15] to know tonight amen that the Giants
[21:18] that exist in the lands of Promise amen
[21:20] those Giants are only bread for the
[21:23] children of God that is ready to go into
[21:25] the promise now I don't I don't have a
[21:27] lot of time to preach about the tonight
[21:29] but I do want you to know you're never
[21:31] going to go into a Promised Land without
[21:33] a giant laying in that
[21:35] land amen if you're going to go into any
[21:38] land there's somebody been there before
[21:40] you that was not ordained to live in
[21:42] that land and they have now become a GI
[21:44] of that land can I can I can I tell it
[21:46] to you straight there is people who has
[21:49] claimed amen the power of the spoken
[21:51] word and they have used it in the wrong
[21:54] way and now when a man preaches on the
[21:56] promise of the spoken word the Church of
[21:59] the Living God somebody knows somebody
[22:01] amen that used it the wrong way now that
[22:04] is a giant unto the promise and people
[22:06] say we are not able to do that brother
[22:08] Wayne I know so and so said this and
[22:10] didn't happen this over here happened
[22:12] and that didn't take place and it become
[22:14] a giant unto you amen but there is still
[22:18] remaining Amen in the Church of the
[22:20] Living God our type as Caleb who said we
[22:23] are more than able to take this land and
[22:26] I'm not going to look at your Giants I'm
[22:28] I'm not going to hear the reasoning of
[22:31] the people of why the promise is no good
[22:33] amen but I believe this is a generation
[22:36] it ought to say that we are more than
[22:38] able to take the land that God has made
[22:41] concerning the Church of the Living God
[22:43] I I I'm one that believes amen these
[22:46] Giants are only bread for the church
[22:48] amen amen I tell you sometimes you get a
[22:51] little hungry for the battle amen if you
[22:53] if you don't believe it go ahead and
[22:55] come on Amen let's just take the word
[22:57] and draw the battle mindes amen because
[23:00] somebody is going to believe this
[23:01] message in this last day there's
[23:03] somebody ordained to stand on the ground
[23:07] of the spoken word I don't know about
[23:09] y'all but it might as well be me amen
[23:11] somebody is going to speak the word of
[23:14] God and it's going to create right in
[23:16] front of him somebody's going to be
[23:19] preaching when the arms are added back
[23:21] to the body or eyes come back in their
[23:24] head amen but anybody that ever sees
[23:26] that is only going to see it because
[23:28] they're preaching it as the truth you'll
[23:31] never receive something that you can't
[23:33] preach or you cannot
[23:35] believe if you can't believe it you'll
[23:37] never get it people say well I I I tell
[23:40] you they talk about that Holy Ghost but
[23:42] I never got it there's another giant
[23:43] isn't it but I never got it amen amen
[23:46] you know what amen you got to believe it
[23:48] before you can get it you got to believe
[23:51] in it before you can get it because the
[23:53] Holy Ghost is for
[23:55] believers that's who it's for but oh I
[23:58] know there's Giants out in that land
[23:59] people shouting and hollering and
[24:01] screaming and running he say well I
[24:03] don't want to be like fat well I'll tell
[24:04] you what amen amen I don't care what I'm
[24:06] like as long as I get that Holy
[24:09] Ghost that's the truth I don't care I
[24:11] don't care what it is long as I get that
[24:13] Holy Ghost you said brother Wayne you
[24:14] mean you do anything do you know I'm
[24:16] already spoken of in scripture how many
[24:18] knows that Amen in the Book of Romans
[24:21] Paul says amen that before they were
[24:24] ever born he said Jacob have I loved and
[24:27] Esau have I hated brother bam said that
[24:29] represented showing you amen that before
[24:33] the end time groups come on the scene
[24:35] that God is already said I'll love one
[24:37] and hate the other who's he going to
[24:39] love the Jacob and what was Jacob he was
[24:42] a man desperate to do anything for the
[24:45] Holy Ghost because he knew the blessing
[24:48] of God laid in the Holy Ghost and the
[24:51] Church of the Living God every blessing
[24:53] that we're going to receive as an
[24:55] inheritance will be because of that Holy
[24:57] Ghost now y'all know what I'm talking
[24:59] about amen we could call it a giant or
[25:01] we could just switch switch gears and
[25:03] call it a scarecrow either way same
[25:06] thing amen it's just a scarecrow that's
[25:09] all it is old big scarecrows you never
[25:11] seen it amen it's same thing with
[25:13] doctrines you know amen there there's
[25:15] there's old scarecrows built around them
[25:17] any kind of Doctrine you want to touch
[25:19] with a message somebody's taught it
[25:20] wrong somebody's went out in eror with
[25:22] it and then when you mention it amen
[25:24] that's a giant that's in the land well I
[25:26] tell you what amen I don't know about
[25:28] y'all but we're able to possess
[25:30] everything this Prophet said we are more
[25:33] than able to receive it and possess it
[25:35] and we will not let a false teacher
[25:38] stand in the way of us possessing the
[25:40] truth concerning the word of God in our
[25:43] age amen I don't know about y'all but
[25:44] I'm not willing to let no scarecrow keep
[25:46] me out of the greatest parts of the
[25:49] message of the hour amen it's our
[25:51] portion amen amen it's our
[25:55] portion my you you see what was
[25:57] happening is Caleb Caleb according to
[26:00] scripture now the Bible said when Moses
[26:02] returned when they saw the children
[26:04] return and and and and Caleb's Spirit
[26:07] was the kind of spirit he had
[26:09] representing the spirit that will be on
[26:11] the Gentile bride look at the spirit
[26:13] that he had holy followed Moses and then
[26:15] the scripture says Moses told him you
[26:18] can have the land wherein your feet have
[26:21] trod brother amen do y'all know that's
[26:24] how how that Caleb received his promise
[26:27] it was the land he had trotten out and
[26:30] he had said we're able to take it he
[26:32] walked in Hebrew Hebron with a with a
[26:35] mountain was with anoch and his sons
[26:37] lived which were the Giants that was the
[26:39] land he walked out and he was given that
[26:42] land for promise oh my it had the
[26:45] biggest giants but it had the best
[26:46] property
[26:48] too it was in Hebron why do you think
[26:51] them Giants were living
[26:53] there come on the strongest took the
[26:55] best
[26:56] land the strongest in in the Giants the
[26:59] Giants took the best of the property
[27:01] what do you think Giants are moving in
[27:03] today they're not moving in on things
[27:05] that's 5,000 years ago or amen upon
[27:08] another church age they're moved in upon
[27:10] the things for the bride of Christ amen
[27:13] and they're living there because that's
[27:14] where the good things are amen but the
[27:17] Church of the Living God is a galeb and
[27:20] we're stronger than the Giants because
[27:22] we're not looking at the Giants we're
[27:25] looking at the promises of God
[27:28] my when I think about this I think about
[27:30] Caleb who was given the land where he
[27:32] ENT trod the Bible tells us amen that
[27:35] that Caleb had that spirit that he
[27:37] followed and that he was able to possess
[27:39] it now I thought this was amazing that
[27:41] he took the the land of Hebron Hebron
[27:44] was a city do you know it was actually
[27:45] given to the Levites as a City of
[27:48] Refuge amen that actually was his
[27:51] possession was the land of Hebron so he
[27:53] didn't get the actual City but he got
[27:55] everything around the city he was
[27:58] connected to the city of Hebron which
[28:00] was a City of Refuge i i i there's
[28:03] enough types in there to stay all night
[28:04] but but y'all know that there is one who
[28:06] is our refuge amen and that's exactly
[28:10] where our inheritance lays is in the
[28:12] city amen not the the city of Hebron but
[28:16] in the seventh City of Refuge Christ Our
[28:19] Lord do you know it was there through
[28:22] Hebron that Judah amen accepted Caleb
[28:25] and he became a part of the very
[28:27] promises and the land land his children
[28:29] inhabited that land amen I I I had to I
[28:32] had to just stop and scratch my head a
[28:34] minute and I I thought about Caleb being
[28:36] a gentile just just just struck my mind
[28:38] a moment and I thought dear Lord amen
[28:41] what kind of tribe would allow a gentile
[28:43] to come in how would that
[28:45] happen but it's amazing because the
[28:48] tribe of Judah is the tribe of the Kings
[28:52] amen which would which the ruler would
[28:54] come out of which was Christ is that
[28:56] right but do you know the tribe of Judah
[28:59] had already received Caleb amen but in
[29:03] that same in that same era of time when
[29:06] Joshua and Caleb crossed the river and
[29:08] they took the land of Jericho do you
[29:10] know that Rahab was added to the
[29:13] inheritance in that land but she was
[29:15] added by marriage to Sone and she was
[29:19] added to the tribe of
[29:22] Judah Caleb a gentile come into Israel
[29:26] through Judah
[29:28] Rahab came through Judah isn't that
[29:31] amazing amen that Rahab a gentile but
[29:34] married into the tribe amen and because
[29:38] of her marriage into that word she was
[29:41] the inheritor and the great grandmother
[29:44] of Jesus Christ and a possessor amen of
[29:47] the promises of God and it was happening
[29:49] through the line of Judah it's amazing
[29:51] to me because that's the same line amen
[29:54] now I'm thinking of inheritance here
[29:56] Caleb got his inheritance through Judah
[29:59] is that right Ruth amen got her
[30:01] inheritance where did she get her
[30:03] inheritance it was through Boaz amen
[30:06] which was also of the tribe of Judah it
[30:09] was Judah the tribe that brought
[30:12] Gentiles into the inheritance that was
[30:15] in the land of promise can you imagine
[30:17] tonight that we have the great King
[30:19] Jesus Christ who was the royal Seed of
[30:22] Abraham that brought every Gentile amen
[30:25] that's a part of God today that's how we
[30:28] receive our inheritance is
[30:32] through it is through Christ you can't
[30:36] receive a promise in this age without it
[30:38] being Christ you've got to come into
[30:41] Christ for every promise for everything
[30:43] you need you've got to come into Christ
[30:46] do you see it's through Christ that's
[30:48] where Caleb got it amen that's where
[30:50] Ruth got it that's where Rahab got it
[30:52] Ruth amen actually Boaz was a redeemer
[30:56] to the inheritance of Naomi now friends
[30:59] there is no end to the to the deepness
[31:02] of the types of what it means that the
[31:04] tribe of Judah was the one to receive a
[31:07] gentile and give them an inheritance in
[31:10] the land amen and to think that God has
[31:13] done the same thing for the Church of
[31:15] the Living God Amen look at the
[31:17] attribute that was laid on Caleb who
[31:20] looked at God's promise rather than
[31:23] looking at the giant that same attribute
[31:26] amen has come upon the Church of the
[31:28] Living God who looks at the promises of
[31:31] God rather than looking at the Giants
[31:33] and the a don't don't don't think bad
[31:36] amen of a believer in this age who
[31:39] refuses to see things that are contrary
[31:41] to the word it is their nature to look
[31:44] into the Unseen realm and believe that
[31:47] God is more than
[31:50] able Amen brother Bram said see there
[31:52] was many men looking at the circumstance
[31:55] but Caleb and Joshua was looking at the
[31:57] word of God God that made the
[32:01] difference woo brother that made the
[32:06] difference if you want a difference in
[32:08] your life amen if you really want a
[32:11] difference quit looking at the
[32:12] circumstance and look at the promise of
[32:15] God Caleb didn't just look one time he
[32:19] spent
[32:20] 45 years looking I I tell you it's a
[32:24] powerful thing Church the man stay
[32:26] encouraged all all those
[32:30] years amen do you see that he stayed
[32:32] encouraged all those years I love how
[32:35] the scripture tells us that he did
[32:37] receive his reward in due
[32:40] time the Bible tells us he received his
[32:43] reward reward in due time Paul says in
[32:45] the book of Galatians he said let us not
[32:48] be weary and well-doing for in due
[32:51] season we shall
[32:54] reap if we faint
[32:56] not now look look at that look at that
[32:59] man Caleb not
[33:02] fainting do you know the Bible said when
[33:04] he gave his report that the children of
[33:07] Israel tried to Stone
[33:10] him he was not a popular preacher at
[33:13] that
[33:16] moment it's the truth you would think
[33:19] that a man saying we're able to do this
[33:22] we we can take the land we are more than
[33:25] able to do you think they would have
[33:27] lifted him to a higher point but by
[33:29] preaching the word amen in the face of
[33:32] the circumstance they turned and stoned
[33:35] the man but look at him he didn't leave
[33:37] the
[33:39] field he didn't turn and walk away and
[33:42] say well I I tell you I can take the
[33:44] land but I can't convince the people he
[33:46] didn't he didn't do that he just stayed
[33:49] with the promise of God Amen he
[33:51] presented the promise of God not
[33:54] fainting therefore receiving the reward
[33:57] can I read you something I thought was a
[33:58] real interesting just something that uh
[34:01] uh just a writer wrote concerning this I
[34:03] thought it was very good myself it's not
[34:05] brother brandom so you don't have to
[34:06] receive it I just thought it was good uh
[34:09] it's not doctrinal if you do not uh give
[34:11] order or get exhausted or disheartened
[34:15] amen if you don't faint if you don't if
[34:19] if you don't get exhausted and
[34:21] disheartened now those are two powerful
[34:24] words but they're two words a Christian
[34:26] never wants to get acquainted
[34:29] with disheartened and
[34:32] exhausted it implies that unless a man
[34:35] preserves in doing good to the end of
[34:37] his life he can hope for no reward he
[34:40] who becomes disheartened and who gives
[34:43] over his efforts he that is appalled by
[34:47] obstacles and faints on the account of
[34:50] embarrassments thrown in the way Pines
[34:53] for eeve ease and withdraws from the
[34:56] field of benevolence
[34:58] shows that he has no true attachment to
[35:00] the
[35:02] cause isn't that
[35:04] something there's no true attachment to
[35:07] the cause if you become appalled at
[35:12] offenses if you easily become exhausted
[35:15] because of
[35:16] embarrassment and you see what you want
[35:18] to do is withdraw from the field of
[35:20] benevolence withdraw from the field of
[35:23] fighting amen you know how easy it is to
[35:26] resign and you just let things take over
[35:29] in your life you don't have to quit the
[35:31] church but to resign means that you're
[35:33] no longer in the fight you're no longer
[35:36] in the battle you're no longer pressing
[35:38] forward you're no longer you're no
[35:40] longer there Waring amen but but now if
[35:43] you're going to fight in this battle
[35:45] amen this is a spiritual battle you're
[35:47] going to face you're going to face some
[35:49] offenses you're going to face some
[35:51] disheartening times you're going to face
[35:54] some exhausting times but you're going
[35:56] to have to keep your eye on the
[35:58] recompense of the reward of not fainting
[36:01] amen amen listen if you're sold out for
[36:03] the cause amen listen I don't know maybe
[36:06] when we get there we'll be weary but
[36:08] we'll be weary with well doing amen we
[36:10] we'll have been fighting the battle such
[36:13] as the Bible promis that we should do it
[36:15] now I know exactly I've been in the
[36:17] battle long enough now to face some of
[36:19] the problems that you face as a warrior
[36:21] and some of the situations you get into
[36:23] when you when you're faced with offenses
[36:26] or you're faced with uh you're fac with
[36:27] disheartening times or I love how he
[36:30] says it here appalled by obstacles you
[36:32] ever get any obstacles in your life come
[36:35] going just preach to you a minute now
[36:37] you ever get obstacles obstacles and
[36:40] you're here on Thursday night so you're
[36:41] Overcomers but there's obstacles to
[36:43] being here on Thursday
[36:45] evening many people can't make it
[36:47] because of the obstacles now some of
[36:49] those obstacles are real some of them
[36:51] are not real real some of those
[36:53] obstacles is just a a
[36:58] that's profound isn't
[37:00] it that was
[37:03] inspiration some of those some of those
[37:05] obstacles are not real some of those
[37:08] obstacles are there and they become
[37:12] beneficial to your
[37:14] resignation of not wanting to be in
[37:16] service because of a situation because
[37:18] of a family maybe a little problem or a
[37:21] little struggle going on between you and
[37:23] a family member or you and part of the
[37:25] church or maybe you didn't like the way
[37:27] some said something or did something so
[37:28] you get a little offended or a little
[37:30] appalled then it becomes an obstacle to
[37:33] come to the house of God but sometimes
[37:36] people get over the Obstacle of coming
[37:38] but they can't get over the obstacle to
[37:40] go ahead and get into the service so
[37:43] maybe they're upset can I preach a
[37:45] little bit maybe they're upset the
[37:47] pastor a little bit so they they got a
[37:49] little obstacle there and they think
[37:50] well I'll go but I'll sure set on him
[37:52] till he shuts up I and you know he gets
[37:55] over in that little area corrects your
[37:57] corrects your life somehow amen and and
[37:59] it becomes a place where you're you're
[38:02] appalled and and I love how this little
[38:05] writer said something that just very
[38:06] struck a tune
[38:08] embarrassed some people some people have
[38:11] done things that are so odd to the
[38:14] scripture or to the way of it that they
[38:15] actually get embarrassed and they feel
[38:18] like withdrawing amen now I remember
[38:20] when I first got saved I I I went to
[38:22] church a little bit and then I got out
[38:23] of church and I went out and done some
[38:24] things that was wrong and I was so
[38:26] embarrassed that it l Lally become a
[38:28] mountain for me to come back to church I
[38:30] mean it was a mountain amen because amen
[38:32] here I was confessing to be a Christian
[38:34] and I had these things in my heart and
[38:37] i' done these things and the whole
[38:38] church knew about it and I was I was
[38:40] just I was just getting in I was trying
[38:41] my best well listen it was a mountain to
[38:43] me but to the church they knew I was a
[38:45] baby so I talk to somebody they said
[38:48] well brother Wayne you got to learn to
[38:49] walk before you can run amen you you I
[38:52] mean you know you got to learn you got
[38:53] to learn how don't be embarrassed if a
[38:55] baby if we're teaching a baby to crawl
[38:57] or a baby to walk and it falls in the
[38:59] floor I'm not embarrassed that baby fell
[39:01] I just pick the baby up and we'll teach
[39:03] you to walk amen and and if you're still
[39:05] in those stages where you're trying
[39:08] don't get embarrassed by the Fall listen
[39:10] to me this Bible is written about
[39:12] soldiers and heroes and warriors amen
[39:15] that they're in the Bible because they
[39:18] got up from a place of failure come on
[39:21] Church you got to see your position in
[39:23] the word of God God ain't rewriting the
[39:26] Bible every time you come to an obstacle
[39:28] in your life or an embarrassment comes
[39:31] along God don't rewrite the book and try
[39:34] to do things but he'll send a preacher
[39:36] along and he'll try to say to you don't
[39:39] you faint don't you get weary in this
[39:41] Walk of Life amen don't you get
[39:43] embarrassed and stay home you repent and
[39:46] bring your life before
[39:49] God well I don't know of a specific case
[39:51] but I do feel like I'm preaching right
[39:53] now I feel like I'm speaking to a need I
[39:56] from my heart I believe that people get
[39:58] embarrassed they get situations have you
[40:00] ever felt like you're just a
[40:04] failure now I don't want to I don't want
[40:06] to get up here and have a pity party so
[40:08] I'm not going to do that but I I could
[40:09] open you up a little bit to to what
[40:11] Ministry goes through so I tell you what
[40:13] your pastor goes through can you imagine
[40:16] trying to please everybody all the
[40:20] time can you imagine having a job
[40:23] knowing that every decision you made you
[40:25] got friends that's going to be angry and
[40:27] and friends that's going to love you can
[40:29] you imagine where there is a position
[40:32] where you just can't do it for
[40:35] everybody now I'm going to preach to you
[40:37] a minute what that becomes is you
[40:40] constantly are everyone's
[40:43] disappointment how would you like to be
[40:45] the disappointment to half of your
[40:47] friends every time you meet them they're
[40:49] disappointed and you find out it's you
[40:50] they're disappointed at how would that
[40:53] feel so it becomes a place of
[40:55] embarrassment where you feel like I I'm
[40:58] not enough I can't do enough I can't say
[41:00] enough so so if you if you get on that
[41:02] side and you start running that and
[41:04] looking at that and you labor in that
[41:07] and you start feeding on that then you
[41:09] get on come on preachers I'm preaching
[41:10] to you you get to feeling like I'm a
[41:12] nobody I ain't helping nobody I ain't
[41:14] doing nothing for the Lord I ain't never
[41:16] going to make it you ain't the first
[41:18] person to ever walk that trail here's a
[41:20] Caleb setting here that's been pastoring
[41:22] the church for years and years and years
[41:25] amen but just as much Vigor as he ever
[41:27] had because it's in your spirit what
[41:30] kind of spirit are you have you don't
[41:32] come on now you got to be sold out to
[41:34] the cause that means we're not
[41:37] quitters that means we're not quitters
[41:39] here tonight we're not just going to
[41:41] fold up our hands and say it's too hard
[41:44] we we can't take the land we can't do
[41:46] these things but we are the Church of
[41:48] the Living God and the devil is bread
[41:51] for the Church of the Living God come on
[41:54] friends we are more than Overcomers here
[41:56] tonight
[41:58] tonight said preacher what are you
[41:59] talking about I'm talking about if you
[42:01] want faint not amen there's something
[42:03] for you to reap if you wanton faint
[42:05] there's a place of reaping there's a
[42:07] there's a season in your life where
[42:09] you'll turn around and see the benefits
[42:11] come on mother you'll see the benefits
[42:14] them babies start getting baptized and
[42:16] you'll thank God you quw in the church
[42:18] every Sunday morning and you got them
[42:20] together and got in the car and you
[42:21] drove down amen there's a reward that
[42:24] comes upon you amen if you do the right
[42:27] right
[42:30] thing well may not been what you come to
[42:32] hear but I think it's what I got to
[42:35] say said preacher what are you talking
[42:38] about I'm talking about that Caleb
[42:40] spirit that wouldn't become embarrassed
[42:43] or appalled or offended but he was sold
[42:47] to a cause he was literally sold to a
[42:51] cause Amen in being that watch what amen
[42:55] if you won't become disheartened watch
[42:56] what were doing they were looking at the
[42:59] promise they wasn't looking at the
[43:01] situation how many people would be
[43:03] enough before you would say maybe I
[43:05] shouldn't do this look at Caleb and
[43:08] Joshua the entire tribe the the entire
[43:12] Bunch said amen we're going to Stone you
[43:15] for preaching that message like that but
[43:17] look at what they were they were not
[43:19] quitters they believed it was the word
[43:21] of God and they were going to press on
[43:23] because they wasn't looking at the
[43:25] problem they were looking at the word
[43:28] and church we can learn something from
[43:30] these men that were looking at the word
[43:33] we can look at these things and see
[43:35] these men and how they survived amen I
[43:37] know sometimes you get in situation
[43:39] Brother s maybe you don't feel like
[43:41] shouting maybe you don't feel like
[43:42] rejoicing you know most of the time when
[43:44] we don't it's our own
[43:46] problem we can put it on the preacher we
[43:48] can put it on the song leader but
[43:50] honestly most of the time it's something
[43:52] we're going through personally and the
[43:54] devil's woring our mind with a little
[43:56] something we thought or something we did
[43:57] in that little situation embarrassed
[44:00] embarrassed within your own mind about
[44:03] some situation come on Church come on
[44:05] but I'll tell you how to overcome it
[44:07] tonight David said bless the Lord did he
[44:11] not say it he said bless the Lord and
[44:14] forget not all of his benefits he who
[44:16] forgiveth all thine iniquities and look
[44:20] what David could do David could bless
[44:23] the Lord embarrassed you bet he was
[44:25] troubled you bet he was was but David
[44:28] wasn't a quitter he was going to worship
[44:30] God no matter the circumstance or the
[44:33] situation and I believe the Church of
[44:36] the Living God can perform the same
[44:38] worship that David
[44:42] did Joshua and Caleb's a great great
[44:44] lesson now I I think it's amazing
[44:47] because if you go to the scripture amen
[44:50] we we we we're finding that Caleb got an
[44:52] inheritance and I I want to just mention
[44:55] this for a couple moments here amen his
[44:57] inheritance now look at what brother bam
[44:59] does in Daniel 11 he said the people
[45:01] that know their God a bride shall know
[45:03] her mate the revealed word so what
[45:06] brother brandom is doing is he's
[45:08] allotting he's allotting a scripture to
[45:11] a church he's he's taking an allotment
[45:15] out of the of the Bible and he's
[45:17] identifying it with an individual group
[45:20] or with a people who's coming under his
[45:22] word he's showing you this is your
[45:26] portion in the you bunch of Gentiles
[45:30] through Christ This is a portion of the
[45:32] word that was written with you in
[45:36] mind my
[45:39] goodness amen now think of this because
[45:42] uh can can I can I take this to Apostle
[45:44] Paul uh who was the he was the Apostle
[45:49] of the
[45:49] Gentiles who brought the law into Grace
[45:53] and brought the Gentiles in through
[45:56] preaching
[45:58] promise I tell you I think it's powerful
[46:00] man he understood he understood the
[46:03] power of preaching the promise look at
[46:06] Ephesians chapter 1 and watch what he
[46:08] says here in the 11th verse in whom also
[46:11] we have obtained an
[46:14] inheritance being predestinated
[46:16] according to the purpose of him who
[46:19] worketh all things after the
[46:23] counsel of his own
[46:25] will and inheritance can we take about
[46:28] that talk about that just a moment
[46:31] obtaining
[46:33] inheritance that word inheritance in
[46:35] this specific scripture the Greek word
[46:38] is different than every other Greek word
[46:41] inheritance in the Bible it's a odd
[46:44] thing because this specific Greek word
[46:47] concerning inheritance is written
[46:49] differently in that it's every other
[46:51] time you see it it's another word and it
[46:53] means possession or inheritance
[46:55] possession but in this one it means
[46:58] differently in that we have obtained an
[47:01] inheritance meaning like the casting of
[47:05] Lots now it's pretty amazing because now
[47:08] Paul is tying together the church the
[47:12] bride with coming into inheritance but
[47:14] he's typing it with the Greek word the
[47:17] casting of lots he said what how what
[47:21] does that have to do with us what's
[47:22] pretty powerful when you start reading
[47:25] the Old Testament scripture and you go
[47:27] back to the Book of Joshua when Joshua
[47:30] was coming into the land of promise in
[47:33] Joshua chapter 14 in the second verse
[47:36] the Bible said by lot was their
[47:38] inheritance and the Lord commanded by
[47:41] the hand of Moses nine tribes and for a
[47:44] half a tribe now it's a it's Joshua in
[47:47] the days of the inheritance he actually
[47:49] cast lots for the purpose of identifying
[47:52] a tribe with a land you'll also find in
[47:56] the Book of Numbers the 22nd chap 26th
[47:58] chapter 55th verse notwithstanding the
[48:00] land shall be divided by lot according
[48:03] to the names of the tribes of their
[48:04] fathers they shall inherit according to
[48:06] the lot shall The Possession thereof be
[48:08] divided between many and few for the lot
[48:12] now it sounds like that this is a game
[48:14] of chance a lot like you cast a lot it's
[48:16] a game of chance but according to
[48:18] Proverbs 16 the Bible said the lot is
[48:21] cast into the lap but the whole
[48:23] disposing therefore is of the Lord now
[48:27] if you go to the Book of Proverbs in the
[48:29] 18th chapter it said the lot causeth
[48:32] contention to cease and parteth between
[48:35] the mighty now look in the land when
[48:38] they were going to develop that land and
[48:39] and there were tribes are going to go in
[48:41] to possess the land can you imagine the
[48:44] contention between the tribes upon who
[48:46] what took part of the land who who was
[48:48] going to take this part and who's going
[48:50] to take this part that would have been a
[48:52] well I think our tribe's better and our
[48:54] tribes bigger and I think we need this
[48:55] position but you you got to see that God
[48:58] was the one that ordained where those
[49:00] tribes were going to be and he did it by
[49:03] the casting of Lots now think about this
[49:06] because these men Joshua and Caleb and
[49:09] the tribes of Israel of the new
[49:11] generation that was moving into the
[49:12] promised land they had their names on
[49:15] this land it was foreordained by the
[49:18] labor pains of their mothers in Genesis
[49:21] the 30th chapter hundreds of years
[49:24] before these men were ever born their
[49:27] tribes names as the sons of Jacob when
[49:31] they were being born their mothers cried
[49:33] out their names and birth pains can you
[49:36] imagine she would cry Ephraim she would
[49:39] cry Judah and under that labor pain that
[49:42] let's just use Judah can we amen she
[49:44] cried Judah and when she cried out the
[49:47] name Judah it represented a city and a
[49:51] place in near Hebron in the Bible in the
[49:54] land of Israel so God was identifying
[49:57] that which was coming forth with a place
[50:00] he had ordained and created before the
[50:03] foundation when God was creating the
[50:06] Earth he pulled Israel down he pulled up
[50:08] the mountain ranges he brought forth the
[50:11] city of heon in his mind and there amen
[50:14] he had a woman cry that named Judah over
[50:18] a child that was being born hundred
[50:20] hundreds of years before Judah would
[50:23] ever step foot into that land but Moses
[50:26] remember when they were going Moses said
[50:28] amen take Caleb oh God Amen when they
[50:32] were getting ready they took the heads
[50:33] of the Trib put their names upon the
[50:36] lots and they would cast the lots to see
[50:38] which tribe went to which land can you
[50:41] imagine this Caleb was given the lot of
[50:44] Judah his lot was in the amen I'm not
[50:48] making it clear his lot was in the lot
[50:50] of Judah in other words when Judah was
[50:53] chosen so was Caleb chosen he was he was
[50:57] connected to the land by promise amen he
[51:00] identified the land oh God that God had
[51:04] in his mind and Caleb to go into that
[51:07] place think about it God ordained it the
[51:10] mother spoke it Moses prophesied it and
[51:13] here Joshua is standing in before the
[51:16] land and the people are saying I wonder
[51:18] if Caleb really is supposed to be in
[51:19] this land I really wonder if he's
[51:21] supposed to be here amen and all of a
[51:23] sudden the lots are tasked and the lot
[51:25] rolls over there Caleb Judah belongs in
[51:28] the land of Hebron amen you talk about
[51:31] removing contention brother with the
[51:33] supernatural God tied together what the
[51:36] mother said with what Moses said with
[51:38] what Joshua said the scriptures lined
[51:41] one upon the other and now the
[51:44] supernatural was identified this is the
[51:47] place and this is the city and this is
[51:50] the people my Lord and Paul uses that as
[51:55] his example that we have obtained an
[51:58] inheritance in Christ in other words
[52:00] when God cast the lot we was Christ we
[52:04] was identified with Jesus
[52:08] Christ my you know brother R said when
[52:11] Jesus was chosen you were chosen in
[52:15] him before the foundations of the
[52:18] world I'm sorry I get a little excited I
[52:21] can't help
[52:22] it it's amazing to me that they would
[52:25] they would use this method I I never
[52:28] seen that inheritance laying there I
[52:30] never seen Paul tie that like that today
[52:32] I was reading and that that that
[52:34] scripture opens up showing you exactly
[52:38] what brother random said was true he
[52:40] said the book of Ephesians is the Book
[52:42] of Joshua of the New Testament and here
[52:46] Joshua was casting lots according to
[52:48] Moses and according to the mothers and
[52:50] the supernatural was identifying under
[52:53] inspiration these things all line up and
[52:56] now Paul is telling us that the Joshua
[53:00] Church would be found under the same
[53:02] order of God by the spirit now brother B
[53:05] says it like this he said Jesus paid for
[53:07] your inheritance he said but the Holy
[53:09] Ghost come to divide
[53:11] it remember that look at the Book of
[53:14] Joshua the first chapter he said now you
[53:16] be strong and of good courage for I have
[53:17] given to you to divide the
[53:20] land so whoever was to live where was
[53:24] according to the Holy Ghost when the
[53:26] spirit of the Lord placed someone in a
[53:30] place there should be no contention over
[53:33] the position that God gives you see that
[53:36] now the only time you get contention is
[53:38] when you argue with God when the holy
[53:41] spirit gives like like our pastor here
[53:43] God ordained him any anybody with good
[53:45] sense could know God ordained brother a
[53:47] here to be the pastor of this place amen
[53:50] I put my lot with his I I walked right
[53:52] with him I believe that so so that as
[53:55] long as you receive that and you walk
[53:57] with that there's no contention there
[53:59] but let somebody start going over into
[54:02] the inheritance or into the position and
[54:05] watch the
[54:07] contention so to keep contention you
[54:11] work in your own
[54:14] field C C can I have some
[54:18] help see if you stay in your
[54:21] place then the contention ain't there
[54:23] because the supernatural has already
[54:25] ordained
[54:26] the leadership and that leadership is
[54:29] our God ordained leadership and under
[54:31] that leadership we're going to take the
[54:33] Giants come on we're going to take the
[54:35] land under that leaders we'll work as a
[54:37] body and every devil is defeated and
[54:40] every devil is put under your
[54:42] foot because Amen brother Ram said they
[54:45] didn't go into the adoption because of
[54:47] the mumbling and complaining and the
[54:49] gripping and the fight come on Church
[54:51] they didn't go in because of unbelief
[54:54] but the bride Church has been appointed
[54:57] and adopted and seen in the
[55:02] land come on now the types are running
[55:05] deep we have obtained an inheritance
[55:08] that word obtained inheritance actually
[55:10] is one word it's not two it's one Greek
[55:12] word they use two Greek words to
[55:14] describe it obtained an inheritance it
[55:17] actually means a past tense thing in
[55:20] other words it's not something that's
[55:22] going to be appropriated it's not
[55:24] something that's got to be worked out at
[55:26] a later time but we have obtained an
[55:29] inheritance in other words it's already
[55:32] a position or situation they use the
[55:34] word passive in the I'm not a real
[55:37] English major or Greek but the word
[55:39] passive means in other words there's
[55:41] nothing you're going to do here we have
[55:43] obtained an inheritance in Christ other
[55:46] words there's nothing that we're going
[55:47] to do to obtain we have already obtained
[55:51] in Christ when God received Christ he
[55:55] received you and me
[55:56] and we have an inheritance in him amen
[56:00] according to God now I I I I can I can
[56:02] show you what brother Ram said about
[56:04] this he said the inheritance here he
[56:06] said is that you have a name in the
[56:08] Lamb's Book of
[56:11] Life that's what he said he said your
[56:14] name is in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[56:16] said your inheritance is eternal life as
[56:19] a
[56:20] son oh boy look at that position not
[56:24] even the angels
[56:27] are Sons but you have obtained an
[56:30] inheritance as
[56:32] Sons now C can I can I stop the type of
[56:36] Joshua and Caleb and come pick up
[56:37] another type for a
[56:38] second can can we take it just now don't
[56:41] tie the two types together let's pick up
[56:42] another type in Joshua chapter 18 do you
[56:47] know that several of the tribes had
[56:48] already been established but there were
[56:50] seven tribes that hadn't
[56:52] been if you go read it Joshua 18 speaks
[56:55] of seven tribes tribes that had not yet
[56:58] been positioned but they were coming
[57:00] into position do you know how they found
[57:03] their position the same
[57:05] way the Bible said that Joshua cast lots
[57:09] the same as he did before to show that
[57:13] God continually was placing even those
[57:16] seven after I don't know maybe we could
[57:19] run some topes here tonight I don't want
[57:20] to get into a bunch of crazy things but
[57:22] but Seven's a good number isn't it
[57:27] I mean you know Paul and then you got
[57:29] seven and then you got the church in the
[57:32] last days who come into the inheritance
[57:35] time the same as they did in the days of
[57:38] Joshua same land now the number 11 it
[57:41] stuck out to me personally I thought it
[57:43] was good amen because Jesus said the
[57:45] 11th Hour worker gets the pay of the
[57:48] same as the first hour worker is that
[57:51] right so those seven got the same thing
[57:53] the others got even if they come later
[57:56] they still got the same land that the
[57:58] others got because it was their
[58:00] inheritance it was what God had give
[58:03] them listen you might be a late Boomer
[58:05] maybe you've not come to that place yet
[58:07] but don't you let that devil keep you in
[58:10] a rocking chair amen fing and resigned
[58:13] and wey amen this is your land church
[58:16] this is your message this is your hour
[58:19] this is a generation and a Time amen
[58:22] that Devil's bread to
[58:25] you you sir brother Wayne how do you
[58:28] know if you read your Bible it said in
[58:30] the fourth generation that the iniquity
[58:32] of the Amorite would become fool right
[58:35] and watch Joshua knew scripturally that
[58:39] the iniquity of the Amorite was full at
[58:41] the same time that their progression for
[58:44] adoption was coming so God let two
[58:47] things happen at the same time he let
[58:49] the end of the Amorite world come at the
[58:52] same time that Joshua was there to
[58:55] collect what belong on to the Church of
[58:57] the Living God and here we are again
[59:00] when the whole world is falling apart
[59:02] every demon is running and the Church of
[59:05] the Living God has received the message
[59:07] of the
[59:08] supernatural that we are to be
[59:11] positioned into the word of God the same
[59:14] as when Paul was positioning so is the
[59:17] church to come into position of obtained
[59:20] an
[59:21] inheritance somebody's got to leave you
[59:24] something brother brother BR said so he
[59:26] left your name on the Lamb's Book of
[59:28] Life Now how do we get into this her
[59:30] inheritance how do we get into this
[59:32] inheritance we are
[59:38] predestinated inheritance I'm reading
[59:40] brother Bam by
[59:43] predestination inherited
[59:45] something inheritance by
[59:49] predestination oh then think about that
[59:53] you didn't earn it so you can't lose it
[59:56] that's
[59:58] right well that makes me feel pretty
[1:00:02] good so it's an Incorruptible
[1:00:07] inheritance it's not something that's
[1:00:09] going to be taken it's something that
[1:00:11] God has given it's something he's
[1:00:13] already done now watch in the adoption
[1:00:15] sermon brother Brandon will come
[1:00:17] adoption part three and he say God buys
[1:00:19] four and all seeing exactly who would be
[1:00:21] saved and who wouldn't be saved so sent
[1:00:24] Jesus to save those who had already been
[1:00:30] chosen didn't Paul say five verses
[1:00:33] behind this that he chose us in him
[1:00:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:38] that's our inheritance God chose us and
[1:00:41] let Jesus come and pay the price and the
[1:00:44] what he's shedding of his blood that no
[1:00:47] sin would be accounted to
[1:00:50] us
[1:00:52] nothing you do
[1:00:56] let that soak in a
[1:00:58] minute so brother when you can't preach
[1:01:01] like that well I did it
[1:01:04] already nothing you can
[1:01:06] do somebody says well but he that SNS
[1:01:09] willfully after coming to the knowledge
[1:01:11] of the truth there's no more sacrifice
[1:01:13] he said there's where you'll rise up
[1:01:15] again say how about that brother Bram so
[1:01:17] brother Bram was using the scripture of
[1:01:19] attained an inheritance and the blood
[1:01:21] had paid for it there's nothing you
[1:01:22] could do and then look what he says but
[1:01:24] somebody will raise up and say say now
[1:01:26] watch that giant the moment you preach
[1:01:29] eternal security here's the giant
[1:01:32] they'll raise up and say brother brandom
[1:01:35] somebody knew the Lord and they fell
[1:01:37] away somebody believed it and they fell
[1:01:40] away somebody got the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:41] they backslid see there there is no
[1:01:44] eternal security brother M is showing
[1:01:46] you that is a twisting of
[1:01:49] scripture now watch this the Lord spoke
[1:01:51] to me we have received the word of truth
[1:01:54] remember that I I I preached it not
[1:01:56] realizing that this text lined exactly
[1:02:00] with that thought because he says see
[1:02:02] what they did brother is they received
[1:02:05] he said they never received the truth
[1:02:08] they just received the knowledge of
[1:02:11] it oh my goodness they never received
[1:02:15] the truth they received a knowledge of
[1:02:17] Truth in other words they heard the
[1:02:19] message they never did receive it he
[1:02:22] says watch now it is impossible for
[1:02:25] those once in last and have taste of
[1:02:26] heavenly gift made partakers of the Holy
[1:02:28] Ghost Taste of the good word of God the
[1:02:30] power of the world to come if they fall
[1:02:31] away to renew themselves again to
[1:02:32] repentance sin They Crucified themselves
[1:02:35] the Son of God aresh put them to an open
[1:02:37] chain now he said I know what you
[1:02:39] legalist has got to have that in your
[1:02:41] mind right now but you're
[1:02:45] wrong he said I'll stand on this Bible
[1:02:48] if God ever saved a man he's saved for
[1:02:51] Time and
[1:02:53] Eternity and you can't make it it say
[1:02:56] anything
[1:03:01] else you can't make it say anything
[1:03:05] else you can't make the word lie church
[1:03:08] we have received the word of
[1:03:11] Truth you say well well I tell you
[1:03:14] brother I me you know I knew this guy he
[1:03:16] knew the Lord and he fell away what
[1:03:18] about him brother BR said what about
[1:03:20] Saul then what about Saul he was he was
[1:03:23] a king as anointed of God he back live
[1:03:26] before the Lord Elijah come to him and
[1:03:29] said you'll be with me tomorrow about
[1:03:31] this time but said see then Saul went
[1:03:34] took a premature grave went home early
[1:03:37] because of the life he lived but God
[1:03:39] took him
[1:03:40] home come on church sometimes God takes
[1:03:44] his children home but they're his
[1:03:47] children there's a lot of difference
[1:03:49] between disobedient children and
[1:03:51] children of Disobedience we are not the
[1:03:54] children of disobedience you might have
[1:03:56] been a disobedient child but you're not
[1:03:59] the child of Disobedience come on
[1:04:02] Church you got a three-year-old child
[1:04:04] and it won't sit down maybe it's rocking
[1:04:06] everything Mama gets a little upset she
[1:04:08] don't give the child away she says come
[1:04:10] on kid we're going
[1:04:13] home it's truth it's truth she don't
[1:04:16] give the child the way she come on child
[1:04:17] we're going to home the way you're
[1:04:19] acting I can't put up with it no more
[1:04:20] let's go home come on church God don't
[1:04:23] lose what he says God don't throw away
[1:04:26] what he's redeemed I am persuaded I am
[1:04:31] persuaded as Abraham was persuaded as
[1:04:34] Paul was persuaded you say you're
[1:04:36] persuaded yeah God swore by nothing
[1:04:38] greater than himself and made us hes of
[1:04:41] the promise of God in this last day he
[1:04:44] persuaded Abraham that he started it now
[1:04:47] he's finishing
[1:04:51] it now that runs deep I I know I don't
[1:04:53] have time for those topes you want me
[1:04:55] give you that one persuaded what
[1:04:58] persuaded Abraham when he met that one
[1:05:01] who was God In the Flesh his persuasion
[1:05:03] become equipped and in the last day that
[1:05:06] same one comes and swears that time
[1:05:08] shall be no more he was the beginning of
[1:05:10] Abraham's Faith he's the ending of
[1:05:12] Abraham's Faith he is the one that has
[1:05:15] persuaded us that the word of God is
[1:05:17] true in the last day do you see what it
[1:05:20] is we're talking about perfection God
[1:05:22] for ordained it now I I've got just a
[1:05:25] couple more I I'll I I'll close look
[1:05:27] what he said it's impossible now we we
[1:05:29] took this in a Bible study the other day
[1:05:31] it's reason reason I know this quotes
[1:05:32] here I thought it was powerful he said
[1:05:34] sometimes we believed that that was a
[1:05:37] man who was once enlightened and fell
[1:05:39] away again but the Bible doesn't read
[1:05:41] that
[1:05:42] way it's absolutely impossible he says
[1:05:45] here that has received the Holy Spirit
[1:05:48] to ever fall
[1:05:50] away oh my now you said brother Wayne I
[1:05:54] seen him do wrong brother brother ain't
[1:05:55] talking about that it's not what he's
[1:05:58] talking about he's not talking about
[1:05:59] what you're seeing he's talking about
[1:06:00] what God did in the Eternal questions
[1:06:02] and answers brother Ram said now that
[1:06:04] looks it looks that way from the way
[1:06:06] you're reading it
[1:06:08] there now look at what he's showing
[1:06:11] you rightly dividing the word of truth
[1:06:17] from the way you're reading it a man
[1:06:20] could receive the Holy Ghost and then
[1:06:22] backslide and be
[1:06:23] lost but it's impossible ible for him to
[1:06:26] do it he can't do it if he did Christ
[1:06:29] lied it's impossible for those once
[1:06:32] Enlighten now watch here what he's
[1:06:34] speaking to he's speaking to those
[1:06:36] borderline Jews he never said a man
[1:06:39] filled with the Holy Ghost he said he
[1:06:41] tasted of the word he was a partaker of
[1:06:44] the Holy Ghost brother R said by hearing
[1:06:46] the word he partook of it he didn't
[1:06:48] receive it now I'm I'm I'm saying that
[1:06:51] watch where we are Joshua and Caleb look
[1:06:54] where they were here's Paul now telling
[1:06:57] the Ephesian Church he's bringing them
[1:06:59] into obtaining an inheritance and a take
[1:07:02] the things Paul says in the book of
[1:07:04] Hebrews and literally says to the people
[1:07:07] amen that you can't possess this land
[1:07:09] you can't come into this land but Satan
[1:07:12] always takes the word and twists it down
[1:07:15] to mean that you can't go in he always
[1:07:18] does it every promise that God ever made
[1:07:20] the church he'll twist it down to mean
[1:07:23] that you can't go in but we have been
[1:07:25] made amen full of the spirit of God we
[1:07:28] have received more than a knowledge we
[1:07:30] have received the truth we don't just
[1:07:32] have a knowledge we have received the
[1:07:34] truth amen what's he talking about he's
[1:07:36] talking about a man that heard the word
[1:07:38] and turned away from it look what they
[1:07:41] theyed the
[1:07:43] knowledge now just in case you're
[1:07:45] wondering paragraph 3:13 Hebrew series
[1:07:48] brother bam I'm a Christian but I
[1:07:49] blasphemed the Holy
[1:07:51] Ghost I said it's
[1:07:53] impossible a Christian
[1:07:56] could not blaspheme the Holy Ghost you
[1:08:00] can't do
[1:08:04] it that's powerful
[1:08:07] friend you're talking about something to
[1:08:09] put on the end of Caleb's
[1:08:11] sword you're talking about defeating
[1:08:14] every
[1:08:15] giant you're talking about obtaining a
[1:08:17] promise it is an impossible for a
[1:08:20] Christian to do it now what's he talking
[1:08:22] about he's talking about a man that come
[1:08:25] to a knowledge now what is it oh once a
[1:08:29] man received the Holy Spirit then he
[1:08:31] would backslide he'd be lost forever
[1:08:33] brother B said I couldn't get this other
[1:08:36] to make sense with that then why is it
[1:08:40] that the Bible said it he said he that
[1:08:41] heareth my words and believeth has sent
[1:08:43] me have eternal life and shall not come
[1:08:45] into condemnation but pass from Death
[1:08:46] unto life all the father hath given me
[1:08:49] will come to me none of them will I lose
[1:08:51] I will raise them up in the last day no
[1:08:53] man can pluck them out from my hand how
[1:08:56] does that divvy up with this I just
[1:08:58] couldn't understand it it was impossible
[1:09:01] for once we're enlightened there's
[1:09:03] something wrong I just couldn't get it
[1:09:05] you see he couldn't make those
[1:09:06] scriptures line up with those scriptures
[1:09:09] until the supernatural comes in do you
[1:09:12] see what Joshua is doing he's taking the
[1:09:15] scripture and identifying you in that
[1:09:19] portion and dividing the land right
[1:09:21] there at Kadesh and saying saying look
[1:09:24] now look what he's saying I don't I
[1:09:26] don't have the ability sister Susie to
[1:09:28] preach this I just have I don't really
[1:09:30] have the ability to communicate it but
[1:09:32] only Caleb and Joshua went
[1:09:35] in only Caleb and Joshua the rest of us
[1:09:38] had to be a new
[1:09:39] generation only that Spirit went in the
[1:09:44] rest went in not be because of unbelief
[1:09:47] it separated those Spirits at the at the
[1:09:51] line do you see that it's separated at
[1:09:54] the line they couldn't get
[1:09:57] in they couldn't come into the
[1:10:00] land but all church that was a Caleb
[1:10:03] standing
[1:10:06] there not
[1:10:08] disheartened not embarrassed not
[1:10:12] appalled not
[1:10:15] scared not
[1:10:17] offended but a spirit that we're able to
[1:10:19] take this
[1:10:21] land and I believe tonight that there's
[1:10:25] a portion for the bride of Christ this
[1:10:27] is where I'm going by the way there's a
[1:10:29] portion for the bride of
[1:10:30] Christ it's the third
[1:10:36] pull it's your
[1:10:38] portion it's your
[1:10:41] possession and the devil's going to pick
[1:10:43] you
[1:10:44] apart to keep you from standing on that
[1:10:48] every mistake every fault every problem
[1:10:50] every bad thought every situation he
[1:10:53] does not want that bride standing
[1:10:55] on that promise oh but God has given us
[1:10:59] a place to stand tonight hey man won't
[1:11:01] you stand to your feet with me tonight
[1:11:03] God's give us a place to
[1:11:06] stand we can
[1:11:08] stand on the Promises of
[1:11:14] God God wasn't
[1:11:16] gambling God was using the supernatural
[1:11:18] to take the contention away of his
[1:11:22] choice what he chose
[1:11:25] what God
[1:11:27] chooses when the supernatural comes with
[1:11:29] it you can see it as God's choice and
[1:11:34] then then let Ephraim and Judah work in
[1:11:37] their fields the Bible said every joint
[1:11:41] supplies is that
[1:11:44] right every joint supplies heyen it's a
[1:11:47] supply and time what a body amen what a
[1:11:50] body can we bow our hearts tonight
