[0:00] The Book of Luke if we could turn there
[0:02] in the Book of Luke in the 17th chapter
[0:04] of Luke very familiar scripture to us as
[0:08] message Believers and I just think it's
[0:10] a u a powerful
[0:14] scripture Luke 17 and verse
[0:17] 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so
[0:21] shall it be in the days of the son of
[0:24] man they did eat they drink they married
[0:27] wives they were given in marriage until
[0:29] the day Noah entered into the ark and
[0:31] the flood came and destroyed them all
[0:34] likewise also as it was in the days of
[0:37] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[0:40] they sold they planted and they builded
[0:42] but the same day that lot went out of
[0:44] Sodom it rained down fire and brimstone
[0:46] from heaven and Destroy them all even
[0:49] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[0:52] of man is revealed may God just add His
[0:56] blessings as you're seated this morning
[1:00] I'd like to
[1:02] um
[1:05] um speak to you this morning just for a
[1:08] few minutes and I know that time is
[1:11] precious but amen we'd like to um maybe
[1:14] by God's help give you something to take
[1:16] home with you and amen I I'd like to
[1:19] title it the Keystone of the Bible and
[1:21] I'm going to take that out of a a quote
[1:23] that the prophet um had um had said in
[1:27] the church age book and he said in order
[1:30] for you to fully understand the message
[1:32] of the church ages I would like to
[1:34] explain the various principles that
[1:37] allowed me to arrive to the names of The
[1:39] Messengers the length of the ages and
[1:41] other factors that were involved therein
[1:44] since this study was to be um the most
[1:47] serious one I'd ever undertaken up until
[1:49] this time I sought God for many days for
[1:53] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and
[1:55] then only did I read the scriptures on
[1:57] the church ages and into many Church
[2:01] histories written by the most unbiased
[2:04] historians that I could find and God did
[2:07] not fail to answer my prayer for while I
[2:09] read the word and the histories I was
[2:11] enabled by the Holy Spirit to see
[2:14] unfolded a pattern that runs through the
[2:17] centuries right into this present last
[2:19] day the key that was given me of the
[2:22] Lord whereby I was able to determine the
[2:24] messengers for each age is a most
[2:26] scriptural one in fact it could be
[2:28] called the Keystone of the Bible it's
[2:31] the Revelation that God never
[2:34] changes and that his ways are just as
[2:37] unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8 it
[2:41] says that Jesus Christ is the same
[2:43] yesterday today and forever do you
[2:46] believe that Ecclesiastes 3:14 I know
[2:49] that whatsoever God doeth it shall be
[2:51] forever and nothing can be to to put to
[2:53] it nor anything taken from it and God
[2:56] doeth it that men should fear before him
[2:58] that which has been is now and that
[3:00] which is to be hath already been and God
[3:02] requireth that which is pass here it is
[3:05] brother BR said the an unchanging God
[3:08] with unchanging ways what he did at the
[3:10] first he'll have to keep on doing until
[3:12] it's done for the last time there will
[3:14] never be a change he said you can apply
[3:17] that to the church ages and the kind of
[3:19] man that God would choose for the first
[3:21] age and how that God manifested in that
[3:24] man's Ministry it would be the example
[3:26] for all other ages what God did in the
[3:29] First Church ages what he wants to do in
[3:32] all the other ages amen now we know
[3:35] exactly from the word which was recorded
[3:37] by the Holy Spirit how the first or the
[3:39] original church was founded and how that
[3:41] God manifested himself in her the word
[3:44] cannot change or be changed because the
[3:48] word is God Amen in the beginning was
[3:52] the word and the Word was with God and
[3:54] the Word was God to change one word of
[3:58] it as Eve did brings uh sin and death
[4:00] even as it said in Revelations 22:18 if
[4:03] a man shall add unto these things God
[4:06] will add unto him the plagues that are
[4:08] written in this book and if any man
[4:09] shall take away from the words of the
[4:12] book of this prophecy God shall take
[4:14] away his part out of the book of life
[4:16] and out of the holy city and from the
[4:18] things which are written in this book
[4:19] thus what the church was at Pentecost is
[4:23] the
[4:24] standard that is the pattern there is no
[4:28] other pattern no matter what the scholar
[4:31] says God has not changed that pattern
[4:35] what God did at Pentecost he has to keep
[4:37] on doing until the church ages closed
[4:40] how many beli that's the truth this
[4:41] morning amen so there's only one pattern
[4:44] to the true church and that is the
[4:46] original church that was founded by God
[4:49] himself listen friends the way that God
[4:51] started that church and what God did in
[4:53] that church is what God desired to
[4:56] continue to do until the Gentile
[4:59] dispensation come to an end is that
[5:01] right amen listen friends and we know
[5:03] amen by that pattern that that church
[5:05] amen was not started by man and neither
[5:08] was it governed by men amen but it was
[5:11] started by the Holy Ghost amen then it
[5:14] was governed by the Holy Ghost is that
[5:16] right amen do you believe it this
[5:18] morning amen and listen friends no man
[5:20] started that fire amen God himself
[5:23] started that
[5:24] fire is that right amen and the church
[5:28] amen was founded on the unadulterated
[5:30] word of God Amen do you believe that
[5:33] amen and that original church amen the
[5:35] Bible says that they amen tried them
[5:38] that called themselves Apostles and
[5:40] found them to be liars and brother Brown
[5:42] said oh amen what what what boldness is
[5:45] that and how that amen what right would
[5:47] they have as a congregation to try the
[5:49] the ministry he said but see it wasn't
[5:52] that they were trying them amen no he
[5:54] said amen they were trying them by the
[5:56] word see amen and they took every
[5:59] Ministry
[6:00] amen every Ministry that they heard they
[6:02] took it back to the word amen and if
[6:05] that Minister wasn't saying what the
[6:06] word said amen that brother R said they
[6:09] stood there and said amen you are a
[6:11] false amen you're a false anointed one
[6:15] because you're not saying what Paul said
[6:18] listen friends I tell you what amen
[6:20] that's the way the church started and
[6:22] that's the way it's going to end
[6:24] somebody's going to rise up in this day
[6:26] amen somebody's going to take start
[6:28] taking every minute Min amen everything
[6:30] you hear amen everything you feel take
[6:33] it back to the word of God and I say
[6:35] this without apology this morning if
[6:37] they're not saying what William random
[6:38] said they're false anointed ones in the
[6:41] end time I don't care how anointed they
[6:43] are I don't care how good it sounds if
[6:45] it don't line up with the word of God if
[6:48] it don't line up with the message of the
[6:49] hour amen it is
[6:51] [Music]
[6:55] false hallelujah it's the Keystone of
[6:58] the Bible now as we think think about
[7:00] this amen what is the Keystone is is the
[7:02] Revelation that God never changes
[7:04] numbers 23 and 19 God is not a man that
[7:07] he should lie neither the son of man
[7:10] that he should repent amen hath he said
[7:13] and shall he not do it or hath he spoken
[7:16] and it shall not make it good amen
[7:18] Malachi 3 and 6 for I am the Lord and I
[7:21] change not Amen in the Book of Psalms in
[7:25] Psalms 102 of old hast thou laid the
[7:28] foundation of the earth and the the
[7:29] heavens are the work of thy hands they
[7:31] Shall Perish but thou shal endure yeah
[7:34] all of them shall wax old like a garment
[7:37] and as a vesture Thou shalt change them
[7:39] but and they shall be changed but Thou
[7:41] Art the same and thy years shall have no
[7:44] End Amen listen friends that's the god
[7:46] that we're serving this morning amen God
[7:49] is
[7:51] unchangeable listen it is not that God
[7:53] it's not that we're saying this morning
[7:55] that God has never changed as if he
[7:58] could
[8:00] you see what I'm saying you can say
[8:01] something that amen you know it's just
[8:03] always been the same it's never changed
[8:05] but but that's that's different than
[8:07] something being immutable because amen
[8:11] immutable is something that cannot be
[8:14] changed see and that's God God it's not
[8:18] just that the the fact that he's never
[8:20] changed amen but the fact is he cannot
[8:24] change and he cannot be changed
[8:29] man brother bar would say it this way he
[8:31] said I thank you Father that you remain
[8:33] the same God that you ever was you're
[8:36] still just the same we change ages
[8:39] change CH time change people change but
[8:43] you never change your systems are the
[8:46] same Your Grace is the same your works
[8:49] are the same because they are marvelous
[8:51] and and your ways are past any knowledge
[8:54] of a man to ever understand Amen in the
[8:56] evening messenger he said now notice you
[8:58] people all must remember this that God
[9:00] cannot change he's an unchangeable God
[9:02] see times change people change but God
[9:05] is infinite he cannot change he must
[9:08] remain the same yesterday today and
[9:10] forever amen he must always remain and
[9:12] if you believe this to be the word of
[9:14] God we can put our confidence amen we
[9:17] can put our confidence amen how many
[9:19] believes this but that's why we can put
[9:21] our confidence in God because he can't
[9:24] change now you see amen there there's
[9:27] how his message comes he s
[9:30] his message he can't change that he's
[9:32] always done it he's always has to remain
[9:34] the same and that's the way that he'll
[9:36] always do it now you see what brother R
[9:38] saying the way he did it is the way
[9:41] he'll always do
[9:44] it do you realize that's how we know
[9:46] that if God's going to send a message in
[9:48] this last day he's going to use a
[9:51] prophet amen because listen friends it's
[9:54] got to line up with a pattern of the
[9:56] scripture amen God don't do nothing
[10:00] unless he reveals it to Amen to His
[10:02] prophets first is that right so if God
[10:05] was going to amen give a message in this
[10:07] last day he would have to use a prophet
[10:09] because that amen is his unchanging
[10:15] method hallelujah amen he says in the
[10:18] identified Christ of all the ages he
[10:20] said the unchangeable god with an
[10:22] unchangeable character and his
[10:24] unchangeable characteristics must remain
[10:27] the same he cannot change his
[10:29] characteristic he cannot do it anything
[10:32] is known by his
[10:34] characteristics God is known by his
[10:36] characteristic
[10:38] right Amen in the Mighty God unveil
[10:41] brother and said in God what he does he
[10:43] just he just changes himself to become
[10:47] that or or or or to become to that
[10:50] generation to make himself known to that
[10:53] people now listen what how he said he
[10:55] changes himself but he's not changing
[10:58] his nature
[11:00] he's not changing his characteristics
[11:02] he's changing his
[11:04] mask see amen and he's doing it for the
[11:07] purpose to make himself known to that
[11:09] people and that's what we're here to
[11:12] find out tonight is what the way is God
[11:15] is supposed to make himself known to the
[11:17] people Amen in this time see he changes
[11:21] his mask he changes his act but he don't
[11:23] change his disposition he doesn't change
[11:26] his nature he just changes his mask from
[11:28] one to another he does it amen to reveal
[11:31] himself more plain to the people that
[11:33] they might know who he is and what he is
[11:36] I think this is beautiful because you
[11:38] got to catch this Revelation this is in
[11:40] fact the Keystone of the Bible and when
[11:42] you begin to realize that God has made
[11:44] known by his
[11:46] characteristics then you'll be able to
[11:48] see God no matter what form he appears
[11:51] in see it don't matter what body God is
[11:55] using you can know if it's God or Not by
[11:58] the characteris
[12:00] Mystics Hallelujah come on church amen
[12:04] listen for amen whether it's in a pillar
[12:06] of fire or was in the man Jesus it was
[12:09] the same
[12:10] characteristics amen and whether it was
[12:12] in the man Jesus or in the man William
[12:15] random it was the same characteristics
[12:18] and whether it was in I hope you can
[12:19] follow me in this whether it was in
[12:21] William random or in you it's the same
[12:26] characteristics hallelujah amen but
[12:29] because God is made known by his
[12:31] characteristics it's by his
[12:34] [Applause]
[12:37] nature you believe
[12:39] it amen it's the Keystone revelation of
[12:42] the Bible God don't never
[12:44] change see and that's how you'll know if
[12:47] it's
[12:49] God so brother Ram would say I in the in
[12:53] the in the message souls in prison he
[12:55] said Jesus said as the father sent me so
[12:57] send I you and the father sent him to
[13:00] preach to the living to those who had
[13:02] hope and then presented the same message
[13:04] to those who had no hope it seems
[13:06] fitting at this time that will have to
[13:08] be done because the spirit of Christ
[13:10] Living in us the spirit of Christ Living
[13:13] in US does not change the nature of
[13:17] him or it doesn't change God's system he
[13:21] must be the same in every generation he
[13:25] must be the same as the father sent me
[13:27] so send I you amen I I think that's a
[13:30] beautiful quote he must be the same in
[13:32] every generation listen friends this is
[13:35] a different generation and these are
[13:36] different times you're living in a
[13:39] different world Amen than even what
[13:41] brother brandham lived in but there's
[13:42] something that has remained and that's
[13:44] the characteristics of God the nature of
[13:47] God and whether amen it was in that
[13:49] generation or this gener it don't change
[13:51] God's nature or his characterist amen
[13:54] you say brother Josh what are you trying
[13:55] to say I'm trying to tell you this
[13:57] whatever the Holy Ghost done in Paul and
[14:00] Peter and James and
[14:02] John if it's the same Holy Ghost it'll
[14:05] do the same thing in you that it did in
[14:08] them hallelujah amen I'm glad to be able
[14:12] to tell you this morning I got the same
[14:14] holy ghost that Peter James and John got
[14:18] I got the same holy ghost in me that
[14:20] William random had and brother whatever
[14:23] it did in them it'll do the same thing
[14:25] in me amen and I tell you what it did in
[14:28] them just the shadow of them Apostles
[14:32] amen as it covered over the sick they
[14:34] were
[14:37] healed Hallelujah do you believe it and
[14:40] listen friends you ain't got a different
[14:41] Holy Ghost you got the same Holy
[14:44] Ghost doing the same
[14:47] thing if it change him it'll change
[14:53] you
[14:55] hallelujah oh you believe
[14:57] it so now
[15:00] watch he said in the kingsman Redeemer
[15:04] he said them Jesus Christ is the same
[15:06] yesterday today and forever do you
[15:07] believe that with all your heart how
[15:09] many you believe that with all your
[15:10] heart he is the same do you believe that
[15:13] Jesus Christ being the same yesterday
[15:15] today and forever that means that he's
[15:18] actually the
[15:20] same how is he the same he's the same in
[15:23] every
[15:24] principle he's the same God the same
[15:27] healer the same savior he's got the same
[15:32] attitude Hallelujah that's all the same
[15:35] is it right amen then if he it was the
[15:37] same and is the same he'll do and act
[15:40] the
[15:41] same how many knows that to be the
[15:45] truth because he's immutable see he's
[15:50] unchangeable immutable means something
[15:52] that cannot be
[15:56] transposed it's something that's fixed
[15:58] it's
[15:59] it can't be
[16:00] altered cannot be changed it's
[16:04] unchanging over time it's unable to be
[16:08] changed that's why in Hebrews 6 we were
[16:11] there the other night amen that that the
[16:13] Bible says for when God May promise to
[16:15] Abraham because he could swear by no
[16:17] greater he swore by
[16:20] himself listen friends what what what's
[16:22] that scripture really talking about
[16:24] because men you know when they make a
[16:25] promise because we are men and we're
[16:28] human amen then that we actually have
[16:30] the ability to to to promise something
[16:33] and then fail to carry it out see amen
[16:36] men have the ability to to even with
[16:38] good intentions sometimes you may give a
[16:41] promise but then you are unable to keep
[16:43] your promise amen and so amen that's why
[16:47] men will swear an oath by something
[16:49] greater than what they are amen because
[16:52] they're trying to give a confidence amen
[16:56] or a confirmation behind the promise
[16:58] that they made
[16:59] amen what that's why they're swearing to
[17:01] something greater or by something
[17:03] greater than what they are see amen I
[17:05] might fail but that can't fail I might
[17:07] fail but that's why they have men lay
[17:09] their hands on the Bible in the court of
[17:11] law because they know a man can
[17:14] lie amen but they used to have an
[17:17] understanding that this can't lie so
[17:19] they made them swear by something
[17:21] greater than what they were amen that
[17:24] there might be a confidence in what they
[17:26] were
[17:27] saying but when God got ready to make an
[17:30] oath with Abraham he looked all over the
[17:33] Earth amen he looked and searched for
[17:36] something greater that he could swear by
[17:38] but because there was nothing greater he
[17:40] swore by
[17:44] himself Hallelujah you know what that
[17:47] tells me friends that the promise of God
[17:50] is just as sure as the nature of
[17:54] God hallelujah and his word is just as
[17:58] un un changeable as he
[18:02] is I ask you the questions can God fail
[18:06] neither can his
[18:13] word now
[18:15] look because cuz brother Brown said I
[18:17] feel religious I feel I feel it
[18:21] too he said I feel religious when I
[18:23] think about Abraham knowing that what he
[18:27] that that we can be his seed how many
[18:29] believes you're Abraham see through
[18:31] Christ and all these promises not only
[18:34] to make it sure God held up his hand and
[18:36] swore by himself that he would do it the
[18:40] oath always the Covenant is confirmed by
[18:42] an oath and God swore by himself cuz
[18:45] there was no h to swear by he swore by
[18:48] himself that he would do it and now what
[18:51] the world how what's a matter with us
[18:54] such a promise as that a faith buil
[18:57] around something like like that a faith
[19:00] a word that promised these things in the
[19:02] last days and here we see it happening
[19:05] right before us and we're still stooping
[19:07] around and calling oursel Abraham seed
[19:10] what's brother BR saying amen listen for
[19:12] amen we're not just following just a a
[19:15] better idea come on Friends amen we got
[19:18] a more sure word of Prophecy in this
[19:20] hour amen and God is Not only promised
[19:23] his word but he's also confirmed it by
[19:25] an oath and proved to be to be true amen
[19:28] and the prophet of God say with the
[19:30] faith anchored on a word like that how
[19:32] can we ever fail amen how amen it would
[19:35] be a sin for us to doubt the word of God
[19:38] at this time it is because God not only
[19:41] said it but he confirmed it and he
[19:44] proved it to be true in this
[19:47] [Applause]
[19:50] day is what the what is the Bible going
[19:52] to say for men barely swear by the
[19:55] greater for an oath of confirmation is
[19:56] to them the end of all Strife you know
[19:58] what that means means it's the the the
[20:00] the the dispute is
[20:04] over it's the end of the
[20:07] argument but I I I I feel like stopping
[20:10] right here for a minute and just tell
[20:11] the devil stff the dispute is
[20:14] over we are not here disputing whether
[20:17] the message is right or could we trust
[20:19] it or we can't trust it the we're not
[20:21] here to argue that point this morning
[20:23] the dispute is Over The Strife has
[20:26] ended because God has confirmed is worth
[20:29] amen and listen friends amen it has been
[20:32] amen God has promised amen and made an
[20:34] oath with us to and prooved it to be
[20:37] exactly the
[20:39] truth and that confirmation is the end
[20:42] of The
[20:44] Strife watch where in God more willing
[20:48] are willing more abundantly to show Into
[20:50] The Heirs of the promise of IM
[20:52] imitability of his counsel confirmed it
[20:54] by an oath by two immutable things or
[20:57] unchangeable things
[21:00] in which it is
[21:01] impossible for God to

[23:36] Hallelujah God is obligated to his
[23:43] word he's obligate God keeps his word
[23:45] did you know
[23:47] that brother Brown said he said if you
[23:51] ever get that settled in a
[23:54] man you're going to go somewhere
[23:59] he said most of you get that he said let
[24:00] that drop down in here and let it let
[24:03] this down here say it's right and then I
[24:06] don't care what anything says
[24:09] different it'll never change your
[24:13] course he said oh you're heading out in
[24:16] the deep water
[24:18] then listen what he says Jesus Christ
[24:20] the same yesterday today and forever he
[24:22] said let's watch the
[24:23] manifestation as soon as he started his
[24:26] public Ministry watch what brother
[24:28] saying if you can follow he's talking
[24:30] about Christ his public Ministry and see
[24:32] and see what he did
[24:34] yesterday he will be the same
[24:38] today you believe that if we find out
[24:41] what he done yesterday to manifest
[24:43] himself as a messiah or you say uh you
[24:46] may may I say that again amen he said
[24:49] for here hangs the
[24:51] campaign there hangs the
[24:54] keynote there hangs the thing that will
[24:57] shake the
[24:59] there hangs a one alls sufficient thing
[25:02] what he
[25:03] was he
[25:07] is hallelujah there hangs the key note
[25:10] he called it the Keystone Revelation now
[25:12] he says the key note to the campaign
[25:15] amen there hangs the thing that will
[25:18] shake the nation amen then what the what
[25:20] did the prophet say what he was he is
[25:24] say brother what do you mean by that I'm
[25:26] telling you if he was a savior he is a
[25:30] savior if he was a deliverer he is a
[25:35] deliverer if he was a Healer He Is A
[25:39] Healer hallelujah amen I got something
[25:42] to encourage you with this morning if he
[25:44] did it for
[25:46] one and he is
[25:49] just the prophet of God said if you meet
[25:52] the same
[25:53] requirements then God is obligated to do
[25:57] for you you what he did for them oh come
[26:01] on church I tell you what you need to do
[26:03] this morning amen get your Bible out and
[26:06] find somebody in this Bible that you can
[26:09] identify with and then you look amen you
[26:12] look over there and you read about sham
[26:14] guard and you said oh God if you did it
[26:17] for him and if you're the same God this
[26:19] morning you got to do it for
[26:22] me Hallelujah read about Samson amen and
[26:26] he say oh God if you did it for him you
[26:29] got to do it for me read about David and
[26:32] if you did it for him you got to do it
[26:34] for
[26:38] me Hallelujah because whatever he was he
[26:45] is we ain't serving the god of the I was
[26:49] or the god of the I will be he's the god
[26:52] of the I am
[27:00] Hallelujah you believe
[27:03] it the prophet of God said if he is the
[27:07] same and how many can say amen he is
[27:10] then we should sell out and surrender
[27:12] everything to
[27:14] him all our motives all our objectives
[27:18] amen our will amen that we should
[27:20] surrender to him do you believe that now
[27:24] as we just turn a little bit of a corner
[27:26] now amen the Prophet said all scripture
[27:29] has compound meanings and it runs in
[27:31] cycles for instance he said over there
[27:33] in Matthew I believe it was out of Egypt
[27:36] I'll call my son and now the scripture
[27:38] that Matthew was referring to really was
[27:41] pertaining to Israel and God said out of
[27:43] Egypt I'll call my son Israel and he
[27:45] called Israel his son out but it also
[27:48] meant
[27:50] Jesus see out of out of Egypt I call my
[27:53] son see how it routines back the cycle
[27:57] of time swings it back ever so often and
[28:01] history repeats itself and scripture
[28:04] repeats itself down through the age any
[28:06] scholar knows that that's ever studied
[28:08] it from the scriptural standpoint to
[28:10] watch how that scripture will repeat
[28:12] itself it runs in Cycles like that it
[28:13] certainly does another place what shall
[28:16] I do with this Jesus called Christ
[28:17] brother B said you see nature in history
[28:20] repeats itself because nature continues
[28:22] the same trees will continue to grow
[28:25] vegetables will come flowers uh the
[28:27] World Turns just like it always did it's
[28:29] nature see and the nature of each age
[28:33] produces again and reproduces the
[28:36] reflection of what a nature was before
[28:39] them and today we find ourselves again
[28:42] standing on that same
[28:44] place so now brother BR is saying that
[28:48] the nature of the age will run in a
[28:51] cycle and he said you'll find yourself
[28:53] because n uh history repeats itself
[28:57] nature repeats itself and he said even
[29:00] the scriptures see amen the the the the
[29:03] prophecy will will will come around in
[29:06] another cycle and he said and you'll
[29:08] find yourself standing
[29:13] again so in other words what's he trying
[29:15] to show you he's trying to show you that
[29:17] that's why you can go back in the Bible
[29:21] amen and God laid things in this Bible
[29:24] that would be a type of where you're
[29:26] standing at now
[29:30] and then by that whatever God did
[29:33] then you can expect God to do the same
[29:36] thing
[29:37] [Applause]
[29:42] now watch this it's
[29:45] powerful because brother bam says he
[29:49] takes and he begin to tell us how many
[29:51] knows that God would use the spirit of
[29:52] Elijah five
[29:55] times now how do we know it's Elijah's
[30:00] Ministry by the characteristics of
[30:02] it I think this is very powerful things
[30:05] with brother Brown amen even uses this
[30:08] same Keystone Revelation to identify the
[30:11] two witnesses of Revelations
[30:13] 11 he identified who they were by their
[30:17] characteristics of their Ministry even
[30:19] you know brother Brown said it had to be
[30:21] Moses and Elijah because look what they
[30:22] done amen they interrupted nature turned
[30:25] the water into blood and amen shut up
[30:28] the Heavens For he said who did that
[30:32] before so he took the characteristic of
[30:35] the ministry amen and identified amen
[30:39] the the ministry of the end time because
[30:42] of what they had already done oh friends
[30:45] I hope you understand when I say do you
[30:47] know it was the same way that brother
[30:48] Brenham was able to identify the souls
[30:50] under the altar he said they couldn't be
[30:52] bride he said cuz look what they're
[30:55] doing they're crying out for vengeance
[30:57] he said that can't be bride amen because
[30:59] the bride would have the same spirit in
[31:01] them that Christ had in him when he was
[31:04] hanging on the cross and he said father
[31:07] forgive and then he proved it amen
[31:09] because when they were stoning Steven
[31:11] because he had the same Holy Ghost the
[31:14] life that was in Christ was now in Sten
[31:16] he said oh Father forgive
[31:19] them and brother Brown said the bride
[31:22] will have that same
[31:26] forgiveness come on Young people I'm
[31:28] giving you a keystone to identify every
[31:31] Ministry every church you can identify
[31:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ by the
[31:37] characteristics I tell you what if
[31:39] there's hatred amen and Malice amen and
[31:42] all kind of mean Spirit coming out that
[31:45] is not the spirit of
[31:48] Christ identified by the
[31:52] [Applause]
[31:54] characteristic brother said that's it
[31:56] see them Souls Under The Altar and the
[31:58] still that's some
[31:59] Jews cuz listen they stood for the
[32:02] testimony of the word of God but not of
[32:04] Jesus
[32:06] Christ they're crying out for that so by
[32:08] that
[32:10] same I think it's so beautiful because
[32:13] it was by that that that that that uh
[32:16] Keystone Revelation that he identified
[32:20] the messenger of of the
[32:22] ages you know what brother Brown said he
[32:25] did it because whichever one
[32:29] was a closest to having the same uh uh
[32:32] quality in their Ministry that was in
[32:34] the Apostle
[32:36] Paul's that was a messenger to the age
[32:39] is that
[32:40] right so watch this because amen that's
[32:43] how we can identify the ministry of
[32:47] Elijah I'm just get I'm going to tell
[32:49] you amen I I come to these meetings to
[32:52] Amen to to to cut the devil up so
[32:55] because the devil's are coming on now
[32:56] trying to amen trying to to tell some of
[32:58] our young people and even some of our
[32:59] old people that William Brandon was not
[33:01] the Elijah that was promised in Malachi
[33:03] 4 and they're trying to come and
[33:05] discredit and discredit and tear down
[33:08] the ministry of William randam and say
[33:09] it could not be he could not be that
[33:11] fulfillment but I tell you what I've
[33:13] done amen I've checked it by the
[33:17] characteristics and the problem is is I
[33:19] already got three
[33:22] examples in this Bible of what the
[33:25] ministry of Elijah would do
[33:28] come on church I tell you what when
[33:30] Elijah come he stood there and with
[33:32] stood that Jezebel
[33:34] [Music]
[33:38] religion Hallelujah he wasn't a
[33:41] jellyfish weak back Christian he stood
[33:45] right there in the face of all adversity
[33:47] and with stood stood that Jezebel
[33:50] religion and I say this William random
[33:53] amen did exactly the same thing
[33:59] and the second time God used the
[34:01] ministry of Elijah was in Elisha and
[34:03] Elisha was a man that was conscious of
[34:06] two Dimensions amen he can stand in this
[34:09] world and be conscious of two
[34:11] dimensions and tell you what you
[34:14] couldn't see in another
[34:17] dimension I checked the minister of
[34:19] William random by the example laying in
[34:22] the scripture and I tell you by the
[34:25] characteristics of his ministry
[34:28] I declare to you amen he is the anti
[34:33] Elijah of Malachi
[34:38] [Music]
[34:41] 4 come on Friends what do he say about
[34:44] John the Baptist John the Baptist was a
[34:46] man of the Wilderness come stoning out
[34:48] of the Wilderness even eating Locust and
[34:50] wild
[34:52] honey and he walked right up to Herod
[34:54] and said it ain't lawful for you to have
[34:56] your brother's wife come on is he didn't
[34:58] back down on nothing amen he didn't he
[35:00] didn't come to tickle their ears he said
[35:02] the axe is laid to the root of the
[35:06] tree amen and what did he do he went as
[35:09] a
[35:11] forerunner forerunning the very coming
[35:14] of the Lord but I want to tell you there
[35:16] was a voice down on the old high river
[35:18] that spoke one day and said as John the
[35:21] Baptist was sent to forun the first
[35:24] coming of Christ so will your message
[35:30] for and the
[35:35] second listen friend I checked it by the
[35:38] the characteristics of
[35:40] it and the ministry
[35:45] matches I tell that devil this morning
[35:48] you come too late tell me that William
[35:50] Brandon was not the Elijah of Malachi
[35:53] 4 but brother I want to tell you this
[35:56] amen if there's an
[35:59] Elijah there got to be somebody that
[36:02] their heart is going to be turned by
[36:05] that
[36:09] message oh I want to preach right now
[36:11] amen I ain't got the voice to do it but
[36:13] I want to tell you if there's a jezebel
[36:16] and there is and there's an Ahab and
[36:19] there he is amen if there's a jezebel
[36:22] there's got to be an Elijah but brother
[36:24] if there's an Elijah there's got to be
[36:26] 7,000 some where that's never bow the
[36:29] knee to bail there's got to be somebody
[36:32] that's got their name on the last book
[36:35] of life before the foundation of the
[36:37] world if there's an Elijah there's got
[36:39] to be somebody that's going to stand
[36:42] with that
[36:46] Elijah
[36:48] Hallelujah I tell you what I believe I'm
[36:51] looking at some of them that will not
[36:54] Bend we will not bow and when The
[36:56] Showdown come and the fire falls amen we
[37:00] say the Lord he is
[37:17] God
[37:24] hallelujah you believe it
[37:28] you know brother BR in the Feast of
[37:31] trumpets brother Bram was talking about
[37:32] them two
[37:34] witnesses and he said I caught
[37:40] that see he said he said you think it
[37:44] was
[37:46] Enoch he said because he see Elijah had
[37:50] never was taken into heaven in a Char he
[37:54] said you think it was Enoch because he
[37:55] never died
[37:57] he said but he said but no he said it
[37:59] had to be Moses and then he said' I'll
[38:01] prove it to
[38:02] you and then he shows Moses and Elijah
[38:05] standing on Mount
[38:08] Transfiguration and listen friends even
[38:10] though Moses had died amen amen the air
[38:14] and the angels had carried him away but
[38:16] listen friends amen remember brother
[38:18] Brown shows up very powerful he said
[38:20] when Moses got ready to die amen he had
[38:22] a place to put his foot and when he
[38:25] stepped from this Dimension he just
[38:26] stepped over onto the
[38:29] rock hallelujah amen and there because
[38:32] he died like that amen he was seen again
[38:36] on Mount
[38:37] Transfiguration amen standing there with
[38:39] Christ in the presence of Peter James
[38:41] and John Amen brother Brown says see me
[38:43] proves it he said it can't be Enoch that
[38:45] would break the
[38:53] pattern now brother BR
[38:55] remember brother brandham said said that
[38:59] that that early church would be the
[39:01] pattern or the example Paul's Ministry
[39:05] would be the example brother Brown said
[39:07] Paul founded the church at Ephesus about
[39:10] the middle of the first century he said
[39:13] this enables us to set the DAT to the
[39:15] beginning of the Ephesian Church age he
[39:17] said his manner of ministering set the
[39:20] pattern that all future Messengers were
[39:23] to Aspire to and actually set the
[39:26] pattern for every true minister of God
[39:29] though he would not obtain such Heights
[39:31] in the prophetic realm as did Paul
[39:33] Paul's Ministry had a three-fold
[39:36] quality and and was as follows first of
[39:39] all first of all Paul was
[39:42] absolutely true to the
[39:44] word he never deviated from it no matter
[39:48] the
[39:50] cost listen friend brother Brown said
[39:52] every true Minister will aspired to to
[39:56] to to to strive Amen to have these same
[40:00] qualities in their Min it ain't that
[40:01] they're trying to be like Paul or you
[40:04] know mimic him and in in in their in
[40:06] their in Charisma or in action or so
[40:08] forth amen but they'll have the same
[40:10] quality of ministry that was in the
[40:13] Apostle Paul and then he breaks it down
[40:14] in threefold he said first of all he be
[40:17] true to the
[40:18] word secondly his ministry was in the
[40:21] power of the spirit thereby
[40:23] demonstrating the spoken and written
[40:25] word is that right Paul said I didn't
[40:28] come with enticing words of men's wisdom
[40:30] but in the power of the Holy Ghost amen
[40:32] Paul amen believed amen that when the
[40:34] word is preached amen it would
[40:37] demonstrate amen how many believes that
[40:40] amen listen friends amen and thirdly
[40:42] amen Paul's Ministry would have evident
[40:45] fruit of a god-given Ministry in other
[40:47] words amen somebody when Paul preached
[40:50] amen there was going to be Souls one to
[40:52] Christ amen there was going to be fruits
[40:54] of his ministry come on church I'm
[40:56] telling you amen I'm giving you young
[40:58] people a key amen that you can identify
[41:00] between the true and the false amen
[41:03] first of all first and foremost amen I
[41:06] don't care what's going on or what's
[41:07] happening or what or how anointed
[41:09] anybody is if they're not staying true
[41:11] to the
[41:16] word that is the First Quality amen that
[41:20] that that that brother B put to Paul's
[41:22] Ministry amen they that he stood true to
[41:25] the word I mean knows that even our
[41:28] Prophet amen when he went beyond the
[41:30] curtain of time amen he stood there and
[41:32] he asked amen well Paul had to stand
[41:34] with his group said yes he said praise
[41:36] God because I preached what Paul
[41:40] preached Hallelujah and there was a
[41:42] multitude of people that begin to scream
[41:45] out we're resting on that Hallelujah you
[41:48] may call me crazy but I believe I was
[41:50] one of them amen and because I was one
[41:53] of them I'm here this morning and I'm
[41:55] still resting on this message I tell you
[41:59] why amen because I checked it with a
[42:01] pattern brother amen I tell you this
[42:04] message lines up from Genesis all the
[42:06] way to
[42:15] Revelations you know what somebody asked
[42:17] me one time they come and said well
[42:19] brother brother Josh don't you think
[42:21] don't you think it's possible you know
[42:22] that somebody could uh uh uh uh you know
[42:25] that we could that we could preach these
[42:27] things and and let's you know and and
[42:30] just leave brother brandham out of it I
[42:32] mean you
[42:35] know and I was listening to him for a
[42:37] little bit you know I was thinking you
[42:38] know that well we just put too much
[42:40] emphasis you know on the problem we just
[42:42] and don't you think we could just preach
[42:43] the Revelation just you know we ain't
[42:45] got to talk about the prophet and just
[42:48] leave brother brandom out of
[42:50] it and for a minute you know brother Ray
[42:53] I was thinking about that I thought well
[42:55] you know uh maybe I don't know and all
[42:58] of a sudden something just struck my
[42:59] heart I said I tell you what I believe
[43:01] as soon as you can tell the
[43:03] story about the ark and leave Noah out
[43:07] of
[43:13] it and if you can talk about Israel
[43:15] coming out of Egypt in an exodus and
[43:19] leave Moses out of
[43:23] it come on church if you can talk about
[43:26] the Earth early church and leave Paul
[43:28] out of it then you can talk about this
[43:31] end time message and the change of my
[43:34] body and leave brother bam out of it but
[43:37] brother if you going to put Noah in the
[43:39] story and Moses in the story and Paul in
[43:42] the story then why not just put brother
[43:45] brandom in it too brother I'm telling
[43:47] you amen we're not here to worship
[43:50] William brandom we worship Jesus
[43:53] Christ but William random was a a
[43:57] channel amen that God
[44:06] used
[44:08] Hallelujah that's how we know that
[44:10] Malachi 4 is not an anointing that's
[44:13] going to come on a
[44:14] group you know how we know cuz that's
[44:16] not what he done the first three
[44:19] [Applause]
[44:22] times and God don't change his pattern
[44:31] brother Braham said I want you to be
[44:33] very careful here and see this God has
[44:36] promised that at the end time Malachi 4
[44:38] is going to be fulfilled it has to be
[44:41] for it's the spirit quick and word of
[44:43] God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus
[44:45] referred to it it's just before Christ
[44:48] comes the second time by the time Jesus
[44:51] comes all scripture must be fulfilled
[44:53] the Gentile dispensation will be done
[44:57] will be in its last Church age when the
[44:59] messenger of Malachi comes he will be
[45:01] right with the word he will take the
[45:03] whole Bible from Genesis the revelations
[45:06] he'll start at the serpent sea and carry
[45:07] on to the messenger of the latter rain
[45:10] amen he will be rejected by the
[45:12] denominations he has to be guys because
[45:14] it's history repeating
[45:17] itself amen it's history repeating
[45:20] itself from the time of Ahab it's
[45:23] Israel's history under a Ahab happening
[45:25] right here in America where the prophet
[45:27] of Malachi appears as Israel left Egypt
[45:30] wor to worship and freedom pushed out
[45:32] the natives raised up a nation with
[45:33] great leaders like David Etc and then
[45:36] they put an Ahab on the throne with a
[45:38] jezebel behind him to direct so have we
[45:40] done the very same in America our
[45:42] forefathers left for this land to
[45:44] Worship in and to live in Freedom they
[45:46] pushed back the natives they took over
[45:47] the land mighty men like Washington and
[45:49] Lincoln raised up but after a while
[45:52] other men of such poor caliber seceded
[45:54] those worthy men and soon and Ahab was
[45:57] set in a presidential chair with a
[45:59] jezebel behind him to direct him it is a
[46:01] such a time that mount that the Mount
[46:04] Carmel Showdown amen will come and watch
[46:07] this carefully now to see in the word
[46:09] John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he
[46:12] planted the former he planted H the
[46:14] former rain and was rejected by the
[46:16] organization of his of of his day Jesus
[46:19] came and had a mount Transfiguration
[46:21] Showdown amen the second Forerunner of
[46:23] Christ will SE for the latter rain and
[46:26] Jesus Will will be the showdown between
[46:28] the denominations and the Creed for he
[46:31] will come to back up his word and to
[46:33] take his bride and a
[46:35] Rapture Hallelujah the first Showdown

[47:38] showed you because I want you to catch
[47:41] this as it was so shall it
[47:45] be as it was in the days of
[47:49] Sodom now Jesus in in in in Luke 17 he
[47:54] says as it was and in the days of lot
[47:58] I've always thought this was a powerful
[48:00] because Jesus don't say anything about
[48:03] Abraham but he says as it was in the
[48:05] days of lot and then he'll start
[48:09] describing the condition of the world at
[48:11] that time so as it was in the days of
[48:14] lot and then it'll describe what was
[48:17] going on in Sodom amen but he don't say
[48:20] nothing about Abraham and then he'll go
[48:22] and say as it was in the days of Noah
[48:25] amen and they were uh you know uh given
[48:27] in marriage and so forth and all the
[48:29] conditions of the world Amen at that
[48:31] time so shall it be so as it was so
[48:33] shall it be but listen friends amen I
[48:35] thank God for a
[48:37] message cuz brother Brown comes along
[48:39] and picks up them same scriptures amen
[48:42] and and it take where Jesus said as it
[48:43] was in the days of lot but friends you
[48:45] got to take it and look at the pattern
[48:47] look at the remember what was will be
[48:50] and what is has already
[48:52] been amen so you go back and you find
[48:55] your day in the
[48:58] scripture and Jesus said when the son of
[49:00] man is going to be revealed it's going
[49:02] to be as it was in the days of
[49:05] lot amen so if there's a
[49:09] Sodom how many believe you're living in
[49:12] Sodom come on friends we are not that's
[49:14] not something down the road we're living

[49:27] right
[49:27] now but if there's a Sodom there's got
[49:30] to be a
[49:31] lot and the Bible said the sins of the
[49:33] city Vex his righteous
[49:35] Soul me knows that's what the Bible says
[49:38] but do you know lot ain't even your

[50:01] angels that was sent down to minister to
[50:04] lot and blind the eyes of the people to
[50:07] the door amen listen but if there is a
[50:09] lot and there's two angels with him
[50:12] there's got to be an Abraham
[50:14] somewhere under another
[50:17] Ministry God made flesh revealing the
[50:20] secret of the
[50:22] heart Hallelujah Well church I want to
[50:26] tell you even if there's a Lot's

[52:00] one of
[52:01] them two prophets of Revelations 11 and
[52:04] don't fit the pattern but the same
[52:06] Prophet took the same pattern and said
[52:09] Enoch does have a
[52:11] type he is not typing one of them two

[53:36] criticize and they're going to make fun
[53:38] amen of all the worship that's going on
[53:39] in this camp but I'll just take the
[53:42] pattern of the word of God Amen and I
[53:45] will show it to you in the Bible what
[53:48] you're actually doing you're a Rebecca
[53:51] that's drawing
[53:53] water and you're watering the very power
[53:57] that's going to carry you to meet

[54:15] [Applause]
[54:27] friends I could preach all day but I
[54:28] ain't going through but I tell you what
[54:30] I could because you can go back all
[54:33] through this Bible amen and you're going
[54:34] to look at the at the pattern amen
[54:37] you're going to see amen that Amen in
[54:40] every example God put you in the story
[54:43] if there's a Boaz there's got to be a
[54:46] Ruth come on friends if there's a
[54:48] Jericho there's got to be a RAB amen oh
[54:52] friends amen there's got to be an Esther
[54:54] somewhere amen God was right in your
[54:56] story if there's a Judah there's got to
[54:57] be a Tamar amen God was putting it all
[55:00] down through the scripture amen listen
[55:02] there's got to be a Mary somewhere that
[55:04] said be it unto me according to Thy word
[55:07] amen the prophet of God said I tell you
[55:08] what to do go back in the
[55:13] Bible and find yourself in this
[55:20] scripture let me just try to close with
[55:22] this I'm going to actually read the
[55:23] quote to you but brother Brown said
[55:27] I
[55:28] imagine this dear person that asked this
[55:30] question brother they asked brother
[55:34] B why that the Bible doesn't call didn't
[55:39] call his
[55:41] name the name William brandom
[55:44] see he said see he said now you
[55:49] see familiar places that refer to it in
[55:52] the Bible they that says certain
[55:54] things now if watch History repeats
[55:57] itself in the
[55:59] Bible now let's just give you a
[56:01] scripture for one now and he goes into
[56:05] Matthew 3 again and God calling his son
[56:07] out of
[56:08] Egypt and then he says now if you got a
[56:11] scoffield or a reference Bible you'll
[56:13] follow that reference there in the
[56:15] margin it'll bring you back when he
[56:17] called Jacob or Israel out of Egypt as
[56:21] Jacob was his son that would be caught
[56:22] out of e but Jesus was a son that would
[56:25] be caught out so
[56:27] the word of God is never
[56:29] ending see we identify ourselves in the
[56:33] Bible how many remembers my message of
[56:35] identifying yourself with the Christian
[56:38] characters brother R said see I preached
[56:40] it there in Phoenix he said many of you
[56:42] has got the tape on it identifying with
[56:44] Christian character you see you identify
[56:46] yourself anywhere you want to in the
[56:48] scripture if you're a Christian and if
[56:50] you're not a scripture then you identify
[56:52] yourself in the Bible see so I think
[56:55] maybe that would help
[56:56] and I so so brother BR what is he trying
[56:59] to say listen because they say you know
[57:01] brother BR why is your name not called
[57:03] you know and and it's you know I
[57:06] actually had somebody ask me that same
[57:08] question one day said well well you know
[57:10] if this message is what you you you
[57:12] claim why I didn't I know anything about
[57:13] it and furthermore why is brother
[57:15] Brown's name not in the Bible and I said
[57:17] it
[57:19] is his name is all through this Bible
[57:23] and so is mine
[57:28] come on
[57:29] friends so is
[57:31] mine and I want you to leave this this
[57:34] this youth meeting amen with that
[57:36] Revelation in your heart so is
[57:38] mine amen I not only see William bram's
[57:41] name in that scripture I see my
[57:43] name I'm identified under that messenger
[57:46] I'm identified with that messenger I
[57:47] tell you I'll give a I'll give you a
[57:49] great example of this in closing amen
[57:51] because there was a little woman over in
[57:52] Memphis one day
[57:57] amen she had a son that got sick God to
[58:00] give her that boy amen and when her son
[58:03] was on on the the the deathbed amen she
[58:07] begin to pray and you know what she did
[58:09] and brother Ray she went back in this
[58:10] Bible and she began to read and she
[58:12] found herself in the
[58:14] scripture and she began to say Lord I'm
[58:17] not shooting my woman I'm not shooting
[58:20] my woman Lord you gave me this son amen
[58:23] I am that shoo my woman where is your
[58:25] Elijah
[58:27] Hallelujah she found herself in the word
[58:29] of God and she and she knew if God is an
[58:33] unchanging God with unchanging ways and
[58:36] he is a just God and he is a faithful
[58:39] God Amen whatever he done for her he's
[58:42] got to do the same thing for me and if
[58:44] if you gave me a son and I'm not sh of
[58:47] my woman there got to be an Elijah
[58:49] somewhere Hallelujah and God Almighty
[58:52] took the faith of that woman and
[58:54] grounded an airplane
[58:56] and led a prophet of God right to her
[58:59] house Hallelujah and I'm going to tell

[59:32] the same thing for me if you can
[59:34] identify yourself in the word of
[59:38] God it's the Keystone of the
[59:41] Bible God never

[1:33:42] their shoulder to the wheel and been a
[1:33:44] part of the team and the staff and the

[1:33:49] thank you amen we have a host of pastors
[1:33:52] that have come this weekend and we want
[1:33:54] to thank them amen some of them not here
[1:33:57] this morning but thank them amen
[1:34:04] um I I I know that maybe uh through the
[1:34:07] years back there was some of the
[1:34:09] meetings some of the camp meetings that
[1:34:10] didn't want pastors to attend we want
[1:34:13] the pastors to attend and if they got
[1:34:15] young people here we want them to come
[1:34:17] with them and be a part of the meetings
[1:34:19] and and uh amen because what we're want
[1:34:22] to see is an upward movement the power
[1:34:24] of God for all the young people and and
[1:34:27] and and the elders alike and amen I uh
[1:34:30] sitting there listen to Josh preached
[1:34:31] this morning and I was I was sitting
[1:34:34] there thinking he he was coming across
[1:34:36] that when the the ending of all strife
[1:34:38] and I could hear the prophet saying it
[1:34:40] the seventh seal ends all things amen it
[1:34:43] ends all the Strife it ends all the
[1:34:45] doubting it it just ends it isn't it
[1:34:47] isn't it something young people that the
[1:34:49] seventh seal has been revealed in every
[1:34:53] tith
[1:34:54] in the Bible amen and it's come to you
[1:34:57] in story form that you might be able to
[1:35:00] catch it when it was hid from the wise
[1:35:01] and prudent amen but yet it was revealed
[1:35:04] to you such as you said well my my name
[1:35:08] brother Wayne it ain't there but you
[1:35:09] know it is there amen it is there how
[1:35:13] many knows the scripture where it says
[1:35:15] amen they overcame him by the blood of
[1:35:19] the lamb and the word of testimony y'all
[1:35:21] know what pronouns mean I know
[1:35:24] they who is
[1:35:26] They isn't it beautiful he didn't put
[1:35:29] one name there he gave they so you could
[1:35:32] be added into that
[1:35:35] group and
[1:35:40] they that same group is in Hebrews the
[1:35:43] 11th chapter when the Bible said that
[1:35:45] they speaking of the former ages cannot
[1:35:48] be made perfect without us speaking of
[1:35:51] this same
[1:35:52] group but you said brother wayang then
[1:35:54] it's just a group experience but in
[1:35:56] Revelations 3 it said he that
[1:35:58] overcometh and it takes it to a personal
[1:36:02] so here this morning personally you're
[1:36:04] in the scriptures and once you see that
[1:36:06] it is the end of The Strife because it's
[1:36:09] not just something that the story was
[1:36:12] told it's a life that is living today we
[1:36:14] do want to take a a special moment to
