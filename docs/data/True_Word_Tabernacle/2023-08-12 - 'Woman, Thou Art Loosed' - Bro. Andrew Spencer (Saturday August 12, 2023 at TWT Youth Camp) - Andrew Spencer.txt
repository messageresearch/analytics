weekend God is so good you know we're in great expectation tonight this is our third year having this Youth Camp and Time After Time service after service we've seen the Lord come and his grace and his power do Mighty things and but uh how many would just say Lord once more once more Lord there's still a need there's still a question still a desire once more Lord amen tonight will be our prayer line service and so we just want to make a couple points of order about that the we'll direct it as we've done in previous years people will come around this side we'll have uh we'll we'll have some ministers seasoned and proven Ministries will be gathered here together and we'll just bring around this way and right through have you prayed for it's quite a large group of people so we just we want to keep an orderly flow and and want to just handle things efficiently as far as that goes so there there's a group of people that have already been instructed how to assist the ministry brothers and sisters so we just ask you just respectfully let them direct you and uh and friends I'd I'd just like to I'd like to turn our attention to think about the stakes even those you the families and the older ones in the back our young people facing real battles great struggles things previous generations knew nothing about the world has become so wicked and the devil's on the Rampage our young people are under such a such attack it's total war to be a believer in this age friends think about the need think about the stakes think about how critical it is amen that we we get out of his way tonight let the Lord come amongst us amen and do what we do not have the ability to do friends tonight it's not about me it's not about you there can't be any self in there amen this is not about any church this is not about any Ministry this is about the needs of our young people amen could we get in one mind and one Accord call on the Lord to come amongst us do the miraculous amen amen we want to share a little testimony just to show you how Satan has been attacking this meeting last brother Elijah Evans why don't you just come up with me brother Elijah amen just this week you know we've seen a lot in the home Church of hell how the devil uh the devil's also been an expectation amen so we just want to share this with you for your encouragement brother uh brother Elijah is a good boy there's hardly a finer boy in shoe leather today and the he's working hard he's uh he's making a lot of sacrifice for his future and so the other day he was driving tired and and uh and fell asleep at the wheel I had to he woke up had to Swerve a mailbox and and his car went off the road into the woods on the other side go ahead brothers and show those pictures as I'm sharing with you amen and and in inches inches could have made the difference between brother Elijah being here tonight and US losing another one of our young men amen so we just thank God for his Mercy for his keeping power amen [Music] [Applause] even the emergency staff that came to to get brother Elijah they had just left an accident where somebody didn't walk away ran into a telephone pole so it's the grace of God you know young people we think the devil has a lot of power we struggle with a lot of fear where the power Satan has over you but you know the enemy cannot touch you amen he cannot touch you while God is has a purpose for your life amen and so so no matter how angry the devil becomes and no matter how much he's tried to fight this meaning we shall Prevail tonight amen why because God has a purpose I believe in gathering us together tonight he's going to do amen he's going to do the miraculous he's going to do the supernatural amen do you expect that tonight hallelujah amen brother Brown said if Satan can't touch you if you're serving God's purpose amen there's nothing that can take you under the ground but if uh if it's God's purpose to put you in the ground he said there's nothing that can keep you out when he calls you amen we're resting in His Grace We're resting in his purpose tonight amen uh cancer can't touch you what can we say about the service last night amen there's just not words [Music] no words no words to describe the goodness of the Lord you know there's a time for words and there's a Time for Action and what we saw last night you know you could tell the story of David and Goliath but there was another story put in the history books last night of a Son of God not too tall not much strength in his body but we saw him stand on the neck of a stage four Giant amen with a double-edged sword take the head off of the enemy friends in a time like that it's not a time to sit around and talk it's time to draw your sword amen how many will draw your sword tonight say Lauren amen I want to go to the battle tonight amen I I I'm here I'm here for victory amen I I'm here to follow the leadership God has put in front of me I'm going to take the sword of the word that is preached tonight I'm going to strike the devil with him amen Amen brother Brandon said that's what we got to do is take Faith take that sword of the spirit thus saith the Lord scream Hallelujah and then cut down every enemy in front of you amen cut every enemy if an old spooky Spirit comes in and you say brother Nathan you know I just I'm a little unsettled in my spirit tonight I'm I I I've got feelings running through my mind and I just I just uh uh I just feel all flighty and the devil's attacking me Amen brother Ram said if an old spooky spirit's making you feel that cut that thing away with the word of the Lord amen the joy of the Lord is my strength he says get away from me he says whack you cut him with that sword amen whether it be a demon whether it be an enemy whether it be sickness whether it be disease whatever it is take that word and pull it with the sword and if you whack it the first time and it doesn't seem to move Whack It Again Whack It Again he said whack it again and whack it to you chip a hole like a like a little baby chicken pecking its way out of an egg amen young people persevere tonight hey man we're here to fight we're here to press amen I want you to draw your sword tonight say Lord amen I'm going to battle with this enemy I'm going to hit him I'm going to strike amen I'm not going to give up until I see my victory I'm going to persevere Hallelujah Brother Brad said that's the soldier a soldier of the Cross knock every enemy out hallelujah amen will you do that tonight amen draw that sword friends I say it's going to be a bloody day for the devil amen we're going to draw the sword of the word tonight we're not going to put it away until we've bloodied it with the head of every devil that would come against this Young Generation amen because you're called to be Champions amen God used the servant of the Lord last night to tell you what you are you're not a weakling you're a champion amen this bride amen this bride is made to endure the fight she can take a hit amen it's not just how hip hard they could hit in the first round but the Bride of Jesus Christ in the seventh round can hit with just as much power as they did in the first round hallelujah amen that's who you are friends hey man that's who you are young people champions amen soldiers of the Cross so you know as these musicians are playing going forth in the beauty of Holiness what they are doing they're leading us to war amen are you ready for the battle tonight but I'll tell you this you won't need to fight in this battle tonight we'll stand still we'll see the salvation of the Lord hallelujah amen we got one American prayer request for brother Jim McNulty is to have open-heart surgery with multiple bypasses he's going Tuesday to schedule the surgery

gonna have it's an honor to have brother Joe Adams with us this year and we're going to invite you brother to come and pray I'll pray for these for the needs for the service and also for the offering that we're about to take God's really been moving this week you know we re-baptize brother Joe today about six or seven times praise the Lord certainly an honor and a privilege to be here for the Wayne Brother Ray Nathan to be able to stand with you shoulder the shoulder of the other ministers of the gospel and not only them but to be here with you because God's called us in this hour to be Warriors to be Fighters we're not giving up we're not backing down and ask you tonight [Music] before we go to prayer how many of you would have a real need how many of you tonight are suffering maybe from a suicidal spirit keep your hands up if that be you let's be honest I want you parents to recognize your children are in a battle I want you adults to help us create an atmosphere so the chains of Darkness will be broken off their lives tonight some of them are facing some serious needs how many you longing for the Holy Ghost not just an emotion not just a goosebump I'm talking about a genuine nature change where you know that you met God and God met you and sealed you away you know the prophet of God will tell us you'll get what you expect he said if you come expecting disappointment that's exactly what you'll get you can line up ministers all day long anointing men of God and have a prayer line but if you don't come with an expectation that when you get to the other side that you're going to get your desire man you're coming through that line in vain so tonight is we have a prayer line let me encourage you come with an expectation the prophet of God would preach a message expectation because he knew this generation would need to know about it the seriousness of what it means to have a real expectation we had a young girl at our church lost all our hair but she came with some bobby pins she says when I come to the other side I'm gonna put these in my hair oh it didn't happen overnight that young girls now she's married he's got long beautiful black hair and she and she's serving the lord because she came with an expectation and let me tell you if you'll come tonight whether you want the Holy Ghost whether you want to change the darkness broken off your life God will meet you in this prayer line and when you come through you'll be different when you get to the other side chains of Darkness will be broken off your life healing will be your portion Deliverance will be the manifestation of the holy spirit it's yours tonight but you got to believe don't come endowed so let's just bow our heads and we take this need tonight Commit This

going through in the battle that they're facing God I'm under expectation tonight that the enemy or his back will be broken tonight and God just as we heard about a five foot six individual or put his foot on the neck of the enemy last night God I believe there's more here tonight that are able and willing and desired to do the same thing father put their foot on the head of that enemy of Darkness

praise the Lord praise Praises be to the name of the Lord most high Isn't Our Lord Jesus Christ beyond all of our limitations and our expectations our lord Jesus is so amazing he never fails us to think that that we've been here as a as a camp for three years now and to look back and to see what our Lord Jesus Christ has done it's amazing to think that we have some representatives of Heaven that have decided I'm going all the way not just in this camp but when I get back home all the way amen Isn't Our Lord just wonderful to us I want to just take this moment and I want to I want to thank the Lord for what he's done here and I want to express my appreciation to Brother Ray to brother Wayne brother Nathan for allowing us be a part of these meetings and to to be attached to these young people's testimonies and we counted one of the greatest privileges in our life and I want to personally thank you for allowing my dad to be a part of these meetings [Music] it sure means a lot to me too to see what the Lord has done and Ron Spencer has done a lot of things in this life and he's taken away every excuse that there can be so I know that you have it in you tonight to go to go the distance and I he's my daddy but I tell you I've never been so proud of him in all my life to watch him here on this stage and how the angel Lord began to move and just put a ring of fire around the man of God and to see a man like Ron Spencer that there's other men like Ron Spencer like brother Tim Pruitt and the ray Harrison brother Wayne Lawson there's so many great men but it was men like these men that fought for our liberties and decided that no matter what the cost they were going to fight for your freedom didn't matter what they what friends they lost they were going to fight for your freedom for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we wouldn't be here without men like these men these men made a way for you to come into this camp and receive a change don't you appreciate these men of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] afraid to preach the entirety of the message and that's what we are gathered here that's the expectation in the room that's why you're here and we're going to change the order of the service now and just go to the word and I know that there are many needs here tonight and I know that we have a prayer line afterwards and I know that the Lord will come down and meet us here as he has done many times but this is where I want you to receive your victory at the preaching of the word because men can lay their hands on you and I'm a full believer in this I'm commissioned to do it but the word is your Firm Foundation when there is no more Camp atmosphere the word will be there for you when these great men that surround you when they're not with you the word will never leave you nor forsake you it is our absolute so with that in mind I I would like for you to if it doesn't make you nervous or feel uncomfortable I would like you to lay your hands over on your brother and your sister right there and I want you to bind with us in prayer tonight and ask the Lord to come in a very specific way Heavenly Father we approach you now father Lord realizing the moment that we are in lordy Jesus it's a moment that you have predestinated father before the foundation of the world Lord we've we've we've stood here before we've stood in this same position we've stood behind this Pulpit father but we've never stood in the place that we're standing in right now father we've read scriptures we've read quotes but father we've never seen them in the light that we're seeing them in right now under the message of the hour father you've given us our Liberty and I pray father tonight that you would just come in abundance father Lord we realize that there's an enemy that's trying to kill and to steal and destroy but you have come to give us life and life more abundantly and father I pray that your Holy Spirit Lord would unwrap these these young ones father tonight they come here with a purpose to meet you father and I'm asking Lord that the mighty Angel would swoop through this building father Lord just begin to open up the scriptures to them to make them see that you're still the Jesus of the Bible father we commit this service into your hand every need every every obstacle that we come come up against father we pray your blessings on this service I pray that you would take me set me behind the corner just for a moment behind the curtain Lord and begin to use the humanity father that I offer to you father Lord I pray that you bind every demonic Spirit father in this place and let the Holy Ghost have its Liberty here according to the word of God we believe these things and we say it is settled and it is so father we pray that you'd have your will in your way in this service tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look into a couple portions of scripture of Luke Chapter 13 Luke Chapter 13 and verse 10 then also to Revelations chapter 5 and verse 1. Hallelujah tonight's going to be a very special night very special tonight your night Luke Chapter 13 and verse 10 and he was and he was teaching and one of the synagogues on the Sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw her he called her to him notice the power of His call and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that Jesus healed on the Sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the Sabbath you see what these rulers are doing they're basically putting limitations on when healing can come the Lord answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the Sabbath Luth loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away for to the watering not not this woman being a daughter of Abraham who Satan hath bound low of these 18 years be loosed from the bond of on this sabbath and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the Glorious things that were done by him also Revelations chapter 5 and verse 1. if you don't know where it's at it's at the very back of the book and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the Throne of the four and Beast and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord by the help of the Lord I'd like to take a thought that he's put on our on our hearts for this this this Camp service here tonight on woman thou art loosed woman thou art loosed and I think we're standing in a very very special spot to recognize that that who we are in the body of Jesus Christ I think it's it's just a wonderful thing how the body of Christ can be gathered together here tonight not have not have any formalities about it not have any ideas of of this one's got to go where that one's got to go but we can sit here under the revealing of the son of man and recognize who we are as the Church of the Living God and I think it's a very powerful thing that that we recognize that that there's not any Shackles on the Church of the Living God there's nothing on this body that that that that cannot be broke off of her but we recognize it that brother Brandon would tell us he said now he said just shake off all the shackles and get loose so that you can really enter into the Shekinah Glory and I think it's a wonderful thing that then when you can lay aside all your weights and lay aside all your ideas and all of your petitions or all of your thoughts that need to happen I I think it's an amazing thing that we recognize where we are we're in a place where God can express his mind and take off all the restraints off the body of Jesus Christ and brother Brandon would say that we're in an astronaut age he said we're living right here in the astronaut age he said and God has achieved what he promised that he was going to achieve in the last days according to Malachi 4 he said the only thing that he has to do is to get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from the airplanes and the Automobiles and whatever more he said and not look back to what it was but more power to lift him higher lift him into the presence of God and lift him up there where all things are possible and I think it's amazing thing when we can recognize that there is there is nothing that is on the body of Jesus Christ that can hold us down but I have found that that no matter what the world offers you young people or whatever Satan kind of puts in your path that it will only bring you down it'll always give you anxiety it'll give you depression it'll give you fear but it's amazing that the Lord Jesus Christ when he gives you anything he don't only Take You Higher and are found in my life that the only satisfying portion in my life is the message of the hour and I have found that the message didn't beat me down it didn't tell me that I was no good it didn't tell me I was a doormat but I found that the message of the hour Has Lifted Me Up into a place to believe that all things are possible and I believe that if we can sit here under the message of the hour and William Brandon would say in recognizing your day in its message he said National Forest put the put the church or put the world cancel churches in the church he said but not National Forest it put Israel back in her Homeland but it's the power of God that puts the people in the body of Jesus Christ it's the power of God that will take you higher here tonight it's not your ideas it's not your Creeds it's not your dog must it's a message of the hour the power of God revealed in this hour it is exactly what Isaiah 58 and 6 is not this the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands upon those that are under the heavy burdens is that not what the message did for you in your life when it found you where you were you were in bondage you were in sin but the message come on somebody the message of the hour set you free from your ideas that you couldn't live any higher this ain't just William branham's message it's my message that is the fast that he has chosen under the Church of the Living God to lose her and to let her be exactly who he is what is it it is the power of the presence of el shadiyah because in your Humanity capacity you're not able to produce what needs to be produced in this hour but if you can ever lean on the breast of el shadiah you can pull the very strength that you don't have right out of the out of el Shady eyes presence and it'll make an old man become a new man a young man and it'll take a young man and make him live a real Christian Life yeah it's powerful presence and that's what William Bannon would tell us in the Feast of the trumpets he said that that the Holy Spirit had been bound by the denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years he said but it's going to be loosed at the evening time by the evening time message so if you want to get loose here tonight if you want to get loose here tonight you've got to believe the message you've got to preach the message it's the message that will untie you it's a message that'll unravel your mind it's a message that'll take the strings off of your life I think it's a very powerful thing that God that God would take and tie up Loose Ends to loose you I think it's a very powerful thing that God could come with all of the complexities of the doctrines of the Bible that men had misconstrued that God comes and takes Malachi 4 and ties them back together so that you could be loose there's not one denomination can stand up to the power of this message the world can't offer you anything like the message can offer you young people Satan offer you criticism say no offer you death Satan offer you a good time but the message will put you in a rapture the message will put you in a Rapture it'll lose you to believe that all things are possible it ain't just for the preachers it ain't just for the deacons it's for this young boy it's for that young girl to believe they don't have to live a homosexual life they don't have to live under bondage woman thou art loosed well it's can't time we'll get meeting tonight camp meeting tonight can't meeting on the old Campground well they knew what I was when they invited me and the reason why we're standing here is because this is not my daddy's Ministry I'm not here because of brother Wayne's Ministry I'm not here for brother Ray's Ministry I am here because this is a son of man Ministry and it doesn't matter how far in sin you've been it doesn't matter where you are this is the ministry of the son of man it's not riding on one man it's riding on this body move of Jesus Christ and you are loose here tonight loose to believe that's what William Brandon would tell us in the message Shalom when he would come there and he would preach a very powerful message on Shalom and what does he do William banham goes back in the Old Testament and grabs Isaiah chapter 60 and says arise and shine for thy light has come but William Brandon would sit there and tell us that we're living in the darkest of days but his message notice what he says he said my message ain't to the church my message ain't to that world out there he said but my message is to that elect lady notice who he is addressing he's addressing the body of Jesus Christ and he's speaking peace over your body notice what he does he tells us that Isaiah 60 tells us arise and shine for thy light has come and gross darkness is upon the people and it's upon the and it's upon the land but notice what it said but the Highlight shall come what is it it's the evening time message that will put you in position so that you can see the miracle that is on your way it's the most chaotic time of Darkness but it's the Most Blessed light that there ever has been I'll say this it's the light that brings the change that's what it is and we recognize where we're standing at as a Church of the Living God as the elect of God we realize that we're facing every devil Out of Hell two hundred thousand thousand demons that have been released out of the river Euphrates you can search it all the way back go back to the Garden of Eden search into Satan's Eden and your watch that there is enmity between the two two seats between the serpent seed and the woman's seed and we watch all the way from the Garden of Eden all the way to Satan's Eden and you watch as the battle continues against this body but God has got a lady that has been hand-picked she's been called of God she's been ordained to live the message now I know I know where we're standing at but too many times people fall victim to certain their circumstance they get under their idea that they've got to live the way that they've got to live what did they do they get under the poison of unbelief that has been sprayed on the gene seed of God ever since the Garden of Eden but you have another repellent that is upon you and it's a repellent of predestination so what Satan's got to offer you will never work against a germicide seed of God now before God is ever going to do anything what does he do he tells us the name is three and seven that he reveals the secrets of it to His prophets and when he reveals it to His prophets what does he do he causes an expectation you see they had there was a testimony in a prophecy that came all the way back there in the Garden of Eden that the woman was going to have a seed so we recognize that the word of God made us look for the manifestation of the woman's seed that's what expectation does it brings you from looking at the word indnecessarily in a word context but it takes you to look for the manifestation of the prophecy that's going to be fulfilled and notice what we did we watched that prophecy as it would work in prophets he would work in Apostles it would work in disciples but yet there had to be one it was one that had to be a virtuous son and he had to be born just right had to come through a virgin birth but we know that it was setting up a kingdom we knew that it was setting up a kingdom that could not fall that could not be shut down that's what the expectation of the prophecy prophet's prophecy will always do it'll make you look for the manifestation of the Holy Ghost now William Brandon would tell us he said now he said if you'd come here and you'd be under great anticipation or a great expectation he said if you come here looking to criticize something he said the devil makes sure that you find something to criticize about it he said but if you come here expecting for God to do something for you God will make sure that you get exactly what you are expecting and I want to tell you I don't believe you came to this Camp expecting to be bound at the end of this camp [Applause] come on now I don't believe your pastor took the same condition that he sent you off with but I happen to believe that you come here under the expectation to be freed and set free to believe that the same works that Jesus Christ did it'll be done in your body and I'll be I'm just the kind of man I'm not going to give up and I'm not going to back up so don't let the devil rob you from your expectations what is it what is it it's an expectation that proves that the prophecy wasn't false prophecy it manifests exactly what the word of the Lord had said that it was going to do exactly like Simeon that had been revealed to him that he would not see death until he seen the Lord's Christ now what was it the Bible tells us that the holy spirit let Simeon down there where Christ was down there and when he saw him when he handled the word of God what did it do he said let your servant be loosed and depart because he recognized the manifestation of the Christ child was a sign for him that he could be loose from the bondage that he was under what was it the Revelation that he had received from the Lord was going to be the one that loosed him Hallelujah that's what William Branham did that's what he came here for he introduced us to a supernatural realm what did he do he awakened our expectations to believe that you can do the same works that Jesus Christ did what did he do it awakened our expectations to operate in the mind of the Lord what is it if you abide in me and my words about and you ask what's your will what did he do he awakened our expectation what does prophecy always do it makes us look to the Future because that's exactly what expectation is it's the daresome to believe that it's going to happen out there in the future but I want to tell you that you are not looking at prophecy you're looking at the reality of the word what William Branham saw as a woman Marching In Step 100 Christian Soldiers she is now dressed in the Garment of the wedding groom that has dressed her according to Malachi 4 and God has taken a dress wear and he is wrapping these young people [Applause] ah come on now you're not going to be dressed in your garments of Robes of dishonesty you're not going to be dressed in your robes of sin and Pleasures you're going to be wrapped up in the message of the hour and when William Branham preaches the marriage of the lamb in 1962 he said this body this bride has the material to dress herself with now notice what you're setting in you're standing in an hour well you're not doing it on your own you're not standing on your own accord but the message the message is wrapping you up with the power of the almighty God you remember when Abraham was having a conversation with Elohim he was talking to him what was he talking to him about he said your seed is going to it's going to sojourn in a Strange Land but what did it do he told him what did the prophecy tell him that you're not going to stay there but you're going to be delivered so what did it do it caused an expectation on the inside of the children of Israel that they could believe that they didn't have to live in bondage no more I'll tell you if you got that kind of Prophecy that makes you live in bondage you need to bury that thing but if you've got a prophecy that'll make you realize that you don't have to be whipped around by the devil you don't have to put up with his ideas you don't have to put up with his chin you don't have to put up with his charges that he's charged against you but you can set there under the inspiration of the prophets prophecy and recognize that Deliverance is on its way what did it do it caused an expectation on the inside of Moses his mother and father of amram and Joseph Ed that they went to believing that God was going to send to deliver they didn't seen 400 years without a deliverer but there was something on the inside of amram that he believed that there was going to come a deliverer I got to studying just a few weeks ago and I got studying about that about where where Joshua bed and amram were up there and brother Brandon said that amram would go up there every single night he'd go up there in his upper room and he'd go praying asking God do you see us down here that's the same way that we have to do God do you see this side of my generation that we're living in God are you looking but ham Ram had something on the inside of him brother Bynum said that Joseph had actually got worried about amram because he'd been out there working all day long he'd been out there under the taskmaster's hand and he was out there building bricks and brother random said that am or Joseph had looked out I said I said amaran look you got to eat you're getting pale you're getting faint you're getting weary but amram would stand there and say no I'm going to pray I'm not giving up on this promise that was given to Our Father Abraham that we're going to go out of here and we're going to be delivered and what did he do he went up there and prayed and he would go up there and pray and he would go up there and pray and he would go up there and pray to you hear what I'm saying to you Deliverance is on its way you believe it because a prophet said that you could go free okay you didn't see receive a prophecy that told you that you're going to have to live in the same condition that your mama lived in but you received a prophecy that said you could go free and amram kept praying and Silas kept praying and Joshua kept praying and this brother kept praying and that sister kept praying and one day amaran got up there and he got to praying and he rubbed his eyes and he seen an angel standing in the corner what did the angel say Deliverance is coming amram it was a sign what was spoken to Abraham what's coming to fruition in the body of Moses and what's been given to the Church of the Living God exactly what William Branham saw complete deliverance don't give up keep pressing keep pressing press the battle press the battle keep praying keep reading keep listening to them tapes I didn't listen to them listen to them again [Applause] brother random would say now look he said he'd say he said now I said I know I'm battling it he said I know I'm battling he said I'm trying to make a footstep he said but before I can make a footstep he said I gotta cut loose of every tangle every green bar and everything else that gets in my way he said but every time you make a step you're advancing forward don't you feel bad when you only take one step don't you feel bad when you only call overcome one time the righteous man can fall but get back up [Applause] if you're taking one foot step you made it into the building didn't you you made it into the building didn't you so the devil didn't have enough to keep you out of this service so we ain't got enough to keep you from your Victory to keep you from your Liberty there's a son of man that is raising the bride's expectation to believe you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the unfailing body word or the son of man it ain't my words it ain't William branham's word it's a message of the angel you remember when William Branham I think it's amazing if you ain't watched it in a while Philip go watch it but you go there and you'll see there when William randomly is standing there in 20th century prophet and you watch him it's amazing to watch he's standing there and the and the angel of the Lord goes to working but notice when he's standing there he's dealing with this one sister and he begins to speak to her he said he said I see you got that that heart trouble there I see you've got that heart trouble there he said he said it's a black curtain a black shadow that keeps following you keeps following you here and there he said oh I see it's a lie oh you feel that it's a lie he said oh it's a lie he said it was a man that was professing Divine Healing and he said you're a witch he said that's nothing but a lie he said don't you pay attention to what them people are saying it's nothing but a lie go on he said it ain't nothing on your heart he said it's just that nervousness from what that man said about you he said you're not a witch you're not here you're not defeated you're not satans you're not Satan's imp you're not Satan seed if the devil told you you weren't good enough oh it's a lie if he told you you wasn't qualified oh it's a lie if he told you he wouldn't make it oh it's a lie what did he do it set that woman free she had been looking for the answer and the answer was standing there behind the pulpit ah the devil chose a bad night to show up in here he's been lying on you he's been robbing from you he's been cheating you out of your inheritance but our Lord Jesus Christ has shown up in the building to take everything that the devil's robbed away from you and give it back to you a hundred percent give me my joy give me my peace give me my Liberty give me my dance give me my worship give me my speaking in tongues everything you got for me God let me loose let me loose to believe what is it would you pay attention what they're saying about you pay attention to what them naysayers are saying about you don't you pay no attention what they say you can and what you cannot do stop making this about you stop making this all my pity party stop sitting there and trying to well why me why me why me stop building and isolating quotes just to prop up your problem [Applause] hell you don't know brother Andrew I've seen in the scripture I seen in the scripture where I'm condemned to where I am flip the page flip the page the scripture that was written for Judas is not for you the scripture that was written for Janice and jambres is not for you who are you representing none other than the deliverer of Christ himself flip the page for the Bible said there is therefore now no condemnation that them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit flip the page Satan back off of me I got I got one of my deacons with me here brother Adam Frazier he's been he'd been a real good buddy to me I grew up with him he's about 10 years younger than me but we grew up together but when he was real little he hated tight places he got real claustrophobic you ever get like that sometimes get like in a service like that get real claustrophobic let me loose give me a whole Elbow Room how you know I don't like it when people get on top [Applause] let's try to start buying the service and try to say and I don't believe all them things I don't believe that those days I believe the days of Miracles are passed well I believe that I believe that those promises are undaught not unto us but I believe it's for another age William Burnham said in the message look he said you people that say that them are for days gone by he said it is for people that from out that are out from underneath the blood he said but if you're underneath the blood the power's still the same the anointing's still the same the Holy Ghost is still the same Deliverance is still the same and he's sitting here tonight the anointing is here to break the Yoke of the individual that has put the bondage on you I don't know if you hear what I'm saying to you Church of the Living God you got the power to set yourself free thank you it ain't just up to me you got the power within you to set yourself free set yourself free from condemnation set yourself free from pornography set yourself free from lust set yourself free from Fear set yourself free from it being ashamed set yourself free from being depressed set yourself free well you say I ain't got much left in me brother Andrew what you got left is enough job had everything taken away from him everything his daughters his sons his family but what he had left was enough what did he say if God slain you got what it takes to live an overcoming life see I ain't got very much left brother Andrew all the woman had left in her house was a little bit of oil but it was enough it was enough it's enough for you and it's enough for you the message is all you need you don't need to be looking on this website or that website look to where your strength comes from young people I know what it's like I know what it's like to live under the bondage of Satan but I know what it's like to be free and if I thought for one moment that you had to stay here bound I wouldn't be here I know I know you can go free [Music] a lot of you don't know my story and I'm not going to take the time to tell it to you but I'm a whole lot worse off I was a whole lot more worse off than a lot of you here but the God that I know has been circling in this tent all week long and he's been looking for you because what you have is exactly what he's looking for what do you have to offer to him give him your life your life peace give him your dreams give him your Ambitions well that's all I got left give it to him watch The Miraculous take place when you take what you think it is enough what happened the lamb is the answer notice when John is standing there in Revelations chapter 5 and he said there was no man found in heaven on Earth that was found worthy no man on Heaven no man in the earth no man beneath the Earth that ever lived and died was found worthy no man was found worthy but the Angels call was for the Kinsmen Redeemer to appear and God said I have a law a kinsman redeemer can be a substitute where is that Kinsmen Redeemer who's able to take it and it come from Adam all the way down through all the proposters and Prophets and everything else and nobody was found now what about that nobody in heaven nobody in the earth nobody that ever lived you see that's the reason that John was weeping because if no one could get that book of title back all of creation was lost everything was lost but our Boaz seen something in you that was worth redeeming when Satan stuck his dirty hands on you God saw something on the inside of you that was worth living out when Satan ensnared you in sin and pornography and depression and anxiety and every fear that comes along with Leon I see a spear our Lord Jesus Christ so that you is worth setting free [Applause] what did Boaz do when he saw Ruth what does Ruth do she said out there under the inspiration of Boaz and she watched when she began to Garner things that she couldn't necessarily go on her own but because moaz Boaz was a mighty man of wealth he had some men that were sitting there he had some Ministry that was dealing with his bride before she ever looked like his bride he was dealing with her be ever before she ever looked like she was in the picture he was dealing with her before she ever got set free from her moabite title he was dealing with her and before you ever felt the inspiration of the Holy Ghost come in this building tonight he's had some men begin to deal with you by the preaching of the message of the hour what are you Ruth I'm telling you to tonight is your night for a title change you will no longer be known as ruthermore about it but you will be known [Music] as Ruth the wife of Boaz but if you get to studying out the Bible you'll find you'll find there in Ruth chapter four and five that there was a nearer Kinsman than Boaz but you remember what Boaz begins to he begins to go out there and he goes into a public place and he stands out there and here comes the near a Kinsmen and that's what William Brandon would say there was a near a Kinsman to us this sin nature that we had upon us there Satan was a nearer Kinsman to him but notice notice what Boaz does he goes out there and he tells him will you redeem Naomi's at land what does the Bible say what does he say he said I will redeem it but Boaz comes behind it he said if you redeem it you've got to also redeem you've got to redeem Naomi and you've got to redeem Ruth as well and you've got to raise up seed unto Ruth unto her dead inheritance and the man that was a near a Kinsman said I can't do it because I I want I will not mourn my inheritance so you see what he was saying I don't have the strength you see what this nearer Kinsman wanted it was the land that he wanted but he didn't want to raise up seed under Ruth what does the devil want he wants your Holy Ghost he wants your power he wants your breakthrough he wants your anointing he wants the Holy Ghost what does he do he wants your land but he's not willing to put his seed on the inside of this woman because he don't have the power to break Ruth's past but this Boaz has the power to breaks Ruth's past and raise up I'll tell you my bowass is so strong he has an abstract title deed he'll Rob everything that the Devils took from you and give it back to you what your mama was what your daddy was you're not just anybody you're an abstract title deed kind of people and you know who you are you know whom you have to believe your bone of his bone life of his life power is power anointing whatever it was anointing my wife [Applause] what does he see about you you got every quality that he's looking for everything about you is speaking this is the choosing of the Bride we didn't really realize who you were until he chose you we didn't really see your virtue until he chose you we didn't really understand what was really on the inside of you until you chose yourself a mate and it showed what the character that you had on the inside of you as a young person or a young girl and it showed the character that was laying there and it shows the kind of character that our Boaz is when he chose you and if my Boaz chose you it means you're worthy it means you're cold it means you're elected it means you're good or not it means that Boaz is not ashamed to put his Jean seed of almighty God on the inside of you well I don't know if we can we knocked John weep not John I can't overcome on my own weak not John I can't live the message weak not John I know a man that can I got a redeemer I got a redeemer I got somebody that thought that I was worth buying back [Applause] stop saying you can't when he can stop saying you want when he will stop trying to give up when God didn't put on anything on the inside of you to give up keep pressing the battle keep pushing forward make one step the lamb was advancing from Calvary to redeem his ridiculous rights and claim them for his own and everything that hadn't been stolen away from Adam he has now returned it to the body of Jesus Christ [Applause] what is it you're loosed I understand where we are in this age that we're living in it don't take very much to look for sin it doesn't take very much for you to take a little time and accidentally get off of the right thing and get on the wrong thing just take any of these individuals that read CNN or Fox News and it don't take long for them to be looking at an innocent website where they can Garner knowledge and be looking at something that is completely wrong so Satan is trying his best to put it in front of you and there is countless times of women and men that keep dealing with the same old devil that entraps him with pornography it's gonna get real sticky here for a minute you know what it's like I'm not gonna call no names but you know what it's like and all of a sudden you get that feeling and you feel like it's the only way that you can achieve what you're looking for and you think oh my that's the only release that I have it's alive from the Devil [Applause] that is not your release that is not your passion that is not what you were built for you were not built for them sites you are not to build to look at them things you are built to look and Release Yourself in the word of God and what the devil had meant for your evil God has turned around and made it good so he can take you and beat the devil down with your testimony God has got some young boys and some young girls that were entrapped by a Slicker and made them do some things wrong but that's not who you are your identity is not in the agenda of Satan your identity is in the word of God yeah you may have failed yeah you may have gotten trapped but get up that's not your name you're not a moabite you're not under them false Idols you're Ruth the wife of Boaz [Applause] raise your character up [Music] I want you to start treating me like an adult brother Angel well act like one this message is here to roll away your reproach it's here to roll away your reproach I know what it's like to be in a presence like we're sitting in right now and I feel every devil in hell trying to rub its rub its dirty skin all over me but I'm here and I didn't come here to lose and I didn't come here to see one of these young boys or these young girls leave here in the same condition that they walked in here what we have is not a conforming message we have a message of transformation you did not come here to meet a new rehab I think it could get some kind of education and some intellectual talk I come here to talk to you about a Boaz that has the power to set you free you're not going back to that you're not going back to that stop stop talking the devil's language you have been quickened by the power of the Holy Ghost set yourself free all right set yourself free when I find my freedom right here in the message right there's a girl that knows what it's like to be free and when God set somebody free he don't ever put them back in bondage no more every devil in hell I want you to Run for Cover right now cause I got you right underneath my Target and I'm getting ready to drop some bombs know who I'm talking to you're not bound you're delivered you're not chained you're set free let loose let your faith loose come out of it come on come on come on well how do I get out of it Paul and Silas began to pray one night [Applause] oh come on now you know what it's like to listen to the voice of the devil but have you ever listened to the voice of almighty God he has never told you that you're going to stay where he found you at he is going to take you higher he's going to give you your Liberty he's going to give you your gift he's going to give you the Holy Ghost stop talking the devil's language and move up a little bit higher in the calling of your shady eyes let yourself draw on him and pull yourself a body that's got strength to overcome strength to live the message strength to do what God said that you would do the worst that I do say you do also and Greater Works than me say how you do because I go into my father and if you ask anything in my name I will do it [Applause] devil you messing with the wrong dude William Branham on time mother Brown will tell us a story about about how he was delivered from his this nervous condition that he had on his life I'm sorry but I didn't fought demons all night long and I'm here under the authority of God's word that sets you free [Applause] sat there and he would tell us that he he was he was going down a dark alley and he said I was just kind of Shadow Boxing and bouncing around going down through there and he said all of a sudden this dog came up out of nowhere and it began to bite at me and brother Brandon said I hollered get away from me dog and he said when I said that he said when I said that that dog turned into a great big giant of a man a spirit rose up out of there he said what did you say to me and brother about him began to apologize he said I'm sorry he said I thought you was a dog and brother Brandon said that that that Spirit he said it looked like a demon he said to begin to back him up into a culvert backed him up into a culvert and he pulled out a knife and said I'm going to kill you but notice brother Madam said now he said he said now well I'm not afraid to die he said because I've already received Jesus Christ and he said when I said that He said Out of Heaven Come whirling a mighty Angel and stood by my side and then he said when I see he said he stood by my side he said that man took off and ran for cover dropped the knife and ran for cover he said the angel was sent for your protection and you might be nervous about this but the angel is here for your protection you might be you must say the Devils of hell that have trapped you in your mind and have trapped you in your sins but the mighty Angel is here he's at the pulpit and he's here to set you free oh but I've suffered so much but we have a redeemer that's what William Branham would say in the seventh seal but the seventh seal was a sign that it was the end of all suffering and you may have suffered for a long time but we've not John we have a redeemer it's over John it's over John what does William Branham do when he comes to Revelation chapter one he said unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood but William Branham Taps into that in the church age book he said that word washed us he said it means loosed us he said the blood has loosed us he said the blood has loosed you from the powers and the bondage of sin he said so if the blood is perfect and loosing he said then the loosing is perfect and the loosing is complete what is it you are loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ you was captive but Christ set you free you were cursed but Jesus Christ made you free and loose you from the Dominion of Satan you were weak but Jesus made you strong we were bound and imprisoned but Christ set us free from slavery we were sick but now we are healed why don't you claim your Liberty why don't you accept your deliverance [Applause] why don't you say Satan you are not my master that's what William Brandon would tell us when they go to read in first John chapter 5 and 4 for whichever is born of God overcometh the world and this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith he said faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise he said that's the victory what is it it's the victory say my arms still crippled but faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is a victory oh it overcomes the world and when you can climb into God by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you're overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room you're selling free then you who have been a drunkard and a slave to Whiskey you'll be a master over him then that Old Devil of alcohol that made you drink he's your master now but when you get that faith [Applause] when you get that kind of faith not a make-belief but a real faith then that devil is your servant then you see you see if Satan's got a hold of you he is holding you by an illegal possession but if we are Jesus [Applause] if we are Jesus then Satan is binding his own master it's getting good in here I hear chains falling FF Bosworth said any believer can be a devil Master overnight you've been ready you've been LED around the circus by that monkey for his power far too long why don't you start taking the chain that he's been jerking on you and jerk him into the fire it's a contest pull that monkey back into the fire that devil ain't nothing but a dog on a leash he can only go so far and you have been built to go all the way not just automobile faith not just horse and buggy Faith but an astronaut Faith to believe that all things are possible you've been loose to worship you've been loose to praise God you've been loose to do it in a dance you've been loose to speaking tongues you've been loose to set yourself free and the power of almighty God is here to make you free hey I've been in chains before but I have found that no matter the condition that I am in if I can just learn to turn my faith loose and begin to praise what did Paul and Silas do they praised they praised their way out of the problem they praised their way out of their complex they praised their way out of pornography they praised their way out of fear they praised their way out of anxiety they praised their way out of them anxiety chains of fear that was rolling over top of him what did they do they begin to sing about the Midnight Hour and the evening time begin to shine upon them and they begin to pray and they begin to praise and they begin to sing Psalms what do you got to do young people you got to thank God for what he's going to do for you before you ever see it done and when they begin to sing change begin to fall and all the bands were loosed oh you don't know what you're doing in here but there's some people behind you that are watching you that came here to this camp with you and saw the bondage that you were in when you came here and they see you working to get yourself free and it's encouraging them behind you that they can go free too Lily it's going to be a good night he gonna be a good night in this place he gonna be a good night in this place it's gonna be a good night in this place because our Lord Jesus Christ has come all the way from glory and the pillar of fire has been circling around this room to make sure that you don't go back to the hell hole you came out of he's come here with a purpose tonight to set you free ah with Jesus so this woman he was teaching in the synagogue and he saw her bound for 18 years what does he do he addresses her by her gender a woman he immediately identifies her heritage this daughter of Abraham hath been bound by this devil for 18 years living with the same thing living with the same thing brother Andrew you don't know where I am I'm the only one in my youth group I'm the only one in my family that believes Bound for 18 years but you don't know who's in the room he's talking to you he's called you by who you are woman you're the body of Jesus Christ you wear your crown with dignity and you've been looking at your problems completely wrong this demon had bound her so much that the only thing that she could see was defeat change everybody else all she could see was other people dancing in the spirit all she could see was other people getting their Victory all she could see was other people and you see when you when you get in this kind of condition a lot of things you can be told by people's shoes you begin to look at their shoes and you begin to I see I they've got that's that person knows what it's like to have a nice home and live in Victory and that person must really know what it's like to have an overcoming life you see you can learn a lot by looking and walking in somebody else's shoes but when Jesus begins to talk to her he doesn't draw her attention lower he draws her attention to another Realm a realm that she hasn't experienced around that she hasn't noticed that it was for her she only recognized it was for others but when Jesus gets done with this woman she does not recognize herself as a denomination that has to live and change anymore she recognizes that he has taken her faith to see that he was her victory what does he do he takes her vision and turns it towards him what does this message do it turns you away from your problems it turns you away it turns you away from your fear look up look up your redemption's in the room [Applause] I got five Kings here I got five Kings right here I Got King Pride I Got King pornography I Got King anxiety I Got King homosexuality and I Got King fear now I know what the Bible says in Joshua chapter 10 that they came in there and they took him out of the cave that they found them in and they smote them and killed them and hung them up there on all their trees so let's take pride let's take pornography let's take fear let's take complexes let's take anxiety they was hiding in that cave they were holding you bound they were holding you in that cave what are you gonna do with them put them back in the same cave roll the stone back over the cave roll them back over there and the Bible said that they took great stones and rolled them back in their place and they're still there don't you get to digging up them old bones don't you get to digging up them Stones they're still there fear still there depression's still there anxiety still there leave it under the blood [Applause] who miracles in the room I can't tell you how many times I've seen miracles from behind this pulpit foreign but nothing is impossible to them that believe [Music] Bethany in here my sister Bethany I ain't got my glasses on guys y'all gonna have to help me out not that sister Bethany that's my other sister Bethany Bethany Hatfield I'm talking about The Real McCoy they both sitting right there praise the Lord hitting nice knowing you too but in this room Miracles take place I watched this boy right here I watch this boy right here be so led by the Holy Spirit and there's a lot of people that make fun of dancing and say we shouldn't do it no more but this is one guy that I have seen the spirit of the Lord take him and use him in a dance when I watched at that that platform when there were people slain in the spirit all over there and the spirit of the Lord work over this boy and completely dance around every single one of them with his eyes closed so don't tell me God doesn't work in a dance no more but last year in this camp in this Camp there was a vision shown that there was going to be a lady that would bring forth a son and it would be in this camp that they would dedicate this son and I come all the way back with this message the Bethany that this son is a sign that your approach is rolled away this lady this lady was covered up with more problems with more things on her that were so heavy that she couldn't lift up on her own but my Lord Jesus saw her he saw her when it was more than she could bear and he's a Bethany I am your deliverance oh it's a lie it was in this camp that God saw you and he said I'm coming to your house tonight and you didn't know what it meant but he came and so filled your daughter for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God would do a supernatural event for True Word Tabernacle that God would raise up a little girl that Satan has done his very best to destroy and to keep her in her bondage and keep her in her fear that even though she feels it and even though it's there she still raises her hands she refuses to listen to The Devil's lie she refuses Satan I want you to hear me I resent your coming I refuse for you to hold these children any longer they are not your subjects they are Almighty God's subjects and tonight is your night where you lose them once and for all you're not going to stay in your bondage and you're not going to stay in your sin what happened to you back there when nobody when you didn't know it he was already there [Applause] and I took you to college and it may have put you in a hell hole and it may have put you in a trap and you didn't think he was going to get your way out of it but the blood of Jesus Christ put a robe around you he protected you when you were when you were sorry I'm sorry but when you are most vulnerable the blood protected you and my Lord Jesus has World in this building and you're in a vulnerable spot you're in your condition but I want to testify I want to testify you're not leaving here the same way you walked in here it was in this Camp last year that my my Lord Jesus Christ came and talked to my sweet wife and told her that she was going to experience the Lord in a new way I watched my wife before she was my wife received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was one of the most powerful things I ever got to see and I think it's amazing that God would allow me to watch a girl that wouldn't hardly give me the time of day get filled with the Holy Ghost it's one of the sweetest things that I've treasured in my life but the Lord revealed something to me in this camp that God was going to allow her to experience the Lord in a new way and I thought it was going to happen at this Camp I I really did but a week later there was a man that came to our Labor Day meetings by the name of Tim Pruitt and preached on investigating angels that the angel has came and investigated our faith man you talking about a supernatural meeting we got to drive him back home and the spirit of the Lord got in our car I jumped out of the car when I got to my driveway started speaking in tongues and rolling around in the grass and then all of a sudden the Lord began to move and he said Katie this is it this is a girl that's very sensitive to the presence of the Lord very sensitive but all of a sudden there came an angel whirling through that car she busted out of that car started dancing and speaking in tongues and brother Tim Pruitt that night had read from Genesis Chapter 18 where Abraham met Elohim underneath an oak and when my wife brother Wayne got done rolling around that grass she was underneath an oak tree I want you to know that the spirit of the Living God that dealt with me last year has dealt with me again and told me to tell you that tonight is a very special night what you have never experienced in the Holy Ghost tonight you will experience I don't care what you try to limit I don't care what you try to do there is no limitations you can put on my God [Applause] [Music] last week I was up in Cloverdale a pair of brother bicycle's camp and I as I was preaching the spirit of the Lord moved over top of me and I said today there's going to be a miracle and I'll I honestly wanted to put my hand over my mouth because I thought oh Lord what's going on here but it wasn't me that said it I don't have the time to tell you tonight a miracle after Miracle after Miracle after miracle that happened in that place where the spirit of the Living God began to operate in there and people that were under bondage of skin conditions people that were under the bondage of demonic Powers were set free people that had been away from God for a very long time people that had been under bondage of marriage problems were set free because there was a prophecy that was told that America was going to happen and tonight your miracles in the room there you go now we're getting ready to go to this prayer line and I want you to come here under great anticipation my brother Madam would say I don't want you to hear me woman you are loosed you're loosed that means you're untied that means you're not bound that means every chain that has been upon you is often amen Satan thou demon powers of hell that's bound these Christian people in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God come out of them and turn them loose and let them go Satan turned them loose come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ let this audience of people go for the glory of God turn them loose Satan we adjour thee by the presence of Jesus Christ The Living one the resurrected Son of God leave them and go come out of them for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ every person present that feels the Jesus Christ has kept his word out that he's here and he's come in our presence in the midst and he's here because he's promised to be here he's here and identified himself he's the same Lord Jesus that walked into Galilee and you believe he can he keeps all of his word and because somebody a Believer identified himself of You by laying hands upon you to identify himself with the word of God that you are now healed and you resent Satan holding you any longer your faith goes loose to believe that God is here to keep his word stand on your feet and accept your healing all that believe rise up to your feet blessed be the name of the Lord raise up your hands and praise him you are healed in the name of Jesus Christ Satan in the name of Jesus Christ turn them loose and let them go in Jesus Christ's name I command the devil of unbelief to depart from this building keep your hands on one another prayer of faith shall save the sick God shall raise them up hold your hands on one another keep praying keep shutting with God it'll be all right oh shut in with God no uncertain sound that voice it's telling you that that voice that is talking to you is God it is not an uncertain sound you Pentecostal people ought to know that the voice of the Holy Ghost is no uncertain sound that's his virtue coming into you believe it have faith in God don't you doubt it don't doubt it break that spell of unbelief from around you let the Holy Ghost take possession now I know you'll come here with real needs and the words already told you who you are but now will you believe the Bible said to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it doesn't matter when it happens they shall recover these men of God that will stand here in this line it'll be like you walking under the Ark of the Covenant as their hands are laid upon you you are walking under the Blessed word of God that men that you're not approaching just men these are men that are under a Priestly order they cast out demons and they have to go but I want to be real serious with you here if you are in bondage and you love being in bondage learn to hate it because if you don't hate it you're going to leave here the same way you walk in here I have the power to cast those demons off of you but you got to keep them off of you hate that thing hate that pornography devil hate that lesbian Spirit hate that homosexual Spirit hate that lust devil hate that problem hate that Pride hate that anxiety hate that fear if you come in here with that kind of if you come in here with that kind of hate against the devil that has robbed you over and over and over and over again if you come in there with that kind of hatred against that devil you will leave here completely free until you learn to hate it you'll learn to live with it all your life but if you hate it whom the sun is set free it's free indeed and the Bible would tell us to stand fast in our Liberty where Christ has made us free and the Bible said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the Flesh and who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies it is God that called it is God that made you clean so you do me a favor hate the demon that's been chasing you back and forth but today you take a step forward to never go back to it again how many Believers we have here tonight William Brandon I would say now you know I'm waiting on something [Music] you know I'm waiting on something I'm helpless without him I'm hopeless without him
