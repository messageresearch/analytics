Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to turn to the book of Ephesians the first chapter and if we could the seventh verse Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 7 um I'm I'm still in this F Visions I'll be in this a while I'm not sure that I'll take every service in in it but uh it's just um there's some things here that are very uh close and I I didn't even start to cover on Sunday morning and just uh thought if God be merciful we would just continue that tonight um Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 7 amen I want to read here uh in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace in whom we have Redemption through his blood brother R said now notice the book of Ephesians is not to everyone it's to the believer so he's saying that we have been redeemed Believers now sealed into the body the Redemption was by the blood but by the same blood there is the Forgiveness of sins and brother Braham said now remember this is to the believer so he's talking about after your a Christian amen we want to ask the Lord to bless his word tonight as you could be seated I want to take this tonight and uh I think they said it was part five I do want to uh just give it a subtitle if we can put it on there amen um confess sins dropped into the blood confess sins dropped into the blood so our subject tonight you know is going to be speaking on confessed sins dropped into the blood in the book of Isaiah the first chapter the 18th verse brother Bram gives us a tremendous uh uh insight into this scripture and he he speaks on it many times s uh brother Bram yes from the book of Isaiah the first chapter 18th verse Isaiah uh speaking for the Lord here come now and let us reason together saith the Lord for though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool brother Braham uses this for the subject of conference many times he speaks upon it and uses this for confence conference and and brother brand been speaking about conference is he says something very powerful here in 1960 uh it's in June there in the message having conferences and brother B says something really I just loved how he said it he said now what a conference means he says it's moving the opposition what conference means it means moving the opposition then you can have a healing Services when you get the Thomases out you get the doubters out all these other things all the formals out the Fig leaves all come off and strip them down to the skin and cover them with the blood then their sons and daughters of God removing the oppositions uh brother Bram is teaching us now amen and and you can go through uh these sermons and they're very powerful but he says something here all the Fig leaves off and strip them down to the skin then cover them with the blood amen and if you go back to the message of uh of conferences you'll find it's a a it's a powerful subject brother B beginning was saying he's living in a time where a lot of conferences has happened back in the 40s and 50s you went through the world wars and the world was entering into conferences and and they had started uh joining together because there had been times of opposition there have been great troubles and states of emergencies he said so they needed to sit down and talk things through he said and and and he said now there's not a greater conference in the world than the one that God calls you to so if man would have a reason to call somebody to a conference only when there's a need to he said but then God would call a man to a conference and then in that conference he would he would say let's discuss the problem of your life let's discuss the issues he said that that your sins shall be white as snow now I don't know about you but I never want to miss that conference amen that when God is going to take your oppositions and remove them whatever the situations or the sins or the the problems in your life so he's talking about the kind of conference that when he's finished with you there will be no opposition between you and God there will be no opposing of the spirit of God now the brother bam uh lays out his Eden conference and it's a it's a beautiful story and I'll not go through all of them but I thought this one was amazing because he goes through the Eden conference when God had created his own son and he had put him in Perfection both Adam and Eve was laying there in Perfection but that's When sin came in and and remember now when sin came into the garden of Eden and it took Eve and then Eve brought sin unto Adam now there was a judgment that had said the day that you eat you shall surely die now God could not change his word and God then had to had bring judgment upon them but look at the look at the grace of God when he heard how it must have been and you know brother B puts it in drama how it must have been when it word reached God that his children had sinned and were going to have to die brother Bram says it see it was such a a state of emergency he said he didn't send some angels down there he didn't send somebody to go look for them say hey go get my children and go do this but he said but God himself went looking for Adam and Eve he said he went he went down through the rolls of Eden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou and right there in that single text Brother Braham said represents every man he said when man sins he runs from God but it's only God that searches for man see man immediately hides man it's the it's the Instinct of man I've done something wrong I'm going to get out of the presence of God I'm going to hide myself but God he says he's the one that came looking for you and that's why brother Bram said you never saved yourself and you never came looking for God he said but on the contrary God was the one that was looking for you and searched you and you said well it was me that went to that church and I was the one that got to the Altar and I was the one that yes but it was God that put it in your heart to do that unless God would do it the Bible said the goodness of God leadth under repentance is that right so it was God that did that and he went hunting Adam crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou because it was his son and he was interested in preserving his son brother R said the same thing tonight that the spirit of God is going up and down the aisles of the church crying for his lost children if something has happened or some situation has gotten in the way he said see God's not just going to leave that there but he's going to come and cry because God is actually interested in us now brother R said he said when he found Adam Adam was scared to come in his presence I just love how he says things he said he said Adam Adam Where Art Thou and he said I'm hiding in a bush I'm afraid to come out we're naked and brother R said God said who told you you were naked and remember he said then they said come here I want to talk to to you I want to have a conference with you and he said Adam cried back said Lord I don't have anything to wear I don't have anything to wear to a conference with you I'm I I don't have an appropriate clothing and he said that's when God took and killed a couple of lambs and took their skins and threw them in the bush he said put them on come out and talk to me can you imagine God providing them something that was even in a symbol that man could stand in the presence of God if you've ever read of Isaiah when he saw the the great sheriffs that stand in the presence of God the Bible said with two Wings they covered their feet and with two Wings they covered their eye brother man said he said Angels who had never sinned can not even look into the presence of God he said because he is such a holy God and here is a man that has had sin and he's looking at a holy God but God said I will provide a way amen that the man could stand again in the presence of God if you'll put this on you can come into my presence and we can talk about the issues and we can cause a remedy brother Ram said it was in that Ed conference when God decided how he would deal with man he said the first thing he had to do was strip the Fig Leaf from him you got to study and or you had to take note of fig Leaf cuz brother bram's going to use that all the way throughout his ministry fig Leaf religion or fig Leaf idea or fig Leaf way and brother R said I want you to know the Fig Leaf Way won't work he said so the first thing God had to do was strip that from him to replace it with a covering that would work see if God wasn't interested in our in our coming to him if God wasn't interested in us then God wouldn't have provide something for us to wear to come to the but God is so interested that he won't let us stay under a fig Leaf he's so interested he won't let us stay under our unbelief or our troubles but God so wants to have fellowship with us that he provides something for us that we might stand in his presence and by his grace so in the Eden conference there was a there was a um there was a a judgment went out or a how could I say it you know whenever now they're trying to swear in judges and especially the federal judges they they always ask them you know about abortion or they ask him about some they always ask him about some major issue uh uh that they feel that is important and and every one of those judges always say well I have an opinion but I'll stay with the law and I'll stay with the the preeminence of the law there's a word I'm looking for and it's left my mind tell me the word right quick it's when a judgment's made and then the and presidents of it thank you brother amen the presidence of a decision then it you don't have to try every case from then on Amen when it one you know when a case is tried and then that case goes to Supreme Court it's a president over and that's settled so God tried the case in Eden and said only the blood would work so we don't have to have another trial or another decision that is the result of decision of having a conference only the blood's going to work and and we find out this is exactly why that Jesus himself had to come down in human flesh because it wasn't just an angel it wasn't just a son it was God himself that would come to mankind because he was interested do you remember the other day we quoted to you uh from the burning bush conference brother Ram was talking about Moses he said when Moses had got see he went down and he tried to do something for the Lord but he but he done it on his own abilities and then he failed and the Egyptians run him out remember amen they run him out they they it's amazing if you get to looking at it he didn't appropriately cover the Egyptian did he he just buried it a little bit but it come up to him the next day so proven that you can't bury nothing it's always going to come right back to you and that's what drove it's what drove Moses out and when Moses was drove out on the back side of the desert brother Braham said he'd been there so long he lost the burden of the word and had forgotten the promise of Deliverance but when he went to the burning bush the Bible said I am come down to deliver the children of Israel and I have remembered my promise brother BR said then somebody was still interested in the children of God it was God that was interested and God is still interested in the children of God he's interested in your healings he's interested in your deliverance and that's the reason he came down himself and that's the reason he promised in the end time that a mighty Angel would descend from heaven with the shout and he would realign us with the truths of the atonement and the blood and the Forgiveness of sins because God didn't want to leave his bride under a figleaf religion of denominational forgiveness where you amen just lived your life under condemnation of sin and never really getting a victory but the message of the hour brought a total Deliverance back to the church and we don't have to live like denominational Christians we don't have to live like Sinners of the world but there was a promise of God that came upon the the church that the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be restored to the church and and a complete remission of sins under the power of the blood yes sir I'm the of the blood God is interested in you and he's not just interested in our adults he's interested in our children and in this age that we're living I God God help our kids amen what an age to try to live above sin but God made a promise you'd be able to he said I promise unto your children and your children's children and as many as the Lord Our God shall call that the baptism of the Holy Ghost could come upon the church and there would be something between you and God it would be something between you and God but it wouldn't be sin between you and God it would be the power of the blood atonement between you and God I'll tell you the only thing between the church and God tonight is one intercessor or mediator and that is the man Christ Jesus amen I say this tonight I believe I believe that God brought them uh a conference because he was interested and he's interested tonight and he was interested when they got to the Red Sea he was just as interested in his children when they met the opposition of the Red Sea as he was when he called them out listen God ain't brought us out to leave us he didn't bring us this far just to turn around and leave us he didn't bring you this far to say okay you're having now I'm just going to leave you in your trouble not the God I serve you come to church on a Thursday night maybe there's something going on in your life the kind of God I'm serving you might try to hide that but the god that we're serving will walk the aisles of the church and he'll call your name and you'll say deal with this child deal with this child get out from behind the Fig leaf and come out under the blood that you can have fellowship and have joy come on you're going to be in church anyhow you might as well live in Victory you're going to live this way anyhow you might as well live in Victory how long has Satan kept you under condemnation where you can't live like you really want to live but you can't go in the world cuz you know better so you're living between two things and you're not really getting the kind of Victory you really want but there's a promise of victory for every believer in this building tonight you can live so high in God until sin has been put under the blood yes I believe in it tonight I believe in the oldfashioned power the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it'll change your life every service every day amen because it's still the atoning power of Jesus Christ I believe it I believe that when they got to that Red Sea brother bandam teaches us a great story there he said that's when they had another conference yeah what we going to do with this opposition brother B said there it was the children of Israel was at the blood and there enemies couldn't cross over is that right that's when God turns Redemption into justification amen that's when he turns Redemption into justification now your enemy can follow you to the blood but that's as far as it can go your enemy can follow you to church are you hearing me your enemy can follow you to town your enemy can follow your home but he can't follow you through the blood and God was showing that Israel had left Egypt but Egypt had left Israel it was chasing them but God LED them to a place that would represent the blood of Jesus Christ and there would be a way for the redeemed to cross over and they could cross over in safety but when they got to the other side my the Bible tells us that God knocked the chariot wheels all of the Egyptians and they got stuck in the mud amen that's what happens when the devil tries to follow the children of Israel he gets stuck in the mud and I got news for that devil tonight and there's a God that'll knocked up wheels off of your Chariot and he'll stick you in the mud and the power of God will swallow that devil up do you see what happened can you imagine when the amen now there's an entire song written there in the book of Exodus I think it's Exodus 15th chapter they say it's the oldest recorded uh song that has been written amen so it was a new song at that time the Bible says that that song will be singing in heaven can you imagine amen when they break that one out amen the song that the Angels can't sing amen Moses to stand up and lead the course everybody El say Moses wrote that he wrote it in a contemporary Time come on it was F it was absolutely contemporary and and I'm not for rock and roll music but things that are written contemporary don't mean they're wrong folks every song you sing was new at some time come on and when them Pentecostal were singing there's going to be a meeting in the air the Lutheran thought they had lost their fanatical minds but it was contemporary because they had went from justification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they had something to sing about well listen brother if you ever come across the Red Sea and you ever seen your enemy dead in the sea of the blood and you know he can never get up and haunt you anymore yeah you would sing You' sing like you never sung before and Moses sanging the spirit and Miram got a tambourine and they danced on the on the W oh God on the banks of the Red Sea about to come in half I'm sorry amen they about danced on the Red Sea and the Bible tells us that the daughters of Israel picked up their tambourines and they danced with her Moses never stopped the dancing party Moses sang in the spirit while they danced in the spirit and played their tambourines I think sometimes we need a tambourine service we need a dancing service we need a holy ghost remembering service that our sins are are dead and they're hid in the blood and they can never come back upon us again I tell you when Moses said it these Egyptians you see today you'll see no more forever I'm talking about a God that can destroy your Egyptians well if our God can destroy our Egyptians why can't we dance about it and tell the devil I got the victory in the name of Jesus Christ I am a Victorious child Hallelujah I'm not a beaten down drummed out man amen I'm a man that knows the God that I serve well glory be to God they was buried in the blood and Redemption turned to justification cuz it didn't exist anymore now the Bible tells us that we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God so we're all on the same place tonight you know thing I like about the cross it's level ground the Low Places are made High and the high places are made low amen and the and the curves are made straight that's the cross brings every man to the same place good brother sure now you can teach the word and that's a good part of the that's a good part but ever preach on character a little while you going to have to get your altar out cuz when we quit comparing one with the other and compare ourselves with the stature of the perfect man we'll all find out we need Jesus we'll all find out we need Jesus is that right amen so it's level ground at the cross we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare righteousness for the remission of sins that are pass through the forbearance of God listen to that he to declare righteousness now I don't have time to preach all night but amen there's something powerful about declared righteousness folks Isaiah said our righteousness is as filthy rra and the Bible said that Israel was binded unto the righteousness of God but the elect have obtained it we have obtained righteousness not by our own abilities not of good things that we've done the Bible said not he that willth though he that run but is God that show the mercy to our lives then somebody declared us righteous it wasn't us saying we're righteous it's not our abilities there has been a declaration over your life that the blood of Jesus made you righteous before almighty God woo think about it tonight if you're not enjoying the the victory of the blood then you are living beneath the Privileges of your of your inheritance that God has made for you as a Believer our justification in Romans 5 said therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I love that don't you amen invisible Union brother B declares there's a difference forgiven and Justified it don't mean forgiven you you know the story if IID got out and done some evil thing and you come around you found out I didn't do them and you come around said brother R I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it at the first place amen now if I did it I'm guilty and you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it but the word Justified is though you've never done it you ever you ever took it out just if I'd you said it all together justify it but slow it down just if I'd never done it in the first place see it's not forgetfulness see it's it's in the book of God's how's now watch how's it done it's in the book of the sea of forgetfulness see see now your old book of marriage and divorce is dead it's not even in the memories of God you're Justified amen therefore being justified it was accused you was accused but you've never done it in the first place right now we'd have to have a week to teach on that first place remember the glory which I had before the world began the Eternal thought substance the first place that that wasn't done in the first place see then you was accused but you never done it in the first place so the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to begin with the bridegroom bore your shame himself for in your place he took your place for you were predestinated him to be the bride before the foundation of the world you are the predestinated seed amen now now it's amazing because brother bam is going to take this and it's amazing how he lays out being put in the sea of forgetfulness I actually uh I actually was reading a book with uh with Eevee this morning and and and it it is struck me kind of was funny maybe it's late last night but it couldn't have been late I was B about 9:30 so amen but I I was reading to her it's happening amen but uh but I I was reading a book to her and and as I was reading it there it was a little bunny it's pretty funny it's a little bunny and it was talking to its mom and it was talking about how much he loved me and when the bunny said I love you this much and stretched out both hands well being a preacher I mean the minute I read that I got to thinking about the cross and how much he he loved me this much you know I'm reading about a bunny and I'm thinking about Calvary he Le loves you this much and when I thought about that I thought in that moment I thought yeah now I know how that old fell felt and brother BR said you know remember the girl had her Grandpa or her dad and said he was a little bit of a Pentecostal get get excited and things and she was a little more on the social side and she got embarrassed about him said when she had everybody over she just locked him in the attic and took his Bible away from him cuz he amen she gave him an old science book or a geography book or something so you know give him something to do but don't need him shouting he got up there and this the story said brother B said it like this said they was drinking their tea and things down there and said they got to hearing an awful commotion and the dust falling out of the ceiling hear somebody up there hauling and dancing and jumping and shouting after a while she pulled the cord and looked up there and said dad what are you doing up there he said well he said I'm awfully excited she said well you all you got a geography book what you excited about said well I was reading here about the oceans of the world yeah and I was reading some of them are so deep they never found the bottom am and she said what difference does that make he said but the scripture says that God cast our sins in the depths of the sea and he said I got to thinking that our sins are still going and there's not a bottom so nobody will ever find it he said I got to think about got are carried away well I tell you if that really ever strikes a heart of a Believer to really know that if you ever confess a sin before God and it goes in the sea of forgetfulness and it's still going tonight there's no bottom to it you'll never find it Hallelujah it'll even read an old geography book you'll get excited because it's it's a time do you see it's a time to understand the depths of the Blood Brother BR said a Christian Life absolutely centered in lives sometimes holds many disappointments he said disappointments see they hold many disappointments seem like it would be that way but it's God's way of doing things but let us hit the river to see what we'll do now see there's the thing sometimes we come up to situations sometimes there's battles that there's sometimes the battles that come upon people now I'm I'm going to going to say that I I believe I got to come back to this but I I I've got to say that what I believe is I believe the church is Justified and I believe the blood cleanses the church remember the blood of Jesus Christ takes sin so far from you until it's not even in the remembrance of God at all Lord now sin the blood stands between God and me I've accepted it I'm a sinner but he's God and the chemistry stands between me the kill of sin so God sees me as white as the water that's in the bleach sin is gone and it can't reach him because there's a sacrifice laying there right I tell you some of these some of these quotes are very powerful We Stand justified in the presence of God as a drop of ink a tub of bleach you'll never find the stain of Ink No More see it never come back again when a man is truly redeemed Redemption through the blood when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished amen it's gone it's dropped into the ink Hallelujah do you see what it is amen when God allows that to drop in there so so you know it would seem like to me that if a person was Redeemed by the blood that'd be the end of it but Paul says there is a forgiveness of sins isn't that powerful there is a forgiveness of sins and brother man says that is not to The Sinner he said he can't sin he's a sinner his whole life is sin he said it's like you take a a book and he said the whole book is black he said put a black spot on it you can't find the spot the whole thing's black amen but if you could change the cover from black to white and then put a spot on it you could see it and so is it with the Church of the Living God if you put them in the bleach of the blood they're wide all together but then let them do a little something that's not right little something maybe they thought wrong said wrong acted wrong now then there has got to be something to deal with that than you Lord Jesus God is so interested in his children he would not just leave you in that estate Lord God wouldn't just leave a person let's you got a little something that happened or something that come up in your life and you're sitting there wondering God what am I to do about this God is so interested in you Hallelujah that he would never leave you in that place but he would provide a way to put you back with the blood as purpose in your heart now now I can can I can I can I remind you the book of Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua yes sir amen so the Old Testament Joshua is the book of Ephesians of the New Testament and Paul is walking us through our predestination and brother bam says watch now those mothers had already spoke their names in Genesis 30 hundreds of years later they're coming into their land so everything they needed to possess the lamb was already there and you would think nothing could get in the way of people like this but now they went to the Battle of Jericho is a powerful battle remember it and in the Battle of Jericho God says to them listen you destroy everything in this city and it's an accurs C now this is amazing because in the Scripture it tells us that there are many battles that the children of Israel took the spoil of the battle and divided it among themselves which was it was a common occurrence to take the to take the Bounty of of a battle and divide it among themselves but in this battle he said everything in that City's cursed don't touch none of it remember only leave Rahab alive because of a promise everything else is a curse and then he turned around and said and don't build this city again and anybody that does is cursed yeah and if you read the Scripture it actually comes later remember that the Kings of Israel rebuild the city and there's a first laying on every king after that the whole line of Ahab but you got you got to see that God Amen brought them in a great battle and they were so victorious in their battle the shout amen of the king that came because of the seven trumpets sounding together and the walls of Jericho fell and they left and they left with such rry and such Victory amen knowing they were in position knowing they were to possess this but they start going up and then here they come to the next battle you won that great battle everything's going good and they come up to the next battle and it was called the Battle of a how many you ever read about it it's just AI I guess we uh amen it's the Battle of a but when they got ready to come to that battle they actually went back and said I such a small number don't bring the whole Army and it's no sweat man we'll have this done before noon you know and they take a battle they go up to defeat here in this land and the Bible says I think there was 36 men died in the Battle and the Bible said that the children of Israel ran from the battle they turned their back and ran from the battle they lost their Courage the Bible said they had like it was water they ran like water Amen in other words they lost all their courage in the face of the enemy now why did that happen y'all remember brother M is paralleling now the New Testament Church with the Book of Joshua and he comes up and he said there it is it was in the walk he said because God had commanded them to go a certain way he said now they had begin to lose battles he said and they couldn't face their enemy so they had to ask themselves why can we not face this enemy he said so they started fasting and praying in a little while they come around and God begin to reveal Ain remember it and when achen was revealed it was them that he went down Amen to the scripture he went down to ain's house and the Bible said he began to talk to him he said hey look confess it man just confess it now what did he want to do he wanted to confess the sin now watch this why does he use this confession why did Joshua the type of the Holy Ghost ask that confession out of aen because what was going on in ain's life was stopping the victory of the rest of the camp of Israel so God needed to deal with this sin now if you want to take the name aen the a Ain actually means trouble yeah amen isn't that amazing you can't make that up amen the guy's name meant trouble I I I can't help to think about it who who seen a nice little baby boy born and said let's name him trouble but he was living up to his name because he decided to take something that was a curse and the Bible said they found it in his tent a wedge of Babylonian gold and silver was buried beneath it and brother brand immediately takes it to worldism in the church he said the sisters cutting on their hair and he said wearing makeup and things like that he said here we are the Church of God the camp of Israel he said should never be named Among Us y'all read it y'all you've heard the brother bam uh in the message of he cares do you care he goes deep into this area and when he does he shows that when God found the problem in Israel the trouble in Israel was aching come on now we can look at it as a church tonight we could say well amen my own life then matters to others what I do come on church amen if we're going to face sicknesses boldly if we're going to face troubles boldly then we've got to come together as a body amen but God is so interested in the body that he wouldn't allow something to remain Among Us without saying to us bring it to the blood bring it to the blood bring it to the blood and look what he's going to do now God he names out this trouble aen and then they do something with him they take him over to this Valley now look what they do the scripture said they take him and his cattle his family everything it sounds sounds pretty sounds pretty amazing it sounds terrible but but you got to see the type yes sir that they took that and put it in the valley the Bible said they stoned them and burned them with fire and when it was burned with fire it was completely gone they covered it up with rocks as a memorial and then they returned to the battle now look after this after they return to the battle they go back to the same battle they had just lost and now they completely overcame it now what's that telling the Church of the Living God that God was interested in your victory of a and the thing that troubled you he showed you confess sin dropped into the blood will restore the victory back in the Church of the Living God listen I'm not just talking to us as a body but what about as an individual when you were so Victorious and so powerful and your joy was so great but what troubles you tonight listen think of this what troubles you what is it that's took your boldness away from you what took your stand away from you when you could stand in the face of every adversity and know your soul was right with God you didn't have to back up you didn't have to worry you could shout in any service you could Amen to any sermon because victory was in your life Joy was in your life but some devil come and stole it away and God is saying you don't don't have to stay there you don't have to remain there the trouble in Israel and the trouble in our own personal walks confess sin drops into the blood you remember our story on Redemption I think it's a powerful story on Redemption one of the great stories of redemption was Hosea taking Gomer as a wife just preached on his Sunday a bit and if you like to if you're a Bible reader it was a prophet he's married a Harlot and she's going back into hardam whoredom and and when she moves back into that do you think that man just left that do you think he just said hey you can go back you can stay we'll just not deal with it you you you can just stay where you are no amen that was his wife so he wanted to restore her back to that place if you read Hosea the 2 chapter it's a beautiful read but the first half of it is total judgment Hosea the 2 chapter the first first half is just judgment stacked up on judgment but then about the 14th verse there's a complete change and he says but therefore he says I will Allure You Into the Wilderness now you you if you have time you can go through it in the message some of you preachers will really enjoy the study but the allurement is the attraction right God attracted Moses god attracting a bride God attracting the eagle amen look she was in the place of sin but God attracted her and and Hosea attracted her and look at what he said he said I will give you the valley of acre for a Door of Hope the first time I ever read that what a valley of acor you might be asking that right now what's the valley of acor well if you back up and read it that's the valley they put Ain in the valley of acor was the place they buried achen and his family and now hundreds of years later a prophet is using this as a hope unto a woman that's so far out she can never come back but God said right there in that Valley I'm showing you that I can take you from a defeat back to a victory again I can move you from utter failure back to Victory again I'll tell you what you you know what you know it's amazing you can't make this stuff up the valley of acor is titled the valley of trouble the valley of trouble that's where God put put Israel's trouble that's where Hosea could put goomer's trouble there's another Valley amen of trouble it's the blood of Jesus Christ wherever sin could be dropped and God can take you from defeat back to Victory again he can bring you from a lower state of trouble and trial and put you back in Victory again oh I'm talking about the blood the blood that is able tonight to change the situations of your heart and of your soul you say brother Wayne I'm troubled I say there's a valley to put your trouble in I'm troubled tonight brother Wayne I'm troubled by this problem I'm troubled by this situation there is a valley of acre as a door of hope there is hope for every man that is still breathing there is hope that there's a valley to put it in brother valleys valleys of hope you say brother Wayne what are you saying say that when sin is confessed it drops into the blood where does confess sin go into the blood confess sin has been dipped into the blood a man or woman that's been dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ it kills every symptom Hallelujah let me just say it like this it don't just take the sin it takes the guilt with it let me tell tell you long after the sin's gone the guilt's laying there and that's what's keeping you from enjoying your services that's what's keeping you from Clapping Your Hands and lifting your voice and amen that's what's took the Hallelujah out of your life is the guilt of it the the remembrance of it the trouble of it well I say tonight put the guilt in the same blood that you put the sin in put the memory in the same blood you put your sins in we've got a right as a bride to stand on the promise of the blood amen you said brother how much release can I have how much faith can you have in the blood your faith in the blood is the power of God in your life as much as you can believe in the blood is as much power as you can have tonight we stay unjustified in Christ now what are we talking about we're talking about sins after that you're a Believer the power of the blood is just as powerful after the cross as it is before the cross 4,000 years of mankind and their sin was abolished by the cross but 2,000 years later we are still feeling the effects of the Cross why is it when a Christian becomes a Christian he thinks the cross is only good for the sins he did before he's a sinner when before he was a Christian before I was a Christian this happened and this happened and this happened and the blood took it all away but what about after you're a Christian what about after you're a believer isn't there any forgiveness for a Believer isn't there any hope for a man or a woman or a child I say there's hope I say there's the blood I say there's a release of sin and a release of guilt I say God can change the circumstances of Our Lives I want our young people to know there's a place to confess your sins there's a place to start over let me tell you the devil's a Trapper not only is he a Trapper he don't want to just trap you he wants to keep you I used to trap animals I know what it's about you learn the nature you trap them but if you don't trap them right they're gone before morning but God God knows that devil didn't just want to trap you he want to keep you 30 years later Sister Marge you'll still have mind battles about it yes sir isn't that amazing that something can haunt a person for years and years and years and we might as well go ahead and punch that devil right in the face sometimes it things you're not even guilty of yourself you didn't even do it but had it done to you and that Devil's pledged your mind he's tried to take away your innocence and say you did some filthy thing when it was nothing but the devil trying to destroy your life and what God gave you well I rebuke that condemning devil tonight he's a liar to begin [Applause] with it's a truth it's a truth amen I don't often read it but I'll tell you what right now I can tell you where it's coming from it's a lie the body of Christ standing redeemed justified in his sight why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing the victory he died for this purpose sir he didn't die to make you a church member he didn't die so you could attend church he died to give you Victory and when we see him coming down and living among us oh God I want you to watch the interest of God he comes himself that's why the son of man was coming in the end time that's right the word was descending that's going to get real important in a moment yes sir but the word is a discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart isn't that amazing that the discerner himself was coming Among Us in the end time amen showing the difference between fig leaf and the blood you see justified in his sight we are his victory we come forth in the last day with this Glory showing the victory he died for this purpose and we prove his victory we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows they couldn't keep him in the ground and neither can they keep us in the breach brother bam says it he says what we have lost is being restored in paragraph 102 he said if the blood has cleansed us back what about now look what the Son of God the second Adam said the works that I do shall you do also now what's he's doing he's proving the cleansing pattern now now let me just let me just take just a moment uh brother brother Ron said a little something to me here while back reminded me this morning as listen Tate brother brand brought up Charles finny brother Ron said brother Wayne said he said you're a little bit like that guy Charles Finley finny finny is his name and I said what do you mean brother Ron he said well he said because your cases are built by the law by the word and and when I was studying this I thought you know what but that's the only thing that the devil recognizes y'all remember brother Braham said his first first sermon he preached you remember that he said I had everybody and he said they were crying and they were shouting and he said I walked in the back room and he said he said I seen my pastor and I said what' you think about that sermon he said I was real proud of it' he said the old brother looked at me he says worst thing I ever heard he said man that hit me where Hur he saidh was it so bad he said well he said you put on all the works he said but you didn't put no word out and he said if you're going to win a case you're going to have to have the law behind it and when the scriptures have been given here the Bible said we have been redeemed by the Precious Blood of the Lamb that we were for ordained before the foundation of the world in Revelations 13 the Bible said that the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world telling us then that no sin committed in the world could outdo the blood that was slain before the world the debt was paid from before the world telling us nothing in time could overcome the blood that was before time amen all the blood the Redemption of it see now in Psalms 103 David Avid will say this let's build it just for a moment Psalms 103 David said bless the Lord all my soul and all that was Within Me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all the benefits yes sir you're talking about a benefit of being a Christian yes sir the benefit of being a Christian listen to this next one who forgiveth all thine iniquity who Health all thy disease can somebody say all for me all thine iniquity I said well well the way I'll tell you what that don't count me well wait a minute now brother Adam says iniquity means to do something you knew not to do amen he said or to do something you knew to do right well that got everybody he brother B so spelled it out to everybody was involved in this scripture yeah who forgiveth all that iniquity who Health all thy diseases look at the blessing that David was sharing with the church blessed is a man from Psalms 32 And1 blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven whose sin is covered amen blessed is the man whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no God now y'all just for a short uh short bible study I'm not going to I don't have time to go into it let's just plainly say it the word impute means count yeah amen count in other words right there's a difference in iniquity counted and iniquity not counted now now I I can I can take all night with the scripture but I I hope you just hear what I'm saying to you you say so and so did something but there's a difference to what's accounted and what's not accounted Hallelujah now just in two minutes I'll show you it in the scripture Apostle Peter lost his boldness remember he cut off the ear he cut off the ear of a Pharisee coming to get Jesus Romans cut his ear off brother said there it is he could doal with the Creeds he could take his Theology and cut them up he said but when it come down to the Cross he stood there and denied Jesus Christ showing he had no Christian Courage at all yeah denied him three times in the presence of the enemies and followed a far off but on the day of Pentecost he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother bandam said the Holy Ghost is an abstract title deed to your property now how many knows what that means a title deed says you own it and Abstract says there's no leans against it so in other words if God had counted it against Peter amen the Holy Ghost would have never come on him we see that with Judas his scariot he sold out the Lord and the Bible said he tried to repent but there was no place for him and he went and hung himself amen showing us there were four crosses right amen that's right the Son of God come for the thief on the right and Judas the son of predition come for the thief on the left that's right and it never was counted against Peter and it never was counted against Paul and any man with a baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a difference in iniquity that's counted and iniquity that's not counted there is an abstract title deed upon every believer here tonight thank you Jesus I saw him do it but God didn't see it goodness the power of the blood I tell you what you can do you can clean up the viist you can change the viist from a sinner to a saint though thy sins be as Crimson they shall be white as snow Paul brings it up to the New Testament I thought it was always amazing Paul who was killing Christians when God found him says in Romans 4:6 even David described the blessedness of a man whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin here Paul is a recipient as a seed of David who had killed Christians who had committed the violent sins a man could commit you say well he just did that to so and so he just did that to so and so Jesus said different when he met the pillar of fire he said I am him whom thou persecutest he persecuted the Lord but when the blood came into his path he had a forgiveness of sins upon his life and he oh how he must have felt when he wrote that blessed is a man whom the Lord would not impute sins Hallelujah you imagine when that inspiration struck him I bet the candle burned a little brighter that night amen now that's just a that's just a little background to the thought see she was redeemed of the blood and can never come condemnation here's what brother R is teaching us she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed to her sin cannot be imputed to her God put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life and when he come to the altar before the foundation of the world that's the Bible it was slang before the foundation of the world preaching predestination will force you to preach a atonement in a way the world doesn't understand it in 1 John Chapter 2 and verse one my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he is the propitiation of our sins and not ours only but the sins of the whole world Amen now they used to teach it in the Pentecostal church if you got a problem go have a talk with Jesus I remember as a kid hearing them talk about it just a little talk with Jesus makes everything right they're writing that from an advocate we got a friend who we can talk to brother brandom comes along and says that's not what that means at all he said that ain't what that means at all he said what that means is the Holy Ghost is an advocate to the believer it means he's a lawyer that stands between you and a righteous judge in other words anybody ever had to go to court yeah maybe I should just ask General here but anybody ever had to go to court I had I think I went once and stood before a judge it was scary and it was over a license plate or something I can't imagine having the blood of somebody on my hands or some real crime I had to look at him for can you imagine that you're guilty now you're just before the judge but I but I have probably needed to go a couple times and I called a lawyer and I never had to show up because you can actually hire someone to stand between you and the judge and he acts as though you were standing there but he speaks for you now this is called a lawyer or an advocate and the Bible is telling us that we have an advocate with the father so there is something between you and God but it's not sin it's say it's God in his Justice by the power of the blood he is an advocate brother Bram says he stands in my place now when sins are confessed it's put in the blood of Christ and they'll never be known God forgets them there never ever was done as long as that sacrifice is laying there it's an atonement for us that's it we're not Sinners no more we're Christians by the grace of God remember in ourselves we'd probably be just as as bad as we ever were but the grace of God has appeared unto us the brother bam says it like this the ink becomes bleach and that's what happens you're confessed sin if you're in Christ between you and God is a whole tub of bleach now you Believers know what I'm talking about brother B says you take a drop of ink and put it in a tub of bleach brother Errol Gregory told me one time he said be careful he said a tub of bleach because he Brother Ray he actually brought a a a a clear glass of w of bleach and he set it on the platform dropped ink in it and the bleach turned black he said bad idea he said he said a tub of bleach yeah right should have tried that at home first ah Marvel thought huh but here's the reality is brother Bram is trying to make a point that the chemical power of bleach is more powerful than the ink right so if the ink is made up of several things when something breaks the power they go back to where they come from yes sir and that's what happens when concess sin is Dropped In The Blood it breaks apart sin and it sends it upon the head of the original sinner Amen brother B says is it like this God created Power created a blood cell without sexual desire in the womb of the Virgin and that don't only cover sin it omits it takes it so far that it'll never come in the mind of God it don't make a bridge across the chasm it moves the chasm that drop of ink into the bottle of the bleach whatever might be you never find that color again amen now watch this brother ramman God in Simplicity if I have a red spot on my hand and cover it wide and a red spot's still there it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin now everybody in here that wears blue jeans or has dark clothes knows the power of bleach right we don't have to preach on the power of bleach you ever got it on a dark shirt nobody has to ask what happened to your shirt I hey I even found that it's in the pool uh cleaner stuff when you pour it in there if you just get the splatter of the water you you you'll have it on your pants you think what' I do and you oh I poured that bleach in the pool cuz it's so powerful just a speck of it leaves a leaves a spot where it has been and here brother bam is saying this bleach has come from the heavens and our confess sin now here it is our confessed sins drop into God's bleach try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him to the day of judgment that's what happens to your sin yes sir you see brother Wayne if if I've done something wrong when I confess it what happens to it it goes back to the original sinner it's broke and goes back now listen to this it's being removed from you it's not like that you're just imagining that it's being gone but confess sin drops into the blood brother brand watch now he's splitting this paragraph 407 paragraph 410 he splits this into two parts and if you'd like to study this go look at this he tells you what happens to the sin it's dropped into the bleach it hits the accuser Satan lays on until the day of judgment but in paragraph 14 he says but what happens to the sun the sun and the sin are together the bleach breaks them apart the sin goes back on the devil but what happens to the sun he asked the question what happens to the Sun he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him no more stain of the bleach can be seen anywhere he's free Hallelujah just as chloroxide took the ink it can never be in no more because it's broke again and when confessed sin it's been dropped into the blood a man or a woman that's ever Dept in the blood of Jesus kills the symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and lay onto him to the day of judgment Eternal destination to be throwed into the Lake of Fire now don't you stumble at Simplicity it's covered by the blood so brother Wayne I have things that trouble me tonight I got more but I think it's time brother can you come to the music I got things that trouble me tonight yes sir there is a valley yeah amen can I just say it there's a sea yeah amen yeah there's a fountain now here's the thing if it's trouble and I say to you now I'm in the scripture right if you're if you will confess your sin he is faithful and just yes Amen to forgive you amen now ask yourself what does that mean if if you're sitting here tonight and you said brother Wayne I've got troubles how do I get out of this all right there there is sin that requires more and that would be that you know a man cheated on his wife or the wife brother bam said that you haven't just sinned against God you sinned against your mate he said so you'd have to go to them right now we you need to make a difference so you can see okay let let's see that you've committed some sin against a person where you've stolen a large amount of money and you need to return it there needs to be restitution made then that person would you would you would need that person to involve that person if that's a personal problem the issues in your life and thought life and the confession you're talking about is not to a preacher or a pastor or a pope it's a confession to God and you wouldn't even have to leave your seat to do that tonight right amen and somebody say well brother Wayne I think there should be a lot A lot has to be done to get to the place you're want it to get now I want you to watch he has come down Among Us right and when they were behind fig leaves he said you're behind a fig Leaf but he could still see the problem remember y'all remember there was a guy coming the discernment line with brother brandham and he came in brother Bram said he's living with another man's wife uh but he wasn't it actually had to do with his religion there was another he wasn't wrong he was just seeing it as adultery but it was spiritual and brother Bram told him later that's what it was it was another man he comes through the prayer line I've heard brother Bram say it a million times he'll say not a million several times he comes he says he says the altar are to be full tonight nobody was moving he said now I could walk right down this roll he said and start telling the situations in lives see because they were hiding it behind the Fig Leaf but but uh there's one story brother Tim and I were talking about it some time ago and and the girl I believe the woman him herself was in brother Tim's church and she went through the prayer line there in Louisiana she was young Methodist when she was smoking and brother bandam was in the prayer line and he was praying and he told them as he always does he said now when you get in the prayer line he said if there's sin in your life it's going to expose it he said it'll just call it out and he said and then it it won't be me it'll just be the angel so he he was talking about smoking or something that night and that little girl was coming in prayer line and her mom was in the same line and as she was walking she said she got to thinking that she hadn't really thought about how bad smoking was but when the way brother Bram talked about it she knew that it was really wrong she should have never done it and she got to pray in and she said Lord forgive me when she got in front of brother brandham he never mentioned it one [Music] time some somewhere in a few steps she found a place to put it and God had a discerner yeah to prove back to this congregation that what he said in the scripture is true that confess sin dipped into the blood that it would put it in the sea where God couldn't even remember it somebody asked him I believe it's Perry green I heard this years ago they said why didn't you why didn't you uncover the certain situation brother Bram said well it's been confessed he said God can't see it neither could his profit amen many times you're going back to God saying God God forgive me God forgive me and he don't even know what you're talking [Music] about but see something trouble you and said brother Wayne when could a person be forgiven how could I get rid of that trouble in one place brother BR said the minute you said in your heart Lord forgive me it was gone amen thank you Jesus we're talking about the the redeemed the redeemed of God something trouble you tonight there's a there's a valley there's a hope there's a hope for every every one of you every young person setting every Elder in this building there's a place of hope tonight is the blood and all you'd have to do right now is say Lord Jesus I'm so sorry I'm so sorry J J and by prophetic word brother Bram said it would be covered sincere confession to God and it takes it away from your life do you love him tonight won't you stand to your feet with us my aren't you aren't you so glad for the Bible aren't you glad that story about ain's in there now I've heard that preached in a real negative way in my lifetime yes sir but brother Bram said a Christian is always positive amen and the positive behind that is God has a way to deal with it that can put you back in Victory I believe that tonight don't you with our hearts bowed with our hearts bowed Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus it's a beautiful congregation tonight Lord real real Believers hearts Lord that love you lives that are dedicated to you Lord if we took their lives to compare them with the world oh Lord there's not even a comparison Lord our young people your Prophet said they were the greatest some of the greatest in the world and here here they stand tonight maybe in somebody's eyes they might see something or they might see them a certain way but Lord we know how you see them but the enemy is constantly trying to trouble oh Jesus trying to trouble your children trying to trouble your church but Lord You've gave us Grace you gave us us a way that the Holy Spirit might walk through the aisles tonight calling our names telling us to take away the Fig leaf and put it under the blood and Lord I tonight I want to say Lord forgive me forgive me for any wrong or forgive me for any mistake Lord yes Lord father we want it all under the blood for your children tonight Lord as we were speaking I could I could feel their need Lord to see the situ situations as they would rise up one after the other Hearts crying out just in the moment of the preaching asking oh God let me throw mine in that Valley of acre tonight and I pray now in the name of Jesus Christ Lord cover every sin Lord remove every fig Leaf tonight Lord let us come to you with open arms Lord we bring nothing but the blood we only bring the sacrifice of your son we asking you tonight Lord forgive every iniquity forgive every sin Lord Lord let us face our enemy with great boldness and challenge knowing Lord that through that blood cell every sin is defeated oh God and Father we commit this into thy faithful hands in the precious name of Jesus we pray
