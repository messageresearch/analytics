[17:05] still a desire once more Lord
[17:07] amen tonight will be our prayer line
[17:09] service
[17:10] and so we just want to make a couple
[17:12] points of order about that the we'll

[17:16] as we've done in previous years people
[17:18] will come around this side we'll have uh
[17:21] we'll we'll have some ministers seasoned
[17:24] and proven Ministries will be gathered
[17:27] here together and we'll just bring
[17:29] around this way and right through
[17:31] have you prayed for it's quite a large
[17:33] group of people
[17:34] so we just we want to keep an orderly
[17:36] flow
[17:37] and and want to just handle things
[17:39] efficiently as far as that goes
[17:41] so there there's a group of people that
[17:43] have already been instructed how to
[17:45] assist the ministry brothers and sisters
[17:46] so we just ask you just respectfully let
[17:49] them direct you
[17:51] and uh
[17:52] and friends I'd I'd just like to
[17:57] I'd like to turn our attention to think
[17:59] about the stakes
[18:03] even those you
[18:05] the families and the older ones in the
[18:07] back
[18:09] our young people
[18:11] facing real battles
[18:14] great struggles things previous
[18:16] generations knew nothing about
[18:18] the world has become so wicked and the
[18:20] devil's on the Rampage
[18:22] our young people are under such a such
[18:24] attack it's total war to be a believer
[18:28] in this age
[18:30] friends think about the need think about
[18:32] the stakes think about how critical it
[18:34] is
[18:35] amen that we we get out of his way
[18:37] tonight let the Lord come amongst us
[18:40] amen and do what we do not have the
[18:42] ability to do friends
[18:45] tonight it's not about me it's not about
[18:48] you there can't be any self in there
[18:51] amen this is not about any church this
[18:53] is not about any Ministry
[18:55] this is about the needs of our young
[18:57] people
[18:58] amen could we get in one mind and one
[19:00] Accord
[19:01] call on the Lord to come amongst us do
[19:04] the miraculous amen amen we want to
[19:07] share a little testimony just to show
[19:09] you how Satan has been attacking this
[19:11] meeting last brother Elijah Evans why
[19:13] don't you just come up with me brother
[19:15] Elijah
[19:16] amen just this week you know we've seen
[19:18] a lot in the home Church of hell how the
[19:21] devil uh
[19:22] the devil's also been an expectation
[19:25] amen so we just want to share this with
[19:26] you for your encouragement
[19:28] brother uh brother Elijah is a good boy
[19:31] there's hardly a finer boy in shoe
[19:32] leather today
[19:33] and the he's working hard he's uh he's
[19:37] making a lot of sacrifice for his future
[19:39] and so the other day he was driving
[19:41] tired and and uh and fell asleep at the
[19:44] wheel
[19:46] I had to he woke up had to Swerve a
[19:48] mailbox and and his car went off the
[19:50] road into the woods on the other side go
[19:51] ahead brothers and show those pictures
[19:53] as I'm sharing with you
[19:55] amen and and in inches inches
[19:59] could have made the difference between
[20:00] brother Elijah being here tonight
[20:02] and US losing another one of our young
[20:04] men
[20:06] amen so we just thank God for his Mercy
[20:08] for his keeping power
[20:14] amen
[20:17] [Music]
[20:20] [Applause]
[20:24] even the emergency staff that came to to
[20:26] get brother Elijah they had just left an
[20:29] accident where somebody didn't walk away
[20:31] ran into a telephone pole so it's the
[20:33] grace of God you know young people
[20:35] we think the devil has a lot of power
[20:38] we struggle with a lot of fear where the
[20:41] power Satan has over you but you know
[20:42] the enemy cannot touch you
[20:45] amen he cannot touch you while God is
[20:48] has a purpose for your life amen and so
[20:51] so no matter how angry the devil becomes
[20:53] and no matter how much he's tried to
[20:55] fight this meaning we shall Prevail
[20:56] tonight amen why because God has a
[20:59] purpose I believe in gathering us

[21:13] Satan can't touch you if you're serving
[21:14] God's purpose amen there's nothing that
[21:17] can take you under the ground but if uh

[26:33] be Warriors to be Fighters we're not
[26:35] giving up we're not backing down and ask
[26:39] you tonight
[26:39] [Music]
[26:40] before we go to prayer how many of you
[26:43] would have a real need
[26:47] how many of you tonight are suffering
[26:49] maybe from a suicidal spirit
[26:52] keep your hands up if that be you let's
[26:54] be honest I want you parents to
[26:55] recognize your children are in a battle
[26:59] I want you adults to help us create an
[27:02] atmosphere so the chains of Darkness
[27:04] will be broken off their lives tonight
[27:06] some of them are facing some serious
[27:08] needs
[27:09] how many you longing for the Holy Ghost
[27:12] not just an emotion not just a goosebump
[27:15] I'm talking about a genuine nature
[27:17] change where you know that you met God
[27:18] and God met you and sealed you away
[27:21] you know the prophet of God will tell us
[27:23] you'll get what you expect
[27:26] he said if you come expecting
[27:27] disappointment that's exactly what
[27:30] you'll get
[27:31] you can line up ministers all day long
[27:33] anointing men of God and have a prayer
[27:35] line but if you don't come with an
[27:37] expectation that when you get to the
[27:39] other side that you're going to get your
[27:41] desire man you're coming through that
[27:43] line in vain so tonight is we have a
[27:46] prayer line let me encourage you come
[27:48] with an expectation
[27:50] the prophet of God would preach a
[27:51] message expectation because he knew this
[27:54] generation would need to know about it
[27:56] the seriousness of what it means to have
[27:58] a real expectation we had a young girl
[28:00] at our church lost all our hair but she
[28:03] came with some bobby pins
[28:05] she says when I come to the other side
[28:06] I'm gonna put these in my hair
[28:09] oh it didn't happen overnight
[28:11] that young girls now she's married he's
[28:13] got long beautiful black hair and she
[28:15] and she's serving the lord because she
[28:17] came with an expectation and let me tell
[28:19] you if you'll come tonight whether you
[28:20] want the Holy Ghost whether you want to
[28:22] change the darkness broken off your life
[28:24] God will meet you in this prayer line
[28:26] and when you come through you'll be
[28:28] different when you get to the other side
[28:31] chains of Darkness will be broken off
[28:32] your life healing will be your portion
[28:34] Deliverance will be the manifestation of
[28:36] the holy spirit it's yours tonight but
[28:39] you got to believe
[28:40] don't come endowed so let's just bow our
[28:43] heads and we take this need tonight

[28:47] offerings to the Lord father what a
[28:49] great privilege lays before us tonight

[1:15:45] expectations our lord Jesus is so
[1:15:49] amazing
[1:15:51] he never fails us
[1:15:53] to think that that we've been here as a
[1:15:56] as a camp for three years now and to
[1:15:59] look back and to see what our Lord Jesus
[1:16:01] Christ has done
[1:16:03] it's amazing
[1:16:07] to think that we have some
[1:16:09] representatives of Heaven that have
[1:16:11] decided I'm going all
[1:16:14] the way
[1:16:16] not just in this camp but when I get

[1:16:23] Lord just wonderful to us
[1:16:25] I want to just take this moment and I
[1:16:28] want to
[1:16:29] I want to thank the Lord for what he's
[1:16:31] done here and I want to express my
[1:16:34] appreciation
[1:16:36] to Brother Ray to brother Wayne brother
[1:16:38] Nathan for allowing us
[1:16:43] be a part of these meetings and to
[1:16:45] to be attached to these young people's
[1:16:47] testimonies and we counted one of the
[1:16:49] greatest privileges in our life and
[1:16:51] I want to personally thank you for
[1:16:53] allowing my dad
[1:16:55] to be a part of these meetings
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:16:59] it sure means a lot to me too
[1:17:02] to see what the Lord has done and
[1:17:06] Ron Spencer has done a lot of things in
[1:17:08] this life and he's taken away every
[1:17:09] excuse
[1:17:11] that there can be
[1:17:13] so I know that you have it in you
[1:17:15] tonight to go
[1:17:17] to go the distance and I
[1:17:21] he's my daddy but I tell you I've never
[1:17:23] been so proud of him in all my life to
[1:17:26] watch him here on this stage and how the
[1:17:28] angel Lord began to move and
[1:17:30] just put a ring of fire around the man
[1:17:33] of God and
[1:17:35] to see a man like Ron Spencer that
[1:17:37] there's other men like Ron Spencer like
[1:17:39] brother Tim Pruitt and the ray Harrison
[1:17:42] brother Wayne Lawson there's so many
[1:17:43] great men but it was men like these men
[1:17:47] that fought for our liberties
[1:17:50] and decided that no matter what the cost
[1:17:54] they were going to fight for your
[1:17:55] freedom
[1:17:56] didn't matter what they what friends
[1:17:58] they lost they were going to fight for
[1:18:00] your freedom for the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:03] Ghost and we wouldn't be here without
[1:18:06] men like these men
[1:18:08] these men made a way for you to come
[1:18:10] into this camp and receive a change
[1:18:15] don't you appreciate these men of God
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:23] afraid to preach the entirety of the
[1:18:26] message
[1:18:27] and that's what we are gathered here
[1:18:30] that's the expectation in the room
[1:18:32] that's why you're here
[1:18:35] and we're going to change the order of
[1:18:37] the service now and just go to the word
[1:18:39] and I know that there are many needs
[1:18:42] here tonight and I know that we have a
[1:18:44] prayer line afterwards and I know that
[1:18:47] the Lord will come down and meet us here
[1:18:50] as he has done many times
[1:18:53] but this is where I want you to receive
[1:18:55] your victory
[1:18:56] at the preaching of the word
[1:19:01] because men can lay their hands on you
[1:19:03] and I'm a full believer in this
[1:19:06] I'm commissioned to do it but the word
[1:19:09] is your Firm Foundation
[1:19:12] when there is no more Camp atmosphere
[1:19:14] the word will be there for you
[1:19:19] when these great men that surround you
[1:19:21] when they're not with you the word will
[1:19:24] never leave you nor forsake you it is
[1:19:27] our absolute so with that in mind I I
[1:19:30] would like for you to if it doesn't make
[1:19:32] you nervous or feel uncomfortable I
[1:19:35] would like you to lay your hands over on
[1:19:37] your brother and your sister
[1:19:38] right there and I want you to bind with
[1:19:41] us in prayer tonight and ask the Lord to
[1:19:44] come in a very specific way
[1:19:47] Heavenly Father we approach you now
[1:19:49] father Lord realizing the moment that we
[1:19:52] are in lordy Jesus it's a moment that
[1:19:55] you have predestinated father before the
[1:19:57] foundation of the world
[1:19:59] Lord we've we've we've stood here before
[1:20:01] we've stood in this same position we've
[1:20:03] stood behind this Pulpit father but
[1:20:06] we've never stood in the place that
[1:20:08] we're standing in right now father we've
[1:20:11] read scriptures we've read quotes but
[1:20:13] father we've never seen them in the
[1:20:14] light that we're seeing them in right
[1:20:16] now under the message of the hour father
[1:20:18] you've given us our Liberty and I pray
[1:20:20] father tonight that you would just come
[1:20:22] in abundance father Lord we realize that
[1:20:26] there's an enemy that's trying to kill
[1:20:28] and to steal and destroy but you have
[1:20:30] come to give us life and life more
[1:20:32] abundantly and father I pray that your
[1:20:34] Holy Spirit Lord would unwrap these
[1:20:37] these young ones father tonight they
[1:20:40] come here with a purpose to meet you
[1:20:42] father and I'm asking Lord that the
[1:20:44] mighty Angel would swoop through this
[1:20:46] building father Lord just begin to open
[1:20:48] up the scriptures to them to make them
[1:20:50] see that you're still the Jesus of the
[1:20:53] Bible father we commit this service into
[1:20:55] your hand every need every every
[1:20:58] obstacle that we come come up against
[1:20:59] father we pray your blessings on this
[1:21:02] service I pray that you would take me
[1:21:03] set me behind the corner just for a
[1:21:05] moment behind the curtain Lord and begin
[1:21:08] to use the humanity father that I offer
[1:21:10] to you father Lord I pray that you bind
[1:21:13] every demonic Spirit father in this
[1:21:15] place and let the Holy Ghost have its
[1:21:17] Liberty here according to the word of
[1:21:20] God we believe these things and we say
[1:21:22] it is settled and it is so father we
[1:21:25] pray that you'd have your will in your
[1:21:27] way in this service tonight in the name
[1:21:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:34] have your Bibles this evening we'd like
[1:21:36] to look into a couple portions of
[1:21:38] scripture
[1:21:39] of Luke Chapter 13 Luke Chapter 13 and
[1:21:43] verse 10 then also to Revelations
[1:21:45] chapter 5 and verse 1.
[1:21:53] Hallelujah
[1:22:07] tonight's going to be a very special
[1:22:09] night
[1:22:15] very special
[1:22:19] tonight your night
[1:22:24] Luke Chapter 13 and verse 10 and he was
[1:22:26] and he was teaching and one of the
[1:22:29] synagogues on the Sabbath and behold
[1:22:31] there was a woman which had a spirit of
[1:22:33] infirmity 18 years and was bowed
[1:22:35] together and could in no wise lift up
[1:22:39] herself
[1:22:40] and when Jesus saw her
[1:22:42] he called her to him
[1:22:45] notice the power of His call and said
[1:22:47] unto her woman thou art loosed from
[1:22:51] thine infirmity
[1:22:52] and he laid his hands on her and
[1:22:53] immediately she was made straight and
[1:22:55] glorified God and the ruler of the
[1:22:58] synagogue answered with indignation
[1:22:59] because that Jesus healed on the Sabbath
[1:23:02] day and said unto the people there are
[1:23:04] six days in which men ought to work in
[1:23:08] them therefore come and be healed and
[1:23:10] not on the Sabbath you see what these
[1:23:12] rulers are doing they're basically
[1:23:14] putting limitations on when healing can
[1:23:16] come
[1:23:21] the Lord answered him and said thou
[1:23:23] hypocrite doth not each one of you on
[1:23:26] the Sabbath Luth loose his ox or his ass
[1:23:29] from the stall and lead him away for to
[1:23:32] the watering not not this woman being a
[1:23:34] daughter of Abraham who Satan hath bound
[1:23:36] low of these 18 years be loosed from the
[1:23:39] bond of on this sabbath and when he had
[1:23:42] said these things all his adversaries
[1:23:44] were ashamed and all the people rejoiced
[1:23:47] for all the Glorious things that were
[1:23:50] done by him also Revelations chapter 5
[1:23:54] and verse 1.
[1:23:58] if you don't know where it's at it's at
[1:23:59] the very back of the book
[1:24:04] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:24:07] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:24:10] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[1:24:12] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:24:14] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:24:16] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:24:18] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:24:20] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:24:22] able to open the book neither to look
[1:24:25] thereon and I wept much because no man
[1:24:28] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:24:32] book neither to look thereon and one of
[1:24:35] the elders said unto me weep not Behold
[1:24:37] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:24:40] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:24:42] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[1:24:45] I beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:24:46] Throne of the four and Beast and the
[1:24:48] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:24:51] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:24:53] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:24:55] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[1:24:58] he came and took the book out of the
[1:25:01] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:25:04] throne may God bless his word you may be
[1:25:06] seated tonight in the presence of the
[1:25:08] Lord by the help of the Lord I'd like to
[1:25:10] take a thought that he's put on our on
[1:25:12] our hearts for this this this Camp
[1:25:14] service here tonight on woman
[1:25:17] thou art loosed
[1:25:21] woman
[1:25:23] thou art loosed and I think we're
[1:25:25] standing in a very very special spot to
[1:25:28] recognize that that who we are in the
[1:25:30] body of Jesus Christ I think it's it's
[1:25:33] just a wonderful thing how the body of
[1:25:35] Christ can be gathered together here
[1:25:37] tonight not have not have any
[1:25:39] formalities about it not have any ideas
[1:25:41] of of this one's got to go where that
[1:25:43] one's got to go but we can sit here
[1:25:45] under the revealing of the son of man
[1:25:47] and recognize who we are as the Church
[1:25:50] of the Living God and I think it's a
[1:25:52] very powerful thing that that we
[1:25:54] recognize that that there's not any
[1:25:55] Shackles on the Church of the Living God
[1:25:57] there's nothing on this body that that
[1:25:59] that that cannot be broke off of her but
[1:26:02] we recognize it that brother Brandon
[1:26:04] would tell us he said now he said just
[1:26:05] shake off all the shackles and get loose
[1:26:08] so that you can really enter into the
[1:26:09] Shekinah Glory and I think it's a
[1:26:11] wonderful thing that then when you can
[1:26:12] lay aside all your weights and lay aside
[1:26:14] all your ideas and all of your petitions
[1:26:17] or all of your thoughts that need to
[1:26:19] happen I I think it's an amazing thing
[1:26:21] that we recognize where we are we're in
[1:26:23] a place where God can express his mind
[1:26:26] and take off all the restraints off the
[1:26:28] body of Jesus Christ and brother Brandon
[1:26:31] would say that we're in an astronaut age
[1:26:33] he said we're living right here in the
[1:26:35] astronaut age he said and God has
[1:26:36] achieved what he promised that he was
[1:26:38] going to achieve in the last days
[1:26:40] according to Malachi 4 he said the only
[1:26:42] thing that he has to do is to get
[1:26:44] somebody in his hands that can cut loose
[1:26:47] from the airplanes and the Automobiles
[1:26:49] and whatever more he said and not look
[1:26:51] back to what it was but more power to
[1:26:53] lift him higher lift him into the
[1:26:55] presence of God and lift him up there
[1:26:57] where all things are possible and I
[1:26:59] think it's amazing thing when we can
[1:27:01] recognize that there is there is nothing
[1:27:03] that is on the body of Jesus Christ that
[1:27:05] can hold us down but I have found that
[1:27:07] that no matter what the world offers you
[1:27:09] young people or whatever Satan kind of
[1:27:11] puts in your path that it will only
[1:27:13] bring you down it'll always give you
[1:27:15] anxiety it'll give you depression it'll
[1:27:17] give you fear but it's amazing that the
[1:27:19] Lord Jesus Christ when he gives you
[1:27:21] anything he don't only Take You Higher
[1:27:24] and are found in my life that the only
[1:27:26] satisfying portion in my life is the
[1:27:29] message of the hour and I have found
[1:27:30] that the message didn't beat me down it
[1:27:32] didn't tell me that I was no good it
[1:27:34] didn't tell me I was a doormat but I
[1:27:36] found that the message of the hour Has
[1:27:38] Lifted Me Up into a place to believe
[1:27:40] that all things are possible and I
[1:27:42] believe that if we can sit here under
[1:27:45] the message of the hour and William
[1:27:46] Brandon would say in recognizing your
[1:27:48] day in its message he said National
[1:27:49] Forest put the put the church or put the
[1:27:52] world cancel churches in the church he
[1:27:54] said but not National Forest it put
[1:27:56] Israel back in her Homeland but it's the
[1:27:58] power of God that puts the people in the
[1:28:00] body of Jesus Christ it's the power of
[1:28:02] God that will take you higher here
[1:28:04] tonight it's not your ideas it's not
[1:28:06] your Creeds it's not your dog must it's
[1:28:09] a message of the hour the power of God
[1:28:11] revealed in this hour it is exactly what
[1:28:14] Isaiah 58 and 6 is not this the fast
[1:28:17] that I have chosen to loose the bands
[1:28:20] upon those that are under the heavy
[1:28:22] burdens is that not what the message did
[1:28:24] for you in your life when it found you
[1:28:26] where you were you were in bondage you
[1:28:28] were in sin but the message
[1:28:31] come on somebody the message of the hour
[1:28:33] set you free from your ideas that you
[1:28:36] couldn't live any higher this ain't just
[1:28:38] William branham's message it's my
[1:28:40] message
[1:28:41] that is the fast that he has chosen
[1:28:44] under the Church of the Living God to
[1:28:46] lose her and to let her be exactly who
[1:28:49] he is
[1:28:52] what is it it is the power of the
[1:28:55] presence of el shadiyah because in your
[1:28:57] Humanity capacity you're not able to
[1:29:00] produce what needs to be produced in
[1:29:02] this hour but if you can ever lean on
[1:29:04] the breast of el shadiah you can pull
[1:29:07] the very strength that you don't have
[1:29:08] right out of the out of el Shady eyes
[1:29:10] presence and it'll make an old man
[1:29:12] become a new man a young man and it'll
[1:29:15] take a young man and make him live a
[1:29:17] real Christian Life
[1:29:18] yeah
[1:29:20] it's powerful presence and that's what
[1:29:22] William Bannon would tell us in the
[1:29:23] Feast of the trumpets he said that that
[1:29:25] the Holy Spirit had been bound by the
[1:29:27] denominational Rivers for almost 2 000
[1:29:30] years he said but it's going to be
[1:29:32] loosed at the evening time by the
[1:29:34] evening time message so if you want to
[1:29:36] get loose here tonight
[1:29:39] if you want to get loose here tonight
[1:29:40] you've got to believe the message you've
[1:29:42] got to preach the message it's the
[1:29:44] message that will untie you it's a
[1:29:46] message that'll unravel your mind it's a
[1:29:48] message that'll take the strings off of
[1:29:50] your life I think it's a very powerful
[1:29:53] thing that God
[1:29:54] that God would take and tie up Loose
[1:29:57] Ends to loose you I think it's a very
[1:30:00] powerful thing that God could come with
[1:30:02] all of the complexities of the doctrines
[1:30:04] of the Bible that men had misconstrued
[1:30:07] that God comes and takes Malachi 4 and
[1:30:10] ties them back together so that you
[1:30:12] could be loose there's not one
[1:30:13] denomination can stand up to the power
[1:30:15] of this message
[1:30:18] the world can't offer you anything like
[1:30:21] the message can offer you young people
[1:30:22] Satan offer you criticism say no offer
[1:30:25] you death Satan offer you a good time
[1:30:27] but the message will put you in a
[1:30:29] rapture
[1:30:31] the message will put you in a Rapture
[1:30:33] it'll lose you to believe that all
[1:30:35] things are possible it ain't just for
[1:30:37] the preachers it ain't just for the
[1:30:38] deacons it's for this young boy it's for
[1:30:41] that young girl to believe they don't
[1:30:43] have to live a homosexual life they
[1:30:45] don't have to live under bondage
[1:30:48] woman
[1:30:50] thou art loosed
[1:30:58] well
[1:31:01] it's can't time
[1:31:05] we'll get meeting tonight camp meeting
[1:31:09] tonight can't meeting on the old
[1:31:12] Campground
[1:31:17] well
[1:31:18] they knew what I was when they invited
[1:31:20] me
[1:31:21] and the reason why we're standing here
[1:31:23] is because this is not my daddy's
[1:31:26] Ministry I'm not here because of brother
[1:31:28] Wayne's Ministry I'm not here for
[1:31:30] brother Ray's Ministry I am here because
[1:31:33] this is a son of man Ministry and it
[1:31:35] doesn't matter how far in sin you've
[1:31:37] been it doesn't matter where you are
[1:31:39] this is the ministry of the son of man
[1:31:41] it's not riding on one man it's riding
[1:31:44] on this body move of Jesus Christ and
[1:31:46] you are loose here tonight loose to
[1:31:48] believe that's what William Brandon
[1:31:50] would tell us in the message Shalom when
[1:31:52] he would come there and he would preach
[1:31:54] a very powerful message on Shalom and
[1:31:56] what does he do William banham goes back
[1:31:58] in the Old Testament and grabs Isaiah
[1:32:00] chapter 60 and says arise and shine for
[1:32:03] thy light has come but William Brandon
[1:32:05] would sit there and tell us that we're
[1:32:06] living in the darkest of days but his
[1:32:09] message notice what he says he said my
[1:32:11] message ain't to the church my message
[1:32:13] ain't to that world out there he said
[1:32:15] but my message is to that elect lady
[1:32:18] notice who he is addressing he's
[1:32:20] addressing the body of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:23] he's speaking peace over your body
[1:32:24] notice what he does he tells us that
[1:32:27] Isaiah 60 tells us arise and shine for
[1:32:29] thy light has come and gross darkness is
[1:32:31] upon the people and it's upon the and
[1:32:33] it's upon the land but notice what it
[1:32:35] said but the Highlight shall come what
[1:32:38] is it it's the evening time message that
[1:32:40] will put you in position so that you can
[1:32:43] see the miracle that is on your way it's
[1:32:45] the most chaotic time of Darkness but
[1:32:47] it's the Most Blessed light that there
[1:32:49] ever has been I'll say this it's the
[1:32:52] light that brings the change
[1:32:55] that's what it is and we recognize where
[1:32:57] we're standing at as a Church of the
[1:32:59] Living God as the elect of God we
[1:33:01] realize that we're facing every devil
[1:33:02] Out of Hell two hundred thousand
[1:33:04] thousand demons that have been released
[1:33:06] out of the river Euphrates you can
[1:33:07] search it all the way back go back to
[1:33:10] the Garden of Eden search into Satan's
[1:33:12] Eden and your watch that there is enmity
[1:33:14] between the two two seats between the
[1:33:16] serpent seed and the woman's seed and we
[1:33:19] watch all the way from the Garden of
[1:33:21] Eden all the way to Satan's Eden and you
[1:33:23] watch as the battle continues against
[1:33:25] this body but God has got a lady that
[1:33:28] has been hand-picked she's been called
[1:33:30] of God she's been ordained to live the
[1:33:33] message now I know I know where we're
[1:33:35] standing at but too many times people
[1:33:38] fall victim to certain their
[1:33:39] circumstance they get under their idea
[1:33:42] that they've got to live the way that
[1:33:43] they've got to live
[1:33:45] what did they do they get under the
[1:33:47] poison of unbelief that has been sprayed
[1:33:49] on the gene seed of God ever since the
[1:33:51] Garden of Eden but you have another
[1:33:53] repellent that is upon you and it's a
[1:33:55] repellent of predestination so what
[1:33:58] Satan's got to offer you will never work
[1:34:00] against a germicide seed of God
[1:34:04] now before God is ever going to do
[1:34:06] anything what does he do he tells us the
[1:34:08] name is three and seven that he reveals
[1:34:11] the secrets of it to His prophets and
[1:34:14] when he reveals it to His prophets what
[1:34:15] does he do he causes an expectation you
[1:34:19] see they had there was a testimony in a
[1:34:21] prophecy that came all the way back
[1:34:22] there in the Garden of Eden that the
[1:34:24] woman was going to have a seed so we
[1:34:27] recognize that the word of God made us
[1:34:29] look for the manifestation of the
[1:34:32] woman's seed that's what expectation
[1:34:34] does it brings you from looking at the
[1:34:37] word indnecessarily in a word context
[1:34:39] but it takes you to look for the
[1:34:41] manifestation of the prophecy that's
[1:34:43] going to be fulfilled and notice what we
[1:34:45] did we watched that prophecy as it would
[1:34:48] work in prophets he would work in
[1:34:50] Apostles it would work in disciples but
[1:34:52] yet there had to be one it was one that
[1:34:55] had to be a virtuous son and he had to
[1:34:57] be born just right had to come through a
[1:35:00] virgin birth but we know that it was
[1:35:02] setting up a kingdom we knew that it was
[1:35:04] setting up a kingdom that could not fall
[1:35:07] that could not be shut down that's what
[1:35:09] the expectation of the prophecy
[1:35:11] prophet's prophecy will always do it'll
[1:35:14] make you look for the manifestation of
[1:35:16] the Holy Ghost now William Brandon would
[1:35:18] tell us he said now he said if you'd
[1:35:20] come here and you'd be under great
[1:35:22] anticipation or a great expectation he
[1:35:25] said if you come here looking to
[1:35:27] criticize something he said the devil
[1:35:29] makes sure that you find something to
[1:35:31] criticize about it he said but if you
[1:35:33] come here expecting for God to do
[1:35:35] something for you God will make sure
[1:35:37] that you get exactly what you are
[1:35:39] expecting and I want to tell you I don't
[1:35:42] believe you came to this Camp expecting
[1:35:44] to be bound at the end of this camp
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:49] come on now I don't believe your pastor
[1:35:52] took
[1:35:55] the same condition that he sent you off
[1:35:58] with but I happen to believe that you
[1:36:00] come here under the expectation to be
[1:36:02] freed and set free to believe that the
[1:36:05] same works that Jesus Christ did it'll
[1:36:08] be done in your body and I'll be I'm
[1:36:11] just the kind of man I'm not going to
[1:36:13] give up and I'm not going to back up so
[1:36:14] don't let the devil rob you from your
[1:36:17] expectations
[1:36:20] what is it what is it it's an
[1:36:23] expectation that proves that the
[1:36:25] prophecy wasn't false prophecy it
[1:36:28] manifests exactly what the word of the
[1:36:30] Lord had said that it was going to do
[1:36:32] exactly like Simeon that had been
[1:36:34] revealed to him that he would not see
[1:36:36] death until he seen the Lord's Christ
[1:36:39] now what was it the Bible tells us that
[1:36:42] the holy spirit let Simeon down there
[1:36:44] where Christ was down there and when he
[1:36:47] saw him when he handled the word of God
[1:36:49] what did it do he said let your servant
[1:36:52] be loosed and depart because he
[1:36:54] recognized the manifestation of the
[1:36:57] Christ child was a sign for him that he
[1:37:00] could be loose from the bondage that he
[1:37:02] was under what was it the Revelation
[1:37:04] that he had received from the Lord was
[1:37:06] going to be the one that loosed him
[1:37:09] Hallelujah that's what William Branham
[1:37:12] did that's what he came here for he
[1:37:14] introduced us to a supernatural realm
[1:37:17] what did he do he awakened our
[1:37:19] expectations to believe that you can do
[1:37:22] the same works that Jesus Christ did
[1:37:24] what did he do it awakened our
[1:37:27] expectations to operate in the mind of
[1:37:30] the Lord
[1:37:33] what is it if you abide in me and my
[1:37:35] words about and you ask what's your will
[1:37:37] what did he do he awakened our
[1:37:40] expectation what does prophecy always do
[1:37:43] it makes us look to the Future because
[1:37:46] that's exactly what expectation is it's
[1:37:49] the daresome to believe that it's going
[1:37:52] to happen out there in the future but I
[1:37:54] want to tell you that you are not
[1:37:55] looking at prophecy you're looking at
[1:37:58] the reality of the word what William
[1:38:00] Branham saw as a woman Marching In Step
[1:38:03] 100 Christian Soldiers she is now
[1:38:06] dressed in the Garment of the wedding
[1:38:08] groom that has dressed her according to
[1:38:11] Malachi 4 and God has taken a dress wear
[1:38:14] and he is wrapping these young people
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:20] ah come on now you're not going to be
[1:38:23] dressed in your garments of Robes of
[1:38:24] dishonesty you're not going to be
[1:38:26] dressed in your robes of sin and
[1:38:28] Pleasures you're going to be wrapped up
[1:38:31] in the message of the hour and when
[1:38:33] William Branham preaches the marriage of
[1:38:35] the lamb in 1962 he said this body this
[1:38:39] bride has the material to dress herself
[1:38:41] with now notice what you're setting in
[1:38:43] you're standing in an hour well you're
[1:38:45] not doing it on your own you're not
[1:38:47] standing on your own accord but the
[1:38:49] message
[1:38:52] the message is wrapping you up
[1:38:54] with the power of the almighty God
[1:38:59] you remember when Abraham was having a
[1:39:01] conversation with Elohim he was talking
[1:39:03] to him what was he talking to him about
[1:39:05] he said your seed is going to it's going
[1:39:07] to sojourn in a Strange Land but what
[1:39:10] did it do he told him what did the
[1:39:12] prophecy tell him that you're not going
[1:39:14] to stay there but you're going to be
[1:39:15] delivered so what did it do it caused an
[1:39:18] expectation on the inside of the
[1:39:21] children of Israel that they could
[1:39:23] believe that they didn't have to live in
[1:39:24] bondage no more
[1:39:26] I'll tell you if you got that kind of
[1:39:28] Prophecy that makes you live in bondage
[1:39:30] you need to bury that thing but if
[1:39:32] you've got a prophecy that'll make you
[1:39:33] realize that you don't have to be
[1:39:34] whipped around by the devil you don't
[1:39:36] have to put up with his ideas you don't
[1:39:38] have to put up with his chin you don't
[1:39:40] have to put up with his charges that
[1:39:41] he's charged against you but you can set
[1:39:43] there under the inspiration of the
[1:39:46] prophets prophecy and recognize that
[1:39:48] Deliverance is on its way what did it do
[1:39:50] it caused an expectation on the inside
[1:39:53] of Moses his mother and father of amram
[1:39:57] and Joseph Ed that they went to
[1:39:58] believing that God was going to send to
[1:40:01] deliver they didn't seen 400 years
[1:40:02] without a deliverer but there was
[1:40:04] something on the inside of amram that he
[1:40:07] believed that there was going to come a
[1:40:09] deliverer
[1:40:10] I got to studying just a few weeks ago
[1:40:12] and I got studying about that about
[1:40:14] where where Joshua bed and amram were up
[1:40:16] there and brother Brandon said that
[1:40:17] amram would go up there every single
[1:40:19] night he'd go up there in his upper room
[1:40:20] and he'd go praying asking God do you
[1:40:24] see us down here that's the same way
[1:40:26] that we have to do God do you see this
[1:40:29] side of my generation that we're living
[1:40:30] in God are you looking
[1:40:35] but ham Ram had something on the inside
[1:40:37] of him brother Bynum said that Joseph
[1:40:39] had actually got worried
[1:40:41] about amram because he'd been out there
[1:40:44] working all day long he'd been out there
[1:40:46] under the taskmaster's hand and he was
[1:40:49] out there building bricks and brother
[1:40:51] random said that am or Joseph had looked
[1:40:53] out I said I said amaran look you got to
[1:40:56] eat you're getting pale you're getting
[1:40:58] faint you're getting weary but amram
[1:41:00] would stand there and say no I'm going
[1:41:01] to pray I'm not giving up on this
[1:41:04] promise that was given to Our Father
[1:41:05] Abraham that we're going to go out of
[1:41:07] here and we're going to be delivered and
[1:41:09] what did he do he went up there and
[1:41:10] prayed and he would go up there and pray
[1:41:12] and he would go up there and pray and he
[1:41:14] would go up there and pray to you hear
[1:41:16] what I'm saying to you Deliverance is on
[1:41:18] its way you believe it because a prophet
[1:41:20] said that you could go free
[1:41:22] okay
[1:41:23] you didn't see receive a prophecy that
[1:41:26] told you that you're going to have to
[1:41:27] live in the same condition that your
[1:41:29] mama lived in but you received a
[1:41:31] prophecy that said you could go free
[1:41:37] and amram kept praying
[1:41:39] and Silas kept praying and Joshua kept
[1:41:42] praying and this brother kept praying
[1:41:44] and that sister kept praying and one day
[1:41:47] amaran got up there and he got to
[1:41:49] praying and he rubbed his eyes and he
[1:41:51] seen an angel standing in the corner
[1:41:54] what did the angel say Deliverance is
[1:41:57] coming amram it was a sign what was
[1:41:59] spoken to Abraham
[1:42:01] what's coming to fruition in the body of
[1:42:04] Moses and what's been given to the
[1:42:06] Church of the Living God exactly what
[1:42:08] William Branham saw complete deliverance
[1:42:13] don't give up keep pressing keep
[1:42:17] pressing press the battle press the
[1:42:20] battle keep praying keep reading keep
[1:42:23] listening to them tapes I didn't listen
[1:42:24] to them listen to them again
[1:42:26] [Applause]
[1:42:32] brother random would say now look he
[1:42:33] said he'd say he said now I said I know
[1:42:35] I'm battling it he said I know I'm
[1:42:37] battling he said I'm trying to make a
[1:42:38] footstep he said but before I can make a
[1:42:41] footstep he said I gotta cut loose of
[1:42:42] every tangle every green bar and
[1:42:44] everything else that gets in my way he
[1:42:46] said but every time you make a step
[1:42:48] you're advancing forward don't you feel
[1:42:50] bad
[1:42:51] when you only take one step
[1:42:54] don't you feel bad when you only call
[1:42:56] overcome one time the righteous man can
[1:42:58] fall but get back up
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:03] if you're taking one foot step you made
[1:43:06] it into the building didn't you
[1:43:13] you made it into the building didn't you
[1:43:15] so the devil didn't have enough to keep
[1:43:18] you out of this service
[1:43:20] so we ain't got enough to keep you from
[1:43:23] your Victory to keep you from your
[1:43:25] Liberty
[1:43:29] there's a son of man that is raising the
[1:43:32] bride's expectation to believe you're
[1:43:34] not feeding on the mind of a man but
[1:43:36] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:43:38] word or the son of man it ain't my words
[1:43:41] it ain't William branham's word it's a
[1:43:43] message of the angel
[1:43:52] you remember when
[1:43:53] William Branham I think it's amazing if
[1:43:55] you ain't watched it in a while
[1:43:56] Philip go watch it but you go there and
[1:43:59] you'll see there when William randomly
[1:44:01] is standing there in 20th century
[1:44:03] prophet and you watch him it's amazing
[1:44:05] to watch he's standing there
[1:44:07] and the and the angel of the Lord goes
[1:44:09] to working
[1:44:10] but notice when he's standing there he's
[1:44:12] dealing with this one sister and he
[1:44:14] begins to speak to her
[1:44:15] he said
[1:44:16] he said I see you got that that heart
[1:44:18] trouble there I see you've got that
[1:44:20] heart trouble there he said he said it's
[1:44:22] a black curtain a black shadow that
[1:44:23] keeps following you keeps following you
[1:44:25] here and there he said oh

[1:44:50] attention to what them people are saying
[1:44:51] it's nothing but a lie go on he said it

[1:49:56] see I ain't got very much left brother
[1:49:58] Andrew all the woman had left in her
[1:50:01] house was a little bit of oil but it was
[1:50:03] enough
[1:50:04] it was enough
[1:50:06] it's enough for you and it's enough for
[1:50:08] you the message is all you need you
[1:50:10] don't need to be looking on this website
[1:50:12] or that website look to where your
[1:50:14] strength comes from
[1:50:18] young people I know what it's like
[1:50:20] I know what it's like to live under the
[1:50:21] bondage of Satan but I know what it's
[1:50:23] like to be free
[1:50:27] and if I thought for one moment that you
[1:50:29] had to stay here bound
[1:50:31] I wouldn't be here
[1:50:35] I know
[1:50:37] I know
[1:50:39] you can go free
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:43] a lot of you don't know my story and I'm
[1:50:45] not going to take the time to tell it to
[1:50:47] you but I'm a whole lot worse off I was
[1:50:49] a whole lot more worse off than a lot of
[1:50:51] you here
[1:50:55] but the God that I know
[1:50:57] has been circling in this tent all week
[1:51:00] long
[1:51:02] and he's been looking for you
[1:51:05] because what you have is exactly what
[1:51:07] he's looking for
[1:51:11] what do you have to offer to him
[1:51:14] give him your life
[1:51:17] your life peace give him your dreams
[1:51:19] give him your Ambitions well that's all
[1:51:22] I got left give it to him
[1:51:24] watch The Miraculous take place when you
[1:51:27] take what you think it is enough
[1:51:34] what happened
[1:51:35] the lamb is the answer notice when John
[1:51:38] is standing there in Revelations chapter
[1:51:40] 5 and he said there was no man found in
[1:51:43] heaven on Earth that was found worthy no
[1:51:45] man on Heaven no man in the earth no man
[1:51:48] beneath the Earth that ever lived and
[1:51:49] died was found worthy no man was found
[1:51:51] worthy but the Angels call was for the
[1:51:54] Kinsmen Redeemer to appear and God said
[1:51:56] I have a law a kinsman redeemer can be a
[1:51:59] substitute where is that Kinsmen
[1:52:01] Redeemer who's able to take it and it
[1:52:04] come from Adam all the way down through
[1:52:05] all the proposters and Prophets and
[1:52:07] everything else and nobody was found now
[1:52:10] what about that nobody in heaven nobody
[1:52:13] in the earth nobody that ever lived you
[1:52:16] see that's the reason that John was
[1:52:17] weeping because if no one could get that
[1:52:19] book of title back all of creation was
[1:52:22] lost everything was lost but our Boaz
[1:52:26] seen something in you that was worth
[1:52:29] redeeming when Satan stuck his dirty
[1:52:32] hands on you God saw something on the
[1:52:34] inside of you that was worth living out
[1:52:37] when Satan ensnared you in sin and
[1:52:39] pornography and depression and anxiety
[1:52:41] and every fear that comes along with
[1:52:43] Leon I see a spear our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:45] so that you is worth setting free
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:49] what did Boaz do when he saw Ruth what
[1:52:53] does Ruth do she said out there under
[1:52:55] the inspiration of Boaz and she watched
[1:52:58] when she began to Garner things that she
[1:53:01] couldn't necessarily go on her own but
[1:53:03] because moaz Boaz was a mighty man of
[1:53:06] wealth he had some men that were sitting
[1:53:08] there he had some Ministry that was
[1:53:10] dealing with his bride
[1:53:13] before she ever looked like his bride he
[1:53:15] was dealing with her be ever before she
[1:53:17] ever looked like she was in the picture
[1:53:18] he was dealing with her before she ever
[1:53:21] got set free from her moabite title he
[1:53:23] was dealing with her and before you ever
[1:53:25] felt the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:27] come in this building tonight he's had
[1:53:29] some men begin to deal with you by the
[1:53:32] preaching of the message of the hour
[1:53:33] what are you Ruth I'm telling you to
[1:53:36] tonight is your night for a title change
[1:53:39] you will no longer be known as
[1:53:41] ruthermore about it but you will be
[1:53:43] known
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:45] as Ruth the wife of Boaz
[1:53:49] but if you get to studying out the Bible
[1:53:51] you'll find you'll find there in Ruth
[1:53:54] chapter four and five that there was a
[1:53:57] nearer Kinsman than Boaz but you
[1:54:00] remember what Boaz begins to he begins
[1:54:02] to go out there and he goes into a
[1:54:04] public place and he stands out there and
[1:54:07] here comes the near a Kinsmen and that's
[1:54:09] what William Brandon would say there was
[1:54:10] a near a Kinsman to us this sin nature
[1:54:13] that we had upon us there Satan was a
[1:54:15] nearer Kinsman to him but notice notice
[1:54:18] what Boaz does he goes out there and he
[1:54:21] tells him will you redeem Naomi's at
[1:54:24] land
[1:54:25] what does the Bible say what does he say
[1:54:28] he said I will redeem it but Boaz comes
[1:54:32] behind it he said if you redeem it
[1:54:34] you've got to also redeem you've got to
[1:54:36] redeem Naomi and you've got to redeem
[1:54:39] Ruth as well and you've got to raise up
[1:54:41] seed unto Ruth unto her dead inheritance
[1:54:44] and the man that was a near a Kinsman
[1:54:46] said I can't do it because I I want I
[1:54:49] will not mourn my inheritance so you see
[1:54:51] what he was saying I don't have the
[1:54:54] strength
[1:54:55] you see what this nearer Kinsman wanted

[2:04:00] God's word that sets you free
[2:04:03] [Applause]

[2:04:08] he was he was going down a dark alley
[2:04:11] and he said I was just kind of Shadow
[2:04:12] Boxing and bouncing around going down
[2:04:15] through there and he said all of a
[2:04:17] sudden this dog came up out of nowhere
[2:04:18] and it began to bite at me and brother
[2:04:20] Brandon said I hollered get away from me
[2:04:22] dog and he said when I said that he said
[2:04:24] when I said that that dog turned into a
[2:04:27] great big giant of a man a spirit rose
[2:04:30] up out of there he said what did you say
[2:04:32] to me and brother about him began to
[2:04:34] apologize
[2:04:35] he said I'm sorry he said I thought you
[2:04:37] was a dog and brother Brandon said that
[2:04:39] that that Spirit he said it looked like
[2:04:41] a demon he said to begin to back him up
[2:04:43] into a culvert
[2:04:44] backed him up into a culvert and he
[2:04:47] pulled out a knife and said I'm going to
[2:04:48] kill you
[2:04:49] but notice brother Madam said now he
[2:04:51] said he said now
[2:04:53] well I'm not afraid to die
[2:04:55] he said because I've already received
[2:04:57] Jesus Christ and he said when I said
[2:04:58] that
[2:04:59] He said Out of Heaven Come whirling a
[2:05:02] mighty Angel and stood by my side and
[2:05:05] then he said when I see he said he stood
[2:05:07] by my side he said that man took off and
[2:05:10] ran for cover dropped the knife and ran
[2:05:12] for cover
[2:05:14] he said the angel was sent for your
[2:05:16] protection and you might be nervous
[2:05:18] about this but the angel is here for
[2:05:20] your protection you might be you must
[2:05:22] say the Devils of hell that have trapped
[2:05:25] you in your mind and have trapped you in
[2:05:27] your sins
[2:05:28] but the mighty Angel is here he's at the
[2:05:31] pulpit and he's here to set you free
[2:05:42] oh but I've suffered so much but we have
[2:05:44] a redeemer
[2:05:47] that's what William Branham would say in
[2:05:48] the seventh seal but the seventh seal
[2:05:50] was a sign that it was the end of all
[2:05:52] suffering and you may have suffered for
[2:05:54] a long time but we've not John we have a
[2:05:56] redeemer
[2:05:57] it's over John
[2:05:59] it's over John what does William Branham
[2:06:01] do when he comes to Revelation chapter
[2:06:03] one he said unto him that loved us and
[2:06:05] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[2:06:07] but William Branham Taps into that in
[2:06:09] the church age book he said that word
[2:06:11] washed us he said it means loosed us he
[2:06:14] said the blood has loosed us he said the
[2:06:16] blood has loosed you from the powers and
[2:06:19] the bondage of sin he said so if the
[2:06:21] blood is perfect and loosing he said
[2:06:24] then the loosing is perfect and the
[2:06:26] loosing is complete what is it you are
[2:06:29] loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ you
[2:06:31] was captive but Christ set you free you
[2:06:34] were cursed but Jesus Christ made you
[2:06:36] free and loose you from the Dominion of
[2:06:38] Satan you were weak but Jesus made you
[2:06:41] strong we were bound and imprisoned but
[2:06:44] Christ set us free from slavery we were
[2:06:46] sick but now we are healed why don't you
[2:06:49] claim your Liberty
[2:06:51] why don't you accept your deliverance
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:55] why don't you say Satan you are not my
[2:06:58] master
[2:07:00] that's what William Brandon would tell
[2:07:03] us when they go to read in first John
[2:07:04] chapter 5 and 4 for whichever is born of
[2:07:06] God overcometh the world and this is a
[2:07:08] victory that overcometh the world even
[2:07:09] our faith he said faith is the victory
[2:07:11] that overcomes Every curse of the devil
[2:07:13] faith is a victory faith in what not
[2:07:16] faith in your church not faith in your
[2:07:18] Creed not faith in some man but faith in
[2:07:20] Jesus Christ who made the promise he
[2:07:22] said that's the victory what is it it's
[2:07:24] the victory say my arms still crippled
[2:07:26] but faith is the victory I still feel
[2:07:28] sick but faith is a victory oh it
[2:07:31] overcomes the world and when you can
[2:07:33] climb into God by prayer until you see
[2:07:36] the thing conquered under you there is
[2:07:38] nothing that can hurt you then you're
[2:07:40] overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow
[2:07:42] Room you're selling free then you who
[2:07:45] have been a drunkard and a slave to
[2:07:47] Whiskey you'll be a master over him then
[2:07:49] that Old Devil of alcohol that made you
[2:07:52] drink he's your master now but when you
[2:07:54] get that faith
[2:07:55] [Applause]
[2:07:59] when you get that kind of faith not a
[2:08:01] make-belief but a real faith then that
[2:08:04] devil is your servant then
[2:08:07] you see you see if Satan's got a hold of
[2:08:10] you he is holding you by an illegal
[2:08:13] possession
[2:08:14] but if we are Jesus
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:19] if we are Jesus then Satan is binding
[2:08:22] his own master
[2:08:33] it's getting good in here
[2:08:37] I hear chains falling
[2:08:44] FF Bosworth said any believer can be a
[2:08:48] devil Master overnight
[2:08:51] you've been ready you've been LED around
[2:08:53] the circus by that monkey for his power
[2:08:56] far too long why don't you start taking
[2:08:58] the chain that he's been jerking on you
[2:09:00] and jerk him into the fire it's a
[2:09:02] contest pull that monkey back into the
[2:09:05] fire

[2:09:10] leash he can only go so far and you have
[2:09:13] been built to go all the way not just
[2:09:15] automobile faith not just horse and
[2:09:17] buggy Faith but an astronaut Faith to
[2:09:20] believe that all things are possible

[2:09:35] make you free
[2:09:46] hey
[2:09:49] I've been in chains before but I have
[2:09:51] found that no matter the condition that
[2:09:53] I am in if I can just learn to turn my
[2:09:56] faith loose
[2:09:57] and begin to praise what did Paul and
[2:10:00] Silas do they praised they praised their
[2:10:03] way out of the problem they praised
[2:10:05] their way out of their complex they
[2:10:07] praised their way out of pornography
[2:10:08] they praised their way out of fear they
[2:10:10] praised their way out of anxiety they
[2:10:12] praised their way out of them anxiety
[2:10:14] chains of fear that was rolling over top
[2:10:16] of him what did they do they begin to
[2:10:18] sing about the Midnight Hour and the
[2:10:21] evening time begin to shine upon them
[2:10:22] and they begin to pray and they begin to
[2:10:25] praise and they begin to sing Psalms
[2:10:27] what do you got to do young people you
[2:10:29] got to thank God for what he's going to
[2:10:31] do for you before you ever see it done
[2:10:35] and when they begin to sing change begin
[2:10:38] to fall and all the bands were loosed
[2:10:42] oh
[2:10:43] you don't know what you're doing in here
[2:10:45] but there's some people behind you that
[2:10:47] are watching you
[2:10:50] that came here to this camp with you and
[2:10:52] saw the bondage that you were in
[2:10:55] when you came here
[2:10:57] and they see you working to get yourself
[2:11:00] free
[2:11:01] and it's encouraging them behind you
[2:11:06] that they can go free too
[2:11:16] Lily it's going to be a good night
[2:11:21] he gonna be a good night in this place
[2:11:25] he gonna be a good night in this place
[2:11:27] it's gonna be a good night in this place
[2:11:30] because our Lord Jesus Christ has come
[2:11:32] all the way from glory and the pillar of
[2:11:35] fire has been circling around this room
[2:11:37] to make sure that you don't go back to
[2:11:39] the hell hole you came out of he's come
[2:11:41] here with a purpose tonight to set you
[2:11:43] free
[2:11:49] ah
[2:11:52] with Jesus
[2:11:54] so this woman
[2:11:58] he was
[2:11:59] teaching in the synagogue
[2:12:02] and he saw her
[2:12:07] bound
[2:12:08] for 18 years
[2:12:11] what does he do he addresses her
[2:12:14] by her gender
[2:12:17] a woman
[2:12:20] he immediately identifies her heritage
[2:12:24] this daughter of Abraham
[2:12:29] hath been bound
[2:12:31] by this devil
[2:12:34] for 18 years
[2:12:37] living with the same thing
[2:12:46] living with the same thing
[2:12:48] brother Andrew you don't know where I am
[2:12:50] I'm the only one in my youth group I'm
[2:12:52] the only one in my family that believes
[2:12:55] Bound for 18 years
[2:12:59] but you don't know who's in the room
[2:13:03] he's talking to you he's called you by
[2:13:05] who you are woman you're the body of
[2:13:09] Jesus Christ you wear your crown with
[2:13:12] dignity
[2:13:14] and you've been looking at your problems
[2:13:16] completely wrong
[2:13:20] this demon had bound her so much that
[2:13:23] the only thing that she could see
[2:13:27] was defeat
[2:13:30] change everybody else all she could see
[2:13:32] was other people dancing in the spirit
[2:13:34] all she could see was other people
[2:13:35] getting their Victory all she could see
[2:13:38] was other people and you see when you
[2:13:40] when you get in this kind of condition
[2:13:43] a lot of things you can be told
[2:13:46] by people's shoes
[2:13:51] you begin to look at their shoes and you
[2:13:54] begin to
[2:13:55] I see I
[2:13:57] they've got that's that person knows
[2:13:59] what it's like to have a nice home and
[2:14:01] live in Victory and
[2:14:04] that person must really know what it's
[2:14:06] like to have an overcoming life
[2:14:09] you see you can learn a lot by looking
[2:14:11] and walking in somebody else's shoes
[2:14:16] but when Jesus begins to talk to her
[2:14:20] he doesn't draw her attention lower
[2:14:24] he draws her attention to another Realm
[2:14:28] a realm that she hasn't experienced
[2:14:31] around that she hasn't noticed that it
[2:14:33] was for her
[2:14:35] she only recognized it was for others
[2:14:38] but when Jesus gets done with this woman
[2:14:42] she does not recognize herself as a
[2:14:45] denomination that has to live and change
[2:14:48] anymore she recognizes that he has taken
[2:14:51] her faith to see that he was her victory
[2:14:55] what does he do he takes her vision and
[2:14:59] turns it towards him what does this
[2:15:01] message do it turns you away from your
[2:15:04] problems it turns you away it turns you
[2:15:07] away from your fear
[2:15:11] look up
[2:15:12] look up
[2:15:14] your redemption's in the room

[2:15:37] now I know what the Bible says in Joshua
[2:15:39] chapter 10 that they came in there and
[2:15:42] they took him out of the cave that they
[2:15:43] found them in and they smote them and
[2:15:46] killed them and hung them up there on
[2:15:48] all their trees so let's take pride
[2:15:51] let's take pornography let's take fear
[2:15:54] let's take complexes let's take anxiety
[2:15:59] they was hiding in that cave they were
[2:16:02] holding you bound they were holding you
[2:16:04] in that cave
[2:16:05] what are you gonna do with them
[2:16:07] put them back in the same cave
[2:16:10] roll the stone back over the cave
[2:16:14] roll them back over there and the Bible
[2:16:16] said that they took great stones and
[2:16:19] rolled them back in their place and
[2:16:21] they're still there
[2:16:24] don't you get to digging up them old
[2:16:26] bones don't you get to digging up them
[2:16:29] Stones they're still there
[2:16:33] fear still there depression's still
[2:16:35] there anxiety still there leave it under
[2:16:38] the blood
[2:16:39] [Applause]
[2:16:58] who miracles in the room
[2:17:03] I can't tell you how many times I've
[2:17:05] seen miracles from behind this pulpit
[2:17:11] foreign
[2:17:20] but nothing is impossible
[2:17:23] to them that believe
[2:17:24] [Music]
[2:17:30] Bethany in here
[2:17:36] my sister Bethany
[2:17:41] I ain't got my glasses on guys y'all
[2:17:42] gonna have to help me out
[2:17:47] not that sister Bethany
[2:17:50] that's my other sister Bethany
[2:17:56] Bethany Hatfield I'm talking about The
[2:17:59] Real McCoy
[2:18:03] they both sitting right there
[2:18:05] praise the Lord
[2:18:21] hitting nice knowing you too
[2:18:26] but in this room
[2:18:28] Miracles take place
[2:18:31] I watched this boy right here
[2:18:35] I watch this boy right here
[2:18:37] be so led by the Holy Spirit
[2:18:40] and there's a lot of people that make
[2:18:41] fun of dancing
[2:18:43] and say we shouldn't do it no more
[2:18:46] but this is one guy that I have seen the
[2:18:49] spirit of the Lord take him and use him
[2:18:50] in a dance
[2:18:53] when I watched at that that platform
[2:18:57] when there were people slain in the
[2:18:58] spirit all over there and the spirit of
[2:19:00] the Lord work over this boy and
[2:19:02] completely dance around every single one
[2:19:04] of them with his eyes closed
[2:19:06] so don't tell me God doesn't work in a
[2:19:08] dance no more
[2:19:11] but last year in this camp
[2:19:13] in this Camp there was a vision shown
[2:19:16] that there was going to be a lady
[2:19:22] that would bring forth a son
[2:19:24] and it would be in this camp that they
[2:19:26] would dedicate this son
[2:19:29] and I come all the way back with this
[2:19:32] message
[2:19:34] the Bethany
[2:19:35] that this son is a sign that your
[2:19:39] approach is rolled away
[2:19:57] this lady
[2:20:02] this lady
[2:20:04] was covered up
[2:20:06] with more problems with more things on
[2:20:08] her that were so heavy that she couldn't
[2:20:10] lift up on her own
[2:20:12] but my Lord Jesus saw her
[2:20:17] he saw her when it was more than she
[2:20:19] could bear
[2:20:24] and he's a Bethany I am your deliverance
[2:20:33] oh
[2:20:34] it's a lie
[2:20:43] it was in this camp
[2:20:45] that God saw you
[2:20:48] and he said I'm coming to your house
[2:20:50] tonight
[2:20:56] and you didn't know what it meant
[2:21:00] but he came and so filled your daughter
[2:21:03] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:21:09] that God would do a supernatural event
[2:21:12] for True Word Tabernacle that God would
[2:21:15] raise up a little girl that Satan has
[2:21:18] done his very best to destroy and to
[2:21:20] keep her in her bondage and keep her in
[2:21:22] her fear that even though she feels it
[2:21:25] and even though it's there she still
[2:21:27] raises her hands she refuses to listen
[2:21:30] to The Devil's lie she refuses
[2:21:34] Satan I want you to hear me I resent
[2:21:37] your coming I refuse for you to hold
[2:21:39] these children any longer they are not
[2:21:42] your subjects they are Almighty God's
[2:21:44] subjects and tonight is your night where
[2:21:47] you lose them once and for all you're
[2:21:50] not going to stay in your bondage and
[2:21:52] you're not going to stay in your sin
[2:21:53] what happened to you back there when
[2:21:56] nobody
[2:22:00] when you didn't know it he was already
[2:22:03] there
[2:22:03] [Applause]
[2:22:06] and I took you to college and it may
[2:22:08] have put you in a hell hole and it may
[2:22:10] have put you in a trap and you didn't
[2:22:11] think he was going to get your way out
[2:22:12] of it but the blood of Jesus Christ put
[2:22:15] a robe around you
[2:22:16] he protected you when you were when you
[2:22:19] were sorry
[2:22:22] I'm sorry but when you are most
[2:22:24] vulnerable the blood protected you
[2:22:33] and my Lord Jesus
[2:22:36] has World in this building
[2:22:39] and you're in a vulnerable spot
[2:22:43] you're in your condition
[2:22:46] but I want to testify
[2:22:50] I want to testify
[2:22:52] you're not leaving here the same way you
[2:22:54] walked in here
[2:23:02] it was in this Camp last year
[2:23:05] that my my Lord Jesus Christ
[2:23:09] came and talked to my sweet wife
[2:23:12] and told her that she was going to
[2:23:14] experience the Lord in a new way
[2:23:17] I watched my wife before she was my wife
[2:23:20] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:23:22] it was one of the most powerful things I
[2:23:24] ever got to see and I think it's amazing
[2:23:25] that God would allow me
[2:23:28] to watch a girl that wouldn't hardly
[2:23:31] give me the time of day
[2:23:35] get filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:23:39] it's one of the sweetest things that
[2:23:40] I've treasured in my life
[2:23:44] but the Lord revealed something to me in
[2:23:46] this camp
[2:23:47] that God was going to allow her to
[2:23:49] experience the Lord in a new way
[2:23:52] and I thought it was going to happen at
[2:23:54] this Camp I I really did
[2:23:57] but a week later
[2:24:00] there was a man that came to our Labor
[2:24:02] Day meetings by the name of Tim Pruitt
[2:24:03] and preached on investigating angels
[2:24:05] that the angel has came and investigated
[2:24:08] our faith man you talking about a
[2:24:10] supernatural meeting
[2:24:12] we got to drive him back home and the
[2:24:14] spirit of the Lord got in our car
[2:24:18] I jumped out of the car when I got to my
[2:24:19] driveway
[2:24:21] started speaking in tongues and rolling
[2:24:23] around in the grass
[2:24:25] and then all of a sudden the Lord began
[2:24:27] to move
[2:24:29] and he said Katie this is it
[2:24:32] this is a girl that's very sensitive to
[2:24:34] the presence of the Lord
[2:24:38] very sensitive
[2:24:41] but all of a sudden
[2:24:43] there came an angel whirling through
[2:24:45] that car she busted out of that car
[2:24:47] started dancing and speaking in tongues
[2:24:51] and brother Tim Pruitt that night had
[2:24:52] read from Genesis Chapter 18 where
[2:24:56] Abraham met Elohim underneath an oak
[2:25:00] and when my wife brother Wayne got done
[2:25:03] rolling around that grass she was
[2:25:05] underneath an oak tree
[2:25:08] I want you to know that the spirit of
[2:25:10] the Living God that dealt with me last
[2:25:12] year
[2:25:14] has dealt with me again and told me to
[2:25:16] tell you that tonight is a very special
[2:25:18] night what you have never experienced in
[2:25:21] the Holy Ghost tonight you will
[2:25:23] experience
[2:25:36] I don't care what you try to limit
[2:25:38] I don't care what you try to do there is
[2:25:41] no limitations you can put on my God
[2:25:42] [Applause]
[2:25:43] [Music]
[2:25:46] last week I was up in Cloverdale a pair
[2:25:49] of brother bicycle's camp
[2:25:51] and I as I was preaching the spirit of
[2:25:53] the Lord moved over top of me and
[2:25:55] I said today there's going to be a
[2:25:56] miracle and I'll I honestly wanted to
[2:25:58] put my hand over my mouth because I
[2:26:00] thought oh Lord
[2:26:02] what's going on here
[2:26:06] but it wasn't me that said it
[2:26:10] I don't have the time to tell you
[2:26:12] tonight a miracle after Miracle after
[2:26:14] Miracle after miracle that happened in
[2:26:17] that place
[2:26:18] where the spirit of the Living God began
[2:26:20] to operate in there and people that were
[2:26:22] under bondage of skin conditions people
[2:26:25] that were under the bondage of demonic
[2:26:27] Powers were set free people that had
[2:26:29] been away from God
[2:26:30] for a very long time people that had
[2:26:32] been under bondage of marriage problems
[2:26:35] were set free
[2:26:37] because there was a prophecy that was
[2:26:39] told that America was going to happen
[2:26:40] and tonight your miracles in the room
[2:26:45] there you go
[2:26:54] now we're getting ready to go
[2:26:58] to this prayer line
[2:27:06] and I want you to come here under great
[2:27:07] anticipation

[2:27:21] you're loosed

[2:27:31] upon you
[2:27:33] is often
[2:27:35] amen

[2:28:10] presence in the midst and he's here
[2:28:12] because he's promised to be here he's
[2:28:14] here and identified himself he's the
[2:28:16] same Lord Jesus that walked into Galilee
[2:28:18] and you believe he can he keeps all of
[2:28:20] his word and because somebody a Believer

[2:28:29] and you resent Satan holding you any
[2:28:31] longer your faith goes loose to believe

[2:29:26] doubt it break that spell of unbelief
[2:29:28] from around you let the Holy Ghost take
[2:29:31] possession
[2:29:38] now I know you'll come here with real
[2:29:40] needs
[2:29:43] and the words already told you who you
[2:29:45] are
[2:29:49] but now will you believe
[2:29:54] the Bible said to lay hands on the sick
[2:29:58] and they shall recover
[2:30:03] it doesn't matter when it happens
[2:30:06] they shall recover
[2:30:09] these men of God that will stand here in
[2:30:12] this line
[2:30:14] it'll be like you walking under the Ark
[2:30:17] of the Covenant
[2:30:19] as their hands are laid upon you
[2:30:22] you are walking under the Blessed word
[2:30:24] of God that men that you're not
[2:30:26] approaching just men
[2:30:28] these are men that are under a Priestly
[2:30:31] order
[2:30:33] they cast out demons
[2:30:35] and they have to go
[2:30:40] but I want to be real serious with you
[2:30:42] here
[2:30:44] if you are in bondage
[2:30:48] and you love being in bondage
[2:30:52] learn to hate it
[2:30:55] because if you don't hate it you're
[2:30:57] going to leave here the same way you
[2:30:59] walk in here
[2:31:00] I have the power to cast those demons
[2:31:03] off of you but you got to keep them off

[2:31:13] homosexual Spirit hate that lust devil
[2:31:16] hate that problem hate that Pride hate
[2:31:18] that anxiety hate that fear if you come
[2:31:21] in here with that kind of if you come in
[2:31:24] here with that kind of hate against the
[2:31:26] devil that has robbed you over and over
[2:31:29] and over and over again if you come in
[2:31:32] there with that kind of hatred against
[2:31:33] that devil you will leave here
[2:31:36] completely free
[2:31:43] until you learn to hate it
[2:31:46] you'll learn to live with it all your
[2:31:48] life but if you hate it whom the sun is
[2:31:51] set free it's free indeed and the Bible
[2:31:55] would tell us to stand fast in our
[2:31:57] Liberty where Christ has made us free
[2:31:59] and the Bible said there is therefore
[2:32:01] now no condemnation to them that are in
[2:32:04] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[2:32:06] Flesh and who shall lay anything to the
[2:32:10] charge of God's elect it is God that
[2:32:13] justifies it is God that called it is
[2:32:16] God that made you clean
[2:32:20] so you do me a favor
[2:32:23] hate the demon that's been chasing you
[2:32:32] back and forth
[2:32:34] but today you take a step forward
[2:32:36] to never go back to it again

[2:33:03] I'm helpless without him I'm hopeless
[2:33:05] without him
[2:33:07] but he would say oh
[2:33:10] here he is here he comes
[2:33:13] and I now take every Spirit under my
[2:33:15] control
[2:33:17] he would say now he said you let Satan
[2:33:19] take after one of God's children
[2:33:23] and Satan's got Jesus Christ on his
[2:33:25] hands
