TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I love him. [singing and music] I love him [music] because [singing] he first [music] love [singing] me. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, is [music] my sal [singing] [music] [music] [music] We are [singing] love. [music] I [music] love him because [singing] he [music] first love &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. [singing] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. It's certainly a great honor to be gathered in the house of the Lord together and amen to see all the saints that [music] would be able to be out here this morning. Amen. And the blessing of the Lord. Amen. In our lives, his grace in our heart and Amen. What a what a tremendous time to serve the Lord with your families and [music] and the life that he's given us. Uh I think of the prophet when he says that there would this would be the day the greatest [music] day that it would be to serve him. He said I'd rather do it right now. And I think of all the ages and all the wonderful things that had happened down through the years. And then I think of a prophet that saw by vision many of the things that you read about in the Bible. And then he still said that this is the greatest time to live. So I I I think that it was a very informed [music] saying. So whatever he was seeing, I pray often, Lord, let me see what [music] he saw that makes him say things like that that that we would be able in this great dark hour and time that we'd be able to catch what it is, what kind of inspiration was on a prophet to make him say something of such of such powerful uh words. Amen. It's a as a a great blessing to be able to be together with the children of God. And uh I think I see [music] Canada showed up over here. And brother Jake, Amen. He's one of our he's one of our Canadian sheep. Amen. God bless you, brother Jake. And Amen. Sure. Welcome to be here this morning. And I think he brought a friend with him this time. God bless you, brother Jonathan. Sure. Good to see you today. And Amen. We're uh so blessed that they're able to be here. He gets to come down a couple times a year. So we we certainly love him and appreciate him. [music] Glad he could be here. and and all of you that are here this morning. I I got a niece here this morning just saying for you. It's sure good to have them here and Amen. They come up to visit us once in a while and Amen. I think the kids make [music] it hard on them to go home and Amen. But uh but uh we sure want to love everybody in a certain way and Amen. I I wish that there was room. Amen. and uh uh that you could you could spend as much time with every individual all the time every day and show love cuz this is to my heart uh the bride of Christ is the greatest thing on the face of the earth the cream [music] of the crop as a prophet would call it and amen and I I think you deserve the best. Amen. because you are the best. And I certainly believe that of of whatever the Lord has purchased with his own blood is quite precious. And we want to thank you for your time today. [music] We have a few things upon our heart. And we want to take some time this morning in the book of Hebrews. Um I uh I certainly uh appreciate the Lord for what he's been opening to us. And we have been preaching along and uh I think brother Carrie said we could just park here a while. So we we took you at it, Brother Carrie. We just parked in there and just staying on it a while. And so we're going to be in Hebrews chapter 9 this morning. Amen. And uh uh [clears throat] this is this is a scripture uh that uh has has been a great inspiration to me through the years of studying the message of the hour. And it's odd to me how that uh things that that you might study regularly and not maybe realize the the weight of what you're actually reading until you start really nailing it down. And uh in a few years ago, this really took fire to me personally. And so, but as we're in the book of Hebrews, uh I want to cover this this morning from the 9th chapter in the 28th verse. Amen. And just before we read, let's just bow our hearts. Father, we're so thankful this morning, Lord, that you would give us the grace to stand here before your children today, Lord, as we stand here as a people. We look to you, Lord, knowing that, Father, that your grace and your mercy, Lord, the desire of our heart, Lord, is to be exactly what you'd have us to be. And Lord, we're asking you this morning that you would take from our heart all tradition, Lord. May you take from us all of our previous conceptions and mindsets, Lord. And may Lord, you come by this way today. Illuminate our hearts. Father, fill our minds with revelation and wisdom. And Lord, give us what it is that would strengthen us in your mercies, Father. Now, we invite you into this. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. In Hebrews chapter 9 and the 28th verse, so Christ once was offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that look, for him shall he appear, the second time without sin unto salvation. May God bless his word. You could be seated this morning. Uh I want to speak from that uh phrase this morning. Unto them that look for him, he shall appear. Unto them that look for him, he shall appear. This is out of the Hebrew series, but it's as normal. We're trying to take an a context so that you could you could look upon it. Um I very rarely use other um from the pullpit. Anyhow, use other translations. I like this one though, a New International Version. Uh and I want you just listen to the way that they read it. I I like the way it said. So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many and he will appear a second time not to bear sin but to bring salvation. Uh in the King James version of course it says the same thing but the reading of it sometimes uh you look at it and you go what does he mean by that? He shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation. It means that when he appears the second time, he's not appearing uh to bear our sins, but he's appearing to bring salvation. Of course, this has a lot to do with what we've been studying on Melazdc when he appeared unto Abraham. Melazdc had both wine and bread, but there was no lamb. Showing you that he had went and redeemed Lot and had brought him back and had was serving communion rather than sacrificing a lamb. And so we see part of the coming uh of Melkazedc in the end time and how uh that Paul says here uh that he will appear. Now Paul in Hebrews 9 has covered strongly uh the revelation of Melchazdc. But he said really you can't bear what I've got to say about this. Uh but there is coming a people uh that will receive the revelation of Melazdc that will be so effective that when I appear they'll be able to see me. Amen. And so to them that that look for him. Now to behold it means to appear is actually means to take heed or to take notice to to to um to appear. Uh is is it deals with something that it basically he's showing himself. Uh this word look for actually means to eagerly await. And I like this one to expect fully. &gt;&gt; Those that expect fully the Lord uh they shall see him. Amen. them that expect fully. Those that are eagerly awaiting, they're expecting fully. Now, when I when I look at this, of course, it's the same type of word out of the book of Romans, the 8th chapter, where it says creation believers, they eagerly wait for the manifestation of the sons. The whole thing waiteth. When you're uh reading scriptures, a lot of times it talks about a waiting period uh as being that someone is waiting or someone is looking. And and of course after Paul is speaking of this, he's saying that those that are waiting are looking for Christ to appear uh not to bring an end to sin to sacrifice himself like he did the first, but this will be uh based upon that he will bring salvation. Now here in uh expectations, brother Bam says an expectation has to be built on something uh that's got faith behind it. Because if you're expecting something, it's because something's been promised or or some way like that. So if you want to have a real expectation, it's got to be built upon thus saith the Lord. So in other words, if you're really expecting something, it's based on something. If I tell you, hey, I'm going to do certain certain thing for you. Well, you have an expectation, but that's because that I promised you something or I said something that made you expect it. So I'm I'm not talking to entitled people. I'm talking to people that has been a promise has been made to them uh by the word of God. So, we're not just entitled. We're not just uh uh uh you know, I mean, we're not just sitting around saying, "Well, God owes me something." But this is God's idea. He's the one uh that brought it up, you know, years ago. And you forgive me if you don't like Disney. and and and and but years ago when my my kids were small, we took them down to Disney and and and we couldn't really uh uh afford all of it. But we seen a big sign and said that if you know you could stay cheap and this and this and all you had to do is go to this one little probably's never been to these sales events, but but it was a what it really is is they give you a free ticket nearly and a free room to come and sit into a hour and a half or something like that to listen to a sales market like that. and and uh and so I got led in there by a sign, you know, um and and I took what they gave me. And when I got in there, the guy's talking to me, he's talking about all of it. And I said, "Well, I'm sorry. I'm probably not going to buy anything." He said, "Sorry." He said, "We trapped you in here. We we brought you in here by the sign. You didn't ask to come. We brought you in here so I can try to sell you." And I said, "That's right. I I that's right." And and and you hear Brother Brandham talk about Christians uh that they're brought in by Christ. It's not that. It's really not that you sought it. You thought you did, but you didn't really. Something something brought you. Something something attracted your attention. Something was given to make you want to. And there's things offered and you might feel, but yet there is an expectation. And that expectation comes from promise. And and now brother Brandon will tell us this. Amen. It comes from promise. Now uh when brother Ram deals with this particular scripture he comes from a message look uh but a lot of times he'll use it again in a certain way and he'll say now uh when Jesus was on the earth and he showed the Messiah sign of course he did that and and if you've uh studied this you'll see where I'm at. If you hadn't studied it you it would be a good time to take time because I'm not going to take an hour on it. Uh but when Jesus came remember he said I came unto my own and my own receive me not. And he said now don't go out there. He said now you stay here with the house of Israel. And brother Bam says watch when Jesus performs the Messiah sign. He never performs it to a Gentile. &gt;&gt; He says because the Gentiles were not expecting that &gt;&gt; right there. There was no promise to the Gentiles. They wasn't looking for him. &gt;&gt; Now brother Bam will go to say this. we Gentiles or Anglo-Saxons was not looking for no Messiah. He only comes to those who are looking for him. I used to know a guy that he would quote that quote and then he every morning 6:00 he'd stand and look into the east sky cuz he was looking for him. And I said, "Well, I don't think that's what the prophet meant." Uh because he was saying those that are looking for the Messiah, he only comes to those who are looking for him. And I'd like uh for that to go home. He said, "I hope that stands as high as the trees down here before you that you can can't look without seeing it. He only comes to those who are looking for him." Brother man said, "I pray this statement gets as big as a tree before you. He only comes to those who are looking for him." Amen. I hope that stands as high as the trees. He only comes to that. See, we Gentiles wasn't looking. We wasn't looking for a Messiah, but the Jew and the Samaritans were. Amen. So, we'll see how he made himself known. How did Jesus make himself known to the Jew? He made himself known by the Messiah sign. Amen. When he read the hearts, he made himself known to the Samaritans. The same way with a woman at the well. That's how he did it. Sir, we would see Jesus. Brother man said if that was the sign of the Messiah yesterday and he's has the same Messiah today, it'll have to be the same thing today as it was yesterday. That's how he makes himself known to the church. &gt;&gt; The same way he made himself known to the Jew and to the Samaritan, he will also make himself known unto the Gentile. And how did he do it then is the same way he does it now. You notice how many times brother Brandham used discernment on the platform and he says now he's not dead he's alive and then he'll take a woman and he'll say now this woman standing here is just like it was the scene in John the 4th chapter and brother B will draw out the whole thing and he'll say now if it was in that day what would happen Jesus would tell her her sin he would tell her about her religion and he'll go through that he said then when that struck her life she said sir I perceive thou art a prophet because the light had struck some training. Something in her, brother Ram says, what? She says, "We know thou art a Messiah. We know thou art the prophet." He said, "Then there was some teaching in there." There was something in there that was expecting to see something because when she saw it, she said, "We know that when the Messiah cometh, he will be a prophet." So, there was something expecting. So, then when she saw it, then she knew what she was looking at. Amen. Amen. And if you're reading uh the Apostle Paul, he's projecting that the same Messiah that was in the Bible will be appearing in the last day. And how will you know him when he comes? &gt;&gt; It would have to be the same sign. Now, this Messiah, Amen, they wasn't looking for one, but this Messiah only comes and makes himself manifest to those who are looking for him. The reason we don't see these things today is because we're not looking for them. We are looking to our church or to our denomination or to our structures. How much we are growing. Get your eyes off of that and look to the Messiah. We're at the end time. Now, watch what he's doing. Brother Brandham is then telling you the only reason you wouldn't see him today is because you're not looking at him. He's not telling you. It's not because he's not manifesting. It's not because he's not here. It's not because he's not alive. But you're just not looking at him. You're looking at the at the church. You're looking at the building. You're looking at the group. You're looking at the situations. But the Messiah is here. Now, in the Bible, when the Messiah made himself known, look at the effect that it had even on the woman at the well. Brother man uses it and it's a famous way that he shows the sign of the Messiah is because he chooses a woman that's a mixed religion between Jew and Gentile Samaritan and then he also chooses her because she's a harlot. And brother B says see that that she is a prophecy that the same sign's going to come to the gentile church because the gentile church is a mixed people and it will be to a harlot system. She will she will be called out of the harlots. Amen. to be made virgin, right? Amen. So, we find then that Jesus doing that to her is a prophecy that he's going to do it in the end time. When she saw the symbol of THE MESSIAH, THE BIBLE said she dropped her water pot and ran into the city. Now, can you imagine? Amen. Here she is, an ill-famed woman going into the city. AMEN. TO TELL all of the religious PEOPLE WHERE THE MESSIAH WAS AND WHO HE WAS. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE, BROTHER MAN SAID THAT WOMAN didn't have no voice. He said even today you watch how some sometimes in places women don't have a voice at all. He said look what it would have been in that day. That woman would HAVE HAD NO VOICE IN THAT DAY AT ALL. AMEN. LET ALONE a harlot having a voice in religion. They couldn't even COME TO THE WELL WITH THAT WOMAN. BUT SHE CAUGHT ON SUCH FIRE BY SEEING THE MESSIAH THAT SHE WAS SO INFLUENCED by what she saw. Amen. SHE RAN FROM THE WI. LISTEN, SHE DIDN'T EVEN STAY THERE WITH JESUS. SHE PUT DOWN HER WATER POT AND SAID, "I GOT TO TELL SOMEBODY THAT THE MESSIAH HAS COME INTO THIS EARTH AND SHE RAN DOWN THERE AND THE BIBLE SAID MANY BELIEVED upon him because of her testimony." Let me tell you, if you can get influenced enough by this message, you can become influential. PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO BE INFLUENTIAL. THIS IS A LAND OF INFLUENCERS. I'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU DO IT. YOU GET UNDER THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND LET IT SO INFLUENCE YOUR MIND AND YOUR THINKING UNTIL YOU BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT REALLY IS. AND THEN SOMETHING WILL HAVE YOU SAY, "THE MESSIAH IS HERE ON THE EARTH TODAY." AMEN. COME SEE. WHERE'S HE AT? COME SEE. YOU CAN SEE HIM IF YOU KNOW HOW TO look for him. THAT WOMAN GOT SO SHE GOT SO INFIRED WITH IT. AMEN. SHE DIDN'T WALK OUT to the city and go, "Well, I I don't have nothing to say this morning." And and and and I I I tell you, I I don't feel like I could move anybody or help anybody. I'm going That wasn't the way that woman went out there. &gt;&gt; Because she had seen something worth saying. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. SHE HAD SEEN SOMETHING WORTH SAYING. AMEN. AND IF YOU and if IN YOUR SPIRIT YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO TESTIFY, I SAY YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AGAIN. YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AT THIS MESSAGE AGAIN. AMEN. GET GET YOUR MIND OUT OF ALL THE TRADITIONS AND THE IDEAS AROUND CHURCH AND ALL THE people saying, "Well, it means this and IT MEANS THAT." AND YOU GET ON THERE AND LISTEN TO SOME PASTOR. AMEN. MAKING FUN OF BROTHER BAM or ridiculing him. And then you get on there and listen to some other guy and he's walking TALKING ABOUT WORSHIP AND HE'S AGAINST THIS AND THAT AND SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU GET YOUR MIND SO FULL OF THAT UNTIL AFTER A WHILE ALL YOUR JOY IS GONE AND ALL YOUR REVIVAL'S GONE. BUT IF THIS MESSAGE, AMEN, IN THAT DAY COULD REVIVE A WOMAN AT THE WELL. AMEN. TO MAKE HER GO INTO THE CITY AND SPEAK WHERE SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO SPEAK. WHAT ABOUT THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD? WHAT IT OUGHT TO DO TO US THIS MORNING? IN ORDER TO CAUSE A REVIVAL TO DROP DOWN THE HEART OF THE SOULS OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD UNTIL THEY SHAKE OFF ALL OF THAT DEPRESSION &gt;&gt; AND ANXIETY AND SAY, "LISTEN, AMEN. I MIGHT NOT BE MUCH PERSONALLY, BUT I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; I have seen something." &gt;&gt; Amen. I seen something. Amen. I seen the sign of the Messiah. Amen. You You say you seen him? Yes, I seen his sign. [laughter] What kind of man was he? Amen. I seen the sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. I seen the sign. Now, if you're wondering about this and we would see Jesus 1962, this is July 4th of 1962. Brother Brandham ties Hebrews 9 directly to what I'm talking about when he says, "See, the Gentiles wasn't looking for a Messiah." See, and Messiah only comes to those who are looking for him. That's the only way. To them that look, he will appear the second time. To them that look, he will appear the second time. Just to those who are looking for him. Amen. And pertaining they are really looking for him. He never come to the gentile. That miracle was never performed to the gentile. &gt;&gt; The miracle never performed the gentile. NOW WATCH THAT ONE STATEMENT GOES. IT GOES LIKE A star bust through the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. He never performed that miracle. Okay. Now to you that's if you're studying the message this will help you because you've heard the negative. If God be with us where's the miracles. So they take it to a Pentecostal side a negative. Amen. And a man says well if God's with you then where's this and I want to see more signs and I want to see more of this and I want to see more of this. And they place the presence of God solely upon that. But watch now. Brother Random goes to show you that the antichrist spirit can work in the same realm. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it wasn't until the word came that we knew the difference between the two spirits. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now watch what I'm saying, though. He said the miracle. So, if you go listen to the sermon, if God be for us, where's the miracle? You're going to find out the miracle that that Gideon is talking about is the Messa sign of vindication of the word. Because brother Bram says it's not until the angel touches the sacrifice and it disappears in fire that Gideon sees the miracle he's looking for which is vindication. Now that same miracle IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH ELIJAH on the mountain when he's standing against Baal. Remember and he brought fire and the WHOLE CONGREGATION SAID OUR GOD IS GOD. BROTHER B SAID THAT'S BECAUSE THEY SAW VINDICATION. &gt;&gt; THEY SAW GOD THAT ANSWERS BY FIRE. THEY saw vindication OF HIS WORD. NOW, IN THIS SEASON, AMEN. What we're looking for is the miracle that he PERFORMED WITH ABRAHAM BACK in Genesis the 18th chapter. Brother man said, "There it is." IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE MIRACLE, look in Genesis 18 and see when he read SARAH'S HEART WHEN SHE WAS IN the tent that was behind him. Now, this now THIS IS POWERFUL, FOLKS, BECAUSE THE MIRACLE was never performed before the Gentile. SO WHEN YOU SEE BROTHER BRANDHAM turning his back to the congregation and performing that he's performing the miracle THAT TELLS YOU GOD IS WITH US. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WAS HEY, BROTHER BAM SAID THERE IT IS. HE'S confirming the covenant to the church. HE THAT'S HIS CONFIRMATION OF THE COVENANT. WATCH WHEN YOU GO TO SAMSON AND YOU SEE SAMSON. remember he was under covenant and then the covenant was broken AND HE GOT BLINDED and he lost his power AND HE'S OUT THERE WORKING AND BROTHER SAYS WATCH BUT ALL THE TIME the locks were growing back &gt;&gt; and he said IF HE COULD EVER FEEL LIKE HE was under that covenant he could defeat his enemy and brother Brandon said one day he reached up and felt those locks and he cried out just ONE MORE TIME NOW BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TALKING TO THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH AND HE'S TALKING HOW THAT YOU USED TO BE A POWERFUL GROUP BUT NOW YOU'RE JUST ENTERTAINING. &gt;&gt; And he TALKED ABOUT SAMSON. IT'S JUST A SHOW. YOU'RE JUST CLOWNING NOW. LIKE SAMSON WAS to them Philistine gods. DO US A MIRACLE. SHOW US SOMETHING WONDERFUL. HE SAID THAT'S WHAT PENTECOST HAS BEEN REDUCED TO. THEY LOST THE POWER AND THE STRENGTH, BUT THEY'RE STILL PUTTING ON A SHOW. BUT BROTHER BAM SAID, "BUT WHEN THE COVENANT RETURNED, SAMSON SAID,"LORD, JUST ONE MORE TIME, LET STRENGTH ENTER EVERY MEMBER." BROTHER MADDEN WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BRIDE. LET THE STRENGTH OF GOD RETURN TO EVERY MEMBER IN THE BODY BECAUSE WHEN HE REACHED UP AND FELT THEM LOCKS, he knew he was still under covenant. And brother Brandham preaching this now and looks out in the congregation, discerned somebody's hearts, and he said, "There it is. You feel them? You feel the locks? Do you feel the locks?" And he starts discerning other. Do you FEEL THE LOCKS? WHAT'S HE DOING? BY HIS SIGN OF DISCERNMENT, he's telling THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY THAT'S CRYING ONE MORE TIME THAT THE COVENANT IS STILL IN EFFECT FOR THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. GOD IS STILL WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; OH CHURCH, I'LL TELL YOU THIS. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT WE GO THROUGH IF WE KNOW GOD'S WITH US. THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DOUBT, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL BECAUSE THOU ART WITH ME. THOU ART MY ROD AND MY STAFF. ABRAHAM SAID, "MY SHIELD AND MY BUCKLER." DAVID SAID, "THOUGH YOU HIDE MY SOUL IN HELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE GOD WILL BE THERE WITH ME WHEREVER I MAKE MY BED WHEREVER I GO." AMEN. DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT GOD IS WITH YOU? YOU SAY, "I'M GOING THROUGH TRIALS." I SAY, "GOD IS WITH YOU." BUT I'M NOT SAYING THAT BY AMEN. I FEEL BETTER TODAY THAN I DID YESTERDAY, AND I FEEL A LITTLE MORE EXCITED TODAY THAN I DID YESTERDAY, AND I'M DOWN TODAY, AND I'M UP TOMORROW. AMEN. FORGET THE WHOLE THING. THERE'S A SIGN OVER THE CHURCH THAT GOD IS WITH US. [applause] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THERE, I DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN READ THE SIGNS AND THE SIGN SAYS THAT MESSIAH IS HERE ON EARTH NOW. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. He's the same. He appeared to them two tribes and he's appearing to you today. He's here today. That angel, brother Bam said, turned his back to that tent. Why did Sarah lad? What kind of telepathy is that? See, it's not telepathy. It was a sign to Abraham. &gt;&gt; The messenger of the Holy Spirit is coming to the elected church. Now, of course, Brother Bram says the same son that God manifested in the east is appearing in the west. This is the evening time. Now, amen. Brother Bram says this in Jehovah Gyra. He comes to the humblehearted, those that are looking for him. And here he is tonight. the Holy Spirit, the same angel. Brother Ma'am, then a little later, the quote says, "If I die tonight and I never enter p this pull pit tomorrow night, my word is truth because it's not my words, it's his." &gt;&gt; Do you see he he actually was up on the earth announced by a prophet to be in the presence of the people? Now, when you when you look into this, you'll see that he was there and he was walking among them. But the sign made him known to the woman at the well. He was there and he was walking among them. When he looked at Peter who had his hands full of net and called him and Peter dropped his net and went and followed him, what happened? He didn't come. He just opened Peter's eyes. &gt;&gt; He He didn't come special to the whale. He opened her eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That same one that when he appeared to the two on the road to Emmas, that was the resurrected Christ after his death, burial, and resurrection, showing the same ministry to them too on the road that he had showed to that woman AND TO HIS DISCIPLES WHO WERE STANDING THERE recognized the same one that was before death is now alive doing the same thing now, PREDICTING THAT THERE WOULD COME A MINISTRY AFTER his resurrection. Now it was the presence then and it was the presence now. Now what was needed was God needed to change the scene. &gt;&gt; That's what needed when when you think about this in the unveiling of God. Brother Bam goes down and he's talking about Elijah and how he was down at Elisha was down at Dolphin, you know, and he had his servant Gahesa with him and that's when the Syrian army swirled in around him and he said, "Well, there's there's more of us than there is of them." And brother Bam draws out the picture and he says, "Well, Gahesa, you know, he he he didn't see what Elisha saw." But but Elisha prayed the prayer and said, "Lord, open the boy's eyes that he might be able to see." Now, Brother Bam draws a huge thing and he says, "Listen now, God never put the angels there. &gt;&gt; He just changed his sea." Now, NOW IF IF YOU COULD TAKE FROM THAT, brother Brandham, Elijah in the last days said, now Elisha never did see them angels personally. He wouldn't he DIDN'T LOOK OUT THE LOG WINDOW and see the angels out on the mountain. He said he was taking that from scripture that were that that they that fear the Lord shall the angels of the Lord encamp about them that fear. So, he was taking the word and announcing what he couldn't see. AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TELLING A CONGREGATION that and then turns around and says, "The angel of the LORD IS HERE." &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING SAYING, "WELL, WHERE'S HE AT?" AMEN. WHAT WHERE'S HE AT? AND BROTHER B WAS SAYING, "OH, HE DIDN'T NEED TO COME. HE JUST NEEDED TO CHANGE THEIR SCENE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND TODAY, what we really need is to change the scene. BUT WE KNOW HOW TO SEE HIM TO UNDERSTAND HE'S IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE. AMEN. AND HE HAS SHOWED HIMSELF BY A SIGN. HE ONLY comes to those who are looking for him. &gt;&gt; Are you looking for him this morning? &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 9, let's reread it. Christ once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that look, he shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation. In 2 Timothy 4 and verse 8, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Unto them that love his appearing. How many knows, Brother Bam said that his ministry was that appearing? &gt;&gt; I got several quotes. Amen. That that his ministry was that appearing. Paul said unto them that love is appearing. Do you know that the Bible says that in the last days there will be scoffers. Amen. There will be people literally that all they're going to do is scoff the message and other people's going to say, "Well, it might not be true because so and so don't see it or so and SO SCOFF AT IT." BUT THE SCRIPTURE says scoffers SHALL COME. BUT IT ALSO SAYS UNTO THEM THAT ALSO LOVE HIS APPEARING. SO JUST AS SURE AS THERE'S PEOPLE'S GOING TO SCOFF IT, THERE'S PEOPLE THAT'S GOING TO LOVE IT. WELL, I HAPPEN TO BE one of them. I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THEM THAT LOVE THE APPEARING OF the Lord in the last days that he has manifested himself so clearly in our generation. You you your Bible people, let's read scripture. COLOSSIANS 3 AND VERSE 4. WHEN CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE, when he shall appear, then we shall also appear with him in glory. when Christ who is our life shall appear. HOW MANY REALIZES THAT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON TAKES JOHN THE 4TH CHAPTER, the woman at the well again, and he SAYS SHE WAS SITTING there waiting for her life to be manifest. THAT'S ALL SHE WAS WAITING ON WAS HER LIFE TO be manifest because the one she was living on the earth, AMEN, WAS LEFT HER IN THAT PLACE. BUT CHRIST WAS COMING FROM ANOTHER PLACE. HE COME TO RAISE HER thinking above the thinking she had right then of who she was. Do you see that? When he shall appear, then we shall appear with him IN GLORY. WHEN HE APPEARS, he's coming from a different realm, a a different denom, a a different dimension, A DIFFERENT PLACE. SO WHAT HE THINKS AND what he says is able then to lift the people unto another realm. You can appear with him in glory if you can see this. This is his appearing. You see, if you're looking at it the wrong way, then the message is condemning you. If you're looking at it from THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING at it, it's raising you to THE LEVEL OF BEING THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU CAN YOU CAN APPEAR WITH HIM. THAT'S WHY HE SAID, "WHEN ZION HAS BEEN BUILT UP, THEN SHALL I APPEAR WITH HIM IN GLORY." YOU SEE THE APPEARANCE OF THE LORD WAS WAITING FOR THE BRIDE TO GET BUILT UP IN THE PLACE of glory. 1 John chapter 2 and verse 28. And now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have a confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. When he shall appear. I love that. Amen. That we'll not be ashamed. Well, I'm not ashamed. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the message. I'm not ashamed to say what it is. I'm not ashamed to say what it does. AMEN. BECAUSE I'M NOT ASHAMED OF brother Bradom. I'm not ashamed of the appearing of the LORD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING THIS IS the appearing of the Lord. It is what it is. And God has OPENED THIS DUMB HILLY'S EYES. YOU SEE, IT'S THE FULFILLMENT OF SCRIPTURE IN MY GENERATION. I COULD STAND TODAY LIKE THEY STOOD IN THE BIBLE AND SAY, "THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED." &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK AT THAT. IT'S FULFILLED WHETHER YOU SEE IT OR YOU DON'T SEE IT. BUT TODAY I PRAY THAT THE SCRIPTURE is fulfilled in your ears. That you're able TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS NOT A HIT AND MISS. IT'S NOT BROTHER BRANDHAM GUESSING AT THINGS. IT'S NOT A MAN BUILDING UP HIS DENOMINATION OR HIS FOLLOWING. IT IS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD IN OUR GENERATION. THIS IS THE WORD COMING TO PASS. OH, WHEN YOU SEE IT, BROTHER, you can't unsee it. When you see it in the scripture, you'll see it again and again. Amen. Watch the scripture. Beloved, now we are the sons of God. And it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; When he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him &gt;&gt; as he is. &gt;&gt; That we shall know. And and if you're a studyer of the message, you'll know THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM TAKES THAT TO THEOPHONY. AND HE TEACHES US, WATCH THE REVELATION OF MELAZDC. THAT'S GOD THEOPHONY. GOD. AMEN. BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT WE HAVE THEOPHONY. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S IN THE APPEARING OF THE LORD THAT WE COME TO THE REVELATION THAT WE ALSO HAVE THEOPHONY. LOOK WHAT HE SAID. WHEREVER THE CARCASS IS, THERE THE EAGLES are gathered together. And brother said, "What's the eagles?" The church. He said, "But what's the carcass?" is the fresh word. And when you recognize that the very message IS THE EAGLE FOOD, THEN you have HEARD FROM YOUR THEOPHONY. THIS IS MORE THAN A MINISTRY OF A MAN, WILLIAM BRANDOM. THAT'S WHY THAT IT DIDN'T STOP WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM DIED. THIS MINISTRY IS STILL MOVING BECAUSE IT'S THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS IS NOT A JUST, OH GOD, I WISH I HAD THE VOICE OF 10,000 ANGELS. THIS IS MORE THAN THE MAN WILLIAM BRANDOM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST THAT HE PROMISED IN THE LAST DAYS THAT HE WOULD APPEAR AMONG US. AMEN. AND HOW IS IT THAT GOD, AMEN, COULD appear and might make himself KNOWN? DO YOU SEE THAT? HE'S NEVER REQUIRED you to worship something you didn't know. &gt;&gt; He's never said go down and worship at the unknown god under his tomb. But he makes himself known. &gt;&gt; And watch his identification. and he fulfills the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see that? AMEN. NOW WATCH IN JOHN 14. Did he promise he would appear? Look, I just read four scriptures of promising he would appear. But then in John 14, he also promised THAT YOU WOULD SEE HIM IN JOHN 14. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, BUT YE SHALL SEE ME. BECAUSE I LIVE, ye live also. How many knows that ye is a special class of people? Ye. That brother Bam uses the word ye class. There's the high class, there's the low class, there's the ye class. And brother Bam said the ye class is the people that see him. Come on, CHURCH. IT'S THE BEST CLASS OF PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAID, "OH, WE'LL GO DOWN AND JOIN THE HIGHER CLASS." HE SAID, "THERE'S NO BETTER CLASS." AMEN. THE GREATEST CLASS IS THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE been filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THAT CLASS OF PEOPLE IS a ye class of people. Brother Bam TALKS ABOUT IT. HE TALKS ABOUT BILLY Graham filling up the the auditoriums and he talks about this. He said, "What's a class of them?" You remember he talked about he STOOD THERE ONE DAY AND HE was watching a uh he was waiting. He said, "I'm waiting on this building for my crowd to go in." He said, "And this intellectual fellow said, I watched his crowd come out and he said they was all well-dressed and nice and he said everything was perfect." He said, "Then here come my group." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said there was the insane and the crippled and the lame and the halt and you know everything in the world was was pulled in around it and and you know years ago and I may told you this but I thought it was pretty good. Me and brother me and brother menia was sitting in Canada. We were sitting at a table with a brother and and and he might have that other brother might have been a little higher class than most of the message people and I don't say that as a compliment. Uh anybody that looks down on this bride you you too high. You need to get off your high horse. get your hand down here where we'll know you, you know. &gt;&gt; And he was just a little higher cuz he says, well, he said, there's a lot of there's a lot of basically riff raff around this message. There's a lot of odd people. And he just kept saying around that message and this message and them people and and my temperature was rising. I was checking myself. Amen. Cuz I was I was taking it personal and uh and in a minute, Brother Menow, I guess he could feel my spirit. And brother Manel very very as a stately gentleman that he is he said well brother you know why that is right and the brother the brother said no he said it's because it offers hope to everybody &gt;&gt; you see the message offers hope to everybody you don't have to be from a certain family to see the message is hope you YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FROM a certain social class to see the MESSAGE IS HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN EDUCATION to understand BUT IF YOU NEED HOPE THIS IS THE APPEARING OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHEN HE APPEARS WITH POWER AND WITH GLORY AND HE SHOWS THE ABILITY. OH, COME ON NOW. YOU SEE WHAT IT IS? YOU YOU GOT TO YOU GOT TO GET INTO THAT PLACE WHERE THE HOLY SPIRIT CAN MOVE BECAUSE IT'S hope for everybody. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HOPE FOR EVERYBODY. THIS AIN'T HOPE for just one family. This ain't just for the Lawsons or the Ericsons. OR YOU SAY, "WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I AIN'T GOT NO CHANCE BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ERICSON." WELL, LISTEN. WHEN I MOVED HERE, I I DON'T HAVE NO FAMILY, NOBODY. BROTHER RAY BROUGHT ME IN HERE AS AN ORPHAN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU, IF YOU MOVED IN HERE LATELY, YOU SEE ALL THE FAMILY AROUND ME. WELL, MY KIDS WAS IN UH Zach's 16 and and Bethany was 10 and Gracie was about 14 AND AND IT WAS JUST OUR LITTLE FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. AND BROTHER RAY EXTENDED I WENT to some of his family things and he took me out to lunch and he just kind of brought ME IN AND MADE me a part of his FAMILY AND TREATED ME like his family. AMEN. BUT YOU BUT I WASN'T AN ERICSON. BUT I'M PASTORING THE CHURCH BECAUSE THE MESSAGE DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO BE AN ERICSON. AND IT DON'T REQUIRE YOU TO BE A LAWSON. AND ANY DEVIL THAT SAYS SO IS A LYING DEVIL OUT OF THE PITS OF HELL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A LAWSON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A REAGAN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SPENCER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PUIT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A BRISCOLL. COME ON CHURCH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN NAME. BUT YE SHALL SEE ME. THAT'S THE CLASS WE'RE AFTER IS THE ONE THAT CAN LOOK UP AND SEE GOD IN HIS MERCY AND IN HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL SEE ME. YOU CAN SEE HE PROMISED YOU CAN SEE HIM. AMEN. IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT you have to be a certain people to see him. HE SO MANIFESTED HIMSELF THAT THEY SEEN him in Africa and they seen him IN INDIA. THEY SEEN HIM AT A GRASS HUTCH. IN INDIA, THEY SAW IT. COME ON, CHURCH. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE SHOES TO WEAR TO CHURCH. THEY DIDN'T HAVE FOOD TO EAT WHILE THEY GATHERED, BUT THEY STILL SEEN HIM. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. IT DON'T COST YOU ANYTHING TO SEE HIM. [laughter] AMEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE WEALTH TO SEE HIM. JUST OPEN YOUR EYES. HE IS AMONG US TODAY, THE SAME AS HE WAS IN THE DAYS THAT BEFORE OUR TIMES. &gt;&gt; YOU, it's a ye class. This is a ye class. And God can TAKE YOU A HILLBILLY OFF of the river in Arkansas and show you this revelation. &gt;&gt; And and I I I sometimes sometimes I I want I I wish I could maybe get the expression we didn't start where we are. Why did I even start as a pastor w with with the people and the blessing and brother Ray behind me and I that wasn't the way we started. &gt;&gt; Matt saw me. I hadn't been saved very long. You come to that house, we had $23,000 in it and it sat next to that uh next to the river down there and had a railroad track that went by. You remember it? Vernon remembers. He remembers coming over the house and helping me with a hammer and we had a $650 car. We beat the hood out on it and he bought the expensive spray paint and we spray painted that baby with a can and I drove that to work. Amen. And he loan me his car to preach out of cuz we didn't have Amen. uh a little G to give us a Cadillac at that time in our life. &gt;&gt; We didn't have it folks. IT WAS SMALL AND IT WAS LITTLE. BUT I SEEN SOMETHING. I SEEN SOMETHING. AND I SEEN MORE THAN WILLIAM BRANDOM. I SEEN MORE THAN JUST A GROUP OF PEOPLE. I SAW THE COMING OF THE LORD. I SAW THE APPEARING OF ALMIGHTY GOD IN MY GENERATION. AND IT DONE SOMETHING INSIDE OF THIS HILLBILLY'S HEART. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. I'M NOT THE BEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD. BUT I'LL TELL [laughter] YOU THIS, IT'S JESUS CHRIST THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. AND IF HE'S ALIVE, IF HE'S ALIVE, THEN I DON'T HAVE TO BE THE BEST PREACHER. HE SAID HE WOULD SHOW UP. IF HE'S ALIVE, I DON'T HAVE TO HEAL THE SICK. HE SAID HE WOULD HEAL THE SICK. HE WOULD RAISE THE DEAD. HE WOULD SAVE THE LOST. HE WOULD FILL WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THIS IS NOT OUR MINISTRY. IT'S THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN THAT IS COMING IN THIS HANDS TO MANIFEST THE POWER OF GOD OVER THIS GENERATION. SO, WAYNE, I WANT TO GET HIGHER. LOOK AT IT. LOOK AT IT AND SEE IT FOR WHAT IT IS. AND IT'LL BEGIN TO RAISE YOU. &gt;&gt; SEE, it's you you don't look at the end and say, "Well, that that that wasn't how we got there, right?" &gt;&gt; You see the blessing on people. I always loved Brother Bisc for it. Brother Bisll was a He actually was a very wealthy man. I don't know how many y'all know that. One of his grandsons told me one time they was in school and found it out and was shocked [panting] that they that their granddad was that wealthy because they didn't know it. But he made his money in auction companies. He's a great businessman. And he got rid of he got out of that and got into the preaching of the gospel and traveled and all that. You know, he did it because he loved the message. That's why he did it. And you know what's powerful? Amen. is every time that I ever heard brother Bisco talk about his prosperity, you know what he said? He said it's because of my respect to the ministry of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; He said that's why it was. God showed him early on that it was not just a man. &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Bisco tells it, don't he? He said, I don't know why we're on brother Ed, but we'll just tell it. As brother Bis tells it, he said, "We're riding down the road." And he said, "We're going moose hunting." And he said, "Brother Brandham is just Brother Brandham." And he points over and said, "The lady I prayed for the other night's in that house right there." And he said, "We're hundreds of miles from where the meeting took place, but that woman he had prayed for," he said, "I knew her and I knew that that's where they were keeping her." Amen. And he said he was exactly right where she was and who was there. He said, "My goodness, you you because brother Biscll could see I know Brother Brandham, but whoever that is pointing that out, &gt;&gt; that's something different than that man sitting in the seat next to me." And brother, brother Brisco said, "We're driving down THE ROAD AND GOING MOOSE HUNTING." HE SAID, "BROTHER Bam said, "He's here." And he said, "I SEEN THE WHISKERS STICK OUT ON HIS FACE." HE SAID HE TURNED REAL PALE and the whiskers STUCK OUT ON HIS FACE. HE SAID ALL OF A SUDDEN A MOOSE JUST WALKS UP OVER THERE. AND BROTHER BIS SAID, "I JUST GOT SHOT THE MOOSE." AND BROTHER BISL SAYS, "BROTHER RANDOM TOLD HIM, HE SAID, LISTEN, HE SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS every time he comes." BUT THE BISCLL GOES HOME AND GETS ELEVATED FROM A LITTLE BITTY NOTHING JOB THAT HE STARTED AS A JANITOR AND GOES TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY BECAUSE OF AN IDEA THAT GOD GAVE HIM IN INSPIRATION. WHAT LIFTED HIM? IT WAS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WHAT LIFTED RAY ERICSON FROM A PIG FARMER TO A MINISTER KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD? WHAT LIFTED HIM? THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WHAT LIFTED WAYNE LAWSON OUT OF THE HILLS OF ARKANSAS? THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WHAT LIFTED DONNIE REAGAN OUT OF BEING A PENTECOSTAL BOY? THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WHAT LIFTED TIM PUIT? THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND IF IT LIFTED THEM and it it can lift you, IT CAN LIFT A PIG FARMER. IT CAN LIFT A HILLBILLY. IT CAN LIFT YOU OUT OF YOUR SITUATIONS. BUT YOU CAN'T LET SOMEBODY TELL YOU it's not right. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; the the the the the magnitude of what this message really means. I do not have the language to express to you. [panting] [snorts] &gt;&gt; In Luke the 17th chapter, people read this for 2,000 years. His own words, "Even shall it be when the Son of Man is revealed." That's Jesus's words &gt;&gt; laid in the Bible for 2,000 years. but is manifest in the ministry of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; And brother Bama repeatedly says there it is. There's the manifestation. Here's the sign in Matthew 24 and 27. As the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth under the west, so also shall the coming of the son of man be. Out of the east under the west, there's the light. Brother said, just like the sun. You ever looked at the picture of a of a sunrise? you look. Are you sure it's a sunrise or is it a sunset? Cuz they look the same. It's only if you know your directions that you can tell the difference. If it's a sunrise or a sunset, if you think the east is west and the west is east, you will get them mixed up because there is no difference. It's the same sun. &gt;&gt; Look at a sunset on the water and look at a sunrise on the water and you tell me just by looking without knowing the time. But if I add the time, I CAN SAY THE SAME SUN that rose in the east is NOW SETTING IN THE WEST. IF YOU KNOW THE TIME, YOU KNOW THE SETTING. LISTEN. IF HE SAID THE RISING OF THE SUN WAS THE MINISTRY OF JESUS IN THE BODY OF JESUS OF NAZARETH THAT HAD COME TO DIE FOR OUR SINS, THEN THE SETTING OF THE SUN WILL BE THE SAME JESUS. HE WILL LOOK THE SAME. HE WILL BE THE SAME. HE WILL HAVE THE SAME SIGNS, THE SAME POWER, THE SAME ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; You got to be so careful, folks, because brother Brandham never one time said, "Come here. Is this what Paul did?" &gt;&gt; Not one time. &gt;&gt; Not one time DOES HE SAY, "WELL, I'M GOING to turn my back to you and show you that Paul's ministry is here." [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Right? Because Paul didn't have the ministry of the son of man for the evening message. He was telling the Gentiles what TO LOOK FOR. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BUILDING EXPECTATION FOR THE END TIME MESSAGE OF WILLIAM RANDOM. &gt;&gt; LOOK. AMEN. He shall appear. Amen. Now, if you're if you're looking in your Bible, Amen. I I'll say this. God God our Lord Jesus said he was light. I'm the light of the world. And if you look in the Bible, the word is light. And if you ask yourself this, light, light from the east to the west, the son of man light. If you asked yourself this, what is the source of light? &gt;&gt; What's the source of light? Genesis first chapter. In the beginning, see, it was all dark and then God said, &gt;&gt; so the word is the source of light. &gt;&gt; So [snorts] if it's going to be an evening light, there has to be a word source of light. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word source is I will appear unto them the second time without sin under salvation. I will reveal myself. I will come. The son of man will come. That's the word source of it. But it don't become light until the messenger of the hour comes and picks up the scriptures and begins to make it live. Then it becomes light. &gt;&gt; And the same light that was in the east comes in the west. What did Jesus do? He just fulfilled scripture. And when that lie of that ministry struck the seed that was laying in Peter, Peter went into revival. &gt;&gt; WHEN IT STRUCK THE PHARISEE, THE PHARISEE SLAPPED him and said it was of the devil. &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT LIGHT STRIKES THE RIGHT SEED, there is expectation in that seed because it's light. How many realizes that Jesus himself walking on the earth was light? &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 42, WATCH THE SCRIPTURE. THUS SAITH THE LORD GOD, THAT THOU created heavens and earth, and stretched them out, and spread them on the earth, that which cometh out of it. He giveth breathe unto the people uh uh unto it, and spirit to them that walketh therein. I am the Lord, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light unto the Gentile. &gt;&gt; I will give THEE FOR A COVENANT, and a light unto the Gentile. Now watch in Matthew chapter 4 the 13th and 14th verses. And leaving Nazareth, he came across Capernaum and upon the sea coast and the borders of Zylon and Ethylon. And that it MIGHT BE FULFILLED WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY ISAIAH the prophet, saying that the land of Zeblon, the land of Nethalum, were the way of the sea beyond the Jordan and the Gentiles, the people which set in darkness saw great light. They didn't see a electric light. They didn't see a a bulb. They didn't see the sun s u n hanging there. They seen the word &gt;&gt; of Isaiah &gt;&gt; walking on the seashore. And it was a light unto them that sat in darkness. The people that sat in darkness saw great light. In Isaiah 9 and2 he said, "People that walk in darkness have seen great light, and they that dwell in the shadow of death upon him have light shined." In in in the book OF LUKE, WHEN ZECHARIAH was birthing, Amen. and he was going to bring forth. What did he prophesy concerning the Lord Jesus? HE SAID, "THOU TENDER MERCY OF our God, WHEREBY THE DAYSPRING ON HIGH VISITED us to give light to them which set in darkness and in the shadow of death TO GUIDE OUR FEET into the way OF PEACE." SO JOHN'S FATHER identified Jesus with the scriptures. It was Simeon in LUKE CHAPTER 2. HE DID THE SAME THING. AMEN. AND THE BIBLE SAID IT WAS REVEALED UNTO HIM BY THE HOLY GHOST that he wouldn't see death before he seen the Lord's Christ. AND HE CAME BY SPIRIT INTO THE TEMPLE. IT WAS IN THE time of the presentation of the baby. Isn't that pretty good? He got the at the time it was being presented is the time Simeon came. Amen. He came at the right time. How many knows when they circumcised babies? It was the eighth day, wasn't it? On the eighth day, Simeon went into the temple where the the presentation OF THE CHILD WAS BEING MADE. AND HE RAN AND GRABBED THE WORD IN FLESH. AMEN. AND HELD IT UP TO THE CONGREGATION AND SAID, "HE'S A LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES." CAN YOU IMAGINE, CHURCH? &gt;&gt; That people thought he was absolutely crazy. &gt;&gt; But he showed up at the right time at the presentment of the word MADE FLESH AND IDENTIFIED WHAT THEY WERE ALREADY looking at it. They were already BEHOLDING IT. BUT NOW SOMEBODY WAS TAKING THE SCRIPTURE AND TELLING THEM WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CHILD. THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER MESSAGE. THIS IS THE LIGHT OF THE GENTILES AND HE HELD UP THE WORD made flesh so the whole place could see it and made the ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE DAY OF PRESENTMENT. [laughter] AMEN. HE WENT TO THE TABERNACLE ON THE EIGHTH DAY TO SEE CHRIST. I TELL YOU WHAT, AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THE PRESENTMENT OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND IT'S THE EIGHTH DAY AND WE'RE IN THE TEMPLE. AND IT'S NOT CHRIST WHO'S WITH US. IT'S CHRIST THAT IS IN US. AND HE'S RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, brother, what do you mean eighth day? Isn't Sunday the eighth day? Isn't this is Sunday, right?" Okay. Okay. I just want to make sure I lost my mind. Th This is Sunday. S U N D A Y. Tomorrow's Monday. Yesterday was Saturday. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, this is eighth day, right? &gt;&gt; But somebody going to help me. &gt;&gt; This is eighth day. Right. &gt;&gt; If it's Sunday, it's the eighth day of the week. &gt;&gt; Well, if you woke up in the hospital after a car wreck, they'd say, "What day is it? &gt;&gt; Where are you at? YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT DAY is it? Come on. Do you know what day it is? &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT SEASON YOU'RE LIVING IN? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE [snorts] LIVING IN THE SEASON OF THE PRESENTMENT WHERE WE'RE NOT JUST IN ANOTHER CHURCH AGE. THIS IS NOT SATURDAY AND IT'S NOT MONDAY. IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK AGAIN. AMEN. AND THE SON OF MAN HAS BEEN RISEN UP TO WAVE OVER THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. THEY THOUGHT SIMEON WAS CRAZY. AND THERE'S been a lot of people thought I was crazy, too. BUT I HAVE SEEN THAT IN the evening time, there shall be light. As long as Hebrews 9 was in the Bible, as long as Luke 17 laid in the Bible, as long as Matthew 24 was JUST IN THE BIBLE, YOU GOT A right to question it. But once IT HAS BEEN MANIFESTED, IT IS NOW SIN TO DISBELIEVE THE FULFILLED WORD OF YOUR AGE. I AM NOT A SINNER, BROTHER. I AM A BELIEVER. AND I BELIEVE THE SCRIPTURES HAVE BEEN FULFILLED IN THIS GENERATION. NOT JUST SO I COULD PREACH ABOUT IT, BUT THAT I MIGHT HAVE LIGHT. I MIGHT HAVE LIGHT IN THE DARK AGE OF LEADSIA TO KNOW WHO I AM. TO KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT. TO KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. I TELL YOU ONE THING, the way to know, Amen, is to know who you are. Then you know what you're not. &gt;&gt; I I don't have to know every name in the airport. &gt;&gt; I just got to know my name. I don't have to sit there and listen through EVERY NAME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO. I guess they SIT AND LISTEN TO EVERY NAME AND THEY'RE LIKE, "SHH, THEY'RE CALLING NAMES." I DON'T HAVE TO SH BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN my name's called. &gt;&gt; I CAN HEAR IT, MAN. YOU CAN BE WALKING ACROSS, YOU JUST HEAR YOUR NAME. YOU'RE LIKE, "THEY'RE talking to me." Maybe I'm designed that way. I don't know. But if you know who you are, you know who you ain't. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. THERE'S A LOT OF FOOLISH VIRGIN AND THERE'S A LOT OF ANTICHRIST AND THERE'S A LOT OF SERPENT SEED AND I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL WHO IS AND WHO IS WHAT. BY THE WAY, WHO DO YOU THINK THEY ARE AND HOW DO YOU THINK IT FITS? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW WHO I AM. SO, I KNOW WHO I AM. I'M AN ACTS 238 TONGUE-TALKING BABY BORN OF THE WORD OF GOD IN MY GENERATION. I SEE IT. I BELIEVE IT. I MANIFEST IT BECAUSE I AM THAT WORD CHILD. BUT THE BIBLE PROPHESIED WOULD COME IN THE AGE we're living in. I ain't got to keep up with what everybody else believes. I got to know what I believe. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ray, do you think the co was the mark of the beast? You know, because if you got that shot, that's the mark of the beast, right? And then if you had to sign a paper and if you had got your social security card and oh, well, maybe it's that bank card OR YOU IT'S AMAZING ALL OF THE CHARTS AND ALL THE IDEAS. AND I I TELL YOU, I COULD STOP RIGHT here and just punt kick this conspiracy nonsense. Half y'all KEEP YOURSELVES SO TIED UP IN YOUTUBE and Facebook and Instagram and some other gram or some OTHER SOMETHING THAT YOU GOT YOUR MIND SO FULL OF OF OF CONCEPTS AND IDEAS. AMEN. YOU GOT THE MARK of the beast OVER THERE AND YOU GOT TRIBULATION OVER THERE AND YOU GOT THIS OVER HERE. YOU NEVER GOT THAT OUT OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE smarter because I don't know what YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT AIN'T THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T that I can't read OR I CAN'T WATCH. I JUST CHOOSE NOT TO BECAUSE I NEED FAITH IN MY HEART THAT I WANT TO MAKE A RAPTURE. I WANT TO KNOW WHO I AM. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I'm going. &gt;&gt; What do you think the mark of the beast is? I'll tell you what it ain't. because I can tell you what it is. &gt;&gt; It is denying the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And it's already in the earth. &gt;&gt; And if you want to put a name on it, it's joining the denominational system that opposes the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Now whether that's independent, Roman Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, whatever name you put on it, it's still the same thing. It ain't the Holy Ghost. That ain't in proper English, is it? &gt;&gt; It ain't the Holy Ghost. That's all I can tell you. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Wayne, don't you think we need to know it? Now, y'all y'all got to y'all got to watch me. I guess I'm a little bit of a I'm a little bit a stickler on this point. If I needed to know it, it'd be in this message. &gt;&gt; You may need to feel important. I don't. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; I come a long ways in my life to humble myself to what William Brandham said. &gt;&gt; And the more I humbled myself, the clearer the message got. And the more I humbled myself, the more powerful it got. And the more I humbled myself, I FOUND OUT WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM MEANT. The gift is getting YOURSELF &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE WAY. &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD CAN'T USE YOU TILL YOU QUALIFY YOURSELF IN THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE MEANT TO MANIFEST. THAT'S PROBABLY TO SOMEBODY OUT on the line there. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's not legalist here. You can do whatever you want to, &gt;&gt; but if I were you, I'd pull back from my conspiracies and study the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Christ was the first one to raise from the prophets that topped in many places. He was the first fruits of those that slept and in the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, you got to watch uh some people that have edited this sermon put the comma in the wrong place &gt;&gt; cuz I listen to tapes &gt;&gt; and I read &gt;&gt; and I might not be a good English uh but when they put the comma in the wrong place, they change the meaning of less quote. &gt;&gt; And brother Brand wasn't talking about the bride coming out of denomination. He was talking about the bride coming of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; See, coming out of the church, there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. You all know what that sheath waving was. It was the first one in maturity, right? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The first one in maturity because there had been a maturing light. &gt;&gt; And when the light changes, that's why you watch. See, because there's a light in the spring and there's a light in the fall. &gt;&gt; And there's that August sun that has strength. The strength of the August sun is to cause separation between seed and shuck. &gt;&gt; That's the reason it gets so so and and you've heard me preach it about about soybean fields and how it comes a ripening season and part of it ain't as ripe as the others cuz maybe there's a shade tree in one corner of it and it it protects it from the strength of it. You see, if you've grew up under a shade tree somewhere that thought preaching the strength of the message might be too much for somebody, then it shades you from certain areas of it and and you're you're allowed uh uh to to be a little behind in some areas. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; But the strength of the message is what matures you to who you really are. So, so when when it takes the strength of the teaching of the son of man to show you that the son of man don't only manifest in a in a in a prophet, he'll also manifest in the bride. &gt;&gt; See, but that that's going to take the strength of it. Somebody's somebody's going to have to to preach it with strength. And and here a prophet had come to maturity. Now, William Brandham himself, the man William Brandom was not actually the sheath waving. How many knows the sheath waving's Christ? But Christ had a bride body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So somebody had to come to maturity &gt;&gt; in the age we're living in. &gt;&gt; Now that man's name is William &gt;&gt; Brandom. &gt;&gt; Now he brother Brandham stood and his life the manifestation of the word that happened in him was waved over the people to identify what had happened. What had happened is men was trying to present JESUS AND THEY WERE CHANGING HIM FROM THE BIBLE. They were they WERE TEACHING THE BIBLE JESUS AND THEN THEY WERE SAYING BUT see he DON'T HEAL TODAY OR THEY WOULD SAY BUT YOU KNOW BUT THIS IS NOT A PART OF IT TODAY BUT THEY WERE CHANGING IT BUT THE reason they were changing it is because their denomination couldn't produce it. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT HERE comes a messenger. Amen. That's don't have to produce nothing. He's trying to teach you it's the word because you know something's happening and it's so supernatural. Some people think it's the devil. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, WATCH NOW. HALLELUJAH. THE SHEATH GOT TO BE WAVED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME will come forth for the bride age. Now, there's some people that are really uh they're really anti-bride age. But but you know when I'm a I'm an Arkansas hillbilly folks and I didn't ever have any term in my dictionary that was bride age. I didn't even know. Did you, brother Ray, before you come to the message? Did is anybody in here ever heard the term bride age before you come in the message? &gt;&gt; So where did that come from anyhow? &gt;&gt; Help me out now. &gt;&gt; The term bride age come from who? &gt;&gt; That's what I thought. So it's not a Baptist idea and it's not a Lutheran idea. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't my idea. &gt;&gt; But one day this hillbilly is reading Rise of the Sun and Brother Bram said, "For the first time." Ah, for the first time then. This is not the third time it happened. This is not the fifth time it happened. THIS IS THE FIRST time that it's happened. For a bride age, amen. There will be a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a MESSAGE THAT THE FULL MATURITY of the word has turned AGAIN INTO POWER AND IS WAVED over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there. SEE, IT'S THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD. HE WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD. SO IS IT TODAY? GOD'S WORD HAS BEEN FULLY MANIFESTED. THAT'S THE LIGHT. That's the light. IT'S BEEN FULLY MANIFESTED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, AND ISA IN ZACHCHARIAH, HE SAYS, "IN THE EVENING TIME SHALL BE LIGHT." WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? THERE'LL COME A MESSAGE THAT WILL MANIFEST THE SCRIPTURES THAT HAVE BEEN PROMISED for this generation. Now, in Isaiah 45:22, he said, "Look unto me all ye saved into all the ends of the earth. Look unto me." Now, how you going to see Jesus then? Amen. If if William Brandon, brother Brandham prophesied by scriptures and said the corporal body of Jesus wouldn't be on the earth till the millennium. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then Isaiah says you got to look unto him. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself says you shall see me. So the same invisible immortal God will appear behind mask as he always has. &gt;&gt; HE HAS APPEARED BEHIND THE veil in every age. HE APPEARED BEHIND VEIL. IT WOULD BE THEOPHONY WORD BEHIND VEIL IN EVERY ONE OF THEM INSTANCES. AND THEN BROTHER BRAM SAYS, BUT YOU GOT TO look away to Jesus. YOU GOT TO SEE beyond the veil. And once you look beyond the veil, you can see you can look, but what are you looking at? &gt;&gt; And how you look matters, right? &gt;&gt; Now, if if if it wouldn't matter, watch Jesus. Amen. Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness. Even so, the son of man must be lifted up. Now watch, it must be lifted up. Now, if you go back here and you see that brother Brandham himself was saying the sheath waving of the Old Testament was only a type of the resurrection of Jesus and that in the last days, that same resurrected Christ will use the bride church. And brother Adam's the first one to mature to prove he is THE SEED. AND GOD TAKES HIS ministry and waves it over the people. That ministry is a light over the seed. Now, IT'S GOING TO STRIKE over a Pharisee and they're going to say, "BROTHER BROWN'S ANTICHRIST." BUT THEN IT'S going to strike OVER A PREDESTINATED SEED AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, "IT'S THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME LIGHT THAT WAS IN THE BIBLE, BUT IT MATTERS THE SEED THAT'S IN THE INDIVIDUAL." AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's the truth, folks. &gt;&gt; When you look at the Bible AND YOU SEE IN 1 Thessalonians 4 that the ministry of the rapture is the ministry of William Random, the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. But God will use a prophetic word in that generation. When you see that and then you read Revelations 10 and you see a mighty angel coming OUT OF HEAVEN WITH AN open book and you see that's William Brandham. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S HERE. AMEN. and he's traveling across the the nation AND HE SAYS GOD TOLD ME AMEN IN THE CAVE THE supernatural I'm having brother Timothy he said it was the first two pulls of my ministry and he TOLD ME THAT I COULD TAKE SOMEBODY AND I COULD hold their hand my left hand their right hand if you did it any other way it didn't work left hand to right hand he said then I would be able to tell them whatever disease they had and he said I was supposed to pray for them and if they didn't get healed I was supposed to say to them God bless you and pass them on by because there's a curse over into that life. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID, "THEN IT'LL COME TO PASS. YOU'LL have a second pull in your ministry. And then when YOU HAVE THAT SECOND PULL, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM the very secrets that's in the heart." Now, that was the second pull. If they don't believe the voice of the first sign, they will believe the voice of the second sign. So the first two signs THAT HE HAD, THAT SECOND SIGN WAS THE MESSIAH SIGN THAT WOULD be followed by a voice. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard voice of the sign? So he wasn't just going to give a sign, BUT JUST AS JESUS CAME into the earth in two signs, but his THIRD PULL WAS HE was going to take the WORD AND HE WAS GOING TO TO TELL THEM THE SCRIPTURES AND HOW THEY FIT AND HE WAS GOING TO FULFILL WORDS AND THEY WASN'T GOING TO LIKE THAT very well. So brother Brandham had his first two pulls and then he's out there in California and he sees the 10th vision or the third pull. How many ever read about it? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a there's a there's a lot in the world looking for brother Brandon to return to a tent and all that stuff. But really what it was is it was a tent vision. Amen. But but don't make it complicated because he also was fishing and he also was holding the baby shoe trying to lace it. &gt;&gt; So why is it that people can easily see that the baby shoe is symbolic and the fishing is symbolic but the tent ain't? &gt;&gt; Come on. I I mean if you if you just just common knowledge would tell you one two. &gt;&gt; So Moses had a natural tent. &gt;&gt; THIS MOSES HAD A SPIRITUAL tent &gt;&gt; and he received a vision and it would be his third pull. &gt;&gt; Now that third pull, now I'm bringing it up for a reason because the third PULL WAS THE PART OF the ministry that WOULD SPEAK FOR ITSELF. THE THIRD PULL WOULD NOT BE WILLIAM BRANDHAM. IT WOULD NOT BE HIM, BUT IT WOULD BE AMEN. IT WOULD BE CHRIST manifesting the son of man ministry through that body by voice. HE WOULD SPEAK IT OUT. BROTHER BAM WILL SAY IT HERE CLEARLY. Look away to Jesus. The third pull has now been vindicated. Amen. I'm sure you all know what it is. Y'all know what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. The third pull of William Brandham's ministry clearly is is the first fold of the seven seal, the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't look at his ministry without seeing the appearing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't I'm I'm going I'm going to bring it further, but I want to just say this here in case you don't hear no more. That's the appearing of Jesus Christ. BUT IF YOU STOP it right there, the revival died in 1965. But if it was the ministry of Jesus Christ, THEN THE SAME REVIVAL BY THE SAME LIFE, BY THE SAME SIGN IS STILL ALIVE RIGHT NOW IN THE CHURCH of the living God. AND LET ME SAY THIS, OUR GOD DIDN'T DIE IN 1965. THEY DIDN'T BURY HIM IN JEFFERSONVILLE. WE BURIED HIS PROPHET IN JEFFERSONVILLE. BUT ONE OF THESE MORNINGS BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9, GOD'S GOING TO RAISE UP BROTHER BRANDHAM. AMEN. AND WE AND HE TOLD US HOW IT WAS GOING TO BE. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. But you see this? The third pull has been properly identified. We know what it is. The third pull is here. So in 1963, the third pull is here. People that are looking for it, I'm sorry. It was there in 1963. LOOK AWAY TO JESUS. HE SAID THIS WILL BE THE THING THAT starts rapturing faith. He was telling you his ministry. The third pull is the opening of the word. The mysteries revealed. The third pull is the opening of seven seals. The third pull, remember what HE SAID WHEN HE WAS IN SABINO CANYON and he was praying about them angels coming to him and he had his hands lifted up and a sword struck his hands and when the sword struck his hands, HE SAID, "I WAS AFRAID." And a voice said, "Don't be afraid." &gt;&gt; This is the third pull. &gt;&gt; This is the third pull. It's the word in the hand of a prophet. The voice come back. This is the third pull. What is it? Don't you fear it. It's been placed in your hand. Don't fear it. It's not your death. It's your ministry. LOOK, DON'T FEAR THE THIRD PULL. AMEN. Don't fear it. It's not your death. It's your ministry. IT'S THE PART OF THE MINISTRY OF BROTHER BRANDHAM THAT DIDN'T DIE WITH BROTHER BRANDHAM. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST TWO PULLS CAN ONLY BE OPERATED IN HIS PRESENCE. IT WAS IN THE MAN WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S NOT A MESSIAH SIGN WITH ANOTHER MAN. IT'S NOT A TAKING OF A HAND WITH ANOTHER MAN. BUT THAT THIRD PULL WASN'T THE MAN WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT WAS CHRIST. IT WAS CHRIST HIMSELF THAT WAS COMING TO HIM TO BE INTRODUCED. It was just teaching. Okay, that's one thing. But this is far greater than teaching, folks. &gt;&gt; This went beyond brother Eric. It went way beyond just teaching. &gt;&gt; In the message, look away to Jesus. Now, if you like the Hebrews 9 sermon, you can find it in Luke and then and then of course it paragraphs right off of look away to Jesus. Looking unto Jesus. All these sermons, amen, are coming from the inspiration out of Hebrews the 9th chapter. And brother Brandham then didn't look away to Jesus. He's coming into this lousy and condition and he's telling the people look away to Jesus and there's no no corporal body there. Now he's in the next few years, brother Richard, he's going to go all over America and he's going to say at the river he met me and said I'm going to introduce I'm bringing a message that'll introduce you for his second coming. and he goes and puts himself ON TRIAL AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. HE PUTS THIS MESSAGE on trial and he tried it all over the country in different places in different events and changed the venue many times. Now there's people coming along now behind him and they're trying to retry the case he tried in the 60s. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry. You're too late. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT A TRIAL OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM NOW. This is a TRIAL OF YOUR FAITH NOW. I am right. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE THAT? SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, BROTHER RE'S HOME HERE AND HE'S WRONG." THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHAT HE DID AND what was true. IT'S JUST ABOUT YOUR FAITH NOW. &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU can stand to believe it in the face of criticism or not. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS IS THAT HE PUT IT ON TRIAL and he says, "You're looking for nail scars." He said, "That's not the way he promised to appear." That's not the way. He said it was not the promise. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. When when Jesus appeared to Martin with nail scars and A CROWN ON HIS HEAD, MARTIN THREW AN INKWELL at him and told the devil to get out of his ROOM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WASN'T TIME FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM KNEW IT WASN'T TIME FOR THAT, FOLKS. &gt;&gt; He said, "But it is time for the word of God to be made manifest." And then he began to pull out and show you the manifestation of the word in our generation. SO IF IT WAS JUST AN IDEA or a teaching, it would just be now more theology. But it's way beyond just theology and and in the message look away to Jesus, brother Bannon comes along and he tells us he tells us something that that if you can get this in your heart, it'll help you on every sermon you listen to in 1963 4 and 5 is that when he a lot of times is saying Jesus, he's talking about vindicated word. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the word being manifested. That's what he's really dealing with is the word being manifest. So he's telling you God has done something. Now look at that. Look at what he's doing. And he actually gives us five manifestations of the third pull. How many are aware of there are actually five manifestations? &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands if you know there are five manifestations of the third pull. Brother actually talks about this and and and just just to bring them back to your memory. You remember brother was squirrel hunting &gt;&gt; and he said I was thinking about the scriptures and I was thinking about Mark the 11th chapter and how that Jesus made that promise to his disciples. Amen. And he said to them if you say unto this mountain be thou moved. And brother said I was wondering how that Jesus would say if you say. If you say he said I wondered it wasn't what Jesus said it was what you say. And he said I was wondering how DOES THAT FIT IN THE BIBLE? AND A VOICE SPOKE to me out there in the woods and said, "Brother Brandon," he says, "It said to me, it's just as true as all other scriptures are true." &gt;&gt; And he SAID, "I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IT. I THOUGHT THAT THAT'S SO CONFUSING TO ME. HOW COULD IT BE?" AND he said, "There was another scripture confusing to me of how Moses, AMEN, TOLD GOD A better idea rather than destroying the children of Israel." He said, "It always confused me how Moses could tell God a better idea." He said, "But then the revelation came. It was Christ in Moses. &gt;&gt; He said, "SO IF CHRIST WAS IN MOSES, SPEAKING UNDER BLOOD of bulls AND GOATS, HOW ABOUT UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST?" AND BROTHER B SAID, "WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE THEN IS DEITY IS GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF HUMAN LIPS." &gt;&gt; AND IT WON'T BE YOU SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Now that's paraphrasing, but just so you get the point. IT WON'T BE YOU SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE HIM SPEAKING through you. And brother man said just to prove it. He said I be to speak and you remember the story and he created squirrels three straight times and he said the devil said well the the woods are just full of them. HE SAID HE said well I sat there to about noon and never seen another squirrel. And he see what he done. He spoke those squirrels and then he come BACK AND HE TOLD THE CONGREGATION ABOUT IT. NOW IF YOU if you study closely many people get it confused and they get the first time he created squirrels confused with Hattie right? But it wasn't the first time. It was the second time it happened. So the second time it happened, brother Ram had been down in in Indiana down there where the rights lived and and you know how many enjoyed Melkazdc the other day. You study Melkazedc. Y'all enjoy that. And he was the king of Salem and the priest of the most high God. What a what a powerful study. Uh brother brother Howard. But you know where brother Brandham was when he created squirrels the second time? He was in Salem, Indiana. He was out there under a tree in the woods in Salem. and he's standing out there and brother said it was just like it was the time before and he said I created them squirrels and then remember he created squirrels and then he went back to the house and started telling the story that evening about it and he said but that last squirrel HE SAID I SHOT HIM BUT he went over and crawled under a log and I wasn't able to get him before it got dark and and and and one of the guys that was listening to it misheard it a little bit maybe and then the next morning he comes in in prayer and he's talking about it they're talking about going hunting and the guy says, "Well, if Brother Brandham told us the truth, &gt;&gt; he'll go out there and find that other squirrel today." &gt;&gt; Y'all ever remember him saying that? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, be careful what you say." Brother Bram said, &gt;&gt; "And that guy was making a liar out of Brother Brandham." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "I had never said it like that." &gt;&gt; But he said, "When I got out there, I told the Lord, Lord, if I don't find that squirrel, they're going to think I was lying to them." And he said, "I was standing around there and I looked around and saw a a a little thing laying there on the ground." He says, "THE VOICE SAID TO ME, just say where it'll be." &gt;&gt; Amen. SO INSTEAD OF NOW SPEAKING a squirrel AND SHOOTING IT, HE'S NOW SAYING WHERE A DEAD SQUIRREL IS GOING TO BE so he can find it to prove he wasn't lying to him. &gt;&gt; AND HE SPOKE HE SPOKE IT'LL BE LAYING RIGHT THERE UNDER THAT AND WALKED OVER THERE AND PICKED THAT squirrel up and then took it down to Hattie Wright's house. And he was going to he was going to take Hattie write some foods, you know. Amen. Amen. Hadtie was going to cook for him, but brother Ram cooked for her. Amen. And and HE TOOK THAT HE TOOK THAT SQUIRREL IN THERE AND STARTED TELLING that story and Haddie was listening TO THE STORY AND SAID, "BROTHER BRANDOM, HOW IN THE WORLD did that happen?" That's when he said, "Now, Hattie, I'm going to tell you this. IT COULD ONLY BE THE SAME JEHOVAH GYRA THAT WAS WITH ABRAHAM up there on the mountain that created that realm. HE CREATED THAT SQUIRREL OUT THERE IN THEM WOODS and had he SAID, "THAT AIN'T NOTHING BUT the truth." LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. BROTHER BRANDHAM WAVED OVER HER. AMEN. HE WAVED OVER HER THE REALITY OF THE SPOKEN WORD. THAT LIGHT WAS LAID OVER HER. AND SHE DIDN'T SAY, "OH, THAT'S SUCH FANATICISM, BROTHER. OH, I can't ACCEPT THAT. CREATION BY THE SPOKEN word of a dead animal just to prove you're a prophet. &gt;&gt; I can't accept that. No, sir." SHE SAID, "THAT'S NOTHING BUT the truth, BROTHER BRANDHAM." AND HE SAID, "THERE, SHE SAID the right thing." HE SAID, "JUST LIKE THAT SARAPHENEICIAN WOMAN IN THE BIBLE SAID THE RIGHT THING." SHE SAID THE RIGHT THING AND HE SAID, "HATTIE, you ask whatever you want." Now there that that manifestation was already taking place on animal life just like it did in the Bible in Genesis 1 when God created the animals. Now it's going to move to human life. Look at the evolution of the third pool. And it moved from the animal life AND NOW HE WAS SAYING TO HATTIE, "HATTIE, WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?" Brother Brandham said, "There was a sick uh sister there in a wheelchair. She was a really poor woman." And he said, SHE SAID TO HIM, "WHATEVER YOU HAVE DESIRE." AND SHE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDOM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR." SHE SAID, HE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?" SHE SAID, "WELL, I DESIRE THE THE LIFE OF MY CHILDREN." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "THEN THUS SAITH THE LORD, I GIVE THEM TO YOU, HADDIE, IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST." WATCH THAT THIRD PULL, FOLKS. ONCE THAT THIRD PULL BEGIN TO be waved over her. &gt;&gt; And when IT WAS WAVED OVER HER, HER ACCEPTANCE OF IT THEN ACTIVATED HER VOICE IN THE SAME THING SHE WAS ACTIVATED TO ACT IN. LISTEN, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. This message ain't just for brother Random in the 60s. Amen. AND WHEN YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND YOU'RE HEARING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, DON'T YOU LET NO DEVIL TELL YOU THAT WAS JUST FOR HATTY WRIGHT. BECAUSE GOD IS NOT A RESPECTORATE PERSON. AND IF YOU CAN ACCEPT IT THAT GOD CAN DO IT, YOU'VE GOT THE SAME RIGHT RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING TO TELL THAT DEVIL, I GOT A BABY, AND I'M GOING TO LAY CLAIM TO IT BY THE GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHY? [screaming] WHY WAS HE WAVING IT? WHY DID BROTHER BRANDHAM TELL IT? WHY DID WAYNE LAWSON HEAR IT YEARS LATER? BECAUSE IN THE DAYS OF the voice OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, THE MYSTERY OF GOD WOULD BE REVEALED. AND AS HE BEGINS TO WAVE IT OVER THEM, BROTHER BRANDHAM KNEW, GOD KNEW. When Wayne Lawson heard it, HE WAS GOING TO TELL CROWDS ALL OVER THE WORLD, I WAS GOING TO GO FROM CORNER TO CORNER SAYING, "GOD DID SOMETHING IN THE WOODS IN 1950S AND DONE IT IN A LITTLE CABIN. AND IF HE DONE IT THERE, HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR CHURCH. HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR PEW. HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR HOME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HIGH CLASS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NOBODY. YOU GOT TO BE A BELIEVER. YOU'VE heard me tell it, but I think it must be told. But my my grandmother, Brother Vernon's mama, said she desired to meet Hatty Wright her whole after she come into the message, she started following the message in the 40s in Jonesboro in 47, followed it all the way through. And after brother Bam had passed and went on, she wanted to meet this this Hatty Wright they all talked about. Of course, all the mamas wanted to meet her, you know, and and she said she went to a meeting at Jeffersonville and the seat was real tight and she went in and sat down, got up and went to the restroom or something, I don't know, and come back and there was a lady sitting right next to her and she sat down next to that lady and she was pretty miffed over her seat. Y'all don't never get like that, do you? She was miffed at the woman because her seat and they it didn't all work out. You can get the rest of the story later, but it didn't just she was a little bothered and and brother Billy Paul or whoever was opening the service said, "We'd like to welcome Hattie Wright tonight." And she's sitting right next to Hattie Wright. The woman was so plain she didn't stick out in the crowd. She was so poor, Brother Bam said she made $200 a year. She was so poor, Brother Bam said she had gave $40 to the building fund. And he SAID, "BROTHER NEVILLE SAW IT and got $20 of it and gave it back to her cuz he knew she didn't have any groceries." And Brother BAM SAID, "MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I WALKED in the room that day, I had the other $20 in my pocket AND WAS PLANNING TO GIVE IT BACK TO HER, and the Lord said, "I got something better FOR HER. I GOT SOMETHING BETTER FOR HER." LET ME TELL YOU THIS. GOD'S GOT SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU. YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO THIS MESSAGE. HE'S GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. I CAN'T GIVE IT BACK TO YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T GIVE IT BACK TO YOU. BUT THE GOD THAT SENT THIS MESSAGE. [applause and cheering] That's right. &gt;&gt; Some people think I'm crazy, but you go ahead and think I'm crazy. But this prophet said, "You got a right to claim your children." &gt;&gt; I've heard it. I've heard it a 100 times, Brother David. People say, "Well, can we create squirrels?" Well, Brother Brown didn't tell that so we'd all go out and be squirrel hunters. I am a squirrel hunter, but he didn't say that so we'd all be squirrel hunters. He would tell you that so you would KNOW THAT THE SAME CREATOR THAT CREATED the first squirrel can create ANOTHER SQUIRREL TO TELL YOU IT'S NOT WILLIAM BRANDON TALKING TO YOU. IT'S A CREATOR TALKING TO YOU. AND THIS MORNING WE ARE NOT SQUIRREL HUNTING. WE ARE NOT HERE IN THE WOODS HUNTING. WE ARE IN WE'RE IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD WHERE WE NEED AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN MOVE AROUND US. I THINK IT'S TIME TO ACTIVATE THAT SPOKEN WORD BY SAYING AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD AND PUSH &gt;&gt; ACTIVATE THAT FAITH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, brother Wayne, can we speak squirrels? This is my contention. Kai, we got a right to &gt;&gt; and we have the potential to. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean you will because that's a divine act of the will of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you you got two of them laying side by side. Then brother Random tells the story of how how he was hunting out in Colorado and and look it happened on a mountain IN COLORADO WITH A WHY DID HE FEEL THE NEED TO TELL US ABOUT his hunting trip? WHY DID WHY DID BROTHER RAM COME BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT HUNTING? I'm out there hunting. He said, "I'm out there hunting with these guys and THERE'S A BLIZZARD COMING." HE'S TELLING US ALL THIS STUFF AND HE SAYS, "I go up on the mountain in a blizzard. They've been predicting to come for days." He said, "All of a sudden, the blizzard was on me." And he says, "I like any smart man would do." He comes off the mountain. If you never been in the mountains, you don't understand what a storm is high. But you're not down here in the storm. You're up there in the storm. So that cloud that's 10,000 foot high. You're in the middle of the 10,000 foot. &gt;&gt; So it's a different kind of storm up there. you can you it gets so blind in snow that you can't see your head from your toe. &gt;&gt; And brother Brown was up there and he said, "I seen it was coming so I headed down to the camp so I wouldn't get caught out in it." And he said, "I hadn't gotten very far and a voice spoke to me and said, turn around and go back up." &gt;&gt; He said, I said, "Lord, back into that storm if you want to hear it from his own voice. He that is in you." This the tape, he that is in you. And he said, "I went back, turned around, and he said, I'm looking at that storm." And he said, "The Lord said to him, my voice, &gt;&gt; it still calms the storms." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I turned around and went back up there on that mountain and stood there." Y'all remember the story &gt;&gt; and stood there and said, "Son, you shine for three days and storm, you go back where you come from." Isn't that something? a prophet standing there in the in in in the in in the in the late 50s, early 60s, you know, 2,000 years past the great creator Jesus standing on the bow of the boat and there's a mortal man, born of sin, full of mistakes, standing there telling the storm to go back where it came from. &gt;&gt; And the storm turned around and went back where it came from. and the sun be to shine. &gt;&gt; How did that happen? Under this word. &gt;&gt; Look what happens. Brother said, "When the sun started shining, I looked up there and seen some deer." AND HE SAID, "I'D MADE A PROMISE TO THE Lord I wouldn't shoot deer for anybody else anymore." &gt;&gt; He said, "I used to fill their tags and bring them off the mountain." He said, "But I promised I wouldn't." And he said, "There stood them deer." And he said, "I looked over at them and he said,"Little deer, I give you your life. Go on." And the Lord said, "I you remembered your promise." Y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; Amen. What? It's so powerful, folks. Amen. Cuz there he stood. He's in Colorado. Nobody's ever logged it, Matt. So, Brother Ram said, "There I stand in virgin timber. There he is controlling the atmosphere. There he is speaking to animals. And there he's walking in trees that's never been cut." He was all the way back in Eden again. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Look at the camp he was in. &gt;&gt; He was in the camp OF EDEN RIGHT THERE ON A MORTAL MAN STANDING IN TIME. BROTHER BAM SAID, "ALL OF A SUDDEN, I STARTED CRYING." HE SAID, "AND I heard them tears hit the leaves and they were dry leaves." And he thought, "Oh my God." He said, "There it is. The wind had already dried it up." Amen. Because a mortal man had spoke to a storm. It left and sent a wind to dry away the residue. Y'all heard me preach ON CAN I CAN I PREACH THIS MORNING? AMEN. THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM. SEE, BROTHER JOEL, THINGS HAPPEN and then things are left over after they happen. Cuz the storm CAN QUIT. BUT A LOT OF TIMES THE STORM AIN'T THE COMPLETE PROBLEM. IT'S THE DAMAGE IT DOES WHEN YOU'RE IN THE STORM CUZ YOU CAN BE OVER THE STORM IN MONTHS OR WEEKS AND you're still DEALING WITH THE STORM DAMAGE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY ever heard brother Bam talk about the brown bear, the grizzly? He was the brown bear he was going to kill. And brother Bisco, there's brother Bisco again. Amen. And brother Biscoll says that he said, "I was on that trip." He sat and personally told me what happened. He said, "Brother Brandon didn't get the bear. The bear was there." Brother Brandham didn't get the bear. He said because he went with the guide instead of going with us young guys the way the vision told him to go. And he said we sat and rained for days and couldn't even hunt after that. &gt;&gt; HE SAID WHEN WE FINALLY GOT READY TO GO, HE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, BROTHER EDDIE, where's that bear? Where was it at?" He said, "I took him down there and showed him where the bear was." And he said he stood there and said, "You're going back to the horses." And brother Bam stood there with his hat off. And a little bit he come back up and said, "Eddie, it's going to be okay. We'll ride out of here dry." Now, it's been raining for about 3 or four or 5 days. Eddie said it rained the whole time. And he said, "When we got riding out of there, you could pass one of them saplings and hit it and they didn't have any water on them." He said, "We rolled out of there dry." &gt;&gt; YOU Y'ALL EVER WALK through the woods after a good rain? You don't stay dry. You might not get rained on, but you going to be wet. That's when you find out if your boots are actually actually waterproof or not. It ain't when it's raining. It's when you're walking through that wet grass on the way back to the truck after it rained on you. Amen. AND YOU SEE, BROTHER EDDIE SAID, "WE rode right through there and the limbs were DRY AND THE LEAVES WERE DRY BECAUSE GOD DIDN'T ONLY STOP THE STORM." AMEN. HE ALSO DRIED UP THE LEAVES. DO YOU SEE FRIENDS? STORMS COME INTO LIVES AND PEOPLE'S SITUATIONS HAPPEN. BUT LONG [screaming] AFTER THE RAIN STOPPED AND LONG AFTER THE STORM, THERE'S STILL THERE'S STILL RESIDUE OF THINGS THAT ARE LEFT OVER ON YOUR LIFE. BUT THIS MESSAGE DON'T ONLY DEAL WITH THE STORMS. THEY DEAL WITH WHAT'S LEFT OVER AFTER THE STORMS. AND THIS MORNING, I SAY THAT LET THE WIND OF THE HOLY GHOST BLOW OVER THE CHURCH AND BLOW AWAY ALL THE ILL FEELINGS. AMEN. THE LITTLE FAMILY FEUDS and situation. I could preach RIGHT NOW. AMEN. LITTLE SITUATION JUST ROSE UP AND YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE FOUGHT A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SAID, "I'M SORRY." BUT DOWN IN YOUR HEART, THERE'S STILL THAT LITTLE TINGE. AMEN. WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY GET RID OF IT, BUT THERE'S A WIND THAT CAN COME IN THIS CHURCH THIS MORNING. NOT ONLY CAN IT SETTLE THE PROBLEM, IT CAN TAKE AWAY THE GUILT AND THE FEELINGS AFTER THE PROBLEM IS OVER. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. Y'all know what I'm talking about. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I feel the Holy Ghost moving on something right now. &gt;&gt; You can sit down and talk it over, but you can't get rid of the feelings after, can you? That's why people are scared to death to have a talk. &gt;&gt; That's why people don't want to sit down and talk. It's because you all have had experiences of sitting down and talking and then two weeks later they still got that same little coldness towards you. Amen. Let me tell you this. Christianity is different than that. We ought to be able to sit down and bitterly disagree and put our arms around one another. It would take care of a lot of the anxiety that's in people's lives if they would get a revelation that there is true forgiveness. BUT YOU GOT to be able to forgive before you can receive forgiveness. Come on, church. I'M PREACHING TO YOU. I'M TALKING ABOUT SITUATIONS THAT RISE UP IN FAMILIES AND HOMES AND LIVES AND FOUR OR FIVE YEARS LATER, IT'S STILL A PROBLEM. IT OUGHT NOT BE SO AMONG THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. THIS IS THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I'm not a witch doctor. &gt;&gt; Amen. This it's not it's not it's not witchcraft. It's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And it wouldn't bring something up unless it's good for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even Can you imagine? Brother Brham experienced this fishing, folks. &gt;&gt; Here's for you fishermen. Brother Bram said he's sitting out in the boat with lie on Kyle Wood. Y'all remember the story? &gt;&gt; He's He's brim fishing. Anybody that brim fishes know you got to be quick cuz if you ain't quick, Nathan, they'll swallow the whole hook and then you got to pull the guts out. And when you put them in the live, well, they'll just in there and bait and they'll be dead. And if you're there all day, it was no sense even keeping them. And brother Bam said, "We were catching bait." So they wanted them alive, right? So you catch it because you're going to put it later, use it for bait and put it on the hook and throw it out and catch a big catfish or a bass or something. And he said he Kyle had had had hooked one and pulled the guts out of it and he just threw it back in the water and said, "You you little fishy, you shot your last wad." And just threw him right out like that. And brother Bram said, "Then they got to talking and he said, I told him said something great's going to happen here in a minute." And he said, "We sat there for a while and we got to talking and he said," Kyle got to talking to his uh brother Banks and they said, "Banks, we ought to go down to that lady that used to be so good to us and tell her what the Lord Jesus has done for us." &gt;&gt; And it so pleased the Lord. Brother Bram said he felt the spirit of the Lord. I I love the I love how tender brother Bram was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz if sometimes I have to be honest, if the wind blows, Nathan, it just the wind blew. [laughter] It's a little windy today. But brother Bram pulls his hat off and says, "Okay, he's here." And all of a sudden stands up in the boat and he says that fish, now y'all know fishing, had had laid on its side and floated over against the liies. He said, "Been laying over a half hour." All that stuff's powerful preaching, by the way. There's about a half hour of silence in the lily, you know, and but he was laying there and brother Bam said, "I turned and looked at him and said,"Little fishy, I give you your life in the name of the Lord Jesus." And that fish turned up &gt;&gt; and swam off. &gt;&gt; Bam said, "Now," he said, "I got all kinds of kids dying. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I've got needs, &gt;&gt; great needs all over the world." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "There he is using that on a animal." &gt;&gt; He said, "Why would he do it?" He said, "To tell you he cares about even the smallest thing." &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; YOU YOU SAID, "WELL, HE DON'T CARE IF I GET NEW SHOES." He does. &gt;&gt; HE DOES. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE PRAY AND AND AND and they be without the money they need and they got a little kid at home and they'd like a little certain kind of outfit or something like that and they go over to the store and sure enough that baby's on sale and $100 or something they picking it up for three or four bucks, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and and people that know they ain't got no money see their kid running around an hour suit and they go, "Where'd you get that?" Said, "Well, the Lord's just good." &gt;&gt; That's like a pastor driving the Cadillac. &gt;&gt; The Lord's just good. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; He cares. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells these stories and then he he flips over and then he tells the story of of his own wife and how that she had had picked up a tumor. How many knows how that happened? The the tumor. You ever read I I I don't I need hands. So I know if I'm telling this for the first time or Amen. So, so Brother Brandham in discernment, he he takes a hand and then he would tell them what they what was wrong with the person. He said, "And I took my wife's hand because I knew there wasn't nothing wrong with her." And he said, "When I took her hand, I said, "There's an there's an ovary on a tumor on your left ovary." And he said, "We had the doctor check and there wasn't." 15 years later, he said, "I come home from a campaign." And he said, "Joseph was acting up." And he said, "Uh, she asked me to whip Joseph." And he said, "I told her I just ain't got the nerve to do it." So his nerves are all tore up and he didn't have the nerve to whip his son right then and said she got mad at him and slammed the door in his face and said, "Well, if you had to live with him, if you had to put up with him and he said, I thought, poor little thing, she's so nervous and tore up, you know." And he said, "I went on outside to wash my car." Now that's a smart man. That's prophetic insight right there. He didn't chase her. He went out and washed his car. Listen. He went out and washed his car. And while he's washing his car, he said the voice of the Lord spoke to him. He said, "Go read certain certain scripture." Book Chronicles. &gt;&gt; And he said the scripture was when Miriam and Aaron had made fun of Moses. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You go tell her to read the scripture." &gt;&gt; So he went in there and said, "Honey, you've offended the Lord." Now, now, now guys, this is real tender area right here. &gt;&gt; But do you know, brother Bram said, "Sister, you serve the Lord as you serve your husband. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You've offended the Lord how you've acted toward your husband." And when she and when she acted like that, Brother Bram said, he turned around and told the Lord, said, "Lord, I'm sorry." She didn't mean it. And brother Bam said a few days later the tumor started growing. He said then it got to a walnut then it got to an orange. He said then it started sticking out on her side. And he said I tell you what he said I was home and he said we've we were planning. Now listen this is a prophet in case you're wondering how to handle things. This is a prophet. He said the tumor got to getting bad and we took her to the doctor. And he said, and I said that it wasn't she wasn't getting healed. So God was testing our faith. And he said, "I told the doctor, if it needs to come out, go ahead and do the surgery." &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Are y'all are y'all hearing? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's the way Brother Brandham handled it. &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, he said she was going to have to go and then I went home alone and she was going down to the doctor. And he said, "And I went home and I was in the in my living room." And he said, "I began to pray." And he said, "I had been home alone before." And he said, "I began to pray." And said, "Lord, I've come home to an empty house before." And he starts talking to the Lord about it. And he starts apologizing for his wife. Now look, look at the love. Lord, don't be upset at her. She She And he starts explaining, "Lord, she's a good wife to me. She's a good mother. She never complains when I hunt. She's never He starts He starts He starts taking up for his wife to his Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he starts when he starts that all of a sudden you now the reason I'm telling you that cuz you can watch the third pull almost every case of it was activated by divine love. And he goes he goes when that happened he said a voice said to me stand to your feet and say how it'll be. And he said, "I stood up in the middle of that living room and he said, when I stood up, I said, before the doctor ever touches her, it'll be gone." &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "The next day, I get a call from her and said, "Honey, I was laying on the table and the doctor came in to do the surgery and he couldn't find the tumor. It just disappeared." &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "See there five the number of grace." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Five different times that that was manifested that you could see that it was more than a man doing that &gt;&gt; that it was the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel like I've got long on you. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; It It's It's more than the It's more than just a man. It's more than William Brham. &gt;&gt; It's the fulfillment of scriptures. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And as those scriptures are begin to wave over the people, watch how that dealt with it dealt with it dealt with family. &gt;&gt; It didn't just Do you see that? It didn't just leave Hatty Wright a super spiritual person, but it gave her something for her children. &gt;&gt; Look at Brother Bram's own marriage. The third pull was right in his home. &gt;&gt; Do you see this? This third pull ain't something that's just abstract and it's out there somewhere. It's right in human life. It's right here. And and this message WILL WORK IN YOUR FAMILY. IT'LL WORK IN YOUR HOME. It'll teach you how to raise children. It'll teach you HOW TO TREAT A WIFE. It'll teach a woman how to TREAT HER HUSBAND. THIS MESSAGE HAS THE ARTIFACTS. IT HAS everything that you need. Amen. If you begin to lift it up for what it is, &gt;&gt; you see it. It's more THAN JUST THIS MAN, WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S GOD'S FULFILLMENT OF HIS WORD IN this generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to receive it in that aspect, then you begin to accept it for what it is. Amen. I I say this morning as our musicians would come, Amen, as you as you see it for what it is, as you begin to accept the message for for being what it is, that's when the message starts becoming its effectiveness on you. &gt;&gt; You see, that's why the that's why the devil is uh that's why the devil is always that's why that he's always against it. That's why he's always working. is that he he wants to take away from the effectiveness of the word. &gt;&gt; But it got real serious around that, didn't it? It's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's a truth. See, it it it matters. Y'all know it matters how you correct your children. &gt;&gt; Y'all know that. &gt;&gt; You remember Billy Paul? Brother Bram said he was going to offend that angel by whipping that child mad. &gt;&gt; You You can offend God how you treat his servants. &gt;&gt; That that that's not fearful. What that is is is it's is it's an acknowledgment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That what you're dealing with is not just another man, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or just another woman or just another child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The place of his manifestation in this last day. &gt;&gt; If you look for him, &gt;&gt; you can see him. &gt;&gt; If you're looking for Won't you stand to your feet with me this morning? If you look for him, you can see him. He shall appear the second time. I love I love how brother Brandham I love how he goes to God for his wife. I just love how he does it. God's taken up for him. He's explaining to God why she's a good woman. Lord, forgive her. She didn't mean she didn't mean that. Lord, I know her. She loves me and I love her and but God used a prophet to show to show that side of life and then when and when it got to that place look at the word come and just remove &gt;&gt; just he totally removed that tumor out of our life. &gt;&gt; You know he can do the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can cause the storm to disappear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Andy can take away the effects. &gt;&gt; He certainly can. I believe he can I believe he can move in such a way this morning that he can cause he can cause hearts to to notify and to realize that he's in their presence and then know what they're dealing with with with someone. you know, uh if he's taken away the problem, Satan always wants to remain uh in the situation by emotion. Um I I know I know through years of of dealing with experiences, my own experiences. Do you know you can you can you can either live past something or you can stay in it. And sometimes you you deal with people maybe they got into a problem with a church or they get into a problem in their family. 10 years later you can meet them and they're still discussing the same fight. &gt;&gt; They still talking about the same problems, the same things that was said about them, the same that it's just the same the same 10 years later. And if they don't do something, you meet them 10 years later and it'll be a still be the same thing. &gt;&gt; I remember I went down into another region. I won't tell you where it's at, but I was down in another region in the States and I went over to preach for a brother and there had been some church trouble years prior and uh the brother got talking to me. One of the pastors got talking to me about the other pastor and uh man had me all tore up, you know. Now I'm I'm just a vist preacher. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I just come to preach, you know, have me have my spirit all tore up. And after a little bit, I I got the courage. I said, "Well, when did that happen?" And man, it had been like almost 30 years. [laughter] I'm like, "Whoa, you ain't over that yet." You know what'll stay with you is what you allow to stay with you. &gt;&gt; Do you know you can leave it behind you this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. to those that look to him the second time. When you look at him this morning, you can see that he is a savior. [crying] &gt;&gt; You can see it. You can see that he's your deliverer. &gt;&gt; You can see that. You can see he's the one that set you free. I know personally what brought us up. I know what'll lift you up. It's the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

And we ask you [music] that your spirit, Lord, would just begin to move upon those needs. Father, maybe somebody sitting here this morning claiming their children, [music] Lord. I pray, Father, that faith would raise up in them as they do it. Lord, maybe as even as we have spoken, Lord, maybe there's things that are rising up in the mind and the heart, but Lord, we know that you can take them. Lord, you can deal with them this morning. [music] We give them all to you, Father, in Jesus name. We thank you for it, [music] Father. Amen. And amen.
