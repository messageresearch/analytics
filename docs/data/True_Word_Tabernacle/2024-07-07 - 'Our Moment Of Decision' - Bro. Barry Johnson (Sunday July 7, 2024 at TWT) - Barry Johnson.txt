Jesus trust you that way father we pray that you would just take this bread of life and break it open to us fresh once again in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated well um is it possible to have a little less monitor I don't know if it's possible I'm okay thank you um God bless you everyone brother Wayne had such a wonderful introduction it's just truly an honor and a privilege to be here brother Wayne has been I would say a mentor of mine for many years I think we got to know brother Wayne in 2008 he came to Calgary and uh we just formed a friendship there and it's just been a wonderful time he's been a real encouragement and a real friend to to me and and the assembly in Calgary and uh just want to bring you greetings from the assembly in Calgary Calgary Living Word assembly and uh sister Shelly specifically requested that we bring greetings and uh so yeah I just want to thank brother Dwayne brother Ry brother Nathan for their Hospitality it's been a wonderful time and everyone else who has looked after us it's just been a real blessing to be here so far and I know that we're just we're not even getting started yet so I am certainly excited and a little nervous if you couldn't tell but that's okay we know that it's all good the Lord will look after us and uh you know I've just been preaching in Calvary I'm I'm just going to be myself today and uh I hope that's okay we've been preaching in Calgary about God's Will and uh you know I I came in right out of the world brother Wayne said that and uh I'll perhaps get into that a little bit later in the in in the service here but I had a pastor brother Ken Boer many of you probably know him um he he would tell me many times when I would have a question I'd go to him and say Pastor I've got this question I've got this this this thing that I just am trying to work through and uh can you help me with it and and i' really like to know what God's will is for this situation and he'd say well God's will is his word and every single time he would say that to me and every single time I would leave him thinking why won't you give me something to go on give me an answer like I thought that's what pastors do they give you the solution to your problems my I had some learning to do but that's what he told me all the time God's will is his word and you know it became a bit of a struggle for me as he was pastor and as I was Deacon and you know we grew in in the word and the word grew in us and it was a wonderful time we never had any problems in terms of relationship but I just always had this little struggle in my my mind in my in my heart about how could God's will be his word it's such a simple answer seemingly but what brother Ken was telling me was what the message taught and I thought that was so good and it goes further than that and I'm going to continue to say this all day I say it every time I preach the message isn't just the words from Jeffersonville Indiana it's not just William Mary and brandham that's the Vindicated Prophet I know I'm preaching to the choir here but that's a Vindicated Prophet that God chose to speak to the this generation through so when we hear those words he's not just talking to a prophet just through a prophet he's speaking to us God speaking to us lip to ear what a privilege that is to understand that his will in a situation is actually his word so it behooves us to dig in and start eating the book we've got to eat that word if we're not willing to eat that word we're never going to know what God's will is and we're always going to be looking to the pastor brother Wayne give me a solution for my problem and it's never going to work if a man can give you this solution a man can give you a problem he's going to take it away from you but when God comes on the scene it changes everything so I struggled with this for a little while in my life and uh you know if you've ever had God speak to you I'm sure everyone here has if you haven't you will understand it one day uh when God speaks to you you know for sure that's God there's no mistaking it when he speaks to you and and really I think think we all all ought to come to the place where he speaks to us we speak to him but we just need to quiet ourselves enough to allow him to speak to us but one day I was driving to work and I was going through a little bit of a a time in my life and uh it was just interesting it's the way God does stuff he catches you off guard when you don't expect it that's when he's coming on the scene he specializes in that but I was driving and uh just heard this voice and I thought someone was jumped in my van it was the strangest thing but what I heard was so you want an answer for that question and and I thought you know what question just it was in the morning didn't have much coffee I love coffee I didn't have much coffee and I was just thinking what question you know just kind of driving along and uh that question about God's will being his word and and so I said yeah I do I I would love an answer for that and he said okay take a look at Joseph take a look at Joseph's life look into the story of Joseph's life and I thought wow his will is his word okay how does that apply though so I actually did go and look it up and uh it really is good to follow the leadership of the Lord when he speaks to you so I went and looked it up and looked at the story of Joseph and you know he had some real hard circumstances he encountered a lot of problems that he did not cause but yet one thing didn't change in his life and that was his love for the Lord he just was who he was he did not try to pretend to be anyone he was a dreamer God made him a dreamer from his mama's womb and when he had those dreams he just spoke those dreams and and while his brothers hated him he told them more dreams and his brothers hated him more but we know that his daddy took notice to it and then his daddy made him the coat of many colors and then his brothers just couldn't handle him anymore that was it they had to do away with this guy but this guy he had something in his life and that one thing was he had God's will in his life was what I took out of this this leadership of the Lord he you know he spoke to me directly about this so uh I don't know if we have any questions I thought my goodness how on Earth could it be that simple but what it led me to believe led me to understand probably rather is that it doesn't matter where we are and it doesn't matter what we're doing and it doesn't matter what we're going through he'll let us get right into the fire because he wants to be the fourth man in that fire he doesn't want to just leave us in that fire he doesn't want to just leave us in the pit he doesn't want to just leave us as a slave down in Egypt he wants to take us and bring us right to the right hand of God I I was like Wow could that be and he said yep it could but I know you want another one cuz I know it's out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established so he said you want another one you don't want just one so I'm going to give you another one and I'm like yes amen bring it and he said take a look at Daniel's life look at Daniel the Prophet again someone who just was he didn't do nothing wrong the only thing he did was just existed but he wound up serving God he winds up getting carried down captivity into Babylon and what happened to him he winds up becoming one of the princes of the governors it was amazing what happened in his life but both of those stories both of those instances what happened was they just kept the Lord first so it let me to believe that you know what I don't need to seek God's will necessarily even though don't don't please do not take me wrong with this we want to seek the Lord's will we want to say Lord I've got this thing and I put it before you and what do you think about it but many times I think we can be so worried I know I was this is what happened to me I was so worried about making a move in my life that I would be outside of God's will or he'd strike me with lightning that's not what he wants for his children that's not what he wants for his bride where I'm going to is typical for me the punchline today brothers and sisters is the word is in the bride and she has thus sayith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with that wordu we're going to get into that in a little bit that's good we don't have to be frightened about taking a step forward words in fact when I tell people back home don't sit on the couch and wait for God to bless you with the job brother bradam says be up and doing get going go and take that job that you're way overqualified for and see if God won't bless it he could take you in that circumstance and give you the ability to meet someone who owns a business that will blow your mind he's just looking for someone just like you that Joseph or that Daniel to come and work in his business but if you don't get up and get off the couch and go to work I don't even know why I'm doing this this is where it is if you don't do that how could you get that blessing and even more than that how can you not how could you be that blessing to that brother that man that's looking for you so for myself I I realized wow I I don't need to be so worried I don't need to be so afraid I can start marching forward and no knowing that I'm in God's will because I have his word that I believe the message of the hour I believe what God Said to this generation through the Vindicated Prophet so I don't need to worry I'm not going to live Reckless like I said we don't want to do that but if you've got his word you got his will now I know there's some folks that would take the other part of that quote and say you know what if they don't have thus sayith the Lord then they sit still and obviously right but when you recognize who you are and where you stand brothers and sisters we're going to get into this here my it's just wonderful it brother talking about our scripture today you know verse 23 out of out of what we just read in first Thessalonians chapter 5 and the Very God of Peace sanctify you not partially holy and the point I want to get to is he's done it right this is his work he has Sanctified you holy entirely Satan's going to come around and say well what' you do yesterday you remember what you thought remember what you saw remember what you said remember remember remember stop remembering and start reading and then eventually you'll start speaking and as you speak Satan ain't going to want nothing to do with you those thoughts will start to flee remind him say this to Satan and the Very God of Peace will sanctify me holy and I pray that the god your whole spirit and soul and body PR preserve blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ preserved blameless today I want to talk about uh our moments of decision our moments of decision you know David uh Daniel sorry and uh Joseph they all had moments of decision and I think if anyone really had the opportunity or occasion to really start to get upset and start to really maybe kick the dirt and say God why aren't you hear in my prayers why am I here why why why they were too that had that opportunity maybe even the right carnally speaking but I just can't help but think that they they maybe looked at this scripture and and saw that he is the one that's doing this verse 24 says Faithful Is He that calleth you and he doesn't say that you will also do it he will also do it it's up to him brothers and sisters and I think if we're willing to look at it that way if we're willing to give it to him to make it up to him it will change everything for Us Faithful Is He that calleth you if you've been able to hear the call in this age brothers and sisters it's because he's faithful to his seed he's not going to let one of his seeds go not one of his seeds is going to rot in the ground not one of his seeds is just going to get plucked up by a bird or or cast by the wayside none of them are going to be lost every single seed is going to raise up I just looked at this word holy out of verse 23 here in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 holy is G 3651 and it's it's complete to the end it might sound obvious but the last part of that I think is just just wonderful it's absolutely perfect is what it says that Strong's Concordance absolutely perfect so he's going to take you who are absolutely perfect complete to the end and I pray that God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ if we have his word brothers and sisters you have his will and I think the the the the the gist of really where I want to get into today is to understand that we don't need to be afraid we can March forwards with confidence knowing that all Heaven is going to back us up because this isn't our word we're trying to put out there we're not coming up with our own Revelation you know if we've got a revelation from God it's actually going to line up exactly with the word of God and if it's not lining up with the word of God we've been taught to just let it go cuz we don't have a thought coming but the devil loves to bring Revelations too brothers and sisters but we've been given an opportunity we've been given a benchmark to know whether it is God or whether it's the devil but if we got a revelation that lines up with the word we got every single reason to scream and shout when we get to church because we know that's God dealing with us it doesn't get any better than that not in the age in which we live in we know this whole world's falling apart around us it sure is in Canada I'm I don't think it's a whole lot different here really you know we had uh talked about this is one of the first things that I really got into with brother Wayne and brother Ken you know brother brother brandham and invisible the bride he says in one part just near the end of the message he says it says though you never did it in the first place and what a beautiful statement that is isn't it sir but you know we hear it said many times read the whole quote because if you just go down a few more paragraphs he says you never did it you never did it in the first place it was the devil that came around and Eve did it and Adam followed his bride because he would not ow his bride to go into destruction he needed his bride we know that but it's not as though you never did it brothers and sisters you never did it and that's not just what the prophet from Jeffersonville Indiana the Backwoods Kentucky hillbilly Prophet said I apologize if anybody gets upset by that it's just the way I speak but you know what he was just a man he was the man that God chose to speak to this generation through and the moment of our decision this is really where where the rubber is going to meet the road now our moment of decision is to decide was it a man or was it God who is speaking to us through that prophet and you know when we get into this book here this exposition of the seven Church ages where I'm going to get into is pick up your pen and right it's where we've been at church and and we've been studying the exposition of the seven Church ages but it goes from talking in in regular words and and you know the scriptures are actually italicized but he gets into this pick up your pen and write and if you haven't notice this all of the words in that quote are italicized and what that is is it's it's underlining it's highlighting it's expressing something to the people it's showing that it's not brother brandham speaking someone else is actually inspiring this note and this note isn't about him it's about the church it's about his bride it's so beautiful but how could we ever get this outside of a Vindicated prophet right what a tremendous blessing it is if you have the ability to hear his word if you have the ability to hear that God sent a prophet you got every single reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters my goodness every single reason to Rejoice you know as we started out I I said you know this is uh just a wonderful thing to get together and worship there's coming a day where that's all we're going to have and I just can't help but think you know every time we get together like this and we have a worship service maybe we have a sing song maybe there's specials brothers and sisters these are all opportunities to practice they're practices for the greatest special of our life we're going to stand before the king of kings and all Heaven is going to be quiet to listen to you worship think about how holy Heaven is how many angels how those beings were created that never will ever understand what it means to be redeemed so they're just going to be quiet and Marvel at these ones who were redeemed but my goodness I tell the people at home when they get I I know the preach into the choir here many times we have the uh the people in in Calgary sometimes can maybe be a little starchy maybe not just in Calgary sometimes people anywhere can be just a little bit starchy but I I want to remind you of what God Said through that prophet he said that this is the quietest place you're ever going to be brothers and sisters if coming to church gets you up uncomfortable there's something wrong we need to get saved because when we're redeemed when we're saved something comes up from the inside of the inside what we have here is an opportunity to express that life that he's put inside of us this is the quietest place it's ever going to be it's going to be loud down there is what brother brandham said it's going to be loud people are going to be regretting turning their nose up at the message they're going to be regretting not coming to worship service they're going to be regretting turning their back on what their parents taught them but my goodness those people who are up there they're going to they're going to way outshine in terms of volume and decb what those people are moaning about downstairs when we come together here we've got every single opportunity don't let nobody brother brandham says it don't let nobody get between you and that word don't let nothing get between you and that word and when you have something in your life and you can't worship you got something between you and that word brothers and sisters and all it is is a devil just a devil he's standing there right in the way of your blessing and as long as you let him stand there he's going to stay there and he might even bring friends if you're not careful kick him out the best way to kick him out is to start worship [Applause] him but you know what brother bradam said there at the end of The Invisible Union of the Bride it it's just in line with the scripture exactly in line with the scripture but I'm sure people many times even now I I didn't understand it for the longest time but if you look at it it's exactly the scripture Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect many times people must have just been shocked to hear that how could you ever be perfect how could I ever be perfect I thought that for a long time how could I ever be perfect well you ain't looking at this flesh if you're looking at this flesh you're missing what he's talking about entirely he's looking at that theophany body that he made for you before the foundation of the world the way that he created you so stop looking at your flesh and start looking at the word if you can do that then you too can be therefore perfect and you can say hey I never did it in the first place what a blessing that is I'm going to read a little bit out of the exposition of the seven Church ages if that's okay I of the the newer book it's paragraph 55 brother Bram you know in line with what we're talking about here you remember I I I titled it the moment of our decision because we've always got a decision every single day we live we're making decisions we're always calculating recalculating making decisions decisions decisions let one decision never change never let nothing get between you and that word brother random he says now we ask what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that's by the word of God that's by the word of God he goes on to say there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it and that's why I think it's so beautiful you don't have to be afraid if you want to know whether you got God's will start marching if you're marching the wrong way God's going to let you know real quick you're going the wrong way right something will happen doors will close doors will open too though says we can't ask it unless it's in his word and we can't petition our ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God from the word they are one and you know that's the biggest trick of the devil these days is to get into the trinitarian ism and let's Chop God into three pieces and then we can dissect and analyze you're never going to know God through intellect you're going to get to know the devil but you're never going to get to know God through intellect he'll let you go and March around in the wilderness around and around and around but you you can't separate God and the word and that's where I think this gets real good he goes on to say now then this word has left behind on the printed page is part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was life John 663b but that is exactly what he is I am the way truth and life John 146 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his Romans 889b there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word this is where it gets so rich are you able to bring this up if not doesn't matter brother don't don't sweat it I'm I'm just going to let this soak a little bit brother Bram is probably very familiar for everyone I I hope it is I trust it is if it's not I hope it becomes that way brother Bram he says these words so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart just like Mary and says Amen to that word when that man takes that word in into his heart and places it not just in his heart or in his pocket or in his glove box in his car but places it upon his lips why that's the same as deity speaking it's not like it's just like deity speaking he says it it's the same as deity speaking and every Mountain has to go and the last sentence of this paragraph is just so beautiful Satan can't stand before that man he can't stand before that man because it's not that man speaking it's the spirit inside that man that's uttering those words right that's right and you know that's why we're here brothers and sisters it's not to go to church to have good families and to just have a wonderful life together we're here to actually be the manifestation of the Living Word for our day that's our purpose here on life so that we can hang a weapon on the devil I remember brother Wayne preaching this one time could you imagine having your wife going and hanging a whooping on the bad guy that's what God has chose to do in this age to take his bride to go and hang a whooping on the devil that's so don't be afraid don't worry you're in his will take his word take it all don't don't be afraid we know that perfect love casts out fear and that perfect love brothers and sisters is literally the life of Jesus Christ in us it's not a portion of of the lord it's not a portion of the spirit it's not a portion of God we can get really Technical and try and separate everything and analyze it all don't do that don't do that just say Amen to the word just say it's deity speaking brother bradam he goes on to say and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again you know I I don't doubt for a second that all of that is here right it's all over but the devil wants to try and make us feel like it's not maybe it was the doctor maybe it wasn't this maybe it wasn't that maybe it was something else you know what we need to do is doubt our doubts doubts are the devil if we have doubts that's Satan coming around we need to have confidence knowing who we are and where we stand you know the brother Bram he says one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasp the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church and I want to bring it to you so beautiful it has to do with the word and the bride i i i every single time I read it I I speak it it's just wonderful brother BR I'm going to just glaze over it we'll hit some highlights in here and then we'll get into kind of what I had for notes but he he talks about the law of reproduction and and we're all familiar with it I'm sure in Genesis we know that God said let every seed bring forth after its own kind we don't just go out one day and say wow I got saved today I became a seed of God that's not the way it works what happens as we recognize that we were a seed of God and that word that we heard preached Came Upon that seed and it quickened it and it caused it to crack open and a life started to grow it's no different than the story of Mary what happened in Mary's life she had an angel messenger bring her a message and that message said that you know what the power of the highest is going to overshadow you oh thou thou Mary highly favored among women I just can't help but think about the bride and how highly favored she is among women among the church the female but to have that word come across the seed brothers and sisters something happens the the power of the highest overshadows that seed and 's a life that comes that life is actually what's his name Jesus Christ in The Bride of Mary and you know what Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever it's no different when we take that word of the message that angel messenger when we take that word and say Amen be it unto me according to Thy word there's a life that starts to grow inside of us and when that life comes to a mature place we can just speak the word we don't have to be afraid amen that's right but Bram he says here they and the bride will be so much like him they will even be in his very image this is beautiful he talks about this in the uh oh my spoken word is the Original Seed as well but they and the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image this is an order to be United with him it's not just to be like him it's not to just go and and be with him it's to be United with him they will be one they're not going to be two they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God and I think it's just so beautiful when we can look out and see sitting here today A True Word Tabernacle the very manifestation of the word of the Living God there's something inside of the side that wants to just say Amen to the word there's a reason why we came out to church and that's the fellowship with the lord it's so that we can actually be honed it's so that we can be fitted we can have some of the rough edges chipped off of us I just love how brother Bram talks about this I'm I'm there's one more quote I want to read in here brother Bram he says in here here is the secret of this here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride said amen to the word and when she did that something happened in her life and every single one who has ever had the new birth understands what I'm talking about and if you've never had the new birth I highly recommend you take a look at it there's a reason why you're here today and that reason is there's something calling you there's something groaning on the inside but that word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word isn't that beautiful amen you ever look at a husband and wife you see a a wife that just knows what the husband wants she understands her husband right and if someone were to say what would your husband do in this situation she would know right she would be able to say whether her husband usband would like this or whether her husband wouldn't like this would her husband say you should go here or you shouldn't go here should you watch that or shouldn't you watch that should you say that or shouldn't you say that she knows what her husband wants oh it's no different today she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord and I I just can't help but think it's exactly in line with the word when we have his word in our lives when we've had that new birth then you have thus sayith the Lord you have his will we've heard people say it before that you know it's like getting control of the bank account you got the full checkbook he's just given you the full checkbook you have all of the resources that you'll ever want in your life help yourself because I trust you you're my bride your word is as good as my word that's a lot of trust but here we have God speaking about his bride through a prophet to this age and there's a bride that's rising up saying Amen to that word I I I say be it unto me according to Thy word I don't understand it I'll tell you what honestly brother Barry doesn't feel like it but that's got nothing to do with it it's what the word of God says and the more that I don't feel like it the more I want to say his word says it I believe it that settles it those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise I think it's just beautiful this part she performs the command of the word in his name she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that's planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose brothers and sisters I I just so encouraged by this part here we don't have to worry at all amen trust the Lord with all your heart and don't lean onto your own understanding it's when you start to do that you start to get intellectual with this word for our day that's when you have problems but lean not unto your own understanding and in all your ways acknowledge Him and what will he do he's going to direct your path he's going to show you what needs to be done he's going to open doors that need to be open he's going to close doors that need to be closed he's going to pay the bills he's going to heal your body and most of all he's going to save your [Music] soul we can have so many good things in our lives but we need to have our souls saved brother Bram said you know one of the sickest things that he's seen is the church we all need to have our souls healed oh my you know out of the spoken word is the Original Seed sort of the parallel the comparison brother Brown I'm he mentions two scriptures right at the beginning of this and and he says in the in the exposition of the seven Church ages I think it's neat how he he just condenses it he says he was told to pick up your pen and write he had a message he wrote it and and and we just read it we just read some of it anyways but uh in in the in the uh spoken words The Original Seed brother bradam says I was given the message told to pick up my pen and write I picked up my pen and WR but first I'm going to tell you something and he talks for about an hour or more about what this is actually taking place and it's absolutely beautiful but in First Peter excuse me 1 Peter chapter 2 he says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and all hypocrisies I I'll let maybe I'll let you turn there I just get excited about it the beginning of the spoken word is the Original Seed where he says pick up your pen and write he says two scriptures he mentions these two scriptures it's First Peter chapter 2 verse1 and the second one is Ephesians chapter 5 1 Peter chapter 2 verse one wherefore laying aside all malice all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious isn't that wonderful to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God Amen and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in sign a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded we won't be confused there won't be people coming around with with message theology causing confusion in our lives there will be something on the inside of the inside that says no no no that's something wrong there that's an uncertain sound that's a bell that has a crack in it it doesn't ring true he won't be confounded in Ephesians chapter 5 for the husb husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body I just can't help but think that goes right back to our scripture in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 you know what Faithful Is He that calleth you who will also do it it's not up to us to do it it's up to us to believe it all we've got to do is believe it and then say husband this is your word you said this just need to remind him a of his word when we can do that we'll see him come on the scene you know brothers and sisters the first step the very first step I believe with all my heart is get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost in your life because without the holy ghost in your life everything that we're saying today might sound good but it's going to be just out there somewhere we're just going to be poking at it and saying that sounds really good and I I I don't know maybe one day I I'll be able to get there but when you get the Holy Ghost in your life this scripture becomes a new book to you the message becomes a new message to you you can begin to see what God is starting to do through the message of the hour in a person's life but some say first justification and sanctification and I say yes indeed The Works of Grace they're all part of it but isn't it isn't it interesting in in the in the book of Acts we were talking about last night wasn't it while Peter yet spake these words what happened to them the Holy Ghost fell upon them brothers and sisters we don't have to go and get Justified and Sanctified we don't have to wait till we're perfect to start coming to church if we do that we're never coming think about the thief on the cross what church did he go to how many times was he baptized what message did he believe the only thing he can say is I met him personally because he introduced himself to me he said amen to it just remember me when you come into your kingdom there are works of Grace but you know what we've got to come and get washed we got to get Washed by the Water of the word and when the water of the word washes us something happens to us I just can't man this gets me excited this message and maybe not as excited as some get but we'll see what the Lord will do yet the day is still young it's it's a wonderful thing to see the the word and to see it happen in real time and you know many times we can get people to church brother bradam says I'm afraid that we're just getting people to church we can get to church brothers and sisters and learn how to dress and learn how to talk and learn how to walk but that ain't it if that's all it is we're a denomination we've got to go all the way into Christ but you know there's been Decades of dogs dogmas and Creeds Creeds and dogmas and I just love this quote here this is out of uh this is out of its the rising of the sun it just brought came on to me this morning when I was studying this you know there's been Decades of Creeds and dogmas and and analyzation and and even now there's ways of doing things in the message of the hour there's no ways of doing things in the message of the hour follow the word of God if we're not willing to follow the word of God what we're going to do is exactly what they did when they came out of denomination when the prophet of God was here we're going to build a little box and we're going to say this is how we do it and unless we do it this way we don't got it but you know what that's right back into what you come out of brother brandom he says it there's been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there has to come one there has to be one one bride sir he says hallelujah has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics understands what it means to come to church understand what it means to dress right understand what it means to wear proper clothing understands Holiness understands all of that but there must come one that's not got only the mechanics but that Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost the Dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection he's not looking for a church he's looking for a bride he's looking for an individual intimate relationship with his bride and unless we're willing to actually go all the way with him brothers and sisters we're going to continually just have church we'll just be church members potentially even part of a denomination brother bramy says until we come back to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs that's what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job that's where you put the shiny stuff all over it and it looks really good whereas when there's no Dynamics in it he says no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamics that make it work and you know what he's talking about here is getting the Holy Ghost there has to be the power of the resurrection of the Living God living out through our lives I just love how he says it in paragraph 110 here he says that's what he proved that's what he isn't it interesting ing how we get caught up trying to prove it that's where we make a bunch of mistakes when we start trying to prove God we don't got to prove God there's nothing that we got to do to prove God all we've got to do is say amen and believe God and he will come along I don't know we were talking about it the other day there I I think it was brother Danny steeman he did a real good example of it it it just someone passed me a video months ago and and while he was preaching I think it was at a youth camp and he called two volunteers out of the audience and he said your Works uh I can't remember the names now goodness sakes and mercy no he said uh works and uh signs signs and wonders exactly thank you he said your signs your wonders follow me and he walked all around and he just kept preaching but he just walked all the way down and all the way around in behind walked around and and and they just followed him everywhere he went those signs and wonders followed him and he couldn't escape him he even tried to go a little faster than them and they just kept following him they follow the Church of the Living God brothers and sisters when we start trying to make it happen we get in his way but if we just let the Dynamics happen if we just come according to the word if we just come according to his will those signs and wonders will follow us everywhere we go we can try and outrun them all the days of our life and we'll never be able to escape them he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ the body of Jesus Christ he's speaking about the literal body of Jesus Christ in the grave but I just couldn't help but think the body the current body of Jesus Christ in the church that made that body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead till the son said he was dead the the moon said he was dead all the stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again now brothers and sisters where is he then if he's alive again is there a geographical location no it's in the bride and that's why I just can't help but say it the word is in the bride and we just read it the word is God in print form and you can't separate that people have tried but you take the dynamic power away when you do that he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him oh my and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest and this is the part that I think is so critical so beautiful but so critical for us brothers and sisters if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride he told us that for a reason some might say well you know different different times in his ministry would say this this was the end of his ministry so this was the culmination of all of the the progressive Revelations that brother Bram had and here he says it clearly if it does something different from the groom what's the groom if it does something different from the groom brothers and sisters it ain't the bride but I think it's beautiful he said we've got so many Brides brides churches churches but there's only one identification and that identification is going to be right in line with the word and you know there's times there's times brothers and sisters where we can get off the word and this is so critical also when we get off the word and a brother comes and says brother did you know this you were you said that and is that what you believe and you might even say well yeah that's the way I've been taught that's the way I I believe but he might say well did you know that brother brandham said this and that he said that because the word said that and did you know that that's actually wrong and when you have that correction in your life as a true son and daughter of God you're going to say wow forgive me I was wrong some of the hardest words for a human being to utter I was wrong but if she's the bride she will say it it's one of the most important things in a marriage to be able to say that I'm wrong if we're not willing to say we're wrong then we probably don't have a very good marriage he goes on to say because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she's what she's him isn't it interesting now we start getting into some of the stuff that's going on in the world I preached this at home and I hope it's okay but did you ever think it weird that this whole world is starting to want to change genders they don't understand man they don't understand the anointing that's on this age there is going to be a body change we had a prophet declare it that she is he is it any wonder that people are trying to change their genders I was talking to brother Wayne I don't know I I probably shouldn't say it I pr I was talking to brother Wayne this is real prevalent in Canada and I'm sure it's coming this way if it's not here already how people and I even noticed it this morning on my phone I was like goodness got to stop these updates you did you know maybe I shouldn't even say this you have a place in your phone in your contacts where you can now update your pronouns I didn't even know that but I was telling brother Wayne you know it just hit me the other day when someone asked me what's your pronouns I am I am you know that person probably won't understand it they'll scratch their head and say what's that but the devil inside of him he'll know he'll know exactly who is standing before him it's no accident that people are looking to change their bodies because of the anointing on this age Prophet spoke it and he just quoted the word but she is him I just can't help but think it's beautiful brothers and sisters many times we can get caught up in in formalism and trying to get everything to be just right and you know we have to do it this way and that way and you know we can wind up with a whole bunch of tradition in our life and and absolutely ground out that Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost in our life and and if you don't know what I mean sometimes if you've ever seen a lightning rod on top of a house there's a wire that comes down from that rod and it goes around the house and it goes down beside the house to a plate that's buried underground and what happens is if that house ever gets struck by by lightning that electricity that Dynamic power will just go right around that house and that house will never catch fire it'll be nice and safe as Believers we don't want to live in a safe position brothers and sisters we want to be a house set on fire don't we we want to see that Dynamic power in our lives I just can't help but think it's so beautiful you know what it was while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them and you know that's entirely possible because he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no formal works that we've got to do if we want the Holy Ghost in our life say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord Jesus just be it unto me according to Thy word and what will happen is you'll get the Holy Ghost but you got to be honest about it and then what will happen is he'll come to town he'll come to your place and he'll clean you up something will say to you wow I need to get in line with the word of God because in the book of Acts it says that you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and I haven't done that yet I I'll tell you a little bit of my testimony I was baptized in titles I was baptized in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost and it was interesting I was 14 13 14 somewhere in there but I I didn't feel any change I was instructed to to get the Holy Ghost you got to you got to pray and you got to pray and you got to pray and as you pray and you pray you'll work it up and eventually you'll be you'll be speaking in tongues and you know you got it then so I tried a little bit as a young fellow I was like man this is weird it's just weird I can't do that I don't want to do that I want the dynamic power of the holy ghost in my life but I wound up going away and many years later many years later I was able to to get I believe the baptism of the holy ghost in a Wednesday night e evening service just in church and you know what happened was that was different than any other time in my life was I said God in my heart in my prayer I didn't care who was there I wanted the Lord I wanted God I wanted to see if God was real and I said God if you're God then be real be God to me be my God and I'll serve you but show me show me that you're God and I wasn't looking for him here's a stipulation if you meet these requirements then I'll come it was none of that it was just me being honest if you're God then you can be God to me just be God to me and what did he do I was an alcoholic I was smoking full-time I I wasn't in a good spot in my life I was in a real bad bad spot but I was telling Brother Ray yesterday it took me about 5 years to really fully grasp the impact the magnitude of that testimony but you know I I went to the front of the church after service I while I was there in church I didn't know about a prophet a prophet the message Eagles Mysteries seals all these things I was like that's way over my I don't know nothing about that but there's something inside of me that says that ain't nothing but the truth I can't explain it and I don't understand it so I went to the front to the pastor of the church and I said to him will you pray with me because I just I don't understand what's going on man this is beyond me will you just pray with me and so he said sure and everyone else had left they had gone out of the sanctuary so we went and it probably would have been a location like this here and and I knelt down in my shorts with the pastor and we prayed and I've heard it said before that you know there's sometimes people aren't even allowed into the church if they're not dressed properly how can they be Washed by the Water of the word I think what would have happen if a deacon would have told me you can't come in here like that I would have said see you but God he had plans and I think the True Believer is not soon shaken She's Not Afraid she wants to see Sinners get saved you know brother bradam says when we lose our burden for Souls it's time to that we get back to the [Applause] altar but while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them don't doubt for a second brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost can't fall on you my point with all of that story is I believe with all my heart the Holy Ghost fell upon me in that meeting because I was genuine I was honest with God I was honest with my heart I said be it unto me according to Thy word I can't explain it how could Mary explain it how could she explain what it meant to be a virgin and how she's going to conceive Jesus Christ how can a Believer today explain that we can't we just have to say Amen to that word but you know what happened was it wasn't very long afterwards that I recognized whoa even though I was baptized in titles I wasn't baptized according to acts 238 I wasn't baptized according to the word of God so I needed to come and get in line with that word and you know when I recognized it when that Revelation from God came down into my heart because it didn't come from another human being it came from God I honestly I heard someone talking about being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins but what happened in my life in my heart was I shifted from thinking I've been baptized what's wrong with my baptism to wow if there's something more than I want it I want to be so in line with that word I want to be one with that word and when that happened brothers and sisters there was no going back no going back no cigarettes no alcohol there was no struggle with it you know what the world teaches is that there's a 12-step program brothers and sisters I'm here to tell you there's a one-step program you get in line with this word of God and he'll take away smoking he'll take away drinking he'll take away drugs he'll take away pornography he'll take away being unfaithful he will lead you to himself because Faithful Is He that calleth you who will also do [Applause] it but when we start saying oh no I've got to go and do this and I've got to go and do that and and and try the other you know what we're to getting in the way of God I would say we're even stepping into denominational Waters don't do it just give it all to God and see if he won't come on the scene see if he's not God I guarantee you he's God yes sir good PR out of the spoken word is the Original Seed brother Bram he talks about the pyramid this is right after he talks about pick up your pen and write but he goes on a bit of a a tangent a bit of an explanation there's some real real gems some real nuggets in here that I trust will be a blessing today he says in that pyramid you can take a razor but he's talking about the Pyramid in Egypt he mentions how Enoch was a part of that but he talks about how they built that pyramid and you can take a razor blade and you can't run it between them rocks where the mortar was it's so fitly put together and they said Solomon's Temple was the same see and many times I have read this and listened to it and thought you know these things it's just there brother bradam just says these words he's not just saying these words we're not going to stake our Salvation on it but I think he says them for a purpose there's an inspiration behind it we need to recognize it's not just about the Pyramid in Egypt it's also about Solomon's Temple Solomon's Temple this got me thinking about it you know that his Temple was built and there wasn't one sound uttered I know you're going through a renovation here are you are you that careful here there's not one sound uttered there's not going to be one sound in the sanctuary when we did our church when we did our renovation there we had trades guys coming and we would turn up while they're working there and they'd have their radio going in the sanctuary we're like guys come on but Solomon's Temple and all of his glory we know the temple there wasn't one sound made there they made those rocks and Polished them those stones for that Temple elsewhere God puts it together in a very specific way the point I want to get to is don't think now brother Barry's legalistic someone makes a noise in the sanctuary there could could be someone that hits a hammer someone could drop a hammer on their toe and go ow it's not a holy thing don't get me wrong I'm not legalistic being legalist isn't going to do nothing for you but they said that Solomon's Temple was the same it was so fitly put together but it got me thinking about it you know the holy ghost that we're talking about Jesus Christ the word of God it's all the same God almighty it's not different P portions different we're not no no no no no don't do that it's God the Holy Ghost is without sensation but it's not without emotion and I think a lot of people kind of get those quotes mixed up and they'll say that well I can't have emotion because it's without sensation brother bradam says if your religion doesn't have emotion then it's dead and you better go bury [Applause] it but boy oh boy boy if the inspiration strikes and he tells you to stand up and worship I want to say from experience I'd recommend it I'd highly recommend it even while everyone is sitting down and everything is in order I would highly recommend jump up and say hallelujah God has spoke to my heart you know what I'll give you a testimony there was a sister that did that in formal Canada on a Wednesday another Wednesday night service there's some of the best Services a Wednesday night service She's suffering with breast cancer and God said said to her stand up and receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ and she stood up and she was healed she started praising God everyone else was wondering what's going on who my she must be having a bit of a fit and she was God healed her don't worry about other people don't worry about people's opinions God is building himself a temple and that's why we do Renovations on buildings that's why we do new church buildings some people would say well that's that's Le oysan You're Building a Church you're putting money into a building all of the I'm sorry brother if this is too far you said preach there's still people that need the baptism of the Holy Ghost where are they going to get it in a Baptist Church and a Pentecostal church or a church of a living God a message Church where that word is preached the same word that Peter spoke while the Holy Ghost fell on those [Applause] people brother Bram goes on to say God is taking the elect out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word amen now I just about had a shouting fit in a hotel as I was going through this with what word this word the word that the prophet was bringing to us this word is going to blend so close that it will become the same you know I was talking on Wednesday we didn't get just so everybody knows the notes that I've got here it won't be the same exactly but I'm going to go home and preach this I got inspired for this service you know God is taking the elect out of the Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word God is doing this brothers and sisters it's not us and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word there Comes The Headstone crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace To The Headstone so beautiful God's doing this we just need to be in our positions and we got to be willing to March forwards you know what if there's an influx of people you don't want to tell people you can't come in sorry we're full I don't know if you encountered that here with covid but we had that in Calgary where we were only limited people there was a point in time where we were only allowed to have 12 people in our building so we had to go to group a group b Group C and rotate through all of that and you know what it did for me is it really made me appreciate having a song service it really made me appreciate being able to come to church and you know if there's more people that want to come wouldn't you want to make more space for them wouldn't we want to give them a place to actually experience what we've already experienced what a tremendous blessing it is to get saved to truly get the Holy Ghost because we know that that's the new birth outside of that we haven't really had the new birth brother brandham says that I don't have the quote today but am they're one and the same brothers and sisters we don't just come and get saved and then work for a while and and put our shoulder to the wheel in the church and then we get the Holy Ghost and and then we actually take that step that's that's getting into Catholic dogma that's getting out of the way of the word it's not what I want to preach today out of the spoken word is the Original Seed brother R goes on to say here you are like this see on there see how it way down he's talking about the pyramid way down here and it keeps getting closer and closer the ministry the ministry after a while here come here's Luther justification Justified Wesley Sanctified bunch here come Pentecostal restoration of the gifts now God is taking from there honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just EX exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with the word there is the bride take her up I know that we've all seen the stature of the perfect man pyramid I haven't put it together yet I've been saying it for a while but I believe we know that we're moving forwards this word is marching on it's not going backwards and it's not staying still the law of the universe that God put in play is that you're either growing or you're dying there's no neutral ground and it's no different spiritually speaking brothers and sisters but many times we see the pyramid and we'll see all of the different levels the virtues of the Statue of the perfect man and then we'll see the space and we'll see The Headstone above it so we'll have an incomplete pyramid with the space and then we'll have a headstone above it and we'll see Holy Ghost sometimes in some of them or sometimes it's just a space I I want to say today I personally believe based on this word that we're reading that we're talking about is that pyramid no longer has that space The Headstone has come down and it's now one [Applause] pyramid we can keep making it two separate pyramids but what's that going to do for us if the word is in the bride and she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with that word there ain't no separation there now some might say the Holy Ghost is the the the mortar but I like what brother meno says he says there ain't no mortar between the Holy Ghost there ain't no mortar between that Capstone and that pyramid there ain't no mortar it's the Holy Ghost but it becomes one doesn't it doesn't that pyramid turn into one pyramid now God is taking from there honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up I just think take her up Lord amen take her up but we know that we've got a few more days to go a few more weeks and months and potentially years who knows how long we'll be here we don't know we just want to give the Lord the opportunity to move in our lives how are we for time here we're okay amen out of the spoken word is the Original Seed you know many times we can look at the word virgin I want to look at that for a couple minutes she's a virgin to the word is what brother bradam says and that word can be taken and and and maybe conjured up in certain ways that we can feel like maybe we're not a virgin to the word maybe we're defiled to the word but we need to remember what brother bradam says is that this bride that he's talking about will be a virgin to the word that's right not a virgin to the way we think Mary was a virgin naturally speaking but she also was a virgin to the word and why was she a virgin to the word because she said be it unto me according to Thy word she didn't try and mix it in and say well mommy said and well Daddy said and maybe I need to go and do this or check with that or or the other she just said be it unto me according to Thy word and like we read earlier just like it was in Mary so is it in the bride today she's a virgin to the word bam he says now Christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil that's right Christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil you believe that amen he says now I can't explain all this I'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long Christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil is that right congregation says amen you all believe that that's why what was he God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil we got into this last Wednesday talk about the hybrid and you know brothers and sisters you can take just a simple example I used on Wednesday is you can take oil or and vinegar and you can take them and mix them up and make a salad dressing and you can emulsify it mix it up and make them look like they're one right and it tastes real good it's a wonderful thing you can really shake it up and maybe you can use a power mixer and you can make it one and it's good for a little while isn't it but it's hybrid because the two will never mix and you know what all you got to do to see if it's hybrid brothers and sisters is just set it there just just leave it give it a bit of time let it come to church give it a bit of time see what's going to happen if it's hybrid it'll separate always there's no way that you can change that brother bam he says is that right he was was done to do that Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil he was born to be that to destroy the works of his devil now one time that was good to look back and say yep that's what Jesus was for but I love how brother Brandon brings it right up to the present time and we know this is God doing it with brother bradam through brother Bram some might say well this was before the seals I'm not interested in any of that I'm I'm interested in saying this is God's Prophet while he was yet in his mother's womb that's the way it works he's bringing this message here now his body where's his body today his body is to do the same not just to come to church but to destroy the works of the devil brothers and sisters to destroy the works of the devil because the body is head and body together is that right if Christ as the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was that's right that right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word and that's where I was getting at a little bit earlier understanding that it's not our dos and don'ts it's not our right and wrong in our flesh or even in our spirit it's in our soul it's saying that I got no other room inside my soul than for his word only his word can fit inside of my soul and that's the only thing that I'm going to allow inside of my soul it's not our bodies it's not our our minds even it's not our flesh brothers and sisters don't look at our flesh the devil wants to get you looking at your flesh he wants to get you looking at your brother or sister's flesh don't do it look at the word take the word I hope it's okay that I've got these quotes here there's just so many nuggets it just it just does something to me you know brother bradam he goes on to say tell me where he ever said organize tell me where the head all say it's all right for women to cut their hair huh mention it it's not there tell me where the head ever said these works I do but you shall not do them tell me that that ain't the way it is we're supposed to do the works he wants to accomplish something that he never did while he was here in his Earthly Ministry and we know brother brandham says it through this bride but the head said this you want to put the scripture down I'll give it to you John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you also that's his body see see now why I have been so so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body my goodness the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real rain the former and the latter reain brothers and sisters the real rain and it's got to have a seed to fall on I hope I live to see it do you understand now I can't help but imagine there's people there that did not understand this it will be the Living Word as it was at the beginning the spoken word of God have his power for it is in him in his own body working his own way he's going to do it his way brothers and sisters whether we like it or not it's much better if we can just go along with his way but his way is his word that's his will but there's moments of decision in our lives that we have to make and we have to be willing to say I I'm going to decide to follow that word or I'm going to decide to filter that word I'm going to say well I'll take most of what that Prophet said but because of this or that or the other I'm just going to leave that other part out and when you do that what happens we talked about it you ground out that Dynamic power that wants to come down on the mechanics you don't want to ground that power out you want to take that lightning rod off and throw it away you want to let that lightning strike that house and set it on fire you want to see the Lord come and take full possession brother bradam carrying on he says and when you become not your own this is where you got to get out of control brothers and sisters it just it just gets a little bit out of hand when you're not become not your own God knows knowed and forew by for knowledge who would take this gift and who would use it in the right way those who have it are Vindicated by the word of God with the rest of the word and spirit say is that clear someone have you believe it comes by schooling scholarship degrees if you go to school so long if you become a bishop study or be a pope or you become a cardinal or something like that that some would have us believe that's where it comes from when Man by laying on of hands made you something to do it brother Bram here says there off the word right and we can look at the Catholic church and say yeah oh yeah amen we can look at all of the theological schools and say yep Pentecostal church Baptist Church Methodist Church Nazarene Church Brothers and Sisters what about the message Church what about when we see the message Scholars now I want to say brother brandham said they're off the word because they're trying to make it something that they feel like it should be when it is what it is it is the word of God it's the literal life of Jesus Christ am we know John was a type of the Bride that's why he was told to take the book and eat it up yes sir it's going to be sweet as honey in your mouth oh my it's going to roll off our tongues so smooth oh we're going to love the taste of that but when it comes to coming to church half an hour early when it comes to actually serving the lord the way that God God gave us in the age in which we live in oh it's going to be bitter in our bellies it's not going to feel good but I'll tell you what brothers and sisters when you take that flesh and you say you know what you've got nothing to say you got nothing to say I love that song that we sang this morning I can't remember the words exactly come on soul don't get tired on me now get up and worship it's all about our soul it's not about this flesh this flesh doesn't like it none am I know brother Bram in this quote here this this just gets me really gets me I want to say to anyone who would hear my voice this morning brother bradam he goes on to say now listen closely now how different Jesus was in his way in his days from the denominations of his day you they would point back to him how I'd like to hold on this a while pH they would point back over their shoulder back down through time and say we are Moses disciples we know that God appeared to Moses in the burning bush we know they know they know the history of Moses but they did not know the god of Moses now as we go through and read this I want to continue reading it I want to say brothers and sisters we can look back and say we know William Mary and Brad we know where he lived we know where he went to school we know where he was raised we know all about him but do you know the god of William Mary and brandham because if you don't know his God I want to say get to know his [Applause] God you can't just live on tradition we cannot live on another man's experience brother Bram says it in this quote it's a painted fire you can't get warm beside a painted fire you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Fire it's got to be Jesus Christ they know the history of Moses but they did not know the god of Moses cuz he stood before them he literally stood before them can you imagine that in John 6 and said before Moses was before Abraham was I am the burning bush they know Moses history they even spoke about it that Moses talked to him in the burning bush they spoke about him but they couldn't recognize him when he was standing right in front of them why you know I talked to the church about Ephesians chapter 5 and I think it's so beautiful you know wives submit yourselves unto your husbands and husbands love your wives just like Christ loves the church we can talk about the rules but what I always do is go back to that verse just before that it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God and if we're not willing to actually submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God then the rest of it is going to be legalism brothers and sisters we're going to be saying as husbands just get in line just get in line submit yourself that's what the word says that ain't the way we want to have a marriage we don't want to have a marriage that way we don't want our wives feeling that way you know when we've got that what what what would it be like if God started talking to us that way huh Jesus we call ourselves the bride but Jesus said just get in line or you're going to get it it's coming your way the word of God says submit that ain't no relationship is it we got to be willing to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God and you know the other scripture that I always go to it says humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and what will happen he'll lift you up he'll raise you up and it's not going to be you floating he's going to raise you up in Revelation he's going to raise that word in your life so how how do you humble yourself in the sight of the Lord maybe it could be in praying maybe it could be coming to the altar the front of the church that's what I say to people it's not coming to the altar when we think that that's what it is it's not what it is brothers and sisters humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord tell your brother your sister I'm sorry tell your husband your wife I'm wrong ask your parents to forgive you because of what you've done go to your pastor and say you know I I said this about you and I was wrong you know there was a brother that did that with brother bradam and brother bradam he said I'm so happy for that brother because God's blessed that brother abundantly why because he questioned my Ministry but yet he took the courage I'm so proud of that man he took the courage to come and apologize to me and what brother bradam says he wasn't apologizing to me he's apologizing to God brothers and sisters don't think that's just for the prophet and the prophet's office he's listening all the time to our voice but if we want to actually be lifted up we need to make sure that we're humbling ourselves in the sight of the Lord and we got brothers and sisters all full of the Holy Ghost where's God's sight why brother Bram he says so is it today they know the god they claim they know the word of Christ but they don't know the God that was in Christ painted fire who could get warm by a painted fire a seminary experience they told Moses but not his God Jesus could and did say I just think it's so it's magnificent really when we look at this to see the way that brother bradam is talking to us the way that the the Lord is speaking to us through this word recognizing that he's he's trying to encourage us about something that we would get the background story that we would understand what he's really trying to get across to us that we don't have to live in fear we don't have to continually not move forward and wait for God to move things to open doors to cause situations to happen we need to be up and doing and marching forward and trying to do things of course including him every step of the way because that's what believers do but not being afraid that we're going to actually make a mistake brother bomy says and at 12 years old he confounded the scribes and the Pharisees oh my that spoke of it why didn't they say something to him as a kid it was God's word they couldn't withstand that no wonder the people were astonished at his Doctrine he says do you ever read that Mark 1:22 if you want to put it down the people was astonished at his Doctrine because he taught like somebody that had Authority he knowed what he was talking about see the church now should have a double portion of the spirit for it is true true like Elijah's garment that fell upon Elisha a double portion the same thing come from Jesus Christ now you say oh brother Bram you're talking about his church that's right that's his body brother Bram he talks about how the body only moves because the head's attached to it and he says what would it be like if you had a body and a head together but the body was actually cast in concrete right and you said move your hand you would try and move and try and move you couldn't move move my legs move my legs you couldn't move there would be nothing you could do brother bam talks about that being exactly what it's like to be hybrid the head is calling for the body to move but the body puts itself in a box and says this is how it is this is the way we do it this is the only way it's ever going to happen and you're stopping the power of God he can't move in our lives then you know brothers and sisters I I had talked a little bit about it earlier I I'll maybe just give you a little rundown I I I came right out of the world my my wife she worked for a company that I I worked with I worked for a home builder and and uh she worked for a kitchen company and and uh we built new houses and we had lots of service work as any company does and and we actually had to uh deal with a kitchen company to fix the service work and I would phone there and talk to this one girl that worked in the office she always got it done every single time it was you know it's either going to happen or you get a phone call to say it's not going to happen so you didn't have false expectations and the other girl in the office was good but not as good not nearly as good not nearly nearly nearly as good this one girl but you know um she was able to witness to me the the people that I worked with they saidou better be careful when you talk to her on the phone because she'll hang up if you swear and I thought wow okay she's a Christian girl all right that's fine I'm good with that and at that time I was drinking I was smoking I was hungering and thirsting for righteousness I had no idea where to go and I was too afraid to try anything I was afraid that the church would get my phone number or my email and want my tithes I had a friend who said to me after I got saved he said what I said yeah man I got saved and I mean I got really saved I got Holy Ghost saved and he said just give me your money forget about it and I was like no no no no you don't even understand man I'm not even going to hang out with you anymore but I had to give the testimony you know but at that place in my life there was an attraction there was an attraction and it wasn't to a girl at all there was nothing to do with a girl my parents were divorced and I had some bad experiences in the world and I was done with women there was no getting married for me I had no desire to get married and I know some people they thought well you know he just went to church for the girl and many people probably still do and that's fine they can think that but you know we know the truth um there's no way that my wife now would ever have had anything to do with a boy in the world it just wouldn't happen but what her her resounding thought was her resounding just couldn't shake it she couldn't get rid of it was you got to get that guy to church you got to get that guy to church and and so she started to invite me to church and I started to resist I was like man I don't want to go to church now I I'm not ready for it yet and when would I be ready for it I don't know but she tried to invite me to some special meetings because there was a guest Minister coming to town and I I I I I thought I don't know I don't know and and there was a time where I was in the world and uh just like I told you earlier I heard the voice say to me you know do you want an answer on that question um I saw her phoning me as I was driving and this was before distracted driving laws by the way but I saw her phone on me and I was like oh no I don't want to answer she's just going to invite me to church no not going to answer and so I didn't and I heard that voice the same voice nowadays I can go back and connect the dots and say I recognize that voice but that voice said to me that just might be your last call and I I knew that wasn't for alcohol I was like man okay so I phoned her back and she said you thought I wanted you to come to church well I'm I'm not inviting you to church and I was like okay Dodge that one she said we're having a a get together and and you know we just like to invite you to come to that just uh like we had last night God bless you brother Nathan that was a wonderful time really enjoyed that but just to get together like that with the Believers and so that's where I went to but you know you know in going there there was one person that actually witnessed to me my wife didn't even witness to me I was sitting there and and I took the time to not really allow myself to get witnessed to I didn't want anybody to preach to me I just wanted to sort of get a feel for what's going on here and and it was really good until the end of the night right the end of the night there was a guy sitting beside the fire and you know we're in Calgary in July and it's not very warm I think in uh in Fahrenheit terms it would probably have been about 70° and so it's in the evening and this guy is sitting wearing jeans baggy jeans and a hoodie with a hood and uh I'm like you know he's my kind of people I was kind of running with some Motocross people and skateboarders at the time and it's just the people that I was with I wasn't really that way but I thought you know what safe to sit down beside him and so I went and I sat down beside him and the first words out of his mouth was so what church do you go to and I thought oh Lord here we go here we go so I took the time and I laid my case out I you know there was no hurry to go anywhere so I laid out the case real good and uh I didn't realize that this man was the minister for the weekend that just passed and this Minister was actually a lawyer some of you might know brother Aaron mcgi so he took he took my case and properly dissected Ed it and then handed it back to me and he said you know the way that you're judging all the people is causing you yourself to be that and I said to him that I actually you know I think there a lot of hypocrisy around Christianity there's a lot of hypocrisy people that claim one thing and do something else and we all know what that is but he said to me you know the way you're judging everyone to be this way is causing you yourself to be one and I was like wow okay kind of shattered my my thoughts about it you know and at the time I couldn't even remember what he said it wasn't until many years after I had to say to him what was it you told me there again I can't even remember it and he remembered he's a lawyer they remember but he told me that what the way you were judging everyone was causing you yourself to be a hypocrite and so you know that those words were just incredible for me because it was enough for me to say I need to go and take a look at this and now you can fast forward to where I said I went to church the very first time it wasn't a special meeting it wasn't a special Minister it was the pastor and by going to hear those words what happened while he yet spake those words I believe the Holy Ghost fell upon brother Barry and you know how I know that is everything in my life changed in that moment in that instant in that twinkling of an ey brothers and sisters my body was changed I was already in the Rapture in that moment and you know what it's no different for anyone else you might get the Holy Ghost because someone lays hands on you you might get the Holy Ghost because you get baptized in water you might get the Holy Ghost because someone preaches the word of God it's God don't try and put them in a box you try and put God in a box it's right there that he's going to chuckle and say you're not going to do it it's not going to happen but I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters that today today I just want to say you yourselves you're the Manifest ation of the Living Word of God when we have the ability to take the word I just think it's beautiful the way brother Bram says it the spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word of God in his heart and places it upon his lips it's no longer that man it's no longer that woman speaking it becomes deity speaking and you know that's the Holy Ghost is deity don't be afraid of the Holy Ghost be afraid of all the other ghosts but once you get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters he casts out all fear you can go and walk through a graveyard you don't have to whistle because you know that you're never going to be there you're only going to be just traveling through you're going to be walking right through there my goodness I feel like I could just keep going and going here there Comes A Time brothers and sisters where we need to look past all all of our faults and just look to his word and that includes all of the people that we know one of the worst things that we can do as a human and I I'm not trying to get psychological at all one of the worst things that we can ever do as a human being is look at another human being and think that they should be another way and then get upset at them because they're not the way that we think they should be that's especially prevalent with parents it could can be that way with spouses can be that way with pastors and deacons and song leaders and sound guys it can be that with everyone don't do that we don't want to do that we want to look past all of our faults and look to Jesus Christ look at our brothers and sisters and say I see the manifestation of the Living Word in my brother and my sister right there that's God In the Flesh the manifestation of the Holy Spirit living out through that human being and you know what brother bradam says we can have a character assassination on our brother and our sister just by talking about them we don't want to do that brother Bram says say nice things say nice things about your brother or your sister personally I believe it you can actually create an atmosphere around that person by speaking nice things about them they can be hundreds of miles away brothers and sisters but you can speak nice things about our brothers and our sisters we need to look past our faults and just look to his word [Music] brother bam he says in the spoken word is the Original Seed now the power of the believing Church Christ has all power in heavens and earth you believe that congregation says amen he says now what if he's in you now what if he's in you I love how he does that he takes it and makes it personal and that's really the way God wants it to be a personal intimate relationship not something nothing that's just the church and the state something that's way out there it's just your pastor's relationship with the Lord no no no no no he says the seed of Christ must m u s t must come through his body not a denomination but through a born again seed of the word must come through now remember what is it it's Christ's seed and he says how does how does my seed come through through the body how does the apple tree seed come through the body seed is through the body and I'm going to throw this in this is Brother Barry's just injection brother bradam he even says it that healing comes through the body how does the apple tree seed come through the body seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ that right now I'm I just want to just make it clear brother Barry ain't saying the Catholic Church the denominational Church you you all we all know we all believe this the same way the church the elected lady the elected bride of Jesus Christ that right says amen the Bible Church the birth produces that's the new birth himself in body his church is his word so that the people can see the confirmation of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe that amen these are not denominational hybrids now this is those who's in the orbit waiting for the countdown you know what I mean fixing to take a rocket to Glory I just want to say God bless you brothers and sisters I'm I could keep going but I don't think I will I want to start wrapping it up now I'll call the musicians up I just want to try and encourage us to recognize our position and you know we have decisions to make but don't be afraid to make decisions every single moment of our life we're going to be able to make decisions but we don't need to be afraid of making those decisions when we have his word because when we have his word we have his will and we've got those two things speak the word and go forwards don't cry speak the word and go forwards because when you do that brother bradam said it it's the same as deity speaking through you I think that's just tremend tremendous tremendous God richly bless you today I'll pass it back to you brother Wayne if you want to stand with me as we close this morning certainly thankful to be here with you all trust that we'll be able to to meet again someday soon

of everything oh his name is wonderful Jes you know when the Holy Spirit comes by and amen says things sometimes so clearly that you just can't miss it you know he just speak so directly and amen I I I certainly thank uh brother Barry for the sermon this morning I believe it was more than Barry I believe the Holy Spirit took a man and used his voice and his testimony and his experience with Christ and and I know you're enriched and you've been blessed and been spoke to it by it and I was just sitting chuckling when he said that the devil told him you know uh uh all they want down there was your money you know and your friends said take it you know it's it's the funniest thing how the devil dissects things isn't it because when brother Barry was talking he said I smoked cigarettes and I was an alcoholic but when he come to Christ and he started paying his tithing to the Lord do you know where' them cigarettes go where did all that beer he drank go how much money was he spending a week in cigarettes and beer and party and and and the devil didn't Point any of that out to him isn't that amazing how the devil speaks a certain thing to point out he probably traded a $1,000 a week habit for whatever little bit you know that you give back I tell you what I'd lot rather give m to the Lord I'd like rather give mine to the Lord amen that's right you know um I uh I I thank God for the life he's given us but brother Barry and I I've had some very Supernatural experiences with God you know uh one time that I know for sure that I saw a man raised from the dead brother Barry Johnson was standing right beside me Zachariah wherever he's at this morning right Zach was standing on the other side of me and we were standing over the body of his Pastor brother Ken borer and brother Ken was laying there he had just had a serious serious four-wheeler accident and he was laying there and he was breathing uh he you know I I it it was just a gasp and then all of a sudden the gas stopped and brother Barry looked over at me and said brother Wayne what are we going to do we didn't have no phone signal we couldn't call in an ambulance there was no medical staff and I looked at brother Barry I said brother Barry God has so arranged things that the only thing we can do is call call on the name of the Lord and Barry and I and Zachariah and uh Logan borer reach down and put our hand upon brother brother Ken and I said these simple words I said Lord Jesus you've arranged this so we have no one to call but you this is a pastor and his congregation needs him God would you give his life back to him and the man started pulling a breath it's like you could hear it's like breath just came back in and he stood to his feet from from that and immediately stood to his feet and started worshiping the Lord now there's a witness there's another witness and I was it six years your brother Ken live six more years seven six seven years brother Ken passed away within the maybe a week of the exact date six or seven years later in August you know the Holy Spirit gave that that that family Grace and and did it but you know um I tell you this you want to take him with you wherever you go whether you fishing or riding a four-wheeler or whatever you doing you want to take him with you amen and I I have been so blessed for our relationship with brother Barry and how many will pray for him amen and ask God the blessing we're we're going to take him fishing tomorrow pray God give him a big old fish amen and bless him amen it's it's a it's a great great honor to have him with us and his wife sister Lisa amen we have a special day today we're going to have a water baptism uh brother Matt is going to be baptized today and brother Riley is going to be baptized today and I believe sister pansy is going to be baptized today and if there someone else here today that the Holy Spirit has spoke to you and you'd like to be water baptized today please see one the deacons or one of the ministering Brethren and and we'll be able to be there for you and amen I I don't know it's it's a it's a very um it's a very powerful day for us to be doing these things and you know brother Riley standing back there if you ever want to measure my being here just look at Riley he was born in I think it's July right he's he his birthday is July right March his birthday is March and I come here in October of the same year here and so when I look at him I can see the years that I've been here in the growth and amen he he learned to walk in my living room behind a little a little push toy and his his mom there sister Liz was there and and and learned to walking sorry [Music] I believe she'll be watching today as well I believe when we gather up around that pond there'll be more than just a group of people I'm leaving Unseen World sister Megan I spoke of you in faith I stood there and Liz in the hospital said to me she said I need to see just for a minute just the two of us K this's and I said yeah she said but Wayne I I'm ready to go it's Josh and rileigh that I'm fighting so hard for and under inspiration I said Liz God's got somebody in mind already and don't you worry don't you worry God's going to send somebody to take care of Riley and Josh we're so thankful that he sent you than may God bless you for your sacrifice and your blessing and I thank God's mercy upon you and your family and I know Brother David what it is to give a daughter and not be right there at your home and I and I I say God bless you and thank you I believe there's an eternal purpose in in her being here not just somewhere to live but God's doing something great I I'm I'm so honored this morning to be a part of what he's doing in his will and brother Barry very clearly I appreciate the solid direction we don't have to be worried we're following the word we're not worried this morning we're following the word and while we're following it wonderful things are going to take place and
