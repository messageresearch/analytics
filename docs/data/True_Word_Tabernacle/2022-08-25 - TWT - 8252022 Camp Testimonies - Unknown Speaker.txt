you have to notify your face amen because god has been good to us my i feel like this church with a camp meeting and people getting behind it i believe it's like well i know a lot of you haven't been to israel but the sea of galilee is up here the dead sea is down here the sea of la gallery's got life that's what i say this church they're not the dead sea they're the same galilee hallelujah [Applause] praise god praise god brother jesse's hate you i've seen you in years man your dad was telling me about you the other night god bless you amen i don't know if you got your bibles i'm not going to take much time uh we want to hear what god has done for each individual so in psalms 42 a couple of verses there also i want to as a church thank the mcnulty family for all the laborers and the people that helped them and uh it was wonderful going there sunday evening having fellowship having something to eat even the bus from louisiana stopped there amen and wow the parking lot was full but we enjoyed ourselves and incidentally brother aaron oglesby i know we're going to have testimonies tonight i don't i happened to tune in a little last night to uh their meeting and brother oglesby was giving his testimony felt like god touched him right in this prayer he's had a medical problem for two three years i think and uh in the prayer line he was helping with the prayer line but he was he looked over towards the front of it where brother wayne and brother aaron were our brother andrew and he was waiting for the next one to come and brother andrew made a direct look at him said i think he said it's over by the aaron it's over so he's accepting that amen i don't know what i don't even know the name of the disease that they told them he had but i say to god be the glory let's read as the heart panted after the water brooks so panic my soul after thee o god my soul thirsted for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god i want to emphasize that's why we serve a living god amen in ii corinthians chapter 3 verse 6. if you want to go there just one verse there chapter verse 6 who also had made us able ministers of the new testament not the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life now the spirit takes the letter and manifests it exactly what happened this weekend god took the letter and made it alive by the spirit god bless you as you've seen it i just want to take a few moments here uh i have this quote and i know brother andrew referred to it and i thought i'd have isaac pull it up so you can see it it's from a blessing prophet if you can just pull that up we'll take a few minutes to see these young women come in weeping life before them they're at the crossroads they are a victim of circumstances what do you relays do you realize old men when we were boys our boys have got 10 times the temptation we had sister do you realize that your daughter has 10 times the temptation you had when you was a girl what will her daughter have look at the things the pictures the devil is painting now when do you think of all these years that have passed since this quote was spoken can you imagine what we're facing today you know and so i say that we need a living god to combat the enemy brother madam said we need that flying eagle anointing to break the bonds of the enemy and so we are looking to god to do this for us and he has done it amen i was thinking on brother branham i think it's i can't remember what message i think it's from that time and i know we're very familiar with it brother ben was saying my ministry is a different minister from a pastor or teacher but my ministry is to declare him that he's here now i got to thinking about that and you know that became more than words when the prophet was coming in other words it wasn't just talking about we're going to have a deeper teaching but we're going to see a supernatural god come on the scene and it's express himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and i say that's what we visualized this weekend we saw the power of god come and deliver people filled people with the holy ghost took away fear and anxiety depression i know this uh this family doesn't come here but i was at the mcnulty's i'm not going to say who they are but i was talking to the father and he was telling me about his daughter now i i know he went by i don't know if she actually had a chance to talk to her but he saw the continents on her sunday after going through the prayer line she has battled depression for years even as a young lady now she's married has children but he said sunday her whole congress was different her whole conference was different i say to god be the glory and i was wondering i was wondering when uh you know i don't know if brother andrew did it too but even on sunday brother uh timothy was only two or three or four times just mentioned depression depression depression i was wondering whoa where i wonder where he's going you know so there must have been that but this happened on saturday night that she got her deliverance don't tell me we got a you know we just got a plain message christ is on the scene just one more quote before we i'm going to turn over to nathan but uh he can also pull this one up in crisis a mystery uh i don't need to read every paragraph necessarily i should have highlighted he said now think by the living presence of the living christ by the living word living christ's living presence living word by his own personal vindication proves his church slip down to 482. remember think of it that people born of a spirit in a day like this in this great denominational age that we live and the living god makes takes its living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word the german that's in the seed and the word is the seed that the sower went through the sower and if the life is christ in the word personally in you vindicating something you cannot do proving that it's not you but it's him you've got it a love slave to him to be the bride 4 484 his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing himself through a vindication of the great revelation of god look only in an individual never in a group never in a group his identification is with an individual amen 486 it's another group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrender to god that he don't care about anything else and the holy spirit has given us life and pulsating through him that's a personal indication of the word excel amen one more quote from the presence of on of god unrecognized if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how do you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promised word of moses age or any other ages but it's a promised word for this age i'd say to god be the glory we got a promise word we got a vindicated word and it's not just a vindicated prophet it's a vindicated word to individuals and they're sitting here tonight with testimonies that god is real and so we we want to give time for the personal testimonies here and then nathan will bring some that i believe have been turned in on the internet god bless you nathan as you come amen can you say praise the lord amen everybody just get real comfortable let's keep the atmosphere real comfortable let's just take a moment a few moments and appreciate what the lord has done because we have certainly seen some tremendous things take place in our midst this weekend it's just been amazing to behold um if you want to read all the testimonies that have been turned in they're kind of getting collected on on the website we have there for the youth that's twt youth.com and you should really go read them because it's powerful it's powerful what uh what the lord is doing and it's just a you know it's really just a portion you know that that we've been able to capture there for a keepsake and i just want to say how grateful i am for the support of the church for for our youth camp it's really just been overwhelming it causes us to have confidence you know that that what we're doing is not not just a man's thinking or a personal agenda but god has provided every step exactly what was needed and uh you know it was amazing last year even you know the lord really provided but it was in such a way of like somebody would come to me and say well i'd like to help i'd like to help and it's you know well okay why don't you do this and well maybe you could try helping me over here and and this year you know we just we had the same as far as the core staff and and i'm telling you that if i could have my pick of of people anywhere in this country we would not change a member of the team we would not we would not do anything different god has just provided just the right person it's been amazing you know we appreciate a pastor that supports us having a youth camp amen amen that would just support that vision and give a you know give a give opportunity and actually we kind of have a problem which is that we have you know behind every member of the team there's a hundred people lined up that would like to help and we have more people that want to be a part of it than we even have jobs to give you know and and uh and you know uh and so it's just a blessing you know and to see that it's it's it's i believe bringing bringing a zeal into the church for our young people which just touches my heart because you know when you see god just raining down his blessings like that we want to be a part of it if i could pick a piece of trash up off the ground or hold the door for somebody or some way be a part i would want to share in what god is doing and that's just been the heart of the church and it's a tremendous tremendous thing you know and you know we even even on on wednesday there there was things we could have set up and i we just i said let's let's leave it for tomorrow because somebody will want to be a part and so we'll save a job for somebody and i really appreciate the mcnulty family for opening their home and and for including so many people in in uh you know it created so much more opportunity for our us to show our love as a church and hospitality and not just our church but but you know the other local churches was something that could really bring them together and that's part of the vision you know that's what we're about we're building bridges and lighting fires amen amen so we just appreciate you for your hospitality and just all the churches you know the ministries that have got behind it and given their support you know churches like brother tim pruitt where the church got together rented a bus paid for their young people to come sent sent over 50 children to be a part of our youth camp that's you know we don't take that for granted personally that's a great responsibility when you have established pastors that want to get behind something we want to be respectful of that amen we want to we want it to uh to be a reward for them so and and lastly before we go to personal testimonies i i want to i want to before the whole church i want to appreciate our youth group for the testimony that they're holding in front of the world i think we should thank the lord for these precious young people amen it's it's more than just you know young people believe in this message or living a lifestyle the comments that we get about our youth they're they're living a testimony of excellence and it's speaking to the world you know it'd be one thing if we were through a youth camp and got together and organized something for youth around the country to come and be a part of something but then to show up and find out that there's no testimony here at true word tabernacle then it would hurt their confidence in in what the lord's doing here but it's not the case god has given us uh wonderful just tremendous young people and you know in spite of the quote brother red which is so true that our young people are dealing with problems they're dealing with struggles that that some of us even from my generation can't quite relate to just the pressures that are on our young people and and it really has advanced it really has become worse in this world and yet the trend of god's people has gone up i want to testify to that what our young people have the character the hunger for the word the knowledge of the word the faith amen we didn't have it when i was that age i want to i want to say that for the glory of god it's the truth amen and so we just have precious young people that are credit to parents credit to the ministry here and they make us very very proud very very proud and i heard of at least three of ours that got the holy ghost this weekend amen amen at least three of us and so i'm gonna share one testimony that was put on the website and brother aaron could you get your poem ready if you would read that for the church tonight i'm coming back there to front row errands in the back tonight but we're going to have him give a testimony you know i shared this at the camp too in one of the services it was a powerful thing that god did i guess it was friday night brother timothy was ministering and he had he had finished his sermon and he had prayed for some people and virtue had really gone out so brother ronnie was leading him out of the church and he'd actually exited the church out the wing out into the study and there was a young lady sitting in the audience who had been struggling really hard and our our young sisters have a real struggle you know with their appearance when the standard of this world is not even a natural thing it's uh everything's artificial you know and it puts a great pressure on them and this poor young sister was struggling under those complexes of her appearance so bad she actually had not left her dorm that day she spent the whole day at youth camp just sitting in a dorm by herself because she just didn't want anybody to see her so that's that's how afflicted she was with this and she she's sitting there in service and uh she's wanting to go for prayer you know but just kind of working up the courage and then the the prayer kind of stopped there friday night and and brother timothy exited the church and she just felt heartbroken like lord i miss my opportunity then something rose up inside her she said lord you see my heart she said have brother timothy come back in here and say something to me and back there in the office brother timothy was on his way out brother ronnie was taking me said i got to go back brother ronnie said no you're done you're you've got to go you got to go to sleep and uh brother timothy said he would have fought brother ronnie if he'd have tried to stop him he said no there's more there's another chain to break he came storming it yeah how many were there that night he came came came out of that office with a purpose step to the platform he said you sisters i got one more chain to break you sisters are sitting there thinking you're ugly said you're beautifully and wonderfully made hallelujah and it wasn't just for that one sister but there were many sisters got a deliverance amen because of one prayer that's the god we serve amen he's a god that speaks he's not a silent god but but you know and that's the faith we ought to bring to a service amen when an anointed man of god is bringing the word amen you pull on that gift god will do something for you amen even in a testimony service like tonight god could do something for you there was a sister thought missed her opportunity at camp and she got the holy ghost on the bus ride on the way home amen don't put any limits on the lord glory be to god amen brother aaron share that poem and your testimony about what happened friday night i'm going to ask everybody to to tell camp testimonies tonight and to tell brief testimonies as well as you can i know some of you got lengthy ones you got them written down that's good you can read them off and stay organized but just want to say that up front uh my testimony briefly is i'm one of three who got the holy ghost for one a theme i heard or a phrase i kept hearing repeated over camp was satan could come at you with everything he has but it's not enough you no matter how long you've been bound etc etc it's not enough and today while i was at work i was reading the testimonies that were being posted i got inspiration to write a poem which i will now read you fight with the same old trap breaking free then falling again and you forget what hope is and lose your faith it'll end but even though all your chains feel like unbreakable cuffs i have been through and can say satan will never have enough no matter how long you've fought or how weary you've become no matter how far you've gone or if you just can't overcome and no matter how heavy it doesn't matter how tough all your bars and chains might be because they'll never be enough all of hell wants to stop this they can't let you remember if you find the faith you had every devil must surrender and even though it'll be hard even though the road is rough we can face those heavy chains and we can say it's not enough god bless you all i'll make mine short go ahead going into camp my attitude was this means war thursday night service was a wonderful start to camp the service really spoke to me and i believe it was a stepping stone to friday night friday night was my night the lord came and touched me in such a special way i went up to the altar and started pouring my heart out i was desperate with everything that's happened this past year i was starting to battle with fear and anxiety the devil was also bringing up my past and all the mistakes i made and everything i had done things i'm not proud of brother nathan and brother wayne came over at one point and started praying with me everything i wanted was praying and was thinking about brother nathan prayed it when they left such a sweet warm and intense presence came and it just wrapped all around me i was finally able to let go of my past fear anxiety my past mistakes past hurts and i was able to let go of grudges and truly forgive people i just felt it all knowed away from me then when brother timothy came out and said what he said about satan satan telling us that we're not beautiful and we're not worthy and and he said the chain is at your feet i felt the last chain and complex fall to the ground it literally felt like it fell from around my neck i felt like that boy and brother branham's sermon with the chain around his neck that was finally set free it just melted away that's something i've always struggled with a lot i didn't realize how strong of a chain it was i was up at the altar just worshiping and basking in the lord's sweet presence i didn't want to leave it and brother colby starts singing i won't go back when we get to the verses about my shame fear trains and past being gone it hit me and something just dropped in my heart and i realized that they really were they were broken and crumbled at my feet saturday night i went through the prayer line and as i was and as i was walking through i heard brother andrew say you've come so far i realized what i used to be and i'm not the same person anymore i have come so far by god's grace i got even more freedom and liberty with my praise and worship the devil has slowly been trying to quiet me down like i used to be last year at camp i was delivered of a formalism spirit well let's just say he won't quiet me down then sunday's service came and it was absolutely amazing when we started singing you don't know like i know i got such a joy freedom and liberty it's like it was just bubbling over on the inside and i had to do something so i got a tissue and started waving my white flag to victory when brother timothy started to sing he filled me with the holy ghost that's what he's done for me i was just worshiping away such a sweet presence came and it went from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet something just came and anchored never to be moved or doubted again in my heart i knew right then that i had it i got my joy peace love so much freedom and liberty back the devil cannot have my freedom sound mind praise and worship it's mine i left camp totally different changed forever i am not the same i know who i am i'm walking in my eternal purpose oh devil how a liar you are [Applause] okay i'll try and condense mine a little bit too um so i'll start with a little bit of a back story i got the holy ghost in february of this year but um this year has been rough on a lot of us and it was really easy to feel discouraged with everything happening so fast and within the last couple months the devil had really began to whisper lies telling me that i didn't have the holy ghost and um well i yeah he was he was wrong but i kept i kept telling myself that these were lies but he kept doing a good job of convincing me that um it was true but um i was painting a bible before camp a couple of my friends and i decided to paint bibles and i prayed a long time about what to write on the front because i wanted whatever it was to have an impact on my testimony from camp and um when i was praying and the verse from from john from john 19. um that says he said it is finished came to my mind and so that's why i decided to paint on the front and um friday night when brother timothy was preaching i prayed that he would say something along the lines of um it is finished and he walked over to the side of the platform that i was sitting on and he looked right at me and pointed right at me and he said what do you have to worry about he said it is finished and so that i that was pretty i got pretty happy um and um i also went to camp this year really desiring a very personal experience when i went through the prayer line i wanted one of the ministers to say something directly to me because i never had that happen before and so i turned the corner and i was headed straight for the uh ministers and um the devil was had uh said you know what if this isn't you know like what if this life isn't for you what if it's all been fake what if you know you're not gonna make it and so i prayed that um one of the ministers would let me know that this is this is it this is this is for me and um i got up there and i had my eyes closed and my hands raised and brother andrew grabbed my left wrist and leaned down next to my um ear and he said he basically was said what i was asking he said is it for you and i all i could do is shake my head because i was already crying and um he said yes it is and then brother wayne grabbed my right wrist and um he they were all praying for me but i remember what he said he said house of hell give way for this daughter of god for she has been made free and then i spent the rest of the night rejoicing and um and uh sunday morning rejoicing [Applause] amen who's next who's next mama why don't you give yours i had been dealing with plantar fasciitis for a couple years where i don't know if someone doesn't know your feet hurt really bad the muscles are really tight and when it's really bad it's hard to walk and before camp it got really bad where my feet were feeling like pins and needles every time i walked and um sorry saturday night during the prayer line i felt pressed to go up um and pray for that need and i really really wanted that really bad because it was been a constant struggle for a long time that really helped me get me from doing a lot of things that uh i should be able to do in my daily life so um i was just really staying in the prayer line and really just thinking on all of the miracles that i knew in my life personally and brother branham's time just trying to really raise my faith because i really wanted to take this home and as uh it got to be my turn brother andrew grabbed my hand and said you really want this don't you and i said yes i think i said yes i was trying to and uh he said uh why do you doubt and when he said that i felt like a child i don't know why i was doubting you know i didn't even realize that i was trying to raise my faith the whole time but he said i saw you way back in the prayer line and it's yours something to that effect and so i just started praising and worshiping the lord and i was just at the altar thanking him for my healing and started moving my feet around and you know all that pain that had been constantly with me you know it wasn't there anymore it's completely gone amen i just wanted to add and know it's small and almost insignificant but i had also hit my foot on a picnic table walking around and the top of my foot was had a really big bruise on it so after the prayer line i was talking to andrew and i said man i really hit my foot on this picnic table and i went to show them that bruise and it was completely gone so i didn't ask for it amen who's next i want to have some more i'll tell you we saw some you know this year uh standing right there at the front line with brother andrew and brother brother wayne and the other brothers and had a front row seat to some really supernatural events and i just think it's marvelous you know that uh just because god took his profit off the scene doesn't mean there's not gifts in the church doesn't mean he's not still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart still a deliverer still a healer still a comforter powerful things i think one one time brother andrew uh well a few times he made mention to different people of the some to the effect of he said he said i see the angel of the lord whirling around right over this spot see his light i've seen it and so my that's powerful you know i think uh you know in things that happen in the ministry brother timothy brother wayne these brothers you know that's the kind of god we serve that's what we believe in we believe in a bride ministry we believe he's riding this trail again amen now some people say well you know young people they lean too much on certain persons and certain gifts and things they lean to as if those ministers aren't aware of that and dealing with that but the gift is of god and we're expecting those things to be manifested in the church of the living god amen just tremendous what god's done anyone else that's one of your sisters brother levi yeah you know when you get ready to go up to a prayer line the devil is always doing everything that he can to try to try to get you to you know say it's not for your you know saturday night i knew what i needed and uh i said i thought well you know this is just for the young people and i'm not really young i i'm halfway old and i thought well so i just like that i looked up and i seen sister lucille go through the prayer line i thought well if she can go through i can go through i uh i was desiring a refilling of the holy ghost and i knew i had gotten in just a kind of a lukewarm lady osea spirit crept on me and i was i was thinking if they stopped me at the prayer line that's i i have a specific need that's what i'll ask for i got up to the prayer line and brother wayne prayed almost exactly i never spoke to any of the ministers brother wayne i i'm not i didn't hear brother andrew but brother wayne prayed almost exactly what i had in my heart so it's just proving to me god still knows your heart amen amen i just want to say as the camp director it's not just for the young people i am young at heart don't don't forget that okay um this testimony is for um something that happened to molly she's not here but you know what i'm her mama i raised her i have prayed for her i've been watching god move and work and after she had sage she went into depression and anxiety and um we're not against medication by no means we feel like we're balanced we'll do natural medical whatever god leads but she had to go on some medication and um she had been on it now for four years and about four weeks ago she ran out and could not get into the doctor and they would not give her a refill for this medication and if i understand that type of medication you're not supposed to go off of a cold turkey because you can have some pretty serious side effects from it but they couldn't get her in they wouldn't even make an appointment to get her in to even you know get her a refill for four weeks and so camp came and let's see wednesday and thursday she was having some really good anxiety attacks and some different things that was pretty concerning you know for me as a mom and for her and so um we encouraged her to go to camp and she came friday night right babe friday night and um they were really hitting like you said brother ray the anxiety and depression and um luke wasn't there so i just took the babies and was did grandma duty in the nursery so molly could sit there and soak this in under uninterrupted and just praying for her you know lord you just move you move and um so friday night ends we go home and then saturday was that saturday night prayer line okay saturday night was friday night but saturday night all that was happening so then she comes back sunday morning and again i took the children to the nursery because he was hitting on it again and she came out and she said mom it's okay i'll take the kids back in now and so we went back in and it was towards the end of the service and brother tim was hitting again on anxiety and depression it was more towards the end of the service and so when he called out that spirit again you mamas know you hear your child you know your child's cry and i heard this scream out and i looked over and there was molly pitched forward and she had you know mila in her hand i was like oh i gotta go get that baby and she was pitched forward and shot her your hand up and just screaming out and screaming out and um just over and over you know crying out and i didn't get a chance to to talk with her that evening and so i was still concerned with her symptoms and so me as mom trying to doctor i'm looking for natural things to try to calm her you know situation down so she didn't go back on the medication she didn't make it to the doctor but she didn't go back on the medication she said i'm going to try to to get through this and so um i talked to her on monday morning and i said hey molly i said i said you know i had was looking up and found this natural means for the anxiety in case you you would need something she said mom she said that thing's gone she said when brother tim hit on depression through the last part of the service i stood up and raised my hand up and i literally felt that thing leave and lift off my body she said i don't need she said even when you said he was talking about that anxiety giving i don't need that stuff mama it's gone so that i'm delivered so praise the lord ella doesn't want to do this so i guess i will um on thursday night she went up for prayer she wanted the holy ghost and she came back to her seat and she was discouraged and sad and i asked her if she's okay she said yes and then she started she got down on her knees and started praying and i asked her what's wrong and she said mom i went for the holy ghost and i didn't get it she's like she said why does everybody else get it so easy what am i doing wrong and so she was she told me she wasn't going to be able to be happy the rest of camp if she didn't get the holy ghost and she just was a sad little puppy and followed me around for all day all day friday and all day saturday and it was just it was breaking my heart i about couldn't take it and saturday night they'd asked me to help with the prayer line and my thought was who's gonna encourage her to go in the prayer line when i'm not there but anyways i went to the front and was helping them and brother andrew right up close to the beginning when the prayer line was starting he looked at me and he said he's coming your way tonight i didn't know what that meant but i was happy i was i couldn't wait to see what it was and i know i had no idea i wasn't thinking about a letter that it would be her or anything like that and about 45 minutes later ella came up the line and i had just helped take somebody out and i came back to the beginning right when she walked up and he looked at me said okay here it is now go with her and watch it happen and so i i jumped through the whole line i'm also look like a crazy person i was over there trying to pray with her rejoicing because i knew she was gonna get it and at one point she started to get up she turned around to get up i said nope you're not ready yet you gotta stay there we're gonna stay here all night if that's what it takes because you don't have it yet i don't know how i knew but i did and we prayed for a while longer and i don't i don't know what made me say it i don't know i don't feel like it was really me it just came out i looked at her and said you got it and she took her she took her hands and grabbed my face and she said i got it mom i got it and she was just crying she's like i'm so happy amen i'll tell you we didn't you know it's just too bad the whole church couldn't be right there to see but i'll tell you one thing we got uncle ben's reaction on video praise the lord amen i want to share another testimony similar to that it was one of the youth one of the young men from louisiana joseph adams i believe and the whole thing is on the their stream from wednesday night but i thought it was amazing he said you know i've been to different youth camps and he named him off you know where he said i would just go seek in the holy ghost and i'd just come home disappointed just come home disappointed you know i'd get an experience or something would happen i'd dance or shout or something he said but i just never came home with the with the real baptism of the holy ghost and he correctly identified the the root he said i never i couldn't completely surrender he said i was always there was things i was holding on to couldn't come to a full surrender so long story short he received the baptism of the holy ghost at our camp amen so we just just glad to be a part of that story so he was rejoicing you know and he did something i kind of like on sunday morning uh you know during the singing worship there he he must took a mark or a pen or something he said he wrote the devil's name on the bottom of his shoe and he knows senator sooner finished doing that and brother andrew was singing that song you don't know like i know joy when i think about we kind of like that song around here and he said i get brother andrew started to sing i get joy when i think about satan under my feet so the young man he said he took that as a confirmation started to well long story short by the end of the day there was nothing left on the bottom of the shoe not a trace of that devil amen hallelujah anyone else especially our young people i'd like to hear some more testimonies amen we'll get to let's try to get a young person here if we can how about about a how about a buy a raised hand one of our young people want to say i had a touch from the lord i had a deliverance had a healing amen had a comfort amen we give hannah did you want to share yours tonight i'll come over to you amen sister marge um okay well um i got in the prayer line because my heart's desire was that i wanted to see the have the devil be better at getting him keeping him under my feet because i tend to be emotional and anyway when i was going to go out for prayer the thought came to me that when just when he lays his hands on you but in my mind i was looking forward to like just going through the prayer line and really being prayed for by everyone because i was like how powerful you know and um but when i got in the line and i and i came up to the front i was i mean i i i guess brother um andrew ass i didn't know if he was going to ask me what but anyway my thought was just to i i'm well my heart also was even though i don't care about earthly things but about a year ago i or maybe it was longer i don't know i got rid of all my almost all my jewelry like my original wedding band sales matching band i mean it accidentally got trashed and i didn't know about it till months later and and i thought well well it's cannon fodder anyway so it's okay but it started like but it's been in my heart to say lord where's the miracles you know believers miracles follow believers and i'm a believer so i just thought that's a challenge so when i got up into the prayer line i mentioned i said i need a miracle and because i just committed to the lord i don't really care about that stuff but i thought is that fear keeping me from asking i thought god's i was cattle in a thousand hills i mean it's what is it for god because even well anyway as soon as i don't know who laid hands on me but i was not planning on getting excited or something but also i know as i went through that line before i knew it and all i know is god knows my needs my needs for my children are you know god's mindful of all that and i committed to him and i just i will worship the lord i don't care that what if he never does another thing for me i believe god and i know he's a miracle working god and i trust him and i'm i'm believing so god can do whatever he likes [Applause] i mean i like something sister marge said there about you know you have certain expectations about how god's going to move on it what's going to happen that sister we talked about earlier i loved the way she brought her testimony she said she was very organized person really a planner and she said she had it all in her mind how it would happen she'd go through the prayer line or brother brother andrew would have something specifically said to her she said well none of that happened and the last thing she expected was get the holy ghost on the bus on the way home from camp but one way or the other god will keep his word amen so i actually don't like talking in front of people and i had determined i wasn't volunteering my testimony unless i was specifically asked to so i guess god wants it shared um but since the explosion in june the devil is just heaped fear and anxiety on me but i thought i was doing a decent job managing it and handling it and i just thought that i was destined for that and maybe a couple weeks ago i had determined that okay i'll go through the prayer line saturday night if they have one and i know i'll get delivered then i don't know why i thought i had to wait but that's what i told myself so we go to camp and friday night brother timothy is just hammering fear and anxiety i mean hammering it i don't know that i've ever set through a service where that's like every other sentence and i'm just sitting there and i'm like yeah i know i'm gonna get it you know tomorrow and then he literally stops and he's like today is your day why are you waiting and i'm like and i raised my hands and it was like i literally felt it break free and so i was worshiping the rest of the service and then i really felt impressed to just go tell him that i really wanted him to know what had happened and there was time for prayer afterwards he was standing there and praying and i don't like getting up in front of people so i was fighting with myself to get up there and so finally i talked myself into getting in line and then they break brother andrew's with a group of people and brother timothy is with a group of people like well hopefully i get with him so i'm waiting my turn i actually tapped brother ronnie at one point and i was like i would really like to tell brother timothy a testimony if that's okay and about the time i finished saying that brother timothy finished praying with the person in front of me and it just it worked out like i shouldn't have feared you know that god wouldn't have allowed it so i was telling him the testimony um but another part of that is i've struggled with a lot of health symptoms for a really long time and i believe i received my healing years ago actually and i believe that a lot of my symptoms have just been me walking into victory but i tend to dwell on those symptoms a lot i talk about him and after he talked about today's your day he goes into you know god calls us to be worshippers but we are called to worship him not our symptoms so why are you always talking about your symptoms i'm just like okay lord i get it like i'll stop so i was telling brother timothy you know about the the chains breaking of fear and anxiety and then i mentioned you know that about um oh i felt like he was talking straight to me like to stop talking about my symptoms and to talk that god is my healer and i said so i just wanted to come up and tell you thank you and i wanted to thank god for my healing and he's like well i want you to right now praise him and thank him and so i just i raised my hands and was thanking him for my healing and for my victory and i went back to my seat and i spent all of saturday and sunday just rejoicing and you know the devil he he likes to fight yet it's not been an easy week and fear and anxiety been trying to creep back up but i just want saints and to know that he can't have my victory [Applause] amen anyone else got a testimony thanks um okay so last year um for a couple years anyways uh we've been trying to have a baby and um at camp last year me and seth really felt like it was our time to go for a prayer on saturday night so we both went up and um we went hand in hand as we were going in i was on ronnie's side and seth was on brother wayne's side and as we were going in i heard ronnie say he said that your baby is on the way speak their name and um later this year around june um we found out that we were having that baby amen anyone else uh all right real quick i just want to i just feel god's putting this on my heart right now and it was it was at camp on uh saturday my my mother has been praying for um healing of her hip she says the bone on bone and her hip that's why you see her in the wheelchair when when you see her usually because it's just the pain is just outrageous with that and she's been believing for a lot of years for this and and i've been believing with her too and uh and i know she's been prayed over before i know she's claimed it before i just feel like god wants me to share this right now and and i believe that she is healed right now in the name of jesus so i just want to thank god for um for providing that and providing the inspiration in this moment so praise the lord amen it's not too late as the musicians maybe would come um you know you know it we're just scratching the surface of what the lord has done for us who we pointing out yeah kenzie i'm not normally the type to talk in front of people either so bear with me my cheeks are fine um so [Music] normally before a prayer line you're praying lord if it's your will for me to go through make a way and i was sitting there the entire service there was no way so of course i'm telling myself well it's the end of service for me i might as well just sit here and worship like i normally do it's my end it's nothing's for me tonight maybe in the morning and of course brother ben sings let it rain and i stand up and it brings me back to the ground and he told me he said see this wasn't the end for you you don't even have to go into that prayer line i can give it to you right here it was an experience that i've never had before a hundred times greater than i've ever had just in my regular church services and ellie i wasn't planning on saying this but she's sitting right next to me and you know i'm recovering still and i'm not trying to bring myself back out to it so that i can thank her for praying with me and we sit back down and i'm hugging her and our heads are touching and it was not my words and i said i'm praying for you i've been in your place the lord has brought us literally from pennsylvania in just a couple months to here he has dropped the price of a house just by a dollar to let us know that we're supposed to be coming here and i said your time's coming and i said lord bring them home they make this congregation complete and i just it wasn't me saying that i knew it right then and there i'm not normally the type to pray out loud so i knew it then um but i just wanted to share that i didn't have to go into the prayer line he gave it to me right then in my seat i mean we appreciate some young people that have a real experience with god amen and people people take notice i think ben nailed it on sunday morning so i made a little statement about the musicians that we had he said you know it's a life behind the gift yeah that's what makes it work that's what makes it effective that's why you know our young sisters get up here and sing the church gets behind it people worship god why because they see a real life they see a real light so we're thankful for what the lord's done that's what we're that's what keeps us going that's what it's all about amen you know you you know you you know you're doing something for the lord because you'll hit resistance time to time you know there'll be criticisms there'll be things there'll be obstacles but you know not many there's more with us than there are against us yes sir and more and more by the day because people are hungry for a real experience with god amen but you know i made a little comment one situation and brother isaac i said yeah well we're making waves he said well if you're making waves it matters who's in the boat with you amen the waves don't matter what matters is who's in the boat but we've seen god deliver do some real works of deliverance real works of victory amen from the dark dark things that young people face today suicide lost its power amen a young man just shared on the website today young man you know he's had a lot of struggles in his life by the name of michael and put in his testimony said he said this year the lord delivered me from suicide he said i got the holy ghost and fire on the inside amen hallelujah amen last year you know there was a real powerful testimony about that a young lady i must been in the prayer line or something came and spoke to brother andrew she said said brother andrew if i don't get something from god right here i'm going to go home and kill myself amen and the lord did something for her there but you know what we checked in this year she's still standing it wasn't a temporary thing it was a lasting experience lasting victory a real overcoming we believe in that amen you know what the what the devil will do you know there is nothing satan can do to change what you experienced in these meetings nothing no power of hell can can change the fact that god heaven came down god came down and he did something personally for you but what he'll do is he'll try to change your confession about it that's where he'll come in that's why brother branham said he said and brother timothy referenced this and i thought it was i thought it was the perfect message on sunday morning for young people to take home from a camp meeting the key to keeping a victory brother braham said it's a strange thing with people they say well i'm weak my faith is not much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you must never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time amen say it after me i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all of my heart divine healing i believe with all my heart amen let your testimony always and your thoughts never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it but when it starts don't entertain it amen change your confession to match your experience and it'll be a lasting victory in your life i believe you believe that [Music] for you are great you do miracles so great there is no one else like you maybe we could stand and give him a little worship oh there is no one else like you for you are great you do miracles so great thank you lord there is no one else like oh how we love you there is no one amen he deserves our worship tonight you deserve you deserve the glory and the honor lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy name oh you deserve the glow is he worthy tonight all the honor oh lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy oh you are great you do miracles hallelujah oh there is no one else like you [Music] there is no one else like you oh there is no one more time with all your heart you are great oh you are great you do miracles [Music] else like i know i noticed there uh saturday brother andrew said at the beginning of service he said i see the pillar of fire whirling through the building how many remember saying that looks like nobody remembers that i see the pillar of fire we shouldn't be uh you know we shouldn't be alarmed at that the pillar of fire is with us you know brother batman said in the third exodus that pillar of fire is here to lead us on to the millennium so we know that whether we feel it or see it it's here by the word that pillar of fire and not only that but it did what it does i don't know that's not very good english is it it did i don't even know if i could repeat that one amen i'll tell you what it done did it that's all i can say [Music] [Applause] you know what brings something what really brings a meaning whether it's a camp or here atmosphere and we can create an atmosphere coming into this church that we can have tremendous meetings right here but it's the atmosphere and you know uh it means more to me now than ever been when brother branham was saying i i i know i told it here but i heard a brother saying you know brother brown said in the deity message you can create a new world and go live on it but i heard a minister say you know you're creating an atmosphere to live in we don't need another world to go to it's an atmosphere right here and that's the kind of creation you can bring in your home when everything is all tore up and everything else and let the holy spirit come in like a dove and settle the whole situation and god good let's bow our hearts lord jesus what a wonderful time together to hear what you have done in the lives of people god when you we are witnesses of people receiving the holy ghost [Music] through the preaching of the word and through prayer god what a lovely god you are and then to see people delivered of all of these things that hinder life it's not meant for anybody to be sad it's not any it's not meant to be anybody under fear or depression or anxiety [Music] but we're meant to be at freedom as christians to believe and to love you with all of our being and lord there's always going to be trials and tests even disappointments but god you're way beyond that you're so kind to us and you're so lovely we appreciate you so much and we appreciate god's people we love them as we love you in jesus name be with the saints as they travel watch over them and keep them safe is our prayer and we give you thanks in jesus name one other testimony [Music] i was a lot of the time the prayer line i just don't always have the strength to stand and give out and give out like that but i was sometimes i was sitting down but i was on the end of the prayer line so once in a while i'd go and pray with somebody but sister sarah townsend came through she said brother ray i got heal of diabetes tonight and brother wayne said that she took the blood test it was down 119 119. god bless you you're dismissed we love you we care a lot for you amen you know i'll tell you this is just a taste of heaven just a taste of heaven amen why don't we worship a couple of songs as you go but you're free to go remember sunday by the way in the pre-preaching amen remember the brothers that are out on the field amen going on different ways better on you'll be up in
