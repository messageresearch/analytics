and amen amen what a blessing Amen to come to the house of God on a Thursday night in such a powerful presence amen how many can feel and sense the presence of the Living God Amen we thank God Amen that there's such a place amen that you can just come to steal a way in his presence and his mercy and we want to thank you for your attendance here tonight and I I I know there's many that can't come and I just want to say God bless them and we pray that maybe tonight they would be able to uh view on the line we pray the Holy Spirit to be there ministering in those places wherever his word is heard amen and amen tonight if you would while you're standing let's go into the scripture here for a moment I have some things up on our heart the book of Ephesians the 6th chapter I want to read the 12th verse here Ephesians chapter 6 I want to read the 12th verse for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places we ask the Lord to bless his word you may be seated tonight I want to speak to you for the next little bit here you know we've been on in Ephesians and Sy for a while uh but I want to speak to you here tonight from this section of scripture and if I would take a context tonight a title for this I'd like to talk to you about breaking the hold of the devil breaking the hold of the devil now I think it's important that we have viewed uh from the scripture we have saw amen that this is a great and a spiritual battle and I think we each one could testify to the reality of that tonight that it's a great and it's a spiritual battle now the prophet teaches us that in this scripture it says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and rulers of Darkness of this world and spiritual and high places and this is why that brother brandham teaches the Ascension is such a powerful part of the scripture he's probably the most under preached part of scripture is the Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ because he teaches us that Earth actually belongs to the devil from this scripture brother Bram says Earth belonged to the devil and through the fall the Earth was given to the devil and every Kingdom of the world is governed by the devil we have to we hate to think that but it's the Bible that's the reason we have wars and shootings and fighting and trouble is because the kingdoms of this world is the kingdoms of the devil and the Bible said so in the great Millennium to come the Bible said Rejoice all ye heavens and all the holy prophets of the Earth for the kingdoms of this Earth have become the kingdoms of our Lord and He Shall Rule and Reign forever now they will become we'll have no more war then when he comes no more sickness no more troubles notice this there's so little spoken of the Ascension but it's one of the greatest days when he ascended how many remember us teaching on the Ascension of Christ amen it's the day of the Garden of Eden that sin was committed All The Heavens was shut off from Mankind and Satan then became the prince of the power of the air and remember it says why thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer thou no man could see into Glory no man could understand because the power is just above it Heaven means atmosphere and all these Powers were shut off because of sin so the prophet teaches us that's how Satan come into the power of the heavenlies that's how he took control of the atmospheres was through the fall of Satan through the fall of sin but our lord Jesus of course after death burial and Resurrection took an Ascension and the prophet says and he broke through every Veil Amen to conquer every Power that he might be able to open a way for the children of God to get into a Heavenly atmosphere and of course Ephesians starts begins with amen and we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now in putting on the whole armor brother bandam teaches us this that we're not wrestling then against Natural or scientific things we're wrestling against spiritual Powers right so tonight you're wrestling against spiritual powers and it's amazing because brother B takes it to the Natural wrestler and he says you know wrestlers they make a practice on breaking tow holes and things and if you ever watched any wrestling you know anything about wrestling or just ever fought as a kid somebody get you in a real hold and if you haven't trained to know how to break the hold they can get you in a hold till you submit and that's all that that's all there is to the fight but the prophet says see but the men doing knowing they wrestle they they train themselves how to break the holes that are put upon them he says see like toe holds and things he said but could you imagine now I thought this was funny could you imagine a wrestler come out now with his fingernails polished and his trunks on he said with gold beads around it he says maybe look like a pretty good wrestler but it would be all the intellectual he says he but if he hadn't got a hidden strength there now that when the enemy gets a hold hold on him then he can just pull him on uh pull him out of it you see his intellectual beads and everything won't make any difference see when he gets in the grip of the enemy won't make any difference all the intellectual he said so our intellectual means nothing unless there's a hidden power of the spirit there to break the hold of the devil see there's got to be a power to break the hold of the devil see but we are in a wrestling match but we're wrestling not with fine dressed intellectual iology we're wrestling with the power and the promises of God which can break any hold of the devil at any time I love that don't you if you're looking to break the hold of the devil tonight you're going to have to have the power of God to break the hold of the devil Jesus is our Lord and He proved it when he was Emmanuel God himself in the flesh when he met Satan he showed us how that Satan could be defeated by the word every time would come to him he'd just say it's written oh I'd like to take time here on some note I got he says how many times that he broke Satan's power with it is written showing that the Fortified person behind the word of God can scream out it's written turn loose I like that don't you it's written Satan turn loose amen a person that's fortified in that word knows that we're it's written you're standing on the word of God if you abide in me my word abide in you that's right see amen you can tell Satan turn loose it's written in the word of God and and he'll have to let go of you I I think it's a powerful thing tonight if you're going to wrestle with the devil you're going to have to know the power it is that breaks the hole that he has on you amen and and and we find that in the scripture that when you begin to fight in this battle that it was Paul that told us that we needed to take the sword of the spirit of God and and there is a but one spe one sword of the spirit of God and that's the word of God it's the only thing he uses to break the power of the devil it is the sword of the spirit you see what we find is that God is the one that would influence a Believer to pick up the sword and fight back against the devil see Satan is constantly telling people that you're in the hold of the devil and there's nothing can be done you're in a you're in a position that it is nothing could be done for your case there's no hope you in this situation for years and it's just a reoccurring thing and you've tried everything you believe amen and that would only be the devil to anoint you to unbelief but the anointing of God would anoint you to believe that the word of God could defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition it would anoint you to pick your sword up and fight back I'll tell you tonight I do not believe that we are in a situation to surrender our faith amen I say this amen amen might get bombarded and that's fine but I will not surrender my faith in this revealed word to defeat Satan anywhere any place any time amen I will not surrender my faith and I will live in a in in an existence that's not bound by five senses where I have to obey what I think feel smell hear amen but I have a soul and that Soul believes the word of God and with that soul and that word I could break the hold of Satan anywhere any place anytime because we will not surrender this thought is not over we will not give up our arms we will not lay down and walk away amen we are warriors in the spirit of God can I say this tonight I I believe we were born for this season I believe we were built for this season I I don't believe we just stumbled into this time but I believe God has anointed you and ordained you and trained you for such a season and a time as this amen I tell you what a prophet of God said he said you're his victory he said you are his victory in other words I got one that's going to break the hold of Satan he will not be able to hold on to them now now I tell you this amen you cannot be here as a spiritual being and not be influenced by one of these Dimensions the prophet of God said whether you're a sinner or a saint you're getting influenced from one of the reals amen you cannot be here and be not influenced by one side or the other you're influenced amen either from God or you're influenced from the devil brother B actually went so far to say if you're influenced by the Lord he said your Celestial body is on that side amen and I say this amen if you're influenced of God Amen then God can deal with you and do you know God deals with you with angels I know people don't hardly believe in angels and I know there's been a lot of fanaticism around Angels but I'll say this very clearly Amen in the midst of all the fanaticism Angelic uh uh Association is real Angelic Association is real I know the devil has went has took that into the world and the world is making movies and they're making all kinds of things and they're trying their best Amen to devalue what God has done but God has given Angelic Association to Believers in this age amen matter of fact anointing them and the Bible calls them ministering Spirits they meant brother B says they speak to the people's hearts as a messenger or ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God in the message of influence brother bam said it's the holy ghost that leads the church that's true but ministering Spirits are sent from God as special gifts amen and and I it shall not it shall be as I have was told me brother B says God always had ministering Spirits I believe in them that's right I believe in ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God the Holy Spirit ministers lead the church he says guardian angels that watch over us amen and y'all know guardian angels are real right if you find it in the scriptures in the Book of Matthew the 18th chapter their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven amen uh now brother Ram is associating your theophany with Angelic Association y y'all know that right amen he's he's associating a guarding angel with your theophany amen I I that's what brother random taught I don't know some people don't seem to believe that anymore but amen that's just what he said amen it's just the truth amen so Angelic Association in other words amen that there is ministering spirits and the angel of God Amen see has no more to do with me than the angel is has to do with you and if you don't believe in angels as ministering Spirits then you don't believe the Bible just take a few moments now brother bam said the new church had more Angels ministering than the Old Testament did that's right he said listen he said the Holy Ghost is over all that's the body it's true but there's also ministering spirits that are sent from the presence of God and we know Mary and all of those seen angels and we know the new church seen Angels is that right people say well they seen Angels many of you seen Angels you just didn't recognize what it was brother B said angels has has been ministering spirits to the church all through the apostolic age they had ministering spirits that went to the apostles and disciples that's right but most always it appeared to them in the form of a light amen it mostly appeared to them in the form of a light most of them didn't see a man they saw a light but it was a ministering Spirit it was the angel of the Lord amen of course amen God anoints his servants now in the greatest battle ever fought you can take a paragraph or two from paragraph 162 and brother man begins to talk about the anointing of his Spirit upon his angels upon his men and he says now if you want to see it in the Bible turn over to Hebrews chapter 4 amen uh uh chapter uh the first chapter in the 14th verse he said Hebrews says that these are ministering Spirits sent from the from the presence of God Amen to The Heirs of the Salvation amen isn't it amazing that the angels in the Bible now I'm not going to preach on angelology I just want to mention this but angels in the Bible never appeared until Abraham's seed come into the Bible how many knows that the Angels never appeared to anyone until Abraham and the first one it appeared to was Abraham's uh uh uh concubine Hagar it was about the Seed of Abraham and that's why ministering Spirits appear because we are Heirs of the Salvation of God because you're an heir that's why ministering Spirits appear can I say this very clearly ministering Spirits do not appear to you for natural things they do not appear to you for carnal reasons but if ministering Spirits are anointing the the church is for Supernatural reasons that's right remember they appeared to marry she was about to have a baby without knowing a man they appeared to Samson he was about to take over amen the Philistine Kingdom amen they appeared unto many up Through the Ages as great Supernatural anointings were visit him like Gideon when he was going to destroy amen the whole the whole the whole bunch of the confusion and he was just going to do it with a few hundred men ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God see Angels anointed to bring you the word of God Amen to cause you to believe the word of God now I know sometimes you I got a lot here so I'll run quickly but I'll say this sometimes when you're sitting in a service and some people say well amen maybe you maybe you really didn't feel anything like you're thinking emotional but something settled in your heart and and you really said man I believe that's the truth do you know that's the presence of angelic Association do you know that settled thing that settles in your heart that says that's the truth that's Angelic Association that's God anointing to you what you're hearing is the truth is that right it's God revealing to you see what it is it's causing the word to be anointed how many's ever had a revelation in church you sitting there and the power of God is coming and aen we've Shook and we've spoken tongues and we've shouted we've enjoyed and those are blessings of God that come and I I do that a lot so I'm not speaking against that and please never do from this pull pit cuz we believe in that around here amen but there are times you're sitting in the service and it's just a preaching of the word opens up a Channel of Revelation to you and all of a sudden it's just like a preacher said something and a door opened and you just step into that door and it feels like it's just you and him for a few minutes and and all of a sudden the word is coming so powerful what is it it's Revelation and it's opening the door of our opportunity it's opening the door of Deliverance it's opening the door of healing because real Revelation is what defeats the devil that's what really defeats the devil is revelation Revelation is powerful church when you get a revelation of the word that is true it's the most powerful force on the earth is revelation Revelation see but Satan would get to the carnal mind if he could but the prophet of God says like this he says see now here's the thing he says no wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it because it's Satan in that carnal mind but Satan is exposed and he does not want himself exposed now what happens is whenever Revelation comes it exposes the devil you know I I I when I was a kid now I'm going to fess up right here but when I was a kid I played some cards with some old boys and they were some pretty big Bluffs that likes to play cards you know amen but the worst thing that could happen to somebody bluffing is you find out they ain't got nothing as long as you don't know what they're holding they can run a big Bluff and usually bluffers will bet more than somebody that don't have I won't preach to you about betting tonight but but but but it but it exposes something it it exposes you know it's like somebody running around they act like they're great big and all of a sudden something is exposed about them that that that takes the air right out of them see amen and the devil likes to play like he's big he likes to really put on like he's big he likes to really brag it out like he's a really big guy amen but the devil ain't nothing but a bluff amen and this word of God will expose that devil and let you know he ain't nothing but a bluff he has no he has no he has no power he has no power he has no ability it was taken from him at the cross and the prophet of God said that's why he hates those two books of the Bible real bad amen the prophet of God said see he attacks them now what's what he does have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of this Bible more than others and through liberal theologians and pseudo scientist he's always attacking that book of Genesis and that book of Revelation so it's the devil attacking through education watch you send a kid to school and the first thing they attack is creative power and they and they w't send your kid back as if God didn't create the Earth or as if if if it really did if Noah didn't really build an Arc and save and amen they try to go through all kinds of ideas and all that what is it pseo scientist attacking amen the scripture because the Book of Genesis tells you the beginning of the Devil look if you can know the beginning of something and you can know the end of something then you lose your fear of what you're dealing with Satan we know where you come from we know where God cursed you we know when God threw you out of heavens and I can read in the back of this book what's going to happen to you in the end and he hates This Book of Revelation but it says that he is cast into the Lake of Fire amen after he's bound up for a thousand years so we're going to put him in change and then for a thousand years he'll be powerless on the Millennium but at the end of that a white Throne judgment amen I don't know about you but I want to be there I want to stand on the banks of that burning Lake and watch God cast that devil in the Lake of Fire and ever hurt and ever mean and evil thing that he's ever done to God's people amen there's a Payday coming at the end of the road that's all right devil you throw all you got at us right now but one day amen we're going to throw you in that Lake of Fire and our God will annihilate you and everything about you amen you're going to be finished but there's a bride setting here that is eternal as God is eternal and we'll set in eternity throughout eternity and talk about the glory and the power of Our Risen God our worship is not cheap we might go through some things but we will worship throughout eternity because he's our God and we know that devil and who he is and where he come from that's right he hates it and he attacks these two books that's right because it tells his origin how he's been his destruction and the way he attacks he hates to be exposed because this these books exposes what he is is't that something now Jesus told Satan you have no part and I have no part in you the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word that's his tactic destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit revelation of the word the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against her now brother B said let me bring it into my own Ministry if you don't mind you know the gift in my life is Supernatural and the gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and the thoughts of men's heart and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me and I wish I could stand I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed Now isn't the people that I'm talking about it's Satan that's got a hold in their lives through sin and indifference and disease but you should see their faces when Satan knows he's going to be exposed the most peculiar changes come over people's countenances because Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that's why he hates these meetings so much I guarantee he don't like these meetings I guarantee he don't like these meetings that pull the covers off of him when names are called and diseases are revealed Satan hates it what is it it's not mind reading it's not telepathy it's not witchcraft it's a revelation of the holy spirit amen now of course they'll call it everything to keep you from saying it's God Amen but it really is God now here's the thing is that when God reveals it by the Holy Ghost amen do y'all know there's not going to be another Calvary right right but this time Satan is defeated just like he was at Calvary but it's by Revelation that's why that the ministry of William brandham takes us back to the power of Calvary because it unfolds the mystery and exposes the demon for what he is and puts the Revelation back in the church and breaks the hold that Satan has on the People by his unbelief amen now watch this brother B says listen now Satan is trying to hold these people and the only way he could do it is by unbelief and I condemn unbelief Satan you've lost the battle you're exposed come out of this people now watch brother brandham he only his ministry was a Ministry in the realm of spirit brother Ram's Ministry was not a a Ministry in the realm of intellectual he wasn't he it wasn't it wasn't in the educated it wasn't in the society y'all all heard brother Bram talk about how when he stood one day waiting on a a building for his crowd to come in cuz another man was speaking and he said I stood there and waited and he said and when that man's crowd come out of the building he said it was high society and well dressed and everything was wonderful and well well just great people educated and the highest part of the society he said but then here come my people he said lame and blot and crippled and insane and sick and he said everything come in to my to my meetings now somebody said something one time they said well seemed like we got a lot of a lot of bad cases around the message of the hour you know and they were kind of throwing off on it and we were sitting at a table and they were kind of throwing off on message people well I I have to be honest it kind of bothers me when somebody starts making fun of message people cuz uh uh I'm one of them you know amen and and and and brother meno FZ was sitting there and brother meno said something and he probably don't want me quoting him but I'm going to quote him but but he said he said something very powerful he said to the brother he said listen I know what you're saying he said but listen this message gives hope to everybody amen now an education an intellectual church can only give hope to somebody in education and intellect but the message of the hour offers hope that no longer h no longer how long the devil's had a hold on you this message offers hope that you can break the power of it no no matter what kind of no matter what kind of family you were born to this message offers hope I don't care if your daddy was a drunk and your mama was a harlot this message offers hope it offers hope to your life it it offers hope to your homes it opens offers hope into your life because this message has a power in it that that can break the hold that the devil has on you listen if it's a genetic hold there a power in this message to break the genetic curses that are carried down through your life there's a power in this message that'll break temper and stubbornness and pride and has captured your whole family but you don't have to carry it there's a God here to expose and it come from the pits of hell and you can walk out of this building tonight free you can walk out of here with no hold upon you tonight because this message brings hope nobody is outside of the power of Hope with this message it can bring hope it can bring life because it operates in the realm of the spirit see brother bam says when it comes time for God to use me he takes me somewhere I don't know nothing about and when I'm coming back I lose sight of places and times but that's where it speaks to me there's a land beyond the river they call the sweet forever in a place where here on Earth we can rise into a spirit realm there's a place where we can go I I love how brother Ram says that I wish tonight that everyone would try to understand closely the angel of the Lord and his great mission and his work here on the earth now we know he's here but what is commission and what is the work that he had on the earth his work here on the Earth was to restore the faith of the children of God that they could return back to the power that God had gave us at the at the day of Pentecost actually the power of the true Sons now we bring them to Pentecost but I I just have to say this from my heart I believe that that message will take you further than that I think it'll take you to Pentecost and Beyond I believe it'll take you all the way back to the Garden of Eden when God fellowshipped with his children in the Garden of Eden now that work the working of his Spirit brother brandom says my work was in the realm now you you Doctor you can tell me about your body about the anatomy but my work is in the realm of the spirit that's where I live a big part of my life is in another Dimension that the world doesn't know anything about now I don't try to explain it he said there's no reason to try you can't in demonology brother Bram says it like this that of course Christians are influenced by one or the other now these these influences of course are coming from one side of the other now the devil has His prophets and God has his do you see what I mean stop to separate it listen to Prophet stop to separate it God has prophets and Satan has prophets don't just accept it all as spiritual stop and separate the word of God will separate it it's quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it'll separate the fallacy from the truth it'll leave a man standing right in truth you see what it is get in now now now man today he cannot break into that realm and getting a righteous man brother B's talking I'm sorry he's talking about going into that realm where where Samuel uh was called out by Saul he said of course in that day that Saul could call him out in that Realm of the spirit he said but today you can't break into that spirit and call a righteous man out of there he said because the blood of Christ done away with Paradise so so that right ious man ain't there anymore to call out like they did in the days of Saul see but there is two spirits on the earth and they're influencing the people now brother R says now he gave me a gift and I can submit myself into a certain realm of that spirit that God can open to you now it's a realm of the spirit see now watch what brother Braham says he takes it to our Lord where Jesus said I do not the works but my father doeth The Works in me he says see no flesh glories in the sight of God it's all in the realm of the spirit see now now I read something last week and I want to reread it to you I want to just barrel down on it just for a moment how can I overcome it means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks now remember Ephesians 6 says it to withstand the devil in the Ws of the devil is that right to catch him in every trick now now now there's a there's a there's a powerful thing you have to stop and separate because the Bible says that the trials of the righteous are like pure gold so some of the trials or some of the situations that you face are trials that God has sent your way that's right it's not the Ws of the devil it's God bringing you to a place that you might be able to be molded into the image of God some of the things we face you know I I know sometimes we well you know this is all the devil well sometimes it's not sometimes the holy spirit is allowing things that it might help us to perfect our character amen do you see but you got to recognize to overcome me to recognize the source of this recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people say that there is no devil it's just a thought but don't you believe that the devil is real he's as real as you or anybody else the devil is real and you must recognize him real now watch at the same time you've got to recognize him as a devil and he's against you but to overcome somebody say to overcome to overcome you might recognize that God is greater and mightier than he is that's the one that's in you has already overcome him by his grace you are more than a match for him there's real overcoming see you can break any any hold he puts on You by recognizing the devil's got a choke hold on me but there's somebody in me greater than the one that's holding me and I got a way to break the power that he's got on me I'm not Imagining the devil's choking me amen he really is trying to choke me but there's somebody in me that's greater than the one trying to hold me now watch what brother random is saying now look now he says there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ that not what I after the spirit after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome you know what he is as a devil now you can't say I got sickness but I don't believe it's sickness now this is a real this is a real spot right here that we we should take a moment it is a sickness don't go around and try to say you know I I I I've met people and they say well the doctor's trying to tell me I got cancer I ain't got cancer well brother B don't say that he says go ahead and admit you got cancer go ahead that's right he says you got cancer but you don't believe it is a cancer but it is a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world this is not mind over matter you're not imagining that you don't have cancer you really got cancer but there's a God that is greater than cancer see greater is he you're not imagining that you're tempted you're not imagining that you really are tempted you're tempted in your body you're tempted in this world but greater is he that's in you that's in the temptation of your body you you see what it is you got to you got to quit imagining that it's not real it is real it really is it's a real sickness and if you don't do something it'll kill you yes are you hearing me now watch this you must realize the holy spirit is in you has already overcome this thing well brother Wayne I tell you what I can deal with that well let's let's go let's go a step further how many ready go a step further he said and Elijah he said now bless this man lay hands upon him he said and ask that this nervous disorder leave him now listen I'm ask in Jesus name nervousness is the hardest thing there is to fight worse than cancer worse than cancer isn't it amazing amen that if you tell somebody what's nerves causing it they want to act like you think there's nothing wrong with them or you just think well they're just you know they're just making something up no you've got to admit that nervousness is worse than cancer come on church now I I I put a lot of study in this I know where I'm standing nervousness is worse than cancer and brother man said the reason is because you can't hardly Min balance yourself you can't get your mind running right so when you get nervous you can't catch your balance it's like a a person that they they just don't know where Amen to go or what to do it's almost like a man that's been punched from every corner and he don't know what to do where to turn where to go oh it's going to it's going to get me I I don't know where to go I don't I don't know where to run you've got to admit that it's a devil that it's real but greater is he that is in you that is he that's in the nervousness that's trying to choke off your life Satan will kill you if you let him he'll take all the joy out of your experience he'll take the joy out of your family he'll take the joy out of coming to church he'll take the joy out of having children nervousness will wreck you but you got to admit it's a devil and then you got to pick up your sword and fight back I tell you get up and fight back tell that devil tonight I'm going to break your hold in this meeting I'm going to warn you this is not a sermon this is a ministering angel speaking to you pick up your sword and fight back break that Devil's hold over your life don't just don't just lay there it's real it's real let me let me let me go into something deep here that the prophet said now I just said that his his ministry was in the realm of spirit it was not like a doctor it was in the realm of Revelation which exposes the devil do you see brother B said you believe me to be a servant you do that's the reason I asked you that he told me if you get the people to believe and be sincere he said I don't know anything about you nothing about you but I couldn't heal you if I had to nothing that I could do to heal you nor even know what's wrong with you I'm not a doctor I have to examine and I'd have to examine you to find out what was wrong and maybe then I couldn't do it I love this he said I could put you under x-rays but the spirit of God is the master X-ray and he's here and he knows all these things and he looks back down through the cycle of time do you believe that now between you and I stands a dark object there's a patience sh in front of him and he said now I'm going to put you under an x-ray machine that is the Lord Jesus the master X-ray and I see between you and I there's a dark object there's a floating cloud moving and I know who it is and I know what it does to people you're bothered with a nervous Condition it's a middle nervousness it's upset and you think sometimes that you're going to lose your mind isn't that right I'm not reading your mind now it has moved from you your faith without prayer has made you whole now watch this here's a man standing under an x-ray machine but as a prophet exposes it it loses its power without prayer the the exposition the revelation of the devil when God revealed what was causing the problem amen he showed how small it was in the presence of that kind of God and the man was healed without prayer but by faith now watch brother bradam I I I won't read all the forefronts of these but I'm going to read a few right in the middle of these there's another one standing there he said you feel like something standing near and I see what's wrong with you it's a nervous Condition it's a mental nervousness to tell you how you feel now oh God he's not just going to tell you what's wrong with you he's about to tell you how you feel when this comes on you this is how you feel he says you feel like you're going to lose your mind you're upset aren't you everything goes wrong it works on you and the worst time it's in the evening wow now this Prophet is telling you how you feel he's telling you how you feel about everything and then he's telling you even when it turns in the evening you start feeling worse he says sometimes you just sit in a chair you're doing something when you pray to oh you're woring some dishes when you're praying here's a here's a prophet who's completely exposing he didn't say to the person brother Samuel you got to think of this he didn't say to the person you this is just in your head sister you need to just get a you need to get a grip this is just look look look this is just in your you're just this is all in your head you need to man up he didn't say that he said what's happening is a nervous spirit's getting on you and in your mind you think you're losing your mind everything bothers you and it gets worse as it gets in the evening now now watch the prophet detail this thing Angel of the Lord Brother bam says it again you're worrying about something you're bothered you're upset now this is to a patient he says you're real nervous aren't you kind of a mental nervous and it's causing you to have all kinds of funny feelings isn't that true it mainly works on you in the afternoon long late in the evening when you get tired and run down that has caused the trouble see what's caused the trouble it's a nerve condition now watch him detail this he's he's laying it out you know what's amazing brother brother Aiden when I was putting these together I actually had to go back and keep rereading because I thought I had the same quote I I I kept thinking I've got the same quote again and again but I didn't it was the same spirit in different places he was so detailing to the individual that spirit that the car istics of that Spirit again he would tell it over here in Alberta then he would tell it down there in Jeffersonville and then he would tell it over here because that Spirit whever it was it acted the same now sister Lily sitting over there as a doctor some of you are are sitting here you know this amen that you start looking for characteristics in the natural you look for characteristics of sickness and you don't care amen what country they're from or what place they're from or anything else because sicknesses have characteristics and demons have characteristics and the spiritual characteristic of this nervousness watch the prophet says it here look it's a mental nervousness the woman asked should I believe when I feel like I'm dying wow now this woman believed she was dying but when she began to talk to brother bam she said should I even believe when I feel like I'm about to die brother man said you believe regardless of anything don't matter if you feel like you're dying don't matter if you feel like you're about to lose your mind you don't surrender your faith don't surrender your faith it's the only thing that can break the hold of the devil do not Surrender Your Faith Church You Must Believe regardless you
