[2:19] name amen and amen and God bless you
[2:23] today if you have your Bibles let's look
[2:25] in the Book of John and let's look in
[2:27] the third chapter and the eth verse 1
[2:30] John chapter 3 and verse 8 and verse 9
[2:35] amen um we uh certainly enjoyed those
[2:38] songs today amen what a blessing amen
[2:41] the song services are always such a
[2:44] blessing amen
[2:46] um like on Thursday I got to be out here
[2:49] for it and man I feel like having a
[2:51] runaway every time I get in one these
[2:54] song Services I amen I I'm I I just I'm
[2:57] oldfashioned I like that worship and
[2:59] that spirit moving and ah it feels so
[3:02] good to me amen 1 John chapter 3 and
[3:05] verse
[3:06] 8 now he that committes sin is of the
[3:10] devil for the devil sinth from the
[3:14] beginning now for this
[3:16] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[3:19] yeah that he might
[3:22] destroy the works of the
[3:25] devil whosoever is born of God do not
[3:30] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[3:34] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[3:38] God God bless you as you be seated this
[3:41] morning I'd like to talk to you
[3:43] today of just a little thought that's on
[3:46] my heart and just in correlation with
[3:48] some of the things that I've been
[3:49] speaking recently and I want to talk to
[3:51] you today this would be a title maybe
[3:54] something that we could focus on Amen I
[3:56] want to talk to you about the dirt of
[3:58] the day
[4:00] The Offspring of God the dirt of The Day
[4:04] The Offspring of God in 1 John chapter 3
[4:07] we find here that Jesus was manifested
[4:11] to destroy the works of the devil and he
[4:15] goes on to say that whosoever is born of
[4:17] God cannot commit sin for his seed
[4:20] remaineth in him I'll tell you just a
[4:23] couple places brother Bram speaks of
[4:24] this scripture and he said I seen
[4:26] squirrels appear y on six different
[4:28] times he he said I knew uh one that
[4:31] would be sitting here and he could
[4:33] create squirrels and he could create
[4:35] flies or frogs or anything the Creator
[4:37] no mortal being but when that sin of
[4:40] that mortal is confessed and dropped
[4:42] into the Clorox of the bleach of Jesus
[4:44] Christ that bleaches all sin he's purely
[4:49] unadulterated without sin and without
[4:51] fault now he that is born of God doth
[4:55] not commit sin for he cannot sin the
[4:58] bleach stand between him and God and how
[5:01] could he ever get there when it breaks
[5:04] it up and sends it back to the one who
[5:06] perverted it well I feel pretty
[5:08] religious he said I feel that
[5:10] stimulation when it begins to reveal
[5:13] amen now this is his explanation of this
[5:15] scripture here again in the first seal
[5:17] brother B will say this he that is born
[5:19] of God does not commit sin for he cannot
[5:22] sin how can you make him a sinner when
[5:25] the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ
[5:28] is between him and God
[5:30] that would scatter sin till there would
[5:31] be nothing left of it see how can that
[5:34] pure blood of Christ ever let sin pass
[5:37] it cannot amen he that is born of God
[5:40] see he can't even sin because there's a
[5:43] sacrifice between him and God Amen I
[5:47] thank God this morning for the work of
[5:49] Christ to destroy the works of the devil
[5:52] as it says in John chapter 1 and verse
[5:54] 12 it says but as many as received him
[5:56] to them he gave power to become the sons
[5:59] of God God even to them that believe
[6:01] upon his name now which were born not of
[6:05] blood not of the will of the flesh nor
[6:08] of the will of man but of God amen amen
[6:12] born of God now brother bam explaining
[6:14] this scripture says listen your adoption
[6:17] is not your birth you're your your
[6:19] adoption is your placing now when you're
[6:22] born again in John 1:7 when we are born
[6:26] to the spirit of God we are sons of God
[6:28] but we are predestinated and that's
[6:30] where I'm trying to get you to see for
[6:32] the sons of the last days we're
[6:34] predestinated unto adoption now here we
[6:37] are this is what hurts the Pentecostals
[6:39] a little they say I got born again
[6:42] praise God I got the Holy Ghost he said
[6:44] that's fine you're a child of God that's
[6:47] right but that's not what I'm talking
[6:50] about I'm talking about adoption I'm
[6:52] talking about the placing of a son amen
[6:55] now what he's talking about is that Sons
[6:58] come into existence amen God's Sons amen
[7:01] and I certainly believe that we were
[7:03] born I don't believe we were born of the
[7:05] will of man but I certainly believe we
[7:07] were born of the will of God Amen that
[7:09] we were born of the spirit of God signs
[7:12] of his coming brother B will say this if
[7:14] the word of the Lord that is a
[7:16] premeditated thought see that's how we
[7:18] have eternal life is because we were
[7:21] spoken into existence by
[7:24] God yes I just said that you were spoken
[7:28] into existence by God you didn't join a
[7:31] church but you were borned by the word
[7:34] that Original Seed that God said let
[7:36] there be and there was and that's the
[7:38] way God's born children are today in the
[7:40] womb of their heart with the word and
[7:43] his word takes root and it grows Amen in
[7:46] wisdom versus face brother bam said if
[7:48] you're born again child of God you are
[7:51] and you got the holy spirit in you you
[7:54] are the manifestation of God's word
[7:57] before it was a word and it's got to be
[8:00] a thought before it can be a word and a
[8:02] word is a spoken thought and the thought
[8:05] was in God and then we were in God in
[8:09] eternity and we were spoken into
[8:13] existence by the
[8:15] word amen we were spoken into existence
[8:19] by the word amen how many believes that
[8:21] this morning amen you you see when God's
[8:23] word created he created you brother B
[8:27] says it like this in the Easter seal he
[8:28] says see the tree of death was the
[8:31] mother he said that's of course in Eden
[8:33] that's how children come forth out of
[8:35] the tree of death in other words they
[8:36] come out of the woman and and they
[8:38] should have come from Adam by the word
[8:40] amen but they come from the woman and
[8:42] brother B said There It Is she brought
[8:43] death into natural life but Christ is
[8:47] the birth through spiritual life and
[8:49] that all that live by the woman dies but
[8:52] all that is born by the man lives amen
[8:56] all that is born to the man lives see
[8:58] all that comes by by the woman is
[9:00] natural and all that comes from the man
[9:02] is spiritual not the man here the man
[9:06] Christ Jesus so if you're born of a
[9:08] woman you're going to die but if you're
[9:10] born of this word you're going to live
[9:12] amen because everything born of this
[9:14] word has eternal life I think of the
[9:17] prophet of God's way of letting us know
[9:19] invisible Union with Christ he talks
[9:21] about how to know the difference of what
[9:24] we're born by amen I like that don't you
[9:26] he said if you're born to the first Adam
[9:28] amen there the way they act he says see
[9:31] another thing what kind of children is
[9:33] she bearing the church he said that
[9:35] tells you what the papa is if it's the
[9:37] first Adam or the second Adam if the
[9:39] church brings forth a child of the
[9:41] second Adam he will act like the second
[9:44] Adam's way of acting like they did it on
[9:47] the day of Pentecost oh I like that
[9:50] don't you amen if you're going to if
[9:52] you're going to be his child you're
[9:53] going to act like he brings his children
[9:56] see God don't bring his children by
[9:58] Church joining and by handshaking he
[10:01] does it like he did it in the book of
[10:02] Acts in the upper room he brings it by
[10:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on
[10:08] Church y'all know all of them was
[10:09] predestinated seed that was in that
[10:11] Upper Room there was 120 of them but
[10:14] they still had to receive the Holy Ghost
[10:17] amen before they had a New Birth by that
[10:19] baptism amen I love it this morning to
[10:22] know when the prophet of God talks about
[10:24] this end time he he talks about he talks
[10:26] about how Amen in in invisible Union if
[10:29] you're not listening to it lately it's a
[10:30] good book to go back and listen to but
[10:32] he talks about the uh modern church and
[10:35] he said the really the way to understand
[10:37] the condition of the church is look at
[10:39] the women on the street and he said look
[10:41] when you see them doing whatever they
[10:43] want to do he said there's your church
[10:44] natural he said when Jesus was upon the
[10:47] Earth he said they was weeping when he
[10:50] was going to the cross and he says to
[10:52] them don't weep for me weep for
[10:54] yourselves he said because there's going
[10:56] to come a day that they're going to say
[10:58] blessed is a woman that's never given
[10:59] birth or perhaps is never given suck and
[11:02] brother said see Jesus knew that this
[11:05] day was coming when the women wouldn't
[11:07] want to give birth to children no
[11:09] more right and and brother B paused it
[11:13] an end time thing he says see and if
[11:15] they can't get birth to a child he said
[11:17] they want to mother a cat or they don't
[11:19] want to mother a dog he said because
[11:21] it's in them to mother now if you like
[11:23] to read it and you want to be spiritual
[11:25] you can go on and see brother Ram's
[11:27] talking about the church amen wants to
[11:29] Mother something so it mothers cats and
[11:32] dogs and rats and Ricky and Elvises and
[11:35] he's telling you something and what he's
[11:36] saying to you they're always mothering
[11:39] something amen but they don't want to
[11:41] change the form to let the power of God
[11:44] birth a real son among them because they
[11:47] don't want things to get out of out of
[11:48] out of sink or out of order amen it has
[11:51] to be a certain way and keep a certain
[11:53] form brother B said see that's a true
[11:55] picture of the modern church today they
[11:57] don't want any of these screaming
[11:59] shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young
[12:03] around her see she don't want any of
[12:05] them whooping and crying and screaming
[12:08] Hallelujah such a child would
[12:10] immediately put her out of her
[12:12] denomination one like that in the church
[12:14] they'd throw it out right quick said he
[12:16] says brother R says well you're letting
[12:18] stuff just go on like this he said see
[12:21] but she's pregnated with something
[12:23] because she's bringing members all the
[12:25] time but she don't want none of them
[12:28] screaming holl and blabber and acts 238
[12:31] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[12:33] are it would certainly embarrass her it
[12:35] would ruin her education ethical
[12:38] scientific society that she belongs to
[12:41] they would throw her out at the next
[12:42] Council cuz she can't have that they
[12:44] don't want to be pregnated with the word
[12:48] look at this they don't want to be
[12:49] pregnated with the word because that's
[12:51] the only kind I know y'all know this
[12:53] that's the only kind that the word can
[12:56] bring forth the word brings for children
[13:00] like he did in Acts chapter 2 that's
[13:03] God's way of birthing children it's not
[13:06] handshaking it's not head kny it's by
[13:09] the baptism of the holy ghost that comes
[13:11] into the soul amen and it bursts an
[13:14] individual into life I love how brother
[13:16] B says it like this born to the spirit
[13:18] of God it's got the spirit of God in it
[13:21] it's not an intellectual Church joining
[13:23] and a Creed of bobbed haired and painted
[13:25] faces and things that's why they do the
[13:28] way they do is because because they
[13:29] never was born again so they're not
[13:31] subject to the word of God they're only
[13:34] subject to Creeds and dogmas and church
[13:36] anity amen but oh if you ever come by
[13:39] this word amen there is something on the
[13:42] inside that makes you line up to this
[13:44] word of God because it's who you are
[13:47] it's it's the nature that's on the
[13:48] inside of you because you have been
[13:51] birthed brother B said see you don't
[13:53] find all of that stuff in the Bible of
[13:55] church joining and intellectuals and
[13:57] painted faces and bobbed hairs he said
[13:59] but what you're going to find is an
[14:01] oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost
[14:03] filled child born of the spirit of God
[14:06] screaming hollering shouting and
[14:09] praising God oh I love it don't you
[14:11] people today say well I'll tell you what
[14:13] amen people you don't even have to know
[14:15] when you're born again brother B says Oh
[14:17] They'll take it and say well we believe
[14:19] in the New Birth without sensation and
[14:21] they'll get off on that side and so
[14:22] we'll just believe it amen that's what
[14:24] Mary did she just believed it all that's
[14:26] so
[14:27] one-sided because the of that scripture
[14:30] it is not talking about Mary's New Birth
[14:33] it's talking about Mary having Christ
[14:35] come into her to save the world but when
[14:37] she was going to get saved herself God
[14:40] commanded that she went to that upper
[14:42] room and she got drunk and talked in
[14:44] tongues and shouted and danced and moved
[14:47] like everybody else did because it
[14:50] requires an experience of God not a
[14:53] church joining you got to get in contact
[14:55] with something that can change it can
[14:57] change natures and life lives amen come
[15:00] on church I believe this morning that
[15:02] there is a God that can change natures
[15:06] and he can change lives amen and I know
[15:09] the world don't want it amen but it's
[15:10] the truth anyhow amen it'll produce acts
[15:14] 238 tongue talking babies and it'll
[15:16] produce shouting and praising and
[15:18] worshiping and Holy Ghost and the day
[15:20] you don't want that among you amen you
[15:23] know that we have God on the wrong
[15:25] foot
[15:27] Hallelujah I remember years ago sitting
[15:29] at a table and we were brother Brian and
[15:30] I and some of them were fellowshipping
[15:32] and I said listen guys I just want to
[15:34] tell you the truth amen I don't care
[15:36] anything about having a big church I
[15:37] said what I do care about is worshiping
[15:39] God and I would rather be in this
[15:42] parking lot out here with a tambourine
[15:44] and two or three people and be able to
[15:46] enjoy the word of God and enjoy
[15:49] worshiping and singing and rejoicing
[15:52] then have a whole church full of people
[15:54] that don't want to love God or they
[15:55] don't want to worship God or want to
[15:57] praise God but I tell you why sometimes
[16:00] people don't want to praise God it's
[16:02] because somebody put you in a cage
[16:05] somebody put a bar over you and said you
[16:08] shouldn't shout and you shouldn't
[16:09] worship and you shouldn't sing and they
[16:11] say it's bad church members amen but I
[16:14] don't believe so I think we ought to
[16:15] take the bars and we ought to release
[16:17] the Eagles of God that they can enjoy
[16:20] the fellowship and the worship and enjoy
[16:23] the presence of God friends because
[16:25] after all what else do we have what else
[16:28] else do we have come on I left the bars
[16:31] I left the drugs I left the alcohol I
[16:34] left the World Behind my pleasure is in
[16:37] the
[16:39] presence of a living God when he comes
[16:42] down and breaks in the corridor of my
[16:44] soul in the middle of even the children
[16:46] of God listen I am not ashamed of the
[16:50] results in the presence of a living God
[16:52] Among
[16:55] Us
[16:56] Hallelujah I certainly believe in this
[16:59] morning don't you believe it sir let's
[17:01] give a big Hallelujah to the Lord this
[17:05] morning hallelujah amen back there down
[17:08] in the South you know once in a while
[17:09] you get around Florida and you get them
[17:11] you get in them big retirement areas and
[17:13] you get where the where the where the
[17:15] warm nice weather and the and the seas
[17:17] are and things like this they get
[17:18] communities and they call it a mature
[17:21] living in other words they don't want no
[17:22] kids
[17:24] around and one no kids splashing in the
[17:27] pool and whipping and hollering all that
[17:29] stuff amen so they getting what they
[17:31] call mature you know well I hope our
[17:33] church never get so mature that we don't
[17:35] have some new Young ons run around the
[17:37] church amen that are filled with the
[17:39] Holy Ghost and Experiencing God listen
[17:42] amen you think about this where would
[17:44] you be this morning had you not come in
[17:48] contact with god with an experience that
[17:51] could be greater than your experience in
[17:53] the church because we've had so many
[17:55] experiences we've had so many Church
[17:57] experiences amen and probably as many
[18:00] bad experiences as we've had good
[18:02] experiences with people in churches but
[18:05] we've had an experience with God that
[18:07] trumps every experience
[18:10] that ah Hallelujah I'm so glad I met
[18:17] him amen now I I I say this it is
[18:21] written and the prophet will teach us
[18:23] this thing that a man that has received
[18:25] the Holy Ghost is deity himself right
[18:29] true hey hey somebody tell that devil go
[18:33] on out of here
[18:34] now a man or a woman that's born to the
[18:37] spirit of God is the part of God your
[18:38] sons and daughters of God and Jesus
[18:40] didn't say it is written in the
[18:42] scriptures that ye are Gods didn't it
[18:45] say that in the scriptures you are Gods
[18:47] now he's tying that together with
[18:49] receiving deity in you now in John
[18:52] chapter 10 if you like to read it it
[18:53] says Jesus answered said is it not
[18:55] written in your law ye are Gods if you
[18:58] call them Gods into whom the word of God
[19:00] came to the scripture cannot be broken
[19:03] and Jesus Christ the same 1957 brother
[19:05] bam said if you'll read that John
[19:07] chapter 10 in the 30th verse he said
[19:09] listen close to the reading and then
[19:12] apply that reading to right
[19:14] now this very hour amen now in Psalms 82
[19:19] it's written in there I have said ye are
[19:21] gods and all of you are the
[19:25] children of the most high my ah
[19:29] offsprings of God Amen offsprings of God
[19:33] Amen testimony of a witness what is it
[19:35] it's the Holy Ghost the true witness of
[19:37] God what is it it is deity tabernacled
[19:41] in a man yes sir am that's the reason we
[19:45] can't receive the Holy Ghost as
[19:47] emotion that's the reason we don't
[19:49] receive the Holy Ghost amen as a
[19:52] theology or as a Doctrine we must know
[19:55] the Holy Ghost is a person and that
[19:58] person is Christ and he deity dwells in
[20:01] brother mam says it like this God is
[20:03] living in a man deity God himself
[20:05] tabernacled in a person he said when he
[20:08] can speak and it'll be the same as God
[20:10] speaking that's the F the first church
[20:13] went forth amen that's the way the first
[20:16] church went forth God's agents amen what
[20:19] do he say as my father sent me so sin I
[20:23] you amen ain't you glad the one that
[20:25] sent you goes in you brother Josh you
[20:28] just got back from Nicaragua those camp
[20:29] meetings aren't you glad he didn't send
[20:31] you to Nicaragua and you had to go by
[20:33] yourself but the one that sent you went
[20:35] in you and if you got the baptism of the
[20:38] Holy Ghost deity is walking in the dirt
[20:42] of this day my I'm so glad that deity
[20:47] can come in the dirt of this day amen
[20:50] see we accept deity in the dirt of other
[20:53] days but for some reason we think dirt
[20:55] is different today than it was yesterday
[20:58] do you know the dirt ain't never changed
[21:00] the dirt that Moses had the dirt Joshua
[21:03] had the dirt Jesus had the dirt Peter
[21:05] had the they JS amen dirt is dirt folks
[21:09] and God chose dirt of other days and we
[21:12] can so glorify God and what he done in
[21:15] the dirt of that day but this is the
[21:17] dirt of this day hallelujah amen and the
[21:20] blood has fell upon the Earth to redeem
[21:24] that dirt that God could come and get
[21:26] inside you and use you for his glory and
[21:29] for his Mercy I think it's beautiful I
[21:32] think this great and wonderful church
[21:34] will go forth in the power of deity
[21:36] because deity will be revealed in human
[21:39] beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to
[21:42] pass the thought of your
[21:46] mind I got more quotes and I'll have
[21:48] time to preach but I'm going to put a
[21:49] couple of them out here before we move
[21:51] if we become the spirit sons of God then
[21:54] deity dwells in
[21:56] man I just say it can I can I say like
[21:58] this deity dwells in
[22:03] dirt y y'all help me now is the dirt any
[22:06] different
[22:07] today than it was another
[22:11] day so you made out the same
[22:15] thing see that said brother B said they
[22:18] said nothing is impossible to God that's
[22:20] true but he said nothing's impossible
[22:23] with you if you believe it not with God
[22:27] but you
[22:29] because deity is in you brother bam even
[22:33] tells us this much that when the word
[22:35] comes into you the holy spirit in there
[22:36] it's alive as soon as it comes in and
[22:39] nothing see if you say to the mountain
[22:41] be moved and don't doubt because what is
[22:44] it it's deity
[22:46] speaking you believe that I believe that
[22:50] it's not you it's deity speaking now
[22:52] some people don't even believe in y
[22:54] y'all know I mean it's sad to say there
[22:57] some people don't even believe the spok
[22:58] words in the bride yeah they think all
[23:01] that was reserved for the prophet and
[23:02] then when after after the brother brand
[23:04] passed then we're waiting now for
[23:06] brother Ram's resurrection and when we
[23:08] raise brother randam then he's going to
[23:10] take the book and then he's going to
[23:11] speak
[23:13] and come on
[23:15] now but God Made A Way by the message to
[23:20] energize your faith to make you believe
[23:24] this Bible is
[23:25] true now now watch brother bam he uses
[23:28] this in spiritual Amnesia and he says
[23:30] can you identify with John 14:12 amen
[23:34] and what's it saying there he that
[23:35] believeth in me the works that I do
[23:37] should Greater Works shall you do and
[23:38] you know the Greater Works brother Bam's
[23:41] final statement on Greater Works was the
[23:43] third pull was the spoken word and
[23:47] brother bam says this if you abide in me
[23:49] by word in you this is from Amnesia amen
[23:51] he says listen now Mark 11 said if you
[23:54] say to this mountain and be moved and
[23:56] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[23:57] that what you have said shall come to
[23:59] pass you shall have what you have said
[24:02] can you be identified there he says to
[24:06] believe that this is the truth see if it
[24:10] hasn't then you are getting spiritual
[24:14] Amnesia when you can't say Mark 11
[24:17] belongs to this bride or John 14 belongs
[24:20] to this bride then you've got amnesia
[24:22] and you forgot what a Son of God is
[24:25] that's what happened in the Garden of
[24:26] Eden Adam forgot he forgot what it was
[24:30] to control the wind and control the
[24:32] waves and tell the Lions to lay down he
[24:34] forgot but the message of the hour has
[24:37] come to shake you out of your Amnesia
[24:41] and make you remember you are always a
[24:44] son come on not a son yesterday but you
[24:47] were a son in the mind of God that's why
[24:49] the Baptist Church can't bring you to
[24:51] the place God's trying to bring you to
[24:53] that's why the Presbyterians can't do it
[24:55] that's why intellectuals can't do it
[24:58] it's because it'll take the mind of God
[25:01] to connect you back to the memory of the
[25:03] word that you come out of so you can
[25:07] remember the past but you can remember
[25:09] the
[25:10] future I don't have time to preach there
[25:12] that's good stuff though you can
[25:14] remember the past but you can remember
[25:16] the
[25:17] future just remember what the word
[25:20] speaks concerning you that's your future
[25:22] and 1 John chapter 3 again the scripture
[25:24] says beloved now we're the sons of God
[25:26] and it do not yet appear what we sh
[25:28] shall be but we know when he shall
[25:30] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[25:31] see him as he is now of course this is
[25:34] also speaking of the change of the body
[25:36] so we never want to dismiss that I don't
[25:38] want you to think I've got off all on
[25:40] the spiritual side this is speaking of
[25:42] the change of the body but we do
[25:44] recognize this is speaking of the
[25:47] appearing of Christ before the Rapture
[25:51] and it's speaking brother bandom lets us
[25:52] know that we didn't know because it had
[25:55] ever been manifest but as Christ has
[25:57] manifested himself in this message to
[25:59] prove to us what real sunship is about
[26:03] and we can announce it now and say we
[26:05] are now Sons and Daughters of God now
[26:08] you you you you you got to you got to
[26:09] catch the point behind 1 John 3 because
[26:12] he's showing you sunship in
[26:15] dirt now it's not sunship in angelics
[26:19] and and I I just have to be honest some
[26:21] people have so distorted the idea of
[26:24] what true sunship is you're never going
[26:27] to get there
[26:29] amen it's like a carrot out in front of
[26:31] a rabbit and you're just never going to
[26:34] get there you're never going to make it
[26:36] because it has been placed so wrongly
[26:39] amen that you would have to be an angel
[26:41] to make it you you're going to talk
[26:43] about you're going to talking about
[26:44] sinless perfection and you're going to
[26:46] you're going to talk about never making
[26:47] a mistake and amen but it's a detriment
[26:50] to teach it it's a detriment to teach
[26:52] that to the children because amen you
[26:55] know and I know that none of us amen
[26:58] have ever escaped without Temptations
[27:00] and trials and problems on every hand
[27:03] but some reason we're still standing and
[27:06] it's not amen it's not amen because of
[27:09] how good we are it's because of what's
[27:12] in the dirt deity is in the dirt and it
[27:16] keeps us
[27:17] standing Hallelujah it keeps us standing
[27:21] gives us a right interpretation of
[27:23] sunship you see we are now Sons that's
[27:25] why I can say to you brother John amen I
[27:28] know probably you're not perfect and and
[27:30] I'm sure she thinks you are amen and
[27:32] your children think you are but probably
[27:34] down deep you know maybe there's
[27:35] something there I've never seen but that
[27:37] might be something there but I'll say
[27:39] this I can say over you you are now a
[27:43] son you see that I can say that with
[27:45] struggles and problems and issues amen
[27:48] and imperfections but we can announce we
[27:50] are now
[27:53] Sons we are right now Sons
[27:58] yeah because we wasn't being Sons when
[28:01] we got put in a Celestial body we are
[28:04] sons in a terrestrial
[28:07] bodybody said well you ain't never going
[28:09] to have the mistakes and all that that's
[28:10] true that's true but that's when I hit
[28:13] my
[28:14] Celestial but right now I'm in my
[28:16] terrestrial and unless you hadn't looked
[28:18] it up lately let me give you a
[28:20] definition of it it's a tabernacle of
[28:25] humiliation if you ain't got there yet
[28:27] just get some
[28:33] AG I went in for a checkup to doctor the
[28:36] other day and they told me some test
[28:37] they'd like to do to check my colon I
[28:39] said
[28:42] uhuh they said it's life saving I said
[28:45] well we'll
[28:47] [Laughter]
[28:49] wait it had to be
[28:53] life-threatening I don't know some of
[28:55] these things are humiliating yeah
[28:59] now you young people ain't got a clue so
[29:02] just you'll get
[29:06] there but as you as you accept the idea
[29:09] we are now Sons you're going to have to
[29:13] receive that knowing the parts of you
[29:17] that are
[29:20] dirt you're going to have to receive
[29:22] that now now it would be easier for the
[29:25] devil to talk you out of it right and
[29:28] say well now now someday you could
[29:31] be and I know you believe the message
[29:33] you're on the right line now but if
[29:36] you're going to make the claims that God
[29:39] has
[29:40] made you're going to have to start
[29:43] figuring some stuff
[29:44] out because it's hard to correlate we
[29:47] are now Sons with the idea of sunship so
[29:52] there must be something here that God is
[29:54] trying to blend together to show you
[29:57] that when you become a son you don't
[29:59] become Angelic but you become deity in
[30:05] dirt now I love how Jesus said it in
[30:07] Mark 11 he said I say unto you I like
[30:11] that don't you I wish I had the power
[30:13] amen of Christ to speak that to you as
[30:15] he spoke it to them I say unto
[30:18] you not somebody else coming but to you
[30:22] if you say unto this mountain be thou
[30:24] moved brother brandom actually said he
[30:26] said it to the little gods
[30:28] he said he said the only god without sin
[30:31] said it to the little Gods who were
[30:33] there if you say unto this mountain that
[30:36] it shall be moved now I say unto you so
[30:39] what we find is then that brother randam
[30:41] is showing us that a manifestation of
[30:43] the sons of God true Sons born Sons when
[30:45] they speak their word is going to be
[30:47] back do you know in Romans 8:19 the
[30:50] Bible said the expectation of the whole
[30:52] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[30:55] of the sons of
[30:56] God now brother says it like this but
[30:59] this is the day of the manifestation of
[31:02] sons when the Mysteries that has been
[31:05] hid since the foundation of the world
[31:06] would be made known you your
[31:08] manifestation the word actually means to
[31:11] make known that God will make known his
[31:14] sons how does he make known his sons the
[31:18] mystery reveals the sunship amen no
[31:22] different than it was in Noah's day or
[31:24] Luther's day or any other day but this
[31:26] is the day of of the opening of The
[31:29] Seven Seals listen and unless you are
[31:31] under the election of God you will never
[31:34] see it you will never believe it you
[31:36] will never give your life to it but
[31:38] Satan would like to diminish that part
[31:40] of that and say oh anybody can believe
[31:42] it and anybody can see it who are you to
[31:44] be special let me tell you there are
[31:46] many kings that have longed to see this
[31:49] and we'll never see it there's been many
[31:50] rich men have long to hear the things
[31:53] what you hear oh they heard it but they
[31:55] didn't have an ear to hear it oh they
[31:58] saw it but they didn't see what you see
[32:00] in it many heard this message and threw
[32:02] it away as fanaticism or some kind of a
[32:05] lunatic but something in your dirt made
[32:08] you
[32:09] believe that your name was in the Lamb's
[32:12] Book of Life from before the foundation
[32:14] of the world and that Soul trumps my
[32:21] dirt there's a dominating
[32:25] Soul inside the dirt of this body
[32:28] am now I I'm standing here with with
[32:33] with with quote after
[32:35] quote listen the body is the Temple of
[32:40] Dynamics so we're waiting for the
[32:42] Dynamics to come not this bride brother
[32:45] B said the Easter message my Easter
[32:47] message to you is that the mechanics and
[32:50] the Dynamics are together the message
[32:54] brought the mechanics and the Dynamics
[32:56] together he joined god with his dirt
[33:01] bride it's called an invisible Union but
[33:04] it is a union made by the Holy Ghost and
[33:06] it brought the word which is Christ you
[33:10] are the hearer of the word and when
[33:12] something molded them two together it
[33:15] made a union between this dirt and that
[33:18] God and it brought Christ into his
[33:21] church amen that's why the prophet of
[33:24] God says your body becomes the Dynamics
[33:27] now I know it's dirt but let me say
[33:29] there's other people been born to the
[33:30] same dirt and when Jesus came where did
[33:34] his body come from it come from the dirt
[33:37] listen Jesus came of the same dirt you
[33:39] came out of that's right amen God
[33:43] bypassed the sexual act between man and
[33:45] woman but brother randam tells us that
[33:47] Mary's body produced that body of Jesus
[33:50] Amen and how did it happen because of
[33:52] the meal she ate come on she ate things
[33:55] that had dirt and potach and Ashes and
[33:58] vitamins of every kind and she ate and
[34:01] developed that body on the inside of her
[34:03] which was no more than what your mother
[34:05] did or any other mother did he had dirt
[34:09] the same as you got dirt come on church
[34:12] amen but when he came forth they
[34:15] announced over him Apostle Paul said he
[34:17] was the head of a new race he was the
[34:20] head of a new body brother B calls it a
[34:23] new race of people a God man amen yes
[34:27] sir
[34:28] Hallelujah come on we don't put up an
[34:30] idol you're the
[34:32] idol we don't have an image you're the
[34:36] image we don't have a masterpiece in the
[34:38] corner you're the
[34:41] Masterpiece come on now he remember but
[34:44] Michelangelo smoked his
[34:46] Masterpiece God smoked the Masterpiece
[34:48] of Jesus and brother said and so is it
[34:51] that this bride will be smitten out of
[34:54] the leodan age she will be smitten of
[34:57] God
[34:58] because she is his image and when she's
[35:01] smitten it's because she so matches the
[35:03] mind of God I don't have time to preach
[35:06] it to you let me just say it to you amen
[35:08] you so matched what he had in his mind
[35:10] he smoked you out of the age and called
[35:12] it a perfect bride and when Prophet
[35:14] stood there and said speak it was no
[35:17] different than Michelangelo saying to
[35:19] Moses speak he said speak because it was
[35:22] a perfect
[35:25] image Hallelujah come on Church
[35:28] let me announce it to you the way the
[35:29] prophet did the alpha has become the
[35:33] Omega you talk about the book of Acts
[35:35] bride I'm looking at a book of Acts
[35:38] bride you say I Got Dirt they had
[35:42] dirt come on Church there's more
[35:45] scriptures than Peter casting out Devils
[35:48] amen there's them of him
[35:50] running come on there's more scriptures
[35:53] than Paul standing there with a snake by
[35:55] you don't think about the swimming
[35:57] between between the the troubles and and
[35:59] laying on a piece of wood out in the
[36:00] middle without control amen not
[36:03] everything in their lives were
[36:05] Supernatural and Brilliant amen but we
[36:08] glorify the moments of their Brilliance
[36:10] in so that there was no other
[36:14] life we do it with brother brandom sure
[36:18] we do it with brother brandom sometimes
[36:19] we get to the place where we think that
[36:20] nobody was sick in brother bram's
[36:25] church that's the devil doing that to
[36:27] you
[36:28] there was a girl was in a wheelchair the
[36:30] entire time she was in brother bram's
[36:32] church that was a boy named Garnet Pete
[36:35] that died of the iron lung amen because
[36:37] he had trouble and brother Ram tells us
[36:39] he tells us that God he prayed for the
[36:41] boy and God left him in that condition
[36:44] brother R himself sick in his body you
[36:46] said preacher what are you talking about
[36:48] I'm trying to show you the devil has
[36:50] painted a picture that is not a real
[36:52] picture he's made you an angel and
[36:55] you're dirt you're dirt and God help us
[36:58] to remember we're just
[37:00] dirt oh but there's more dirt amen
[37:04] there's more than dirt there's more than
[37:06] dirt on the inside there's a soul
[37:08] there's a spirit on the inside and that
[37:11] come from God I didn't put it there I
[37:14] didn't buy it there but he put it in me
[37:17] and I say God Rule and Reign Over the
[37:19] dirt of this
[37:21] body hallelujah
[37:25] hallelujah my say uh oh I stopped
[37:30] time Joel chapter 2 the scripture tells
[37:34] us that God would pour out in the last
[37:37] days and it shall come to pass I'll pour
[37:40] my spirit upon all
[37:42] dirt come

[37:51] bodies dirt and your sons and daughters
[37:54] shall prophesy and your old men shall
[37:56] dream dreams and your m shall see
[37:57] visions and the Bible tells us upon all
[38:00] the flesh he would pour out his Spirit
[38:03] come on now if the dirty rotten
[38:06] Pentecostals could experience the glory
[38:09] and the power of the outpouring of
[38:11] anointings and truths and blessings upon
[38:14] them what about Sons true Sons you've
[38:18] let the dirt of your body block you from
[38:21] the blessings of what God really has for
[38:23] your life you've allowed the devil to
[38:25] talk you out of it to make you fearful
[38:28] of it to make you not realize really
[38:30] where you belong who you are and what
[38:32] you're here for I'll tell you this
[38:34] you're here this morning as a daughter
[38:36] of Abraham sister Leah you're here to

[38:42] dirt conquer the devil this morning and
[38:45] tell the
[38:46] devil come on Church put him on his face

[40:07] in these meetings for a purpose but
[40:10] we've got to recognize his
[40:12] presence now he recognizes his presence
[40:16] is when the promised word of the age is
[40:18] Manifest now he just told us that Joel I
[40:21] second chapter has been promised and we
[40:24] got it we know Malachi 4 is promised
[40:27] proed and we got it Revelations 10 is
[40:30] promised and we got it Luke 17:30 is
[40:34] promised and we got it Revelations 5 is
[40:38] promised and we got it come on the
[40:40] seventh angel of Revelations 3 is
[40:42] promised and we got it the rising of
[40:45] Isaiah 60 was promised and we got
[40:48] it you you I can stand here longer with
[40:51] scriptures amen Matthew 17 is pro we got
[40:54] it you see what it is there's a promise
[40:57] and we got it and that should make us
[40:59] recognize his
[41:02] presence now if we're only recognize his
[41:05] presence by the sensation on the dirt
[41:08] come
[41:09] on then oh when we wake up in the middle
[41:11] of the night or when we had a bad day or
[41:13] we hit our thumb with a hammer or or
[41:16] something falls off the car
[41:20] or then we're not recognizing his
[41:23] presence we're only recognizing a
[41:26] stimulation or emotion but let me
[41:28] promise you he's there right there when
[41:30] you smash your
[41:32] finger watch what you
[41:36] say he's right there it's just as real
[41:41] then as it is others times because
[41:44] what's it doing it's releasing the
[41:46] message releases something to you and
[41:48] brother B said when that woman come and
[41:50] wash his feet it released something to
[41:52] her and he said what was it she had
[41:53] recognized it and it released
[41:55] forgiveness to her
[41:58] it released that to her it released
[42:00] forgiveness this message can bring you
[42:02] forgi it can release justification to
[42:05] you listen it released the power of God
[42:08] to them see what it is it's released joy
[42:12] and power and eternal life when you see
[42:15] the scriptures of your age fulfilled it
[42:17] should release Joy when there is no
[42:20] source of
[42:22] Joy when everything is darkened and
[42:24] every problem is every direction but we
[42:27] still have joy because it was not
[42:29] released to me by a pay raise it was not
[42:32] released to me by a car I like a joy on
[42:35] a car it's a good feeling amen but but
[42:38] but it's not the place that can sustain
[42:40] you in the trials of your life it's got
[42:43] to come from the source of when the word
[42:46] of God is opened up to you and you say
[42:49] I'm living in the greatest of all the
[42:50] ages and God is pouring out his Spirit
[42:53] Among Us and though I don't feel it or
[42:55] though I feel it I know he's right here
[42:58] present in this building oh I tell you
[43:00] when you begin to focus your mind like
[43:02] that brother you better get ready for
[43:04] victory hall because you're focusing
[43:09] Out the Devil and you're focusing in God
[43:13] do you know things have been released to
[43:15] you that's been held since
[43:19] Adam brother bam tells us the Redemption
[43:21] of this book he said all legal
[43:23] possession of everything that was lost
[43:25] from Adam and Eve he said it ought to be
[43:28] do it what it ought to do to that born
[43:30] again Christian it's legal possession to
[43:33] the abstract title deed means they
[43:35] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[43:41] lost oh there's a witness in this
[43:43] building this morning that that's the
[43:48] truth that you possess everything I I
[43:51] don't have time to preach in this area
[43:53] but but it's a it's a direct statement
[43:56] see now we didn't see that until that
[43:59] third pull came to us when the prophet
[44:02] stood there and received that sword in
[44:04] his hand he said it was the word in the
[44:08] hand of a prophet but thank God he
[44:11] released that to the church he released
[44:15] that to the bride he ministered that now
[44:18] and then comes to us and says that
[44:21] you're more than able to do that can we
[44:24] can we just read a a scripture
[44:25] concerning you
[44:27] brother man says we are right now
[44:29] spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a
[44:30] spiritual
[44:32] Kingdom you believe that see in Romans
[44:35] 5:17 I'll give you the scripture by one
[44:37] man's death re death Reign by one how
[44:41] much more shall we receive abundance of
[44:43] grace and the gift of righteousness
[44:44] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[44:47] so we should reign in this life now
[44:49] brother bam uses this and he says right
[44:52] now somebody say right now right now
[44:56] right now we reign with
[44:59] Christ having
[45:03] Dominion look what what you says your
[45:05] dominion over sin somebody say sin sin
[45:08] the world the World the Flesh FLH and
[45:12] the devil so let's look again over sin
[45:16] over the world world over the
[45:18] dirtt over the devil over you are in
[45:22] Dominion right
[45:25] now with your problem you're still in
[45:28] Dominion you are anointed Sons and
[45:31] Daughters of God with your issues with
[45:34] the strains with the problems with the
[45:36] complexes with the come on church it's
[45:39] the truth anyhow you are still sons and
[45:42] and you know I I think of this now I
[45:43] could preach a whole service on the
[45:45] anointed bride y'all heard it amen not
[45:47] the anointed man the anointed people
[45:49] right anointed how many knows you're
[45:51] anointed already am just as Samuel
[45:55] poured oil over David a prophet poured
[45:58] the message over your life and Jesus
[46:01] said my words are spirit and life he
[46:04] took the seven sealed book and anointed
[46:07] you as the last day member of the bride
[46:10] of Christ and we stand this morning
[46:14] anointed just like David was anointed
[46:18] but I guarantee you he went right back
[46:19] to the field and wasn't not much changed
[46:22] because David didn't have much change
[46:24] after the anointing come and he might
[46:25] have wondered about some of those things
[46:27] I remember years ago preaching on am man
[46:29] a king in the wilderness and I was it
[46:32] would just to Mesmerize me that there
[46:33] was an anointed man running from armies
[46:36] that was an anointed man he was anointed
[46:38] it was marked it was true but he was
[46:40] hungry anyhow he was a king but he was
[46:43] wet and dejected amen he was a king but
[46:46] look at where he went and what he did
[46:48] and when he got put on the throne in
[46:50] Jerusalem he was just as much King in
[46:52] the cave as he was on the throne and one
[46:55] of these days you'll say on the throne I
[46:57] know you're going to the throne but
[46:59] you're just as much a king this morning
[47:02] as you will be one day when you set upon
[47:05] the throne of God already
[47:08] anointed and that's what the devil hates
[47:12] that's really what Satan hates because
[47:15] what he's trying to do is he's trying to
[47:17] use these things to
[47:19] stop now if you watch the scriptures
[47:22] brother bam says he says it like this in
[47:24] Israel and the church he said all h
[47:27] can't stop
[47:28] it because it's ordained of Jesus Christ
[47:32] and it will be Upon This Rock I'll build
[47:34] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[47:35] not Prevail what is it what kind of
[47:38] church see Flesh and Blood amen had not
[47:41] revealed that to him but my Father which
[47:42] is in heaven is revealed that spiritual
[47:45] Revelation by the Holy Ghost of the word
[47:47] of God and on this rock I'll build my
[47:49] church and the gates of hell can't
[47:52] Prevail against it she's moving onen
[47:57] now watch brother B is telling us there
[47:59] won't be no stopping this this is moving
[48:02] anyhow Amen in questions and answers
[48:04] brother bam said listen you people
[48:06] thinking that that can stop it you could
[48:08] stop the sun quicker you ain't going to
[48:11] stop it because it's ordained to move
[48:14] on oh thus sayith the Lord y'all know
[48:17] the scriptures amen you know the
[48:19] prophet's prophecies thus sayith the
[48:21] Lord the move is on for the bride you
[48:24] could stop that son quicker then you can
[48:27] stop this dirt in this building this
[48:30] morning ah I tell you the move is on I
[48:33] love how brother bam says it he says
[48:34] there's nothing can stand in the way of
[48:36] a saint going to meet a promise of God
[48:39] death can't stop it the Grave can't stop
[48:41] it the devil can't stop it because we
[48:43] are more than conquerors that's what
[48:46] brother man talks about when he sees the
[48:48] vision Beyond uh out there in Finland
[48:50] sees that little boy raising up out of
[48:52] the off the side of the road I know
[48:54] there's people don't believe that out
[48:56] there but I'm sorry it's for the
[48:59] Believers and brother bam tells it and
[49:01] and and he's talking about it he says
[49:02] and when I
[49:04] recognized where I was at now now now
[49:07] folks you you can take a long time on
[49:09] this story but let's just make a point
[49:10] brother bandam put that in the fly leaf
[49:12] of his Bible years before it happened
[49:16] and his memory had got a little fuzzy
[49:18] because of all the meetings he was in
[49:20] and he was in a strange country and he
[49:22] runs up on a wreck and he says
[49:24] somebody's coming and said brother
[49:25] bradam you need to come and look at this
[49:26] and he said and it made me a bit sick he
[49:28] said I have a child about that age at
[49:30] home and he said I I just couldn't
[49:32] hardly even look at it he said so I
[49:34] decided I would turn and walk away and
[49:36] go back get in the car listen you see he
[49:39] wasn't feeling super
[49:42] spiritual he wasn't feeling like let me
[49:44] at it I I I you know I'm going to fix
[49:46] this problem he said I'm going to go
[49:47] back to the car and something laid its
[49:50] hand on me and he said and I turned and
[49:52] looked and he said oh my goodness wait a
[49:54] minute there's the rocks and there's the
[49:56] tree and there's the car and there's the
[50:00] boy you see what he done he recognized
[50:03] the presence of God manifesting a vision
[50:07] that was above the dirt of the man
[50:10] William brandom something was about to
[50:12] happen and brother R said all I had to
[50:14] do now was just play my part that's all
[50:17] I had to do he said all hell never
[50:19] stopped that boy from raising up and he
[50:21] spoke and said in the name of Jesus and
[50:23] the boy had to stand up I tell you
[50:25] brother amen when you see you're in the
[50:28] midst of the fulfillments of scripture
[50:30] it doesn't matter the condition you find
[50:32] yourself in it don't matter if you find
[50:35] yourself spiritual or super spiritual it
[50:37] matters can you see the unfolding of the
[50:40] word and you're place in that
[50:46] word now nothing's going to stop it not
[50:48] even
[50:49] death remember Jesus going to J's
[50:52] daughter remember what they said don't
[50:54] trouble the master she she's already
[50:57] died it didn't stop him he said I'll
[51:00] just go wake her because he'd already
[51:03] promised he would go Waker listen
[51:06] mountains cannot stop you Seas cannot
[51:10] stop you look where God told Moses you
[51:12] go get my people and come back on this
[51:14] mountain and worship me and a red sea
[51:16] got in the
[51:18] way but it didn't stop them because God
[51:22] said you go get them and come back here
[51:25] I know discouragement must have rose up
[51:27] when they was looking at that sea but
[51:29] don't forget there's a promise don't
[51:32] forget that God LED them there and
[51:34] whenever God leads you to a place where
[51:37] it seems there is no way there's no
[51:40] possibilities that's when God makes a
[51:42] way because he's a supernatural god with
[51:45] Supernatural characteristics and we are
[51:47] a supernatural seed that belongs to
[51:51] him he said you're going to be there
[51:53] you're going to be there don't let a
[51:55] trial stop you
[51:58] come on Abraham 25 years waiting on a
[52:00] child you'd have thought that been
[52:02] enough but while he's got a young 14year
[52:05] old boy God says to him take him up on
[52:07] the mountain that never stopped Abraham
[52:11] he never stopped and threw down the
[52:12] thing said well I just can't serve God
[52:14] no more cuz I certainly can't understand
[52:16] this but when God required it it was an
[52:19] Unstoppable thing in Abraham's heart if
[52:21] the boy dies God will raise him up again
[52:25] I received him from the dead and God can
[52:28] bring him back from the dead don't you
[52:31] understand this morning that there's a
[52:32] God who Reigns over the situations of
[52:35] our lives and the devil can't do nothing
[52:38] to you until first he checks it with our
[52:42] God and if God let him do it it means
[52:45] you are more than able to overcome the
[52:49] situation well I feel like speaking in
[52:51] tongues you got a reason this morning
[52:54] because God if he let it happen brother
[52:57] Aaron he's God enough to protect you in
[52:59] the middle of
[53:00] it he just wants to see what you're
[53:03] going to do about
[53:08] it Hallelujah I wish I by myself for a
[53:14] minute somebody said well brother Wayne
[53:16] you ain't running the trials I run into
[53:18] you might not have run into mine yet
[53:22] either let me say this if a preacher
[53:24] tells you
[53:27] that this is a fly bed of ease brother
[53:28] bam said this he said either he's
[53:31] deceiving you or he's or he's not a
[53:35] Christian he's never had the experience
[53:38] if somebody tells you Christianity means
[53:40] everything's going to be okay they've
[53:42] lied to
[53:43] you they deceived you amen because it
[53:47] ain't going to be okay amen man there's
[53:49] going to be trials and there's going to
[53:50] be troubles amen it's not a fiery bed of
[53:53] ease and I'll just put it out there it's
[53:55] not going to be amen but there's a God
[53:57] on the other side of the
[54:00] [Music]
[54:02] trial I love how brother BR says that he
[54:04] said when when we come to these trials
[54:07] now I've just spent a lot of time
[54:08] teaching on the deity in the
[54:12] dirt dirt is to be
[54:16] tried to see what's on the inside of it
[54:20] why do we come to these troubles what
[54:22] makes these things come why would a
[54:23] Christian ever be perplexed
[54:26] why wouldn't everything run perfect for
[54:28] a
[54:29] Christian why wouldn't it just run
[54:31] perfect brother bam says this he said
[54:34] even sometimes we have more troubles
[54:36] when we become a Christian than we did
[54:39] when we were
[54:40] Sinners because it is written many is
[54:44] the afflictions of the
[54:46] righteous oh but I like the rest of that
[54:48] scripture but God
[54:58] strange feelings and strange things
[55:01] would that would be beyond our
[55:03] understanding it's always done for our
[55:05] good just can't understand it but it's
[55:08] for our good can't understand it see
[55:11] it's got to be Faith he says not
[55:14] sometimes understanding but what do we
[55:15] got to have we got to believe his word
[55:18] that it's going to work somehow it's
[55:19] going to work for our good if we could
[55:21] just grasp that today with all of our
[55:24] troubles and the the none of us are
[55:26] immune from them if we would realize
[55:29] that these things are for our
[55:31] good oh God I wished it hadn't been put
[55:35] in there but it
[55:38] is Psalms 34:19 reads it reads perfectly
[55:43] many are the afflictions of the
[55:45] righteous but the Lord Deliver us out of
[55:48] them all Paul says it in 2 Timothy 3
[55:51] persecutions afflictions which come unto
[55:54] me at Antioch amen and econom and leria
[55:58] what persecutions I endured but out of
[56:01] them all the Lord delivered me yay and
[56:05] all that will live Godly in Christ shall
[56:09] suffer
[56:11] persecutions now I'm I'm I'm I'm
[56:13] preaching the Bible to you for a moment
[56:15] to M Timothy and the minister of God
[56:18] from Thessalonians he said our fellow
[56:19] labor in the gospel to establish you and
[56:22] to comfort you concerning your faith
[56:25] that no man should be moved by these
[56:28] afflictions for yourselves know that you
[56:30] are appointed there unto you know
[56:33] afflictions are appointed under
[56:36] Christians come on wake yourself up you
[56:39] know when you come to be a Christian
[56:41] afflictions you have appointed yourself
[56:44] to get in the line of
[56:49] persecutions amen for verily I say we
[56:52] told you that you would suffer
[56:54] tribulations even as it has come come to
[56:57] pass Timothy go preach go preach the
[57:00] gospel but you're going to
[57:03] suffer you know it's appointed unto him
[57:05] Peter says it like this wherein you
[57:07] greatly Rejoice though for a reason you
[57:09] need be you are in Heavenly you are in
[57:12] heaviness through manifold
[57:15] temptations that the trial of your faith
[57:18] be more precious than gold that
[57:20] perisheth though it be tried in a fire
[57:22] it might be found and praise and honor
[57:24] and Glory at the pering of Christ
[57:27] in Isaiah chapter 48 he says it this way
[57:29] in the 10th verse behold I have refined
[57:32] thee but not with silver I have chosen
[57:34] thee in the furnace of
[57:39] Affliction In the Heat of your trial
[57:42] that's the way God decided he was going
[57:44] to purge this
[57:47] dirt Amen in according to scripture in
[57:50] Isaiah 1:25 I will turn my hand upon
[57:53] thee and purely Purge away thy drug
[57:56] cross and take away all thy 10 in job 23
[58:00] and10 he said he knoweth the way that I
[58:02] take I love that song Amen God bless you
[58:06] amen your choir sings that sometimes wow
[58:08] what a song He knoweth the way that I
[58:10] take and when he tried me I shall come
[58:14] forth
[58:19] as I don't know if I ever told some of
[58:22] you this story but I I was going to make
[58:24] gold one time
[58:26] that stuff's worth a lot of
[58:28] money I didn't know it was illegal to
[58:31] manufacture gold
[58:33] but but I was Googling like crazy what's
[58:37] the recipes for this stuff you know it's
[58:39] a couple thousand bucks an ounce you
[58:41] know I mean if you just could make three
[58:42] O A Day You' do pretty good you
[58:44] know I was trying to figure it out and
[58:47] in that study I discovered something I
[58:49] didn't know uh and I think they just
[58:51] discovered it in the recent years that
[58:52] gold actually comes from the stars that
[58:55] it's not original uh from the earth that
[58:58] it was in the stars and when the stars
[59:00] die they crushed the fallen stars
[59:01] crushed in the ground and gold deposits
[59:04] fell in and then through the years of
[59:06] evolution and wind and Distortion they
[59:09] get mixed into the Earth and then quartz
[59:11] and tin and and all kinds of pirates and
[59:14] and all of it gets in there and it gets
[59:16] mixed around and if you can see then
[59:19] that sometimes dirt is very valuable
[59:23] yeah that's why when they sell dirt a
[59:25] lot of times they want to know do you
[59:26] want the water rights do you want the
[59:29] the the the gym rights or amen because
[59:31] the oil rights the gas rights because
[59:33] owning the piece of property is not
[59:35] always just about the
[59:37] dirt it's about what's in the
[59:40] dirt and we found out some of you amen
[59:43] were born and it's just dirt like any
[59:46] other dirt but there are deposits of
[59:49] deity that is laying in that dirt and it
[59:52] got mingled up with law and traditions
[59:54] and it got mingled up with church
[59:56] traditions and it it got mingled
[59:58] up none of y'all probably have any of
[1:00:01] that it got mixed up with calling
[1:00:02] traditions and amen it got mixed up with
[1:00:05] pain traditions and amen and situations
[1:00:07] and amen even even some English got
[1:00:10] mixed in some of this deity amen but you
[1:00:12] see what the dirt has deity in it but
[1:00:15] God has got to purify the deity part of
[1:00:18] the dirt amen you you see God ain't
[1:00:21] throwing away the dirt he's just
[1:00:23] purifying his part of that dirt
[1:00:26] Hallelujah and sometimes Amen brother
[1:00:28] Bram says it's just like too much
[1:00:30] brandom in me it's too much Lawson in me
[1:00:33] he said listen my greatest enemy is
[1:00:35] William brandom and he was a prophet of
[1:00:38] God come on church we than our greatest
[1:00:41] enem is the guy down the street or the
[1:00:43] person in the Pew next to us or maybe
[1:00:45] our wife or our family or some some some
[1:00:48] hater that's hating on us and we think
[1:00:50] oh that's our enemy no it's not our
[1:00:52] enemy our greatest enemy is ourselves
[1:00:55] it's how we car oursel how we think
[1:00:57] about things how we look upon things
[1:00:59] amen and when God gets a hold of a man
[1:01:02] he begins to put him in a place that he
[1:01:04] can take out the human part and take out
[1:01:07] the the places of imperfection that he
[1:01:10] might
[1:01:13] purify and bring us to a part that he
[1:01:16] could use us now now I know amen some of
[1:01:20] us reaches places and and and there's
[1:01:22] lots of questions and I thank God
[1:01:25] there's answers
[1:01:27] I thank God there's answers and you're a
[1:01:29] Bible reader in Revelation Chapter 2 in
[1:01:31] the Smur age in the 10th verse you'll
[1:01:33] watch this Jesus says to them fear none
[1:01:35] of these things which Thou shalt
[1:01:38] suffer fear none of these things which
[1:01:40] thou shallal suffer I think that's good
[1:01:42] for us today amen fear none of these
[1:01:44] things which you should suffer because
[1:01:46] tribulation was a part of those First
[1:01:48] Ages and brother bam tells us this but
[1:01:51] Paul applied this to the mass of
[1:01:53] Christians in the book of Hebrews in the
[1:01:55] 10th chapter when he said I call to
[1:01:57] remembrance the former days after you
[1:01:59] illuminated you endured a great fight of
[1:02:03] afflictions now now look at this it this
[1:02:07] this isn't something amen that just
[1:02:09] comes on one
[1:02:11] individual this isn't just something
[1:02:12] that hits one family or one church amen
[1:02:16] it hits all churches it hits all human
[1:02:20] beings but when it comes upon the dirt
[1:02:24] that has deity in it
[1:02:27] then it's there for a
[1:02:28] purpose see the thing is is if we're if
[1:02:31] we're not
[1:02:33] Christians then we're suffering without
[1:02:35] reason right am me let me just say this
[1:02:39] brother R says it like this in the Samar
[1:02:41] Church age it's one of the great
[1:02:42] readings if you've never read it this
[1:02:44] this this is Landmark to you as a
[1:02:46] Believer now the Lord all God Almighty
[1:02:48] says I know that he's walking in the
[1:02:50] midst of the people and he's the chief
[1:02:51] Shepherd of the flock but does he hold
[1:02:54] back the persecution
[1:02:57] history says he didn't does he hold the
[1:02:59] stem of the tribulation no he does not
[1:03:04] he simply says I know your
[1:03:07] tribulation oh my goodness I am not
[1:03:11] unmindful of your
[1:03:13] suffering but what a stumbling block
[1:03:15] that is to so many people like Israel
[1:03:18] they wondered if God really loves them
[1:03:20] and how could he be just and loving if
[1:03:23] he would stand and watch his people
[1:03:25] suffer how many times have you heard
[1:03:27] people say that very thing how could it
[1:03:30] be just and loving God that would watch
[1:03:33] somebody suffer in Malachi 1 verse 1:3
[1:03:36] for the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:03:37] was upon Malachi I have loved you saith
[1:03:40] the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou
[1:03:43] loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother
[1:03:46] sayith the Lord I love Jacob and I hated
[1:03:49] Esau and I laid mountains and Heritage
[1:03:52] waste for the dragons of the Wilderness
[1:03:54] you see they could not figure out God's
[1:03:56] love see they thought that love meant no
[1:04:02] suffering listen I tell you what if
[1:04:05] there ever was an age that had
[1:04:06] misrepresented God's love it's the age
[1:04:08] we're living in they have so mingled
[1:04:12] that up to make God of Ven and the devil
[1:04:15] somehow he's the hero amen but that
[1:04:18] God's never meant love was not suffering
[1:04:22] he said they thought it meant like a
[1:04:24] baby with parental care but God said
[1:04:27] that he loves us and it was an elect of
[1:04:31] Love well amen somebody clear the aisle
[1:04:35] it's elective love you know that's why
[1:04:37] some people won't read this church age
[1:04:39] book right there that very statement
[1:04:41] because it's elective love amen I I
[1:04:44] believe in election and I believe it's
[1:04:46] an elective love and the proof of this
[1:04:48] love is election he love is elective and
[1:04:52] the proof of it is his election his love
[1:04:55] was proven truly by the fact that we
[1:04:57] were chosen under salvation because if
[1:04:59] God ha given us salvation through
[1:05:01] sanctification of his spirit and belief
[1:05:03] in the truth he may commit you to death
[1:05:06] as he did
[1:05:07] Paul now think about Paul that great
[1:05:10] Apostle but look at the death he died he
[1:05:13] may conf commit you to suffering as he
[1:05:15] did to job that is his prerogative he is
[1:05:18] Sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[1:05:21] he if he didn't have a purpose then he
[1:05:24] would be the author of frustration
[1:05:26] and not of Peace his purpose amen that
[1:05:29] after we have suffered a while we would
[1:05:31] be made perfect and established and
[1:05:33] strengthened and settled we have taught
[1:05:35] this generation everything but how to
[1:05:39] suffer come on church amen we have
[1:05:42] taught everything but how to suffer how
[1:05:45] to meet the suffering of the age we're
[1:05:47] living in God put you in the most evil
[1:05:51] Dark Age that's ever been in but he put
[1:05:54] something on the inside of you
[1:05:56] a supreme Grace for a supreme hour to be
[1:05:59] standing in the middle of these trials I
[1:06:01] know somebody said well brother Wayne
[1:06:03] I've had to suffer listen let me tell
[1:06:04] you this I I'll tell you there's going
[1:06:06] to be suffering amen and we've got to
[1:06:08] learn how to face it and how to meet it
[1:06:11] and not fall apart at it and say oh God
[1:06:14] I must not be a Christian I I must have
[1:06:16] wronged him somewhere there something in
[1:06:18] my past or something in there but you
[1:06:20] know what's amazing I've never noticed I
[1:06:22] I don't know if you've ever noticed this
[1:06:23] amen but sometimes it's way up in a
[1:06:25] person 's life and they're trying to
[1:06:27] look all the way back through there to
[1:06:28] find little something but in all of that
[1:06:31] they never see where the Holy Ghost gave
[1:06:33] them New Birth where God forgave them he
[1:06:35] was healings went on this happened this
[1:06:37] happened this happened do you think God
[1:06:40] could have got you this far if there
[1:06:42] been some kind of big impediment back
[1:06:44] there in your first part of your birth
[1:06:46] it's the devil lying to you to try to
[1:06:49] undermine you in the time of your trial
[1:06:52] I tell you this it's time to stand up
[1:06:54] and face the devil and say if I'm going
[1:06:57] through a trial it's because God has
[1:07:00] deemed me worthy to suffer for his name
[1:07:03] and I will praise him in the middle of
[1:07:06] my
[1:07:07] trial the sun could have praised even
[1:07:10] the trees could have praised him and the
[1:07:12] Stars could have praised him but he
[1:07:14] wanted your praise and he wanted your
[1:07:16] praise in the face of your trial and in
[1:07:18] the face of your
[1:07:21] problem I'm sorry I feel like preaching
[1:07:24] I tell you we have got a sit situation
[1:07:26] in this age where there are minifold
[1:07:28] proes there there are there are manifold
[1:07:30] things there are there are sufferings in
[1:07:32] every which direction but there is an
[1:07:34] eternal purpose of
[1:07:38] God Ephesians 1:8 said Heath abounded
[1:07:40] toward us all wisdom and Prudence that's
[1:07:43] a lot of wisdom
[1:07:47] folks if somebody took all their
[1:07:52] wisdom we're talking about the all-wise
[1:07:55] God
[1:07:56] hath abounded toward us he has put forth
[1:08:00] all his wisdom toward
[1:08:03] us then that trial you're going through
[1:08:06] is not there to destroy you because you
[1:08:08] are God's purpose in this age but he's
[1:08:11] after More Than Dirt he's after more
[1:08:14] than that he's after the deposit of the
[1:08:17] deity that's in your life to make it
[1:08:19] shine like pure gold I tell you I never
[1:08:22] was early in my life when I studied
[1:08:24] brother random some of the stories he
[1:08:26] told I I didn't understand like when he
[1:08:29] talked about them coming back there and
[1:08:30] seeing bethoven or mzark and he had a
[1:08:33] waste can full of papers and somebody
[1:08:35] said they picked one of them up and was
[1:08:37] reading them they said what' you throw
[1:08:38] these away for these are wonderful songs
[1:08:40] and they and and I believe it was PA HOV
[1:08:42] he looked back at him he said because
[1:08:44] I'm not after a song I'm after a
[1:08:46] masterpiece amen and the waste baskets
[1:08:49] are full of church joiners amen but he's
[1:08:52] not after a church Joiner he's after a
[1:08:54] son or a daughter that can stand the
[1:08:57] tribulations and the trials of the age
[1:09:00] we're living in oh we might suffer a
[1:09:02] little while but after the suffering is
[1:09:04] over it will not be compared with the
[1:09:07] glory that will be revealed in this
[1:09:10] bride it's just dirt but there's deity
[1:09:13] in this
[1:09:18] dirt
[1:09:20] oh in Romans 8 who could have wrote it
[1:09:23] better than Paul all things work
[1:09:26] together somebody say
[1:09:28] all
[1:09:32] except all that's a very inclusive word
[1:09:37] all
[1:09:38] things it don't say all things are
[1:09:42] good but all things work for the good in
[1:09:46] other words if God be for you who can be
[1:09:49] against you cuz whatever the devil does
[1:09:51] to mean it to your heart God turns it
[1:09:54] and refines you into a son and makes
[1:09:57] these parts of your life and brings
[1:09:59] passion into you I love how brother bam
[1:10:01] says that God harnesses
[1:10:03] trouble he puts a bit in its mouth and
[1:10:06] makes it obeying troubles bring you
[1:10:09] closer to fellowship with
[1:10:13] God as long as I live I'll never forget
[1:10:16] a prophet talking about his cross-eyed
[1:10:18] little girl laying there and when I
[1:10:20] become a father I thought about it I
[1:10:22] thought about a daughter amen because of
[1:10:24] his own personal choices and his wife
[1:10:27] and the the the reluctance to follow the
[1:10:30] will of God Amen they look at the mess
[1:10:32] they got into and he's standing there
[1:10:35] knowing if I'd have just followed
[1:10:38] God yes sir and that that cross-eyed
[1:10:41] girl brother man said years later he
[1:10:43] would stand on the platform and brother
[1:10:45] John when a crosseyed child would come
[1:10:47] in front of him he would all cross their
[1:10:49] rise somebody say who done that he said
[1:10:51] I did it but there was such passion in
[1:10:54] that man had suffered so that his faith
[1:10:57] was a a place that he could make eyes
[1:10:59] come un
[1:11:02] cross oh God give us passion this
[1:11:05] morning not just a church joining not
[1:11:08] just a coming to church give us passion
[1:11:10] passion to serve God passion to see the
[1:11:13] mercies of God see it com to life see
[1:11:16] fathers and mothers and Children and
[1:11:18] Families framed in the power work of
[1:11:21] almighty God passion for it amen
[1:11:26] troubles yeah they bring us
[1:11:29] closer brother ma says it he said he put
[1:11:32] strength in us and you see job himself
[1:11:34] learn Jesus learned amen The Obedience
[1:11:37] by the things that he suffered brother
[1:11:39] bam says it like this I love how how
[1:11:41] brother Braham defines things and though
[1:11:43] he was a son yet he suffered
[1:11:47] Jesus and very plain language the very
[1:11:51] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:11:53] suffering and Paul has left his church a
[1:11:55] measure of suffering that they too by
[1:11:57] their faith in God or suffering for him
[1:12:01] would come to a place of
[1:12:03] perfection therefore in James my
[1:12:05] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[1:12:08] into diver
[1:12:11] Temptations who would have ever thought
[1:12:13] that Temptations would be part of your
[1:12:18] suffering so brother Wayne I'm saved I
[1:12:20] know you are you received God but
[1:12:23] Temptations
[1:12:25] sometimes you suffer with
[1:12:28] Temptations you got to ask yourself why
[1:12:31] does God stand by have you ever asked
[1:12:33] that you ever as a Christian say God how
[1:12:36] are you how are you allowing this how is
[1:12:39] this
[1:12:40] happening and brother B says why does he
[1:12:42] do it the reason is written in Romans 8
[1:12:47] verse 17 and 18 if you if you're a Bible
[1:12:49] stud Romans 8 verse 17-18 you're going
[1:12:52] through something you're asking God why
[1:12:53] there's the answer amen he said if your
[1:12:56] children then HS and HS of God and join
[1:12:58] HS with Christ if be that you suffer
[1:13:02] with
[1:13:03] him we must also be glorified together
[1:13:06] for I reckon the sufferings of this
[1:13:07] present time are not worthy to be
[1:13:09] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:13:11] revealed in US unless we
[1:13:15] suffer we cannot reign with
[1:13:20] him you have to suffer the reason for
[1:13:23] this character simp simply is not made
[1:13:26] without
[1:13:28] suffering you see somebody's life and
[1:13:31] you say oh what a rich Christian what a
[1:13:34] what a rich spirit in that man there's
[1:13:36] suffering behind
[1:13:39] that brother Ray ain't here this morning
[1:13:42] but ain't person in here ain't never
[1:13:43] shook hands with Brother Ray and think
[1:13:44] my what a rich Spirit there's suffering
[1:13:47] behind that there's prayer behind that
[1:13:51] it that that's not handed out like
[1:13:53] tokens right
[1:13:56] amen yes sir it's
[1:13:58] molded brother Ram says it character
[1:14:02] simply is not made without
[1:14:05] suffering character is Victory it's not
[1:14:08] a gift a man without character cannot
[1:14:11] reain because power apart from character
[1:14:13] is satanic but Power with character is
[1:14:16] fit to rule and since he wants to share
[1:14:18] his throne with us on the same basis he
[1:14:22] overcome and sit down in his father's
[1:14:24] Throne we have to overcame to sit down
[1:14:26] with him and these temporary sufferings
[1:14:28] we go through is not even
[1:14:31] worthy to be compared with the
[1:14:35] glory in Revelations 20 it's written of
[1:14:37] you that you will set on Thrones when
[1:14:39] Paul speaks of our Affliction he said
[1:14:41] it's a light Affliction but for a
[1:14:44] moment and when Peter speaks of it he
[1:14:46] said don't think it strange now that's
[1:14:48] that's the point isn't it amen don't
[1:14:51] think it
[1:14:53] strange don't think it strange that
[1:14:55] suffering is coming cuz that's where it
[1:14:58] becomes so powerful is the way you think
[1:15:01] about it I if I had time to preach to
[1:15:04] you this morning on The Interpreter
[1:15:06] Satan and how when he attacked Eve she
[1:15:08] had the word of God and he destroyed all
[1:15:11] of her peace and all of her joy and
[1:15:13] ripped her out of a perfect atmosphere
[1:15:16] because he made her think a certain way
[1:15:20] and the moment suffering comes in your
[1:15:22] life you can suffer and you can have
[1:15:24] infirmities and you can face them with
[1:15:26] glory and thankfulness and you can face
[1:15:28] them with joy amen or you can allow
[1:15:31] Satan to get a hold of that and you can
[1:15:33] start thinking that something's wrong
[1:15:35] and something's troubl and it's this is
[1:15:36] a repution and this is a reaping of and
[1:15:39] this is this and after a little
[1:15:42] while he's got you so
[1:15:48] embattled because you let him interpret
[1:15:51] to
[1:15:52] you think of it then you got to arm
[1:15:58] yourself in Matthew
[1:16:00] 16 it's a beautiful picture of Jesus and
[1:16:04] Peter and when Peter and Jesus are
[1:16:06] talking I love how he starts the
[1:16:08] conversation because who do you say I am
[1:16:13] I love how he made that clear remember
[1:16:14] because he said well some say but he
[1:16:16] didn't leave it there he changed the
[1:16:18] level and said who do you say and when
[1:16:21] Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ
[1:16:24] the son of the Living God God he got the
[1:16:26] clarity that Peter knew who he
[1:16:30] was and then he tells us this amen that
[1:16:33] he was going to build the church upon
[1:16:35] that confession and then from there told
[1:16:38] Peter I'm going to go to Jerusalem and
[1:16:41] suffer and that is exactly when Peter
[1:16:44] got all upset and said Lord we're not
[1:16:47] going to let you go suffer yeah far be
[1:16:50] it that it could happen you are deity
[1:16:53] you're the son of God you got Christ in
[1:16:56] you you can't go down there and suffer
[1:16:58] like you're IM mortal man like you're
[1:17:01] just dirt you can't go to the Cross like
[1:17:03] a thief you can't suffer and Jesus said
[1:17:06] get behind me
[1:17:08] devil and the moment that something
[1:17:11] tells you that Christians can't suffer
[1:17:14] you say get behind me devil you get
[1:17:17] behind me my Lord suffered on a cross
[1:17:20] Paul had his head chopped off amen John
[1:17:22] was bold and all the disciples dead they
[1:17:25] died every one of them deaths you said
[1:17:27] preacher what are you talking about I'm
[1:17:29] talking about something greater amen
[1:17:31] something greater than this life we have
[1:17:33] got so focused on this life and Easy
[1:17:35] Living and all the things that are
[1:17:37] happening in this age there are things
[1:17:39] that are Beyond this real there is a
[1:17:41] reality Above This reality this dirt is
[1:17:45] here I know and they're suffering but
[1:17:47] it's just for a moment but on the other
[1:17:52] side there is an immortal body there are
[1:17:56] Thrones there is a rain with him listen
[1:18:01] this morning when we come to this
[1:18:03] word brother Bram said it very clearly
[1:18:06] he said there never would have been a
[1:18:07] crown without a cross there never would
[1:18:09] have been a rainbow without a
[1:18:12] flood job could have never stood up and
[1:18:15] said I know my redeemer liveth unless he
[1:18:18] would have first set it from an ash Heap
[1:18:20] amen he said the Hebrew children could
[1:18:22] have never seen the Son of God until
[1:18:24] they got in the
[1:18:25] Fire come on church amen they never saw
[1:18:29] him until they got in the fire but when
[1:18:31] they went in pound they come out loosed
[1:18:34] and brother B said there you are that's
[1:18:36] all the trial will ever do to you it'll
[1:18:38] loose you from the bonds amen when they
[1:18:42] come out they didn't even smell like
[1:18:45] smoke I think that must have been an
[1:18:47] awesome morning amen when they walked by
[1:18:49] and said look hey man only thing y'all
[1:18:51] did to us is free us
[1:18:55] and I tell you what if you ever really
[1:18:56] suffer you ever really go through a
[1:18:58] trial and you really get in contact with
[1:19:00] God the only thing that'll ever do to
[1:19:02] you is free you to say I know my
[1:19:04] redeemer liveth and though the skin
[1:19:06] worms eat this B flesh in my body I
[1:19:08] shall see God brother bam said it I love
[1:19:11] how he says it brother Dallas he says he
[1:19:13] said Abraham saw Elohim he says he said
[1:19:16] oh he said the Hebrew children saw the
[1:19:17] Son of God he said all of them saw
[1:19:20] manifestations and things but job saw

[1:20:39] pass out you ask me a question there in

[1:20:43] remember last Sunday we ended with a
[1:20:45] song Brother David come up and sang a
[1:20:46] song
[1:20:49] Grace now you you you see watch how the
[1:20:51] Holy Spirit was so work
[1:20:57] Paul said this he Saidi went to the Lord
[1:21:00] and besought him three
[1:21:02] times that this would depart me and he
[1:21:06] said to me my grace is sufficient for
[1:21:09] thee and my strength is made perfect
[1:21:12] most gladly therefore will I
[1:21:15] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:21:18] of Christ might rest upon me somebody
[1:21:21] says what does that mean Satan buffeted
[1:21:23] Paul brother B said here's what it was
[1:21:25] he said he prayed that God would heal
[1:21:28] him on three different
[1:21:31] occasions and Satan was buffeting him
[1:21:34] and brother Bram said he was hitting him
[1:21:37] blow after
[1:21:39] blow after
[1:21:40] blow and Paul was crying unto the Lord
[1:21:44] Lord I know you're a
[1:21:47] Healer but if you watch this this is in
[1:21:50] the moment of when Paul went beyond the
[1:21:52] curtain of time
[1:21:54] and he says unless I be exalted above
[1:21:58] measure God has allowed the devil to
[1:22:01] Buffet me to keep me
[1:22:07] humble blow after blow God's answer to
[1:22:12] Paul is my
[1:22:16] grace you said preacher what are you
[1:22:18] doing I I want to show you something
[1:22:19] what brother Bram said he said he didn't
[1:22:22] promise a flowy bed of ease he promised
[1:22:25] Grace sufficient to get through
[1:22:28] it he didn't promise you a life without
[1:22:30] Temptation he promised you Grace to get
[1:22:33] through it somebody told Brother
[1:22:35] brandham they said brother brandham said
[1:22:37] Do You Believe In Divine Healing he said
[1:22:38] I do he said then why does people still
[1:22:40] have pain he said well do you believe in
[1:22:43] Divine salvation he said yeah he said
[1:22:44] then why do people still have
[1:22:47] temptations he said that's why God said
[1:22:51] with every Temptation I give you a way
[1:22:53] of Escape I will not put more upon you
[1:22:55] than you can bear he said brother Wayne
[1:22:57] I'm in I'm under great Temptation and in
[1:23:00] the moment of
[1:23:01] Temptation grace is sufficient to give
[1:23:05] you a way of
[1:23:07] Escape I feel from the depths of my
[1:23:11] soul that this is more than just a
[1:23:14] sermon I feel it's a
[1:23:18] message and I feel the message is saying
[1:23:21] I really believe from my heart
[1:23:25] grace is
[1:23:28] sufficient for the dirt of this day
[1:23:32] won't you stand to your feet with me
[1:23:33] this
[1:23:41] morning Christians you're not
[1:23:43] promised a flowery bed of
[1:23:46] ease but you are promised Grace
[1:23:56] I'm a little bit in overtime
[1:24:04] sorry Grace
[1:24:09] sufficient aren't you
[1:24:19] glad you're going to hit a
[1:24:23] trial there's going to be
[1:24:26] Grace you're going to have
[1:24:28] Temptation there going to be
[1:24:33] Grace man one time heard me preach and
[1:24:36] he come to me he said I've done
[1:24:37] everything I could
[1:24:39] do he was suffering with a chronic
[1:24:44] illness he says to me and it was a it
[1:24:47] was I mean it was it was like a blood
[1:24:49] pressure or something I think
[1:24:55] but because he wasn't getting healed he
[1:24:57] began to question
[1:24:59] healing and I remember I remember going
[1:25:02] before the Lord it wasn't here in this
[1:25:03] assembly or part of this assembly it's
[1:25:04] way down south over on the east
[1:25:08] coast and I remember going in and
[1:25:10] praying I'm begin to ask the
[1:25:14] Lord and in the middle of that this
[1:25:16] scripture came to
[1:25:18] me he said my
[1:25:20] grace is sufficient
[1:25:25] sometimes you're facing things that
[1:25:26] seems almost
[1:25:28] lifelong yeah and you say well that
[1:25:31] there's just no end to it
[1:25:36] yeah but the trial can never stop a son
[1:25:40] or a daughter of
[1:25:46] God his
[1:25:48] grace is
[1:25:50] sufficient I'd like to remind you this
[1:25:52] morning
[1:25:54] that you're a Son of
[1:25:57] God a daughter of
[1:25:59] God I'd like to remind you that there's
[1:26:02] a blood for your
[1:26:04] sins I'd like to remind you that when
[1:26:07] God gave you the Holy Ghost deity came
[1:26:09] into your
[1:26:12] dirt and I don't want you to ever forget
[1:26:16] that whatever you're facing whatever
[1:26:18] suffering whatever trial whatever
[1:26:20] tribulation they will be manifold
[1:26:22] Temptations
[1:26:24] and there will be Trials of every
[1:26:28] kind but if deity is in the dirt it can
[1:26:31] only make you stronger can only make you
[1:26:34] more
[1:26:36] powerful now when I preached that as a
[1:26:39] 20-year-old kid I believed
[1:26:42] it but I've lived long enough
[1:26:46] now that I could stand with
[1:26:49] job and I can say I
[1:26:52] know amen amen I heard brother Bram read
[1:26:55] that scripture this morning and he and
[1:26:56] he quoted the part of it where job said
[1:26:58] I could take a
[1:27:01] pen and engrave it in a
[1:27:04] mountain I know and when he said that it
[1:27:07] just struck
[1:27:09] me it meant that that was such a solid
[1:27:12] place in job's
[1:27:14] life that he didn't care to put it
[1:27:17] anywhere it would be an eternal truth am
[1:27:21] I
[1:27:22] know that's right and do you know God is
[1:27:26] trying to get you to the same
[1:27:29] place I
[1:27:31] know that's where he's bringing
[1:27:34] you when the bride knows who she
[1:27:38] is the rapture is going to
[1:27:42] go this word your sufferings your trials
[1:27:47] are all positioning you into a place
[1:27:51] where you can stand and bring his
[1:27:53] presence
