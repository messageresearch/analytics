[39:40] amen and you know
[39:43] it's real
[39:46] it's real if that little voice of
[39:47] doubt's in your mind this morning
[39:49] i'm here to tell you someone who stood
[39:51] right there to witness last night the
[39:53] things that were taking place there was
[39:54] a real supernatural work of god
[39:57] going on amongst us
[39:59] lives change forever
[40:02] forever never be the same
[40:05] and so we're grateful for that what the
[40:07] lord has done we appreciate so much the
[40:09] ministry of brother andrew spencer
[40:12] brother timothy pruitt who we're going
[40:14] to invite to the pulpit in just a moment
[40:17] amen they're a real blessing to us
[40:20] amen
[40:21] but i
[40:22] i have on my heart this morning if you
[40:24] would just reverently take your bible
[40:25] and turn with me to hebrews the fourth
[40:27] chapter
[40:30] i just want to do this this morning
[40:32] something when i was a young person i've
[40:34] got out of the habit
[40:35] lately but when i was a young person
[40:39] i would turn to this scripture
[40:42] in prayer before a service hebrews
[40:45] chapter 4 and verse 12.
[40:47] [Music]
[40:49] and not as a superstition but just
[40:52] just uh just an honest gesture of the
[40:54] heart
[40:56] i'd like to put my finger on this
[40:57] scripture
[41:00] this hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 put your
[41:02] finger there
[41:04] it says for the word of god is quick and
[41:06] powerful
[41:07] sharper than any two-edged sword piece
[41:09] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[41:11] soul and spirit
[41:13] and of the joints and marrow
[41:15] and the word is a discerner
[41:18] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[41:20] amen it's not been the ministry
[41:24] of mortal men that we've been
[41:26] experiencing this weekend
[41:29] friday night brother brother timothy had
[41:31] left the platform brother ronnie was
[41:33] taking him back to his cabin
[41:35] all of a sudden the spirit of god came
[41:37] back on him he said i gotta go back out
[41:38] there there's one more chain to break
[41:41] amen there was a young lady sitting in
[41:43] the congregation just
[41:45] so
[41:46] struggling so much with those complexes
[41:48] of appearance
[41:49] you know the fashions of this world are
[41:52] really tough on some of our sisters she
[41:54] was just sitting there praying saying
[41:55] lord
[41:56] lord i i just need you to send brother
[41:58] timothy back to speak a word to me
[42:01] here he's already left the platform on
[42:03] his way out of the building
[42:04] the holy spirit turned him around came
[42:06] out to the platform spoke a word
[42:08] directly to our sisters you're
[42:09] beautifully and wonderfully made
[42:11] that's a supernatural
[42:13] that's a supernatural word
[42:16] amen that's not the thoughts of brother
[42:18] timothy pruitt that's the voice of god
[42:20] to you
[42:20] [Music]
[42:22] amen you hold on to that young people
[42:26] amen that's what we're looking for today
[42:27] it's the same god here today you believe
[42:29] that
[42:30] god you're still a discerner of the
[42:32] thoughts and intents of the heart

[42:36] morning to speak directly to my heart
[42:38] right where i'm at a word

[49:13] and we come up and we meet our loved
[49:15] ones
[49:16] and then
[49:17] we meet him
[49:19] and we sit down at the table across from
[49:21] each other

[49:25] there'll never be a crutch there
[49:28] there won't be a wheelchair there
[49:30] amen there won't be nervousness there
[49:33] there won't be depression there
[49:36] amen there won't be any of these things
[49:37] that you've been dealing with around
[49:39] that table oh won't that be marvelous
[49:42] and then we'll all be sitting there
[49:45] along the table and i'll look across the
[49:47] table and i'll say well god bless you
[49:48] brother
[49:50] and we'll just have a little cry i'm
[49:51] sure
[49:52] don't you believe so we'll just cry a
[49:54] little bit of joy
[49:56] but then at the head of the table we'll
[49:57] come out our king and his majesty
[50:00] and he'll walk down along all of us and
[50:03] he'll put his arms around us
[50:05] and he'll say you've suffered much
[50:07] but you went through much
[50:09] for me
[50:10] and he'll wipe all the tears away from
[50:12] our eyes
[50:14] and he'll say now don't cry anymore
[50:16] it's all over
[50:19] oh that'll be a great time that's why
[50:21] we're here isn't it
[50:23] amen won't it be wonderful to feel his
[50:26] arms around you and say now don't cry
[50:29] enter into the joys of the lord

[51:39] know how to fortify ourselves to know
[51:41] how to fight the fight we can only do
[51:44] that as a holy spirit will reveal it to
[51:46] us we cannot take what some of the
[51:48] nation tells us when we go to war some
[51:50] of their ideas but we got to take the
[51:53] way the holy spirit will direct us and
[51:55] the ideas he has given us because he is
[51:58] the commanding chief of the army of

[56:25] quit looking at the giants and he
[56:27] started looking at the word of god
[56:32] there's a good
[56:33] that's a good tactic right there on the
[56:35] devil
[56:36] quit looking at him and look at the word
[56:40] quit looking at what he's saying about
[56:42] you and start looking at what god said
[56:44] about you
[56:47] quit listening to his thoughts
[56:50] we don't get there amen when men or
[56:52] women quit looking at their sicknesses
[56:54] and their diseases and start looking at
[56:57] what god said about it you will take
[57:00] over
[57:02] all things are subject to jesus christ
[57:05] all things are subject to you in prayer
[57:07] when you ask in the name he said ask
[57:09] what you will in my name and it will be
[57:11] done whatsoever things you desire when
[57:13] you play pray believe you receive them
[57:15] and you shall have them god said so so
[57:19] don't let nothing
[57:21] stand in your way
[57:24] stop looking at the things you can see
[57:26] here and start looking to the unseen god
[57:29] said we can do it
[57:37] hey listen i i can understand not being
[57:40] a fight when you got chains on you
[57:43] you're chained up and you can't be
[57:48] but we heard that those chains have been
[57:49] broken
[57:58] now what you got to do is never go back
[58:01] and pick those chains up again
[58:03] never go back and accept those things
[58:06] again quit listening to the lie of the
[58:08] devil

[58:18] not for me the devil tells me i'm next
[58:20] i'm going to be the next one that falls
[58:21] away the devil tells me there's no hope
[58:24] for me you understand what you're
[58:25] listening to you're listening to his
[58:27] thoughts
[58:29] that's exactly what he's thinking he's
[58:31] thinking i'll never make it the rapture
[58:33] is never for me i'll never have a body
[58:35] change i'll never go there i'll never
[58:37] resurrect
[58:38] that is his thoughts
[58:44] start thinking what god said about you i

[59:12] any man through any age
[59:14] that's had any get up about him
[59:20] but see that's the spirit of the age

[59:28] called to be a man
[59:30] a man of god that'll stand toe-to-toe

[1:00:17] and this great big old giant
[1:00:19] came down by the name of goliath
[1:00:22] he says the devil's like that
[1:00:24] when he's got the edge on you he'd think
[1:00:26] he's got you then
[1:00:30] walked out there about
[1:00:32] 10 foot tall
[1:00:33] armored spear i'll tell you what i'll do
[1:00:36] i'll make an agreement with you
[1:00:38] israelites
[1:00:39] let's not shed no blood in other words
[1:00:42] let your best man come fight with me
[1:00:49] what did he do brother why
[1:00:50] he changed who they were
[1:00:54] amen goliath what did he say won't you
[1:00:56] say why don't you want to use servants
[1:00:57] of saul come out here
[1:01:01] they weren't servants of saul they were
[1:01:03] the armies of the living god
[1:01:07] why are you servants of depression why
[1:01:09] don't you try to fight me
[1:01:11] you're servants of unbelief why don't
[1:01:14] you try to fight me
[1:01:18] you servants of soul of some theology of
[1:01:22] some psychology why don't you try to
[1:01:24] fight me
[1:01:25] amen but he kept coming out there and
[1:01:27] making that challenge day after day but
[1:01:30] one day brother brandon said he said it
[1:01:31] one day too many times
[1:01:34] because there happened to be a little
[1:01:35] boy with some grit about him he wasn't
[1:01:38] no big man he wasn't no big shoulder man
[1:01:41] he wasn't no seven foot tall fella like
[1:01:43] like that like saul was he wasn't no ice
[1:01:46] cube preacher amen he had some grit
[1:01:48] about him
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:51] he had something that would say and when
[1:01:53] he heard that voice he said hey what's
[1:01:55] he talking about servants of saul we're
[1:01:57] not servants of saul we are the armies
[1:02:00] of the living god
[1:02:04] that's what you need to tell that
[1:02:06] goliath when he tries to come back and
[1:02:08] he said you servant of depression i
[1:02:10] ain't a servant of depression i'm a son
[1:02:12] and daughter of the living god
[1:02:17] his royal blood is flowing through my
[1:02:20] veins

[1:03:41] you look so little
[1:03:46] david got him a rock and he went down
[1:03:48] there and he slew that goliath what the
[1:03:50] bible said david ran
[1:03:54] he grabbed that flisting sword and he
[1:03:57] cut his head off
[1:04:00] and he grabbed that head up before all
[1:04:03] of israel
[1:04:06] he's dead
[1:04:07] [Laughter]
[1:04:11] he's dead
[1:04:15] he said what did that do that gave a
[1:04:18] bunch of more israelites courage
[1:04:21] they saw that john was dead so they
[1:04:23] grabbed their swords and they begin to
[1:04:25] go after those philistines

[1:05:46] and he put that giant's head right well
[1:05:48] you know it's called the mount of the
[1:05:50] skull there's a reason because david put
[1:05:52] it right there so everybody in israel
[1:05:54] when they pass by they could be reminded
[1:05:57] this enemy is dead
[1:06:00] and here our david came carrying that
[1:06:03] old rocket cross
[1:06:04] and he brought it right to the same
[1:06:06] place and he planted it in the same
[1:06:08] ground and he lifted it up and said your

[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:09] he is as good as a dead man
[1:09:20] mercy jesus
[1:09:22] saul found
[1:09:24] out
[1:09:25] what it was like for somebody to have
[1:09:27] some holy ghost spunk
[1:09:31] he had never felt it for himself
[1:09:32] apparently or if he did it was a long 20
[1:09:35] years ago
[1:09:39] hey while we're here
[1:09:42] i don't care where you are
[1:09:44] you can be 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
[1:09:48] maybe 100 years in this message
[1:09:52] you always need more of god
[1:09:58] if you get to the place you say i've got
[1:10:01] enough i don't need no more i'm
[1:10:03] satisfied you are dead
[1:10:10] people get the wrong ideas about an
[1:10:12] altar an altar sure is a place of
[1:10:13] repentance but it's also a place of
[1:10:15] worship
[1:10:16] it's also a place that you can be washed
[1:10:18] of some things it doesn't always mean
[1:10:21] you don't lost your religion and you
[1:10:22] backslid no i need more of god
[1:10:28] that's why we can't ever take the altars
[1:10:30] out of our churches cause we always
[1:10:32] gonna need more of god and if you got to
[1:10:34] that place you must be somewhere else i
[1:10:37] ain't got there i want more of him every
[1:10:40] day of my life
[1:10:49] so change your attitude about those at
[1:10:51] the altar it ain't always i'm sorry
[1:10:53] sinners they need more god amen they
[1:10:55] might be getting more of god but you
[1:10:56] need more yourself
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:06] truly then we find out who the sorry
[1:11:08] sinner really is
[1:11:24] he said there was a man one time
[1:11:27] had a dream or a moment and the devil
[1:11:30] was standing before him
[1:11:32] and that devil would go boo
[1:11:35] and he said he'd jump back
[1:11:37] he'd get smaller and the devil would get
[1:11:39] bigger
[1:11:41] and he kept he said he just kept hitting
[1:11:43] at him boo
[1:11:46] you don't think he still does that
[1:11:51] took me about three o'clock in the
[1:11:52] morning last night to go to sleep
[1:11:54] because the devil howling and carrying
[1:11:56] on
[1:12:00] listen
[1:12:01] he's always there he came to the prophet
[1:12:03] of god he stood in the corner when he
[1:12:05] woke up one morning
[1:12:07] said what did he say to the prophet of
[1:12:08] god who had defeated him service after
[1:12:10] service after service
[1:12:12] you have no power with god
[1:12:18] what
[1:12:27] he said i was looking at that and
[1:12:28] thought what in the world
[1:12:32] he said but all of a sudden he said i
[1:12:34] rebuke you
[1:12:39] and he said when he did he just fell
[1:12:41] back and he said all of a sudden the
[1:12:43] presence of god fell into the room
[1:12:45] and a voice said the never failing
[1:12:48] presence of god will go with you
[1:12:50] wherever you are and wherever you go
[1:12:54] he's there with you
[1:12:56] but you got to resist the devil
[1:13:02] have you ever noticed amen sometimes i i
[1:13:04] guess it don't happen maybe all the time
[1:13:06] maybe it does i guess i don't i can't
[1:13:08] say a hundred percent but i've watched
[1:13:09] amen when a girl comes to the moment and
[1:13:12] she's getting ready for marriage the
[1:13:13] wrong one will try to come first
[1:13:18] if she took that road her life would
[1:13:19] have been ruined
[1:13:21] and wrecked
[1:13:22] amen the devil is always there to try to
[1:13:25] get to you first
[1:13:27] just like he did eve he tried he got to
[1:13:29] her first
[1:13:32] amen but brother he said all of a sudden
[1:13:35] i fell against something and it was the
[1:13:37] word of god
[1:13:40] and he said i looked at that and i
[1:13:41] grabbed it and i made a hit at him
[1:13:45] and i as i may begin to hit back at him
[1:13:47] and say boo he jumped back and he got
[1:13:51] smaller and i got bigger
[1:13:53] he said he knew then he had some fight
[1:13:55] in him he said brother every time he
[1:13:58] hollers boo and you jump back he'll just
[1:14:00] keep get be getting getting bigger but
[1:14:02] when you take god's word and you stand
[1:14:05] there and say thus saith the lord it is
[1:14:08] written
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:10] he will take his flight
[1:14:15] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:14:18] you
[1:14:24] he said brother timothy i i don't want
[1:14:26] no more trial well who does
[1:14:30] i i've been through a lot who hasn't
[1:14:38] i promise you
[1:14:40] as bad as you can get it you can always
[1:14:42] find somebody that's getting it worse
[1:14:47] the devil don't want to show you that he
[1:14:48] wants you to think you're having the
[1:14:50] worst day
[1:14:51] and you got the worst life and you got
[1:14:53] the worst family and you got the worst
[1:14:54] this and you got the words of that
[1:14:57] nonsense
[1:15:02] but the bible says resist the devil
[1:15:05] now you know when you go into strength
[1:15:07] training to build muscle it takes
[1:15:09] resistance

[1:15:15] every attack that's coming against you
[1:15:17] and you're resisting him you're getting
[1:15:19] stronger
[1:15:27] you ever seen some of them guys they got
[1:15:29] some big old muscles piled up to here
[1:15:31] and you you know what happened they
[1:15:32] resisted a lot longer than you have
[1:15:36] and they kept resisting that weight that
[1:15:38] was trying to crush them and they kept
[1:15:40] pushing it up and pushing it up and
[1:15:42] pushing it up and pushing up and pushing
[1:15:45] back and pushing back listen
[1:15:46] depression's going to try to come back
[1:15:48] just keep pushing it back
[1:15:52] spirits of hell is going to try to come
[1:15:54] against you again just keep pushing him
[1:15:56] back and pushing him back and faith
[1:15:58] begins to rise and faith begins to rise
[1:16:00] and faith begins to rise and faith
[1:16:02] begins to rise
[1:16:06] and the devil bring another one on he'll
[1:16:08] try to put it up just keep pushing
[1:16:12] just keep pushing and one day you're
[1:16:14] going to push yourself right into a body
[1:16:17] change
[1:16:31] you know i was
[1:16:32] believe it or not
[1:16:34] one day i like to ride a bike
[1:16:37] them days are fleeting
[1:16:43] i was riding a bike around our place and
[1:16:45] we we're a little bit more hilly than
[1:16:46] this place
[1:16:48] not a whole lot of there's some place
[1:16:51] you can find a little bit of flat ground
[1:16:52] but there's more hills
[1:16:54] and bicycles in me don't like hills
[1:16:58] i was taking this five miles by the way
[1:17:00] and i think it's done it went around
[1:17:01] that loop
[1:17:02] that's some for real hills down through
[1:17:04] there
[1:17:04] and that last hill you go up is a hard
[1:17:07] one it's the worst one
[1:17:09] it hurts
[1:17:10] it's burning it's killing you
[1:17:14] you're pretty sure when you get up
[1:17:16] you're dead
[1:17:17] if you make it up there
[1:17:21] and there's all kinds of temptations to
[1:17:22] just stop and quit
[1:17:24] but if you stop and quit you're never
[1:17:26] going to make to the top
[1:17:28] if you stop and turn just you know you
[1:17:30] ride it back you're going the wrong way
[1:17:33] you're going further away from home amen
[1:17:35] you might be going downhill but you're
[1:17:37] going further away from home
[1:17:40] amen but we had me and brother tim
[1:17:41] winters one time we're riding together
[1:17:43] we're pushing we're huffing we're
[1:17:44] kicking and i said i'm not quitting i'm
[1:17:46] not stopping i said cause you know why
[1:17:48] brother tim this is the last hill
[1:17:52] because right over that hill is my home
[1:17:55] right over that hill is my place right
[1:17:58] over that hill is my family right over
[1:18:01] that hill oh hallelujah the last hill is
[1:18:04] tough it's the toughest ages ever been
[1:18:06] to live in but keep pushing
[1:18:09] don't get off keep going
[1:18:13] it's the last hill it's the last fight
[1:18:16] it's the last battle
[1:18:20] one day you're gonna face your last
[1:18:22] enemy
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:31] but if you get off too soon you're never
[1:18:33] going to win
[1:18:35] you're not going to make it home
[1:18:39] might make it into a tribulation what
[1:18:40] happens there i don't know but you're
[1:18:42] not going to make it home
[1:18:46] i said you might make it into a
[1:18:47] tribulation i don't know if you'll make
[1:18:48] it through a tribulation
[1:18:56] brother branham said in satan's eden as
[1:18:57] he would begin the
[1:18:59] sermon
[1:19:00] he said i'd like to speak to you
[1:19:01] something
[1:19:02] bring you something to enlighten you
[1:19:05] to the promises of god for this age
[1:19:09] not somebody else's or some other day
[1:19:12] but them things are all right but we can
[1:19:14] refer to them things sometime but i
[1:19:15] thought i'd try to bring something to
[1:19:17] your mind with these scriptures i've got
[1:19:19] written here
[1:19:20] that would enlighten you to know
[1:19:22] to make you a better soldier in the
[1:19:24] field that you're fighting in now
[1:19:27] to learn the tactics
[1:19:29] of the enemy
[1:19:30] so you can block everything before it
[1:19:33] gets to you
[1:19:35] that's the main thing is to learn to
[1:19:37] keep the punches off of you as much as
[1:19:41] you can
[1:19:46] amen to keep the point that shows you
[1:19:49] the devil's got a punch
[1:19:52] you're not going to go back home and not
[1:19:54] face one
[1:19:57] he's not going to quit
[1:20:02] he does have his last day and i'm very
[1:20:04] much looking forward to it but right now
[1:20:06] he he has the ability to still swing and
[1:20:09] still land punches
[1:20:14] and sometimes they seem to come out of
[1:20:16] nowhere
[1:20:18] coming to places you wouldn't think it
[1:20:19] was going to happen and he he swings and
[1:20:21] it punches you and in that punch he
[1:20:24] tries to attach something to it
[1:20:29] but see god knew in this great warfare
[1:20:31] that was coming on between right and
[1:20:33] wrong he knew what the enemy was going
[1:20:35] to do
[1:20:36] he knew exactly so if he knew exactly
[1:20:38] what the enemy was going to do he knows
[1:20:40] exactly how to equip his people
[1:20:43] so he noticed the very first thing that
[1:20:45] god equipped his children with was being
[1:20:47] infinite he knew what would take what it
[1:20:49] would take to defeat satan any time any
[1:20:52] place anywhere in any conditions
[1:20:57] i'm sure that he didn't say he knew what
[1:21:00] it would take that would defeat satan
[1:21:01] only in a youth camp
[1:21:05] he said anywhere any time any place any
[1:21:09] condition
[1:21:12] he wouldn't say i'll give them something
[1:21:13] here and then a few laters i'll study
[1:21:15] years later i'll study out and try to
[1:21:17] find them something better like we in a
[1:21:19] military force you know first we started
[1:21:20] with an old bow and arrow and then we
[1:21:22] moved to a rock hammer or something and
[1:21:24] then to a musket and then the
[1:21:26] springfield rifle and automatic now we
[1:21:28] got atomic weapons we kept growing but
[1:21:30] god at the beginning gave his children
[1:21:33] the atomic weapon
[1:21:38] oh jesus you're not walking away from
[1:21:41] here with just a little slingshot or you
[1:21:44] know what i'm trying to say not just
[1:21:45] something very little and insignificant
[1:21:47] as it may say god equipped you with a
[1:21:50] nuclear bomb
[1:21:57] that's right brother way and you got the
[1:22:00] codes to it
[1:22:03] in the world we live supposedly it takes
[1:22:05] several people to know the codes where
[1:22:07] they can shoot one but you have the code
[1:22:09] to it
[1:22:11] you have the ability anytime you want to
[1:22:14] push it and release it upon the devil
[1:22:17] it's an atomic weapon god equipped you
[1:22:19] with the right kind of
[1:22:21] uh ammunition for the for the attack
[1:22:23] right kind of everything that we'd ever
[1:22:25] have need of and would take you all the
[1:22:27] way from eden to a rapture what is it
[1:22:30] it's the word of god
[1:22:32] that's what defeats satan is the word
[1:22:35] it'll defeat him anywhere anyplace
[1:22:38] anytime any conditions
[1:22:43] we find jesus on earth proved it was the
[1:22:45] best equipment satan come in
[1:22:47] hand-to-hand combat with jesus he never
[1:22:49] reached over with all of his great power
[1:22:51] he could have tied his hands but he took
[1:22:53] the same weapon that he gave in the
[1:22:55] garden of eden his word and said it is
[1:22:57] written
[1:22:59] it is written and he punched him right
[1:23:01] out of the ring with it
[1:23:06] glory to god he punched him right out of
[1:23:08] the ring with it so if you'll use the
[1:23:10] saying it is written it is written it is
[1:23:14] written it'll punch him right out of
[1:23:16] your bedroom
[1:23:19] it'll punch him right out of your
[1:23:20] private life it'll punch him right out
[1:23:22] of your family it'll punch him right out
[1:23:25] of your situation it'll punch him out of
[1:23:27] your church
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:35] he said look it's not just one or two of
[1:23:37] us in the church has got this ability
[1:23:39] it's every one of us
[1:23:45] it's every one of
[1:23:46] us that
[1:23:50] all right have a little equipment
[1:23:51] failure here
[1:23:53] let god's equipment don't fail
[1:23:57] jesus proved it when he come he equipped
[1:23:59] his children with the word for their
[1:24:01] protection against the enemy so when all
[1:24:05] all-out warfare comes and battles are
[1:24:08] set in array there's only one thing for
[1:24:09] the soldier to use a real christian
[1:24:12] soldier that's thus saith the lord
[1:24:18] well give me some examples okay
[1:24:23] i'm gonna give you even a really really
[1:24:25] good one that give you some courage to
[1:24:26] do something
[1:24:28] this morning this is brother branham
[1:24:31] while i've been listening a few days ago
[1:24:33] to a broadcast
[1:24:35] that seemed to want to tell that the
[1:24:36] creation just come from some ashes
[1:24:39] blowing together in some phosphate and a
[1:24:41] few chemicals of the earth and the warm
[1:24:44] sunshine created the germ of life and
[1:24:48] how ridiculous that was but satan was
[1:24:50] trying to punch that at me
[1:24:54] he was trying to punch that to me he
[1:24:56] said after uh taking my little rebecca
[1:24:58] to school this morning on the road back
[1:25:00] i started to turn the radio now he
[1:25:02] didn't have internet i started to turn
[1:25:05] the radio on again i thought i'll get
[1:25:07] into that stuff again so i just turned
[1:25:10] it back off
[1:25:13] oh oh
[1:25:15] that's somewhere some of y'all need to
[1:25:17] start
[1:25:18] turn it off
[1:25:24] that voice has been telling you you're
[1:25:26] ugly turn it off
[1:25:29] because i know this voice didn't
[1:25:33] that voice has been telling you you

[1:25:46] instagram
[1:25:50] and whatever in the world the rest of
[1:25:52] the things are whatever else the devil
[1:25:54] had come up with turn it off
[1:26:00] listen we're not here to get men's
[1:26:02] approval
[1:26:08] and i ain't talking about me as a
[1:26:09] preacher i'm talking about you
[1:26:11] and you
[1:26:12] and you the world is always trying to
[1:26:15] show you what's approved what's right
[1:26:17] you know what's the right thing to wear
[1:26:19] and how you ought to be and what you
[1:26:20] should look like and therefore our
[1:26:22] sisters start getting all these fake
[1:26:24] things on them the fake hairs and the
[1:26:25] fake this and the fake that listen i
[1:26:27] remember brother branham said there
[1:26:28] ain't nothing artificial going into
[1:26:29] rapture
[1:26:32] and our boys get fake hairstyles and
[1:26:34] they get fake this and they get fake
[1:26:36] there and they get off why because they
[1:26:38] haven't turned the wrong voice off
[1:26:44] listen sisters you're not here for men's
[1:26:46] approval
[1:26:47] you're here for god's approval
[1:26:50] we're living here for god's approval
[1:26:53] amen i like how it said one time the
[1:26:54] girl said i want to get so lost in
[1:26:57] christ that if a boy tries to find me
[1:26:59] he's got to find him first
[1:27:05] and that can go the other way boys you
[1:27:07] need to get so lost in christ amen to
[1:27:10] where you're looking for the right thing
[1:27:12] you're looking at you're pursuing after
[1:27:14] the right one
[1:27:26] so i turned it off but satan didn't stop
[1:27:29] he kept trying to punch
[1:27:31] satan said to me said you know that man
[1:27:34] that you call jesus was
[1:27:36] just a man like like billy graham or war
[1:27:38] roberts
[1:27:40] he was just a man that began to have a
[1:27:42] few people to gather around him and say
[1:27:44] he's a great man
[1:27:47] and after a while he became greater
[1:27:50] to where they made him a god to them
[1:27:53] now scattered off the wall all over the
[1:27:54] world since he's dead and that's all
[1:27:57] there is to it
[1:27:59] and i thought
[1:28:00] satan
[1:28:02] how a liar you are
[1:28:07] i turned just as i was crossing graham
[1:28:09] street i said satan you're you that's
[1:28:11] talking to my conscience i'd like to ask
[1:28:14] you a few things who was it that the
[1:28:16] hebrew prophet spoke that would come who
[1:28:18] was the anointed messiah what was upon
[1:28:21] those men who foresaw him and told him
[1:28:22] his life thousands of years before he
[1:28:24] got here who was it that foretold it was
[1:28:27] just a letter
[1:28:28] to the letter four told it to a letter
[1:28:30] and when he come he was numbered with
[1:28:32] his transgression and he was he was
[1:28:34] wounded for our transgressions he was he
[1:28:36] made his grave with the rich but he
[1:28:37] would rise on the third day and he did
[1:28:40] and he promised the holy ghost and i've
[1:28:42] got it so you might as well get out of
[1:28:44] my way because it's written in the word
[1:28:46] and every word is true
[1:28:49] and then he left
[1:28:54] that does it he cannot stand that word
[1:28:58] [Applause]

[1:35:47] proverbs 6 and verse 2 says thou art
[1:35:49] snared with the words of thy mouth

[1:36:06] wow
[1:36:08] well i didn't know them scriptures was
[1:36:09] in there where they are
[1:36:12] but he that opened and wide his lips
[1:36:15] shall
[1:36:16] have destruction
[1:36:33] he that keepeth his mouth

[1:36:41] a wholesome tongue
[1:36:43] or a healing tongue or a healthy tongue
[1:36:46] is a tree of life
[1:36:49] i want to have a healing tongue
[1:36:54] amen
[1:36:57] but a perverseness therein
[1:36:59] is a breach in the spirit
[1:37:03] well brother timothy
[1:37:05] that's words what about thoughts okay
[1:37:08] well words are thoughts expressed
[1:37:13] brother adam please explain how a person
[1:37:16] knows if he's thinking his own thoughts
[1:37:18] or if the devil is placing thoughts in
[1:37:20] his mind to make him think wrong
[1:37:21] especially if you know you don't want to
[1:37:23] thank them
[1:37:27] now that don't get ready for no algebra
[1:37:29] get ready for one plus one equals two
[1:37:33] then if it's contrary to the word
[1:37:36] it's the devil's thinking
[1:37:43] so what you young people need to do is
[1:37:46] quit taking a beating for the devil's
[1:37:48] thoughts
[1:37:49] it's not your thoughts
[1:37:51] it's the devil's thoughts but if it's
[1:37:53] the word it's god's thinking
[1:37:59] hallelujah if it's the wrong thoughts
[1:38:02] it's the devil but if it's the good
[1:38:04] thoughts of the word and of god it's
[1:38:06] god's thinking
[1:38:11] i thought it was mine no it's the devil
[1:38:14] doing that to you
[1:38:21] well if i didn't answer it okay if the
[1:38:23] case
[1:38:24] may be that the devil is placing
[1:38:26] thoughts in your mind about a certain
[1:38:28] thing how may i it be i overcome it or
[1:38:31] get rid of it
[1:38:33] take the very vice versa
[1:38:36] from it
[1:38:39] if you know you're a christian and he
[1:38:41] tries to make you think you're not a
[1:38:43] christian just say i'm a christian
[1:38:48] as long as your experience matches god's
[1:38:50] word i'm a christian everything else the
[1:38:52] same way
[1:38:57] he says when you answer this please pray
[1:38:59] for me to overcome this as i'm not i'm
[1:39:01] not by myself he said god grant you're
[1:39:03] overcoming whoever you are may your
[1:39:05] thoughts always go back to the other
[1:39:07] side and say i'm a christian i'm a
[1:39:10] believer satan you have no hold on me
[1:39:16] can we change our thinking this morning
[1:39:18] i'm a christian i'm a believer satan you
[1:39:21] have no hold on me
[1:39:24] now you say i'm just a young person he
[1:39:26] says frankly i'm standing right here
[1:39:28] saying the same thing
[1:39:34] keep from to keep from fainting right
[1:39:36] here in the pulpit four or five times
[1:39:38] i've almost pitched over on the pulpit
[1:39:40] that's the truth god knows that's right
[1:39:43] the prophet had mind battles
[1:39:46] jesus had mind battles
[1:39:51] you're not in a boat by yourself
[1:40:00] so philippians 4 says finally brother
[1:40:03] whatsoever things are true
[1:40:05] whatsoever things are honest
[1:40:07] whatsoever things are just
[1:40:09] whatsoever things are pure
[1:40:11] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:40:13] things are a good report if there be any
[1:40:16] virtue if there be any praise
[1:40:18] think
[1:40:19] on
[1:40:20] these things
[1:40:24] you have to change your thoughts
[1:40:27] you have the right to take dominion over
[1:40:29] it's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:40:32] it's right here
[1:40:34] amen go listen to it after this go
[1:40:35] listen to the greatest battle over fall
[1:40:37] it's right here
[1:40:39] the devil warned against the mind and in
[1:40:41] the time we're living in it's worse than
[1:40:43] it ever been
[1:40:47] he said a man could come to an altar he
[1:40:49] could pray all night he could cry he
[1:40:50] could beg he completed walk them down
[1:40:52] the floors he'd make restitution but
[1:40:53] until he believes and accepted he's
[1:40:56] still a sinner jesus christ is the high
[1:40:59] priest of our confession profession the
[1:41:01] same as confession he's a high priest of
[1:41:04] our confession therefore he can't do
[1:41:06] nothing for us until we confess he's
[1:41:09] already done it then that's when he goes
[1:41:11] to work as a high priest to make good
[1:41:14] what you profess
[1:41:19] he will make anything good that's
[1:41:21] included in the atonement wounded for
[1:41:24] our transgression bruised for our
[1:41:26] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:41:28] was upon him and by his stripes
[1:41:31] i'm healed
[1:41:33] not we will be not what we ought to be
[1:41:36] in but what we are past tense already
[1:41:39] healed
[1:41:44] so you got to be careful with your
[1:41:45] testimony from here on out
[1:41:49] don't ever have a negative one
[1:41:53] giving you some ammunition this morning
[1:41:54] to go fight the devil and i want you to
[1:41:56] fight a good fight
[1:41:59] i want him to know
[1:42:01] that he been fighting somebody when he

[1:46:51] you can say

[1:46:54] all right best you can do just mentally
[1:46:56] just say it well i believe it i accept
[1:46:58] it and if you accept it upon those bases
[1:47:01] keep saying it over and over

[1:47:25] saved
[1:47:29] when you believe it something's going to
[1:47:30] take place but don't have a negative
[1:47:34] testimony every time when you confess
[1:47:37] well i still feel bad i still feel this
[1:47:39] there's not a man or woman here that's
[1:47:41] been baptized with the holy spirit but
[1:47:43] would start your confession and believe
[1:47:45] i lost it and you'll go right down
[1:47:49] don't ever have no negative testimony
[1:47:51] testify positive i'm well jesus has
[1:47:54] healed me no matter how you're feeling
[1:47:56] if you go to your feelings you're
[1:47:57] certainly going to go off the wrong way
[1:47:59] but if you go back to that every time
[1:48:01] that you have a negative testimony every
[1:48:03] time you look at your symptoms you have
[1:48:05] fallen right there there's not a
[1:48:07] christian in here no matter how solid
[1:48:08] you are in the faith if right now
[1:48:10] something happened to get ahold of you
[1:48:12] and tell you you're not a christian you
[1:48:14] start out testifying i'm not a christian
[1:48:16] as soon as you testify that you've
[1:48:19] dropped from grace right then
[1:48:24] amen don't ever let your testimony be
[1:48:26] negative
[1:48:31] and don't let your testimony be a
[1:48:33] negative testimony about other people
[1:48:41] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:48:42] in your mind if you can help it
[1:48:47] but when it starts
[1:48:48] don't entertain it
[1:48:51] nope not my fault
[1:48:55] nope not me
[1:48:57] yep that's me
[1:48:59] i am an overcomer
[1:49:02] that's right that's me i am a saved son
[1:49:05] of god

[1:49:10] you can't help you can't you can't
[1:49:12] you're human you can't help thoughts
[1:49:13] from coming
[1:49:14] they're going to come
[1:49:16] but you can kept keep them from stopping
[1:49:18] and staying there
[1:49:20] you got to turn
[1:49:22] well you know like a farmer he couldn't
[1:49:24] stop the birds from flying over his
[1:49:25] place but he could sure stop them from

[1:51:04] preachers or grown-ups

[1:51:11] in the tapes instead of facebook and
[1:51:13] instagram and all that other nonsense

[2:24:44] we've uh
[2:24:46] we witnessed two men of god anointed
[2:24:50] that preach this gospel
[2:24:52] [Music]
[2:24:53] not just the
[2:24:54] mechanics but the dynamics
[2:24:58] which is christ himself
[2:25:02] brother andrew last night used joel
[2:25:05] chapter 2
[2:25:07] i will pour out my spirit
[2:25:10] upon all flesh
[2:25:15] peter used it in the book of acts
[2:25:17] [Music]
[2:25:19] when the holy ghost was poured out
[2:25:22] he said this is that
[2:25:24] that was prophesied by the prophet joel
[2:25:28] i want to say today
[2:25:32] that we are witnessing
[2:25:35] that this is that
[2:25:37] what malachi 4 said
[2:25:40] would be in our midst
[2:25:44] when we see people filled with the holy
[2:25:46] ghost
[2:25:48] great deliverances
[2:25:51] healing in their bodies healing in their
[2:25:53] minds
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:25:55] we serve a risen christ
[2:25:59] [Music]
[2:26:03] even as a grandfather witnessing my
[2:26:08] some of my family getting the holy ghost
[2:26:10] last night
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:13] real genuine holy ghost
[2:26:17] we've seen the word in action
[2:26:21] but like brother timothy was saying
[2:26:25] has to be some overcomers now
[2:26:29] i think of what brother branham said in
[2:26:31] the marriage of the lamb
[2:26:32] said he can't expect god on one side of
[2:26:35] the tube
[2:26:36] and you on the other and just he keeps
[2:26:38] on pulling you through you got something
[2:26:40] to do he said
[2:26:42] you got to be an overcomer
[2:26:43] [Music]
[2:26:46] and i think he also said it's
[2:26:48] you know it's it's easy right now
[2:26:51] when the anointing is here and the power
[2:26:53] of god is moving
[2:26:56] but now you'll
[2:26:57] see the test
[2:27:02] and when he's tabernacled there don't
[2:27:04] worry
[2:27:05] it'll hold
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:10] it'll hold
[2:27:12] i've been a christian since 1967.
[2:27:17] and i can testify it holds
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:21] it holds people
[2:27:25] [Applause]
[2:27:32] i appreciate brother nathan brother
[2:27:34] ronnie and
[2:27:36] their wives having the burden
[2:27:38] for the youth
[2:27:40] and for this camp meeting
[2:27:42] and i appreciate these two families
[2:27:46] but not only that
[2:27:50] but
[2:27:51] the team that
[2:27:53] volunteered to get behind them
[2:27:57] and put this camp on
[2:27:59] i think we ought to give them a handclap
[2:28:01] today

[2:30:44] joy and the passion that we feel in our
[2:30:46] hearts for the word of god
[2:30:48] glory be to god you know there's a lot
[2:30:50] of young people that had a real
[2:30:51] experience with god this weekend broke
[2:30:53] out in a dance and shoutings and
[2:30:56] emotional exuberance and you know what
[2:30:58] the way that the enemy is he comes right
[2:30:59] behind that coming in your mind with
[2:31:01] accusations criticisms
[2:31:03] it's always there it's scriptural amen
[2:31:06] i feel a little bold this afternoon
[2:31:09] amen it's scriptural david dance in the
[2:31:12] bible david's worship and the one that
[2:31:13] was supposed to be his bride
[2:31:15] amen she stood she sat in the seat of
[2:31:17] the scornful
[2:31:19] amen she was supposed to be his bride
[2:31:21] but she was criticizing his worship
[2:31:24] amen and it's really unfortunate that a
[2:31:26] lot of young people you know they'll
[2:31:28] they'll have an experience with god they
[2:31:29] break into a dance and get real liberty
[2:31:31] and the voice that they they're here in
[2:31:33] their head is the voice of some
[2:31:34] so-called message preacher or so-called
[2:31:36] message pastor or so-called teacher
[2:31:39] amen but i give thanks to god for his
[2:31:41] grace this weekend amen if you heard the
[2:31:44] voice of the accuser in your ear you
[2:31:45] didn't hear it from this pulpit
