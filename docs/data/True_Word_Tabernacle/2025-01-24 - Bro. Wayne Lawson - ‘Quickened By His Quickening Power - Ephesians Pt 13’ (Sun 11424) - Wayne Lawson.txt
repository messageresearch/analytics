Matthew did you write that buddy that was a powerful song Amen um I must I must get to him amen have you ever felt like that amen uh you got to get to him uh can you imagine that morning that they uh some friends had a guy that was in such bad shape and they knew if they could just get him in the presence of the Lord and they ripped the roof off for that to happen because they knew that's what would change the matter amen and I I know Jesus can change everything can he this morning and it's certainly amen a pleasure to be here and uh we want to just take a few minutes this morning in the scripture if we could maybe just bow our hearts we're going to uh just say a word of prayer and then we'll have a reading here but amen let's just be let's just pray father we thank you today for your grace Lord us being together Lord It's a cold January day but Lord your mercy is Rich this morning and Lord the sun is shining and the warmth of the Holy Spirit Lord that's moving in the hearts of

you would just send your angel here Lord and open the scripture as we speak of you along the way we ask it now father in Jesus name amen and amen and if you have your Bibles this morning we would just like to go right into the word word here um amen uh amen we're amen defe fighting a defeated enemy amen amen that's powerful isn't it amen that Revelation is one of them that uh puts you in a different sphere amen amen fighting a defeated enemy amen Ephesians chapter 2 and I want to read six verses here Ephesians chapter 2 veres 1-6 and amen um Ephesians chap 2 verse 1-6 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin wherein time passed you walked according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience now among whom also we had our conversation in times past and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others I like that don't you by Nature not by seed amen not not by seed but by Nature the children of Wrath even as others now but God somebody say but God who is rich in Mercy for his great loved we with he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ Now by Grace you're saved and he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we ask the Lord to bless his word as you can be seated this morning amen I'm uh going to continue of course in the book of Ephesians I have a few more things I want to bring from this but uh this morning amen uh I I want to speak a little bit here to you from just a subject and just I'll take a title to kind of give you my topic here but uh I want to talk to you about quickened by his quickening power quickened by quickening power uh I think it's a powerful thing uh when you see it in the scripture and that sometimes I get to think and I I talk a lot about quickening power and brother Ray talks a lot about quicking power and the other brothers talk a lot about quicking power but if you're studying scripture there's a lot in here about quickening power amen because it is a uh it is a theme subject for the church amen about quickening power because that's exactly what it is that God uses to awaken the church is quickening power now uh if you're uh if you'd like to study this the messages uh there's three sermons that we're going to be looking through some of these points uh it is the rising of the sun uh it is the Easter seal in 65 and also uh the sermon God rich and mercy and brother BR specifically takes these scriptures and God rich and mercy and specifically talks about Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one down through so you can get a real a real concept of where brother Bram took this and what he believed and of course we we recognize that it does us no good just as something as a history lesson but when we start seeing the events of our day transpiring then it becomes a different kind of reality amen and uh I I I think it's amazing because brother bradam begins God rich in Mercy when he reads this Ephesians chapter 2 he begins with something he says here now what caused this change he says now what caused this change you who he hath quickened were dead in sins and trespasses and I I I thought it's amazing because you asked yourself what kind of change is it that Paul's talking about and if you read uh this actual scripture Paul is discussing what it what we were and what we have be come and what was it that caused this and brother bam brings this point out amen that what caused the change what caused this from one time you were dead but Quicken means to make alive so there was a change one time you were dead now you all could go back in your memories and remember when you were dead but you're not dead this morning amen so that caused the change brother B said there was a change from Death To Life now there is no other thing he says that could happen to any person so great as to change from Death To Life a man if he was dying physically could be healed physically and that would be a great thing but nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and God has quickened him to life amen what that change amen means that you were one time dead amen now that that's something you were dead now but you can look back and know know that you were dead but now why aren't you dead tonight now you have to ask yourself now we were but why aren't we this morning why are we alive this morning well the brother Ram tells it very powerful because God made the change amen because God made the change now we didn't deserve it we were dead but God who is rich in Mercy made a change in our lives that we couldn't make and I always think it's about something like you think about a man who's out in the graveyard now he has no ability to wake himself up somebody has to resurrect him and you think about you and I in the positions that we were in our life we had no hope and we were without God and we had no way to awaken ourselves and we would only be in a grave this morning of death and of sin but yet God who is rich in Mercy came to our lives and showed Mercy To Us by awaking us out of that day death and that deadness now if somebody's dead and see this morning don't feel bad at them don't don't think don't don't don't think bad of people because they're not where you are in life it's just when you see someone that's way drifting in sin and they're dead to the things of God stop and take a moment and realize you deserve the same thing but God who is rich in Mercy has given you Mercy when you didn't desire it and you didn't deserve it and you were running your own way but God who is rich in Mercy we have nothing to brag on ourselves this morning we can only say with Apostle Paul but it was God who was rich in Mercy you Paul if there's anybody could say it Paul could say it he was a dead Theologian he was a dead Pharisee he was a Pharisee of Pharisee he said above above all he said I was a Pharisee of pH law he said I was blameless but in faith the man was dead he was so dead he was persec in Jesus Christ but when he met that angel of the Lord on the road and he said he spoke unto Jesus he was changed from the dead man to a man that could write the scriptures because the quickening power of Jesus Christ made him alive to the realities of almighty God now I think it's a powerful thing that's what made the change right there God rich in Mercy now here's the thing God doesn't change so whatever he done for you and whatever he done for me he will do for someone else because he's God rich in Mercy amen so so what happened to you God rich in Mercy what happened in your life it was God rich in Mercy and that's all we can say we can't say big ey or little you or or we we can't say any of that we just have to say God is rich in his Mercy amen that's what happened to you and I God who is rich in Mercy now God rich in Mercy brother bam is preaching this sermon and and I love how he does things because of course he wasn't at his own church so he said I'm going to inject a little Doctrine in here and I thought now when brother Bram said I'm going to inject a little Doctrine I want to hear what he's considering Doctrine what what was he teaching that others didn't believe that he was concerned in saying it from someone else's platform but he felt it was so necessary to say it he says see injecting Doctrine he says now if you don't believe it it's all right amen he's a gentleman wasn't he i i i i i when the man was born in a world and when you were a little baby born into the world you could not have been here without being the forn knowledge of God because he is infinite and he knows all things and when that little baby is born into the world there is something in that baby if it's ever going to have life there is something in there in the child when he comes to sooner or later that little seed is in him now if you'll take it the scriptures plainly declare it I thought isn't that something brother man takes your experience as a Believer not to the time you come to the altar he takes your experience as a Believer back before the foundation of the world and when you were born into the Earth God deposited something in you amen that's not in every person in the world Amen it's just not in every human doesn't have that in them but God who is rich in Mercy deposited an eternal germ life inside of you when you were even unaware that you had a mama or a daddy or you couldn't feed yourself you couldn't bathe yourself you could look at the grace of God folks this this wasn't something that you grew up and found God and you did and and this all this thing and I could tell you how wonderful I was and amen look look at God putting this in a baby when he was born how many realize when brother Adam came to the Earth within just a couple minutes of his birth the angel of the Lord settled over the bed where he was born he wasn't he wasn't doing anything yet amen but God had for dained that birth and he was testifying my gift lays in this part of the flesh amen I tell you God who is rich in Mercy now now now brother R says now this is a if you're going to later in life you'll see maybe a little more how important this is but there's a lot of Concepts in people believe in things like you know you you when you hear the message you get the seed now they got reasons to say that because brother Bram said the word is a seed right so when you hear the word you're hearing the seed of God and that's a virgin wound so it's deposited in there and Jesus gives the parable in Matthew 13 that's why people teach it for the seed fell in the ground some was Rocky and some had cares and some so some people re they they hear that portion of it but the but if the ground is not prepared to receive that that's a seed right but there's also you as a jean seed which is like Mary she received the word of Isaiah that was a seed but she was a predestinated seed for that word to be born into so both things were predestinated both Jesus and Mary were predestinated and so is the word of this age coming through a prophet there has to be somebody who's going to believe that and you can't no more help that you believe this amen than nothing you can't no more help that you believe this because God who is rich in Mercy put something in your heart to believe it and you believe it in the midst of criticism and you believe it when people are doubting but there's something in you that you can't even explain it maybe you don't even know how to take the scripture and prove what you believe but you believe it anyhow because God who is rich in Mercy deposited something in you when you didn't even know what you were doing so when you come to the altar you don't get a seed now now I think it's powerful that you catch this amen when you come to the altar you don't get a seed the prophet of God said because there is nothing in a nonseed to Quicken but the reason that you came to the altar is because there was a seed in you already amen so it wasn't you coming it was God pulling it was God rich and mercy knowing I have a seed somewhere in this building and he scatters his word and pulls that individual to his own word amen it's it's God if you have eternal life tonight amen now uh if you have eternal life tonight he said then you always were because there's only one form of eternal life and we always were and the reason we were because we are a part of God and Only God is the thing that is eternal now that's a pretty powerful Doctrine you're is eternal as God is eternal because you're seed of God Amen now God rich in Mercy brother B lays these things down very clearly you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you come from that's right isn't that powerful you know where you come from you know it was the truth you always were the seed was always in you the word sing the word that was before the foundation of the world and and that you come to it now brother Bram only he he's I love how brother Bram does things cuz being that he's a bit of a a a simple man he takes it to weed just so the people could hear him gladly and he takes beautiful things like this and and makes a duck story out of it takes us to the farm and and he takes us out there and says there's a little duck one time Amen in God rich and mercy he said there was a little duck there and he said it was born into a chicken yard same as his Eagle story he said a little duck was born is in that and he said that little duck was born there he said but he couldn't understand why he was so odd now he couldn't understand why he wasn't fitting in now you all have felt that same feeling amen why am I so odd amen why is it that I don't just fit in like other situations and other people why don't I just fit in because there was something in you that made you different because God who is rich in Mercy now brother BR said that little duck lived in that chicken yard for a long long time he said to one day he walked around the corner and saw a pond for the first time and when he got a scent of that water he realized there's something different about me amen now if you wanted to keep the duck in the chicken yard you should have never let the duck smell water amen and you find out in this last day amen that if you want to keep a believer in an intellectually dry place you better never let them know there's an availability of the quickening power of God because the first time they really ever get a smell of the moving of the Holy Ghost they'll say this is what I've been missing my whole life and they won't understand it amen but they know that there's something in them that was eternal to begin with and whatever that is moving in the room it it is recognizing on the inside of me something that was there is something that is here now brother Ram said it's the same thing with the believer I remember we had our life and it was pasted and those things of the world but once we got a hold of that real thing something quickened us it was a seed come to life now watch these these things are very powerful when you take them as a reality brother man said the word cannot deny itself think of man's filter what made you desire it in the first place is because down in your soul there is a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there and all the father hath given me will come unto to me and I will know and wise cast them out look the prophet is teaching something very carefully God is not nervous about you he is teaching us that God laid the seed himself knowing the power of seed he that's the way he created the Earth and that's the way he created his bride now the prophet tells us this in thinking man's filter what is it he said the germ the seed word from the beginning that was in God in the beginning standing there drawing Seed Life the seed is in Your Heart by for ordination the seed is already in there by the for knowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw nothing else but this word isn't it powerful amen what a wonderful thing Amen to be able to stand here today and say that we're quickened see the word Quicken means to be made alive it means that something is a seed now the farm uh uh the greenhouse folks all know about this amen it's it's it's you could you could have a whole I think you get sprigs mostly but everything that they're selling comes from seed amen and you could you could throw a light Amen on a on a on a whole bed uh of dirt but if there's no seed in the dirt you ain't going to have no crop and you can have the power of God and you can have the baptism of the spirit but if there's nothing in the person it's not going to change them a bit you can have all of God and have no change if there's nothing in the individual to change amen but what we find amen is there is something that caused your change and the devil is constantly trying to make it like up here somewhere you're going to lose what you got and the devil's going to take it from you or something's going to happen and you ain't going to make it but don't you recognize the reason you started it's because God was the one that started that in you he began you with a seed and you was quickened and made alive and I'll say this he that have begun the work is able to finish the work and he knows exactly what it'll take to finish it oh what a wonderful thing it is to be made alive to be quickened from the dead Jesus himself said in Revelation chapter one he says that he was dead but I am alive forever more John you don't have to fear I was dead but now I'm alive amen I think it's powerful and brother bandam thought it was he said to be made alive after death to be made alive after death see what it means is that Jesus himself was quickened and he will send the same life that quickened him he said the power that brought me from the grave I will send it upon you isn't that powerful that Jesus said I was dead but I'm alive and there was something that caused him to be from Death To Life something caused his body that was dead in the Tomb to be Resurrected Ed and the and and the watch now brother R said here's what he's saying and I will send the same power that awakened me I will send it back upon this seed to awaken you amen no wonder in Luke 24 and 49 he said behold I send the promise of my father tearry you and wait in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued from Power upon on high amen so the Holy Ghost is what it was that awoken Jesus Christ because the holy ghost look folks is not emotion the Holy Ghost is not theology the Holy Ghost is God is a person and that person is Elohim and Elohim had a word laid in a tomb and he was saying this is my body so he quickened that body to life to prove the power of the Resurrection in him and then he said whatever it was that woke him I'm going to send it to you now here's the question brother ROM asked in the beginning of this sermon what caused the change amen and whatever caused the change in him is what causes the change in you now I know we've had a had a lot of long years of Theology and Doctrine and everybody's got their own idea what causes change in humanity well let me say this the only thing that'll ever change a human being is the baptism of the Holy Ghost a is the only lasting change that'll ever happen is the seed that is in them must be quickened by the power of God if there is no quickening of that seed there is no changing of that nature but when God quickens a man he quickens him from Death to life again and if God did it for him and he did it for Paul he will do it for you amen it doesn't have to be a special person if the seed is on the inside they might not have social skills they might not have education maybe they got money or they don't have money maybe they got looks or they don't have looks but if they got a SE on the inside of them when the power of the Holy Ghost begins to move there will be a change in that life because the same power that raised Jesus from the dead will also Quicken this Mortal body Romans 8 and chapter uh chapter 8 and verse 11 you just want to pull it up we'll read it together Romans 8 and verse 11 amen do you see what it is it's the same Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken here it is this is Paul in Romans and Ephesians using the word quickened your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you what is it that causes the change he uses the word quicken in Ephesians 2 and in Romans 8 but now he shows you that it was the spirit of God that was the quickening power amen Paul answers the question doesn't he what caused the change he says if the spirit that changed Jesus from Death To Life dwell in you it will also change your bodies or Quicken your mortal bodies and this is the good news folks this is what it was that Jesus sent his disciples to tell the world he T he sent them with good news and I tell you what there's enough bad news is it all right if we preach the good news is it okay if we dedicate TT to Good News this is the place to get good news you can tune in to uh TN n or CNN or Fox News or C all them has news but there's never been news like this news there has never been news like this news that Jesus raised from the dead he said the very gospel itself is to prove to people that he is risen go tell my disciples that I am risen from the dead and I will meet with them to confirm this to them oh God in the last days there'll be a light again on the earth that'll prove to my disciples go tell them that I'm not dead and not a tradition but I am a living Christ and I will meet them do you see the commission on the ministry today is to tell the people of God I know it's been 2,000 years and it's been a gloomy day but in the evening time the same son that quickened those disciples is the same son that'll Quicken this believer in the end time generation listen I'm here to tell you this morning he is not a tradition and you can keep all the Traditions you want but it'll never bring change to your life he is not a Creed you can memorize all the Creeds you want to remember but it'll never change your life he is not a Dogma he is not a church he is a quickening power he is the spirit of Jesus Christ and he will meet you here this morning he promised I will meet you I will meet you in that place I met them because what is it go tell them I'm not dead take my message to the disciples here's the beauty of it it's not my promise so I don't have to make it work I tell you what I'm responsible to do is to preach the gospel come on y'all remember the story of Paul Raider and he said go down there and cut that log and bring it back to the camp he looked at the size of that tree said there's no way I can pack that back to the camp he said then I heard that sweetest voice I ever heard he said Paul there's a river laying next to you and Paul looked at the river and he looked at the log and he had a job to do so he cut down the log and rolled it in the river and got on the log and rode it back to the camp he didn't have to carry it to the camp he rode it into the camp and let me say this morning I don't have to prove this message I'm riding this message I don't have to prove the resurrection I'm riding the resurrection we have took on our White Horse and the sword of the Lord is out of our mouths and I say we are to ride down every enemy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ this is the best news anybody's everever heard in their life he is alive he is not a tradition he is not a church he is not an education he is not shaking hands with a preacher he is a quickening power that will change your existence from Death unto life amen how can it happen listen how if if this is the commission of the church we cannot do it by word only right the gospel came not by word only scripture now he said but power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove it is alive I know people get where they don't like prayer lines and they don't like the moving of the spirit and all that but look folks that's what accompanies the gospel people say well why don't they have it over here why don't I don't know why they don't have it amen other than if you don't water it down it'll produce it right amen I I know sometimes people get excited I've had people say why you get them people all excited well actually it ain't me I'm just preaching the gospel you've noticed me I don't even hardly ask for an amen or I don't make people stand or set or nothing amen we just pre the gospel amen but you got the Liberty to amen or stand or say whatever you want to do it's okay amen but what I mean is there's something else doing that to you it ain't me amen but there's a power that's in this gospel that'll cause people to change their lives it'll stir the heart of a Believer sometimes I know sometimes I'll be sitting over there where Nathan's at right now and and there'll be a word spoken it charges me so much and I almost feel I'm sorry I know as a pastor I should be more dignified but I don't feel very dignified when that anointing starts coming around and all of a sudden I want to just jump up and do a jig and holler Hallelujah why because of the quickening power it ain't got nothing to do with emotion or or somebody seeing me and not seeing me it's the angel of the Lord's using a man's voice and he's speaking directly to my need and I want to know I want him to know I see it I see it's not the man it's the Lord and he's speaking to my heart and he's speaking to my love I'll tell you what it is Amen brother Bram said this gospel El has got power in it manifesting power now the gospel manifest his power there is not another gospel brother BR ties This Together rise of the sun he said I'm surprised so many turn to another kind of gospel yeah which there is no other gospel it's a mate belief it's a denominational fiction it's turning from the good news can you imagine turning from the power and demonstration of almighty God to having a good reading or just have a good lecture or there is not another gospel listen and because I live and I live in you the works that I do shall you doen the works that I will do what a message no one Wonder we've had a dark day of theology but in the evening time there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light in the evening time what is it in the rise of the sun brother Bram said what was it he said see we were living in a darkened world of unbelief now watch he's he's now laid out that the gospel is what Jesus told his disciples so Jesus raises appears to his disciples and sends them out to preach the gospel now brother Bram just divided denominational teaching from the gospel the gospel is a gospel of power manifesting its teachings in the lives of its people that's right he says see but then watched but we were all in a darkened world of unbelief isn't it wow darkened world of unbelief even in a church even in denomination some of you come from denominations you know exactly some of you were in Tradition some was menite we have Amish here we have people were Baptists and some maybe is there any Catholics Among Us that come out of Catholics some Catholics as among and all of them can tell you that they were in a darkened world Amen even though religious there was nothing of light that could get in because amen it blocked out the Master look at this amen it came now watch this because here's the prophet telling us we were in the darkened world he says we were hungering and thirsting and look we joined the Methodist look at their forms we joined the Baptist look at that believe it and you got it nothing to follow it look at this he said We join the Pentecostals isn't that something cuz you'd think for sure CU there noise then they'd be power right amen but brother brand just kills that all together and shows that their noise is a tradition it's not the moving of the spirit I've been there I know I preached I've only been in a couple Pentecostal churches in my life and I preached him one in Arkansas one time and it was like you sitting out in the parking lot and somebody hollered yep woo Glory uh there wasn't nothing in that building I don't mean to make fun of people but it was just a bunch of people H I've been to auctions it was the same atmosphere it's all it was it just somebody hollering and somebody saying get it and somebody go there was no movement there was no power there was nothing behind it it was just a bunch of empty noise like brother BR describe that wagon going across the field there's nothing in it at all amen but people were joining it and their Presbyterians and they were joining it because now I can prove it was just noise and I tell you how I prove it let me preach this word right here in the middle of that noise and it'll quien the whole thing but why don't it quiten you because this ain't just noise this is an eruption of Faith because of the word of God you see what it is and brother R said there they were Pentecostal and Presbyterians and whatever he said and they stood there and we knew something was wrong but we just couldn't find it yet and all the sudden while we were groping in the darkness Resurrection came to us through the manifested word of God Resurrection came to us through the Gospel of Jesus Christ when you're preaching the gospel you are preaching the resurrection power of Jesus Christ listen I'm not an intellectual I'm not a psychologist I'm not a doctor I'm not a doctor of divinity I am not a good intellectual speaker but one thing I know I have met him in the power of his resurrection and it caused a change to come over my life and somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I think you have an error here and I don't think you're good here and I don't think you're listen I don't I had never claimed to be perfect I had never claim to be a perfect man but I do claim this amen what I am not what I need to be or want to be but I'm certainly not what I used to be I know this morning without a shadow of a doubt that something met me and caused a change to come over me what was it the resurrection came and brought us out of denomination the resurrection came and brought us out of Creeds the resurrection came do you see it it came to you and brought you out of denomination it brought you out of creed and some of those denominations might have been right in the message of the hour some of those false teachings that you were involved in that had cut you off from God and made you a follower of a man well we're not following a man we're not following a certain preacher we're not even following the man William brandom We are following the angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ the son of God which was anointed and pushed To Us by the angel of the Lord amen I believe today that there is a Believer on the face of the Earth that has been quickened by quickening [Applause] power Resurrection came to us right we didn't just receive a message it was resurrection that came to us and it came to us through manifested word I tell you what brother bam said he said through manifested word he said what are you going to do pray him down he said you want to see the Lord what you going to do pray him down he said it ain't like that he said he's in you so if you want to see the Lord he said let him manifest through you he wants to use you to manifest through you to show this dead world he is more than a Doctrine he's more than a teaching he's more than a church joining he is the changing of the human being that'll bring life into your body Hallelujah I believe the token is on display in this age through the Bride of Jesus Christ there will come a resurrection for the bright age out of dark denomination be a resurrection out of denomination there will be a message full of maturity and the word has turned it back into its full power because I live you live also see because there's a Resurrection you're alive right because there's a message you live otherwise you'd be subject to whatever it was you were being taught right but Resurrection came to you oh God God rich in Mercy Brother David what came to you what came to you you in the middle why there's other people stayed why not you cuz Resurrection came to you resur Direction came to you brother Aiden that's what happened and it brought change now listen he made us alive by God's quickening power now I love how brother Ram teaches it in the riseing of the sun he says you're resurrected when you receive the holy spirit in you yeah you're already resurrected you know you're already in the resurrection now somebody can run off with that clip and say well brother Wayne he only believes in spiritual Resurrection but you all know me amen we believe in a general Resurrection we believe we're going to me him in the air that's not what Rising the sun's talking about at all brother Ram is talking about the ministry he brought to the Earth is going to bring people out of Pentecostal traditions and restore them back to the word that can change hearts and lives and it was a resurrection and you have received it when you receive the Holy Spirit you're resurrected when the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it has already quickened you to life amen Easter seal the resurrection see we are now in the resurrection we are sitting with him in Heavenly places brother B said see the soul has been resurrected and the Mortal body is on its way to resurrections one for your soul one for your mortal body amen but we find out that our souls have already been resurrected now brother random changes the word and I love how he does things cuz he he makes them so good simple for for me amen I I think he just did it all for me I don't know about you he knew a dumb hbil he was going to preach his message and I had to have something that I could understand so he takes it from quickening power and changes it to the engine of your car so all your mechanics he said you got the car there's your mechanics but you need the Dynamics which is the fire fire gas and compression right that's what you need to make something run amen so so you you had the compression you had the gas he said but see the fire and he and he brings the fire of the car engine as the quickening power that brought Jesus from the grave and he said look you can't have a movement without having both mechanics and Dynamics you can't move without it you can have the best looking Cadillac it could be a gift from God I ain't supposed to tell so I won't you know but but but but but it it could be a gift from God I ain't calling you God but it'll set still Without fire that's and you can look at the electronics and you can look at the seats and you can man it's a beautiful ride but it ain't going to take you anywhere until Fire Hits the plug that's right right and that that is the truth whether it's a Cadillac or a Toyota come on no whether if it's an Asian or if it's an African or it's American it's the truth anyhow if it's a black or a white or a yellow or a blue it doesn't matter what color the car what make the car what model the car if it's going to move it's got to have fire in the engine Church of the Living God we put too much stress on the mechanics while nothing on the Dynamics we need the Dynamics of God in the Church of the Living God he's a Healer but we need to see it happen he's a death Razer but we need to see it happen he opens up blinded eyes but we need to see it happen he's the he's the light he's the light that charges he said too much stress on the mechanics paragraph 104 if you want to look at it he said but it needs Dynamic power the resurrection power dyamic power resurrection power quickening power are you are you catching my my point the holy spirit is that power remember Psalms 110 and there's a willing people in the day of his power what power the quickening power the son of man power the power of God there's got to come one brother BR said a true bride that has both mechanics and dynamics that church will move in the power of the Resurrection my goodness that's the Easter message the Dynamics and mechanics it's not Easter but can it be this morning amen the Dynamics and mechanics come together the mechanics without the Dynamics is no good I like this one and neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics come on that's why I'm standing here reading these things it's not to do away with the Dynamics but if you have the Dynamics without the message it's no good to you but if you got the word and you don't have any fire it's no good to you but if you put the two of them together brother the move is on and may I say this the prophet said thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride in other words he started the car and left it warming up for the bride you're not going out into a cold morning with a dead car he left the car running the Church of the Living God if we're going to go home we got a ride this morning we can ride the bus of God into the presence of God it's been cranked up amen it's ready to go hallelujah it's the truth amen what is it it's here to bring hope the message come to bring hope now brother brand types it here's another Direction he'll take it he'll say look now here it is for you Farmers he said you can have all these Fe Fields out here but when the sun comes up and it goes across the field he said not all the dirt is quickened no he said not all the dirt is quickened but the sun quickens the part of the dirt that holds the seed so you can bring the presence of God but without there being a seed in the dirt it won't do them any good but if a Sun hits dirt with a seed in it something's going to happen you won't have to p up you won't have to prop it up you won't have to make it happen just let the sun shine and you will see the power of God move in the church I believe it I believe the predestinated people there's part of this that is predestinated to life amen I'll tell you what when you start looking at this quickening power amen see what it has done for Jesus it has done for you it has quickened your mortal body look what brother Ram said he said then if the spirit that raised him from the dead the Dynamic word dwells in you ain't that powerful it also quickens your mortal body you used to be a sinner but you're not you used to smoke but you don't you used to sister used to wear those pants and cut but you don't no more what happened to you what caused the change it was Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost over the seed of life that brought you into change there Therefore your body is the Temple of his Dynamics I need a whole service on that don't I your body is a temple of his Dynamics there's something happening in the church and the church is not just this building but the church is you and you're a temple of that Dynamics therefore the Temple of Dynamics from the beginning you're a part of the mechanics there there is your Resurrection the church is the church in the resurrection with him the bodies now are quickened Hallelujah now you brother Wayne that's over my head but it's not it's not look at this brother BR says it like this and when the Dynamics and the mechanics see it comes together a true Eagle will understand that in John chapter 5: 24 he that heareth my words and believeth upon him that sent me hath passed from Death unto life amen passed from Death quickened from Death to life it's the Book of John that's Jesus's words and he that believeth on me hath everlasting life brother man said he that believeth he said now you could believe and go out here he said and your life didn't change at all he said that's not what Jesus is saying he's saying he that understandeth now here's where you got to be careful because I I I I've been through the school already is that you that you can see someone will take a quote like this and then if you if they study a little more than you do or they have a little better understanding in in the knowledge of how scripture lays together or something then they'll they'll show you that you don't have any understanding they have the understanding so then that puts a superiority you got to go to the individual all the time well listen that that that's just not at all what this quote's talking about listen Peter couldn't read or write folks couldn't read or write but he knew the Messiah when he spoke to him he understood remember the woman at the well she understood the same way you understand you can't make all the scripture fit because that's not your calling but something in you understands this is that something in you just agrees come on now you know it's true you can study the word but without the quickener there's no understanding there but when Zoe life is passing through you now this is Brother Ram's teaching when Zoe life is passing to them I give unto them a Zoey life he says watch now he says which moves through you and quickens your mind to this word some reason you changed your baptism quickening power some reason you changed your belief on predestination quickening power see what caused the change quickening power that was a time brother Mike he was in that in that certain denomination what caused the change quickening power the seed took him to a Pentecost right and he could testify this morning the no the noise was there but the life wasn't there but the seed life in him said there's life somewhere so he searched until he found life well that life was in this message amen it awakens the Church of the Living God the spirit quickens the mind to the word of God listen there's some something in you that made you believe it when others are turning it down he says it moves you in that word Jesus was the word manifested on the earth and look what he says he could not do this as a man do you ever think about Jesus saying it is not me that doeth the works but the Father which dwelleth in me he doeth The Works isn't it odd how he showed you a separation between his humanity and what done the works his humanity and what raised him from the dead that's good he was showing you that the quickening power in him was his father yeah and as my father sent me so send I you as a human you can't do these things as a people you can't do this but he sends a quickening spirit to Quicken your mind this is the word see they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover something quickens to you that's the truth that's the word somebody well ask for another age and you say well some reason it's not to me though it's real to me am see something quickens your mind what causes the change is quickening power now uh and I I'll have to maybe sometimes we explain the difference and most of you know me well enough to know that I quite quite believe in a Pentecostal experience I just don't believe asza Street was the original Pentecost and I don't believe the Pentecost we got out here today resembles anything what it wasn't the first church right but a Pentecostal experience began without an ending quot the prophet now it began without an ending and according to the Easter seal it's the only way to confirm the Resurrection The only confirmation of the Resurrection is a Pentecostal experience so it's manifest as its life in you brother R said a Pentecostal experience today is the coming of the Holy Ghost in these last days and it is like like an abstract title deed now watch him lay these thoughts one after the other the whole time he's talking about the Holy Ghost he's telling you it's the fire in your car it's the scream in the eagle it's the sin in the duck of the water it's the it's the life that's in the Jour he's explaining to you what his message is doing for the church and he stands here and says this Pentecostal experience today is like the coming of an abstract and he tells us quickly that the Baptist and the Presbyterians received the ground when they believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ so the ground of Christianity was received through the promise of if you believe on the name of the Lord Jesus thou and thy house shall be saved see they believed on it brother R said and they received the ground he said problem is they never went down to the office and got the abstract for the property so there's all kinds of reasons that they can't have the manifestation of the spirit they can't manifest cuz every time it starts to manifest there's something held against it there's some lean there's some you see they they go down to the ground of the Gospel to get something out of the ground and somebody meets them there and says you can't have that see and because they've got that tradition or because they've got that idea it holds them out of that ground but when a man gets a Pentecostal experience with god he has an abstract to that ground and there is nothing that is held against that individual or the ground itself so you can have everything that's in it because you hold the abstract of it in other words nobody can keep you out of it every promise of it belongs to you how you going to keep me out of healing how you going to keep me out of prayer lines how you going to keep me out of Visions or dreams or interpretation of tongues how you going to keep me out of the N spiritual gift somebody said well we don't believe in those things anymore no you don't believe in them things anymore I believe in those things the Bible believes in these things brother random believes in these things and anybody that's got the abstract to the ground knows they belong to the Church of the Living God they are our possessions by the word of God come on now there's an abstract titley to this brother B said that means every debt is settled and everything that has been struck off all glory he said you might think I act silly but I feel good an abstract deed do you realize what that means do you know what it means brother there is nothing that can take it away from you brother brother Ray screamed out the other day you can't have my tongues you know he said that cuz he's got an abstract for it amen he's got an abstract you can't have my experience I've got an abstract on it you can't have what God's did for me I've got an abstract it belongs to me as an individual you got to get your own you got to get your own abstract you got to get your own experience but I believe every person can have their own experience what is it the property is boughten and you hold the abstract of assurance I love how brother Bram says it paragraph 111 there's there's no devil there's no church there's no theology can overstep the boundaries of God's proof in abstract the baptism of the Holy Ghost recognized Us in Jesus Christ and we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him right I love it he drop down to paragraph 113 he said sure he says there on the day of Pentecost they received the abstract Deed from God it glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of of fire separated upon them they quickened their body till they couldn't even speak an Earthly language it quickened their body to Heavenly language the place they were going quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies until the entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language with a quickening power what something that belongs if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body it will also Quicken your mortal body we are quickened by the power of the Living God tongues quick into a new Heavenly language to speak to them I raptured up raising up into a different atmosphere that's what they had ever lived in amen I tell you what it was it was designed to give them an abstract and it was designed to give you an abstract upon the things of God now don't think I'm losing my balance I'm just following scripture I'm in a series right so if you're in a series now watch this I don't believe we ought to go around these things to satisfy somebody who thinks this is out of balance come on that's what's out of balance when someone starts trying to balance the church this is a balanced assembly just get on board and ride and watch the power of God come down through the church in teaching and healing and manifestations listen if you don't have enough Faith to walk like Enoch just get out of the way while somebody else does if you don't have enough Faith to see the power of God moving in your life get out of the way so somebody else can come on Church we're not out of bance we have found our bance in the D dyamics and the mechanics of the word of God when those two come together it is perfectly balanced in the word of God what did it do it quickened them I love this because we have this Bible we have the we have the example of this Bible amen as a as a history book but also as an example to you and I and brother man said let's see it let's look back and let's see what the quickening power done on them what it did for them let's look back and see what happened amen what happened he said look at Steven and all of them he said' look how that whenever Jesus was dying at the cross the whole bunch of them was afraid everybody was scared everybody was scared to say what they believed everybody was afraid to read that quote everybody was afraid to say they believed in that kind of movement of God but brother R said but when they went into that Upper Room when they come down Peter who was ashamed of the moving of God in Jesus Christ when they came down he looked at them and said this is that which Joel prophesied he lost his fear when he found the quickening power come on brother man said you won't be afraid of this message he said whenever you get quicken in power you won't be afraid amen of this message I believe I believe with all my heart when you see that it's God you'll never be afraid of this you won't be afraid to witness look at Steven standing there in the face of all those critics look at him stand there and the Bible said his a his face shine like an angel brother said what did that mean he knew what he was talking about he knew what he was talking about and a man that's got an abstract knows what he's talking about I don't mean to be mean it's just some people don't have an abstract so they don't know what that means and how can you teach it when you ain't got it how can you preach it when you've not received it but if you've ever had an abstract if you've ever had an experience with almighty God I can tell every person in this building if you get along with God long enough there will come a dynamic power in your life how'll make this message the truth everything in it'll be true somebody said well I don't know if this is true or that's true get an experience with God and you'll know that God wrote it and sent it into this age hallelujah amen what was it that quickening power on stepen didn't make him afraid he stood in the face of critics and said amen now look at Peter preaching he says you stiff neck and uncircumcised of heart do always resist the Holy Ghost and he took them all the way in the scripture where they resisted it where they wouldn't receive it and how they wouldn't get it and the Bible said he made him so mad they picked up stones and begin to Stone him and the man was so full of the quickening power of God he didn't curse them he didn't hit them he didn't get mad at them he just simply looked into the heavens and quickening power and began to say amen I see the heavens opened up and the Jesus standing at the right hand of God I tell you this morning church there is a quickening power that can get on a man until all he can see is Jesus glorified in the presence of God he was ducking stones but he was preaching the gospel I'm not ducking Stones this morning so I'm preaching to the choir got some Stevens I'm preaching to right now heyen look what was happening out brother Bram says it actually happened he says look how that quickening power now brother Bram is the kind of guy to put it on somebody and see how it acted we' seen what it done for stevenh he said let's move over here about Phillip he said he's in the big middle of a Great Big Revival and the Lord sends him down down to one man he said see quickening Power made him follow the inspiration and he goes down to one man and he starts preaching the scripture under quickening power and then he baptizes a man and brother B said he had so fulfilled The Obedience of the Lord he said until you don't see him for a couple hundred miles away he was translated under quickening power of the Holy Ghost listen his body was translated it was not Rapture time it was not time for the rapture but the very thing that will Rapture the church was already in Phillip and it was what was preaching and it was what was baptizing and it was what was causing revivals and that same thing causes a change of the Mortal body Hallelujah he was so full of quickening power till he was changed and translated to another place look that's what quickening power do it changes things I love how brother bandam takes it he said he takes it he goes he goes watch philli quickening power but watch that quickening power on Enoch he didn't just get translated for a few hundred miles he just didn't come back no more he took a walk with God and he just didn't come back he was so full of the quickening power until a man could walk from one dimension to another and it was before the Holy Ghost was given oh Church of the Living God he did it with the Enoch and brother said watch him come right to Elijah he said it was the same quickening power what he's doing is he's showing the power of God's quickening power he said it was the same thing on Elijah it was the same power that was on Elijah and when Elijah crossed he said he looked over the Jordan and he said he could see it coming he could see all the way almost a home from over that Jordan and when he crossed it there was fiery chariots laying there and he said he went and climbed up in one of them chariots and Sister Shelby the quickening power of God caused that man to leave the Earth while Elisha was standing there watching him brother said the quickening power took him up in the Chariot took the coat off of him and threw it back down to Elisha it was quickening power that put the coat on Elisha look at that it was quick brother said it was quickening power I don't know if y'all ever caught that but it was good for me it was quickening power that raised him but it was quickening power that took the rment and put it back upon Elisha it's the same quickening power that raised up Elijah was quickening Elisha in his miracles yall know Elisha doesn't double the Miracles of Elijah right cuz he asked for a double portion and you know brother BR said you could have a double portion not of brother bradam but of Jesus Christ it's it's a double portion it's the first birth inheritance right it's a double portion of the inheritance and you could receive that inheritance through the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the inheritance of the church and look at the beauty of this when Elisha received this he done double the Miracles except one he done double the Miracles except one and and I was reading some time ago and it come to mind this morning amen but somebody was asking about how how many miracles and and and it looks like Elijah done uh uh so many miracles and Elisha done one less than than the double of Elijah but you know it's amazing that just after Elisha dies they bury him in a seler and brother B said but watch now the quickening power that had raised Elijah that had anointed Elisha he said did not leave him in death he said watch him all the way into the SRE they come by one day with a dead man and they threw him in the seler with Elisha and the quickening power that was on the bones of a dead man raised him back from the life and the Bible said he was revived and he stood on his feet isn't that powerful you know what brother Bram says he said he was laying hands on them from the dead he said there he was in the Tomb still laying hands on them he was still such an anointed man that his bones were Anointed with the power of God I say oh anoint our bones anoint our shadows anoint our clothes give us that quickening power Lord Brother B said that was Elisha he said you're the bones of Jesus you know and that quickening power didn't leave him in death brother said watch now Moses was so quickened it didn't leave him in death remember he died in know disob but God let him see it but 800 years later he's standing in the promised land with the Lord himself on Mount Transfiguration brother said see it is there death didn't destroy the promise 800 years later Moses was so full of the quickening power that he was seen in the great land of Jerusalem I'll tell you this if that quickening power was good 800 years after what about Job who stood there on an ash Heap and brother Ram said watch him he said there he is under that Ash Heap his boils upon his body but the quickening power of God fell onto him and he jumped up from the where he was standing and said look look at this though the skin worms eat this body in my flesh I'm going to see God and he knew the quickening power when he said I shall see him for myself I shall see him for myself amen my redeemer is alive yes sir God quickening power was living see when quickening power got on J I'm not left my subject now when quickening power got on John he saw the entire Revelation look look it'll Quicken your mind to the word he saw the entire Revelation and wrote the Book of Revelations it was quickening power that wrote that word it got on Isaiah and he wrote an entire Bible and he seen the millenni him it was because of quickening power because it's what led him look into that now brother brandom takes us through all these and then he said but what has quickening power done in your day we see what it done in the Bible what has it done in your day he said it let me prophesy 6 months before it ever happened and I went up on Mount Sunset and met with seven angels He said what was it up there it was not the intelligence of a man it was the quickening power of God that come to open these Seven Seals what gave us this seal book it's the quickening power of God this is not intellects of man this is not doctrines of divinity this is the quickening power of God come to Quicken the church to the revelation of the son of man that would come forward in this last day what was it that caused William brandham to preach the greatest Revelations that have ever been preached it was quickening power that same same quickening power that caused him to preach the seals is the same quickening power that caused him to look at the storm and tell it to go back where it come from the same quickening power that preached it is the rising of the sun is the same one that looked at a little fish in the water and said little fishy I give you back your life the same quickening power that preached God rich in Mercy it's the same one that looked at Hatty R and said I give you your children in the name of the Lord the same quickening power at priest Jesus of Nazareth also said to Georgie Carter rise up out of your bed after nine years of laying on a bed and she rose up and walked by the quickening power it wasn't just a quickening power of Revelation it was a quickening power of their bodies in their healing in their manifestations of their life it was a quickening power that come upon them listen I I I I I think it's a beautiful thing to see when quickening power begins to move quickening power would move in the church on a Sunday morning brother Ron would be here quickening power would move over brother Tyler and the power of God would drop out but see quickening Power don't stop at the end of church quickening power don't stop when the preaching stops but quickening Power was with them at their house in the middle of their home when the angel of the Lord steps in the room and Troy became manifesting of that spoken word and he spoke to Sarah you can have your healing and right here we are a year later and we're seeing the Divine Healing what was it it was quickening power something spoke it was quickening power that same quickening power brother Mark what was that that what was that that morning it was quickening power what was it in the hall it was quickening power brother Seth what brought you it was quickening power what was it it was quickening power and that same power is right here in this building this morning it'll bring change to your life come on you you don't don't think I'm crazy Brother David what was it the other day when you screamed out in the spirit it was quickening power sister Faith broke out in tongues it was quickening power what was it it's the power of God sister Lia what was it made you come to the altar when you didn't know what me and brother Ray been praying about but it was quickening power that did it and the inspiration began to move over to the church and you said brother Wayne we ain't seen no results yet that's the key word yet yet CU one thing it is I've got an abstract folks and it belongs to me and brother Ericson's got a token and it belongs to him and we're going to claim it and we're not going to back off of it and we're not going to let no devil take it away from us this experience belongs to every believer in this building and we're going to hold it until every person gets it until healing has received until people are raised out of unbelief until it's quickening power and I say it's here this [Applause] morning his quickening power it's the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead what is it could hit a man brother Mike as big as you are and knock him on the ground he'll roll around and cry like a big old baby it's the quickening power of God what was it last Sunday that swept through here and our young ladies started dancing in the spirit amen our dancers let's put it that way the ones appointed of the Lord to dance before the Lord somebody said brother Wayne I Don't Dance that's okay it's not your part one out of every seven was given a certain job that might not be your job but if the Holy Spirit has put it on them amen then I say let the quickening power of God move the way he wants to [Applause] move well okay can I say something here sometimes see you see one manifestation of it and then you see another and you think of one in a different way than you think of the other sometimes Brother Ray gets carried away I sit beside him sometimes sometimes he gets carried away and then I get carried away with him I can't help it he gets under the spirit it puts me under it every time I we must be soulmates or something Hallelujah he'll break out like that now what now what me and him are doing shouting and praising out like that or maybe even crying out in unknown language it's a quickening spirit but when it moves maybe when it moves on Ella it moves differently and she's not crying out but maybe she dances out in the spirit it LO on somebody else different maybe maybe somebody else now I seen it hit sister Hannah and she went to run in the building but you don't know what was being spoke to her you don't know that the angel of the Lord was answering a question for her and it wasn't the man it was quickening power of God we're not up here bragging about what a man can do the only man I'm bragging on is that man Christ Jesus and I say he's not dead I say he has Rose into the heavens and he sits at the right hand of God with the quickening power of the Holy Spirit can move he has many manifestations and many attributes but he's the quickening power of God that was on Steven that was on Elisha that was on Elijah it was on Paul it was on James it was on John it was on William brand it's on Brother Ray it's on me it's on the Church of the Living God and I said we ought to F the Flames of the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and let it [Applause] burn yes I believe I believe we need the Pentecostal power of almighty God what caused the change it was quicking power I went up to the altar one night and that fire come rolling up through the Altar and hit me it was quickening power that was there at night that was quickening power it was quick it's look folks this this is this is real amen it is it's real something is changing you so brother Wayne there's there's there's a a there's an anointing comes through the church sometimes and almost breathtaking what is that quickening power quickening power is what taught the Book of Revelations yes yes are you are you with me when you hear the teaching of the Revelation it's still quickening power when you see the moving of the spirit it's still quickening power what caused the change is quickening power let stand to your feet with us this morning Hallelujah and you who he hath quickened who made alive I I tell you I had some powerful quotes here I get to preach and I I don't have time to read all day but I say this is powerful death don't stop [Music] it oh my brother Daryl death don't stop it quickening power quickening power it don't stop it so I'm pretty sure what you talking about I'm talking about the same thing that met our sister Liz when she come out of the water of her baptism and caused her to live this message is the same thing that'll raise her right out of a grave one of these mornings but Josh death don't stop it one of the last things I've seen out of Rachel was her coming to an altar death don't stop it now to our minds but the change that happens to an individual in the spirit death can't harm that I remember a couple weeks before before the explosion there I remember standing up here and watching sister Rachel came I remember she sitting here somewhere and she went out that door right there one door wasn't there I don't think then but she came and she started walking out and just as she started walking away brother the Nick I looked and there was a white Veil white just as white as this was hooked into her hair and it was hanging all the way down her back and I thought what is that come back in it wasn't there evidently what never was there but I seen it there do you see quickening Power is what causes the change so when you welcome when you welcome quick and EMP power sometimes it comes so different and it's one mightbe more suiting to one person one way and it's just maybe more suiting to another person another way but quickening Power when it comes it's so beautiful that you just make a way for it when it when it begins to move you just make a way for it because that's what happens to our lives Amen brother Ben love him I I love him me because he first Lov me and [Music] P [Music] [Music] oh
