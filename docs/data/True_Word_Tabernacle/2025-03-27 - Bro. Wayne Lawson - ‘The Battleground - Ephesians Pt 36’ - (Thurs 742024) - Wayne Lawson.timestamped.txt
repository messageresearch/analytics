[5:56] Amen. I believe that was why we were
[5:59] created. Amen. To worship the Lord.
[6:01] Amen. And what a tremendous time to
[6:04] serve him and to love him. Amen. It's
[6:06] good to be in the house of the Lord
[6:07] tonight. And Amen. Good to see everyone
[6:09] that could come out on this Fourth of
[6:11] July. Amen. and and uh I know America,
[6:14] we're celebrating our birthday, but it's
[6:16] a good time to come to church and Amen.
[6:19] talk about the liberties that God won
[6:20] for us on the cross. Amen. And what he
[6:23] did for our lives and it's certainly
[6:25] good to be in the house of the Lord
[6:27] tonight. And if we could just bow our
[6:29] hearts in a word of prayer, let's just
[6:31] go to him. Father, we thank you tonight
[6:34] for your grace and your mercy here in
[6:37] this place, Lord. that you would gather
[6:39] us here Lord under your grace and we
[6:43] just ask you Lord that you would bless
[6:45] Lord the congregation that has gathered.
[6:48] I pray to bless them that has Lord seen
[6:50] and the unseen as well that your mercy
[6:53] would be upon them. Lord Isaac is there
[6:57] brother Samuels tonight. May you bless
[6:59] him, bless that congregation, Lord and
[7:02] may the great anointing come and move
[7:04] over him oh God.
[7:07] But we ask tonight, Lord, here in this
[7:10] place that you would just set us aside,
[7:12] Lord, and just as we feel the
[7:14] seriousness of this moment, the
[7:16] opportunity, Lord, to fellowship with
[7:18] you, we ask that you would just lead us
[7:21] into that great place now, Lord, where
[7:25] all things are possible, Lord, where our
[7:28] enemy is powerless. Lord, will your
[7:31] children feel the delivering angel move
[7:33] through the building? Lord, we want to
[7:35] just take a moment and welcome you here
[7:38] in this evening service. Lord, your
[7:40] prophet said that wherever you were
[7:42] invited, you would
[7:43] come. And Lord, you're most certainly
[7:46] welcome here among us tonight, Lord.
[7:49] You're welcome to every pew, to every
[7:51] heart. Lord, and we're just asking that
[7:54] you would just move along this service
[7:56] tonight, touching the needs of your
[7:58] children. Now, Father, as we commit this
[8:00] into thy faithful hands, we pray in the
[8:03] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[8:07] And God bless you. If you have your
[8:09] Bibles tonight, we would like to go on
[8:10] to the book of Ephesians, uh, the sixth
[8:13] chapter. Amen. The book of Ephesians,
[8:15] the sixth chapter. Amen. Is this on?
[8:19] Amen. Ephesians, chapter 6.
[8:25] And we want to look at, thank you, Ben.
[8:27] And we want to look at uh the 10th verse
[8:30] here. Ephesians 6
[8:33] and10. Finally, my
[8:36] brethren, be strong in the
[8:39] Lord and in the power of his
[8:42] might. Put on the whole armor of God
[8:46] that you might be able to stand against
[8:48] the ws of the devil. Now, for we wrestle
[8:52] not against flesh and blood, or against
[8:56] principalities, against
[8:58] powers, against the rulers of the
[9:00] darkness of this world, and against
[9:03] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[9:06] Wherefore take on to you the whole armor
[9:09] of God. Isn't it amazing? He mentions it
[9:11] the second time, that you may be able to
[9:15] withstand in this evil
[9:17] day. and having done all to
[9:21] stand. Stand therefore, having your
[9:24] loins girth with the truth, and having
[9:26] on the breastplate of righteousness, and
[9:27] on your feet shaw with the preparation
[9:30] of the gospel of peace, and above all,
[9:32] taking the shield of faith, where will
[9:34] you be able to quench all the fiery
[9:36] darts of the wicked? and take the helmet
[9:39] of salvation and the sword of the spirit
[9:42] which is the word of God praying always
[9:46] with all prayer and supplication in the
[9:48] spirit watching therefore with all
[9:50] perseverance and supplication for all
[9:52] saints we ask the Lord to bless his word
[9:54] as you could be seated tonight I want to
[9:57] just continue in this Ephesians series
[9:58] here in the sixth chapter I've been
[10:00] spoke to you Sunday on the great
[10:02] spiritual battle and of course tonight
[10:04] we're looking uh of course at the same
[10:07] But I want to talk to you a little more
[10:09] about the battlefield where the battle
[10:11] takes place, the battlefield. And uh and
[10:14] just some things here on our heart. I
[10:16] just want to share with you. And of
[10:18] course um I'm going to be taking some of
[10:20] these thoughts out of the greatest
[10:22] battle ever fought, taking on the whole
[10:24] armor of God and also the contest. Amen.
[10:27] God bless you, brother Frank. Good to
[10:29] see you back there tonight. Amen. And so
[10:32] uh the first thing brother Brandham I
[10:33] think is powerful is uh there in ' 62 in
[10:36] greatest battle. He said I believe the
[10:38] greatest battle that is ever fought he
[10:41] said is now ready to go into
[10:44] action. And we would have thought the
[10:46] greatest battles had already been
[10:47] fought. But here the prophet is telling
[10:49] us that we're coming to the time the
[10:51] greatest battle that has ever been
[10:53] fought is about to begin now. It's about
[10:55] to go into action. Amen. And I believe
[10:58] that that is a spiritual battle of the
[11:00] end time. Amen. Of course, between the
[11:02] right and wrong. And brother Bram tells
[11:04] us in the feast of trumpets how that
[11:05] there's been 200,000,000 demons released
[11:08] uh into the battle. But at the same
[11:10] time, out of heaven come another mighty
[11:13] angel. Amen. And bringing the vindicated
[11:15] word to the church that there was a
[11:17] battle. Amen. And but yet I know this
[11:19] the spiritual battle that rages. Uh a
[11:22] lot of people talk about Armageddon and
[11:24] the greatness of that battle. We're not
[11:26] going to be here for Armageddon. Amen.
[11:28] So, the battle that we're going to have
[11:30] is today. Amen. The the what what we're
[11:32] going through is now. And the prophet of
[11:34] God tells us by being in a battle, he
[11:37] says this, you've got to know your enemy
[11:39] and you've got to know your armor. Amen.
[11:42] If you're going to be in a spiritual
[11:43] battle, you need to know your enemy and
[11:45] you need to know your armor. Amen. Now
[11:48] of course your armor is the word and
[11:51] your enemy is anything that will reason
[11:54] against the word. Amen. That is just
[11:57] very clear. We know our enemy. We know
[11:59] the voice of our enemy. The voice are
[12:02] contrary to the voice of God that it
[12:04] must be the voice of the enemy to
[12:07] confuse us that we would not understand
[12:09] the voice of God when it spoke to us.
[12:12] Now, of course, this the reason that
[12:14] Satan comes this way is because he's
[12:17] found great success in this. Amen.
[12:19] Brother Bram says this. Remember,
[12:21] Satan's tactic to begin with, and he
[12:23] still uses the same thing and still
[12:26] successful with it. It's reasoning.
[12:29] Reasoning, the word was the knockdown
[12:31] punch to the human race. That was what
[12:33] he got Eve with in the Garden of Eden.
[12:36] And he's used that ever since is
[12:38] reasoning. And brother Bam said he's had
[12:40] marvelous success in carrying out his
[12:43] threats by people letting him explain
[12:46] away, amen, the value of God's promised
[12:49] word to the age. Now, of course, Satan's
[12:52] army is going to bring they're going to
[12:53] bring confusion. Satan's army is going
[12:56] to bring destruction. Satan's army is
[12:59] going to bring sickness. Amen. And he
[13:01] uses his army of destruction to bring
[13:04] disbelief in God's word because what he
[13:06] would like to do is set up a better
[13:08] kingdom than that of Michael. Amen. But
[13:10] the prophet of God says, "But God cast
[13:12] him out." And I I think that's powerful.
[13:15] God cast him out. Because he's teaching
[13:17] you, Amen, that Satan's method was
[13:19] reasoning, and God's method of dealing
[13:22] with him is casting him out. That's the
[13:25] way God does it. Does it? He don't uh
[13:27] God don't make deals with the devil. He
[13:29] just cast the devil out. Amen. God's
[13:32] method is cast out the evil. Cast down
[13:36] the reasoning. Cast down the
[13:38] superstition. Cast down the weary and
[13:40] cast down the disease. Cast down the
[13:43] sin. See, you're above it. See,
[13:46] resurrected in Christ sitting in
[13:48] heavenly places with every devil under
[13:51] your foot. Amen. If he starts to stick
[13:54] his head in there somewhere, see, he's
[13:56] already been placed under you as you
[13:58] have been raised up into Christ. Now,
[14:01] the same devil exists today that existed
[14:03] then. Amen. And brother Bram says, see I
[14:06] if he does, there is devils and Jesus
[14:09] cast them out. But he gave authority to
[14:12] the church to cast him out. Amen. I know
[14:14] the devil don't like this at all, but
[14:16] the church has been given authority by
[14:18] the word of God to cast out the devil.
[14:21] In Mark the 16th chapter and I just want
[14:23] to read it for you in the 17th verse.
[14:25] The Bible said, "And these signs shall
[14:27] follow them that believe and in my name
[14:30] they shall cast out devils and they
[14:33] shall speak with new tongues." Amen. The
[14:35] Bible said they shall cast out devils.
[14:37] Now, here's the thing. That is
[14:39] scriptural authority tonight. And the
[14:41] heavens and earth could pass away, but
[14:44] the word of God is not going to change.
[14:47] And the scripture gave you an authority.
[14:49] You don't have to feel it. You don't
[14:50] have to make an emotional move of it.
[14:52] Amen. But if you can believe the word of
[14:55] God, you got a position to stand in your
[14:58] authority upon the written word of God.
[15:01] Amen. So is tonight. You don't have to
[15:03] fear the devil. You don't have to fear
[15:05] what the devil can do to you. Amen.
[15:08] Because you have a right to put him out.
[15:10] That's right. See, now many people said,
[15:12] "Well, you know, they got courage or
[15:14] they got strength." But it was maybe
[15:16] back there in the days of Peter when the
[15:18] when the the Pharisees come against
[15:20] Jesus and they were going to take him
[15:22] and the Bible said that Peter of course
[15:24] took his sword and cut off the ear amen
[15:27] of the uh of the Pharisee or of them
[15:29] that was going to catch him the soldier
[15:30] Roman soldier and he was going to catch
[15:32] him and they cut the ear that off. I
[15:34] love how brother Bisll said it one time
[15:36] said I don't know if he was aiming for
[15:37] his ear. Amen. He might have been aiming
[15:40] for his head you know but he just got
[15:42] the ear. Amen. But but you recognize
[15:44] brother Bram said but see he could duel
[15:47] with that sword. And brother Bram said
[15:48] he could whirl that creed like anybody
[15:51] could. He said but when it come to
[15:53] Christian courage he didn't have any of
[15:55] it. He didn't have spiritual courage
[15:57] because as soon as the as Christ went to
[16:00] the cross he stood in the fires remember
[16:02] that of the enemy and denied the Lord
[16:05] Jesus because he didn't have what it
[16:07] took. And the reason he didn't have it
[16:09] is because it was just intellectual. It
[16:11] was an intellectual belief. He he
[16:13] believed on the Lord Jesus, but he was
[16:14] just there. And brother Bam said, "But
[16:16] after that man went up to Pentecost. He
[16:18] put on the whole armor of God." And I
[16:20] think that's exactly what Paul was
[16:22] trying to say in Ephesians 6 when he
[16:24] said put on the whole armor of God, he
[16:26] was talking about getting the baptism of
[16:28] the Holy Ghost. And when a man puts on
[16:30] the armor of God, he'll be a different
[16:33] person. Amen. When he puts on the whole
[16:35] armor, what is it? See, the word that
[16:38] had walked with him, amen, was burning
[16:40] him up with fire in his flesh, in his
[16:43] soul. He had on the whole armor of God.
[16:46] That is God's provided armor. He had the
[16:49] baptism filled with the Holy Ghost. Now,
[16:52] you say, "Church, what is our armor
[16:53] tonight?" Brother Brham said the armor
[16:55] was when Peter got filled with the Holy
[16:57] Ghost and the word that he walked with,
[16:59] Amen, was fire in his soul. Amen. I
[17:03] exactly believe that's the whole armor
[17:04] of God tonight is the baptism of the
[17:07] Holy Ghost. Amen. With the word that's
[17:09] behind it. Now, the church of the living
[17:11] God has been fortified for this battle.
[17:13] You don't believe that God would allow a
[17:15] church to go into or a people to go into
[17:17] a battle. Amen. And not fortify that
[17:20] church. But the prophet of God said,
[17:21] "See, they had been fortified." Now, not
[17:24] with intellectual intellectual education
[17:26] or a doctor's degree, but we've been
[17:28] fortified with a baptism of the Holy
[17:30] Ghost to prove the word of God is truth.
[17:33] Glory. Amen. Amen. That's what it is.
[17:36] See, now, now watch. We can preach the
[17:38] word and we can explain the word, but
[17:40] you have to receive the word. Oh,
[17:42] hallelujah. That's what sets it a fire,
[17:45] brother. When you receive the
[17:46] revelation, something slips out of the
[17:49] unseen world, yonder, and comes rolling
[17:52] down through a mystical channel
[17:54] somewhere into your soul. I like that.
[17:56] Amen. Something slips out of that unseen
[18:00] world and gets down inside of your soul.
[18:02] Amen. That's Amen. That's right. And
[18:04] when something slips into that soul,
[18:07] Amen. it makes you where you're a
[18:09] two-fold being. Now you're dealing with
[18:11] the supernatural world and you're
[18:13] dealing with the natural world. You got
[18:15] the Holy Spirit in you. I love how
[18:17] Brother Brandham says that you're a
[18:18] candidate to be associated with angels.
[18:21] Did you know that? How many got the Holy
[18:23] Ghost in here tonight? You're a
[18:25] candidate to associate with angels. Now,
[18:27] don't feel don't feel a surprise. Amen.
[18:29] If you feel a an energy in the service,
[18:32] a special anointing or or a power sweeps
[18:35] over you. How many ever been sitting
[18:36] service and it happened? Amen. And you
[18:38] just been listening to the word of God
[18:39] and something just surge across you. But
[18:42] don't you dismiss that to emotion. Amen.
[18:44] Or some this just little excitement
[18:46] somewhere. But according to a prophet,
[18:48] what is happening is you're associating
[18:51] with angels. That's right. He said, "Now
[18:54] people can't believe in these things."
[18:56] He said, "Because they've never come in
[18:57] contact. They got nothing in there to
[19:00] believe with. But when your Holy Spirit
[19:02] comes in the heart, you become a twofold
[19:04] being. One on the earth to die and one
[19:06] in the heaven to live." He said, "This
[19:08] body is still now seal subject to
[19:11] death." Now, this is really important.
[19:12] You're a two-fold being. We're talking
[19:14] about battles. You're a two-fold being.
[19:16] One in the earth to die, the other in
[19:19] heaven to live. See, this body is still
[19:22] subject to death. Amen. You're still in
[19:26] this body. Now, you got a soul in there
[19:28] that is heaven bound. You got a soul in
[19:31] there that's already redeemed, but
[19:32] you're living in a body that is subject
[19:35] unto death. You're living in a body
[19:37] that's contacting this earth. See, he's
[19:40] passed from death unto life. He has his
[19:41] earthly contact with five senses in his
[19:44] spirit. Brother Ram said a contact with
[19:46] God through the Holy Ghost and the
[19:48] angels of God visit him. He speaks with
[19:50] him. These messengers are sent to God to
[19:52] reveal messages from God to an
[19:55] individual. How many knows that's a
[19:56] ministering spirits?
[19:58] The prophet says ministering spirits
[20:01] minister under the heirs of salvation.
[20:03] So, as a believer, as a as a bornagain
[20:06] believer, you are an association with
[20:09] angels that ministering spirits can
[20:11] minister to your soul, but you're living
[20:14] in a human body that is in this earth.
[20:17] So, you you you're going to find out as
[20:19] long as you're here, there's going to be
[20:21] a battle. There's going to be a battle
[20:23] between right and wrong. There'll be a
[20:25] battle between a heavenly and an
[20:27] earthly. Amen. There'll be a carnal man
[20:29] and there's a spiritual man. And there's
[20:31] going to be a battle, of course. But
[20:33] listen, God did not put you into this
[20:36] battle without fortifying your soul.
[20:38] Amen. So as that you could come
[20:40] victorious by the power of God. Amen.
[20:42] Now I know this. The spirit of Christ is
[20:44] here. He says, "Now, brother Bam said, I
[20:47] just went into another world and seen an
[20:48] unseen world." And we become so
[20:51] conscious of looking at one another like
[20:54] this, but there is an unseen world. We
[20:58] become so conscious sitting here tonight
[21:00] looking at one another. We get so
[21:03] affected, so conscious of that we're
[21:05] here, but we're so unconscious of the
[21:08] supernatural world. We become so
[21:10] unconscious of what is going on in the
[21:13] realms that are around us. Now,
[21:14] biblically, we can sit here and tell you
[21:16] without one shadow of doubt, Jesus said,
[21:19] "Wherever two or three are gathered in
[21:20] my name, there I am in the midst of
[21:22] them." Now whether you feel him, whether
[21:24] you're emotional, whether you feel the
[21:26] contact of him, whether your human body
[21:28] feels him or not, he's right here in
[21:30] this building right now. Amen. And if
[21:33] you can recognize his presence and begin
[21:35] to tell that devil, you get off of my
[21:37] shoulder. I'm going to enjoy this
[21:39] service. God's got something here for me
[21:41] tonight. There's an unseen presence.
[21:43] There's an unseen realm. They're
[21:45] bringing message for me. Amen. If you're
[21:47] sitting here with sickness in your body,
[21:49] there's a delivering angel in the
[21:51] building. If you're sitting here and
[21:53] you're bound in your spirit with some
[21:54] doubt or some unbelief, there's a
[21:56] deliverer in the building, you've got to
[21:58] become conscious of God and what he is
[22:01] in this building tonight to deliver you.
[22:04] I don't believe we drove up here on a
[22:05] Thursday night just to sit here and look
[22:07] at one another. But we've come to
[22:09] associate with an unseen world and feel
[22:11] the power of that unseen world as it
[22:14] swirls through this building to
[22:16] electrify our inside to conquer the
[22:19] diseases and the oppressions and the
[22:21] anxieties and the nervousnesses that are
[22:24] trying to attack us from every which
[22:26] way. But listen, there is an unseen
[22:28] world and we become conscious of one
[22:30] another. We we're so conscious that
[22:32] we're here. Amen. But right in this
[22:34] building are evil spirits.
[22:37] Right in this building are evil spirits.
[22:39] Now you know you know there's doubting
[22:42] spirits. There's unbelief spirits.
[22:44] There's critical spirits. There's
[22:46] jealousy and there's enginess and
[22:47] there's strife and every kind of evil
[22:50] spirits trying to invade. Amen. I I love
[22:52] how brother Brandham tells us this. He
[22:54] said, "Listen now. You can't help what
[22:56] comes into your mind." He said, "You
[22:59] just got to keep it from nesting there."
[23:01] Like the old farmer standing out there
[23:03] and the blackbirds flying over and he
[23:05] goes in and gets his shotgun. No boy
[23:07] said, "What are you doing?" He said,
[23:08] "Well, I can't keep them back birds from
[23:10] flying through my trees." He said, "But
[23:12] I certainly ain't going to let them nest
[23:14] there." So, you're sitting here tonight
[23:16] and you, whether you want it or not,
[23:19] there's going to be things come through
[23:21] this room and you being a spirit are
[23:23] going to come through your mind. They're
[23:25] going to come through your spirit. But
[23:27] when they do, you've got to open up with
[23:29] a blasting of the Holy Ghost and say,
[23:31] "Satan, that's a lie. Satan, I won't
[23:33] believe you. faith that I'm going to
[23:35] accept the word of God in the church
[23:37] tonight. You see what it is? Something
[23:40] begins to energize your faith because
[23:42] your faith is exactly what connects you
[23:45] to the unseen realm. Listen, I I found
[23:48] out this brother says, "Watch how in was
[23:50] it fro from the beginning?" I think it's
[23:52] powerful. He said, "The Lord in his work
[23:54] never claimed to do nothing of himself,
[23:57] but when he seen the father do it, he
[24:00] said he gave all praise to God." Amen.
[24:04] Amen.
[24:06] Now, what was that? He says the thing
[24:09] was unnatural. It was supernatural.
[24:12] That's why Jesus said, "I don't do the
[24:14] works. My father does them." Because,
[24:17] watch now, he was giving all praise to
[24:20] the supernatural. He wasn't bringing any
[24:22] praise into the natural. In other words,
[24:24] it's not what I'm doing naturally, but
[24:26] it's the unseen that is activating and
[24:29] is working in your midst. Every brother
[24:32] said it was the unnatural. the
[24:33] supernatural and every armor that we
[24:36] have, brother. All of our armor is
[24:39] supernatural.
[24:42] See, it's the unseen something that's
[24:45] the whole armor. We stand in the unseen
[24:47] world looking at the unseen things. Do
[24:50] you see? Now the Bible says in 2
[24:53] Corinthians 6:10, "And sorrowful yet
[24:56] always rejoicing, pure, poor," he said,
[24:58] "Yet making many rich, as having
[25:02] nothing, yet possessing all things."
[25:06] Having nothing, possessing all things.
[25:08] Now, we're sitting here tonight. You
[25:10] say, "Well, you know, I I don't have
[25:11] anything. I don't have this or But the
[25:13] prophet of God takes that scripture and
[25:15] preaches a message called possessing all
[25:17] things." So sitting here tonight, you
[25:20] might not have natural possession, but
[25:23] you have spiritual possession. And the
[25:25] prophet of God said, "The believer's
[25:27] promise is in eternal life." He says,
[25:29] "Look, it's joy and peace and
[25:32] longsuffering and gentleness and
[25:33] patience. It's the fruit of the spirit,
[25:36] divine healing, a dozen things I've got
[25:39] written down here. That is your
[25:41] possession. It belongs to you. But you
[25:44] cannot have it until you fight for it.
[25:47] It is yours. Everything that is seen and
[25:49] every temple thing belongs to me. God
[25:52] give it to me because Christ gave it to
[25:54] me. And things unseen belong to me. I
[25:59] love that. Things that are unseen belong
[26:01] to me. Listen, the devil chose your
[26:04] mind. God chose your heart. The devil's
[26:06] trying to make you see things by your
[26:08] mind. And God is trying to get you to
[26:10] see it by your heart. Because the Bible
[26:12] said, "As a man thinkketh in his heart,
[26:15] so is that man." See, what he's doing is
[26:17] he's trying to get you in your heart to
[26:19] receive the word of God. Amen. And if
[26:21] you can get it in your heart, you're
[26:23] healed. You're healed. If you can get it
[26:25] in your heart, you're saved. You're
[26:26] saved. If you can get it in your heart,
[26:28] you're delivered. You're delivered. If
[26:30] you're If you're sitting here without
[26:31] joy, and something comes in your heart,
[26:33] I got joy. Amen. It belongs to you
[26:36] because you believe it from your heart.
[26:38] It don't matter what the devil says in
[26:40] your mind. What is your heart saying to
[26:42] you? Your heart is there because brother
[26:45] Bam said the devil tried to take your
[26:46] mind but God chose your heart. That's
[26:49] why we cast down the reasoning of the
[26:51] mind. See, we look at what God said and
[26:54] who gave the promise. That's where the
[26:56] world gets so tangled up today. It's too
[26:59] much intellectual preaching.
[27:02] Instead of spiritfilled church
[27:05] worshiping in the spirit, they're
[27:07] listening to intellectual messages.
[27:10] Amen. The prophet of God said, "The
[27:11] problem with it is we got too many
[27:14] intellectual sermons and not enough
[27:16] spiritfilled worship." Amen. I believe
[27:19] tonight what we need is spiritfilled
[27:20] worship. We don't need an intellectual
[27:23] relationship in our mind. We need a
[27:25] spiritual relationship in our hearts. If
[27:28] you want to put on the whole armor of
[27:30] God, it's not memorizing every book and
[27:32] never quote the prophet quoted. It's
[27:34] taken the life that brought the word and
[27:37] put that life on the inside of you. And
[27:40] you can use what words you know. Amen.
[27:42] David didn't have a bunch of rocks. He
[27:44] had one rock or five. But it but it
[27:46] didn't take all of them. It took one.
[27:49] And it just takes one revelation to whip
[27:51] the devil on the grounds when God gives
[27:53] it to you. It's not a it's not an
[27:55] intellectual battle. It's not who's the
[27:57] smartest preacher and who knows the most
[28:00] quotes and how they can quote them.
[28:01] Amen. There's an angelic association
[28:04] with the power of God that energizes and
[28:06] and makes the word come alive and it
[28:09] flashes like lightning when the power of
[28:11] God gets a hold of a believer and it
[28:13] begins to change their lives. And you
[28:16] said, "Brother Wayne, amen. I possess
[28:17] it." Yes, you possess it. You're the
[28:19] seed of Abraham. And just as Abraham
[28:21] possessed it, you possess it. But
[28:22] Brother Bram said, "You're going to have
[28:24] to fight for it. You're an heir to it,
[28:26] but you're going to have to fight for
[28:27] it." Now, I'm I'm I hope you're hearing
[28:30] me tonight. You're an heir to a blessing
[28:32] in this building tonight. You're an heir
[28:34] to a spiritual blessing, but you may
[28:36] have to fight for it. You may have to
[28:39] fight for every inch of ground that God
[28:41] has given you. Well, listen. I don't
[28:43] know about you tonight, but I'm not
[28:44] going to lay down and let the devil have
[28:46] anything that belongs to me. I'm not
[28:48] going to lay down and let the devil take
[28:50] anything that belongs to me. Amen. And
[28:53] if it belongs to me, listen, devil, you
[28:55] got to fight on your hands. And I'm not
[28:57] going to fight you with my mind. I'm not
[28:59] going to fight you in the intellect. I'm
[29:01] going to drop down into the anointed
[29:03] word and stand with the scripture and
[29:06] show that Satan has lost the battle
[29:09] already by the power of God. That's
[29:11] right. Amen. If you ever get it, you
[29:13] ain't going to get it easy. You're going
[29:15] to have to take it away from Satan.
[29:18] Amen. Is Satan got something belongs to
[29:20] you tonight? Amen. That you need to take
[29:22] back from him. Listen, let me say this.
[29:25] You might not get it easy, but I'm going
[29:26] to tell you, don't you lay there. You
[29:28] need to fight. Get some fight in you.
[29:31] Get some strength in you. Get some
[29:33] stamina in you. Get some fight back. Not
[29:35] a lay down. Not it. It's the battle's
[29:38] too hard. There's too much trouble. It's
[29:40] too much struggle, Brother Wayne, to get
[29:42] through it. Forget that and fight until
[29:45] you get the victory in your life and in
[29:47] your heart. Listen, I believe it
[29:49] tonight. I believe it's yours. I believe
[29:52] if Satan captures your health, you've
[29:54] got a right to say to Satan, "Give it
[29:56] back.
[29:59] Amen. Anybody want to say it tonight?
[30:00] Give it back.
[30:02] Give it back, Satan. You can't hold it.
[30:05] You can't have it. Give it back. It's my
[30:08] health. I want it back. It's my child. I
[30:10] want it back. It's my mind. I want it
[30:13] back. It's my life. I want it back. It's
[30:16] my peace. I want it back. It belongs to
[30:19] you. You don't have to lay there and
[30:21] take it tonight. You don't have to sit
[30:23] and let Satan take your joy. Amen. Do
[30:26] you recognize many times people sit
[30:28] right in the church and they think they
[30:30] need salvation? Brother Ronnie, I found
[30:32] out a long time ago, it's really not
[30:33] always salvation we need. It's the joy
[30:36] of our salvation. Sometimes what we need
[30:38] is the joy of our salvation back. You
[30:41] remember the kind used to put you on
[30:43] your feet and Amen. the word of God.
[30:45] Amen. You You remember that kind of joy?
[30:47] You remember the joy before the battle,
[30:49] the joy before the trouble, the joy
[30:51] before the sickness. I say, "Satan, it's
[30:54] my joy. Give it back in the name of
[30:56] Jesus Christ. Let the joy of the Lord be
[30:59] the strength of the church. I believe
[31:02] it. I believe tonight that he ought to
[31:04] hand it over in the name of the Lord
[31:06] Jesus, possessor of heavens and earth.
[31:09] I'm heir. Give it back.
[31:12] Give it back. I'm an heir of all things.
[31:15] It's been given to me and I claim
[31:18] everything that God promised
[31:20] me. Now listen, I I I know you say,
[31:23] "Well, brother Wayne, this is
[31:23] evangelical." It's not. This is heavy
[31:25] teaching. This is very strong and heavy
[31:28] teaching. This belongs to you and you're
[31:30] going to have to take it back. I'm
[31:32] teaching you that this is your God-given
[31:34] property and you need to take it back.
[31:37] You need to quit laying down and letting
[31:39] a little argument steal the joy out of
[31:41] your life. Letting some little fuss take
[31:43] away all the worship and all the power.
[31:46] Listen, Satan, you don't have enough to
[31:48] take it from the church of the living
[31:50] God. God give it. We own it. And we're
[31:53] going to keep it by the glory of God.
[31:55] That's right. Glory, Satan. You lay it
[31:58] down. Brother Bam says it. He said,
[32:00] "Listen, God gave it to us. It's an
[32:03] unmarited gift.
[32:05] Don't you like that? It's an unmarited
[32:08] gift." What's that mean to you? It means
[32:10] you didn't earn it. So, if you didn't
[32:13] earn it, you can't lose it. Jacob, you
[32:15] need to tell the devil, "Go back where
[32:17] you come from. I didn't earn it and you
[32:19] can't take it. It was given to me. It is
[32:22] a gift from God. It is bought and it's
[32:24] paid for. It is an unmmerited gift. It's
[32:27] ours. It belongs to us and Satan can't
[32:29] hold it. If you go to him, brother Bam
[32:32] said this with a scriptural
[32:33] authoritative word with faith to say
[32:36] it's mine. Lay it down. Glory. I like
[32:39] that. Don't you, Satan? Lay it down. You
[32:41] took it from me. Give it back. I'm
[32:44] serving notice on you. I've got the
[32:47] notice of the written word here on the
[32:52] word. Glory to God. When's the last time
[32:55] you picked a scripture up and you knew
[32:56] it was yours? And you just walk right in
[32:59] the face of Satan. Said, "Satan, he gave
[33:01] it to me right here." And I tell you
[33:03] what, you lay it down cuz I'm about to
[33:05] take it home with me tonight. You lay it
[33:07] down because it belongs to me. Brother
[33:09] Bam said, "Get that devil started. You
[33:12] get that devil started and keep him
[33:13] running. Of course, you might not
[33:15] receive nothing physical when you begin
[33:17] to do that. Brother Bam said, one person
[33:19] said, well, you know, they got saved. He
[33:21] said they didn't receive anything
[33:22] physical. Didn't didn't look any
[33:24] different. He said, but this thing, he
[33:26] said, they said, well, let's wait and
[33:27] see what it's like tomorrow. Brother man
[33:29] said, wait nothing. He starts He said,
[33:31] start confessing.
[33:33] Now, watch this. Because he says, you
[33:35] got to confess it before it's a finished
[33:37] work. See, Jesus is the high priest of
[33:41] our confession. And I know this sounds
[33:43] odd to the human mind because we want to
[33:45] wait for the doctor's report to start
[33:47] saying he's healed. We want to wait for
[33:50] the doctor's report before we can start
[33:52] worshiping God for our healing. But
[33:55] listen, we've already been given a
[33:56] report. In Isaiah 53, he said, "Whose
[33:59] report will you believe?" Well, I don't
[34:02] know about you, but I believe the report
[34:03] of the Lord. And the Bible said, "By his
[34:06] stripes, you are healed." And Amen. You
[34:09] were wounded for our transgressions and
[34:10] you were bruised for our iniquity and by
[34:13] his stripes we're healed. In other
[34:14] words, every person sitting in this
[34:16] building right now is saved by the blood
[34:19] of Jesus Christ. And if I could get you
[34:21] to believe that, there's not one unsaved
[34:24] person will leave this building tonight.
[34:26] And the same one that saved you is the
[34:28] same one that heals you. And he healed
[34:31] our bodies tonight. And if we could
[34:33] believe it, Amen. Amen. There's not a
[34:35] person would leave this building tonight
[34:36] sick in their body. There's not a person
[34:38] watching me tonight that would leave
[34:40] sick in their body because by his
[34:43] stripes we are healed. Not we're going
[34:45] to be. We already are. We're healed by
[34:48] the stripes that Jesus took. I'll tell
[34:51] you it might not come easy, but let's
[34:52] fight for it. Let's tell that rotten
[34:55] devil, it's mine. It belongs to me. I'm
[34:57] not backing up. I'm not giving up. I'm
[34:59] not laying down. I'm going to keep
[35:00] moving.
[35:03] Well, glory to God. Amen. Listen. I know
[35:07] what it's like sometimes when you get
[35:09] around certain people, it's harder to
[35:11] make your
[35:13] confession. Even good Christians, y'all
[35:17] know what I'm talking about. You get in
[35:19] the presence of some old unbelieving
[35:20] spirit. You get in the presence maybe
[35:22] even your by yourself and some old
[35:24] doubting spirit. Do you know even Mary
[35:27] fell under that after she birthed Jesus
[35:31] Christ? Ain't that ain't that wild?
[35:34] Mary, remember she left
[35:36] Jesus. Zach says she was a horrible
[35:39] mother. He's calling her Jesus. Mary,
[35:41] the mother of God, the greatest mother.
[35:43] Jesus said, "Well, mother Zach says she
[35:44] a horrible mother. She left her kid for
[35:48] days." And when they went back to find
[35:50] Jesus, remember what she said? "Your
[35:53] father and I, your father and I have
[35:56] searched for thee many days." And
[35:57] brother Bam said, "Look at how wrong
[35:59] Mary was. Look at how Amen. I I'll say
[36:03] what she said. He brother Bam said, he
[36:05] said, "See, your father and I, she be to
[36:08] claim that the birth wasn't
[36:10] supernatural."
[36:11] She claimed that it wasn't supernatural.
[36:14] She denied the supernatural birth. And
[36:16] that's what Pentecost done. They took
[36:18] speaking in tongues and denied the birth
[36:20] of the word. That's exactly. He said,
[36:22] "I'll take so much of it, but I don't
[36:24] want the rest of it." They denied the
[36:26] birth of the word just like Mary did.
[36:28] But watch, there will not be any more
[36:30] organizations after this. Watch the word
[36:33] itself. 12 years old back there in a
[36:36] shock. He said, "Don't you know I'll be
[36:38] about my father's business." The word
[36:41] corrected the church right there. What
[36:43] are you doing all these things? See, you
[36:46] know you can't do this. Well, look up at
[36:48] our doors and we'll let you come in. For
[36:50] ye know that I must be about my father's
[36:52] business. Sure. True. Supernatural.
[36:55] Watch what happened. Mary got in the
[36:57] presence of people where she couldn't
[36:59] hold her
[37:00] confession. And when she did, the church
[37:03] can make an error, but not the word.
[37:06] Look at the word correct her. At 12
[37:08] years old, he corrected her and brought
[37:10] her back to the true supernatural, the
[37:13] birth, the virgin birth of the word of
[37:15] God. And when and when she did, brother
[37:16] Ram said, "Mary was so wrong, but the
[37:18] word is so perfect."
[37:21] What did she do? Uh uh Beth and I were
[37:24] talking about this the other day. What'
[37:25] she do? Amen. She absolutely tore the
[37:28] foundation out from her testimony. Look
[37:31] at what she did. She took the
[37:32] supernatural out of her testimony. She
[37:35] still testified Jesus was her son, but
[37:37] she took out the supernatural part. And
[37:40] that's exactly what we do if we're not
[37:42] careful. We'll take the supernatural
[37:44] part out of our confession. We'll take
[37:46] the supernatural part out of our service
[37:49] and bring it to a dry intellectual
[37:52] thing. But listen, amen. There was an
[37:54] angel that had testified to her that it
[37:56] was a supernatural thing and the word
[37:58] was still testifying. It was a
[38:01] supernatural thing. I'll say something
[38:02] to you tonight. That same supernatural
[38:05] is here. Amen. And I won't tear the
[38:07] testimony out of the church and say it's
[38:10] just intellect or it's just a good
[38:12] preacher or it's just a good quote. It's
[38:14] a supernatural being of almighty God
[38:17] that has come to deliver the church with
[38:20] power and with reality. Do you see what
[38:22] it is? Sometimes your supernatural
[38:25] testimony, amen, it's so different to
[38:28] the world. I think of the prophet of
[38:29] God, but he talks about Simeon who stood
[38:31] there and said, he says, "Oh my," he
[38:34] said, "I'll not die till I see the
[38:35] Lord's Christ." He said, "Listen to that
[38:38] testimony." People thought he was crazy.
[38:40] He says, "See, but but when you take the
[38:42] word and believe his promise, it's so
[38:46] supernatural till it becomes crazy to
[38:49] the world."
[38:51] taking the word and believe it becomes
[38:53] so supernatural you're crazy to the
[38:56] world. You're sitting there testifying
[38:58] you're healed while you're physically
[39:01] sick.
[39:04] Crazy. You got temptations and you're
[39:06] saying, "Oh, I'm saved." But to the
[39:09] world, it's crazy. But to the believer,
[39:13] it's been quickened by the power of God.
[39:15] Now, you got to hold your testimony.
[39:17] Brother Bam said, "Listen, hold your
[39:19] testimony. If you're a Christian, as
[39:21] long as you believe it, all right. But
[39:24] the minute you begin to think you're
[39:25] not, that time is where you start
[39:27] sinking right there.
[39:31] That's the time your testimony is
[39:33] negative. Divine healing lasts as long
[39:35] as your faith lasts. See, with salvation
[39:38] the same because everything of God is by
[39:42] faith and nothing of God can be proven
[39:45] by the natural. Amen. Watch. The whole
[39:49] armor of God is
[39:52] faith. The whole armor of God is love
[39:55] and joy and peace and gentleness. See,
[39:57] just look. God gives everything. And
[40:00] that armor is supernatural. Everything
[40:02] to protect you is supernatural. It's a
[40:06] supernatural battle. You've got to fi
[40:08] fight in supernatural realms. It can't
[40:11] be fought in the natural. Amen. It must
[40:14] be fought in the supernatural. I love
[40:16] how it is in Revelations the 12th
[40:18] chapter when Daniel when John is writing
[40:20] here in Revelation 207 12 and 7 he said
[40:23] there was war in heaven and Michael and
[40:26] his angels fought against the dragon and
[40:28] the dragon fought against his angels and
[40:30] prevailed not and neither was their
[40:33] place found anymore in heaven. And the
[40:37] great dragon was cast out the old
[40:39] serpent called the devil and the Satan
[40:40] which deceiveth the whole world. He was
[40:42] cast out in the earth and angels were
[40:44] cast out with him. And I heard a loud
[40:46] voice from heaven saying, "Now has come
[40:48] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[40:50] of our God and the power of his Christ
[40:52] and the accuser of our brethren is cast
[40:53] down which accused them before God day
[40:56] and night." Now watch this. And they
[40:59] overcame him. Now it's very important
[41:01] that you take a moment and ask, "Who are
[41:03] they?" Y'all remember years ago I
[41:05] preached a whole sermon nearly on they.
[41:07] Amen. meaning that it wasn't an abstract
[41:10] thought, but they overcame him. Now, you
[41:13] take that word they, it's a pronoun
[41:15] speaking of a certain people. Who are
[41:18] those people? Those people are the same
[41:21] people in Matthew 25 that are the wise
[41:23] virgin. Those are the same people that
[41:26] are in Matthew 24 that would deceive the
[41:30] very elect if possible. Those are the
[41:33] same people in Revelations 12. They
[41:35] without us cannot be made perfect. of
[41:37] Revelations 11. You see, it's the same
[41:39] people in Revelations 3 that the Bible
[41:42] said, "And they overcame and shared with
[41:45] the throne of God." They are a group of
[41:47] people called the bride of Christ who
[41:50] was elected before the foundation of the
[41:52] world to come into this battle. And they
[41:55] overcame him. Who is him? The Antichrist
[41:58] spirit. The religious spirit of this age
[42:01] has been overcome by a group of people.
[42:04] And how are they going to do it? by the
[42:06] blood of the lamb.
[42:09] I'm y'all y'all know it take an hour to
[42:11] preach the thought, but it's by the
[42:13] blood of the lamb. So why would you
[42:15] start trying to perfect yourself in the
[42:17] flesh? Why would you start measuring
[42:19] yourself by a standard of your own rules
[42:22] when everybody has a different standard?
[42:25] Everybody has a different degree of
[42:27] standard, a different degree of law.
[42:28] Amen. But God said all man has come
[42:31] short of the glory of God. Every man has
[42:33] sinned and every man needs the blood of
[42:36] Jesus Christ. Then therefore nothing do
[42:39] I bring. Amen. It's only to the cross
[42:41] that I cling. It's only the blood that
[42:43] I'll accept for my salvation. Listen,
[42:46] people think today, well, if I quit
[42:47] smoking, if I quit chewing, if I quit
[42:49] drinking, if I quit lusting, if I quit
[42:51] going after this, and if I quit doing
[42:53] this, then surely I'll be saved. You can
[42:55] do all of that and not have Jesus. But
[42:57] listen, it'll take Jesus to save a man.
[43:00] It'll take the blood of Jesus Christ to
[43:03] save you and to fill you with the Holy
[43:05] Ghost. And that is where you get
[43:07] salvation. It's not in the doing or the
[43:10] not doing. It's in the the coming into
[43:12] the body of Christ. And by one spirit,
[43:15] we're baptized into one body. And that
[43:18] body being the body of Jesus Christ, you
[43:21] come into him by the blood word. The
[43:24] spirit of God burst you into that body.
[43:27] And you overcome that devil by the
[43:29] blood. It doesn't just say by the blood,
[43:32] but it said and by the word. And by the
[43:34] word of their testimony. I love that. By
[43:38] the word of their testimony. In other
[43:40] words, there was somebody going to hold
[43:42] the testimony. Somebody's going to keep
[43:44] the confession. Somebody's going to
[43:46] confess this word in the opposition of
[43:49] the greatest battle that has ever been
[43:51] fought. But somebody's going to believe
[43:53] it anyhow. Somebody's going to raise up
[43:56] in faith and confess the word. Though
[43:59] darkness has surrounded us, sickness has
[44:01] surrounded us. Nervousness is
[44:03] everywhere. Depression is on every
[44:05] corner. But I still believe. I still
[44:08] believe that God is a deliverer and can
[44:11] bring a sound mind and a clean heart. He
[44:14] can bring a healed body. It's by the
[44:18] word. Somebody say by the word of their
[44:22] testimony. In other words, they were
[44:24] willing to hold their testimony. They
[44:26] were willing to testify. Listen, the
[44:28] prophet of God said it like this. If I
[44:30] die tonight, my testimony is true.
[44:34] I love that. When you have a
[44:37] testimony, God has given you a sword in
[44:41] your hand. Amen. What are we doing?
[44:44] We're conquering sickness and
[44:46] superstition and every evil. And what
[44:48] are we doing? Amen. We've been given a
[44:51] sword for this battle. That sword is the
[44:55] word of God. And show us the father.
[44:58] Brother Brandham said this like this.
[45:00] Jesus Christ died at Calvary and
[45:02] stripped him of everything he had. And
[45:04] the only thing tonight he's got is a
[45:06] bluff.
[45:09] Somebody's got to keep up the
[45:11] testimony. Well, I I I don't feel like
[45:13] he's a bluff right now, Brother Wayne.
[45:15] Somebody's got to keep the testimony.
[45:17] He's a bluff. Have you ever thought
[45:20] about the battle we're in is not just a
[45:22] battle in the supernatural, but it's
[45:24] also a legal battle. And the prophet of
[45:26] God goes over it again and again as a
[45:28] legal battle and brings Satan to a
[45:31] debate on the word of God and says, "You
[45:33] have no legal rights whatsoever." Amen.
[45:37] What is it? His day is finished. I love
[45:40] how the prophet says it. You are
[45:42] defeated and you have lost the battle.
[45:45] Right. Now, I think it's powerful
[45:47] tonight to know that Satan has lost the
[45:50] battle. Do you see? Everything lays in
[45:54] the hand of the church. Satan has lost.
[45:58] What's the prophet again? You're a bluff
[46:00] and you've been stripped of every
[46:02] privilege. You have no legal right. I
[46:05] just love reading the devil these
[46:07] quotes. Jesus stripped you of every
[46:09] power you had at Calvary. And you're
[46:12] nothing but a bluff. And you ain't
[46:15] bluffing us no longer.
[46:18] You ain't nothing but a bluff. Brother
[46:20] Bam said, "Then what are you scared
[46:22] about?"
[46:24] What are you scared about? You're an
[46:26] heir to this thing. God has given it to
[46:29] you. You don't have to be
[46:31] scared. Now, it would matter what you're
[46:35] looking at.
[46:37] When Joshua was looking at the battle,
[46:39] he wasn't looking at the walls. Brother
[46:41] Bam said by vision he saw the walls were
[46:43] laying flat.
[46:45] So he was seeing the unseen while he was
[46:47] yet looking at the scene. Do you see
[46:50] what it was? He had received the mind of
[46:53] Christ for the battle he was about to go
[46:54] into. I love how brother Brandham says
[46:56] this in the seventh seal. He said when
[46:58] the supernatural comes in, that's the
[47:01] mind of
[47:03] Christ. When the supernatural begins to
[47:06] move in, that's the mind of Christ. when
[47:09] the mind of Christ begins to be moved.
[47:11] You see, the battle that we're facing
[47:13] tonight is not a battle. I I went
[47:15] through a bunch of battles this week and
[47:17] and if you if you think about
[47:19] battlegrounds when you go here to uh the
[47:22] greatest battle ever fought, brother Bam
[47:23] will go into it a little bit and he'll
[47:25] start he'll start laying it out and
[47:27] he'll say like the battle David and
[47:29] Goliath uh fought, which is the valley
[47:30] of E L
[47:32] Ah. Amen. But it was in a valley and
[47:35] brother Bam said there was the place
[47:36] picked for the battle. And he said,
[47:39] "That very thing represents God picking
[47:43] your mind for the battle." He said, "So
[47:46] it's the battleground." So I I just went
[47:47] through and looked at Gettysburg and uh
[47:50] uh Tripoli and there's Troy and there's
[47:53] and matter of fact, if you look at some
[47:55] of the top 10 battles that ever were
[47:57] fought were fought during the time
[47:58] between the Greek and Persians. Isn't
[48:00] that wild? Because God already said the
[48:02] Greeks would overtake the Persians, but
[48:05] they still had to fight the battle. and
[48:07] some of the greatest battles that ever
[48:09] took. And if you go looking at those
[48:12] battlegrounds, those battlegrounds are
[48:14] places where great battles took place.
[48:17] And and there was deaths and there was
[48:18] tragedies and there was things from
[48:20] every side. And brother Ram said, "There
[48:22] is your mind. There it is. That's where
[48:25] your mind is." He said, "Now watch it is
[48:28] he says that's remember that that's
[48:30] where the battle takes place is in your
[48:32] mind whether you will see." Now watch.
[48:36] Now remember this is not Christian
[48:38] science.
[48:40] This is not mind over matter. The mind
[48:44] will accept the life which is the word
[48:47] of God and there brings the life. Just
[48:49] your thought doesn't do it. See, but
[48:52] it's the word of God. It's not because
[48:55] you start saying, "Well, I'm not going
[48:56] to be sick. I'm not going to be sick.
[48:57] I'm not going to be sick. I'm not going
[48:58] to be sick." Listen, that's your mind.
[49:00] And it's called mind over matter. Amen.
[49:02] And it ain't going to work.
[49:05] Right now, I know the pull pit ain't no
[49:07] place for joking, but there's a couple
[49:08] old boys one day and they was fishing
[49:10] and old boy caught a carp, you know, and
[49:12] he was a he was a little bit of an
[49:14] Asian. He picks that carp up and looks
[49:15] him right in the face and he starts
[49:17] looking right in the face of that fish.
[49:19] And after a little while, he was saying,
[49:22] "Fish, I take power over you. I take
[49:24] power." And after a little while, that
[49:25] that fish that fish's eyes started to
[49:27] slant a little bit like the Asians. And
[49:30] he looked at that fish and threw him
[49:31] back. a little while he caught another
[49:32] one and did the same thing again. There
[49:34] was a fellow sitting in the boat with
[49:36] him picked up and he said, "Man, what
[49:37] are you doing?" He said, "It's mind over
[49:39] matter." So, he caught a fish and picked
[49:41] that fish up and looked at it. He starts
[49:43] looking at the right in the face of that
[49:44] fish and in a few few minutes the old
[49:46] boy looking at it started
[49:52] going. The fish had more power than he
[49:54] had.
[49:57] And
[49:58] sometimes the situation you're dealing
[50:01] with has more power than you have in
[50:03] your mind. Your intellectual power is no
[50:07] match for Satan's power. So this is not
[50:10] mind over matter. This ain't just
[50:12] pumping yourself up to be better. Amen.
[50:16] This is not I'm going to have a positive
[50:18] thought and I'm going to become better
[50:19] and it's going to get better tomorrow.
[50:21] Amen. It's not that at all. But it's the
[50:23] mind that accepts the life of the word
[50:26] of God and it brings life and your
[50:28] thought doesn't do it. It's the word of
[50:31] God that drops into the channel of your
[50:34] thought. See, it's not your thought like
[50:36] Christian science makes it. It's not
[50:38] mind over matter. That isn't it. Your
[50:40] mind accepts it. It grasp it, but you
[50:44] control it by a spirit. Now, your spirit
[50:46] catches the word of God and that's the
[50:48] thing that's got life in it and it
[50:51] brings life into you. When that takes
[50:53] place, life comes down into that channel
[50:56] and the word of God is manifested in
[50:59] you. See, it isn't mind over matter.
[51:01] It's your mind accepting the word. And
[51:04] in that word, there is power. In that
[51:07] word, there is life. That's why the
[51:09] Bible tells us about hearing the word of
[51:12] God. Faith cometh by hearing the word.
[51:15] Faith for healing comes by the word.
[51:17] Faith for deliverance comes by the word.
[51:19] It's not just mind over matter. It's not
[51:22] I'm going to will myself to be better
[51:23] tomorrow. You're going to you you won't
[51:25] your will run out.
[51:28] Your will will run out. I'm going to
[51:30] will myself to get up tomorrow and I'm
[51:31] not going to be down and I'm going to
[51:32] feel better and things are going to be
[51:34] better. You'll never make where you're
[51:36] trying to go that way. That's like a
[51:38] person trying to get their bootstraps
[51:40] and pull themselves to the moon. You're
[51:42] not going anywhere. You're not getting
[51:44] any higher than the seat you're sitting
[51:46] in. But when the word drops into the
[51:49] channel of the mind and you say in your
[51:51] heart, that's the word of God. I believe
[51:54] the word of God, that word has power to
[51:57] take root and begins to be moving over
[51:59] you. Now, there's people that's tried to
[52:01] get better. You know, Christian science
[52:03] is, if you don't know this, Christian
[52:05] Science is the thing that Brother
[52:06] Brandham thought over in Africa when he
[52:08] first went over there because they uh
[52:10] they they believe that you can just get
[52:12] better. And you know, you like if you
[52:14] have a sickness, you just say, "I ain't
[52:15] got the sickness. I ain't got the
[52:16] sickness." And after a while, you know,
[52:18] I I think I've heard some Christian
[52:19] signs teaching around the message
[52:21] sometimes almost. It's like you try to
[52:23] ignore that you're sick. Brother Ram
[52:24] said, "That ain't overcoming." He said
[52:26] overcoming is recognizing you got a you
[52:28] got a spirit or you got a sickness but
[52:30] then understanding that greater is he
[52:32] that is in you than he's in the sickness
[52:35] and that's overcoming. He brother meets
[52:37] a woman in a discernment line and she
[52:40] comes in there and he says ma'am you got
[52:41] a migraines. You're fighting with
[52:43] migraines. He said but I see you sitting
[52:45] by yourself in a room reading a little
[52:48] book. He said now nobody else knows this
[52:50] because you were sitting by yourself. He
[52:53] said I see you doing it. Oh, he said, "A
[52:56] Christian Science reading room." And he
[52:59] picks up what she was doing in that
[53:01] reading room and she's trying to get
[53:03] better. But brother Bam says, "See, you
[53:05] belong to that Christian Science. Is
[53:07] that right? I've seen you in that
[53:09] reading room. That's the reason I know
[53:11] you belong to it. That's right. Raise
[53:13] your hand. Do you believe if I ask God,
[53:16] this is not mind over matter. This is
[53:19] the power of almighty God." Do you see
[53:22] what he's doing? He picks up her thought
[53:24] that I'm going to will my headache away.
[53:27] He said, "That ain't the that ain't the
[53:28] way you do this. That ain't the way to
[53:30] fight this battle. The way to fight this
[53:32] battle is to know that's a devil. But
[53:35] know that greater is he that's in me
[53:37] than he that's in this sickness. Greater
[53:40] is he that's in me than say he that's in
[53:42] this disease. It's not me great. It's
[53:45] greater is he the blood and the
[53:48] testimony of the Lord." Somebody asked
[53:50] brother Random, they said, "Brother
[53:51] Brandom, will you explain Christian
[53:53] Science?" He said, "Yes." He said,
[53:55] "Christian science is
[53:57] psychology." He said, "But divine
[54:00] healing is the power of God. Christian
[54:03] science is mind over matter. It's
[54:05] psychology. We're going to get better,
[54:06] folks. It's going to get better. It's
[54:08] psychology. It's manipulation. It's
[54:11] trying to turn events and positive
[54:13] thinking and and and and swirl everybody
[54:15] around. But that's not what we're doing
[54:17] here. This is not a Christian science
[54:20] reading room. This is a birthing room
[54:22] where the power of God comes into the
[54:24] room and casts demons away from your
[54:27] mind and cast demons out of your spirit
[54:29] and heals the body. I got sense enough.
[54:32] Brother Bam said if I got a cramp in my
[54:34] arm, I got sense enough to know it's
[54:35] hurting.
[54:40] Well, I mean, you ever been hurting? And
[54:41] somebody said, "Well, you ain't
[54:42] hurting." Well, I am hurting.
[54:45] He said, "It's sense enough to know
[54:47] you're hurting." He said, "But I know
[54:49] God's power can take it away." Do you
[54:52] see what it is? It's not a mind over
[54:54] matter. I'm not a Christian science or
[54:56] unitarian. I don't believe in mind over
[54:58] matter. I believe God's a healer. It's
[55:00] not God. Amen. A mind over matter.
[55:02] Brother Bam said, "Not Christian science
[55:04] meaning mind over matter." You see the
[55:07] thing of it? It's the atmosphere that
[55:09] you live in. It's the atmosphere that
[55:12] you live in. Brother Bam said it like
[55:14] this. I challenge these people. Amen.
[55:16] Upon the authority of God's word in the
[55:18] presence of Jesus Christ who shed his
[55:20] blood to make every word a reality to
[55:23] every person that would believe. Satan,
[55:26] you're defeated. Your time is at hand.
[55:28] Look what brother's saying. Make every
[55:29] word of this a reality. This is not an
[55:32] imagination. This isn't just something,
[55:34] Amen, that comes along. But it is the
[55:37] power of God. Look at how the Bible says
[55:40] this, that if you profess or you
[55:42] confess, he can make
[55:44] intercessions. Now, you say, "Preacher,
[55:46] I'm in a real mess and I don't know if
[55:48] God can help me in my condition." Let me
[55:51] say this. Jonah was under the
[55:53] circumstances he was under. He said he
[55:56] could get a miracle to work like that
[55:58] from God. In in the circumstance he was
[56:01] in, he could still get a miracle from
[56:03] God. There ain't none of you in the
[56:05] shape Jonah was in. Yes, sir. Nobody in
[56:09] this building tonight is in the same
[56:10] place Jonah was. And brother B said, "If
[56:13] Jonah could get a miracle, you can have
[56:15] a miracle. You can get a miracle
[56:18] tonight." You say, "How do I get a
[56:19] miracle?" Brother Bam said, "This is the
[56:21] way miracles are done." He said, "You
[56:23] take the word of God and begin to
[56:25] testify before you see the evidence. You
[56:28] begin to praise God before you feel it,
[56:30] before you can know it. But you begin to
[56:32] believe God." My brother said that's
[56:34] what Mary done and that's what believers
[56:36] can do is take the word and begin to
[56:39] praise God with it. I know the devil
[56:41] hates it but it's the truth anyhow. Now
[56:43] it doesn't take excitement and we enjoy
[56:46] excitement but it doesn't take
[56:47] excitement. It takes true settled faith.
[56:51] Amen. It takes true settled faith. God
[56:54] doesn't work under excitement or
[56:57] screaming or stomping or running. You
[57:00] can't stomp the devil to make him out go
[57:03] out.
[57:04] I know what I'm talking about. I've seen
[57:06] people get excited in prayer lines and
[57:07] not get nothing.
[57:09] I've seen people get excited in church
[57:11] and not get nothing. Matter of fact,
[57:13] sometimes the devil will excite somebody
[57:14] to keep them from getting something.
[57:17] But there is a difference between
[57:19] excitement and faith. Faith comes from
[57:22] the word of God. When the word settles
[57:24] in your heart, I if I feel it, okay. If
[57:27] I don't feel it, okay, y'all know me.
[57:29] I'm all right with excitement, all right
[57:30] with dancing, all right with stomping. I
[57:32] stomp on the devil all the time. But but
[57:35] it's not the stomping that moves the
[57:37] devil. It's not the stomping that moves
[57:40] him. It's the word in my heart that is
[57:43] settled to believe there's not a devil
[57:45] can stand in the presence of God's
[57:47] people. So it's not the stomping or the
[57:50] screaming. It's not that. You've got to
[57:52] know right where you're standing.
[57:55] And it's the power of God that'll do it.
[57:58] said, "Preacher, where you standing?" I
[58:00] know right where I'm standing. I've had
[58:01] demons of every kind challenge me. I've
[58:04] had demons from from every which
[58:05] continent to stand right there and
[58:08] challenge me out of eye. You know what I
[58:10] can do? Every demon that's ever come
[58:11] near me, I say in the name of Jesus
[58:14] Christ, Satan, you are defeated. And
[58:16] none of them have ever been able to
[58:18] stand up in my presence. Every one of
[58:20] them hits the floor. You know why?
[58:22] Because it's not me. It's a confession
[58:24] of the faith of the blood of Jesus
[58:27] Christ. If I try to stand there as a
[58:29] man, he'll poke a hole in your weakness
[58:31] and exploit some little feeling or some
[58:33] thought you had or some situation. But
[58:36] if you really want to stand there, get
[58:37] the whole armor of God and say, "I'm
[58:39] under the blood of Jesus Christ." And
[58:42] God can't see my sin. And the devil
[58:44] can't see my sin. He's just seeing if
[58:47] you're going to stand with the word or
[58:48] not.
[58:50] Amen. I tell you this. I believe we need
[58:52] to get the power of God back in the
[58:54] church. I believe we got it. I believe
[58:57] we got it. I'm reading the prophet. What
[58:58] we need today is an oldfashioned gospel.
[59:00] The fire of the Holy Ghost to fall on
[59:02] the altar in every heart. Is that right,
[59:04] brother? You can paint the picture, but
[59:06] it don't help the people. It's got to be
[59:08] the fire. It's got to be the heat of the
[59:10] Holy Ghost. It's got to be a living word
[59:13] that is manifested. I don't want to hear
[59:15] what God was. What is God today? What
[59:18] can he do for my children? What can he
[59:20] do for these young people? What kind of
[59:22] meeting can he have? What kind of grace
[59:25] can come in this man? Brother, we had a
[59:27] powerful service Sunday. We're not
[59:29] living on Sunday no more. This is
[59:30] Thursday night. This is another night.
[59:33] It's another moment. It's another time.
[59:35] Listen. And God has untapped resources.
[59:39] Hallelujah. You don't have to drink
[59:40] sparingly. He's the same God with the
[59:43] same power. And the church needs the
[59:46] power of God, the Holy Spirit. Now
[59:47] listen. Now, brother Bam said, "If a
[59:49] power of a devil could make a man
[59:51] strong, what about the power of
[59:56] God?" Now, the power of
[59:59] God. Brother Bam said some time ago,
[1:00:02] Brother Bam said, "You think them
[1:00:03] Pentecostal people are just
[1:00:06] excited." See, now watch, Brother Bam,
[1:00:08] divide the excitement. He said, "Doctor,
[1:00:10] do you mean to tell me that nerves can
[1:00:12] be excited without something to excite
[1:00:14] them?"
[1:00:15] He said, "See, I said the unseen force
[1:00:18] of the Holy Ghost is moving among us and
[1:00:21] it excites the bornagain
[1:00:24] spirit. The power of God, I love how he
[1:00:26] says this, the power of God foams down
[1:00:29] through
[1:00:30] there. Faith cometh by the hearing and
[1:00:33] the Holy Ghost takes the word and
[1:00:35] spreads it out over the people to catch
[1:00:38] it with the power of a regenerate, born
[1:00:41] again life." Something has to cry out.
[1:00:45] What is it? What is it? It's the power
[1:00:48] of God. Listen. Listen. Excitement won't
[1:00:50] heal you. It takes the power of God to
[1:00:53] heal a person. Mind over matter won't
[1:00:56] change your circumstance. It'll take the
[1:00:58] power of God to do it. The power of
[1:01:01] God. It's it's not the human emotion.
[1:01:05] It's because of the resurrection of the
[1:01:07] power of God that is pressing into the
[1:01:10] human life.
[1:01:12] Oh, we get
[1:01:13] emotional. But what's behind the
[1:01:16] emotion?
[1:01:18] The power of God. It's the power of God
[1:01:21] by his word. Brother Brham says it like
[1:01:24] this. And what what is an oldfashioned
[1:01:26] Holy Ghost meeting? It's not them
[1:01:29] shouting. It's the power of God moving
[1:01:31] in them, bubbling and pushing and
[1:01:35] outside powers of the living God. God's
[1:01:37] provided way of watering. See what it
[1:01:39] is? See, it's like that artisian well
[1:01:42] coming up in it. What is happening is
[1:01:44] it's bringing the power of God. I I love
[1:01:48] how brother Brandham says something. Uh
[1:01:50] he's talking about bringing power in a
[1:01:52] church. He said, "I found two wires you
[1:01:54] can put together to bring the power of
[1:01:56] God." He said, "I found two loose ends."
[1:01:58] He said, "If I tied them together, I
[1:01:59] could bring the power of God." He said,
[1:02:00] "The two of them is one is love and the
[1:02:03] other one is faith." And he said, 'If I
[1:02:05] take the wire of love and the wire of
[1:02:07] faith and put them together, it'll bring
[1:02:08] the power of God. He says, when you love
[1:02:12] God enough to know he can't lie to you,
[1:02:14] it'll create a faith to make you believe
[1:02:17] the word. And every word is positive
[1:02:20] truth.
[1:02:22] I thinking I was thinking over this
[1:02:24] today and I'm sitting here reading quote
[1:02:27] after quote after quote and brother's
[1:02:29] talking about the power of God.
[1:02:32] He's talking about the power of God. And
[1:02:34] then he starts talking about believers.
[1:02:37] And then in the middle of this, he says,
[1:02:38] "Now, but watch this." He said, 'But
[1:02:41] even in people that's got the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost, oppression, demon oppression
[1:02:47] comes upon them. And he said, one of
[1:02:49] them fell said to me, "Brother Brandham,
[1:02:51] I don't have no demon possession." He
[1:02:53] said, "No, I didn't say that." He said,
[1:02:54] "Oppression."
[1:02:56] He said, "It is a demon oppression. You
[1:02:59] see that? It becomes Satan in the flesh,
[1:03:02] not in the spirit. Satan, he said, can
[1:03:04] give unclean habits and unbelief and
[1:03:06] things like that. He said, but it's your
[1:03:08] faith that saves you. And many people
[1:03:11] just as pure and clean, a lot cleaner
[1:03:14] than me. Sometimes people profess
[1:03:16] Christians, but yet would deny the Holy
[1:03:17] Ghost or deny the operation of the power
[1:03:19] of God. See, unbelieving, no matter,
[1:03:23] they're very religious.
[1:03:25] But you see what it is? It's a demon
[1:03:28] power oppressing working upon them to
[1:03:31] make them not believe in the power of
[1:03:34] God. I I was just reading here and I I I
[1:03:36] found some quotes that it was was was
[1:03:38] very to me was very uh powerful for this
[1:03:42] moment. And as I'm reading I you know
[1:03:45] you know how you do you start reading
[1:03:46] about something. Anybody ever study
[1:03:47] topics in the message? You just start
[1:03:49] reading topics. And when you start
[1:03:51] reading them and you start, let's just
[1:03:53] say you start reading about the power of
[1:03:54] God, brother B start talking about what
[1:03:55] the power of God will do this and the
[1:03:57] power of God will do this and the power
[1:03:58] of God will do this. In a minute you
[1:04:00] start saying, "Boy, I'd like to have
[1:04:01] some of that
[1:04:03] power. The power of God will do this and
[1:04:05] the power of God will do this and the
[1:04:07] power of God do and you'll think, my I'd
[1:04:09] like to have some of that power." And
[1:04:11] all of a sudden, you read a quote and he
[1:04:12] says, "Now, if you're craving to see the
[1:04:14] power of God, there's a power of God
[1:04:17] somewhere.
[1:04:20] If a human being is thirsting and
[1:04:22] calling for the power of God, there's
[1:04:24] got to be a power of God to respond to
[1:04:27] that. If you're longing to see it,
[1:04:29] there's got to be a power of God to come
[1:04:31] to
[1:04:32] it. Now, I believe I believe uh that the
[1:04:38] success of a church lies in the power of
[1:04:41] God. I certainly believe we have a
[1:04:43] successful church. But we cannot ever be
[1:04:46] a
[1:04:48] success doing anything the world does.
[1:04:52] We can only be a success as we follow
[1:04:54] after God's statues and his way of doing
[1:04:58] things. We can't pattern after the world
[1:05:01] or cigarette company has met the
[1:05:03] greatest success by television and beer
[1:05:05] and whiskey and crowd has made success
[1:05:07] through contribution. That's no sign
[1:05:09] that the church will make it success by
[1:05:12] television. The success of the church
[1:05:15] lies within the preaching of the gospel,
[1:05:18] of the power of God and the
[1:05:20] demonstration of the spirit.
[1:05:23] The success of the church lies in the
[1:05:26] preaching of the
[1:05:27] gospel. People say to you, are you
[1:05:30] successful? Well, what do you measure by
[1:05:32] success by?
[1:05:34] Brother Brandon measured it by the
[1:05:35] preaching of the gospel of the power of
[1:05:37] God and of the
[1:05:39] demonstration of the spirit.
[1:05:42] Now, if you want to find the power of
[1:05:44] God, there's a way to get there. How
[1:05:45] many knows that there's a way to get to
[1:05:47] the power of God? There's a power of God
[1:05:49] somewhere. Then the prophet of God said
[1:05:51] somewhere you can get to it. And the
[1:05:53] unfailing realities of of God, Brother
[1:05:56] Bam says, see, it's just like, and if
[1:05:58] you go listen to this tape, go go back
[1:06:00] and listen to the tape. you that's
[1:06:01] listening on the air tonight, listen to
[1:06:03] this tape as well. The unfailing
[1:06:04] realities of living God. And brother Bam
[1:06:06] says, "See, when God placed man here in
[1:06:08] the days of the Lord Jesus, he gave man
[1:06:10] a true road mapap to his
[1:06:13] power." He gave a man a road map to his
[1:06:16] power. And brother Brown said, "Just
[1:06:18] like if I'm going to go to California,"
[1:06:20] he said, "I can tell you what road to
[1:06:22] take." He said, "I can almost tell you
[1:06:25] how long it'll take me to get there
[1:06:27] because I have traveled them roads so
[1:06:29] well." So he had traveled that road so
[1:06:32] long he knew exactly what map to look at
[1:06:36] how what road to take. And brother Bram
[1:06:38] says it like this. Any of these last few
[1:06:40] years you could do it. And that's the
[1:06:42] way God wants us to know his word. That
[1:06:44] we have traveled it. We have tested it.
[1:06:46] We have tried it and we know where it
[1:06:49] leads. Amen. This leads See his road map
[1:06:52] is the Bible. And the road leads to the
[1:06:55] power of God. Amen. What is it? When you
[1:06:58] when you take the scripture, they will
[1:07:01] lead you to the power of God. The power
[1:07:04] produces the promise. We need the power.
[1:07:07] It's the power of God. Listen, I don't
[1:07:09] know if you guys ever experience uh when
[1:07:12] you're studying if it's almost sometimes
[1:07:14] supernatural, you know, and and I'm a
[1:07:16] I'm a reader and sometimes I'm listening
[1:07:18] while I'm reading. Anybody ever do that?
[1:07:20] And sometimes I'm reading quotes and I'm
[1:07:22] listening to a tape at the same time.
[1:07:24] And I was sitting listening. Amen. And I
[1:07:27] was hearing a series of quotes and while
[1:07:28] I was sitting there listening, I was
[1:07:30] reading this and God wants us to know
[1:07:32] his word. We've traveled, tested it. The
[1:07:35] Bible is a road map to the power of God.
[1:07:37] See the road to the power of God. And at
[1:07:39] the same moment I'm listening and on
[1:07:41] another tape he says this. Listen close.
[1:07:44] If Satan tries to hand you some of this
[1:07:46] stuff like sickness, you know what to
[1:07:48] do. Just show him the token and you say,
[1:07:51] "I'm a purchased product. My healing has
[1:07:54] paid for. I'm a product of God because I
[1:07:56] have a token of the Holy Ghost. You
[1:07:59] cannot keep me off of this highway. I'm
[1:08:02] sitting here reading there's a road to
[1:08:04] the power of God and the prophet is
[1:08:06] saying, "You can't keep me off of this
[1:08:08] highway." Well, I say tonight, there's a
[1:08:10] road to the power of God and Satan can't
[1:08:12] keep us off of this highway. It's a
[1:08:15] highway to the power of God. It's a
[1:08:17] highway to your healing. It's a highway
[1:08:20] to your deliverance. And he can't keep
[1:08:22] us off of the power of God. Amen. I'll
[1:08:24] say something tonight. I believe that
[1:08:26] the power of God is right in this room
[1:08:29] right now. And every person sitting
[1:08:31] here, if you could just believe it,
[1:08:33] there's enough power in this room to
[1:08:35] speak a world and go live on it. Come
[1:08:37] on, church. I'm talking about the power
[1:08:40] of God. It's a quickening power, Brother
[1:08:42] Seth. It's a dynamic power. It's a
[1:08:44] creative power. It's a healing power.
[1:08:47] It's a delivering power. It's not just
[1:08:50] church. It's the power of God. It's the
[1:08:54] power of his mercy. Won't you stand with
[1:08:56] us tonight? It's the power of God. The
[1:09:00] power of God unto his grace and his
[1:09:03] mercy. This power of God is accessible
[1:09:07] tonight by his faith. I believe it. I
[1:09:11] believe it. I don't believe tonight that
[1:09:13] education is going to deliver the
[1:09:16] church. If education is the way out,
[1:09:20] then why don't it act?
[1:09:22] We got more education today than we've
[1:09:24] ever had. We got more educators than
[1:09:27] we've ever had. We got more psychology
[1:09:29] than we ever had. So, if it would if
[1:09:32] it's going to be the way out, then let
[1:09:33] it act. But I believe the I believe the
[1:09:36] power of God is the way out for every
[1:09:38] believer. I believe the power of God can
[1:09:40] change situations. You know, I I just
[1:09:42] looked over and seen Sister Kimberly, it
[1:09:43] wouldn't been several years ago, we were
[1:09:46] in a midweek service together. Amen. It
[1:09:48] was a lot later than it is right now.
[1:09:51] But we were in a midweek service
[1:09:52] together and we was in the middle of a
[1:09:54] prayer line. She come up there and stood
[1:09:56] for her brother, Brother Justin Wear.
[1:09:58] And she said she would she would like to
[1:10:01] have his
[1:10:02] salvation. And she stood right there and
[1:10:04] and and after the prayer, I don't
[1:10:06] remember exactly where you went if you
[1:10:08] just went over to the altar or if you
[1:10:09] went back to your seat. I was praying.
[1:10:12] She went back to her seat. But about a
[1:10:14] half hour later, you can go see it on
[1:10:16] the video there, Brother Tims. About a
[1:10:18] half hour later, the whole church just
[1:10:20] starts roaring and excitement and and
[1:10:23] and brother Tim looks over at me and he
[1:10:25] said, "Brother Wayne," he said, "You
[1:10:26] remember that boy that we just prayed
[1:10:28] for a moment ago with that girl come up
[1:10:30] Nashville?" I said, "Yeah." He said,
[1:10:31] "He's standing right there and I I don't
[1:10:35] I think he had on a pair of sweats,
[1:10:37] maybe like pajamas or something, and his
[1:10:40] hair was all twisted up on the side
[1:10:42] where he crawled out of
[1:10:45] bed.
[1:10:46] It it was the power of God
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] that a a girl believe the word of God
[1:10:55] that if I make a claim that God will
[1:10:58] back up that claim and the power of God
[1:11:00] took a hold of
[1:11:01] that and Justin W now he's in church
[1:11:04] today but within a half hour he come
[1:11:07] running in that back room and went up
[1:11:09] here and gave his life to Jesus
[1:11:12] Christ. I'll tell you friends, don't
[1:11:14] underestimate what God can do.
[1:11:18] What the power of God could do in this
[1:11:20] building tonight. What the power of God
[1:11:21] could do for your life. You said,
[1:11:23] "Brother Wayne, I'm in a bad
[1:11:26] shape. I was just reading. I I spent
[1:11:29] most of the evening reading quote after
[1:11:32] quote after quote where the prophet is
[1:11:35] talking about the power of God and he's
[1:11:37] talking about the situations of people's
[1:11:39] lives.
[1:11:43] And as the as the discerning power of
[1:11:45] God began to open on the congregation,
[1:11:48] he would he would look at people that
[1:11:50] thought they were sick with one thing
[1:11:52] and they were sick with something
[1:11:56] else. Do you know do you know sicknesses
[1:11:58] sometimes are not a physical
[1:12:03] problem but spiritual?
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:09] I'm reading a prophet and he's beginning
[1:12:11] to talk and he says, he says, "Oh,
[1:12:14] brother, I see that." He said, "You
[1:12:16] think you have heart trouble." It's not
[1:12:19] heart trouble. It's
[1:12:21] indigestion caused by a nervousness in
[1:12:25] your
[1:12:26] mind. Is it? He said, "Not like the
[1:12:30] handshaking nervous, but a mental
[1:12:33] nervousness where you're a deep thinker.
[1:12:37] And then he switches and I got I got
[1:12:39] quotes. I mean a list quotes and quotes
[1:12:42] more
[1:12:43] quotes where he says to a person he says
[1:12:46] you think you you think you have a
[1:12:48] peptic you have a certain kind of a
[1:12:50] stomach issue. He said no. He said
[1:12:52] really what it is he says is you're
[1:12:54] mentally nervous and that mental
[1:12:58] nervousness is causing your stomach to
[1:13:01] react that way. And brother Bam reveals
[1:13:03] it. He said, "If you believe the Lord
[1:13:05] Jesus, you'll go home be
[1:13:07] healed." Ain't that amazing?
[1:13:10] He turns to He turns to people and they
[1:13:14] think that this is what's
[1:13:18] wrong, but it's this what's wrong. And
[1:13:22] with the power of God begin to dissolve
[1:13:24] that, people can. Now the reason I'm
[1:13:27] reason I'm here is the greatest battle
[1:13:30] that has ever been
[1:13:31] fought is fought where? In the
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:36] mind. Things that come into your mind
[1:13:40] affect your whole body.
[1:13:43] That's right.
[1:13:45] You sit here tonight and begin to think,
[1:13:46] "Nobody loves me. Nobody cares for me.
[1:13:48] Nobody thinks nothing of me. I'm all by
[1:13:51] myself." And you start backing away.
[1:13:54] You're not getting any fellowship. It
[1:13:56] starts coming into your mind. You start
[1:13:58] getting secluded and then all of a
[1:14:01] sudden depression begins to come and
[1:14:05] then depression moves over. Do you'all
[1:14:06] know depression is a demon?
[1:14:09] Do you know depression takes your
[1:14:10] personal value away from you? That's
[1:14:12] right.
[1:14:14] If you take a person that's really
[1:14:16] depressed, honestly depressed, then not
[1:14:18] not just self-pity, but if a real
[1:14:19] depression's on them, do you know you
[1:14:21] can tell them that you love them every
[1:14:23] day and they won't believe
[1:14:25] you. You can tell a girl she's
[1:14:27] beautiful, she won't believe you. You
[1:14:29] can tell a boy he's wonderful, he won't
[1:14:31] believe you. You take a preacher that
[1:14:33] gets a depression on him, you can tell
[1:14:35] him he's the best preacher in the
[1:14:36] country. He won't believe one word you
[1:14:37] say to him because there's a spirit
[1:14:41] affecting his
[1:14:43] mind and it's affecting the whole life.
[1:14:46] See the battle of the mind. Satan's
[1:14:48] trying to attack the mind. That's why
[1:14:50] the prophet said, "Take on the helmet of
[1:14:52] salvation. Guard your mind from the
[1:14:55] wickedness of this world." It's not mind
[1:14:58] over matter.
[1:15:00] It's the power of God taking the word
[1:15:03] and coming into your mind. Let's bow our
[1:15:05] hearts. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[1:15:07] tonight for your children that have
[1:15:08] gathered in this room. We know it's a
[1:15:11] Thursday evening. It's the Fourth of
[1:15:13] July. These people have gathered in here
[1:15:14] tonight, Lord. Father, they've taken
[1:15:17] their time. They've gathered in here
[1:15:19] because they're hungry for the power of
[1:15:21] God.
[1:15:22] And I pray tonight, Father, as they sit
[1:15:25] here under the the preaching of the
[1:15:28] gospel that I pray something is striking
[1:15:31] them right
[1:15:32] now. I pray the word of life is striking
[1:15:36] over their hearts. Lord, I pray the
[1:15:38] enemy is losing his hold. Father, if the
[1:15:41] spirit of depression exists in this room
[1:15:43] tonight, I ask you for your mercy in
[1:15:46] that home, upon that life, that middle
[1:15:49] nervousness that moves over in this age.
[1:15:52] Lord, it seems like it's everywhere. But
[1:15:54] I pray tonight in the name of Jesus that
[1:15:57] the power of God would come down the
[1:15:59] channel of this word. It would fall into
[1:16:02] the mind of a believer and they just
[1:16:04] begin to believe. And Satan, you're
[1:16:06] done. You're done. In the name of Jesus,
[1:16:10] you have no legal rights over this
[1:16:12] church. You have no legal rights over
[1:16:14] this people. And it's standing in this
[1:16:17] office of pastor, I rebuke you in the
[1:16:20] name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you take
[1:16:22] your leave. You have no hold over the
[1:16:25] mental fitness of this children and of
[1:16:27] these people that are fellowshipping
[1:16:29] here under this word by the power of the
[1:16:31] word of God. It is commanded in the
[1:16:33] scripture that they would have a sound
[1:16:35] mind. Lord, I'm not a crazy man, but you
[1:16:39] have told us we can have what has been
[1:16:41] spoken in the Bible. And Father, we
[1:16:44] believe it tonight. We receive it by the
[1:16:46] word of God. In the name of Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ, we
[1:16:51] pray.
[1:16:53] Amen. And
[1:16:55] amen. We love you tonight. And God bless
[1:16:58] you. God bless you, Brother Ben. Word of
[1:17:01] God
[1:17:03] speak. Would you pour down like rain?
[1:17:07] Thank you, Lord, causing my eyes to see.
[1:17:12] Yes, Father, your
[1:17:16] majesty to be still and
[1:17:20] know that you're in this
[1:17:23] place. Thank you, Lord. Please let me
[1:17:27] stay at
[1:17:29] rest in your holiness.
[1:17:34] Word of God
[1:17:37] speak. Word of God
[1:17:40] speak. Would you pour down my
[1:17:45] grave, causing my eyes to
[1:17:50] see your
[1:17:53] majesty to be still and
[1:17:57] know you're in this place.
[1:18:03] Please let me
[1:18:07] stand in your
[1:18:10] holiness. Word of God
[1:18:14] speak. Oh word of God
[1:18:18] speak. Would you pour down my gra? Thank
[1:18:22] you Lord. Closing my eyes to
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:31] see. Be still and
[1:18:35] know you're in this
[1:18:40] place. Please let me
[1:18:44] stay in your holiness.
[1:18:49] Word of God
