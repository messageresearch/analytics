========================================

if you if you would today maybe just stand to your feet with us and we'll go to the Lord in a word of prayer amen uh we we want to just take a moment and speak to him and if there's something on your heart today say Lord I I need you to come by my way maybe just a little special something you need today let's just make it known to him father as your children we come to you this morning because you're our God and Lord you gave us the opportunity Lord to be able to speak to you Lord not through the sacrifice of a a bull or a gold or a dove or a lamb but Lord you offered your own blood that I might have a right to stand here this morning a a gentile a heathen by my birth but Lord I could come under that blood and speak to you and you would hear me and father I'm so thankful this morning I'm thankful for the grace that you've shown us and here in this assembly Lord we want to thank you for the grace that you have shown us as a body Lord and we ask you father that you would give us Grace to be a blessing to every for every person that you would place in the assembly Lord we pray that may they feel the love and the warmth and the outpouring of your wonderful Grace and Lord this this people Lord now as we come together this morning we blend our voices and our gifts and and our anointings Lord and we ask you this morning that your great spirit Lord would just take your word may you lead us into the paths Lord of righteousness and the things Lord that would help your children this morning and we ask Lord but while we speak this word today may you may you feel free Lord may you feel open to just move among this congregation Lord and tender the hearts Lord and father for the hurting may you heal them Lord father for the hardened may you soften them oh God we're asking you that you reignite fires Lord and that you heal bodies and Lord when we leave this building this morning may great and miraculous things have took place inside this room today we invite you now to your word we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you today if you have your Bibles let's look in the Book of John and let's look in the third chapter and the eth verse 1 John chapter 3 and verse 8 and verse 9 amen um we uh certainly enjoyed those songs today amen what a blessing amen the song services are always such a blessing amen um like on Thursday I got to be out here for it and man I feel like having a runaway every time I get in one these song Services I amen I I'm I I just I'm oldfashioned I like that worship and that spirit moving and ah it feels so good to me amen 1 John chapter 3 and verse 8 now he that committes sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning now for this purpose the Son of God was manifested yeah that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God do not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God God bless you as you be seated this morning I'd like to talk to you today of just a little thought that's on my heart and just in correlation with some of the things that I've been speaking recently and I want to talk to you today this would be a title maybe something that we could focus on Amen I want to talk to you about the dirt of the day The Offspring of God the dirt of The Day The Offspring of God in 1 John chapter 3 we find here that Jesus was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and he goes on to say that whosoever is born of God cannot commit sin for his seed remaineth in him I'll tell you just a couple places brother Bram speaks of this scripture and he said I seen squirrels appear y on six different times he he said I knew uh one that would be sitting here and he could create squirrels and he could create flies or frogs or anything the Creator no mortal being but when that sin of that mortal is confessed and dropped into the Clorox of the bleach of Jesus Christ that bleaches all sin he's purely unadulterated without sin and without fault now he that is born of God doth not commit sin for he cannot sin the bleach stand between him and God and how could he ever get there when it breaks it up and sends it back to the one who perverted it well I feel pretty religious he said I feel that stimulation when it begins to reveal amen now this is his explanation of this scripture here again in the first seal brother B will say this he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make him a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that would scatter sin till there would be nothing left of it see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let sin pass it cannot amen he that is born of God see he can't even sin because there's a sacrifice between him and God Amen I thank God this morning for the work of Christ to destroy the works of the devil as it says in John chapter 1 and verse 12 it says but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God God even to them that believe upon his name now which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God amen amen born of God now brother bam explaining this scripture says listen your adoption is not your birth you're your your adoption is your placing now when you're born again in John 1:7 when we are born to the spirit of God we are sons of God but we are predestinated and that's where I'm trying to get you to see for the sons of the last days we're predestinated unto adoption now here we are this is what hurts the Pentecostals a little they say I got born again praise God I got the Holy Ghost he said that's fine you're a child of God that's right but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about adoption I'm talking about the placing of a son amen now what he's talking about is that Sons come into existence amen God's Sons amen and I certainly believe that we were born I don't believe we were born of the will of man but I certainly believe we were born of the will of God Amen that we were born of the spirit of God signs of his coming brother B will say this if the word of the Lord that is a premeditated thought see that's how we have eternal life is because we were spoken into existence by God yes I just said that you were spoken into existence by God you didn't join a church but you were borned by the word that Original Seed that God said let there be and there was and that's the way God's born children are today in the womb of their heart with the word and his word takes root and it grows Amen in wisdom versus face brother bam said if you're born again child of God you are and you got the holy spirit in you you are the manifestation of God's word before it was a word and it's got to be a thought before it can be a word and a word is a spoken thought and the thought was in God and then we were in God in eternity and we were spoken into existence by the word amen we were spoken into existence by the word amen how many believes that this morning amen you you see when God's word created he created you brother B says it like this in the Easter seal he says see the tree of death was the mother he said that's of course in Eden that's how children come forth out of the tree of death in other words they come out of the woman and and they should have come from Adam by the word amen but they come from the woman and brother B said There It Is she brought death into natural life but Christ is the birth through spiritual life and that all that live by the woman dies but all that is born by the man lives amen all that is born to the man lives see all that comes by by the woman is natural and all that comes from the man is spiritual not the man here the man Christ Jesus so if you're born of a woman you're going to die but if you're born of this word you're going to live amen because everything born of this word has eternal life I think of the prophet of God's way of letting us know invisible Union with Christ he talks about how to know the difference of what we're born by amen I like that don't you he said if you're born to the first Adam amen there the way they act he says see another thing what kind of children is she bearing the church he said that tells you what the papa is if it's the first Adam or the second Adam if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam he will act like the second Adam's way of acting like they did it on the day of Pentecost oh I like that don't you amen if you're going to if you're going to be his child you're going to act like he brings his children see God don't bring his children by Church joining and by handshaking he does it like he did it in the book of Acts in the upper room he brings it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on Church y'all know all of them was predestinated seed that was in that Upper Room there was 120 of them but they still had to receive the Holy Ghost amen before they had a New Birth by that baptism amen I love it this morning to know when the prophet of God talks about this end time he he talks about he talks about how Amen in in invisible Union if you're not listening to it lately it's a good book to go back and listen to but he talks about the uh modern church and he said the really the way to understand the condition of the church is look at the women on the street and he said look when you see them doing whatever they want to do he said there's your church natural he said when Jesus was upon the Earth he said they was weeping when he was going to the cross and he says to them don't weep for me weep for yourselves he said because there's going to come a day that they're going to say blessed is a woman that's never given birth or perhaps is never given suck and brother said see Jesus knew that this day was coming when the women wouldn't want to give birth to children no more right and and brother B paused it an end time thing he says see and if they can't get birth to a child he said they want to mother a cat or they don't want to mother a dog he said because it's in them to mother now if you like to read it and you want to be spiritual you can go on and see brother Ram's talking about the church amen wants to Mother something so it mothers cats and dogs and rats and Ricky and Elvises and he's telling you something and what he's saying to you they're always mothering something amen but they don't want to change the form to let the power of God birth a real son among them because they don't want things to get out of out of out of sink or out of order amen it has to be a certain way and keep a certain form brother B said see that's a true picture of the modern church today they don't want any of these screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young around her see she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming Hallelujah such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination one like that in the church they'd throw it out right quick said he says brother R says well you're letting stuff just go on like this he said see but she's pregnated with something because she's bringing members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming holl and blabber and acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her education ethical scientific society that she belongs to they would throw her out at the next Council cuz she can't have that they don't want to be pregnated with the word look at this they don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind I know y'all know this that's the only kind that the word can bring forth the word brings for children like he did in Acts chapter 2 that's God's way of birthing children it's not handshaking it's not head kny it's by the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into the soul amen and it bursts an individual into life I love how brother B says it like this born to the spirit of God it's got the spirit of God in it it's not an intellectual Church joining and a Creed of bobbed haired and painted faces and things that's why they do the way they do is because because they never was born again so they're not subject to the word of God they're only subject to Creeds and dogmas and church anity amen but oh if you ever come by this word amen there is something on the inside that makes you line up to this word of God because it's who you are it's it's the nature that's on the inside of you because you have been birthed brother B said see you don't find all of that stuff in the Bible of church joining and intellectuals and painted faces and bobbed hairs he said but what you're going to find is an oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting and praising God oh I love it don't you people today say well I'll tell you what amen people you don't even have to know when you're born again brother B says Oh They'll take it and say well we believe in the New Birth without sensation and they'll get off on that side and so we'll just believe it amen that's what Mary did she just believed it all that's so one-sided because the of that scripture it is not talking about Mary's New Birth it's talking about Mary having Christ come into her to save the world but when she was going to get saved herself God commanded that she went to that upper room and she got drunk and talked in tongues and shouted and danced and moved like everybody else did because it requires an experience of God not a church joining you got to get in contact with something that can change it can change natures and life lives amen come on church I believe this morning that there is a God that can change natures and he can change lives amen and I know the world don't want it amen but it's the truth anyhow amen it'll produce acts 238 tongue talking babies and it'll produce shouting and praising and worshiping and Holy Ghost and the day you don't want that among you amen you know that we have God on the wrong foot Hallelujah I remember years ago sitting at a table and we were brother Brian and I and some of them were fellowshipping and I said listen guys I just want to tell you the truth amen I don't care anything about having a big church I said what I do care about is worshiping God and I would rather be in this parking lot out here with a tambourine and two or three people and be able to enjoy the word of God and enjoy worshiping and singing and rejoicing then have a whole church full of people that don't want to love God or they don't want to worship God or want to praise God but I tell you why sometimes people don't want to praise God it's because somebody put you in a cage somebody put a bar over you and said you shouldn't shout and you shouldn't worship and you shouldn't sing and they say it's bad church members amen but I don't believe so I think we ought to take the bars and we ought to release the Eagles of God that they can enjoy the fellowship and the worship and enjoy the presence of God friends because after all what else do we have what else else do we have come on I left the bars I left the drugs I left the alcohol I left the World Behind my pleasure is in the presence of a living God when he comes down and breaks in the corridor of my soul in the middle of even the children of God listen I am not ashamed of the results in the presence of a living God Among Us Hallelujah I certainly believe in this morning don't you believe it sir let's give a big Hallelujah to the Lord this morning hallelujah amen back there down in the South you know once in a while you get around Florida and you get them you get in them big retirement areas and you get where the where the where the warm nice weather and the and the seas are and things like this they get communities and they call it a mature living in other words they don't want no kids around and one no kids splashing in the pool and whipping and hollering all that stuff amen so they getting what they call mature you know well I hope our church never get so mature that we don't have some new Young ons run around the church amen that are filled with the Holy Ghost and Experiencing God listen amen you think about this where would you be this morning had you not come in contact with god with an experience that could be greater than your experience in the church because we've had so many experiences we've had so many Church experiences amen and probably as many bad experiences as we've had good experiences with people in churches but we've had an experience with God that trumps every experience that ah Hallelujah I'm so glad I met him amen now I I I say this it is written and the prophet will teach us this thing that a man that has received the Holy Ghost is deity himself right true hey hey somebody tell that devil go on out of here now a man or a woman that's born to the spirit of God is the part of God your sons and daughters of God and Jesus didn't say it is written in the scriptures that ye are Gods didn't it say that in the scriptures you are Gods now he's tying that together with receiving deity in you now in John chapter 10 if you like to read it it says Jesus answered said is it not written in your law ye are Gods if you call them Gods into whom the word of God came to the scripture cannot be broken and Jesus Christ the same 1957 brother bam said if you'll read that John chapter 10 in the 30th verse he said listen close to the reading and then apply that reading to right now this very hour amen now in Psalms 82 it's written in there I have said ye are gods and all of you are the children of the most high my ah offsprings of God Amen offsprings of God Amen testimony of a witness what is it it's the Holy Ghost the true witness of God what is it it is deity tabernacled in a man yes sir am that's the reason we can't receive the Holy Ghost as emotion that's the reason we don't receive the Holy Ghost amen as a theology or as a Doctrine we must know the Holy Ghost is a person and that person is Christ and he deity dwells in brother mam says it like this God is living in a man deity God himself tabernacled in a person he said when he can speak and it'll be the same as God speaking that's the F the first church went forth amen that's the way the first church went forth God's agents amen what do he say as my father sent me so sin I you amen ain't you glad the one that sent you goes in you brother Josh you just got back from Nicaragua those camp meetings aren't you glad he didn't send you to Nicaragua and you had to go by yourself but the one that sent you went in you and if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost deity is walking in the dirt of this day my I'm so glad that deity can come in the dirt of this day amen see we accept deity in the dirt of other days but for some reason we think dirt is different today than it was yesterday do you know the dirt ain't never changed the dirt that Moses had the dirt Joshua had the dirt Jesus had the dirt Peter had the they JS amen dirt is dirt folks and God chose dirt of other days and we can so glorify God and what he done in the dirt of that day but this is the dirt of this day hallelujah amen and the blood has fell upon the Earth to redeem that dirt that God could come and get inside you and use you for his glory and for his Mercy I think it's beautiful I think this great and wonderful church will go forth in the power of deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of your mind I got more quotes and I'll have time to preach but I'm going to put a couple of them out here before we move if we become the spirit sons of God then deity dwells in man I just say it can I can I say like this deity dwells in dirt y y'all help me now is the dirt any different today than it was another day so you made out the same thing see that said brother B said they said nothing is impossible to God that's true but he said nothing's impossible with you if you believe it not with God but you because deity is in you brother bam even tells us this much that when the word comes into you the holy spirit in there it's alive as soon as it comes in and nothing see if you say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt because what is it it's deity speaking you believe that I believe that it's not you it's deity speaking now some people don't even believe in y y'all know I mean it's sad to say there some people don't even believe the spok words in the bride yeah they think all that was reserved for the prophet and then when after after the brother brand passed then we're waiting now for brother Ram's resurrection and when we raise brother randam then he's going to take the book and then he's going to speak and come on now but God Made A Way by the message to energize your faith to make you believe this Bible is true now now watch brother bam he uses this in spiritual Amnesia and he says can you identify with John 14:12 amen and what's it saying there he that believeth in me the works that I do should Greater Works shall you do and you know the Greater Works brother Bam's final statement on Greater Works was the third pull was the spoken word and brother bam says this if you abide in me by word in you this is from Amnesia amen he says listen now Mark 11 said if you say to this mountain and be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you shall have what you have said can you be identified there he says to believe that this is the truth see if it hasn't then you are getting spiritual Amnesia when you can't say Mark 11 belongs to this bride or John 14 belongs to this bride then you've got amnesia and you forgot what a Son of God is that's what happened in the Garden of Eden Adam forgot he forgot what it was to control the wind and control the waves and tell the Lions to lay down he forgot but the message of the hour has come to shake you out of your Amnesia and make you remember you are always a son come on not a son yesterday but you were a son in the mind of God that's why the Baptist Church can't bring you to the place God's trying to bring you to that's why the Presbyterians can't do it that's why intellectuals can't do it it's because it'll take the mind of God to connect you back to the memory of the word that you come out of so you can remember the past but you can remember the future I don't have time to preach there that's good stuff though you can remember the past but you can remember the future just remember what the word speaks concerning you that's your future and 1 John chapter 3 again the scripture says beloved now we're the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we sh shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now of course this is also speaking of the change of the body so we never want to dismiss that I don't want you to think I've got off all on the spiritual side this is speaking of the change of the body but we do recognize this is speaking of the appearing of Christ before the Rapture and it's speaking brother bandom lets us know that we didn't know because it had ever been manifest but as Christ has manifested himself in this message to prove to us what real sunship is about and we can announce it now and say we are now Sons and Daughters of God now you you you you you got to you got to catch the point behind 1 John 3 because he's showing you sunship in dirt now it's not sunship in angelics and and I I just have to be honest some people have so distorted the idea of what true sunship is you're never going to get there amen it's like a carrot out in front of a rabbit and you're just never going to get there you're never going to make it because it has been placed so wrongly amen that you would have to be an angel to make it you you're going to talk about you're going to talking about sinless perfection and you're going to you're going to talk about never making a mistake and amen but it's a detriment to teach it it's a detriment to teach that to the children because amen you know and I know that none of us amen have ever escaped without Temptations and trials and problems on every hand but some reason we're still standing and it's not amen it's not amen because of how good we are it's because of what's in the dirt deity is in the dirt and it keeps us standing Hallelujah it keeps us standing gives us a right interpretation of sunship you see we are now Sons that's why I can say to you brother John amen I know probably you're not perfect and and I'm sure she thinks you are amen and your children think you are but probably down deep you know maybe there's something there I've never seen but that might be something there but I'll say this I can say over you you are now a son you see that I can say that with struggles and problems and issues amen and imperfections but we can announce we are now Sons we are right now Sons yeah because we wasn't being Sons when we got put in a Celestial body we are sons in a terrestrial bodybody said well you ain't never going to have the mistakes and all that that's true that's true but that's when I hit my Celestial but right now I'm in my terrestrial and unless you hadn't looked it up lately let me give you a definition of it it's a tabernacle of humiliation if you ain't got there yet just get some AG I went in for a checkup to doctor the other day and they told me some test they'd like to do to check my colon I said uhuh they said it's life saving I said well we'll [Laughter] wait it had to be life-threatening I don't know some of these things are humiliating yeah now you young people ain't got a clue so just you'll get there but as you as you accept the idea we are now Sons you're going to have to receive that knowing the parts of you that are dirt you're going to have to receive that now now it would be easier for the devil to talk you out of it right and say well now now someday you could be and I know you believe the message you're on the right line now but if you're going to make the claims that God has made you're going to have to start figuring some stuff out because it's hard to correlate we are now Sons with the idea of sunship so there must be something here that God is trying to blend together to show you that when you become a son you don't become Angelic but you become deity in dirt now I love how Jesus said it in Mark 11 he said I say unto you I like that don't you I wish I had the power amen of Christ to speak that to you as he spoke it to them I say unto you not somebody else coming but to you if you say unto this mountain be thou moved brother brandom actually said he said it to the little gods he said he said the only god without sin said it to the little Gods who were there if you say unto this mountain that it shall be moved now I say unto you so what we find is then that brother randam is showing us that a manifestation of the sons of God true Sons born Sons when they speak their word is going to be back do you know in Romans 8:19 the Bible said the expectation of the whole creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God now brother says it like this but this is the day of the manifestation of sons when the Mysteries that has been hid since the foundation of the world would be made known you your manifestation the word actually means to make known that God will make known his sons how does he make known his sons the mystery reveals the sunship amen no different than it was in Noah's day or Luther's day or any other day but this is the day of of the opening of The Seven Seals listen and unless you are under the election of God you will never see it you will never believe it you will never give your life to it but Satan would like to diminish that part of that and say oh anybody can believe it and anybody can see it who are you to be special let me tell you there are many kings that have longed to see this and we'll never see it there's been many rich men have long to hear the things what you hear oh they heard it but they didn't have an ear to hear it oh they saw it but they didn't see what you see in it many heard this message and threw it away as fanaticism or some kind of a lunatic but something in your dirt made you believe that your name was in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world and that Soul trumps my dirt there's a dominating Soul inside the dirt of this body am now I I'm standing here with with with with quote after quote listen the body is the Temple of Dynamics so we're waiting for the Dynamics to come not this bride brother B said the Easter message my Easter message to you is that the mechanics and the Dynamics are together the message brought the mechanics and the Dynamics together he joined god with his dirt bride it's called an invisible Union but it is a union made by the Holy Ghost and it brought the word which is Christ you are the hearer of the word and when something molded them two together it made a union between this dirt and that God and it brought Christ into his church amen that's why the prophet of God says your body becomes the Dynamics now I know it's dirt but let me say there's other people been born to the same dirt and when Jesus came where did his body come from it come from the dirt listen Jesus came of the same dirt you came out of that's right amen God bypassed the sexual act between man and woman but brother randam tells us that Mary's body produced that body of Jesus Amen and how did it happen because of the meal she ate come on she ate things that had dirt and potach and Ashes and vitamins of every kind and she ate and developed that body on the inside of her which was no more than what your mother did or any other mother did he had dirt the same as you got dirt come on church amen but when he came forth they announced over him Apostle Paul said he was the head of a new race he was the head of a new body brother B calls it a new race of people a God man amen yes sir Hallelujah come on we don't put up an idol you're the idol we don't have an image you're the image we don't have a masterpiece in the corner you're the Masterpiece come on now he remember but Michelangelo smoked his Masterpiece God smoked the Masterpiece of Jesus and brother said and so is it that this bride will be smitten out of the leodan age she will be smitten of God because she is his image and when she's smitten it's because she so matches the mind of God I don't have time to preach it to you let me just say it to you amen you so matched what he had in his mind he smoked you out of the age and called it a perfect bride and when Prophet stood there and said speak it was no different than Michelangelo saying to Moses speak he said speak because it was a perfect image Hallelujah come on Church let me announce it to you the way the prophet did the alpha has become the Omega you talk about the book of Acts bride I'm looking at a book of Acts bride you say I Got Dirt they had dirt come on Church there's more scriptures than Peter casting out Devils amen there's them of him running come on there's more scriptures than Paul standing there with a snake by you don't think about the swimming between between the the troubles and and laying on a piece of wood out in the middle without control amen not everything in their lives were Supernatural and Brilliant amen but we glorify the moments of their Brilliance in so that there was no other life we do it with brother brandom sure we do it with brother brandom sometimes we get to the place where we think that nobody was sick in brother bram's church that's the devil doing that to you there was a girl was in a wheelchair the entire time she was in brother bram's church that was a boy named Garnet Pete that died of the iron lung amen because he had trouble and brother Ram tells us he tells us that God he prayed for the boy and God left him in that condition brother R himself sick in his body you said preacher what are you talking about I'm trying to show you the devil has painted a picture that is not a real picture he's made you an angel and you're dirt you're dirt and God help us to remember we're just dirt oh but there's more dirt amen there's more than dirt there's more than dirt on the inside there's a soul there's a spirit on the inside and that come from God I didn't put it there I didn't buy it there but he put it in me and I say God Rule and Reign Over the dirt of this body hallelujah hallelujah my say uh oh I stopped time Joel chapter 2 the scripture tells us that God would pour out in the last days and it shall come to pass I'll pour my spirit upon all dirt come on it's not glorified bodies dirt and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your m shall see visions and the Bible tells us upon all the flesh he would pour out his Spirit come on now if the dirty rotten Pentecostals could experience the glory and the power of the outpouring of anointings and truths and blessings upon them what about Sons true Sons you've let the dirt of your body block you from the blessings of what God really has for your life you've allowed the devil to talk you out of it to make you fearful of it to make you not realize really where you belong who you are and what you're here for I'll tell you this you're here this morning as a daughter of Abraham sister Leah you're here to put the devil in his place and we know your dirt that's all right but let the dirt conquer the devil this morning and tell the devil come on Church put him on his face this morning brother bam says it he said in the last days I'll Ascend in abundance former and latter race rain he tells us the scriptures must be fulfilled and I love how he says it he says it like this wake up it's the time of your visitation from the Lord a refreshment of both former and latter rain that we be poured out in the last days C can I can I just say it from my heart to you without reading a lot let me just say what's really in my heart wake up the Thunders woke up the Bride come on church let let the thunder thunder in your life let the Revival break in your heart tell that dirt it happened in the [Applause] earth I always love Jesus's prayer when he began to say let thy will be done on Earth or in Earth as it is in heaven this Earth do you see what it is it is a time for an Awakening of the church woken a woke by the presence of God brother says God promised it and we've got it now again presence of God unrecognized he tells us very clearly he says listen he says now he's appearing in these meetings for a purpose but we've got to recognize his presence now he recognizes his presence is when the promised word of the age is Manifest now he just told us that Joel I second chapter has been promised and we got it we know Malachi 4 is promised proed and we got it Revelations 10 is promised and we got it Luke 17:30 is promised and we got it Revelations 5 is promised and we got it come on the seventh angel of Revelations 3 is promised and we got it the rising of Isaiah 60 was promised and we got it you you I can stand here longer with scriptures amen Matthew 17 is pro we got it you see what it is there's a promise and we got it and that should make us recognize his presence now if we're only recognize his presence by the sensation on the dirt come on then oh when we wake up in the middle of the night or when we had a bad day or we hit our thumb with a hammer or or something falls off the car or then we're not recognizing his presence we're only recognizing a stimulation or emotion but let me promise you he's there right there when you smash your finger watch what you say he's right there it's just as real then as it is others times because what's it doing it's releasing the message releases something to you and brother B said when that woman come and wash his feet it released something to her and he said what was it she had recognized it and it released forgiveness to her it released that to her it released forgiveness this message can bring you forgi it can release justification to you listen it released the power of God to them see what it is it's released joy and power and eternal life when you see the scriptures of your age fulfilled it should release Joy when there is no source of Joy when everything is darkened and every problem is every direction but we still have joy because it was not released to me by a pay raise it was not released to me by a car I like a joy on a car it's a good feeling amen but but but it's not the place that can sustain you in the trials of your life it's got to come from the source of when the word of God is opened up to you and you say I'm living in the greatest of all the ages and God is pouring out his Spirit Among Us and though I don't feel it or though I feel it I know he's right here present in this building oh I tell you when you begin to focus your mind like that brother you better get ready for victory hall because you're focusing Out the Devil and you're focusing in God do you know things have been released to you that's been held since Adam brother bam tells us the Redemption of this book he said all legal possession of everything that was lost from Adam and Eve he said it ought to be do it what it ought to do to that born again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract title deed means they possess everything that Adam and Eve lost oh there's a witness in this building this morning that that's the truth that you possess everything I I don't have time to preach in this area but but it's a it's a direct statement see now we didn't see that until that third pull came to us when the prophet stood there and received that sword in his hand he said it was the word in the hand of a prophet but thank God he released that to the church he released that to the bride he ministered that now and then comes to us and says that you're more than able to do that can we can we just read a a scripture concerning you brother man says we are right now spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom you believe that see in Romans 5:17 I'll give you the scripture by one man's death re death Reign by one how much more shall we receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ so we should reign in this life now brother bam uses this and he says right now somebody say right now right now right now we reign with Christ having Dominion look what what you says your dominion over sin somebody say sin sin the world the World the Flesh FLH and the devil so let's look again over sin over the world world over the dirtt over the devil over you are in Dominion right now with your problem you're still in Dominion you are anointed Sons and Daughters of God with your issues with the strains with the problems with the complexes with the come on church it's the truth anyhow you are still sons and and you know I I think of this now I could preach a whole service on the anointed bride y'all heard it amen not the anointed man the anointed people right anointed how many knows you're anointed already am just as Samuel poured oil over David a prophet poured the message over your life and Jesus said my words are spirit and life he took the seven sealed book and anointed you as the last day member of the bride of Christ and we stand this morning anointed just like David was anointed but I guarantee you he went right back to the field and wasn't not much changed because David didn't have much change after the anointing come and he might have wondered about some of those things I remember years ago preaching on am man a king in the wilderness and I was it would just to Mesmerize me that there was an anointed man running from armies that was an anointed man he was anointed it was marked it was true but he was hungry anyhow he was a king but he was wet and dejected amen he was a king but look at where he went and what he did and when he got put on the throne in Jerusalem he was just as much King in the cave as he was on the throne and one of these days you'll say on the throne I know you're going to the throne but you're just as much a king this morning as you will be one day when you set upon the throne of God already anointed and that's what the devil hates that's really what Satan hates because what he's trying to do is he's trying to use these things to stop now if you watch the scriptures brother bam says he says it like this in Israel and the church he said all h can't stop it because it's ordained of Jesus Christ and it will be Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail what is it what kind of church see Flesh and Blood amen had not revealed that to him but my Father which is in heaven is revealed that spiritual Revelation by the Holy Ghost of the word of God and on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it she's moving onen now watch brother B is telling us there won't be no stopping this this is moving anyhow Amen in questions and answers brother bam said listen you people thinking that that can stop it you could stop the sun quicker you ain't going to stop it because it's ordained to move on oh thus sayith the Lord y'all know the scriptures amen you know the prophet's prophecies thus sayith the Lord the move is on for the bride you could stop that son quicker then you can stop this dirt in this building this morning ah I tell you the move is on I love how brother bam says it he says there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet a promise of God death can't stop it the Grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it because we are more than conquerors that's what brother man talks about when he sees the vision Beyond uh out there in Finland sees that little boy raising up out of the off the side of the road I know there's people don't believe that out there but I'm sorry it's for the Believers and brother bam tells it and and and he's talking about it he says and when I recognized where I was at now now now folks you you can take a long time on this story but let's just make a point brother bandam put that in the fly leaf of his Bible years before it happened and his memory had got a little fuzzy because of all the meetings he was in and he was in a strange country and he runs up on a wreck and he says somebody's coming and said brother bradam you need to come and look at this and he said and it made me a bit sick he said I have a child about that age at home and he said I I just couldn't hardly even look at it he said so I decided I would turn and walk away and go back get in the car listen you see he wasn't feeling super spiritual he wasn't feeling like let me at it I I I you know I'm going to fix this problem he said I'm going to go back to the car and something laid its hand on me and he said and I turned and looked and he said oh my goodness wait a minute there's the rocks and there's the tree and there's the car and there's the boy you see what he done he recognized the presence of God manifesting a vision that was above the dirt of the man William brandom something was about to happen and brother R said all I had to do now was just play my part that's all I had to do he said all hell never stopped that boy from raising up and he spoke and said in the name of Jesus and the boy had to stand up I tell you brother amen when you see you're in the midst of the fulfillments of scripture it doesn't matter the condition you find yourself in it don't matter if you find yourself spiritual or super spiritual it matters can you see the unfolding of the word and you're place in that word now nothing's going to stop it not even death remember Jesus going to J's daughter remember what they said don't trouble the master she she's already died it didn't stop him he said I'll just go wake her because he'd already promised he would go Waker listen mountains cannot stop you Seas cannot stop you look where God told Moses you go get my people and come back on this mountain and worship me and a red sea got in the way but it didn't stop them because God said you go get them and come back here I know discouragement must have rose up when they was looking at that sea but don't forget there's a promise don't forget that God LED them there and whenever God leads you to a place where it seems there is no way there's no possibilities that's when God makes a way because he's a supernatural god with Supernatural characteristics and we are a supernatural seed that belongs to him he said you're going to be there you're going to be there don't let a trial stop you come on Abraham 25 years waiting on a child you'd have thought that been enough but while he's got a young 14year old boy God says to him take him up on the mountain that never stopped Abraham he never stopped and threw down the thing said well I just can't serve God no more cuz I certainly can't understand this but when God required it it was an Unstoppable thing in Abraham's heart if the boy dies God will raise him up again I received him from the dead and God can bring him back from the dead don't you understand this morning that there's a God who Reigns over the situations of our lives and the devil can't do nothing to you until first he checks it with our God and if God let him do it it means you are more than able to overcome the situation well I feel like speaking in tongues you got a reason this morning because God if he let it happen brother Aaron he's God enough to protect you in the middle of it he just wants to see what you're going to do about it Hallelujah I wish I by myself for a minute somebody said well brother Wayne you ain't running the trials I run into you might not have run into mine yet either let me say this if a preacher tells you that this is a fly bed of ease brother bam said this he said either he's deceiving you or he's or he's not a Christian he's never had the experience if somebody tells you Christianity means everything's going to be okay they've lied to you they deceived you amen because it ain't going to be okay amen man there's going to be trials and there's going to be troubles amen it's not a fiery bed of ease and I'll just put it out there it's not going to be amen but there's a God on the other side of the [Music] trial I love how brother BR says that he said when when we come to these trials now I've just spent a lot of time teaching on the deity in the dirt dirt is to be tried to see what's on the inside of it why do we come to these troubles what makes these things come why would a Christian ever be perplexed why wouldn't everything run perfect for a Christian why wouldn't it just run perfect brother bam says this he said even sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners because it is written many is the afflictions of the righteous oh but I like the rest of that scripture but God strange feelings and strange things would that would be beyond our understanding it's always done for our good just can't understand it but it's for our good can't understand it see it's got to be Faith he says not sometimes understanding but what do we got to have we got to believe his word that it's going to work somehow it's going to work for our good if we could just grasp that today with all of our troubles and the the none of us are immune from them if we would realize that these things are for our good oh God I wished it hadn't been put in there but it is Psalms 34:19 reads it reads perfectly many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord Deliver us out of them all Paul says it in 2 Timothy 3 persecutions afflictions which come unto me at Antioch amen and econom and leria what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecutions now I'm I'm I'm I'm preaching the Bible to you for a moment to M Timothy and the minister of God from Thessalonians he said our fellow labor in the gospel to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that you are appointed there unto you know afflictions are appointed under Christians come on wake yourself up you know when you come to be a Christian afflictions you have appointed yourself to get in the line of persecutions amen for verily I say we told you that you would suffer tribulations even as it has come come to pass Timothy go preach go preach the gospel but you're going to suffer you know it's appointed unto him Peter says it like this wherein you greatly Rejoice though for a reason you need be you are in Heavenly you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith be more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried in a fire it might be found and praise and honor and Glory at the pering of Christ in Isaiah chapter 48 he says it this way in the 10th verse behold I have refined thee but not with silver I have chosen thee in the furnace of Affliction In the Heat of your trial that's the way God decided he was going to purge this dirt Amen in according to scripture in Isaiah 1:25 I will turn my hand upon thee and purely Purge away thy drug cross and take away all thy 10 in job 23 and10 he said he knoweth the way that I take I love that song Amen God bless you amen your choir sings that sometimes wow what a song He knoweth the way that I take and when he tried me I shall come forth as I don't know if I ever told some of you this story but I I was going to make gold one time that stuff's worth a lot of money I didn't know it was illegal to manufacture gold but but I was Googling like crazy what's the recipes for this stuff you know it's a couple thousand bucks an ounce you know I mean if you just could make three O A Day You' do pretty good you know I was trying to figure it out and in that study I discovered something I didn't know uh and I think they just discovered it in the recent years that gold actually comes from the stars that it's not original uh from the earth that it was in the stars and when the stars die they crushed the fallen stars crushed in the ground and gold deposits fell in and then through the years of evolution and wind and Distortion they get mixed into the Earth and then quartz and tin and and all kinds of pirates and and all of it gets in there and it gets mixed around and if you can see then that sometimes dirt is very valuable yeah that's why when they sell dirt a lot of times they want to know do you want the water rights do you want the the the the gym rights or amen because the oil rights the gas rights because owning the piece of property is not always just about the dirt it's about what's in the dirt and we found out some of you amen were born and it's just dirt like any other dirt but there are deposits of deity that is laying in that dirt and it got mingled up with law and traditions and it got mingled up with church traditions and it it got mingled up none of y'all probably have any of that it got mixed up with calling traditions and amen it got mixed up with pain traditions and amen and situations and amen even even some English got mixed in some of this deity amen but you see what the dirt has deity in it but God has got to purify the deity part of the dirt amen you you see God ain't throwing away the dirt he's just purifying his part of that dirt Hallelujah and sometimes Amen brother Bram says it's just like too much brandom in me it's too much Lawson in me he said listen my greatest enemy is William brandom and he was a prophet of God come on church we than our greatest enem is the guy down the street or the person in the Pew next to us or maybe our wife or our family or some some some hater that's hating on us and we think oh that's our enemy no it's not our enemy our greatest enemy is ourselves it's how we car oursel how we think about things how we look upon things amen and when God gets a hold of a man he begins to put him in a place that he can take out the human part and take out the the places of imperfection that he might purify and bring us to a part that he could use us now now I know amen some of us reaches places and and and there's lots of questions and I thank God there's answers I thank God there's answers and you're a Bible reader in Revelation Chapter 2 in the Smur age in the 10th verse you'll watch this Jesus says to them fear none of these things which Thou shalt suffer fear none of these things which thou shallal suffer I think that's good for us today amen fear none of these things which you should suffer because tribulation was a part of those First Ages and brother bam tells us this but Paul applied this to the mass of Christians in the book of Hebrews in the 10th chapter when he said I call to remembrance the former days after you illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions now now look at this it this this isn't something amen that just comes on one individual this isn't just something that hits one family or one church amen it hits all churches it hits all human beings but when it comes upon the dirt that has deity in it then it's there for a purpose see the thing is is if we're if we're not Christians then we're suffering without reason right am me let me just say this brother R says it like this in the Samar Church age it's one of the great readings if you've never read it this this this is Landmark to you as a Believer now the Lord all God Almighty says I know that he's walking in the midst of the people and he's the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution history says he didn't does he hold the stem of the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation oh my goodness I am not unmindful of your suffering but what a stumbling block that is to so many people like Israel they wondered if God really loves them and how could he be just and loving if he would stand and watch his people suffer how many times have you heard people say that very thing how could it be just and loving God that would watch somebody suffer in Malachi 1 verse 1:3 for the burden of the word of the Lord was upon Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord I love Jacob and I hated Esau and I laid mountains and Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love see they thought that love meant no suffering listen I tell you what if there ever was an age that had misrepresented God's love it's the age we're living in they have so mingled that up to make God of Ven and the devil somehow he's the hero amen but that God's never meant love was not suffering he said they thought it meant like a baby with parental care but God said that he loves us and it was an elect of Love well amen somebody clear the aisle it's elective love you know that's why some people won't read this church age book right there that very statement because it's elective love amen I I believe in election and I believe it's an elective love and the proof of this love is election he love is elective and the proof of it is his election his love was proven truly by the fact that we were chosen under salvation because if God ha given us salvation through sanctification of his spirit and belief in the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul now think about Paul that great Apostle but look at the death he died he may conf commit you to suffering as he did to job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose he if he didn't have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose amen that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect and established and strengthened and settled we have taught this generation everything but how to suffer come on church amen we have taught everything but how to suffer how to meet the suffering of the age we're living in God put you in the most evil Dark Age that's ever been in but he put something on the inside of you a supreme Grace for a supreme hour to be standing in the middle of these trials I know somebody said well brother Wayne I've had to suffer listen let me tell you this I I'll tell you there's going to be suffering amen and we've got to learn how to face it and how to meet it and not fall apart at it and say oh God I must not be a Christian I I must have wronged him somewhere there something in my past or something in there but you know what's amazing I've never noticed I I don't know if you've ever noticed this amen but sometimes it's way up in a person 's life and they're trying to look all the way back through there to find little something but in all of that they never see where the Holy Ghost gave them New Birth where God forgave them he was healings went on this happened this happened this happened do you think God could have got you this far if there been some kind of big impediment back there in your first part of your birth it's the devil lying to you to try to undermine you in the time of your trial I tell you this it's time to stand up and face the devil and say if I'm going through a trial it's because God has deemed me worthy to suffer for his name and I will praise him in the middle of my trial the sun could have praised even the trees could have praised him and the Stars could have praised him but he wanted your praise and he wanted your praise in the face of your trial and in the face of your problem I'm sorry I feel like preaching I tell you we have got a sit situation in this age where there are minifold proes there there are there are manifold things there are there are sufferings in every which direction but there is an eternal purpose of God Ephesians 1:8 said Heath abounded toward us all wisdom and Prudence that's a lot of wisdom folks if somebody took all their wisdom we're talking about the all-wise God hath abounded toward us he has put forth all his wisdom toward us then that trial you're going through is not there to destroy you because you are God's purpose in this age but he's after More Than Dirt he's after more than that he's after the deposit of the deity that's in your life to make it shine like pure gold I tell you I never was early in my life when I studied brother random some of the stories he told I I didn't understand like when he talked about them coming back there and seeing bethoven or mzark and he had a waste can full of papers and somebody said they picked one of them up and was reading them they said what' you throw these away for these are wonderful songs and they and and I believe it was PA HOV he looked back at him he said because I'm not after a song I'm after a masterpiece amen and the waste baskets are full of church joiners amen but he's not after a church Joiner he's after a son or a daughter that can stand the tribulations and the trials of the age we're living in oh we might suffer a little while but after the suffering is over it will not be compared with the glory that will be revealed in this bride it's just dirt but there's deity in this dirt oh in Romans 8 who could have wrote it better than Paul all things work together somebody say all except all that's a very inclusive word all things it don't say all things are good but all things work for the good in other words if God be for you who can be against you cuz whatever the devil does to mean it to your heart God turns it and refines you into a son and makes these parts of your life and brings passion into you I love how brother bam says that God harnesses trouble he puts a bit in its mouth and makes it obeying troubles bring you closer to fellowship with God as long as I live I'll never forget a prophet talking about his cross-eyed little girl laying there and when I become a father I thought about it I thought about a daughter amen because of his own personal choices and his wife and the the the reluctance to follow the will of God Amen they look at the mess they got into and he's standing there knowing if I'd have just followed God yes sir and that that cross-eyed girl brother man said years later he would stand on the platform and brother John when a crosseyed child would come in front of him he would all cross their rise somebody say who done that he said I did it but there was such passion in that man had suffered so that his faith was a a place that he could make eyes come un cross oh God give us passion this morning not just a church joining not just a coming to church give us passion passion to serve God passion to see the mercies of God see it com to life see fathers and mothers and Children and Families framed in the power work of almighty God passion for it amen troubles yeah they bring us closer brother ma says it he said he put strength in us and you see job himself learn Jesus learned amen The Obedience by the things that he suffered brother bam says it like this I love how how brother Braham defines things and though he was a son yet he suffered Jesus and very plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and Paul has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God or suffering for him would come to a place of perfection therefore in James my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diver Temptations who would have ever thought that Temptations would be part of your suffering so brother Wayne I'm saved I know you are you received God but Temptations sometimes you suffer with Temptations you got to ask yourself why does God stand by have you ever asked that you ever as a Christian say God how are you how are you allowing this how is this happening and brother B says why does he do it the reason is written in Romans 8 verse 17 and 18 if you if you're a Bible stud Romans 8 verse 17-18 you're going through something you're asking God why there's the answer amen he said if your children then HS and HS of God and join HS with Christ if be that you suffer with him we must also be glorified together for I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer we cannot reign with him you have to suffer the reason for this character simp simply is not made without suffering you see somebody's life and you say oh what a rich Christian what a what a rich spirit in that man there's suffering behind that brother Ray ain't here this morning but ain't person in here ain't never shook hands with Brother Ray and think my what a rich Spirit there's suffering behind that there's prayer behind that it that that's not handed out like tokens right amen yes sir it's molded brother Ram says it character simply is not made without suffering character is Victory it's not a gift a man without character cannot reain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants to share his throne with us on the same basis he overcome and sit down in his father's Throne we have to overcame to sit down with him and these temporary sufferings we go through is not even worthy to be compared with the glory in Revelations 20 it's written of you that you will set on Thrones when Paul speaks of our Affliction he said it's a light Affliction but for a moment and when Peter speaks of it he said don't think it strange now that's that's the point isn't it amen don't think it strange don't think it strange that suffering is coming cuz that's where it becomes so powerful is the way you think about it I if I had time to preach to you this morning on The Interpreter Satan and how when he attacked Eve she had the word of God and he destroyed all of her peace and all of her joy and ripped her out of a perfect atmosphere because he made her think a certain way and the moment suffering comes in your life you can suffer and you can have infirmities and you can face them with glory and thankfulness and you can face them with joy amen or you can allow Satan to get a hold of that and you can start thinking that something's wrong and something's troubl and it's this is a repution and this is a reaping of and this is this and after a little while he's got you so embattled because you let him interpret to you think of it then you got to arm yourself in Matthew 16 it's a beautiful picture of Jesus and Peter and when Peter and Jesus are talking I love how he starts the conversation because who do you say I am I love how he made that clear remember because he said well some say but he didn't leave it there he changed the level and said who do you say and when Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God God he got the clarity that Peter knew who he was and then he tells us this amen that he was going to build the church upon that confession and then from there told Peter I'm going to go to Jerusalem and suffer and that is exactly when Peter got all upset and said Lord we're not going to let you go suffer yeah far be it that it could happen you are deity you're the son of God you got Christ in you you can't go down there and suffer like you're IM mortal man like you're just dirt you can't go to the Cross like a thief you can't suffer and Jesus said get behind me devil and the moment that something tells you that Christians can't suffer you say get behind me devil you get behind me my Lord suffered on a cross Paul had his head chopped off amen John was bold and all the disciples dead they died every one of them deaths you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about something greater amen something greater than this life we have got so focused on this life and Easy Living and all the things that are happening in this age there are things that are Beyond this real there is a reality Above This reality this dirt is here I know and they're suffering but it's just for a moment but on the other side there is an immortal body there are Thrones there is a rain with him listen this morning when we come to this word brother Bram said it very clearly he said there never would have been a crown without a cross there never would have been a rainbow without a flood job could have never stood up and said I know my redeemer liveth unless he would have first set it from an ash Heap amen he said the Hebrew children could have never seen the Son of God until they got in the Fire come on church amen they never saw him until they got in the fire but when they went in pound they come out loosed and brother B said there you are that's all the trial will ever do to you it'll loose you from the bonds amen when they come out they didn't even smell like smoke I think that must have been an awesome morning amen when they walked by and said look hey man only thing y'all did to us is free us and I tell you what if you ever really suffer you ever really go through a trial and you really get in contact with God the only thing that'll ever do to you is free you to say I know my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms eat this B flesh in my body I shall see God brother bam said it I love how he says it brother Dallas he says he said Abraham saw Elohim he says he said oh he said the Hebrew children saw the Son of God he said all of them saw manifestations and things but job saw something that would comfort the heart of every man he said he saw the resurrection and he said I know my redeemer liveth I and I I tell you listen this morning if you could just see the resurrection power you could say my redeemer is alive amen it don't matter what they do to me amen if this body goes down God will raise it up again if it gets sick he'll kill it [Applause] oh yeah God has allowed this age and every age to come to this point in closing I want you to remember this and I want you to be mindful as Peter said be mindful The Words which were spoken I want you to be mindful of the prophecies concerning your life when you're suffering be mindful be mindful of the things that have been said about you the words that have been prophesied concerning you be mindful that that the that the trial of your faith the suffering of this life actually has purpose in it listen you you you you watch how how brother random places this and and you know I like to pass out you ask me a question there in the Bible study the other night if you remember last Sunday we ended with a song Brother David come up and sang a song Grace now you you you see watch how the Holy Spirit was so work Paul said this he Saidi went to the Lord and besought him three times that this would depart me and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee and my strength is made perfect most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ might rest upon me somebody says what does that mean Satan buffeted Paul brother B said here's what it was he said he prayed that God would heal him on three different occasions and Satan was buffeting him and brother Bram said he was hitting him blow after blow after blow and Paul was crying unto the Lord Lord I know you're a Healer but if you watch this this is in the moment of when Paul went beyond the curtain of time and he says unless I be exalted above measure God has allowed the devil to Buffet me to keep me humble blow after blow God's answer to Paul is my grace you said preacher what are you doing I I want to show you something what brother Bram said he said he didn't promise a flowy bed of ease he promised Grace sufficient to get through it he didn't promise you a life without Temptation he promised you Grace to get through it somebody told Brother brandham they said brother brandham said Do You Believe In Divine Healing he said I do he said then why does people still have pain he said well do you believe in Divine salvation he said yeah he said then why do people still have temptations he said that's why God said with every Temptation I give you a way of Escape I will not put more upon you than you can bear he said brother Wayne I'm in I'm under great Temptation and in the moment of Temptation grace is sufficient to give you a way of Escape I feel from the depths of my soul that this is more than just a sermon I feel it's a message and I feel the message is saying I really believe from my heart grace is sufficient for the dirt of this day won't you stand to your feet with me this morning Christians you're not promised a flowery bed of ease but you are promised Grace I'm a little bit in overtime sorry Grace sufficient aren't you glad you're going to hit a trial there's going to be Grace you're going to have Temptation there going to be Grace man one time heard me preach and he come to me he said I've done everything I could do he was suffering with a chronic illness he says to me and it was a it was I mean it was it was like a blood pressure or something I think but because he wasn't getting healed he began to question healing and I remember I remember going before the Lord it wasn't here in this assembly or part of this assembly it's way down south over on the east coast and I remember going in and praying I'm begin to ask the Lord and in the middle of that this scripture came to me he said my grace is sufficient sometimes you're facing things that seems almost lifelong yeah and you say well that there's just no end to it yeah but the trial can never stop a son or a daughter of God his grace is sufficient I'd like to remind you this morning that you're a Son of God a daughter of God I'd like to remind you that there's a blood for your sins I'd like to remind you that when God gave you the Holy Ghost deity came into your dirt and I don't want you to ever forget that whatever you're facing whatever suffering whatever trial whatever tribulation they will be manifold Temptations and there will be Trials of every kind but if deity is in the dirt it can only make you stronger can only make you more powerful now when I preached that as a 20-year-old kid I believed it but I've lived long enough now that I could stand with job and I can say I know amen amen I heard brother Bram read that scripture this morning and he and he quoted the part of it where job said I could take a pen and engrave it in a mountain I know and when he said that it just struck me it meant that that was such a solid place in job's life that he didn't care to put it anywhere it would be an eternal truth am I know that's right and do you know God is trying to get you to the same place I know that's where he's bringing you when the bride knows who she is the rapture is going to go this word your sufferings your trials are all positioning you into a place where you can stand and bring his presence [Music] my brother B [Music]
