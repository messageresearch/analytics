[0:00] If we could this morning, let's just
[0:01] stand and we're going to uh ask the Lord
[0:04] and just if we bow our hearts
[0:07] together. Amen. We'll come together for
[0:09] just a moment here in prayer. Amen. I'm
[0:13] I'm trying to gather myself so I can
[0:16] speak. I'm sorry. I just about don't
[0:17] have any breath. The anointing up here
[0:19] and Amen. So, let's just pray. Father,
[0:22] we ask you for your mercy, Lord, that
[0:24] your strength would just come here,
[0:27] Lord, upon every heart and every life as
[0:29] we feel that great sweeping presence of
[0:32] you as you move through the building.
[0:35] Lord, the mortal body almost don't know
[0:37] what to do. And Lord, one of these
[0:39] mornings you're going to give us a new
[0:42] body where we can sit around your
[0:44] throne, Lord, in fellowship under the
[0:46] atmosphere throughout eternity. Father,
[0:50] now this morning as we come together to
[0:52] to look into your word, I pray, Lord,
[0:54] that you would quicken our minds, you
[0:57] would quicken our understandings, Lord,
[1:00] that you would give us mercy and peace
[1:02] in our heart. And I just ask you now
[1:04] that you would take this word, that you
[1:07] would speak to the need of your people.
[1:08] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. And
[1:12] amen. If you have your Bibles, I'd like
[1:15] to go into the scripture in the book of
[1:17] Ephesians, the sixth chapter. And I'm
[1:19] going to read here uh from the sixth
[1:22] verse and the 17th verse. Sixth verse
[1:26] and seven uh six and 17. I'm just going
[1:29] to read the one scripture and let you be
[1:32] seated. and take the helmet of
[1:36] salvation and the sword of the
[1:39] spirit which is the word of God. You may
[1:45] be seated this morning. I want to uh
[1:48] speak from here again if you were with
[1:50] us Thursday night. Uh we took from here
[1:53] from Ephesians 6 for the dividing of the
[1:57] soul and the spirit. And we were looking
[2:00] uh at this uh from this area because the
[2:02] word of God of course the word is the
[2:05] sword of the spirit. And of course
[2:08] Hebrews the 4:12 uh Hebrews 4:12 said
[2:10] that it is a discerner between the
[2:13] thought and the intent and between the
[2:16] spirit and the soul which teaches us
[2:19] that there then is a difference between
[2:21] the spirit and the soul. And then if you
[2:24] can begin to understand the difference
[2:26] between the two, it takes you into
[2:28] another level of faith or another realm
[2:30] of faith and brings you into this. Now I
[2:33] I would like to take this for an a
[2:35] context thought if I would just for a
[2:37] title. I want to speak to you on a
[2:39] revival of the real you. A revival of
[2:43] the real you. Now, brother Brandon was
[2:46] saying things that are to be that this
[2:48] old tabernacle here, this body is like
[2:50] an old coat that you wear that you once
[2:54] wear. Now, but
[2:56] inside of there, it see you are inside
[3:01] there. So, it's like a wearing a coat,
[3:03] but the coat ain't you. You're on the
[3:06] inside there. So, this human body is
[3:08] like a coat that you wear. And he said,
[3:11] "See, it's not you. You are on the
[3:13] inside of that body. You, the spirit of
[3:18] God, is on the inside of that body. Do
[3:21] you hear how he identified you? You, the
[3:24] spirit of God, are on the inside of that
[3:27] body. See, your body, see, your real
[3:31] self is on the inside of this old cult
[3:34] that you call like William Brandom or
[3:36] Susie Jones or whoever it is. See, it's
[3:40] on the inside of that. Now, now the
[3:43] people, they've seen you, but all
[3:44] they've seen is this. And what what what
[3:48] you was, your real you is on the inside
[3:51] of that. Amen. But the old code itself
[3:53] is just bore the image. So the real you
[3:56] is on the inside of that. So here here's
[3:59] from the message of the inside man,
[4:01] 1953. If you haven't heard it, you'd
[4:03] love to hear it. Amen. The inside man.
[4:05] And brother said, "Do you ever think
[4:07] inside of your body is another man?
[4:09] There's another man inside the body.
[4:11] It's the spirit man. Amen. Now, uh just
[4:14] a couple of these quotes you heard
[4:16] Thursday. And the prophet of God will
[4:18] say, "See, the out the scientific part
[4:20] of a man, the see, the taste, the feel,
[4:22] the smell, the hear is only to contact
[4:26] this earthly home." But it's the inside
[4:29] man, which is the spirit that contacts
[4:32] God. Amen. That's the part that contacts
[4:35] God. Now, this is the inside man. See,
[4:38] if that inside man is of God, it is the
[4:42] spirit of God. If the inside man is of
[4:46] God, it's the spirit of God that's
[4:49] inside the man. Amen. Here it is.
[4:52] Brother Ram tells us this. He tells us
[4:54] about Apostle Paul when he was in the
[4:56] shipwreck and he was warming his fire,
[4:58] hands over the fire, and the serpent
[5:00] reached out and bit him. Now, that bit
[5:02] the man. The serpent bit the man. It bit
[5:04] the outside man. But brother Bram said,
[5:07] "But inside of him, every little cell of
[5:10] blood is alive." And there you all, he
[5:13] said, "They were charged full of the
[5:15] Holy Ghost." Certainly. Amen. That's how
[5:18] they walked on water. That's how they
[5:19] done great miracles because they were
[5:22] perfectly in harmony with God. See the
[5:24] very Holy Spirit that made the heavens
[5:27] and the earth had so charged this man
[5:30] with power. He says till death, amen,
[5:33] the thing of the serpent wouldn't even
[5:35] go into his body because he was full of
[5:38] the spirit the same as he was full of
[5:40] blood. That that is a refrigerator
[5:42] quote. He was as full of spirit as he
[5:45] was full of blood. Amen. And every every
[5:48] part of him was charged with that Holy
[5:51] Ghost. Brother Bam tells us the secret
[5:53] that he was ordained to be somewhere so
[5:55] the serpent couldn't kill him because
[5:57] Paul was supposed to go somewhere. So
[6:00] God had a purpose for his life. And God
[6:02] has a purpose for your life. How many
[6:04] knows things are to be what brother Ram
[6:06] said your purpose is? He says your
[6:08] purpose is your duty is to express God
[6:11] to this nation. That you're supposed to
[6:14] express the gene of God to this nation.
[6:17] That is your purpose. Now the of course
[6:19] that this man now is going to feed on
[6:21] psychology and he he will feed on
[6:24] something intellectual but the inside
[6:27] man he feeds on the word of God. He
[6:31] feeds on the word of God. Amen. And
[6:33] that's where the real great fight is
[6:35] tonight. Amen. Or this morning for us is
[6:38] is that man of course. Amen. God took
[6:42] his heart, but the devil took his mind.
[6:45] And he looks at things with his eye
[6:47] through his human things, but the heart
[6:49] is on the inside. And God gave eyes to
[6:52] that heart that they might be able to
[6:54] see. Now, we're living in a blind age.
[6:56] We're living in a blind leodya. Amen.
[6:59] But God on the inside of a believer,
[7:02] there's a door in your heart called the
[7:04] door of sight. And when God gets in that
[7:07] door, he opens the door of sight that
[7:09] you might be able to see. Amen. So
[7:12] that's exactly why the Bible says that
[7:14] you should pray that your that you have
[7:16] the anointing of your eyes that you
[7:19] might be able to see. That it takes
[7:21] anointing to see. Amen. Because it's the
[7:23] inside. Now, when the Holy Spirit begins
[7:26] to fall, it falls on all flesh.
[7:28] According to Joel chapter 2, that God
[7:31] would pour out his spirit on all flesh.
[7:33] But not all flesh is saved, but the
[7:35] spirit pours out on all flesh. And some
[7:38] people get the rain and they get it
[7:40] right on their flesh. And that's as deep
[7:42] as it goes. And some people go a little
[7:44] deeper even into gifts and things and it
[7:47] falls into their spirit, which is the
[7:49] second realm. But there's a third realm
[7:51] of man called the soul. Amen. And if the
[7:55] spirit ever gets down in that soul,
[7:58] that's where the real germ lays is in
[8:00] the soul of man. And if that gene, amen,
[8:04] is inside of you that come from God and
[8:07] you get that spirit in that third realm,
[8:10] there's an eternal life that is
[8:11] quickened on the inside of that
[8:13] believer. Brother Bam said the physical
[8:15] will contact the physical and the
[8:17] spiritual will contact the spiritual,
[8:19] but inside of that you got a soul and
[8:22] that soul is a gene that come from God.
[8:26] That's pretty powerful, brother Isaiah.
[8:28] That's pretty powerful. Amen. If you got
[8:30] a gene that come from God, it's no
[8:33] different than your heavenly father
[8:35] giving you a gene than your earthly
[8:36] father giving you a gene. Then out of
[8:39] that gene comes a life. And out of that
[8:41] life comes character and virtue and
[8:44] potential and ability. And it matters
[8:47] what seedline you are concerning what
[8:50] kind of character or what kind of virtue
[8:52] is there. Listen, you're not going to
[8:54] add amen uh dove feathers to a crow.
[8:58] Amen. You you can't stick them in. You
[9:00] can stick them in, but they won't last.
[9:02] Amen. And and but it's got to grow. And
[9:05] so is it with the seed gene of life. It
[9:08] has the potential of God on the inside
[9:10] of that seed. And if you put the life on
[9:13] the seed, it begins to manifest every
[9:16] virtue that is in God. You don't have to
[9:19] work it up or pump it up. You got to
[9:21] just let it grow. Amen. And it'll grow
[9:24] because it's in there. It comes from the
[9:26] soul. and things are to be. Brother Bram
[9:28] says it this. He said, "If you don't
[9:30] line up with the word, there's something
[9:31] wrong." You see, then your real father
[9:34] ain't God. Because the real start is in
[9:37] your soul. Amen. And before there was
[9:40] even a spirit, there is your soul. And
[9:42] if that soul didn't come from God, then
[9:44] it's not a germ of God to begin with.
[9:46] And you're deceived. You're just in a
[9:49] patch of weeds bearing the world's
[9:50] records. Amen. Now, he's being pretty
[9:52] straight here. Amen. If you can't if if
[9:55] the word don't mean nothing to you. He's
[9:58] saying the soul didn't come from God
[10:00] because a soul that come from God has
[10:02] the life of God on the inside of it.
[10:05] Doesn't mean that you're perfect or
[10:07] you're free from mistakes, but it means
[10:09] there's a desire in you to do the will
[10:12] of God in this generation. Now, because
[10:15] that real start is in your soul. Now, I
[10:17] I I tell you there the the significance
[10:20] of that. I cannot overemphasize that the
[10:23] start is in the soul. That's why brother
[10:25] Brandham said the Holy Ghost is a gift.
[10:27] He says but it's a temporal gift. But
[10:30] the real gift is that soul. It's that
[10:33] gene that come from God. Do you see if
[10:35] it come from God it can't be lost. Amen.
[10:38] That's why the Bible said that there
[10:40] should come in the last days Christ and
[10:42] false Christ that would deceive the very
[10:45] elected if it were possible. Other
[10:48] words, everybody could get under the
[10:50] anointing, but there's going to be some
[10:52] people with a gene seed of life inside
[10:54] of them. You you can no more deceive
[10:57] them than you could deceive God because
[10:59] the very life in them. In other words,
[11:02] they're not acting like Christians. They
[11:04] are Christians. They're not acting like
[11:06] message believers. They are message
[11:08] believers. They're they're not acting
[11:10] like children of God. They are the
[11:12] children of God. Amen. It's not an
[11:14] impersonation. It is a reality.
[11:17] Amen. That's where the real start comes
[11:20] from. Now, if you're watching and when
[11:22] their eyes were open, Brother Bam talks
[11:24] about the little woman at the well. He
[11:26] loves this. He loves this story. He
[11:27] tells it so many times. Amen. He tells
[11:30] the woman at the well. You know why he
[11:31] tells it, don't you? Because it
[11:33] represents his own ministry
[11:35] because the Messiah sign that was given
[11:37] to the woman at the well was given to a
[11:40] woman because it would be given to the
[11:43] church in the end time. See Jesus said,
[11:45] "A wicked and adulterous generation
[11:47] shall seek after a sign, but there will
[11:49] be no sign given except the sign of
[11:52] Jonas." Remember the sign of the
[11:53] resurrection. The sign of the
[11:55] resurrection would be that when Jesus
[11:57] did the same things in our generation
[11:59] that he did in that generation, but
[12:02] because he was the Messiah, he was only
[12:04] going to people who were looking for
[12:06] him. So the Samaritan was looking for
[12:08] him, the Jew was looking for him, the
[12:11] Gentile was not expecting a Messiah.
[12:14] They were idle packing heathens. They
[12:16] had no prophecies of a Messiah coming.
[12:18] But the Samaritan understood that the
[12:21] Messiah was coming and the Jew
[12:23] understood the Sam the Messiah was
[12:25] coming. So he gave his sign to the Jew
[12:27] and the Samaritan. But because there was
[12:30] no Gentiles to give it to, he took a
[12:33] woman who was a Samaritan. Amen. Who was
[12:36] a harlot representing what the church
[12:38] would be when God found them in the end
[12:41] time. And when he walked up to the
[12:43] whale, he looked right down. And brother
[12:45] Bam said it like this. That little
[12:47] arrogant, ill-fed woman, probably poor
[12:50] kid had been turned out in the street.
[12:52] He said, "But right down in her heart,
[12:54] she was predestinated. It was a
[12:57] predestinated seed laying there." See,
[12:58] she was a seed to start with. Before she
[13:02] was an arrogant little girl in the
[13:03] street, she was a seed to start with
[13:06] before her life. Amen. A a prostitution.
[13:09] She was a seed to start with. Amen. And
[13:12] you can't put enough trouble on that
[13:15] seed. Amen. To cover up what God can't
[13:18] redeem it out of the m. It really
[13:21] doesn't matter where he finds that seed.
[13:23] It's his seed and it belongs to him and
[13:26] he can get it out because he belong is
[13:29] still God. Look at what he done. Look
[13:31] how he found her. Brother Bam said that
[13:33] little seed was laying in there. Amen.
[13:35] Skip to the bottom of the paragraph. But
[13:36] this little woman, her life was all
[13:39] marred up. See that outward person? The
[13:41] life was all marred up. But down in
[13:44] there, there was a little bit of light
[13:47] way down in there was a seed waiting.
[13:50] And as sure as a light can strike a
[13:52] seed, it's germatized and it's going to
[13:55] live. And identification, brother Bam
[13:57] says something about her. He says, "The
[13:59] word found her." I love that. Don't you?
[14:02] In the beginning was the word, and the
[14:04] word was with God, and the word became
[14:07] flesh, and the word flesh found her. And
[14:11] when the word found her, he was sharper
[14:15] and quicker than any two-edged sword,
[14:17] and discerning of the thought and the
[14:20] intent of the heart. He pierced past the
[14:23] darkness of prostitution. He pierced
[14:25] past the darkness of her of her
[14:28] religious upbringing. Come on, church.
[14:30] Amen. Religion had left her in a mess.
[14:33] The Pharisees had left her in a mess.
[14:36] And she was as done with religion as I'm
[14:39] done with religion. I don't know about
[14:41] you, all but I don't want religion. I
[14:43] want Jesus. I want the power of the Holy
[14:46] Ghost to come down in the church with
[14:49] revival and reality. Do you see what it
[14:52] was? The word found her. And when the
[14:54] word found her, look at the condition
[14:56] she was in. But it's sharp and powerful
[14:58] and it's piercing and it's dividing of
[15:02] the spirit in the soul. Her spirit was a
[15:04] prostitute. That was the spirit. But the
[15:06] gene seed that was on the inside of her
[15:08] belong to God. Brother Ram says it like
[15:11] that. She was one of those thoughts of
[15:13] God that was manifested.
[15:18] She was one of those thoughts of God.
[15:20] Somebody say it. Thoughts of God.
[15:21] Thoughts of God. She was one of those
[15:23] thoughts of God that was manifested. And
[15:25] brother Ba in later in identification he
[15:27] said and there were others and there
[15:30] were others that had them thoughts in
[15:32] God's mind. He said like Peter and
[15:35] Nathaniel and all of those that was in
[15:38] God's thinking but as soon as that light
[15:40] flashed they recognized it. Hallelujah.
[15:43] You know what he said? You know what
[15:44] brother Ram went on to say? He said you
[15:46] didn't have to go down and get them and
[15:48] bring them up to an altar. You didn't
[15:49] have to go and drag them to the things
[15:51] of God. He said because there was a seed
[15:54] in them and a moment the light went over
[15:56] them, they was ready to follow the word
[15:58] of God. And I believe this morning
[16:00] there's something on the inside of a
[16:02] believer. Amen. You don't have to pump
[16:04] them up and make them do it. You don't
[16:06] have to talk them into it. Amen. Just
[16:08] let the Holy Spirit start going over
[16:11] that seed and something on the inside
[16:13] will break out of them and they begin to
[16:16] follow God. You see it? She was an
[16:18] actual type of the bride. Amen. She was
[16:21] a type of the bride. She was a woman, a
[16:23] harlot, and she had a seed, and the
[16:25] Messiah sign came to her. Took 2,000
[16:28] years for that type to mature.
[16:31] And brother Random uses this more than
[16:33] any other thing that he does concerning
[16:36] his ministry over and over and over and
[16:37] over and over and over again because
[16:39] watch, he's
[16:41] reflecting somebody from the scripture.
[16:45] And brother Bam never stood there and
[16:46] said, "Now I'm going to do what Paul
[16:48] did." He didn't do that. But he said,
[16:51] "Has this been done since Jesus was on
[16:54] the earth?" And after 2,000 years, the
[16:57] Messiah sign was done. And there was a
[16:59] woman. So if there was a Messa sign, we
[17:01] know where that fits. That was Brother
[17:03] Brandham. But where does the woman fit?
[17:07] Somebody's life right here this morning
[17:10] reflects the character of that woman
[17:12] that said amen to that word and it
[17:15] quickened the seed that was on the
[17:17] inside of her.
[17:18] That's right. It was. Now, Brother Bam
[17:20] says it like that. That's why in the
[17:22] rapture, Brother Bam could come along
[17:24] and say she's justified. Now, she never
[17:26] done it in the first place.
[17:30] Now, there should be a whole sermon
[17:31] preached on in the first place, but I
[17:34] but to save time, I'll just say this.
[17:36] The first place was in God. But before
[17:40] he was God, because God's an object of
[17:44] worship, right? But Elohim is a
[17:47] self-existent one. And that's where you
[17:50] were. You were in Elohim before there
[17:53] was any physical manifestation. You were
[17:56] a part of his thinking of this end time
[18:00] and you were in him then. That's why
[18:02] brother Bam said, "See then the bride is
[18:04] justified." Now, now there's a big
[18:05] difference in justified and forgiven.
[18:08] Big difference. Brother Bam said,
[18:09] "Forgiven means you did it and then I
[18:11] forgave you for it." He said, "But
[18:13] justified means that you never did it."
[18:17] Actually never did it. In other words,
[18:18] if I came to you and I said to you,
[18:20] "Hey, I forgive you for being out last
[18:22] night drinking, driving around in the
[18:23] car, and you said, "But brother Wayne, I
[18:25] wasn't out last night drinking, driving
[18:27] in the car." Amen. Now, I can't forgive
[18:29] you because, Amen, you didn't do it,
[18:32] then you're just not you're justified.
[18:33] In other words, you never did it in the
[18:35] first place. Now, the word justified
[18:38] means just. And I I it's a play on
[18:40] words, but just if I'd
[18:43] never
[18:45] done it. Just if I'd never done it. So
[18:50] justified takes a new meaning. It's not
[18:53] justified for you. It's just if I never
[18:57] did it. Amen. And that justification,
[18:59] Brother Bam says, she never done it in
[19:01] the first place. say here's the word
[19:02] prophet and he's looking at you but he's
[19:05] not looking at you here he's looking at
[19:08] the inner man and he's identifying the
[19:11] inner man came from eternity the gene
[19:14] seed on the inside of you he is saying
[19:16] it never did it to begin with the real
[19:20] start is the soul the soul didn't start
[19:23] in your body it began in God and it's
[19:26] come and deposited in a body but you
[19:29] were a seed to begin with When you were
[19:32] a little bitty baby coming from this
[19:34] earth into the earth, God had a seed in
[19:36] you already. Come on, church. Don't tell
[19:39] me that you had the power to go into a
[19:42] bar when you was born. You had the power
[19:44] to tell a lie. Amen. To cheat, to commit
[19:47] adultery. In this first birth,
[19:49] everything when you were born in the
[19:51] earth, everything that would ever cause
[19:53] you to sin was in you right then.
[19:56] Then you got to believe like you got to
[19:58] believe that the Bible says that there
[20:00] was a seed in you also as a son or
[20:03] daughter of a God that when you came up
[20:05] to an altar, you were born with a power
[20:08] to do that. And no matter how many years
[20:10] you spent in the world, that seed was
[20:13] there when God put you on this earth.
[20:15] And this word has come to redeem that
[20:18] which God had already had in his earth.
[20:21] Amen. Now it's the first place.
[20:23] Therefore, being marred, he said, "But
[20:26] now be being married to the virtuous son
[20:28] of God, never sinned, she was for
[20:30] ordained." Now, usually I put this in
[20:33] the end of my notes and I never get to
[20:34] it. So, I'm going to start with it this
[20:40] morning. It's in the end of 14 different
[20:42] notes I've had throughout this Ephesians
[20:44] series, and I never get to it.
[20:47] We're just going to start with it. If we
[20:48] run out of time, glory to
[20:51] God. She was for ordained. See, she was
[20:54] trapped
[20:55] and now she heard the truth and came
[20:59] forth. The blood cleansed her. What
[21:01] happened? She heard the truth. She heard
[21:04] the real truth. Amen. She heard the
[21:07] truth for the first time in her life.
[21:09] And it took the word to identify her as
[21:12] a thought of God. Nothing else can do
[21:15] it, folks. Nobody else can identify you.
[21:19] But this message has identified this
[21:21] bride not as a Pentecostal, not as a
[21:24] Lutheran, not as a Baptist, but as the
[21:27] bride, the literal out reign part of
[21:31] Almighty God. She never sinned in the
[21:33] first place. I love it. Things that are
[21:35] to be. Brother Bam said the word of God
[21:36] bleeding to wash the bride. She stands
[21:39] perfect,
[21:41] virgin,
[21:42] unadulterated. She never sinned in the
[21:45] first place. She was trapped into it.
[21:47] Now, when I'm reading this, I'm not
[21:49] talking about your human body.
[21:51] There's two of you. And I'm talking
[21:54] about that germ that come from God that
[21:56] has taken over this human body. And this
[21:59] human body is saying you're human, but
[22:02] the other part is saying you're deity.
[22:04] And we have focused so long on the human
[22:07] part that the deity part has been
[22:09] suppressed and oppressed. Amen. And it
[22:12] never gets its way. Well, I think it's
[22:14] time to turn loose of the deity part and
[22:17] you tell this human part, I'm taking
[22:19] over this body.
[22:22] Hallelujah. Now, I I believe that it's
[22:25] high time that the word of God is bled
[22:27] that it might release you. You You say,
[22:30] "Well, somebody, Brother Brandon said,
[22:32] here it is. You was trapped into it." Do
[22:35] you want to deal with the human side?
[22:36] You were trapped.
[22:38] You were trapped into it. Now, let's go
[22:40] in the visible union. The bride's
[22:41] powerful sermon. Brother Bam said,
[22:42] "You're standing completely justified.
[22:44] You never sinned at the first place. God
[22:48] don't even know nothing."
[22:51] Yeah. You're sitting there trying to
[22:53] discuss this with God and God don't know
[22:56] what you're talking about.
[23:01] That's the truth.
[23:04] Amen. God don't know what you're talking
[23:06] about. Brother Brandon said, "God don't
[23:08] even know nothing. It's in the sea of
[23:10] forgetfulness.
[23:12] Now, y'all know, Brother Bram uh told
[23:14] about it. Uh brother, brother Tim Prit
[23:16] and I talked it over one time. The lady
[23:18] actually was in his church, came through
[23:19] a prayer line down in Louisiana. She was
[23:21] a smoker. Came through the prayer line
[23:23] and brother Bam was telling, "Confess
[23:25] your sins before you get here." And
[23:27] there was some people come in front of
[23:28] her. And Brother Bam called him out
[23:29] smoking and said, "You need to repent of
[23:31] that smoking then God will heal you."
[23:33] And this girl sitting back here grazed a
[23:35] Methodist. She got scared. She said,
[23:37] "Well, I didn't know it was that big a
[23:38] deal." But she got she got under
[23:40] conviction and she didn't want her mama
[23:42] knowing. She didn't want the whole
[23:44] church knowing. So, she got to
[23:46] repentance. And when she got in front of
[23:48] Brother Bram, he never called her out.
[23:50] Now, that happened, I think, a couple
[23:52] different times. And somebody asked
[23:54] Brother Brandham about it. And brother
[23:56] Bram simply said, "Look, that if God
[23:58] don't see it, how could it profit?"
[24:02] See, when it's put under the blood, that
[24:04] is God's created way to destroy sin.
[24:08] Otherwise, you would have to live with
[24:10] the accumulation of your sin your whole
[24:13] life. That's an Old Testament law. The
[24:17] the blood of the Old Testament pushed it
[24:19] and pushed it and pushed it and pushed
[24:20] it and it accumulated. But that day on
[24:23] Calvary, there was a sacrifice made.
[24:26] That one drop of the blood of Jesus
[24:28] Christ eradicated every sin that was
[24:32] ever committed from Adam all the way to
[24:34] the end of the world. Not just the not
[24:37] just sin that was, Amen, but sin that
[24:40] was going to happen. God's blood is so
[24:42] powerful. He has already destroyed sin
[24:44] you ain't even committed yet. He's
[24:46] already destroyed sicknesses that ain't
[24:48] even come up in your body yet. Because
[24:51] by his stripes, you are healed. By the
[24:54] blood, you are saved. Do you see the
[24:57] power of that blood this morning? Amen.
[24:59] Now, I know it's in the sea of
[25:00] forgetfulness. Now, here's the thing.
[25:02] You never did it. That's a prophet. Now,
[25:05] you were accused of it by the accuser,
[25:09] but really,
[25:11] I love how he says that. Get real. Yeah,
[25:16] but really
[25:18] now you're accused of it. Get real, man.
[25:22] Are you hearing the prophet? You're
[25:24] accused of it. But really, from the
[25:28] beginning, you were predestinated to be
[25:30] a son and daughter of God. And you're
[25:33] standing here washed and your old book
[25:35] of divorcement is put away. And it's
[25:37] dead and absolutely out of existence
[25:41] in the mind of God. Hallelujah. Well,
[25:44] glory be to God. He said, you're accused
[25:46] of it, but really
[25:49] you're really a predestinated son to
[25:51] begin with.
[25:53] Now, here, brother B say it like this.
[25:55] You were deceived into it by your first
[25:56] marriage. And it's no fault of your own.
[26:01] But by your natural birth, you come
[26:03] after Eve who committed adultery. And
[26:05] that's the reason you was born an
[26:07] adulteress.
[26:09] You were a sinner to begin with. That's
[26:11] right. You was deceived into it, but it
[26:13] ain't your
[26:14] fault. You never did it because that
[26:19] little germ that was in
[26:22] you was to be you before the foundation
[26:26] of the world. Now, if if we could we
[26:29] don't have time to get in deep in
[26:30] doctrine this morning in this area, but
[26:32] y'all know if you if Adam hadn't failed,
[26:34] you would have been spoken word children
[26:36] in the in the garden, right? There would
[26:38] have never been no sin in the first
[26:40] place. Because you were in that the real
[26:43] you was in that lamb's book of life that
[26:46] would have come out in that garden under
[26:48] the manifested word. You would have been
[26:50] a part of that word that would have come
[26:52] out in perfection. Amen. But because of
[26:55] the failure of Eve, you came into the
[26:57] earth in a perverted birth with
[26:59] spiritual amnesia. Amen. And therefore,
[27:01] brother Ram is saying it's not your own
[27:03] fault. You were born here, but really
[27:06] there's a germ that was in you was to be
[27:08] you. the real you
[27:11] before the foundation of the world. Now
[27:14] Jesus himself and the redeemer. Brother
[27:16] Ram said, "What did he redeem?" He
[27:17] redeemed your soul from hell. That's
[27:20] what he is. He's a redeemer of the soul.
[27:23] Jesus is a redeemer. He redeems by
[27:25] process. 1964 future home. Brother
[27:27] Bandham tears apart the idea there's two
[27:29] souls. Of course, some people don't read
[27:33] all the message. They read one part of
[27:34] it and they run off with something and
[27:36] then they cause a lot of confusion.
[27:38] Usually it's excuse for sin. Usually
[27:41] usually uh the mis the mishandling of
[27:43] the word is done to make a hole that
[27:45] some man wants to fulfill some
[27:47] perversion just to be honest. Amen. And
[27:51] they then therefore by doing this amen
[27:54] they they they uh make two different
[27:56] souls. Now, now if you want to
[27:58] understand the redemption of the soul
[28:01] and understand how there's an old soul
[28:02] and a new soul, you've got to go to
[28:04] future home and you look at the earth
[28:07] itself. And brother Bam said, "Watch,
[28:09] there's three different earths. There's
[28:12] an old world, there's a present world,
[28:14] and there's a world to come, but it's
[28:16] all the same earth." And the soul is
[28:20] just one soul, but it's now a redeemed
[28:24] soul. And that redeemed so is through a
[28:27] process that God came down through
[28:29] justification, sanctification, baptism
[28:32] of the Holy Ghost and redeemed you. Now
[28:34] that redemption of you is the real you.
[28:38] Is that right? To show you. Now, Brother
[28:41] Brown, the message identification is
[28:42] powerful. Paragraph 77, he said to show
[28:45] you it's the ones that he thought of his
[28:48] thoughts is the Christian of today.
[28:53] How many Christians I got in here today?
[28:56] His thought is the Christian today. Do
[29:00] you see? You were actually his thoughts
[29:03] before the world began.
[29:06] See, man was born in sin, shaped in
[29:08] iniquity, come to the earth speaking
[29:10] lies, and there is nothing in him at
[29:12] all. See, but if he was God's thought
[29:15] when he come to the world, he's God's
[29:18] thought to the beginning to display an
[29:20] attribute. Do you follow me? Then Jesus
[29:23] came to break the clouds back so that an
[29:26] attribute could display itself. He is
[29:30] God's expressed word. Nothing else could
[29:33] be manifesting. Other characters had
[29:36] already fallen. See, Jesus came to
[29:39] redeem. Now, now, uh, this is very, uh,
[29:43] I would need to really slow down to get
[29:45] this area, but y'all's quick, so I'll
[29:46] just say it fast. But Jesus was a
[29:49] redeemer,
[29:51] right? He was a redeemer. But Job said,
[29:54] "My redeemer lives."
[29:58] So the life is the redeemer.
[30:02] See, now there's no life in the Bible
[30:05] that could redeem fallen man. See, every
[30:08] thought that fell from heaven would have
[30:10] had to go
[30:11] unfulfilled except that the life of God
[30:15] could get into the thought and then
[30:18] resurrect the thought. Now, that life
[30:20] had no way to get to man unless it come
[30:23] through Calvary and was released as a
[30:25] spirit upon man. So, the so the Holy
[30:28] Spirit redeems the fallen thought of God
[30:32] and makes you a Christian today. So,
[30:34] there it is. Brother Bam says, "See,
[30:36] anything is to bring it back. It's God's
[30:38] thought." See that that thing, that
[30:40] little you, that little me. No one the
[30:43] world could take our place. See, it was
[30:45] God's thought. Now Jesus says this in
[30:47] John 17 and5. He said, "Father, glorify
[30:50] me with the glory I have before the
[30:52] world was." The glory before the world
[30:55] was. Brother Ram said, "Then Jesus was
[30:57] the only man that had pre-incarnate
[31:00] knowledge."
[31:01] It's odd to me that William Brandham
[31:03] then comes along and he starts talking
[31:06] about in the beginning God and then he
[31:07] said now before that.
[31:10] So whatever knowledge it was that wrote
[31:12] the Bible and had existence before the
[31:16] Bible has spoke to us in this generation
[31:19] through an Elijah prophet to make known
[31:23] and identify what it was even before and
[31:27] what it was in the Bible and what it is
[31:29] now. Do you see what he's doing? He's
[31:32] showing you an identification in God.
[31:35] He's identifying you in the Bible. And
[31:37] now he's identifying you today. What's
[31:40] he doing? He's bringing a perfect faith
[31:42] that we were chosen in God before the
[31:45] foundations of the world. Brother
[31:47] Brandon brings us this in in questions
[31:49] and answers in 1953. And he said, "The
[31:52] first man he made was in his image."
[31:54] Returning back to the image to our first
[31:56] created image. When God created me,
[31:58] William Brandham, I was before the
[32:00] foundation of the world. He made my
[32:02] being, my spirit. I wasn't conscious as
[32:04] far as I know of. He says, "But I don't
[32:07] believe you're getting it." But Jesus
[32:09] told the disciples that he knew them
[32:11] before the foundation of the world. And
[32:14] Paul said that he chose us before the
[32:16] foundation of the world. Therefore, some
[32:18] part of me, Arman Neville, all of the
[32:21] rest of you here that is in Christ was
[32:24] there before the world began. Yeah. And
[32:27] this is my analysis of this. I think the
[32:30] people today are possessed with the
[32:33] spirit or the spirit, a part of the
[32:36] angelic spirits which rotated off of God
[32:40] and never fell in the beginning and
[32:42] resisted the lie of the devil in heaven.
[32:46] Then when that great theophony be to
[32:49] spin in heaven, brother Bam said off of
[32:51] that rotated spirits and he said those
[32:54] spirits have anointed people in this
[32:56] generation that they wouldn't believe
[32:58] the lie of the devil in this. That's why
[33:00] the Bible could say that in the end time
[33:03] there will be false Christ. You won't
[33:06] deceive the elected
[33:08] [Applause]
[33:09] because somebody's character will
[33:12] reflect that scripture because they were
[33:15] there in the beginning. They were there
[33:17] when Jesus prophesied and now they're
[33:20] sitting right here this morning. This is
[33:22] not just an abstract bride. You're not
[33:24] just a bride of his imagination. This
[33:27] bride is a reality of the fulfillment of
[33:30] the thought of almighty God. Listen,
[33:33] this is a real bride. She's a true
[33:35] bride. There's been churches and
[33:37] churches and brides and brides, but
[33:39] there's got to come one that is the
[33:42] fulfillment of the vision. We're not
[33:44] here just to talk about it. You are
[33:46] that.
[33:48] Hallelujah. What is it? Now, Brother
[33:50] Bram has some powerful things to say.
[33:52] You would think he was educated in the
[33:54] idea. He said when his program was laid
[33:56] out, the whole thing, you were
[33:58] recognized in the program because you
[34:01] got eternal life. Now, that word eternal
[34:04] means it never did begin and neither can
[34:06] it end. How many's got eternal life?
[34:09] Now, come on, raise it up high. Let's
[34:11] get some faith. That life never began.
[34:15] Now, I know you think it started on
[34:16] someday. That's not true. That life
[34:19] never began because it's eternal.
[34:22] Neither can it end. That's why we don't
[34:24] believe in pre-existence of souls.
[34:26] You're not pre-existent. You're eternal.
[34:29] You're you're you're a part of God. Do
[34:31] you see? and you you you're a part of
[34:33] his attribute. Now, when brother Bam
[34:35] says this, he says, "See, it came in.
[34:38] You're an attribute of God's
[34:40] thinking before the world was ever
[34:43] created." Now, that's the only way you
[34:46] can have eternal life. And that life he
[34:50] was thinking of you is in you now.
[34:58] Amen. That
[35:00] life that was before the world, that was
[35:03] thinking of you is in you now.
[35:08] My goodness.
[35:12] That that life
[35:16] that was thinking of you
[35:19] is in you now. See, there's no way to
[35:23] separate that. What is it? Brother Ram
[35:26] said, "Is
[35:27] Elohim materializing?"
[35:31] It's just Elohim materializing.
[35:34] What is it? That life has already come
[35:37] into the church. Brother Brandham says
[35:39] it like this. He said, "A real believer,
[35:41] no matter what they are, they're
[35:43] thoroughly satisfied. They're thoroughly
[35:45] convinced because the life that is in
[35:47] them has already become Christ."
[35:52] The life that is in you has already
[35:55] become Christ. Now if you take that
[35:57] quote and Amen it comes and go wait
[35:59] Jesus. Amen. Let me ask you where's he
[36:01] at today?
[36:03] You want to talk about the bride coming
[36:05] of Christ. Amen. Open up your eyes
[36:07] folks. Has she been so long with you
[36:09] that you have not known who she was?
[36:12] Listen. Jesus was with Peter and he was
[36:15] on a wood boat and brother Bam said it
[36:17] was made of common wood and the creator
[36:20] of the wood slept in the boat and he was
[36:22] asleep. He said but here we are. He said
[36:25] made of Texas mud and Indiana mud and
[36:27] Ohio mud and the same one that was in
[36:30] that boat is in this boat. It's the same
[36:34] life. Hallelujah. The same life and the
[36:37] life that is in you has become Christ.
[36:40] Amen. That's why you can look at her and
[36:42] say she is him
[36:45] because it's the same life. Now here's
[36:48] the thing. There has never come a
[36:50] message that could reflect the exact
[36:53] character of Jesus to identify himself
[36:56] on the earth. Now now um brother Brandon
[37:00] will say it very clearly in adoption. He
[37:01] said you're actually never able to have
[37:02] the right kind of faith until
[37:05] positionally you know right? Do you see
[37:08] faith is not just a a quickening, it's a
[37:12] positioning, right? Because look, let's
[37:15] get real, okay? You you when you get
[37:18] married, let's just put it that way.
[37:19] When you get married and you're living
[37:20] with one another and you got the
[37:22] marriage certificate and you had the
[37:23] wedding video and you got rings and you
[37:26] share a home together, does that mean
[37:29] every day is going to be the best day?
[37:33] But your position,
[37:36] you got to know that that's your
[37:37] position.
[37:39] And the bride is married in this age.
[37:43] It's the marriage of the lamb. That's
[37:44] your position.
[37:47] And you know, really, you have a you
[37:49] have a checkbook. This is checkbook
[37:50] time.
[37:52] You see what it is? Now, you'll never
[37:53] really have the right kind of faith
[37:56] until positionally you know that. Now,
[37:59] here's the here's the thought. As
[38:01] brother B will say this, it's pretty
[38:03] amazing how he does say it. He says,
[38:05] "Down there in Kentucky." And he said,
[38:06] "We lived in a a log house." He said,
[38:08] "On clapboard shingles and things." And
[38:10] he said, "There was a mirror at our
[38:12] home." He said, "But it was just a
[38:14] mirror piece of it tacked up on a tree
[38:17] and there was a little wash bench out
[38:19] there and it was a pitcher pump." And he
[38:21] said, "Dad would pump it, wash his
[38:22] hands, and look in the mirror." And he
[38:23] said, "I seen mama stand out there and
[38:25] try to comb her hair because there was
[38:27] no mirror in the house." Now, now how
[38:30] many ever uh when you was a kid, how
[38:32] many ever found a little piece of
[38:33] mirror? You just found a little piece of
[38:34] it,
[38:36] you know, and you tack it up on a tree
[38:37] or you put it up on a little piece and
[38:40] you know, you have a hard time
[38:42] reflecting more than just a portion,
[38:44] right? Yeah. You know, and usually
[38:47] usually they're foggy or dirty or half
[38:50] broke and you know, you know, and it
[38:52] don't do a real good job of reflecting
[38:55] the whole image.
[38:57] And brother Ram said that that there was
[38:58] a little boy. He said he was raised in a
[39:01] home much like ours. And one day he went
[39:04] down to his grandma's. Y'all y'all
[39:06] remember the story? And and they were a
[39:08] little better off down there and they
[39:10] went down to the town and he said
[39:12] upstairs there they had a a mirror that
[39:15] was on the back side of the door. And he
[39:18] said he stood there and the little lab
[39:19] was lonesome. He's looking around and he
[39:21] said he happened to look at that door
[39:23] that had been closed. He said, "But then
[39:26] somebody must have opened it and he saw
[39:29] the back of that door and he saw a
[39:30] mirror on it." Now, now this prophet is
[39:32] not just telling a story, folks.
[39:35] He's telling you that up to the opening
[39:38] of the word, there's just been a little
[39:42] mirror tacked on the wall that we could
[39:45] get glimpses of what that real bride
[39:47] looks like. But when that door opens up,
[39:51] there is a Has anybody ever seen one of
[39:54] them fulllength mirrors? We got one of
[39:56] them in our bedroom. I I skipped past
[39:58] that
[40:01] thing. But it reflects the full image to
[40:04] you. You can literally there's there's
[40:06] mirrors that can tell you what you look
[40:08] like. There's mirrors that can tell you
[40:11] exactly who you are, exactly what you're
[40:14] looking like. And the message of the
[40:16] hour is not a partial look at the bride.
[40:19] It's not just a little piece or a little
[40:21] glimpse or a little part, but it's a
[40:24] real face to face complete view of what
[40:28] she looks like from the body of the feet
[40:31] all the way to the head. I'll tell you
[40:33] this, the prophet of God said that great
[40:35] mirror this morning is his word. And we
[40:38] ought to be able to identify ourselves,
[40:40] he says, with something we're going to
[40:42] speak about. Now, we were talking about
[40:44] in the Bible study on Friday. It was it
[40:46] was I used it kind of as a as a humor,
[40:48] but but it's really true. Amen. Most of
[40:50] you's got mirrors in your house and and
[40:52] you know, they're they're usually
[40:54] personal. They're forever. You know, you
[40:55] usually got a mirror for you, you know,
[40:58] and we were laughing about it. I was
[41:00] talking about brother Seth and I know
[41:02] he's a nicel looking guy but I said Seth
[41:04] when did you ever get up in the morning
[41:06] and go look in the mirror and just look
[41:10] for a minute and go there stands a
[41:16] Messiah. Can you Can you just see him
[41:18] stand in the mirror
[41:21] looking? Mariah, come here.
[41:25] You got to see this guy. That's a
[41:28] Messiah standing looking right here.
[41:30] Brother Isaiah, you surely ain't never
[41:32] done
[41:35] that. But see, the reason he don't do
[41:38] that is because in that mirror is a
[41:41] human, a human man looking and he sees
[41:44] all the imperfections and he sees all
[41:46] the troubles of the years. He sees all
[41:48] the problems and they're all collected
[41:50] in the image that he's looking at. It
[41:52] identifies all the years and the
[41:54] struggles and the problems and the
[41:55] issues and it's all looking back at him
[41:58] right there in that mirror. Amen. But
[42:00] there's another mirror.
[42:02] Come on, church. There's another mirror
[42:04] called the word of God. And there's
[42:06] something about it when you start
[42:08] looking in this one that you'll holler
[42:10] for somebody to come here and see what
[42:12] the prophet said about me. Come here.
[42:14] Look. Here's the Messiah right here.
[42:17] Here it is. I was in him before the
[42:19] foundation of the world. Chrisa, come
[42:21] and look.
[42:25] It's a Messiah.
[42:27] Do you see church of the living God?
[42:29] Amen. There is a reflection out of the
[42:31] mirror this morning of the real you.
[42:33] That mirror at home is not the real you.
[42:36] It's just bearing what's on the inside.
[42:38] But on the inside of you is royalty. You
[42:41] are looking at the queen of heaven. You
[42:44] are looking at God's attributes. You are
[42:46] looking at the reason and the purpose of
[42:49] his being. Everything that God is is in
[42:52] this church. Everything, every bit of
[42:54] his reputation. All that was in God
[42:58] was poured into his son. And all that
[43:00] was in Christ has been poured into this
[43:03] bride. Now, I know we've sat here this
[43:05] morning. We look at the Bible. And but
[43:07] for the first time, we can see ourselves
[43:09] across the pages of the Bible. We're not
[43:12] just a one scripture church. We're not
[43:14] just a one one little creed or one
[43:16] little doctrine or one little piece. We
[43:19] we have not taken one little area of the
[43:21] message and seed it down and said this
[43:23] is all there is to it brother. It's an
[43:26] open book. It's a whole book. And the
[43:28] Bible said to eat the whole lamb and
[43:30] don't eat it soden with water and don't
[43:32] water the thing down but put some fire
[43:35] under it and roast it and make it tasty.
[43:39] I believe it this morning. Do you see
[43:41] what it is? Amen. That that when the
[43:44] when the Bible starts opening up,
[43:45] Brother B said it become a new book.
[43:47] Right. Right? It become a new mirror.
[43:50] Let's just put it that way. And brother
[43:52] Brandon says it like this. He said,
[43:54] "See, every parable in the Bible and
[43:56] every type in the Bible is made manifest
[43:59] right before us. The same God in the
[44:01] pillar of fire that wrote it, he came
[44:04] and make it manifest." Now watch him in
[44:05] Christ revealed in his own word and
[44:07] evening lights has come on and every
[44:10] parable everywhere we go nature Bible he
[44:15] said whatever it was Daniel kings of
[44:17] those days everybody every form every
[44:19] move every place positionally shows the
[44:22] hour we're living in this entire Bible
[44:26] speaks of this moment in Christ the
[44:28] mystery of God revealed brother Brandon
[44:30] said he had a goal in his mind and he
[44:33] said it's put in every type that's in
[44:35] the Bible. The seventh seal when it
[44:37] opened up, we found out it was in every
[44:40] type that was in scripture because the
[44:42] seventh seal is Christ. It is life and
[44:45] it's coming to the church. Do you see
[44:47] the third pull is not something for
[44:49] somebody else. It's not just something
[44:52] for brother Brandham. The third pull, we
[44:54] are a part of that by predestination.
[44:57] That is our part of that word. Life is
[45:00] coming in. So when you start reading the
[45:02] Bible, do you see what the message does?
[45:04] It redeems your life and it lets you
[45:07] look in the scripture when that life was
[45:10] represented as David. When that same
[45:13] life that's in you was represented in
[45:15] scripture, you can see yourself as David
[45:17] one morning. You know, you you fight
[45:19] your Goliath, but but that's not your
[45:21] only type. That's only a portion of your
[45:24] character. But you can see another
[45:26] character in Shanggar when you pick up
[45:28] your oxod and you go to weapon and you
[45:31] can see another portion of your
[45:32] character when you see Samson pick up
[45:34] the jawbone or when you see Gideon
[45:37] coming under the inspiration and
[45:39] destroying his enemy. You can see other
[45:42] parts of your body other than just that
[45:45] one part. Come on Tamar, can't you see
[45:47] yourself when you were in desperation?
[45:50] That part of you is a life that was
[45:52] causing Tamar to do what she done. And
[45:55] you don't know it, but that was in God's
[45:58] mind. When Tamar was preserving the
[46:00] seedline of Judah, she was becoming a
[46:04] part of the coming of the Lord. Look,
[46:07] that life was descending to earth,
[46:09] wasn't it? And it was coming right
[46:11] through Judah's line. So Tamar had to do
[46:14] her part. Come on, Rahab. You had to do
[46:17] your part. And I can show you in the
[46:19] Bible who you are in the Bible. I can
[46:21] show you Rahab. And I can show you the
[46:23] part she played. And it only mirrors the
[46:26] life that you live. And here you can
[46:29] identify yourself with it. What was it?
[46:31] They was a part of the descension.
[46:34] He descended through 42 generations.
[46:38] That's right. Go read them. It's 41
[46:40] actually. But the 42nd generation was
[46:42] yet to come. In Isaiah 53, from the
[46:45] cross he cried, "And who shall declare
[46:46] his generation? There shall be forth a
[46:48] seed, and a generation shall be counted
[46:50] as the seed." And who is that seed this
[46:53] morning? But the royal seed of Abraham
[46:56] who then can look back in scripture and
[46:59] show their identification in every type
[47:02] that's in the Bible. You are Sarah and
[47:04] your Abraham. You're David, Amen, and
[47:07] your Samson. See, you see, every one of
[47:09] those types are reflecting because it
[47:11] was a life that was in them that caused
[47:14] them to do what they were doing. Amen. I
[47:17] tell you, there was a time when Paul was
[47:18] here and Paul said in first Corinthians,
[47:21] he said, "We look in a mirror dimly, but
[47:23] one day face to face. One day, we're
[47:25] going to know as we are known." That's
[47:28] the life that knew us is going to be
[47:30] revealed. And when this thing begins to
[47:32] open, we begin to see him face to face.
[47:35] and we are changed into the same image.
[47:40] So something has been molding you
[47:42] throughout your life. Some some life has
[47:45] molded the character of your human life.
[47:48] But this life that comes from Christ
[47:51] will mold you into the character of
[47:53] Christ. See, there's a real you. There's
[47:55] a real church. Somebody said, "Which is
[47:58] the real church?" I'll tell you what a
[47:59] prophet said. He said, "Even Satan knows
[48:02] that God is immutable in his ways. And
[48:04] even Satan can assuredly know the church
[48:06] at Pentecost with the power of God is
[48:09] Mark 16 in action. And the true church
[48:12] that Jesus claims as his own. Mark 16 in
[48:16] action is the true church Jesus claims
[48:19] as his
[48:20] own. Now Christ in this true church will
[48:23] be a continuation of the book of Acts.
[48:27] Christ in this true church will be a
[48:29] continuation of the book of Acts. And in
[48:31] this bride greater works will be done.
[48:34] Yeah. This bride will be greater works
[48:36] will be earned. And listen, here is
[48:38] where the weakest Christian can stand.
[48:41] This is where I take my stand. That
[48:44] revelation is the greatest prevailing
[48:47] power that is known to man. Revelation
[48:50] is a prevailing power. And brother
[48:52] Brandham says it is the thing that gives
[48:54] you authority over the devil.
[48:57] Revelation is what causes you to
[48:59] understand who you are. It identifies
[49:02] you. But that revelation cannot come
[49:05] from just a school like a teacher
[49:07] putting two scriptures together. Brother
[49:09] Random said it'll take supernatural
[49:11] instruction for the church to understand
[49:14] who they are by scripture. There's
[49:16] nobody can take you through this Bible
[49:18] and show you yourself except the life
[49:21] that wrote the Bible gets inside of you
[49:25] and then you can see the mirror and
[49:27] understand my life is his life and is
[49:30] I'm just as much a part of that word as
[49:32] he is a part of that word. There is
[49:35] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[49:37] power of revelation. Brother Bam said
[49:39] one of these days now I I know I don't
[49:42] know about you all but rapture is my
[49:44] goal.
[49:46] Rapture is my goal. So the revelation I
[49:49] really desire is the one that raptures
[49:52] you.
[49:54] That's the one that really goes. And a
[49:56] lot of people has that out in the
[49:57] distance. But brother Bam didn't put it
[50:00] in the distance. In the rapture book, he
[50:02] said, look, he said she's waiting for
[50:04] that revelation. And a couple of verses
[50:06] later, a couple of pages later, he
[50:08] begins to say that 1 Thessalonians 4 is
[50:11] a revelation of a three-fold purpose of
[50:13] God. And the shout is a message. The
[50:16] voice is when the bride begins to
[50:17] believe it. And the trumpet is the
[50:19] changing of the body. The revelation of
[50:21] the rapture is it comes in a progression
[50:24] of three-fold. And it begins with the
[50:27] word.
[50:29] And when the word takes preeminence in
[50:31] your life, it molds the character of
[50:34] Jesus Christ. That's why brother
[50:35] Brandham said the new birth is a
[50:37] revelation.
[50:39] Glory to God. It's a revelation. And it
[50:42] gives you authority that God has
[50:44] revealed to you this great mystery.
[50:46] That's your new birth. Amen. Oh, if the
[50:49] church only knew its position.
[50:52] It will one day. And the rapture is
[50:55] going to go when it knows what it is.
[50:58] Hallelujah. You say, "Preacher, I want a
[51:00] rapture revelation." Your position in
[51:03] Christ is the revelation of the rapture
[51:05] in this last day. We are not just a
[51:08] Leodysian church. We have been
[51:10] positioned in 1 Thessalonians 4. There
[51:14] has been a change from a death cycle to
[51:17] a rapture cycle. And the church is on
[51:19] their way to a change of the body. Do
[51:22] you see what it is? What happened? What
[51:24] happened to Adam and Eve? Disbelieve the
[51:26] word and they fail. But God has sent a
[51:29] message to speak another word. And it's
[51:32] a word of incorruptibility that will
[51:35] resurrect the church and will change
[51:37] them in the moment in the twinkle of an
[51:39] eye if the church only knew its
[51:41] position.
[51:43] And let me ask you this. How are you
[51:45] going to identify yourself in this word
[51:47] without this life?
[51:50] The life that was in him from the
[51:52] beginning. That's why I took so much
[51:54] time to tell you the life in you is the
[51:58] thought he had then. And that thought
[52:00] has been reflected through every
[52:02] scripture that's ever been written. You
[52:05] can go to every type and find Christ.
[52:08] So, brother Bram said Jesus was the
[52:10] fulfillment of the Old Testament. But
[52:12] this bride is a fulfillment of the New
[52:14] Testament. You have the interpretation
[52:17] of that word. You see what it is? It's
[52:19] not identified us in a morg. It didn't
[52:22] identify us as a dead church. It
[52:25] identified us as the living
[52:27] manifestation of the word of the living
[52:29] God. Come on, church. This bride will
[52:32] not fail. She can't fail because she's
[52:35] the word to begin with.
[52:39] My goodness, when you think of it.
[52:43] Now, true
[52:45] identification. We know that Jesus was
[52:48] the Messiah. We know he was the son of
[52:50] God. We know he was the bridegroom. He
[52:53] was God's tabernacle. God said so. He
[52:57] said so at the River Jordan and he said
[53:00] so on Mount Transfiguration, but where
[53:03] it really spoke was in a tomb on a
[53:06] Sunday morning. But where it really
[53:09] spoke was in a tomb on a Sunday morning.
[53:11] And brother Bram said there his cold
[53:13] body laid dead in that tomb.
[53:16] It laid there dead in that tomb. But it
[53:19] wasn't to that life came back in that
[53:21] body that it was identified as God. You
[53:25] see, it wasn't the death that identified
[53:27] him as the resurrected one. It wasn't
[53:30] the death that identified him as Isaiah,
[53:33] but it was the resurrection that
[53:35] identified him. And when the life come
[53:37] into the body, that was God saying,
[53:39] "This is my body."
[53:42] And then that body was reflected
[53:43] throughout the scriptures down through
[53:45] the ages. Do you see? Then the life.
[53:47] Brother Bam said his body was not held
[53:49] in the grave. It was resurre recognized
[53:51] with him in resurrection the same as he
[53:54] is now. Listen. Which means this the
[53:57] word which he is has beun to realize.
[54:02] The word went from Luther and Wesley and
[54:04] began to raise in power and begin to
[54:07] move and then it moved a little more.
[54:09] But now it's coming up to
[54:12] identification.
[54:13] Woo. Glory. It's coming up to
[54:16] identification. Do you see what he's
[54:18] saying? When the bride knows who she is,
[54:21] that's when the rapture is going to go.
[54:23] When you get your position, when you
[54:25] know who you are by the word, that's
[54:28] when the rapture will go. And brother
[54:30] Bam says it's coming up time now to
[54:33] identification. See, watch. To the life
[54:37] in the
[54:38] body. True identification is the life in
[54:42] the body. That's what it is. As brother
[54:44] Ram says it like that, the life in the
[54:46] body is a vindication. The rapture is at
[54:49] hand.
[54:50] There's nothing else to happen. See,
[54:52] just the harvest.
[54:54] That's just the harvest then. See, see,
[54:56] watch what's watch what's watch Jesus uh
[54:58] watch God quit his creation. What what
[55:00] in the Garden of Eden? Why did he quit
[55:01] creating? He quit creating because he
[55:03] reached perfection,
[55:06] right? Why does the farmer harvest the
[55:09] field? Because the seed has reached back
[55:12] to seed again.
[55:14] Life has moved to its fullness to
[55:17] identify what the plan is. And why would
[55:20] God continue the church age when life is
[55:24] now coming up to identification that
[55:27] this is the bride that was in his mind
[55:30] before the world began? And who could
[55:32] tell you that unless it was the life
[55:34] that thought of you, that came to you.
[55:37] Come on, church. This message is more
[55:39] than just a bunch of teaching. It is the
[55:42] return of the pillar of fire which you
[55:45] were a part of to begin with has come
[55:48] here to redeem you and identify you and
[55:51] say this is my people. I can't call you
[55:54] church no more. I'm going to have to
[55:56] call you bride. And when the bride
[55:58] recognizes mama that's me,
[56:01] then she's going to go. You do you you
[56:04] you see the correlation when she starts
[56:06] recognizing and seeing. I know some of
[56:08] this is real elementary to you, but you
[56:09] forgive me for my elementary thoughts,
[56:11] but I'll say this. But up there in those
[56:14] stars, you were recognized in that
[56:16] pyramid. You were recognized in this
[56:18] scripture. You're recognized in the
[56:20] message. You're recognized. You just
[56:22] have to recognize that's you. Somebody's
[56:25] in the pyramid. Somebody's in the stars.
[56:28] Somebody's in the pillar of fire. Mama,
[56:30] that's me that's in there. I know
[56:33] they've talked about it. Amen. But there
[56:35] is a real you.
[56:38] There's a real you. And it's reflected
[56:40] in the scripture. Now you say,
[56:43] "Preacher, why in the world is it so
[56:45] important to see me?" Because if you
[56:47] know who you are, you know what belongs
[56:48] to you.
[56:51] Watch Abraham walking out in the out out
[56:53] in the promised land. And when he meets
[56:55] Melazdc out there, he's just separated
[56:58] from Lot and his brethren. And he gets
[57:00] out there and he's not got anything over
[57:02] him. And the Lord looks at him and says,
[57:05] "Hey, look to the north and you look to
[57:08] the south and you look to the east, you
[57:11] look to the west and everything you see
[57:14] belongs to
[57:15] you." and the church of the living God.
[57:17] If you get all of the unbelief beat off
[57:20] of you and you get all of the
[57:23] traditional ideas beat off of you,
[57:26] everywhere you look in the Bible, you
[57:28] can say, "That's me. That's me, mama.
[57:31] That's me. That belongs to me. Joy
[57:33] belongs to me. Peace belongs to me. The
[57:35] Holy Ghost belongs to me. Life belongs
[57:38] to me." You see, but I just heard
[57:40] Brother Bam on tape this morning. He's
[57:42] discerning person after person. He said,
[57:44] "That ought to beat the dross of
[57:45] unbelief off of you." I said, "It did,
[57:47] Brother Random. I believe you. It beat
[57:49] the dross of unbelief off of my eyes."
[57:52] And I I'm not just reading a couple
[57:54] pages. I'm seeing eternal thoughts
[57:57] manifested in the age where we're living
[57:59] in. Every promise in this book is ours.
[58:02] No man come unto the father except by
[58:05] me.
[58:06] See, you got to come through that life
[58:08] to be recognized as a part. In John
[58:11] 6:44, Jesus tells the truth. That's why
[58:14] Brother Bam says he would get on
[58:15] election and he get on it real
[58:18] strong. Well, I guess I picked up his
[58:23] habit. Election and election real
[58:28] strong. Now, there might be brothers
[58:32] that feel more qualified to beat the
[58:34] church into
[58:35] position, but that ain't me.
[58:40] I read where the prophet of God said
[58:42] that Israel was put in their nation by
[58:45] persecution,
[58:47] but the church would be put in its
[58:48] position by the power of God.
[58:51] So I say open up the channels
[58:54] and let the power of God come until we
[58:57] find our position in that word. Brother,
[58:59] you don't have to. Brother Ma said it in
[59:01] the spring of the year. You never seen
[59:03] angels with with uh uh with ladders up
[59:06] and down the road on the on the oak
[59:07] trees.
[59:08] You never seen a bunch of angels. God
[59:10] ain't got a ain't got a lift pick a leaf
[59:12] picking uh policy that comes in the
[59:14] spring of the year to get the old last
[59:16] year's leaves off. But Ram said they
[59:18] nobody has to do that. He said they may
[59:21] hang on there all winter, but when the
[59:22] new life starts coming, he said when the
[59:25] new life starts coming, it just pushes
[59:27] off the old and it brings on the new.
[59:30] Brother, let the new life get in that
[59:32] inner man and it'll push off the old
[59:34] habits. It'll push off the old ideas.
[59:37] It'll push them off. We don't have to
[59:39] compromise. We don't have to beat
[59:42] somebody into form. Just get life in
[59:44] them and watch the life begin to bring
[59:47] changes. That's right. Amen. Because
[59:49] these people were ordained to believe.
[59:52] There are three classes of people. And I
[59:54] really believe these are genuine
[59:55] believers. I say that because somebody
[59:58] who had their names written in the
[1:00:00] Lamb's book of life was before the
[1:00:01] foundation of the world. I happen to
[1:00:03] believe I was on that book.
[1:00:06] You say, "How do you know you're on that
[1:00:08] book?" Well, how'd Peter know it?
[1:00:11] How did Peter know to reflect his self
[1:00:14] in that book? How did he get from from a
[1:00:17] ignorant fisherman to recognizing he was
[1:00:20] in that book? Brother Bram said, "I'll
[1:00:21] tell you how he did it." He said, "When
[1:00:23] that messiah sign strike over that
[1:00:24] seed," he said he knew his name was in
[1:00:27] the book because the light struck the
[1:00:28] seed. That's exactly what happened that
[1:00:31] woman to whale. That's exactly what
[1:00:33] happened to people throughout the
[1:00:34] nation. And that's exactly what happened
[1:00:36] to me.
[1:00:38] Do you see what it is? You identify
[1:00:41] yourself as having your name in that
[1:00:43] lamb's book. Brother Bam said God never
[1:00:46] came. Knoweth it not. He said he never
[1:00:48] came to redeem the devil's children.
[1:00:51] He came to redeem his own. That's what
[1:00:54] it was. He come to redeem his own. His
[1:00:56] own children. Now, as sure as there's a
[1:00:58] natural seed, there's a spiritual gene
[1:01:00] seed. And in that gene seed, brother
[1:01:03] Bram said that gene is in us and we were
[1:01:05] sons and daughters of God to begin with.
[1:01:08] When God called you, he had already for
[1:01:11] ordained you. For when God called,
[1:01:14] Romans 8:29 and 30, to the to them that
[1:01:16] he called, he's already justified.
[1:01:20] And them that he justified, he's already
[1:01:24] glorified. I love how Brother Brown
[1:01:26] reads it and says, "Let the devil have
[1:01:27] all the temper tantrum he wants to have.
[1:01:30] They're already glorified.
[1:01:33] Not in this body.
[1:01:36] But in the presence of God,
[1:01:39] now I know some people maybe don't agree
[1:01:41] with this, but I'm preaching and I know
[1:01:44] brother Ray believes it and I believe
[1:01:45] it, so we're going to preach it anyhow.
[1:01:48] But you know in Matthew 18 chapter that
[1:01:50] Jesus said that all children die goes to
[1:01:52] heaven.
[1:01:54] And he said the reason being is their
[1:01:56] angels behold the father's face. And
[1:01:58] when he picked that up, Brother Brandham
[1:02:00] was asked about that question. And
[1:02:02] brother Brandham said, "That's the
[1:02:03] offenes.
[1:02:05] That's your angelic body."
[1:02:08] Amen. Not that you're an angel. We're
[1:02:10] talking about celestial. And he said
[1:02:12] that body is in the presence of the
[1:02:14] father. No wonder he could say you're
[1:02:17] already glorified. Somebody said, "Well,
[1:02:19] you don't even have a theophony."
[1:02:21] Really? Brother Ram said, "When you
[1:02:22] recognize this message is eagle food,
[1:02:25] you heard from it." That's right. Well,
[1:02:27] I don't know about you, but I heard from
[1:02:29] my theophony
[1:02:31] and my I didn't just hear it. I heard a
[1:02:33] call from it. And that call come right
[1:02:36] out of this message. That that that was
[1:02:38] the very thing that Brother Brandham
[1:02:40] said was that was that theophony
[1:02:42] standing there. That's why he could
[1:02:44] therefore say they're already glorified.
[1:02:48] Now, Brother Brandham actually seeing
[1:02:51] those bodies within 20 ft of his
[1:02:53] bedroom. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how
[1:02:57] long this building is, but it's a lot
[1:02:59] longer than any 20 ft.
[1:03:02] So, I'd say a person sitting in the
[1:03:03] middle of this building strikes a very
[1:03:06] good chance of being within the reach of
[1:03:09] the theophades that's beyond the curtain
[1:03:10] of time.
[1:03:12] Come on, church. It's not a million
[1:03:14] miles away. It's just in a dimension
[1:03:18] that's a little faster than this one.
[1:03:20] And the prophet of God is telling us,
[1:03:22] one of these days, we're going to speed
[1:03:24] up.
[1:03:25] Oh, that's why this anointing that came
[1:03:28] not an ox anointing. It's not landbound
[1:03:30] and slow. It's an eagle anointing. And
[1:03:33] they catch the revelation. Amen. It's a
[1:03:36] quickening in the end time. It's a
[1:03:38] spirit of God that comes upon the
[1:03:39] church. It's the real you. Now, now I'm
[1:03:43] going to say this. Amen. Uh uh a
[1:03:45] revival. Uh brother Seth Button, where
[1:03:47] have you brother? That's a that's a good
[1:03:48] quote you sent me this week. Amen. On
[1:03:51] revival. I think you come out of
[1:03:52] recognizing your presence. Topeka. If
[1:03:55] you hadn't heard the Topeka series, go
[1:03:56] listen to the Topeka series. It's
[1:03:58] amazing. Son of Man's all through there.
[1:04:00] But in that, Brother Brham describes
[1:04:02] what a real revival is. Now, what a real
[1:04:05] one is. And he said, really, he says
[1:04:08] what a real reviving is, a real revival
[1:04:11] is not an adding.
[1:04:14] It's not an adding. He said what that is
[1:04:17] is it's a cleaning up of what you got.
[1:04:20] It's a it's a it's a refreshing of what
[1:04:22] you got. Now, I I know the church is
[1:04:24] growing, and I appreciate the Lord for
[1:04:26] letting it grow, but I don't want just
[1:04:27] see the church grow. I want to see
[1:04:29] predestinated seed.
[1:04:32] That's why we're not backing off of the
[1:04:34] message. We're not going to We're not
[1:04:35] going to water the message down to
[1:04:37] incorporate all the world. Come on,
[1:04:40] church. We're going to preach the
[1:04:41] message and bring the genuine seed and
[1:04:44] feed the word of God. This is the
[1:04:46] theophony calling back. We're not
[1:04:49] interested in building the biggest
[1:04:51] church. We're interested in preaching
[1:04:53] the message of the hour to the elected.
[1:04:56] We're going to leave here one of these
[1:04:59] mornings. Are you reading the news?
[1:05:01] Israel's in a great mess. It may be in
[1:05:04] the morning. This bride may be finding
[1:05:08] her position this morning. The last one
[1:05:11] might be sitting here hearing me preach
[1:05:13] this morning. Then why could I preach a
[1:05:15] Baptist sermon? Or why could I preach a
[1:05:17] Lutheran sermon worried about somebody's
[1:05:19] feelings getting hurt? Brother, you
[1:05:21] can't hurt the bride's feelings with
[1:05:22] this
[1:05:24] message. You can't hurt the bride's
[1:05:26] feelings with this message. They're not
[1:05:29] scared of the name William Brandham.
[1:05:30] They're not scared of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:33] They're not scared of shouting and
[1:05:35] rejoicing and praising because they were
[1:05:38] there when the Bible said Job shouted.
[1:05:42] [Applause]
[1:05:46] Somebody's shouting right here this
[1:05:47] morning. Somebody said, "Well, that's
[1:05:48] just too far." are. But here's the
[1:05:49] problem is, Brother Bam said, "Last
[1:05:51] one's going to come in somewhere.
[1:05:54] It might not be a churchwide revival. It
[1:05:56] might not be a world revival. It may be
[1:05:58] one person.
[1:06:00] One person." When God went to Lazarus in
[1:06:03] the tomb, it was one man coming out,
[1:06:06] which represents this bride's revival.
[1:06:08] It may be one person at a time. It may
[1:06:11] be in one person and not another, but he
[1:06:14] called Lazarus by name. And so has this
[1:06:18] message called you by
[1:06:21] name brother. What was it when that
[1:06:24] revival began? It was a hearing of the
[1:06:26] name. Brother Bam said this book holds
[1:06:28] the mystery and the unfolding of it. Now
[1:06:31] the mystery of this book is calling
[1:06:33] names. The opening of the word, the
[1:06:37] opening of the door put a mirror before
[1:06:40] the church. Told you who you was. Called
[1:06:42] your name. Said come on to your rewards.
[1:06:44] What is it? Amen. the same one that woke
[1:06:48] up Gerus's daughter with not a general
[1:06:50] resurrection, but he said, "The woman
[1:06:52] sleepeth. She don't she didn't die. She
[1:06:54] sleeps." And brother Bam said, "What was
[1:06:56] it?" Her name was on the lamb's book.
[1:06:58] And there might have been many maidens
[1:07:00] that morning that had went to sleep or
[1:07:02] died. He said, "But not that one." And
[1:07:06] when he went down to the house, he
[1:07:08] proved, Brother said, he proved his word
[1:07:10] was right. when he spoke her name and
[1:07:12] she come alive. He said but he proved
[1:07:14] something else too. He said he also
[1:07:17] proved that he was all knowing. He had
[1:07:19] fornowledge and he knew her name before
[1:07:23] he called her. And God knew your you see
[1:07:26] this message has fornowledge. It knew
[1:07:28] about you before you got here.
[1:07:32] You don't think brother Ram was just
[1:07:34] preaching to the people in the 60s, do
[1:07:35] you?
[1:07:38] Amen. He was calling it an infant bride
[1:07:40] church in the 60s.
[1:07:43] You see what it is? He proved he was God
[1:07:45] and he proved what he knew was there.
[1:07:47] Now it looks dark for revival and I
[1:07:50] understand there's a lot of darkness in
[1:07:51] the world we're living in and it looks
[1:07:52] dark. But it's no darker than it was the
[1:07:55] night that the disciples were on the
[1:07:57] sea. And brother Bram said a devil got
[1:08:00] on every wave and said, "I'll sink this
[1:08:01] ship." The problem with that ship is
[1:08:04] Jesus wasn't on it.
[1:08:07] Oh, but brother Bram said, oh, he said,
[1:08:09] there it is. But when all the hope was
[1:08:11] gone for
[1:08:12] revival, they saw him walking on that
[1:08:14] sea.
[1:08:16] They saw him walking on that sea. How
[1:08:18] many knows what that actually
[1:08:20] represents? Now, when brother Bram says
[1:08:22] it, brother, Brother Bam says one place.
[1:08:25] He says, "Brother Bam, are you saying
[1:08:26] the spirit of God will be on the
[1:08:28] church?" And brother B said, "Yes." He
[1:08:31] said, "That's exactly what the book of
[1:08:33] Isaiah says. the government shall be on
[1:08:36] their shoulders. And then he goes over
[1:08:39] to the book of Daniel, the 12th chapter,
[1:08:41] and he opens it. And Daniel said he's
[1:08:43] seen times and times in a half a time.
[1:08:45] And then the book would be opened. And
[1:08:47] he said there was a man in the water
[1:08:50] standing there with a wide on. And
[1:08:53] brother Bram said, "There it was. It was
[1:08:54] the Holy Ghost on the water." He said,
[1:08:57] "What did the water represent in
[1:08:59] Revelation 17? It was the people." Yeah.
[1:09:01] So when you see the Holy Ghost on the
[1:09:04] people, it will be a sign of the end
[1:09:06] time. When Jesus come walking on the
[1:09:09] water, brother Bram said it
[1:09:12] represented the resurrection ministry of
[1:09:15] Christ would come to the people on the
[1:09:18] water. In other words, it would come
[1:09:20] through the people. And the people when
[1:09:23] they when they when they when they were
[1:09:24] without
[1:09:25] hope when it was dark when they were
[1:09:28] only worried about survival he said here
[1:09:30] he come walking and if that hasn't
[1:09:34] happened again
[1:09:38] and if that hasn't happened again he
[1:09:41] said but the people are afraid of it.
[1:09:44] Now watch the only hope to survive and
[1:09:47] the people are afraid of it.
[1:09:49] the only way to get into the revival
[1:09:52] that people are afraid of. And the
[1:09:55] prophet of God goes on to say this. He
[1:09:57] says, "See, but here he says what it
[1:09:59] is." He said, "When when that little boy
[1:10:00] died back there in the scripture and he
[1:10:02] said the the woman sent after Elijah, he
[1:10:05] g she gave a she gave a stick to her
[1:10:06] servant said go get go run or Elijah did
[1:10:09] actually told his servant said go run
[1:10:11] laid the stick on the boy and he said
[1:10:13] don't you stop for nothing." And brother
[1:10:15] Ram said that's the same way with our
[1:10:17] commission. That's the way miracles are
[1:10:20] done is that we go without stopping for
[1:10:24] soup suppers. You bunkle games, worldly
[1:10:27] events. And then he says what you have
[1:10:29] to do is you got to lay aside all of
[1:10:31] those things of the world. He said we're
[1:10:34] stopping too much. He says and then
[1:10:36] we're cuz watch what listen what he's
[1:10:38] doing. He's laying out what's stopping
[1:10:40] the church. She's saying, "You've been
[1:10:42] commissioned to go do this, but you you
[1:10:44] stop for games. You stop for card
[1:10:47] parties. You stop for denominations."
[1:10:49] And then he stops and throws it in here.
[1:10:51] He says, "And then we're stopping
[1:10:53] because if we're afraid, we're going to
[1:10:54] get too fanatical."
[1:10:58] Isn't that something? Brother Bam throws
[1:11:01] being afraid of the moving of the spirit
[1:11:03] right in with bunko games and card
[1:11:04] parties.
[1:11:06] We're afraid we're going to get too
[1:11:07] fanatical. And brother Bam said, "I'm
[1:11:09] more scared of the person that's afraid
[1:11:11] of it than I am the person that's the
[1:11:13] fanatic."
[1:11:16] I'm more afraid of the person that's
[1:11:18] afraid of the Holy Ghost than I am the
[1:11:20] Holy Ghost getting out of line. Now,
[1:11:22] somebody said, "Well, Brother Wayne, hey
[1:11:23] man, I've just been in some meetings and
[1:11:25] they just get so rough." Well, I'll tell
[1:11:27] you what, brother Ram says. He said,
[1:11:28] "Somebody said today, I've seen
[1:11:30] Pentecostals kick the seats over in the
[1:11:32] floor." Yeah. And break up the
[1:11:34] furniture. Yeah. And he said, "Had they
[1:11:38] got anything?" And brother Bam said,
[1:11:41] "Oh, yeah." He says, "They had the Holy
[1:11:43] Ghost." He said, "Yes, sir." He says,
[1:11:46] "Well, we Baptist have it, too." He
[1:11:48] said, "If you did, you got it after you
[1:11:51] believed. When you believed, they
[1:11:53] believed. You get it when you believed."
[1:11:54] But Acts 19 says, "Have you received it
[1:11:56] since you believed?" And he said, 'I can
[1:11:59] stand a little wildfire and a kicking
[1:12:02] over the furniture before I could set it
[1:12:04] in an old church so cold the spiritual
[1:12:06] thermometer goes below zero. Brother Bam
[1:12:09] said, "I'd rather you kick the pews
[1:12:10] over." That's turn the heat off.
[1:12:14] Amen. Now, now what's he talking about?
[1:12:17] See, Brother Bam says, "But what's
[1:12:18] really happening is people's only
[1:12:21] painting a fire to the church." He said,
[1:12:23] "That's what these Baptists are doing."
[1:12:25] Thank God we're not Baptist this
[1:12:26] morning. He said, "That's what the
[1:12:28] Baptist is doing." Amen. He says,
[1:12:30] "There," He says, "what good does a
[1:12:32] freezing man do with a beautiful picture
[1:12:36] as a great fire, but it burnt 2,000
[1:12:38] years ago?"
[1:12:40] How you going to warn by that? It'd be
[1:12:43] like me coming up here and putting a big
[1:12:46] old backdrop of a nice pretty fire with
[1:12:49] a bunch of people. And you can even put
[1:12:51] the twel apostles around the fire
[1:12:53] warming their hands. But how you going
[1:12:55] to get warm by that?
[1:12:57] That's 2,000 years ago. Now, church,
[1:13:00] these meetings that Brother Brandham had
[1:13:02] were 50s and 60s, and some of you heard
[1:13:05] about the revivals of the 80s, and
[1:13:07] you've heard about the '90s. This is
[1:13:09] 2024.
[1:13:11] How you going to re how you going to
[1:13:13] warm this new generation by the fires
[1:13:16] that happened 50 years ago? We can tell
[1:13:18] them how God came and how God did and
[1:13:21] what God did. But I say what we ought to
[1:13:23] do is we ought to build a fire just like
[1:13:27] the one that saved me and just like the
[1:13:30] one that saved
[1:13:32] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't
[1:13:35] want to paint no fire. I want to build
[1:13:37] one. I want to build a fire that's so
[1:13:40] hot it'll burn out every disease. It'll
[1:13:42] burn out every sin. It'll burn out every
[1:13:45] formalism. I say build a fire and throw
[1:13:49] some gasoline on it while you're busy
[1:13:51] and let the Holy Ghost flames begin to
[1:13:54] burn across the church of the living
[1:13:56] God. I tell you what, brother Bam says
[1:13:58] it like this. He says, "See, we don't
[1:14:00] need this in the millennium.
[1:14:04] We're not going to need this in the
[1:14:05] millennium. We need it right now. We
[1:14:07] don't need a miracle in the millennium.
[1:14:09] We'll have a glorified body in the
[1:14:11] millennium. We don't need a praise
[1:14:13] service in the millennium. We need it
[1:14:15] right now. We need these old bodies that
[1:14:18] are arguing with the inner man. These
[1:14:20] old clumps of clay that are formal and
[1:14:23] they're tired and they're weary and
[1:14:25] they're upset. We need them to get under
[1:14:28] the submission of the inner man until
[1:14:30] they begin to worship God and the fear
[1:14:33] leaves and the trouble leaves. That the
[1:14:36] power of God can sweep through the
[1:14:38] church like never before. I say every
[1:14:41] generation has a chance. I say every
[1:14:43] young person ought to know what it's
[1:14:45] like.
[1:14:47] Brother Dallas, I don't believe we ought
[1:14:48] to have to take our kids to no dance
[1:14:50] before they can dance. I don't believe
[1:14:52] our children ought to have to learn how
[1:14:54] to dance under rock and roll parties
[1:14:56] down at the bar. I think they ought to
[1:14:58] be a Holy Ghost moving in the church
[1:15:00] where the victory songs can be sang
[1:15:02] where we can clap our hands and move
[1:15:04] under the spirit of God and not feel bad
[1:15:07] about it tomorrow.
[1:15:10] Well, somebody help me this morning. I
[1:15:12] don't believe we're ought to have to
[1:15:14] feel bad tomorrow because we worship God
[1:15:16] today.
[1:15:20] I'm I I'm serious. I don't believe that
[1:15:23] these young people ought to have to
[1:15:24] drink whiskey to experience being drunk.
[1:15:27] I know what a prophet said. He said, "We
[1:15:30] ought to get so drunk that we forget our
[1:15:33] names." Brother, that's pretty drunk. We
[1:15:36] ought to get so drunk in the spirit till
[1:15:37] we forget what our name is and remember
[1:15:41] who we really are. Remember we really
[1:15:43] are the children of God. We really are
[1:15:46] the presence of God in the age we're
[1:15:48] living in. My goodness, to think of it
[1:15:51] today, somebody said, "Well, I tell you
[1:15:53] what, brother Wayne, you know, it's just
[1:15:55] that old it's just that old wildfire."
[1:15:57] Well, brother said, "I'd rather have a
[1:15:58] fire. It's popping and you have to throw
[1:16:00] coals back in it is not have one at
[1:16:02] all. If you're cold and this is a cold
[1:16:06] age, this is a dark time and the only
[1:16:09] hope is to get the life in you that's in
[1:16:12] that fire and that fire created you. It
[1:16:15] can identify you.
[1:16:17] It's a painted fire. Brother man said,
[1:16:20] he said, "Now, what good would it do to
[1:16:22] feed a canary and keep it in a cage?"
[1:16:26] Amen. Let me ask you, what good would it
[1:16:28] do for me to preach the greatest message
[1:16:33] that's ever hit the planet. Astronaut
[1:16:35] fuel that would break every barrier.
[1:16:39] It'll tear down every power. It'll
[1:16:41] destroy every unbelief. It'll put a gust
[1:16:44] of wind under the wings of the church.
[1:16:46] It'll bring inspiration and powers and
[1:16:49] fellowship of truth. Amen. What good is
[1:16:51] it to preach a message like the message
[1:16:53] we have been given? Amen. And not let
[1:16:56] the church enjoy it. Come on, church.
[1:16:58] What good would it do to feed them the
[1:17:00] word and then tell them they can't be
[1:17:03] sons and daughters of God with freedom?
[1:17:05] Well, I tell you what, if they can be
[1:17:06] sons of God in heaven, I think they
[1:17:08] ought to be here. And if they're
[1:17:10] daughters of God in heaven, they ought
[1:17:11] to be here. And if they shouted in
[1:17:13] heaven, they ought to be able to shout
[1:17:14] here. If they had joy in heaven, I say
[1:17:16] have joy in here. And there ain't no
[1:17:19] devil going to take my
[1:17:21] joy. I ain't going to allow it,
[1:17:26] brother. No, sorry. Too late.
[1:17:32] Somebody said, "Well, I can't believe
[1:17:33] our pastor is acting like that." Hey,
[1:17:34] look. If I can't do this and be a
[1:17:36] pastor, I don't need to be a pastor
[1:17:37] then.
[1:17:39] If if David if David as a king could
[1:17:41] dance before the Lord in front of his
[1:17:44] whole country, I believe a pastor ought
[1:17:46] to be able to dance in the spirit and
[1:17:48] say, "God is my creator and God filled
[1:17:51] me with the Holy Ghost." Yes, he did.
[1:17:54] And I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed to
[1:17:56] worship him. I'm not ashamed to give
[1:17:58] voice to him. I'm not ashamed of the
[1:18:01] power of God. I say, "Bring it on." I
[1:18:04] say, young people, bring it on. Bringing
[1:18:06] the fire. Bring the fire of
[1:18:11] God. We're going in a camp meeting. It
[1:18:14] won't be like our Thursday night
[1:18:15] services. It may be a little more fiery
[1:18:18] than normal, but I say that true word
[1:18:20] tabernacle fan the flames of the Holy
[1:18:22] Ghost.
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:30] Brother Wayne, I was in a fanatical
[1:18:31] meeting one time and I tell you
[1:18:33] what, I'm just going to pull back a
[1:18:36] little bit. Okay, you pull back. Brother
[1:18:39] Bram taught us how to do that. He said,
[1:18:41] "Me and my brother working through the
[1:18:43] woods one day and he said, "We found no
[1:18:45] turtle." And he said he pulled his head
[1:18:47] back in his shell, right? He said, "You
[1:18:50] know what?" He said, "I'll get his head
[1:18:51] out of there." And he said he went over
[1:18:53] and got him a switch. And he said he
[1:18:55] beat that shell. He said that head never
[1:18:57] came
[1:18:58] out. He said, "I know how to do it. I'll
[1:19:01] baptize him." He took him over and put
[1:19:03] him in the water and brother
[1:19:05] goes. He floated right to the bottom and
[1:19:07] bubbles started coming up. But he never
[1:19:10] come out. He said, "Oh, but brother,
[1:19:13] when we got him out of that water," he
[1:19:15] said, "I got the trick." He said they
[1:19:17] went over and built him a fire and they
[1:19:19] set that turtle right on top of the
[1:19:21] fire. Brother, that got him moving. And
[1:19:23] I tell you what you do. You build a fire
[1:19:25] hot enough and it'll move you. You get a
[1:19:28] fire burning hot enough and it'll move.
[1:19:30] And I say God has sent us a fire. We
[1:19:33] don't have to start one. We got one. All
[1:19:36] we got to do is enjoy the flames.
[1:19:38] There's people sitting in here got the
[1:19:40] same experience that they got on the day
[1:19:42] of Pentecost. There are people sitting
[1:19:44] here at the same pillar of light that
[1:19:47] came on the day of Pentecost is in them
[1:19:49] right here this morning. I'll tell you
[1:19:51] what, I've been identified. I've been
[1:19:54] identified.
[1:19:57] I've been identified.
[1:19:59] You You said, "Preacher, what are you
[1:20:00] really talking about?" I'm an American.
[1:20:02] Nobody got no problem with that, do you?
[1:20:07] [Applause]
[1:20:09] Europe's history ain't much better,
[1:20:11] brother.
[1:20:12] But brother Bram said if you're an
[1:20:14] American, right, he said you were with
[1:20:15] George Worston when he crossed the
[1:20:18] Delaware.
[1:20:21] You were there when that happened. If if
[1:20:24] you were an American, you were with a
[1:20:26] blank when he when he just decided there
[1:20:29] won't be no more slavery. You were there
[1:20:31] when they rang the liberty bell to break
[1:20:33] and give liberty from Britain and they
[1:20:35] pledged their allegiance and they
[1:20:37] pledged their their their fortunes and
[1:20:39] they decided to be in America. And there
[1:20:42] was America forged and it's had it shame
[1:20:44] and it's had its glory. But if you're an
[1:20:46] American, you identify with all of it.
[1:20:48] And brother Ben said, "If that be true
[1:20:50] about our natural heritage, what about
[1:20:52] the seed that's on the inside of you?
[1:20:55] That if you're a Christian, you were
[1:20:57] there when Job was shouting for joy. If
[1:21:00] you're a Christian, you're there when
[1:21:02] God put Adam in the Garden of Eden. If
[1:21:04] you're a Christian, you've come down the
[1:21:06] Nile and the basket with Moses."
[1:21:09] Amen. If you're a real Christian, amen,
[1:21:11] you stood there at the banks of the Red
[1:21:13] Sea with Miriam when she's played her
[1:21:15] tambourine and she rejoiced. Amen. Come
[1:21:17] on, girls. You know, you know what I'm
[1:21:19] saying? If you're a Christian, you was
[1:21:21] there. You said, "I never danced in the
[1:21:23] spirit." Yeah, you did. You did there on
[1:21:25] the banks of that Jordan or that Red
[1:21:28] Sea. If you're a Christian, you were
[1:21:30] there. You were there when the pillar of
[1:21:32] fire came down and rolled out the
[1:21:33] commandments. You were there. You were
[1:21:35] there when they crossed the Jordan and
[1:21:37] they marched down the walls of Jericho.
[1:21:39] You were there when these things
[1:21:40] happened. You was always in there in
[1:21:43] every type. You was there. But you think
[1:21:45] you were less there when John baptized
[1:21:47] Jesus and a pillar of fire come out of
[1:21:49] the heavens and got into him. You think
[1:21:52] you were less there when he cried from
[1:21:53] the cross? My God. My God. Father forbid
[1:21:57] them. They don't know what they do.
[1:21:58] Brother said you were there. He said you
[1:22:01] were there in him and you paid for your
[1:22:03] sins in him and you paid for your debts
[1:22:06] in him and you died in him. But brother,
[1:22:09] three days later, he come out of the
[1:22:11] tomb and we rose with him on that Easter
[1:22:15] morning. We rose from the dead out of
[1:22:17] that out of that grave. And I was there.
[1:22:20] And I was there when he came out of the
[1:22:21] grave. And I was there when 120.
[1:22:23] Somebody said, "Well, brother Wayne, how
[1:22:25] do you know that you would have been
[1:22:26] there?" Cuz I'm here now.
[1:22:29] I know I'd have been there cuz I'm here.
[1:22:31] Brother Brandon said, "That's the way
[1:22:32] you do it. Look at the character you are
[1:22:34] now, and you'll know what you would have
[1:22:37] been. Woo! I was there. Oh, yeah.
[1:22:42] I don't remember how many thesis Martin
[1:22:44] Luther tacked up. How many was that? I
[1:22:46] say it wrong every time. 90 something.
[1:22:50] Huh? 95. 95 of them. I was there for all
[1:22:54] 95.
[1:22:58] And I was
[1:22:59] there when that man had something on the
[1:23:02] inside of him that says, "I will not bow
[1:23:04] to this system.
[1:23:08] I don't regret what I have said and I
[1:23:10] will not bow to the system that says I
[1:23:12] can't say it. I was there.
[1:23:17] That's right. I was there when when the
[1:23:19] Holy Ghost fell up there. Oh yeah. But
[1:23:21] brother, do you see that's where most
[1:23:23] people quit. Their identification stops
[1:23:26] right there with a partial image of the
[1:23:28] church that the tongues come on the day
[1:23:31] of Pentecost there in Isuza ina 1906
[1:23:33] when the spirit of God begin to fall.
[1:23:35] And that's where a lot of people start
[1:23:36] identifying the world over in the
[1:23:38] charismatic realms. That's as far as God
[1:23:40] went as far as they could concern. But
[1:23:42] brother, in 1933,
[1:23:45] there was a light come down out of that
[1:23:46] Jordan over that Ohio River just like it
[1:23:49] did the Jordan. Amen. And that star that
[1:23:51] come down and brightened our trail. I
[1:23:53] was there. Somebody said, "Well, it
[1:23:54] didn't happen." It did happen. I was
[1:23:57] there when it happened. I was there when
[1:23:59] it happened. I saw it with my own eyes.
[1:24:04] Now, you think I'm crazy, don't you?
[1:24:05] Well, let me tell you, I am not in the
[1:24:08] feet of the church. I looked in the
[1:24:10] mirror. I'm not in the shoulders of this
[1:24:12] church. I'm not even in the mouth of
[1:24:14] this church. I went into the eye of the
[1:24:16] church. And Malachi 4 gave us eyes. And
[1:24:19] we got eyes to see what happened in
[1:24:22] 1933. And I got eyes. I could see what
[1:24:25] happened when God visited that man in
[1:24:28] 1947 in a pillar of fire. It turned into
[1:24:30] a bean just like it did with Joshua. at
[1:24:33] the walls of Jericho. Do you see what it
[1:24:35] is? I I was there. And some people now
[1:24:37] try to say these things didn't happen.
[1:24:42] But I was there.
[1:24:45] Do you see when that when that cloud
[1:24:47] appeared out there on Mount Sunset,
[1:24:49] Brother said, "It's our Lord up there."
[1:24:52] What was it? It was headship. All he
[1:24:54] thought about you and me was being
[1:24:57] revealed in that headship which became
[1:24:59] this message. I was there.
[1:25:03] But brother, I didn't stop in 1963. And
[1:25:05] I didn't stop in the Easter of 1965 when
[1:25:08] they put our prophet in the ground. But
[1:25:10] I was there when these little churches
[1:25:12] started forming all over the country and
[1:25:14] men of God begin to bust and and plane
[1:25:17] out and make trails and it roads for the
[1:25:19] teaching of this word. I was there.
[1:25:21] Amen. 40 years ago when Ray Ericson
[1:25:24] founded this church of True Word
[1:25:25] Tabernacle. I was there. But brother, I
[1:25:28] wasn't just there then. I'm here this
[1:25:31] morning to confess that the same
[1:25:34] God, the same God that done that is
[1:25:38] doing
[1:25:39] this and this generation has a chance at
[1:25:42] the revival.
[1:25:44] How do I know I was there?
[1:25:47] And I'm right here this morning.
[1:25:50] Stand to your feet with me this morning.
[1:25:52] Hallelujah. And I'm right here this
[1:25:54] morning.
[1:25:57] We got a chance at this revival.
[1:26:03] Well, ain't I stand in the prayer line
[1:26:04] with you when God blessed you?
[1:26:08] And I wasn't only there when that
[1:26:10] happened. I've stood in the
[1:26:15] blessing.
[1:26:16] See, if you were there, you're here.
[1:26:23] If you were there, you're here.
[1:26:26] Somebody say, "Well, there ain't no such
[1:26:27] a thing as a theophony. Then why am I
[1:26:29] here?
[1:26:31] Because I was there.
[1:26:34] This man wasn't
[1:26:36] there, but that inner man was there.
[1:26:43] He was
[1:26:49] there. Do you know you were too?
[1:26:55] There was a time I didn't know that.
[1:26:59] But when that great
[1:27:02] light, the one I was a part
[1:27:05] of, came and began to open the
[1:27:08] scriptures, I begin to see myself in
[1:27:10] that
[1:27:11] scripture. That's when I realized I was
[1:27:13] there.
[1:27:16] I can see my
[1:27:17] reactions. Literally, I can see some of
[1:27:20] my own reactions reflected in some of
[1:27:22] those men.
[1:27:24] You know, you you you're sitting there
[1:27:25] shaking your head. You know exactly what
[1:27:26] I'm talking about. You go, "My goodness,
[1:27:28] that's exactly what happened to me."
[1:27:34] Because the same life that's in you was
[1:27:37] right in that then, right? To build you
[1:27:39] a mirror. That way, you're not
[1:27:42] identified by a church.
[1:27:44] You're not identified by a teaching,
[1:27:46] right? You're identified by Christ.
[1:27:50] I am a Christian.
[1:27:54] And in the truest sense of the word,
[1:27:56] Levi
[1:27:58] You are a Christian
[1:28:00] because the spirit of Christ runs
[1:28:03] through us. Do you love him this
[1:28:04] morning?
[1:28:06] Amen. Brother Ben, you got
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:14] something. I
[1:28:17] am
[1:28:20] redeemed. I've been bought
[1:28:23] with Christ.
[1:28:28] Jesus who has changed
[1:28:32] my whole life.
[1:28:39] If
[1:28:41] anybody ask you, oh just
[1:28:46] who I
[1:28:49] am, just tell
[1:28:52] them I
[1:28:55] am
[1:29:00] redeemed. Yes, I
[1:29:04] am redeemed.
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:10] with
[1:29:13] the
[1:29:15] Jesus. Oh, I see
[1:29:19] my life.
[1:29:34] I
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:36] [Music]
[1:29:42] am
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:48] redeemed. I
[1:29:51] am redeemed.
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:30:02] Jesus has changed my whole life.
[1:30:11] Oh, if
[1:30:14] anybody asks
[1:30:17] you just
[1:30:20] who I
[1:30:24] am, tell them I
[1:30:29] am redeemed. Oh, let the redeemed of the
[1:30:32] Lord say so. Oh,
[1:30:35] yes, I
[1:30:37] am redeemed.
[1:30:40] I've been born
[1:30:43] with
[1:30:46] the My
[1:30:49] Jesus has changed my whole life.
[1:31:02] Yes,
[1:31:04] you just
[1:31:06] who I am.
[1:31:15] [Music]
