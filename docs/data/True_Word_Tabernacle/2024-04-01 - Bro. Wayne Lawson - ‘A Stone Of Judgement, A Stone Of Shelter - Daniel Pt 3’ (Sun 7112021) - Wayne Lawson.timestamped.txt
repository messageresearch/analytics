[5:55] turn to the Book of Daniel uh the second
[5:58] chapter we're going to be reading here
[6:00] uh from the 31st verse and again we're
[6:03] going to read down to about
[6:06] verse uh
[6:09] 45 brother Nathan you want to read for
[6:11] us again amen he does a wonderful job
[6:14] doesn't he amen and maybe brother Al
[6:17] maybe brother Steven won't get us for
[6:19] them 30
[6:23] verses 31 to
[6:28] 45 thou oh King sawest and behold a
[6:31] great image this great image whose
[6:34] brightness was excellent stood before
[6:36] thee and the form thereof was terrible
[6:39] this image's head was of fine gold his
[6:41] breast and his arms of silver his belly
[6:44] and his thighs of brass his legs of iron
[6:47] his feet part of iron and part of clay
[6:50] thou sawest till that a stone was cut
[6:52] out without hands which smote the image
[6:54] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[6:57] and break them to pieces then was the
[7:00] iron the clay the brass the silver and
[7:02] the gold broken to pieces together and
[7:05] became like the chaff of the summer
[7:06] threshing floors and the wind carried
[7:08] them away that no place was found for
[7:10] them and the stone that smot the image
[7:13] became a great mountain and filled the
[7:14] whole earth this is the dream and we
[7:17] will tell the interpretation thereof
[7:19] before the king thou oh king art a king
[7:22] of kings for the god of Heaven hath
[7:24] given thee a kingdom power and strength
[7:27] and glory and wheresoever the children
[7:29] of men dwell the beasts of the field and
[7:31] the fowls of the heaven hath he given
[7:33] into thine hand and hath made thee ruler
[7:35] over them all thou art this head of gold
[7:39] and after thee shall arise another
[7:41] kingdom inferior to thee and another
[7:43] third Kingdom of brass which shall bear
[7:45] rule over all the earth and the fourth
[7:47] Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as
[7:50] much as iron breth in pieces and
[7:52] subdueth all things and as iron that
[7:54] breakthe shall it break in pieces and
[7:56] bruise and whereas thou sawest the Fe
[7:59] and Toes part of Potter's clay and part
[8:02] of iron the kingdom shall be divided but
[8:04] there shall be in it of the strength of
[8:06] the iron for as much as thou sawest the
[8:09] iron mixed with myy clay and as the toes
[8:11] of the feet were part of iron and part
[8:14] of clay so the kingdom shall be partly
[8:16] strong and partly broken and whereas
[8:19] thou sawest iron mixed with myy Clay
[8:21] they shall mingle themselves with the
[8:23] seed of men but they shall not cleave
[8:25] one to another even as iron is not mixed
[8:27] with clay and in the day of these Kings
[8:30] shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom
[8:32] which shall never be destroyed and the
[8:34] kingdom shall not be left to other
[8:36] people but it shall break in pieces and
[8:37] consume all these kingdoms and it shall
[8:39] stand forever for as much as thou sawest
[8:43] that the stone was cut out of the
[8:44] mountain without hands and that it break
[8:47] in pieces the iron the brass the clay
[8:50] the silver and the gold the great God
[8:53] hath made known to the king what shall
[8:54] come to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[8:57] certain and the interpretation that
[8:59] thereof sure
[9:02] am amen amen God bless you as you can be
[9:04] seated that's a powerful uh reading of
[9:08] the scripture amen seeing that uh this
[9:11] is setting forth what would be uh the
[9:15] future uh of the times of the Gentiles
[9:18] it was given all the way back in the
[9:21] days of Daniel and and to realize that
[9:23] it is still actually being fulfilled In
[9:26] This Very hour showing the scripture how
[9:28] that it can predict the future so
[9:30] powerfully uh we want to maybe just say
[9:33] as we're we've been in other parts of
[9:35] Daniel so we're we're coming to this
[9:37] image now but the answer of course we
[9:39] just read of how that Daniel has spoke
[9:42] to Nebuchadnezzar concerning the dream
[9:44] that he had and you remember that
[9:46] Nebuchadnezzar actually having this
[9:49] great dream wanted someone to interpret
[9:50] it so he invited all the preachers and
[9:53] he invited all the Evangelist and he
[9:55] invited all the wise men of that age and
[9:58] all of him said the same thing to him if
[10:00] you tell it the dream then we'll tell
[10:03] you the interpretation now this King he
[10:05] outsmarted him by saying to them yeah if
[10:08] I tell you the dream you'll know it and
[10:10] then you can tell me whatever you think
[10:11] it means and then none of us will know
[10:14] what it means uh because it'll be just
[10:16] an interpretation he said but if you
[10:18] could tell me the dream then we would be
[10:20] sure of the interpretation which would
[10:22] raise the faith of Nebuchadnezzar to
[10:25] know exactly what the dream actually
[10:27] meant and then of course then we see
[10:30] that nobody would know what them seals
[10:32] were of course because the seven seal
[10:35] wasn't even given a symbol to it and but
[10:38] God would send a messenger in the earth
[10:40] and then he would tell us what it is and
[10:42] what it means so that we could have a
[10:44] perfect Vindication and have faith in
[10:46] what the answers are so God sends an
[10:48] answer well when this dream Becomes Of
[10:51] course here uh here we're looking at the
[10:53] dream of Nebuchadnezzar the exact image
[10:55] and this image is going to lay over the
[10:57] history of the world uh uh from the time
[11:00] of Nebuchadnezzar all the way to the
[11:02] Rapture of the church so it's going to
[11:05] stand there now uh I don't want to get
[11:07] too much into a into just a bible school
[11:10] or to a Bible lesson but I think it's
[11:12] healthy and and and for believers to
[11:14] read their Bibles and to understand
[11:16] scripturally where they're standing in
[11:18] the ages they're living in other words
[11:20] that some of these things that seem so
[11:21] odd to us uh to become reality they're
[11:24] exactly scripture and it's not something
[11:27] that brother Bram just pulled out of the
[11:28] cloud but rather it's something that God
[11:31] had put in the scripture that the church
[11:33] would be able to identify once that the
[11:35] seals were revealed or the Thunders were
[11:37] opened that the symbols would become
[11:40] manifest now in the Book of Daniel the 2
[11:43] chapter we start looking at the image of
[11:45] Daniel that he saw here and of course we
[11:48] we see the image I think brother Isaac
[11:51] downloaded an image so you can see it
[11:52] with your eyes uh of course what we're
[11:55] seeing is the head of gold and in Daniel
[11:57] chapter 2 the Bible ansed aners this
[11:59] specifically and says the head of gold
[12:02] of course is Nebuchadnezzar the 38th
[12:04] verse of Daniel says uh Thou Art the
[12:06] head of gold so that was the Babylonian
[12:09] Kingdom that was ruling at the time when
[12:12] Daniel was upon the Earth so that was
[12:13] the head of gold but he said then there
[12:15] would come one who was inferior so you
[12:18] going to watch now this image is going
[12:20] to start with a head of gold and end up
[12:22] with feet of brass or excuse me of iron
[12:25] and Clay so there is a devaluing of the
[12:28] material ials that represent these
[12:30] nations but there is a hardening of
[12:33] these now being that this image is going
[12:35] to start with the head and go down to
[12:38] the feet is teaching Us number one the
[12:41] image will never stand because brother B
[12:42] says watch the heaviest part of it is in
[12:45] the beginning so the head he said will
[12:47] never stand on this image so when you
[12:49] read it you're looking at an image that
[12:50] just cannot stand but it's going to
[12:53] start with a head and go downward amen
[12:55] but then God has an image of course in
[12:57] the church he builds a statue and he
[12:59] starts it from the bottom and then he
[13:01] goes to the top so you're looking at an
[13:03] image it won't stand while God has his
[13:06] image that will stand so in these times
[13:09] then you see the Babylonian Empire which
[13:11] is the head of gold now we see a a beast
[13:14] just to the right of it now when you see
[13:16] that it's an oddl looking beast but
[13:18] you'll find if you like to if You' like
[13:20] to read your Bibles uh it's pretty
[13:22] powerful because over in the Book of
[13:23] Daniel in the seventh chapter Daniel
[13:26] sees a vision of the very same thing
[13:29] later that that Nebuchadnezzar saw in
[13:31] the dream but when Daniel sees it he
[13:33] doesn't see it as an image he sees them
[13:35] as a beast so then you can see four
[13:38] beast on the right side of this of this
[13:40] drawing and we're going to give a little
[13:42] uh uh credits to brother Ronnie M Malo I
[13:45] hope how I Malo Ronnie Malo from the
[13:49] Philippines uh because it would have
[13:51] took somebody to draw that last part
[13:53] there that understood the word amen the
[13:56] bomi Empire is the head of gold
[13:58] scripture say says that the Meen
[14:00] Persians Which history will tell you the
[14:01] same was the next Kingdom that moved in
[14:05] after the Babylonians you can read that
[14:07] right in the scripture if you like to
[14:09] it's actually in Daniel 5 and: 28 and
[14:12] the Bible says that the kingdom is
[14:14] divided and given unto the mes and the
[14:16] Persians amen which is also Daniel uh
[14:20] chapter chapter 8 so it's the mes and
[14:22] the persans were given and then the next
[14:25] Kingdom that was following this was
[14:27] going to be the kingdom of the grecians
[14:29] you read about it in your history books
[14:31] called Alexander the Great and this is
[14:34] hundreds of years before Alexander
[14:36] Great's ever been born and here Daniel
[14:38] is telling the king of Babylon the
[14:41] kingdom that will follow the mes and
[14:43] Persians and they will be thigh of brass
[14:46] and of course to the right is the symbol
[14:48] that Daniel saw in the other verses but
[14:50] in the according to scripture Daniel
[14:52] chapter uh Daniel 8: 21 and the rough
[14:56] goat which is the king of Greece and the
[14:59] the horn that is between his eyes is the
[15:00] first king so it was the Alexander the
[15:02] Great or the Greeks it was the king of
[15:04] Greece that was going to follow after
[15:07] him now so then you have the Babylonians
[15:09] the mes and Persians which happened in
[15:10] the time of Daniel then you have the
[15:12] Greeks of Alexander the Great which
[15:14] follows but now the but the next one
[15:17] history will also tell you but in the
[15:19] scripture it'll tell you that the legs
[15:21] of iron and the toes uh uh the feet of
[15:24] of iron and Clay are mixed together as a
[15:27] kingdom in itself and the next Kingdom
[15:29] that was going to rule would be the
[15:31] Roman Empire now the Roman Empire was
[15:33] the Empire that was that was actually
[15:35] ruling during the time of Jesus Christ
[15:37] you can go back in the scriptures and
[15:39] read it uh if you if you'd like to see
[15:41] it in the actual scripture uh you can
[15:43] see in Daniel chapter 11 he said he
[15:46] shall stand up in the estate of the
[15:47] razor of taxes and the glory of the
[15:49] Kingdom but within a few days he shall
[15:51] be destroyed neither in Anger nor in
[15:52] battle and his estate shall stand a vile
[15:54] person uh to whom shall not give honor
[15:57] the kingdom but shall come in peace L
[15:59] and obtain the kingdom by flatteries now
[16:01] if you go back to the scripture in the
[16:03] Book of Luke you'll find out in the time
[16:05] of Jesus the razor of taxes of course
[16:07] was Caesar how that Rome in the time of
[16:10] the birth decided the whole world would
[16:12] be taxed and of course then Daniel saw
[16:14] the taxes coming on the world from The
[16:16] Book of Daniel all the way back here he
[16:19] was seeing the time of Christ when Rome
[16:21] would come in and and would settle now
[16:24] just in just a few verses we're seeing
[16:26] that there was an exact prediction of
[16:28] world world events in history in the
[16:31] time of Daniel showing us that God knew
[16:33] exactly who was going to be ruling he
[16:36] knew exactly at what time they would
[16:38] Rule and he knew exactly who would rule
[16:40] after them showing us then that God is
[16:43] Not on a a nerve medication this morning
[16:46] wondering how things are going to unfold
[16:49] I I want you to be assure to you this
[16:51] morning our God is in control of world
[16:54] governments he's in control of this
[16:57] nation and how it's going to rise and
[16:59] how it's going to fall he can detail the
[17:01] very thing before it ever happens now as
[17:04] a world we got in right now people are
[17:06] scared to death of Communism and they're
[17:08] scared of all the socialism and the
[17:10] Muslims and all these things that are
[17:11] rising up but Len I tell you what you
[17:13] need to fear more than anything a
[17:15] prophet said fear romanism because the
[17:17] Bible predicts Rome will rule from the
[17:20] time after the grecians all the way to
[17:22] the end now the problem is is how to see
[17:25] that Rome is still in control cuz right
[17:27] now today if you ask somebody who's
[17:30] ruling the world uh almost nobody would
[17:31] tell you that Rome is ruling the world
[17:34] but rather Rome is ruling the world
[17:36] right now and it's got more power today
[17:39] than it had when it was ruling as an
[17:42] imperial Rome back in the days of Christ
[17:45] now when you when you read these
[17:46] scriptures here of course Daniel 2 and
[17:49] Daniel 7 are actually telling you the
[17:51] same things and and they're uh and also
[17:53] through Daniel the 8th chapter so
[17:55] there's going to be a lot of repetitive
[17:57] and and maybe more things throughout
[17:59] Daniel that does the same thing it
[18:01] repeats itself and shows but now this
[18:03] last Kingdom when you come to it which
[18:05] would be the Roman Empire you can see
[18:08] that it's divided in two legs the iron
[18:11] now the iron represents Force which Rome
[18:14] used to rule the world throughout
[18:16] hundreds of years to Christ now uh of
[18:19] course uh if you if you like to uh if
[18:22] you like to read the scriptures uh
[18:23] brother Ram explains this very
[18:26] beautifully uh from the pergam age
[18:28] brother said show the exact truth of
[18:30] this matter I do not want anyone to
[18:32] think I'm just giving a revelation of my
[18:33] own but it's found in the scripture and
[18:35] in pergam age he reads Daniel chapter 2
[18:38] 31-45 just like I just did and here in
[18:41] is revealed an exact account of the
[18:43] future unfulfilled history that was
[18:45] prophesied to come upon the Earth from
[18:47] the time of Daniel until Jesus would
[18:49] come and reign as the son of David and
[18:51] it's within four historical divisions
[18:54] which are known by the dominating Empire
[18:56] in each division Babylonian medial
[18:59] Persian Greece and Rome the greatest and
[19:01] most absolute monarchies the Babylonian
[19:03] was typified as the head of gold now the
[19:06] next brother B goes through the the
[19:07] types and then he comes to the to the
[19:09] Roman to the last one here finally came
[19:12] the last Kingdom which is the Roman
[19:14] Empire typified as the legs and the feet
[19:18] but were in the former kingdoms were
[19:20] typified as pure minerals pure gold
[19:22] silver and Brass this last empire was
[19:25] pure iron only in the legs for when it
[19:28] came to the feed it was a mixture of
[19:30] iron and clay and mineral and soil just
[19:33] don't mix and produce
[19:35] constantly excuse me and produce
[19:37] consistency and strength but not only is
[19:40] it so but almost amazing The Last Empire
[19:43] Rome would endure its peculiar mixed
[19:46] state right up until Jesus returns the
[19:49] Roman Empire the iron signifying power
[19:51] and great destructive force and
[19:53] opposition was to be have two main
[19:55] divisions and it certainly was for the
[19:58] empire literally split in two East and
[20:01] West both most very powerful and
[20:03] crushing all that was before them now
[20:06] but as the glory and the power of
[20:08] Empires fell so the Empire began to fall
[20:11] thus Rome Pagan Imperial Rome was no
[20:13] longer iron so she crumbled she was
[20:15] wounded to death and Rome could not rule
[20:18] it was all over Sal thought the world
[20:20] but how Rome the world was for the head
[20:23] Rome which was wounded unto death amen
[20:26] uh we're going to read Revelation 13 and
[20:28] three and the heads appeared to have
[20:30] been mortally wounded and the throat
[20:32] having been slashed and his death stroke
[20:35] was healed the whole earth followed
[20:37] after the wild beast in amazement see
[20:39] people look at Rome like they look at a
[20:41] nation of Italy and as they look they
[20:44] did not realize that Rome with her
[20:45] secret strict confines where the pope
[20:48] has an actual area his domain is
[20:50] literally a nation within Nation she has
[20:53] ambassadors receives ambassadors paple
[20:56] false Christian Rome she is called the
[20:58] eternal City Blasphemous how she
[21:00] controls by religion even more ably than
[21:03] when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled the
[21:05] pure iron of force Rome took on a new
[21:08] lease of life when Constantine joined
[21:10] the church in the state backed it in the
[21:13] Union by force and the spirit that
[21:15] motivated Pagan Rome is the Same Spirit
[21:18] now that motivates false Christian Rome
[21:21] and you can see that is so because you
[21:23] know that the fourth Empire never went
[21:25] out of existence it changed its Tech
[21:29] texture amen from the Nik naan Council
[21:32] swung power of political Rome to a
[21:34] church and it seemed there were no
[21:36] limits which the First Christian Church
[21:37] would go the name Christian was
[21:39] originally brought persecution now
[21:41] became the persecutors it was the age of
[21:44] Augustine hippo set forth the precept of
[21:47] the church ought and must use Force
[21:49] necessary to bring her children back to
[21:51] the fold and it was the harmony with the
[21:53] word of God to kill Heretics and
[21:56] apostles Now isn't it amazing that the
[21:58] scripture is detecting how wonderfully
[22:01] God had predicted what was coming in the
[22:03] future when he showed the two legs of
[22:06] iron and how that how many ever read it
[22:09] in history or studied in your history
[22:11] books that the entire world which which
[22:13] what when we think of the world now
[22:15] we're including the United States and
[22:16] Canada and South America but when when
[22:19] when the scriptures talking about the
[22:20] world it was the history of the world
[22:22] basically was written in Europe and and
[22:24] when you look at Europe look how uh uh
[22:26] Alexander the Great controlled Europe
[22:28] and then how Rome controlled Europe the
[22:31] the the main Nations there and but the
[22:33] scriptures are showing you with history
[22:36] that it was divided in two places how
[22:38] many know Rome actually divided their
[22:41] their Kingdom the Roman Empire had a
[22:43] western and a and a and a Eastern leg so
[22:46] they were divided in two parts but they
[22:48] were they were actually just Iron Wheel
[22:50] and they broke down and they took over
[22:53] and they ruled and they done all of this
[22:55] until a bunch of Barbarian kings started
[22:57] getting involved and the next thing you
[22:59] know they couldn't rule well with just
[23:01] the iron and the clay and it begin and
[23:03] the kingdom begin to diverse and look
[23:05] like they was going to lose the kingdom
[23:08] but then history and scripture reports
[23:11] that when Rome looked like it was going
[23:13] to die Constantine Rises up and brings
[23:16] chrisad doome into the into Rome and
[23:19] then ties together the Roman Empire with
[23:22] the Christian faith and when he ties
[23:24] them together then all of the sudden
[23:27] Rome is now going to go into every
[23:29] nation in the Earth as a religion amen
[23:32] and it's its head is all the way back
[23:34] there in Rome now can you imagine think
[23:36] about this you couldn't you if you if
[23:39] you take national leaders today maybe
[23:42] America can't say anything what happens
[23:44] in France or Russia can't say anything
[23:46] happens in America but the Pope says
[23:48] what happens in all of those countries
[23:50] do you see then he has a he has a
[23:52] rulership in every country in the Earth
[23:55] showing that iron was going to run down
[23:58] in into the toes Amen in those in those
[24:01] teen kingdoms look at this even now amen
[24:04] that what used to be monarchs y'all
[24:05] remember Kings used to be in Europe but
[24:07] all of a sudden we don't have Kings
[24:09] anymore now we got just people who rule
[24:11] there amen and and think about this
[24:13] because the Bible says in Revelation 17
[24:15] he gave them the power of Kings but they
[24:18] wasn't Kings now now now at that time
[24:20] they couldn't understand that cuz
[24:22] everybody was a king but not now they me
[24:24] they have the power of a king but
[24:26] they're not a king and they was given
[24:28] that power Power by Rome but the Bible
[24:29] said they would only hold that power to
[24:31] the scripture is fulfilled and then
[24:33] those 10 Kings will burn that wh amen
[24:36] and her and her cities which is recorded
[24:39] in Revelations the 18th chapter when the
[24:42] Bible says that Rome will be destroyed
[24:43] in the space of one hour now now friends
[24:46] I I think it's pretty powerful that John
[24:48] was writing that 2,000 years ago and
[24:50] there wasn't even thoughts of adom bombs
[24:52] there wasn't no way to destroy a city in
[24:55] the space of one hour but God knew
[24:57] exactly that he would send something in
[24:59] the last day and there would be an
[25:01] increase of knowledge and that knowledge
[25:04] would break into people think about this
[25:06] just a moment somebody like like
[25:08] Einstein could reach into the Unseen
[25:11] World and pull an atom out that you
[25:13] can't even see and could split that atom
[25:16] and bring it into nuclear energy which
[25:18] would make a bomb that could burn a city
[25:21] in the space of one hour which didn't
[25:23] even exist for hundreds of years but
[25:25] right at the end time when the Bible Pro
[25:28] prophesies that Rome will be destroyed
[25:30] God sends a way to destroy it on the
[25:33] earth at the same time now now when you
[25:36] when you start reading these things it's
[25:37] pretty amazing because you're you're
[25:39] you're seeing uh Daniel 2 predict world
[25:43] events now we could talk about the
[25:45] entire statue and we could take a long
[25:47] time and somebody said well why would
[25:49] you even look at any of it well I think
[25:51] it's powerful because the Bible says
[25:53] these things were
[25:54] written for us for an example to bring
[25:57] hope amen Now isn't it amazing that
[25:59] we're looking at the end of the world
[26:01] right now amen but there is hope that
[26:04] comes in this time and you can find that
[26:07] hope right here in the scripture showing
[26:09] that there was a kingdom that followed
[26:11] every kingdom is that right and when you
[26:13] come to the end of one Kingdom there's
[26:15] another kingdom coming in so so the
[26:18] scriptures are showing us that you got
[26:19] four kingdoms and the and the worldly
[26:22] kingdoms are going to end but at the end
[26:24] of those kingdoms there's another
[26:26] kingdom coming amen so seeing the world
[26:29] falling apart but it's just now the time
[26:32] the Christian has been waiting on for
[26:35] 6,000 years the kingdom of God is coming
[26:38] into Power into the Earth in the last
[26:41] day you may be out of place here now
[26:43] amen but in a few years amen there'll be
[26:46] Thrones set up in this world and the
[26:48] Believers will be sitting on that Throne
[26:50] I'm one believer that believes in a
[26:52] millennium I believe that Jesus Christ
[26:54] will rule this world for a thousand
[26:57] years to show that that devil you cursed
[26:59] them in the garden but I brought them
[27:01] back to the same Earth and I've gave
[27:03] them life and they're going to outlive
[27:05] your curse and they'll be a thousand
[27:07] years old oh glory be to God Amen God
[27:11] has an answer for everything the devil
[27:13] could throw at
[27:14] you amen now we're seeing amen that the
[27:18] scriptures is going to set the time now
[27:21] now I think it's powerful that when you
[27:23] can see the exact moment that you're
[27:24] living and you can do it without a
[27:26] Shadow of Doubt so you can prepare
[27:28] yourself for what's coming to you now
[27:30] now if you if you're a Bible student you
[27:33] know Jesus said amen when the Fig Tree
[27:36] put forth her buds no the time is nine
[27:39] brother Ram tells us tell time church he
[27:41] said tell it by Israel right when the
[27:43] Fig Tree put forth your buds now that
[27:45] fig tree put forth her buds in
[27:49] 1947 amen and there was a flag that flew
[27:52] amen over Israel I seen it picture of it
[27:55] in the plane amen begin to fly over
[27:57] brother R said I'm stand in the cave
[27:59] same hour the the angel came to me
[28:01] Israel become a nation the flag flew for
[28:03] the first time somebody said well the
[28:05] flag never flew for a year later but
[28:07] somebody sent me a picture the other day
[28:08] and there's a plane flying over Israel
[28:10] flying the Sixpoint Star of David Amen
[28:12] in
[28:13] 1946 amen what is it God don't miss
[28:16] nothing amen he amen before it was a
[28:18] nation it was a nation in a back room
[28:20] somewhere somebody already drawled it
[28:22] out and said what's about to happen amen
[28:25] man gets caught up later and my we think
[28:28] think we're so smart and got it all
[28:30] figured out but listen we just ain't got
[28:32] there yet when you think a prophet's
[28:34] wrong keep studying you just ain't got
[28:36] there
[28:38] yet it's the truth now now notice
[28:42] because we're at a certain point in time
[28:44] we can tell the time Rome and Israel
[28:47] look what's happening Israel's in this
[28:48] nation and I don't think anybody could
[28:51] argue that it's already speaking its own
[28:54] language got its own government got its
[28:56] own military the scriptures are are are
[28:59] literally living out there and people
[29:02] say well brother Wayne then armageddon's
[29:03] got to be right on us but look there's
[29:05] supposed to be a bride that raptures
[29:07] before the Armageddon so if armageddon's
[29:10] on top of us how close is a Rapture in
[29:12] the church if you think the end of the
[29:15] world is on us then the Rapture has got
[29:18] to be taking place right now
[29:20] it's my when you start seeing the the
[29:23] the very specific time that God said you
[29:26] can see the hand strike the clock
[29:28] see prophecy being fulfilled in Daniel
[29:31] chapter 2 we can pick it up this was
[29:33] projected amen thousands of years ago as
[29:36] going to be 10 toes to the image of the
[29:39] Gentile see the Gentile image would be
[29:42] the times of the Gentiles so at the end
[29:45] of the Gentile kingdoms it would be 10
[29:47] Toes that would run into the Earth and
[29:49] that iron and Clay would run that iron
[29:51] would run into every nation now watch
[29:55] this the scripture says very clearly
[29:58] that there was 10 toes and the iron
[30:00] would run in the Bible says here in the
[30:03] Book of Daniel it said that they shall
[30:05] try to mingle with the seed of man now
[30:08] when brother Ram picks that up he said
[30:09] see mingle with a with with the seed of
[30:12] man do y'all realize that just a few
[30:14] hundred years ago the worst thing for a
[30:16] Protestant to do was to marry into a
[30:18] Catholic home or for a Catholic to marry
[30:21] a Protestant but here in the end now
[30:24] watch watch how the in Maring begin to
[30:26] take place and we're all the same so all
[30:29] of a sudden in the 1960s you see a civil
[30:31] rights movement remember that now
[30:34] everybody just thinks it's about race
[30:35] and civil rights and all of that brother
[30:37] BR said but watch if you could just see
[30:39] what's behind it he said Martin Luther
[30:42] King's being used by the Catholic Church
[30:45] to swing the black vote from Lincoln's
[30:48] party of Republic into the Democratic
[30:51] vote he said so they can put a Catholic
[30:54] president in America now look that iron
[30:58] was going to run right into our
[31:01] president's office isn't that something
[31:03] brother B said you think it's something
[31:05] when you get Kennedy here as a president
[31:08] he said you wait till they worm their
[31:10] way into the cabinet you wait till they
[31:12] worm their way that iron is right now
[31:15] whether y'all know it or not we're back
[31:16] again with a Catholic President amen
[31:19] whether you stopped and thought about it
[31:21] right now I think what is there nine
[31:23] justices on our Supreme Court seven of
[31:25] them are the Roman Catholic
[31:28] church are that meant they're not going
[31:31] to take control they're in control the
[31:34] highest office in the land is controlled
[31:36] by the iron that run from the Roman
[31:39] Empire it's run into our nation and took
[31:41] our politics it's joined itself together
[31:45] amen now it's not exercising its power
[31:47] at this moment but you give it a few
[31:49] days and they it's already set up to
[31:51] take place amen I'm not a crazy man it's
[31:54] written right here in the Bible that
[31:56] it'll run and it has run it's run into
[31:59] the toes now now if you if you study
[32:01] your scripture it said it'll mingle and
[32:03] watch how they mingled and married in
[32:05] and now they broke down brother B said
[32:07] they broke it down to break the power of
[32:09] the Protestant church so they brought
[32:11] the Catholics in married them in and
[32:13] broke down the Protestant church now
[32:15] I'll just give you one quick thing you
[32:17] can just take this and think about this
[32:19] on your way home today do you recognize
[32:21] that one of the number one conservative
[32:23] news stations is Fox
[32:24] News one of the number one uh news
[32:27] station
[32:28] contributors is Sean Hannity how many
[32:30] knows he's a
[32:31] Catholic then the conservative voice in
[32:35] America has become
[32:37] Catholic people are leaning on the
[32:39] Catholic church for conservative ideas
[32:43] can you imagine when we have went to the
[32:45] Harlot system to become conservative
[32:48] it's the only fight against
[32:50] homosexuality it's the only one standing
[32:52] against abortion are you seeing it now
[32:55] the Protestant churches are joining
[32:56] together to bring strength strengthen
[32:58] the political Realms so that they can
[33:00] overcome it look where we're setting
[33:01] friends we're right Amen to the toes of
[33:05] Nebuchadnezzar's dream standing right
[33:07] there in that hour now now you might
[33:09] think some whether way you're taking
[33:10] this too far but let me let me take you
[33:12] back in the scripture in 1960 when a
[33:15] prophet of God began to say watch now he
[33:17] said there is five toes on those feet
[33:20] East and West Rome he said from the West
[33:23] watch in brother Ram's time 1960 you can
[33:25] go look at in the history books amen
[33:27] there's a great big conference that
[33:28] happens amen and there is a five from
[33:31] the East and five from the West now who
[33:33] would have ever knew the burlam wall
[33:35] would be put up 1945 separating the East
[33:37] and West into communism and to the
[33:40] social governments amen but the
[33:41] scriptures amen tell us how that the
[33:44] iron and Clay would mix and they would
[33:46] be on toes and brother B said to every
[33:47] foot is a big toe he said so has this
[33:51] one got a big toe and in that conference
[33:54] he said two big toes one representing
[33:57] the east one the West was Eisenhower and
[34:00] Koff you can go read the history on it
[34:03] there they got they got Google pictures
[34:05] where kof he gets mad in the middle of
[34:07] this meeting and reaches and pulls his
[34:09] shoe off and bangs it on the desk and
[34:12] brother man said look it up it means
[34:14] Kucha means clay amen it means clay I
[34:19] thought isn't that something it means
[34:21] clay and Eisenhower means iron he said
[34:25] and right there is two big toes on the
[34:27] on the feet of this image Amen in 1960
[34:31] Now isn't it amazing to you it is to me
[34:34] that at the same time a word Prophet is
[34:37] on the age that there is a big toe
[34:39] showing up amen right there on that
[34:42] image amen listen if a prophet hadn't
[34:44] been here we would have never recognized
[34:46] it we would have never identified that
[34:49] conference with the big toes of this
[34:51] image but because there was a prophet
[34:53] there a Prophet is announcing we are at
[34:56] the time of judgment we're at the hour
[34:59] when God will tear down this entire
[35:02] Babylonian Kingdom my when brother
[35:05] branam reads that he says it like this
[35:07] in the uncertain sound in 1961 he took
[35:10] off his shoe and beat it on the desk now
[35:12] I don't know if any of you have ever
[35:13] amen if if you're like me just s and
[35:15] thought about this a minute but why not
[35:17] his
[35:18] fist why not his head why not his coat
[35:22] why not why not a stick why did he take
[35:24] his shoe off amen but brother random
[35:27] says it fulfills exactly what was
[35:30] prophesied amen we can think about that
[35:33] how that Daniel was seeing that far
[35:35] ahead of time amen that God was showing
[35:37] in symbol that he would beat that right
[35:40] there and show that the that the feet of
[35:43] Nebuchadnezzar's dream is upon the earth
[35:46] now you say preacher why does that
[35:48] matter so much because the streak runs
[35:51] into every nation in other words the
[35:53] Catholic church has two
[35:55] churches it has a Protestant and it has
[35:59] a Catholic Rome has two churches
[36:02] everybody thinks if I'm Protestant I'm
[36:05] against the Roman church but the
[36:07] Protestant denomination is the same
[36:09] system as the Roman Church and since
[36:11] they couldn't make you a Roman they gave
[36:13] the same system under another name and
[36:16] you join up with that system but the
[36:17] Bible said that there would come one in
[36:20] the last days who would pull the scheme
[36:22] off of the whole thing and a light would
[36:24] be shined upon it as the church would
[36:27] see the the Judgment that's falling upon
[36:29] the Earth we are not the children of
[36:31] Darkness we are the children of light
[36:33] and we see the devil we see the schem
[36:36] that has been placed upon him we are not
[36:39] here blind this morning we are not
[36:40] staggering in the blindness of leard
[36:42] deia wondering what's happening and
[36:45] who's going to rule I don't know who
[36:46] will be the next president of America
[36:48] but I know who will be the next king of
[36:50] the world it'll be Jesus Christ the son
[36:53] of God and the bride is already
[36:56] believing him they're already his
[36:59] church my the Christ has already come
[37:03] into her he's already ruling right now
[37:07] in the Church of the Living
[37:10] God brother B said there's three
[37:12] curtains now an iron curtain a bamboo
[37:14] curtain and a purple curtain you seen
[37:17] the Iron Curtain in Rome you see the B
[37:19] bamboo curtain in China hey man look all
[37:22] eyes are on China right now right watch
[37:24] that communism watch that China watch it
[37:27] everybody in America watch China and and
[37:30] right in our own political system Rome
[37:34] has took
[37:36] over do you see it we took our eyes off
[37:39] of the purple curtain and looked at the
[37:41] other curtains but brother said the
[37:43] purple curtain is the one that's going
[37:45] to bring the
[37:46] persecution sure look at what happens
[37:49] but in the days in the days watch
[37:52] brother bam prophesy the 70th week of
[37:54] Daniel 1961 but in the days of these
[37:56] Empires
[37:58] the rock that was HED out of the
[38:00] mountain will hit the image in the feet
[38:02] now watch him he shows you perfectly
[38:05] that eisenh and Kucha are the big toes
[38:08] of that image and he said in the hour of
[38:11] these rulers he said the stone will be
[38:13] hewed out of the mountain to hit the
[38:15] feet do you see what he's saying they
[38:17] are the rulers in the
[38:20] feet but I'm representing the stone
[38:23] that's coming out of the
[38:25] mountain come on Church those those
[38:27] those big toes was not big toes they
[38:31] were men representing a power of a
[38:33] kingdom and here's a prophet on the
[38:36] earth at the same time glory to God Amen
[38:39] and he's not a stone but he's a prophet
[38:42] representing the coming kingdom of God
[38:45] he's forerunning the Millennium of the
[38:48] [Applause]
[38:50] church I know that Kingdom's at it's end
[38:53] but our kingdom is
[38:55] coming my I feel so much power in me
[38:59] Hallelujah there's a kingdom that's
[39:01] coming every Kingdom will fall every
[39:04] denomination will fall Rome will fall
[39:07] Protestant will fall but there is a
[39:09] bride who cannot fall she has received
[39:13] the grace of God in the age she's living
[39:15] in what an hour to live what a time to
[39:21] live
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:26] Hallelujah
[39:27] [Applause]
[39:30] I sat there the study yesterday and
[39:33] something just swept through I said God
[39:36] how
[39:38] true it's so absolutely true it's so
[39:42] definitively true it's so powerfully
[39:46] true it'll destroy Every Lie it'll
[39:49] destroy every scheme it'll uncover every
[39:52] demonic power and bring this church into
[39:56] power
[39:57] in that hour the image the image will
[40:01] receive a blow from the
[40:06] stone my so way I ain't seen no Stones
[40:09] around
[40:10] well let's dig in a little 70th week of
[40:14] Daniel brother Ram says you don't need
[40:15] to miss this paragraph 133 look it up
[40:19] don't miss this listen close don't miss
[40:23] this and he begins then to talk about
[40:26] the church ages
[40:28] what does the church ages have to do
[40:30] with the stone that Daniel saw hitting
[40:33] the image brother bam then begins to
[40:35] build it from the Luther's age to the
[40:38] Pentecostal age of the baptism he said
[40:41] see remember it's shaping into the stone
[40:45] do do you actually have that pyramid is
[40:46] it able to pull it up the pyramid
[40:48] pitcher I don't know if he's able to do
[40:50] it I it just sprung it on him but
[40:52] brother random talks about this and he
[40:54] talks about a pyramid to the church now
[40:58] now it's another image right not the
[41:00] image of Daniel he's talking about now
[41:02] we're talking about the image of the
[41:04] church and we're going to start it in
[41:07] second Peter 1 and we're going to build
[41:09] it from Faith unto
[41:11] love it's powerful isn't it build it
[41:13] from Faith to love how many knows what
[41:15] the Capstone in second Peter was was
[41:18] love right if you if you look at Faith
[41:21] Temperance knowledge any virtue all of
[41:23] those things none of them did God ever
[41:26] say I am am faith I am knowledge but
[41:30] when it come to love amen he said God is
[41:33] love is that right then Paul tells us
[41:36] that charity is the Capstone of every
[41:39] life are you hearing me it was after the
[41:42] seals are preached it was capped off by
[41:45] token by the literal life of Jesus
[41:48] Christ because it was all put in there
[41:51] now if you look at that right there
[41:52] build that up from Faith all the way to
[41:54] brotherly kindness which allowed to see
[41:56] an age represented
[41:57] amen but now I I don't want to shock you
[42:00] but I want you to know there's something
[42:01] Beyond just allowed Us in age which is
[42:05] the bride of Christ it's a New Jerusalem
[42:08] read Revelation 21 and see if she don't
[42:10] come down out of Heaven she don't come
[42:12] up from the Earth but the Bible said
[42:14] that there was a pyramid-shaped mountain
[42:16] that rules over there Amen in in Mount
[42:19] olives divides and a mountain comes up
[42:21] in the pyramid shape but the city comes
[42:23] down from heaven which is the New
[42:26] Jerusalem but there is a spiritual type
[42:28] come on now I just brought put out a
[42:31] disclaimer s case somebody reads this or
[42:34] listens to this thanks I'm crazy let me
[42:36] ask you this why do we call it Le oysa
[42:38] there's no City here called leysia amen
[42:41] there's no City Ephesians and Paul in
[42:43] this generation or leysa or Philadelphia
[42:46] it wasn't because of the city it was the
[42:48] spirit of the city that was living in
[42:51] the people so you're allowed to see it
[42:53] by a spirit and there's allowed to see a
[42:56] real City that's over there in Asia is
[42:58] that right amen and so is there a real
[43:01] city of the New Jerusalem amen it'll be
[43:04] an eighth day but so is there a people
[43:06] with the spirit of New Jerusalem that's
[43:09] alive today and here Christ is ruling in
[43:12] that City no not the Bible said and
[43:15] there's no need of a light there's no
[43:17] need of a sun or a moon for the lamb is
[43:20] the light of that City and think about
[43:23] who's the light of the Church of the
[43:25] Living God Jesus Christ Christ is our
[43:28] [Applause]
[43:29] light by the way there's nothing Beyond
[43:31] it now brother brandom said there was in
[43:34] Revelation chapter three the Bible said
[43:36] that Christ was on the
[43:38] outside so there's loud to see in church
[43:41] and then there's Christ you want to see
[43:43] it in the plant it's easiest there's a
[43:45] shuck and then there's a seed Perfection
[43:48] comes you know Perfection has come when
[43:51] the seed leaves the shook then the seed
[43:54] is beyond the three stages of of of of
[43:58] what you're trying to get to you're
[44:00] getting to all of it you don't have a
[44:02] stage you have it all come on now let's
[44:06] just get clear baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:07] ain't as far as it goes now but baptism
[44:10] makes a way come on I know some don't
[44:13] like it but it's what a prophet said it
[44:15] made a way for the Holy Ghost himself is
[44:19] it predicted in Scripture that Christ
[44:21] himself would come orock is it not
[44:23] written in first Thessalonians 4 the
[44:25] Lord himself would descend from heaven
[44:27] is it not written in John 14 yet a
[44:29] little while and the world see me no
[44:31] more but you shall see me I will be with
[44:34] you even in You Until the End of the Age
[44:37] my we ought to be able to climb on Every
[44:38] Mountain this morning and say this day
[44:41] this scripture is fulfilled in our midst
[44:44] God has made himself real in the Church
[44:47] of the Living God we're not here
[44:49] guessing what's about happening we see
[44:52] the Nebuchadnezzar's image but I'm not
[44:55] blind I see the stone that's shed out of
[44:58] the
[44:59] mountain keep watching till you can see
[45:02] it the Bible said Daniel watch till he
[45:05] saw that stone don't quit looking don't
[45:08] stop looking keep watching come on come
[45:11] on guys go look
[45:14] again go look again I don't see it
[45:18] brother Wayne look again it's there look
[45:20] again the prophecy said a former and
[45:22] lighter rain shall come in the last day
[45:25] you quit looking too quick and you put
[45:27] it off to another age but if you'll go
[45:29] look again he said I seen a cloud the
[45:32] size of a man's hand I believe there's a
[45:34] church today that has seen a cloud in
[45:37] the sky and we have noticed what it
[45:46] was
[45:48] well if there's a question don't just
[45:50] come out I'll be glad to give you
[45:53] scripture now remember the headstone
[45:56] goodby back to that picture The
[45:58] Headstone now you I I won't teach the
[46:01] whole thing I just want to bring it to
[46:03] your mind that pyramids you're looking
[46:05] at from some second Peter chapter
[46:07] 1 look on the left side look on the
[46:10] right
[46:11] side isn't it beautiful it's represented
[46:14] in two different
[46:16] ways look at that image back there two
[46:18] different
[46:19] ways same thing so different prophecies
[46:23] can speak of the same thing I think
[46:27] that's a real lesson we should take in
[46:28] our
[46:29] heart different prophecies but speaking
[46:32] of the same thing now watch what he's
[46:35] doing when that when that comes there
[46:36] brother R takes this pyramid goes back
[46:39] to Egypt when Enoch left a sign right he
[46:43] left a sign brother said Enoch's sign
[46:46] amen is answered in the future home book
[46:49] remember and showed the pyramid now the
[46:52] pyramid never was capped brother Bram
[46:54] comes back and preaches and shows the
[46:56] pyram was never CA when Jesus came
[46:59] because he was rejected is that right in
[47:02] the days of Jesus Christ how many knows
[47:04] he was the rejected
[47:05] headstone amen he was The Headstone now
[47:08] watch brother Brandon will tell this now
[47:10] the rejected Stone in the pyramid
[47:12] seventh week 70 week of Daniel you I
[47:14] think you got the quote let's go to
[47:15] paragraph
[47:16] 135 amen now we're going to skip a
[47:19] little bit I'm going reading and Skip so
[47:20] you'll have to just follow me but
[47:21] remember the headstone wasn't on yet
[47:23] they shaped the church exactly the
[47:25] pyramid to fit in the headstone The
[47:27] Headstone never did come now the
[47:29] ministry of Luther to the end of
[47:31] Pentecost a little bit of minority and
[47:33] the reason the light almost goes out in
[47:34] the age it's the Pentecostal age the
[47:37] Pentecostal denominations they do just
[47:39] like the leot Deans they are leot Deans
[47:42] so if you looking for Le oysa it's
[47:45] Pentecost now they did like nicians but
[47:48] they true church all over the world has
[47:50] been shaped down to the place that
[47:51] there's a Ministry among them that's
[47:53] exactly like the ministry of Jesus
[47:55] Christ now now they got the thing of the
[47:57] condition what is it the next thing the
[47:59] rejected Stone to the pyramid the
[48:00] cutting out of the mountain without
[48:02] hands see do you see it the rejected one
[48:04] the rejected stone is the head he is the
[48:08] Capstone the very one that is rejected
[48:10] to the Gentile age is Christ and Christ
[48:12] was cut and put in here zra the Son of
[48:14] God some great dignitary in the church
[48:16] he's the Holy
[48:18] Spirit and the cap of the pyramid will
[48:21] be the coming of Christ now because it's
[48:23] in the shape I got this shape like a
[48:25] pyramid the arising Saints makes the
[48:27] March into Glory understand Christ The
[48:29] Headstone rejected Stone the all see and
[48:31] eye Daniel said watch the Gentile age
[48:34] until the Stone come out of the mountain
[48:35] that wasn't cut with hands they never
[48:38] put a Capstone on that pyramid it wasn't
[48:41] cut by man's hand it's God's hands cut
[48:43] the stone you see it hit the image
[48:45] smacked it in the feet broke it to
[48:47] Pieces grounded in powder what happened
[48:49] at that time the coming of that stone up
[48:51] went the church into the glory the
[48:53] Rapture so the coming of the stone and
[48:55] the Rapture in the church are now
[48:56] paralleling look what he's saying it's
[48:58] at the ending of the Gentile
[49:00] dispensation the coming of that stone
[49:02] now think of this brother Bram has just
[49:04] tied together your Capstone to the
[49:07] Pyramid of second Peter with the stone
[49:10] of Daniel 2 that's hitting the feet of
[49:12] Nebuchadnezzar's image so the stone that
[49:15] you're accepting as the capping of your
[49:18] life is the stone that destroys the
[49:21] image of Nebuchadnezzar now think about
[49:23] that just a minute what you are praying
[49:26] to come is the thing that's going to
[49:28] destroy Nations now now look at this it
[49:31] destroys everything that doesn't belong
[49:34] to God just like you as an individual
[49:37] when this message came into your life
[49:39] you remember the trinitarian doctrine in
[49:42] one time of hearing this message it
[49:45] broke it to
[49:46] Pieces is that right look at you look at
[49:49] how you run up against that stone and
[49:51] you broke off of your Li trinitarian
[49:54] doctrines you broke off false baptism
[49:56] and and denominational thinking of every
[49:59] kind you broke it right off of you
[50:01] because if you want to think right bring
[50:04] your thinking to the message of the hour
[50:06] it's the headstone to the church it'll
[50:09] break it off amen it'll bring it into
[50:12] rights and it'll it'll straighten up the
[50:14] way you see things now I I think that
[50:17] Christ is the stone now I thought it was
[50:20] amazing yesterday I was sitting there
[50:21] reading that brother B was talking about
[50:23] that stone coming and crushing the whole
[50:25] earth and middle of him saying he said
[50:27] oh Church flee to the
[50:30] stone and I thought wait a minute the
[50:33] judgments are coming and we're fleeing
[50:35] to it we are fleeing to the thing that
[50:38] is bringing
[50:40] judgment think about it what's bringing
[50:43] judgment to the world is bringing
[50:46] Vindication to the
[50:47] church the judge is not putting you
[50:50] under judgment he's putting you under a
[50:53] pardon because a lawyer can't pardon you
[50:57] a cop can't pardon you but it takes a
[50:59] judge to bring a pardon and until the
[51:02] judge until the headstone come that
[51:04] could not be a true pardon of the church
[51:07] because then a prophet look what he does
[51:08] he said you never did it in the first
[51:11] place where was the first place it was
[51:13] in the mind of God and somebody had to
[51:16] bring the mind of God to the Earth which
[51:19] brought back your original
[51:22] identity The Headstone which is the Holy
[51:24] Ghost which is Christ amen now he's
[51:27] saying flee to that now it looks like
[51:29] judgment looks like judgment to the
[51:32] world but you remember in the first when
[51:35] Babylonian fell to the mes and Persians
[51:37] you remember what was happening in that
[51:39] very moment when they were following
[51:41] Sirius the King of Persia was moving in
[51:43] same time and under the prophecy of
[51:46] Daniel the children of Israel would
[51:48] return to Jerusalem and they would
[51:50] rebuild the Tabernacle of worship in
[51:52] Jerusalem at the same time of the fall
[51:55] of one Kingdom
[51:57] was Israel's Deliverance to rebuild
[51:59] their Tabernacle so in Zechariah 4 it
[52:03] said that when zerubabel shall come he
[52:05] shall come forth with a headstone crying
[52:08] Grace Grace now look it was a judgment
[52:12] to Babylon mes and Persians broke down
[52:14] their rule but it released Israel to
[52:17] true worship they had been waiting 70
[52:20] years to return and to worship under a
[52:22] finished Tabernacle and to think this
[52:25] morning the Church of the Living God has
[52:27] been going 2,000 years of the church
[52:29] looking for God to restore to the church
[52:32] an original worship now I tell you this
[52:36] a lot of people think a lot of things
[52:37] about worship but this message restores
[52:39] true
[52:40] worship cuz you can't really worship god
[52:43] Till You Know Who You
[52:45] Are you can't really worship till you
[52:47] know who you are if you're just a if
[52:49] you're just a visitor you're going to
[52:51] worship one
[52:52] way you come to my house as a visitor
[52:55] you're going to come in the door a
[52:56] certain way you come in as my son it'll
[52:59] be a different way but you come in as my
[53:01] wife it'll be a whole different way and
[53:03] if you know who you are in the
[53:05] house it brings a certain measure of
[53:08] worship come on Church he's not
[53:11] announced that you're just a church
[53:13] you're not just a bunch of
[53:15] flirters but he's brought you into the
[53:17] third room this is the Bride of Jesus
[53:20] Christ restored worship has returned to
[53:24] the house of God Amen I tell tell you
[53:26] this you don't come to my house and get
[53:28] on to my wife for praising
[53:31] me are you hearing me amen don't you
[53:33] ever if my wife if she was doing it and
[53:36] she was talking about how wonderful I
[53:37] was don't you ever stop her and don't
[53:40] you ever try to stop the Church of the
[53:43] Living God from telling about the glory
[53:46] of their God and the power of their
[53:48] Christ let me tell you he's the king of
[53:51] all Kings he's the Lord of all ain't
[53:54] nobody like my Jesus
[53:56] [Applause]
[53:58] [Music]
[54:01] restored worship restored worship has
[54:04] begun it's put it back in its order it's
[54:07] placed it back zerubba coming with a
[54:09] headstone crying Grace Grace so the
[54:11] Judgment of the world and you're crying
[54:15] Grace the stone that destroys the world
[54:18] is your rescue it's your Liberty it's
[54:21] your
[54:23] husband now you all know brother B said
[54:26] this hour is coming to be in come on now
[54:29] he said why this Prophet have to come so
[54:31] you'd know your mate the revealed word
[54:32] of the hour so he was talking about a
[54:35] coming in the word not in his physical
[54:37] body which is in the
[54:40] future is that
[54:43] true when you doing away with the
[54:44] physical body oh no we're going to see
[54:46] that in the Rapture then we're going to
[54:48] come back with him in the Millennium but
[54:50] there's a bump of people living here
[54:51] today that'll never see that till out
[54:53] white Throne
[54:55] judgment Bible said rest the Dead live
[54:57] not for a thousand
[54:59] years now notice this because brother
[55:01] Bram will tie this to Revelation 3 and14
[55:03] the 7th Angel which is also Elijah of
[55:07] Malachi 4 he'll come crying Grace Grace
[55:11] in Revelations 5 different prophecies
[55:14] same Ministry Revelations 5 you'll see
[55:18] that he's the Elder that said somebody
[55:20] here that is worthy must take the book
[55:24] when it actually happens in 196 63 in
[55:26] March brother bandam standing on the
[55:28] platform the message called the breach
[55:30] he said let him come forward now or
[55:32] forever hold his peace in other words
[55:35] the ministry that is to introduce him is
[55:37] here the introducer standing on the
[55:40] platform now let him come forward now
[55:44] when he come forward it wasn't a man
[55:46] Jesus the nails guard man come walking
[55:48] out on the
[55:49] platform right but it was the
[55:53] revelation of the word of the age they
[55:55] were Liv in and a prophet introduced you
[55:58] to a true
[56:00] Revelation come on now it's the truth he
[56:04] began to reveal it in a true Revelation
[56:06] which fulfilled the scripture brother
[56:08] Braham said when I seen those Mysteries
[56:10] unfolding I cried Grace
[56:13] Grace bringing the grace to the church
[56:15] for a Rapture it was the thing that
[56:18] called you out of Babylon think about it
[56:20] Revelations 18 and4 a great Angel come
[56:23] from heaven and lighted the Earth with
[56:24] his glory he brought a light and said
[56:28] Babylon is falling is falling Babylon
[56:30] ain't fail but Babylon is falling is
[56:33] falling he's announcing the fall of
[56:35] Babylon and he's telling the church come
[56:37] out of her my
[56:41] people come on now 1960 went beyond the
[56:44] curtain of time Millions come running
[56:46] brother M this who is these people
[56:48] they're your
[56:49] people they're your people those people

[56:56] brought him into the
[57:02] Rock Revelations 18 and4 come out over
[57:05] my people and be not partakers of her
[57:07] fornications the city was going to burn
[57:10] the systems are going to be destroyed
[57:12] this is the same Angel you like prophecy
[57:15] Revelations 14 same angel now I think
[57:17] it's the ninth verse he's the third
[57:19] angel in that verse and said you cannot
[57:22] worship the image of the Beast and God
[57:24] at the same time so you cannot be in a
[57:27] denominational system and worship God
[57:31] you're worshiping the devil but you
[57:32] don't know
[57:36] it people people get to say well well
[57:39] Wayne it ain't too bad it's just a nice
[57:41] church it's this and this listen that's
[57:43] the iron of Rome running in a Protestant
[57:46] church trying to put people's names upon
[57:49] their book which is receiving the mark
[57:51] of the
[57:52] beast William brandom spent an entire
[57:55] service one time comes toward the end
[57:57] and says listen now denomination is the
[57:59] mark of the beast he said now that's
[58:01] what I come to say call the prayer
[58:05] line I come to say denomination is the
[58:08] mark of the beast it's not a chip in
[58:10] your hand it's not a tattoo on your
[58:14] forehead come on church it's not your
[58:16] social security card it's not
[58:19] Y2K are you hearing me amen it's not the
[58:24] vaccines that's the same Devil he's been
[58:27] I'm old enough now you young people I'm
[58:29] old enough and brother Ray amen no
[58:31] telling how many schemes he's heard but
[58:33] when the S security card come that was
[58:35] it when the first debit card started
[58:38] coming that that was it amen when the
[58:41] first GPS has come that's it when Y2K
[58:45] that's it it was always been the mark of
[58:47] the beast and I don't blame the devil
[58:48] for promoting his lies because all the
[58:51] while he's lying to the world he's
[58:52] hiding under religion and he's ruling
[58:55] through religion in the churches they're
[58:58] worshiping the devil and don't know it
[59:01] the vaccine is not the mark of the beast
[59:04] religion is the mark of the
[59:06] beast it falls at the same time the mark
[59:09] of the beast and the Seal of God the
[59:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost seals the
[59:14] church come on Church seals you into God
[59:17] but the mark of the beast is denying the
[59:19] Seal of God Amen you cannot receive the
[59:23] mark of the beast if you have received
[59:25] the Holy
[59:27] ghost Hallelujah come on
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:32] Church you can't do it if you receive
[59:35] the Holy Ghost you're sealed already
[59:39] said preacher what are you saying let me
[59:40] tell you what brother random said he
[59:41] said who can make war with her
[59:43] Revelation 17 who can make war with her
[59:46] he said because he the pope has
[59:48] influence with everybody who could make
[59:50] war with them he said now watch this he
[59:53] said the reason they have a world system
[59:56] is because of denominational
[59:59] preachers he said they have give that
[1:00:02] thing Power by their denominational
[1:00:04] teaching can you imagine amen a Catholic
[1:00:07] Church holding power over you with a
[1:00:09] message preacher you take a message
[1:00:12] preacher and put in the denomination
[1:00:13] they'll throw him out or throw the
[1:00:14] denomination
[1:00:16] out and if they all get along he ain't a
[1:00:18] message
[1:00:24] preacher if you can get along with
[1:00:27] denomination you're not a message
[1:00:28] preacher you're not a message belie said
[1:00:30] brother Wayne we are to love everybody
[1:00:31] we are to love everybody but the Bible
[1:00:34] said come out of her and be not
[1:00:36] partakers of her fornication don't you
[1:00:39] realize judgment is falling on that
[1:00:42] thing brother Wayne it won't hurt me
[1:00:44] nothing it won't the anointing of that
[1:00:46] unbelief has gotten me questioning
[1:00:47] whether brother R's even a prophet
[1:00:49] because they lost their nerve to say
[1:00:51] William brandom in front of a crowd
[1:00:53] because the devil dumbed them down
[1:00:55] twisted their arm you're going to lose
[1:00:56] the church you're going to lose your
[1:00:58] ministry well listen if this message
[1:01:00] makes a man lose his ministry he didn't
[1:01:02] have a Ministry to start with but if God
[1:01:05] gives a man a Ministry he said I'm the
[1:01:07] Lord that plth and I'll Water it day and
[1:01:10] night let some man Puck it out of my
[1:01:12] hand we don't need a denominational
[1:01:14] system as a Ministry of the sons of God
[1:01:17] what we need is a church full of the
[1:01:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll amen
[1:01:22] the word of God and we'll take down
[1:01:24] every statue and every image the devil
[1:01:26] has put up against the presence of
[1:01:32] God now brother man come along and said
[1:01:35] my Ministry is
[1:01:38] different I am here to declare
[1:01:43] him and he is
[1:01:45] here how many times you ever heard
[1:01:47] brother B say I can't be him but he's
[1:01:50] here who who is he who's he the spirit
[1:01:54] of truth of John 16
[1:01:56] come on Church there's not three
[1:01:59] Gods The Headstone is the Holy Ghost the
[1:02:02] person of Christ who comes as the word
[1:02:05] in Revelations 19 hold on to your seats
[1:02:08] there's a sword coming out of the mouth
[1:02:11] of a white horse rider in the last day
[1:02:13] it is the word of
[1:02:15] God I know a lot of people a lot of
[1:02:18] people think well brother Wayne there's
[1:02:19] coming this great Millennium brother our
[1:02:21] lord Jesus is going to ride out of
[1:02:22] heaven with all these horses and they're
[1:02:23] going to tear down the kingdoms of the
[1:02:25] world and all
[1:02:27] listen Study Bible Study Bible prophecy
[1:02:30] just a few minutes and go to the
[1:02:32] Armageddon and see who's going to
[1:02:33] destroy the
[1:02:34] world look at Armageddon see who's going
[1:02:37] to destroy the world they destroy
[1:02:39] themselves with Adam
[1:02:41] bombs you know it's true they're going
[1:02:43] to burn themselves with Adam
[1:02:45] bombs in Gog and MOG God's going to burn
[1:02:48] the whole world with a brimstone and
[1:02:50] fire but in this one God doesn't destroy
[1:02:53] them personally they destroy themselves
[1:02:55] because they've rejected the word and
[1:02:57] can't stand the word has pulled the
[1:02:59] foundations and their confusion comes
[1:03:01] and they kill one
[1:03:03] another well that's the
[1:03:06] scripture now his ministry is different
[1:03:09] so headship is here The Headstone is
[1:03:11] here now watch what it is it's
[1:03:13] identified in the scripture now that
[1:03:16] stone there's only one thing left to
[1:03:19] strike it's that stone now I think we
[1:03:21] could say it clearly the stone then is
[1:03:24] not granite it's a
[1:03:27] person a person now you brother Wayne a
[1:03:30] rock is a person sure in SEC 1 Peter
[1:03:33] chapter 2 in verse four he's coming
[1:03:35] under a Lively Stone disallowed of men
[1:03:37] but chosen of God precious yet a Lively
[1:03:40] Stone build up a spiritual house a holy
[1:03:42] priesthood spiritual sacrifice accepted
[1:03:44] by God wherefore also contained in the
[1:03:46] scripture behold I lay and Zion a Chief
[1:03:48] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[1:03:51] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[1:03:53] unto therefore that believe he is
[1:03:55] precious
[1:03:56] but unto them that are disobedient the
[1:03:58] stone that the builders rejected the
[1:04:00] same as made the head it's the same
[1:04:03] person and stone of stumbling a rock of
[1:04:06] offense even to them which stumbl at the
[1:04:08] word being disobedient unto which they
[1:04:10] were appointed so he is a person a
[1:04:13] living
[1:04:14] Stone you believe it was a spiritual
[1:04:16] Rock in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and
[1:04:19] verse4 and they drank of the same
[1:04:21] spiritual drink and they drank of that
[1:04:23] spiritual rock that followed them which
[1:04:25] was Christ
[1:04:27] Jesus he was a rock in the wilderness do
[1:04:31] y'all know brother ramam said that was
[1:04:32] before the Masterpiece was made out of
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:36] rock in the Book of Luke the 20th
[1:04:39] chapter Jesus's own words beheld them
[1:04:42] what is this then that has written the
[1:04:43] stone which the builders rejected the
[1:04:45] same has become the head of the corner
[1:04:47] whosoever shall fall on that stone shall
[1:04:49] be broken but on whomsoever it shall
[1:04:52] fall it shall grind it powder
[1:04:56] I don't know exactly the translation of
[1:04:58] that word fall upon or fall on but I
[1:05:01] would think it would be pretty pretty
[1:05:03] easy to say that if you want to break
[1:05:06] Spirits off of you fall on that stone if
[1:05:09] you want to be broken let the stone fall
[1:05:10] on
[1:05:12] you amen now in Acts chapter 4 the Bible
[1:05:15] says again be it known unto you all
[1:05:17] Israel the name of Jesus Christ you have
[1:05:18] crucified him God has raised the Dead
[1:05:21] who stand before you hold this is the
[1:05:22] stone which is set at not of your
[1:05:24] Builders which is become the head of the
[1:05:26] corner neither is there any salvation in
[1:05:28] any other for there is none other name
[1:05:30] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[1:05:33] there's only one name that represents
[1:05:34] that stone spiritual Stone headstone
[1:05:38] rejected Stone Christ now notice this
[1:05:41] because this brings very current to us
[1:05:43] we're going to close very soon Romans
[1:05:45] the 9th chapter watch the scripture
[1:05:47] wherefore because thou sought it not by
[1:05:49] faith but as the were the works of the
[1:05:51] law they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone
[1:05:54] as it is written behold I lay in Zion a
[1:05:56] stumbling Stone a rock of offense and
[1:05:58] whosoever believeth upon Him shall not
[1:06:01] be ashamed now that's a that's a
[1:06:04] powerful reading amen but bring that to
[1:06:06] the message of the hour then because in
[1:06:09] 1962 I read to you just the other
[1:06:11] Thursday night S as this a sign how many
[1:06:13] remembers it it was six dreams and then
[1:06:15] a vision the vision brother bam was
[1:06:17] having was of them seven angels coming
[1:06:19] to him is that right he said and I
[1:06:22] prayed Lord what does this vision mean
[1:06:25] to me me he said then the spirit struck
[1:06:28] me and I came to myself reading the
[1:06:30] Bible in the corner wonder what Bible
[1:06:32] verse brother Bram was reading compared
[1:06:35] to that vision of them Angels coming to
[1:06:37] him he meant and S say this a sign
[1:06:39] brother brandham says I came to myself I
[1:06:41] found myself over in the corner and I
[1:06:43] could hear my wife trying to shake the
[1:06:45] door and in the bedroom was locked I had
[1:06:47] a Bible open it was reading I don't know
[1:06:49] but it was in I believe Romans the 9th
[1:06:51] chapter the last verse behold I lay and
[1:06:53] Zion a Cornerstone a stone of stumbling
[1:06:56] a precious stone whosoever believeth on
[1:06:58] him shall not be ashamed so the seals
[1:07:02] coming to a prophet he's identifying As
[1:07:05] Romans the 9th
[1:07:07] chapter now think of this because Christ
[1:07:09] has always been that stone but it
[1:07:11] doesn't say that stone would come and
[1:07:13] hit it in the head it said the stone
[1:07:15] would hit it in the feet so at the time
[1:07:18] of those emper then the stone would
[1:07:20] strike those feet and it would hit there
[1:07:22] that stone would be the rock or the
[1:07:24] revelation of Christ that would come
[1:07:26] into that
[1:07:28] age now if you just leave it as a stone
[1:07:30] that's pretty interesting but if you go
[1:07:32] to Daniel the 7th chapter we don't have
[1:07:34] time to read all this but you can read
[1:07:36] it when you get home we'll probably
[1:07:37] continue on it later but in Daniel the
[1:07:39] 7th chapter if you like a reading you'll
[1:07:41] find out this that Daniel sees the same
[1:07:43] thing in Daniel 7 but when he sees the
[1:07:46] destruction of these Beast he doesn't
[1:07:48] see it as a stone he sees it as one
[1:07:51] called the Ancient of
[1:07:53] Days now look at this in Daniel 7 watch
[1:07:57] now the beasts that are there represent
[1:07:59] perfectly the kingdoms of the world the
[1:08:01] same as the image so you can see Rome
[1:08:04] and you can see Greece and you can see
[1:08:06] Babylon you can see image and Beast
[1:08:08] image and Beast image and Beast Daniel 7
[1:08:11] right anden but watch now the same thing
[1:08:14] is with the stone that strikes the toes
[1:08:16] also can be seen in Daniel 7 but he seen
[1:08:19] as the Ancient of Days how many knows
[1:08:22] the Bible said and when the son of man
[1:08:24] come to the ancient of
[1:08:26] days I remember when I first read that I
[1:08:29] thought there was two of them for sure I
[1:08:31] thought well the two Lord people got it
[1:08:32] right I I just messed it up the son of
[1:08:35] man comes to the ancient days that's why
[1:08:36] the world teaches it the son of man
[1:08:38] comes to the ancient days that's when
[1:08:40] that he stands up for the people when
[1:08:41] the Ancient of Days but you know when I
[1:08:44] was studying this God has a simple way
[1:08:46] to show simple people I was sitting in
[1:08:47] my living room reading this and Zach
[1:08:50] went walking across the floor and he was
[1:08:52] about I don't know maybe 13 14 year old
[1:08:54] and it was like a a voice said to me he
[1:08:56] wasn't always that
[1:08:58] size but I watched that boy move from a
[1:09:02] child to a
[1:09:03] man you've seen the transition from a
[1:09:06] young man to a father but he's the same
[1:09:10] person and you see the son of man will
[1:09:13] move to the Ancient of Days you will see
[1:09:16] he will move from a prophetic Ministry
[1:09:19] and start moving into the Judgment now
[1:09:22] now you may think that I'm crazy here
[1:09:23] and you say well brother Wayne what does
[1:09:25] this do have to do with the message of
[1:09:27] the hour we go read thinking man's fure
[1:09:29] Amen in 1965 brother bandam ties the
[1:09:32] ancient of the days with a one like wool
[1:09:34] to Revelations the first chapter when
[1:09:36] John sees one with a hair like wool and
[1:09:38] eyes like fire do you have a picture
[1:09:40] there Amen brother random tells us that
[1:09:42] this picture that was taken in Tucson in
[1:09:45] 1963 is what John was seeing in
[1:09:48] Revelations the first chapter when he
[1:09:50] said hair like wool and eyes like fire
[1:09:53] amen it was the judgment seven symbols
[1:09:56] of judgment that was coming upon the
[1:09:58] earth now Revelation one shows the seven
[1:10:00] symbols of judgment and when John seen
[1:10:02] him coming in judgment when John seen
[1:10:06] him coming in judgment remember the
[1:10:07] Bible said he fell on his face as dead
[1:10:10] but then he lifted a right hand to him
[1:10:12] and said fear not John I am he that was
[1:10:15] dead and am alive forever more so that
[1:10:18] was an evening time resurrection that
[1:10:21] brought judgment upon the Earth but when
[1:10:23] he looked at John brother said look at
[1:10:25] this picture good because the light is
[1:10:28] striking him and he is facing to the
[1:10:30] right side just like he did at Calvary
[1:10:34] when there was a thief on his left and
[1:10:36] there was a thief on his right he said
[1:10:39] he looked to the right to Pardon The
[1:10:41] Sinner he pardoned him and I tell you
[1:10:44] brother you you ain't you ain't felt a
[1:10:46] shock till you read what brother Bram
[1:10:47] said about that he said that sinner on
[1:10:49] the right that thief on the right
[1:10:51] hanging there he said God had never even
[1:10:53] crossed that boy's mind one
[1:10:55] time never crossed his mind until that
[1:11:00] moment and in that moment there was such
[1:11:04] power hanging before him that one word
[1:11:07] would give him eternal life you talk
[1:11:09] about the grace of God when the last one
[1:11:12] come in it was at an hour of judgment
[1:11:14] with full pardon and he didn't do
[1:11:16] nothing but receive what had come and
[1:11:19] the Church of the Living God has saw the
[1:11:22] Ancient of Days who has come from glory
[1:11:24] to reveal the word of God listen you
[1:11:27] might have been harlots and
[1:11:28] denominational fers and bartenders and
[1:11:31] every kind of dope smoker every kind of
[1:11:33] worldly event in your life but there was
[1:11:36] a stone come rolling out of the mountain
[1:11:39] and it struck your life and every
[1:11:42] Kingdom begin to fall and every devil
[1:11:45] begin to be destroyed what was happening
[1:11:48] the Ancient of Days was passing
[1:11:52] judgment passing judgment over your life
[1:11:54] you're suppos I don't want to go in
[1:11:56] judgment judgment is wonderful amen if
[1:11:58] you've been accused and you're not
[1:12:01] guilty a judge is beautiful if you've
[1:12:04] been accused of a crime and you're not
[1:12:06] guilty only a judge can send you home
[1:12:08] free and here is the Judgment of Christ
[1:12:12] coming to announce to a bride you are
[1:12:14] free from denomination you are free from
[1:12:17] your memberships you are free from your
[1:12:20] sin you are free from the ungodliness at
[1:12:23] this world come this is a harded from a
[1:12:26] judge destroys every image destroys
[1:12:30] every devil what is it it's a coming one
[1:12:33] who is striking this image you said but
[1:12:36] wa I need some scriptures okay 2
[1:12:38] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 6 and 7
[1:12:41] come on he shall reveal amen the son of
[1:12:44] predition in his time is that right amen
[1:12:48] how many knows what time it is when he
[1:12:50] reveals the son of predition when the
[1:12:52] first seal was opened he revealed the
[1:12:55] devil as a liar from the beginning amen
[1:12:58] and the devil's lied on you and every
[1:13:00] lie he ever told on you God has a truth
[1:13:03] to destroy it what destroys the LIE is
[1:13:06] the
[1:13:08] truth oh God you let anybody lie on you
[1:13:11] all they want to but the truth the truth
[1:13:14] Vindicated will destroy every lie and
[1:13:17] that's exactly what's happening amen the
[1:13:19] Bible said in 2 Thessalonians he would
[1:13:22] destroy him with the brightness of his
[1:13:24] coming
[1:13:25] can you imagine a bright light that
[1:13:28] kills every dark idea that kills every
[1:13:31] dark spirit that brings the light and it
[1:13:34] literally scatters every Darkness think
[1:13:37] about it when that stone hit that image
[1:13:39] it's scattered you put a good sharp
[1:13:41] light on a dark night and every ounce of
[1:13:44] the darkness is broken and Scattered and
[1:13:47] it flees let me tell you we're at the
[1:13:49] rising of the sun when Christ has come
[1:13:53] upon the Earth and darkness has
[1:13:55] shattered and Christ is coming into
[1:14:01] power so brother Wayne I don't know I
[1:14:03] don't hardly see how I don't hardly see
[1:14:06] how that we're able to defeat this this
[1:14:09] system and this devil is taking over the
[1:14:11] whole
[1:14:14] world you know what's amazing to
[1:14:17] me is when you read Revelation the 13th
[1:14:20] chapter it's telling about this same
[1:14:22] Beast Daniel seas and Daniel 7 Daniel
[1:14:25] sees it in four parts is that right he
[1:14:28] sees it in four different images but
[1:14:31] when when when John sees it in
[1:14:33] Revelations 13 read it and it said I saw
[1:14:37] a beast coming out of the
[1:14:39] sea and it's every image that Daniel saw
[1:14:43] in those creatures all four of them in
[1:14:45] one body all the powers of Hell into
[1:14:49] that
[1:14:50] one and Paul and and Daniel said I saw
[1:14:53] it crawling out of the sea brother BR
[1:14:55] said that sea was multitudes of people
[1:14:58] he said that is the Beast the Roman
[1:15:00] Church and he said we thought it was
[1:15:03] dead it was dying back there in Europe
[1:15:05] split right but but
[1:15:08] Constantine breathed life back into it
[1:15:12] now you want to read it in scripture the
[1:15:13] third chapter I saw one of the heads as
[1:15:15] it was wounded unto death and the deadly
[1:15:17] Loom was healed and the whole world
[1:15:19] wondered after it the whole world
[1:15:21] looking for it wondering after it now
[1:15:22] think about this a minute but right in
[1:15:25] the middle of the whole world wondering
[1:15:27] after it and looking at it it's written
[1:15:30] right here but except for them who have
[1:15:33] their names written on the Lamb's will
[1:15:34] go
[1:15:36] life right in the middle of it there's
[1:15:39] an open
[1:15:41] book right in the middle of it he brings
[1:15:43] up the Lamb's
[1:15:46] Book now the next verse you you can see
[1:15:50] America in here right you can see it it
[1:15:52] says that there was a beast that rose up
[1:15:54] out out of the land it's America looked
[1:15:57] like a lamb it took on Horns right
[1:16:00] brother Bram said see we fled
[1:16:02] persecution coming into America in this
[1:16:04] Wilderness he said but watch how it
[1:16:06] chased us over Revelation 12 how it
[1:16:08] chased us over and now that iron is
[1:16:10] running in political systems so now you
[1:16:13] have both land and you have
[1:16:16] sea but according to Daniel he saw an
[1:16:19] Ancient of Days
[1:16:20] coming in Revelation 10 and verse one
[1:16:23] what's it say I said I saw another
[1:16:25] Mighty angel coming down out of heaven
[1:16:30] and brother Richard it says he put his
[1:16:32] foot on
[1:16:34] land and he put his foot on
[1:16:37] sea he put and subdued every Kingdom
[1:16:42] amen of Rome that it could be built now
[1:16:46] look where we're standing here this
[1:16:47] morning church we're standing here
[1:16:49] before a
[1:16:50] message that can destroy every devil
[1:16:54] amen the ones that come out of the
[1:16:56] sea the ones that come out of the
[1:16:59] land whatever system that it comes out
[1:17:01] of this message has an answer to
[1:17:04] destroy to bring it under submission
[1:17:07] you're sitting here this morning you're
[1:17:09] actually
[1:17:10] representing another kingdom Alto
[1:17:13] together and here you're setting this
[1:17:15] morning with a desire for that Kingdom
[1:17:18] and every kingdom is falling right now
