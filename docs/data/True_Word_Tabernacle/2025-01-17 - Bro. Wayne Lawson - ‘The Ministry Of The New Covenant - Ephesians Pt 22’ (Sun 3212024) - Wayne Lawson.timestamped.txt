[10:36] book of uh Ephesians the 4th chapter and
[10:39] the 10th verse amen uh I want to just
[10:43] take these three verses Ephesians 4
[10:46] verses 10 11 and
[10:48] 12 and he that
[10:50] descended is the same also that
[10:55] ascended far above all heavens
[10:59] he had the lowest name on the earth yeah
[11:02] he took the lowest seat in the house
[11:05] yeah and become a foot worse
[11:07] flunky but when God lifted him up he set
[11:09] him in the highest seat in the highest
[11:12] Place far above all things amen that he
[11:16] might fulfill all things and he gave
[11:19] some and I I want you to notice what he
[11:22] says here he gave
[11:24] some he gave some Apostles and some
[11:28] prophets and some evangelist and some
[11:31] pastors and some
[11:33] teachers for the
[11:35] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[11:39] the ministry for the edifying of the
[11:43] body of Christ yes we ask the Lord to
[11:46] bless his word as you can be seated
[11:47] today I want to look here in this
[11:49] Ephesians uh series again today if I'm
[11:52] going to speak to you I want to take it
[11:53] just a context title here today I want
[11:56] to be speaking to you on the ministry of
[11:59] the New Covenant the ministry of the New
[12:03] Covenant uh Paul here is speaking of of
[12:07] five offices you many times hear it
[12:10] referred to as the five-fold ministry or
[12:13] the Ephesians 4 Ministry amen but what
[12:16] it is is it's a it's five offices that
[12:18] God has in placed in the New Testament
[12:21] Church that they were responsible for
[12:24] the gospel to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[12:27] Christ now go to mark 16:1 15 these
[12:31] words are Lord Jesus's words as we was
[12:33] if he was here with us Thursday we went
[12:35] into the work of his Ascension and how
[12:38] that the Lord Jesus uh in between the
[12:41] time that he met Mary and said don't
[12:43] touch me and then he later appears to
[12:46] Thomas and says touch me and the prophet
[12:48] said there was a there was something
[12:50] happened that he ascended unto the
[12:52] father and returned back and had Thomas
[12:54] touch him of course you find it in the
[12:56] scripture that he done the work of the
[12:58] high priest in the book of Hebrews
[13:00] chapter 9 he said he was the Forerunner
[13:02] of the church so he in in a lack of
[13:04] better way to say it he made a secret
[13:06] appearance by himself like a high priest
[13:09] would but then he returned for the
[13:12] church that the whole world might
[13:14] understand that he had made the way for
[13:16] the Church of the Living God to be
[13:18] resurrected and when he took the Saints
[13:20] in high of course as he's resurrecting
[13:22] as he's ascending his Ascension was a
[13:24] public Ascension the world might see his
[13:26] Ascension they seen his body I it must
[13:29] have been something to see him ascending
[13:32] off of the earth that and and the leader
[13:34] of them now as he was ascending the
[13:36] prophet said these were his words his
[13:38] final words mortal words to the church
[13:41] he says like this and he said unto them
[13:44] go ye unto the world and preach the
[13:47] gospel to Every Creature now this is
[13:49] different because it was just in
[13:50] Jerusalem and he said not don't go after
[13:53] them he said I have other sheep there of
[13:54] another foe but not now he said but now
[13:57] he says to them go unto all the world
[14:00] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[14:03] so the Gospel of Jesus Christ must go to
[14:05] the whole world and is to every creature
[14:08] and he that believeth is baptized and
[14:11] shall be saved so now I know there's a
[14:13] lot of different systems and people has
[14:16] applied that you got to maybe lift your
[14:18] hand or you got to shake a hand of a
[14:19] preacher or you got to join a church or
[14:21] you got to come to an altar kneel a
[14:23] certain way or you have to you people
[14:26] put a lot of things on this but Jesus
[14:28] said he that believeth is to be baptized
[14:32] and shall be saved so the significant
[14:35] part of the Gospel is he that believeth
[14:37] amen now I don't know amen what that
[14:40] sometimes entails I know there's
[14:41] different levels of that but he that
[14:43] believeth and of course believing takes
[14:45] you onto an experience with God we don't
[14:47] do away with those things but he
[14:49] believeth amen shall be baptized but he
[14:52] that believeth not shall be damned now
[14:54] the reason being is because they're
[14:55] condemned already right amen now and the
[14:59] these signs shall follow them that
[15:01] believe and in my name they shall cast
[15:04] out Devils they shall speak with new
[15:06] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[15:08] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[15:10] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[15:13] the sick and they shall recover then
[15:16] after the Lord had spoken unto them he
[15:18] was received up into heaven and set at
[15:20] the right hand of God now it's amazing
[15:23] to me these is his last words and this
[15:25] is and can I say it these is his final
[15:27] words this is the final commission You
[15:30] Preach my gospel amen and these signs
[15:32] shall follow them that believe now I
[15:34] think it's very powerful that we
[15:36] understand that we have not done away
[15:38] with the signs and wonders of the Gospel
[15:39] of Jesus Christ now one thing's for
[15:42] certain we don't follow signs and
[15:44] wonders but signs and wonders most
[15:46] certainly must follow this gospel if
[15:48] it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ it will
[15:51] follow this gospel because amen this is
[15:54] the thing that we're looking to and see
[15:56] that that we're preaching the Gospel of
[15:58] Jesus Christ which is a living
[15:59] experience with God now this is his last
[16:02] and final words he is commissioning the
[16:04] church to preach the gospel Jesus is
[16:07] ordaining a new way right amen there has
[16:10] not been a five-fold Ministry there has
[16:13] not been the administration of the
[16:15] preaching of the Gospel up until this
[16:17] time there has been a levitical order
[16:19] with the sons of Aaron they've had the
[16:21] law of Moses they've had the Sheep blood
[16:24] and the goat blood and they've had the
[16:25] Laver and they've had all of these
[16:27] Traditions but never in the history had
[16:30] there been the idea that there would be
[16:32] offices of men preaching the gospel and
[16:35] that God would bring Salvation this way
[16:38] now Jesus is instituting it so when when
[16:41] when Paul begins to preach in Ephesians
[16:43] 4 he's only bringing the offices to the
[16:46] gospel that Jesus has predicted and
[16:49] commissioned the church to do he's
[16:51] ordaining them now it's amazing because
[16:53] Paul in the book of Hebrews he is the
[16:55] one that's going to divide the old
[16:58] priesthood and the new priesthood he's
[17:00] going to show the changing in Hebrews 7
[17:03] he's going to divide the law and Grace
[17:05] and he's going to show you the
[17:06] institution of a new order a new way of
[17:09] doing things in Hebrews chapter 7 Paul
[17:12] being a student of the law he knew the
[17:14] law very well but he had met that Pillar
[17:16] of Fire and now he's dividing the two in
[17:18] part in Hebrews chapter 7 and verse 11
[17:21] here it says if therefore Perfection
[17:23] were by the levitical priesthood for
[17:26] under it the people received the law
[17:28] what further need was there that there
[17:30] would be another priest rise after the
[17:33] order of mcedc and not be called the
[17:35] order of
[17:36] Aaron amen now Paul knows in Psalms 110
[17:41] that it was David that said Thou Art my
[17:43] son and amen Thou shalt be a priest
[17:45] Forever After the order of mecdc so
[17:48] there was a a promise that there would
[17:50] be another priesthood come upon the
[17:52] Earth all the way back in the days of
[17:54] David we see the we see it when Abraham
[17:57] met MDC that he's predicting he was the
[17:59] king priest of God he was the most high
[18:02] God and he was both King and priest so
[18:04] we're seeing that he was seeing a
[18:06] prediction where God was promising that
[18:08] he himself would be the priesthood of
[18:11] the church and he was showing that he
[18:13] would be able to do this but they had
[18:14] gotten so down in the law and they
[18:17] gotten under the order of the priesthood
[18:19] but now Paul is saying if there was
[18:21] Perfection by the levitical priesthood
[18:24] then why would there have been a promise
[18:26] of another order then why would mecdc be
[18:29] in the scripture if Perfection was by
[18:31] the Levites amen but he was saying so
[18:34] there isn't perfection by this so he
[18:37] says it in Hebrews 7 and 12 for the
[18:39] priesthood being changed there must also
[18:42] a necessity of the law so in other words
[18:45] if we're going to change the priesthood
[18:47] who cannot bring Perfection we must also
[18:50] change the law that was operating under
[18:53] that priesthood so if the priesthood
[18:55] can't bring Perfection the law can't
[18:57] bring Perfection so there's to be a
[18:59] change of both priesthood and what they
[19:01] were instituting amen what is it it's
[19:04] evident there was a change coming both
[19:06] law and priesthood to introduce
[19:08] something that Jesus would be the priest
[19:11] and he would also be the sacrifice isn't
[19:13] that powerful that the that the idea now
[19:16] is that this whole system will be done
[19:18] away and now Jesus will be the high
[19:21] priest amen and the system amen will
[19:24] turn into his sacrifice Amen to
[19:27] substitute all the law for the system of
[19:30] the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen I think
[19:33] it's so powerful when he says in Hebrews
[19:35] 7:13 Paul continues and said of him
[19:39] these things are spoken pertaineth
[19:41] another tribe of no man gave attendance
[19:43] to the altar so he's telling you that
[19:45] that mezc it was Jesus was to Spring out
[19:49] of Judah now according to the scripture
[19:52] that the lawgiver was supposed to the
[19:54] King was supposed to come out of the
[19:56] tribe of Judah right amen amen now he
[19:58] was coming out of Judah so Moses spake
[20:01] nothing of Judah being in the priesthood
[20:04] it was all under Aaron and the Levites
[20:07] because they were the son of the of
[20:09] Aaron and yet it is more evident that
[20:11] after the similitude of mecdc there
[20:14] arises another priest who is made not
[20:17] after the law of carnal commandment but
[20:20] after the power of an endless life now
[20:23] what he's saying is this priesthood now
[20:24] is not issuing from Aaron so see Aaron
[20:28] had a the tribe of lebi and out of him
[20:31] come these priests and what would happen
[20:33] is there would be successions of
[20:34] priesthoods like a a father and that
[20:36] they had a son and then they had a son
[20:38] and they and that would be a succession
[20:40] of priesthood by the tribe that they
[20:43] were living in had nothing to do see God
[20:45] called the whole tribe so they were
[20:47] called into the order of the Levites but
[20:50] here it's saying that Jesus was not
[20:52] going to become a priest by descending
[20:55] out of the tribe of Levi but he would
[20:58] come from the power of an endless life
[21:00] amen it's what Paul is saying he said
[21:02] what kind of man was meanc he said that
[21:04] Abraham would pay tithes unto him and
[21:07] giving the best of the SPs this man had
[21:10] no beginning of days nor ending of life
[21:13] he didn't spring about out of any tribe
[21:16] he didn't spring out of any of the
[21:17] former priest he was coming out of the
[21:20] power of an endless life now amen I tell
[21:23] you he testified th are to priest
[21:24] Forever After the order of MDC now
[21:27] they're very is a disen alling amen of
[21:30] the Commandment going before of the
[21:32] weakness and the unpress now here's the
[21:34] beauty of this he's telling you you you
[21:37] now he's talking to the Hebrews and he's
[21:38] telling them the law that you have is
[21:41] both weak and
[21:42] unprofitable now can you imagine this
[21:45] amen everything they knew and believed
[21:47] was based in this law and now Paul is
[21:50] saying it is weak and unprofitable look
[21:53] what he said for the law made nothing
[21:55] perfect somebody say perfect the law
[21:58] made nothing perfect can I say it better
[22:00] amen it had no effect of perfection it
[22:03] had no power within it to perfect
[22:06] nothing it was it was weak and
[22:08] unprofitable but the bringing of a
[22:11] better hope did which we draw nigh unto
[22:13] God Romans 8 and three Paul explains it
[22:16] for the law could not do in that it was
[22:19] weak through the flesh that's the
[22:21] weakness it was weak through the flesh
[22:24] amen now in Hebrews chap 10 and verse4
[22:26] it tells us this it is not not possible
[22:29] that the blood of goats and bulls and
[22:31] goats should take away sin and can I say
[22:34] it a clearer way amen goats blood is
[22:37] powerless to remove
[22:39] sin the blood of bulls is powerless to
[22:42] remove sin so how could it be profitable
[22:45] if Perfection is the goal How could a
[22:48] blood or a bull amen be strong and
[22:51] profitable if Perfection is the goal
[22:53] amen but it is weak and unprofitable if
[22:56] you want to bring Perfection amen so
[22:58] what we see then Lo amen Jesus said I
[23:01] come in the volume of a book to take
[23:04] away the first and that he might
[23:06] establish the second in Hebrews chapter
[23:09] 2 and in verse 14 this is one of the
[23:11] most beautiful thing brother man uses
[23:13] this scripture over and over and over
[23:16] for by one offering he hath perfected
[23:19] forever them that are Sanctified isn't
[23:23] that powerful Heath perfected now the
[23:25] law was unprofitable and weak
[23:27] imperfection but by one sacrifice he
[23:30] have perfected forever them that are
[23:33] Sanctified see if there's a change of
[23:35] priesthood there has to be a change of
[23:37] law am me and you might say well
[23:39] preacher what do we need with preachers
[23:41] anyhow I think I'm glad you asked me
[23:43] that because see amen the law in the
[23:45] priesthood was unprofitable and weak and
[23:48] bringing Perfection but Paul said God
[23:51] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[23:53] some teachers and he gave some pastors
[23:56] amen and he did it for the purpose to
[23:58] perfect the Saints Hallelujah God's way
[24:03] of perfecting the church will not be
[24:05] through Levi and it will not be through
[24:07] sacrifices but it'll be through the
[24:09] preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[24:12] can you imagine God's way of bringing
[24:15] Perfection to the church would be
[24:17] through an imperfect
[24:19] vessel hallelujah hallelujah for by one
[24:22] offering somebody said brother Wayne
[24:24] heyen how is a preacher going to bring
[24:26] Perfection I'm glad you asked stay with
[24:27] me a little while
[24:29] amen do you see this Levi amen was in
[24:32] the loins of Abraham was he not for
[24:35] generations and the Bible said he got
[24:37] ties because he paid tithes in the loins
[24:40] of Abraham Levi didn't have nothing to
[24:42] do with it folks he was just there in
[24:44] the body of Abraham when he met mecdc
[24:47] right but he also became a levite by
[24:50] that being in that body well let me say
[24:53] something to you we are not the natural
[24:54] Seed of
[24:56] Abraham this this PRI hood or this
[24:59] ministry this bride at the end time was
[25:02] not in the natural uh uh loins of
[25:05] Abraham but we were also there we were
[25:09] in the loins of mdct as a super race a
[25:13] super well then how are we the children
[25:15] of Abraham Jesus was the son of Abraham
[25:18] and we also are the children of Abraham
[25:21] but not of the natural seed we are of
[25:23] the supernatural seed and we were also
[25:27] in the loins of him somebody said how do
[25:29] he get us in the loin of him because the
[25:31] word was in the beginning and he was the
[25:34] word when he met Abraham in the form of
[25:36] mecdc and every member of this bride was
[25:40] in that word when mecdc met Abraham you
[25:43] were there in that body you wasn't in
[25:46] Abraham but you were in God so when God
[25:49] got ready to bring Perfection he brought
[25:52] out of his own oh God out of his own
[25:55] genetics amen he would bring a priest to
[25:58] good now here's the
[26:00] thing if any man is in Christ he's a no
[26:03] a new creature and all things are passed
[26:05] away and all things have become new now
[26:08] all things are of God who have
[26:09] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[26:12] and hath given unto
[26:14] us the ministry yeah of
[26:18] reconciliation to Wi that God was in
[26:21] Christ now who was that in Christ God
[26:25] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[26:27] himself not imputing their trespasses
[26:30] unto them and hath committed unto
[26:34] us the word of
[26:38] reconciliation now he said we had a
[26:40] Ministry of reconciliation now he says
[26:42] we have a word of reconciliation now we
[26:45] are ambassadors for Christ and as though
[26:48] God did beseech You by us we pray you in
[26:50] Christ dead be ye reconciled to God so
[26:54] Paul is telling us that there was a
[26:57] people that had had the word that could
[26:59] put God and man back together again now
[27:02] if you're a studier of translations of
[27:04] scripture you know that William tendell
[27:06] also tendered this or he rendered this
[27:09] this part of the scripture and he was
[27:11] the one that gave us the language of
[27:12] atonement I don't have all the time to
[27:13] go into it but even the word atonement
[27:16] was given to us by William tendale it
[27:17] wasn't an English word until the 1600s
[27:20] and he he didn't have a word that could
[27:22] really explain what atonement went so he
[27:24] took at one mint and put it together and
[27:27] gave you the word atonement which means
[27:30] that you were seated back like you
[27:32] should have been to begin in other words
[27:33] seated back in at one with God it meant
[27:36] you're at one with God atonement and
[27:39] what he's doing is here in the original
[27:42] translation of this when when William
[27:43] tendel translated it he translated it
[27:46] and Heath given us the ministry of the
[27:48] atonement amen amen Paul says the
[27:52] ministry of the word is the ministry of
[27:55] atonement the preaching of the word is
[27:58] the atonement blood of the
[28:01] church do you see amen Romans 1:16 Paul
[28:04] says this I am not ashamed of the Gospel
[28:07] of Jesus Christ he said it is the power
[28:11] of God under salvation yes sir now
[28:14] listen to that amen it is the
[28:16] foolishness of preaching that'll save
[28:19] man amen it won't be educated and polish
[28:22] Scholars it won't be intellectual talks
[28:25] it is the preaching of the Gospel amen
[28:28] that he said I am not ashamed it is the
[28:30] power of God under salvation in Romans
[28:33] 1:17 he said therein is the
[28:35] righteousness of God
[28:38] revealed from Faith unto Faith so watch
[28:42] we're looking as the word Goes Forth
[28:44] that is the Revelation as you hear the
[28:47] word your faith catches the word and
[28:49] salvation comes through the hearing of
[28:52] the word listen amen I I I mean it's a
[28:55] powerful thing to me this morning amen
[28:57] that God has a way of perfecting his
[29:00] church in Luke chapter 4 it was Jesus
[29:03] himself that changes amen even in Luke 4
[29:07] he takes the book of Isaiah and Isaiah
[29:09] had said for he hath anointed me to
[29:12] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[29:15] amen Jesus said the spirit of the Lord
[29:17] is upon me if anointed me to preach the
[29:19] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[29:21] heal the
[29:23] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[29:25] the captive the recovering of sight to
[29:28] the Blind and to set at Liberty them
[29:30] that are bruised to preach the
[29:33] acceptable year of the Lord that's
[29:35] Jubilee I don't want to teach a long
[29:37] time on this y'all remember the law of
[29:39] Jubilee every 50 years they would return
[29:43] back to their possessions it was in
[29:45] Israel Jubilee was announced by a
[29:48] jubilee trumpet sir right they had a
[29:50] Rams Horn and they would they would blow
[29:52] through the Rams Horn so the Rams Horn
[29:54] had none of its own ability whatever
[29:57] bread was put in it was what would be
[30:00] projected now the reason they blew the
[30:02] Ram's Horn at a certain time was because
[30:05] there had been atonement made there's no
[30:07] reason to blow your trumpet unless
[30:09] there's been an atonement and when the
[30:11] sacrifice of Jubilee was made that was
[30:13] how you could return to your possessions
[30:16] because there was a sacrifice for you so
[30:18] the Jubilee trumpet was sounding to the
[30:21] people there's a sacrifice made now
[30:23] maybe you was in other corner of the
[30:25] world other corner of Israel and
[30:27] somebody wanted to keep you as a slave
[30:29] and they hid you back in the back room
[30:30] of the back house amen and they wanted
[30:32] to keep you for the for the purpose of
[30:34] slavery but if you heard the sound of
[30:37] that trumpet you knew you were free to
[30:41] go you didn't see the sacrifice you
[30:44] didn't feel the blood you didn't you
[30:46] didn't see none of the priest but you
[30:48] heard the trumpet tell you the sacrifice
[30:51] is made then Jesus changes that from the
[30:55] Jubilee trumpet being blown to the
[30:58] preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[31:01] he's telling you you're not going to
[31:03] hear a man with a trumpet but you're
[31:05] going to hear men amen preach words and
[31:09] those words are going to have power and
[31:11] it'll be a jubilee under the hearer and
[31:14] a man that hears the word of God has a
[31:16] got a right to return back to everything
[31:19] that they have lost because the gospel
[31:21] has the power to deliver the goat has no
[31:24] power the bull has no power but Jesus J
[31:28] is the high priest of the church and he
[31:30] has the power of endless life his word
[31:33] has power this morning it is the word of
[31:35] his power that delivers the church
[31:37] listen let me say this very clearly
[31:39] there will not be another
[31:41] Calvary there will not be another
[31:44] Calvary there will not be another cross
[31:46] if you're waiting for Calvary to get
[31:48] saved there won't be another there won't
[31:50] be another beating there won't be no
[31:51] more blood shed all the blood that is
[31:54] ever shed has been shed because it was
[31:57] enough let me say this Jesus blood was
[32:00] enough and one time in Calvary was
[32:02] enough that one sacrifice is enough to
[32:06] change every life to change every heart
[32:08] to destroy every disease to save every
[32:11] sinner one trip to Calvary is enough let
[32:16] me say it was enough for the Old
[32:17] Testament and it was enough for the New
[32:19] Testament it was enough for 4,000 years
[32:22] of sin and it's enough for sins that
[32:24] hadn't even been committed yet I didn't
[32:27] don't never get over the power of the
[32:29] Cross to know that he could take away
[32:32] everything from Adam all the way to
[32:34] Jesus and three days he could wrap it
[32:36] all up and fix it all I tell you brother
[32:39] you talk about a fixer upper God can fix
[32:41] it up he can change everything in three
[32:44] days he changed 4,000 years of what the
[32:47] devil did but he didn't just change
[32:49] 4,000 he changed the future of the
[32:52] church he changed levitical law he
[32:54] changed the sacrifice he changed the
[32:56] order and he anointed men of feeble
[32:59] likes to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[33:02] Christ hallelujah hallelujah I say glory
[33:06] be to God the atonement has been made
[33:10] God Amen there won't be another Calvary

[33:15] things are very clear in the message

[33:34] Calvary we don't have to have a
[33:36] crucifixion this morning we just have to

[37:13] Calvary paid the price that the lowest
[37:16] sinner in the world is sat there in this
[37:19] building this morning and under the
[37:21] sound of the Gospel of Jesus Christ they
[37:24] could believe that in their heart and

[40:18] truth somebody said well I wasn't
[40:20] invited you know what's funny there's
[40:21] some of these homes I've never been
[40:23] invited to
[40:28] come on what's good for the goose is
[40:30] good for the
[40:31] gander that's old that's old that's an
[40:34] old saying Goose sauce for the goose is
[40:39] sauce for the
[40:40] gander gu in Pakistan y'all don't know
[40:43] this but we've been translating sermons
[40:44] for a long time some of you don't but
[40:47] this one brother he proofreads a lot he
[40:48] always sending me these little
[40:51] messages and he says the other day he
[40:53] sends me this sauce for the goose sauce
[40:55] for the gander what does this mean
[40:56] Brother LA
[41:01] I said well you know what it means you
[41:02] just don't know the
[41:04] term right sure if you put the if you
[41:09] put the shoe on the other fit on the
[41:10] other foot yeah you might see it from a
[41:13] different
[41:17] angle just saying sir see it's a
[41:20] finished work how we get over there
[41:24] anyhow it's a finished work amen see
[41:28] you're already saved in the kingdom of
[41:30] God but it'll never do you no good till
[41:32] you accept
[41:35] salvation you wasn't saved two years ago
[41:38] or 10 years or 40 right you were saved
[41:41] 2,000 you believe that that's the
[41:44] teaching of the
[41:46] Gospel we base Divine Healing upon the
[41:49] finished work of Calvary and every
[41:52] Redemptive blessing lays there in the
[41:54] Redeemer it's all paid for see see
[41:57] everything God's got is a finished work
[42:01] already everything lays in
[42:04] Jesus well I tell you what this Prophet
[42:06] believed in Jesus isn't it funny how
[42:09] sometimes people misrepresent brother
[42:11] brandom that's something i' something
[42:13] I've noticed is is that people
[42:15] misrepresent what someone believes and
[42:17] tries to make them somebody they're not
[42:20] isn't that odd you if you because if you
[42:22] it's if you get the wrong person talking
[42:24] to you they'll they'll make you try to
[42:26] think somebody believes something they
[42:28] don't even believe or feel some way they
[42:30] don't even feel and and I'm proving it
[42:32] to you right here there's some people
[42:34] don't even really understand William
[42:36] brandom and what he really preached
[42:38] because he's got critics out there
[42:40] trying to turn Hearts from this
[42:44] message right but brother random said
[42:46] Jesus it all Lays in Jesus and what he
[42:49] was trying to do was take the people
[42:52] from denomination to Jesus amen the the
[42:55] the the church work the Gentiles had
[42:58] formed another levitical system of
[43:01] denomination and it don't have the power
[43:03] to forgive it don't have the power to
[43:07] save and look what he's saying it lays
[43:09] in in Jesus and faith is the key that
[43:13] unlocks that door everything you
[43:16] need is behind the door of
[43:19] Jesus he is the payment to everything
[43:22] you need and there is a key that'll
[43:25] unlock that door now watch faith is a
[43:28] finished work unlocks every door every
[43:30] treasure there is inside faith is the
[43:32] key that unlocks every promise and the
[43:35] key the faith is the finished work it's
[43:37] the keys that we're speaking on so what
[43:40] happens you as a heathen now hate to
[43:43] call you heathens but that's who we
[43:45] were in Ephesians we found we didn't
[43:47] even have a chance right but in
[43:50] Galatians three he said scripture
[43:52] foreseeing that God would justify the
[43:55] Heathen through faith even the
[43:57] Scriptures foresaw it what we've seen in
[43:59] Rahab when the two Messengers went to
[44:01] her house what did they do they didn't
[44:03] offer sacrifice they gave her a word and
[44:07] that word turned into a token that saved
[44:09] their whole family showing Rahab was
[44:12] saved by the hearing of the word and so
[44:15] would the Gentiles be saved by the
[44:18] hearing of the word you can't be saved
[44:20] as a Jew you got to be saved as a
[44:22] gentile Believing on the scriptures it's
[44:25] preached unto Abraham see so then we be
[44:28] of Faith or blessed with Abraham in
[44:29] Romans 10 it teaches us that we can't
[44:32] hear without a
[44:34] preacher isn't this amazing Romans 10:13
[44:37] for whoever shall call on the name of
[44:38] the Lord shall be saved and how then
[44:41] shall they call on in him have they not
[44:43] believed and how shall they believe in
[44:45] whom they have not heard and how shall
[44:47] they hear without a
[44:52] preacher isn't this
[44:54] amazing well brother Wayne and I got the
[44:56] Holy Ghost see I don't have to go to
[44:57] church no more cuz I got this teacher in
[45:00] me the spirit's a teacher right isn't
[45:03] that what the Bible said that he would
[45:05] teach you watch how the devil twist
[45:08] scriptures cuz brother Bram said but now
[45:10] notied if you had the Holy Spirit you
[45:12] couldn't wait till the doors are open he
[45:15] said because the Holy Ghost is a teacher
[45:17] he gets in a teacher and
[45:20] teaches wow he gets in a teacher and
[45:23] teaches that's what he does he gets in a
[45:25] preacher and preaches
[45:27] see the scriptures are are clear how
[45:30] they're how they're written is beautiful
[45:32] and how shall they preach except they be
[45:34] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[45:37] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[45:39] to preach and bring Glad Tidings good
[45:41] things I never will forget old brother
[45:43] brother you remember old brother juul
[45:45] forny amen I never will forget I don't
[45:47] know if he done it here in bluon but I
[45:49] seen him do it in the meeting one time
[45:50] he sat down on the platform took his
[45:53] shoes and socks off and put them old
[45:55] ugly feet up and said them
[45:58] pretty well I tell you what I I I
[46:01] guarantee you my wife would disagree
[46:03] with my feet being
[46:04] pretty they some gnarly looking things
[46:07] you
[46:10] know just get it out
[46:15] there but the scripture says they're
[46:19] beautiful but it's not the appearance
[46:22] that he's talking about he's talking
[46:25] about the hearing of the Gospel when the
[46:27] feet of one brings the word of truth
[46:31] it's a beautiful thing when God sends a
[46:34] man among you that will stand with the
[46:36] Gospel of Jesus Christ I say how
[46:39] beautiful are the feet of them that
[46:41] carry good news into the Church of the
[46:43] Living God and what it is written but
[46:46] they have not all believed the gospel of
[46:48] Isaiah sayith the Lord for who ha
[46:51] believed our report then Faith cometh by
[46:55] hearing and hearing hearing by the word
[46:57] of God isn't that amazing hearing the
[47:00] word of God faith comes by hearing
[47:03] hearing the word of God now he's he's
[47:05] telling you something it's not hearing
[47:09] everything it's hearing the word of God
[47:12] so Fox News is not bringing this
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:16] Faith come on y'all you know that
[47:19] they're just as one-sided as the other
[47:22] just a little more on your side
[47:25] maybe right amen but you know that's not
[47:28] bringing Rapture
[47:30] Faith right that's not bringing a true
[47:33] re revelation of discernment of the
[47:35] future events of the world right come on
[47:39] come on Amen you see uh what what we're
[47:41] seeing then is Faith cometh by the
[47:43] hearing and the hearing of the word of
[47:46] God now I know people listen to all
[47:48] kinds of preachers and I you listen to
[47:49] who you want to I guess just bring it
[47:51] back to the word but I'll say this uh
[47:53] somebody sent me some videos some time
[47:55] ago and they said something to this John
[47:56] Jonathan K guy and I think maybe his
[47:59] last name should tell you
[48:01] something uh
[48:03] but he he was the one that preached the
[48:05] blood moons you know back a few years
[48:07] ago somebody asked me said what about
[48:08] these blood moons brother Wayne I said
[48:10] well sounds like he's a good book
[48:14] salesman cuz he's not a good Prophet
[48:17] right now let me say something very
[48:18] clearly if he can't get that Malachi 4
[48:22] is Elijah is William brandham how's he
[48:25] going to tell you what else is going to
[48:26] happen come
[48:28] on see it's not just hearing every
[48:32] voice I felt that one amen it's not
[48:35] hearing every voice listen but it's
[48:37] hearing the word of
[48:39] God do you see when you hear the word
[48:43] watch this amen a minister must preach
[48:45] the
[48:46] word amen and and watch how brother
[48:49] brand would tell us this Faith cometh by
[48:51] hearing now the only thing a minister
[48:53] can do then is by a Divine gift whether
[48:56] it's a gift GI of healing he's to
[48:58] explain the word in such a way that you
[49:01] would believe Christ and then healing
[49:03] takes place when you accept it and
[49:06] believe it in your heart not mentally
[49:09] now an intellectual conception but a
[49:11] heart knowing that God did
[49:14] it now according to brother brandham in
[49:17] Fellowship by Redemption as you must
[49:19] recognize the blood is an inst
[49:20] substitute through the preaching of the
[49:22] word it will bring down the veil of
[49:25] blood
[49:27] isn't that wonderful it'll bring down
[49:29] the blood veil in other words the
[49:31] atoning power is in the preaching of the
[49:34] word right the gospel Trumpet of the
[49:37] Lord is what sounds over our life it's
[49:40] how you hear from God it's how you're
[49:43] delivered from disease it's how you're
[49:45] delivered in your life it's by the
[49:47] preaching of the word you know the
[49:49] prophet actually says that when a
[49:50] minister walks into a Congregation of
[49:53] people and the anointing of the spirit
[49:56] you are are bound to hear from
[49:59] Heaven my goodness you can hear from
[50:02] heaven when a man walks in the walks in
[50:04] the plate like this morning that sweet
[50:06] anointing and a man walks in there and
[50:09] begins to preach you can begin to hear
[50:11] from heaven now people say I want to
[50:13] hear from God well let me let me give
[50:15] you something brother BR says here he
[50:17] said listen in what is a vision he says
[50:19] the greatest and the highest form there
[50:21] is for God to give a message to the
[50:24] people is for the people to believe his
[50:26] word word the highest form is preaching
[50:30] the
[50:31] gospel the highest
[50:34] form there is no higher form to hear
[50:37] from God than to hear a gospel preacher
[50:41] isn't that powerful this why I need a
[50:43] gift I need somebody to say something
[50:45] over my life listen the highest form you
[50:48] can get is the gospel being preached
[50:50] over your life listen when you come to
[50:52] church and you lay aside all your
[50:54] indifferences and all your feelings and
[50:56] I know how it is I mean I've I've been
[50:58] in church for years we get little things
[51:00] Weighing on us and this idea and this
[51:01] idea and this idea but see that's the
[51:04] thing is as you come to the church you
[51:06] begin to lay all of that aside and then
[51:08] you begin to ask the Lord God I got this
[51:11] need and I got this need and I got this
[51:13] need and Lord amen I'm praying that
[51:15] you'll use the gift in the pull pit Lord
[51:18] that your word will come across my
[51:20] situation and it begins to discern and
[51:22] then the Holy Spirit begins to use a
[51:24] preacher and when the preacher begins to
[51:27] preach you start hearing from heaven but
[51:29] it's up to you to acknowledge it when it
[51:32] happens come on Church Amen brother
[51:35] Carrie in my line amen just the other
[51:37] day you was praying and asking for
[51:39] something I didn't even know I didn't
[51:40] know the discussions I didn't I no idea
[51:43] at all and the Holy Spirit had me leave
[51:45] a context and give a whole little thing
[51:47] that some people probably wondered
[51:49] what's he talking about amen but God was
[51:51] directly answering a question somebody
[51:54] asked and I had no idea who was for what
[51:57] it was about but God uses a gift to use
[52:00] his word to meet the need of the people
[52:03] many of you know I'm telling you the
[52:05] truth you've come right in here and
[52:07] you've sat down and you've been wanting
[52:08] certain certain thing and Desiring all
[52:10] of a sudden Brother Ray be preaching
[52:12] brother Nathan be sitting there and
[52:14] certain word said and all of a sudden
[52:15] Nathan hears it you're going to have a
[52:17] son amen all of a sudden the highest
[52:20] form was the word being preached to him
[52:23] listen when it's the word it is the
[52:25] purest form form God has to deal with
[52:28] his
[52:29] church Hallelujah the highest form there
[52:32] is and the problem with is is it's
[52:36] men amen God uses men God could have
[52:39] used the sun to preach he could have
[52:41] used the wind to preach and wouldn't it
[52:43] been beautiful if he had a because he
[52:46] the son never failed you the son never
[52:48] made a mistake the son never had a bad
[52:51] attitude come on Church y'all know I I
[52:54] mean we might as well just be human
[52:56] right amen you you never bumped up
[52:58] against the
[53:00] sun it's so far from you amen and how
[53:03] easy would it be to believe something
[53:05] that came from that but God chose man
[53:08] with his imp peculiarities with his
[53:11] troubles with his with his
[53:14] weaknesses but God chose man to preach
[53:17] the gospel God's choice is man to preach
[53:21] the gospel God's highest form is the
[53:24] preaching of the Gospel God's perfection
[53:26] it's the preaching of the Gospel the
[53:28] Holy Spirit brother B said fell on man
[53:31] and man is God's
[53:33] agent and the hardest thing God has ever
[53:36] done is to get one mortal to believe
[53:38] another
[53:40] yeah woo brother Glory now listen I I I
[53:45] recognize this that it has to be a Gods
[53:48] sent
[53:49] man and the prophet says it he said God
[53:51] called me to preach the gospel and that
[53:53] is my credentials a God sent man can
[53:56] stand alone on the same grounds the
[53:58] church don't send you God sent man amen
[54:02] so when God sends a man he's a Gods sent
[54:05] man a man that God sins will have an
[54:10] absolute amen a man that God sins won't
[54:14] be Wishy wory and flip floppy on the
[54:17] word of
[54:18] God he won't do
[54:20] it amen and sometimes it may come to a
[54:23] struggle but if God sends a man he sends
[54:26] him to hold the messiahship of Christ
[54:29] straight in the church direct quote if
[54:31] God sends him he holds the messiahship
[54:34] straight now watch the Messiah ship it's
[54:35] the word sir so he holds the word over
[54:38] the church and brother man said what we
[54:40] need in our church is a man that's God
[54:42] an
[54:43] absolute what we need in the Methodist
[54:46] Church in the Baptist in the Pentecostal
[54:48] in the Presbyterian Church is an
[54:50] absolute a man of God that will stand
[54:53] tied to the word and to Christ and bring
[54:55] that congregation
[54:56] under the condition of where each member
[54:59] walks in the condition of the word
[55:02] brother brother isn't that powerful
[55:04] that's what we need men with
[55:06] absolutes yeah amen men who know what
[55:09] they're talking
[55:10] [Music]
[55:12] about we're not here this morning uh
[55:15] trying to figure out whether the message
[55:17] is right or
[55:19] not C can you imagine the confusion of
[55:22] that people still guessing whether Bron
[55:25] R had it right or he had had it wrong or
[55:27] the cloud what does it mean and what it
[55:29] don't mean and can you imagine trying to
[55:31] feed your faith from that kind of
[55:36] voice but the voice must know what it's
[55:39] talking about now the prophet says this
[55:42] in Acts the 6th chapter when stepen went
[55:44] and preached see he me we're just now
[55:47] instituting the gospel and stepen is
[55:49] preaching acts 15 and he the Bible said
[55:51] and they looked steadfastly on him and
[55:54] saw his face and said he see been the
[55:57] face of an angel now that's powerful
[56:00] because brother Bram goes on to explain
[56:02] that his face wasn't an angel's face he
[56:04] said what it was is he was so sure of
[56:07] what he was talking about he so knew
[56:09] what he was talking about that he said
[56:12] there it was it shined on him like he
[56:15] had the face of an Angel he was
[56:17] steadfast amen look at this he was shine
[56:19] like an angel amen maybe a light on his
[56:22] face or something an angel don't have a
[56:23] light on him but an angel is a messenger
[56:26] and a messenger is one who knows what
[56:29] he's talking
[56:32] about I tell you what's powerful you
[56:35] know when old Steven standing there and
[56:36] he's getting stoned it's amazing what he
[56:38] done is he looks up into heaven and
[56:40] brother I tell you what it's a blessing
[56:41] when he looks up there and he said I see
[56:43] the heavens opened yes sir I tell you
[56:45] what he knew of the power of the work of
[56:48] the Ascension of Jesus Christ a few days
[56:50] later he didn't look up there and I see
[56:52] the heavens closed and everything's amen
[56:54] he said I see the heavens opened up and
[56:56] I see Jesus at the right hand what he
[56:59] did he saw and opened heaven and he knew
[57:02] what he was talking about he knew there
[57:03] was no devil could keep him out of the
[57:06] presence of God he knew the blood had
[57:08] took care of the problems he knew what
[57:11] he was preaching was the truth isn't it
[57:14] something a man had a face like an angel
[57:16] like that now in questions and answers
[57:18] brother bam says it like this the inside
[57:20] of you is a supernatural the outside of
[57:22] you is physical and if you are
[57:24] spirit-led by God you became a messenger
[57:26] of God or an angel God's messenger God's
[57:30] angel the same word and which is the
[57:33] greatest Authority an angel from heaven
[57:37] or an angel at the pull
[57:40] pit it's the angel at the pull pit Paul
[57:44] said so yes sir if an angel comes from
[57:47] heaven and preaches another gospel then
[57:49] what I've already preached let him be a
[57:50] curs so the angel Anointed with the holy
[57:53] spirit with the word stands next to
[57:57] God Amen Hallelujah I say Lord let me
[58:01] stand with your word when a man stands
[58:05] with the word he becomes an angel of God
[58:08] and stands next to God isn't that
[58:11] powerful Church no wonder the scripture
[58:13] says how beautiful are the feet of them
[58:16] that carry Good Tidings that bring the
[58:19] gospel because there's not a hire for to
[58:21] hear from
[58:23] God hallelujah amen
[58:27] you say
[58:29] well amen well if an angel was preaching
[58:32] I'd believe him brother bam says but God
[58:35] didn't ordain the
[58:37] angel amen he ordained men to preach the
[58:42] gospel the gospel comes by the preaching
[58:44] of the word god manifests himself
[58:47] through human beings let me give you a
[58:49] real quick example when philli was there
[58:51] in the Revival and the Holy Spirit led
[58:54] him to one man out in the wilderness
[58:56] and this great uh Ethiopian unic came
[58:59] was a great man and he was reading the
[59:00] book of Isaiah and when Philip went to
[59:03] him amen remember he said what readest
[59:06] thou the man said well I'm reading the
[59:07] prophets but I don't know who he's
[59:09] talking about here and he said is it
[59:11] himself or of another and then Philip
[59:13] begin to preach Jesus unto him and when
[59:16] he be to preach Jesus unto him amen The
[59:18] Man by faith understood now Calvary
[59:21] ain't even close to where they are he's
[59:24] out there in the desert reading words
[59:26] by a puddle of water he's a long ways
[59:29] from salvation through that other way
[59:32] right but now because of the hearing of
[59:36] the Gospel amen the man's heart is
[59:38] quickened he looks over and says what
[59:39] hindereth me to go get in this water
[59:42] right now amen what was it it was the
[59:44] angel of God that directed Phillip but
[59:47] Angels couldn't preach it Phillip had to
[59:49] do it isn't that something amen I
[59:52] appreciate our preachers I appreciate
[59:53] God anointing men and sending them out
[59:56] amen I'm glad this morning I'm not out
[59:58] I'm glad I'm
[1:00:00] here I told Brother Ray I was driving
[1:00:02] down the interstate this morning I'm
[1:00:04] glad I'm right here this morning not in
[1:00:06] Oklahoma and got a 15-hour drive home
[1:00:08] and I'm glad to be here preaching to
[1:00:10] Brother Richard and brother Carrie and
[1:00:12] I'm glad brother darl we're here
[1:00:14] preaching and we're able to share with
[1:00:16] you amen you all know what I'm talking
[1:00:17] about I'm all among friends and you love
[1:00:20] me I didn't have to travel amen but
[1:00:22] there's people this morning doing all
[1:00:23] these things there's men traveling like
[1:00:26] brother brother Alex here traveling and
[1:00:28] going other places and and thank you all
[1:00:30] for your help and support for him but
[1:00:32] he's going other places and traveling I
[1:00:33] brother Steven spent a couple weeks over
[1:00:35] here these men of God and Nathan and
[1:00:37] Ronnie they're going overseas and all
[1:00:39] the different traveling that's happening
[1:00:41] amen these men are carrying to God
[1:00:43] they're not just filling up their days
[1:00:45] they're not just emptied lives and
[1:00:47] without heading and just just laced in
[1:00:49] their lives amen they're carrying the
[1:00:52] Gospel of Jesus Christ and an angel came
[1:00:56] go do it but they got to do it in the
[1:00:58] weariness of their body and the
[1:01:00] weariness of their homes and and they
[1:01:02] give their lives for these things
[1:01:04] because they're worthy of giving your
[1:01:05] life for Hallelujah I thank God for our
[1:01:09] preachers I thank God for brother
[1:01:11] Ericson a pastor Among Us who's give his
[1:01:13] life for this message many of you
[1:01:15] wouldn't be sitting here this morning if
[1:01:17] God hadn't to called this man to the
[1:01:19] ministry I wouldn't be on Ohio this
[1:01:22] morning if God hadn't to called this man
[1:01:24] to the ministry I meant don't y'all just
[1:01:26] give them a round of applause this
[1:01:27] morning I think they're worthy of
[1:01:33] it say preacher you lifted up men no I'm
[1:01:36] lifting up the God that sent a gift into
[1:01:39] this age and Men surrendered their lives
[1:01:41] to these gifts and they gave their life
[1:01:44] because the angel couldn't preach it God
[1:01:46] had to get a man to do it so they said
[1:01:49] well won you display a tape then brother
[1:01:51] Ram said an angel didn't do it and he
[1:01:53] said nor did God ordain a Machinery or a
[1:01:57] mechanical device to do
[1:02:00] it he did not ordain Mechanical Devices
[1:02:04] listen let me say it would be real easy
[1:02:06] when we got ready to we're getting there
[1:02:09] in Ephesians 5 so if you girls now y'all
[1:02:11] clean up all you guys clean up we get to
[1:02:12] Ephesian 5 it's going to get a little
[1:02:14] rough okay so don't take it personal but
[1:02:16] when we start preaching about hair and
[1:02:18] makeup and nose rings and earrings and
[1:02:22] amen and all the nonsense the boys are
[1:02:24] pulling in Fashions and stuff when you
[1:02:26] get there amen now it would be easy to
[1:02:28] push the play on the tape and sit back
[1:02:31] here and let brother Ram take all the
[1:02:33] heat as if it's all on him right amen
[1:02:37] but I think it takes a coward that won't
[1:02:39] stand with the message of the hour and
[1:02:42] preach it like it's his own conviction
[1:02:44] these convictions of William brandom
[1:02:46] they're not just brother brandom's
[1:02:47] opinion it's the word of God and I
[1:02:50] believe we ought to preach the message
[1:02:52] of the hour with strength and conviction
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:58] amen it's not listen it's not and
[1:03:00] somebody said well brother Wayne AR play
[1:03:01] tapes I play tapes every day in my life
[1:03:04] I play tapes all the time pise but God
[1:03:07] didn't ordain a tape to preach this
[1:03:09] message he ordained men to carry this
[1:03:12] message amen what did God do God put on
[1:03:15] a dress wear y'all know what God's dress
[1:03:17] Weare is brother B said it's the offices
[1:03:19] of the church is God's dress wear he
[1:03:21] said of Apostles and Prophets and he
[1:03:23] said Satan never gets to it see what it
[1:03:26] is God dressed up in his church these
[1:03:29] offices in God is his dress wear when
[1:03:32] you see those offices a pastor and
[1:03:35] teacher and evangelist what is it that's
[1:03:37] God's
[1:03:39] dresswear God's
[1:03:41] presence God's spirit working in a human
[1:03:46] being
[1:03:48] W that's pretty hard to imagine ain't it
[1:03:52] God unzipped a body I just I get off me
[1:03:56] let's use Brother Ray God unzipped a
[1:03:59] body and stepped into
[1:04:02] it and showed up at
[1:04:05] church somebody said well I don't like
[1:04:08] this and I don't like that God's
[1:04:12] office you see that it's God's office
[1:04:15] it's not it's not for man it's God's
[1:04:18] office amen now now it's a dress wear
[1:04:20] that God puts on so I know you're seeing
[1:04:23] the man but can you see the
[1:04:27] God can you see the office of it do you
[1:04:30] see what it is see many people so and
[1:04:32] and years ago it's pretty funny when I I
[1:04:35] was just just a young preacher when the
[1:04:37] anointing first started getting a hold
[1:04:38] of us and all these preachers know that
[1:04:40] when you when you get under inspiration
[1:04:42] that's preaching and then sometimes you
[1:04:44] do a little bit of teaching or something
[1:04:46] and you're reading it's more
[1:04:46] intellectual side but when the
[1:04:48] inspiration really picks things up and
[1:04:50] puts it together and it's it's more
[1:04:52] preaching and and I remember when that
[1:04:53] anointing first started hitting me Jaden
[1:04:56] it was cuz I went from a prayer closet
[1:04:58] and I learned in the prayer closet that
[1:04:59] if I just let go these words would come
[1:05:03] and this feeling would come and I wasn't
[1:05:04] trying to sort it all out I was just
[1:05:06] letting it flow and I learned that the
[1:05:09] more I let it flow the higher I got and
[1:05:12] and and then all of the sudden when I
[1:05:14] started preaching first first sermon I
[1:05:16] preached brother Nick I tried just to I
[1:05:18] tried just stay with the notes you know
[1:05:20] and I found out that God didn't want me
[1:05:22] in the
[1:05:23] notes he wanted me in the
[1:05:26] inspiration so when I started preaching
[1:05:28] like I was
[1:05:30] praying then I found something happen
[1:05:32] and all of a sudden while I was
[1:05:33] preaching I'd say things and I'd think
[1:05:35] man that was good where' that come from
[1:05:38] yes sir and I would I mean I didn't
[1:05:40] forth think some of that but it was
[1:05:43] stuff IID studied but I hadn't put
[1:05:45] together yet I right here it true word
[1:05:47] years ago I was coming in at that time
[1:05:50] as an evangelist and brother R had me
[1:05:51] and I never will forget this I was
[1:05:53] preaching right along and I was
[1:05:55] preaching about when when hady R looked
[1:05:57] at brother brandham and he said ask what
[1:05:58] you will now I'd studied that a lot but
[1:06:01] I'd never thought about this but what
[1:06:03] she said was what was in her mouth and
[1:06:05] it came that moment in inspiration and I
[1:06:08] seen it had she been feeding on Billy
[1:06:11] Graham that's what she would have been
[1:06:13] saying had she been listening to oral
[1:06:15] Robert she said have said brother way
[1:06:17] brother brother Bram give me the million
[1:06:18] dollars cuz they believed money was the
[1:06:20] Revival but because she had been feeding
[1:06:23] from a prophetic message
[1:06:26] she believed in the creation of the word
[1:06:29] and she just but that come just in a
[1:06:32] moment and somebody come out to you and
[1:06:33] they'll say boy I really enjoyed that
[1:06:35] now it's okay you can tell me that
[1:06:37] because I enjoyed to hear it and uh
[1:06:39] somebody said one time to brother Brown
[1:06:41] they said I don't know how you let them
[1:06:42] people compliment your sermon he said
[1:06:44] they compliment me I don't take it
[1:06:45] brother BR said there's only one me
[1:06:47] difference between me and that guy he I
[1:06:48] tell the
[1:06:52] truth now
[1:06:55] but I remember early on brother
[1:06:57] Christopher I'd try to explain to people
[1:06:59] I'd say well it really wasn't me see I I
[1:07:01] just and then one day I heard myself I
[1:07:03] could just hear myself and I thought wow
[1:07:05] that sounds
[1:07:07] horrible so from then on somebody said
[1:07:10] something I just said well thank
[1:07:13] you well I know and God knows that it
[1:07:15] wasn't me but thank you it's kind of
[1:07:18] like one time well I guess we're on them
[1:07:20] one time days here it's kind kind of
[1:07:22] like one time you know brother Shawn
[1:07:24] Martin yeah he's a good singer yes sir
[1:07:26] and and I I I just I've never been to a
[1:07:29] meeting yet where they said brother
[1:07:31] Wayne's in the house would you come sing
[1:07:32] a
[1:07:36] special it ain't happened yet but we was
[1:07:39] over there in the meetings in July and
[1:07:41] brother shw berries and man Sean got up
[1:07:42] and sang he sang the house down you know
[1:07:45] and after the service old boy walked
[1:07:46] right up to me he said boy I enjoyed
[1:07:49] that special I knew what he thought he
[1:07:51] said I enjoyed that special I said thank
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:54] [Applause]
[1:07:56] I knew and God knew I didn't
[1:07:59] sing
[1:08:02] see well see but here's the thing your
[1:08:06] pastor has never preached a
[1:08:08] message brother BR said the holy spirit
[1:08:11] is speaking through mortal lips I
[1:08:13] believe these ministers he said behind
[1:08:15] me I'll say in front of me Brethren you
[1:08:17] never preached a sermon in your life the
[1:08:19] Holy Spirit preached through you a
[1:08:21] sermon that's right we don't preach the
[1:08:23] Holy Spirit does the speaking
[1:08:26] we might write out something and read it
[1:08:27] but that ain't preaching preaching is
[1:08:29] when inspiration comes and preaching is
[1:08:32] inspiration by the holy spirit that
[1:08:34] gives an unction and we can read
[1:08:36] something and it just don't matter but
[1:08:37] when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of it
[1:08:40] and takes a hold of the people and
[1:08:42] something gets a hold it's the Holy
[1:08:44] Spirit that's not your pastor preaching
[1:08:47] that's the Holy Spirit preaching the
[1:08:49] pastor is out of it he's just giving you
[1:08:52] the message I tell you this morning I
[1:08:55] believe God has transmitters on the
[1:08:57] earth that he can transmit his voice
[1:09:00] from the heavens through a human being
[1:09:02] into the Earth it's his highest form
[1:09:05] there is to bring a message to the
[1:09:07] people is the preaching of the word of
[1:09:09] God Amen I'll tell you this brother man
[1:09:11] said we are only transmitters that
[1:09:14] transmit a voice through our agency
[1:09:17] that's right he said whether it's
[1:09:18] preaching the gospel by lip or seeing a
[1:09:21] vision by eye or laying hands whatever
[1:09:24] it is it's Christ working through his
[1:09:27] office oh my goodness somebody said
[1:09:30] brother Wayne I don't know about these
[1:09:32] men preaching brother Bram said that's
[1:09:33] the reason all preaching and teaching is
[1:09:35] it is in preaching and teaching of the
[1:09:38] word that sheep hear the voice of
[1:09:41] [Applause]
[1:09:42] God he these are powerful these are
[1:09:45] powerful that's how they hear the voice
[1:09:47] of God now could you God could have
[1:09:51] chose to preach the gospel by the Sun
[1:09:52] Moon by the Stars wind nature he chose
[1:09:55] me to preach the gospel that's where the
[1:09:58] voice of God will come
[1:10:01] from
[1:10:02] amen that's where the voice of God will
[1:10:07] come from it's preacher the voice of
[1:10:11] God in Preachers the prophet of God said
[1:10:15] they will be a final voice yeah under
[1:10:18] their messenger they will be a final
[1:10:21] voice to the final Age The Prophet said
[1:10:23] in the church age book that voice
[1:10:25] is in the bride brother Brandon will the
[1:10:29] bride have a Ministry yes she will
[1:10:33] that's what's going on now teachers and
[1:10:35] preachers and apostles and evangelists
[1:10:37] amen and pastors amen what is it she's
[1:10:39] got a Ministry it's the ministry of the
[1:10:41] hour amen should what should they be
[1:10:43] preaching brother B said they're
[1:10:45] messengers of this same message yes amen
[1:10:49] now brother Prophet prophet of God is
[1:10:51] just saying some very powerful things
[1:10:52] here that these men are concentrating
[1:10:55] channels where God can
[1:10:58] speak so brother Wayne I want to get I
[1:11:00] want to get under the anointing brother
[1:11:02] BR says it like this the word goes out
[1:11:04] the Holy Spirit follows the word the
[1:11:07] word's preached you see your pastor
[1:11:10] preach and the first thing you
[1:11:14] know across the building starts going
[1:11:17] the Holy Ghost it's the conductor of
[1:11:20] that word and the word conductor is
[1:11:22] because the word is preached and the
[1:11:24] spirit follows it we're wherever it goes
[1:11:26] that Spirit follows that word oh I like
[1:11:29] that Bible teaching and Bible holy ghost
[1:11:30] coming back and confirming that teaching
[1:11:33] it is the apostolic way God has for the
[1:11:36] church God has instituted today an
[1:11:40] Apostolic way for the Church of the
[1:11:42] Living God and he has not changed his
[1:11:45] way now I I don't mean it as a rebuke to
[1:11:48] any congregation or any people but God
[1:11:51] has not changed his way I know today
[1:11:54] that men have tried to move the gifts of
[1:11:57] the offices of God out of the church but
[1:12:00] God put them
[1:12:02] in and God never took him out and any
[1:12:06] man that tries never saw why God put him
[1:12:09] in it is the way the blood comes to the
[1:12:13] church through the preaching of the
[1:12:16] message of the hour when man begins to
[1:12:18] preach the word the anointing comes in
[1:12:20] the building and you begin to believe
[1:12:23] the word then the atoning blessing of
[1:12:25] Calvary start blowing over your over
[1:12:28] your home over your family over your
[1:12:30] life why is it that the devil so after
[1:12:32] preachers why is it so after the church
[1:12:35] why is he so after the assemblies in the
[1:12:37] last day because that devil knows that
[1:12:40] devil knows he's trying to get the
[1:12:42] people in a place of Separation away
[1:12:44] from the word of God where he can fill
[1:12:46] their mind with every evil thing he can
[1:12:49] destroy your youth he can destroy your
[1:12:51] young people but I'll tell you this
[1:12:53] today I don't believe that tww
[1:12:55] is going to stand by and let no devil
[1:12:58] destroy the works of God in the last day
[1:13:01] but God put us here to hold a light in
[1:13:05] this generation to say God still works
[1:13:08] miracles God still moves in the Church
[1:13:11] of the Living God God still follows his
[1:13:15] sign still follows this message I
[1:13:18] believe in the preaching of the word of
[1:13:19] God I believe that's how you get saved I
[1:13:22] believe them that hear the word they
[1:13:24] believe the word word they confess the
[1:13:26] word and that's how they get saved I
[1:13:28] believe that's how they get
[1:13:32] healed so brother
[1:13:34] Wayne I believe with all my heart that
[1:13:38] God works in and through his
[1:13:43] bride maybe you got up this morning said
[1:13:45] God I need to hear a word from you and
[1:13:47] then you come to the house of God right
[1:13:50] that gift starts
[1:13:52] moving and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:13:54] Spirit start
[1:13:55] dealing with your
[1:13:57] life you always got to be real careful
[1:14:00] when you're hearing a preacher because
[1:14:01] he's preaching to a lot of congregation
[1:14:04] a lot of different
[1:14:06] things so sometimes he addresses maybe
[1:14:08] one little Spirit or something like that
[1:14:10] what it is is you you have to trust that
[1:14:14] the Holy Spirit knows
[1:14:17] how to break a little something so
[1:14:20] something can
[1:14:22] move amen and as the Holy Spirit begins
[1:14:24] to move begins to change things so as
[1:14:26] you're hearing the word this morning
[1:14:28] this is God's
[1:14:30] office this is God's way yeah this is
[1:14:34] God's
[1:14:35] gifts and there's not a higher
[1:14:40] form than the preaching of the
[1:14:43] Gospel amen one of our musicians come
[1:14:46] this morning praise the Lord let me
[1:14:49] assure you brother there may be a lot of
[1:14:52] mockery and I don't say there isn't I'm
[1:14:55] just a man I'm not a judge I'm to preach
[1:15:00] but there is a genuine Holy Spirit right
[1:15:04] sir and a genuine Apostolic power of
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:09] Spirit the age of apostolic hasn't
[1:15:12] changed God's way is still the same way
[1:15:17] that it was the day he left the Earth
[1:15:21] and said go ye under the world and
[1:15:24] preach the gospel
[1:15:28] go ye onto the
[1:15:29] world and preach the
[1:15:33] gospel and them that
[1:15:35] believe shall be saved how'd you get
[1:15:41] saved how'd you get your life saved
[1:15:43] how'd you get your heart the same way
[1:15:46] God Saves you is the same way he deals
[1:15:49] with you
[1:15:50] sir and as God begins to move you in
[1:15:53] life
[1:15:56] it's it's reason it's important it's
[1:15:59] important to get yourself in a good
[1:16:01] church it's
[1:16:04] important it's important to get yourself
[1:16:06] under a Ministry that you believe God
[1:16:10] sent that has an absolute yeah that
[1:16:13] preaches the message of this hour amen
[1:16:16] it's important amen sometimes older
[1:16:19] people they'll say well you know brother
[1:16:20] Wayne I'm doing all right I'm not going
[1:16:22] to have a problem but it's them young
[1:16:23] people behind you
[1:16:27] I seen a situation years ago it's a bit
[1:16:31] of a tragedy I seen a situation in a
[1:16:33] church where there was some fusses
[1:16:35] started up and and uh the minister was
[1:16:39] uh he was he was he was a little bit of
[1:16:41] a different
[1:16:42] fellow and he he he had set out to prove
[1:16:46] some things and he got got his Spirit
[1:16:48] pretty
[1:16:49] bitter and some of the people asked me
[1:16:51] and I said well it looks like y'all
[1:16:52] doing a lot of fighting these days you
[1:16:54] know
[1:16:56] I said here's the thing y'all going to
[1:16:58] make it you'll be
[1:17:00] okay but it's your
[1:17:04] children that's where you're going to
[1:17:07] suffer now it took about 10 years for
[1:17:10] them to see what I
[1:17:11] saw but I seen it 10 years before it
[1:17:16] happen because it's where the it's where
[1:17:18] the reaping comes is behind it
[1:17:25] it's important to get in a good
[1:17:28] church get your family
[1:17:30] settled let the Holy Spirit deal with
[1:17:32] their
[1:17:34] hearts there are people today that
[1:17:37] believe that they can just sit home and
[1:17:39] listen to a
[1:17:40] tape and it's the same as now if you
[1:17:43] would hear what's on that
[1:17:46] tape brother Bram said you say I can
[1:17:48] stay home from the church and it'll be
[1:17:50] all right he said no you won't be all
[1:17:53] right amen
[1:17:55] yeah now that's and you got to be real
[1:17:58] careful because this ain't legal this
[1:17:59] ain't like we're going to keep a roll of
[1:18:01] people that show up to church and wrong
[1:18:04] Church wrong preacher some of you
[1:18:07] probably wonder if anybody even cares
[1:18:08] cuz sometimes you miss church nobody
[1:18:10] calls you or nothing it ain't that we
[1:18:12] don't care we just most of us have been
[1:18:15] under some pretty dogmatic people and
[1:18:17] we're just a little bit like enjoy your
[1:18:21] life and we'll see you at the house of
[1:18:22] God

[1:18:56] this system to flow through my family I
[1:18:59] want to teach my system to I want to
[1:19:01] teach God's system to my children I

[1:19:09] them to go to church we were
[1:19:12] sick well I better not get into
[1:19:16] that boy I'm almost finished and I'm
[1:19:19] going to get in trouble right on the end
[1:19:20] saying something Ben
[1:19:28] prise the
[1:19:30] Lord yall know that you went a little
[1:19:32] far on
[1:19:34] that coed did that to
[1:19:37] you see coed is a spirit of
[1:19:41] division and it was brought in at a time
[1:19:44] of a presidential
[1:19:46] election and they politically use that
[1:19:49] to divide homes
[1:19:52] churches families and they did it for a
[1:19:56] purpose now that has a residue that's
[1:19:58] been left
[1:19:59] over and that residue is somebody some
[1:20:03] well they I think they're the ones that
[1:20:04] made us all
[1:20:07] sick well I think it was
[1:20:14] them I'm going to keep everybody out of
[1:20:16] trouble I'll quote to you what CDC says
[1:20:19] it says if somebody's
[1:20:21] sick and you're running a fever that you
[1:20:23] should wait about what 24 hours that's
[1:20:27] CDC yeah yeah without without aspirin or
[1:20:32] ibuprofen you're not running a fever and
[1:20:34] then 24 hours later they say you're safe
[1:20:37] that you're not spreading but you know
