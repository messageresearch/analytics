[5:58] Christ we pray
[6:00] amen and amen and amen if you have your
[6:03] Bibles this morning we want to go into
[6:05] the word of the Lord amen we want to uh
[6:08] just take a few minutes in the scripture
[6:10] in the Book of Daniel again um I was
[6:13] going to be just continuing on through
[6:15] but I I'm not sure um how we're going to
[6:19] continue forward but just uh this
[6:21] morning it just I I just not able to
[6:23] leave this portion of the Scripture it
[6:24] just keeps speaking to me so I want to
[6:27] uh move back into Daniel chapter 3
[6:30] uh the 14th verse down to the 18th verse
[6:33] we read the entire chapter uh on
[6:36] Thursday night so amen if you didn't get
[6:38] nothing out of church you got a whole
[6:39] chapter of the Bible to take home with
[6:41] you amen it's it's always a blessing
[6:44] amen and Daniel chapter 3 and verse 14
[6:46] to verse 18 now Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[6:49] said unto them is it true oh Shadrach
[6:52] Meshach and
[6:53] abedo do not ye serve my gods nor
[6:57] worship the golden image which I have
[6:58] set up
[7:00] now if you be ready that at what time
[7:03] you hear the sound of the cornet and the
[7:05] flute and the heart and the sack putut
[7:06] and the Sury and the dlim and all kinds
[7:08] of music You Fall Down and Worship the
[7:11] image which I have made well but if you
[7:15] worship not you shall be cast in the
[7:17] same hour into the midst of a burning
[7:19] fiery furnace and who is that God that
[7:23] shall deliver you out of my hands my
[7:27] what a question who is that God
[7:30] that shall deliver you out of my hands
[7:33] well for sure it wasn't the one he made
[7:36] amen this was a this was a God he didn't
[7:38] understand Shadrach Meshach and
[7:41] abedo and I just love this verse
[7:45] answered and said to the king old
[7:47] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[7:50] answer thee in this matter if it be so
[7:55] our God whom we serve is able to Deliver
[7:58] Us from this Burning fiery furnace and
[8:01] he will deliver us out of thine hand O
[8:03] King but if not be it known unto thee Oh
[8:07] King that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[8:13] worship the golden image which thou has
[8:16] set up God bless the reading of his
[8:18] words you could be seated this
[8:21] evening amen I I I want to speak to you
[8:24] a little bit further from this Daniel
[8:25] the third chapter and if I'm going to
[8:27] maybe uh uh speak to you a little bit
[8:29] from here I want to talk to you about
[8:30] the vision that transcends the
[8:33] condition and when I'm looking at this
[8:36] uh scripture here I guess uh it would be
[8:40] U it would be one of those situations
[8:42] where I believe that any of us could
[8:44] stand at the gates of a furnace this
[8:46] morning and we could put a number of
[8:49] situations uh instead of the Gate of a
[8:51] fiery furnace I I'm assuming there's a
[8:54] trial of every kind facing individuals
[8:57] this morning being uh that this this
[8:59] season that we are living in is a great
[9:01] type in that the scripture says uh that
[9:05] that Nebuchadnezzar heeded that furnace
[9:07] seven times hotter than any other time
[9:10] of course we know it's a reflection of
[9:12] the leysan age when if you look in the
[9:14] scripture the Bible talks about the
[9:16] enemy coming uh throughout the
[9:18] scriptures talks about the attack of the
[9:20] enemy but there is an actual compiling
[9:23] of spirits in the last age where as a
[9:26] prophet would say it like this he said
[9:27] where all the guns of hell has been
[9:29] trained upon the bride and and uh and
[9:32] there there's a pressure and I I don't
[9:34] have to preach to you on pressure
[9:36] because every one of you sitting here
[9:37] this morning understand the pressures of
[9:40] the ages that we we're that we're living
[9:42] in and the time and how that even the
[9:45] season that we live reflects this entire
[9:47] picture Amen in that everything around
[9:50] you is constantly working on your
[9:53] resolve to serve the Lord every
[9:56] situation seems like now and I I was
[9:59] just thinking about this after service
[10:00] the other day and I I think it's pretty
[10:02] amazing to me that when has there ever
[10:04] been in the age that we uh know in the
[10:07] world around that music has been played
[10:10] worldwide completely all the time in the
[10:13] malls and in the cars and in the homes
[10:15] and in the I I was in uh in India one
[10:18] time got an elevator and they were
[10:20] playing music from America and I looked
[10:22] over somebody I said you mean they pop
[10:23] the sewer from the states over here to
[10:25] India too you know uh this this this
[10:27] rock and roll stuff was playing on the
[10:30] on the elevator and I was thinking isn't
[10:31] it something the whole world is moving
[10:34] in the atmosphere they're moving under
[10:36] what the what the devil has set up an
[10:39] image for the whole world to worship and
[10:41] he's got his music and he got his
[10:43] advertisement he's got his entertainment
[10:45] everything is to break down the resolve
[10:48] of the Church of the Living God and and
[10:50] I found that it's a very powerful thing
[10:53] that as we are living in this season of
[10:55] time that God would choose you as an
[10:58] individual to place you in this time and
[11:01] and I I have to uh maybe reflect to
[11:04] think about how that God is a god of
[11:07] knowledge and I don't know of one
[11:09] mistake that he's ever made I I happen
[11:11] to be the one that believes that we
[11:13] serve a God who is omnipotent and he is
[11:15] infinite and he exactly knows and makes
[11:18] every decision with perfection and he
[11:20] don't have any better ideas than the
[11:23] ideas that he already has in other words
[11:25] I don't think God accidentally put you
[11:28] in this position or this place I think
[11:30] it's I think it's amazing to me if you
[11:33] could hear the discussion of God and
[11:35] Satan concerning you I think it would be
[11:37] a whole like like it was in the days of
[11:39] job when God and job were discussing job
[11:43] or God and Satan was discussing job and
[11:45] job had no idea what was being discussed
[11:48] but his integrity was what being
[11:50] discussed and God was saying this man is
[11:52] a man who walks before me with
[11:55] perfection and and I could either hold a
[11:57] a fence up or I can take take it down
[11:59] the man will not change and of course
[12:02] that was discussion of whether job would
[12:03] break down under pressure and God
[12:06] assured him this man right here will not
[12:09] break down under pressure and what kind
[12:11] of confidence did God have in an
[12:13] individual Amen to be able to say that
[12:15] and I I think of job's questions and how
[12:18] he asked of the Lord but in job the 38th
[12:20] chapter it tells us amen that God
[12:22] finally got tired of all the counselors
[12:24] talking to job so he literally come down
[12:27] and talked to himself said job gge
[12:29] yourself like a man we're going to talk
[12:31] about some things we're going to talk
[12:33] about the reason that you're going
[12:34] through the situations you are and they
[12:36] have nothing to do with whether you're
[12:38] sinning or not sinning it has everything
[12:40] to do with me and the devil has been
[12:42] discussing your integrity and I have put
[12:45] my entire reputation on you and the
[12:48] devil is said if I would just let you at
[12:50] him that he would break you down amen
[12:52] and you know what we found out we found
[12:54] out that God could put confidence in job
[12:57] because it wasn't job he was putting
[12:58] confidence in it was that job was the
[13:00] Seed of Abraham amen and God knew
[13:03] exactly the kind of seed he was now I
[13:05] happen to believe that God knows the
[13:07] type of you person you are and and that
[13:09] God would make a prediction concerning
[13:12] you before you ever got here amen that
[13:14] he would take a people out for his
[13:16] name's sake in the book of Acts these
[13:18] Gentile Church would become a bride a
[13:21] spotless bride and the prophet tells us
[13:23] that God chooses the age amen of Satan's
[13:26] eeden to call that bride now he did that
[13:30] for the purpose and the prophet tells us
[13:32] that he would be able to prove the bride
[13:35] in this generation now to some of us
[13:37] these things feel like a test but God's
[13:39] not testing you he's proving you amen
[13:43] and and and and to think amen that God
[13:45] would be uh uh be looking at you if you
[13:48] would you think well God's testing me
[13:49] well God's not really testing you he's
[13:51] proving you because he already knows the
[13:53] outcome amen it would only be a test if
[13:55] he didn't know what was going to happen
[13:57] but he already knows how you're going to
[13:59] respond so he's not testing he's proving
[14:02] that there is a seed that exists that
[14:04] will resist Satan in every Department in
[14:08] every area in other words there is
[14:10] something somewhere that will not be
[14:12] broke down under leot de see impression
[14:15] I happen to believe amen that there's a
[14:17] part of that bride setting right here
[14:19] this morning amen that has put up a
[14:21] resistance in the end time amen and and
[14:23] as I think about this I I look at these
[14:26] boys who are standing here in the face
[14:28] of this fiery furnace
[14:30] amen and they got a devil uh uh standing
[14:32] here in Nebuchadnezzar telling them if
[14:34] they won't bow they'll be thrown in the
[14:36] furnace and I and I thought about amen
[14:39] of what what would be running through
[14:41] the mind of an individual who is looking
[14:44] in the face of total Destruction how
[14:46] would the uh how would the spirit become
[14:49] uh unsettled or uncertain the future or
[14:52] how how things would begin to question
[14:55] of how is this going to go forward from
[14:57] this point amen but I I think of how
[15:00] amen that your current condition will
[15:03] only reflect what you believe the future
[15:05] conditions are going to be uh when you
[15:08] certainly know exactly what's about to
[15:11] happen amen it seems like people are a
[15:13] whole lot more settled in what is
[15:15] happening Amen in other words uh man can
[15:19] only predict his future by his past the
[15:22] the man can study the the current
[15:24] histories of of of the world and see
[15:26] what happened and and we thank God for
[15:28] memory we thank God for history amen
[15:30] otherwise some things would repeat but
[15:32] because we know history and we know
[15:34] what's going to happen then we can kind
[15:35] of guess what we think things are going
[15:38] to be and we decide now things of our
[15:41] future from the things that were past in
[15:43] the human realm but the beauty of God is
[15:46] God doesn't have to judge things from
[15:48] the history to try to understand what
[15:51] the future is going to be but God knows
[15:53] the future beforehand so amen if you if
[15:56] you would know the history of something
[15:58] if you know the history of an animal the
[16:00] history of some situation amen how
[16:02] helpful it would be to judge what's
[16:05] going to be because of the history you
[16:07] know about something you say well I know
[16:10] that individual I predict it'll be like
[16:12] this or I know that church I predict
[16:14] it'll be like this and how useful
[16:16] history is to predict the future amen
[16:18] but if history is useful in predicting
[16:21] the future how much greater is a vision
[16:23] of the future amen able to help you
[16:26] predict not only the future but to
[16:28] determine what to to do today based upon
[16:30] your vision of the future amen and I I
[16:34] say this because I believe that we're
[16:36] living in a leyan age but I do believe
[16:39] there's bride in this age that has been
[16:41] lifted above the conditions of this age
[16:44] amen by a vision of God and what he has
[16:47] for the church in this hour according to
[16:50] the Bible in Revelation chapter 3 it
[16:52] said to him that overcometh will I grant
[16:55] to sit with me in my
[16:57] throne even as I also overcame and sat
[17:01] down with my father in his throne in
[17:04] other words that you've been invited
[17:05] into Dominion amen as an overcomer now
[17:09] Jesus himself overcame now he overcame
[17:12] the cross he overcame the cross which
[17:15] was a terrible thing to face it was a a
[17:18] terrible situation but the devil offered
[17:20] him the same thing on the mountain in
[17:23] Temptation that these boys are being
[17:25] offered if you'll just Bow Down and
[17:27] Worship me I'll give you the kingdoms of
[17:29] the world but Jesus did not receive the
[17:32] kingdoms but rather he would accept the
[17:34] cross and he would die amen because he
[17:37] knew he had to pay the price now the
[17:39] Bible will tell us this that Jesus
[17:41] overcame and sat down with the father in
[17:44] his throne now in Hebrews chapter 12 and
[17:46] the second verse tells us exactly how
[17:49] Jesus overcame looking unto Jesus and
[17:52] the author the finisher of our faith who
[17:55] for the joy that was set before him
[17:57] endured the cross did despising the
[17:59] shame and to sit down at the right hand
[18:03] of the Throne of God Amen look at what
[18:05] this we're looking to Jesus this morning
[18:08] amen of how he overcame if we would look
[18:10] to him he did it by the joy that was set
[18:14] before him he endured the cross knowing
[18:17] the joy that the cross was going to
[18:19] bring amen I think of that this morning
[18:22] that we are actually compelled to look
[18:24] to Jesus who is both the author and the
[18:28] finisher of our faith he is the
[18:30] beginning of our faith and he is the
[18:32] finish of our faith and if we could look
[18:34] to him this morning I believe that we
[18:37] could get a vision of Christ amen that
[18:40] would transcend any condition that
[18:42] you're facing this morning knowing that
[18:45] he is able and that God is already
[18:47] Chosen and that God has already made up
[18:50] his mind concerning the church and and
[18:52] I'll say this God knows something about
[18:55] you Jacob that you do not know about
[18:57] yourself he knows things concerning your
[19:00] ability to overcome you do not know
[19:03] about yourself and you'll only know them
[19:05] as God allows you to face a trial and
[19:08] then when you go through a test you find
[19:11] out I am able to do this then the next
[19:14] time that same trial will not have the
[19:16] same power as the other one did because
[19:18] you're able to know now this is the
[19:20] thing that they were able to do these
[19:23] boys were able to look into the fire and
[19:25] they was able to see the other side they
[19:28] were able to see see the other side now
[19:30] uh in Abraham's Covenant confirmed
[19:32] brother bam teaches us a powerful thing
[19:34] of how to get past this situation I
[19:38] don't know I just felt certain
[19:40] specifically led to something this
[19:41] morning I don't know who and what and
[19:44] how what's facing but I I specifically
[19:46] feel this morning Amen to talk about a
[19:49] situation amen that we face in our lives
[19:52] but but but things that become furnaces
[19:55] become mountains become amen uh uh uh
[19:57] situations where we're wondering amen
[19:59] how will we make it through this area
[20:02] now I I'll say it to you like this in
[20:04] Abraham's Covenant brother bam teaches
[20:06] us that uh uh that there was a a big
[20:08] competition going on in the bicycle
[20:10] world and they were going to put a prize
[20:12] of a swim bicycle and and somebody was
[20:15] going to ride that
[20:16] bicycle amen and they put up a 6-inch
[20:19] Plank and said anybody that can ride
[20:21] this plank across this area and not fall
[20:24] off amen the the the winter will get
[20:26] this swim bicycle and that was a lot of
[20:29] people uh uh come up and a prophet said
[20:31] there was a lot of good riters he said
[20:32] there was men who were were professional
[20:34] bike riders great bike riders they they
[20:36] all come and they wanted to enter the
[20:38] contest amen and they're they're riding
[20:40] this little 6inch Plank and they're
[20:42] going out across there and they just got
[20:44] to stay on if that's all they have to do
[20:45] is just stay on it because if you stay
[20:47] on this it'll come out where you're
[20:48] supposed to and and and according to the
[20:51] story there wasn't any of the boys able
[20:53] to do it but there was actually one boy
[20:55] who was a little boy who wasn't a
[20:57] very good bike rider but he wanted that
[20:59] swin bicycle so so he he was able to
[21:03] complete uh uh the contest to be able to
[21:05] win the bicycle and later uh some of the
[21:08] more professional guys begin to ask him
[21:10] said well what was the secret behind you
[21:13] being able to do what we couldn't do how
[21:15] how could you do this and and and of
[21:17] course the boy began to say well the
[21:19] problem is you were all trying to keep
[21:21] the bicycle on the board by looking
[21:23] right down at your
[21:25] bicycle he said but I it made you
[21:28] nervous and you got to wiggling and you
[21:31] fell off he said I se where you made
[21:33] your mistake he said so I never did look
[21:36] down to what was here I just watched the
[21:39] end and kept it steady and that's what
[21:42] it is if we will watch the end and keep
[21:45] it steady and just keep moving on do you
[21:48] see it I'd be discouraged tonight if it
[21:51] wasn't for that for watching the end see
[21:54] just keeping it steady move on no matter
[21:56] what takes place keep going don't look
[21:59] at that just keep looking at the End
[22:02] Amen now I I know that that's a very
[22:05] simple lesson but we can't forget that a
[22:07] prophet taught us how to ride through
[22:10] the middle of the situations of our life
[22:13] that looks like that other people were
[22:15] not able to get through the same kind of
[22:17] areas but you are getting through it and
[22:20] you may not feel like you are capable to
[22:23] do so but there is a secret to what
[22:25] we're doing is we're looking to the end
[22:27] and not look looking at the current
[22:30] situation yes it's there for everybody
[22:33] but there are some people who refuse to
[22:35] look at the situation but rather they're
[22:38] looking to the end and they're holding
[22:39] their eye and it's keeping them steady I
[22:42] think of the great world leaders that
[22:44] have done the same thing when they begin
[22:46] to announce Victory before the end of a
[22:48] war when they begin to say we're coming
[22:51] out of this we're going to take place
[22:53] that's in a natural realm but how much
[22:55] more the Church of the Living God this
[22:57] morning are we able to announce that
[22:59] there's a church that's going in a
[23:01] Rapture how much more can I announce
[23:04] this morning that there is a victory in
[23:06] the Church of the Living God by the
[23:08] power and by the blessing of the Holy
[23:10] Ghost and the situations that we Face
[23:14] amen they're actually not as as
[23:16] dangerous as you think they are only if
[23:19] you go to looking at them looking at the
[23:22] Unseen brother R will say it this he
[23:24] said if a man would ever catch the
[23:26] vision of an invisible God and know that
[23:30] he's always present there's something
[23:33] that'll stabilize that man's thinking
[23:36] it'll stabilize his actions now you want
[23:38] to know how to remain stable in
[23:40] turbulent times you want to know how to
[23:42] remain stable in Troublesome times to to
[23:45] keep your nerve when it's a nervous age
[23:48] amen a prophet is teaching us a lesson
[23:50] it'll be done from the invisible world
[23:52] Amen everything of stability only will
[23:55] be gotten from an invisible world when
[23:57] there is no no hope you can have hope
[23:59] but where you going to get hope you're
[24:01] not going to get it in this world Amen
[24:03] but you can have hope if you look at the
[24:05] word of God and believe what the word
[24:07] says it'll give you a vision of tomorrow
[24:10] that the enemy cannot destroy because
[24:13] you have put him out of your vision amen
[24:15] see a man catches that vision of the
[24:17] invisible God and knows that he's always
[24:20] present amen do you believe that this
[24:22] morning do you believe he's always
[24:24] present do you believe God is always
[24:26] present in every every situation do you
[24:29] know God is present right here in this
[24:31] building right now amen Jesus said where
[24:34] two or three of you are gathered in my
[24:37] name there I will be in the midst of
[24:40] them so it wasn't really matter the
[24:43] condition it would matter the promise
[24:45] that God said I will be in the midst
[24:48] amen I I think of God this morning that
[24:51] he would be right here really then
[24:53] doesn't matter what I see or what I
[24:55] think or what I feel amen it matters
[24:58] what I believe and what I believe is
[25:00] that the resurrected Jesus Christ is in
[25:03] the midst of the church this morning and
[25:05] if he is here then every demon has been
[25:07] conquered and if he is here there is no
[25:10] weapon that is formed that will be able
[25:12] to prosper against the church if he is
[25:15] here amen and he stands here this
[25:17] morning and if we can catch an Invision
[25:19] of an invisible God and know that he's
[25:21] present now there's something that
[25:23] stabilizes that man's
[25:26] thinking it stabilizes es his actions in
[25:30] a time of distress and trouble it'll
[25:34] make him look upward and above things
[25:36] that are happening around him because
[25:39] he's looking at the Unseen but it's by
[25:42] promise see he's looking at the Unseen
[25:45] but by promise now I know the Bible said
[25:47] that Moses endured or overcome Egypt he
[25:51] did it by looking at the Unseen and now
[25:54] it's one thing to look at the Unseen
[25:56] it's another thing to see the
[25:58] unseen so it's not just that we must
[26:01] look at the Unseen we must see the
[26:03] Unseen and you said well how do we see
[26:06] the Unseen well if you want to have a an
[26:09] oak tree and I come to you and say and
[26:12] you you say to me brother r i want an
[26:13] oak tree and I give you an ACR you're
[26:16] going to see the Unseen the acrn is the
[26:19] seed of what you're hoping to see it's
[26:23] seeing the AC the Acron is the visible
[26:26] portion of an oak tree that's going to
[26:28] be in the future amen because that seed
[26:31] possesses everything it takes to make an
[26:33] oak tree so if you say I need healing in
[26:36] my body and I give you Isaiah 53 that is
[26:40] a seed to your healing amen and when you
[26:42] see Isaiah 53 it's the healing that
[26:45] you're looking for if you know that
[26:47] there's healing in the word of God now
[26:49] when you take this and you know the
[26:51] Unseen you see it by promise amen now
[26:55] you see this is how Abraham overcome now
[26:57] people say said well brother Wayne I
[26:59] want a vision and we think of Visions is
[27:01] only a supernatural like you're looking
[27:03] into another dimension or maybe that
[27:06] you're seeing a television screen
[27:07] somehow and you're viewing the future
[27:10] amen but according to the Bible in the
[27:12] days of Samuel the Bible said that the
[27:15] precious was the word of the Lord
[27:17] because there had been no open Vision in
[27:19] the days that had led up to Samuel being
[27:21] there but when Samuel came and heard a
[27:25] direct Revelation from God it became the
[27:28] vision of Israel now the church we know
[27:31] that the the Bible teaches us that a
[27:34] people without a vision is going to
[27:36] perish is that right without a vision we
[27:39] will perish now according to Malachi
[27:42] chapter 4 the Bible said unless Elijah
[27:45] would come the whole world would be
[27:47] Smitten by a curse everything will
[27:49] perish unless Elijah would come because
[27:52] he's going to bring a vision to the
[27:54] world in that generation not not that
[27:57] every person is going to see a
[27:59] supernatural screen that let you look
[28:01] into the future of time but rather a
[28:04] direct Revelation or a word from God
[28:07] Amen if you know you're hearing directly
[28:09] from God that becomes a vision to the
[28:12] church amen the first thing we have to
[28:14] do is realize we're not looking for a
[28:16] vision we have received a vision we're
[28:19] not praying for a vision we have
[28:21] received a vision we don't need to fast
[28:23] and pray to figure out what our future's
[28:26] going to be we have a Vindicated Prophet
[28:28] who has already given a vision to the
[28:31] church the only thing is is what are we
[28:33] going to do with the vision that he gave
[28:35] us amen are we going to question that
[28:37] Vision are we going to wonder what that
[28:39] Vision means or are we going to take the
[28:41] vision of God and Destroy every Spirit
[28:44] of nervousness and anxiety and every
[28:47] situation that's in our life look you
[28:48] got in your hands this morning young
[28:50] people a vision from God that get the
[28:54] the children of Hebrews through a fiery
[28:57] furnace it took Abraham through 25 years
[29:00] waiting on a baby and it'll take you
[29:03] through the situation you're facing this
[29:04] morning whether it's a mountain in front
[29:07] of you whether it's a Red Sea in front
[29:09] of you whether it's a crisis that you're
[29:11] facing there is a vision this morning
[29:14] that will stabilize
[29:17] you it will stabilize you you get a
[29:20] vision of an invisible God it'll bring
[29:24] stability it'll bring stability to your
[29:27] decisions
[29:28] it's an unstable time friends but
[29:31] stability comes from the
[29:34] vision that
[29:36] transcends the condition I I found a
[29:38] quote the other day I thought it's
[29:39] powerful I don't know who the origin of
[29:41] the quote but it was still a good quote
[29:43] it said don't do something permanently
[29:46] stupid because you're temporarily
[29:51] upset and how many decisions have been
[29:53] made like that permanently well I didn't
[29:57] get to saying or I didn't get to do this
[29:59] or somebody said that or somebody and
[30:01] make a decision on your whole life make
[30:04] a decision based upon something that is
[30:07] so temporary amen somebody said this to
[30:10] me or somebody did that now I'm going to
[30:12] do this making a decision based off of
[30:14] some situation but your decisions must
[30:18] come back to the vision of God's vision
[30:21] for your life what does God have for
[30:24] your life now that vision is a direct
[30:28] word from the Lord my if anybody ever
[30:33] had a direct word from the Lord this
[30:36] bride is in possession of a direct word
[30:40] from the Lord I've had people say to me
[30:42] brother Wayne come here let me prophesy
[30:43] over you I said that's all right I've
[30:45] already been prophesied over let me
[30:48] prophesy something over your life God's
[30:50] already prophesied over me he's already
[30:52] called me the bride he's already said
[30:55] I'm in a raptured condition he's already
[30:57] told me that I'll walk through every
[30:59] situation that comes to my life I don't
[31:02] need some Pentecostal trying to shake up
[31:05] something to be able to prophesy over me
[31:07] I have a dream over my life God has
[31:10] already prophesied over the Church of
[31:12] the Living God it doesn't matter what is
[31:15] coming it doesn't matter what we're
[31:17] looking at there is a stable life that a
[31:20] Believer lives we are resting behind the
[31:23] wings of Elohim this morning we are not
[31:26] in the reach of Satan and his devices my
[31:30] when I think about this morning at the
[31:32] at the reality of Nebuchadnezzar
[31:35] thinking that he could destroy God's
[31:38] children now if you read the next
[31:40] chapter we're going to probably get
[31:41] there maybe maybe not amen but I'll tell
[31:43] you this he found out he's not as in
[31:45] control as he thinks he
[31:47] is Nebuchadnezzar thought he ruled the
[31:49] world but he only did what God let him
[31:51] do and God proved to him you're not the
[31:54] one in control I'm the one in control
[31:57] and what NE Nezar didn't know the Hebrew
[31:59] children already did know they already
[32:02] knew Nebuchadnezzar you're not in
[32:04] control my God is in control the god
[32:07] that I'm worshiping is Moses's God the
[32:10] God I'm worshiping is Abraham's God and
[32:13] I will not bow to the god you set up my
[32:16] that isn't that something I'm going to
[32:18] preach to you a minute amen but I I want
[32:20] you to think about this amen the enemy
[32:22] was already setting up their gods isn't
[32:25] it something when the Bible records amen
[32:27] that they took the AR of the Lord and
[32:28] took it down into the Philistines and
[32:30] set it before Deon y'all remember the
[32:33] story they set the Ark of the Lord
[32:34] before Deon and after the time of Samuel
[32:37] amen and the scriptures tells us amen
[32:39] when they did this the next morning the
[32:41] Philistines come out and found that
[32:43] their God was laying prostrate in front
[32:45] of the Ark of the Covenant and you know
[32:47] what they had to do they had to set
[32:49] their God back up amen and they set it
[32:51] up and come back the next morning and
[32:53] their God was laying prostrate in front
[32:55] of the Ark of the Covenant and they set
[32:57] the thing back up up next time they come
[32:59] back and the thing had be to break apart
[33:01] the arms fell off and the head fell off
[33:03] they put it all together and set it back
[33:05] up well I'll tell you I don't want to
[33:07] serve any God that I got to get up every
[33:09] morning and set it back up and and and
[33:12] fix it back up and I'll tell you one
[33:14] thing the God that I serve I have never
[33:16] set it up I have never fixed my God but
[33:20] he's picked me up a many a morning there
[33:22] many morning than when I got up and I
[33:24] didn't know what would do and I got come
[33:27] down and and set me back up and put me
[33:30] back
[33:31] together I'm not going to worship any
[33:33] God I got to set
[33:36] up you got to repair your God you get
[33:39] the wrong
[33:44] God that's the
[33:48] truth I think of
[33:50] the I've been around a lot of idolatry
[33:53] so I'm sorry I've been over in the
[33:54] foreign worlds amen do you do you see
[33:56] amen what's going on here is these boys
[33:59] are aware that they have received a
[34:02] direct word from God do not bow do not
[34:05] Bend they've already received that word
[34:08] they have received a word amen that the
[34:11] seed that they are of will possess every
[34:15] gate that's in front of them amen now
[34:17] Christ identified in every iteration
[34:19] brother Ram said listen I want you to
[34:21] know this many times we get nervous and
[34:23] begin to think well it ought to be this
[34:25] way it ought to make it out this way we
[34:27] don't have nothing to do into it just
[34:28] play our part that he leads us to play
[34:31] remember there is nothing out of
[34:34] cater the great omnipotent God knows
[34:37] exactly before the foundation of the
[34:39] world that we would set right here
[34:41] tonight can you realize and really
[34:43] believe that God the infinite God knew
[34:46] you'd be sitting in that cheat this
[34:47] morning God knew you'd be sitting right
[34:49] here today can you imagine that the
[34:51] devil might have fought you all the way
[34:53] but God knew that you would press
[34:55] through you'd be sitting right here in
[34:57] this seat he knew every individual that
[34:59] would be right here today amen and if
[35:02] God is able to get you to this place
[35:04] don't you believe that God is able to
[35:06] speak a word to you that he knew that
[35:09] would change the situation that's into
[35:11] your life amen listen I believe amen
[35:14] that it's a direct Revelation from God
[35:16] there is nothing out of cater listen I
[35:19] don't know what you're going through but
[35:20] it's not out of cater my God is in
[35:23] complete control he knows exactly what's
[35:27] about to take place nothing out of cater
[35:30] now I know if you don't uh understand
[35:32] English that could be an odd word but we
[35:34] all understand Kentucky English nothing
[35:36] out of cater in other words amen there's
[35:38] nothing out of control here amen
[35:40] whatever's happening there's nothing out
[35:42] of cater I I think of this I think of of
[35:45] the situations that we get our lives
[35:47] into but there's nothing out of
[35:50] cater if God is infinite he's Almighty
[35:53] and he's all powerful he's omnipresent
[35:55] he's omnificent see he know all things
[35:58] from the beginning he knowed there is
[36:01] nothing out of cater it just it's just
[36:05] that that we think that it is it's
[36:07] everything is running look back in his
[36:10] word and see what he's doing and then
[36:12] you'll understand things that are to be
[36:14] he said your birth was pre-planned I
[36:16] guess you believe that every one of you
[36:18] knows your birth was pre-planned do you
[36:20] know that you're being here originated
[36:22] not just a myth or thought but
[36:24] everything was pre-planned by God before
[36:26] the foundation of the world that you
[36:28] would be here can you imagine that you
[36:31] would be here in this season in this
[36:33] time you would be facing this test amen
[36:36] knowing that God already knew the
[36:38] outcome before you ever faced it God
[36:41] knows how this is going to end God knows
[36:44] the situation that you're going to face
[36:46] I think this morning that if we could
[36:48] just let this we know the word of God
[36:50] where we are living the hour we're
[36:52] living in we know what lays ahead look
[36:55] by the word we know the word of God we
[36:57] we know where we are living we know the
[36:59] hour we're living in and we know what
[37:02] lays ahead isn't that something we know
[37:04] what lays
[37:06] ahead you say preacher how in the world
[37:09] could we know what lays ahead because we
[37:12] know it by the word of God do you know
[37:13] God's already in your
[37:16] future do you know God's already out in
[37:18] your future amen I I love to take the
[37:21] the story of of of Congressman Upshaw
[37:23] who was in one brother Bam's meetings he
[37:25] was a congressman been there been been
[37:27] been crippled for years and years just
[37:29] listened to his testimony the other day
[37:30] it's actually on tape in one of brother
[37:31] Bam's meetings he gets up and and
[37:34] testifies about how God healed him amen
[37:37] I think 60 something years he was he was
[37:39] crippled amen he was sitting in a
[37:40] meeting and brother B begins to discern
[37:43] and he goes back how many times you ever
[37:44] hear Brother Bram say now it's not me
[37:46] that knows your past it's not me that
[37:48] knows your name amen he begins to tell
[37:50] you it's not me I don't know these
[37:52] things but then he looks at at this
[37:53] congressman and says to him now when you
[37:56] were a little boy I see you falling off
[37:58] of a hay wagon and I see you getting
[38:00] crippled up and you're laying on a bed
[38:02] and they're drilling holes in the floor
[38:03] because of the vibrations hurting your
[38:05] back I see you I see you crippled I see
[38:07] you in front of a of a great uh a great
[38:10] place you're you're in a great capital
[38:12] in the United States of America and he
[38:13] starts saying things like that now
[38:15] what's he doing he's letting Congressman
[38:17] up shall know whoever's talking knows
[38:19] where he come from he knows the the hurt
[38:22] he knows the problem in the life God is
[38:25] not doing this by not knowing he knows
[38:29] and he's letting Congressman upsh know I
[38:31] know what you've been through but then
[38:33] he turns and the congressman speaks up
[38:36] in the middle of the Mee and says says
[38:38] something and interrupts brother bradam
[38:39] so that he realizes that he's telling
[38:42] the man presently what's been going on
[38:44] but then he changes the vision and says
[38:47] but Congressman do you have a brown suit
[38:50] and the man says yes I have a brown suit
[38:52] he says I see you I'll meet you walking
[38:55] on the street wearing that suit that's
[38:57] thus sayith the Lord amen look what it
[39:00] was God was already in the future of
[39:02] that Congressman he knew what was he
[39:05] knew what is and he knew what was going
[39:07] to be let me tell you this morning you
[39:10] may think amen that God does not
[39:12] understand or know what it is but God
[39:14] has already been there before you ever
[39:17] get there and he's already prepared the
[39:19] way I think sometimes we have forgotten
[39:22] that we serve God we have forgotten that
[39:24] the god that we serve is the creator of
[39:27] the universe the god that we serve is
[39:29] the one that spun the heavens and put
[39:32] the stars in their place the God that I
[39:34] serve is the one that made the Seas and
[39:37] the water he made the animals he made
[39:39] everything he remains to be
[39:43] God now now there's nothing
[39:47] wrong now I think it's a powerful thing
[39:50] when your Visions amen start taking in
[39:54] now the seed that you of if you go back
[39:57] in the Bible the seed these boys were
[39:59] now they're standing in front of a
[40:01] furnace and they're being proven of what
[40:05] they're about to do what will they do
[40:07] and they have to make an answer without
[40:10] knowing what God's going to do but
[40:13] they're only answering what I'm going to
[40:16] do do you see what they did they made an
[40:18] answer now go back in the scripture and
[40:20] watch Abraham's seed when God tells
[40:23] Abraham you shall have a seed and that
[40:25] seed shall be as the stars of the the
[40:27] heaven is the Sands of the sea and when
[40:29] the seed or when the star when he talks
[40:31] about that seed when God is telling
[40:33] Abraham this there is no
[40:36] seed Abraham's not even a
[40:39] father but in the in the Bible about the
[40:42] 17th vers chapter God finally names
[40:45] Abraham a father and he has no
[40:48] children and and and Sarah don't even
[40:51] have a way to bring a child but he makes
[40:54] a promise concerning him so in Romans
[40:57] four the Bible said that he called
[40:59] things that were not as though they
[41:02] were and the things that were as they
[41:05] were not and so shall thy seed be see so
[41:09] shall the seed so shall the seed be just
[41:11] like Abraham see what he was doing was
[41:14] making a promise unto Abraham and his
[41:16] seed who was not yet it was a
[41:18] supernatural seed he was talking about
[41:21] oh my think about this before Abraham
[41:24] had a seed I want you to see this before
[41:26] he had a seed God was making promises
[41:29] about that
[41:31] seed he didn't even have a natural way
[41:34] to have a seed and God was making
[41:36] promises concerning that seed because
[41:38] God knew what he was going to do in
[41:41] those seeds now the scripture tells us
[41:43] in Genesis 22 when Abraham carries Isaac
[41:46] up on the mountain and he puts him on
[41:48] the Altar and ties his hand he's going
[41:50] to destroy him remember remember what
[41:53] Abraham said he said the boy and I go up
[41:55] and he said the boy and I will return
[41:57] turn now he's going up on the mountain
[41:59] to destroy his son by by the command of
[42:02] God but he's saying I'm going up and I'm
[42:04] coming
[42:06] down because the god that gave me this
[42:08] boy is able to raise this boy now look
[42:12] what he does when he gets up there amen
[42:15] he finds out that about the time he's
[42:18] going to take the life of that boy look
[42:20] what happens something stays his hand he
[42:24] was fully committed in doing everything
[42:26] that God had commissioned him to do and
[42:29] something stayed his hand an angel
[42:31] stayed his hand is that right and begin
[42:34] to say because thou H have not withheld
[42:36] thy son thine only son we don't even
[42:40] have time to preach do we come on he had
[42:45] ishel come on church he had ishel he had
[42:49] a son but not the son God was talking
[42:51] about he had a son but that wasn't the
[42:54] seed God was talking about he wasn't
[42:56] talking about the natural seed he's
[42:58] talking about a spiritual seed he's
[43:00] talking about a faith seed got not with
[43:02] held thy son th only son remember he
[43:05] said he began to prophesy over him and
[43:06] said thy seed shall possess the gates of
[43:09] its enemy immediately thy seed shall
[43:12] possess the gates of in other words this
[43:14] kind of faith will possess the Gate of
[43:16] an enemy this is what will possess every
[43:19] gate now it's a it's a powerful thing in
[43:22] Abraham in Genesis 22 concerning Isaac
[43:26] but then if you follow the verses of
[43:27] scripture it's just a few years later
[43:30] this is when the Bible records that
[43:32] Sarah dies and it's a time for Isaac to
[43:36] take a seed wife amen and and Abraham
[43:39] says you can't take a wife from just
[43:41] anywhere I've got to have a wife for my
[43:43] own
[43:44] seed amen now there was a lot of women
[43:46] down there but look look at that seed
[43:49] that existed in Rebecca when they
[43:51] offered her the choice of being the wife
[43:53] to Isaac y'all know what she did amen
[43:56] she literally heard the man out she
[43:58] possessed a revelation concerning amen
[44:01] what it took to be that bride amen that
[44:04] he did not give her it come from her own
[44:06] heart and then elaser be to say to them
[44:09] remember he be to say can the damsel go
[44:12] with me he ask her brother ask her
[44:14] mother and finally they said amen she's
[44:16] of age let her answer let the damel
[44:19] speak it with her own mouth elzar said
[44:21] well let her go ahead and say it and
[44:22] then she began to speak I will go with
[44:24] this man Remember When she gave the
[44:28] answer I I'm facing something that I
[44:31] don't understand but there's a seed in
[44:34] me saying to go with this man to to walk
[44:38] into the unknown because of the story
[44:40] that I've heard and believe I'm a part
[44:43] of that seed line now watch when she
[44:46] said that now now nobody told nobody
[44:49] told nobody what was prophesied over
[44:52] Abraham concerning Isaac but the minute
[44:55] that this was this was spoken out of her
[44:57] lips the minute the answer was given
[44:59] according to the Book of Genesis they
[45:01] begin to prophesy over her and they
[45:04] begin to say thou shall be the mother of
[45:06] thousands and as the Sands and as the
[45:08] stars and thy seed shall possess the
[45:11] gates of its enemy the very same thing
[45:13] that had been spoken on the mountain was
[45:16] now spoken over Rebecca concerning her
[45:19] seed because she was a part of the Seed
[45:22] of Abraham my when I think about that
[45:25] this morning it was a final test had to
[45:27] come out of her own
[45:28] lips think about it there they stand
[45:31] down there at a furnace a fiery furnace
[45:34] and they're being challenged and
[45:35] somebody is saying now tell us what
[45:37] you're going to do tell us what you're
[45:40] going to say tell us I'm challenging you
[45:43] what are you going to do the world is
[45:45] falling apart people are leaving the
[45:47] word people are falling away from the
[45:49] churches what are you going to do I know
[45:51] amen that that seed was challenged in
[45:54] that hour to make its own decision to
[45:57] answer for itself do you know that the
[45:59] prophets answers amen it's not going to
[46:01] satisfy God until you use the same
[46:04] answer you've got to pick up this word
[46:06] and answer the devil the same way he did
[46:08] the same way the pastor the same way
[46:11] every believer you know answers you've
[46:13] got to answer back to
[46:15] God my When I See This Be answer begin
[46:18] to come out of this out of these boys
[46:20] they begin to answer when they do amen
[46:23] that puts them in a
[46:25] position amen that they was it was out
[46:28] of their own lips you know sometimes
[46:31] it's got to come right out of your
[46:35] lips sometimes you got to speak it for
[46:39] yourself I've often said this if a man's
[46:41] flirting with a man's wife another man
[46:43] you you the husband can go over and say
[46:45] the guy don't you don't you flirt with
[46:47] my wife but if the wife's making eyes at
[46:50] the guy behind him you won't never stop
[46:52] that but if that woman don't want that
[46:55] all she has to do is say don't you do
[46:57] that no more and that'll settle that
[47:00] amen and if if the Old Devil is fting
[47:02] around behind the Lord the Lord's
[47:04] already said something but what are you
[47:06] going to say I mean what what are you
[47:08] going to say in the face of a situation
[47:10] or a trial of your life it's up to you
[47:12] are you going to Bow are you going to
[47:14] serve God are you going to bow to this
[47:16] it situation of your life and and just
[47:19] lay down and let the devil run over and
[47:21] do
[47:24] and now think about this because it puts
[47:26] the church in a
[47:28] position that these boys said
[47:31] nevertheless we will not bow to your
[47:34] Idols now that's a real Christian
[47:36] Courage God's able to
[47:38] deliver God's able to deliver live or
[47:41] die I'll stand here now that's now now
[47:44] that's that's real Christian Courage and
[47:46] everybody says well that's what I'll do
[47:49] but till you're faced with it you don't
[47:51] know what you'll do I always thought
[47:54] well I wonder what I'll do brother B I
[47:56] went over you used to preach in India a
[47:57] whole lot and I went over and I knew it
[47:59] was against the law to convert their
[48:00] Hindus to Christianity and some of the
[48:02] regions are a little more uh they're a
[48:04] little more um uh persecuting with that
[48:07] some of the regions are a little softer
[48:08] with it and we get into some of those
[48:10] regions well one I hadn't been going
[48:12] very many times me and Tony adma went
[48:13] into this region it was a backwoods
[48:15] region amen we was in there holding
[48:17] meetings next thing I know the police
[48:18] run into our meetings amen brought
[48:21] brother Tony out of the pull pit and put
[48:22] him in the back amen and there they were
[48:24] interrogating him and I'm sitting there
[48:26] going amen I'm looking around and I
[48:28] always wondered how I would react you
[48:30] know so I'm sitting right here in a
[48:32] minute something just come in me I just
[48:34] got up and started leading some songs
[48:36] told them let's go ahead and just
[48:37] Worship the Lord now that the police
[48:39] come got me too but but but I I wondered
[48:41] what I would do and it wasn't trying to
[48:43] be mean but there was there was nothing
[48:45] in me that was shaken by what was
[48:47] happening and I was just thinking the
[48:49] Lord because I would have been shooking
[48:51] I've been a I've been a good guy my
[48:52] whole life I don't want to go to jail
[48:54] amen but but but but what we're looking
[48:56] at is that in that moment I remember I
[48:59] remember sitting there one one morning
[49:00] we wake up about 3:00 or 4: in the
[49:01] morning I don't know what time it was
[49:03] exactly but we was living in a little
[49:04] Brick House Down In Black Rock Arkansas
[49:06] we woke up the whole thing was shaking
[49:08] the the bed was shaking it literally
[49:10] woke us up lived uh that's a there's a
[49:13] fault line down there near to where we
[49:14] was living and and the whole bedroom was
[49:17] just shaking it was shaking enough woke
[49:18] me up now that that takes some doing
[49:20] sometime at 3:00 or 4: in the morning
[49:22] and and when I woke up I felt the bed
[49:24] shaking and I knew we was in an
[49:25] earthquake and I always wondered you
[49:27] know cuz when I was a little boy I
[49:29] remember the the pastor that's about the
[49:31] only thing he preached on was Los
[49:33] Angeles is sinking there's an earthquake
[49:35] and we're going in a Rapture I remember
[49:36] those three things you know so we was
[49:38] always worried about that earthquake a
[49:39] little boy that in a boy's mind that
[49:41] sticks big you know so I always wondered
[49:43] what would I do in that moment if an
[49:45] earthquake begin to shake and I felt
[49:47] that shaking coming in the bed and I
[49:49] just lifted up from the bed and I
[49:50] remember I just begin to just begin to
[49:52] put my hands up and begin to Worship the
[49:54] Lord and I thought I didn't know where
[49:55] that come from it' just come out of me
[49:58] but but I had never been in a situation
[50:00] to find out what was going to happen in
[50:03] that moment and and God will allow
[50:05] situations to come into your life that
[50:08] you don't even understand how you're
[50:09] going to react but God knows how you
[50:12] were going to react God knows what's
[50:14] inside you God deposited something in
[50:17] you amen you're of a Heritage of a seed
[50:21] line come on that that seed of those
[50:23] Hebrew boys didn't die back there in the
[50:26] Bible it's still alive today the same
[50:29] kind of life that was in them that could
[50:31] look in the face of that fire is still
[50:33] on the inside of Believers in this hour
[50:37] yes that seed still lives now I'll tell
[50:39] you how they I'll tell you how they face
[50:41] the fire when they looked at the fire
[50:43] they didn't focus on the
[50:45] fire and you cannot focus on this fire
[50:48] you cannot focus your life on the
[50:51] situation and ever make it out of it let
[50:54] me let me just say this could I could I
[50:56] use a a term you understand it's time to
[50:58] look away to
[51:01] Jesus it's time to look into the Unseen
[51:04] it's time to put your focus on the word
[51:06] of God I don't know what the world's
[51:08] going to do I know it's going to fall
[51:10] apart but I don't want to fall apart
[51:12] with it I don't want to crumble with it
[51:14] come on church we met God put these boys
[51:18] on a
[51:20] rock set my feet on a rock put me on the
[51:23] kind of rock that Moses was standing on
[51:26] when the Red Seas couldn't stop him amen
[51:28] when the Red Seas couldn't keep him from
[51:30] passing he was set on a rock and God
[51:32] will set every believer on a rock come
[51:35] on you'll tie your own I don't know
[51:37] about you but I want to be tied to the
[51:39] absolute I don't want to be shaking and
[51:41] shivering I don't want to stand there in
[51:43] every uncertain situation and wonder
[51:45] what's going to happen God tied me to
[51:48] something that cannot be
[51:51] shaken well amen I believe it I believe
[51:54] it this morning the kingdoms of this
[51:55] world are shaken
[51:58] the Shook Up church amen the economy is
[52:01] shaking health systems are shaken amen
[52:04] the the military is shaken the Bible
[52:07] even says everything that can be shaken
[52:10] will be shaken but we have received a
[52:13] kingdom that cannot be
[52:17] shaken n it's falling apart but we are
[52:20] not falling
[52:22] apart because we have took a vision that
[52:25] transcends the problem
[52:27] that goes above the situation looking
[52:30] looking into the fire not looking at it
[52:32] amen I'm not going to stand there and
[52:33] look at that fire and wonder how hot it
[52:35] is and how much trouble I'm going to get
[52:37] and what kind of Situation's about to
[52:39] happen and how's this going to hurt me
[52:41] and what's this going to destroy me amen
[52:43] half the things you figure out's wrong
[52:47] anyhow come on church this anxiety and
[52:50] worry that's going on in this generation
[52:53] it's just horrible why worry about it
[52:55] pray about it what's worry going going
[52:56] to change you if you were dying in the
[52:59] morning if they were going to put you to
[53:01] death in the morning you could worry all
[53:03] night long and you're still going to die
[53:06] but if you begin to Pray by some have
[53:09] God might step in the way and change the
[53:12] situation wory will destroy you it'll
[53:15] give you a high blood pressure it'll
[53:17] make you Punchy it'll make you hard to
[53:19] get along with are you with me it'll put
[53:21] you in a nervous state but if you would
[53:23] begin to pray it'll put the spirit of
[53:26] Grace on you it'll put a kind word in
[53:28] your mouth and in a time of trouble
[53:31] there will be a stability in
[53:35] you you got to turn your focus from the
[53:39] fire to the man that's in the
[53:43] fire I love it brother Bram said they
[53:45] actually could see that they could
[53:47] actually see the man in the fire they
[53:49] could see the Fourth Man in the fire if
[53:51] you change your focus then you're going
[53:53] to have to ask who is that amen wouldn't
[53:55] it be something if we could see who it
[53:57] was in that fire amen turn your focus to
[54:00] the not the fire but but who's in that
[54:02] fire who is it in there what are we
[54:05] stepping into who is who is it in there
[54:08] the fourth man they said look like the
[54:10] Son of God somebody said brother brandom
[54:12] is said Daniel he said no it was Jesus
[54:14] it was not Jesus Amen in such as you
[54:17] know Jesus it was prefigure it was what
[54:20] Abraham met it was mdct it was Elohim it
[54:25] was God who was in that fire now the
[54:27] beauty of knowing who it is is because
[54:30] he was the god that made that promise to
[54:32] Abraham on that mountain the same one
[54:35] that had made the promise was the one
[54:38] standing in the fire to confirm the
[54:40] promise my lord it's one thing for God
[54:43] to promise something it's another to
[54:46] show up in the hour when the promise is
[54:48] needed and there God was standing in the
[54:51] flame of the fire showing them I'm not
[54:54] just a god when things are good
[54:56] I'm not just God when you're up here in
[54:59] the high places of your life but God is
[55:02] God when you're facing the fire when
[55:04] you're facing the trouble when the
[55:06] situations are there my God is still God
[55:10] he's not changing by the situation or
[55:13] this oh God he remains to be
[55:16] God I got to I got to reading on this
[55:19] last night got a little carried away
[55:20] myself I got to look at over in that
[55:22] fire and I started pulling back the
[55:24] flames and I got to hey you got to get a
[55:27] good clear look at him cuz he through
[55:29] Through the flames you might you might
[55:31] think he changed a little somehow a
[55:33] flame might be over you might think
[55:35] there's a little change to him but I
[55:37] promise the fire never changed
[55:39] him I promise you it may impede your
[55:42] vision but it'll never change him it may
[55:45] hinder the way you see him but it'll
[55:47] never change him the Fire doesn't have
[55:49] the power to do that are you hearing me
[55:52] and when they look through it just just
[55:53] pull back a couple Flames just pull back
[55:56] a couple and get a good look at him and
[55:58] I'll tell you what amen you'll hear
[56:00] Isaiah saying oh he's the Everlasting
[56:03] father you'll hear Isaiah say he's the
[56:06] prince of the peace you can hear Ezekiel
[56:08] say there's the wheel in the middle of
[56:11] the wheel amen there he is that's him
[56:13] that's the one that made the promise to
[56:15] Abraham if you pull it back a little
[56:17] more you can see what the Song of
[56:19] Solomon said about him when he said he's
[56:21] the rose of
[56:23] sharing oh I just like this one he's the
[56:26] lily of the valley I got to studying on
[56:28] that last night and my heart just
[56:29] carried away amen that that old Solomon
[56:32] would look in there and he would see
[56:34] Jesus and call him the lily of the
[56:35] valley can you imagine when oh when old
[56:38] meac pulled back the Flames a little
[56:40] looked there and said hey guys don't
[56:41] worry amen amen the Lily is already in
[56:44] the fire he's already in there the Lily
[56:47] is waiting on us now the prophet said
[56:50] why they called him the lily of the
[56:51] valley how many knows why they called
[56:52] Jesus the lily of the valley because
[56:54] it's a lily they make opium out out of
[56:56] right how how do they make opium they
[56:58] squeeze it down and they take the drug
[57:01] out and then men who get addicted or
[57:04] they're nervous or something they go to
[57:06] these opium houses and they smoke it and
[57:08] they get into a vision that transcends
[57:10] the conditions that they're in the
[57:12] situations you see they do it medically
[57:15] or they do it uh how could I say it now
[57:18] now you got to know that everything the
[57:20] devil has is only a perversion of what
[57:22] God
[57:23] has don't you ever think that some of
[57:26] you that done drugs out in the world
[57:28] don't you ever think that that wasn't a
[57:29] perverted desire it's not that God don't
[57:32] want you high he just don't want you
[57:34] hide on the devil's
[57:35] opium come on church it's not that God
[57:38] don't want you to get drunk he don't
[57:40] want you drunk on the devil's wine amen
[57:42] God does desire that a man how would you
[57:45] desire it if God didn't have something
[57:47] to fix it for you but Jesus is the fix
[57:50] to every opium addict he's the fix to
[57:53] every drug addict he's the fix to every
[57:56] alcoholic my Jesus is the fix to this
[57:59] entire world he's the fix to the flames
[58:02] of fire oh he is the lily of the valley
[58:06] my they pressed that down and took the
[58:08] Opium out of my Lord and brother B said
[58:11] you you can lay down in there and it'll
[58:13] bring peace to your life it'll bring
[58:15] it'll bring peace and Tranquility it'll
[58:18] carry you off as if you're in another
[58:20] dimension amen it can become hucog enic
[58:23] even people can do it and see visions
[58:26] and speak words that are not known to
[58:27] this world do you know that if a man
[58:30] would ever fall in love with Jesus long
[58:32] enough you'll see the world differently
[58:35] you see loved ones differently you see
[58:38] the church
[58:41] differently pull back them Flames you'll
[58:43] see he was a lily of the valley could I
[58:46] could I challenge you by saying this
[58:48] this was not a high point for the
[58:50] children of Hebrew for that for them
[58:53] three boys I would not think they
[58:56] thought they were on a
[58:59] mountain I would figure they thought
[59:01] they were in the greatest Valley of
[59:02] their
[59:04] life it was a valley of decision that
[59:06] become a Valley of
[59:10] Vision that's what happened they were in
[59:12] a valley do you know what you know what
[59:14] the devil thinks amen the devil thinks
[59:16] he can change your
[59:19] position and it'll cause you to react
[59:21] certain ways now is if where you are
[59:24] makes a difference of who God is but
[59:27] brother bam said the Lord Jesus is still
[59:29] the same God there's no difference in
[59:31] you you're God on the housetop you're
[59:34] God in the mountain you're God in the
[59:36] valley you're god of the sea you're god
[59:38] of the heavens you're God of creation
[59:41] you're the god of our life you're the
[59:43] god of everything he says there is your
[59:47] god he's the lily of the valley do y'all
[59:50] do y'all know the scripture teaches it
[59:53] it in First Kings chapter 20 that there
[59:55] was a group that believed that God was
[59:57] only the god of the mountain how many
[59:59] ever read that in First Kings chapter 20
[1:00:02] the Bible records amen that there was a
[1:00:04] war going on and Ahab that Wicked King
[1:00:07] was leading Israel but God was fighting
[1:00:09] for Israel even though they had a wicked
[1:00:11] leader because he was their seed right
[1:00:13] and they went into a battle and they won
[1:00:15] a great battle on the mountain but when
[1:00:18] when Ahab began to relax God sent the
[1:00:20] prophet to tell him he said look don't
[1:00:22] don't you relax now don't relax because
[1:00:25] this same enemy that fought you on the
[1:00:27] mountain is going to regroup him with
[1:00:29] one time of one year he's going to
[1:00:32] return and he's going to attack you in
[1:00:34] the
[1:00:35] Valley now look what he's telling him
[1:00:37] he's telling him that this same enemy
[1:00:39] now that attack you on the mountain
[1:00:41] believes that he can return in the
[1:00:43] valley and get you now the Bible said
[1:00:46] amen that there was a counselor went to
[1:00:47] the king of the syrians there and
[1:00:49] actually told them that the god of
[1:00:51] Israel is only a god of the Mountaintop
[1:00:55] he's not a god of the Valley now you
[1:00:58] know why you do youall know why they
[1:00:59] believe that anybody ever studied to
[1:01:01] find out why they in the Book of Judges
[1:01:04] the Bible says that Judah ran the enemy
[1:01:07] off the mountain tops but when they went
[1:01:09] down into the valley that the the enemy
[1:01:12] had chariots that were banded with iron
[1:01:14] and they was not able to push the
[1:01:16] Chariots of the enemy out of the valley
[1:01:18] so the people in the regions begin to
[1:01:20] believe amen that Israel was Stronger on
[1:01:23] the mountain than they were in the
[1:01:24] valley the devil begin to believe that
[1:01:27] the God was confined to the mountain
[1:01:29] tops that's where his Temple was that's
[1:01:31] where everything was and in the mountain
[1:01:33] tops Israel is strong but if you can
[1:01:35] ever get them in the valley you can
[1:01:37] defeat them do you know that the devil
[1:01:39] believes that same thing this morning he
[1:01:41] believes you when you're here shouting
[1:01:43] in church he knows to leave you alone he
[1:01:45] takes his devils and goes and hides he
[1:01:47] said wait till tomorrow when they're
[1:01:49] weary with a bill wait till tomorrow
[1:01:51] till they got a flat on the car wait
[1:01:53] till tomorrow till there's a situation
[1:01:55] coming up in their life the devil
[1:01:57] believes that if he can get you in a
[1:01:59] valley he can destroy you in the
[1:02:03] valley that's what he believes anyhow
[1:02:05] but he's a dumb
[1:02:07] Devil he's a dumb devil because one
[1:02:10] thing he hasn't read about the Church of
[1:02:12] the Living God is we're not going to
[1:02:14] surrender to the devil whether we're on
[1:02:16] the mountain or we're in the valley
[1:02:18] whether we are victorious or whether we
[1:02:20] are destroyed it does not matter to us
[1:02:22] we will not bow our knee we will not
[1:02:25] Bend Our Lives Amen to this demon in
[1:02:28] this
[1:02:30] age you know what the Bible said amen
[1:02:33] the Bible actually said that because
[1:02:35] they had said this I love the scripture
[1:02:37] how it says it he said the children of n
[1:02:39] were of Israel were numbered in the 27
[1:02:42] chap verse before them like two little
[1:02:44] flocks of kids and the syrians filled
[1:02:46] the country and there came a man of God
[1:02:48] and spake unto Israel and said thus
[1:02:50] saith the Lord I love a vision don't you
[1:02:53] amen a couple little kid are f a great
[1:02:56] Army and the word comes thus saith the
[1:02:59] Lord amen spake unto the king of Israel
[1:03:02] the syrians have said that the Lord is
[1:03:05] the god of the hill and he's not the god
[1:03:07] of the valley therefore will I deliver
[1:03:09] thee out of this great multitude and you
[1:03:12] shall know that I am the Lord isn't that
[1:03:15] powerful amen you're going to know that
[1:03:17] I'm the Lord You're Going to know that
[1:03:19] when you get in the valley is where the
[1:03:21] real Revelation is going to strike you
[1:03:23] when you're in the face of the fiery
[1:03:24] furnace that that's when the real
[1:03:26] Revelation is going to strike you you
[1:03:28] are not in control God is in control
[1:03:32] you're not in control of your life
[1:03:34] you're not in control of the world you
[1:03:36] cannot control things quit
[1:03:40] trying come on Church you cannot control
[1:03:43] world events you can't stay up all night
[1:03:45] and shoot your nails and control what
[1:03:47] the world's going to do and how the how
[1:03:49] the world's going to react and what kind
[1:03:51] of viruses are going to strike you
[1:03:53] cannot control the world we are not of
[1:03:56] this world we come from another place
[1:03:59] and God has sent a word into the church
[1:04:02] that even when you're in the valley I am
[1:04:05] still the Lord and you're going to know
[1:04:07] that I am the Lord are you hearing me
[1:04:09] this morning he is the lily of your
[1:04:15] Valley you said my goodness brother
[1:04:17] Wayne what are you saying I'm saying
[1:04:20] that God does miraculous things when
[1:04:22] you're in the valley He Still Remains to
[1:04:25] be God and he does it to prove to the
[1:04:28] devil that he is God whether a child is
[1:04:32] on the mountain or whether he's in the
[1:04:34] valley whether he's in a Red Sea whether
[1:04:37] he's standing at the Jordan oh come on
[1:04:40] church I love to read my Bible I just
[1:04:42] love it I just love it because you know
[1:04:45] what I found out I found out when David
[1:04:47] come to the children of Israel and was
[1:04:49] bringing food and Goliath was down there
[1:04:52] do you know where Goliath was standing
[1:04:54] he was standing in the valley
[1:04:56] he was challenging the children of God
[1:04:58] who was on the mountain to come in the
[1:05:00] valley and meet him and there wasn't
[1:05:02] anybody there that really belied that
[1:05:03] God was a god of the valley but David
[1:05:06] amen assumptious believe that he is God
[1:05:09] though he hide my soul in hell my God
[1:05:12] will find me he knew the God that he was
[1:05:14] serving let me tell you something you
[1:05:16] cannot put a child of God anywhere that
[1:05:19] God cannot show up on the
[1:05:23] scene yes sir it's where Goliath was he
[1:05:25] was in a
[1:05:26] Valley come on I love to see it it's
[1:05:29] that's right there was a valley when
[1:05:32] Moses was leading the children of Israel
[1:05:34] and they were fighting amalekites you
[1:05:35] know where the amalekites caught them
[1:05:37] caught them in the valley do you know
[1:05:39] how God defeated them took Moses to the
[1:05:41] mountain put a two men to hold up his
[1:05:44] arms and as long as his arms were lifted
[1:05:47] the children of Israel could look out of
[1:05:50] the valley and see a vision of victory
[1:05:54] in the middle of the valley
[1:05:56] of division of division and and defeat
[1:05:59] now now you you've heard it told that in
[1:06:02] that Valley you've heard it told in that
[1:06:04] Valley uh that that aren't hand toand
[1:06:08] combat it can get personal right and you
[1:06:10] can get caught up in your own little
[1:06:12] world your own little battle and forget
[1:06:14] about the full
[1:06:16] battle but if there was somebody on the
[1:06:18] hill you could look away from the battle
[1:06:21] right in front of you and you could see
[1:06:23] how the battle was going in general
[1:06:26] you might be losing a battle but see
[1:06:28] look up to Moses and see how the war is
[1:06:30] going and as long as Moses's hands was
[1:06:33] up the individuals in the valley believe
[1:06:35] we're going to have a
[1:06:37] victory and as long as you believe
[1:06:39] there's a victory there's going to be a
[1:06:42] victory and as long as they were
[1:06:44] fighting under the banner of Victory
[1:06:46] there was a victory going on in those
[1:06:47] valleys amen now think about it because
[1:06:50] the devil was trying to destroy them in
[1:06:51] a valley but God put somebody on a
[1:06:53] mountain that could give a Vision to
[1:06:56] somebody in the valley in other words
[1:06:57] when you get in the lowest parts of your
[1:07:00] Valley then it's time to look
[1:07:05] up now y'all know that when God got
[1:07:08] ready he prepared us a greater than
[1:07:10] Moses and he took our lord Jesus and he
[1:07:13] put him on the cross on a hill of gtha
[1:07:17] and he stretched his hands and nailed
[1:07:20] them to the cross that they could never
[1:07:21] come down so anytime a Believer from the
[1:07:25] Val looks to Calvary they will see the
[1:07:28] raised hands of Jesus Christ they will
[1:07:31] see a sign of Victory no matter where
[1:07:33] they're standing if you can part the
[1:07:35] Flames look to Calvary if you can look
[1:07:39] past the gate see the Promise God has
[1:07:41] already put a vision in there that would
[1:07:44] be able to defeat now I could keep going
[1:07:47] on this Valley a while because I found
[1:07:49] out this is exactly where Elisha met
[1:07:52] them remember the other night we
[1:07:53] preaching on worship and he told him to
[1:07:55] bring a and let a vision come y'all
[1:07:57] remember that that happened in the
[1:07:59] valley you know what you know what
[1:08:01] Elisha said to them when they got in the
[1:08:03] valley and couldn't get out he said dig
[1:08:04] your Valley full of ditches and God will
[1:08:07] fill it with water you're not going to
[1:08:08] hear any rain you're not going to see
[1:08:10] any du but God will fill it with water
[1:08:13] brother man said where was it he said
[1:08:14] the water was in the rock that was below
[1:08:16] them and if they would just keep digging
[1:08:18] they would break into the spirit of God
[1:08:21] listen to me Church God's above you
[1:08:23] God's under you God's in you God's all
[1:08:26] around you you can't go anywhere and not
[1:08:29] find God my God is Not depending upon
[1:08:33] the condition whether you're on the
[1:08:35] mountain or in the valley he is still
[1:08:40] godo
[1:08:43] my I don't know if God still fights in
[1:08:45] The
[1:08:46] Valleys oh yeah y'all know that one of
[1:08:49] the famous Wars of Yong kapor that was
[1:08:51] fun I'm probably not pronouncing that
[1:08:53] right sister sister GRS are here she
[1:08:55] probably get me but anyhow I I try my
[1:08:57] best but she's not here okay I'm okay
[1:09:03] then but y'all remember when Israel was
[1:09:07] worshiping in October and they was under
[1:09:09] the the Feast of atonement they was all
[1:09:12] worshiping God that's when the enemy
[1:09:14] decided to attack because they had their
[1:09:16] attention they thought well they're not
[1:09:18] paying attention so we'll get them but
[1:09:19] they was focusing on the right thing
[1:09:22] they focusing on the Lord and you know
[1:09:24] what happened if you read the Golden
[1:09:26] Heights battle they call it now the
[1:09:29] Valley of Tears go read it go read about
[1:09:32] the valley of it's a powerful it's a
[1:09:33] powerful lesson but in the Valley of
[1:09:35] Tears that's when the Syrian Army
[1:09:37] attacked Israel unbeknown and they had
[1:09:40] like 1,200 tanks to 300 is that the
[1:09:42] right number it's very close it's about
[1:09:44] 1,00 takes to 300 and by the time that
[1:09:47] the assault was coming to an end Israel
[1:09:50] only had a couple tanks left and was
[1:09:52] almost out of bullets and here come
[1:09:54] about 350 Syrian tanks Over the Horizon
[1:09:57] and all of the sudden out of nowhere the
[1:09:59] syrians turn around and
[1:10:02] run and later amen they was some of the
[1:10:05] some of the war strategist people today
[1:10:07] they were studying the the the battle
[1:10:09] scene and they were saying well they
[1:10:11] they were seeing the tanks moving and
[1:10:12] they thought there was a lot more tanks
[1:10:13] than there was but they asked the Mad
[1:10:16] interrogated one of the Syrian generals
[1:10:18] that was leading the attack and he said
[1:10:21] he said y'all believe what you want to
[1:10:23] but I'll tell you what happened he said
[1:10:24] was a host of Angels standing at the
[1:10:27] border of Israel and a white hand come
[1:10:29] out of heaven and said stop and go no
[1:10:33] further he said now wouldn't you have
[1:10:35] stopped and turn around and
[1:10:37] left you can believe what you want to
[1:10:39] but a hand come out of heaven and says
[1:10:41] stop and go no further do you know God
[1:10:44] still has his hand that will stop the
[1:10:46] enemy in his tracks I know there's a lot
[1:10:49] of Devils coming against the church but
[1:10:51] church we will not surrender we'll fight
[1:10:54] this devil we'll fight him in the fire
[1:10:56] we'll fight him in the water we'll fight
[1:10:58] him oh come on church we'll fight him in
[1:11:01] our praise we'll fight this devil
[1:11:03] wherever he shows up but we will not
[1:11:06] surrender we will not turn around we
[1:11:08] will not go
[1:11:11] back I think it's time for the church to
[1:11:14] remember you're the Seed of
[1:11:19] Abraham brother Wayne I can't I can't
[1:11:21] worship from this
[1:11:24] place musicians would come tell me about
[1:11:27] Jonah go ahead and tell
[1:11:29] me go ahead Jonah tell me tell me how
[1:11:32] deep the ocean is tell me how deep you
[1:11:35] are in that in the belly of that well
[1:11:37] said brother you just don't understand
[1:11:38] you tell me one person in this building
[1:11:40] this morning's worse off and Jonah
[1:11:42] was Jonah was swallowed by a well in the
[1:11:45] bottom of an
[1:11:48] ocean and the Bible said he turned and
[1:11:51] looked he transcended the condition and
[1:11:55] caught a vision that Solomon said in a
[1:11:58] prayer If any man would turn and look to
[1:12:00] the temple I will deliver him well I
[1:12:03] tell you this morning we are not looking
[1:12:04] to the East and we are not looking to
[1:12:06] any natural Temple but we are putting
[1:12:09] our Eyes Upon Jesus Christ and the
[1:12:11] deliverer that was in a fire the
[1:12:13] deliverer that was in the belly of a
[1:12:15] whale is the deliverer of the Church of
[1:12:17] the Living God this morning and I
[1:12:20] believe it I believe it with all of my
[1:12:21] heart I believe you can begin to be
[1:12:23] turned into Judah in the middle of the
[1:12:24] valley
[1:12:27] come on y'all know who Judah was judah's
[1:12:30] the fourth son of Leah isn't you by the
[1:12:33] time four Sons come along she had
[1:12:34] already got upset because seemed like
[1:12:36] that Isaac wasn't going to love her or
[1:12:38] Jacob but it it seemed like it wasn't
[1:12:40] going to happen Isaac uh Jacob yeah
[1:12:42] seemed like Jacob was I'm sorry names
[1:12:44] are flipping around on me you ought to
[1:12:46] be up here where I'm at all kinds of
[1:12:48] things flipping around on
[1:12:51] me but the time they got to the four son

[1:12:56] will praise the
[1:12:57] Lord and she named Judah the name
[1:13:00] because of the praise and do you know
[1:13:02] who went first in the
[1:13:04] battles do you know who went the first
[1:13:06] in the battles of Israel it was Judah
[1:13:09] because Judah was the praise and
[1:13:11] whenever God has children that will
[1:13:13] praise him he will come down and prove
[1:13:15] to the world that he remains to be God
[1:13:18] come on Church you're you're that Rahab
[1:13:20] in the Bible who married a general from
[1:13:24] the tribe of Judah you have married the
[1:13:27] chief of Praise You have married the
[1:13:29] high priest of Praise Jesus Christ the
[1:13:32] son of God look here you look up at him
[1:13:35] tonight and if you can't find a reason
[1:13:37] to worship him look again if you can't
[1:13:39] pull back some fire and find a reason to
[1:13:42] worship God you said brother Wayne I'm
[1:13:43] in the Valley look up to the mountain
[1:13:46] then I'm in the fire pull back the fire
[1:13:49] and see the lily of the valley is
[1:13:51] standing
[1:13:54] there
[1:13:55] I don't know what you're going
[1:13:58] through I just know sitting in my room
[1:14:00] the Lord just kept bringing this again
[1:14:03] and again and
[1:14:06] again he is God
[1:14:13] anywhere he is
[1:14:16] God and there is no
[1:14:20] other so brother Wayne you mean you mean
[1:14:23] even in hell oh oh I'm glad you
[1:14:27] ask cuz according to my Bible when them
[1:14:31] Hebrew children were in that kind of
[1:14:32] trouble somebody come in fire with
[1:14:35] them but when the entire
[1:14:38] world fell under sin the Devil Couldn't
[1:14:42] whip us up in
[1:14:44] heaven so we F in the valley of
[1:14:47] humanity and here he come chasing and
[1:14:50] the same one that was in heaven
[1:14:51] descended right into the Earth and stood
[1:14:53] on the earth and defeated sicknesses he
[1:14:56] defeated situations he raised the dead
[1:14:58] he conquered everything that could be
[1:15:00] conquered and cast the enemy out and the
[1:15:03] enemy run to the deepest valley into the
[1:15:05] inner
[1:15:06] Chambers he run into
[1:15:09] hell but our Lord took death into his
[1:15:11] bosom and chased him into the regions of
[1:15:14] Hell
[1:15:15] Hallelujah he said to him you're not
[1:15:17] getting away from me anywhere you're not
[1:15:19] going to pull back and say to my
[1:15:21] children that that you whip me anywhere
[1:15:23] any place any time
[1:15:25] and he knocked on the door of the gates
[1:15:27] of hell and took from the Devil the keys
[1:15:30] to his own house and ascended under
