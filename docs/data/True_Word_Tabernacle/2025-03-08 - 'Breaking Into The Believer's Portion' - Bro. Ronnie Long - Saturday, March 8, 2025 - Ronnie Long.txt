that's how he moves there's not a congregation I'd rather be speaking to tonight I love each of you with all my heart and there's no man of God I'd rather be speaking with than my buddies amen see if we can get through this I love thee oh Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my Buckler and the Horn of my salvation in my high tower I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemies the Sorrows of death Compass me in the floods of ungodly Med made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even into his ears then the Earth Shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth and there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and a fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and he did fly yet he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made Darkness his secret place his Pavilion round about him were dark Waters and thick clouds of the skies at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hailstones and coals of fire the Lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hailstones and coals of fire yay he sent out his arrows and Scattered them and he shot out Lightnings and discomfited them then the channels of the waters were seen and the the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke oh Lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils and he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many Waters how many can say Amen to that he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my Calamity but the Lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the CLE the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me for I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God for all his judgments were before me and I did put away his statutes from me I was also upright before him and I kept myself in my iniquity therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful with an upright man thou will show thyself upright and with the pure thou Wil show thyself pure with the frower thou will show thyself frower for thou will save The Afflicted people but will bring down high looks for thou will light my candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness for by Thee I have run through a troop and by my God have I leaped over a wall as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him for who is God save the Lord or who is a rock Save Our God it is God that girth me with strength and maketh my way perfect may God bless his word you may be seated tonight I just like to speak for a uh uh just a moment tonight on on breaking into the believer's position I believe we heard a direct word from the Lord that my brother made it in his family God bless you I believe we heard a direct word from the Lord last night on a direction on a direction of what God has in store for his people and is not to stay where we are but it's to come out a spirit of an exodus is to come out and and not only to just come out but also to go into so it's not enough just to step out into something he didn't just call us out of denominations to leave us where we were or to send us back to where we came from but he called us out of where we came from to take us to somewhere we've never been so you got to come out of something to go into something new and you got to leave something old behind to come into something new that God has in store for you he didn't just call you out of where you were to bring you in his church pew just to live a simple life just to be a regular believer just to just to sometimes enter into the glories but he called you out of the Meer of denomination that you can manifest The Works of his presence in this age I believe the direction was very clear last night and it was perfectly in line God bless you brother Isaac for what a a surrendered vessel I don't believe we were looking at a we're not looking at a rookie preacher here and I I don't say this to compliment the man but this is what the message does if you surrender yourself to the message this is what it produces it produces a man that will lay himself aside and will surrender to the anointing of God and only the message can produce that God doesn't come by just a nomination of fod but he comes by his word and his word alone and you can mimic a lot of things you can mimic emotion and you you can mimic uh you know a lot of different environments but you can't mimic when the angel of the Lord comes by CU everything's different when he comes by and I believe there were some witnesses here last night not just our pastor but I believe it was even in the congregation that witnessed the angel of the Lord last night moving and we don't lean to that but it sure is good to know he's in the camp it sure is good to know that he's amongst his people and he's not just here just to make a show but he's here to do a work in our lives he didn't just call us where we came from to leave us here but but he's got something in store for us and I believe that with the direction of the message in this hour we have a clear path of where we are going in this age we are not to stay in Leo DEA we are not to be lukewarm we are not to just uh uh deal with the situations that we've been given but Revelations 4:1 says and I looked and I was called up higher there's another door to enter into but we've got to take that step to enter into it now God broke open a way for them to come out of Egypt right but they had to take that first step into the Red Sea they had to take God at his word now he had delivered them out of Egypt and there was a Red Sea in front of them but they had to take God at his word where they would take the first step into those into those Waters they had to take a step and I believe that's where we're at tonight I believe we're taking a step into the land that God has has brought us to and said pursue the enemy take the land for it is a good land now you notice in the scripture that that every time God's people are persec Ed God comes on the scene every time there's a persecution you know Satan is is if I could just say it you know we we don't we don't let our kids use this word but I'm going to say he's stupid because he continues to persecute the people of God and he has not learned his lesson yet that every time God's people are persecuted God comes down on the scene every time that the people of God are up against a wall God breaks down walls and you see Satan would love to have us walled in with our own ideas or what we're allowed to do or what we're not allowed to do or what we're allowed to believe or not allowed to believe and you see every time we get backed up against the wall God comes and breaks the wall I like what brother Isaac said last night we're not chickens fenced in by walls but we're Eagles that fly over walls we can leap over walls we can run through troops we can do whatever the word says we can do and it's unlimited what we can do when we surrender ourselves to the anointing of this age we are not just we are not just believing some kind of denomination or some man's idea but this is a Vindicated message that will never be replicated it will never be reproduced it will never be mimicked but this is God's word and God's word is pure now now God will not just take any sacrifice into himself but he has to have a pure sacrifice the pure let the pure be pure right you know I think about it like this brother is was preaching on the fire last night and uh there at work a few weeks ago uh we were burning some trash from a job and and and uh and and somebody was throwing I won't mention names but somebody was throwing uh uh everything in the fire you know well it'll burn it'll burn you know and well the fire department came by sorry brother Jordan but the fire department came by and they just put out our fire they just open up a hose and just so I get a call from the fire marshal and he says you know hey you guys you're burning this fire over there and that could be uh you know we're going to get uh the uh EP PA involved and you guys are polluting the Earth and said well what can we burn he said pure wood say so as long as we put pure word on there we're good yeah well I thought about that last night I said there's only one fire that God accepts you he will not accept denominational fire or trash wood fire but he only accepts pure wood he only accepts a pure sacrifice he will not come down and bless just any fire he didn't come down and just bless any old fire but our God is a consuming fire to those who will approach the pure word with pureness of heart not with an idea of what they think it will be but let God be God and he'll come down and consume the fire I I thank God that he didn't send us into this age to break into something and not give us something to do it with but I would ask us tonight what is that in your hand I know it's a simple question but what is it tonight in your hand think about it every time in the scripture that a persecution was made God provided something a utens a tool a way out for those people to escape he didn't just leave them there but he sent something to them he sent a staff to Moses right what did he hold over the Red Sea it was his staff where did he get that staff well God gave it to him you could we could go down the list where did David get the sling where did shamgar get the ox go where did Samson find that jawone but you see God didn't just send us to an agent and say okay you're Overcomers but he gave us everything we need to overcome in this age we're not waiting for something to come I'm not waiting for another theology or another idea or another lecture on what the message can do but I believe the authority of the message has arrived I believe that we're in the age of adoption where we are have the authority of the word to speak and it shall obey us for who are we anyway but the adopted Sons and Daughters of God speaking his word and if he moved a mountain the same old sling will move it again tonight we just have to put the same word in our mouth of Faith every time God gives us a way out but every time persecution comes God will also come and I know there's some needs that have been on the hearts of the people and every time persecution comes God will also come well it hasn't broke yet God will also come well we're still up against the wall he'll also come every time that we're persecuted we can count on one thing God will show up he never leaves us he never forsakes us amen every time people are persecuted now think about this every time Steven was persecuted there was a Saul right right where did God show up yeah well they thought well Stephen was taken home God didn't show up in time but look at God's plan he would show up to the one that was persecuting them and he would come with the light out of the out of the out of out of the skies and turn Saul into Paul that's right so every time the people of God are persecuted God shows up on the scene he changes the situation so I thank God tonight that we're not empty-handed we're not empty-handed but he sent something to us in this age he sent a way for for us to break out of this situation he says this in the rising of the sun because I live you live also and I live in you and the works that I do the works that I do identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light at the evening time now the very essence of the message that was sent that he has risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we say we we his benificiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only amen we cannot do it by some tradition of man that's right we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting the people to Christ or can I say the message we're getting them to a church or to a theory but we must get them to the message he is the only one he's the only one that has life and he that has the son has life so he that has the message has life and I I don't want to go to another theory or a man's idea I've had enough of those days but I want the message and the message alone because that's what's going to set us free that's what's going to identify Us in this age can I say that's what's in your hand that's right this is not just some idea but what is that in your hand it's the message of the king you have the scepter of the king in your hand you're not wondering if it's the truth but it's been established and Vindicated that's the truth and I say it's time to take what's in your hand and go to the enemy and get back what he took from you [Applause] we could just we won't read it for time but you know it when when when David found himself coming into his C his camp and there was things that were taken from him yeah did he sing the wowy Woos maybe for a minute but what did he do yeah did he go try to seek someone somewhere no did he try to call the pope sir come on no did he need to wait for so and so to come back in the country no he encouraged himself in the Lord can I say he encouraged himself in the word he took what God gave him and he encouraged himself and he recognized who he was what he had been given and that his possessions had been taken from him and David didn't have anything more than he had when he walked into that camp but he had a different perspective of who he was and you may not have anything different tonight than when you walked in here but you can leave with a different perspective of who you are and the authority that you've been given you don't have to take what the devil gives you but you can take what God has given you in your hand and March to the enemy's camp and take back what the enemy has stolen from you maybe he's stolen your health take it back maybe he took your joy take it back maybe he took your experience take it back go to the enemy's camp and take back what he stole from you it's your possession it's your inheritance and thy seed shall possess the Gate of every enemy go to the enemy's gate and take it back that's what you're called to do you're not called just to be another wishy-washy believer I'm not preaching to make Believers tonight I'm preaching to real Believers I'm preaching to people who know who they are know why they've been sent and the message that they've been sent under and when they recognize this that's right he says what are we afraid about possess the gates we have God's promise yeah yeah we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels are encamped about everything is in order yes every wall can be took down you know why I don't like walls Mah cuz we're not chickens every wall can be took down it's already took down the son of God goes before us His Banner is waving and there is nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet a promise of God are you a saint tonight under God's blood you're a saint tonight there's a promise of God that's been given to you and there is nothing that can stop you from obtaining the promise that God has given you death can't stop it the Grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you friend's death is conqu for you unbeliever won't you receive him habits has been conquered for you temptation's been conquered you say I got a temper I can't get over it it's conquered he's already conquered it the great final Seed of Abraham there's no more conquering to do now he conquered it for us and now by his grace through his promise just believe and hold on I love how simple the message is just believe and hold on just hold on to the promise of God that he's given you I didn't give the promise brother Wayne didn't give the promise brother Brandon didn't give the promise but God Almighty gave the promise to the church if you will believe me and hold on every wall will come down amen that's all we do it's already finished our sickness our transgressions he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our pieces upon him and upon his stripes we were healed the great Royal Seed of Abraham his spirit is here tonight his promises are all true he fulfills everything that he said why is it that some setting to be healed and others will fall just because that you try to keep a little bit of the world around you he says turn loose everything church if I could compel us to do something tonight turn loose everything but this word be simple he says and look to God and believe it with all your heart and hold on to it it's got to come to pass God promised it and there's nothing that can keep it do you believe that tonight so God sent us his word in this age and he didn't just send his word but he sent benefits with it and he sent beneficiaries to receive of the benefits is that simple enough you're the beneficiary receiving from the benefits that God sent Psalms 103 would say bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits amen Amen in my Bible it kind of has one of those uh colons you know where it says it's a list right and then it's going to give you the list who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases how many diseases all of thy diseases how many iniquities all I love how I love how the psalmist wrote this under inspiration first he takes care he takes care of your of I'm not worthy because none of us are worthy David knew that better than anybody I'm not worthy to receive the benefits of God but it's not about how worthy you are it's about how worthy he is and David said he's the one who forgiveth all of thine iniquities every single one oh my hallah so the the devil doesn't have a hold on us there and then he says goes on to say all thy diseases all my dise I love how he says diseases he doesn't get down specific doesn't say cancers he doesn't say he doesn't say bodily diseases he doesn't say physical diseases he doesn't just limit it to spiritual diseases but he says all thy diseases so that takes care of the spiritual world the natural world anything that could be affecting you it takes care of it in there all thy diseases amen who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness watch the pattern of God's word first he takes you he saves you he cleans you and then you receive the blessings yeah that's right crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the [Applause] eagles hallelujah what a type what a type for us cuz I I don't know about you friends but I know if you've been walking this way a little bit you've been down in the dumps as an eagle you've been down low sometimes and you forgot that you're an eagle and you get down there and you get the wo is me and you get to discouraged and you forget that you once were up in the heavenlies and all of a sudden a man of God will come and create an anointing and you'll get under that anointing and you'll remember that you can fly and you know if you just if you just stay on that Revival though you'll find yourself back down in the valley but you know you can have your own Revival as an eagle you know that you can have your own anointing as an eagle and when an eagle and an eagle get together they just climb higher and higher and higher and higher why because it's what they're born to do they were not born to stay down amongst walls they were born to fly and when you get around that you know how it is when you get around a real good believer and it begins to energize something in you it begins to make you remember who you are anyway why are you here anyway well I'm a so and so or I'm a I'm a mechanic or I'm a barber I'm a that's not why you're here come on you're here to manifest The Works of Jesus Christ you're here to make Manifest this word you know why we believe this a lot of religions have books a lot of religions read books sure they have qurans and they have I'm sure Buddha has a book or whoever has a book and there's a lot of churches that have this book are the prophet of God say I'm not interested in reading a book right I'm interested in manifesting a book I'm interested in manifesting the promises of God and we're not just looking to argue quotes back and forth of who is right about this or who is right about that that doesn't make two sense to God what God wants is he wants a Believer surrender to his word that will come under the anointing of the hour and will make manifest the promises you want to please God make manifest one of his promises you want God to bless you say God make make manifest in my life he's not a man that he should lie but he is truth and his promises are yay and amen he's just looking for somebody who say I'm a promise of God I'll make manifest that promise but how could that promise of healing come L somebody were sick how could that promise of Deliverance come L somebody were depressed how could that promise of Salvation come L somebody were lost you see but we are Promises of God who said I will [Applause] go Isaiah 52 And1 would say awake awake put on thy strength oh Zion that's the bride but on put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem and the holy city for henceforth Thou shalt nor no more come into Thee the uncircumcised in the unclean Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion can we can we do a little definitions is that all right right I'm not much of a teacher but I do like the dictionary that word beautiful beautiful garments I'm not even going to try to say it in the Greek Beauty Splendor glory in attribute of God honor glorying boasting the glory of God what's the glory of the man all right that's you that's where you say that's me that word arise to rise arise stand Rise Up Stand Up to arise become powerful to arise come on the scene to be established be confirmed to be proven to be fulfilled to persist to be set be fixed to fulfill rise up to cause to arise raise to cause to stand set station established to come hither to be caught up I don't think you can make a better word for for what God is telling us in this age it's time to arise it's time to get out of the wowy Woos and arise to the glory that God has called us to we were not made to be down here below our privileges but we were made to arise Like an Eagle we were made to arise up out of our condition we were made to arise up above the turmoil of the world we were made to arise above gossip we are made to arise above sickness we are made to arise against competitive nature we were made to arise against temper we were made to arise against these things of the world you were called to rise the resurrection is a joint benefit with Christ arise that's our commission in this hour to rise above the world oh it gets us down but we're called to rise you think an eagle is just a type to be a type it's who you are you were called to Flap a little higher than where you're at right now you may think well I've reached the peak well bless God I have not I know I can be higher than where I'm right now I know that I can reach Greater Heights than I've achieved I know there's a greater faith for me that's just beyond the veil if I can tear down the veil of partition between me and my promise you see but this anointing breaks the veil this anointing tears down the veil and it's not just some sword that tears it down it's the Sword of Fire brother say it's the fiery sword of God that ripped that veil of the day on Calvary and there was The Mercy Seat in plain view God in plain view when the veil was R let me say tonight church this is God in plain view where are these promises they're right here amongst us where are the deliverances of God right here amongst us this is God in plain view you see well you're mighy or yourself no I know how how puny I am I know how big God is and God is so great and so big that he can come to me and make me one of his promises despite what I feel like look like my mistakes he can manifest his word in me that's how big my God [Applause] is that's our commission this age to make manifest looks unseen to the world but to those that have a trained eyej he says I want to ask you something upon this message now of looking at the Unseen if the Unseen will declare himself himself visible then to make your soul pass every barrier that's right yeah if the Unseen one will make himself visible here to you because he promised he would do it thank if the Unseen one comes I believe he he [Music] came for God so loved the world that he gave himself I'm getting a little ahead of myself but there's some things that God can't send someone to do he's got to go himself for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and the word became flesh and it dwelt among them so it was God in plain view once again it was God walking in flesh once again and where we had one that came to full maturity and then he he he went his way I must decrease so that you can increase the word had been deposited right right now you can't kill what's already been deposited the seeds already been placed it already been planted they could chase down every every disciple they could chase down every Apostle but they couldn't kill the seed that Christ had already planted they can they can just try to destroy the message they can try to tear it down they can try to tell you it's not true but you cannot destroy the seed that's already been [Applause] planted I don't believe the message lost any power in in in on December the 24th 196 5 but I believe the seed had been planted and God said all right the seed's there it's time for you the SE to come home you can't stop it it's already been in motion you cannot remove the life that God has planted there and what God has joined together no man can put us under because God put it together before the foundation of the world how the angel came to me how'd the angel come to you it was God Almighty in his grace and mercy [Applause] you think well my parents they they knew the message how'd they get it brother Josh how'd he come to you how'd the angel come to you you weren't looking for him but God knew your name before the foundation of the world and he sent a message to you he said I'll come to you right so you didn't do anything to earn this so then it's not based on your Merit it's not based on your worthiness right but it's God putting a plan in motion and there's nothing the devil can do to stop it but you see there requires something in our part that we have to fight through the Leo toan atmosphere that's on this age I don't know about you friends but I refuse to sit down and be called lukewarm I refuse to be spewed out of God's mouth it'd be better that I was never born than to be spewed out of God's mouth but I don't believe he called me this age to just be lukewarm stsy just hope something happens but I believe he called me to this age to be a manifested work of his promised word to us that we will overcome this age we will take another step out of leoda we are in it but we are not of it we are amongst it but we're not of it we are a bride called to a bride Age We Are eagles called to an eagle age we are Overcomers called to the age of the Overcomer we are we are a third pole manifestation called to the age of the third pole I love preaching at home cuz I don't have to worry I don't have to say is this okay is that all right cuz I know it is cuz I'm preaching to Believers hallelujah what do you think God wants from us in this age what do you think his desire is oh the King has a desire he has a desire from this age is to come out of her be not partakers of her what is it what was it that Christ hungered for on the cross I thirst he wants pure water what do that mean to us he wants pure worship he doesn't want man-made worship he wants pure worship and I believe God has called some people to the Earth in this age that will give him what he desires in this age is not going to receive vinegar at the cross there's a lot of denominations out there that think they're giving God water tonight but they're giving him vinegar one more time but I believe we're from a church a generation a time and an age and a dispensation that will not give him vinegar but we will give him the pure water of Bethlehem we will give him the pure water of Praise because we have been called in position here that he might be glorified in my lives what is my purpose here if it's not to praise God is it just to look like the world them blend in and occasionally witness to somebody or this no my purpose here is to be the manifested word in this hour that's why we're called here that's the anointing that we feel in this age that's why the message came God does not care what minister is right about what quote God never sent his word God never sent a man in 1909 and kept him from of sin kept him from cigarettes kept him from alcohol so that you and I can argue about what the seven seal is God did not take the time to vindicate a prophet like no other Prophet before so that we can argue about water [Applause] baptism so that we can argue about what the third pole is or it's for the bride or it's not for the bride it's in the message and if we would bow to the message we wouldn't bow to denominational ideas but there's only one person that deserves my praise it was it wasn't Billy Graham it wasn't or Roberts it wasn't brother brand it was God and God Almighty and I have been called and positioned here that I might give him praise hey there's a lot of rocks in this country I ain't letting one of them take my place I'm not going to let one of them move into my position because if I withhold somebody's going to take that spot but I've been called in position here to give him all my [Applause] that's why we're here he deserves it doesn't he oh my Fanatics oh yeah they'll call us Fanatics since when do we care what a bunch of uncircumcised unsaved Philistines care about us are we children of God or are we not are we called to a purpose or are we not since when do we care brother Justin what the world says about us but we are called to a higher place than they will ever even dream of who cares what anybody else thinks I care about what the word says about me and what I'm to do in this age and it says to give him praise I believe he's longing for it I believe he's desires for it right I believe he thirst for it there's a lot of Great Men in this world but the mic might say is there anything I can get you you might ask me for water sometime but the water that this one right you'll never thirst from again you might you might you might want to want to prop somebody up in your life you know respect you brother Aiden I might come your way sometime and say you know brother Aiden is there anything I can do for you say well just pray for me brother whatever it might be but what about God what about the one who's sitting on the throne tonight have we stopped and asked ourselves what can I do for you what can I do for the greatest of the greatest our champion the one who came to where we were and changed our situation who brought the Living Water to us what can we do for him and he has a request to us brother Carrie no matter what that request was we would do it no matter what it cost no matter what it called for we would give him what he has asked for and he has been thirsty in this age he's been fed a lot of denominational sacrifices thinking they're pring him but he's asking for a pure sacrifice he's asking for somebody who will Step Beyond the ideas of a man and will move into the holy of holies where it was a sin to move into the inner chamber now it's death if you don't move into the inner chamber you got to get into where the shikina glory is you've got to get into the believer's the believer's position that's our inheriting rights we were never made to be on the outside that's why you hate your life when you're just living a Leo toan way yeah that's why you can't get no satisfaction you have to drag yourself to church sometimes cuz you're living in the middle of Leo DEA when you were never called to be there you were never called to be a lukewarm or starchy or wishiwashi or or just a make believer you were called to be a genuine believer living in the holy of holies where the Shak of Glory Reigns that's where you were called to be that's who you are that's your position in Christ that's the dispensation of the word in this age no I won't be quiet because this is why I'm here that we might declare the works of God in this AG to say he is mighty I'm unworthy but he is [Applause] mighty oh my friends we're we're we're we're breaking into the age amen a seed's been planted but it doesn't stay in seed form right it was never the intention of of of the Prophet to leave us in seed form it was never the intention of Christ when he preached to his disciples to stay in SE form but it was to grow yes sir brother hallu wouldn't you do whatever it took amen well I've got to think a little bit differently okay my thinking never helped me out at all my thinking's never been the right way brother Chris it just hasn't I think sometimes this is the right way to do it no it ain't that's an easy one for me to surrender that's CU I already know I'm a doofus when it comes to thinking brother Bram said you don't got to think coming you gave it up you gave up your thought about it you gave up your idea about it you really think God needs our thought and our tweak on this oh yeah brother oh if you could get the Revelation that I'm getting yeah you know that brother Isaac he's just you know he I saw him do that double stomp last night and he's just immature if he had the real revelation of the hour it's in that still Small Voice where was the still Small Voice it came out of the fire so you can't apply that script RT unless there's a fire there that a still Small Voice could speak from I Believe In the Still Small Voice it spoke to me just a moment ago I believe in it but it has to come out of a fire and if there's no fire for it to come out of then I wouldn't trust the voice because only one thing can speak out of a fire and it's God and God Alone look where Moses met him and it was at the fire right look where Paul met him it was at the fire right there has to be a fire for that voice to come out there has to be something there that God can manifest himself through that his voice can come out and speak to you I believe that we should get away in secret in prayer and I I don't know why we're at home we're at home come on the still Small Voice has led me to where I'm at today but it came from the fire of God it came out of the fire of the word and it spoke to me and told me where I am and where I'm going I believe in that but I believe there's got to be a fire behind it to vindicate it AR you can't just throw that scripture and that quote and that scripture you got to have it all together we've got to come under this word or we're going to go the way of man I believe I believe we're there's some people going through some battles you might come to church and I appreciate the love that brother Ben let us let out we shake one another's hand man man it's good to see you it's good to see you you don't know it but that brother you're shaking a hand hand he could be going through a tremendous battle you put your your hug around him there could be a battle going on there you know why cuz we're all Warriors you may feel like you're not you might just be a mama somewhere but you're a warrior you're not in this age by chance right you're not in this age cuz it's a picnic but God made you a warrior in this age and I believe if he made you a warrior then he gave you a [Music] sword I believe you got a weapon in your hand tonight I believe the sword of the king came down to the prophet as an example of what the word can do in the hand of a Believer but I don't believe that that sword just stopped at the prophet but I believe that sword also fits us I believe if you reach your hand up in faith tonight and take the message for what it is you'll say it fits it fits my hand it fits me this is what I've been called for it fits this is who I am this is the sword of the king this is not a king sword this is the king sword this is not a message this is the message and it fits my hand it fits well now what did God send it for he sent it to go to war against the enemy of course God can defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any condition but he wants you to do it he wants you to take him at his word and defeat Satan everywhere that he's attacking you I believe I'm talking to some Mighty Men tonight oh yes you've been through some battles but let's go through one more together all right all right let's just put ourselves in the place of three men who went in battle because their King was thirsty and there David was after the battle he said I thirst but I don't just thirst for any water I want water from The Well of Bethlehem I want water from home I want water that'll satisfy this thirst within me you know what those men do they they said your request is our Command we will fight we will rage if we die so be in but we will bring you water tonight we will bring you praise tonight we will bring you what you've thirsted for I don't care how many Philistines are in the way we've been giving the king sword we've been given the sword of the king to go to battle and take back to bring praise back I'm not going to preach the quotes brother B says like this he said there was three of them only two of them had swords thank you brother Ben for being the other sword bear tonight I also have a sword tonight you know what we've been doing all night knocking down denominational Spirits you know what your job is tonight as the third person it's to carry the bucket it's to carry the bucket of Praise And while the swords are raging you carry the bucket of Praise You just carry that bucket of Praise all the way back to the king you've got to fight for it though you got to break into the reality ities of it say no matter how many denominational Spirits I have to cut down I will bring my king praise I will bring him the sacrifice of praise I will bring him Thanksgiving I will let the joy of the Lord be in my mouth I will not be identified by this age I've got the king [Applause] sword amen amen yes sir I think we draw it and we go to war can I borrow a quote from you we've got too many clean swords we've got too many clean swords in this age that have never tasted of cutting down a denominational Spirit we just take it for what it is oh well I'm told I got to do this and I'm told I got to do that no I've got a sword come on I think you've got the wrong guy tonight I've been giv the king sword and I know what to do with it and when the bride recognizes what she is and how he wants the word handled come on I think the devil's getting Mighty uncomfortable by now not anything I'm doing but you're recognizing something you're recognizing that you're not just here living a simple life just cuz but you've been given the authority greater than any age before you has been given to the people of God Like Us say oh Lord let this cup pass no I don't want this this cup to pass let your will be fulfilled in me this is my age and my time oh it's hard we've got to fulfill it right we've got to take the king of his word we've got to march on but he's provided the sword that we'll do it with that's he's provided everything around us that we need right this is not just a a on this is not just a temporary Revival under I'm at home he gave me liberty so I'm going to go ahead and handle this yeah you've seen false revivals before yes you've seen revivals built on false doctrines and on men and on kingdoms and on certain Ministries you've seen those revivals come and those revivals go and it's put a scarecrow in front of you that you're afraid to enter into this revival because you're afraid that it's another false Revival but this is the bride's Revival and it will not cease because this revival is not based on brother Wayne or Brother Ray or true word Tabernacle this revival is on the word this revival is what the king's message declared to this age it will not cease until the rapturing of the church this revival doesn't exhaust but this revival moves from meeting to meeting to home to home from Heart to Heart to Heart this is not my Revival this is the bride's Revival this is the King's Revival this is not man-made work [Applause] Cup this is the Revival of the King right you see what he's doing friends oh you think well you're a fanatic well I'm a fanatic whatever I do I guess but what he's doing micaah is he's building a fire in your life that you could throw the works of the enemy in the fire what was Paul doing when he was trapped on the island he was gathering sticks right that's right to stoke the fire oh you're just twitching the scripture does it say that or does it not he was gathering sticks to build a fire and while he was building a fire for God he was attacked by the enemy and you know what he did he threw it in the fire that he was building and you might be attacked tonight by a lot of different spirits of indifference but I say throw it in the fire that God's Building amongst us and let that snake die tonight and move on building the fire for God H is me I'm not going to use throw it in the fire well I'm not going to be that one throw it in the fire well nobody knows my name throw it in the fire well nobody knows I've been sick too throw it in the fire throw that snake in the fire tonight there's something to it oh yeah there's something to it but if he ever has those episodes again you take his shirt off and you throw it in the fire there's something to it friends there's got to be a fire to throw it in thank you brother Wayne thank you brother Ray for building a fire that I can walk in the house of God tonight and throw my snake in it just throw it in the fire tonight well I'm not sure just throw it in the fire amen God Specializes when things are thrown in the fire amen hallelujah can I get real simple for a minute three Hebrew children yeah yeah they would not bow down right to what a man-made image they would not bow down to a man-made image of what they were told you'll bow or you'll die you don't know it maybe but you've been told the same thing tonight you'll bow or you'll die every time God's children are persecuted he comes on the scene right BR says this in the super sa one time they had three of them down in Babylon in that big old city there and they was built a super City they had a a supernatural and they throw them in a super fire head seven times hotter than it ever was head and there was a supernatural sign of a supernatural God standing in the fire supernaturally saving them did you count how many times I said Supernatural and what did they do they possess the gates of the Furnace what are you going to name it [Applause] tonight maybe it's not a furnace to you maybe your furnace is out at home and it's really Ren me tonight but I doubt that I believe your furnace has the name of depression I believe your furnace has the name of anxiety I believe your furnace has the name of uh of uncertainty of where you're going of confusion of the age but I believe it's time to face the furnace tonight amen amen their enemy he says watch how God I don't know how much this quote I read but it's so good I wish you would take the time to read it it's out of uh it's out out of uh I'm looking for it not my hairline show us the father and his suffices God himself coming down there's a lot of there's a lot of things that God will send somebody to take care of but there's some things he's got to come himself there's some situations that he holds back the angels and he comes down himself says one day there were some people down there trusting God's word down in Babylon let's just watch this for a few moments am I okay oh I could see a great thing happening there had been an issue made and that nobody would down there begin to worship any other God or didn't bow down to what the government said or would have to be thrown into a fiery furnace and there was three boys there Shadrach Meshach and abedo they decided they was not going to bow down to any image they were going to serve the true God they believed his word notice they found out that these boys they wouldn't bow down so they had the furnace uh uh uh according to the king's Commandments seven times hotter than it ever was had if there's a type that does not need explaining this is us we'll burn that religion out of him that's quote we can't you can't burn the holy ghost out of a man well this fire is getting too hot you can't burn the holy ghost out of a man well it's a little too radical to me you can't burn the holy ghost out of a man you can turn this fire up seven times but you cannot kill a Holy Ghost filled man because he was birthed in the fire he was birth in a fire to start with and that's where he's at home he can't kill it because that's where it comes from it's the Holy Ghost and Fire and [Applause] it's why it's fire itself you can't burn [Applause] it there's too much too much man came here at the temple the other day and place and said well brother started to give him a card down there and he was laughing some of the ministers was telling me about it said I come to get my fortune told oh my they thought John was Bewitched Bewitched the greas he it wasn't John bewitching the greas it was the Holy Ghost had him bound up the Greece couldn't burn him these Hebrew children believing God's word they say God is able to Deliver Us from the fiery furnace but nevertheless we're not bowing down to your image oh if we could just get some Shad rcks in the building tonight that's where you come in friend that's where you come in brother John I'm a Shadrack I'm a Shadrack tonight if we could just get some Shadrack in the building said I don't see no difference in you maybe some of you got prayed for here last night and the devil's saying I don't see no difference in you go over there and somebody prayed for you I don't see no difference he said you could say what you want to but I'm not bowing down to your unbelief [Music] you can say what you want to about the way we worship Our God but I am not bowing down to your unbelief and the devil can come raging against you and say you've been prayed for you've been prayed for you've been prayed for but I am not bowing down to your unbelief Satan but I Take God at his word I'm taking him at his word he said God's word is right let every man's be a lie and let God's word be the truth that's oh he this am he says all right then I'm going to skip through some of this he says I getting ready to heat the furnace and bring out meach and Shadrach and bound their hands behind them three men with long Spears began to March them up and they went into the top of the Koopa to drop them in my don't you think that when when you take Christ as your savior as your healer that the devil won't put the heat on you he sure will yes sir just watch him remember I've been I've warned every one of you within 7 2 hours what would take place the Bible said when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man he walks in dry places and returns again with seven other Devils be careful let the good man of the house be standing there with faith Waring him away telling him he can't come in refuse to see it refuse to have it or anything else and stay right with it amen they started a death march going on there they're going to burn up these loyal Believers in God that's trust is God's word they're going up to be burned up they walk up you know what I can hear Shadrach say to me Shack are you sure we're all prayed up I can hear him say yes I got the victory let's go on that's the way to do it March right on just a little farther kept going they almost got there they began to get a little faint and I can hear them say all right are you ready now yes we're ready these fellows pushing them holding their heads back get right up just one more step and away they go down into the fiery furnace to be consumed while the men that was standing plump behind them died of the intense heat the length of the spear probably half of that polar more behind them died go to show that God was right with them on the March he'll be right with you from this night on when you take him at his [Applause] word just stand on his word and believe he's in his word and in his son here they go marching on right up the bridge watch one more step here they go and our picture looks pretty dark now for the Believers doesn't it he says let's turn our attention to Heaven A believer's perception there may it may appear to be more of them than there is of us but if we turn our attention to heaven and we begin to take the scales off our eyes and we begin to look through a supernatural lens we begin to see the heavenly vision of where we're standing and I just look at this scene brother BR dramatized it so I'm going to do it the same and and and and there they are in heaven and the angels are stirred up Benjamin they're stirred up those are God's children down there them boys have stood for him let me go come on let me go at him how many of you have felt that same it's not a bad feeling yeah oh the children of God are sick let me go but some things God handles [Applause] himself I've been zealous before let me go after him I feel like I'm in Michael's position sometimes let me go he says no Michael I said you down over this situation and when Daniel Prayed and this situation and wormwood said oh it's my time another anti deluvian wash it's a fire it's a perfect scene I'll come down I'll rain upon them no wormwood no you can't go you're just going to let him die can you imagine brother Taz what it is in heaven when God's on his throne and the the angels are in that room and they can't even look at him are you going to go and when he begins to take a step said this job I'm coming down myself Hallelujah yes you're mighty one oh yes yes you're Holy One oh yes what are you going to do with those Believers down there in that last age when the devil's Waring against him and he's putting cancer on their minds cancer in their bodies he's putting he's putting depression like he never has anxiety pressure like he never has he's attacking the church at every front Financial issues disparity issues all just just hurt feelings everywhere what are you going to do stand by Michael yes sir stand by Gabriel stand by this job I'm coming down to handle myself this job I'm going to manifest myself again that I will come down to their situation and where they're at and the prophet of God says he gathered the wind from the East and the west and the North and the South and he gathered all of the Winds of the Earth with him and he came down to that furnace oh you don't think God likes the fire well he faned himself Jacob he faned himself on he controls the winds don't lose patience when the Revival seems to be a little low he controls the winds he decides the seasons he decides when it's high and when it's low and sometimes we go through a low season but I feel the abundance of rain I feel the change in the wind I feel the wind stirring from the East and the west and the North and the South I believe he's gathered together The Winds of the earth you might be that southern wind brother Carrie I might be that western wind but he's gathered together the winds to come together for a purpose he's gathered us together to come together that we might St stoke the fire I see another one we know the story I see another one in there why is there four well I thought it was just justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost why is there four because when these three come and United under the word the fourth one comes I see one like under the son of man and he's in the midst of the fire how did King Nebuchadnezzar know what the son of man look like but it had to have been a revelation to him that that being standing in that fire is not just a man but there's something about that being standing there that is greater than any man could do he is pushing back the Flames of Leia he is pushing back the Flames that would keep you in disparity he is pushing back sickness in your body he's pushing back yeah he's pushing back cold lukewarmness he's pushing it back I say Let the Fire Burn Let the Fire consume every every enemy tonight because there's a fourth one with us manifested sons of God are not afraid to enter into every blessing that God's given [Music] them believe that's that's who you are tonight I believe that's who you are I believe death can't stop you brother said notice all the glory that is in God is in the word all the glory is in the word what did he send to us in this age his word you see what I mean but it's all in Christ all that God was he emptied himself kosis he came into Christ and we came behind him but you got to break through that you got to break through that it made it to the scene it made it to the scene he sent his word to us right brother I didn't write that down here can you give me that Psalms uh 107 he sent something to us oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good yeah for his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered them from out of the hands from the East and from the west and from the north and from the south yeah yeah and and wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way or or in another version it would say a desert yeah they found no City to dwell in yeah have you ever been there no in sir yeah no Fellowship to dwell in yeah yeah hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses and he LED them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful words to the children of menen Amen thank you Lord for he satisfy the longing soul and fill the hungry soul with goodness such as it is in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in afflictions and iron because they rebelled against the words of God and and condemned the Council of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labor and they fell down and there I can't even see fell down there was none to help and they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble than you Lord amen and he saved them from from out of their distresses he brought them out of the darkness in the shadow of death and break their bands in Su God oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he had broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron and suer fools because their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abh horth all man of mean and they draw near unto the gates of death then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them I don't care what you've been through I don't care what it took for you to get to this moment they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he said his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destructions he didn't just send you here to this age alone he sent his word he sent his word amongst us he sent himself amongst us he didn't just s an idea he didn't just s an angel he sent himself he came himself and he came to me when I could not reach him he came to where I was John come up a little higher break into the bride's possession break into the living realities break into the third pole reality it wasn't just to teach about it was to [Applause] live this is our age brother Ben if you come this is our time he sent his word to you to your address to your street to your situation been in their distresses Hallelujah shouldn't I be past this sh why am I always distress Zoe even in your distress he sent his word you cried un to the Lord and what did he do he came to where you [Applause] were oh the devil would like to tell you where is not as good as a Christian as you should be because you're in distress oh no I'm in distress that I might make manifest The Works of my God because he's a deliverer he's an overcomer he comes on the scene when I call him he changes the atmosphere he changes everything about my life he changes the scene and when the scene changes I look with a different perspective I can see with new eyes I can see with more clarity my vision has become open when he comes down to my scene hallelujah oh you don't need to go back and you're not you're not here because you're in trouble you just need a scene change you just need a theme change amen we're walking under adoption yeah this is the third pole amen it was not meant to stay in seed form that's righten he says all this is it I could quote out of perfect Faith he said here it is this is what we've been waiting for this is what I've longed to see this is the third pole he says it's just beginning to bloom yeah it was a seed yeah but we're not babies anymore we're not Pentecostal babies anymore but the seed has come to maturity the seed is recognizing its position the seed has recognized it's got a checkbook in its hand and it can sign for every Redemptive right that Christ gave to the church is your access tonight you're not asking for anything that God didn't already give to you it's a free possession he so loved you that he gave all of his benefits and all of his glory is in that word and so let the glory of God tonight let his fire consume this sacrifice tonight let God's glory take over every situation he is able he is great and greatly to be praised [Music] amen amen I know many of you have been through some situations you've got a big bucket you've gathered a

Christ's blood if we could fill the sea with his atoning grace no can we exhaust what God has given to the church right this is a reality friends amen this is why we believe this is why we leave
