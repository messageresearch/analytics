from our home church and for the Tim Pruitt and my father and amen this let's just have a wonderful weekend in the Lord amen how many come to get something from God how many come expecting to get something from God well then you're going to leave with what you expected amen so I hope you come with your your buckets and your everything you can get to just get all you can get I believe we ought to be some stingy people when it comes to getting something from God I want it all amen I want everything that God has for me and and uh amen God bless you today Genesis 1 Amen in verse 14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so Matthew chapter 4 and verse 16. says the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at ham amen we'll let you be seated today amen I last year I spoke on light and this year I'm going to speak on light I've been speaking on light for some time and but God is light it's kind of inexhaustible subject because that's who God is he's God is Lighting in him there's no Darkness at all amen but I like to just start this meeting out on LA on the light brings change amen I I believe that today as we read here um in our scripture about light and we could go back toward to the first verse of Genesis chapter one it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light so we find the Earth was without form in other words it was considered something of no value it was a place of waste a Barren place it was a place of Darkness this void means it was an empty space needed needing to be filled but God didn't leave it in the condition that he found it amen but he began to begin to speak his word and as he spoke his word the spirit of God began to move and it began to bring his word to pass and and you know because God didn't want to leaving in that condition God desired to create a need and he desired a man for there to be more upon the Earth and just a void or an emptiness but he wanted to guard in there and so he had seeds that were laying there in that Earth and he wanted them to come to life and so in order to bring this change upon the Earth he had to create light and light began to shine and change and it began to change the look it began to change the feel it began to change the landscape of the Earth because when light comes it changes things amen when light begins to Dawn and begins to move it changes things and and I just want to go through the scriptures here tonight about the change that light has made and I'm not of course going to hit every one of them but God has always used light to Mark a change amen you know in the in the burning bush came down there was a prophet that had been told he was a prophet all of his life and and he had he had he had been born a prophet he would been told he was a prophet often but you know we tried on his own to to do some things but on his own he just was able to kill two Egyptians and so he finds himself out on the backside of a desert and he's out there for years and seemed like the promises is long forgotten and his long past and it's over but one morning the prophet of God said he got up and it began to walk down this path that the Sheep would walking down and hit as he's walking down that path he began to see something over there on the side of the Hill there was a bush that was on fire but it didn't burn and he said God began to pull him to that place because God wanted to make a change amen here he had tried on his own many times and he had done all that he had could but he had all he could do is produce two dead Egyptians but God wanted to come and show him who he was really was and what he had called him to be and he brought him to this place and he brings him to this life and he said as he was thinking on his way there began to be a crackling on the side of the Hill that caught him his still caught his attention and he moved and when he did he went to that place and a voice spoke out and he said Moses take off your shoes because you're on Holy Ground and that voice began to reveal to him who he really was and that light began to change him and it changed him so much that he would leave that place and and he would go down and gather his wife and his children and his his donkey and his rod and he would go down to Egypt and brother Randall said it was quite a paradox because here but here comes a man going down to the greatest army that it was ever on the face of the Earth at that time and you would ask him where are you going Moses and some going down to Egypt to take over and something had changed him he was backside of the desert scared and out of the will of God but amen the light of God came down and it changed his life so much and it gave him a message that he believed and he began to go and he said I'm going to go tell Pharaoh let my children go and that light came down down to produce a change amen and it began it made such a change in his life that he went to pharaoh and he spoke to pharaoh and he said I got a message for you and God spoke to me let my children go and and you know Pharaoh hardened his heart and we know all the story of the ten plagues but amen there came a time that they left out of there the scripture says with a high hand and they're on their way down and they're on their way to Victory seems like and they're again there's a shout and there's a voice of Triumph and there's singing and dancing but all of a sudden there's a Red Sea in their way and they're wondering well God did you bring us out here just to die you know did you bring us out here just to drown was there no graves in Egypt was there no place somewhere else we could be buried but God had a had a plan and God was bringing them to a place not for their demise not for their defeat amen not for them to go down into death but for their enemy to die amen I love how God does things amen he don't bring you to your trials or to your situation or to the problems of your life and the things that you go down for your defeat no all things are working to the good to them that are thee called amen he's bringing you to a place not for your defeat not for your demise but for your enemies to feel amen and we can read in the scriptures as they come down and they begin to cry out and they heard these chariots come behind them in the Red Sea before them the scripture says that the pillar of fire lifted up and it moved between them and their enemy amen it became their goal between her or their stand between as it stood there and the prophet of God said that light is still here and is standing between you and your disease it's standing between you and your sickness is standing between you and your trouble amen is there declaring there is a change that has taken place there's something that's going to happen and I believe that light is still Among Us I I'm one of those people that still believe the pillar of fire is still Leading the People of God I still believe that he's moving he's directing he's these ways orchestrating sometimes we think we're doing something sometimes we think we're making decisions and sometimes we think the devil's doing something no God is in control of every situation he is still leading by a pillar of fire that Pillar of Fire has not left the children of God but it is still Among Us it's still leading it's still guiding and is still standing between you and your enemy hallelujah amen as they come there he he began to speak to them he said he said speak to the children of Israel and he and and the light goes let me go find this pot right here he says Moses said to the people of Israel fear not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians you have seen today you'll see them again no more forever amen the Lord shall fight for you amen and he showed it very quickly he went and put himself in the fight he said if they're going to get to you they got to come through me amen if they got there if they're going to get to you and they're going to come at you they got to come through me first the prophet of God said it that way he said you let that that old devil get after one God one of God's children he's got Jesus Christ on his hands I want you to understand young people you may feel all alone you may feel like you've been fighting this battle by yourself but you're not alone there is a pillar of fire that is standing around you and is standing between you and your enemy Hallelujah and he's here for a change amen amen and I'm telling you right now he said the Egyptians you see today you'll see no more forever and you know I I thought that was quite something because you read a little bit later they see them and the Bible says they see them on the on the on the edge of the water later in the it fakes down in the water you know they see them he said they wasn't going to see him but the Bible says they saw him but what was it the same Egyptians that had breath they didn't have breath no more they didn't have the ability no more to pick up a whip to tell them to make one more brick to do one more day of slavery they had lost all their power Hallelujah I'm here to tell you by the time this meeting is over the Egyptian that's been against you you'll see him no more forever that pornography will lost lose his power then we'll be broken off your lies cause there's a lake and it's causing a change amen depression is going to lose this grip anxiety is going to lose this grip powers of hell is going to lose this grip it's not going to be able to pick up a whip one more time and say make another Bridge look at another website do another thing it don't have no power no more because the light has come down and it's standing between you and your enemy Hallelujah I like that kind of stuff I like hearing my enemies demise yeah I mean he's been he's been telling you all week or all month or all year you're about to go down you're about to be finished you ain't gonna make it another time or another day he's a lot of it some of you he told you wouldn't make it to this Youth Camp but you're here [Applause] amen some of you told you you wouldn't make it another month but you're here some of you told you wouldn't make it amen through your trial but you're still here [Music] amen but let's tell the devil what his future is he wants to always tell you about your future and you're not going to make it in the bride you're not going to be in the bride the Rapture is not for you well just tell him what his future is devil your Future's in hell your future is under my feet damn future my future is in glory shouting on the heels of Glory your futures in hell cause there's a light that's leading me there's a light that's god in me there's a light that's moving Among Us I mean I'm here to tell you he's here among us tonight and he's moving down the aisles of every heart if you'll just open up your eyes say God open my eyes maybe you want to be like that servant say God there's more maybe you've been saying there's more against me than there's for me amen but there's a word here that said hey open their eyes let them see around there's Chariots of Fire and angels of fire that have been around this building and they've been around here and they've been waiting for this moment they've been waiting for that depression to walk in here they've been waiting wave beaters to walk in there they've been waiting for that cancer to walk in here they've been waiting on it I got a red a Red Sea for that one I had a destruction for that one I got a lot of power for that one I got a death for that one there's a light and it's bringing a change amen it was angels of God that showed the light on the hills of Judea and to the Shepherds and Amen brother said it was that guide the Shepherds to Eternal Light see life only comes by light the Shepherds wanting to you know when the king is born they have singing and carrying on the king is born he was so secretly born born in a stable in a Manger where there's cattle and horses were eating but yet he was a king but the Angels came down and a light sewn down out of heaven and said today in the city of David in Bethlehem is Born the Christ the Savior and the angels had the word and the word came by light to guide the Shepherds to the light yeah and they followed him they followed that word of the angels to the eternal life and they found the baby they're wrapped in swaddled in clothes why was that light sin for why was that light hanging over Bethlehem for that Drew those wise men it was speaking of A change is coming it was saying sin is about to lose his power sin and held men and held them into such a place David would say take not the Holy Spirit from me you know he would say Lord I'm going to put Thy Word of my mouth oh my eyes on my bedpost and the next thing you know he was out there uh cheating on cheating on his way you know getting another man's wife and all these things and he said created me a clean heart he had a lamb but that lamb that blood of that woolly lamb could not take the desire out of his life but there was a light that came said I'm declaring A change is about to take place then it's going to lose his power over lives forever [Applause] amen that there's going to be a blood once offered and be once offered and forever everyone that wants to be saved of blood that will not lose his power [Applause] a blood that's strong enough to cover you this weekend and you'll be here the next camp are you being in that service and you'll still be serving God there is a blood that's powerful enough we got people today think the blood ain't powerful enough to take sin out of lives and take the take the the longings and the desires of flesh out listen there's a blood that's powerful enough and it'll never lose its power [Applause] this blood still has enough power to save every sinner to heal ever sick this blood has enough power to raise the dead this blood has enough power amen there's a light that declared it it's about to change [Applause] Mary was on the road to the well thinking on some things maybe she didn't have to take a bus to that well maybe she walked but maybe there's some Mary's this weekend took a bus or a van on their way down to a well thinking on things and thinking about scriptures and brother Brown said all of a sudden a light began to flash in front of her and out of this light so that light began to whirl and it got bigger and it got bigger and he said all of a sudden now that light stepped an angel I wonder how he knew that because he experienced that he knew exactly what took place and now this light steps an angel he said I wonder how little Mary felt did you ever think of that I wonder if she felt as scared as I did yesterday Hail Mary hell means to stop and pay attention to what I'm about to tell you hell young people you've been busy about to go back to school just stop for a minute and pay attention to what's about to be told you amen blessed art thou among women for you have found favor with God and you're going to be a child have a child knowing not a man but the holy spirit is going to overshadow you he said what was it it was a light that came to declare a change she said how will these things be said I know not a man he said the Holy Ghost is going over Seattle the holy thing to be born of you will be called The Son of God he said let's go for say what they want to she knew it she knew it would be why because God Said So how she must have felt that day of the dedication or the coming circumcision for the baby well she walked up with that little baby in her arms all them women keeping her distance neither all them moving away but she had two little turtle doves cleansing for her own purification this little baby wrapped in swaddling cloth made a yolk off the back of an ox's neck wrapping it on the back of the ox and just swaddling cloth in the manger they had nothing for him they were too poor but here she stood and no doubt all the women kept their dismissy there she got an illegitimate child see there they're just a bunch of Pentecostals see there bunch of worked up emotions see there what they fail to see is the light that's Among Us what they failed to see was the light that visited Mary they wanted to call an illegitimate child and say it was of the devil come on somebody amen that's exactly what they want to call this move of God but they they didn't brother branham's day they wanted to call what he had the devil those Devils never die those Spirits never die don't think we're going to get away with it no they're going to call what we got the devil they're going to call it all kinds of names of what so-called slander ain't gonna call it Pentecostal they're going to call it emotionalism they're going to call it all kinds of things let them call it what they want to call it I got Jesus I met the angel I met the lie and it caused the change in my life they can say what they want to say Hallelujah they can call me what they want to call me I could care less as long as he's called me he called my name and that's all that matters [Applause] no doubt I was calling it it'll it'll give him a child see how God makes things so radical looking quote see how God makes things so radical looking he just pulls a wool right over Satan's eyes and Satan said how filthy how dirty adultery that's what she is he's an adulteress that didn't stop that beat in little Mary's heart oh they kept their distance from him do you see who they were really rejecting it wasn't Mary they were rejecting him it isn't you they reject they reject him amen he said call him now oh you say well that's just you but let me tell you what brother Brown said I finished the quote that kept us distance from him and they're still doing the same thing they call him now a Holy Roller a fanatic but Mary knew whose baby that was Hallelujah Mary knew she didn't receive this from a man she knew she didn't receive this from from just a mortal human being no she had received this from the Holy Ghost something that moved inside of her and meant again that it was a miracle that took place [Applause] Miracle until you become a miracle you will never understand the supernatural until you become the supernatural you will never understand the things of God until you become a thing of God until God comes and changes your life [Applause] Hallelujah on the day of Pentecost there was a light that showed up when the Holy Ghost had come direct quote the Bible says that any Prophet said it Isaiah says precept must be upon precept lying upon line here a little there a little hold fast to what is good for the stammered lips and with other tongues well I speak to the it's amazing message preacher don't quote that very much stammering lips and other tongues while I speak to those people and this is the rest this is the Sabbath that I'll give to you in all this they were not here they walked away wagging their heads this is the prophet of God isn't it they walked away wagged their head whacking their heads and went on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon those people they acted like drunk men and women under the impact of the Holy Spirit walked out and wagged their heads and said these people are drunk they're full of new wine but it was absolutely the light the word that had been prophesied was now made manifest [Applause] did you read where also he said God doesn't change his pattern this is the first surface don't worry light changes things you know it was Georgia Carter one time had found herself in a really bad place on a bed for a year what a seven eight nine years what was it nine years to where she'd rub the post almost the paint off of them brother Branham sees a vision or I can't remember dream vision of a lamb that was caught in a Thicket and he hears this bye bye Middletown what had happened she had got a pamphlet of something of another girl that had been healed and she said if God could heal that girl God can heal me and she began to cry out now she was in a family that did not believe they didn't believe in that God they didn't believe God there was in a church and didn't believe yeah we we sometimes find ourselves in those places families that don't believe churches that don't believe but that don't mean God doesn't do what his word said he would do he just looking for a heart that will believe no matter how bad the situation is no matter how bad it's been do you believe and he goes to asking around where's Milltown now Milltown ain't but about 20 minutes or so by car from where he was at but that you know today is a lot different it was yesterday you know they didn't go very far from their house they didn't know they didn't have Google Mr or Mrs Google they have none of it and so he didn't know where Milltown was we asked around finally somebody told him he goes up there and starts having a meeting and finds it you know the story anyway he sees her and finds her but in fact the family didn't want him to be there so he's out crying about him praying about and he says you know he said I got in the place and I began to pray and he said you know those Briars they started sticking and I'd move over this way and bugs start biting me and I saw he said that's just the way the devil is he comes when he knows God's about to do something he comes and bites you like a little mosquito and he's tormenting your mind and he's telling you it ain't for you ain't no way you're going to get Deliverance this weekend that just means you're about to be free and here he is praying and he said but if you could just press through and tonight if you you say brother Timothy this is the first I don't care what night it is if you could just press through press through the stickiness and the weirdness and all that stuff hey look I got to get to Jesus and if I can get to him on the first night I'll have me a short enough camp hallelujah amen Jesus don't show up just on the third night or the last service he's here tonight after nine after nine he just needs somebody that'll push through the awareness that'll push through the stickiness that'll push through those old Briars and that's Satan poking you and saying get up and go to the bathroom talk to your neighbor do this and he's trying to distract you meanwhile the light starts whirling all of a sudden he said I saw a light whirling and out of that light spoke a voice and said go by the way of Carters Dave and hear this girl this girl had a disease caused by this brother random call it being ravaged by her uncle on the way to a piano lesson Satan's a terrible terrible terrible person she gets this disease on the way to a piano lesson and here he comes and we know the story he walks in that room and begins to speak to her and the voice began to speak and says Rise Up In The Name of Jesus he said I didn't know how it could happen he said I just know what the voice said and that little old bony girl got up about 30 something pounds got up and began to go out and bless the grass and the trees and Shout come back in you know what she started doing playing the piano the very thing that would have called should have caused hurt and should have caused I don't ever want to do that no more because every time I do it causes me to have feeling no it has all been taken away from her Hallelujah that's the light that is Among Us he can come over your life and in a moment take away all that bitterness take away all those hard feelings and that unforgiving spirit and remove it as far as the East is from the West the light brings change Saul on the road to Damascus going to put the Believers in Chains in prison and to persecute them to persecute the Church of the Living God a light began to shine on him knocked him off his high horse knocked him down in the ground the Bible says he fell on the earth and he heard a voice saying Saul Saul why persecuted thou me well I was going to go get Peter and I was going to go get this one and that one I didn't know I was doing it to you Lord who art thou Lord and he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecuteth the light changed him from Saul to Paul he went from being the persecutor of the church to the messenger of the church [Music] oh my God this light brings change you can go from the bar room to the front pew people think sometimes when they come from places of great sin and great difficulties that when they come to the house of God all these people must have been angels all their life no sir we was ever one the same way we ever won was lost and Gone without God the same way but God rich in Mercy Shine the Light down on our heart and it changed us in that same light can change you this evening Hallelujah Peter was in the jailhouse one time two men by a side and two by the door amen the devil really wanted to keep him in that jailhouse he wanted to keep him bound really good he wasn't going to let him out but you know what happened everybody's a Believers over in the house begin to pray and they begin to pray for that car that was headed towards camp and said God you see that girl it's in that prison go get her you see that boy in that prison go get him May the angels of God go to where they're at and begin to move down the aisles and release them of that trouble release some of that trial release some of that pride and begin to pull your spirit out upon them that's what the scripture said it said the light came into the room where he was and it smoked Peter on the side and said get up [Applause] that light came and changed his position it chasing from bound to Freed it changed him from ill I descended to a saint that light has come this weekend and it's going to change your position some of you walked off those Vehicles so bow down there was one on the devil on each side of you and it was positioned on one behind and one in front of you and said in this service you ain't getting free ain't no way I'm letting you go I ain't no way you're gonna be free but the light begin the world and it began to come down into a meeting and it smoked you on the side and it said get up and when you got up your chains fell off Hallelujah your depression fell off your anxiety fell off those spirits that was trying to hold you they lost their power and the scripture said that light led him to the first the second into the third gate [Applause] that light will lead you all the way it'll lead you through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost all into everything God has for you that light will not leave you or forsake you but it'll change you it'll change you look at Moses in the scriptures every time he came before that light they couldn't hardly look on his countenance because it had changed him that light led him out to freedom and the light's going to lead somebody out to freedom in this meeting how maybe I could say it like this somebody's [Music] maybe you come out of here dead but he's a resurrection and the life maybe you come in here bound but he has Freedom there's nothing like the freedom of the Holy Ghost listen it might be man's Creeds that put bindings on you but there's a light that can break every one of them there's a light that can shine down into the darkest of caverns [Applause] you may think you're so dark and you're so far away there is no Darkness too great for this light there is no Darkness you have not went too far that's a lie of the devil I said it's a lie of the devil that wants to tell you it went too far and you send your day of Grace away that's a lie of the devil I'm going to Smite it to somebody Rises up against it and says I'm free that is a Lie the devil he wants to put on your life but you're here today and God is still pulling on your heart darkness comes in the darkest of moments light comes and illuminates it it led Luther out of the Catholic Church like did it led Wesley to where he was to preach the truth no matter what they face light came in this day if anybody ought to believe in light we ought to believe in light [Applause] light came in this day it came in a little cabin up there in Kentucky when a little baby was born in a world it world over a little crib it was a light that would come in a cabin up there in Indiana and it would come down to to come and out of that light it would step out of man about six foot tall 200 pounds and show hair down to his shoulders and all of complexion and it would begin to tell him why he was born the way he was and why he was here and what his ministry was to be and how what he experi had been experiencing experiencing was not the devil his peers wanted to tell him it was the devil that's the devil that's doing that to you William random that's the devil and he he finds out no he wasn't the devil it was God that had been showing me those things it was the light same Pillar of Fire how that he had been experiencing what he had been experienced was not the devil as some were saying but it was a light the pillar of fire the light would come into His service time after time and nothing could stand in his way it could reveal the very secrets of the heart it wasn't William Branham that could do that it was the light that could do that it was the angel he'd say he would begin to talk he said now you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on him if he doesn't come I'm helpless but if he does and if I have told the truth if I have what I've said to be the truth he will come and all of a sudden he's saying now he's here and I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God what was it it wasn't William Branham it was the light [Applause] it was a light that new addresses it was a light that knew what was the problems it was a light that knew I was a sin it was a light that would illuminate a young man and say hey you got cigarettes in your back pocket if you'll get rid of them God will heal you yeah man the like can expose a lot of things now the devil don't like light the devil don't like no light around here we don't care what the devil don't like amen I love

here this evening there's enough light in this building that'll drive every devil out of here there's enough light in this building that'll take every Devil's subject this light I'm talking about showed up in a meeting in Houston Texas yeah it was on Mr best you know y'all can be seated I ain't doing it's all Mr best he he wanted to show his stuff he was all learned he had it all figured out he had all the knowledge he knew more than anybody did oh brother Bosworth said brother Brown if you ain't gonna talk to him let me he said well I don't want to argue so I ain't gonna argue I just got one thing to say and that one little statement he made tied Dr best up so much he couldn't even hardly blubber is Jehovah the Old Testament the Jesus of the new goodbye That's all folks he couldn't say a word you know brother Randleman went to that meeting he was up in the up in the back sitting back there and he was not going to go up to the front his wife was sitting by him telling you don't you go up there brother but he said all of a sudden there was he had heard that noise before and he said he said hear the voice said get up and go up there he said he started to rise and his wife says honey don't don't grab his hands don't go up there said I said sweetheart just a moment it's the angel of the Lord his brother said oh Bill you're not going down there you can't said I said Howard just just stand aside son the angel Lord's telling me to go down there ushers began to throw their hands together and make a line he walked down he says he'd hired Dr best you know had hired some photographers to come over there and hired a commercial photographer in the Douglas Studios to write them if you want to find out about it connected different ones he said he'd hired Mr kipperman in different ones he said I he said I begin to talk he said don't think anything harder Mr best I don't think he was he was he was sincere to look down those roasts I did think he was sincere to he looked down to those row of stretchers and cots and things laying there these people there with cancer and heart trouble going to be dead in a few days if God doesn't help them the doctors give up on them they've done their very best they can do and they can't do no more I believe he was sincere till he said that he felt sorry for those people he can't feel sorry for those people and then robbed them of the only hope they have of living how can you feel sorry for them like taking food away from a starving man I said their sets their comrades sitting back there who was in their condition just a few days ago and Dr statements now say they're healed anyhow he come running the platform said Branham and said yes sir he said as a man I admire you as a preacher I don't think much of you brother Branham said that's mutually felt he goes uh-huh he walks off the platform that was all and I said all right now now look I don't claim to be a Divine healer I was reminded of my Lord when he said come down and perform come down let me see that same devil when he was on the cross they put a rag around his face and I believe you would be a prophet if you'll tell us who hit you he said but what is it it's that same Spirit those Spirits don't die he said they put him on a cross and it would be the Son of God come down let us see prove it to us come off the cross that old Same Spirit them preachers they had back there is dead but that Spirit lives right on in other preachers right on down through the age heal this one yeah let me see this one he'll now believe you well when he was here he passed by the pool in Bethesda their laid crippled multitudes everywhere the lame the halt the blind the withered and he walked right by them all and went to one man and healed him Jews had the same thing they questioned him about it here's what he said in John 5 19 verily verily I say unto you I can do nothing except the father showed me for the father loves the son it shows him what he does shows him all the things that he'd do with and he will show you greater things than the healing this diabetic or tubercular or whatever it is that you may Marvel but I can do nothing except the father show me and they said well what about all those lame halt blind Twisted withered waiting over there the father had showed him nothing about it so he went right on he said what the father showed him to do he did but according to his words who is the Son of God he could do nothing unto the first the father showed him he said no more I can't heal no one he said this I do say when I was baby born up in the state of Kentucky according to my dear mother which has been Vindicated through my life I said it said there was a light to come into the room that little bundle huddled there over my little crib and he said come right there about five o'clock in the morning a light circled just at the breaking of the day and I said since that time that light has been with me it's an angel of God he met me in person a few years ago down through my life he's told me many things that's happened and I told them just as he told me and I challenge anybody at any place to go to any City where I was raised or anywhere else that a statement's ever been made in the name of the Lord what it came to pass exactly how it was said it would but you know how the devil is he waits to the Witnesses are gone yeah these people that wants to come out about this stuff nowadays I just want to ask them were you there yes or no no I don't want to hear what you got to say amen he said anyway anyone here any Christian knows that God will have nothing to do with error so what he said about laodicea and he said I'm the faithful and true Witness the amen of God Amen he will not bless an error it has been and had been gone found out before this time it would never do God will not bless the heir but if I Testify the truth then God will testify of me if I make a statement and God has told me to do so then God will back it up do you believe that if he doesn't back it up then he never said it but if he made the statement God will stand behind what he promised he said oh you don't know how that makes me feel don't think I'm just off of my sense of balance I know where I'm at am look yes I know where I am I know what I'm talking about and every born-again man or woman knows what they're talking about it's whether you can appropriate the faith I don't know but what God says is the truth and I said if I tell the truth God will testify God is under obligation to testify he will not have nothing to do with air so if I have told the truth God will testify the truth and about that time here comes down across where I was it excited this photographer he ran up one that got the glossy glossy of the man he snapped a picture of me standing there and I said God will testify and I will say no more and I walked off the platform we know what happened Mr best got old Dr Bosworth and he got a lot of pictures you know fingers in his face doing this doing that you know they got to that motel room and then one man said to you know how to wait to go try to try to try to make these negatives you know take these negatives into the dark room and and and to develop them and he had all these pictures of Dr best with his finger in his face of Dr Bosworth you know and all sudden it's blank blank blank blank blank light you know the Devil he's been good at taking pictures for a long time you know this world's big old selfies nowadays but the devil been taking selfies a long time look at here guiding look him over in the ballroom drunk look and look at another website look at him doing this look at them they're they're defeated look at that look over there they are never gonna make it look at that all of a sudden he goes back and he goes to try to develop them blank blank blank blank blank like what was it brother random said that like struck the negative oh Hallelujah I prayed to God that light comes in this building so bright and it strikes the negative in your life and it illuminates you and it shows a picture me and God have a picture together he struck the negative in my life and he turned it into light hallelujah amen some of us had a lot of negative a lot of negative thoughts a lot of negative thinking a not a lot of negative paths but there's a light here that'll strike that negative and turn that darkness in the light Hallelujah it'll turn that law of darkness and watch Satan and try to put over your life and name you with and some of you try to call you anxiety and fear and slaves of every kind he's trying to put pornography on you he tried to put names of every slander names of all kinds of sin upon you but the devil goes to his laboratory and he starts trying to turn it [Applause] of being a man so tore up with fear and it couldn't even hardly get rest tonight and I got a picture of him a sleepless night where's it at [Applause] what was it the light came down and struck the negative and it's a testimony forever of God Saving Grace oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen the angel of the Lord thought enough about a Kentuckian preacher to come down and have his picture taken with him don't you know God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world and the Devils try to destroy it and he's trying to destroy and he's trying to destroy it and God said nope it's still in my laboratory I still got it and what they were at the beginning is what they're going to be at the end cause a lighter said so Darkness can say what he wants to Darkness can scream and holler I hear it hollering tonight it can scream and holler but it can't hold you he can scream and holler but it's got to go brother Silas it was his last camp that boy walked away from his last Camp a whole different man devil had a lot of selfies with you he had all kinds of things on your record but he went after this camp and he tried to show it again gone gone all I got is a picture of him with lights changed him it changed him I ain't the same silence no more I ain't the same man no more I ain't the same girl no more I ain't the same person no more light has come to produce a change I was thinking about this morning or this evening over in the cabin I was thinking about over there in the valley of agilon I rode to that Valley about the time the sun was going down Joshua was fighting you know there was five Kings to come against him remember the story I got to reading about that that one king ain't got his name but the historians looking at it as Melchizedek the king of righteousness and this other's real close he got a name real close to Melchizedek and he calls himself the son of righteousness ain't that something the devil's always trying to copy cat come right in the same place and he's daring Joshua to take his position the same place Melchizedek and met Abraham Joshua was coming back to it and the devil's standing there just denying him and saying you can't take this land you can't be this you can't and he gathers his forces together and he gets in four of the Kings to go fight it didn't go quite as planned devil this weekend is not going to go quiet as planned [Music] this weekend is not going to go quite as planned he began to gather his forces and he began to come against Joshua and the Bible says they begin to whoop their hides all over their Promised Land whoop them all day long until the sun started going down and Joshua said Son you stand there and moon you stand there what was it Joshua wasn't afraid to fight in the night he'd already fought him the night before he just wanted enough light to finish the war he wanted just enough life to take that devil's head off I'm done with you devil I'm done with you and this is the Finish haha Hallelujah brother Wayne I'm about to have myself a fit over there because the sun it represents the Sun and the Moon represents the bride let me tell you young people the bride of Christ and the Son of God is in this building tonight and we're going to stand over this Promised Land we ain't leaving here to every Devil's under our feet hallelujah we're going to stand in our positions until young people put their foot on the neck of that devil light is beginning to change some things amen there's somebody that's going to put their foot tonight over the neck of that anxiety spirit and that depression and that pornography and those kind of sicknesses of every kind there's somebody Joshua said we need a little more time and they said hey there's five Kings up there they don't hid themselves he said go ahead and throw some stones on them we're going to come back after them [Applause] till we can't chase them no more and the Bible said they ran them all the way back to their wall cities and Joshua said okay let's go back to where those kings are take the stones out take the storm down they bring them out these were Kings don't get done like this no no they have authority they say something and it happens but now all of a sudden their word has no power all of a sudden depression has found itself in the spot it don't have no voice [Applause] all of a sudden sexual sins find themselves in the spot I don't know Joshua said lay them out and it goes over every one of them he puts his foot over every neck three four five he said all right it's your turn listen this message ain't about a bunch of preachers having their foot over the back of the neck of a devil this message is about young people having their foot over the back of the devil what's giving you the ability what's giving you the courage what's giving you the moment to be able to have your time to put your foot on the back of his neck the light is here the sun is still up the Moon is still in her position she's reflecting the Sun and she's saying go ahead it's your time go ahead you put your foot on his neck you put your foot on his neck of that Gentle Spirit you put your foot on that bitterness you put your foot on that Pride this is the night Forge this is the time forward this is the moment for it Hallelujah and they hung those kings up hello somebody come on now let's have a service tonight that the rest of this service there's five Kings hung across here and it's a reminder they lost their power they don't have power no over it's over the light is here to declare it's over that battle you've been in is over that situation you don't know how to handle it's over with hallelujah amen but I read in that Bible but it ain't about ran around that place it said when the sun started going down it said all right it's time to put them Kings back where they belong they came from hell and they're going back to hell Hallelujah there's a time that this sun is going to go down upon this Earth and this moon is going to depart but where's the devil going to be he's going to be in hell where he belongs he's going to be in hell he gonna be tormented I think about it amen the Tormentor that tormented you it's going to become the tormented the man who tried to hold things over your head is going to be held over his head the light produces change and that lights in the building tonight it's here to stand our feet it's here it's here to strike the negative that light has come down the mighty Angel is Among Us is here he's here he hasn't left he never has he
