[3:32] a God that answers needs if we just bow
[3:35] our hearts let's just go to Him Father
[3:37] we're certainly honored to be here with
[3:40] your children and Lord the precious the
[3:44] precious blood that has purchased your
[3:47] children Lord and as we stand here to
[3:49] address them this morning I ask you for
[3:52] your mercy upon us Lord as we just Lord
[3:56] feels almost like a vibration just
[3:59] moving through the building Lord father
[4:03] just an
[4:04] anointing Lord where your children are
[4:06] gathered together and and Lord the power
[4:09] of your majesty is being honored Among
[4:12] Us and and Lord we just want to take a
[4:14] moment to thank you and to praise you
[4:17] for your goodness and Lord for all that
[4:19] you do for the breath in our bodies Lord
[4:22] for the ability to be here for this
[4:24] beautiful place Lord for all the
[4:26] provisions you've made Lord we give you
[4:28] thanks and honor this morning morning
[4:30] and Lord Jesus but of all of that
[4:33] together without you would mean nothing
[4:36] and Lord we invite you into your word
[4:39] now as we would open that door we ask
[4:42] you that you would move into this
[4:43] sanctuary in the word oh God and may
[4:46] Revelation strike hearts and lives and
[4:49] Lord may you minister to the needs but
[4:52] father as you walk through the building
[4:55] Lord there's special circumstances that
[4:57] need attention Lord and we're inviting
[4:59] you now Lord to come and take a hold of
[5:02] those things and move on the behalf of
[5:04] your children and Lord we ask you now in
[5:07] the name of our Lord Jesus we pray amen
[5:11] and amen and God bless you if you have
[5:13] your Bibles today we'd like to go to the
[5:15] book of Ephesians the first chapter amen
[5:19] and uh we're going to be looking here
[5:21] today in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 19
[5:23] down to verse 23 amen um it's certainly
[5:27] good to see all of our visitors today
[5:29] and amen and uh we just want to uh take
[5:33] a moment here in the word uh we've been
[5:36] in this book of Ephesians for a few
[5:38] services and I'm I'm looking here at the
[5:41] end of this uh end of these verses and
[5:43] amen uh Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 19
[5:47] and what is the exceeding
[5:50] greatness of his power toward us word
[5:53] who believe according to the working of
[5:57] his mighty power which he wrought in
[5:59] Christ or which he showed in Christ or
[6:03] he exemplified in Christ when he raised
[6:06] him from the dead and he set him at his
[6:09] own right hand in Heavenly
[6:12] places now brother Bram said when Jesus
[6:15] was on the earth they gave him the
[6:18] lowest name that could be given a man he
[6:21] said his name was the lowest it was mud
[6:23] he said it was he was a he was an
[6:25] outcast but when God set him he set him
[6:29] far above
[6:30] all principality and power and might and
[6:35] dominion and every name that is named
[6:39] now not only in this world but also in
[6:43] that which is to come and he hath put
[6:46] all things somebody say all things all
[6:49] things under his feet and gave him to be
[6:53] the head over all things to the church
[6:57] which is his body the fullness of him
[7:01] that filth all in all God bless you as
[7:03] you could be seated this morning I want
[7:05] to continue uh this today on the book of
[7:08] Ephesians but if I would take a a
[7:10] subtitle so that you might uh hear my
[7:13] context today I want to talk to you a
[7:15] little bit about Satan under your
[7:18] feet Satan under your feet now we know
[7:23] here that the scriptures is is plainly
[7:26] telling us and I I want to make uh maybe
[7:28] just a couple of St statements here and
[7:30] not you you've heard them proved over
[7:32] and over but I just want to make a few
[7:33] statements to put them in your heart
[7:35] amen is that this Ephesians chapter 1
[7:38] verses 19 down to 23 here what we're
[7:41] reading about and you could include of
[7:43] course 17 here but what we're reading
[7:45] about is you're reading about Revelation
[7:47] chapter 3 and you're reading about the
[7:49] the leoty and age and you're looking at
[7:52] the age when the church is exalted to
[7:55] the throne that's what you're looking at
[7:56] but to get into the throne you have to
[7:59] open your heart so he said behold I
[8:01] stand at the door and knock and if any
[8:02] man come unto me I will Su or reveal
[8:04] unto him and then the Overcomer shall
[8:07] share in the throne now amen now we know
[8:10] that that that God allowed Paul to tell
[8:13] us where we're going to be but sometime
[8:15] or another there has to be a people who
[8:17] actually move into those positions and I
[8:20] believe that that this generation I
[8:22] believe this is end time scriptures
[8:24] speaking to the church amen in the day
[8:26] we're living so when you look at the
[8:28] scripture here and it's saying amen that
[8:31] that they have set him at his own right
[8:33] hand in Heavenly places and put all
[8:34] things beneath his feet and we're
[8:36] looking at an age of authority when you
[8:39] uh read here with David uh with Paul and
[8:42] you see him talking about Jesus being at
[8:45] the right hand now these are powerful
[8:46] scriptures because if you were in the
[8:48] days of the Hebrews they were knowing
[8:51] these were Messianic prophecies
[8:53] concerning amen the son of David and
[8:56] David amen speaking of it in Psalms 110
[9:00] uh they all knew that mezc was to be a
[9:03] son and he was to be up on the throne
[9:06] now according to scripture Psalms 110
[9:09] verse1 the the psalm of David the Lord
[9:11] said unto my Lord sit thou at my right
[9:14] hand until I make thine enemies thy foot
[9:17] stols now y'all know uh some people took
[9:19] that out there and made two Lords out of
[9:21] it amen but if you if you want to just
[9:23] get a simple answer to that just go over
[9:26] to the prophet and he'll tell you the
[9:27] answer and he said what the answer to
[9:29] this is he said that Jesus was both the
[9:32] root and The Offspring of David he was
[9:35] both his root and his offspring that's
[9:37] so simple amen do you see then the Lord
[9:40] send the rod of thy strength out of Zion
[9:42] and thou shal rule in the midst of thine
[9:44] enemies and the people shall be willing
[9:47] in the day of thy power and in the
[9:49] beauty of Holiness the womb of the
[9:51] morning thou Hast the do of you for the
[9:54] Lord has sworn and will not repent thou
[9:56] art a priest Forever After the order of
[9:58] melaz now now Paul is placing Jesus as
[10:03] this one sitting at the right hand of
[10:06] God now when you go to Psalm 16 there's
[10:09] another great Messianic prophecy here he
[10:11] said I have set the lord always before
[10:13] me in the eth verse because he is at my
[10:17] right hand I shall not be moved
[10:18] therefore my heart is glad and my glory
[10:21] rejoices My Flesh shall Rest In Hope for
[10:24] thou will not suffer leave thy soul in
[10:26] Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy
[10:28] One to see corruption
[10:30] thou will show me the path of life and
[10:32] in the presence of Joy at thy right hand
[10:35] are Pleasures forever
[10:38] more now when you when you look at this
[10:41] and you see that these men are taking
[10:44] Messianic prophecies from the days of
[10:46] the Jew and placing them Upon Jesus amen
[10:50] excuse
[10:53] me I know none of y'all have been
[10:55] coughing so it'll be
[10:58] okay
[10:59] Amen in Mark chapter 16 you'll see that
[11:03] the Bible says here in the 19th verse so
[11:05] then after the Lord had spoken unto them
[11:08] he was received up into heaven and sat
[11:11] on the right hand of God and he went
[11:14] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[11:16] working with them and confirming the
[11:18] word with signs and wonders now when
[11:20] Peter in the book of Acts is preaching
[11:23] it's it's him that takes the book of
[11:25] Psalms and begins to apply this to Jesus
[11:28] many and brother let me freely speak
[11:30] unto you of the patriarch David it
[11:32] wouldn't have been good to hear d uh
[11:34] Peter's sermon can you imagine a bunch
[11:35] of Jews who didn't believe that Jesus
[11:38] was the Messiah they just crucified him
[11:40] and here's a man he says see he's both
[11:43] dead and buried and his supper is with
[11:45] us this day therefore being a prophet
[11:48] and knowing that God had sworn an oath
[11:50] to him that the fruit of his loins
[11:52] according to the flesh he would raise up
[11:54] for Christ to sit on his throne and
[11:56] seeing this before spake of the
[11:58] Resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[12:01] not left in Hell neither his flesh did
[12:04] see corruption now this Jesus hath God
[12:06] raised up wherefore we all are witnesses
[12:09] therefore being by the right hand of God
[12:12] exalted and have received the Father the
[12:14] promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed
[12:16] forth this which you know now see and
[12:19] hear for David is not ascended under the
[12:23] heavens but he saith himself the Lord
[12:25] said unto my Lord set thou on my right
[12:27] hand until I make thy foes thy foot stol
[12:30] therefore let all of the House of Israel
[12:33] assuredly no assuredly that God hath
[12:36] made this same Jesus whom you crucified
[12:40] both Lord and
[12:43] Christ my that was a powerful moment in
[12:45] life he's made this one you crucified
[12:48] both the Lord and Christ amen you see
[12:52] that's where where Thomas remember when
[12:54] he put his hands on him remember what
[12:56] Thomas said my Lord and my God amen he
[13:00] is both Lord and Christ and now in
[13:02] Ephesians chapter 1 amen it tells us
[13:05] Paul now is saying that he is set him at
[13:08] his right hand in Heavenly places Paul
[13:11] again in Hebrews 12 and verse 2 he sat
[13:14] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[13:16] God in Romans chapter 8 Paul says it in
[13:19] the 34th verse he said it is Christ that
[13:22] died rather is risen again who is even
[13:26] at the right hand of God in Colossians
[13:28] chapter 3 and verse one Christ sth on
[13:31] the right hand of God Hebrews chapter 1
[13:34] amen and verse three and he sat down on
[13:37] the right hand of the Majesty on high in
[13:41] Hebrews chapter 10 watch in the 12th
[13:43] verse but this man after he had offered
[13:45] the sacrifice of sins forever sat down
[13:49] on the right hand of God now isn't that
[13:51] powerful that Paul points out this man
[13:54] did this this man after that he had
[13:57] offered sat down at the right hand of
[13:59] God now why would Paul say this man
[14:02] because he's letting us know that there
[14:04] is now a man on the throne of God it's
[14:07] good to just say well he's on the right
[14:09] hand of God but if you continue to read
[14:11] you see that the scriptures tells us he
[14:13] is on the right hand but the right hand
[14:15] is only speaking of the authority
[14:18] brother bam said God's a spirit and he
[14:20] has no right hand amen but Jesus is the
[14:23] supreme authority of almighty God in
[14:26] Revelation Chapter 3 The Bible will de
[14:29] Clare to us that he has overcame and sat
[14:32] down on his father's throne and he is
[14:35] ensuing to the church that you do the
[14:37] same as I overcome so should you
[14:40] overcome and sit down with me in my
[14:42] Throne as I have set in my father in his
[14:45] throne so not only is he at the right
[14:47] hand he sits on the throne of God which
[14:49] makes him the supreme power and the
[14:52] Supreme deity of not just heaven but of
[14:55] Earth and of all things our lord Jesus
[14:58] has conquered death hell and the grave
[15:01] and there is nothing that he has not
[15:03] conquered he is the mighty conqueror he
[15:06] is the king of all Kings he is the Lord
[15:09] of all Lords he is supreme Majesty in
[15:12] the heavens in the Earth above all
[15:14] disciplines and dominions and Powers all
[15:17] things are subject unto our Lord Jesus
[15:20] Christ my When I See This knowing that
[15:24] God has done such things in our hour
[15:26] Amen to know that not only is see that
[15:29] but he wants to express that in Psalms
[15:32] 110 in the third verse it said the
[15:35] people shall be willing in the day of
[15:37] thy power I wonder how many of the
[15:40] people are here this
[15:42] morning the people of God are we the
[15:45] people of God come on I know I know it's
[15:47] hard people say well I tell you what
[15:49] that message Bunch they make their
[15:50] themselves the elite no that's where
[15:52] you're wrong we didn't do it God did it
[15:55] it's not the elite above somebody it's
[15:58] the class that God requires to put them
[16:01] in the top shelf somebody say well we
[16:03] should get among a better class of
[16:04] people there's not a better class of
[16:06] people the greatest class of the people
[16:08] in the world is the people that's got
[16:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[16:12] called a ye class of people yet a little
[16:15] while and the world seeth me no more but
[16:17] ye shall see me for I will be with you
[16:20] even in You Until the End of the Age
[16:23] then God has a people on the Earth today
[16:26] that people was predestinated before the
[16:29] foundations of the world when we might
[16:30] as well go ahead and put it right in the
[16:32] face of the devil we did not save
[16:34] ourselves amen we did not asked to be
[16:37] saved but God who is rich in Mercy
[16:40] looked Upon Our Lives and he appointed
[16:42] unto us salvation by the grace of God
[16:45] because he loved us and we were his
[16:47] people Paul said in the book of Acts
[16:49] that he had God had people in the city
[16:52] before Paul ever got to the city so the
[16:55] reason Paul went to the city was to get
[16:57] to the people of God the same reason
[16:59] Jesus went to The Well of Samaria was
[17:02] because he had a child there and the
[17:04] same reason he will appear in the last
[17:06] days is because there is a people there
[17:08] is a bride that belongs to almighty God
[17:11] and he comes for those
[17:14] people I believe we are those people and
[17:17] I believe that's why the prophet said
[17:18] come out of her my people and I believe
[17:22] that this morning that that people is
[17:24] represented here and those people will
[17:27] be willing in the day of his power they
[17:31] will be willing for God to move they
[17:33] will be willing to allow him to use
[17:36] their lives to use their voices to use
[17:38] their gifts to use their bodies amen you
[17:40] can have a gift but if you're not
[17:42] willing I thank God this morning we had
[17:45] some singers willing amen I pray I thank
[17:47] the lord we had some worshippers willing
[17:50] amen willing to let God begin to move
[17:53] now the scriptures tells us amen that
[17:56] all power in Heaven and Earth was given
[17:58] unto him right then he says go ye
[18:01] therefore into all nations amen teach uh
[18:04] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[18:06] name of the Father the Son and of the
[18:08] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[18:10] things what I have commanded unto you I
[18:12] am with you even unto the end of the
[18:15] world now we recognize amen that Jesus
[18:20] according to prophecy is to make a great
[18:23] Display of Power in the end time now I I
[18:26] could take scripture and prove it but I
[18:27] think you all been there amen there's a
[18:29] there's Prophecy in the Bible that tells
[18:32] us that there would be a great
[18:35] exhibition of power in the end time it
[18:38] would be a revealing of the son of man
[18:41] in his power is that right resurrection
[18:44] power is to be made manifest in the last
[18:47] days and there must be a body now when
[18:50] brother Ram done all of these Mighty
[18:52] things and and his his ministry Rose
[18:54] above all the Ministries in the planet
[18:56] when he was here amen when we seen all
[18:59] that thing here's brother Bam's answer
[19:01] to it it was not
[19:04] me I didn't do it I was only there when
[19:07] he did it and I love how he says it it
[19:09] was what I surrendered myself to amen
[19:14] it's what I yielded my life to amen what
[19:17] he says is he took a temporary
[19:19] resurrection and God borrowed his body
[19:20] you've heard him say it I'm so glad to
[19:23] loan him my body do you see something
[19:26] was happening but there had to be a will
[19:28] invest on the earth same ways if there's
[19:30] a television uh program playing and it's
[19:33] running in here you only know it's
[19:34] playing if you have a television playing
[19:37] the program otherwise the program could
[19:39] go right by and you never knew it
[19:41] happened the sending station sent it but
[19:44] the people never saw it because there
[19:46] was nothing to display it to them but in
[19:48] the hour when the son of man revealed
[19:51] himself from Heaven he didn't just send
[19:53] a signal into the Earth he had a prophet
[19:56] to catch the signal and display it by to
[19:58] the church and say to them that the
[20:01] Jesus who you buried in the Tomb 2,000
[20:04] years ago is not dead he is alive and he
[20:08] sent a message to prove the power of the
[20:11] Resurrection in the end time it is a
[20:13] supernatural message to a supernatural
[20:16] people and I believe it I believe that
[20:18] that same logos amen that led the
[20:21] children of Israel is the same logos
[20:24] that embodied itself in the person Jesus
[20:26] Christ amen and that same logos has got
[20:29] a part here today that same logos the
[20:32] spirit of God the anointing the
[20:34] sanctifying grace of the blood he says
[20:37] he would brought many sons unto God
[20:40] which is Anointed by that same
[20:43] logos brother on the day of Pentecost it
[20:47] came down as a pillar of fire and broke
[20:49] apart and the tongues of fire set upon
[20:51] them not tongues but tongues of fire set
[20:53] upon each of them an elected selected
[20:55] group identified by this Pillar of Fire
[20:58] sh that God had separated into man do
[21:01] you get it the logos separating himself
[21:03] into man not God not in one person he
[21:06] said but he's in the church
[21:09] Universal the same logos isn't that
[21:11] powerful the same logos the same
[21:14] anointing the same Pillar of Fire now
[21:17] watch from Jesus the same yesterday
[21:19] today and forever brother bam says oh he
[21:21] has to be the same same attitude the
[21:23] same in power the same in everything but
[21:26] the physical body see that sets at the
[21:29] right hand of God but his spirit is here
[21:31] in us to manifest himself to take our
[21:35] lives and make it exactly what he said
[21:37] it was that's what he promised the Holy
[21:40] Ghost when he has come will testify me
[21:43] and show you things that are to come
[21:47] Amen brother B says see it's the same in
[21:49] every aspect except the Corporal body
[21:52] amen the promise of the end time now now
[21:55] watch in the day of his power the
[21:57] promise of the end time is not
[21:59] intellectual power it's not educational
[22:02] power it's not theological power the
[22:05] promise is holy ghost power come on
[22:08] Friends amen you know that the prophet
[22:10] said that it would be National Force
[22:13] that would put Israel in its Homeland
[22:15] it's there isn't it amen but what puts
[22:18] the bride in the body what puts the
[22:20] people in The Bride is the power of God
[22:23] it's the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[22:25] what puts the church in the Rapture put
[22:28] which are in the body it is a display
[22:30] not of Education it's not a display of
[22:33] formality it is a display of the literal
[22:37] life of Jesus Christ that he is not dead
[22:40] he is alive oh my Christianity in its
[22:45] rarest form Christianity is not a base
[22:48] of principles and and ideas and
[22:51] governments and religiosity it is a
[22:53] living being a personal experience with
[22:56] the god of the Old Testament that was
[22:58] known as Jesus Christ but the same
[23:01] spirit that raised him from the dead
[23:03] promised to come on the church and raise
[23:05] us out of every dead educational and
[23:08] Theological Seminary that they have
[23:11] buried the Lord in I think it's a return
[23:13] of power the power of the Holy Ghost
[23:16] that lives in the Church of the Living
[23:18] God hallelujah we're not dead but
[23:22] we are
[23:25] alive
[23:26] ready and willing
[23:32] now brother man said how can you say the
[23:34] apostolic age
[23:36] ceased see where do you get that how can
[23:40] a Vine come out of here and bear today
[23:42] and go out and bear an orange and then
[23:44] bear a pumpkin it would have to change
[23:46] its life and Malachi 3 said God changes
[23:50] not now if this Vine ever gives forth
[23:52] another
[23:54] Branch y'all know I'm in the message
[23:57] it'll have to continue the book book of
[23:59] Acts that was not the Acts of the
[24:01] Apostles friends it was the acts of God
[24:05] in the
[24:07] apostles and that same God is performing
[24:10] action in the church today to those who
[24:13] are willing to submit their lives to it
[24:17] I I I look at this and see brother Ram
[24:19] says it now now now now you you you have
[24:22] to see brother Adam he he brings things
[24:25] so beautifully sign of his coming 1962
[24:29] brother Ram said what is it he said it's
[24:31] a body growing from the feet coming up
[24:33] most important parts of the body from
[24:35] the feet lungs heart on into the head
[24:37] who is the head Christ the intelligence
[24:41] how does a body move by the
[24:43] head and the government shall be upon
[24:46] what on his shoulders Isaiah 9 and6
[24:49] right there's where the real true church
[24:53] speaks in power there's where Apostolic
[24:56] power returns to the church when the
[25:00] government shall be upon his shoulders
[25:03] how many knows what that means it means
[25:05] that the seals became open and released
[25:09] the headship of the word over the church
[25:12] which opened Apostolic power to return
[25:15] amen without denominational growth in
[25:19] it look at this amen the the brother
[25:23] Bram explains this now in the in the
[25:25] church age he said already visible
[25:27] manifestations of what I've been and
[25:28] telling you are seen all around this
[25:30] ecumenical move the tears is factual but
[25:32] also in fact the prophet of the last age
[25:34] must be bringing a message from God that
[25:37] will forerun the second coming of the
[25:38] Lord for by his message will his heart
[25:41] of the children be turned back to the
[25:42] Pentecostal fathers and with the
[25:44] restoration of the word will come a
[25:46] restoration of power isn't that
[25:50] beautiful a restoration of word means a
[25:53] restoration of power you cannot have the
[25:56] word of God and it not bring the power
[25:59] of God if it don't have the power of God
[26:02] it's not the word of God it's the word
[26:04] of some Seminary it's the word of some
[26:07] teacher it's the word of some idea but
[26:09] if it's the word of God the word has
[26:13] power in it power to manifest power to
[26:16] bring reality the word is a powerful
[26:20] thing the Holy Ghost you see do you know
[26:23] that the Holy Ghost was released 2,000
[26:26] years
[26:27] ago but why didn't we see it manifest so
[26:30] openly up Through the Ages I'll tell you
[26:33] what a prophet said he said it's been
[26:35] bound for 2,000 years the Holy Ghost has
[26:38] been now nearly for 2,000 years under
[26:40] marm back there under the church ages
[26:43] it's not been at the river of Euphrates
[26:45] it's been bound at the door of Creeds
[26:47] and dogmas and the Holy Spirit can't
[26:50] work in the church because of man-made
[26:52] systems she's going to be liberated
[26:55] she's coming back that's what the Bible
[26:57] said
[26:58] amen look now watch amen you bound at
[27:02] the doors of Creeds and dogmas do you
[27:03] realize doctrines that prevent the
[27:05] moving of the spirit are actually a
[27:07] Creed or a Dogma binding the Holy Spirit
[27:10] from moving now I I don't want to take
[27:13] too long in teaching just a moment but
[27:15] let let's just let's just watch this
[27:17] family traditions bind the moving of the
[27:19] spirit personal conflicts bind the
[27:22] moving of the spirit y'all know what
[27:23] brother Bram said you remember he said
[27:24] let somebody even move a pinky in the
[27:26] wrong attitude and it could G away the
[27:28] Holy Ghost y'all seen it where you sit
[27:30] in church and you know there's something
[27:31] wrong and you can feel it and that's not
[27:34] here I just God bless you it's not here
[27:36] this morning am hallelujah amen I love
[27:40] the Liberty I feel right now so don't
[27:41] think I'm amen but but but y y'all been
[27:44] there where there was a little snag in
[27:46] the spirit and it you it's it it would
[27:49] get up and then it'll do and you'll
[27:51] bring it up and then you'll bring it up
[27:53] and then and what that is is somebody's
[27:56] resisting they're UPS said at something
[27:58] they're resisting they're resisting in
[28:00] their spirit and what it is is like a
[28:03] binding of the spirit in the local
[28:05] church right so what so so the spirit's
[28:09] here the power of God's here same as it
[28:11] was last week are they going to be next
[28:13] week but the difference is it's bound
[28:15] from
[28:16] moving so what we see in a small measure
[28:20] in a church service was what was
[28:22] happening through the church ages when
[28:25] the denominations got together and
[28:27] offended the spirit of God by their
[28:29] doctrines and teachings and he was the
[28:32] only one not welcome in the
[28:35] church right so they bound him by Creeds
[28:38] and dogmas now brother BR says see the
[28:40] Holy Spirit has been bound by the
[28:42] denominations for 2,000 years notice we
[28:46] found out but there will be a
[28:49] day but there will be a day neither
[28:52] night nor day but he's talking about
[28:54] Zachariah the evening light shall come
[28:56] right now watch you again amen Feast of
[28:59] the trumpets the Holy Spirit has been
[29:01] bound by these denominational Rivers for
[29:03] almost 2,000 years but it is to be
[29:06] loosed in the evening
[29:08] time by the evening time message isn't
[29:12] that powerful with the restoration of
[29:15] word comes restoration of power amen
[29:18] doctrines bind the moving of the spirit
[29:21] but the prophet of God said but the end
[29:23] time message would loose the moving of
[29:25] the spirit watch what he said the the
[29:28] holy spirit is back in the church again
[29:30] Christ himself revealed in the human
[29:33] flesh in the evening time he said it he
[29:36] promised it now what what are we dealing
[29:39] with amen what is it it's it's God
[29:41] bringing the word to releas the person
[29:45] of the
[29:47] word the end time evangelism we've had
[29:49] enough to join church and put our names
[29:51] on the book but in the evening time
[29:53] there shall come a great power of Christ
[29:56] would come upon his church just like it
[29:58] did there on the Eastern it is to be in
[30:01] the western the same that's why I want
[30:04] to speak on evening evangelism Queen of
[30:07] Sheba brother Bram said the Holy Ghost
[30:09] comes with power and manifestations and
[30:12] demonstrations of his presence then
[30:14] there would not be one cruel word spoke
[30:17] against any move of God we'd all be one
[30:19] in one Great Bend of Godly love that's
[30:22] what's going to take it for the church
[30:24] to go in the Rapture look what he said
[30:26] there'd be a there be a a gathering
[30:29] around the moving of the power of God
[30:32] watch this in great coming revival
[30:34] brother R said the sun done crossed over
[30:36] now of human theology by Church
[30:38] organization and domination he said it
[30:40] darkened things from the Christian's
[30:43] eyes see that's right it's darkened
[30:46] Divine Healing it darkened the power of
[30:49] God it darkened the gifts they've all
[30:53] applied it back there to where the Sun
[30:55] was shining see any any denominational
[30:58] teachings will always take you to the
[31:00] book of Acts for the Miracles and
[31:02] manifestations of God and they'll say
[31:04] see it happened back there and they'll
[31:05] prove to you it happened back there but
[31:08] the problem is is they want to leave it
[31:10] all back there or they want to say
[31:12] there's coming a millennium and then
[31:14] we'll have these things in the
[31:16] Millennium but the prophet of God said
[31:18] but watch the scripture see amen the
[31:21] same son that Shone in the morning is
[31:24] supposed to shine in the evening the
[31:27] same Sun that did it there is the same
[31:29] son is supposed to shine here he will
[31:32] not be shining in just immaturity but
[31:35] it'll be a shining strength of the power
[31:38] of God Amen what is it it's God
[31:40] returning back the power of God to the
[31:43] church the power of healing will return
[31:45] to the church the power of Deliverance
[31:48] returns to the church amen you know
[31:50] sometimes I I know even even people who
[31:53] are good people sometimes you know good
[31:55] good solid Christians are not getting
[31:57] their healing
[31:58] and I I was listening to a tape just the
[31:59] other day and I thought it was something
[32:01] cuz brother Ram's talking about it and
[32:03] I'm saying Lord I know the healing
[32:05] powers that why ain't some people
[32:06] getting the healing that they need and
[32:08] brother Bram said on and it's powerful
[32:10] because he's talking about
[32:11] predestination in Matthew 24 and he said
[32:14] Jesus spoke of the elect I said Jesus
[32:16] spoke of the elect he and brother man
[32:18] says yeah he spoke of them he said he
[32:20] said the the the Antichrist would be so
[32:23] deceptive it would deceive the very
[32:24] elect if possible brother said see he's
[32:27] saying the elect was
[32:29] there right the elect was there then
[32:32] brother Bram changed his tunes and he
[32:33] said but see amen there's the reason
[32:36] some people he says it's harder to
[32:39] receive healing than salvation he said
[32:42] because there was an election on your
[32:43] life and a strain of God that made you a
[32:47] Son of God isn't it something he said to
[32:49] the believer sometimes salvation is
[32:52] easier than it's healing amen and it
[32:54] doesn't mean you're not a son or
[32:56] daughter of God it's just your salvation
[32:58] was easier because it was a strain that
[33:00] come from almighty God I thought my
[33:03] goodness we already post that one on on
[33:05] the on the church chat or something I
[33:06] don't know I don't think we have one but
[33:08] but but you know it it should be got out
[33:11] amen amen to to let people know amen
[33:14] that God does still
[33:16] [Music]
[33:19] heal the church World clouds the the the
[33:24] power of God with her doubt it's still
[33:27] there
[33:28] but they hold a cloud of Doubt over the
[33:31] power of God can I just say this but the
[33:34] scripture says that in the evening time
[33:36] there shall come light watch how Jesus
[33:39] prophesies when he speaks of it in Mark
[33:41] amen the Bible said Jesus said I am and
[33:44] ye shall see the son of man sitting on
[33:47] the right hand of
[33:49] power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven
[33:54] look at the beauty of this amen and
[33:56] coming in the Clouds of of Heaven do you
[33:58] know he's prophesying of our day Jesus
[34:01] is talking about our day coming in the
[34:04] Clouds Of Heaven amen let's let's just
[34:07] look at Luke 22 and verse 69 Hereafter
[34:10] you shall see the son of man set on the
[34:12] right hand of the power of God in Luke
[34:15] 21:25 look at the beauty of scripture
[34:18] and there shall be signs in the Sun and
[34:21] in the moon and in the stars and upon
[34:24] this Earth and distress of Nations and
[34:26] perplexity of the seas and the waves
[34:29] roaring men's Hearts failing for fear
[34:33] and looking after those things which are
[34:35] coming on the earth for the powers of
[34:37] Heaven to be shaken amen now the signs
[34:39] in the Sun and in the moon and in the
[34:41] stars and distressed Nations do y'all
[34:43] realize amen that the signs they're
[34:46] talking about amen has been happening
[34:48] for years with eclipses and and with
[34:50] moon eclipse and Sun eclipses and and
[34:52] then that that's a yearly occurrence or
[34:54] every every few years we have these
[34:56] things over and over so he's not just
[34:58] speaking about natural
[35:01] eclipses this is not just dealing with
[35:03] the moon and with the sun we're dealing
[35:06] with church and power we're dealing with
[35:09] we're dealing with something it's it's
[35:11] it's a little bit different than maybe
[35:13] what the world would oppress it to but
[35:16] then the Bible said in the stars and
[35:17] upon the stress of the Nations now
[35:19] you're in the natural with perplexity
[35:21] and the seeds and ways roaring now watch
[35:23] this but the Bible said and then shall
[35:25] they see the son of man coming in a
[35:27] cloud with power and great
[35:31] glory and when these things begin to
[35:34] come to pass look up and lift up your
[35:36] heads for your Redemption draweth nigh
[35:39] Now isn't this beautiful cuz I I'm going
[35:41] to ask you where would you verse verse
[35:43] 27 where would we place that as a church
[35:46] all right because we know that over in
[35:48] the Book of Revelations it says that
[35:50] he's coming with a cloud and every eyes
[35:52] shall see him every tongue shall confess
[35:54] and they'll bow brother B said that's
[35:56] not the Rapture that's when he's coming
[35:58] to Israel right amen but do you
[36:01] recognize what happens in Revelation
[36:03] which is the coming to Israel every eye
[36:05] sees him is right here in Luke
[36:07] 21:27 but there's also something else in
[36:10] Luke 21:27 which is hid from you until
[36:13] you take it to other scriptures it's
[36:16] beautiful when you see that the Bible
[36:18] don't miss nothing when you look in the
[36:20] Book of Matthew 24 verse 29 immediately
[36:23] after the tribulation of those days
[36:25] shall the sun be darkened and the moon
[36:26] shall not give light and the Stars shall
[36:29] fall from Heaven and the powers of
[36:30] Heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[36:33] appear the sign of the son of man in
[36:35] heaven and then shall all the tribes of
[36:37] the earth mourn and they shall see the
[36:39] son of man coming in the Clouds Of
[36:41] Heaven with power and great Glory look
[36:43] in Luke 21 it just says one thing but
[36:46] there's more things in that than what
[36:48] you read when you come to Matthew 24 you
[36:51] see there's two events wrapped up in one
[36:53] scripture you see that there is a cloud
[36:56] that appears to the Gentile house which
[36:58] is the sign of the son of man in heaven
[37:00] but after that then he'll go to the Jews
[37:03] and appear unto them just like he did
[37:05] for the church he will go to those Jews
[37:09] amen but listen here's what's happened
[37:11] people have looked at what's going to
[37:12] happen to the Jews and they have
[37:14] dismissed the power that has been given
[37:17] in the Gentile Church listen friends
[37:19] don't look for his coming his coming is
[37:22] upon us amen we are the manifestation of
[37:27] the power power of His coming and the
[37:28] age we're living in amen you preacher
[37:31] don't you believe we're going to go away
[37:33] absolutely but this world will never see
[37:35] it these people you're living with will
[37:37] never know it if you're going to display
[37:40] the power of God Amen it's got to be
[37:46] now then shall appearer the sign of the
[37:48] son of man in heaven now now if you go
[37:50] to Matthew 24 and 29 you can pick this
[37:53] up out of The Sixth Seal you you people
[37:55] that like to study these things are
[37:56] powerful it immediately after the
[37:58] tribulation of those days immediately
[38:00] after the tribulation of those days do
[38:02] y'all know what brother Bram says that
[38:04] is he says that's a pre-tribulation
[38:07] period under
[38:09] ikan it's not the tribulation the three
[38:12] and a half years this is happening in
[38:14] the
[38:15] 40s right this is World War II but look
[38:19] at this and the Sun be darken to the
[38:21] Moon not give her light do you all
[38:23] recognize there's two different times of
[38:24] eclipses there's the eclipse of the Sun
[38:27] but there's eclipse of the moon and and
[38:29] and I don't have time to get into all
[38:30] this but L just real real quickly amen
[38:33] if you have if you have the sun here and
[38:36] you have the Earth here if the moon gets
[38:39] between the two that's the eclipse of
[38:41] the sun right so you can't get the light
[38:44] of the sun you actually from the earth
[38:47] you see the Moon it got between you and
[38:49] God there's the church right it got
[38:51] between the church the people of God and
[38:54] the Son of God and the church got in the
[38:56] way Roman Catholic Church did that so
[38:59] what do you see if you see an eclipse
[39:01] what what what would you see in the moon
[39:02] do you know the moon actually turns red
[39:05] they call it a blood moon so when the
[39:07] Bible says and the moon shall turn with
[39:09] blood with red it's speaking of it's in
[39:12] the time of that Eclipse they're looking
[39:14] at the church look and it's in the it's
[39:17] in the way but if you're looking at the
[39:19] other direction amen the Earth gets
[39:22] between the Sun and the church which is
[39:25] what happened to the Catholic Church
[39:28] and it darkened them now I'm in Isaiah
[39:29] 60 darkness is upon the Earth and gross
[39:33] darkness is upon the people because the
[39:35] church was supposed to give light but
[39:38] instead of giving light what they did is
[39:40] they let the world and their technology
[39:42] and theology get between them and the
[39:45] power source and now the whole earth
[39:47] amen the Earth itself amen can't see the
[39:50] light of the Moon it can't see the
[39:53] light's not reflecting so the Moon is
[39:55] darkened and the Sun doesn't give its
[39:58] light what is it talking about it's
[40:00] talking about different events now
[40:02] there's been eclipses of suns and moons
[40:04] for years amen but it's not till a
[40:06] prophet gets on the scene that he says
[40:09] the pope just went to
[40:12] Jerusalem natural Church what's he doing
[40:15] he's putting the lights out amen what's
[40:18] he doing he's darkening the Earth amen
[40:21] for Satan's eeden he's putting out what
[40:24] little light was left in the church he's
[40:26] going to make an ecumenical council and
[40:29] push out the manifestation of the son of
[40:31] man so as it cannot ignite the church in
[40:34] the end time oh but to you that fear my
[40:38] name shall the son of righteousness
[40:41] arise with healing in his wings and
[40:44] there shall be light in the evening time
[40:46] there'll be a sunrise to the church amen
[40:49] they'll be able to say good morning
[40:52] Shalom and in the darkest time of all
[40:55] the ages they will have a light because
[40:57] there's a man here that can turn on the
[41:00] light he's returning in clouds of glory
[41:03] and in power it's not a cloud to darken
[41:06] it's not a cloud to place light or or or
[41:09] doubt upon the church we're not supposed
[41:11] to take the message and put a cloud over
[41:14] you amen we're not supposed to hide the
[41:16] resurrection power and the delivering
[41:18] power with our Theology and formality
[41:21] what we are ignited to do is to lift the
[41:24] clouds of doubt and to be manifest in
[41:27] the power of the word of God in this age
[41:31] the power of the son of
[41:33] man the word has
[41:37] [Music]
[41:38] returned the word see and then shall
[41:41] appear the sign of son of man in heaven
[41:43] do you know what happens in heaven
[41:44] before it happens on
[41:46] Earth so we've seen it now you said
[41:49] brother Wayne what about them Stars
[41:50] falling from Heaven questions and
[41:52] answers brother Brandon says actually he
[41:54] says that or he tells us this he tells
[41:56] us uh I'm in the wrong sermon there amen
[41:59] he tells us that over in
[42:02] the Christ the mystery he actually calls
[42:05] the fallen stars Fallen
[42:08] Angels Luthers Wesley said they didn't
[42:12] keep their first estate and when the
[42:14] stars fall from Heaven the moon don't
[42:17] give her light and the Sun is darkened
[42:19] but he cometh with power to see the sign
[42:22] of the son of man in heaven and why are
[42:24] we seeing the sign of the son of man in
[42:26] heaven because the sign of the son of
[42:27] man's coming to the Earth it's not just
[42:30] going to stay in the heavens the
[42:32] scripture says it won't for the Lord
[42:34] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[42:37] shout and a voice and a trump of the
[42:40] Archangel this will not be something
[42:43] that happens outside of this Earthly
[42:48] bride brother if you could just put it
[42:51] off somewhere see if you could just put
[42:53] it off somewhere it'd be easier on us
[42:54] but this is coming to the church now
[42:57] brother bam actually ties directly great
[42:59] Pon of Revival 1954 he said You shall
[43:02] see the son of man coming in the cloud
[43:04] with a power and great glory and when
[43:07] these things begin to come to pass then
[43:09] look up lift up your heads your
[43:12] Redemption draweth nigh and over in the
[43:16] book of Zechariah the 14th chapter and
[43:18] the seventh verse it shall be known not
[43:21] day or the night but it shall come to
[43:23] pass in the evening
[43:25] time there shall be light so brother
[43:27] ties together Luke and Zechariah 14 for
[43:32] evening light now watch this brother
[43:33] bramman trying to do God a service he
[43:36] says see here it is there should be
[43:38] signs in the heavens above now he's
[43:39] talking about the cloud we got a picture
[43:41] of that cloud amen he's talking about
[43:43] the cloud they took the picture of there
[43:45] in Tucson Arizona amen now this this has
[43:49] actually been in scripture now if if
[43:50] you're a Bible student you know this
[43:53] this is Daniel the 7th chapter this is
[43:56] the Ancient of Days right if you're
[43:59] studying now you go to Daniel 2 and
[44:02] remember Daniel 2 there's a rock coming
[44:04] out of the mountain what's it doing
[44:07] coming against the kingdoms of the earth
[44:10] now in in Daniel 2 the headship Jesus is
[44:13] a rock coming out of a mountain in
[44:16] Daniel 7 the same kingdoms of the earth
[44:19] represented by different creatures but
[44:22] this time instead of seeing a rock out
[44:24] of a mountain he sees a cloud in the
[44:26] heavens
[44:27] yeah so the rock out the mountain the
[44:30] cloud and the heavens both are speaking
[44:32] of supreme authority over the kingdoms
[44:36] of the earth now watch this because the
[44:40] sign shall be in heaven above
[44:41] earthquakes in diverse places now he's
[44:43] placing it right there go back to the
[44:44] cloud picture there he says now the son
[44:46] of man the day in Luke the son of man
[44:49] will reveal himself again reveal himself
[44:52] and the world will look on Sodom and
[44:54] Gomorrah brotherr don't even be ignorant
[44:55] of spiritual things scay search these
[44:57] scriptures and then you think you have
[44:59] eternal life they are they which
[45:02] testify now what's what he's doing he's
[45:05] tying two scriptures in Luke directly
[45:07] together In This Cloud he shall a sign a
[45:10] son of man shall appear in heaven and at
[45:13] that day shall the son of man be
[45:16] revealed he's showing you the signs in
[45:19] heaven and the manifestation is going on
[45:22] on the earth what he showed in heaven
[45:25] was happening on the earth and it it was
[45:27] from this place that he goes back and
[45:29] says I am to return and preach the Seven
[45:32] Seals which restores the word to give
[45:35] the church full Authority and power it's
[45:39] the son of man in heaven now you say
[45:41] preacher what does this have to do
[45:43] anything it's because that the
[45:45] resurrection power of Jesus has been
[45:47] held in Gloom and in darkness but in the
[45:51] evening time he's promised there would
[45:53] come a
[45:54] light that these Seven Seals would re
[45:57] reveal the mysterious thing that was
[45:58] showed up in heaven Amen brother bam
[46:01] tells us of course immediately that this
[46:04] cloud is tied to Revelations the 10th
[46:07] chapter now if we just go over there
[46:10] some of you this very very um very
[46:12] common to you so a amen should be easy
[46:14] to you amen but this Cloud now to people
[46:17] that don't understand this your amen
[46:19] matters
[46:21] Right This Cloud was Revelations
[46:24] 10 in picture form
[46:27] you're seeing Luke the sign of the son
[46:29] of man in heaven brother Ram is telling
[46:32] us it's also Revelations 10 and he tells
[46:35] us that Revelations 10 fulfills Luke
[46:40] 17:30 is that right now watch what this
[46:43] day they took this picture across
[46:45] Southern United States and hangs in
[46:47] laugh Magazine see he declares it in the
[46:49] heaven before he does it on the earth
[46:52] now what happened on Sunset Mountain
[46:54] what happened up there of course the
[46:56] this is the Fulfillment of Revelations
[46:58] 10 it's the message fulfilling Luke
[47:02] 17:30 the day when the son of man shall
[47:05] be revealed now Revelations the 10th
[47:08] chapter watch the scripture in the first
[47:10] verse and I saw another Mighty Angel
[47:13] come down from
[47:15] heaven clothed with a
[47:18] cloud and a rainbow upon his face and as
[47:22] it were the Sun and his feet were as
[47:25] pillars of Fire the beautiful thing in
[47:28] Revelation 10 you said brother Wayne
[47:29] what does it mean I love how brother Ram
[47:31] says it this day this scripture is
[47:34] fulfilled we don't have to ask what it
[47:36] means anymore we have perfect
[47:39] interpretation to the word of God it
[47:42] already
[47:44] happened Hallelujah brother Roy
[47:46] Shrewsberry used to have a paper did you
[47:48] ever see it brother Roy they actually
[47:50] wrote brother brandom questions and
[47:51] answers and somebody sent it in to him
[47:53] and ask him brother brandham what about
[47:55] Revelations 10 when is this to take
[47:56] place D he flipped it over on the back
[47:59] side of the letter I read it myself on
[48:00] the back side of the letter it said it
[48:02] was already fulfilled when I was out
[48:04] there in
[48:05] tucon amen you see what he's saying is
[48:07] the Fulfillment you can read it and say
[48:09] well what does it mean but when brother
[48:11] bam says but it's fulfilled that's the
[48:13] answer to the question so what it was to
[48:16] bring was it was to open up the
[48:19] Fulfillment of Revelations 10 to fulfill
[48:22] scriptures before our eyes amen it was
[48:24] the mighty Angel descending
[48:27] upon the church amen in the day of his
[48:31] power he will have a body can I just say
[48:34] it like that amen the day when the
[48:36] headship comes he will have a body upon
[48:39] the Earth that will be willing to
[48:42] receive the headship of Jesus Christ
[48:45] when I look at this this Mighty angel
[48:47] coming down amen we can we can we can
[48:49] look at this a lot of ways but but can I
[48:51] can I just can I just say this very
[48:54] clearly without proving it to you but I
[48:55] think you know it's so good amen would
[48:57] help me amen that we are the body of
[49:00] Jesus
[49:02] Christ we we we are the body of Jesus
[49:07] Christ amen and we see here that his
[49:10] feet as are pillars of fire the feet is
[49:16] the body of Jesus
[49:19] Christ the body is in Revelations 10
[49:23] it's not just the headship in
[49:24] Revelations 10 the body body is in
[49:27] Revelations 10 the seventh seal brought
[49:30] him back to the Earth can I say it she
[49:35] is him she is his feet she is his legs
[49:39] she is his arms come on Church we've
[49:42] read 100 scriptures he's got a body in
[49:44] the heavens but because he's there he
[49:47] has a body on the earth that is
[49:50] operating by The Same Spirit he's the
[49:52] bride he's a Heavenly bridegroom she is
[49:55] an Earthly
[49:57] bride and the headship was appearing
[50:00] there which showed the amen I I always
[50:03] love it when I show that I always love
[50:05] can you show that again that cloud
[50:06] picture because I I always love this
[50:09] part I I like to think about this that
[50:11] cloud setting there now I've always
[50:13] thought of this is wonderful that's the
[50:16] head it's a picture of the head where is
[50:20] the
[50:22] body see the body was already on Earth
[50:27] and this is only a sign that they're
[50:29] receiving headship amen the word was
[50:33] coming the word is in the church the
[50:36] secret is the word is in the bride look
[50:39] at this when you see this Acts chapter 2
[50:42] now when you go back to the Bible this
[50:44] is this is and you you have to you have
[50:46] to I know that some people really know
[50:48] this and some people don't understand
[50:49] this so it's okay I'll just want to
[50:51] cover a couple things here some people
[50:54] thinks the Holy Ghost is a motion it's
[50:57] not some people thinks well the Holy
[51:00] Ghost is shouting or dancing it's some
[51:02] type of motion it's it's not now those
[51:05] things are effects of his coming
[51:09] by but the Holy Ghost is a
[51:12] person he's not the third person he is
[51:16] the person of Jesus Christ is that right
[51:19] and when Paul met him on the road to
[51:22] Damascus after his resurrection he met
[51:25] him in a pillar of Fire now let's see
[51:27] that light amen he met him in a pillar
[51:29] of fire and when he saw that mysterious
[51:32] light he looked at it and said Lord who
[51:34] art thou amen Lord the the fire above
[51:37] brother bram's head there he said Lord
[51:39] who art thou and the Bible said it spoke
[51:42] back and said I am Jesus in whom thou
[51:46] crucified I he says come from God and I
[51:51] have returned to God and Paul met him
[51:54] after his resurrection in a spiritual
[51:57] body now listen this is the Declaration
[51:59] of this age is that same Pillar of Fire
[52:02] that was in the days of apostle Paul is
[52:05] in the last days in The Bride of Jesus
[52:08] Christ listen I'm not making this up we
[52:10] have a
[52:12] picture Paul don't even have a picture
[52:15] of it but you believe it without a
[52:17] picture but God was so M man wanting you
[52:20] to see it so wanting you to believe it
[52:23] my critic took that picture I didn't
[52:25] take it brother Ray didn't take it our
[52:27] friends didn't take it the devil had
[52:30] somebody take it oh I wish I bet he
[52:32] wished he could take it
[52:35] back but they took it and that same
[52:37] Pillar of Fire that was over with Paul
[52:40] that was in the book of Acts has
[52:43] returned in this day and has been
[52:45] identified not as a ghost but it's been
[52:48] identified as the literal life of Jesus
[52:52] Christ unconquered by traditions and
[52:55] unconquered by man made theology he
[52:58] Remains the Same after 2,000
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:02] years woo
[53:04] brother so preacher what does that have
[53:07] to do with me how many here's got the
[53:08] Holy Ghost this
[53:10] morning lift him up high now how many
[53:13] got the Holy Ghost in here this morning
[53:14] do you know what you received when you
[53:16] received the Holy Ghost you received
[53:18] amen this light brother Bram said a lick
[53:21] of this light came into you in Acts
[53:23] chapter 2 the Bible said that clothing
[53:25] tongues of Fire fill them where they
[53:27] were setting it wasn't that they spoke
[53:29] in tongues it was fire came in them
[53:32] where they were setting and when God got
[53:35] in them they had the same God in them
[53:38] that created the heavens and the Earth
[53:40] and we receive not another Holy Ghost we
[53:43] got the same Holy Ghost this morning
[53:46] that created the heavens and the Earth
[53:48] has come into our lives as a Creator and
[53:51] the power of God listen when I when I
[53:53] look back here brother Bram said that
[53:54] Pillar of Fire broke itself up and in
[53:57] blaz as clums went upon them and fire
[54:00] set upon
[54:02] them and they were filled with the Holy
[54:04] Ghost 120 of
[54:06] them I I don't mean to call people teach
[54:09] things so I don't think you're
[54:11] embarrassing but the Church of Christ
[54:13] actually teaches there was only 12 that
[54:14] could give the Holy Ghost I I had Aunt
[54:16] Church of Christ we had a lot of good
[54:19] discussions and I told her what you
[54:21] going to do with the Bible it said 120
[54:24] got the Holy Ghost she said it don't say
[54:26] that
[54:26] I said yes it does and we sat down and
[54:29] took the Bible and we begin to read read
[54:31] the Bible I found out that some Churches
[54:33] don't teach the Bible they teach the
[54:35] people without reading the Bible and
[54:37] then the people walk away with an idea
[54:39] about scripture they've actually never
[54:40] even read but the Bible said 120 of them
[54:44] were filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[54:46] spoke with tongues and gave utterance
[54:48] and they was so unseenly that they
[54:51] thought that they were
[54:53] drunk come on church but they had a new
[54:56] wine and you can't put new wine in an
[54:58] old bottle amen but God has sent some
[55:02] new bottles in this generation that is
[55:04] rering for the holy ghost power of
[55:06] almighty
[55:09] God y'all y'all know the scripture
[55:11] somebody my good well I'm going to
[55:13] preach y'all's okay I'm preaching look
[55:15] look somebody says to me well brother
[55:17] Wayne the new birth is without sensation
[55:19] look when Mary received but you but
[55:20] you're only taking part of the word you
[55:22] have a thought and you want to make that
[55:24] thought stick but but go to the Bible
[55:26] Bible the Bible said she said be it unto
[55:28] me according to Thy word but after the
[55:30] death burial and resurrection of Jesus
[55:32] she went to the upper room for herself
[55:35] and she got drunk and staggered in the
[55:37] spirit of God and brother BR said if
[55:39] Mary had to get drunk to get into heaven
[55:42] the Church of the Living God has got to
[55:44] get the same experience come on we're
[55:46] not going in on just a couple Creeds
[55:49] it's the power of the Resurrection that
[55:52] is coming to the church with the Holy
[55:55] Ghost and Power amen the pillar of fire
[55:57] has
[56:00] returned I salute the return of the
[56:03] pillar of Fire in My Generation I say
[56:06] open up the doors of True Word
[56:08] Tabernacle and let him come in open the
[56:11] doors of our heart let him come in he's
[56:14] welcome in the house of
[56:20] God and the absolute brother randam
[56:22] tells us this he says see we come
[56:25] together because each one of us is
[56:27] holding a part of
[56:30] God I'm about to get a shouting
[56:33] spell each one of us is holding a part
[56:36] of God you thought you was nothing every
[56:38] one of you is holding a part of God
[56:39] that's got the Holy Ghost and look at
[56:41] what brother bandam said and when we
[56:43] come together the pillar of fire is
[56:45] manifested in its
[56:47] wholeness no wonder coming to church
[56:50] feels so
[56:53] good when Church sets together in
[56:55] heavenly plac places then the fullness
[56:57] of the power of God is in the church
[56:59] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[57:02] and spiritual offices brings the pillar
[57:05] of fire back
[57:07] again W brother brother randam says he
[57:11] separated himself in the pillar of fire
[57:13] divided himself among the People
[57:15] clothing tongues I'm just giving you a
[57:16] couple things to nail this down the
[57:18] pillar of fire again that God in Christ
[57:21] was the same person and here it is back
[57:24] as the Holy Spirit
[57:27] the pillar of fire has returned as the
[57:30] Holy
[57:32] Spirit ain't that
[57:34] powerful that's why I'm not scared of
[57:36] the Holy
[57:39] Ghost I know who he
[57:43] is the pillar of fire God in Christ the
[57:45] same person and here he is as the holy
[57:47] spirit in countdown brother Bram said

[1:01:14] Christ so preacher why why then do we
[1:01:19] put all of the emphasis on Jesus being
[1:01:22] lifted to the right
[1:01:23] hand y'all y'all get done yall going to
[1:01:26] think I'm a Jesus
[1:01:28] only why you put all the emphasis
[1:01:31] because if it was for by one man we all
[1:01:35] fail Adam caused that fall but the last
[1:01:39] man
[1:01:41] Adam fixed it
[1:01:44] all one man explained it I thought it
[1:01:46] was powerful he said you got a bunch of
[1:01:47] guys on ski rope and you got seven of
[1:01:49] them or how many ever of them and he
[1:01:51] said a guy names Adams on the front and
[1:01:52] a guy named Adams on the back and he
[1:01:55] said the first Adam slips and all of
[1:01:57] them's connected to the Rope so they're
[1:01:59] all going down the slope but that last
[1:02:02] Adam gets a
[1:02:04] foothold and one man caused the fall and
[1:02:07] the other man stopped the fall well I
[1:02:10] tell you what that last man that Adam he
[1:02:12] stopped all the foolish he stopped all
[1:02:15] the things the devil did my Bible said
[1:02:18] he was manifested to destroy the works
[1:02:20] of the devil and one man destroyed
[1:02:24] everything the devil ever did against
[1:02:26] the church and Adam sold us out but
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ paid the debt that we might
[1:02:31] come back to
[1:02:36] Sons now C can I take this just for a
[1:02:39] moment just for a type you know your
[1:02:41] Bibles the Book of Joshua we're
[1:02:42] generation Joshua right the Book of
[1:02:44] Joshua do y'all remember the great
[1:02:46] Joshua chapter 10 when he spoke the word
[1:02:50] and it was in a great battle and it
[1:02:52] happened in the evening time do you see
[1:02:54] the correlation
[1:02:56] greatest battle ever fought in the
[1:02:59] evening time amen and darkness was
[1:03:02] settling in brother Bram said had
[1:03:03] Darkness settled in the enemy would
[1:03:06] reunite and they would have lost the
[1:03:08] battle he said but Joshua did something
[1:03:10] he used the power of the spoken word and
[1:03:14] made the sun stand still right and there
[1:03:17] were five major Kings in that battle
[1:03:19] that had come against Joshua and the
[1:03:21] Bible tells us they whipped them they
[1:03:23] whipped all those armies but God had
[1:03:26] them do something special with them five
[1:03:27] Kings he had them put them in a cave
[1:03:31] until all their abilities were destroyed
[1:03:35] and they were still Kings but they were
[1:03:37] powerless Kings they were still Kings
[1:03:40] but they were defeated Kings they were
[1:03:43] Kings but powerless and defeated and
[1:03:47] after the battle was settled after
[1:03:49] Joshua one and everybody who raying
[1:03:52] Joshua God told Joshua said you go back
[1:03:54] and get him out of that cave now
[1:03:56] and they brought five Kings out of the
[1:03:58] cave and laid them down before the men
[1:04:01] and the Bible said the captains of
[1:04:02] Joshua's Army was instructed to come and
[1:04:06] put their foot on the neck of those
[1:04:08] kings now watch something that's already
[1:04:12] defeated but God wouldn't leave it
[1:04:15] there you see God could have just said
[1:04:17] cut their head off and let's go but he
[1:04:19] didn't do that because God was laying a
[1:04:22] type in the
[1:04:24] scriptures that God God would defeat
[1:04:27] this Army through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:30] and he would take their Chief Captain
[1:04:32] Lucifer and he would so whip him that he
[1:04:35] would destroy every ounce of power that
[1:04:38] he had but in the end time he's going to
[1:04:41] let the devil out of the cave but
[1:04:43] there's going to be a bride on the earth
[1:04:45] that'll put that devil under her foot
[1:04:48] amen every devil will become subject to
[1:04:51] the Bride of Jesus Christ I say it's
[1:04:54] time to possess our land and bring Satan
[1:04:57] under the feet of the church in the last
[1:04:59] days I don't believe God put you here
[1:05:02] Amen to be to be subject to no
[1:05:06] devil you say preacher what are you
[1:05:10] talking about can I tell you the Bible
[1:05:12] said he put all things under his feet I
[1:05:15] ain't got time to teach no more I got to
[1:05:17] preach now amen he put all things under
[1:05:19] his feet but that was the prophecy
[1:05:23] brother brother Howard Genesis chap 3:1
[1:05:26] 15 come at an appropriate time when
[1:05:29] everything was lost but God raised up
[1:05:31] and prophesied and remember what he said
[1:05:33] he said there shall be enity between thy
[1:05:35] seed and the woman's seed and he said
[1:05:37] the woman's seed shall bruise the head
[1:05:39] of the
[1:05:40] serpent and that was a Messianic
[1:05:42] prophecy of Jesus Christ that he would
[1:05:45] destroy the devil and his seed now
[1:05:49] listen that laid in the scripture and
[1:05:51] even when Abraham heard the prophecy
[1:05:54] that thy seed shall possess the Gates of
[1:05:55] its enemy that Prophecy of the seed
[1:05:58] possessing the gates was the prophecy of
[1:06:00] the seed of the woman but now it had
[1:06:03] laid upon Abraham and his children
[1:06:05] because Jesus would be the real Seed of
[1:06:09] Abraham the super Seed of Abraham to
[1:06:12] possess every gate well when he was born
[1:06:14] to the Earth he wasn't born through
[1:06:16] Sarah or through Hagar he was brought
[1:06:18] through Mary by the spoken word right
[1:06:21] and in him was the life of almighty God
[1:06:26] now watch this because he lived upon the
[1:06:28] Earth amen and he was progressing in
[1:06:30] power and Revelation and authority and
[1:06:32] look he conquered over the grave amen
[1:06:35] when he raid Lazarus and he conquered
[1:06:37] over sickness when he healed the sick
[1:06:39] among them he told the DEA to hear he
[1:06:42] told the dumb to speak he told the winds
[1:06:44] to shut up and the waves to be still
[1:06:47] showing power over nature and
[1:06:51] creation right but sin nature itself
[1:06:55] still
[1:06:56] existed so it wasn't until we go to the
[1:06:59] cross that we see that Genesis 3:15
[1:07:02] would be fulfilled and through the cross
[1:07:05] of Calvary Jesus would deliver a fatal
[1:07:09] Blow To The Head of Satan oh Church of
[1:07:12] the Living God there never was a day
[1:07:13] like that
[1:07:15] day I love how brother randam said he
[1:07:17] said that was the day Satan got his
[1:07:19] backbone
[1:07:20] broke that broke the backbone of hell
[1:07:24] when Jesus died
[1:07:26] at Calvary had he knew who he
[1:07:29] was had he knew what he was doing he
[1:07:32] would have left him alone but when he
[1:07:35] killed him upon Mount calvary's cross
[1:07:37] the prophet said Jesus reached out and
[1:07:40] got a hold of Man's enemy of death and
[1:07:42] pulled it into his bosom and he took the
[1:07:45] Stinger of death but brother when they
[1:07:47] put him in the grave it wasn't over when
[1:07:49] they put his body in the Tomb it wasn't
[1:07:52] over amen but while he was in hell he
[1:07:55] was fulfilling the scriptures that all
[1:07:57] things should come under the feet of
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ and the prophet of God said
[1:08:01] in the mighty conqueror that he went
[1:08:03] straight down to the devil's hell and he
[1:08:05] knocked on the door and he wanted the
[1:08:07] keys of death Hell In The Grave is that
[1:08:09] right so what did he do he reached in
[1:08:12] and took the key out of the hand of the
[1:08:14] devil that held every believer in this
[1:08:17] church oh Church of the Living God I
[1:08:19] love how brother Brown he's a
[1:08:21] Storyteller you know he said he wrapped
[1:08:22] on the door and Satan come to the door
[1:08:24] he said we f fin got the seed we finally
[1:08:27] got him but brother man said but here's
[1:08:30] the problem amen amen they thought they
[1:08:32] had him in Jacob and they thought they
[1:08:33] had him in Moses but they had the real
[1:08:35] one now and this real one had Authority
[1:08:39] he had never seen before and he reached
[1:08:42] out brother B said he took that Old
[1:08:43] Devil by the neck I'd like to been there
[1:08:45] wouldn't
[1:08:47] you sister you know what happened when
[1:08:49] he took that Devil by the neck he took
[1:08:51] your depression in a stronghold of his
[1:08:53] own hand and you know what what he said
[1:08:56] he said the cross of Calvary has paid
[1:08:59] the sin debt and every claim against you
[1:09:02] as a child of God has been strucken down
[1:09:05] in this moment then that's why this
[1:09:07] morning I believe that the answer to
[1:09:09] depression is not psychology it's not
[1:09:12] pills it is the power of God that
[1:09:15] delivers the church in the last days I
[1:09:18] believe it's real I believe it's still
[1:09:20] true and when Jesus took that devil you
[1:09:23] know what he done he took the keys off
[1:09:25] off his side brother Samuel and you know
[1:09:27] what when you take a man's keys to his
[1:09:29] own house that's
[1:09:31] embarrassment and the prophet of God
[1:09:33] said he slapped that devil and kicked
[1:09:35] him back into hell and Slamm the door on
[1:09:38] him and he left there with death hell
[1:09:41] and the grave and he took the keys of
[1:09:43] the whole thing with
[1:09:45] him you say preacher what would he do
[1:09:47] with them keys well I tell you what he
[1:09:49] did he went back on the day of
[1:09:51] Pentecost and he gave them keys to the
[1:09:54] Church of the Living God and the form of
[1:09:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:09:59] same conquering power that conquer death
[1:10:02] hell and the grave is in every believer
[1:10:04] in this building this morning and you
[1:10:06] got a right to step on every devil upon
[1:10:09] every
[1:10:12] situation it's all under your feet every
[1:10:15] devil of depression is under your feet
[1:10:18] every sickness is under your feet every
[1:10:20] disease is under your
[1:10:24] feet
[1:10:26] you said preacher I'm going to try to
[1:10:28] conquer that devil let me give you good
[1:10:29] news he's already
[1:10:32] conquered Jesus conquered him at Calvary
[1:10:35] he is a conquered enemy amen he is a
[1:10:38] king of a conquered Army he is a
[1:10:40] defeated giant he is a defeated enemy
[1:10:43] and you hold the keys of his defeat in
[1:10:47] your hands when you receive the Holy
[1:10:50] Ghost no wonder he don't want that Holy
[1:10:53] Ghost
[1:10:54] religion
[1:10:56] you know what Adam lost when he sinned
[1:10:58] he lost his godship you know what you
[1:11:01] get when you get the Holy Ghost you're
[1:11:03] godship you return back to your original
[1:11:06] creation as a son or a daughter of God
[1:11:09] with authority and with power listen you
[1:11:12] are not a weak trotten down bunch of
[1:11:14] nobodies that has no Authority or no
[1:11:16] power we are the daughters and sons of
[1:11:19] the most high
[1:11:22] God hallelujah I believe God is given
[1:11:25] Liberty in this age for a
[1:11:30] reason sure Satan's loosed out of the
[1:11:32] cage sure them Kings were loosed out of
[1:11:35] the caves but it was so God could show
[1:11:38] his exemplify power over
[1:11:42] them through his
[1:11:45] children
[1:11:47] Lord and a might Angel come down out of

[1:12:21] Christ Baptist whatever denomination you
[1:12:23] can name the message of the hour is
[1:12:26] supreme to
[1:12:27] it not because I believe it it's his
[1:12:32] message that's right that's right a

[1:13:19] how many Bible readers we got in
[1:13:21] here I don't have to read it to you then
[1:13:25] and he set one of them
[1:13:27] foot on the
[1:13:29] land and he set the other one on the
[1:13:32] sea now lift up that foot that's on the
[1:13:34] land say what's under there every
[1:13:38] denomination all of
[1:13:40] Rome in Daniel the 7th chapter you can
[1:13:43] read you can read about all of the
[1:13:45] creatures you can read about all the
[1:13:47] kingdoms in Revelations 13 you see four
[1:13:50] Kingdoms in one and it's coming out of
[1:13:54] the sea yeah and 131 I got them
[1:13:57] backwards sorry 131 comes out of the sea
[1:14:01] Rome so what what's that mean to the
[1:14:04] church that denominational
[1:14:07] Spirit they'll put their foot on it
[1:14:10] that's
[1:14:11] right that Catholicism that
[1:14:16] romanism that that that that says see
[1:14:19] it's just a holy man in the
[1:14:22] pulpit and the body is just a group of
[1:14:24] people trying to
[1:14:26] endure now that's a
[1:14:28] lie this is not a Pulpit
[1:14:31] Ministry this is the body movement of
[1:14:33] the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:35] Ghost where he's taking a hold of every
[1:14:38] life placing a foot putting putting his

[1:14:47] foot on the on the waters what's he

[1:14:53] Jaden if you're a Bible reader you know
[1:14:55] this Rome is going to rule the world
[1:14:59] that's right right she's the mystery

[1:19:42] spirit of male and female was divided in
[1:19:44] the Garden of Eden right by God you get
[1:19:48] rid of the spirit of God and the next
[1:19:51] thing you know those two Spirits begin
[1:19:53] to pervert and come back together
[1:19:55] now you watch brother Brandon back in
[1:19:56] the ' 50s he's calling out this
[1:19:58] perversion with a woman wearing pants
[1:20:00] which would be almost an innocent thing
[1:20:03] now and the and the denominations
[1:20:05] wouldn't stand against it but now when
[1:20:08] people are crossdressing and they're
[1:20:10] wanting to get married and they're
[1:20:11] trying you can't even I'm I'm from Old
[1:20:13] School Brother Ray you got to forgive me
[1:20:15] but I still say thank you sir and ma'am
[1:20:16] and I'm at a hotel and I say thank you
[1:20:18] ma'am thank you sir I'm at the was and I
[1:20:21] have man I lately I've been saying I got
[1:20:23] to lose my manners
[1:20:27] I just got to lose my manners and just
[1:20:29] start
[1:20:31] going cuz I sometimes honestly do not
[1:20:36] know I'm not trying to be rude it's just
[1:20:39] the truth but it could have been stopped
[1:20:42] If the message of the hour would have
[1:20:44] been listened to in the 50s this whole
[1:20:46] country could the country would have
[1:20:49] never got into it now I'm coming on to
[1:20:51] you amen now watch this as long as the
[1:20:53] message has ruled in your home then your
[1:20:56] sons will look like men and your
[1:20:58] daughters will look like daughters but
[1:21:00] if you start taking out the message and
[1:21:02] the next thing you know you don't read
[1:21:04] your Bibles you don't play the tapes you
[1:21:05] don't get them into church amen you'll
[1:21:07] start seeing that Spirit drift on them
[1:21:10] come on and you can't blame the child
[1:21:12] it's the age we're living in amen but
[1:21:15] there's somebody going to get the Holy
[1:21:17] Ghost and that homosexual spirit is
[1:21:20] going to be put under the foot of the
[1:21:21] Church of the Living God there will be a
[1:21:24] group of young men in this age that look
[1:21:27] like young men there'll be a group of
[1:21:29] young women that look like young women
[1:21:31] because the message of the hour has
[1:21:34] divided it and brought it back to a
[1:21:36] reality in this
[1:21:38] hour church I say this our young people
[1:21:41] I want to congratulate you fathers I
[1:21:43] want to thank you mothers we don't have
[1:21:45] to preach on these things every week and
[1:21:47] I'm not going to amen but we don't have
[1:21:49] to do this every week you know why cuz
[1:21:51] we got masam and daddies in this
[1:21:53] building and we got good parents and
[1:21:55] good deacons and good leaders that have
[1:21:57] taught their children the right things
[1:22:00] and I say God bless you but don't never
