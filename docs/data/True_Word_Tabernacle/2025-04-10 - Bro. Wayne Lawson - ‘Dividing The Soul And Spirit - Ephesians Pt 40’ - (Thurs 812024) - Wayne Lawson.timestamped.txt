[6:00] tremendous time in the Lord and I felt
[6:02] like the Lord really moved Among Us and
[6:04] amen we had a prayer line Saturday night
[6:07] but to be honest with you uh I felt like
[6:09] 90% of the work was done before the
[6:11] prayer line ever started amen the Holy
[6:14] Spirit just moved in the church and uh
[6:17] there was Deliverance and hearts that
[6:18] were delivered all over the congregation
[6:21] long time before the prayer line even
[6:23] began the Holy Spirit had had done most
[6:26] of his work and we certainly are
[6:27] thankful for that tonight and amen uh we
[6:30] just have a few things on our heart

[7:42] Journey he's on his way home we
[7:43] certainly glad to see him get some
[7:45] vacation time uh in Ephesians the 6th
[7:48] chapter and I want to read tonight from
[7:51] the word of the Lord Ephesians chapter
[7:54] 6 and we want to read the 17th verse
[7:57] here and we'll be also reading a few uh
[7:59] Hebrews chapter 4 verse
[8:10] 12 Paul said and take the helmet of
[8:15] salvation and the sword of the
[8:18] spirit which is the word of God and
[8:22] let's turn to book of Hebrews chapter
[8:27] 4 I want to read from the 12th ver verse
[8:30] here very very powerful
[8:36] scripture Hebrews 4 and verse
[8:40] 12 for the word of God is
[8:44] quick and
[8:46] powerful and
[8:48] sharper than any two-edged
[8:51] sword
[8:53] piercing even to the dividing aunder of
[8:57] the soul and the spirit
[9:00] and the joints and the moral and is the
[9:03] discerner of the thoughts and the
[9:06] intents of the heart God bless you as
[9:09] you could be seated tonight I want to
[9:11] speak to you for a few minutes this
[9:12] evening I'd like to talk to you about
[9:14] dividing of the soul and the spirit
[9:18] dividing of the soul and the spirit
[9:20] greatest battle ever fought brother
[9:21] brandham tells us a beautiful uh thing
[9:25] when he tells us a human being is made
[9:27] up like a grain of wheat it's a seed a
[9:30] human being is a seed physically you're
[9:33] a seed of your father and mother and
[9:35] life came from the father and the pulp
[9:38] came from the mother and the two
[9:40] together the egg and blood comes
[9:41] together and the blood cell is life and
[9:44] there it begins and develops making the
[9:46] child now any seed has a shell on the
[9:49] outside and the inside is the pulp and
[9:53] then inside of the pulp is the germ of
[9:56] life well that's the way we're made we
[9:59] are Body Soul and Spirit that's the way
[10:02] we are made Body Soul and Spirit now
[10:07] when you uh I I was just thinking on
[10:09] this while I was gone I was just kind of
[10:10] fellowshipping with the Lord on it and I
[10:12] was looking at situations and as we uh
[10:15] of course looking always for the Holy
[10:17] Spirit to give direction on healing and
[10:20] manifestations of his word and his truth
[10:23] and I was just considering some subjects
[10:25] here out of this uh out of this series
[10:27] on greatest battle and it come into my
[10:29] heart I got to thinking of how uh that
[10:32] when we look at people we we almost want
[10:35] to just see one person uh like if you
[10:38] look at someone you think that you're
[10:39] just looking at one person when that's
[10:41] really not true when you maybe when you
[10:44] go to the doctor the Medical Science now
[10:46] I'm not talking about Christian doctors
[10:47] of course they have better knowledge
[10:48] than this but if you go to a medical
[10:50] doctor and they're trying to treat a
[10:52] patient they're always just treating one
[10:54] person that's why sometimes medical
[10:57] science cannot reach into the place that
[11:00] is exactly needed because they're trying
[11:02] to just fix one person but when the
[11:05] scripture details that there is more
[11:07] than one person now there's just one
[11:09] body but there's more than one person
[11:11] brother brandom uh of course is telling
[11:13] us this I we'll take it Apostle Paul in
[11:15] 1 Corinthians 15 and44 Paul will say
[11:18] that it is sown a natural body and is
[11:21] raised a spiritual body and there is a
[11:24] natural body and there is a spiritual
[11:27] body so it is written the first Adam was
[11:29] made a living soul and the last Adam was
[11:32] made a quickening spirit now how be it
[11:34] that was not first which is spiritual
[11:36] but that which is natural and afterwards
[11:38] which is spiritual now the first man is
[11:40] of the earth Earthly the second man is
[11:42] the Lord From Heaven and is Earthly such
[11:45] as they are also that are Earthly and is
[11:47] in the Heavenly such are they also that
[11:49] are Heavenly and we have been born of
[11:51] the image of the Earthly so also shall
[11:54] we bear the image of the Heavenly so
[11:57] he's evenly dividing that there is a
[11:59] body body that is a natural body and
[12:01] then there is a spiritual body I'll give
[12:03] you another one in second Corinthians 5
[12:05] and verse one for we know that if there
[12:07] Earthly House of this Tabernacle be
[12:10] dissolved we have a building of God not
[12:12] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[12:14] for We Grown uh this we grown earnestly
[12:17] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[12:19] house which is from heaven now Paul
[12:21] calls this human body he calls it a
[12:23] tabernacle I love how in other places he
[12:26] calls it this body of humiliation
[12:29] brother Bram calls it a pest house and
[12:32] so we know the human body on the outside
[12:35] is still subject to the elements of the
[12:38] world that we live in uh becoming sick
[12:41] and and a aging process and the the
[12:44] Mortal being that we're living in amen
[12:46] but in 1 Corinthians 15 and 40 Paul will
[12:49] say this he said that there are bodies
[12:51] celestial bodies and there are bodies
[12:54] terrestrial so there is bodies that are
[12:56] terrestrial there are bodies that are
[12:58] cel Ral so the terrestrial body would be
[13:01] a pest house it would be a human body it
[13:04] would be the veil that we live in it
[13:06] would be a human body now most people
[13:08] trying to deal with people they're only
[13:10] trying to deal with that one man but you
[13:12] cannot deal with sin or sickness only by
[13:16] dealing with one man that's right
[13:19] brother Bram says in the experiences he
[13:21] said there are two people he said now
[13:23] there are two people in one see amen
[13:26] there are two people in one there are
[13:28] two men enticing Spirits if you'd like
[13:30] to see it in the scripture you remember
[13:32] in the Bible when Jehoshaphat and Ahab
[13:35] was up at the Battle of ramoth Gilead
[13:37] y'all remember how that uh Ahab was
[13:39] representing the the natural man the
[13:42] backsliding king and then here come
[13:44] Jehoshaphat and when he got up there
[13:46] they had 400 prophets prophesying to
[13:49] them go down into the battle so there
[13:51] are two men I I would like to say that
[13:54] represents the two men in you you can
[13:56] see a Jehoshaphat and you can see an a
[13:59] Ahab now when they were trying to get
[14:01] aligned for the battle that they were
[14:02] about to enter into Jehosaphat was
[14:05] hearing ahab's prophecies that was
[14:08] coming and the prophet of God said but
[14:10] but there Jehoshaphat said isn't there
[14:13] one more voice and he said that question
[14:16] was coming to him amen because he wasn't
[14:18] satisfied with what he was hearing
[14:20] something in him told him something was
[14:23] wrong with what he was hearing now
[14:25] that's where brother bam many times in
[14:26] questions and answers on some of them
[14:28] real particular question questions
[14:29] brother bandam will say I really don't
[14:31] have scripture to answer it he said but
[14:32] if there is a question then don't do it
[14:35] remember that because he said the
[14:37] question is coming from the soul realm
[14:39] in other words there is something on the
[14:41] inside of you that's not satisfied with
[14:43] the answer that you're getting so you
[14:45] got two different men there the outward
[14:47] man the outward man of course is happy
[14:50] with an intellectual gospel or
[14:52] denominational idea or you know
[14:54] something to dismiss or substitute the
[14:56] things of God but now that inner man is
[14:59] not satisfied with that amen I I'll say
[15:02] that he represents him that said isn't
[15:04] there one more amen and and of course
[15:06] then amen the outward man said yeah
[15:09] there's one more but he hates us he's
[15:11] always prophesying against us he's
[15:13] always correcting our errors and he's
[15:16] always dealing with our flesh but but
[15:18] there was an inner man amen that wanted
[15:21] to hear what the word of God had to say
[15:23] about it and I certainly believe tonight
[15:25] that's the truth that there's an inner
[15:27] man see man was not made to lie see amen
[15:30] so that way there is a conscience and
[15:32] there's a subconscious but man's not
[15:34] made to lie so you can you you can see
[15:37] there's something that unnerves him now
[15:39] amen so that's telling us that we can
[15:41] never give the Inner Man a substitute
[15:44] amen by the outer man so brother bam
[15:47] says it many times how that they now
[15:49] people because they're supposed to be a
[15:51] new birth he said they try to substitute
[15:53] the new birth with something else amen
[15:55] knowing there should be so we substitute
[15:58] it with a hand Shake but a handshake
[16:00] Never Satisfied the human soul amen a a
[16:03] joining of a church it never satisfies
[16:06] the human soul you can even have a good
[16:08] crying spell it will not satisfy the
[16:11] human soul but it would only be that God
[16:14] would deal with that soul with his word
[16:17] and only the word can truly bring a
[16:19] birth to satisfy the Inside Man and what
[16:22] he needs see that's the thirst of man is
[16:25] to come in contact with God y'all know
[16:28] that God is his word amen we know that
[16:30] God is his word so until the soul comes
[16:32] in contact with God there is no life
[16:35] within that Soul amen you see a man
[16:38] brother man said you can take a man and
[16:39] dress him up amen he said you can take
[16:42] him out here he's made out of wood and
[16:44] you can dress him up with chalk and
[16:46] whatever you want to ever so much he has
[16:49] no feelings he has no conscience he says
[16:52] he'll never take the place of a real man
[16:55] and neither will a bogus conversion that
[16:58] walks up and says I've joined the church
[17:00] or I'll try to do better it'll never
[17:02] take a place of a genuine oldfashioned
[17:05] God sent Holy Ghost conversion that
[17:08] makes a man different in his heart see I
[17:11] can't do it because there's no life in
[17:14] there there's nothing to give him life
[17:17] life has to come from God and God's way
[17:20] of giving life is through the word of
[17:22] God Amen you see we find out in the
[17:25] scriptures amen that there is an inside
[17:28] man I love how brother BR sometimes
[17:30] he'll say it he'll say we need to pinch
[17:32] the Inside Man and wake him up Amen in
[17:35] other words pinch your conscience and
[17:37] and make that Inside Man awaken to the
[17:40] things of God see there is an inside man
[17:43] God Amen made man he first made him in
[17:46] his own image with the spirit and then
[17:49] he put a man in five senses now not to
[17:52] declare him but to contact his Earthly
[17:55] home see a scientific part of a man the
[17:58] te see The Taste the feel the smell the
[18:01] hear is only to contact the Earthly
[18:05] home but the Inside Man which is a
[18:09] spirit contacts God since science knows
[18:13] nothing about it do you see the thing
[18:16] that contacts the Inside Man is God the
[18:20] thing that contacts the outside man is
[18:23] intellectuals it's the it's the outward
[18:25] expression of man there is an outside
[18:28] man look at the prophet says that
[18:29] there's an outside man that God put a
[18:32] human flesh here and gave him five
[18:34] senses to contact his Earthly home and
[18:37] the inside men the spirit has two senses
[18:40] and that is unbelief and that is Faith
[18:44] now see then Faith then is a substance
[18:47] it's not just a thought is that right
[18:50] faith is not just a thought faith is an
[18:53] actual substance amen it's a substance
[18:56] the outside man is govern governed by
[18:59] five senses but the Inside Man is
[19:02] governed by two senses Faith or its
[19:05] doubt see first before you were a
[19:08] natural man you were a supernatural man
[19:11] is that right the supernatural man is
[19:13] first now we think of it in backwards to
[19:16] what God thinks of it when you think
[19:17] about the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[19:19] we think about going into the Tabernacle
[19:21] and we think about it that it's the
[19:23] outer courts and then we go into the
[19:25] inner courts and then we go into the
[19:26] holies of holies but God starts with his
[19:29] word and then he puts a movement of a of
[19:33] an inner court and then he puts an outer
[19:35] court and then there's the congregation
[19:37] and he does it because he begins with
[19:39] his word he he's not on his way to his
[19:42] word he begins with his word and God
[19:45] began you with his word he put something
[19:49] in you and provided a way of course you
[19:52] could live in this human life and God
[19:54] put first his own image which the image
[19:56] of God and God is a supernatural being
[19:59] and he was a supernatural man and he put
[20:01] him in five senses and none of those
[20:04] senses will declare his Heavenly Home
[20:07] those five senses will only declare his
[20:09] Earthly home and God giving them senses
[20:12] to contact not to contact God you were
[20:15] never given your outward senses to
[20:18] contact God that's not what they're for
[20:20] they're for dealing with this life but
[20:22] there's an inside man that deals with
[20:25] God and Only God Alone can fix what's WR
[20:28] wrong with the Inside Man do you see
[20:31] there are two men in that understanding
[20:34] there are two trees in the Garden of
[20:36] Eden there is a tree of knowledge and
[20:38] there is a tree of life there's two men
[20:40] and each of them feed from a different
[20:42] tree the natural man feeds from the Tree
[20:45] of knowledge amen and there amen of
[20:47] course then one of them is the tree of
[20:49] knowledge the other tree of life and man
[20:51] can never know God by knowledge so no
[20:54] matter how much well we educate
[20:56] ourselves or how Pastor our smart our
[20:59] pastor is no matter how many degrees
[21:01] he's got God is not known by education
[21:04] neither is he known by scientific
[21:07] research the only way God is known is by
[21:11] faith amen that's the only way to know
[21:14] him is by faith Amen brother BR says it
[21:16] like this when man was eating on the
[21:18] tree of life he had eternal life but
[21:21] when he left the tree of life and went
[21:23] to the tree of the knowledge the first
[21:24] bite he took he separated his Fellowship
[21:28] from God God now here's the thing there
[21:30] are two men there are two bodies amen
[21:33] and there are two
[21:35] trees now you ever think that inside of
[21:38] your body is another man brother man
[21:41] said did you know that there's another
[21:42] man inside your
[21:45] body that's amazing isn't it that
[21:48] there's another person inside your body
[21:51] he's called The Inside
[21:54] Man and the inside man is of god it's
[21:58] the spirit spirit of God that's inside
[22:01] our
[22:02] being well glory be to God Amen now
[22:06] here's the thing you have now two men
[22:09] you have two consciences you have a
[22:12] subconscious and you have a conscience
[22:15] in other words in this room right now
[22:16] you're conscience of the natural things
[22:18] that are here uh that I used to preach
[22:21] some uh youth camps and and one time I I
[22:24] was watching a bunch of young guys and I
[22:26] and this is a little crude of saying it
[22:27] but you know if you got a bunch of young
[22:29] guys and there's a bunch of pretty young
[22:30] girls and they're all in the same room
[22:32] usually the boys don't pick their nose
[22:34] at that
[22:36] time because they're conscience that
[22:39] there's some girls on the other side of
[22:40] the room see they're conscious of this
[22:43] right but there is things that you're
[22:46] not conscious of and that's the
[22:49] subconscious so you might be conscious
[22:51] you're in this room and I'm preaching
[22:53] and you're speaking and you can hear
[22:55] everything going on in here but there
[22:57] are things in the sub conscience realm
[23:00] that your natural man is not aware that
[23:02] they are here but there is an inner man
[23:05] that is in contact with God and He Knows
[23:08] by his word that the angels of the Lord
[23:11] are encamped about this building now now
[23:13] we've got to mmit to this whether we
[23:16] feel it or we don't feel it has nothing
[23:18] to do with the reality that it's here
[23:21] amen whether as an excitement on our
[23:23] flesh or not an excitement on our flesh
[23:26] that presence is in this building right
[23:29] now and has nothing to do with the
[23:32] contact of God and the inner man do you
[23:35] see what it is way down in our hearts
[23:37] there's a subconscious now brother
[23:39] brandham was telling us in his own
[23:41] Ministry that what his ability to do is
[23:44] a profit was to move between the
[23:46] conscience and the subconscious without
[23:48] ever going to sleep now if you dream you
[23:51] enter a subconscious world and you go
[23:53] somewhere you don't know where you went
[23:55] but you come back with memories and
[23:56] feelings and you got all kinds of ideas
[23:58] but brother brandom said and sometimes
[24:00] when God gives it of course it declares
[24:02] the future and all other things but
[24:04] brother brandom could go to sleep while
[24:05] standing in the Pulpit talking to you
[24:08] and he would have a vision which would
[24:09] move him from the conscience to the
[24:11] subconscious realm and he could declare
[24:14] things that were not in the time realm
[24:16] at all but he could go back to Eternity
[24:19] where the Garden of Eden was tell you
[24:21] what color Eve's eyes was tell you
[24:23] exactly what happened in the fall he
[24:25] could tell you what color brother our
[24:27] lord Jesus robe was the day he was
[24:29] baptized he could tell you the pain and
[24:31] Agony on the road to Calvary he could
[24:33] speak about the woman at the well he
[24:35] could talk about the resurrection in the
[24:37] inner realm the subc conscience would
[24:39] make the scripture reality rather than
[24:42] just something you read because the
[24:44] inner man was moving into those reals
[24:47] now brother Ram said if you start
[24:49] overseas and he said you're going in a
[24:51] ship he said you see the whole ship he
[24:54] said it's all there he said but what's
[24:56] controlling that ship is the man up
[24:59] there in the Wheelhouse he said you got
[25:01] a you got a motor and you got a boat you
[25:03] got everything there but the thing
[25:05] steering it is there's a man up there in
[25:08] the Wheelhouse you might not be able to
[25:10] see and brother man said you're looking
[25:12] out the outward man is just a ship
[25:15] sailing through life but there's a man
[25:17] in the Wheelhouse that you're not able
[25:19] to see but that is the fell that's
[25:22] steering the ship tonight there is a
[25:24] there's a person down on the inside
[25:26] after all there's one who steering the
[25:28] ship amen now we got to get these fellas
[25:31] agreeing he brother said now we got two
[25:33] men and we got to get them in agreement
[25:35] with one another that's where healing
[25:37] comes is when they get in agreement one
[25:39] to another he said sometimes people come
[25:41] up to the prayer line and they'll say
[25:43] brother bradam I really have a lot of
[25:45] faith that I'm going to get healed and
[25:46] he said and I know they
[25:48] don't he said the outward intellectual
[25:51] man is saying I have faith he said but
[25:53] the inner man is still doubting he said
[25:56] and until the Inner Man and the outer
[25:59] man align with the word of God there can
[26:01] be no healing so it takes God to move
[26:05] the inner man in line with the word of
[26:08] God to make it come to pass and to
[26:10] believe it now many times when brother
[26:12] randam is speaking about faith to move
[26:14] mountains and he's talking about M Mark
[26:17] 11 and 24 he's discussing that there are
[26:20] more than one man and we've got to get
[26:22] them all in line before we could move
[26:24] forward now here's the thing there's got
[26:27] to be uh there's got to be an alignment
[26:29] of them two before that we can move
[26:31] forward now here Jesus brother B tells
[26:34] us this he says see you got to get these
[26:36] fellas agreeing is that right and then
[26:38] we move forward your orders and
[26:41] everything see there's nothing to make
[26:43] you doubt it now you go back to the
[26:45] hospital in the morning they say your
[26:46] arm is still sift your Cancer's still
[26:48] there now that wouldn't have one Speck
[26:50] of it see that wouldn't phase you a bit
[26:53] if this all agreed see because Faith
[26:56] does anything
[26:58] now in you is God you that have the Holy
[27:03] Ghost now how many's got the Holy Ghost
[27:04] in here
[27:05] tonight in you is the Holy Ghost and
[27:08] brother BR says see do you believe that
[27:11] Jesus said I give you power now let me
[27:14] show you the weakness of the church by
[27:16] God's grace I give you power over
[27:19] unclean spirits you'll cast them out not
[27:22] I will you will you will cast them out
[27:26] cast them out devils they shall speak
[27:28] with new tongues they shall take up
[27:31] serpents and they shall drink dreadly
[27:33] thing and it will not harm them now we
[27:36] think of the great St Paul one time he
[27:38] landed on a certain Island and the ship
[27:41] was wrecked and God had promised him
[27:44] that he was going to a certain
[27:46] destination is that right he had to go
[27:47] to Rome see Caesar amen and he was going
[27:49] to a certain destination he was going to
[27:52] Rome to stand before Caesar and he
[27:54] believed God so he was helping the men
[27:57] he had changed about him as a prisoner
[28:00] and he was helping the man throw some
[28:01] wood in the fire now remember the
[28:03] prophecy when he was in the ship and and
[28:05] it looked like the ship would be
[28:06] destroyed that they would all be lost
[28:08] and the angel of the Lord came to Paul
[28:10] in the middle of the night and Paul rose
[28:11] up and said it's come to me now I got to
[28:13] go to Caesar and and he said anybody as
[28:16] long as you stay with the ship you're
[28:17] going to make it it's going to be okay
[28:19] amen and they held on and amen and and
[28:21] when the ship broke apart they floated
[28:24] ashore and he went up on the bank and
[28:26] the people sitting there thought well
[28:27] for sure this man's a prisoner or some
[28:29] murder or something like this he's in
[28:31] change he's bound and he starts warming
[28:33] his hands over the fire I'm paraphrasing
[28:35] to you he starts warming his hands over
[28:37] the fire and a serpent reaches out of
[28:39] the fire and bites him so the people
[28:41] sitting around surely thought well he
[28:43] deserves what he's getting because
[28:45] evidently he's not going to outrun the
[28:47] Justice amen but when when the scripture
[28:49] says but Paul then shook the thing back
[28:52] in the fire now they said it was a
[28:54] venomous State brother Brandon said more
[28:56] than likely it was a Mamba and when it
[28:58] bit him but look Paul never got fear
[29:01] upon him but anybody knows that the
[29:04] natural man built by Mamba is about to
[29:07] die in the natural realm the outside man
[29:10] knows this is the end of the road for me
[29:12] amen but there was another man in Paul
[29:15] it wasn't just one Paul sitting there
[29:18] there was another man on the inside and
[29:21] brother randam said when he throw that
[29:22] word that great deadly Beast serpent bit
[29:24] him right through his hand and the Beast
[29:27] was so deadly until if it bit a person
[29:29] he would drop dead the minute or two his
[29:32] chains he was a prisoner he must be a
[29:34] murderer he might escape the storm but
[29:36] he's never going to escape this serpent
[29:38] he's going to die but look Paul looked
[29:40] and seen it and this all agreed so the
[29:44] body the spirit the soul all agreed and
[29:47] there was not one Speck of fear amen
[29:50] there was not one Speck of fear it said
[29:53] they would take up serpents and it would
[29:55] not harm them he looked at that deathly
[29:58] bite and there was no fear in him well
[30:01] glory to God Amen a serpent bit him and
[30:03] he had no fear in him because he had the
[30:06] Inner Man and the outer man lined up
[30:09] together with the word of God Amen if
[30:12] they take up serpents they shall not
[30:14] harm them isn't that powerful that that
[30:16] word was so aligned that there was no
[30:18] harm not one Speck of
[30:20] fear you know what brother Bram said
[30:22] fear will do he said it'll bring it on
[30:25] amen he said you know fear is a giant of
[30:27] course fear is something that will bring
[30:29] destruction but there was no fear in
[30:31] here and he looked at that deathly bite
[30:33] without fear and he said Satan Steeps in
[30:36] Satan brings in fear but God said my
[30:38] perfect love it cast out fear he said
[30:41] there you are I'm God's man and there
[30:43] hangs a serpent but there's not one
[30:46] Speck of fear there he said he looked
[30:48] around and said well he shook it off in
[30:50] the fire and he got some more sticks and
[30:52] put it on and they saidwell Paul ain't
[30:54] you afraid you're about to fall dead he
[30:56] said certainly not I cannot fall dead
[30:59] for the holy spirit is in me now watch
[31:02] what he says the very holy spirit that
[31:04] made the heavens and the Earth had so
[31:06] charged this man with power to the death
[31:10] then that Fang of the serpent wouldn't
[31:11] even go into his body because his whole
[31:14] body was full of the spirit the same as
[31:17] it was full of blood Oh Glory he had
[31:20] blood in his body but there was more
[31:22] than blood in the body of Paul the power
[31:25] of the Holy Spirit was just as much in
[31:27] the body as the human blood was in the
[31:29] body and when that power that Holy
[31:32] Spirit began to move in there the
[31:34] Serpent's bite couldn't even touch him
[31:36] oh church I'll tell you what a powerful
[31:38] reality the serpent couldn't B him
[31:40] brother man said every little cell of
[31:42] blood is life and there you are all
[31:45] charged full of the Holy Ghost why
[31:48] certainly they walked on water now how'
[31:50] they do it because them men were lined
[31:53] up they walked on water they done great
[31:56] Miracles there was so perfect ly in
[31:58] harmony with God that's right what was
[32:00] it amen Paul knew he couldn't die you
[32:03] know why Paul couldn't die cuz God had
[32:05] already told him you're going to Rome
[32:07] and you're going to stand in front of
[32:08] Caesar he knew there wasn't no serpent
[32:10] could keep him out of Rome he knew there
[32:13] wasn't no shipwreck going to keep him
[32:15] out of there because inside he knew this
[32:18] man has got to fulfill the will of God
[32:21] that's exactly what faith is tonight
[32:24] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[32:26] and Faith won't move the outward man but
[32:29] faith will move the inward man and when
[32:31] the inward man begins to move the body
[32:34] has got to move with it because the
[32:36] inner man is in charge of the whole
[32:39] thing amen I don't know about you but
[32:41] I've had some rough mornings trying to
[32:43] get up and go to church and I I felt
[32:45] tired early in the morning time or two
[32:47] especially when you travel halfway
[32:48] around the world and you got an early
[32:50] morning service amen sometimes you don't
[32:52] want to get you don't even want to get
[32:53] out of bed but you know what you do
[32:54] brother Noah you say to your foot foot
[32:57] I'm the one in charge get yourself out
[32:59] of this bed and you tell the first foot
[33:02] you tell the second foot and when you
[33:04] hit the floor you begin to charge that
[33:06] body and say this old body is going to
[33:08] go to the house of God today and if I'm
[33:11] tired I'm going to preach and if I don't
[33:13] feel good I'm going to worship because
[33:15] there this body this human body is not
[33:19] the one in charge of my life there is
[33:22] another man in there he's the one that's
[33:26] in charge
[33:28] now you know what brother BR meant when
[33:29] he said it's not the size of the dog
[33:32] that's in the fight it's the size of the
[33:35] fight that's in the dog who is it on the
[33:37] inside of you I'll tell you who it is
[33:39] it's the spirit of Jesus Christ the
[33:42] great Joshua is on the inside of the
[33:45] church do you see what it is amen he's
[33:47] telling us that that didn't phase him
[33:50] because he had to go Hallelujah couldn't
[33:53] face him because he had to go he had to
[33:56] go stand before him it couldn't keep him
[33:58] from doing it because if he tread on the
[34:01] head of serpents it wasn't going to harm
[34:03] him why he could walk over scorpions and
[34:05] it wouldn't harm him they could wreck
[34:07] the boats and it wouldn't harm him
[34:09] because there was a predestinated will
[34:11] and destination for his life and the
[34:14] devil is not more powerful than the
[34:16] purpose of God over your life I think
[34:19] brother Ray's favorite quote around here
[34:21] is that that Satan can't destroy the
[34:23] purpose of God and if you find the
[34:25] purpose of God in your life and that is
[34:27] inner man ever connects with it you'll
[34:29] know there ain't a devil there is not a
[34:31] hell there is not an angel out of hell
[34:34] that can destroy the purpose of God that
[34:36] has B over your life now I know amen
[34:40] that gets rough on legalists but we're
[34:41] not legalists we're
[34:44] Believers amen now watch because the
[34:47] prophet of God tells us this he said
[34:49] they kept waiting for him to fall dead
[34:51] but he couldn't cuz he had to go to Rome
[34:53] Hallelujah watch brother bam in this
[34:55] message of uh in confirmation and
[34:57] commission watch him transfer it to his
[34:59] own Ministry and he says a few minutes
[35:01] he said a commission had been confirmed
[35:03] that he had came down out of Heaven
[35:06] remember how they at the fire they
[35:07] change their confession he's a murderer
[35:09] he's he's getting what he deserves and
[35:11] then they say it must be God In the
[35:12] Flesh brother man said there it was
[35:14] confirmed his commission to go before
[35:16] Rome he said and here it is they said he
[35:19] shall tread of scorpions and and nothing
[35:22] shall harm them and they had the
[35:23] evidence to prove it now I got to hurry
[35:25] friends I'd stay all night here but
[35:27] there's a few more things the prophet
[35:29] said there shall come a day that is
[35:31] called not night or day but a dismal day
[35:34] and in the evening time it shall be
[35:36] light so brother Bram is now
[35:38] transferring that to his own Ministry
[35:41] and he's telling you I've got a
[35:43] destination amen before he began his
[35:46] ministry he was going to introduce the
[35:48] Messiah to the age was he not he was
[35:50] going to introduce Christ to the age
[35:53] there wasn't a denomination that could
[35:54] stop him is that right but listen
[35:58] brother Ram's greatest problem was not
[36:00] the denomination how many knows that
[36:03] brother Ram said oh no he said Martin
[36:04] Luther it was no no was no great miracle
[36:07] he could overcome the Catholic church he
[36:09] said it was the Fanatics around him that
[36:12] he would have to overcome the Fanatics
[36:14] around him now now I don't I don't want
[36:16] to get too doctrinal in this area but I
[36:18] want to do say this brother brandom got
[36:20] snake bit
[36:22] too y'all know what that snake was it
[36:25] was a deity Doctrine
[36:28] that's right yeah I can read it to you
[36:30] brother Bram said it like this he says
[36:32] see uh he says that a few nights ago I
[36:35] had a visitation from the Lord I seen a
[36:37] baby a serpent which was yelling black
[36:39] and telling me right along and the thing
[36:41] struck me on the
[36:43] leg but the blood was so rich it didn't
[36:45] take effect on me now listen to this
[36:48] this is this message if you want to Rick
[36:50] it up
[36:51] 19616 Revelation chapter 5 he originally
[36:54] titles it bruise serpent they retitled
[36:56] it I don't know why but well maybe I do
[36:58] know why
[37:00] but he said that he said but the blood
[37:03] was so rich it didn't take effect and I
[37:05] looked down where it had bit me and I
[37:07] turned to get a gun to shoot the thing
[37:09] right in the middle and I turned the gun
[37:11] to shoot it and he said just pick up the
[37:13] stick laying there and I turned my back
[37:15] and picked the stick up and it wiggled
[37:16] in some water he said well I can't it
[37:19] wiggled in water that's people right the
[37:21] thing wiggled off into some people and
[37:23] the prophet in 1960s telling them that
[37:26] that serpent bid him but watch he
[37:29] couldn't it couldn't destroy him then
[37:32] the seals have not even opened the
[37:34] revelation of the word has not come into
[37:37] the Perfection to bring this bride into
[37:39] his resurrection amen so brother bam is
[37:42] telling us my blood was so rich that it
[37:45] couldn't affect me now he's not talking
[37:46] about the outer man having rich blood
[37:49] he's talking about the inner man having
[37:51] rich blood listen brother B said I think
[37:53] we need a blood a food to build up our
[37:56] resistance from our diseases now don't
[37:59] take food and let your body get weak
[38:01] you'll be subject to diseases if you
[38:03] don't eat you're going to be subject to
[38:05] diseases and diseases will break into
[38:07] the bloodstream and here you're gone if
[38:09] your blood isn't rich and pure then the
[38:12] disease will go right into the
[38:13] bloodstream he says so you've got to eat
[38:16] good nourishing food to keep your
[38:18] bloodstream right if you don't you're
[38:20] allergic to diseases that's what's a
[38:23] matter with a lot of Christians come on
[38:25] now amen let me see what brother says
[38:27] here he says now the very next chapter
[38:30] the opening of the seals we have to skip
[38:32] and go to different places he says now
[38:34] we get to these seals and when they
[38:36] begin to open the mysteries of them oh
[38:38] how glorious with a rich spiritual
[38:41] vitamins amen I tell you this if you're
[38:44] not eating on the opening of the word
[38:46] there is no vitamin to keep that spirit
[38:49] I me listen I I I I don't hope this
[38:51] don't sound harsh we got some visitors
[38:53] God bless you and I pray for you you
[38:54] forgive me if I get too far here but
[38:56] I'll say this this amen the deity
[38:59] direction does not believe in the open
[39:01] of the seals and I always wondered why
[39:04] amen but if you can believe in the
[39:06] opening of The Seven seal you know this
[39:08] message wasn't introducing William
[39:10] brandom this is this message was not
[39:13] about a man William Brandon it was
[39:15] introducing Jesus Christ to the age
[39:18] we're living in the first pull was for
[39:20] the outer man the second pull was for
[39:23] the spirit man but the third pull is to
[39:26] the soul of the God of Jesus Christ and
[39:29] it'll take the opening of that word to
[39:32] eat if you want to stay without diseases
[39:35] eat that somebody said well brother wait
[39:38] I just can't get over problems and you
[39:40] know forgiveness and situations come up
[39:43] and I don't know how amen we can't
[39:45] listen brother B said it was weak blood
[39:47] he said but if you'll enrich that blood
[39:49] with good vitamins that healing would
[39:51] come through the bloodstream life is
[39:54] healing Church Life is healing you take
[39:57] the life out of a body and there's no
[39:59] healing in the body Amen brother man
[40:02] said it over and over cut the finger of
[40:03] a man if he's dead it'll never heal he
[40:06] said but if there's life in that man
[40:09] amen and the blood is Flowing right amen
[40:11] that that will heal back because there's
[40:14] power in the blood there is life In The
[40:17] Blood Church of the Living God the
[40:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the life in
[40:22] the blood that flows into the Church of
[40:24] the Living God and as long as there is
[40:26] life in the church there is healing in
[40:29] the church if there's life in the church
[40:32] there is Deliverance in the church
[40:35] Hallelujah if there's life in there
[40:37] there's something in there to bring
[40:39] grace and mercy now there's two
[40:43] different men there's an outside man and
[40:47] brother bam said this he feeds on
[40:49] psychology and intellectual but the
[40:51] Inside Man feeds on the word of God woo
[40:58] there are true trees there are two men
[41:01] they're both carnal and they are natural
[41:04] God has never been known by science am
[41:07] man he's never known by science he's
[41:08] only known by faith that's where it
[41:11] started was in the Garden of Eden two
[41:12] trees one was Tree of Life the other was
[41:14] a tree of knowledge and man took his
[41:17] first bite he separated himself from the
[41:18] Tree of Life and every time he bites off
[41:22] the tree of knowledge he continually
[41:23] gets further away from the tree of life
[41:25] because he begins to think he knows how
[41:27] to reason it out and you cannot reason
[41:30] out God you got to come back to the
[41:34] simple tree of life yes sir and abide
[41:37] under the eating of the fruit of
[41:40] Life glory to God looking into the
[41:44] Unseen you go all the way back to the
[41:45] Garden of
[41:46] Eden and brother Bram says it like this
[41:49] man wants to go after what he sees with
[41:50] his
[41:51] eyes he said that's where he's
[41:54] deceived that's where Satan deceived is
[41:58] by what she could
[41:59] see but the fruit was pleasant to the
[42:02] eye but it was death to the soul
[42:06] amen something can be pleasant to the
[42:09] eye but it's death to the soul right do
[42:12] you see so is it tonight God wants to
[42:14] lead a man so he made a control Tire in
[42:16] the midst of his heart that man would be
[42:19] led by the spirit now getting off on his
[42:21] own leading is what separates him from
[42:24] fellowship see now here's the thing sons
[42:26] and daughters of God are led by the
[42:28] spirit of God your emotions is your
[42:31] control see and you notice a man or a
[42:33] woman that tries to walk after the
[42:35] things of the world can never please God
[42:37] but a man that will not look at the
[42:39] things of the world and just go
[42:40] according to the lead of the spirit
[42:42] they're usually in the will of God there
[42:45] is a great fight tonight Satan took the
[42:48] eye a man's head to control him by his
[42:52] head and God took his heart
[42:57] so both Satan and God is trying to show
[43:00] you something God is trying to show your
[43:02] heart
[43:03] Revelation and Satan's trying to show
[43:06] your eye something else well here's the
[43:08] thing I was just thinking today I wish I
[43:11] was a little more uh scientific I should
[43:13] have probably Googled it or something
[43:15] but the human eye the man's eye it can't
[43:19] see very far actually as far as far is
[43:22] concerned I think they call it the
[43:24] Coralis effect it's a if you're a
[43:26] shooter you know
[43:27] uh it's a I used to survey and it's it's
[43:30] a good example if you set up a survey in
[43:33] uh laser uh you you only get about a th
[43:37] yards out of that or 1,00 feet each way
[43:39] from it a couple thousand feet because
[43:42] that there begins to be elevation change
[43:44] in the Earth because of the curvature of
[43:46] the earth and if somebody believes in
[43:47] Flat Earth y'all don't listen right now
[43:49] okay but there's there's a COR Coralis
[43:53] effect and uh I I'm a fisherman so Lake
[43:57] Erie will teach you a big lesson you go
[43:58] to Lake Arie you go out about 5 miles
[44:01] and the trees get
[44:02] shorter you go out 15 miles on Lake Arie
[44:05] and turn to look back the shore they
[44:06] ain't no Shore because it's out of the
[44:09] eyesight because of the curvature of the
[44:11] earth the earth gets in the way of your
[44:13] vision after only a few miles now if you
[44:17] climb up real high and you climb up in
[44:18] the Spheres and you say I'm going to see
[44:20] further from this from this mountain
[44:22] well if it's not a cloudy
[44:24] day because the atmosphere
[44:27] that you live in in the earth clouds are
[44:29] getting the way I think uh we were just
[44:31] up in B and I was in Edmonton and I
[44:34] think uh uh I think brother Ben went
[44:36] right down through bamp and they' been a
[44:37] big fire in Jasper and and uh the smoke
[44:40] had come into bamp so they really didn't
[44:42] get to see the mountains very well and
[44:44] if you get high on the mountain you
[44:45] can't see because of the clouds so when
[44:46] you get up in that sphere even if you
[44:48] can get higher there's so many
[44:51] atmosphere effects that keeps the vision
[44:54] from reaching a certain point because of
[44:56] the natural natur man so he can climb up
[44:59] in there but see a born again man can
[45:02] climb up in the atmospheres and things
[45:04] see he can get up into Faith until he
[45:07] can see the omnipotence of God isn't it
[45:10] amazing that you could start climbing
[45:12] that you could see the omnipotence of
[45:14] God see when you're down here low in the
[45:16] human realm you're saying that's not
[45:18] possible there's things that I can't do
[45:20] there's that situation it's never going
[45:22] to end this problem is never going to
[45:24] happen but if you begin to climb up into
[45:26] the fear of God in the atmospheres you
[45:30] begin to look and see the omnipotence of
[45:32] God and then you can begin to call every
[45:34] word a positive act because see he's
[45:37] designed you to climb see now man is see
[45:41] then limited by sight he is a sense
[45:43] bound man he's a sense bound existence
[45:47] but if he could climb up high the inner
[45:49] man can climb up high and the beauty of
[45:52] that is you can do it right in the
[45:54] service you you see that you don't have
[45:56] to leave the service to go find a
[45:58] mountain somewhere to climb up high but
[46:00] you can sit right in a service like this
[46:03] and the Bible said that John was in the
[46:06] spirit on the Lord's Day how many
[46:07] represents John here tonight that bride
[46:10] it's not your natural man he's
[46:12] representing he's representing your
[46:15] spiritual man and the Bible said he got
[46:17] in the spirit on the Lord's day so in
[46:19] this leosan age somebody can get in the
[46:22] spirit isn't that powerful somebody can
[46:24] get in the spirit and the prophet of God
[46:27] said it like this when you get in the
[46:29] spirit everything looks
[46:31] different and when he got up in the
[46:34] spirit in Revelations 4 called up out of
[46:36] the loud to see an age into a door that
[46:38] was opened up in heaven what could he
[46:40] see from that door he could see the
[46:42] Throne of God he could see himself
[46:45] sitting around the Throne of God he
[46:47] could look all the way in eternity amen
[46:50] from the island of patmas I tell you the
[46:52] island of patmas was a prison but you
[46:54] can't put a man in prison that can get
[46:57] in the spirit of God you can't keep him
[46:59] down because God can lift him up and he
[47:02] can look up and see beyond now of course
[47:05] Abraham is a great example of this
[47:08] because Faith actually Our Father
[47:10] Abraham being not weak in faith he could
[47:13] look in Romans 4:16 he said therefore it
[47:15] is a faith that it might be of the grace
[47:17] of God to the end of the promise be sure
[47:19] to all that not only that which is the
[47:21] law but to that also which is the faith
[47:23] of Abraham is the father of us all and
[47:26] as it is rich and I have made thee the
[47:28] father of many nations before whom he
[47:31] believed even God who quickeneth the
[47:34] dead and calth things which be not as
[47:37] though they were amen now that's
[47:40] powerful to me now how could he see
[47:43] things that wasn't it's because the
[47:45] natural man wasn't doing the looking see
[47:48] what it was faith that saw it it wasn't
[47:50] the human man that saw it Heen to heal
[47:53] nothing had changed but Faith had
[47:56] changed the inside man that he is able
[47:59] to see see inside man it looks through
[48:02] the eyes and seees things that are not
[48:06] now look it can look into the Unseen say
[48:08] you need a healing tonight it's an
[48:09] unseen thing but the prophet of God said
[48:12] if you need something unseen he said
[48:14] like you say to me I need an acor tree
[48:17] he said I need an oak tree he said well
[48:19] I want it in my front yard he said but I
[48:21] could give you an
[48:23] acre I'm giving you the Unseen version
[48:26] of an oak tree if I give you an ACR you
[48:29] say well give me an oak tree and I give
[48:30] you an ACR I've given you an oak tree in
[48:34] potential I've given you the visible Oak
[48:37] Tree in The Invisible real and if you
[48:40] know the power of a seed you'll take
[48:42] that seed and put it in the place you
[48:45] want it to grow because you know there's
[48:47] a law over the seed that will bring
[48:50] forth of its own kind and brother Ram
[48:52] said it like this now you've got the
[48:54] tree and Seed form and you might as well
[48:56] begin to Rejoice because you got that
[48:58] tree and Seed form it'll produce and you
[49:01] take this ACR and put it in the ground
[49:03] and a little box somewhere and set in
[49:05] the house and keep it watered the first
[49:07] thing you know it comes up as a little
[49:09] acor tree is that right and that trans
[49:12] set it in the yard but you can praise
[49:14] God as sure as you get the acor because
[49:17] you've got the tree already and when God
[49:20] said I am the Lord that Health thee just
[49:23] start praising you got it right there
[49:26] amen amen you don't see results but that
[49:29] don't make any difference see you got it
[49:31] anyhow cuz the word of God is the seed
[49:34] is that right and when a seed is sold
[49:36] with Incorruptible seed what is it it
[49:38] makes the impossible possible because
[49:41] it's the seed of God that has been given
[49:43] to you that is the very story of our
[49:46] faith now we can't use our intellectuals
[49:48] and go
[49:50] there it must be in our faith faith
[49:53] causes you to see things
[49:55] differently you look at the Outlook
[49:57] things are different when faith is
[49:59] looking you ever notice where the Bible
[50:01] said Moses who seeing the
[50:05] invisible who seeing the
[50:08] invisible thought it that he would
[50:10] rather have the reproach of
[50:13] Christ greater than the riches of
[50:15] Egypt so by what he was looking at in
[50:19] the spirit he would rather have that
[50:22] when it's at its worst than Egypt when
[50:25] it was at its best
[50:27] amen is't that powerful he would rather
[50:31] have the worst God had to
[50:34] offer was better than the best the world
[50:37] had to offer because he wasn't looking
[50:40] at it as a natural man it was the inner
[50:43] man that was looking at it and saw by
[50:46] faith what God had said about those
[50:48] people watch you got two men again you
[50:50] got Pharaoh you got Moses Inner Man
[50:53] outer man and they're looking at the
[50:55] same people and the prophet of God said
[50:57] they looked at the same window at the
[50:59] same people and Pharaoh when he looked
[51:01] at it he saw mud dobers he saw he just
[51:04] saw a bunch of slaves he saw something
[51:07] he could make fun of Amen but when Moses
[51:10] looked at it he saw the promise of God
[51:13] when Moses looked at it he saw the grace
[51:16] of God bringing the people out of
[51:18] slavery and becoming the very Heritage
[51:21] of God do you see the outward man looks
[51:24] at the church and they see all the
[51:26] problems and they see all the issues and
[51:28] they see all the humanity but let the
[51:30] inner man look at the same
[51:32] person out the same window at the same
[51:37] problem and the inner man will see it
[51:40] much different than the outer man amen
[51:43] because your outward man is controlled
[51:45] by six different
[51:48] senses or five different senses and your
[51:50] inward man is only controlled by
[51:53] two now brother bam will go into this
[51:55] very powerful
[51:57] and he say now here's the thing a real
[51:59] genine Christian will cope with that
[52:01] inside man that spirit that was back
[52:05] Yonder at the beginning which is the
[52:09] word he was the fullness of all of you
[52:13] your body your spirit and your
[52:16] soul you were in him back under under at
[52:20] Calvary he forew you what you would be
[52:23] here and he only broadcast what would
[52:25] take place now you were were in him you
[52:28] died with him you died to your
[52:32] pride you died to your Fashions you died
[52:36] to the world you died with him in
[52:40] Calvary and you Rose up with him when he
[52:43] rose
[52:45] again see because you've accepted it now
[52:49] you're setting in Heavenly places in
[52:52] Christ well you why I'm sitting in
[52:53] Bluffton Ohio and true word Tabernacle
[52:59] the outward man is sitting in True Word
[53:03] Tabernacle and Bluff in Ohio but the
[53:06] inner man is sitting resurrected with
[53:09] Christ in Heavenly places that where I
[53:14] am there ye may be also that's what he
[53:18] said amen he sent this message to take
[53:21] you where he is if he is lifted up the
[53:24] bride has been lifted up that's right
[53:26] there's an inside man and it will
[53:29] punctuate it with the word of God
[53:31] brother Ram said I learned that years
[53:32] ago I learned that years ago and he goes
[53:35] into the example and he said when my
[53:37] wife died I was holding her by the
[53:40] hands crying for her now watch what he
[53:44] he's talking about the Inside Man and
[53:45] the outside man and my daddy in his arms
[53:51] died this arm right here his daddy died
[53:55] in his arms his wife died and he was
[53:59] crying for
[54:00] her and as I prayed as hard as I
[54:04] could how could I face the public again
[54:07] there's the real
[54:09] issue to preach Divine Healing how could
[54:12] I
[54:13] preach that he is a good god and let my
[54:17] daddy die a sinner how could I preach
[54:20] that I don't know how but I know he's
[54:24] right amen woo am the word of God shall
[54:28] never fail it shall Triumph no matter
[54:31] what it is then I know there was
[54:33] something inside of all these reasonings
[54:36] something's inside of these emotions
[54:39] everything else is like that there was
[54:40] an inside man that held me in that hour
[54:43] listen he didn't feel like shouting that
[54:45] afternoon he didn't feel like having a
[54:47] glory train or having a Jericho March
[54:50] amen he was tore to pieces and and his
[54:52] reasonings were saying there is no
[54:55] reason to preach the gospel there's no
[54:57] reason to preach Divine Healing but
[54:59] there was somebody in his emotions there
[55:02] was somebody else in his reasoning there
[55:05] was an inside man in there that held to
[55:09] the word of God listen I tell you when
[55:11] you can't hold on as a God that can hold
[55:13] on anyhow when you have worn out and
[55:16] fainted and you're tired and you don't
[55:18] know how to go on thank God there's an
[55:21] inside man there somebody tied to the
[55:24] power of God nothing else could have
[55:26] done it everything showed everything
[55:28] proved was wrong and I was wrong but the
[55:31] word of God that was predestinated
[55:33] before the foundation of the world held
[55:34] on
[55:37] inside that Inside Man then is the
[55:42] predestinated word of God from the
[55:44] beginning do you hear what he's saying
[55:46] that's what held on to me that's what
[55:48] made Paul walk past the snake bite
[55:51] that's what made brother bandam move
[55:53] beyond the deity teachings that's what
[55:55] made him move be beond the fanaticisms
[55:58] is there was something that was on the
[56:00] inside amen you sometimes can't reason
[56:03] it
[56:04] out you can't reason it out but it has
[56:07] to be revealed to you now brother Bram
[56:10] brings it up can you bring up that first
[56:11] picture brother Brown brings it up and
[56:13] if you've never seen these pictures it
[56:15] it might help you a little bit um you
[56:18] know how much of a teacher I am so
[56:19] forgive me amen but brother Bram is
[56:22] making this if you're reading greatest
[56:24] battle ever fought soul and Spirit are
[56:26] flipped but in the late 65 6465 he
[56:30] corrects it and says the soul is the
[56:32] inside of the inside and the spirit if
[56:34] you'll watch What's Happening Here look
[56:36] on that outside body look at the
[56:37] influence trying to come into that body
[56:40] look at that sickness fear and hatred
[56:41] strife and envy and lust and pride and
[56:43] Malice and tensions look at all the
[56:45] different look at all the different
[56:47] things attacking that outward
[56:49] man now if you go into that Spirit realm
[56:52] look at how much how much it's shrinking
[56:54] it's shrinking to memory and re
[56:56] reasoning affection imagination and
[56:57] conscience but take one more step into
[57:00] the soul and it's just faith and
[57:03] doubt now in that soul is where the
[57:06] predestinated gene that's the inner the
[57:09] inside man that's on the
[57:12] inside now brother bandam will teach us
[57:15] that's the real you give me the next one
[57:16] there I I've got to hurry quicker than I
[57:18] meant to but let's just put it let's
[57:19] just get it real close Genesis 1 2627 is
[57:23] one man Genesis 27's the other man the
[57:25] gene of God
[57:27] now that's that can I say it to you
[57:29] let's start before we that's the real
[57:31] you how many ever heard brother Ram say
[57:34] it this body that you're looking at it's
[57:35] not the real you but the real you is
[57:38] inside and that real you is Heavenly is
[57:41] that right that real you is theophonic
[57:44] that real you is perfect that's not your
[57:47] theophany body but there is a real
[57:49] theophany there is a perfect there is an
[57:51] immortal it's sinless it lives by the
[57:53] word it's written in the lamb Book of
[57:57] Life yes sir it possesses Zoey life it
[58:00] is the real you now that outward man is
[58:03] Earthly and flesh and it's imperfect and
[58:05] it's mortal and it's born in sin it
[58:07] loves the world it's written in the book
[58:08] of life it needs a new birth it's the
[58:11] negative VI now until you separate them
[58:14] two people you're going to live a very
[58:17] confused
[58:18] life until you're able to understand
[58:21] that that outward man has all kinds of
[58:24] things coming at him all the time
[58:27] that he is open to the elements if you
[58:29] don't put clothes on you get cold see
[58:32] the inner man though he's only moved by
[58:35] two senses by faith or doubt see but
[58:38] that outward man so you you I I'll show
[58:40] it to you in scripture first
[58:42] Thessalonians 5 and 22 23 1
[58:45] Thessalonians 5 and 23 the very God of
[58:47] Peace sanctify you holy I pray God for
[58:49] your whole spirit and soul and body so
[58:54] Paul was teaching this as well you your
[58:56] spirit your soul your body brother bam
[58:58] said you're a triun being now watch this
[59:01] you're a triun being now Hebrews 4 and
[59:04] 12 says that the word is powerful
[59:06] sharper than a two-edged sword piercing
[59:09] even dividing the soul and the spirit
[59:11] people say well to me is there really a
[59:13] difference of Soul and Spirit Well just
[59:14] read that scripture it tells you there
[59:17] is now it says to the dividing of so it
[59:20] tells us it can be divided there is
[59:23] somebody that can divide the difference
[59:25] between the SP Spirit and the Soul it
[59:28] takes the word of God so there's two men
[59:31] there's an outward man and an inner man
[59:32] and the inner man is divided in two
[59:34] people there is a spirit and there is a
[59:36] soul can I say it to you there is three
[59:39] kinds of Believers in every
[59:40] crowd and instead of looking over at
[59:43] somebody just look at
[59:46] yourself this old boy on the
[59:48] outside I hate to tell you but he don't
[59:51] believe
[59:52] nothing he's just an unbeliever now if
[59:56] you can get pretty deep in this but can
[59:58] we just can we just say it that the
[1:00:00] Bible said that that the dust shall be
[1:00:03] the meat of the serpent all the days of
[1:00:05] its life where's that serpent bite the
[1:00:09] people brother Bram said God's calling
[1:00:12] these children to separate from the evil
[1:00:15] one who is it the man on the outside see
[1:00:19] taste feel smell
[1:00:22] here now look what he's telling you
[1:00:25] there's an unbeliever out here on the
[1:00:28] outside but there's a unbeliever but
[1:00:31] there's a mate believer somewhere
[1:00:32] somebody said well you're calling me a
[1:00:34] mate believer I say your spirit is I say
[1:00:37] your spirit can flip-flop on you I say
[1:00:40] you can be in one crowd and feel one way
[1:00:42] and get in another crowd and feel
[1:00:43] another way and your spirit will
[1:00:45] flip-flop on you just like this but down
[1:00:48] inside of that spirit is a soul that's
[1:00:51] right and that soul is a gene that come
[1:00:54] from God from before the foundation of
[1:00:56] the world and that is a real believer he
[1:01:00] believes when you're up he believes when
[1:01:02] you're down he believes when you're sick
[1:01:04] he believes when you're in trouble he
[1:01:06] believes when the police is shouting he
[1:01:08] believes when it's not shouting he
[1:01:10] doesn't care because he's a Believer I
[1:01:13] tell you God has made amen the spirit of
[1:01:16] God has come that he might be able to
[1:01:18] separate that you might see there's an
[1:01:20] inside to the inside that's where you
[1:01:23] are that's where your start is is in the
[1:01:25] soul inside this body see there is a
[1:01:28] control tower it's directed from the
[1:01:31] inside see that's the control tower the
[1:01:33] inside of the inside the soul now the
[1:01:36] Third Realm now we won't spend too much
[1:01:38] much timer but let's just go here to the
[1:01:40] to to for a couple more minutes the five
[1:01:42] senses are on the outer realm and
[1:01:44] there's only one way you can get into
[1:01:45] that body is by those five senses yeah
[1:01:48] but then there's five that lets you get
[1:01:50] into the spirit realm of conscience and
[1:01:52] reasoning and memory and you know there
[1:01:54] there's five for the spirit five for the
[1:01:56] soul there's 10 of them which represents
[1:01:59] the 10 spies that were back there in the
[1:02:01] days of Joshua and they all said we
[1:02:04] cannot possess this
[1:02:06] promise we can't do it amen but there's
[1:02:09] a soul in there saying we can possess
[1:02:12] this promise we can receive this word of
[1:02:15] God inside of that inside what is it
[1:02:18] it's a soul now what is a soul it's
[1:02:22] you you are a soul
[1:02:26] the part inside of you that see Never
[1:02:32] Dies now in leadership brother Brown
[1:02:34] says it about is plain there's a bunch
[1:02:36] of quotes but let me get this one's real
[1:02:38] plain he said now watch this many of you
[1:02:40] think I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:42] Ghost I'm going to
[1:02:43] heaven that don't mean one thing that
[1:02:47] you're going to heaven you can have the
[1:02:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in
[1:02:54] your life
[1:02:56] and still be lost and go to
[1:03:00] hell H ain't that
[1:03:03] amazing look brother Bram then says
[1:03:05] there is an outside
[1:03:07] person you've got five different senses
[1:03:11] and God gave you senses to contact him
[1:03:13] your Earthly home with see taste feel
[1:03:15] smell and hear then you got a spirit on
[1:03:16] the inside of that and it has five
[1:03:19] Outlets of conscience love so forth five
[1:03:21] Outlets to contact the spirit world your
[1:03:23] physical contacts the physical
[1:03:26] your spiritual contacts the spiritual
[1:03:29] but inside of that you got a
[1:03:31] soul and that soul is a gene that has
[1:03:35] come from God now look what he's telling
[1:03:38] you this is outside of the realm of
[1:03:41] whether you has set in the rain or not
[1:03:43] set in the rain this is what God has
[1:03:46] sent into this age that is predestinated
[1:03:49] and determined of God to have a bride
[1:03:52] amen it's the word of God brother Ram
[1:03:54] said things that are to be I got the B
[1:03:55] AP ISM of the Holy Spirit he said that
[1:03:57] has nothing to do with
[1:03:59] it I know that's tough but let's just
[1:04:01] get to the real point that has nothing
[1:04:03] to do with it it's only a temporal gift
[1:04:06] for you the real gift is your
[1:04:11] soul that was born of God it controls
[1:04:13] the whole thing now you say preacher
[1:04:16] what are you trying to get at let's just
[1:04:17] continue for a moment amen what he says
[1:04:19] here he says remember now kesis and
[1:04:21] balum they prophesied that didn't have
[1:04:24] nothing to do with this inside unless
[1:04:27] that was God's
[1:04:28] seed oh now we're at the point unless
[1:04:32] that was God's seed his Gene from the
[1:04:34] beginning predestinated you're finished
[1:04:36] I don't care how much you shout and
[1:04:38] speak with tongues or run and Shout It
[1:04:40] has nothing to do with
[1:04:42] it wo he said preacher where you going
[1:04:45] can I say it the rain falls on the just
[1:04:48] and the
[1:04:49] unjust the rain when it comes now
[1:04:52] brother Ram said it comes of course when
[1:04:54] the rain falls on the church he said it
[1:04:56] falls on the just and the unjust he said
[1:04:58] of course the rain is coming for the
[1:05:00] just of course God sent the rain for the
[1:05:02] just but the unjust get under the rain
[1:05:05] the same as the just get under the rain
[1:05:08] but listen you can pour all the water
[1:05:09] you want to on a cabar it's always going
[1:05:12] to be a cuar but if you ever get the
[1:05:15] water on a weak grain Hallelujah it'll
[1:05:18] be a grain to begin with you see what
[1:05:20] brother Bram saying you amen he's saying
[1:05:22] to you amen I joined the church he said
[1:05:25] you can join the church but so did the
[1:05:27] just and the unjust and you could join
[1:05:29] all the church you want but if you
[1:05:30] wasn't a seed from the beginning Church
[1:05:33] join it ain't never going to help you
[1:05:35] amen you can get the Holy Ghost but if
[1:05:37] you won the seed from the beginning it's
[1:05:39] never going to help you so if you ever
[1:05:41] recognize you're a seed it don't matter
[1:05:44] if it's good days bad days it don't
[1:05:47] matter if it's trouble it don't matter
[1:05:49] if there's rejoicing it means I am a Jee
[1:05:53] that has come from God hallelujah
[1:05:55] hallelujah it's outside the realm of
[1:05:58] humanity the soul the
[1:06:02] soul now watch brother bam said see to
[1:06:05] understand it you got to take the
[1:06:06] message of the
[1:06:07] hour he says see that's it you got to
[1:06:10] take the message of the hour either you
[1:06:11] receive it or you reject it that's
[1:06:13] eternal life you receive the message or
[1:06:17] reject it that's your eternal life the
[1:06:19] choice of your conduct you're either for
[1:06:22] God or against God and the outward
[1:06:24] Expressions what's on the inside many of
[1:06:27] you think I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:28] Ghost I'm going to heaven but that don't
[1:06:30] mean that you're going to heaven you can
[1:06:32] have the baptism every hour in your life
[1:06:34] and be lost and go to hell the Bible
[1:06:37] says
[1:06:38] so I thought the Bible says so yes the
[1:06:42] Bible says so First Corinthians the
[1:06:43] Bible said you can speak with tongues of
[1:06:45] men and angels but if you don't have
[1:06:48] charity look what he saying amen the
[1:06:50] baptism of the spirit that was falling
[1:06:52] in the Pentecostal age they were given
[1:06:54] it as speaking in tongues and shouting
[1:06:57] and gifts and dancing and brother said
[1:06:59] you could do every bit of that but if
[1:07:01] you're rejecting the message the seed
[1:07:04] life is wrong amen but if that Seed Life
[1:07:07] Is Right Hallelujah let the bad days
[1:07:11] come let the good days come it doesn't
[1:07:13] make any difference listen cloudy skies
[1:07:16] and rainy days are no sign of God's
[1:07:20] disapproval amen I say tonight you need
[1:07:22] to get outside of the realm of our feel
[1:07:25] or I think or I hope and step into the
[1:07:28] realm of seed life I know I come from
[1:07:31] God and there's not enough Devils out of
[1:07:33] hell to ever stop the Church of the
[1:07:35] Living God God has ordained this
[1:07:38] generation and there will be nothing
[1:07:40] that can hinder
[1:07:42] it
[1:07:45] hallelujah hallelujah what is it it's
[1:07:48] dealing with the seed they both live by
[1:07:51] the same water one's anointed to
[1:07:54] denomination the other's anointing to
[1:07:56] the
[1:07:57] word hey what is it unless that was
[1:08:01] God's seed from the beginning you're
[1:08:05] finished let me tell y'all something I
[1:08:08] know you know it but I want to remind
[1:08:09] you this the Rapture is by
[1:08:14] election don't you ever let the devil
[1:08:16] talk you out that the Rapture is not
[1:08:18] your Works folks right right I'm sorry
[1:08:22] it's not the Rapture is not your works
[1:08:25] the Rapture is by election what is the
[1:08:28] difference in the five wise and the five
[1:08:29] foolish virgin he said I laid my
[1:08:31] material out and put a pattern over it
[1:08:35] and that which fell into the pattern was
[1:08:37] the wise virgin and that that wasn't in
[1:08:39] the pattern was the foolish amen I say
[1:08:41] tonight that God has ordained a bride to
[1:08:44] stand in this generation and if that
[1:08:46] bride seed is on the inside of you
[1:08:49] listen the devil better always get out
[1:08:51] of the way because the Church of the
[1:08:53] Living God can divide the difference
[1:08:58] tonight look at the prophet he'll speak
[1:09:00] it here he said your soul is a part of
[1:09:03] God you're an attribute of God but
[1:09:05] you're just displayed on the earth amen
[1:09:09] now I want to take a couple scriptures
[1:09:11] and listen what he says for by one
[1:09:12] offering we're perfected forever them
[1:09:14] that are Sanctified do you know it's
[1:09:17] impossible for a man of God that is a
[1:09:20] seed of God that has been regenerated
[1:09:23] under him impossible for that man to be
[1:09:25] lost do y'all know that you know Hebrews
[1:09:28] 6 says it is
[1:09:29] impossible do you know that it's
[1:09:31] impossible and brother Ashton that's the
[1:09:33] devil's favorite
[1:09:35] scripture it's the favorite scripture he
[1:09:37] has to beat down the children of God
[1:09:40] that if they have failed somewhere or
[1:09:41] they've had trouble somewhere the devil
[1:09:43] always say well you can't never get
[1:09:45] right it's impossible for you to ever to
[1:09:46] get right and it's a complete twisting
[1:09:48] of the scripture what that scripture
[1:09:50] means is a seed of God go on and read it
[1:09:53] it said the rainfalls and some bring
[1:09:56] forth briers unto rejection but others
[1:09:58] bring forth the fruit of the field
[1:10:00] brother said there it is the rainfall
[1:10:02] but there's a just and there's an unjust
[1:10:05] the rain will fall but there's a seed
[1:10:07] and there's a nonseed but there is
[1:10:09] something on the inside listen you
[1:10:12] didn't become seed when you come to the
[1:10:13] altar you didn't come seed when you
[1:10:16] found the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:10:18] reason you come to the altar is there
[1:10:20] was a seed in you the reason you got
[1:10:22] life is there was a seed in you the the
[1:10:25] seed was
[1:10:27] first Hallelujah it was first that's why
[1:10:31] you are who you are tonight that's why
[1:10:33] you keep pressing on in the middle of
[1:10:35] every struggle in the middle of every
[1:10:37] battle because seed is on the
[1:10:40] inside yes sir brother bam said it very
[1:10:43] clearly now now if you're if you're if
[1:10:46] you're if you're a legalist I I
[1:10:48] apologize ahead of time you're going to
[1:10:50] make mistakes you'll fall you'll
[1:10:52] willfully do wrong I'm reading you go
[1:10:55] out sometimes and do things that you
[1:10:57] don't mean to do but that don't mean
[1:10:59] you're
[1:11:00] lost that means you're going to get
[1:11:04] correction I'm
[1:11:06] reading my little boy a lot of times
[1:11:08] will do things you know that it's
[1:11:10] against your rules and you know what
[1:11:12] they expect when they do it and they're
[1:11:15] going to get a weapon for it and
[1:11:16] sometimes it's a good one but it's still
[1:11:18] your
[1:11:20] child and it's impossible for a man to
[1:11:23] ever be gone again that once been born
[1:11:26] of eternal life God is not an Indian
[1:11:29] giver and he that Hearth my words and
[1:11:31] believeth on him has passed from Death
[1:11:33] under life amen and shall not come into
[1:11:35] the in into it now listen here's here's
[1:11:38] here's where I here's where I want to
[1:11:40] really major this point you got to
[1:11:42] narrow the
[1:11:44] battle you can't fight the battle with
[1:11:47] 10
[1:11:49] fronts uh oh I I I wish I was a better
[1:11:53] pronunciator that's good brother but the
[1:11:55] but the but the human mind brother B
[1:11:56] says the Battleground right you got
[1:11:58] Gettysburg and you got uh waterl you got
[1:12:02] great Battlegrounds right but I was
[1:12:03] studying one what's I can't pronounce it
[1:12:05] thermop thermop kind of like a
[1:12:08] thermometer thermop good I'm there now I
[1:12:11] can get that thermop y'all know I'm
[1:12:13] above my pray grade don't
[1:12:15] you
[1:12:16] thermop but it was a guy named Le
[1:12:19] leonitis and he had a bunch of he had a
[1:12:22] bunch of soldiers but his soldiers I
[1:12:23] think I was reading here earlier maybe
[1:12:25] had about 7,000 men Collective to fight
[1:12:29] and he was fighting against a Persian
[1:12:31] army that some estimates put it in
[1:12:34] millions and some estimates put it in
[1:12:36] 300,000 but what difference does it make
[1:12:38] he had
[1:12:40] 7,000 it's unbelievable odds but there
[1:12:44] was a there was an actual place here
[1:12:46] that was called Hot Springs is that
[1:12:48] correct it was called the hot springs
[1:12:49] and what they were doing is Brother s
[1:12:51] they were coming out of the ships to
[1:12:52] invade Greece and they were coming out
[1:12:55] like droves and they were coming up the
[1:12:57] hills now if they could have spread out
[1:13:00] say they had a say they was in Lima Ohio
[1:13:03] you'd have been in trouble cuz they'd
[1:13:05] have been 40 mies wide but they were
[1:13:08] living in mountainous regions and it was
[1:13:10] along the coast so what they did was
[1:13:13] leonius de developed a spot where he
[1:13:16] could bring the battle down to a channel
[1:13:20] where there was just a few men could fit
[1:13:22] through so there might be there might be
[1:13:24] 200 100 million Horsemen behind but he
[1:13:29] could whip them one devil at a
[1:13:32] time listen you got to narrow the battle
[1:13:34] you got to you got to you got to get the
[1:13:36] channel smaller you can't fight the
[1:13:39] devil on 10 fronts bring him down to the
[1:13:42] Inside Man and Whi that devil somebody
[1:13:45] said what do you mean brother bam said
[1:13:47] Richmond whipped him how did he take for
[1:13:49] uh Richmond he said he took it one step
[1:13:51] at a time just as he came to it and how
[1:13:54] you going to whip 200 100,000,000 demons
[1:13:56] in this age just as I come to them but
[1:13:59] if I bring it down to the soul realm I
[1:14:01] can whip them one devil at a time we
[1:14:03] don't have to whip them all the same day
[1:14:06] but let's Channel it down and whip them
[1:14:07] as they come I believe the Church of the
[1:14:10] Living God has a right to take it into
[1:14:12] the soul realm bring it down there where
[1:14:15] it can be
[1:14:19] ruined are you understanding what I'm
[1:14:21] saying yeah because your failure Satan's
[1:14:24] trying to fight you in your
[1:14:27] failures and you're struggling there and
[1:14:30] brother man said in in your emotions
[1:14:31] you're struggling he'll beat you there
[1:14:34] so take the battle into the
[1:14:37] soul where you can say to Satan no
[1:14:40] matter the failures I'm a Son of God no
[1:14:42] matter the struggle I'm a Son of God
[1:14:44] well you can say bring all you got devil
[1:14:47] I'm a Son of God when I feel good I'm a
[1:14:50] son when I feel bad I'm a son when I
[1:14:53] wake up in the morning I'm a son I'm a
[1:14:55] Son of God bring the battle where you
[1:14:58] can win
[1:15:00] it you can't fight all these Devils at
[1:15:02] the same time you're a human
[1:15:05] being too many problems folks there's
[1:15:09] too many ways for the devil to get to
[1:15:10] you
[1:15:13] right oh if you're going to if you're
[1:15:15] going to fight in the flesh listen some
[1:15:17] of you young boys have the devil wh you
[1:15:19] tomorrow he got some little strip tees
[1:15:21] to walk out in the Bikini out in front
[1:15:23] of you look at there where you went
[1:15:25] if that's the realm you're living in
[1:15:27] you're done the first
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:31] look come on come out of that thing and
[1:15:34] step over into a realm where you have
[1:15:37] authority step into that realm where you
[1:15:39] can stand with that
[1:15:42] enemy as long as you live there in that
[1:15:45] carnal brother bam said you're
[1:15:46] controlled by them
[1:15:48] senses
[1:15:51] now I know this is beating the Devil up
[1:15:53] real bad but
[1:15:55] somebody might already call the amulets
[1:15:56] for
[1:16:01] him do y'all know there were two William
[1:16:06] Brams y'all know
[1:16:09] that yeah now how can I take a cuar and
[1:16:13] make a grain of weed out of it
[1:16:15] impossible to do it the only way it can
[1:16:18] be is the inside of that cuar has been
[1:16:21] transmitted from a cuar to a wheat life
[1:16:26] so brother Braham is now not talking
[1:16:27] about seed life not wheat and cuar but
[1:16:31] he's talking about eternal life or wheat
[1:16:34] life in a cuar nature and he says this
[1:16:38] life has been taken out but the nature
[1:16:41] of a cuar is still sticky and until this
[1:16:44] new life is fully developed out of the
[1:16:45] ground and raised up again when it comes
[1:16:47] forth it's no more cuar but a wheat but
[1:16:50] while here on Earth this cuar is sticky
[1:16:54] and it's got the nature of the wheat on
[1:16:56] the inside and as long as you're in this
[1:16:59] life you're going to be
[1:17:03] sticky and you're going to have a carnal
[1:17:06] nature and that's going to bother you as
[1:17:08] long as you
[1:17:14] live but inside of
[1:17:17] you you're born again do do you see what
[1:17:20] brother Ram's doing for
[1:17:22] you canot tell you
[1:17:25] the prayer
[1:17:26] lines were young people that got the
[1:17:29] baptism of the holy ghost in a prayer
[1:17:31] line two years ago come back in the
[1:17:33] prayer line and they say I thought that
[1:17:36] I had received
[1:17:38] something but I did something wrong or I
[1:17:42] said something wrong or I felt something
[1:17:45] wrong and in the immaturity of that life
[1:17:49] Satan is telling you that you didn't get
[1:17:52] nothing that's right when you got
[1:17:57] everything but if you can't divide the
[1:17:59] two he's going to lie to you the rest of
[1:18:02] your life and you'll be a 60 or 70 year
[1:18:05] old person saying I'm not sure if I have
[1:18:07] the Holy
[1:18:09] Ghost because you're not separating the
[1:18:12] spirit and the
[1:18:15] Soul now do you see here what he's
[1:18:17] trying to say to you brother Bram says
[1:18:20] now to to settle this he said there was
[1:18:22] an old indan he said he said it was no
[1:18:25] end and he said Billy Paul went to give
[1:18:26] him some prayer cards and he said you
[1:18:29] know he's passing them out and he said
