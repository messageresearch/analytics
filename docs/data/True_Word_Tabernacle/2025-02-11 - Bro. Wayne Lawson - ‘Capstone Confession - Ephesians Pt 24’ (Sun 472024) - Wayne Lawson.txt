hearts and Lord Jesus we give this service to you and we give all all the glory and the honor to you as we invite you Lord come take your word speak to the need of your children Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles this morning would just like to go into the word of the Lord amen uh I'm going to be in Ephesians chapter 4 I want to uh read here in the 11th to the 15th verse amen Ephesians chapter 4 I want to speak 11 to verse 15 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelist some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man now that perfect man is measured unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children now we have a Greek word for that in Spanish as well and uh but don't be be tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and the cunning craftiness whereby they lay lie in wait to deceive now what he says is don't be children anymore tossed around can I just say it by lies and by the slide of man and by cunning craftiness amen that weight to deceive us but speaking the truth and love I love how he places this don't lie speak the truth in love that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning I want to uh if I can uh just take a just a a couple moments here Amen in this scripture and I want to speak to you today on Capstone confessions Capstone confessions amen uh this last verse here speaking truth and love it just uh I was going to continue on but it I just have some things here that I want to I want to stick with for uh this service if we can amen uh speaking the truth and love I want to talk about Capstone confessions amen uh here Paul is telling the church to not be children now we know what he's speaking of he's not speaking of uh of of Christian and not Christian he's talking about mature Christians and baby Christians he he's very simple in his saying you got to go back into the Greek to find it but when he says perfecting Saints it's what made me think of it he said perfecting Saints is is and I thought oh my how you going to perfect Perfection uh the Saints already been perfect brother Bram makes a big a big point out of the Ephesian book that it was to the Saints which are in Ephesus which those which already are in Christ so how would you perfect perfect people other than realizing that it was a spiritual growth and the prophet then of course tells us about the growth or the equipping of the saints of God equipping them in the in the things which they need for this age so when he speaks about this he speaking about not being uh children but rather being adults in in the word and and we know uh that this not being children not speaking lies amen and anything that is contrary to the word is a lie that's right see it's anything contrary to the word that that is a lion how to recognize a li now the thing that we are dealing with this morning is that we have found and and what has been brought to us is has brought us to a perfect word now I love how the prophet says this amen I want to read something here from Paul 1 Corinthians 13:10 but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away with amen that when the maturity is come amen then that which is in part shall be done away now when I was a child I spake as a child and I understood as a child and I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face for we know I know in part but then shall I know even also am I known nowen Paul is definitely pointing to the idea that there's coming something in the future that's going to reveal and give to knowledge the people of God who they are in God he's saying there's coming a time that you're going to know the way you're known in other words God knows something about you has something in his heart about you has something in his knowledge about you that you don't know but there's coming a time that when you won't look through a glass Darkly amen but you're going to see him now Corinthians tells us we're going to see him an unobscured view of the word of God and when we look into the face of that it's going to change us and it's going to change us from Glory unto glory amen I believe that this morning I don't believe we change the word I believe the word changes us and as we look into the unobscured face of our Lord Jesus Christ and we see the great image and we recognize who we are in him now that is the Perfection amen of course that we're talking about in the message perfect faith brother bandam tells us this that nearly 2,000 years God God has been making himself a masterpiece amen he struck Adam and get a piece off of him and a rib to make a wife and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he's got a piece off of him and it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament and another piece to be fulfilled see the new and the old is husband and wife see the old to foreshadow the new Christ has come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament amen another Masterpiece in the making and it tooken him 4,000 years to make that Masterpiece he said now 2,000 years he's making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece in so doing he he does it in his never changing method the same way he made the masterpiece his word and that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect word do you believe he was a perfect Masterpiece because he was the Fulfillment of the Old Testament then this bride church will be a perfect Masterpiece because she's the Fulfillment of the New Testament just as he stepped out of the Book of Genesis and the book of Isaiah and the Book of Malachi and the Book of Ezekiel so does the bride step out of the New Testament prophecies and what he fulfilled in his time the Church of the Living God will fulfill in her time because she is the perfect manifestation of the Fulfillment of almighty God Jesus tells us in questions and answers Amen brother bam says it like this he said I I go to prepare a place for you amen and I'll come again and receive you unto myself he said there amen there's many mansions in my father's house is that right and brother B said see the father's house I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house he's going to prepare a place it'll be a perfect place where no evil exist where no sickness exist we no old age exist we no death exist it's a perfect place and it's calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and the Bible said so be ye perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride and how are you going to do it through anything else but the perfect word of God Amen there is no way for this bride to do this outside of the perfect word of God listen I I want to make make a a declaration to you and I know many of you know it but I want you to hear it again this morning amen we already have the perfect interpretation to the perfect word of God Amen we are not waiting this morning the Bible said them that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall rise up as Eagles and amen now that's what he says when they that wait on the lord well listen we're not waiting this morning amen we are not waiting because we have already received of the Lord amen I believe we ought to F like eagles this morning I believe we ought to walk and not be weary this morning we have received a perfect word from the perfect God about who we are where we're going what we are doing amen I say the devil is a liar and he's put so many lies out to the age to try to deceive amen and to bring people under captivity amen but there is a bride who is alive this morning and there's a perfect word on the inside of her amen I believe it this morning you won't get there any other way than the perfect word of God and the prophet of God said we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication oh you don't know what that means to have a perfect word and not just the word of a man but a perfect Vindication of the word that was spoken amen this word never came amen amen just by the man William brandom it came from the Creator himself this is not the fleshly mind of a man this is the quickening power of almighty God that has told us of the generations and where we live we're talking about the perfect word now listen I know this morning that that perfect word came to the church and the prophet of God tells us in the loudan age he tells us that the age is not yet over he said and we're going to have a messenger that will reveal the mysteries of God is revealed to Paul he will speak out and those that receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry and y'all know brother Ram told us that when we saw that Ministry he said however you judge it is the reward you get from it he said if you look at this and you see the devil you'll get the devil's reward he said if you look at this and you see it as God you'll get God's reward I believe we can say this morning that we've been rewarded I I believe that I believe we've seen the benefici and effect of this message we have seen God benefit our families he has benefited our lives he has benefited our Ministries amen I believe we've had a benefit of this message in our lives I certainly believe it I I come from a family around this message from Jonesboro all the way back in 1947 so when I talk to you about the message it's not just things that I read or even my personal experiences but a grandfather and grandmother on both sides of my family mine and my wife amen were there in the meetings back in the early years in the 40s and they saw these things and they saw them happening my personal family has saw both sides of this message I had an aunt that was been on one of the sides she was a Pentecostal woman and she had epileps or she didn't have epilepsia she went to the meetings and wanted to get in the prayer line for something and she wasn't able to get in the prayer line and she got angry at brother brandham and she sat there with a hard spirit and brother brandom said I'm going to cast out this Spirit of epilepsy and you're going to close your eyes and humble yourself now I'm going to I'm going to release this thing in the congregation and brother B said when he C Cast that Spirit out you heard him say it many times I'm not responsible for where it goes reverence yourself humble yourself bow your head close your eyes this thing's going to leave here and it's going to want to go somewhere I had an aunt sitting there that refused to her head she wouldn't close her eyes she had a hard Spirit watching what was happening and that epilepsy left that kid and went right into her and she died having epileptic fits years later amen because of the effect she had when she come in the message let me say something to you this morning this message will affect your life this message you cannot ever come into this message and it not affect your life somehow either it's going to bring great reward and great benefit amen or it will bring bring judgment to you at a latter time amen but there was another part of my family that saw the Miracles they saw the power of God my my great uncle Henry darus was a Pentecostal preacher had a great big church had a lot of women preachers he went there and heard brother brandham he'd come back they actually thought he was a a prophet CU he'd see visions and have some dreams and and they really pushing him as a prophet amen he come home he told his church he said look I'm no prophet he said but I've met one down there amen and he's fulfilling Malachi 4 and he's fulfilling behold I send unto you Elijah these men had the Revelation that it was Elijah before brother brandham ever told the congregations in 1960 brother brandham he started telling that Elijah was to return before 1960 he wasn't saying it publicly but we had an uncle who already knew he was Elijah before he ever even told the world because they took the message and it had a beneficient effect and to they I have been affected by the message of the hour because see see it's how you receive the message it's how that it will affect you as's a beneficient effect of this prophet's Ministry amen and what is that great benefit they will hear him and be blessed and become a part of that Bride of the last day of revelation 22 and 17 for the spirit and the bride say come for the spirit and the bride say come this corn of wheat went into the ground and it Nia has come back to original grain again listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in the last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say has already been said in the word oh Hallelujah don't you love him this morning as a benefici and effect of this message the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing can you imagine having something to say different than allmighty God but because there has been a prophet Among Us you can say exactly what God says you can say it the way God said it you can believe it the way God meant it because there's a prophet has been among us we find ourselves in complete agreement with almighty God I tell you brother amen I'm so glad there's been of somebody among us to bring Oneness in the Church of the Living God that we can all speak the same thing and what we speak the prophet has spoke what the prophet spoke the bride amen and the Bible has already said it I don't believe this morning that we are at the doors of dogmas and Creeds we have been called into the land of a perfect word by A Perfect manifestation do you see God is send a Vindicated Prophet sending a prophet after 2,000 years he sending ing someone so far from organization and education and the world of religion as John the Baptist of the Elijah of old we will hear only from God and we will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece and as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 he will turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore truth as they had had it and those elect will have in the last days the on who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be the voice to perform his Works do you see it he will restore truth back to the church listen what Paul is saying he said that we ought to speak truth in love how are you going to speak truth without a prophet how are you going to keep from speaking Baptist are speaking Lutheran or speaking Pentecostal amen what kind of language has the world got today and what kind of way do they explain God but there's a benefici and effect of a prophet's message in the last day there'll be a bride that their voice will speak the truth hallelujah the truth has returned the truth has come to us the truth has made its entrance into our hearts the truth has made its way into our lips speaking truth in love my goodness think about it this morning the prophet of God says this if you would just consider the church history you'll find out that those who followed Luther's message become the voice of Luther's message after that he left amen and it was Generations now the brother BR said this if Luther would have lived long enough amen he would have believed this amen amen but we find out amen that brother R says it like this amen those people that took the Revelation from God became living Epistles read known of all men for the generations when the Methodist failed God raised up another and he's gone through the years until the last day there will be another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age the final voice to the final age isn't that amazing that you are the last people to speak that you are the last people to speak speak in this generation listen let me say something to you the words that you are speaking are the last things that God will say to a dying world Amen the things that you have to say Amen they're more important than the devil would want you to believe he would like to take it and he would say it was more important when this one was speaking in Luther's day it was more important when this one was speaking in Wesley's day oh it was more important back here Amen in the age of Pentecost but never has there ever been a group of people that have lived upon the face of the Earth that what they have to say is god-given and it's so important that your words are becoming the last words that this world will hear from God hallelujah amen the last words to be spoken the voice is the final voice let me say this I know the devil wouldn't like us to stand in the platform even today there are those that have grew up around the message amen and they have done everything they can to shut down the five-fold ministry even from preaching the word but let me say this to you today I believe from my heart that we finally have a five-fold Ministry that has something to say we have something to say that no other age has ever knew and no other age has ever had a hold of do you recognize the Lamb's Book of Life has been opened up the Seven Seals have been peeled back the Thunders have thundered the voice of God has issued into this Earth how you going to shut her up how you going to shut her up when she sees she has the answer for every age we have the answer for the resurrection oh you ever seen somebody sitting in a class and the and the teacher ask a question and and and some people they start talking here and they really don't know the answer but they like to hear themselves talk you know amen but there's somebody sitting there that really knows the answer and finally it just overwhelms them and they just throw their hands up because they have the answer let me tell you this morning no matter your nature Meek or bold no matter whether you're a quiet person or you're a reserved person this answer has been given to you for you to speak up youen it's time for the bride to speak up it's the voice of the Resurrection that is in the Bride of Jesus Christ you can tell us it's unimportant let me tell you you are the most valuable thing that God has on this planet today I know people have tried to set you aside and say you're invaluable because of this reason or this reason but let me tell you this Thou Art precious my beloved amen this Bible tells us that in all of the things that God had he gave everything that he might possess you that he might possess a voice oh if you ever see yourself in the scripture amen you'll hear him say I find no spot in thee wrote an entire Bible about you had prophets sing about you come on David's first song in The Book of Psalms is she's like a tree planted by the water amen you could cut it down amen take it to the stomp but you'll never keep it from coming back again because I shall restore sayith the Lord of host we are serving a god that is on your side let me tell you this morning it don't matter who else is on your side when God has chose you in this generation there's no devil there's no power there's no anointing there's no Family Ties there's no religion there's no church nothing can keep you from restor the way God said you could [Applause] [Music] come yes sir he's calling a bride back through a channel he promised to have let me say something this ain't Luther's day I'll read you what a prophet said if you want to know what day it is look at the calendar right if you want to know what time it is look at your Bible that's right hey man you're living brother B said a calendar look at the calendar to find out way the day of the your year you're living and you look at bible God's Bible to see what age you're living amen and we're not living in a Methodist age they preach sanctification and we had to go there but we didn't stay there and there's a Baptist age and there was an age of believing but we didn't stay there right but brother Ram said but we are living in the bright age oh Hallelujah the calling the bringing back to God through a channel he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it God had a channel to bring truth now here's the beauty God is an unchanging God with unchanging ways that's right and according to Amos the third chapter that the Lord Our God would do nothing until first he shows it to a prophet now let me ask you something if he wouldn't do nothing why would you think he would let the end of the world come and not send a prophet if he won't do nothing why would he let a junction of time amen where immortality and time are coming together and not send a profit if he sent a prophet in other changes and other times how much greater the change we're living today we are not just ending an age we are ending history we are standing on the ends of the world Amen and God has made a junction in time if God would have did it in other ages what about the age we're living in I say he did some prophet and I say I'm here with the message of a prophet amen because we can speak the truth now amen it's a dedicated Channel now a prophet is different than other preachers a prophet is a mute brother bam explains it clearly he said this microphone is a mute right and he said you only hear something because of something spoke into it and brother B said a true Prophet was a dedicated channel to God and he could only speak when God speaks come on now a prophet is not one who becomes a prophet he's one who's born a prophet brother Bram said so he now there's Minor Prophets and that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about a prophet a Vindicated Prophet you judge Minor Prophets a major Vindicated Prophet is the judge so all gifts are judged by this message all prophets are judged by this message all pastors are judged by this message let me just give you a complete permission right now Judge Me by it test me by it don't test me by opinions don't test me by the latest feeling or the latest move in the message test me by the message of the hour and if I fail the test I'll repent on the spot and say I've been wrong let's get back to the word of God I say there's a message this morning get back to the word get back to the word of God let the word of God be the guide of the church let it be the guide of our hearts listen it's a dedicated channel of prophit is a mute it is a trusted channel it's one that you can trust yes sir don't you just love sitting down listening to the messages sometimes I don't know about y'all but I turn the tape on it's like going home home good morning friends and my heart just melts I sat there I put all my filters away I put all my defenses away and I just said under that voice and I say Lord mold me m me to this character this man's talking about I want to sit here and be molded because it's a trusted Channel now brother brandom himself had to come through a change of ministry to speak this truth truth it's amazing when you start studying I pray played uh three uh uh uh Visions back to back for you and those three visions back toback are talking about the change that happened to brother brandom in his ministry and look now to speak the truth he personally had to undergo a change now he said that the ministry wouldn't change but the man with the ministry would change now y'all y'all y'all have been around enough to know some of these prophecies that's been over brother bradam but you know it's uh it's it's beautiful when you go into birth pains and I'll just read from birth pains cuz it was the place but brother Bram first TS talking about this in the Easter seal in 1961 but it's when brother Bram had just finished a sermon and and and a man come up on the platform Danny Henry he was Ken folks to maryn Monro I believe it was and and and he come up on the platform and he hugged brother brandom a baptist boy and he was just going to tell brother bradam that this could be the 23rd chapter of Revelations they didn't he was just so beautiful and when he hugged him he started speaking in unknown tongues well this he did he started speaking in unknown tongues to him but come to find out there was people sitting in the room that said that wasn't an unknown tongue that was French and there was three of them come together two of them wrote it down the interpretation and the third one walked up to the platform and read it and he said he was Victor Leo he was The Interpreter uh for the U of the French and in this in this translation he said because thou has chosen the Narrow Path a harder way thou H has walked of your own choosing and thou has picked the correct and precise decision it is my way well that's powerful isn't it and because of this momentous decision a huge portion awaits thee what a glorious decision you have made this in itself he says is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine now watch speaking truth now here's the prophet with a with a prophecy laying over his life because thou H has chosen the harder way and brother bam I immediately identifies that to Moses and his decision to walk with God that he made a choice if you've ever read it the book of Hebrews said that Moses seen the Unseen amen decided to to take the reproach of Christ and esteem it Greater riches than Israel so he took the worst thing God had to offer and esteemed it greater than the best thing the world had to offer and brother man Likens his choice to Moses's choice to abide in the calling that God had gave him he actually goes on to tell us amen that what it does he said he said now I don't know what the rest of that meant and may it come to pass perhaps one day in the tent we'll get to it says this true Easter seal 1961 now he says here he said see now he said now watch perhaps it'll come setting back under he'll make it known now not because we had it to do not because of that see it's just easy you can be popular you can have everybody patting you on the back money flowing from everywhere for radio or televisions and so forth they said that they would take it and televise it and I don't believe in taking God's things and putting them out there on such vulgarity stuff of the world I don't believe in all this whooping it up and making something that it isn't I believe in just letting it alone the way God see let him do it with it the way he wants to we servants just serve the Lord just as God said do it now what was it brother Brandon made a choice that he wouldn't let him put them out there on television because they wasn't going to let him preach the truth like that he was going to have to start taking things away from the message before they could support it but but the love in his heart meant that he desired to see a bride for Christ greater than he wanted his own Ministry come on Church brother Brandon wasn't just trying to build himself matter of fact in the end of his ministry they came to him and said brother brandom the reason your ministry is fading he said because you don't have the right promoters and brother brandom told the greatest promoters he said it's come my time that I must decrease because it's the time that he's got to increase and I pray this morning amen that we remain in that position of letting it be less us and more him I I I I guess I'm home I preach what I believe ain't I I say what is I I think it's time amen that we quit beating around the bushes and trying to convert denominations and trying to get people to believe this that don't believe this and while we're doing it we're letting the people of God starve to death amen because we're afraid to say the name William brandom we're afraid to preach the truth of the message of the hour well I'll tell you this God called me to preach this message he didn't call me to hold hands with every denomination and every manm thing he called me to preach the message of the hour and the love of God would make us do [Applause] it Hallelujah I know I know what I'm talking about there's a great pressure right now through this hour we're living don't quote brother brandham let me tell you what I'm going to quote brother brandom you cut my head off but I'm going to quote Willam brandom you can you can feel me full of darts you can tire and feather me and put me in a prison and I'll be moving my pinky in prison just so you know that means I believe God's Prophet is a man named William brandom you can't shut me up you can't close me up but one day God's going to take me up he's going to take his bride in a rapture of Glory I tell you how to know it's a devil you can quote you can quote woodro Wilson what's that cigarette smoking Englishman amen we'll fight them on the beaches and we'll fight them in the streets huh Churchill you can quote Church Hill all day long oh Church Hill you can quote him but when you quote William brandom somebody's going to draw up on that listen let me tell you that's the way you know it's a devil all of hell is scared of this message they are scared for the people to get a true understanding of the Revelation this word because the truth of this matter is it was a dedicated voice to anoint you as the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why denomination's fighting it friends that's why they're fighting it so hard because a prophet didn't name the Baptist as the Messiah he didn't name the Lutheran as the place of worship he didn't name the Pentecostal he named you the called out church and said I won't call you church I'll call you [Applause] bride oh they hate his voice but I say we love his voice see it forces a man to a decision and the prophet had to come to his decision and that decision was a momentous decision it was the harder way but it was God's way right amen and the of God said it brought a victory in love divine he said just change it he said it's the verb before the adverb it brought a victory in Divine love Paradox in 1961 brother Brown revisits it and brings it together with another another vision and in this Vision he said I was walking on a map of Palestine and he said I looked over and I had come 2/3 of the journey and he said I was looking over the Jordan and there was a third part laying over over there and the voice said to me that's where all the promises are come on now first two pulls didn't bring all the promises but that's where the Pentecostals wanted to stay but in that third part there was going to be an opening of the mind of God to say whose names were for the inheritance of the heavens and earth that that the Church of the Living God your name was on the wheel denominations did not want the reading of the will of God they wanted to make their own claims on it and say it belongs to them when it belonged to you the whole time but God's dedicated messenger would not be detered and when he come to the Jordan he heard the voice say over there's where all the promises are he said oh now I see what coming to the Jordan meant he was coming to death he was coming to the end of that popular Ministry if you go into the scriptures 2 Timothy chapter uh 4 you'll find brother bam discuss it and he talks about the first part of his ministry he said do the work of evangelist but there'll come a time they won't endure sound Doctrine and he said that's all I read for years he said but later I found later in the book of Timothy where that Paul said for them that Deus has forsaken me and bring my coat and come to me brother man said there he is a prophet down to one coat he said there Deus had forsaken him he said Demus hadn't went back in the world and gambled and things he said he just gave up on Paul that his ministry had come to its end isn't it amazing Paul had a Demus and William brandham had a Demus sharan and when brother BR started teaching the word all of a sudden they believe brother Ram's Ministry had come to an end because it wasn't in the Pentecostal fashion anymore so what did we find out so brother randam comes to the platform and he said the flash of another Revival is blinding you from seeing the Revival that is on today come on the glare of the Pentecostal r Revival was blinding them to the greatest Revival that has ever hit the face of the Earth God was going to reveal the seven unknown Thunders and they would not look at it hey it was divine love it was in the message now watch this because brother bam was told this in the early 60s now in 1963 brother brandom comes along then and he comes to this great decision and standing in the gap youve all read the message if you had go go home listen today or the next day you'll enjoy it but standing in the Gap brother Bram comes along and he says I'm wore out with a with a fussing amen now this is in 1963 this is an ' 06 he just preached the seals now and he said when these tapes go out thousands of my friends are going to leave me and he was wore out because can you imagine this guys standing and talking the seven angels and getting the Revelation divinely revealed to you from God and then you preach it to the church is supposed to be God's church and they call you a false prophet a heretic a crazy man and there he stood knowing where it came from amen but they started setting him aside and brother BR said and I picked myself up a complex y'all y'all remember it right he said I picked myself up a complex he said and as Moses here it's back to Moses and as Moses had done the same thing remember when Moses got that complex against God's people brother Ram said I got the complex against God's people and had made up in my mind that I was going to sneak away in the wilderness and I was going to be a prophet God called me to be a prophet I would be a prophet then I would go up in the wilderness I was he was going to trick his wife you'd have to trick a woman into that cuz it was about 1100 miles up Amen in the wilderness and he's going to trick her and take her up there with Bud Southwick and then when they got there brother Bram said I was going to tell her honey I like it so well here why don't we just live off the grid for the rest of our lives amen and brother Ram said that was what was in his mind he said but I had this dream and in this dream he said I was wandering around in this dump yard and he said there was there was trash and he said it was an old dumps field and he said people were living in boxes and things and they had fires and it was cold and he said I was wanding around and cold and dark and he said there I was he said I was rugged and ragged and looking for a place and he said I was walking and I started thinking one time I used to leave God's church and now here I am in this condition and brother B said I just kept walking he said then all of a sudden I looked over and there was Fletcher my brother-in-law setting at a fire and said come here Bill you've been so good to us and you fed my kids when I was gone and and there there he was in a position now that a drunk was had to take care of him he used to be a prophet now a drunk was going to care for him now watch this and brother man said I sat down there with him and the dream faded away and he said I went and checked on Fletch and things he said and he was doing okay he said so I thought well I don't know what it means he said and just a little while later Billy and I was up in Montana and he said I got up early one morning went down to the cafe and he said we were going to get something to eat he said I walked in the cafe and he said I seen this rugged Rancher come in now if I'm I'm making it a short one so you can you you're getting the whole tapate in 10 minutes here he said this old Rancher come in he said I looked him over and he said now there's a man right there he was a little bit rugged his hair wasn't cut up real good and he had a beard and brother Ram said he was he was a rough looking fell he said when he sneezed he sneezed you know he just let her out you know he said wasn't one of them little sneezes he just sneezed said oh man after my own heart and he said that's the kind of guy I'm going to be now I know some of you sitting in here this morning let let me let's learn one little thought from this some of you sitting here this morning maybe you're a young man and you're looking out here in this world and you're seeing what you think you want to be but listen let when you get that settled well I'll be like this guy and I'll be like this guy and I'll be like this guy listen to me without God you ain't going to be nothing without God Amen listen the dirtiest Rascal out there is a boy running from God the filthiest woman in the bar is a girl running from God Amen these just just nice common people listen maybe they settled where they are but you take a daughter or a son of God and let them run from this word and they'll go deeper and fall further amen listen don't you ever judge somebody by how far they have fell because they're running from God but the same God that called them amen won't give up on them until he brings them back into the presence of God without God we are nothing without God you're nobody hey you watch you watch how that Prophet went to that and he said I was going to be like that guy and he said all of a sudden he said there was a two men stood up and older and he said they were dressed bad and didn't have much clothes on or you know as far as dressing wise he said they were rugged and didn't have any money he said he said he said maybe they had a breakfast that was 20 cents between the two of them so they didn't had no money amen and and he said all of a sudden Billy said Daddy that looks like you in flet amen and all of a sudden he found what he thought he would be and then he saw what he was going to be and you know what God was doing he was showing him if you make your choice your way that's what you would be but if you make my choice and you do it my way you'll be standing there as a leader of the Bride of Jesus Christ listen God's Got Away church he brother M said there it was Fletch and I there it was right there in that dream he said then watch what happened happens he said we get in the car and go to driveing he said Billy went to sleep and a voice started speaking to me and he said you've wondered and you wondered now this is Elijah how many knows what his first Bible was it was the Wilderness it was the nature do you know God knew that by his nature that Elijah was a nature John the Baptist that's all he read was books of of the trees and serpents and the rocks and it meant more to him than the scripts and the prophet said as I was driving the angel said to me your name is written in this mountain I got the pictures here I won't show them this morning for time he said but your name is written here in this mountain and brother R said I looked over now he's showing him his name in his own Bible that mountain meant more to brother brandham than just the written letters on the page amen he saw his name brother BR said there he said how many letters is in your name and he said there's that now if y'all watch it William Mary and brandom there seven letters in all of them and he said he said well there's seven letters brand and he said he spelled it b r a n h a and said there was seven snow Peaks and he said my name fit right across them mountains now listen folks I don't know if if you're if you're if you're where I'm at on this but I'll say this to you that the West Coast was not civilized until the 19th century right we're in Montana we're on the western coast and it says as the light shines from the East unto the West so shall the coming of the Lord be now notice because in the west coast here is is a seven-letter name of a man that there's not been a major Ministry in the Earth with seven letters ending in hm since Abraham from The Book of Genesis the 17th chapter and Abraham only had five letters in Genesis the 12th chapter but God added two letters to Abraham's name so that it would be a seven-letter messenger who was first who was first I ask you this was those mountains there before Abraham got his name or after before seven letters was ever in Abraham's name that was a seven-letter mountain and in God's mind that was a gentile bride that would receive a Malachai for a prophet and his name would be seven letters not six like Graham seven like brandom and God would have a prophet on the scene now if you're a reader of the Bible in Genesis 17th chapter in Genesis 18 you you find the 17th chapter Lord God Almighty appeared unto Abraham and he draw from the breast and got the Holy Ghost but it was only one verse or so later that he was called Abraham and he became the father of Nations he went from the baptism of the spirit unto being positionally placed by the same anointing Hallelujah church this message didn't come amen just to make us another church it came for adoption it came for placing it came to teach you who you are what you're doing here what your promises are and where you are going it was written in the Bible and it was also written in that mountain and the prophet said it was given unto him for an everlasting sign and you my zo he was powerful is three of those Peaks was taller than the others and there was three parts of his ministry and the first pull in healing then the second pull in Prophecy but in that third pole it was the last and final Peak after that third po you went to the Continental Divide and it went straight out to the Pacific Ocean amen isn't it beautiful that there is a continental divide that has come into this age between Mortal and immortality and it's under the third pull that there is an entrance made into the kingdom of God by the word of God listen you are entering an Immortal Realm by the power of the message that has been spoken unto you you have heard from another world this ain't just an education it's not just another schooling it is the voice of almighty God sounding From Another [Applause] Dimension Hey Brother Bram said now I understood what it meant a great victory in love divine he said it meant that I would stand in the gap for the people I would return to the field though I am uh uh resented he was going to go preach the message to people that was resenting him and hating him he said oh he said something in me see the complex had said if they don't want to hear you I won't preach it anymore but he said the love of God dashed out there and stood in the gap between the people and God just like Moses stood in the Gap we've had a prophet stand in the Gap are you hearing me the breach has been made somebody stood in the breach between the churches and the seals somebody made a breach for you and I in this evening time message praise the Lord see here's a prophet standing in the Gap hey man look and this is this is explaining now amen that why that his momentous decision and his great victory in love divine he had to love the people enough to preach the message even in a time of rejection look at Jesus in the first crucifixion there from the cross love was projected but that love he projected from the cross must make it way through the statue of the perfect man and it must come into maturity not just in the bridegroom but it's got to come to the bride it's got to be known as the token it's got to be known as the literal life somebody has got to be capped amen by those Thunders somebody's got to be capped and divine love has got to settle down and the voice of God is going to speak out of that church now listen friends here's a prophet saying this now he's saying this all the way back there in the 60s and he's talking about this he's talking about this this happening now I think it's beautiful because before brother Ram goes to this great trial of trying to decide about his ministry amen you know what he's also done is he has now come to the place that he's understanding the change that is happening to him he's going to be pushed out how many knows that do you know why he's going to be pushed out for the word now think of this friends the seed is coming out of the shuck not because the seed has a bad attitude and it's going to just have a fight and it's going no no no no because of the word listen this message will separate you from some of your friendships but let the message do it let it be the message that separates amen do you see that the message itself was separating and watch here here's a prophet now he's saying because of this tremendous victory in love divine now it's amazing to me that he's going through this but in 1960 in the message rejected King going to tie another Vision in 1960 rejected King now this is 60 standing in the Gap 63 1961 he's already told us amen about these other visions and 62 but in 1960 he has a translation or a vision where he goes beyond the curtain of time now remember amen he's laying on the bed and he's depressed and he's in a state of depression because he's thinking he's not doing enough for God he's about 56 years old he's settling into that I'm not doing anything for the Lord and amen I need to get out and do something and I'm going to make something happen he said all of the sudden The Voice spoke to him and said would you like to see beyond the curtain remember brother R didn't I'm just paraphrasing now you go back and read the it's on the fifth seal it's real well so you can read the whole account I'm just pulling something from the account but here's a prophet Lane here and he said all of a sudden he said I was in another place now here's the beauty friends I I don't want you ever to miss this he was only one breath from that Dimension and he literally could see his own body laying on the bed so you you you see and he turned and looked from looking at his body with his wife and turned and looked and saw Millions coming with white robes he was literally Amen in view of the body and in view of the other dimension at the same time he wasn't 20t from his body amen that I've had people mad at me over this but I really don't care but let me just say this I believe that there's theophanies in this room and I believe they're not any further than 20 ft from our bodies amen sometimes you feel a charge of the anointing coming in the building and you say what is that I believe sometimes the positive and the negative come together at the same time I say come on up a little higher come to the perfect word amen my theophany is calling me into that perfect realization of almighty God what was it brother R had broke over into that other dimension now now later he tells us amen that he he saw people in there and he said one of them was 90 and had come into conversion and he said he looked over there and he said well these are not all brandom they're all your converts and remember later brother brother Richard he said there was a girl I used to date had died and I went back to Jeffersonville and he said they let me in the back room to see her and he said when I walked back there and saw her he said I thought Oh Glory to God he said because the other day I saw her over there on the other side in white robes amen here's a prophet could stand in the face of death and not be shooken by the death of a mother and by the death of a wife because he already knew what was on the other side let me say something to you amen there was a lot of pressure for him to not tell that Vision there was a lot of pressure from a lot of people don't you speak that Vision out like that but love for the people gave us a truth that only a prophet could give us listen what he done he went to the other side like Joshua went to the other side and he came back with grapes our Prophet came back with testimonies and literally saw people over there and he said I saw you when I was over there can you imagine church amen that grapes that was coming back from the other side so I could stand here this morning amen and look at you as a church and if I could only tell you the truth there is the orphanage just beyond the curtain of time listen love will speak truth let me tell you what real truth is there is a theophany and if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there is one already waiting let me tell you further truth if you're alive at the time of the changing of the body your theophany will meet this flesh body and it'll be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I'm talking about a god this morning that told us truth that we had never understood stood or we had never knew because God was bringing truth to this five-fold ministry we're not just preaching ideas of man or the thoughts of some preacher somewhere this is the word listen brother Bram met his daughter remember remember hope he met his daughter over on the other side y'all remember the first time brother Bram got out that depression he met her over there he said the last time I saw her she was a six-month old baby and there she walked up to me and the the prime of Glory about 18-year-old girl and she said Daddy he said Daddy how could I be your daddy you're an 18-year-old girl she said I was your little Sharon Rose when we were back on the earth he said what's the matter Sharon she said don't you remember your Doctrine on immortality she was 6 months old folks she never heard her daddy's teaching on immortality but up in heaven they know the teaching of William brandom on immortality because it's a doct ing that has come from Heaven I got a I got a I got a little something in my heart for you this morning Amen Brother Richard just beyond the veil as a little girl waiting for her daddy amen the immortality is really real yes sir amen come on y'all know me you know I'm sitting here this morning I got all I got a Heart full of something right now there something just posting God slipped a little something in my heart amen you tell them the truth you tell them the truth about the resurrection you tell them the truth about death come on Church death is not the end of a Believer death is only the beginning brother Chuck I sat in my office and I heard your name this morning you tell him just a breath away just a breath away the truth is there's a Charlie and a Rachel and the just is Immortal and they can never die and they can never come under condemnation Hallelujah said preacher what do you mean sister sister stump amen I I got your name written if you want to believe it amen the name's written right there you remind her of what the real truth is about her baby you remind her that we've got a message we're not just a bunch of crazy people we've got evidence from another land brother Gabe it's real brother Daryl I got your name written up there if you want to come and see it amen tell him she's okay on the other side you said brother Wayne are you going too far no sir I've already got the truth on it this ain't my thought this is God's thought concerning the death of his [Applause] Saints I know the Darkness it comes at death I've sat in those dark times and those funerals and I've seen it and looked at it and if we didn't have this message we'd lose our minds but God has given us a message to stabilize Us in the most unstabilized moments yes sir we have a truth there's been a change and there's been a climax into this prophet's Ministry can I can I can I tell tell you that brother randam was about to forget about the church and his needs and just go hunting and Moses was just going to hurt some sheep yeah but an angel of God came down in the pillar of fire and said to Moses I have come down to deliver my children and you may have forgot about them but I have not forgot about them I made a promise to them and if you listen listen if you would have been Moses you would have looked at the situation and said God there is no way to get them out now 400 years under bondage 400 years under slavery and you pick me with a stutter how are they going to believe me how they going to get out of here how's this going to happen but you see God had come down but he was just going to send Moses and brother BR said he finally had Moses weak enough to use him now Moses used his weakness for an excuse so the prophet of God said honestly you're not too weak you're too strong right amen so if you surrendering to the thing that God called you to you would find that God's behind it already GL and look what Moses did he left there and went down and delivered the children of Israel and he brought them out with a mighty hand because he had the word of power he had a word that was powerful enough to break the hands of Pharaoh's grip upon the children of God Amen I'm told according to the scripture that there is to be an abrahamic seed right rise up in the last days and I'm told that the Bible said that they would have Liberty and they would have freedom and they would come out of to God for a marriage and a Rapture and God is going to send a messenger to break the grip of denomination off of their lives amen I I can read it for you in 1 Thessalonians 4 he said the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout what is it it's a message of God it was a message coming see a message with enough power to break the stronghold that enemy had on lives you know I I was just I was just thinking over this this morning just sitting here thinking over this uh this situation and I thought of I thought of the prophet and I thought of how how he would place things he preaches standing in the Gap in June and preaches why Christ speak in July same year what a transition standing in the Gap why CHR I speak and he and he shows Moses's Ministry and how Moses had come to the place to whine like a baby listen to this he was whining like a baby why was Moses doing that whining why was Moses crying because he was looking at the situation and not the god that sent him and if Satan can ever get your eyes on the situation rather than the promises and the vision that God is made then he will defeat you every time but I want I want to take this in this why cry I want to show you something brother random says he says you see I had that Vision the other day of that boy over there in Vinland now there's some people don't think that happens and and I just told him here a while back I said well I didn't even know you were there you want to tell me what happened in Finland and you wasn't there and here's a Vindicated Prophet that was there and he told that there would be a boy raised from the dead that was hit in the car told how he would be laying told what he would look like told the told the very uh clothes he would be wearing the kind of car that would do it he told that there would be lapping rocks and cedar trees and brother BR said he explained it wrote it on the fly leaf of his Bible even told it and it it was it was well enough known that people were coming and getting brother brandham in Florida out of meetings and showing him dead boys to see if it was the one he was talking about it was that well known but when brother Ram went over there in Europe he never thought that that would be the place or the time but he but he was driving down the road and look how it come on him all of a sudden he gets out and there's a great wreck and there's two boys laying there and one of them's dead and one of them's about dead and they're standing there and brother BR said they come and got me and said brother Bram come and look and he said the minute I saw it my heart left me I couldn't stand to look at it he said it ain't been that long ago with my babies and he said I just couldn't stand to look at it I turned to go go back to the car he said a hand put it hand a hand put me on the shoulder and he said look around and he said I started looking around he said oh my goodness there was them evergreen trees he said there's the lapping rocks oh there's the boy with the knickers there's the car there's the scene everything is exactly as it was in the vision look what he says here in why cry he said it's a situation under control it is a situation he said but now it's under control the moment he recognized this has been pre-old me he knew now all he had to do was speak not to cry about the situation he didn't have to worry about the situation he knew what was coming next speak you see maturity he didn't fall apart in the trial he didn't fall apart looking at the situation he he knew the outcome of the situation come on folks amen real anointing is supreme power under control it's when you know what to do with the word of God when Satan boxes you in and he's made it dark on every corner you don't have to lay down and whimper and say I don't know if I'm going to make it I don't know if I can get out of this listen to me you have been seen in a vision you have been seen on the other side I don't care what the devil does or how it comes or what he throws at us just speak the word and keep moving it's under control but said it he said immediately right after that story he says it like this he said I was out there hunting with brother bisc and he said I come up on there by the way sister Joanne done me a solid in this trip to Switzerland she showed me a picture when brother brandom and brother Ed was on that trip and and in the picture it's got brother Ed wearing that Green checkered shirt it's the neatest thing she won't give me a copy y'all pray for her but he said they were walking up there and he said a caribou with 42 Ines he said we went over and killed that one and he said we were carrying that one down the hill and he said before we got to the bottom I had said I'd kill a 7ot Grizzly and he said Bud was looking over at me and he was saying brother brandom didn't you say we'd get a grizzly before we got to the end didn't you say we'd get the bear before we got to the end finally he said bud are you doubting me he said no brother brandom I just can't see the bear yeah I just can't see it from here and brother Bram said but the situation was already under control he said I already knew how it would come he said we didn't have to get worried he said just speak the word he steal Jehovah Gyra see it was under control when it looked like it was going crazy but a prophet knew what was fixing to happen oh Church of the Living God we've got the truth on the situations we're living in I say situations under control I know your Bible readers and we don't have time to read it let me run it through you in Revelations the n9th chapter and read it right out of the Bible it said there was an angel coming out of the bottomless pit and was given the key to unloose the Bottom's pit and then smoke that was coming from the bottomless pit was going to fill the Earth and it was going to affect everything like a house fire it does smoke affects everything this Smoke From Hell was going to affect everything and the and the and the Gates of Hell basically was going to be Unleashed upon the Earth and according to Revelations 9 and 11 there would be a king who would be over them and he would be the angel the botus pit it' be Satan himself Lucifer would be leading an army of demons in the last days upon the Earth having a key to come out and be leashed upon the people between the six and seven Trump and the six seven seal you can go read the prophet said it he he said that under that fifth seal he said what happened was you fre he dried up and he said demons that had been bound there from the old days he said was released and we've seen 200,000,000 Horsemen released upon Israel he said and Hitler and musolini and Stalin and they shot him with bullets and they killed him and they burned them what was it it was Devils it was demons out of Revelations 9 and it looked horrible and it looked like it would never end and it looked like there was no hopes but see there was already a scripture laying in the Bible that told us that in the third day I will revive you again and I will gather you back under my wings and God already prophesied of the return of Israel and before they kicked them out of Russia and Germany and Hitler and Europe before they kicked them out they had a place to go come on God Did It for a purpose it was already under control that's right said preacher what are you talking about if if you get it now if you go to Revelations 9 just read it it turns dark it's dark enough in Isaiah the Bible said Darkness will cover this Earth and gross Darkness will cover this people and it'll be a dark it'll be so dark that their understanding will be darkened and they will kill the very ones who serve God believing they're doing God of service scripture tells us it'll be the darkest of all hours that has ever been but if you read from Revelations 9 just don't quit reading and read right into Revelations 10 and see if it doesn't say and another Mighty Angel amen we talk about an Angel that's leading hell but what about an angel leading Heaven there's another angel coming down out of Heaven amen just like it came unto Moses the angel of the Lord came down in this generation listen to me in the darkest of all hours that's when Jesus stepped in in the middle of the storm that's when Jesus stepped in I tell you the situation is already under control another Mighty Angel descended Out of Heaven you know what he had he had a book in his hand let me let me give you good news it was open I'm sorry for these folks running around and believing that book's still closed because every situation is the end every situation there's no hope every dark time they just got to together they waving amen wavering like children from one place to another they can't settle in their Spirit where they're going and what God's going to do with them but listen to me when that book opened up unto them the Bible said seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was about to write it but a voice said seal it up John it's not quite time yet but in the days of the the voice of the seventh angel Ved in the days of William brandom God was going to unseal that book and there would come the voice of seven Thunders now listen I don't have time to preach seven Thunders let's just get it out here amen seven Thunders is a symbol for the voice of God come on and the voice of God will wake the Dead the voice of God will give you Grace it will give you faith for Rapture the voice of God will awaken the bride the voice of God y'all know what I'm doing I'm preaching you the message of this hour and we can see we can see that William brandham was the messenger of the seventh angel and we can see that he was a messenger of that open book that was in Revelations 5 was closed but in Revelations 10 is opened that's right listen I think it's powerful to know this the book that was closed in Revelations 5 couldn't be looked at by anybody or touched by anybody but in Revelations 10 the scene changes and John who is a type of the Bride amen is not only able to take the book he is commanded to take the book and to eat the book so preacher what does that mean it means eat this message it means consume the word of your day it means consume these tapes and these books and feed on them they are spiritual food in due season to give you the the it gives you the vitamins you need for the change of body it gives you the vitamins you need to withstand spirits and evil things when you feed on this book but listen it don't just say to feed on the book it says to prophesy again not just to preach just to eat the message but speak the word over your situation listen this Situation's under control we have the truth of the matter am it'll get so dark like it's never been dark before amen and the Bible said the night cometh oh but the joy it cometh in the morning and I say we are looking this morning at the rising of the Sun the greatest news that any church has ever had situation is under control they couldn't keep him in the grave and they couldn't keep us in the grave they can't keep us in that old dead formal religion they couldn't keep us in that denomination system they couldn't keep us in sin because Jesus has come and he has called for you situation Lord speaking truth can you can you get real truth brother this Prophet told us brother Eric Satan's a bluff truth he's a liar you want real truth that voice that talks to you in the night that says you'll never make it is a lie that's right amen you want real truth that voice that's got you up and down in your Christian walk is a lie and it come from the pits of hell and you're called to a higher calling you're called to a higher voice let me give you real truth all things work together that's right for the good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose I say let all hell come but this bride will keep Rising because the situation is already under control come on let me ask you amen what can the devil do for you if God be for us who can be against us I'm preaching truth to you there is no weapon formed against you that's going to prosper God is already the one amen he said you're going to come out of this as pure gold situation see it's already under control the truth the truth about the matter the real truth sir in the dark of the night brother Stephen you're just a bluff you ain't got no power over the devil don't good to good preach it don't no good to stand up there and quote those scriptures and give don't do no good to come to the church oh truth go ahead but the truth is the devil is the bluff I I don't want to get political but I never mind I won't say I'll Just Let It Go sir do you see after brother bradam sees this Vision you got power to buy the serent power the loose the serpent remember that yes sir the next morning Satan shows up in physical form and stands in his corner and he says you're just a bluff you ain't got no power you ain't got no power to bind me or loose me you ain't got there's nothing you don't have nothing you are nothing who are you anyhow but a drunk man's kid from down in Kentucky who are you anyhow do you see how the devil does see you're just a bluff see you're just bluffing around and he even uses the scriptures on you and he tries to undermine all your faith and all you've ever done and all you've ever been for God but if he'll do that to the devil Eli what do you think he going to do to you if if the devil will say that to William brandom what's he going to say to you if the devil can stand in the corner of William brandom with all those V and all those vindications and all of those Miracles and all those things if he can stand in the corner of his room and say such a thing he's a boldfaced liar and can lie in the face of that much evidence what's he going to do in your house in your room in your heart in your life but the truth of it is that we are genan seeds from the beginning and we are the thoughts of almighty God and the thoughts are real and eternal and we are not blued we are the sons of God who was in the Bible to begin with with and whatever Satan has to throw at us the situation is already under control the blood of the Lamb has been slain for us brother Noah amen there is nothing that was is or coming that can stop the move of God that has been placed upon Our Lives the truth speak the truth hey man won't you stand with me I'm getting long speak the truth I just got to quit preaching around here speak the truth about what God made you about what God did for you I know there's a devil com out of hell but there's been another Angel too and he come with a book and it was open and book's been given to the bride the Revelation has been handed to her as a weapon to speak in the darkest moments speak truth when I was a child I spake like one and I was I was I was pushed around by every Doctrine and every wind never slide a man but the greenness is out of me now I've been laying under that sun for years and it baked out that greenness yes Lord Jes and it brought me to something this message is absolute truth it's not a truth it's not kind of the truth it is the truth God God's give it to us Brother David to speak it speak it over your situations speak it over your some of you probably facing things right now and your life's dark and you don't know how you're going to get over it

devil's going to write he's going to do it anyhow he's going to chase you down and try to destroy you anyhow I say stand your ground and fight if Jesus withheld his power and only used his word that was the reason he did that and the prophet taught us he had all power he said but he use that word you know why he did that so that he could give power to the weakest of Christians the weakest Christian here could take the word of God and speak it and that you would be given the same Authority that Jesus was given at that mountain the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any place at any time in any form yes sir amen speaking truth amen I believe we got to write to speak it this morning don't you speaking truth over our situations yes Lord speaking truth brother Ben help me this
