[0:00] Sure. Love you. Was wondering if you
[0:01] remembered the first message that you
[0:03] read that they the book that they gave
[0:05] you. What it was, Nathan. Uh
[0:08] uh I
[0:11] I No, I don't. In fact, Brother Lynhart
[0:14] when he came and stayed on 30 a day. No,
[0:17] I don't remember that book that my
[0:19] brother gave me. I don't remember the
[0:20] name and I don't even know how much I
[0:22] even looked into it. But the thing of it
[0:24] is when brother Lindard came he played a
[0:26] tape as we sat in our living room
[0:29] listening on the farm there and I can't
[0:31] remember that either uh that particular
[0:34] tape but uh yeah but uh and brother
[0:39] Leonard shared a lot of scripture with
[0:41] us but I do not Yeah, you go you were
[0:43] going to ask me questions. Go and ask me
[0:44] and see if I can I don't know what I can
[0:46] all come up with. Do you have a uh do
[0:49] you have a favorite message or one that
[0:51] was really influential in your life
[0:53] early on?
[0:55] Well, you know, uh when you speak about
[0:57] that, uh I can't say of any favorite
[1:00] that I remember, but I remember uh
[1:03] brother Green, you know, there was
[1:04] several of us believers that lived in
[1:06] the what they call Desert Shores Trailer
[1:08] Court in Tucson, Arizona. and uh he
[1:12] came and played uh one of the messages
[1:15] at they had a uh it it was quite a big
[1:18] trailer court so they had a uh commune
[1:21] commune building there where you could
[1:22] go in and so he came there and he played
[1:25] a message and that's what brother Benham
[1:27] spoke about beyond the curtain of time
[1:29] and it it it it's you know I I never
[1:32] heard the likes of it because you know
[1:34] the thing of it is uh young people uh I
[1:38] had a favorite dog when I was young. My
[1:40] dad bought me a little puppy and it one
[1:42] black eye and one white eye and it was a
[1:45] mixed breed. But the thing of it is it
[1:47] was a cattle dog without training. It
[1:50] was a hunting dog without training. I
[1:52] could go feeasant hunting in Minnesota.
[1:53] Come to the end of the field and you
[1:55] know you got the labadors, you've got
[1:57] the golden retrievers. They're they'll
[1:59] point and everything. Well, this dog,
[2:01] he's only about this big. He come the
[2:03] end of the field, he'd spot them because
[2:05] he'd just point like a hunting dog. So,
[2:07] I had a favorite I had a favorite uh and
[2:10] I had a little Shetland pony. It
[2:11] actually my brother had it, but he got
[2:13] too big for it. His name was Pal. Wow.
[2:16] I'm surprised I remember that name. That
[2:18] just came to me. Wow. Wow. That's quite
[2:21] a long time.
[2:23] Pal. Anyway, uh you know, he he he he
[2:28] was a real buddy to me. I mean, you
[2:29] almost killed me one time,
[2:35] baby. I could tell you a little bit
[2:37] about that, too. Yeah, we want to hear
[2:38] that. Huh? You want to hear that? You
[2:39] want to hear that one? Yeah. Well, it
[2:40] was the time to fill the silo and uh he
[2:43] was a little rasco, that guy, and uh and
[2:47] they were out there uh running the
[2:49] machine, cutting the corn, and you know,
[2:51] and we had to be by the sil shoot up in
[2:52] the silo. So, I'm riding this pony out
[2:55] through the field and coming through the
[2:57] gate, the crazy thing wanted to break
[2:58] loose and I couldn't hold them. And uh
[3:01] my dad had what they called straw shed
[3:04] uh for the hogs or cattle and he cut the
[3:06] post off about like this and the reason
[3:09] that's the reason he almost killed me.
[3:10] Uh so they were still sick enough land.
[3:13] So this pony just beating it through
[3:16] that yard and I'm just trying and I
[3:18] probably probably riding bear back
[3:21] because we didn't always saddle you know
[3:24] where did I fall off at right on my
[3:26] chest on one of them post
[3:29] I thought well I don't even know if I
[3:33] thought I could not get my breath I
[3:37] could not and you know all kidding aside
[3:40] I probably could have killed myself but
[3:42] the Lord there again. And and and my my
[3:45] cousin was there, I guess it was. He
[3:47] picked me up, man. And I guess and got
[3:49] me into the house. I said, "Oh my
[3:51] goodness." Yeah. That's how he almost
[3:53] killed me. So the the reason that tape
[3:56] uh and you know was so real, I'm
[3:59] thinking, "Is heaven really that real?
[4:01] I've never heard something like that in
[4:03] the Lutheran church. Is it really that
[4:05] real?" Yeah. That brother Brandon's dog
[4:07] is there and and horse is there.
[4:11] Now one brother told me I said you
[4:13] know which uh he was quite studious in
[4:17] the message he said well it might not be
[4:20] it might have been in the sixth
[4:21] dimension maybe not in the seven so I
[4:22] don't know I really don't care
[4:29] well you're on the farm uh you want to
[4:32] explain what a corn crib is and why it's
[4:34] cold yeah a corn crib is is not like
[4:38] crane grain bins today you know where
[4:41] they're solid. Corn crib is where they
[4:43] got slats. So they used to pick their
[4:45] corn where they had some moisture in it
[4:47] on ear, not shell like it is they do it
[4:50] today. It was on ear. So you would you
[4:53] would build well all depends on the size
[4:55] of your farm. Now it would be 40 foot
[4:57] long, 60 foot long, could be 100 foot
[4:59] long, but it always had about that space
[5:02] between the boards. So in the fall when
[5:05] you you you got them fall winds, they
[5:07] they go right through there and dry that
[5:09] corn. And and so in the winter time is
[5:12] usually when they would bring when they
[5:14] would bring the uh the uh what do you
[5:18] call that to uh not grind it but to
[5:20] shell it. Yeah. They people would make a
[5:23] living by that. They'd have a unit on a
[5:25] truck or something like that and they
[5:27] would bring that. So that's and then you
[5:29] you you'd shell it in the middle of the
[5:31] winter. So I always have the phrase, you
[5:34] know, when it gets real cold, it's like
[5:35] a corn crib. Yeah. Cuz my when you're in
[5:38] there in the winter time, you know, them
[5:40] that wind go right through them slabs.
[5:44] Oh, you know, speaking of that, here we
[5:46] go again. Go
[5:47] ahead. Speaking about the Second World
[5:50] War, I was about 6 years old when it
[5:52] ended. Okay. And uh uh so I'm I'm in the
[5:58] house and we must have had the radio on
[6:00] and uh I don't know if my mom uh you
[6:02] know I I wouldn't have understood it but
[6:04] my mom must have heard it and and my dad
[6:07] already had hired somebody to come out
[6:09] and and they had a truck with a grinder
[6:11] on it so you could grind the corn or the
[6:13] oats or whatever wheat. So, uh, he
[6:16] happened to be on the farm the very day
[6:18] that the war ended, and my mom heard it
[6:20] on the phone, I guess, and I and and my
[6:23] goodness, my dad was out there
[6:25] rejoicing, and this guy was just revving
[6:27] the engine
[6:28] up. The war is over. The war is over.
[6:32] Awesome. Hallelujah.
[6:35] She must heard on the party line, huh?
[6:38] Oh, yeah. That was another deal. Two
[6:40] longs and a short.
[6:43] I don't know if that was our ring or
[6:44] not, but that sound pretty good. Yeah.
[6:46] You know, you you folks wouldn't have a
[6:48] clue about a telephone on the on the
[6:50] wall, right? Where you had a
[6:53] ring along or Huh? How would you know,
[6:57] young
[6:59] lady? You must have found one at the
[7:01] auction, huh?
[7:05] And uh you know, that was our uh what
[7:09] would you call it? Little entertainment.
[7:10] Mhm. We didn't have a television quite
[7:13] at that time. And uh so there was about
[7:17] maybe half a dozen people on the party
[7:18] line. So uh the neighbor we knew we knew
[7:22] their ring, you know, and and so uh he
[7:26] had quite a bit of trouble with drinking
[7:28] and uh so ringing and picking up put it
[7:32] put the hand over there so he couldn't
[7:34] hear your
[7:36] breathing. Oh my goodness. Didn't need a
[7:38] newspaper. Got it over the
[7:42] phone. Oh no, you had an accident again.
[7:45] Oh, you're drinking. You're drunk. Oh
[7:47] no. Oh,
[7:53] now I know we're not supposed to be
[7:54] talking about televisions, but in
[7:58] 1950, my parents, my dad decided, my
[8:02] goodness, he heard about they're selling
[8:05] televisions now. So, you know, the
[8:08] neighbors would get together, play cards
[8:10] and stuff like that and uh talk a lot.
[8:12] They talk a lot. You know, probably half
[8:14] of it was gossip. I don't
[8:16] know. Who knows? But anyway, you know,
[8:19] they'd get together different farm
[8:20] houses and then well then my dad heard
[8:23] about television, man. They're selling
[8:24] television in town. And uh so he he puts
[8:28] a great big water pipe way up alongside
[8:30] the house. You can put the aerial up
[8:32] there. So he he's the first one in the
[8:34] whole community got a television set. So
[8:36] we were almost like a movie
[8:39] theater. Neighbors would come over and
[8:41] just nobody
[8:43] [Laughter]
[8:46] talk. And you know when I grew up when I
[8:50] grew up uh you know uh it was a big
[8:53] deal. I think it was Friday night was
[8:54] the big night. I don't know if it was
[8:56] either Friday or Saturday. Big big night
[8:58] in town. They were popping corn on the
[9:00] streets and they had a movie and it was
[9:02] usually one one or the other. Gene
[9:04] Audrey or Roy Rogers.
[9:06] You don't have nobody even laughed. You
[9:08] don't even know who it was. You do,
[9:10] Ronnie.
[9:12] Man, you must have been studying a lot.
[9:16] They were all cowboy movies.
[9:22] Um, in Israel there, you you used to
[9:24] tell a story a lot about being at the
[9:26] Western Wall. You remember that one
[9:28] about during one of the feasts or
[9:29] something? That's a good I don't know
[9:31] about the about the feast, but the thing
[9:33] of it is is that uh I know like I think
[9:36] even people around the message seem when
[9:39] you talk about the presence of the Lord
[9:40] around the Western Wall in Jerusalem,
[9:42] they think you're a little wacky. Uh, I
[9:45] know I went on one of the tours and you
[9:48] know the kind of standing back like they
[9:50] make you wear a cap and of course we're
[9:51] not supposed to be uncovered but you
[9:53] know I put my cap on and uh no matter
[9:56] who it hinders in the message or
[9:57] whatever I put my cap on what they or or
[10:00] they they'll they'll tell you get out
[10:02] you know so you know so uh my brother uh
[10:08] had rented a home in Jerusalem when they
[10:10] first moved there and so by the time we
[10:12] got there uh his landlord uh lived in
[10:16] the old city and uh their apartment uh
[10:22] was up quite high. I don't know how many
[10:25] stories them apartments were, but they
[10:28] were they must have been at the upper
[10:29] apartment. So,
[10:31] uh those of you that don't know about
[10:33] the old city, the old city's got several
[10:36] different gates. And uh when you my
[10:39] brother and I got off probably off the
[10:41] bus uh and uh at one of the gates and uh
[10:46] we walked and walked and walked and and
[10:48] and some of the cities starts like up
[10:51] here. Uh I can't remember what gate is
[10:53] way I remember the master's gate. I
[10:55] don't remember the names uh of the other
[10:57] woods, but the one that we got off then
[10:59] the the walkway down to the western wall
[11:03] uh it kind of slopes so all the shops
[11:06] are along on both sides. Some are Jewish
[11:08] shops, some are Arab shops. So he said,
[11:12] "Ray, if you want to go with me, I got
[11:13] to pay my rent." So, uh we're barely
[11:15] there in Israel. And so I said, "Yeah,
[11:17] man. Let's go." So we went
[11:20] up and and they had a great big window
[11:23] facing the western wall and it was by
[11:26] that time it had gotten dark and the
[11:27] lights are on and my when I looked down
[11:30] over that wall I just wow I said that's
[11:34] something. So, you know, once in a
[11:36] while, uh, we wouldn't always go there
[11:38] like the Jews do, but we would go there
[11:41] and, uh, and, you know, and, uh, and
[11:44] stand and watch and sometimes, you know,
[11:47] pray or or, you know, it was a tour and
[11:49] we just walked around and where the
[11:52] Western Wall was,
[11:55] uh, where you can see up. Now, that
[11:57] would be that would be Herod's name.
[12:00] Yeah, that would be Herod's what you can
[12:02] see her Harry's part. Now they have as
[12:06] you turn to your left as I'm uh going in
[12:09] there and you were in there too, Nathan.
[12:11] Uh there's a synagogue, but it's still
[12:14] wall. It's still wall. And they they've
[12:17] they've dug a shaft. You can see way
[12:19] down. Now, I can't say if that's really
[12:21] Solomon's that you can see or what, but
[12:24] it's quite a ways down the chamber, but
[12:27] there's where the people and the Jews, I
[12:29] don't know uh for sure where they get
[12:31] that in the scripture, but they they
[12:33] have a lot of motion when they pray,
[12:34] right? You know, they just pray. So,
[12:36] when you go in there, the sound is
[12:39] extraordinary because it's not a very
[12:41] high roof and and and it's all stone.
[12:44] So, you know, they're just praying and
[12:46] praying and some are travailing and
[12:49] things like that, you know, just and uh
[12:52] it it's something and so what really
[12:54] affected me one time
[12:57] uh we were just walking in from the
[13:01] backside and there again I don't
[13:03] remember that gate and doesn't make any
[13:04] difference but they had the yeshiva
[13:07] student what they call yeshiva students
[13:08] their Bible school Bible school students
[13:12] and uh from uh from that area up where
[13:15] my brother's landlord was there was
[13:18] large all the steps were my they might
[13:21] have been 30 foot
[13:23] wide 20 to 30 foot wide and these
[13:26] yeshiva students had joined hands and
[13:28] they were marching down singing I said
[13:31] wow I mean there's just there's just a
[13:33] presence there's just a presence that
[13:36] happens there you know and of course you
[13:38] know we're not worshiping stones or
[13:39] anything and and and of course we can do
[13:42] the same thing with brother random you
[13:43] you know, go way back. We got to have
[13:44] our experience now. But, you know, the
[13:46] thing of is but there but it's amazing
[13:50] if you look on uh you know, Israeli news
[13:52] now, the soldiers there, they go there.
[13:55] Uh they go there. Now, uh one of the
[13:57] things too uh does everyone know why the
[14:01] western pardon me? Does everyone know
[14:02] what the western Oh, yeah. I got to
[14:04] thinking about that too, brother. They
[14:05] probably don't even know. So, it's a
[14:08] uh go ahead. You can tell them from the
[14:11] beginning. So the thing of it is is that
[14:13] Solomon said there was the first temple,
[14:15] right? Then there was the second temple.
[14:19] Huh? Yep. Zerable. Zerable. And then
[14:21] then what we see is Herods. Herods.
[14:23] Herod. So that's that's the walls of the
[14:26] temple. What's left of the temple in in
[14:29] in the old city of Jerusalem. You
[14:32] understand what I'm saying? In the old
[14:34] city of Jerusalem. So that's what that's
[14:36] what uh I'm glad you brought by brother
[14:38] Wayne brought that up because I was
[14:39] wondering too if anybody even knew what
[14:40] the but that's part of the temple that
[14:43] you see and that's why I'm telling you
[14:44] that shaft I'm not even sure if that's
[14:47] irriible or if that's Solomon you can
[14:49] see down there Solomon's part there
[14:52] actually is a is a is a place where you
[14:54] can go we did it one time with brother
[14:56] Green that where you can go in where
[14:58] Solomon was carving the stones in inside
[15:04] underneath
[15:05] And we went through a real I don't know
[15:06] if that was when you were there. We went
[15:08] through a tunnel one time under the old
[15:10] city. So a lot of there's a lot of
[15:12] excavation. Every every year there's
[15:14] something happening. You know about
[15:16] Israel. I wish I wish everybody maybe
[15:18] brother Wayne take a whole church
[15:20] sometime.
[15:23] He'll pay the bill if you give the
[15:28] offering. And so uh it's amazing. You
[15:31] talk to brother Wayne. Ask him how it
[15:33] affected him even driving up to
[15:35] Jerusalem. So there's some connection
[15:38] between the bride and Israel. I can't.
[15:42] Huh? It's our home. It's our old God.
[15:47] That's when he starts weeping on the way
[15:49] up to
[15:52] Jerusalem. I'm telling young
[15:54] people, we're living for something that
[15:57] no other age has ever lived.
[16:01] No age has ever lived to see what we
[16:04] see. I don't know if I'm going to be
[16:06] able to see it,
[16:07] but I got a lot of age on me. I got a
[16:11] lot more behind me than ahead of
[16:14] me. But I'm going to tell you what, if I
[16:17] don't live to see it, you take these
[16:19] words I speak
[16:21] tonight. I'll tell you, it's real.
[16:25] And what's happening in even in this
[16:28] nation against
[16:30] Israel, we're seeing the sign of
[16:33] hatred. And that same hatred is under
[16:36] the ecclesiastical spirit against us.
[16:41] And you remember the seventh
[16:44] seal is to us is the seventh trumpet to
[16:48] them. It's the same
[16:50] thing. To us, it'll be the second
[16:52] coming. to them it's more or less almost
[16:54] the first
[16:57] coming. So there's some connection
[17:01] here that I don't think we're seeing.
[17:04] Our eyes haven't even open yet. I mean
[17:07] we're talking about the two witnesses.
[17:09] Okay. But then uh brother Wayne, you're
[17:11] going to have to help me out a little
[17:12] bit on this here. But in the church age
[17:14] book, it says something about, you know,
[17:16] about the Gentile. As the Jew took the
[17:18] Gentile, the Gentile take to the Jew.
[17:21] So that may not all mean by
[17:25] preaching. Maybe what they've seen of a
[17:31] life ever since we lived there. Now I
[17:34] don't know how many times Nathan we've
[17:35] been back there. I know I've been back
[17:36] there with you. I've taken uh uh I've
[17:40] taken Martha on one trip.
[17:42] Uh Mary went by herself. Matthew went by
[17:46] himself back. Benjamin went by No. Wait
[17:49] a minute. No. Benjamin
[17:53] AI, brother. Uh, brother Ken, right? No.
[17:56] No. Yeah. Ken Ken Boy. Yeah. We We went
[18:01] We went that time. Had a tremendous time
[18:03] and uh and just it it's just something
[18:07] unreal. It's unreal. So, you know, uh I
[18:12] I sometimes even at our local church, I
[18:14] feel a little I don't know. Maybe it's
[18:16] me. I don't know. is probably me, but I
[18:18] feel almost like do people really want
[18:20] to hear this about Israel? I mean, we
[18:22] should be praying about the peace for
[18:24] Jerusalem. It's a scripture. Should be
[18:27] praying for that. And uh and and you
[18:30] know, and uh so uh I don't know how it's
[18:33] going to come about. I don't know how
[18:36] it's going to come about them two
[18:37] witnesses. I feel I think brother Wayne
[18:39] feels the same. We've talked that that
[18:41] they'll have this message cuz this is
[18:43] the only Christ there is. Of the
[18:46] returning of the original seed. Yeah.
[18:49] Yeah. So, it's maybe like that fell.
[18:52] Yeah. I'm hoping that fell I talked to
[18:54] yesterday is a seed. They were just
[18:56] waiting on some seed even in their own
[18:57] family maybe.
[19:01] But don't grow weary and welloing.
[19:05] Brother Ronnie, go out there and preach
[19:06] to them people in Mexico, man. If you
[19:09] feel that the Lord, not because I tell
[19:10] you, but I mean, I mean, deal it out
[19:13] because, you know, God has called you
[19:14] like even with the Spanish people, you
[19:17] know, and uh my brother Wayne has been
[19:19] all over the place and and uh you know,
[19:22] I my my uh my missionary days are over.
[19:25] But to be honest with you, I never
[19:26] really had that I never really had the
[19:28] call for a missions. I did it. I did it,
[19:31] but it just really wasn't I don't know
[19:33] how much fruit I bear from it, but uh I
[19:36] I you know, I did it some of it, but uh
[19:39] it's it's a real calling. Not everybody
[19:41] can do it. Not everybody's equipped for
[19:44] it. Any questions there?
[19:48] Um what is the message to you if you had
[19:51] to put it in a few words? The message to
[19:54] me is actually Christ himself. Yeah. It
[19:58] it's it's not it's not a you know like I
[20:00] was telling that gentleman yesterday I
[20:02] said now you know I I just warned him I
[20:05] said okay if you see some things about
[20:08] brother random on the internet just
[20:09] ignore it because there's a lot of bad
[20:11] things said about him so don't don't
[20:13] even look at that but but but like I was
[20:16] uh like I was saying u now I lost my
[20:19] train of thought but to me the the
[20:21] message is a restoration back oh I was
[20:25] telling about Malachi 4 it's a restoring
[20:27] act and I said, you know, this is not
[20:29] another prophet like like Mr. Smith
[20:33] where they have to start another Bible
[20:35] or something or you know or or you know,
[20:38] but but this is taking us right back to
[20:40] the word itself. And if you remember,
[20:42] brother Vanam said, I'm not I'm not even
[20:44] I'm not even preaching another message.
[20:46] It's the same message, but it's just
[20:48] been added on to. Yeah. you know, like
[20:51] he says there in the church history
[20:52] book. Uh I was going to actually use it
[20:54] in my next ministry what would but the
[20:56] thing of it is is that you know he said
[20:58] Paul couldn't take his first uh
[21:00] revelation and then take the second one
[21:02] but it down to the age it was added too
[21:05] to bring it into a closer view. That's
[21:07] what happened through the prophet. He
[21:09] took us back to a closer field of who
[21:12] really Christ is. Yeah. Amen.
[21:15] So to me this message and you brought it
[21:19] uh Sunday it's the mechanics and the
[21:21] dynamics together. Right. So I I feel I
[21:26] feel a lot of people even in the message
[21:28] just know a lot about the mechanics. But
[21:30] have they ever I mean brother Brandon
[21:32] himself this man challenges brother Ben.
[21:35] You don't seem to know your Bible. He
[21:36] said but I know the author. And if
[21:39] you've got the inside teacher you don't
[21:41] have to be remember there what I read in
[21:43] in in in uh second John here the
[21:45] anointing the one that's inside of you
[21:47] is the teacher.
[21:49] And if you don't have the teacher this
[21:51] mission don't even mean nothing to you.
[21:52] That's right. So I do not I do not go
[21:57] along with you have to bring him to
[21:59] Jesus Christ before you bring him to the
[22:01] message. You bring him to the message
[22:03] that is Jesus Christ. But you got to be
[22:05] a little careful with a new person.
[22:08] You've got to have wisdom of how to
[22:10] share that.
[22:12] But you know I would like to see you
[22:14] young people uh now you got to be led of
[22:17] the Lord. It's just how it worked out
[22:19] yesterday. But if you're here's what I'm
[22:22] saying. Be sensitive. Yeah. When that
[22:25] man said all he had to say, I'm blessed.
[22:28] Something. Okay. This is an open door.
[22:32] Are you a Christian? Yes, sir. I'm a
[22:35] Christian,
[22:36] sir. And here he's he's a fresh guy. I
[22:39] don't know how long he's been out of the
[22:40] Catholic Church, but you know, he and
[22:44] he's still moving. He's moving around
[22:46] from church to church. So maybe he's a
[22:48] real he's an eagle.
[22:51] I'd like to see the young people be led
[22:53] of the Lord. Not to have to go out on
[22:56] the street and knock on doors and but in
[22:58] your daily routine. Yeah. All of a
[23:00] sudden you get that nudge. Yeah. That
[23:02] nudge.
[23:05] Oh
[23:07] sir, uh have you ever met Jesus Christ?
[23:11] So that's what when you ask me that what
[23:13] does the message mean to me? That's what
[23:14] it means to me is is a living word of
[23:16] God for our age.
[23:19] Yeah. And it transforms you.
[23:23] That's
[23:24] why. Yeah. And that just came fresh the
[23:27] last time I ministered. No, it was on
[23:28] that Thursday night when I said there's
[23:30] only one camel. Yeah. They don't take
[23:33] the daisies. That came fresh. I didn't I
[23:35] don't think I even planned that. It just
[23:37] came out. Only one camel.
[23:40] You talked about being in catechism and
[23:42] and the presence of the Lord came over
[23:44] you, but you uh you said you didn't
[23:46] understand yet how to yield to the Lord.
[23:48] So, no, I didn't. So, so now how would
[23:51] you how would you share how to yield to
[23:54] the Lord in his presence?
[24:00] I don't know if you can fully explain
[24:02] that
[24:03] uh to yield to the Lord like uh you see
[24:08] uh there's so many things uh down
[24:11] through the years as a message being
[24:13] preached and if it if it goes another 20
[24:15] years it'll probably be a lot more. But
[24:17] there's a
[24:20] uh you know
[24:24] uh not everybody there can explains how
[24:28] God speaks to them. Uh maybe if I could
[24:31] put it that way like you have your own
[24:33] personal I mean like brother Ram said
[24:36] you might not receive a vision like me.
[24:38] Uh but you pray and you keep praying to
[24:40] find the will of God find the vision and
[24:43] then you know so the presence of the
[24:46] Lord is to me I I I just feel feel it
[24:50] and and I've nobody can talk me out. In
[24:53] other words, oh, you're just you're just
[24:55] got feelings. You know, you know, a
[24:57] sister used to tell me Frost story, you
[24:59] know, well, feelings come, feelings go.
[25:01] That's true. Emotions come, emotions go.
[25:04] So, to me, there's a difference between
[25:06] physical emotion and the emotion of
[25:08] Christ himself. What the what the
[25:11] quickening power can do to you. Yeah.
[25:13] So, uh you know, you'll get some uh
[25:16] situations where it actually it's just
[25:18] human emotion.
[25:20] It can happen in the church. human
[25:22] emotion, but the real god-given emotion
[25:25] when the spirit of God moves on you, you
[25:27] know, I I I go back like when brother
[25:29] Brandham was uh traveling with brother
[25:31] Ed Bisco and uh I mean uh like when uh
[25:37] when brother Brandham was asking all
[25:38] these question, could this be the
[25:39] ministry of Elijah? I think uh brother
[25:41] Eddie uh and and and when brother man
[25:44] when brother Eddie looked at brother man
[25:46] he said his beard was he said we had two
[25:49] or three year beard two uh two or three
[25:51] days beard he said it just stuck out
[25:53] like this and he said it was just just
[25:55] like he was whitish you know so that
[25:59] presence was so over brother Brandham
[26:02] that also it affected brother Bisco so
[26:05] that wasn't just just a emotional
[26:08] physical
[26:10] But so so uh if your hair stands on end
[26:14] under such a presence, don't make fun of
[26:17] it. Don't uh don't make fun of anybody.
[26:20] Uh make just say Lord, it's up to you.
[26:23] Is that a person actually in the spirit
[26:24] or are they in their flesh? So So the
[26:27] thing of it is there's been so much
[26:28] against emotion. And then again on the
[26:31] other side just like he he tried to
[26:33] level it out someday. You know it's not
[26:36] I I really I really enjoyed it when he
[26:38] said you know I forget how he put it but
[26:40] it's fanaticism on this side and then
[26:42] it's legalism on this side. Formalism
[26:45] almost the same
[26:47] thing but but that's the right word
[26:49] formalism. So the thing of it is I
[26:52] believe brother Benham said himself is
[26:54] down the middle of the road
[26:57] and and and that's what I've strived
[26:59] for. I have always hit it, believe me.
[27:01] But I'm straight for down the middle of
[27:02] the road. So what? So how do you know
[27:05] what was the question again?
[27:07] About about yielding to the Lord.
[27:09] Yielding to the Lord. Yeah. So the thing
[27:11] of it is is that when the spirit of the
[27:13] Lord comes to you, you just have
[27:17] to Oh my, that's strange. I wish I just
[27:21] read a quote today, I think about that,
[27:23] but I can't remember what it actually
[27:24] how he said it. But you you you just
[27:27] have to open yourself up to it. Don't be
[27:30] afraid.
[27:31] Don't be afraid. I mean, you're a seed
[27:33] of God. He's not going to he's not going
[27:35] to let the devil put something really
[27:37] bad on you. You know what I mean? So, so
[27:40] when you when you know he's there, you
[27:42] need to you need to hearken. You need to
[27:45] hearken to it and and know, hey, Lord,
[27:47] what what are you what are you wanting
[27:49] from me? What are you what are you
[27:50] trying to tell me?
[27:52] So, it's the main thing is just yielding
[27:54] your way to that and don't be afraid of
[27:58] it because if you've got the Holy Ghost,
[28:02] he's not going to misinterpret you.
[28:06] Is that okay? Yeah. Good.
[28:09] Um, so I think one of the most beautiful
[28:13] things about your life story is Sister
[28:15] Ruth and her faithfulness. Yeah. And the
[28:18] journey that you've been on. So, yeah.
[28:20] uh since it's a gathering of young
[28:21] people, could you share some wisdom on
[28:24] on finding
[28:26] uh God's will for your mate? Yes. You
[28:33] know, see, that's something for Ruth and
[28:35] I, young
[28:37] people. Uh we both came out of the
[28:39] world, you
[28:40] know. So, for for
[28:43] us that to come in together is
[28:46] absolutely a miracle. Absolutely
[28:48] miracle. It's the
[28:50] predestination election of God that that
[28:54] that we could come together not knowing
[28:57] anything about what we know today. So
[28:59] the thing of it is she's been such a
[29:02] help me to me. Uh she's a very quiet
[29:06] person. Very quiet. I you know you may
[29:09] not think so with me because I got such
[29:11] a loud voice and I preach but I'm not
[29:13] always this loud and I'm not always
[29:15] talking a lot. Uh but we
[29:19] uh she's always uh you know stood with
[29:24] me uh not even understanding what I'm
[29:27] always doing. And uh so the thing of it
[29:32] is you young people have an opportunity
[29:35] to put your petition before the Lord on
[29:38] your mate and you're you know and
[29:40] brother Benam is always telling us the
[29:43] main thing is to look for character not
[29:46] just beauty but there's nothing wrong
[29:48] with beauty as long as there's character
[29:51] you know what I'm saying but what I'd
[29:54] like
[29:55] to not only advise you but warn you
[29:59] uh is everybody that says they're
[30:02] message believers are not message
[30:04] believers.
[30:05] Now, do you
[30:06] recall I wish I had the quote. I don't
[30:09] have the mind like these the like
[30:11] brother Wayne and these young brothers,
[30:12] but there's a quote and I'm going to
[30:15] take a little time that you ask me the
[30:17] question. Uh somebody told me it was
[30:20] actually brother Ben's relative. He
[30:22] don't say that on the quote, but I don't
[30:24] know who told me that. But if you
[30:26] remember, uh I don't know, help brother
[30:27] Wayne help me out or Nathan even or
[30:30] brother Ronnie, I don't care who does,
[30:32] but this young boy uh his parents I
[30:35] think his mother was German. Uh and the
[30:39] father was some other nationality. Well,
[30:42] the Huh? Irish. Irish. Maybe you want to
[30:44] tell it to get it right. No, you can.
[30:46] But anyway, uh the the German side uh
[30:51] was just almost always unforgiving.
[30:54] Brother Bam said he could walk by and
[30:55] they wouldn't even say a word to you or
[30:57] nothing. You know, that was the German
[30:58] side. Don't mean all Germans about them.
[31:00] My mother was German and she wasn't that
[31:02] way. And uh so the other but but both
[31:06] parents got converted. Well, they're
[31:09] wondering about this boy, you know, what
[31:12] what what's the deal with him? Uh he's a
[31:14] he's a Christian. They called him a
[31:16] Christian boy. Isn't that right? They
[31:17] called him a Christian boy. But the
[31:20] thing of it is he had uh evidently
[31:22] started dating this girl and uh and uh
[31:26] all of a sudden brother Ben don't really
[31:28] explain it all but he he said that he
[31:31] must have done something bad or dropped
[31:33] her or something. How was that again? I
[31:35] don't remember. But but anyway, he just
[31:37] he just caused a real issue with that
[31:39] girl. and and and so brother Random goes
[31:43] on this sometime I'll try I'll look up
[31:45] that quote and I'll if anybody wants it
[31:47] I'll give it to you but
[31:49] uh so he's saying that uh brother Ben
[31:53] said yeah that boy uh sure he's a fine
[31:56] young man he's a fine young man but the
[31:59] thing of it is if he don't have the Holy
[32:02] Ghost he still and I'm I'm paraphrasing
[32:05] here he still doesn't he still got some
[32:08] of that father and mother in him before
[32:10] their conversion. Them parents had
[32:12] changed. Okay. So, he's still got some
[32:15] of that in there. So, I'll shorten it up
[32:17] as best as I can. But he's he's saying
[32:19] now he's saying now to them parents that
[32:23] boy, unless he gets
[32:27] converted, he'll make hell on earth for
[32:30] any girl that he marries.
[32:33] You following me?
[32:36] Even though he was a nice boy, he still
[32:38] wasn't converted.
[32:40] So, Brother Brham saw through
[32:42] that. So, that's a little bit of a
[32:44] warning. And I've always said, and so
[32:46] the thing of it
[32:48] is, I know we're taught not to, you
[32:52] know, uh get too closeminded or or, you
[32:55] know, have the right kind of uh
[32:58] courtship. That's how we're taught and
[33:00] that's what we want. But the thing of it
[33:02] is, you know, uh I had a brother one
[33:05] time move from the east coast was in a
[33:07] false story. You heard me tell the
[33:08] story. He took a liking to one of the
[33:11] sisters in the church and he had thus
[33:13] sayeth the Lord. He said that's my wife.
[33:16] Well, she did not have
[33:19] it. So, watch these kind of things when
[33:22] you get real super spiritual. Yeah. I
[33:25] feel now Brother Wayne can uh can
[33:27] correct me.
[33:30] Um, I feel that there shouldn't just be,
[33:33] you know, you got a super spiritual
[33:35] dream or super vision or I've got touch
[33:39] of the Lord. I think there should be a
[33:40] feeling there. Yeah. There should be
[33:43] kind of a feeling uh there. You had that
[33:46] for your hand, right? Oh,
[33:49] yeah. That for you. You see what I mean?
[33:52] That's what I'm talking about. I'm not
[33:54] just being a kid about that. I mean,
[33:56] there's there's there's some kind of
[33:57] chemistry there some kind of chemistry
[34:00] going on. So the thing of it is don't
[34:03] get in a hurry just because you know the
[34:06] person even for 6 months now say for
[34:09] instance if you uh you find somebody a
[34:13] thousand miles from
[34:16] here I wouldn't marry that person
[34:19] whether it was a whether it was the
[34:21] brother's side or the or the or the
[34:23] daughter's side. I would never marry
[34:25] that person till I check with that
[34:27] pastor. And not only the parents, the
[34:30] parents would say, "Oh, yeah, that's a
[34:31] good fellow. That's a good lady." I
[34:33] would check with that pastor. How many
[34:35] years has he been sitting under your
[34:36] ministry?
[34:38] Yeah. Uh what have you seen, sir, in
[34:41] that person's life? Because I've I've
[34:45] heard, you know, I I've heard enough
[34:49] where marriages don't last.
[34:51] I mean there is not multitudes that I
[34:53] know of but it you know it it it works.
[34:56] It don't work always.
[34:59] So take your time and find
[35:02] out find out even in your local assembly
[35:05] be around those parents for a
[35:07] while. Be around with those parents.
[35:09] What are those parents like? What kind
[35:12] of offspring? How have they taught their
[35:15] children? And
[35:17] then if like another point, if they're
[35:20] if they're in another congregation miles
[35:23] from here, not only talk to the pastor,
[35:25] but find out, maybe not ask him what
[35:28] he's preaching, but find out from
[35:30] somebody in the congregation what kind
[35:31] of a uh what kind of a word is he
[35:33] actually
[35:36] preaching. I know I I know right now
[35:39] today if if somebody say, "Well, uh I'm
[35:42] going to move to certain and such." I'd
[35:43] say if I was you, I wouldn't.
[35:52] That sounds kind of rough, but that
[35:53] that's what I would say. Yeah. Promise
[35:55] you I won't because they're not even
[35:57] preaching the message. Yeah.
[36:02] Is it okay? Is that absolute?
[36:05] And maybe just one last one in general.
[36:08] What's your advice for finding the will
[36:09] of the Lord for your life? Think about
[36:11] young men looking for careers and young
[36:13] people looking for education and just
[36:16] decisions that need to be made at this
[36:17] time of life.
[36:20] Yeah, that's a that's a very depth
[36:22] question. Very depth. And uh uh uh I
[36:26] know that is the prayer is the first
[36:28] thing, but the thing that's what I'm a
[36:30] little concerned I might even share that
[36:32] with that young man yesterday. I was so
[36:35] happy to see him already buying a
[36:37] business, a business that I saw on the
[36:39] side of the truck today being
[36:41] established in
[36:42] 1987. And uh I I said that's probably
[36:46] I'm pretty sure it was him. There's a
[36:48] lot of problems with the young men
[36:52] um finding
[36:55] uh finding direction in their life. Yes,
[36:58] I believe it was him because I said, you
[37:00] know, I'm not just talking off the top
[37:02] of my head. I I had a little problem. I
[37:04] had a little problem. Uh I had I was
[37:07] telling the young man, you know, I had
[37:08] an opportunity uh as a maybe junior in
[37:11] high school, senior in high school. Uh
[37:14] we had a little uh we had what how many
[37:16] knows what Green Giant Company is?
[37:18] You've eaten their corn and Oh, yeah.
[37:20] peas and stuff. Okay. Well, in that
[37:22] little town there was a Green Giant
[37:24] Company. They canned corn in the summer.
[37:27] So, uh, my my family was, uh,
[37:30] acquaintance with one of the men that
[37:32] was, uh, director there or kind of a
[37:35] leader there. He gave me a job, uh, I
[37:38] think one of maybe, like I say, junior
[37:39] senior high school. And, you know, man,
[37:42] he gave me a job in the warehouse. All I
[37:44] had to do is count boxes and and make
[37:46] sure the the rail cars were loaded,
[37:48] right? That's why I know what Brother M
[37:50] talks about, putting the seal on, you
[37:52] know, and uh, but some of the older
[37:54] people kind of start making fun of me,
[37:55] you know. I'm just a young guy. How do
[37:57] you get this job? In other words, or
[37:58] something. And you know, I I just uh
[38:02] well, I I'm like uh uh some of the young
[38:06] men I uh you know, well, my dad's got a
[38:09] farm. What What do I need to I can just
[38:11] quit. You know, I just quit. Well, you
[38:13] know, uh I might say things uh might
[38:17] might be kind of straight, but but the
[38:20] thing of it is is that uh young ladies
[38:24] take my advice.
[38:26] Make sure that man just don't have the
[38:29] Holy Ghost and knows the message forward
[38:32] and backwards. Make sure he's
[38:34] established in a job.
[38:39] Established in a job. And uh I want to
[38:43] be all right.
[38:47] One thing I can handle. That's why I
[38:50] said I was raised to work. I was raised
[38:53] on the farm. you get to work and and and
[38:55] and things like that. But let's say but
[38:58] but I also can look on the other side
[39:00] just I'm just being open. Okay. I didn't
[39:02] get settled right away either to blue
[39:04] time. But you young men, you need to
[39:07] know. I just use uh uh No, I can't use
[39:11] that personally for one of my family.
[39:13] That would probably not be right. But
[39:16] just even in high
[39:18] school, it's even it's time to start
[39:21] finding out uh you know like uh uh
[39:27] really being settled on where don't jump
[39:30] back and forth when you know and you
[39:32] can't have a job on minimum wage anymore
[39:34] and support a wife.
[39:36] You can't do that. I don't uh I I know
[39:40] that uh uh when somebody comes to me
[39:44] about advice going to college uh hey I
[39:48] don't really look forward to sending off
[39:50] somebody uh to live in the dorms and and
[39:54] but if they can do it here in Lima uh
[39:57] now I I got to admit I've advised
[39:59] somebody that they could do part of it
[40:01] here and uh if that's your direction you
[40:04] need to go to another college for a
[40:06] But make sure your housing wherever you
[40:09] you know. So I I'm I'm really being
[40:12] open. I don't want to be just dogmatic
[40:14] about you got to stay in Lima. But I
[40:16] mean you got to really be established.
[40:18] Yeah. Because the demons of hell are in
[40:20] these colleges. Yes. Amen. As well as
[40:22] high schools now. So but uh I could go
[40:25] on so we better quit because the thing
[40:28] of it is you you brothers you know uh I
[40:32] I personally can't stand a lazy man. Uh,
[40:36] you know, and and because it's just you
[40:39] you say, "Oh, I'm in love, man. I love
[40:42] this sister, and she loves me, and man,
[40:45] we're going to have a real marriage."
[40:47] Yeah.
[40:52] Uh-huh. One year down the road, you're
[40:55] already behind in your credit card by
[40:58] thousands of dollars, and you can't pay
[41:00] it off in 10 years.
[41:04] And if you're going to start building
[41:06] up, someone are looking at me and
[41:08] someone staring at me and some are
[41:09] waving their
[41:10] head. Some are up tight and some are
[41:12] green.
[41:15] So, you know, uh, finance is a big deal
[41:18] when you're married.
[41:20] It's a big
[41:21] deal because here's my advice to my own
[41:26] family. when you get
[41:28] married, don't buy a house. Uh, too big
[41:32] a money. Here's what I suggest to them,
[41:34] and I've suggested to to believers, not
[41:37] just my
[41:38] family. You buy the house you can
[41:41] afford so that you still got enough
[41:44] money left over to buy a hamburger
[41:48] because it's really beautiful because
[41:51] you get under pressure. Pressure and it
[41:53] causes stress on the husband. There's
[41:54] going to stress on the wife and then you
[41:56] start get oh my I want to tell you honey
[41:59] you just got home from work but I'm
[42:10] expecting
[42:12] honey we don't have no
[42:22] Hallelujah.
[42:25] So that's my advice. You brothers need
[42:27] to point up. Yeah. Find out the
[42:30] leadership of the Lord for your life.
[42:31] Even when you're a junior in high
[42:33] school.
[42:36] And one of my
[42:37] children, he got some direction in in
[42:40] around around in a junior in high
[42:42] school.
[42:44] He said, "Dad, I can't go to this
[42:46] school. I'm going to go here. I got to
[42:47] get some
[42:49] credits. I feel what I'm going to do. I
[42:53] got an aim." So, he got that aim. Got
[42:56] that aim to go this way. By the time he
[42:59] was uh going going into his profession
[43:03] for school for for his profession, all
[43:06] of a sudden I ran I was selling up in
[43:09] Finley to a small college and and I was
[43:12] talking to the dean just a small college
[43:14] talking to the dean. I explained to you
[43:16] know my my one child is going into oh no
[43:20] discourage discouragement people are
[43:22] quitting that. So I went home and told
[43:24] told my child that said, "Dad, I believe
[43:28] it's okay. I'm going this way." And it
[43:32] turned out exactly right.
[43:36] So the thing of it is, don't wait until
[43:38] you get out of high school. Find some
[43:41] direction.
[43:42] Some of you are made for office work.
[43:45] Some are made for digging
[43:47] ditches. Some are you made for owning a
[43:50] business.
[43:54] But none of you are made for be lazy.
[44:03] [Applause]
[44:09] Just like
[44:12] that. So the thing with this is that uh
[44:16] and sisters don't fall for everybody and
[44:19] brothers don't fall for
[44:20] everybody. Make sure that you know the
[44:22] will of God and don't get in a hurry.
[44:26] Man, what's the difference if you're 22
[44:27] or 23? I was
[44:31] 22. Still immature. Still immature.
[44:37] and and get your wife that can help you
[44:39] with spelling like
[44:42] mine. My goodness. In fact, he text me
[44:44] in there. I know he he text me one of
[44:46] them words. I had to go into room. What
[44:48] does this mean?
[44:58] Don't we love one another?
[45:01] Huh?
[45:02] Oh, the love of God. Yeah, I've never,
[45:06] you know, sure I enjoyed life before
[45:09] conversion. I mean, I I mean, I uh I
[45:12] wasn't crazy, but I, you know, I just I
[45:16] know what a conversion means. I know
[45:18] what
[45:20] transformation I know what
[45:21] transformation means. And uh I just
[45:24] uh I just want to see you all uh be
[45:29] successful physically and mentally and
[45:32] spiritually.
[45:34] I want to see that. I want whoever
[45:35] closes in prayer, we just pray together
[45:38] and join our hands together and uh and
[45:42] because it's really uh you're you young
[45:45] people, I know you hear it over and
[45:46] over. It's the hardest age it ever was
[45:48] compared to when I was young. That's
[45:50] true. That's true. You got a lot of
[45:52] things, but you got a lot more
[45:54] word. You got a lot more word than I
[45:56] had. And uh so the thing of it is uh uh
[46:02] a lot of things are real in life, you
[46:03] know. Uh you know uh don't I mean you
[46:07] you'll go through things. Uh you know I
[46:11] I I didn't I I don't need to share
[46:14] everything I went through but it it
[46:15] hasn't all been mountain top. But that's
[46:17] that's one question I have for you is
[46:21] like I mean you've been a Christian.
[46:22] What year did you become a Christian? I
[46:24] became a Christian in uh the end of 67.
[46:28] 67. So right around right in that area.
[46:31] Yeah. So you're you know you're over 60
[46:34] years and Yeah. Well, but even today
[46:38] your spirit is so good. So your spirit
[46:43] is so good how you approach things. And
[46:46] you didn't start out knowing everything.
[46:48] No.
[46:49] So what got you through life was the
[46:52] spirit you took on your trials on your
[46:56] developments. You had changes you
[46:58] moved but your approach to everything
[47:02] had a certain spirit and that's one
[47:05] thing I I would enjoy if you would talk
[47:07] about just a minute on is the spirit to
[47:11] hold towards correction towards guidance
[47:14] towards leadership. I I think it's
[47:17] highly important, you know, but but
[47:19] coming from you, it's not something
[47:22] that's been forecast. I mean, you've
[47:24] lived it for 60 years to prove it's it's
[47:26] a good thing that you took. Something
[47:29] took you through every situation. Yeah.
[47:32] Yeah. Yeah. I know that uh like I like I
[47:35] said already uh that it hasn't all been
[47:38] mountaintop. And uh the thing of it is
[47:41] is that uh
[47:44] um you know I uh I don't like to get
[47:47] into these areas sort of because I don't
[47:50] want the devil always to listen to it.
[47:52] But uh the thing of it is is that uh my
[47:55] mom my mom was a nervous person and uh I
[48:00] suffered a bit with that at times and
[48:03] even more so at certain times and uh but
[48:07] that can be also drive you you know
[48:09] drive you to the good in some but also
[48:12] uh I found myself
[48:15] uh like like I I was just saying not too
[48:19] long ago to somebody if I would have
[48:22] quit because of all the wrong that I saw
[48:25] or got a bad spirit. I never incorporate
[48:28] cooporate that. But being I'm getting
[48:30] this question for brother by the way,
[48:31] I'll incorporate it. Uh all the negative
[48:35] stuff around this message and all the
[48:37] different things that happened if I
[48:39] would have taken that and let that get
[48:41] in my heart uh it would have sunk me. Uh
[48:45] it would have uh you know it it would be
[48:48] uh enough. But the thing of it is I
[48:52] believe the Holy Ghost
[48:54] himself, we got to take it back to the
[48:56] word. Greater is he that's in us than he
[48:59] that's in the world. So what I would
[49:02] like to uh encourage you is that things
[49:06] are not always going to go your way. Not
[49:09] not everything is going to fit what you
[49:11] think should be. And uh you're going to
[49:13] butt up against people. You're going to
[49:16] you're going to butt up against people.
[49:18] And so in order to keep the right spirit
[49:22] uh you've heard me preach about divine
[49:24] love uh agape love. So, you know, feel
[49:29] your love, you can still have arguments,
[49:34] right? Feel your love, you can still
[49:36] have argument, disagreements, you can
[49:38] go, you know, but I found out that uh it
[49:42] hasn't always been easy. Like, uh, you
[49:45] know, uh, say for instance, you got
[49:47] somebody in your church, uh, you know,
[49:49] and you get pretty close to them and,
[49:52] uh, you go to their house and then
[49:53] they've been to your house. And I
[49:55] remember in years ago and uh my you know
[49:59] we were pretty close and uh I don't know
[50:02] for some reason and uh they went to
[50:04] Fosttory with me and uh and uh all of us
[50:09] son he just turned on me he just turned
[50:12] on me. Uh I don't know what I had done
[50:15] or I don't think I had done and uh so
[50:19] that really hurt. Uh but you know uh I
[50:24] guess I think it's the grace of God,
[50:26] brother Wayne, that I've been able to
[50:29] uh uh I say I but it's a God in me. Uh
[50:33] no man can do it, but it's a God in me
[50:36] that's helped me to overcome the hurts,
[50:40] you know, the hurts and the uh things,
[50:42] you know, being rejected. you know, I
[50:45] was I was I was told, you know, uh well,
[50:48] I don't I can't bring certain things out
[50:51] because it's it's by gone and it would
[50:54] help people. I know it would, but I it
[50:56] would be involving names and I don't I
[50:58] don't want to do that. I I just don't
[51:00] feel that would be right. And it would
[51:02] involve churches and but the thing of it
[51:05] is is that uh to maintain that spirit it
[51:09] uh I think I take it
[51:12] back I probably take it back to uh to
[51:16] who is this Melzdc in some ways
[51:20] that the spirit of the Lord in other
[51:23] words when he said I I I know I'm not
[51:25] quoting it right but when that immortal
[51:27] spirit comes into you tabernacles in you
[51:30] uh it can bring this flesh into
[51:32] subjection. It can bring our spirit
[51:34] realm and our flesh realm into
[51:36] subjection. How many believes that
[51:38] because it's the greater one. So the
[51:40] thing of it
[51:41] is none of us can be super spiritual
[51:44] because when we get hurt we get hurt.
[51:46] How many agree with that? I mean we
[51:48] really get hurt and it don't all heal at
[51:50] once sometime. It's not oh you know so
[51:54] what. But I find out what really helps
[51:58] people is you've got something bothering
[52:00] you between somebody, I'll tell you what
[52:03] your flesh immediately says, "No, I
[52:05] can't go. No, I can't face that person.
[52:08] I cannot face it." There's where you're
[52:10] missing the boat.
[52:12] Because if you will go brother to
[52:14] brother or sister to sister or vice
[52:16] versa, whatever. So the best thing when
[52:19] something is bothered, if my spirit is
[52:21] tore up, I haven't always done it. I'm
[52:24] not the author of of of perfectness, but
[52:28] when that when that your spirit gets
[52:30] tore up, you're going to live with that
[52:33] thing until you get that settled. You'd
[52:35] be surprised. You might go a week and it
[52:37] don't bother you. All of a sudden, it
[52:39] pops up in your mind again. So the
[52:41] minute there's something that happens
[52:43] between brother and brother or sister
[52:45] and sister or whatever in a church in
[52:48] with your pastor whatever so on with
[52:51] somebody don't let that thing
[52:54] fester get it settled because you'll
[52:56] both get deliverance even though the
[52:58] other one don't even know maybe what
[53:00] they did but as you talk you'll get
[53:03] deliverance you'll get you'll get
[53:05] victory. the the thing that's keeping
[53:07] you from it is your mind
[53:09] and your flesh. And and and they're both
[53:12] they both can be
[53:15] deceptive. So the tabernacle of God, the
[53:17] deity within us wants to have
[53:21] purity and have no
[53:25] disgruntles. It's very important. Very
[53:28] important. So I don't I can't explain
[53:31] how how how the Lord has kept my spirit
[53:33] because uh I know like I say I I I know
[53:38] Ruth come would come to me different
[53:40] times said well what about this Ray I
[53:41] mean look at the way way the way way
[53:43] they went and and they were supposed to
[53:46] be so you know and then and I just
[53:49] sometimes say well dear I don't I don't
[53:52] know I just let's just leave it let's
[53:56] just leave it you know but And it may
[53:59] not be, I'm not saying against us. It's
[54:01] just the way they're supposed to be real
[54:03] Christians and they lived contrary or
[54:06] they did something contrary to what they
[54:08] were saying to everybody else. Oh, you
[54:10] need to do this. You know, I just uh I
[54:14] learned a lot as a young Christian about
[54:17] legalism. Man, it's a killer. It's a
[54:20] real killer. Uh uh I've seen people just
[54:24] on the young ladies on the young girls
[54:26] the
[54:27] uh you know so much about how in the why
[54:31] in the world do you dress like that?
[54:32] Well I know I know we've all done it
[54:35] all. Instead of saying have you got the
[54:38] new birth dear? Yeah.
[54:42] That's what will change the dress.
[54:45] Once you get the tabernacle deity in you
[54:47] that's what's going to change your
[54:48] spirit, your nature. Your nature is your
[54:51] soul, right?
[54:54] So why are you wearing like this today?
[54:56] Why you got that makeup on you? It needs
[54:59] to be preached. I mean, we don't want to
[55:00] be Joel
[55:04] Ostein. But the thing of it is is that
[55:07] the thing what will produce the right
[55:09] thing is a new birth.
[55:12] There's what's missing. And so we we've
[55:14] taken some of this legalism and driving
[55:16] into, you
[55:17] know, why, you know, why you got this
[55:20] here? How far are we going to go? I
[55:23] mean, this might be a touchy point, but
[55:25] I mean, Brother Wayne, you probably
[55:27] wonder where I'm coming from now, but
[55:29] Brother Wayne loves it.
[55:32] Okay. Uh, Brother Venom blasted TVs,
[55:35] right?
[55:36] And none of us got
[55:38] TVs, so we all got internet and
[55:40] smartphones. Yeah. Yeah. So, what would
[55:43] he say if he was here?
[55:47] Real quiet.
[55:49] What would he say?
[55:53] There's more dangerous now.
[55:57] But if you got the Holy Ghost, that's
[55:58] right.
[56:00] Now, you got trouble with pornography,
[56:03] you shouldn't even have that stuff.
[56:07] But here's another thing. You can lock a
[56:10] person up in their closet
[56:13] and you'll still never be a Christian.
[56:18] Are you following me?
[56:20] Lock them up in their closet and you'll
[56:22] still never be a Christian. Without the
[56:25] new birth, there's no hope.
[56:30] A man actually can better himself a bit,
[56:33] but he'll come right back. and even
[56:35] worse as the Bible
[56:38] said. So, Brother Wayne, I don't I can't
[56:41] explain fully how the Lord has helped me
[56:43] to keep the right spirit. Um, I just I
[56:46] know it's the grace of God. It's not me.
[56:49] Uh, but you know, we I' I've battled
[56:52] I've battled with many things. I've
[56:55] battled with many things because of from
[56:58] 1967 on uh you know, seeing so much.
[57:03] seeing so much. Wouldn't you say that
[57:05] your
[57:06] success came from that you kept the
[57:09] right spirit in every avenue? Exactly.
[57:12] Exactly. No matter because you How many
[57:15] situations did you have that would have
[57:18] sunk you had you took the wrong spirit?
[57:21] Exactly. Yeah. It would have it would
[57:23] have it would have sunk me and that's
[57:25] why brother Wayne I would have liked to
[57:26] have shared some things that probably
[57:28] would have helped but it's it's it's it
[57:30] would bring it would have started
[57:31] bringing names and and and I I really
[57:34] can't do that uh because that's uh all
[57:38] past history under the blood of trust.
[57:41] But the the thing of it is is the the
[57:43] very thing that I was told uh I was
[57:47] asked about uh
[57:51] uh what if what if Ray you did s such
[57:54] and such a thing and uh to a certain
[57:57] church and the very thing and of course
[58:01] you know I I said no I don't I don't
[58:04] want that well the very thing that the
[58:06] the brother was asking me about is the
[58:08] very thing another man did to the
[58:11] church. So sometimes I want to include
[58:14] that too. I know it's getting very late
[58:16] but uh I can still go on if you can.
[58:20] Who's all working your mind?
[58:22] Lord have mercy. That's
[58:26] good. No. Uh oh Lord don't let me forget
[58:29] this. This was really something very
[58:32] important. I
[58:34] should I didn't say enough for somebody
[58:36] to remind me.
[58:39] Lord, bring it back because it's
[58:42] great. Oh, I can't think. Oh, sorry,
[58:47] Lord. I had something. But anyway, uh
[58:51] yeah. So, the thing of it is is
[58:53] that so then you just stand by and you
[58:56] say, "Well, you know, you don't
[58:57] pronounce judgment or you know, if you
[58:59] got that, then you got the wrong
[59:01] spirit." But uh you know, you'll have a
[59:04] you'll have some real warfare, some real
[59:06] warfare sometimes with
[59:09] situations. Uh but it's it's so
[59:12] important to uh keep that right spirit
[59:15] because you cannot you cannot change
[59:19] everything. You just have to figure that
[59:21] out. You cannot change everybody. You
[59:23] can't change people. God has to do that.
[59:26] And uh I just wish I could have remember
[59:28] because I was on to something really I
[59:30] really could have helped.
[59:32] But the thing of it is is that uh that I
[59:36] believe God has given me mercy uh you
[59:39] know like uh something would happen a
[59:42] situation you know and and uh I you know
[59:46] uh say for instance you know you get a
[59:48] little ruffle with somebody uh and then
[59:51] some and then they leave the church even
[59:53] and something like that and and then uh
[59:56] you hear they're sick and and uh I've
[59:59] had I've had this you and you go to the
[1:00:01] hospital and you're sick and then their
[1:00:06] their their their mother's there or
[1:00:08] their father's there and and uh there
[1:00:12] again I I I just don't do names but you
[1:00:14] know and uh my when we start praying for
[1:00:18] the for the individual that's sick and
[1:00:20] the presence of the Lord comes in the
[1:00:21] room and it just it starts melting
[1:00:24] starts melting spirits you know that are
[1:00:27] hurt and I'm not saying I as a pastor
[1:00:29] have always done everything right. But,
[1:00:32] you know, I'm not I mean, you know, so
[1:00:36] you know, it's just uh and and things
[1:00:38] have hurt, Brother Wayne. Uh you know,
[1:00:42] we'll find this out. Uh you know, I
[1:00:44] mean, everything go just like 100% and
[1:00:47] all of a sudden something hit the
[1:00:48] church. And what the thing of it is
[1:00:51] that's what hurts. Somebody come in the
[1:00:53] back room and and say to you, you know,
[1:00:55] Brother Wing, I just want to talk to you
[1:00:56] a minute.
[1:00:59] Uh, I just want to tell you we're going
[1:01:01] to be leaving the
[1:01:03] church. Oh, well, is this something I'd
[1:01:06] done or what? Well, well, no, no, just,
[1:01:10] you know, well, no, that hurts. And then
[1:01:13] what really hurts? Somebody leaves a
[1:01:15] church and don't even tell you.
[1:01:18] That really hurts, you know. And then,
[1:01:20] uh, so the thing of it is is that you're
[1:01:23] going to get hurt. You there's no
[1:01:25] there's no putting on you. I've been
[1:01:27] hurt. There's no putting on. Uh somebody
[1:01:30] come in the back. It's kind of funny
[1:01:33] this part. Somebody came, this is only a
[1:01:36] few years back, come in the back room
[1:01:38] and said, "Brother,
[1:01:39] uh
[1:01:42] uh we're sorry, but uh we feel to leave
[1:01:46] the church, you know, we uh" So I kind
[1:01:49] of asked him, "Well, where are you
[1:01:50] going?" He told me where we
[1:01:52] going. So we talked for quite a while. I
[1:01:55] hated it. I hated it. I hate to see the
[1:01:57] go good people and really good people.
[1:02:01] So the funny part of this. So uh it's
[1:02:04] time the time they they want to go. So I
[1:02:07] I'm I'm going to go over and hug the
[1:02:09] brother. Okay. I'm hugging the brother.
[1:02:10] So the sister's sitting right over here.
[1:02:12] Okay. So I'm hugging the brother. And so
[1:02:15] I got carried away and she stood up and
[1:02:16] I was going to hug her.
[1:02:24] No, it's not the
[1:02:28] millennium. That's not the, you know, he
[1:02:31] didn't say don't don't hug my wife
[1:02:37] now. You know what's helped me a little
[1:02:39] bit too? Sense of humor.
[1:02:44] You know what also helped
[1:02:47] me? I could have actually quit work
[1:02:50] before I did. And I don't recommend this
[1:02:53] for brother Wayne. I mean, he's been a
[1:02:54] he's been on the road and he's been, you
[1:02:56] know, and so I'm not I'm not saying
[1:02:59] this. But for me,
[1:03:02] uh that's another thing is in bound
[1:03:05] supply company, I was getting so worry
[1:03:08] and working 5 days a week. So I found a
[1:03:10] lot of grace. And uh and then I turned
[1:03:14] out I needed uh surgery and uh I was
[1:03:18] just beat. Uh it it affected me. Uh I
[1:03:21] was emotionally affected and physically
[1:03:23] affected. Uh I was waiting on the Lord
[1:03:25] to heal me. And nothing happened. And I
[1:03:28] felt, hey, you're a pastor. You're a
[1:03:31] believer. You're supposed to really
[1:03:32] believe. And the devil worked me over.
[1:03:35] And I really got worked over hard. But I
[1:03:37] finally had the surgery. And I think I
[1:03:40] probably took that out of context too a
[1:03:42] bit. Not not keeping it a balance.
[1:03:45] There's nothing wrong with having
[1:03:46] surgery. I had another one after that.
[1:03:48] But the thing of it is is that
[1:03:51] uh you know and I finally talked to
[1:03:54] brother Tom Brown, the owner of the
[1:03:55] business, and said, "Brother Tom, is
[1:03:58] there any way is there any any way I can
[1:04:02] work four days ago?" No. No. Well, I
[1:04:05] take that back after I had I had to be
[1:04:07] off six weeks work. Well, I already was
[1:04:09] in uh that's right. I was already in
[1:04:11] sales. So, I was coming out of physical
[1:04:14] into sales, but I was only part-time.
[1:04:16] Sometimes I had to drive truck,
[1:04:17] sometimes I work in the warehouse,
[1:04:19] sometimes I had to work on dishwasher,
[1:04:20] sometimes in sales. So, he kept me on
[1:04:23] hourly wage. So, after that surgery, uh
[1:04:26] then I asked Brother Tom, I said, you
[1:04:28] know, Tom, uh is there any way I can
[1:04:32] just work? I I can't remember all the
[1:04:35] sequence I worked four days a week and
[1:04:38] uh and uh you know because of all the
[1:04:41] strain and uh trying to pastor work and
[1:04:44] so uh he said well I don't think I don't
[1:04:46] think any I'll talk to my manager and so
[1:04:50] he gave me the liberty to go full-time
[1:04:52] sales and uh and work four days a week
[1:04:56] so that helped me a lot. I had that
[1:04:58] extra day.
[1:05:00] So yeah. So so I've seen uh and I I I
[1:05:04] don't like to share everything because
[1:05:06] of but I've seen some real bleak times a
[1:05:08] real bleak time and that don't always
[1:05:10] show. All it shows now is my uh you know
[1:05:13] my joking around and laughing but uh I
[1:05:16] haven't always laughed. I've been down
[1:05:18] some serious roads. Um one trial I went
[1:05:22] through about a year over a year uh just
[1:05:25] broken up. Just broken up. And uh I
[1:05:28] still had to work. I still had to
[1:05:30] preach, but I was I was broken broken
[1:05:32] up. And uh and I didn't know if I'd ever
[1:05:36] get through that valley, but the Lord
[1:05:38] brought me
[1:05:40] out. You got a question?
[1:05:43] So the Lord brought me out of
[1:05:45] that of of different circumstances that
[1:05:48] people don't even know about except I
[1:05:50] don't even know. Well, my family knew
[1:05:52] some of the things I went through.
[1:05:54] Uh so the thing of it is is that uh
[1:05:59] don't don't don't be afraid of opening
[1:06:02] up people about your situations. Uh you
[1:06:06] know when you need prayer, you need
[1:06:08] help, you need
[1:06:09] consultation. Uh dear
[1:06:18] God, I've sat on the end of the bed or
[1:06:22] the side of the bed.
[1:06:27] So, so
[1:06:29] wor
[1:06:32] depression didn't know if it was coming
[1:06:34] or
[1:06:35] going. But I had to pick up my
[1:06:38] feet. I had to keep
[1:06:41] going. I had to keep preaching. I had to
[1:06:45] keep
[1:06:47] working. God has always delivered me.
[1:06:52] He's always delivered
[1:06:55] me. So, this might help somebody. I
[1:06:57] don't like to get into all this rough
[1:07:00] stuff that I've been through because a
[1:07:03] lot of it's been
[1:07:05] hidden. But I'll tell you
[1:07:07] what, you get to the end of your
[1:07:10] line and all you can depend upon. I'll
[1:07:13] tell you who I could depend upon. I
[1:07:14] could depend upon my
[1:07:17] wife. I could depend upon my family.
[1:07:27] So, I know what it
[1:07:29] is where you just feel like you can't go
[1:07:31] another
[1:07:33] mile, but God can get you up.
[1:07:37] So, that might help somebody. I didn't
[1:07:39] really want to get into that, but uh you
[1:07:42] know, all of this, you know, you start
[1:07:45] running somebody down because they got
[1:07:46] anxiety and their depression, you're
[1:07:48] wrong.
[1:07:50] You know why you're doing that? Because
[1:07:52] you never been through it.
[1:07:56] It's real people.
[1:07:59] It's real. That's why we need to have
[1:08:01] compassion.
[1:08:04] And that's why I believe I can help
[1:08:05] people. It's just like I'm not saying in
[1:08:08] the capacity of Brother Van with the
[1:08:10] crosseyed children, but when I I can see
[1:08:12] certain things. Remember when brother
[1:08:14] Danny Steven was here and he shared his
[1:08:16] background going through a nervous time
[1:08:18] and and then wore out and remember he
[1:08:21] shared in church and it set somebody
[1:08:23] free. Yeah. I don't know brother wayne
[1:08:25] if you remember who that was don't make
[1:08:27] a difference but it set somebody free
[1:08:29] because of his testimony.
[1:08:38] Okay, I think it's late enough.
[1:08:41] Well, I just want to
[1:08:44] say, you know, you you've been a
[1:08:47] grandfather to me in the natural, but
[1:08:49] spiritually you've been a you've been my
[1:08:51] father in the
[1:08:53] gospel. We kind of introduced you like
[1:08:55] an Abraham because you're just like a
[1:08:58] patriarch to all of us. that we it just
[1:09:01] seems like two words that
[1:09:03] don't that aren't big enough, but we
[1:09:05] want to say thank you for your life and
[1:09:08] your ministry and your
[1:09:10] leadership. Um kind of like a patriarch
[1:09:14] would do to his children. Uh maybe we
[1:09:16] could just close and and uh I'd like to
[1:09:20] ask you to to pray a blessing prayer
[1:09:22] over our young people.
[1:09:26] Nathan, that uh I single you out a
[1:09:29] little bit too.
[1:09:32] Uh even when
[1:09:38] you even when you wrote me my last
[1:09:41] birthday card, the words you
[1:09:44] wrote, I still have it.
[1:09:50] You know, that's why
[1:09:52] I call somebody, write
[1:09:56] somebody, send them a card, give them a
[1:09:58] greeting, encourage
[1:10:05] people. I would have never been this far
[1:10:07] without my wife and my children and my
[1:10:10] grandchildren now and my great
[1:10:14] grandchildren. Can you
[1:10:17] imagine? Not that I'm deserving of it.
[1:10:21] But my but the
[1:10:23] inheritance
[1:10:26] spiritually that my children believe and
[1:10:30] grandchildren are
[1:10:31] leaving the great grands are going to
[1:10:34] come.
[1:10:37] What's heaven going to be like?
[1:10:41] And don't give up on nobody. We got to
[1:10:43] we got to quit because you guys got to
[1:10:46] get to work. I just
[1:10:49] I wonder if we just stand together.
[1:10:56] If I said anything, please forgive
[1:10:59] me. But I I just trusted him to be a
[1:11:02] blessing to you. Like I
[1:11:05] say, you
[1:11:07] know, I believe I still could have a few
[1:11:10] years. you know,
[1:11:13] uh, last blood test I had is I I I by
[1:11:17] his grace I got a tremendous report,
[1:11:19] tremendous report for my age, but I
[1:11:22] don't know. Neither do you. You can go
[1:11:24] before
[1:11:26] me. But the rapture could be
[1:11:30] tomorrow. Ain't that true?
[1:11:42] Lord
[1:11:45] Jesus, Father, we've sensed your
[1:11:47] presence here tonight.
[1:11:50] Lord, I look over these many young
[1:11:55] people and I see a great
[1:11:58] potential for them as
[1:12:00] individually and as the kingdom of
[1:12:04] God. And so, Father, as one of the
[1:12:08] elders, I pray a blessing over each one
[1:12:11] of
[1:12:13] them that each one of them will receive
[1:12:15] the Holy Ghost and fire in their very
[1:12:19] being and change their nature from what
[1:12:22] they were to what they should be in
[1:12:24] Christ Jesus. I pray you open the
[1:12:27] windows of heaven by
[1:12:29] revelation so that the gates of hell
[1:12:31] cannot prevail against
[1:12:33] them. And father, may it all not be by
[1:12:37] dos and don'ts, but by the grace of
[1:12:40] God. And Father, as the mechanics are
[1:12:45] preached with the dynamics added to it,
[1:12:48] Father, Father, we've got anointed
[1:12:50] ministry in our midst. Father, we got an
[1:12:54] anointed pastor. We've got anointed
[1:12:56] ministers. Father, may you use them in a
[1:13:00] special way. Father, not only in our own
[1:13:03] congregation, but throughout the birth
[1:13:05] of the world. Father, may you give
[1:13:08] health and strength to each one of these
[1:13:10] young people. Father, may you give them
[1:13:12] encouragement. Lord, may you give those
[1:13:15] that are sick, those that have a
[1:13:17] lingering sickness in their body. May
[1:13:19] you heal them. Father, those that have
[1:13:22] complexes, may you deliver them from
[1:13:24] every complex that's been placed upon
[1:13:27] them. Satan, take their hands off of
[1:13:30] God's property. They're sons and
[1:13:33] daughters of a living God. So, Father, I
[1:13:36] pronounce blessings and upon blessings
[1:13:39] upon blessings upon every son and
[1:13:42] daughter of God in this midst and those
[1:13:45] that could not be here. In the name of
[1:13:47] the Lord Jesus Christ, may you guide
[1:13:50] them by their inner being, Father, and
[1:13:54] keep them all the days of their life in
[1:13:57] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
