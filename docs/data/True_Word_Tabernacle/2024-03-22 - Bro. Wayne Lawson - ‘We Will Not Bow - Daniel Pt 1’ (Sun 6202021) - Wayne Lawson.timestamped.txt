[5:22] your mercy now in the name of Jesus
[5:24] Christ we pray amen and amen and God
[5:28] bless you today if you have your Bibles
[5:32] amen we would like to turn to the Book
[5:33] of Daniel in the first chapter and amen
[5:37] we have a few things uh to look at today
[5:41] uh from The Book of Daniel I I've got it
[5:43] on my heart just to study uh this book
[5:46] just a little bit um and what I have
[5:50] found out is that uh in the very first
[5:54] the very first
[5:55] chapter uh we would need an entire week
[5:58] of Bible history just to understand the
[6:01] reading so I'm not going to try to bore
[6:03] you with every uh scripture and every
[6:05] thing but but you I'll give you some of
[6:07] the scripture and you're you can able to
[6:09] go back and read them and go through
[6:10] them and it's there a lot of tremendous
[6:12] reading and and understanding so we but
[6:15] I I'll just maybe make it a little bit
[6:17] shorter and just give you the synopsis
[6:19] of of some of these things amen but uh
[6:21] if we could read from Book of Daniel
[6:23] here the first chapter and the first
[6:26] verse for in the third year of the reign
[6:30] of jehm king of Judah came
[6:34] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto
[6:37] Jerusalem and besieged it may God bless
[6:40] the reading of his words you may be
[6:43] seated
[6:45] um I think it's a very interesting study
[6:48] the Book of Daniel of course it's the
[6:49] parallel to the Book of Revelations in
[6:52] the New Testament The Book of Daniel was
[6:54] written uh in the land of Babylon and
[6:57] Daniel under captivity as a slave
[7:00] of Babylon but yet he was inspired by
[7:02] the word of God to write it amen and to
[7:05] leave it to the church um I I I think
[7:08] it's amazing that we're still here now
[7:10] uh 4,000 years later nearly reading of
[7:14] the things that a man pinned while in
[7:16] captivity in Babylon what a dedicated
[7:19] life amen what a what a servant of God
[7:22] that his words amen would live that long
[7:25] amen um and in in here if you if you
[7:28] approach this book The Book of Daniel uh
[7:31] in the first chapter it begins with a
[7:33] very interesting verse here for in the
[7:35] third year the reign of jeam the king of
[7:38] Judah now in that very saying right
[7:41] there it's going to announce something
[7:43] to you because this is really not the
[7:45] name of this king of Judah uh his name
[7:48] actually is not at all uh jehm it's been
[7:51] changed it's actually eam it's uh he is
[7:55] the second son of King Josiah how many
[7:57] remembers who Josiah was in the Bible
[8:00] Josiah was the king that uh caused God
[8:03] to not destroy Judah at the time and and
[8:07] as long as he lived remember he was the
[8:09] he was the one that had the greatest
[8:11] Passover amen that the nation had ever
[8:14] knew he was the one that went in and
[8:15] destroyed all of the Witchcraft from
[8:17] among cut down the Groves and God really
[8:20] blessed the nation of Israel because of
[8:22] Josiah and as long as Josiah was alive
[8:25] God's hand was stayed and and the
[8:27] judgments wasn't oppon it but then after
[8:29] the death of Josiah it was in the time
[8:32] of this that his first son Josiah's
[8:34] first son was raised up to the throne
[8:36] and he only was about I think it was
[8:39] less than a year uh just a few months
[8:41] actually that he was able to Reign uh
[8:43] the eldest son of Josiah after his death
[8:46] and it was then that the Egyptians came
[8:49] and actually took took him into
[8:50] captivity which which josi himself was
[8:53] killed in a battle with Egypt and the
[8:55] king of Egypt killed him and then his
[8:57] son his first son then was was was toen
[9:00] off of the throne in 2 Kings if you like
[9:03] to read it it's in 2 Kings CH 23: uh 33
[9:07] and then 24:5 the Bible says that
[9:10] Pharaoh put unto him the the bonds and
[9:12] in the land of HTH that he might not
[9:14] reign in Jerusalem first son of Josiah
[9:16] now put the land a tribute of 100
[9:18] talents of silver talents of gold and
[9:21] Pharaoh then made eclam the son of
[9:23] Josiah the king in the room of Josiah
[9:25] his father and turned his name to joim
[9:29] uh was actually the changing of a name
[9:31] by an Egyptian king that was now sitting
[9:34] on the throne of Jerusalem can you
[9:36] imagine that Judah is being ruled by a
[9:39] king who carries the name that has been
[9:42] changed by an Egyptian king so in other
[9:44] words amen the the the kingdom was now
[9:46] in the in the Reigns of men who were not
[9:49] men like King David these were not men
[9:52] who were born in bread and anointed of
[9:55] God to lead the country but they were
[9:57] being placed by Egyptians and their name
[9:59] Nam were being changed to show Egyptian
[10:01] rule over them and these were the kinds
[10:03] of men that were actually leading Israel
[10:06] in the days that the Book of Daniel was
[10:09] written and and this is of course why
[10:12] that the Book of Daniel was written from
[10:14] Babylon is because of the fall of the
[10:16] kings in the land of Israel which of
[10:20] course is Judah by now now if you're in
[10:22] your Bible History you all know that
[10:24] Israel and Judah are now two separate
[10:26] Nations they were actually uh the tribe
[10:30] of Israel of course were 12 sons of
[10:33] Jacob become the sons of Israel which
[10:35] were the state of of Israel itself which
[10:37] would have been 12 States but two of the
[10:40] states were pulled off and made what we
[10:43] call Judah which Jerusalem would be the
[10:45] capital and it was remained for the for
[10:47] the seed of David So Judah was a
[10:49] separate nation in itself had its own
[10:52] Kings and then God sent prophets to it
[10:54] but then Israel had its own King and had
[10:57] 10 tribes and they they had their own
[11:00] Nation so it was separate now Israel has
[11:02] already been carried off by the
[11:04] Assyrians before this has happened
[11:06] Israel has already been carried off by
[11:08] the Assyrians and Judah has been left
[11:10] but now Judah is being ruled by evil
[11:13] Kings now now it's amazing because if
[11:16] you look at this Israel should have been
[11:19] together as a nation but now part of
[11:21] it's gone only two tribes exist and a
[11:23] king sets up on the throne of it that
[11:25] has been taken over by Egypt and and now
[11:28] he's actually fleecing the people he's a
[11:30] very evil man and the scripture showing
[11:33] us that he's teaching the people evil
[11:36] ways now to think that Daniel and the
[11:39] children of Israel that was in Judah are
[11:42] living under an evil rule even in their
[11:44] own land can you imagine living in a
[11:48] land where God was supposed to be
[11:50] reigning that his word should have been
[11:51] the rule and yet that while they were
[11:54] yet in their own country amen they were
[11:57] not under good influences of a King but
[12:00] the scripture teaches us here that in
[12:02] the Book of Daniel that in the third
[12:03] year amen of this man's Reign that
[12:06] Nebuchadnezzar comes down and of course
[12:09] he has a battle Nebuchadnezzar there's
[12:10] three great three great uh rulings at
[12:13] this time there's Egypt there's Assyria
[12:15] and there's Babylon but according to
[12:17] prophecy Babylon is going to actually
[12:20] take over the entire world this is the
[12:22] prophecies that Jeremiah is making he's
[12:24] beginning to pronounce babylon's going
[12:26] to take over which the King
[12:27] Nebuchadnezzar God's going to giv him
[12:29] Rule and then when King Nebuchadnezzar
[12:31] starts coming down to fight of course
[12:34] with the Egyptians he again takes over
[12:36] amen and and the scripture teaches us uh
[12:39] and I'd have to read a bunch of
[12:40] scripture to you to get to all this amen
[12:42] but the but the scripture teaches us
[12:44] that whenever about the third year of
[12:47] the reign of this man jeh hoim which is
[12:50] under the Egyptian rule that he Rebels
[12:53] against
[12:54] Nebuchadnezzar now God has anointed
[12:56] Nebuchadnezzar to take over the world
[12:59] world and now we have a king who's
[13:01] living in Judah who's under the
[13:02] influence of Egypt who's rejecting the
[13:05] will of God again even in Nebuchadnezzar
[13:08] coming and and the scripture teaches us
[13:10] this is when that Daniel goes into
[13:13] captivity now if You' like to study
[13:16] Bible History of course Babylon is going
[13:18] to pull about three or four different
[13:21] Exiles out of out of Judah over a space
[13:25] of years it it's a scripture tells us I
[13:27] think it's in the 18th year right R of
[13:29] Nebuchadnezzar this is the first year of
[13:31] Nebuchadnezzar's rule when he pulls it
[13:33] out it's about the 18th year of his rule
[13:35] when he finally burns down the city of
[13:37] Jerusalem and and and and ruins the
[13:39] nation and and he carries away zedekiah
[13:42] but here in this first portion of this
[13:44] it's just a small amount of people are
[13:47] going to be pulled out of Jerusalem in
[13:49] an exile and taken over into Babylon now
[13:52] in that in that first little capture of
[13:54] people what happens is Nebuchadnezzar
[13:56] sets up this this King and he's going to
[13:59] rule the nation but he's going to do it
[14:01] under Nebuchadnezzar he's going to be
[14:03] under the rule and this this is what
[14:06] becomes a great problem in Israel or
[14:09] excuse me I call it Israel but it's
[14:10] Judah this is what's going to be a great
[14:12] problem in Judah because the kings of
[14:15] Judah want to do their own thing because
[14:18] whenever they served God they were
[14:20] Sovereign but now they have been placed
[14:22] under influences of other Realms and
[14:24] other people and even in their own
[14:27] Nation they're starting to experience
[14:28] slav y because that they did not follow
[14:32] the will of God so they're starting to
[14:34] fall under under now now they're still
[14:36] in their Nation now but they're under
[14:38] influences amen and and they can't help
[14:41] it they can't break it now if you uh
[14:43] like to read the Bible I'm going to skip
[14:44] ahead a little bit here but this is in
[14:47] in the stories of the scripture under
[14:49] the carrying away of is of Judah into
[14:52] Babylon that there is a king named
[14:54] zedekiah which is the one who follows
[14:57] this Jehovah him the king zedekiah which
[14:59] is a very puppet of Nebuchadnezzar
[15:02] himself but the scripture teaches us
[15:04] even he couldn't keep the rule of
[15:07] Nebuchadnezzar and he rebelled against
[15:08] him now if you like to read the message
[15:11] and you read your Bible you'll find out
[15:13] this is where the story amen of hananiah
[15:16] and and zedi comes up against Jeremiah
[15:19] y'all remember the story when Jeremiah
[15:21] comes in and prophesize remember he he's
[15:24] he comes into the into the king's
[15:26] Chambers and all the people are there
[15:27] and he's wearing a a a wooden yoke upon
[15:30] his neck and he comes in and prophesies
[15:32] that babylon's going to rule and the
[15:34] people will be under the rule of Babylon
[15:37] even in Israel and a false prophet then
[15:39] comes up and says to him Jeremiah this
[15:42] is not the word of the Lord but God
[15:44] spoke to me and he said that God will
[15:47] bust up this and he will break the Yoke
[15:49] of the bondage off the people and he
[15:51] reaches up and takes the Yoke off of the
[15:53] neck of Jeremiah and throws it on the
[15:55] floor and he said God's going to break
[15:57] it and when he did he began to prophesy
[16:00] that within 2 years all the people's
[16:02] going to be let go and here Daniel is
[16:05] prophesying to the people that because
[16:08] of the wickedness and the sins of the
[16:09] people you could have turned to the Lord
[16:12] he said but prophecy was saying 70 years
[16:15] God will have Judah down there in
[16:18] Babylon but because amen of this man
[16:21] kind of got caught up in the spirit you
[16:23] know he seen what was going to go well
[16:25] with the crowd so he just transitioned
[16:27] his sermon to m that's the popular thing
[16:30] to say at that time and actually come
[16:32] against a god anointed Prophet so that
[16:36] he could prophesy what would get a big
[16:37] amen from the church amen that just to
[16:39] be honest now he was one of them
[16:41] Prosperity preachers telling everybody
[16:43] America's going to stand America's going
[16:45] to go amen you can live in sin you can
[16:48] do anything go anywhere act any way and
[16:50] God bless America you know Amen in other
[16:53] words he was saying that God could bless
[16:55] Judah in its sin and I think it ought to
[16:57] be a great lesson this morning for every
[16:59] man for every child for every woman to
[17:01] realize amen that Israel was a nation
[17:05] amen that was anointed of God but God
[17:08] would not allow it to be blessed while
[17:10] it was in sin amen he rebuked it off of
[17:13] them sent true prophets unto them and
[17:16] the Bible said that they become learned
[17:18] in the way of evil and had no knowledge
[17:21] of good can you imagine that God's Own
[17:24] people now this is Abraham's people that
[17:27] had been Led Out of Babylon y'all
[17:30] remember Abraham was the father of
[17:32] Israel and Abraham had been called out
[17:35] of Babylon hundreds of years before this
[17:39] called out to make a nation unto himself
[17:41] now the nation children that Abraham had
[17:45] made is now turned to the gods of the
[17:49] world while they're in Israel and yet
[17:52] they're under the godship of other Idols
[17:55] now God took them out of Babylon for the
[17:59] purpose of building a nation where there
[18:00] was only one God but now in the nation
[18:04] where there was one God they have beg to
[18:06] incorporate the gods of other nations
[18:09] amen which teaches us that whenever that
[18:12] man turns to another God that God gives
[18:15] them over to the God they're serving as
[18:18] long as you desire to serve God he is a
[18:21] god of Grace a god of Mercy a god of
[18:23] blessing a god of reality but there is a
[18:27] a core rule with serving the god of
[18:29] Abraham hear ye oh Israel the Lord thy
[18:32] God is one and amen and there is only
[18:35] one God and he is a jealous God and he
[18:38] said that we cannot serve two Gods at
[18:40] the same time either we serve God or we
[18:42] serve man in other words it's it's not
[18:44] possible to serve our God and the god of
[18:47] the world at the same time because our
[18:49] God will not allow you to worship him
[18:52] while you're worshipping another God
[18:54] he's a jealous God amen amen I I could
[18:56] say it maybe so people really understand
[18:59] it it would be like it would be like
[19:00] that your wife decides to get two
[19:02] husbands well in my case my wife
[19:04] couldn't have two husbands because I
[19:05] would not be a second husband and our
[19:08] God says to you he will not be your
[19:10] second husband he he will not be the
[19:13] other guy he will not play the other
[19:15] fiddle either he'll be God or not God at
[19:17] all either he'll be your leader or Not
[19:20] Your Leader at all either you'll serve
[19:22] him with a single heart or you can have
[19:24] the gods that you desire but let me say
[19:26] this to you before you choose a another
[19:29] God you might already to check out the
[19:30] kind of God you're serving right now
[19:33] before you choose the God of this evil
[19:35] age you might understand that when you
[19:38] are sick in the bed that God is Not A
[19:40] Healer amen when you are troubled in
[19:42] your mind the God of this world is not a
[19:45] savior he is not a deliverer he is not a
[19:48] mighty God but he is the creator of hell
[19:51] he is the creator of confusion every
[19:54] Destruction has come from the lives of
[19:56] this enemy and amen the the scriptures
[19:59] teaches us God had brought them out of
[20:00] Babylon brought them amen into that land
[20:03] that they might serve God if you're
[20:06] sitting here this morning as a Christian
[20:08] and God has led the church out of
[20:10] denomination he's LED them away from
[20:12] these things he's LED you here so that
[20:15] you can serve god with a free heart my
[20:20] why would we ever want to be entangled
[20:22] again if God has led us out with a free
[20:25] heart now in the in the scripture here
[20:28] it's telling us that in the third year
[20:31] of course this is the first carrying
[20:33] away in the Book of Daniel it's the
[20:35] first carrying away of the children of
[20:38] Israel into
[20:39] Babylon amen I think about this because
[20:43] they would have walked the same Trail
[20:45] back that Abraham walked
[20:48] out can you imagine going the wrong way
[20:52] on that trail amen the trail that had
[20:55] brought them out of Babylon and brought
[20:58] them into into Judah now the children of
[21:01] Abraham years later have turned around
[21:04] and is walking backwards on the same
[21:06] trail that Abraham come out of they're
[21:09] going back to the place of confusion
[21:12] that Abraham had led them out of the god
[21:15] that had brought them out now the Israel
[21:17] is being returned to that land but
[21:19] listen now I think it's beautiful to
[21:21] remember this because the scripture says
[21:24] amen that they begin to take out the
[21:26] wise and they begin to take out them a
[21:28] good understanding so when
[21:29] Nebuchadnezzar went and took over over
[21:32] Judah what he done was took the he took
[21:34] the he he brain drained Judah he took
[21:38] the wise he took the spiritual he took
[21:40] the understanding and that's the people
[21:42] that he brought out so Daniel and the
[21:44] three Hebrew children brother Bram said
[21:46] they was a little bit like birds of a
[21:48] feather he said now these guys of course
[21:51] were True Believers amen but they were
[21:53] caught in the mix of being under evil
[21:56] leaders amen isn't it a amazing right
[21:59] here in this America now amen we escaped
[22:03] the religious persecution of the Roman
[22:05] church and we come out of Europe and
[22:08] cross the sea the Waters of Separation
[22:10] to come to America for the purpose of
[22:13] religious Liberties is that right and
[22:16] the Very Nation we are living in now was
[22:19] founded upon the Bible it was founded
[22:22] upon the principles of judaa a Jewish
[22:26] Christian Bible that's where our laws
[22:28] were written that's the way our Bill of
[22:30] Rights was established that's the way
[22:32] everything in our land was run up to a
[22:35] few hundred year to a few years ago
[22:37] everything was run that way our public
[22:39] schools had Bibles in them they had
[22:42] prayer in them amen our our nation was a
[22:45] nation amen that was blessed of God is
[22:47] that right amen it was a nation blessed
[22:50] of God but here we are this morning
[22:53] subject to evil leaders we're actually
[22:55] here but this nation is now subject to
[22:58] evil leaders now it wouldn't have evil
[23:01] leaders if the people didn't have evil
[23:04] Hearts but the leadership is now
[23:07] resembling what the people were and
[23:09] because they have lost their spiritual
[23:11] attitudes now whether you know it or not
[23:14] because of the elections that we've had
[23:17] because of the people that's in offices
[23:19] right now seven out of nine jurors
[23:22] sitting on the Supreme Court are Roman
[23:24] Catholic in their faith we ran from the
[23:27] Roman Church church out of Europe to
[23:29] this nation so we wouldn't be ruled by
[23:32] them and now they're setting in our
[23:33] Supreme Court our president right now is
[23:37] a Roman Catholic they have taken over
[23:40] this nation whether you like it or not
[23:42] you are now subject back under that
[23:45] thing again the Roman Church is taking
[23:48] over the politics of the United States
[23:50] of America and they never fired a shot
[23:53] they never had to kill nothing they
[23:55] never had to do anything people say well
[23:57] brother Wayne it ain't really that bad
[23:59] and let me say this yet it ain't that
[24:02] bad yet but it's in the place right now
[24:05] amen to begin to move in the Bible
[24:08] predicts the mark of the beast is going
[24:09] to come upon this nation come on now
[24:12] Jeremiah prophesied it to Judah and told
[24:15] him the whole thing is coming under
[24:16] judgment and if you want to escape the
[24:19] judgments get in the presence of God and
[24:22] that God has sent a prophet in this age
[24:25] and he said that you cannot worship God
[24:28] and the image of the beast at the same
[24:30] time if you're going to be a free man or
[24:33] a free woman you've got to get into
[24:35] Christ you got to get out of this
[24:38] National Spirit out of this idea and get
[24:41] into Christ my when I think about this I
[24:44] think about these young men and how that
[24:47] they're living they're living in a world
[24:50] under the influence of evil leadership
[24:52] even when they were in Judah these young
[24:55] people were having their kings and their
[24:57] leaders
[24:59] amen were were making choices for the
[25:02] nation and they were evil choices they
[25:05] were evil decisions amen now now can you
[25:09] imagine these boys really and honestly
[25:12] were already being prepped for Babylon
[25:15] amen because when they got to Babylon
[25:17] the scripture tells us when they got to
[25:20] Babylon the first thing that happens
[25:21] they got their names changed now I could
[25:24] I could go through the names here amen
[25:26] how many of you interested would you
[25:28] like to hear hear the change of the
[25:29] names or is that an interesting thing I
[25:32] I thought it was pretty I thought it was
[25:33] pretty amazing amen uh that the
[25:36] scripture says that they changed the
[25:38] names now Daniel chapter 1 and verse 6
[25:40] the Bible said now among them were the
[25:42] children of Judah Daniel hananiah
[25:44] Michelle and Azar and unto the prince of
[25:47] the Unix gave the names he unto them
[25:49] Daniel to the name Bel shazar now Daniel
[25:52] which is in Hebrew means God is my judge
[25:56] but the name they changed it Bazar in
[25:58] chal means the true Treasure of
[26:02] Baal the true Treasure of Baal they
[26:05] changed him from God as my judge to The
[26:08] Treasure of Baal in other words he was
[26:10] the depository of the secrets of Baal or
[26:14] the treasury of baale Amen now it's
[26:16] amazing because here the scripture says
[26:19] amen that they've changed his name of
[26:21] course it's trying to change identity
[26:23] right and to hananiah they changed his
[26:26] name amen which signified
[26:28] the Lord has been gracious to me or whom
[26:31] to the Lord has been gracious that which
[26:33] the word Lord is Jehovah and it was
[26:35] changed to Shadrach chaladi which means
[26:39] he has been verly translated he's the
[26:41] inspiration of the son God the author of
[26:44] evil to be prosperous let God Prosper Us
[26:47] from Evil it was uh serving of course
[26:50] the Babylonian Gods meach which means he
[26:53] comes from God they called him M meach
[26:57] which signifies
[26:59] Michelle signifies he who comes from God
[27:02] and they called him meach which means he
[27:04] who belongs to the goddess of shishak a
[27:08] celebrated deity of the Babylonians
[27:10] mentioned by Jeremiah Jeremiah
[27:12] 25:6 amen now the the last young man who
[27:15] took abedo was a Zari which signifies
[27:17] the Lord is my helper they changed it to
[27:20] abedo which is in the servant of Neo who
[27:23] was one of the divinities by which they
[27:25] meant either the Sun or the Morning Star
[27:27] the juper or Venice in other words they
[27:29] changed these boys' names they changed
[27:32] these boys clothing they changed these
[27:35] boys place that they lived amen and and
[27:39] they done everything they could do to
[27:41] make them fit into the nation that they
[27:44] had been brought into I I think it's a
[27:47] an amazing picture of the scripture of
[27:50] how that the children of God have been
[27:54] brought into a land who does not believe
[27:57] in their same God who who who who who
[27:59] look at the names they were carrying the
[28:02] the clothes that they were wearing
[28:04] everything about them represented
[28:06] something else now the scripture is
[28:07] going to say here amen that these young
[28:10] men their names has changed their
[28:12] clothes are changed everything are
[28:14] trying to be brought and the Lord had
[28:16] prevented uh had put them there of
[28:18] course by the hand of Providence but the
[28:21] scripture said the king had appointed
[28:23] them a daily provision of the king's
[28:25] meat so the king had decided that he was
[28:27] going to spend about a year on these
[28:29] guys and then they were going to get to
[28:31] come into the king's Chambers he
[28:33] appointed a man over them to feed them
[28:35] and to nourish them until the time they
[28:37] would come in the presence of the king
[28:39] of Babylon but the Bible reads here and
[28:41] I this is really where I want to get in
[28:43] the seventh verse unto the prince of the
[28:45] Uno he gave the name and he gave unto
[28:47] Daniel the name of el chazar but Daniel
[28:50] in the eth verse purposed in his heart
[28:53] that he would not defile himself with a
[28:56] portion of the king's meat nor with the
[28:58] wine which he drank therefore he
[29:00] requested of the princes and the Unix
[29:02] that he might not defile himself now
[29:05] here is a man who is living in a place
[29:08] where everything that he believes is not
[29:12] is not even regarded there's nothing
[29:14] about Daniel's life that is regarded by
[29:17] the people who is in control he is in a
[29:20] person he is a he's a man who's living
[29:24] in an evil time in an evil place in an
[29:26] evil world I tell you what a prophet
[29:28] said he said he had no church to go
[29:31] to he had no Fellowship he had no songs
[29:35] to sing he had nobody to have the Bible
[29:38] studies with he had no fellowship of
[29:40] other believers amen but this man
[29:43] refused to defile his character that God
[29:47] gave him listen friend I I think that
[29:50] one verse ought to ReSound in every
[29:52] heart of every believer today we've got
[29:54] a beautiful Church to come to this
[29:56] morning how many appreciates the church
[29:58] church amen how many really how many
[30:00] appreciates the
[30:02] church
[30:04] sure isn't it beautiful to have a place
[30:06] to come where other people believe how
[30:08] many appreciates a pastor that teaches
[30:10] the message of the hour so you know had
[30:13] to come and and try to decipher through
[30:16] these things but a true prophecy in a
[30:18] true Place listen and and hear your
[30:21] setting with the baptism of the Holy
[30:23] Ghost sitting in a good church with a
[30:25] good Ministry preaching the word and you
[30:28] see how difficult it is at times to
[30:30] remain the identity of a Christian in a
[30:33] bad situation amen but let me say this
[30:36] to you Daniel ought to be the courage to
[30:38] every believer sitting in here that no
[30:40] matter the situation you're in no matter
[30:43] the place you find yourself in Daniel
[30:45] purposed in his heart that he would not
[30:48] defile his relationship with God my when
[30:52] I think about it like this Daniel had
[30:54] nothing left he had no home left he had
[30:57] no family left he had no Heritage left
[31:00] everything about Daniel his own name was
[31:02] gone but there was something in the
[31:05] man's heart that you could not take away
[31:07] from him and let me say this morning I
[31:09] believe amen that as Daniel was an alien
[31:13] in a strange world so are we an alien in
[31:16] a strange world and brother one thing's
[31:19] for sure we might be a long ways from a
[31:22] Heavenly home but you will never change
[31:24] the heart of a True Believer because
[31:27] they had purpose purposed in their heart
[31:29] man when I think about a man purposing
[31:31] in his heart in other words you don't
[31:33] live this life on
[31:35] accident you're going to have to purpose
[31:37] in your heart to be different you're
[31:39] going to have to purpose in your heart
[31:41] where you're living is going to be
[31:43] different amen I I I I know some of you
[31:46] live in homes with unbelievers but you
[31:48] got a purpose in your heart that the
[31:51] atmosphere you're in is not going to
[31:53] change who you are you work in
[31:55] situations come on now some of you
[31:58] atmospheres amen I've been there I've
[31:59] stood in the factory and heard the dirty
[32:01] jokes and all those things amen but in
[32:04] my heart amen I I I have to be honest
[32:06] with you I wouldn't laugh at it I
[32:08] wouldn't laugh at their jokes I wouldn't
[32:10] cut up with all that that filth and
[32:12] nonsense amen amen after a while most
[32:15] people end up calling me preacher didn't
[32:16] even know I was a preacher but amen
[32:18] because I wouldn't join into their into
[32:20] the politics and and the nonsense you
[32:22] don't have to be a politician to work
[32:24] somewhere you don't have to go home with
[32:27] them amen and have supper every night we
[32:30] are not here to be the friend of the
[32:32] world we are here to be Servants of God
[32:35] and to be different than the world that
[32:37] we're living in you're a testimony to
[32:40] this entire nation that God still has a
[32:42] Daniel God still has somebody who's
[32:45] willing to purpose in their heart I will
[32:48] not defile
[32:53] myself a we might as well preach in the
[32:56] house of God this morning I believe
[32:58] there's some Daniels that's in the world
[33:00] we're in now you said preacher my name
[33:02] ain't Daniel that's all right whether it
[33:04] is or whether it ain't but I'll tell you
[33:06] this Amen brother randam says it like
[33:08] this Daniel purposed in his heart though
[33:10] he become a citizen there amen but it
[33:13] wasn't by choice because he was an alien
[33:16] and every born again Christian is an
[33:18] alien as soon as he's born again because
[33:21] he's Heavenly bound his possessions lay
[33:24] in heaven we may not be amen we may not
[33:28] be a an Israelite living in Babylon but
[33:31] we're a Christian Living in
[33:34] America and we're just as much alien
[33:36] here as Daniel was there amen but Daniel
[33:40] didn't have a church Daniel didn't have
[33:42] worship Services Daniel didn't have
[33:44] preaching every week but the purpose in
[33:46] Daniel's heart was so powerful that
[33:49] without the Holy Ghost he lived a clean
[33:52] life without the Holy Ghost he remained
[33:55] impure unto his God what's The Testament
[33:58] too that the Holy Ghost filled Church of
[34:01] the Living God there's going to be
[34:03] somebody in the day that we're living in
[34:05] that's going to live clean they're going
[34:07] to separate their lives they're going to
[34:10] come away from this world and be an
[34:12] alien and be an alien amen we are we are
[34:16] aliens amen living a separated life
[34:19] Daniel purposed in his heart you're not
[34:21] going to do this on
[34:25] accident now I I'm not I'm not teaching
[34:28] this from from from without experience
[34:30] i' I've been right where you're standing
[34:32] in your jobs I remember I was an
[34:34] inspector for a city and there was about
[34:36] four or five of us went on a trip we all
[34:38] had to go
[34:39] somewhere we had to go to this school
[34:41] these other guys went with us and we
[34:43] while we're on the while we're on the
[34:44] way we stop at this little restaurant
[34:46] and we go up there and there's four of
[34:48] us standing at the front door and we go
[34:50] out and we're going to have to wait 30
[34:51] or 40 minutes and the guy says to us
[34:53] would you like to wait at the
[34:56] bar every one of the guys I was with
[34:58] said yeah just give us a seat at the bar
[34:59] we'll have a drink while we wait and
[35:01] they all turned around looked at
[35:03] me I said I ain't been on a bar store in
[35:06] 20 years and you ain't going to put me
[35:08] on here waiting for no food
[35:10] either they all turned around and looked
[35:12] at me and they said no it's all right
[35:13] we'll
[35:15] wait you you see amen if I would have
[35:19] just folded we'd all been sitting on the
[35:21] bar stool but when I decided I will not
[35:25] defile myself sitting on that bar stool
[35:28] then that Church of Christ song leader
[35:30] that was with me who was ready to go
[35:31] over there and sit and drink wine with
[35:33] the rest of them decided you know what
[35:35] that's right we shouldn't be doing that
[35:36] do you know sometimes all the crowd
[35:38] needs is one guy to stand up and say
[35:40] what's right they just need one one
[35:43] person to give a little courage to a
[35:45] situation amen that things are right I
[35:47] don't think we ought to always look for
[35:49] an example sometimes we ought to be the
[35:52] example sometimes we don't have to have
[35:54] leadership we ought to be the leader in
[35:56] the crowd we are to say it's wrong I
[35:59] ain't going there I ain't doing that
[36:01] that's not the way we do things in the
[36:04] Church of the Living God come on church
[36:06] I think God is still looking for some
[36:08] Daniels he's looking for some leaders
[36:10] from some men of God who's ready to say
[36:13] I will not defile
[36:16] myself he purposed in his heart now when
[36:19] a it's teaching me something that when a
[36:21] true Christian purposes something in
[36:23] their heart that that purpose is real
[36:25] and it'll hold them it'll hold them
[36:28] against every situation amen they were
[36:30] there it wasn't their choice they were
[36:32] there but they were aliens in another
[36:35] land brother bam said he he said here's
[36:37] some time ago my wife and I and brother
[36:40] Mercer he said we went down to the city
[36:42] center he said there's a bunch of
[36:43] religious people he said but we seen
[36:45] some woman had a skirt on one of the
[36:48] strangest things CU now the rest of them
[36:50] seem to have one on and now we have many
[36:53] of the choirs and everything else see
[36:55] women and choirs and church members and
[36:57] everything else and you're down in town
[36:59] and nobody's wearing a skirt well just
[37:00] go around and ask a few of them they go
[37:02] to church yeah yeah I go down here to
[37:04] this Baptist or I I go over here to this
[37:06] Methodist I go over here do something
[37:07] amen now you think about that how in the
[37:10] world can people testify as Christians
[37:13] and and dress just like the world we're
[37:16] in in so much you can't even tell the
[37:19] difference between the world and the
[37:21] church it's a it's a truth brother B
[37:23] said his wife actually actually said
[37:26] something about it and she said well she
[37:28] says she said my wife said well said uh
[37:30] you see they're they're not of our
[37:33] citizenship amen because the wife's
[37:35] asking him brother brother brandom now
[37:37] why is it that that that these girls are
[37:39] wearing these kind of clothes and acting
[37:41] like this and you're asking the church
[37:44] to go this other direction and brother
[37:46] Bram said because we're not the same
[37:47] we're not of the same citizenship and
[37:50] she said yeah but but we're all
[37:51] Americans and brother R said we're not
[37:54] Americans that's beautiful isn't it but
[37:56] we're not Americans you said we are
[37:58] Americans well we are Americans
[38:00] naturally but see America has a
[38:03] spirit and that spirit is the spirit of
[38:06] Le oysa that's the kind of spirit that's
[38:08] on America the American Spirit y'all
[38:11] y'all know what I'm saying amen look at
[38:13] the immorality look at the ungodliness
[38:15] that sets upon the land it's the
[38:17] American Spirit now a child that's been
[38:20] born of God is don't have an American
[38:24] Spirit they have received another spirit
[38:27] they come from another place they have
[38:30] another kind of citizenship they are the
[38:33] sons and daughters of God we are not
[38:36] just American Born we are Heavenly born
[38:39] you were born with a spirit water blood
[38:41] and spirit from your mother's womb that
[38:43] was your first birth which made you an
[38:45] American but by the grace of God we've
[38:48] been given another birth we have been
[38:50] given another Spirit we have been given
[38:52] another dispensation within our beings
[38:55] we have become citizens of of another
[38:57] kingdom with another set of laws with
[39:00] another set of realities now I I I I
[39:03] want I want to say this brother bam said
[39:05] it like this he says see he said but
[39:07] well uh honey you see each Nation lives
[39:10] on the spirit of the nation and it's a
[39:12] national Spirit he said well then we
[39:15] would be living on an American spiry but
[39:17] we're born again we live on a Heavenly
[39:19] spirit with Holiness and righteousness
[39:22] we're not Americans as far as it goes
[39:24] because America is just an Earthly
[39:26] Nation but when a man in Germany or
[39:28] Switzerland or wherever he may be when
[39:30] he becomes heaven born he takes a
[39:33] Heavenly
[39:34] spirit and his nature and his makeup
[39:38] look for things above where Christ set
[39:41] at the right hand how we ought to
[39:42] remember that that he died that we might
[39:45] be able to be fortified from the thing
[39:48] inoculated from
[39:50] it so Daniel was literally an alien in
[39:55] another world which is representing you
[39:58] living here as an alien of another world
[40:02] isn't it something amen that the way
[40:05] people had beg to drift in this nation
[40:07] now let's just say something very very
[40:10] carefully here because when Daniel was
[40:12] in the court of the king the king's meat
[40:15] the king's ways the king's prop that was
[40:18] the thing to do it it it wasn't the
[40:22] people that were eating that meat and
[40:24] they were going that way it wasn't
[40:26] withstanding nothing
[40:28] it was the king's meat who wouldn't who
[40:30] wouldn't in all the land of Babylon who
[40:32] wouldn't have enjoyed to go into the
[40:34] king's Chambers and eat the same
[40:37] portions that a king ate every day am me
[40:41] the the the the the the the trainers of
[40:44] Daniel must have looked at him and said
[40:45] what's the matter with
[40:46] you this is the same food we fed the
[40:49] king this morning and you're saying it
[40:51] is a defilement to you amen you you see
[40:55] the man amen called what they thought
[40:58] was the best in the land a defilement to
[41:01] him what the best the world had to offer
[41:06] was a defilement to the soul of Daniel
[41:10] now amen it was the thing to do and and
[41:13] and I'll say it like this I don't really
[41:15] mean for this to be a negative sermon so
[41:16] let's not turn it negative okay amen
[41:19] look look at what's happened here amen
[41:20] that that the soul of Daniel is going to
[41:23] be defiled by partaking of this but it
[41:25] is the thing to do so I think we could
[41:27] learn a lesson as a church that just
[41:30] because something is legal don't make it
[41:33] right now that's a big statement is it
[41:35] just because it's legal don't make it
[41:37] right is that right because what you
[41:40] have to remember is originally the laws
[41:43] of America was based on the Bible but
[41:47] watch what happens as the moral decay of
[41:49] a Nation takes place the laws are
[41:53] constantly changing with the nation the
[41:56] laws listen there was a a time that
[41:58] whiskey was outlawed in this
[42:01] America I come up in in Northern
[42:03] Arkansas you had to drive an hour and a
[42:06] half in any direction to find a liquor
[42:07] store because it was a dry county after
[42:10] dry county because some of the churches
[42:12] had got together and had bought up all
[42:14] the liquor license that was pretty smart
[42:17] of them wasn't it it was only like I I
[42:19] worked in the city Jonesboro I think
[42:21] there was five or six liquor license and
[42:22] you look it up I think three or four of
[42:24] them belong to the First Baptist
[42:26] Church they bought the liquor license to
[42:28] keep them from building bars in the
[42:30] cities they they were doing their best
[42:32] right there in Northern AR all keep all
[42:34] the liquor out of the church out of the
[42:36] people see because watch but after the
[42:38] people wanted liquor after a while they
[42:41] made it legal and now look at the damage
[42:44] that is done unto the nation that we're
[42:46] living in look at the look at the homes
[42:49] this morning that have been wrecked by
[42:51] whiskey and beer and alcohol Good Men
[42:54] started out with just a little social
[42:56] drink you know just a little little
[42:58] whine for the stomach's sake and I'm
[43:00] sorry I guess I'm just going to have to
[43:01] preach but but they start out with just
[43:03] a little whine and even right here in
[43:05] the message of the hour people starting
[43:07] to backslide that think it's okay to sit
[43:10] down and oh I felt that one amen they
[43:12] sit down and think it's okay just to
[43:14] drink a little wine let me let me let me
[43:16] prophesy something to you that wine is
[43:19] going to turn to something a little
[43:20] better and it's going to get a little
[43:22] more often and after a little while amen
[43:24] you're going to be you're going to be
[43:26] embarrassed by your natural habits that
[43:29] have taken away the joy of the Lord out
[43:31] of your life because if you want to
[43:33] drink
[43:35] wine if you want to drink wine come to
[43:38] the house of God and don't sit on the on
[43:40] the Pew like a bump on the log get into
[43:43] the word of God and let it turn to
[43:45] stimulated power you can get drunk in
[43:48] the house of God and satisfy your desire
[43:51] to drink wine you can drink till every
[43:53] nervousness is gone until every
[43:56] confusion leaves your mind we do not
[43:59] have to partake of the tables of the
[44:02] wines of this world to rejoice in the in
[44:05] the in the presence of the wine of
[44:07] God come on Church you know God has a
[44:10] way to give you everything the king
[44:13] wanted to give you his way we got
[44:15] another king and he gives you everything
[44:18] that you need through his
[44:21] word he said prove it in the Bible amen
[44:24] Daniel talked him into a 10day trial
[44:28] he said this just don't give it to me
[44:30] and you feed me water and pulk for 10
[44:31] days and see if I don't Prosper just as
[44:33] well as them that's defiling
[44:36] theirselves other words whatever you
[44:38] think the king's meat's going to do for
[44:40] them give me pul and water and my God
[44:42] will do for me supernaturally what
[44:44] they're going to get in the natural amen
[44:46] let me tell you you never turned down
[44:48] nothing from the devil and suffered amen
[44:50] a loss in your life because God will
[44:53] prosper a man that will sanctify his
[44:56] life to the things of
[44:58] God ah we might as well get it I I guess
[45:00] I ain't done amen but I found out that
[45:03] we we got message people now sitting at
[45:05] their dinner tables drinking wine amen
[45:08] like the world
[45:10] does oh see brother Ray I guess we just

[45:16] ain't got that we ain't got that high in
[45:17] life yet I pray I never get that
[45:20] high I pray I never get so up that I can
[45:23] turn my nose away from a thing that a
[45:25] prophet of God said and drink make a
[45:27] bunch of wine at a dinner table and
[45:29] influence my children against the things
[45:31] that a prophet of God taught brother
[45:33] Bram said he was a Nazarite from his
[45:35] birth don't never drink don't never
[45:37] smoke don't never touch the thing are
[45:39] you with me and every son or daughter of
[45:42] God that has been born of the Holy Ghost
[45:44] is a Nazarite in its vow and you got no
[45:48] right to the things of the world you

[46:20] devil it's ruined homes it's ruined
[46:24] lives and it's ruining you it's
[46:26] marrowing your
[46:30] conscience said preacher what in the
[46:32] world are you doing the Bible said
[46:33] Jeremiah prophesied against
[46:37] them now I read my Bible and it said had
[46:40] the people hearkened to Jeremiah the
[46:43] city wouldn't been destroyed but because
[46:46] there was some false preachers the Bible
[46:49] says it they were false preachers and
[46:51] prophesied the popularity and they
[46:53] wouldn't come against the devil and
[46:55] since they wouldn't do it the people
[46:57] amen crucified Jeremiah for preaching
[47:00] the way he preached and they followed
[47:02] the lies of the devil but watch what
[47:04] happens in a few short
[47:07] years zedekiah was the king remember
[47:10] zedekiah was the king that Jeremiah
[47:12] prophesied to do you know zedekiah amen
[47:15] was taken
[47:17] captive this is a good reading zedekiah
[47:20] was taken captive do you know that he
[47:22] watched his sons die he watched his
[47:25] kingdom burn to the ground
[47:27] and was put in Chains and they didn't
[47:29] kill him to last they put out his eyes
[47:32] but they didn't put out his eyes before
[47:34] he could see his kingdom burn before he
[47:36] could see his sons die amen they made
[47:39] him watch the path of his destruction
[47:42] and the old devil is so cruel if you
[47:44] serveing he'll let you live long enough
[47:47] to see your family destroyed to see your
[47:50] life destroyed that Devil is a devil and
[47:53] he's out to destroy you but God has come
[47:56] that you may have life and may have it
[47:58] more
[48:02] abundantly well in case you're wondering
[48:04] where I'm at yes it's wrong for a family
[48:06] to sit around a table and
[48:08] drink it's wrong for a mom and daddy to
[48:11] sit around a table and
[48:13] drink there's a lot of dads in here
[48:15] don't have much respect from the oh my
[48:19] goodness can I preach there some fathers
[48:22] that don't have much respect out of
[48:23] their homes and they're wondering I got
[48:25] to beat my wife and submiss if you would
[48:27] live a clean life in front of that woman
[48:29] she would respect your life and she
[48:31] would respect you but how can you cause
[48:35] a woman to respect you when you live
[48:37] like a
[48:38] pig you live like a hog you're not a hog
[48:42] you're a Son of God you're a daughter of
[48:45] God come on up out of that thing this
[48:47] morning and let the presence of God come
[48:50] into your life I have I have purposed in
[48:53] my heart I will not defile myself with

[49:09] fanatical preacher amen but up in heaven
[49:12] the things that I believe they believe
[49:15] up there from my homeland this is the
[49:18] word of the
[49:19] Lord may not be the law of America but
[49:22] it's the law in
[49:25] heaven
[49:27] oh
[49:29] my is it odd how the Holy Spirit goes by
[49:32] and picks things up just cuz they
[49:34] legalized that dop that marijuana don't
[49:36] mean you ought to smoke
[49:39] it

[49:51] devil it was of the devil when it
[49:53] started and it's of the devil when it's
[49:55] end and no matter how much this
[49:57] godforsaken nation says it's right it'll
[50:00] be wrong it's destroyed homes and lives
[50:02] and minds and it'll destroy your home
[50:05] your life your
[50:07] mind it'll destroy your
[50:11] soul you know why they've legalized it
[50:13] you want me to tell you the truth you
[50:14] want to tell you why they legalized it
[50:16] why they're legalizing it is because the
[50:19] people are so sinful in their lives
[50:21] their souls are tore up and they can't
[50:23] get any peace so they're doing their
[50:25] best to drink peace in them to smoke
[50:27] peace in them to bring something in them
[50:29] but Jesus said yet a little while and
[50:32] the world will see me no more but you
[50:34] shall see me for I will be with you even
[50:36] in you I will not leave you comfortless
[50:39] but I will come to you he is my comfort
[50:43] he is my peace he is my reward he is my
[50:46] life I'm not lacking this morning I've

[52:17] Traditions have so influenced their
[52:19] weddings that they can't tell the
[52:21] difference between Christian weddings

[52:24] religion but the pastors in India when I
[52:27] come there ask me the silliest questions
[52:29] like how to perform a wedding I'm
[52:30] thinking You' already know how to do a
[52:32] wedding it's

[55:46] of
[55:48] God well I tell you brother Wayne I want
[55:50] to see things so they take that dope
[55:53] it's hucog enic right well have you ever
[55:55] read the Bible
[55:57] where the prophets were lifted up and
[55:59] they saw 3 or 4,000 years and and 2,000
[56:02] years in the future and in the past but
[56:04] it wasn't they wasn't hallucinating
[56:06] false
[56:07] things they were seeing real things
[56:10] because a real high gives you real
[56:12] reality and a real picture of the future
[56:15] amen but a false High gives you a false
[56:17] huci in it it makes you see things in an
[56:20] altered state and you believe you're
[56:22] right when you're wrong but by the grace
[56:25] of God that your purpose in his heart I
[56:28] will live a separated life no matter
[56:29] where you put me no matter what happens
[56:31] in my life I will not defile
[56:37] myself said brother Wayne but everybody
[56:40] around

[56:51] yourself
[56:55] there listen when I worked the line at a
[56:58] factory they all knew I was a
[57:01] Believer when I roll a survey truck and
[57:04] four of them guys come crawling in every
[57:06] one of them smell like whiskey from the
[57:07] night before big old Burly dirty filthy

[57:32] be arrogant his old boy big enough to
[57:34] whip me and you and three or four more
[57:36] of us he looked over at me and he said
[57:39] said something to me one day and I said

[57:53] can't keep me from it great big old guy
[57:56] you know I said well just go and tell it
[57:59] then and he started telling it I stuck
[58:01] both fingers in my ears and I
[58:03] went yeah
[58:08] yeah he he got on the floor laughing at
[58:11] me cuz it's the only way I could keep
[58:13] from hearing that filthy joke he was
[58:15] about to tell me but I didn't have to
[58:17] fight with him he respected me from that
[58:19] day on I wasn't being arrogant I just
[58:22] didn't want to be defiled you don't have
[58:25] to be mean and AR am but you got to set
[58:27] your heart I will not be defiled I will
[58:30] not live like this world lives I will
[58:33] not be the way they are and there are
[58:35] some people in this
[58:36] land that's like
[58:39] Daniel you know that the scripture tells
[58:42] us of a of a girl taken slave who was
[58:44] from Israel and went to non's house
[58:46] another great leader but was a Syrian do
[58:48] you know that girl had such a testimony
[58:51] with God she was a slave in the house of
[58:54] the Syrian of the Syrian Chief who was a
[58:57] who was a a
[58:59] leper but her atmosphere was so set
[59:02] apart until she told the leper by
[59:06] inspiration if You' go down to to Israel
[59:10] we got a prophet in the land down there
[59:12] and you could be healed look at her
[59:14] testimony she never lost it even when
[59:16] she was a slave she never lost the
[59:19] reality of the God she was serving and
[59:22] her a slave in Syria was in better shape
[59:25] than the king that was in Israel
[59:27] yeah so how do you get to that cuz when
[59:30] the nonon went first thing they done was
[59:33] send him to the king and the King ripped
[59:35] his garments and said I don't know how
[59:36] we're going to help you that's right a
[59:39] king living in a country with Elijah and
[59:41] didn't know how to help
[59:44] them but that little girl knew she knew
[59:48] if you get in the presence of that
[59:49] Prophet God will change you see she set
[59:52] her testimony apart even though she was
[59:55] a Play Amen I I I don't believe you
[59:58] ought to have to push on people be mean
[59:59] to people but you ought to keep your
[1:00:01] testimony you are to you are to testify
[1:00:04] for this word somebody's sick around you
[1:00:07] amen if you knew of a if you knew of a
[1:00:09] peel that would heal somebody of
[1:00:12] cancer now now y'all know I'm telling
[1:00:15] you the truth cuz we got so many of them
[1:00:16] essential essential oil salesman Among
[1:00:18] Us
[1:00:19] now that they if if they think an oil
[1:00:22] might help you you cannot have lunch
[1:00:25] with somebody without about them telling
[1:00:26] you 42
[1:00:28] times of what that oil can do for you
[1:00:32] I'll tell you what it does for me it
[1:00:32] keeps me up all night cuz it
[1:00:36] stinks I mean it really
[1:00:40] stinks but if somebody thinks it works
[1:00:43] they'll go around
[1:00:46] stinking can you imagine
[1:00:50] go y'all know it's
[1:00:52] true y'all know it's true you do not
[1:00:55] have to ask who wears essential
[1:01:01] oil but
[1:01:05] because but because that they think it
[1:01:09] works they're willing to wear stink on
[1:01:15] them it's the truth you know it's
[1:01:18] true it does not smell like
[1:01:21] perfume if they ever get anything
[1:01:23] scented like good cologne maybe I might
[1:01:25] try
[1:01:30] if it worked for one person one time
[1:01:33] they sell it around the world but this
[1:01:36] gospel has worked for person after
[1:01:39] person after person after person and
[1:01:42] because people are afraid of a little
[1:01:44] rebuke or a little bit of somebody
[1:01:46] turning their nose they'll hold silent
[1:01:49] in a crowd when they are to tell
[1:01:52] somebody Jesus loves
[1:01:54] you Jesus saves you Jesus heals you you
[1:01:59] don't have to break the whole message
[1:02:01] but tell them there's hope somewhere
[1:02:03] there's a God somewhere he changes lives
[1:02:06] he changes situations he changes
[1:02:10] hope listen I I believe this morning
[1:02:13] that we ought to like these men purpose
[1:02:15] in our
[1:02:17] heart
[1:02:19] aliens he said well brother Wayne if I
[1:02:21] if I had a job where I didn't have to
[1:02:23] interact with
[1:02:24] nobody this man lived in
[1:02:27] Babylon not a church no Fellowship no
[1:02:32] songs no Holy Ghost and kept his
[1:02:37] testimony brother brandham likened him
[1:02:40] to a slave from Africa that was brought
[1:02:43] into America and he said one day a slave
[1:02:46] buyer went byy slaves and he went down
[1:02:47] to a slave Farm where they had the
[1:02:49] slaves and he said he was looking over
[1:02:51] the field like you want to buy a used
[1:02:53] car it was a shame that he did it but
[1:02:56] but it's a story he looked over and he
[1:02:58] seen one slave who was different than
[1:03:00] all of them said I want to buy that
[1:03:03] one he said I Ain for
[1:03:07] sale do you see the only one of them
[1:03:09] that was worth anything was the one that
[1:03:11] was
[1:03:14] different the one that was different was
[1:03:17] the one that they wanted to
[1:03:19] get why do you think the world's working
[1:03:22] on
[1:03:23] you cuz you're the only thing
[1:03:26] different you're the only thing with
[1:03:28] value everything else is
[1:03:30] marred everything else is
[1:03:34] defiled brother said they looked at that
[1:03:36] man said I want to buy him he said you
[1:03:37] can't buy him he's not for
[1:03:40] sale oh how I've had to tell the devil
[1:03:43] many
[1:03:45] times I'm not for
[1:03:49] sale I've already been bought and
[1:03:53] sold I belong to Jesus Christ
[1:03:56] and none
[1:03:59] other so what's different about him do
[1:04:01] you feed him something different no e
[1:04:05] like the rest of them oh I got you got
[1:04:08] him a special quarters he lives in
[1:04:12] nope y'all give him special treatment
[1:04:15] nope he's the same as everybody else he
[1:04:19] said well when what makes him different
[1:04:21] he said well I wondered that same thing
[1:04:22] myself so I asked one day and they they
[1:04:25] said the thing that makes this man
[1:04:27] different is the land where he is
[1:04:30] from that he is the King's
[1:04:34] son and even though he is in a nation
[1:04:38] and probably will never see his home
[1:04:41] again think about that he's never going
[1:04:45] to see that home again but he still knew
[1:04:47] he was a King's son so he conducted
[1:04:50] himself like the son of a king no matter
[1:04:52] what situation he was put into
[1:04:56] and the prophet of God said this he said
[1:04:58] think of this he did that knowing he
[1:05:00] would never see his home again he said
[1:05:03] but as the Sons and Daughters of God he
[1:05:06] said we know that it won't be very long
[1:05:09] until we're going to return to our
[1:05:11] homeland we're going back to where we
[1:05:13] come from we're going back to our home
[1:05:16] we may be aliens here we may be
[1:05:19] different here but brother get us up in
[1:05:21] heaven one time they believe what we
[1:05:24] believe up there they think what we
[1:05:26] think up
[1:05:28] there y'all remember when brother
[1:05:30] Brandon went beyond the curtain of time
[1:05:32] remember amen not in 1960 but previous
[1:05:35] when his daughter had died and his and
[1:05:37] his wife had died and he was right there
[1:05:39] to that place of losing his mind and he
[1:05:41] was in such a nervousness he was praying
[1:05:43] and the Lord took him into that other
[1:05:45] realm and he said when he got over there
[1:05:47] remember a young girl walked up to him
[1:05:49] and started talking to him and he said
[1:05:52] he said now who are you she said I was
[1:05:55] your shepher and Rose on the
[1:05:57] earth and he looked at said but you were
[1:06:00] just a baby she said but Daddy don't you
[1:06:02] remember your teaching on
[1:06:05] immortality that girl was a baby when
[1:06:08] she died she had no clue what William
[1:06:11] brandom taught on
[1:06:13] immortality but up there in heaven
[1:06:15] everybody knows this message is
[1:06:19] right up there in heaven this message is
[1:06:23] right it might not be right in the
[1:06:24] church it might not be right in the
[1:06:26] denomination or in this America but up
[1:06:29] in heaven this message is right
[1:06:32] everybody knows the teaching on
[1:06:34] immortality up there everybody knows you
[1:06:36] got a theophany up there because it's
[1:06:39] the message of the hour I I pray this
[1:06:42] morning won't you stand and join me I
[1:06:44] will not defile myself with this
[1:06:48] world matter if our musicians would come
[1:06:50] this morning won't you won't you take a
[1:06:53] moment and just say right here this
[1:06:56] morning I will not defile myself I might
[1:06:59] be an
[1:07:01] alien but I'm
[1:07:03] Different not just because I want to be
[1:07:06] different I'm a child of a
[1:07:10] king I'm a stranger
[1:07:13] here I've got a lot of scripture I'm
[1:07:16] sorry I don't have time to get to all of
[1:07:17] it but but I think you got my
[1:07:21] point we're
[1:07:23] different in the book of HEB Hebrews it
[1:07:26] said that Abraham left his country
[1:07:28] Babylon and went and sought a city whose
[1:07:31] Builder and maker was God isn't that
[1:07:34] something he said had he had a heart to
[1:07:36] return he could have but he had no
[1:07:39] desire to
[1:07:41] return he left that country as a pilgrim
[1:07:45] and a stranger to serve his God but I
[1:07:48] want you to think about
[1:07:50] something Abraham had developed a
[1:07:53] seed in that land a family
[1:07:56] that God had called him out of Babylon
[1:07:58] into Israel and he had so developed a
[1:08:01] family that when even his when his pure
[1:08:05] seed returned back to the land of
[1:08:08] Babylon in the midst of all those gods
[1:08:11] in the midst of all those confusions
[1:08:13] they still couldn't defile that
[1:08:16] seed because it was an
[1:08:19] undefiable
[1:08:21] Incorruptible seed of the Living God and
[1:08:24] I believe this morning there the Church
[1:08:26] of the Living God is of the same Seed of
[1:08:28] Abraham undefiled uncorruptable
[1:08:32] seed of God I know we're just strangers
[1:08:37] here but we're seeking a city to come
[1:08:40] let's just bow our hearts this morning
[1:08:43] gracious
[1:08:45] Lord father I pray this morning that the
[1:08:48] word has spoken to a
[1:08:52] need Lord I pray this morning that the
[1:08:55] things that have been spoken to the
[1:08:57] church would be a help to aive
[1:09:01] somebody
[1:09:03] father we're not here in a negative this
[1:09:06] morning we're here in a positive truth
[1:09:10] that there was a man who lived thousands
[1:09:13] of years
[1:09:14] ago who came to inspire the church in
[1:09:17] this last
[1:09:18] day that just because you live in a
[1:09:21] world of ungodliness does not mean that
[1:09:24] you have to become
[1:09:26] ungodly the morals of this nation have
[1:09:30] drifted the laws of this nation has
[1:09:32] followed
[1:09:34] it but Lord we got another law we live
[1:09:37] by we live by Your Word now we ask you
[1:09:41] this morning that you would see our
[1:09:42] hands as we lift them to
[1:09:45] you God keep
[1:09:48] us keep us with your keeping power as
[1:09:52] you kept Daniel
[1:09:54] Lord help us to purpose in our heart
[1:09:56] this morning that we will not drift with
[1:09:58] this age that we're in
[1:10:00] Lord now father we thank you for your
[1:10:04] power your spirit now in the name of
[1:10:07] Jesus Christ we
[1:10:12] pray amen Amen brother Ben you got
