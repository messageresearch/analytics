good to be back home home we had a good fellowship with brother men Fen uh up in Saskatoon there had some tremendous meetings it's been a long time since they had meetings up there and brother Ron and Timothy PR were right in front of me there at brother Kelly hilderbrand and uh so Saskatoon had a Revival one weekend and then they moved it to brother mental freezing the next weekend and we had quite a time uh fellowshipping with them all and then down to brother Tim puits for the weekend and by the Lord sure was merciful there and gave us a real Grace amen amen so we just want to say God bless you thank you for your prayer amen and this morning we just have a few things Upon Our Hearts so if we just bow our hearts in a word of prayer before we read the scripture this morning amen we just like to approach the Lord Heavenly Father Lord there's one thing that we've understood Through The Years Lord that no man can open the scripture and no man can make it bring an understanding but you're God and Lord you you're a merciful god to open our understanding to bring an Enlightenment Lord and we ask you this morning Lord that while we read your word that father you would bring the understanding May the spirit of wisdom and Revelation Lord may it enter our heart and strengthen us Lord in this late hour May father we be ready for such a time as we live and we ask ask you this morning now may you give us the grace Lord to speak on these things and may you bring the inspiration Lord with in which they were written father we ask you now to lead us in your word in Jesus name we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bible to the Book of Daniel uh the 9th chapter I want to look this morning Daniel chapter 9 we're going to look in the first two verses um I was actually been praying about how to continue in This Book of Daniel if we would continue further or what but I I felt to at least to to bring this last portion here there's um three tapes brother bandam preaches in Daniel chapter n uh he'll preach on Gabriel's instructions to Daniel six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel and also Daniel's 70th week all King from Daniel chapter 9 so there's actually a lot of information that's in that chapter and um and I want to Maybe cover a little bit of it this morning with you um but in in uh in saying that let's go to Daniel 9 And1 and we'll read here uh the first two verses and let you be seated for in the first year of Darius the son of aerus of the seed of the mes and which was the king over the realm of the Chans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem God bless you as you could be seated this morning and I want to speak here on uh Daniel chapter 9 and I want to maybe just speak to you a little bit from here on the understanding of Daniel from the angel and I uh reading this portion of scripture we're looking at something I think that is very powerful uh here that Daniel and uh brother Bram speaks of it quite often in the three tapes that I just mentioned if you want to go listen to them they're very powerful very powerful uh tapes and there's a lot there's a lot in them tapes and I'm sure that you'll be quite blessed with them um but I say that this morning and uh and want to maybe quote brother brandham concerning Gabriel's instructions to Daniels something that he brought concerning it is he said I would like to do this he said uh God knows my heart and he's listening to me he said' but I wanted that I might Enlighten his people and he was actually studying The Book of Daniel the 9th chapter and he said I want to do this but I want to do it so I can Enlighten the people uh that was the reason the prophet approached it he said and I believe he will give it to me and I do not know as yet but I'm trusting for next Sunday amen that he will give us that and then again in Gabriel's instruction he said his wife was actually asking him he said how do you expect our people which are poor people and many of them uneducated like we are to understand such things as that and brother Ram said I said God will give the answer and no matter how complicated it is God can break it down and make it simple for we are the portion of the people who are longing and praying for that day and hour and our eyes are set towards heaven waiting for his coming I think it's pretty powerful when brother brandom approach such things as an uneducated man and he was speaking to uneducated people of course he's talking about biblically uh not having any schooling in that manner but he said God could give an answer that could make it simple amen and I I I I thank God that we've had a prophet in this generation that can take things that seem so uh complicated and make it so simple that we could understand it you know uh he he spoke language that we could understand such as brother Brandon would take one of the greatest Mysteries that you ever heard in your life and he would would say the seed is not air with a shook amen and he would just make it so simple now there's others that came behind him and took the Simplicity and complicated it and put some confusion to it to maybe make it sound a little better amen but I I just appreciate the way God brought it in our generation to make it an understandable thing for our age in our season now the scriptures are telling here that Daniel living in the time of the changing and uh he was changing actually from the Babylonian Kingdom and he was going to be living in the same city of Babylon but the government had changed to the mes and Persians which we covered uh when we were talking about the handwriting on the wall and so he was living at the time of the change of the dispensation of the governments and by doing so he realized that something was written in scripture in Jeremiah concerning the season that he was living and he was believing that it was a time of Deliverance for the church he he was believing that and and of course the scripture said I understood by the books the number of years therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet So Daniel was understanding by the books that something was about to happen in his season of time mother brandom actually tells us of how uh that he was he was reading these books and he said it done something to Daniel of course what it did is it made him desperate and I and I think that this is a very powerful area because a lot of people preach on desperation in the end time most people always put desperation to tribulation and they always make it sound like the only time the church will ever receive Revelation desperate uh because of the tribulations that come upon them but here is an exact example that a man seeing the scriptures through him in desperation in other words desperation can come one of two ways it can come through tribulation and again it comes through Revelation and I pray that God would give us a revelation that would make our hearts desperate to understand the season and the time that we're living because that we have been reading the scripture and seeing the time the season that we're living aligns with what the prophets have said concerning our generation now it said here uh uh the prophet will say it very clearly he said now Daniel was there and I think it's amazing he said he was an alien he had been ousted from his people from his church he says without one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be saying he said what he's saying to himself in the midst of all this still he held on to what the prophet said amen no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to Heathen temples everybody worshiped their Idols no chrisan songs nobody believed the same thing he did and yet 68 years from a young man of about 12 or 14 year old he was taken down there and he held true to God and understood by Jeremiah's books he said the prophets that were that were uh almost accomplished and how that that would warn the heart of any true prophet of God today that we look back and see this true Prophet said and know that we're at the end time he said I understood by the books of Jeremiah my brother amen now brother R is saying look at this man living in the time he was living without any church to go to without any Fellowship without other people without someone to to encourage him he didn't have those people who were praying for him and this but this man held victorious in that kind of situation amen and he only had the books of Jeremiah to do so and I I think it's pretty powerful Amen brother br will actually preach a message to us called why some people can't keep the Victory and I thought it was powerful that this man was keeping a victory in that kind of circumstance and that kind of season and how it ought to be an encouragement to every believer today that we should be able to keep a victory in the age that we're living in amen with our churches and with our assemblies and our songs and our encouragement our weekly uh uh coming to the house of God how that it would be a blessing now of course it was Jeremiah the 25th chapter that Daniel was reading can we just go there Jeremiah chapter 25 and let's just read the eth to down to the 14th verse now Jeremiah was a prophet prophesied before Daniel and before the children had come into this now uh therefore thus saith the Lord host because you have not heard back up one of the eighth verse there thus sayith the Lord of hosts because you have not heard my words amen the next then the ninth uh behold I will send and take of the families of the north sayith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against this land against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations around about and utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and a Perpetual desolations moreover I will take from them the voice of birth and the voice of gladness and the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride the sound of the milestones and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years amen and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and the nation saith the Lord for their iniquity and the land of the Chans will make it a Perpetual desolations now here we're reading a of a prophet who's prophesying against his own Nation but he's giving it a number of years amen uh and it shall come to pass when 70 years I will bring up on this uh the 13th verse sorry amen and I will bring upon the land of all my words which I have pronounced against it and that is written in this book The jeremi had prophesied against these nations and for Many Nations and great Kings Shall Serve themselves of them also and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands now brother Braham is beautifully telling us that Daniel is reading the exact words that I just read you he was just a young boy when he went into Babylon and they went in with this prophecy So Daniel would have sat around and read those prophecies the same as you read the Bible you read the same very words that he read now I think this is powerful for for what I'm what I'm thinking of is how that God was able to put words on a page and they so affected this young man that he kept a victory in the middle of Babylon that he kept his he kept his stature he kept his loyalty he kept his grace to God and that's what he was reading that had that much effect upon him you you think of that he he begins to approach 70 years can we again let's read again Jeremiah chap 29 same Prophet Jeremiah 29: 4-14 amen Jeremiah 29 uh veres 4-4 thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel unto all that are carried away captives and whom I am caused to be carried away from Jerusalem under Babylon now they're already being carried into Babylon now and he's addressing them while they're there build ye houses and dwell in them and plant Gardens and eat the fruit of them and take your wives and beget you sons and daughters and take wives for Sons for give your daughters to your husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that you may increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city where I caused you to be carried away captive and pray unto the Lord for it for in the peace thereof you shall have peace amen for thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel let not the prophets and diviners be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to you with dreams which you shall cause to be dreamed for thus they prophesy falsely unto you in my name I have have not sent them saith the Lord for thus sayith the Lord therea 70 years be accomplished in Babylon I will visit thee and perform my good word toward thee and causing you to return to this place hold it right there think of this now here is a prophet who has prophesied before they ever went you're going for 70 years now amen in that season of Jeremiah preached I think 23 years he preached that sermon to them you're going to Babylon for 2 for 70 years and in the middle of prophesying that there was another Prophet that came up and broke the the the iron or broke the oxen remember he broke the the Yoke of wood off of the neck of his and then and then he told him that God's going to deliver them and they don't have to go to Babylon it's not going to be that way and then Jeremiah prophesied to him he said you've taken the wooden Yol and you've made it an iron yolk and he said thus sayeth the Lord you're not going to live out the rest of this year amen and Babylon will take possession of Israel and it'll be there 70 years now they're in Babylon and there's prophets still prophesying you you don't don't don't build your houses don't get married don't don't establish yourself make war here in Babylon and while they're there he's sending them letters in their captivity saying you're going to be there 70 years pray for the Peace of Babylon and build houses and marry and and he's instructing them amen because he's not Desiring them to believe the wrong thing but establish yourself because God's not going to hear hear a prayer of Deliverance for 70 years look look now this has been solidly drilled into Israel by now this Prophet Jeremiah again and again and again 70 years and then he said I will hear your prayer look at the next verse the 11th verse for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord and their thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in I know that's a famous verse that's been made famous in the last days but here's a prophet saying that I know the thoughts that I have toward you God already knew the thoughts of Israel when they went to Babylon and his thought of them was you're going to be there 70 years but at the end of 70 years I'm going to bring a Deliverance to the church amen and that Deliverance will come in its season and that 70 years will be the marking of that season I think it's powerful to know that God sets a season of Deliverance he sets a season amen that that that you can live in something for 70 years but as soon as the time piece of the prophecy of God clicks on its right date and right hour there is not enough Devils or enough uh Babylonians or enough Persians or mes to keep these prophecies from Rolling forward now before the 70 years no matter what they did there was no Deliverance but at the mark of 70 years there would come a Deliverance among them that there was nothing that was going to be able to stop it now if you're the one reading reading this throughout the 70 years it would almost be um a moment of uh how could I say it it would be a time as you're knowing no matter how much you prayed no matter what you did no matter what the season amen it was going to be a certain way but they were all looking for the season of Deliverance they were looking for the season of expected end they they knew that God had a thought of Deliverance for them and it would come in a certain season and that season would be marked by 70 years and when they began to to read that and know that 70 years is accomplished that's what was wrong with Jeremiah or with uh Daniel in Daniel the 9th chapter that was why he was being uh enthralled in prayer and and he was fasting and he was looking to God because he knew the season that God would hear prayer concerning the Deliverance of Israel had come upon them isn't it something when you see that there is a mark concerning the prophecy of God and then you see that Mark come to pass let's just say he would say something like seal up the seven Thunders until the seventh angel sounds see then that then there's no matter how you approach the Bible until the seventh angel sounds that will remain sealed but if you're the people who's leaving in the season of when the seventh Angels sounded you have seen your 70 years accomplished now you know it's a season of Deliverance and and a season that God will send utterance and he will send deliverance and he will send an hour and it may look like evil times and it may be Troublesome times amen but God knows his thoughts concerning the church and they're not thoughts of evil there are thoughts of Peace amen there is an expected end for the Church of the Living God I don't know I don't know what the devil has to say about it and I really don't care but I do know this God has thought some things concerning you amen that God has given to the church amen and that is a certain season of time now we read here Amen in in Jeremiah chapter 29 the now let's read the 12th the 12th verse as well then you shall call upon me and shall go in prayer unto me and I will hearken unto you see the inspiration of Daniel to be praying at that very season amen then I will hearken unto you 13th verse here and you shall seek me and find me when you search with me for all your heart Amen in that season if they if their hearts would would seek God they would see it it would come in understanding in that season he meant look what he says I will be found of you sayith the Lord I will turn away your captivity I will gather you from the Nations and from all the places will I you have been driven sayith the Lord I will bring you again into the place which I have caused you to be carried away captive my think about it in that season of understanding in that season of when God is going to answer prayer this is the season that Daniel recognizes by the scripture I am living in that season and this is the effect that it had on Daniel without a church without hymns without religious services without fellowshipping without having other believers to call and compare scriptures to him reading this and determining I'm in the season of the 70th year of the Captivity it brought a desperation upon this man that he had to appeal to God conc concerning the words of Jeremiah my when I think about this I think about the the words of Daniel and how that he was able to be pulled in by the scripture what about you and I this morning amen what about the things in the last days what about the things that we understand by scripture amen that should come up in the last days brother random says it very clearly he says that the holy spirit is here bringing this in the last day the same as it brought it on Daniel in that day might to think of this a prophet amen a prophet like we like we have received could come here and say I understand that there's going to come some scoffers in the last days as he's According to second Peter I manyan knows he opens up the Rapture book brother R begins to preach the greatest revelation of the Rapture he begins with scoffers shall come in the last days now it sounds like a negative but it's not a negative because he's telling you scoffers are going to come but that's a sign to you you're living in the season of your deliverance amen I understand scoffers are coming people are saying to me all the time well scoffers they're they're saying brother bam did this and they're saying they did this and that ought to be a sign to you above all signs that it is the season of the Deliverance of the Church of the Living God Amen that scoffers shall come that Nation shall rise against nation in the last day I understand there'll be tidal WS I understand there'll be fearful sights and flying saucers I understand this for the fail and the fear there'll be a perplexity of time and distressed amongst the nation I don't have time to preach on every one of these but you know the perplexity of the times who knows what to do who knows what to do with the with the with the world's systems and the economies and now we got Co poured on us amen you think it's hard in your own families or your own church think about the world leaders right now trying to determine how to approach this thing it's perplexity it's it's a distress it's a nervousness it's fearful sights amen it's plagues it's a it's ungodliness it's falling everywhere there's so much change in the season we are and we can look at all these things and we could become discouraged by them and we could fall under the fear of them and under the depression of them or we could look at them and say this marks the time period of the Deliverance of the Church of the Living God it ought to make us hold steadfast it ought to make us fearful in the sight of God t know we're in the season of prophetic Deliverance amen of when God said he would open up his ears and hear the prayer of Deliverance in such a time as we're living today I understand this I understand now look at this brother Ram said I understand by scripture that women's going to Bob off their hairs in the last day now ain't never been a season like this when people doing what what he's talking about amen the whole world cutting their hair women is the thing to do I understand they'll wear shorts and clothes and they'll walk in high heeled shoes and tinkling they'll go in the last day I understand the morale will be very low in the last day I understand preachers will be false shepherds in the last day they'll compromise and not feed the people the word of God Amen they'll go after Creeds instead but I understand there'll be a voice that'll come in the last days a crying out of the Wilderness a calling back to the original message back to the things of God I understand by the books these things will take place I understand that in the last days there'll come a famine the churches will be so organized and set everything together in the last days there'll be a famine it'll not be for bread and water but it'll be for the hearing of the word of God and people will go from east to west and north to south seeking to hear the word of God churches will be so organized and tightened till they'll fail to hear it I understand that by the books but in the day oh God there'll be a branch that'll rise up out of David I understand he'll send Elijah as the day comes to an end he'll have a message that'll turn the heart of the children back to their Apostolic fathers turn them back to the original go back again to the end and start and I understand that'll take place just before the spirit leaves the church for the Jews I understand this amen by letter I do it by the word by the written word that Israel will return to her Homeland I understand that prophets that Israel will rise and become a nation they'll establish Temple worship and go to dealing with her again and then come to her Homeland there'll be two prophets that'll rise up in the last day I understand this just as the Gentile Church moves out two prophets are going to arise Elijah and Moses to Israel amen what is it we see these things are true they're scripturally true amen we're looking at all the things happening let me ask y'all something is Israel in its Nation or not is it already there with a with a flag flying over it this morning they have an army a nation a government they have a a seed the UN they're a nation fully a nation and they're doing it now to you that are born and when it was a nation you've been born lately and it seems like it's always been that way but history tells you for 2,000 years hip was not a nation but it's a nation this morning churches are organized this morning women's hair has been cut all over the country immorality has set in Inventions have taken over from the Tree of knowledge they have atom bombs setting in the hand angers ready to destroy the world darkness is settling over through rock and roll and unbelief and Antichrist and Satanism and it's moved into the governments of homosexuality it's everywhere people say well brother way if that ought to be scary it shouldn't be scary for the church it ought to be a season to understand that in the season these things are going on that there would come a desperation in the heart of the people of God and they'll begin to seek the wisdom of the Holy Ghost and whenever God's people begin to pray and seek the wisdom of God the spirit of inspiration and revelation will fill the church with power and authority and bring an eye openening experience to every man and woman and daughter of God in this season that we're living in it's a season of desperation I don't know about you but I'm not going to wait amen for the tribulation to get desperate to see the hour I'm living I'm not going to wait amen until plagues are everywhere to see the season that I'm living I'm going to say God I see in the Bible these things are supposed to be put me in a desperation to understand and to pray and to make my life right before you my brother Ram said it's a season he said and what it ought to do is ought to make us check up it ought to make us check up I think it's checking up time it's checking up time now look what happened here amen when when this when when when amen when when this man begin to pray I'll not go through the entire prayer amen but if you like to read the book of Daniel the nth chapter it's a good time to to read this because amen from the second verse amen here Daniel turns his face to God and he makes a prayer of how evil he has been and how evil his people and how they deserve what they got and how that God made a promise to them if you do this you're going to get this and he said Lord we deserve it he said and give to un unto us is the face of confusion conf usion and amen and and with thee is righteousness and he begins to appeal to God and say we're sitting here confused and alone and forsaken we're outside our Temple we're outside of our worship and it's all because of our sin and our ungodliness he he begins to say our condition is our fault it's the way we did the way we live and you begin to get desperate before God he don't blame God for the situation he don't blame God and say well I I don't understand why you did me this way and I'm upset at you Lord because these situations and they he begin to tell him Lord I know it was the sin and I know it was the people and I know what it was amen but then he begins to ask for understanding he begins to ask God to bring something special amen if you want to read something powerful read Daniel the 9th chapter and read what kind of prayer it is that Angels come to hear because the Bible said while that this man was praying it come about the evening obligation amen or the evening sacrifice and the Bible said the angel Gabriel touched him and he came into the room with him while he was praying that's when the angel came to him you you know how many times brother bam tells us amen if we want angels to visit our home that there's a there's a way to get angels to visit a home he said said an atmosphere that Angels would be welcomed coming into he said the two on the road to EMAs was talking about the Lord when he stepped out he said Mary was thinking on the prophecy when the angel Gabriel come to her amen I believe this morning that angels can come right in the house of God I believe we can set an atmosphere that Angels would come Among Us amen when we set our mind upon the Lord amen set our mind upon the things of God and an angel came to him now I would like to take a about a it would be nice if I took about two hours here and preached on how the angel came to Gabriel Gabriel came to Daniel Amen because I think it would be relevant to the season we're living I'm not going to but it would be relevant to the season we're living of how how the angel came to Daniel Amen you can go hear a prophet tell it in his own Ministry how the angel came to me but you can read how the angel came unto Daniel and it's in the Bible now why people have such a hard time today in believing that an angel could come to a prophet and speak to him I I don't understand because it certainly happens in the Bible and it's clear in the scripture that an angel Gabriel come unto Daniel and if you want to read that we'll read it in Daniel uh chapter 9 verse 22 amen we can read here Daniel 9 chapter 20 verse 22 you can read here how the angel actually stepped into the room and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth he said to give thee skill and understanding and at the beginning of the supplication the Commandments I have come to show thee Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish transgressions to make an end of sin to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in Everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and the prophecy and to anoint the most holy now therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore to build Jerusalem under the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks three score and two weeks and the street shall be built again and the wall and even in Troublesome times and after three score week shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and in the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with the flood and with the end of the war of desolations are determined and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week shall he cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of the Abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the coming consummation that is determined shall be poured upon the desolate now you're reading an angel talking to a man who has been praying concerning the season that he's living in this man is convinced that 70 years have been determined of the Captivity and he's come to the end of 70 years but when Gabriel comes to him he don't just talk to him about 70 years he talks to him about 70 weeks which opens up the entire time span that God will deal with Israel as a nation a lot of people wonder about the 70 weeks and they they say well brother Wayne or they ask questions around the world concerning 70 weeks and many people have confused this and they take it in and they mix it with both Jew and Gentile but brother B said according to the scripture here that Daniel was cons accepting instructions concerning thy people which was the Jewish people so the 70 weeks concerns the Jewish people it is not a gentile scripture at all it is a Jewish scripture now it should be given unto the Jews and it should be brought now I want to take just for a couple moments here and see as the prophet would take this he said when Gabriel come to him he come to bring amen a skill and understanding amen a skill and understanding now that understanding was amen that God was not going to deal with Israel until it come to its Homeland right he's not going to deal with Israel till it comes to its Homeland this was the understanding that God was given unto Daniel that Israel will not be blessed until it comes to his homeland God has never blessed Israel outside of its Homeland is that right he's never blessed it outside of its Homeland when it gets in its Homeland there is where Israel's blessings are laying amen now in case you brother think brother Ram is just talking about Israel his very next statement says but God will not deal with his church until she comes to her Homeland he says which is the message of the hour you see after after God is showing us a parallel that Israel was waiting on a season just as the bride was waiting on a season and God's blessings come upon the church when the message of the hour comes there is a blessing that comes upon the house of the God on the house of God and he will not deal with her outside the message of the hour now I tell you that's something to write down friend and God will not deal with the church outside the message of the hour people get in their mind they're going to go out and do great things and they're going to set the message aside and they're going to go into the apostolic worlds and do great things God will not bless this bride outside the message of the hour if you want a blessing on your life get in this message and let the let the Dynamics of God come upon his word that will Enlighten the season that you're living in and fill you with the glory of the hour that you're living in that's the message that God gives to the church he never did bless Israel outside and he never will bless you outside he'll never bless you as a Methodist or a presbyterian or a Catholic or a pilgrim or a Nazarene or a Church of Christ or a Pentecostal he will never bless that you've got to come back to the Homeland back to the beginning back to a Pentecostal experience like what happened on the day of Pentecost with the power of the Living God that changed thousands of people so now we realize the message of the hour amen is connected to a Pentecostal experience you can't set aside a Pentecostal experience and expect the blessings of God but a Pentecostal experiences a confirmation of the resurrection and brings the church in the homeland of the power of God in the season she's living him I understand by the books that all the wickedness is going to take place but at that same season he said I shall pour out my spirit saith the Lord of hosts and I shall restore sayith the Lord how's he going to restore when he pours out his Spirit he's going to bring a Dynamics on the word that will take the church back to the original word that was poured out on the day of Pentecost amen I don't know about you but I'm not going to camp out in any denominational ages I'm not going to camp out in any of them but when the denominational ages ended that's where the bride's blessings began amen the prophet said that denominational days were ending when the book itself was being opened up we've got to season that we're living in it's a season of understanding it's a season of inspiration it's a season of favor it's a season of Praise it's a season for the bride to go back to where she come from because she's ordained to do so I think there ought to be a desperation in the church to get back under the original word of God not let one Creed not let one idea not one let one a stagnant thing come upon our lives but allow the blessings of God flow like they've never flowed Through The Years God will hear our prayer in that season a prayer for devil portion a prayer for Life a prayer for truth God will hear the prayer because that's the season that is supposed to take place I when I think about this this Angel comes to Daniel and it says he come to bring understanding and skill amen I believe understanding is powerful I believe if you can understand something that brings you into something under with understanding comes power is that right remember remember when when uh the angel had come to brother brandham and brother Ram was sitting there praying constantly about the gift that was in his life and while he was praying about that gift amen he was confused because preachers were telling him it was an evil thing that was coming on him and when he went into prayer the angel came to him and brought a skill and an understanding and told him the reason he was born and said gifts and callings are without repentance and the reason you are the way you are CU you was born for a purpose amen and here he thought that what was happening to him was wrong he thought what he was dealing with him was wrong but when he got in the presence of the Angel he not only welcomed it but he exercised the gift knowing that it was God's will for his life and you see can you can you fellowship with brother random on this point that there was a difference about you there was a Desiring about you and understanding amen and people told you you should stay out of them seals and you stay away from that prophet and you stay away from that church and they're a bunch of Fanatics and they're just shouters and holy rollers and and they told you all them things but whenever you got in the presence of this Angel he made you to understand you were born for the purpose to serve God in the age that you're living in we were not put here amen just to live in this world we were put here to bring the understanding of the word in the season for God said the wise shall understand in the season that we're living in and if there's going to be an understanding there's got to be somebody in this earth that is a vessel of understanding they've got to be a wise virgin who's living in this season we might not be able to break it all down and tie every scripture together but brother we can understand this message comes from God and I was born to be believe it and to prophesy this word in the season that I'm living in my when I think about the grace that was given now now if you take this season of understanding this is the reason that the angel came was for understanding the reason the angel came in this age was to bring understanding to the church that this is the season you're living in this is the time this is the appointment and if it was just me saying it if it was just an angel saying it be one thing but it was the thing that the prophets had already spoken and had brought them into a reality in the season that we are now detailing the time that we're living the spirit of wisdom brother bam said will come into the church to make known the church by revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church and revealing what day we're living in the same as Gabriel came to Dan the Holy Spirit has come to the church in the last day to reveal these great deep Secrets do you understand so God came for the purpose to give you understanding amen God Wants You to Know listen God already knows God knows the very moment the very season he already knows the or ordination of your life he knows who has and who hadn't got the Holy Ghost God knows these things but he want wants you to know these things he desires you to see the studying of scripture is not for God it's for you the listening of the tapes is for you to come into understanding of the season to know your age to know your maturity amen I tell you this I I believe that this is the very season for it to happen it's the season of the eagle the season of adoption amen now I brother Rand would tell us that we never have the right kind of Faith until positionally we know who we are faith comes from positionally knowing that's where faith comes from is that right the right kind of faith and the faith we're looking for is not just for Divine Healing we're looking for a faith to change our bodies and that'll take a perfect Faith so there has to be something that can position us perfectly in the word of God in the season we're living and it'll take God to reveal or to bring it brother brother brings it to Revelations 10 and said of course that this would bring an Ephesians or a paradox or an understanding in the last days brother ramam said we're promised that would be an understanding he said we're going to receive an understanding how many know brother Ram actually taught that it was the evidence of the Holy Ghost is a clear understanding so it's not God bringing confusion he's bringing understanding the understanding is the day you're living now people will take these things like we've read right here and instead of bringing understanding they will bring confusion we just read something that has probably brought more confusion among the church then of course in the messages there as much confusion concerning this as anything you've read but the reason the confusion is there is because men desire followings and they desire to sing like they understand things better than the next guy but if you just take a profit and let it become simple the Simplicity of the word will bring understanding which brings faith into your heart and positions you to know where you're standing this very hour we don't have to go chasing some guy somewhere we don't have to come chasing somebody's YouTube program or its internet page to figure out heyen what about this and his and this and that we've got a word from a prophet concerning the season that we're living in think of this in the six-fold purpose amen the six-fold purpose sounds big don't it sounds really sounds like it's just so far nobody could ever understand it but C can we take just a just a moment to look at it look at the six-fold purpose here brother bandam will actually line it out for us and he'll say look it come to bring understanding number one amen now we're going to be looking here at the uh the 70 weeks that are determined it's the 24th verse look at what he says there's there's six things here he says number one we're going to finish the transgression we're going to finish the transgression Daniel is receiving information from Gabriel that's telling him there's 70 weeks accomplished and there's a six-fold purpose for these 70 weeks the 70 weeks will end the transgression of Israel see he's telling you the 70 weeks is for a purpose the first purpose of 70 weeks given to Israel is to end the transgression of thy people it's not ending the transgression of the Gentile it's the people so 70 weeks has nothing to do with a gentile church at all amen now I'm going to say this as strong as I know how because 70 weeks determined are to Israel and to Jerusalem thy City and thy people of Daniel but the reason a prophet preaches it is to bring an understanding to the church that's not your inheritance amen and the Trib ation Falls during the time of the 70 weeks and it's not your inheritance so he's not getting on to the church saying you can't understand the 70 weeks he's saying you have no inheritance in the 70 week it's not your portion and William brandham is a Joshua and he's crossed the Jordan and he's pointing out the portions that belong to the church the Gentile and he's saying this is your portion and this is your portion and this is your portion but 70 weeks has nothing to do with you and thank God they don't because the 70th week of Daniel is a tribulation period which is the six seal it's the saving of the Jewish people but it has nothing to do with us praise God we're not going into tribulation we believe in a pre-tribulation rapture we don't believe in a post-tribulation rapture we don't believe in a mid-tribulation rapture we believe in a pre-tribulation Rapture the bride will not go through the tribulation period there's no reason for her to go because there is no sin on that bride sixfold purpose of the 70th week number one is to end transgression and there is no transgression in the Church of the Living God there's no see there's there's no transgression here this morning there's nothing that it has nothing to do with us it's to finish the transgression of those that transgressed against God people say what does that mean to finish the transgression what this means is is that Israel killed its own Messiah they killed their own Messiah they transgressed God and the 70th week will be to end the transgression that they made that day at Calvary now if you turn into Romans chapter 11 pull it up right quick Romans 11th chapter and Paul tells you in the 25th and the 26th verse and he gives you the answer to this scripture in Romans 9:24 for I would not Brethren that you be be ignorant of the mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits the blindness is part as happened to Israel watch until the fullness of the Gentiles come in until the fullness of the Gentiles come in the next verse and also Israel shall be saved all Israel can be saved can you isn't that powerful all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob if you just underline that in your Bible turn away the ungodliness from Jacob is exact translation amen of that he will do away with the transgression the prophet said this is an exact answer to Romans 9 the 24th chapter he will turn away the ungodliness from Jacob what did he do brother Bram said here's what happened he said what they did he said is they rejected their own Messiah now why did they reject their Messiah for you they rejected their Messiah for you they literally murdered their own Messiah who came to give them life so you would have a chance that you would not have a transgression amen that you would have the grace of God in your life my look at this until the fullness of the Gentiles come he's telling you that God stopped Israel and put you in their place he explains it in Romans 11 he said he said he took the he took and took the branch off of the Olive Tree and and grafted in a wild Vine Heen he grafted in a wild Vine what did he do he put you on the Olive Tree that had the roots of Abraham amen how else would you ever get the blessings of Abraham unless God would have put you on the tree of Abraham you had no inheritance in that tree you had no roots in that tree but God took you off the Wild and put you on the tame and the life of Abraham's Covenant came up through the tree and brought a blessing to your house and God is saying until that until that wild tree is finished then I'll come over and get Ro get Israel and I will put it back where it belongs amen what is it the wrong they did transgression the wrong they did Brother B says what will fix it they will receive the Holy Ghost what will fix it they will receive the Holy Ghost all Israel shall be saved They will receive the Holy Ghost can I say it to you not all Israel is Israel not all Israel is Israel Israel he's speaking of is the 144,000 in Revelations the 7th chapter it said God stopped the first world war on the 11th Hour the 11th day in the 11th month it was a mysterious thing but an angel stopped it until the 144,000 were sealed upon their foreheads that seal is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to know what them two witnesses are going to preach they're going to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Israel is going to receive it brother they're going to receive what these Gentiles have turned down God will save them he'll save them according to scripture he'll save them and when he saves them he will make an end to their sins the next one number two he will make an end to the sins that end of sins brother man replaces the word sin with unbelief to make an end to their unbelief what was their unbelief brother man said their unbelief was the Messiah they didn't believe Jesus was the Messiah they didn't believe it honestly when Jesus prayed from the cross he said father forgive them they know not what they do see remember having eyes they see not having ears they hear not God blinded those Jews so that you could receive something and they didn't believe their own Messiah that was their unbelief and the Bible brother B tells us this very clearly he'll make an end to that unbelief he said when did that unbelief come on him Matthew the 24 chapter remember or 27th chapter when they were going to crucify Jesus Remember pilate told them I don't find no fault with this man I don't find any fault and you should release him we'll let you release one one one man today remember what they did they said give us barabus right and that's where barabus got life and Jesus got death amen that's where you and I got saved that was the morning of our Salvation the Gentile church was saved and Jesus was crucified and look look at what they said pilate took some water and washed his hands and said I will not have the blood of this innocent man on my hands and you remember what the Israelites said they said let his blood be upon us and brother it was and brother it was that six million Jews that died in that Holocaust under Hitler was the blood of Jesus Christ upon the people through suffering and persecution and it's not over there'll be a three and a half year tribulation where they'll suffer for the thing that they received unto them but God will make an end to the sin he'll bring an end to their unbelief he will open their eyes people say well brother Wayne Amen where's that at in the scripture I I think it's a powerful scripture brother man brings that exact thing to Joseph in the days that Joseph was rejected as a messiah remember his Brethren knew he was their brother but rejected him as the leader and God allowed them to do that and Joseph was taken and made the lord of the Gentiles took a gentile wife and had a family with a gentile woman amen and at the End Amen of sin the end of the unbelief of his Brethren was when they brought them Brethren down to Israel or to Egypt and they sat in the room with Joseph and the prophet of God said look the Bible said and Joseph sett Al they brought the brethren in and Joseph sat Al and he cried aloud brother man said they heard him crying in all of Jerusalem or all of Egypt he was crying because of what had been done he said but what had he done with his wife he had took her and put her away he had put her in the palace while he made himself known to his Brethren what did he do he ended their unbelief he told them I am Joseph your brother and what they do well they thril down and begin to cry and see they make an end to it brother man said they don't make an end to it it'll make an end to it it'll bring it Joseph is an end of sin amen it'll break an end to their sin what's he going to do in Zechariah Chapter 12 I I think this is a powerful scripture Zechariah Chapter 12 in the 10th verse look what he said brother BR brings this one in as well he said I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplications that they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn him and mourneth for his only son and they shall be bitterness as one is in bitterness for his firstborn and I will pour upon him the House of David the inhabitants of Jerusalem it'll be the spirit of Grace and supplications isn't that amazing that God said in the last days I will pour on Israel the spirit of Grace and supplication I'm going to open their eyes do you know the prophet said that God is going to give white robes to all of them Jews from the time of Jesus all the way to the last day them real Gene that real 144 4,000 group that real believer he said he's going to give them a white robe at the end can you imagine that they died without accepting Christ but the spirit of Grace is going to be poured upon them until God will restore unto them what they didn't even deserve but because they were blinded of it I'll tell you this if God is able to pour the spirit of Grace upon those Jews and give back to them what they had done in that day how much greater then is the spirit of Grace upon him bride in the day we're living in listen this I can can I just say this the devil pushes you and the devil's beat you up with law and traditions and he's all time got in the church feeling like you don't deserve nothing and you don't deserve the blessing and you don't deserve the grace amen but can I say something this is the season when God has been pouring out he's been pouring out the grace of God if there ever was a time that the grace of God has been poured out it's the season that I'm living in it's the hour that I'm living in today it's a season of the grace of God being poured out upon the church when has there ever been a church that has heard a prophet say I went beyond the curtain of time and seen that bride and when I seen her she was standing there in a white robe he said where did they get them white robes he said they got it from the pardoning grace of accepting this word amen we're not going to receive white robes she's already got white robes listen you might not know it this morning but if you have received the pardoning grace of the word of God you're a wife wrapped in the white robe of God's grace and mercy it's an adoption robe church it's a robe of authority I know I know you don't feel like you're worthy amen but he said you're worthy come and walk with me what was it it's a it's a time it's a time of Grace now you can I'll just run through this quickly and not spend no long time here but in in the third part he said he'll make a Reconciliation for iniquity amen he'll make a Reconciliation for iniquity he said what's the iniquity of course it's again rejecting Christ but the Bible says in Isaiah 66 and8 that Israel will be borned in one day Israel will be borned in one day in Zechariah 13 He said what he's going to do is he's going to open up a fountain in the House of David look what he's going to do he's going to bring Grace for the iniquity this is all speaking of Israel he's going to bring in the fourth the fourth purpose he's going to bring in Everlasting righteousness amen God's going to now we're talking about Israel people ask me said brother Wayne will the Jews be in the Millennium for thy and thy people look what he said to bring in everlasting life righteousness brother brand in the church book actually says the Jews will be in the Millennium the 144,000 he said they will be there but they will remember they will be servants he said amen I don't I don't know what that actually means but they if you're in the Millennium it'd be all right me whatever I am H just get me there brother I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God Amen he actually takes this to Revelation 20 and 1 and 3 and habca 2 and ver14 he said it's when any the enemy has been put away and he would bring in Everlasting righteousness other words he's going to seal it away in the fifth he said he would unseal the vision and the prophecy it says seal in the in the book brother Ram takes it to sealing it then and unsealing it now in the sixth he said that he would come in the Millennium and anoint the most holy other words he's going to anoint a millennial Temple amen I don't understand amen people ask me all the time so will they Millennial Temple brother Ram said the sixth purpose amen of gabel's instructions to Daniel was to tell him God was going to anoint a temple in the Millennium so I just one who believes God's going to anoint a temple in the Millennium how it's going to get there who knows is it going to build it going to come out of heaven what's going to take place who knows if you go read it brother bam ties this to the Future home in the in the eighth day but you find out it's in the future home brother Bram backs up and he recar ifies it and said the Millennium is not the future home and he shows the Everlasting is in the Millennium so what are we looking at we're looking at God doing something in the days amen he's doing this in the days of Daniel telling him about 70 weeks that is to be accomplished under Israel now now can we just take just a moment and say brother B what is 70 weeks what does that mean one week equals 7 years so got to say it's 70 years weeks other words there's 70 weeks of years so every week was seven years now according to scripture there was 69 of those weeks that were fulfilled up to the time of Jesus's birth now how many realizes now if you if you go study this I'm going to tell you this and then you can go study the rest of it instead of taking a long time but there's a lot of people that teach that there's a week left to Jews which is 7even years they say the years of the tribulation is seven years and they teach that emphatically and I'll promise you if if you go listen to 70th week of Daniel you'll find out why they teach that because brother brandham is saying there's a week left to the Jews in the 70th week of Daniel but when you take to the fifth and The Sixth Seal brother brandham revisits the subject and he said that Jesus's Ministry fulfilled the first three and a half of the 70th week he said so there's three and 1/2 years left unto the Jews so the three and a half years unto the Jews matches exactly what was prophesied of the two witnesses in Revelations the 11th chapter when you think about the 70th week of Daniel we're talking about the last half of the 70th week of Daniel which is three and a half years now those three and a half years means god owes Israel three and a half years to end transgression to make an end of sin Amen to bring uh sealing the way of their iniquity he's God's going to deal with those Jews that's what he's saying that's what that's what the 70th week means God's going to deal with them Jews he's going to let them receive the Holy Ghost now if you turn to Revelations the 11th chapter let's read the first three verses how is God going to deal with them Jews just like he dealt with you Gentiles do you know that the opening them trumpets to the Jews as he open the seals to the bride do you know that seventh angel sounding to the Gentiles is opening of the seventh seal the opening of The Sixth Seal is two prophet sounding in Israel Revelations 11 the first verse amen what is it it's when God begins to deal with the Jews he sends two Messengers to them now you can't get them Jews saved until God is in the season of saving them therefore was given unto me a rod I'm reading Revelations 11:1 and therefore was given me a rod and it was an angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and them that worship therein and the court which was without the temple even measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall tread under for 40 and two months we're talking about 30-day calendar of the Jew you're talking about three and a half years watch the next now he said and I will give power un my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,2 and3 score days clothed in sackcloth 3 and a half years there is no seven-year period of ministry in the 70th week there's three and A2 years of Jesus's Messiah prophecy and then two witnesses Moses and Elijah can we just keep reading a minute here it's a beautiful reading these are the two olive trees of the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devour their enemy and if any man heard him he must be man or killed like this how many knows Elijah called fire out of heaven and destroyed Men by the 50s the same one the next verse and there have power to shut the heaven and that it rain in the days of the prophecy how many knows that Elijah shut the heaven up for three and a half years amen look in in the days of the prophecy and the power of the waters to turn them to blood now we're talking about Moses and to Smite the Earth with plagues talking about Moses and often as they will now these men will prophesy for three and a half years what is this Revelations 11 is the last half of Daniel's 70th week which is known to the church as The Sixth Seal in the Book of Revelations the 6th chapter which is a season when the foolish virgins are going to be saved which is a season when the 144,000 are going to be saved but it's not the season the bride's going to be saved because the bride is not going to be there she's already been raptured because of a prophetic word of Malachi the 4th chapter hold on to this word church amen amen you got Bibles and you got prophecies and you got got scripture and you got church and you got amens and you got everybody gathered together we need to keep the victory like never before I know things are rough and trials are everywhere and problems are arising on every corner sicknesses and diseases and and mournful sounds I it's a it's one of the most horrific Seasons that any people have ever lived I would just praying about this yesterday as I was reading over these things and I thought it was amazing because when brother Ram deals with these he he doesn't brother man just talks about the darkness and he keeps bringing the darkness he keeps showing the darkness amen now it's it's not a how can I say this it's not in the negative that brother randam is showing the Dark Side of leard deia it's not in the negative that he's showing us the denominations and the troubles and the problems that are arising upon us what he's trying to do is show us the season that we're living that night is coming he's trying to tell the Church the darkest night the world has ever known is coming upon the Earth amen I I I can I can I take it to the scripture in the book of Isaiah the 21st Church 21st verse Isaiah said it was recorded in Isaiah he said that they asked of the scripture and they said Watchman what of the night see they looked for understanding from a Watchman who had been climbed up high and brother man said which was an eagle of God it was a prophet of God that had lined up higher than the normal man could see and see what they were doing is scare was coming in the city troubles were coming and they looked to The Watchmen they said Watchman what of the night and the Watchman seeing the trouble that was coming prophesied to the city he said the night cometh the night cometh and any true Watchman has got to say the night cometh they can see the leard deia they can see the struggles and the trials and the problems and they can see it's not going to get better church can I tell you this this is not going to get I wish I could get up here this morning and say to you all this will be over next week and things will return to normal and things are going to get better after that I tell you things are not going to get better I tell you that economies are going to crash I tell you weapons are going to be increased and and pollution's going to get worse and and corruption's going to get worse I I say it's all going to get worse the Bible said it would gross worse and worse as the days are coming you think things are bad they're going to get worse I know it sounds rough but let me tell you that Watchman climbed up high and he said the night cometh amen he said but the morning cometh also but the morning cometh also I thought oh God I heard brother Rand him on tape he cried out he said the morning cometh also I thought dear God Amen I'm so glad that the morning cometh also I'm glad that these things that were seen it's not all that were looking at but the morning is coming for the church preacher what are you saying Watchman what of the night what does that mean to the church brother Bram said it means what's going to happen what's about to happen Daniel was in the season of change he was asking what's about to happen I'm saying Watchmen what's about to happen and we've had a prophet on the scene to bring understanding that the 70th week of Daniel is about to take place but there's a church a bride that has come under a prophetic word that's going to be lifted off of this Earth before the night can come to a climax the Church of the Living God is not going to be here I've got quote after quote where brother B said Russia is going to bomb America he said but before the first bomb ever drops there'll be a bride sting in glory tribulation coming but before it ever strikes there'll be a bride set in glory you said preacher how can you be so sure because it's our leaving that begins the 70th week of Daniel again and again and again brother Ram says he will not deal with the Jew and the Gentile at the same time let me assure you the bride will not go through tribulation you said brother Wayne when's this Rapture going to start I tell you it's already began I tell you change has already started God has already took you from your cigarettes and the alcohol and the beer he's already took you from denomination he's already rescued from the traditions of man rapturing Grace has already come into our heart the word has already been restored Seven Seals have already been opened the Thunders have already sounded God has already sent the grace and the multiplication of the spirit upon the Church of the Living God I say the Rapture of the church is already in a process this morning I say there's a word that is bringing stimulation by Revelation in the Church of the Living God listen to me friend this is not another message amen that goes to these Jews they will preach your message they will preach the same things that we are preaching in the Church of the Living God Amen whatever we need for a Rapture is all here today we're not looking for a great ministry we're not looking for a great man going to wave a wand over us and we're all going to be changed Bible prophecy has already shown you're living in the season of fulfillment you're living in the hour of it amen it's time to rise and shine morning Stars the light has come the light of understanding for resurrection power for anointing so brother Wayne why in the world we go through all them scriptures and all these things because many have brought them and brought confusion to the church to make them Wonder are they worthy I say you're worthy people's brought it to make it Wonder amen are you ever going to make it I say we already made it by the word of God I know we can't change the problems I know we can't change the hour but God the grace of God he has changed our understanding that we're able to see things differently than we've ever saw them morning is coming friends morning is coming I know I see where we're at morning is coming we losing loved ones but mour is coming troubles are everywhere but morning is coming I can see the dawn you bre how do you know how can you be so sure cuz the lights already begin to shine brother Brandon actually says this he said it's not coming from the Moon anymore he said the moon has already set he said and darkness has filled the sky he said but there's a Morning Star standing there alone prophesying of the oncoming light oh Daniel that morning star was alone no church no denominations would preach what he was preaching but he was standing alone with the prophecy and the same has happened in our age a prophet stood alone in the changing of times and told the bride the night is coming but the morning cometh also don't forget to tell the church the morning cometh don't forget to tell the bride the morning cometh oh don't forget to tell them the Rapture is upon the church we're not going to go in a Rapture after the tribulation we're going before we're going before could you stand to your feet with us this morning we're going before I believe it's the season of understanding night it's just going to get darker friends oh but that church she's rising up into a realm to reflect the light you can never say these things standing on the ground you got to get up there where that light can strike you right when that light begins to strike you can you can shine forth you can walk in the darkest of situations so God sent a message to us things are about to change here and for the church that's a powerful thing amen what an hour what a season I don't know about you but I I I I've been all week been praying Lord help us to give us understanding help me understand the season help me understand the moment don't let me look at the night me let me understand the moment that I'm living what what the if you can catch the inspiration of the moment if you can catch that great things can happen to you right that was Marvel but people that was around brother brandom and they said we'd be sitting there fishing or something he said brother brand get real quiet he said little breeze Blow by and he said he jerk off his hat and say he's here he said to us it was just a breeze but to brother brandom the resurrection power just swept across him I don't want to miss the moment when a Bree flows through here I don't want to sit on no limb let the breezes of anointing and Rapture raise up the thing that would carry us brother Bram said he went back to the mountains in Colorado he said no matter what the wind was doing he said there was a little Channel there he said I'd go to in the mornings he said about Sunrise he said i' go to this one little Channel and he said when the morning sun began to peep he said the wind would change and he said it would all funnel right down this one channel and he said I'd sit there and hear the wind blow down that channel now he's telling us that the winds were blowing all over the world but when that Morning Sun starts Rising that wind changes and it goes right down the channel of
