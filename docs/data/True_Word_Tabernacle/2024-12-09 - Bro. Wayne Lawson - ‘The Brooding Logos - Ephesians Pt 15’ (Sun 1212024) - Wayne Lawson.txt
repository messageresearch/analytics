amen it's it's a real blessing I want to take just a moment uh just we go into prayer this morning I know that there's been special needs um brother brother Ron has uh brother Brian was telling me that they put it out a little bit last night on the line so I don't feel feel so odd talking about it but uh they last week brother brother Ron actually about a week ago had uh went for a bunch of different tests and things when I was down at your dad's down at Sean's and um we were talking I could tell he's down a little bit so I asked him what he'd like to do and he said brother Wayne he said in April I'd like to come up there and be at the greenhouse with brother Aiden and the family when it opens he said I'd like to come in that into that supper and I said well I bet you we could arrange that and so we we had that arranged and he was going to come here and speak of Sunday and then later the week he he text and called me and said hey he said they found new cancer in my eyes and he said which tells me that that the brain cancer is activated and it's growing he said so I I probably be doing some treatment during that time so we've not said anything cuz he was kind of holding it back but uh brother Tim text me this morning said he'd be speaking today and he asked if we as a church would pray for him personally uh he's there in support for brother Ron and he actually got there you look how the Lord works when brother uh Tim arrived with brother Ron he walked in the door and shook hands and his phone rang and it was UAV and they were actually making the announcement to him that this is for sure the spreading of cancer which is which is a big deal in this situation but you know brother brother Ron's a warrior and the angel of God is between him and that sickness and as long as the Lord has purpose the devil can't touch his life now and we we know that amen so but brother Tim ask us to have prayer for him this morning as well as he's speaking there and he said ask the Lord to give him wisdom and give him words and I I believe we could support him in that this morning he's probably just started speaking about right now we pray the Lord just give him an extra burden so if we would just just bow our hearts let's pray for them this morning as a church and and what they're going through father Lord we bow our heart this morning and Lord we know you Lord it was the angel that met this messenger in a cave and said not even cancer would stand in the way Lord father as long as you got a right purpose Lord there would be nothing that could stand between you and your purpose father you've taught us that there's nothing can destroy the purpose of God in a life and nothing can take a man before you're done with him and I pray Lord Jesus this morning that your great hand of Mercy would be upon that congregation you'll be upon brother Tim as he speaks the word this morning I'm asking you to fill him with inspiration may you give him the wisdom of God Lord may you give him the voice and words of the Angels May Authority come into him in such a way Lord that he could help that place the congregation our brother Ron Lord we thank you for that and we ask you this morning that Lord your great spirit would move for them now Lord here this morning we've gathered in these Gates and Lord you have made a promise that you would be here in the midst of us and I know there's many needs that's gathered in the building this morning Lord and I just pray that the Holy Spirit would begin to move over this sanctuary and I pray father that you would reach Lord into every heart into every home that Lord Jesus we humble our hearts this morning before you and we ask you to come Lord and take this meeting Lord and use it for your glory may you bless your children God may you give to them great strength Lord now we ask you as we commit this service into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen and amen and God bless you this morning amen if you have your Bibles we would like to go into the word of the Lord and we'll look in the book of Ephesians again chapter 2 veres 4 down to 10 if you were with us on Thursday night we were here in this fourth verse for God who is rich in Mercy with his great love wherein he loved us and uh We've we've uh we dug quite deeply into that in our personal studies and I found that that's a very powerful scripture amen uh maybe beyond what we could even speak uh God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where he loved us the fifth ver verse even when we were dead in sins ha he quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and Heath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus now for by Grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship now that's a that's a great word we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them we ask the Lord to bless his words you could be seated this morning amen I want to speak to you today if I would hear in this Ephesians series I'm taking specific titles as we go along so you can catch the context of what I'm what I'm speaking on Amen I want to speak to you today from this uh the brooding logos the brooding logos I want to look at at how God Broods over his children amen the brooding logos amen I believe uh I believe that here as we were speaking Thursday night we were speaking about the mercies of God and brother bradam quotes something that that just struck my heart so uh real from the book of Exodus brother Bram says as Moses was leading the children of Israel over he said and they didn't they didn't die in the Red Sea like the others he said but they made it through he said because God carried them on the wings of the eagle and brother BR said what they were doing is they were following the message so that message brought them through and it was the mercy of God to their lives so brother bam brings this from the scripture in Exodus 19 and verse 4 in this Exodus 19 and verse4 he says you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear ye on Eagle wings and I brought you unto myself now that's powerful stuff amen I took you on Eagle wings from Egypt and I brought you unto myself amen now if um and when we're looking at that I want to also look at verse uh 32 or Deuteronomy 32 and verse 11 I'm going to read a couple of these scriptures to kind of get where I'm coming from and as an eagle stth up its nest and fluth over her young and spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh them and beareth them on her wings so the Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them amen so the way God spoke the way he led his children the way he brought Jacob he said the way he led them along without any strange Gods that's it's comparable to how an Eagle deals with with her children and he says as he fluth over her young now that word fluth comes also the same Hebrew word is used in Genesis chapter 1 when and the Earth was without former void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the faces of the water Amen in other words the spirit of God fluttered amen it brooded over a dark empty space and made something happened when I look back at this I think it's a powerful reality uh from the exposition of the church ages and L out to see a church age brother adal say this he said the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words does not mean exactly as they sound just taking them the way they sound he said in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead then this this first creation created all the rest of the universe whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God now we know for assurity that Jesus is God he is the very God he is a Creator in John 1 and3 said all things were created by Him and without him was nothing made that is made he is uh anything that was made he is the one whom it is said in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth also in verses Exodus 20 and verse 11 for in 6 days the Lord hath made Heaven and Earth and all them and rested on the seventh day there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation amen here we sit here tonight realizing that we're sitting on a finished physical creation because Jesus Christ is a Creator amen when we uh examine this of course we're sitting here tonight on this Earth and we're living in this atmosphere and we're living on this Spar amen it's amazing to me always that it's perfectly the right distance from the Sun it has an exact need of oxygen and nitrogen and the waters and the trees and and and everything that is needed to maintain human life it's all just there amen and to think that we're sitting here on this Earth tonight or this morning and realizing that the God we're serving is the god that created the whole thing now I I know that that's a very challenging statement in this end time amen isn't it odd it's a lay out to see a church age where he declares he is the beginning of the creation of God because it's in this age that it probably that that has become more atheist and more agnostics than there's ever been in the history of the world but it's been produced according to Isaiah 60 there's a Darkness to come upon the Earth and brother B said education and intelligence has brought that Darkness upon the Earth because as man becomes more intelligent he actually sends the world into a deeper depths of Darkness amen listen going getting smarter does not put people closer to God now you know brother Bram said education actually was the greatest enemy The Gospel had he said I go over there in Africa where they don't know nothing and I do this miracle among them and they're ready to serve God he said I come over in the educated world he said and they try to reason it and figure it out and make it happen and reproduce it and he said they got all these things amen but what we realize is man has never now man has never had the answers that he's looking for in human intellect amen I'll say this whenever a person starts out on the trail to figure out God by human intellect you are on a trail that will never end end and it will leave you it will leave you empty it will leave you hungry it will leave you nasty to others it will put you in a place that you can never Ascend you can never get to where you're going it is a place it will never have an end of the road because man can never reach that amen let me say this there's been a lot of smart people Through the Ages but they've never had the answer if you went to Socrates or you went to Playdoh this morning of course their words are great and they're inspiring to me intellectual Minds amen but they come up to a spot that they couldn't climb over because human intellect cannot climb the summit to answer who is God you could study creation your whole life and you can look into creation and never ever see the Creator we see it in medical science we see it in physical science we see it in educational science and we see the smartest Minds that's ever been theyve went so far into the technology until they broke into an atom and they can destroy themselves but for some reason they cannot reproduce themselves nor can we maintain life because it is the tree of knowledge and man is dying by that tree of course we're building an Eden but it's an Eden of death and it's an Eden of sin and people are not better off today because of it matter of fact more people die today because of it amen but you see the entire thing is is that very Creator himself has been taken out of the picture amen therefore we've had to substitute for our mental States we've had to bring Darwin in and we've had to bring Socrates and Plato and we've had to bring all these great philosophers and I just have to be very clear there's probably nothing makes me any sicker is to hear a preacher leaning on darsm and Socrates and ploh and and all these educational come on it has nothing to do with the Gospel of Jesus Christ somebody asked me one time and they I might as well preach since I'm here huh somebody asked me one time they said brother Wayne are you just against uh any kind of a counselor any kind of help I said oh absolutely not amen do whatever you can do to help the world Amen and it has a place in medical science they study it like our hot doctors and like our uh neurologist and like our Euro all these things are studies and they're specialist and God God bless them for whatever they can do to help them amen only thing I've ever uh uh been in conflict with is it has no place in the pull pit if we're going to see a psych just go to see a licensed one not some half-baked guy that's mixing the gospel and psychology together to bring it to the Gospel of Jesus Christ so what you get into is you don't have a good psychologist or a good preacher you got some kind of hybrid nonsense and it'll never bring the Church of the Living God into a rapturing faith I'd rather you not know your ABCs amen amen that to not know the god of Heaven because one of these days this whole thing is going to burn to the ground but there'll be a bride standing left because God who is rich in Mercy has brought it and I don't care you can sit on that all you want to but let me tell you this there'll come a day when you'll understand there's one thing that'll help Mankind and it is God himself that comes in the midst of the children of God he is the author of a finished creation he is the author of this now you you think about this because Darwin is explaining Evolution because he don't want to admit God of creation right now now if you go back into into create I've actually been to gpus Islands I I was there right where it started it it it's wild I went on the very Island he started it on and you know what I found out that if you got God in your heart you would never find our wisom in the gpus islands I was on the same island but being a dumb hillbilly I never picked up one one thing I never saw one animal I never saw one tree to make me believe that one germ started the whole thing and some intelligence who we don't know or know about made this whole thing from nothing can you imagine how could all of this order come out of disorder without some creator making these things happen why people's got so smart that they got dumb they have forgotten what it is in reality listen Apostle Paul preached on Mars Hill folks he stood among the gods of the Romans there was probably no less than 3,000 of them amen gathered around on Mars Hill and and and then none of them had the answers and when when Paul preached there he found one of the great altars said unto the unto the unknown God because all of their 3,000 ideas of intelligence could not reveal the creator of the heavens and the Earth but Paul answered the whole thing in Hebrews the 11th chapter and said by fath we understand that God framed the heavens and the Earth by his own word and until a man is born again he cannot believe that amen and until God gets into the soul of a person there's not enough Faith to look at a situation and just believe that God did it my goodness so brother Wayne what did happen then well that's a good that's a good reality because if you go back in the Scriptures it said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period so then we have a certain educational religious people who has started arguing of the archaeologists and say well you know the world's only 6,000 years old so they're trying to argue all these points with them well you don't argue with the science that the world is older than 6,000 years because brother Brown said God created heavens and earth period and he said there's a time space we don't know how long that period was is that right amen now watch with that time time space and period Then what we find is from that God himself now this is the way brother brandom set it up brother Roose John God himself amen had the end from the beginning isn't that beautiful wouldn't it be something if you could know the outcome before you ever started well when you're dealing with God he knows what's going to happen before he ever starts the happening and in the beginning God created so brother bam says in the power of transformation he says people think that God's repeating him self in the first couple chapters of Genesis he said but he's not he said what has happened is he spoke the word and then he goes and manifestes the word he speaks it and then he manifests it and that's God's way of doing things he said matter of fact when God created the heavens and the Earth he spoke what was going to be and he said those words became seeds and fell into the Earth beneath the Waters of the earth and they laid there in darkness now now if you're if you're if you're just coming into the message of the hour maybe some could be online this morning different ones are just studying these things so if you're just coming to what I'm talking about Amen brother bam is typing the water as the people that's Revelation 17 right the Bible said and the waters was the people so the symbology is in the beginning the world Amen had waters on it like today has peoples on it and God put beneath the waters the seeds of future civilization now what he did was brother random says it like this he said it come from a previous Civilization now now folks I I personally do not believe amen that God had two or three other the planets I I don't believe he done this two or three times he may have I don't know but one thing that I do know is his civilization was in his mind because before it ever happens he already had it in his mind and when he spoke it that's the way that God lays a civilization is in the seed so the seeds of the civilization of Eden was laying beneath the water amen but they were powerless under the water without any light they just laid in the darkness see it was a darkness that covered the seed so it couldn't be what it was supposed to be it couldn't become what it was supposed to become because it was lacking something though it was God's spoken word seed it needed something to come to manifest and the prophet of God said that's when God said let there be light and he said coming out of God was that great Halo which we call the logos that great logos he said begin to swirl down over the Earth and begin to move across the waters now let me tell you when God began to move across the waters the darknesses begin to go backwards amen and the waters begin to part and the seeds that was laying there was receiving what they needed to come to life because God who was rich in Mercy knew without this light they will never manifest what it is they're supposed to be but God rich in Mercy didn't leave them in the water he didn't leave them in the darkness he brought light to them hallelujah hallelujah that great logos begin to come over now the reason evolutionists can believe and prove to you in science that there is evolving truth in creation is because that's exactly the way God created creation he brooded over the Earth himself and as an eagle Broods over a nest God brooded over the Earth in this Halo of light and that light as it brooded it be to bring from the earth brother Adam told us this he said see first it begin to bring botney life he said then you had the little life and then you had the trees he said then here comes the animal life he said but watch now God is over the whole thing the Creator is over the whole thing so watch when creation come up to man it stopped at man now why did creation stop at men because God had reached perfection in creation oh my now that's pretty heavy because when God himself come to the Earth what did he come as so brother B said the very Creator himself was man that's why when Abraham anden Moses hid behind The Rock he seeing the back part of a man he the offing logos was the form of man brother said that's what he was brooding for was to bring something unto his own image can I say it for you he brought them unto himself God created until there was something in the earth that was like him isn't it powerful some thoughts require longer to express you know sometimes we break series up in two or three four parts and the reason we do it is because we have a thought but it can't be spoken one service it can't be placed in an hour or in a few stories but God had 6,000 years to express a thought and if you stopped him 2,000 years into it it looked a certain way and you'd have thought well if you were living in that generation you say well that's all of it but see it wasn't because God was brooding he was evolving something out of something until it come to its perfection in the sixth day and then God created himself he he said because Adam had been under a covenant they could fall he said but now we're hearing something different for I will put imity between God has already done something to fix it in the Covenant that he made with with Eve concerning the woman's seed and that's exactly what God Said to Abraham when he came to him he said Abraham I have already blessed thee brother man said I want you to notice the difference now in the covenants the Covenant to Adam was he could fall but the Covenant to Abraham as he couldn't fall Hallelujah brother B said because God had already did it he had already did it in his mind he had already made the woman seed when he spoke it amen Jesus Christ Genesis 15 tells us that Jesus was the way God planned to bless Abraham is that right so before Abraham ever started folks the finished product of Jesus Christ has already been prophesied so that brooding logos comes over Abraham watch brother B said and he lays a foundation for his Masterpiece coming and he puts Abraham in one corner his faith he puts Isaac in another corner and then he puts he goes over and puts Jacob Grace in another Corner then he comes over and puts Joseph in another corner and he builds a foundation because he knows where he's going and God began to brood out of that Foundation of Israel prophets and Priests and Kings but none of them was Jesus Christ none of them was God himself so God the great brooding logos could not walk away from Israel amen he had to hold what kept Him in contact with David in the middle of his trouble what kept him with Abraham when he was lying what kept him with Moses when he came to his mistakes what what was it it was the Broody logos that was determined I will have a masterpiece I will bring back what I've lost in the Garden of Eden and God would not be detered by the works of man this is not your work this is the work of almighty God God himself is creating and he's bringing out of Abraham Isaac and Jacob a nation and anybody that studies the nation of Israel knows there was tons of trouble in Israel there was tons of Back Body there were tons of adultery it was all kinds of sins balam tried to point it out but God said you're looking at the wrong thing balum you're looking at the wrong thing you can't see the smitten Rock if he could he would have knew it was Jesus Christ in a prefigure if he couldn't see the Brazen altar if he knew it he would have knew them that was Jesus Christ he couldn't see the secret of Israel The Secret of Israel was that Pillar of Fire that was behind that Veil back there that brooding Loos that wouldn't let him stop it wouldn't let him quit it was coming to Jesus Christ every Old Testament Prophet every scripture prophesied of the coming of Jesus Christ and when Jesus came John answered the question that was asked to Abraham and to Isaac father here's the wood but where is the lamb and that answer came thousands of years later when John the Baptist pointed him out there is the Lamb of God the brooding locost had brooded until God was manifested in the flesh upon Earth in his son Christ Jesus that's the reason he wasn't the second person of the godhead he was God himself manifested in the flesh it was a new genesis folks in John chapter 1 John began like Moses in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God oh but that 14th verse but the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the brooding loost didn't leave it in the word he brought it to the flesh one who could redeem hallelujah thank God somebody stepped out of this Ivory palaces and the great logos of God came into the Earth in the midst of darkness and unbelief and Pharisee toal lady OA that was back in that day he brooded until even God himself looked at a woman and he said Thou shalt have a child and thou shalt call his name Jesus and the angel prophesied over her life if she had had found favor and she said a very powerful thing to him I have not known a man he said but the thing that shall be of you will be overshadowed of the Holy Ghost oh Church of the Living God it will not be touched by denominational hands the thing that shall be borned in you shall be the operation of the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost God himself overshadow the womb of a woman to bring Christ into this age and that same Christ has been prophesied to come through a bright church and that same light that was there with Mary has returned to you and I to manifest the power of God in this age Hallelujah man will never manifest what we're talking about intellect will never climb it amen psychology will never get there we're talking about God manifesting In the Flesh of humanity it's the only thing that will work look at brother bradam tell the story he tells the story it's a powerful story he said look how when he come back that same Jesus God himself said in the this is my beloved Son John says this is the lamb and God in a voice as a pillar of fire came down on the river that's right and said this is him it could have could have said this is him of who the prophet spoke of this is him that was prophesied in the Book of Genesis see that light had seen the Fulfillment of his prophecy and it was there to identify that's right this is my son Psalms 110 said it this day I've begotten thee amen it's a a meic order the king priest the lamb there he was God the fullness of God dwelling in a man Hallelujah Heaven and Earth met that day the brooding logos finally got born back into the image he was the second man Adam come on the first one was made a living soul but that second Man became a quickening spirit and to every one of us that's dead tonight at this morning we know him as the quickening [Applause] spirit now said preacher what do you say Let me let me just make it clear as I know how they took that man and he walked on Mount Transfiguration with Peter James and John and a and a cloud overshadowed it a brooding logos came now this is my beloved Son hear ye him then they took him to Calvary and the book of Isaiah said he was spitting of God he was he had no beauty that you could desire him he was not that beautiful tree of knowledge right he was that ugly Tree of Life come on Heen when they building the Tabernacle in the wilderness it was made of tent skins it was not something to look at but all the life was there come on church I don't believe in this cold form of worship in this end time it might be beautiful but it's dead and it's cold and there's no life in it but come to the tree of life it might have altars and snot and screaming and Shout and tongues but there's life in it there's life in it oh thank God this morning for True Word Tabernacle there's life there's life Hallelujah give me life don't give me education give me life give me life for our children give me life for our young people give me life for our elders give me the Holy Ghost Hallelujah thank you Jesus they took him at Calvary and they Smit Isaiah 53 STS the story sir now why did they Smite Him Sister Gail because he was the only perfect lamb Exodus said they had to put him up and examine them look at how much time they killed him in Passover the same as they did in the book of Exodus and they kept the lamb up 14 days and examined him and judged him until the time of the killing do you know Passover when Jesus was killed that they judged our Lord and pilate said those beautiful words I find no fault in him but like a lamb he was led to the slaughter and he opened not his mouth brother that is the greatest success of any conqueror I've ever knew he laid down his life and he never bit back he never let bitterness come from him he stood there and let it happen and he was a lamb led to the slaughter put him on calvary's tree and they plunged him in the side but brother I love that part brother Greg when the Lord when the Lord stood there and took it all and he looks up into the heaven and said it is finished it is finished there's never been greater words spok of that in the whole world the Eternal Loos wasn't finished until the blood come out of his side come on Adam was created in the garden and it finished the work but Eve was coming out of Adam and here at Calvary amen when he cried it is finished you and I were the blood and the water that was released from the sight of the Lord Jesus it was another Eden it was another Genesis and there was a bride coming out of his side oh hallelujah hallelujah to God as a power in this message it's not church it's not works it's not legalism it's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah the blood it's still got power this morning it is finished he cried amen hallelujah sister Lisa the scure would not be denied his great architect this great work so somebody says why he why he smack it when he Smite it brother Bram explains it through n naal art and said what happened when Michaelangelo and Moses he said Michelangelo had in his mind to Moses and he said there wasn't the negative but he picked a block and he started working on it see he was the rock that followed the children of Israel but through the evolution of the brooding logos he became the rock that the dying Thief looked at and it wasn't in it wasn't in the making anymore it was in the Perfection now oh it's the love of God it was capping the whole thing I wish I had better ability it was the love of God it was the love of God from Eden that had saw his children laying in sin now he's on calvary's cross and love is coming from him and they're smiting him life is being let go brother Bram said Michelangelo and Moses he said of course when Michelangelo finished Moses and he got him to the perfect part that's when he smacked his knee and he cried speak which brother bam said that was the Masterpiece was the Smite was the Masterpiece he said because my was so pleased with what he had built he felt like it ought to speak when Jesus is at Calvary they see that is a bad part of his life it's the Masterpiece because he so matches what the prophet said of him it was exactly brother Steven he was everything Moses said he was everything David said he was everything they prophesied he was he didn't miss one lick he was a match piece to the thought of God until God himself could smile him oh I hope you hear me and he brought from him water and Blood Brother BR said there it was just like in Eden Here Comes the Bride from him yeah and Bride come out there on the day of Pentecost he began to brood over him and brother BR said what's he doing he said he's bringing for seed he's bringing for seed it's another Eden now he's bringing for seed he said now he said many people wondered why God set by and let these seed be beat and eaten and strangled and bruised and cut he said because the seed had to be planted in the ground it had to be planted see Paul had to be planted John had to be planted Peter had to be their faith had to go in the ground and brother B said oh but God was determined to have one Hallelujah God was determined to have one look at what he did when God began Amen in the Nia Council they went in the ground brother said But Here Comes Martin Luther and he sprigs out and he comes out just shall live by faith you as a Believer probably couldn't tell the difference in Martin Luther and the Catholic Church it would have took Luther and the church because now his church is turned around and going back to Catholics because they really don't see the difference but Martin seen the difference Martin Luther seen the difference in the way they did communion right do you see but if you would have stopped right there that wasn't the book of Acts Church Martin Luther smoking a pot and drinking beer but the brooding logos the pillar of fire said it won't stop here because he had a vision Paul's already prophesied in Ephesians 5 I will have a church a glorious Church Without spot a wrinkle Jesus has already prophesied in Matthew the 16th chapter I will build my church come on it's prophesied in the Bible that there would come a glorious branch in the latter days there would come a super Church there will come a super race there will come a super seed and that wasn't it and Luther wasn't it and Wesley wasn't it right there was only the growing portion the evolution yes sir amen come on it wasn't happening without God it wasn't evolution by education come on education couldn't lift them out of the Catholic Church are you hearing me education couldn't lift them out of it but it took the Broody lost to make Martin Luther see the justly by faith that's how a man lives by what he believes and there he was under his great faith I've always been amazed the anointing that was on that man yes sir I'm not even going to number the thesis last time I got them way wrong Stephen how many was there 95 I called him 32 I was a third right paraphrasing they had a thesis that that was what I was meaning and they told him you can come back in church if you'll just deny this see but through education they couldn't get to where Martin Luther had went amen that's good and Martin Luther could not regress life doesn't regress life moves forward so once that had happened and Luther come out in life he couldn't regress to the Roman Church he couldn't he couldn't stay where he was but the brooding logos was saying come on and then all of a sudden Martin Luther amen his light starts dimming his age starts coming John Wesley Rises up and begins his whole movement of the just shall live by faith but God will sanctify You by his word yeah that wasn't it I've said it off and I'll say it again sanctification is a place you got to go a place you can't stay meanest people you know are sanctified people who never got the Holy Ghost meanest people you know are sanctified people that never got the Holy Ghost that's right if they can't wear a long sleeve they sure enough don't want you to yeah it amen sure if they're going to wear a long sleeve and you wear a short sleeve man they'll beat on you till you either get in line or get away ain't no way you're going to drive a car and me driving this buggy put it in something you get ain't no way I'm going to let you do that while I'm doing this nobody said you had to do that that was a god of your own making sanctification by the spirit no man shall see God without Holiness who's Holiness then come on Church be perfect even as our father in Heaven is perfect then who is perfect brother B said there's only one perfect one and that's God and without the Holy Ghost you'll never come to Perfection that's why Paul said don't lay again the foundations of dead works and repentance unto God we believe in those things but it's Perfection folks let's go let's go let's go to Perfection the evolving place of churches can I say it the brooding logos is saying keep moving you know what he began to do he began to spring up till we had the baptism of the Holy Ghost come in Reformation of gifts in 1906 they thought that was the original brother B said oh no he said there's a stage of the plant that you missed he said that's that shuck this is not the original Holy Ghost ghost He says you know why cuz there had been no restoration of the word and you can't have a restoration of the day of Pentecost without a restoration of Paul's teachings you can't have it without the original word so brother random says in the Masterpiece he said then Malachi 4 said we would have a restoration of the church come on he said we'd have it he said Revelations 10 holds the word that would do the restoring you'll never have a perfect Church Without perfect word it'll take the opening to them seals to bring perfect word and the perfect word will bring a perfect Church perfect according to who now that's the real thing isn't it see my wife's perfect for me might not be perfect for you this reason you have to be careful even with other men's servants people judging one another in the ministry and things sometime maybe God told the brother to do it that way or he told a sister to do it that way so you respect one another right CU they belong to somebody else so maybe one wife is not perfect for one man right but his wife's perfect for him now if you were trying to align into the Perfection of the world to be a perfect bride you ain't getting there because there's science and civilization has a different idea of what a perfect Church exists as but to the bride it's a revelation that comes from God right it's a revelation that comes from God the brooding logos now when I say this when I say this uh brooding logos uh I wanted to maybe take a moment and bring that picture up again I know you all seen this picture if you hadn't seen this picture I want you to lift your hand when we bring it up is anybody never seen this everybody in the room okay we don't we don't really show this because of brother Bram which we do follow brother bram's teachings and and we're not ashamed of that at all somebody ashamed of that they ain't got on first base yet okay so we're not ashamed to brother Brandon more his teachings I can prove every one of them my scripture if you give me a few minutes but what was over his head is known as the angel of the lord it's known as the angel of his presence this is exactly what appeared on the river with John the Baptist this is what was brooding over the creation in the beginning it's the creative logos it's the brooding logos it's known as the pillar of Fire or the angel of the Covenant it is the headship to the church it's what led the children of Israel from Egypt all the way to the promised land and God said I bore them on Eagle wings amen so that light was coming for creation purposes now I just I just love this because this is taken in 1950 in SE Houston Coliseum now among us we recognize this and this is very be and you always want to remember this I didn't take that picture okay our church didn't take that picture brother brandom's campaign didn't take that picture you know it was this critic that took it brother Ray I guarantee you they wish they had that back I bet you they wish they had never built those Gallows I guarantee you they wish they had never built that Gallow I guarantee you Goliath wished he'd have left his sword at the tent that morning I bet you they wish they left their camera back at the house because this picture can't be undone folks you can criticize it but right now right now it's in the Hall of Arts in in Washington DC it's in the library I think it's Library of Congress uh uh Loretta and and Josh were just there I seen the picture with them amen you you see them they've identified this as a supernatural being brother BR said not just a supernatural being it's the supernatural body of our Lord Jesus Christ it's what Paul met on the road to Damascus and it's what you met when God is rich in Mercy Paul was on his way to kill Christians but God rich in Mercy wouldn't let him do it you say oh God help me do this and God help me do this but what did God help you not do that that's the real answer many of you were headed in a direction and you would have done this and you would have done that but God rich Mercy let the brooding logos come down in your path come on you're standing there with his hands up brother Steven amen had a whole church challenging him on this message but you know what he did he didn't cower he didn't Bend knees he stood on the message of the hour and God proved him to be an adopted son in this generation because he stands for the message of the hour let me say more and he stood with me and God will bless you brother he'll bless you standing with the anointing of this age I tell you what'll happen you get the right Spirit Upon A Ministry and God will begin to lift that because God is rich in Mercy Hallelujah sir the brooding logos thank you Lord oh everybody will be tested on it yes sir see see it's easy to play a tape but get up and preach what he said is okay if I preach a little while we got people today that claim their fallen brother brandham and they're hiding behind his tapes and instead of being real men and taking this Bible and standing against evil spirits that try to move in a church and they preach against women cutting hair and makeup and all the Fashions of the age the the men of God stand there and do that and they take the criticism themselves for standing with what a prophet said about it but it would be much easier just to play a tape and go over and hide somewhere and act like brother bandam didn't say it but he did say it and we're responsible in this generation amen as the ministry come on now there is a brooding logos in the Pulpit telling the bride amen you're not there in justification you're not there in sanctification you're not there in the Reformation of your gifts but the person of Christ has come down into this age to be manifested by the word in his church well I might as well I've went this far now let me tell you that's the truth brother Steven is it the truth a year ago I told you what God was going to do yes sir Ronnie said sitting there as a witness we left this room and we walked in the back and the Holy Spirit spoke through me and told me because of the spirit you have taken towards this transition God's going to bless you above measure amen your ministry has been blessed more a year this last year than it ever has been yes sir you say is that because of you brother wank no it's what God's doing it's the moving of the Holy Spirit if you resist that you find yourself resisting the brooding of the Holy Ghost amen now amen what the Holy Spirit brooding brooding over the church he's standing brother bam said in the midst of the church revealing who he is in the last age he calls himself the author of the creation and this is another creation this has to do with the church this has to do with a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own Bride As the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells which were in the body was born and I want to repeat he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human uh egg that's supplied by Mary that would have been a sinful mankind producing body they would not have produced the last Adam now watch brother brandom he'll say it like this he was the New Creation man and God met and joined he was the first of new race he was the head he was the head of the new race amen he was the head he was the beginning the first born from the dead and in 2 Corinthians 5 it said any man that's in Christ is a new creation is it brother man said New Birth means creation see it's a new creation there you can see it man was of the old order of creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God in Ephesians 2 and: 10 for we have his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus Ephesians 2:10 so that you can see where I'm at Heath created us in Christ Jesus we are not our own work it is the work of the creative logos thank you Jesus look at this it's powerful amen see now what happens brother bam says it's an evolution first thing God created like he created botney life then he created animal life then he created human life kind of Evolution Rising higher and so as it been God in his church justification pulling the bride out now he's creating his bride justification sanctification under Wesley so forth you see the evolution of the spirit being given more and more cu the body is building coming to the head which is Christ now in 65 and see not AB the shook now that same logos has has a part are we together that same logos has a part he's got a bride and that same logos the word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to full manifestation oh goodness amen do you see what it was God planted it on the day of Pentecost God planted it brother bam said a holy ghost seed on the day of Pentecost he said back to that real Holy Ghost back to the gospel message back to Acts 2 see to a formula to Where it All Began at now in the original see Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning NOW Watch What Happens he said now how are you going to teach a man to speak in tongues how are you going to teach a man to cast out Devils with power how you going to teach a man to do these things Jesus said he would how you going to teach a man to be able to stand on the platform and for tell things coming and things as it will be how you going to teach him that you can't it's a gift of God when we get away from that we've got into a hybrid condition we're back just see we got to go back to the beginning now question brother bam ask us he said I'd like science to answer this one is there such a thing as Evolution as they claim he said then why don't something rise higher than a man sir now we're not just talking about 6,000 years now watch where he goes why don't something rise higher than a man a species higher than a man because he's in the image of God nothing can go beyond its creator why can't we produce something in our ethics or in our education in our seminaries that will beat what they had at Pentecost now look why can't we get a church better than the original Pentecost through educa if see if that's how it came but the prophet saying you can't get higher than the Creator the creator of Pentecost was God himself he split himself in the pillar of fire and came down in the upper room and you'll never get higher than God coming into the church it don't go higher than that there's no life higher than that there's no Society higher than that there's no tongue higher than that there's no gift higher than that when God comes down into a church and quickens what's going on in the inside of you amen there's nothing goes higher than that it's a Pentecost we need the Holy Ghost and the mythical body formed upon this Earth that's the way it was at the beginning it breeds itself back it breeds itself back oh God bred his church back to the Holy Ghost again see what it does it breeds out the unbelief it breeds out the nonsense it breeds out the darkness it breeds out the intellect it breeds out the education God's not bringing that in amen the brooding logos is breeding that out of you 40 years Moses spent with teachers but God had to bring him to the pillar of fire to need to know what he knew God's breeding that out of man see because there'll never be nothing greater than God in a man there'll be nothing greater than when a man comes to the Holy Ghost when you get the human element out of a man when you get the education of a man when you get the knowledge out of a man and he just becomes a channel for almighty God Jesus said say you un this mountain and it shall be moved burn out the human element and see God working you like you've never seen him before when the human element goes out now these direct quotes when you get the hybrid out amen isn't it odd brother B said you'll never breed hybrid back by hybrid you'll never to take too two hybrids and get original the only way to get it back to the original is the one that created it and the only way will'll ever have another book of Acts is the one that created the book of Acts has got to come back into the church amen and breath out every other opinion and when the Holy Ghost came and he took a hold of men and that's when God began to move like he moved in those days because it was bred out of them it just wasn't in them to disbelieve how's it going to happen they didn't know they didn't know how to make it happen they wasn't there to make it happen but they knew God had came into them look what the scripture says in Matthew 24 and 24 or Matthew 24 it says where the carcass is there the Eagles we'll be gathered together now watch very carefully how brother bradam places scripture it it's it's phenomenal as God rich in Mercy he says that he bore them On Eagle's Wings to himself so there's a destination where you're going you didn't you didn't just take off on an endless Journey here there's a destination okay now the way I'm preaching you think well he don't believe in education or for for your school and for your jobs and all that don't don't go there y'all know better than that I my son's in school and I encourage anybody to go to school these men has to make livings you go to school and enjoy yourself I I'm talking about the gospel okay now what we're looking at is the eagle it gathers unto himself now where the carcass is there the Eagles now that carcass in Matthew 24 they asked brother brand they said what is that carcass he said that's Christ yes sir that's the word of the season so the eagle carries them into the feeding of the season now it's it's amazing to me because we're talking about creation of bride we're talking about a bride who the Lost has a part in this age that God's moving the church towards that Perfection where the carcass is there are the Eagles now if you go down here and you look in Revelation chapter 4 there are four different creatures there's an ox there's a lion there's a man and all of them are Earthly creatures yes sir every one of those are bound in the Earth but that fourth one is a flying eagle so when you go to the Bible in second Peter it builds a statue of a perfect man it brings you into a pyramid which Christ himself's going to cap off now that capping of that pyramid is divine intelligence that's God himself the one who put the cactus you know you ever been out to Arizona and you've been down to Tucson I had to go there to see it because I didn't understand it brother Brown was talking about but you have down in Tucson you got these cactuses and you have all this heat and then you go on Mount Lemon which is just a drive it's literally you can stand in Tucson and look up I always thought when he said that in power transformation he was talking about Flagstaff way up the hill and I'm thinking man that's a long ways up there brother random boy he says it but he's talking about Mount Lemon and you standing in in Tucson and there's cactuses 30 minutes later you can be up on top of that mountain and there's Sherman Pines big old Tall Pine trees geography same location atmosphere changes same location come on on geography is different same same geography different atmosphere so watch a Divine intelligence knew this could grow here in this atmosphere but this one can grow up there in this atmosphere now as the Church of the Living God we're not living in the bottom of the pyramid with a lion with an ox with a man they're all Earthbound atmospheres right but the eagle was a flying eagle he's the one in the top of the mountain the eagle anointing is the move of God in this generation now watch the eagle himself is a revealer of the word so Revelation is the move of God in this generation that's why Paul said be you transformed by the renewing of your mind amen same geography but come up higher get in Divine intelligence climb out now the reason I hit education and I hit knowledge and I hit human knowledge and I hit psychology the reason I hit all these things so hard because most if any of you are trapped that's what's trapping you it's it's what you know about yourself it's what happened to you since you were a child and you become a you become a sum total of your experiences and your failures and your mistakes and your complexes and they become like like a sack on top of you and they're holding and you're leaning to that wondering why can't I climb higher because you're standing there under your own knowledge but you've reached a summit there but right beside you is an eagle revelation that you come from God you were a seed of God to begin with you were anointed to be the bride to begin with and the god the brooding logos never quit on you and I'll tell you why he never quits on you because he has a purpose he has an anointing he has something for your life and the eagle keeps brooding and brooding and brooding until he's coming coming coming come to yourself you ever wonder why Jesus said in John 14 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you said see me for I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age and Paul said that you are sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said not from revival to Revival but unto the day of redemption in other words whoever got in your ship is going to take you to the other side and there's not enough Devils there's not enough hell there's not enough intellect there's not enough knowledge that could ever sink the boat that God has set upon the waters of Life the brooding logos it's saying come on Bride come on come on to Perfection see you got a thought about you but if you could come to God's thought about you have you ever wondered why Abraham had no mistakes in the New Testament it was after the blood right but you see there was no mistakes after that but watch in the New Testament your mistakes I tell you what I got shout a fit right now this was written before you were born this was written before the Book of Life this was written before your mistakes this was written before your troubles the prophecy your life didn't include the mistake he said just forget your knowledge forget your education forget your idea come to [Applause] me I I don't know any better way to explain it than the way brother Bram explains it in the eagle story and he says Mama eagle gets up off her nest knowing she had one remember that and he said it was down in the chicken yard amen that that baby was down in the chicken yard he said Mama Eagle comes after it and she begins to scream now watch this she never ever sounded like a chicken and Chloe when the eagle found baby eagle he had no record of what had happened from the time it left the nest to the time it heard the scream it completely was not involved in what God was doing and whatever has happened from the time of your birth amen till God finds you has nothing to do with what God can do with a man woman or child let me say this this morning get over yourself get up out of that bottle of pity and get back to serving God like You' never done it before may I say to you rise up like an eagle this morning and fly back in the presence of God lay your complexes aside lay the the hurts and the abuses and the troubles lay them aside oh [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah thank you Lord From The Garden of Eden David it was promised I'll have a son isn't it amazing that M Kan that come to Abraham's door isn't it when Abraham was to have a son it was mecdc that came to Abraham because that son wouldn't be a son of Abraham it would be a Son of God but it would be known through the Flesh of Abraham as Abraham's seed that's why Paul said as being according to the flesh he was the seed of David but according to Spirit he was the power of God he was the son of God that was not Jesus that spoke to Abraham but Johnny it's one of the most powerful Revelations sir that was the Eternal logos that had picked up a body there was dust on his shoes and there was dust on his clothes amen are you hearing me God the Eternal Loos come down yes sir to have his feet washed a man how do we know it was him Abraham called him Lord Paul called him a man without beginning of days or ending of life amen look and when he washed his feet he read his heart and told him now we know it's the word that's a discerner of the thought and tent of the heart the word in the flesh good good and shortly after this happened there come forth a son Isaac through the body change of Abraham and Sarah God in theophany visited Abraham to have a son yes sir now this that we have seen in the last day is not the man Jesus but that same mdic became Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ in a supernatural body stepped into this generation and borrowed a body he borrowed a sex born body who had complexes he was from a poor family he was unliked he had no good clothes lived in a poor house come on Church his his upbringing was so bad that he hated women because of the immorality he didn't come from a a clean church family but MDC had cleansed by the blood a way to take a hold of a man and to lift him back to the same place that through the message of the hour could come a Church of the Living God isn't it something that it was built all the way up through the Old Testament but here comes mdct in the end time that when the son who was being birthed back there under Abraham is supposed to be birthed in this hour a bride seed a queen seed a royal seed don't you put that in another age brother Jaden it's not a time that we can say well Paul can do it or Martin can do it or brother Brandon can do it or oh God's going to have some great somebody come someday this is our season amen Shelby it's our season it's our day it's our the logos of God keeps brooding over your life because amen amen amen oh thank you Jesus it is that great it is that great Eagle here's the beauty I will bear you un Eagle's Wings unto myself and in John 14 he says it clearly he said I'll go away I will come again and receive you unto myself y the same one that said I'll go said I'll come right and I'll receive you to myself my brother Seth that's a very high place that's why the that's why the brooding logos doesn't stop Hallelujah that's it brother Guth that's why he said I will bring you he's determined he's going to keep doing this sir yes sir brother Aston he's not going to quit brother Greg we can give him all the we can give him excuses I I've been I I I I probably ought to just show y'all sometime my excuse list somebody else is better preacher somebody else is better versed somebody else has more understanding somebody else has more kindness somebody has more wisdom you can push this on somebody else but God didn't choose somebody else he keeps brooding brother Carrie that's that's that's what got your attention we want Under the Sun we we want under it we shout this is one of the shouting his churches and I'm so proud of y'all for that my Lord I love y'all for that but you got to stay under the anointing yes sir makes you Sons makes you daughters it keeps brooding it keeps brooding yes sir I feel like I feel like I'm out of time so I'm just going to close here it keeps brooding than you Lord see now it would be easier okay it would be easier at times just to wide somebody up and throw them away that that would be easier wouldn't it oh when you get that when you get that young man you know and they not brother brother David knows what I'm talking about it'd be easier just to say hey I can't deal with this but as a father we have responsibility to deal with it yes sir There's issues that comes in church so well I'd rather not deal with that but as responsibility is to hold the message over over the people as a mother it's a responsibility to hold it over your children do you see that you you you it's it's God bringing he just keeps bringing the church he just keeps bringing it to this point yes Lord so he keeps brooding over it and and I know we get to the point we honestly do where we would throw away ourselves we would we' just say hey look you know I messed this up or I've said this or I've did this and it would be easier to quit than fix it we're dealing with human beings Souls lives it's not easier to quit than fix and God has got a plan for every individual in this room and he's brooding over you because he didn't ask you when he wrote it in here that's true you don't have a list of excuses next to I will have a church without spot a wrinkle except if they amen it's not there folks it's not written there because he's a determined sculptor he knows what he can do he already done it in the earth and he's doing it in you this morning you said preacher what can I do yield your will to him yield your life to him and say Lord I'm tired of thinking that about myself Hallelujah I'm tired of feeling that way about my own calling I'm tired of feeling that way about my position in you Lord I'm ready to receive what you said about me you said I'm a word bride I'm a word bride now I I don't amen as our musicians come I'll say this to you right now you don't realize that God has been working on this single point for 6,000 years but before Eden ever fa he already knew where he would be coming to in the last days right right can you imagine taking 6,000 years to preach a sermon for one point oh yeah and you use you know preachers are bad to use examples to get a different point we use different people and you know your after but God through the entire Testament of scripture he's been pulling Moses and Aaron Levi he pulled all these points to come to this climax thought that he wouldn't unveil until the very end sister Gail the reality of this is Brother Bram said what was in the back part of his mind is now in you think of that so you ready to trade that thought for your thought right but Tom you ready ready to make a trade this morning yeah good when you start trading all of a sudden you start highing flying higher going high going high going higher thank youus the brooding logo I'm sorry I I ain't preached none of my notes this morning it's really not note it's on my heart he's brooding but Gabe ain't you glad but you know what you're no less the Son of God when you were out of church and you are right now amen not any less do you know that God can't love you any more right now than he did then he said he loved you when yet you were a sinner he died for you and with his great love he loved you and that was Mercy Mercy Won't Let You Go Mercy won't quit on you Noah Mercy won't quit folks that's right Hallelujah man that message is tough on me Mercy won't quit am Hallelujah so spread your [Music] wngs little and fly you are BN for the valley oh you were for the sky let you tri you down oh drive your spirit to so mount [Music] little and oh I love it don't you so spread [Music] your won't you stand to your feet with us this morning you forley Hallelujah you to sore the sky let your Tri get oh Tri to the ground thank you Lord [Music] oh
