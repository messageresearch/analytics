[0:01] Look at somebody. Look at your
[0:02] neighbor's cards. Prayer card number
[0:05] four and number 19. All right. Just a
[0:10] moment. Wait. See, if I don't call him,
[0:13] then I get a rebound on that. You see
[0:15] what I say?
[0:17] What? Say
[0:18] &gt;&gt; you got four. What about no 19 yet?
[0:22] &gt;&gt; What? Say
[0:24] &gt;&gt; prayer card number four isn't in yet. Or
[0:27] 19. If somebody's got them cards, if you
[0:30] would come on in the line or look see if
[0:32] may has that little baby got a card.
[0:35] Check. It's not that that's not the
[0:37] number. Has this lady here got a card in
[0:39] this wheelchair? Check her number. Is
[0:41] that Is that her number? A lady on a
[0:43] cop? Huh?
[0:44] &gt;&gt; They got it. They It's all in now. Okay.
[0:46] All right.
[0:48] Now, now you people's got a prayer card.
[0:50] Hold them. We're going to minister by
[0:52] the grace of God. Now friends, this
[0:56] being
[0:57] the last night that we'll have tomorrow
[0:59] is Sunday afternoon, let's quieten
[1:01] ourselves. Now just take every unbelief
[1:04] you've got and every ever every
[1:07] unreasonable thought and lay it down on
[1:10] the floor and put your foot on it as it
[1:12] was. Say, "Lord Jesus, I'm going to
[1:15] believe you."
[1:17] &gt;&gt; How many will do that?
[1:20] Thank you. God bless you. Now don't go
[1:22] unle. Sit real still and believe. Watch
[1:26] this away. And now look
[1:33] the identification of God has always
[1:37] been knowing can foresee what has been
[1:40] and tell what has been. How's that? Or
[1:43] what will be? We know that. That's how
[1:45] the prophets was known. That's how Jesus
[1:47] was known as Messiah. And he's the same
[1:49] Messiah today as he was then only
[1:52] without a corporal body here on earth.
[1:55] He sent his spirit back to use your
[1:57] body, my body.
[2:02] Now you might not be able to do this. We
[2:05] know in the scripture there's one in a
[2:08] generation. But see, but
[2:11] yet you can believe it and you got other
[2:13] things that you can do. Everybody, what
[2:15] if my finger decides because it's not my
[2:17] eye, it ain't going to be my finger no
[2:18] more? What if this arm says I ain't
[2:20] going to raise up no more because if I'm
[2:21] not an eye or ear, I ain't going to be
[2:23] an arm. Why did it my body? You
[2:27] be what God put you to be?
[2:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; How many times have I admired or
[2:32] Roberts, Billy Graham, Tommy Osbor, some
[2:34] of those men walk in there and say,
[2:36] "Glory to God. Believe it." Bulldog
[2:39] faith. Walk away. Walk out there just as
[2:41] fresh as they can be. Billy Graham,
[2:43] stand with a message and speak to the
[2:45] people a few minutes. Say, make your
[2:46] decision. Come to the altar. Just stand
[2:48] there. Never make another move. He said,
[2:50] "So why you do that?" Billy said, "My
[2:52] message went forth. It come from God."
[2:54] That's right.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; He's That's Sodom Church just exactly
[2:57] what's supposed to be. His name ending
[2:59] with Ham
[3:01] from Abraham. Six letters. Abraham is
[3:04] seven. See the messenger of that church
[3:07] &gt;&gt; down there in Babylon. certainly is not
[3:09] a man the country got a hold on that
[3:10] message of repentance like Billy Graham.
[3:12] He stands there, walks away from there
[3:14] and go eat a T-bone steak and go to bed,
[3:16] drink a mold of milk, it's all right
[3:18] when you have to stand and fight devils.
[3:21] One time on Long Beach, Brother Jack and
[3:24] I, your father was standing there. There
[3:26] stood Mr. Fuller, Charles Fuller, fine
[3:30] brother, stand there preaching about two
[3:33] or three thousand people in there that
[3:34] afternoon. We sat and listened at his
[3:36] meeting. And I had the auditorium rented
[3:38] after him and he stood there and made a
[3:40] fine talk and said, "Anybody here wanted
[3:42] to accept Christ?" Two or three people
[3:44] come down for dedication of their
[3:45] babies. One woman said she wanted to
[3:47] accept it. Come up and offer a little
[3:49] prayer. One of the deacons went back and
[3:50] sat down, shook hands, turned around,
[3:52] walked out. There was his intellectual
[3:55] fine dressed group of people walking
[3:57] out. Here come mine in straight jackets,
[4:01] wheelchairs, blind, lame halt. when your
[4:04] faith faces something like that. Now
[4:06] here, what have I claimed Christ to be
[4:10] and now unbelievers sitting around
[4:14] wanting to find one flaw?
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Just trying to find one flaw. I remember
[4:20] you're not long ago in Toronto. We're
[4:22] standing there preaching, praying for
[4:24] the sick. I kept feeling an odd spirit.
[4:26] He's sitting over to my left. I kept
[4:27] watching it. There's a man sitting
[4:29] there, a bunch of hardy coming in there
[4:30] to hypnotize me. He'd go around to army
[4:33] camps and make soldiers get on their uh
[4:35] hands and bark like dogs and things.
[4:37] Hypnotism. I felt that evil spirit. I
[4:39] didn't know where it was coming from. I
[4:40] kept watching. I seen that dark shadow.
[4:42] I waited just a few minutes. I said,
[4:44] "You child of Satan. Why is the devil
[4:47] blinded your mind to something like
[4:48] that?" Because you come to take over
[4:51] God, challenge God's spirit. They'll
[4:53] pack you out of here. He paralyzed right
[4:56] there in his seat and still paralyzed.
[4:59] We don't play church. How many's been in
[5:01] meetings and see similar things happen?
[5:02] You know, things that takes place. Sure.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Remember
[5:11] the Reverend
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Now, here's I suppose the first person.
[5:16] Is that right?
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Now, see, I preach told you exactly what
[5:20] was supposed to happen in this day. Now,
[5:24] that is
[5:26] a sign if it happens. That's what the
[5:28] sign was. then believe the voice that
[5:30] follows the sign.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Now, here's a woman exactly to you
[5:34] newcomers. This is St. John 4 where our
[5:38] Lord Jesus met a woman at the well.
[5:41] They've never met before in life. And he
[5:44] told the woman what her trouble was and
[5:46] she recognized that that was the
[5:48] Messiah. You know the story.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; Here it is again. A man and woman meets.
[5:52] Now, she's not the woman. I'm not that
[5:54] man. But that's still the same God.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus said, "The works that I do
[6:00] shall you do also." St. John 14:12.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Now, lady,
[6:06] not knowing you, I have no idea what
[6:09] you're standing there for. It might be
[6:11] domestic trouble. It might be for
[6:13] somebody else. Maybe you're sick. Maybe
[6:15] it's maybe you're standing there just
[6:17] putting on something. If it is, just
[6:19] find out what happens.
[6:21] Maybe you're impersonating something.
[6:23] Whatever it is, I don't You may be a
[6:25] genuine believer that I don't know, but
[6:28] God does. But you'll know whether he
[6:30] told you the truth or not, won't you? If
[6:31] it's the truth, you'll know it.
[6:35] Now, see, that's what your faith has got
[6:36] to. How would you like to come here?
[6:38] Now, if anybody believes it's wrong, you
[6:40] come here and take this patient. Come
[6:41] here, take the rest of them.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Then, if you won't do it,
[6:49] &gt;&gt; then don't condemn me.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[6:54] Now look here, sister. Just a minute.
[6:57] Now I have no idea nothing about you.
[6:59] You're just a woman standing there. Now
[7:01] if the Lord Jesus Christ, the son of
[7:03] God, who I have proven by the Bible,
[7:07] promised that he would return in the
[7:08] last days and reveal himself in the
[7:11] fullness of his spirit. Just like the
[7:12] church coming up like it comes from a
[7:14] human being all the way from the feet
[7:15] comes up the thighs up to the head. In
[7:18] the head is the head of the body. And
[7:19] the body's come up ever since the first
[7:21] church. come right on up in this in the
[7:23] reformations has come up to now it's
[7:26] come through justification
[7:27] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:29] now is the head Christ coming to the
[7:30] body
[7:32] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ he's the one who
[7:34] knows my hand don't know to act just by
[7:36] my hand but he is the one who knows
[7:39] that's reason he is the word I'm not the
[7:42] word I'm a man but you see he uses this
[7:45] body because he died to sanctify this
[7:47] body that he might use it and give a
[7:49] gift just like pulling it out of gear
[7:51] Then the Holy Spirit takes over. Then if
[7:54] he will describe or tell you what you've
[7:57] done, what you're here for, or something
[7:59] about you, you'll believe it. And the
[8:01] audience will believe the same.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; May the Lord God grant it. I take every
[8:07] spirit in here under my control for the
[8:10] glory of God. But sit still.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Don't move around.
[8:15] Look here just a moment. Look on me as
[8:17] Peter and John said, "Pass through the
[8:18] gate." In other words, just pay
[8:19] attention to what I'm saying. See, Jesus
[8:22] asked the woman a few questions. Bring
[8:23] me a drink. See, I've been preaching.
[8:26] Same thing. The father sent me up here
[8:29] to to Baton Rouge.
[8:32] I'm here. Father said he had need to go
[8:34] by Samaria. He sat there. A woman was
[8:37] the first one come up to him. He done
[8:40] that one sign on that woman and the
[8:41] whole city repented. What a difference.
[8:44] You think of you do the same thing
[8:45] tonight. You think all Baton Rouge would
[8:47] repent? I doubt that. Aren't you true? I
[8:50] certainly do. But we're in the last days
[8:52] when evil is more evil than ever was
[8:55] known.
[8:57] Now, your conditions, you're here to be
[9:00] prayed for. Exactly. Right. And you're
[9:03] suffering with a throat condition.
[9:06] That's right. Raise up your hand.
[9:09] Not only that, but there's somebody that
[9:11] you're praying for. It's a child, and
[9:15] that child has a throat condition. And
[9:17] it is the condition of the child's
[9:19] throat is gross in the throat. You
[9:22] believe that God will heal him too.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; That handkerchief that's in your hand
[9:27] that you've raised up to God as a
[9:28] witness. Don't doubt it now. Go and lay
[9:31] the handkerchief on the child.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt with all your heart. God
[9:35] will heal both of you. Make
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Can you do that? May you go and the Lord
[9:40] be with you.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; How do you do?
[9:46] We are strangers too.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[9:53] &gt;&gt; That's the sign.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Now the voice is returned to the word.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Don't know you. He does. If he'll tell
[10:06] me something about you, then you'll
[10:08] believe that word that I said will be
[10:10] vindicated. That's the That's a
[10:12] vindication of it.
[10:15] I said he'd done it. That's prophesying.
[10:18] Now, if the prophecy comes to pass then
[10:21] he said you're
[10:24] you got an extreme nervous condition
[10:26] that you're suffering with nervousness
[10:27] and you've got a tumor and the tumor is
[10:30] on your leg. It's right, isn't it? How
[10:32] do you believe? Then go on your road and
[10:35] believe and as you have believe, so will
[10:36] it be on your
[10:39] How do you do? I do not know you. But
[10:43] God does know you. Do you believe that
[10:45] God can tell me your troubles?
[10:48] Look on me.
[10:54] You have troubles, but you're really
[10:56] standing here for

[16:52] a line in the sand. I want to be
[16:56] standing by your side,
[17:00] holding your hand.
[17:04] So let your kingdom come.
[17:08] Let it live in me. This is my pray.
[17:15] This is my plea.

[18:46] Father, I see a bright rejoicing
[18:51] in a song of vtory. Every chain, every

[20:19] God bless you tonight.
[20:22] God bless you tonight. Amen. We want to
[20:25] welcome you to the fifth annual True
[20:27] Word Youth Camp. Uh how many are here
[20:30] for the first time? Uh we're so happy to
[20:32] have you. Uh just uh just another
[20:35] wonderful turnout, wonderful support
[20:38] that we've had. Uh last I counted we had
[20:41] 66 or more churches represented here. So
[20:44] we're just thankful for the fellowship.
[20:46] We appreciate the trust that has been
[20:48] given by families and churches and
[20:50] pastors uh to send you here. We want to
[20:53] take good care of you while you're here.
[20:55] Amen. And uh we we just want to we want
[20:58] to be a blessing to you. Uh we're here
[21:00] to try to keep the revival fires burning
[21:03] &gt;&gt; in another generation of young message
[21:05] believers. Brother Bram said that every
[21:08] fresh and true revival
[21:11] is uh when men get back to the word for
[21:14] their day.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So certainly our vision uh
[21:18] tonight, what we want to point you to uh
[21:20] as a new generation of believers uh is
[21:24] not to uh it's not to any church. It's
[21:27] not to any ministry.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; It's not to any personality, any gift.
[21:32] We want to point you to the message of
[21:33] the hour.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. to us. It's not a dead letter. It
[21:37] is the quickened, revealed Lord Jesus
[21:40] Christ. It's the light. Amen.
[21:44] It's the same pillar of fire that led
[21:47] God's children from the beginning. And
[21:50] uh so we want to lift it high. That's uh
[21:52] that's just our vision. That's our goal
[21:54] is to is to point young people to the
[21:57] message of the hour. Unadulterated,
[21:59] pure, lifted up high. Amen. and uh and
[22:03] make sure that that we're connecting our
[22:06] young people not to not to uh not to a
[22:10] ministry, not to a church, not even to
[22:12] ours.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because those things will fail,
[22:14] but to but to uh put you on a foundation
[22:19] &gt;&gt; of the revealed word of God. So, we want
[22:22] to see our young people connected to the
[22:23] source.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Connected to the source. I'll tell you
[22:26] what, if you leave this place, if you
[22:28] don't dance a step, if you never shout a
[22:31] lick,
[22:32] &gt;&gt; if you don't feel a thing, but if you go
[22:34] home from this camp meeting and you
[22:36] begin to form a relationship with the
[22:38] message of the hour, you begin to play
[22:40] it in your home, you begin to put uh
[22:42] study it. Amen. Then uh we'll we'll
[22:45] we'll be grateful. Amen. We it'll be
[22:47] mission accomplished. But you know,
[22:48] there's something that Brother Bram
[22:49] said. He said, "The angel of the Lord
[22:51] accompanies the message always."
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're just in expectation
[22:56] tonight. We're not here for a dry-eyed
[22:58] lecture. We're not here for a
[22:59] ritualistic gathering. But I believe as
[23:01] the message of the hour is preached with
[23:03] liberty and with with balance. Amen. And
[23:06] with purity. Amen. That we will see a
[23:09] supernatural God doing supernatural
[23:11] works. Amen. Uh because you know this
[23:14] word is Christ. It's who he is. Brother
[23:16] Brandham said, "How could you stand in
[23:17] the wind and not feel it blowing against
[23:19] you? How could you get in the water and
[23:20] not get wet?" Amen. He said, "Wind is
[23:23] windy, water's wet, and God is
[23:26] supernatural." Amen. So, how many would
[23:28] like to see a supernatural God come down
[23:31] and do supernatural things? Amen. For
[23:34] our young people, we're expecting that.
[23:35] I I expect liberated worship. I expect
[23:39] the miraculous. I expect healing. I
[23:41] expect salvation. I expect deliverance.
[23:43] I expect the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[23:46] I expect people, amen, that have come
[23:48] one way will leave altogether different.
[23:51] Amen. change forever in the presence of
[23:53] God. That's the what we're expecting
[23:55] tonight. Amen. That's that's why we have
[23:57] gathered. You know, there's uh as we've
[23:59] said, there's a cost that comes with
[24:00] fellowship. When we come together for a
[24:02] big meeting like this, you know,
[24:04] somebody will sing a song maybe that you
[24:06] don't like or the preacher might preach
[24:08] something a little different than what
[24:09] you've heard or a situation may not be
[24:12] handled the way that you would have
[24:13] handled it. And those kind of things
[24:14] happen, but that's the cost of
[24:16] fellowship. Amen. But if we could look
[24:18] over that and one young heart could be
[24:20] changed, one young life could be
[24:22] touched, wouldn't it be worth it? Amen.
[24:25] How many willing to just bind our hearts
[24:26] together, say, "Lord, may you come and
[24:29] do things of eternal value this
[24:31] weekend?" How many have a need in your
[24:33] life? Amen. Amen. Well, uh, how many
[24:37] know God is able
[24:38] &gt;&gt; to meet that need to speak a word
[24:40] directly to you by the inspiration of
[24:43] the Holy Spirit? We sure appreciate our
[24:45] ministry, Brother Andrew Glover, Brother
[24:47] Josh Bennett for being with us again.
[24:49] We're just looking forward to great
[24:51] things in the presence of God. Amen. One
[24:55] mind. Can we get in one mind,
[24:57] &gt;&gt; one accord?
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, may you move. May you have
[25:01] your way." Amen. Well, then turn to your
[25:04] neighbor and greet somebody and say,
[25:05] "It's camp meeting time. Let's have
[25:08] church tonight." Amen.
[25:11] [Music]
[25:14] We're just going to open in a word of
[25:15] prayer and move forward with the
[25:17] worship.
[25:19] Lord Jesus,
[25:21] Lord, we've gathered together,
[25:24] Lord, to come from all different walks
[25:26] of life, many different places,
[25:29] Lord, but our desire tonight is to make
[25:32] you the preeminent one in this place.
[25:35] Lift you higher, Lord. so high, Lord,
[25:38] that we would fade into the background,
[25:40] fade into oneness with you, Lord. Our
[25:43] our hearts are one, Lord, with a desire
[25:46] to see you come and touch lives, change
[25:50] lives, Lord, minister to hearts.
[25:53] So, Lord, uh we we were in one accord,
[25:56] Father, as your children were in that
[25:59] upper room, Lord. And I'll pray as your
[26:01] prophet prayed,
[26:04] Lord, that you would send the Holy Ghost
[26:07] down into this meeting, Father, like
[26:09] that rushing mighty wind. But as he
[26:11] prayed, Lord, may it not not so much
[26:13] shake the building, but may you shake
[26:14] our hearts. And Lord, just shake us,
[26:17] Lord, out of the dullness, Lord, of of
[26:19] our coldness and our lukewarmness,
[26:21] Father. Lord, shake out every formal
[26:24] spirit, Lord. Every veil of tradition,
[26:26] Lord, that would keep us from a real
[26:28] experience in your presence. And and
[26:31] Father, may you just come and have your
[26:33] way in this meeting. I pray that each of
[26:35] us, Lord, would just be anointed in our
[26:37] own position, Father. That Lord, you
[26:39] would take every instrument in your
[26:40] hands, Lord, and work it together, Lord,
[26:43] to play out the great symphony. Put us
[26:45] in harmony, Lord, of spirit, Lord. put
[26:48] us in in a Christian fellowship and
[26:50] oneness with one another, Lord, that we
[26:52] could just be out of your way. That's
[26:54] the desire, Lord, of of of the ministry,
[26:57] of the laborers, Lord, of the campers,
[26:59] Lord, of everyone that's gathered here,
[27:01] Lord. Let there be nothing in me. Let
[27:04] there be nothing in these people,
[27:05] Father, that would hinder you. But may
[27:07] you clear every channel, Lord. Let let
[27:09] the life Lord which lays in this word
[27:13] Lord which you have swed into this age
[27:15] let it come down the channel and bring
[27:17] life into us. May you manifest yourself
[27:19] amongst us this weekend. We give you
[27:21] liberty to move Lord. We're looking for
[27:23] your leadership Lord. Our programs Lord
[27:26] are not a form Lord but we are subject
[27:29] to you Lord and your inspiration and we
[27:31] just ask that you would come Lord and be
[27:33] our Lord and be the preeminent one
[27:35] amongst us. May you get the glory in
[27:37] every word and deed, Father. And may
[27:40] Lord, you you bring a mighty outpouring
[27:43] of the Holy Spirit onto this young
[27:45] generation and equip them, Father, for
[27:48] the battles ahead, Lord, because we know
[27:51] that soon and very soon, Lord. We are
[27:53] coming to the change, the quickening of
[27:56] these mortal bodies. We ask, Father, you
[27:59] would fill the place, Lord. Fill this
[28:02] house. Fill each vessel, Lord. Fill each
[28:04] heart with your spirit, Lord, and and
[28:09] move in a mighty way amongst us. We love
[28:11] you, Lord. We're here to worship you.
[28:14] We're here to give you preeminence,
[28:16] Lord, and yield to the moving of your
[28:18] Holy Spirit. Come, Lord. We not only
[28:21] welcome you, invite you, Lord, but we
[28:23] want to make you welcome in the name of
[28:25] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you.

[46:40] in that moment. Jesus gives a hold of
[46:45] you.
[46:50] This one's for anyone who knows the

[47:37] chance

[47:50] washing. If I run
[47:55] from a past that he redeemed
[47:58] to the world I must go crazy.

[49:30] just no telling what you're going to do.
[49:36] In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[49:41] you.
[49:43] Oh
[49:46] my
[49:48] eras
[49:50] my name
[49:52] changes.

[50:27] to the world. I might go crazy.
[50:31] There's just no telling what you're

[50:42] you.
[50:45] Oh,

[50:51] there's just no telling what you're
[50:54] going to do.
[50:58] Oh,
[51:01] in that moment Jesus gets a hold of you.
[51:15] How many can testify of that? How many
[51:18] witnesses do we have in the building
[51:20] tonight that have been touched by the
[51:21] fire of God? Amen. How many can testify
[51:24] here tonight that there's no telling
[51:26] what you might do? Amen. In the presence
[51:28] of God. That's one place we all want to
[51:31] be tonight. Amen. Amen. Want to say God
[51:34] bless you all tonight. It is a real
[51:36] honor to be here at the TWWT camp once
[51:39] again. How many's here under great
[51:40] expectation?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that. Amen. I was just
[51:44] sitting there in the room today and
[51:46] pulled up on the campground and it's
[51:47] almost like you read the prophet of God
[51:49] when he talks about Jesus riding into
[51:51] town. He said there was so much
[51:53] expectation you could feel it in the
[51:55] air. And I tell you, if you step
[51:57] outside, you can feel it outside, but
[51:58] you can feel it inside tonight. Amen. To
[52:01] know that he's here. And he's here to do
[52:03] exactly what his word said he would do.
[52:05] Amen. Maybe before we open the word
[52:07] tonight on this first night, we could
[52:09] just approach him in prayer. And I know
[52:11] it's the uh first night of the camp, but
[52:13] it's not the uh first time we've ever
[52:15] been in his presence tonight. Let's just
[52:17] approach him. And maybe you have a a
[52:19] need upon your heart tonight, something
[52:20] you're desiring from the Lord. You want
[52:22] to put it before him tonight. Let's just
[52:24] talk to him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[52:27] your believers have gathered here this
[52:29] weekend, Lord, many have come from
[52:32] different places, Lord, as the Bible
[52:34] says from the east, from the west, from
[52:36] the north, from the south. But Lord,
[52:38] there's one thing that's drawn us here
[52:40] together. Lord, it's not a personality.
[52:43] It's not a idea, but Lord, it's the
[52:45] attraction of the hour. Father, your
[52:48] word said where the carcass is, there
[52:50] the eagles will be gathered together.
[52:52] And Lord, as I look across this building
[52:54] tonight, there's Lord hundreds of eagles
[52:56] gathered here tonight, Lord, as your
[52:58] prophet called them hungryhearted
[53:00] eagles. Father, Lord, we're not
[53:02] gathering here out of former fashion,
[53:03] but Lord, we're here desiring another
[53:06] Emus road walk with you, Lord. Father,
[53:08] that we would leave these meetings
[53:10] closer to you. As I heard our brother
[53:12] Nathan saying, Lord, that Father, we
[53:15] would leave here with a greater love for
[53:16] the message of the hour, a relationship
[53:18] with the person of this word. Now,
[53:21] Father, as we come tonight, we're asking
[53:22] you, may you drive out every spirit
[53:24] that's unlike the Holy Spirit. Lord, we
[53:27] don't know what these grounds have been
[53:28] used for, what ideas have been in this
[53:30] building since the last time we were
[53:32] here, but Lord, tonight we're asking you
[53:34] to consecrate this place, Lord. Father,
[53:37] may you sanctify it with your presence,
[53:39] dear God. And Lord, may you drive out
[53:41] every tormenting spirit that would try
[53:43] to hinder the the liberty of your word.
[53:45] Father, you see those that are in this
[53:47] building tonight. Lord, maybe some sick
[53:49] in their body. I pray tonight that
[53:51] divine healing would flow through that
[53:53] sick body, oh God. Lord, for some that
[53:55] may be bound here tonight, may
[53:57] deliverance come, Father. Lord, I pray
[53:59] that every believer that's gathered here
[54:01] with a desire upon their heart, Lord.
[54:04] Father, may this be the night that it
[54:06] would turn from a desire to a reality,
[54:08] oh God. Lord, may you open the windows
[54:10] of heaven, Lord, and fill this place
[54:12] this weekend with your glory. Father, we
[54:15] pray you forgive us of our failures.
[54:16] Forgive us of our shortcomings, Lord.
[54:19] Father, as we're turning now to your
[54:20] word. We know that you sent your word
[54:23] and your word healed the children. Now,
[54:25] Father, we commit this meeting this
[54:27] weekend, every aspect of it, Lord, into
[54:29] thy faithful hands. Come among us, Lord.
[54:31] We welcome you, Father. Lord, we don't
[54:33] just want to invite you here, dear God.
[54:35] We don't want you to just come and sit
[54:37] in the corner, Lord, but Father, we
[54:39] welcome you. We take all the restraints
[54:41] off, Lord. Father, see fit to move as
[54:44] you see. Lord, we love you tonight, God.
[54:47] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. And all
[54:50] the believers says,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God richly bless you
[54:54] tonight. If you have your Bibles while
[54:56] you're standing with us, we'll invite
[54:58] you in your scripture to the book of St.
[54:59] John the 18th chapter. And while you're
[55:02] turning there tonight, we want to thank
[55:04] brother Wayne and brother Ray and the
[55:06] the team here, Brother Nathan, Brother
[55:08] Ronnie, and all the workers here for
[55:10] this camp and the opportunity to be here
[55:12] once again. And amen, we just come here
[55:14] under great expectation of him. Amen. We
[55:17] just want tonight to look into the word
[55:18] in St. John chapter 18 and verse number
[55:23] 37.
[55:25] The Bible here says, "Pilate therefore
[55:28] said unto him, Art thou a king then?"
[55:32] And Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I
[55:35] am a king. To this end was I born, and
[55:38] for this cause came I into the world,
[55:41] that I should bear witness unto the
[55:43] truth. Everyone that is of the truth
[55:47] heareth my voice." Now Pilate saith unto
[55:50] him, "What is truth?" And when he had
[55:53] said this, he went out again unto the
[55:55] Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him
[55:58] no fault at all. Look at verse 39. But
[56:01] ye have a custom that I should release
[56:04] unto you one at the Passover. Will you
[56:06] therefore that I release unto you the
[56:08] king of the Jews? Now, I want you to
[56:10] notice how powerful their custom was.
[56:13] That they literally held on to their
[56:15] custom more than they did the word that
[56:17] was standing in front of them. For they
[56:20] had a custom. But notice verse 40. Then
[56:22] cried they all again, saying, "Not this
[56:24] man, but Barabbus." Now Barabbus was a
[56:28] robber. When Brother Brham reads that,
[56:30] he said, "No, they turned down Christ
[56:32] the anointed word." Amen. We ask Lord
[56:35] this evening to have the blessing to
[56:36] read of his word. As you can be seated
[56:38] here this afternoon, I I want you by the
[56:40] help of the Lord tonight if I would if I
[56:42] would take a title to speak to you
[56:44] tonight. I want to speak to you on this
[56:45] on this opening night of this youth
[56:47] camp. I want to talk to you about
[56:49] seizing your opportunity in his
[56:52] presence. Seizing your opportunity in
[56:55] his presence. In the book of Galatians
[56:56] chapter 6 and verse 10, Paul there
[56:59] writing, he said, "As we have therefore
[57:02] opportunity, let us do good unto all
[57:04] men, especially unto them who are of the
[57:07] household of faith." Now, uh when you
[57:10] look there at that word opportunity in
[57:12] the Greek, it means a measure of time.
[57:14] It is a larger or smaller portion of
[57:17] time. It is a fixed and definite time. I
[57:20] like this. It's the right time. Amen.
[57:23] Amen. It's the time when things are
[57:25] brought to crisis. It is the decisive
[57:28] Amen. epic waited for moment. So when
[57:31] something is an opportunity, amen. It's
[57:33] not an accident. It's not a it's not a
[57:36] happen stance, but it is a as an
[57:37] ordained moment of almighty God. And the
[57:40] prophet of God would say now in this
[57:42] hour this great crisis is on. We know
[57:44] that this nation is shaken. Not only the
[57:47] nation, but the world is shaken. It's at
[57:49] the end time. There's not another thing
[57:51] I know to happen, but the rapture, the
[57:54] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, it's
[57:56] already. See, and we see these
[57:59] gatherings. Oh, he said, "Get every
[58:01] benefit of this convention coming up.
[58:03] Get everything out of it that you can."
[58:06] Amen. That's of God. Here's a here's a
[58:08] prophet telling you, Amen. Don't waste a
[58:10] moment of this meeting. Now, I know this
[58:12] might have been a convention years ago,
[58:14] but I want to bring it right here
[58:16] tonight and say, Amen. Get everything
[58:18] out of this meeting that you can. If you
[58:20] haven't got the Holy Ghost, just put it
[58:22] in your mind that you're not going to
[58:25] leave here until you get it. Amen.
[58:27] That's the way to do it. Stay there cuz
[58:29] this might be your last opportunity.
[58:32] Amen. I want to say tonight that we are
[58:34] not here, amen, to bring the theology of
[58:37] the Bible among the people. We're not
[58:39] here, amen, to bring an idea or to bring
[58:41] a custom or to bring a tradition, but
[58:44] rather we're here to bring the living
[58:46] Christ among the people. And the prophet
[58:48] of God said, you know, there's something
[58:50] about spiritfilled people, amen, that
[58:53] recognizes the presence of God. He said,
[58:55] I don't know why it is, but it must be
[58:58] that they got something in them, amen,
[59:00] that magnetizes them to the spirit of
[59:03] God. Amen. When something of the spirit
[59:05] of God begins to move in your heart,
[59:08] There's something on the inside of you
[59:11] that's magnetized, amen, to the spirit
[59:13] of God that's moving. I want to say this
[59:15] tonight. I don't believe that you're
[59:17] just people, amen, of another camp
[59:19] opportunity or a natural opportunity.
[59:22] But rather, I believe we are the people
[59:24] of a divine opportunity. I think of the
[59:27] prophet of God would say we have
[59:28] opportunities, amen, that other ages
[59:31] have dreamed of having. Now, I want to
[59:33] ask you some questions here tonight.
[59:35] Amen. What have you done with your
[59:37] opportunities? Amen. What have you done,
[59:40] Amen, with your opportunities? What are
[59:42] you doing? Amen. With your opportunity
[59:45] now, Amen. And what will you do with
[59:47] your opportunity in the future? Amen.
[59:50] See, there's been opportunities in the
[59:52] past. Amen. There's opportunities in the
[59:55] present. Amen. And there's opportunities
[59:57] in the future. Brother said, "Oh,
[59:59] Christian, what an opportunity that we
[1:00:01] have. We have opportunities that St.
[1:00:04] Paul never dreamed of having that Enoch
[1:00:06] and Elijah. Amen. All them never had the
[1:00:09] opportunities. Amen. That we have now.
[1:00:12] See? Amen. Another place. What a time.
[1:00:14] Oh, my heart leaps for joy when I think
[1:00:17] of the opportunity that is placed right
[1:00:20] before us now. He said, "The greatest
[1:00:22] opportunity that ever laid before any
[1:00:25] human being was to stand in the presence
[1:00:28] of Jesus Christ." another place somehow
[1:00:31] or another. It has always thrown a great
[1:00:33] effect upon people to come into the
[1:00:36] presence of God. See, there is something
[1:00:39] about coming into the presence of God.
[1:00:41] Amen. It causes things to happen. I love
[1:00:45] that. There's something about coming
[1:00:47] into the presence of God. It causes
[1:00:50] things to happen. Amen. A preacher can't
[1:00:52] cause things to happen. As good as the
[1:00:54] music is, it can't cause things to
[1:00:56] happen. But there's something about
[1:00:58] coming in the presence of God. Amen. He
[1:01:01] said it'll give faith for blinded eyes
[1:01:03] to see. It'll give faith for deaf ears
[1:01:06] to hear. It'll give faith for the
[1:01:08] cripples to walk. It'll give faith.
[1:01:10] Amen. For the dead to raise. Amen. I say
[1:01:12] this. This is not the time to pull back.
[1:01:15] Amen. From the opportunity that God has
[1:01:17] given you as a young person in the age
[1:01:20] you're living in. This is the
[1:01:21] opportunity. Amen. To draw your sword.
[1:01:24] Amen. and fight back against every
[1:01:26] devil. Fight back against every
[1:01:28] unbelieving spirit. Amen. If you could
[1:01:30] hear the voice of the Lord tonight, he
[1:01:32] would be screaming to you, "Now is your
[1:01:35] time to fight." You say, "Well, I'll
[1:01:37] fight in the millennium." There's no
[1:01:38] time to fight in the millennium. Amen.
[1:01:41] Now is the time to fight. But said, "In
[1:01:43] the millennium," he'll say, "Amen. Enter
[1:01:45] into the joys of the Lord. You fought a
[1:01:48] good fight." He said, "So, while we're
[1:01:50] here and we got this opportunity, amen,
[1:01:54] let's make it a good fight." Amen. A
[1:01:56] real fight. How many wants to join with
[1:01:59] me tonight and say, "While I'm here at
[1:02:01] TWWT, I'm going to make this a good
[1:02:04] fight." Amen. I'm going to fight back
[1:02:06] against spirits. I'm going to fight back
[1:02:08] against the devil. Amen. The enemy is
[1:02:10] fighting. Amen. The enemy is pressing.
[1:02:13] The enemy is trying to throw blockades.
[1:02:15] Amen. I think it's time we give the
[1:02:17] enemy a punch back. I say this, the
[1:02:19] prophet of God said the devil's fighting
[1:02:21] cuz it's his last opportunity. He said,
[1:02:23] "See, Satan is making his last punch at
[1:02:26] the church. He will never be able to do
[1:02:29] it after this age." Hey, that's the
[1:02:32] reason the devil's fighting you is he
[1:02:34] will never be able to fight you again.
[1:02:37] Amen. After this age. Hey, but I want to
[1:02:39] tell that devil, I didn't come from
[1:02:41] time, so I'm not going back to time, but
[1:02:44] I come from eternity. And when there is
[1:02:46] no more devil, when there is no more
[1:02:49] sin, when there is no more unbelief,
[1:02:51] when there is no more confusion, when
[1:02:53] there is no more habits, when there is
[1:02:55] no more complexes, I still will be.
[1:02:58] Amen. So, while I'm here, I'm going to
[1:03:01] seize this opportunity and give the
[1:03:03] devil a punch like he's never had
[1:03:05] before. You say, "It's a battle." You're
[1:03:07] exactly right. Amen. But God gives us
[1:03:10] battles. Brother Re said, "Because
[1:03:12] battles are opportunities for
[1:03:14] victories." Amen. Battles are
[1:03:16] opportunities for victories. You say,
[1:03:19] "I'm in a battle tonight." Well, you're
[1:03:20] in an opportunity for victory. Amen. If
[1:03:23] you're sick, you're in opportunity for
[1:03:24] healing. If you're empty, you're in an
[1:03:27] opportunity to receive a feeling of the
[1:03:29] Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. This is our
[1:03:32] time. This is our season. I think of how
[1:03:34] there in St. John chapter 18, what we're
[1:03:37] really reading about is about Pilate.
[1:03:39] Amen. Being in the presence of God.
[1:03:42] Amen. Even though he didn't recognize
[1:03:44] it, it did not change the fact he was in
[1:03:47] the presence of God. And you know what I
[1:03:49] find amazing is he's in the presence of
[1:03:52] God and he becomes an instrument in the
[1:03:55] hands of the devil and he begins to ask
[1:03:58] the devil's famous question. Amen. What
[1:04:01] is truth? Amen. I want to I want to
[1:04:03] start this meeting off tonight by
[1:04:05] saying, Amen. We did not gather up here,
[1:04:08] Amen. to ask what is truth? Amen. We
[1:04:10] didn't gather here to find out what is
[1:04:12] true. Amen. We gathered here with the
[1:04:15] answer to the devil's question. We have
[1:04:17] the truth. And contrary to what some may
[1:04:20] believe, the message is the truth. It's
[1:04:23] the truth on the mountain. It's the
[1:04:25] truth in the valley. It's the truth in
[1:04:27] the young people. It's the truth in the
[1:04:29] old. It's the truth in the preacher.
[1:04:31] It's the truth in the musician. This
[1:04:34] message is not, Amen, some man's idea.
[1:04:37] This message is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:04:40] The world has been looking for truth.
[1:04:42] But praise God tonight. We're not
[1:04:44] looking for truth. We're looking at
[1:04:46] truth.
[1:04:48] What is truth? I know what truth is.
[1:04:51] It's the message of the hour. And the
[1:04:55] message of the hour is not a book. It's
[1:04:58] not a picture. It's not a tape. The
[1:05:01] message of the hour is Christ. Brother
[1:05:04] said, "The message of the hour is simply
[1:05:06] God's promise for the present hour
[1:05:09] according to the scripture."
[1:05:12] My the message of the hour is God's
[1:05:15] promise according to the scripture for
[1:05:19] the present hour. I want to say to you
[1:05:21] tonight, young people, amen, the message
[1:05:24] of the hour has brought opportunities to
[1:05:26] you. It has brought opportunities to
[1:05:29] this generation. Amen. That nothing else
[1:05:32] could bring. You say, "What are you
[1:05:34] talking about?" What about the
[1:05:36] opportunity for a rapture?
[1:05:39] What about the opportunity to change
[1:05:41] your body? What about the opportunity to
[1:05:44] live so close to the devil to God rather
[1:05:47] than the devil know what to do with you?
[1:05:48] What about the opportunity not just to
[1:05:50] be church members, but to be an
[1:05:52] invincible army? Amen. What about the
[1:05:54] opportunity that a prophet would speak
[1:05:56] over you and say, "You're no match for
[1:05:59] the devil." Amen. Because there's
[1:06:01] something on the inside of you. Amen. I
[1:06:04] want to tell the devil, God is not
[1:06:06] sending a message. God has already sent
[1:06:08] a message. And the message is Christ. I
[1:06:12] want to tell the devil, if God sends a
[1:06:14] message, he's got someone that's going
[1:06:16] to believe it. Amen. If God reveals
[1:06:18] himself, he's got somebody that's going
[1:06:21] to believe it. He said, "Now we are
[1:06:23] ready for a battle." Amen. The trumpet
[1:06:25] is to sound. The hymns have been sang.
[1:06:27] Now comes the word. He said, "To hear
[1:06:29] these young soldiers." He said, "Myself
[1:06:32] getting old, I listen around and your
[1:06:34] faith and confidence and what you placed
[1:06:36] in to believe the message that I have
[1:06:39] been given of God." He said, "Now, if it
[1:06:41] wasn't for you all, the message would do
[1:06:43] no good." See, there's got to be
[1:06:46] somebody to believe it. And as long as
[1:06:49] it's coming from God, as long as it's
[1:06:52] coming from God, there is going to be
[1:06:54] somebody believe it. God has made a way.
[1:06:58] Hey, he has a fixed his great economy
[1:07:00] like that that when he sends for
[1:07:03] something, there is something there to
[1:07:06] meet that something. Listen, if God
[1:07:08] sends something, he's not hoping
[1:07:10] something will be there to accept what
[1:07:13] he sends. Listen, if he's going to go by
[1:07:15] the whale, he knows the woman's going to
[1:07:18] be there. If he's going to go by the
[1:07:21] Glory to God, if he's going to go by
[1:07:23] Gyrus's house, he knows the girl's going
[1:07:26] to live again. If he's going to come by
[1:07:28] this camp, he knows the potentials of
[1:07:31] the Holy Ghost is already on the inside
[1:07:34] of you. Listen, God has already set it
[1:07:36] up.
[1:07:38] He has already fixed it. That when he
[1:07:41] sends it, there's somebody in position
[1:07:43] to receive it, to accept it, and to
[1:07:46] believe it. Yes, sir. What is an
[1:07:49] opportunity? Amen. An opportunity is a
[1:07:52] set of circumstances that makes it
[1:07:54] possible to do something. It is a chance
[1:07:58] for success or advancement occurs. So
[1:08:02] when there's an opportunity, amen,
[1:08:05] there's a set of circumstances that have
[1:08:07] been fixed to make it possible to do
[1:08:10] something in order to bring success and
[1:08:13] advancement. I want to say this tonight,
[1:08:15] the bride of Christ is not going
[1:08:17] backwards
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and we are not retreating. Amen. I want
[1:08:22] to say this. We are advancing. We are
[1:08:25] not going back and we are not going
[1:08:27] down. We are going forward and we're
[1:08:30] going upward. Brother said, "See, God's
[1:08:32] church moves onward and God's church
[1:08:35] moves upward." Amen. I want to say what
[1:08:38] a prophet said. We're living in the
[1:08:40] advancement of the gospel. He said, "The
[1:08:43] thing is today the church grain don't
[1:08:45] want to mature. It wants to stay like it
[1:08:47] was back in Moody's time or back in
[1:08:50] Sanki or Finny or Knox or Calvin." He
[1:08:52] said, "They were all right. They were
[1:08:54] the light of the hour, but this is
[1:08:57] another hour. This is another day. Can
[1:09:00] we call it what a prophet called it? A
[1:09:02] bright age in a bright light in the
[1:09:05] middle of bright time. This is another
[1:09:07] hour, folks. This is another day. Young
[1:09:10] people, if you could catch us tonight,
[1:09:12] you could whip every devil in front of
[1:09:13] you. You don't need a feeling. You don't
[1:09:16] need a gift. You don't need a sensation.
[1:09:18] You don't need an emotion. You need a
[1:09:20] revelation of the evening light to stop
[1:09:23] your heart. And it'll ignite a fire on
[1:09:25] the inside of you. And you'll give the
[1:09:27] devil the greatest punch he's ever seen.
[1:09:31] This is another day. This is another
[1:09:33] hour. This is the advancement of the
[1:09:36] gospel. He said it's coming to its
[1:09:40] maturity. Amen. So, we cannot live in
[1:09:43] what Luther said or what Wesley said or
[1:09:46] the rest of them. We're living in the
[1:09:48] light that is predicted for this day.
[1:09:51] We're in the seven church age, not the
[1:09:53] third or the fourth church age. He said
[1:09:55] the grain should be able to receive it.
[1:09:59] Can I tell you what you are? You're not
[1:10:02] stalk. You're not husk. You're grain.
[1:10:05] And the grain should be able to receive
[1:10:08] the message declaring the presence of
[1:10:11] God. If it doesn't, then it falls off
[1:10:14] and it means nothing to it. He said the
[1:10:17] grain is matured with the light if it
[1:10:21] goes ahead with the light. In 1 John
[1:10:24] 1:7, if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:10:27] the light, we have fellowship one with
[1:10:30] another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:32] his son, amen, cleanseth us from all
[1:10:35] sin. I love that word walk. It means to
[1:10:38] progress. It means to make do use of
[1:10:42] opportunities. So when one is walking in
[1:10:45] the light, they are making use of
[1:10:47] opportunities that the light is
[1:10:50] presenting them while they're walking in
[1:10:52] it. He said, "Now, a man walks in
[1:10:54] darkness, he don't know where he's
[1:10:56] going. He can't see where he's going.
[1:10:58] But a man that's walking in the light,
[1:11:01] he knows where he's going." Listen,
[1:11:04] young people, we're past the days of
[1:11:06] guessing our future and need a man to
[1:11:08] tell us our future. We are standing on
[1:11:11] the revelation of the light of God in
[1:11:13] this hour. We know what our future is.
[1:11:16] We know where we come from. We know
[1:11:18] where we're standing. And praise God, we
[1:11:21] know where we're going. And there ain't
[1:11:22] a devil in hell that can change the
[1:11:24] revelation that God is anchored in our
[1:11:27] souls.
[1:11:29] He said, "Listen, a man walking in
[1:11:31] darkness, he don't know where he's
[1:11:32] going, but a man walking in light, he
[1:11:35] knows where he's going." I heard brother
[1:11:37] M say this this today and I about
[1:11:39] shouted. He said, "You might have a lot
[1:11:41] of stumbles, but we're homeward or
[1:11:44] homerred bound." That's one thing for
[1:11:46] sure. You might have a lot of stumbles.
[1:11:49] Listen, just because you stumble don't
[1:11:51] mean you're not walking in the light.
[1:11:53] Just because you stumble don't mean
[1:11:56] you're not walking in the light. You can
[1:11:57] be walking in the light and still
[1:12:00] stumble, but the stumble don't change
[1:12:02] the revelation that's in your soul. I
[1:12:05] know where I come from, brother Josh. I
[1:12:08] come from God and I'm going back to God.
[1:12:11] It's settled in heaven and it's settled
[1:12:13] in my soul.
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:16] You may have some stumbles, but you're
[1:12:18] still progressing.
[1:12:20] Listen what Paul said. He said, "Redeem
[1:12:23] the time because the days are evil."
[1:12:26] Amen. Don't waste time when you stumble.
[1:12:28] Get up.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Don't lay down and quit when you
[1:12:31] stumble. Get up. Redeem the time. You
[1:12:34] know what that word redeem the time
[1:12:36] means? It means to buy up every and each
[1:12:39] opportunity.
[1:12:40] I love that word time. It means the
[1:12:43] supreme moment. I know
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; it means the golden opportunity. In
[1:12:48] other words, Paul is saying redeem our
[1:12:51] golden opportunity in the presence of
[1:12:54] God himself. Let me say this. Amen.
[1:12:58] Death is not your opportunity to change.
[1:13:02] But in his presence while you're living
[1:13:05] is your opportunity to change. He said,
[1:13:08] "Don't you never die here where your
[1:13:11] opportunity was placed before you to go
[1:13:13] into his presence then to try to accept
[1:13:16] it. It's made for now. Right now, you
[1:13:21] must accept it." He said, "When we come
[1:13:23] into his presence, we're changed never
[1:13:26] to be the same." You say, "Well, the
[1:13:28] changed life is just for the ministers."
[1:13:31] He said, "Oh, no. The changed life is
[1:13:34] for everybody." Hallelujah. That's why
[1:13:36] Paul would say, "Amen. Now is the
[1:13:39] accepted time. Behold, now is the day of
[1:13:43] salvation." He said, "This is our
[1:13:45] visitation time." Don't you wait till
[1:13:48] some region yonder in the damned, in
[1:13:50] that dimension where you cannot go in
[1:13:53] the presence of God, and your time is
[1:13:56] upon earth, in the nightmare of horror.
[1:13:58] You will remember you had your
[1:14:00] opportunity, and you turned it away. He
[1:14:04] said, "Now, let the young people take
[1:14:06] notice. Let all take notice." Amen. So,
[1:14:09] don't wait till you're in the presence
[1:14:10] of God. Amen. And there's no room for
[1:14:13] repentance. There's no room for change.
[1:14:16] There's no room to open up your heart
[1:14:18] and let the Holy Ghost wash you by his
[1:14:20] blood. Amen. But now is the time. Amen.
[1:14:24] Now is the fixed time. Amen. Now is the
[1:14:27] right time. Amen. Now is the time to
[1:14:30] break out of the custom. Amen. Now is
[1:14:32] the time to break out of the tradition.
[1:14:35] Now is the time, amen, to break out of
[1:14:37] the feelings and break out of the ideas
[1:14:39] and break out of the complexes. Now is
[1:14:42] the time, amen, to step over into the
[1:14:45] presence of God where there's a
[1:14:47] possibility for a change.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our opening scripture, what you
[1:14:51] see there is Jesus, amen, standing in
[1:14:53] Pilot's Hall and he's standing there on
[1:14:56] trial. Brother Ben picks this up and he
[1:14:58] says, "I'm holding my point or I'm
[1:15:00] making my point here and saying that we
[1:15:03] are standing today in another Pilot's
[1:15:06] judgment hall." You say, "Well, if I
[1:15:09] would have stood there, I would have
[1:15:11] spoke out for Jesus Christ." Well, what
[1:15:13] are you doing about it now? He said,
[1:15:16] "See, that's the thing. No matter how
[1:15:19] much the church had turned him down, oh,
[1:15:21] Brother Brandon, I would have stood by
[1:15:22] his side. You got the opportunity now.
[1:15:27] You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:15:29] "The opposition is greater today to
[1:15:32] stand than it was then." Come on, young
[1:15:36] people. The opposition is greater today.
[1:15:38] Amen. To stand, Amen. than it was then.
[1:15:42] Amen. Then they were standing for the
[1:15:44] word a flesh in a corporal body. Hey,
[1:15:47] but today we're standing upon the
[1:15:49] testimony that the word has returned to
[1:15:52] the church under the anointing of the
[1:15:54] voice of the seventh angel. And what he
[1:15:57] said is thus sayaith the Lord and what
[1:15:59] he taught is truth. And what we believe
[1:16:01] is the message. Listen, if you want to
[1:16:03] stand, now's the time to stand. If you
[1:16:06] want to believe this message, now is the
[1:16:09] time to believe it. If there's ever been
[1:16:10] a time to preach it, now's the time to
[1:16:13] preach it. If there's ever been a time
[1:16:14] to play them tapes, now is the time to
[1:16:18] play them tapes. And I will not back up.
[1:16:21] And I will not lay down for some devil
[1:16:23] that wants to try to label us idolattors
[1:16:25] for believing the voice of God is on
[1:16:28] them tapes. That's God's voice to you.
[1:16:33] That's more than a Kentucky Hill belly.
[1:16:36] That's more than a preacher. That's more
[1:16:38] than just a suggestion about water
[1:16:39] baptism. That is the voice of God giving
[1:16:43] you an opportunity to believe him in the
[1:16:46] hour of unbelief.
[1:16:50] It's more than a man. It's God.
[1:16:53] This message is God. It come from God.
[1:16:57] And we're going back to God. And there
[1:16:59] ain't nothing the devil can do to change
[1:17:01] this message.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Well, they got to be careful with them
[1:17:06] tapes. Maybe you do. I don't.
[1:17:10] And these young people don't either.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; What did Pilate do with his only
[1:17:16] opportunity? Brother B said what he done
[1:17:18] was he asked him to do some kind of
[1:17:20] clown or some kind of trick or some kind
[1:17:22] of magic rabbit. He said, "Oh, I want
[1:17:24] you to see he had a chance to receive
[1:17:28] it, but he didn't."
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet God said? He
[1:17:32] said he ought to have repented. Do you
[1:17:36] know the Bible prophesies the same word
[1:17:39] that stood before Pilate would return in
[1:17:42] this generation?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But can I tell you how much God loves
[1:17:45] you, young people? Is that okay?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; He sent you a prophet to make sure you
[1:17:51] would not miss it when you come in his
[1:17:53] presence.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; You know what the Bible says? Surely the
[1:17:56] Lord God will do nothing, but he
[1:17:59] revealth his secret unto his servants,
[1:18:01] the prophets. You know what Malachi 4
[1:18:03] says? Behold, I God will send you,
[1:18:06] Andrew Glover. I don't mind putting my
[1:18:07] name there. Elijah, William, Mary, and
[1:18:10] Brandham the prophet before the coming
[1:18:12] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:18:13] Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the
[1:18:17] children back to the fathers, and the
[1:18:19] heart of the fathers to the children. In
[1:18:21] Revelation 10:7, you know what the Bible
[1:18:23] says there? In the days of the voice of
[1:18:26] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[1:18:29] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:18:32] finished, as he hath declared to his
[1:18:35] servants, the prophets. How many's ever
[1:18:37] heard brother stand in a prayer line and
[1:18:39] say these words? Amen. You believe me to
[1:18:41] be God's servant.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever heard brother Bham say
[1:18:45] that? Amen. You'll stand there and he'll
[1:18:47] say, "Oh, you believe me to be God's
[1:18:49] prophet." But then he'll back up and
[1:18:51] say, "I'm just your servant." Now let me
[1:18:53] show you something that was not an
[1:18:55] accident church because the Bible said
[1:18:57] the servants the prophets. Look at this
[1:19:00] word servant. It is of one who gives
[1:19:02] himself up to another's will. It is
[1:19:05] those whose service is used by Christ in
[1:19:09] extending and advancing his cause among
[1:19:13] men. Oh God. So God sent this prophet to
[1:19:17] advance his cause among the redeemed. He
[1:19:21] sent this prophet to extend the
[1:19:24] redemptive blessings of Christ. Amen.
[1:19:27] All the way to the young people in the
[1:19:29] final church age. Listen, it'll take a
[1:19:31] prophet to get the revelation because
[1:19:34] God has no other way of bringing out his
[1:19:37] scriptural revelations except by a
[1:19:40] prophet. Can I say this to you?
[1:19:42] Revelation gives you opportunity that
[1:19:44] education never will.
[1:19:47] Revelation gives you opportunities that
[1:19:50] emotions never will. Revelation gives
[1:19:53] you opportunities that feelings and
[1:19:55] sensations will never give you. You know
[1:19:58] what revelation does? It brings hope
[1:20:00] into hopeless situations. It brings life
[1:20:04] into the valley of dry bones. It brings
[1:20:06] healing into the body of blind
[1:20:08] Barnameus. Listen, I want to tell you
[1:20:10] tonight, this message is more than an
[1:20:13] idea. This message is a scriptural
[1:20:15] revelation that has been restored by the
[1:20:19] voice of the servant that God sent to
[1:20:21] extend in advance his cause among men.
[1:20:25] Listen what a prophet said. He said
[1:20:27] there's no hope for the church outside
[1:20:29] of the coming of the Lord. The only hope
[1:20:32] of the church is to get away from their
[1:20:35] man-made theologies
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and get back to the Holy Spirit and get
[1:20:41] the spirit back in the church. I love
[1:20:44] this. And get the church straightened
[1:20:46] out. Now, how does a church get
[1:20:50] straightened out? It takes a prophet to
[1:20:53] straighten out the church. Listen, in
[1:20:55] 1964, brother Bam writes the church age
[1:20:58] book and he sends an audio letter to to
[1:21:00] brother Lev concerning the church age
[1:21:02] book and he says in order to proclaim
[1:21:04] this, he has to send a prophet. Oh, God.
[1:21:08] In order to inject this and make this
[1:21:10] real again, to show the people the hour
[1:21:14] we're living in, because if they only
[1:21:17] see it in the hour past, then there's no
[1:21:20] hopes for the church. The church must
[1:21:23] see it in the present tense. Listen,
[1:21:27] it's not enough to see it in Noah's day.
[1:21:30] It's not enough to see it in Moses's
[1:21:32] day. It's not even enough to see it in
[1:21:34] Paul's day. Can I bring it to you? It's
[1:21:37] not enough to see it just in brother
[1:21:38] Brandham's day. You've got to see it in
[1:21:41] the present tense. So, God sends his
[1:21:44] prophet to manifest the present tense of
[1:21:48] it. Oh, God. God sent a prophet to
[1:21:52] manifest to you the reality of the
[1:21:55] presence of God in the present hour
[1:21:57] you're living in. Listen, we ought to be
[1:22:00] shouting tonight that God has sent the
[1:22:02] anointed prophet messenger of Malachi 4.
[1:22:06] Amen. With an opportunity to this
[1:22:08] generation. You say, "What's he going to
[1:22:10] do?" He's going to straighten out the
[1:22:12] church.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I got a question for you. How does
[1:22:16] God straighten out the church?
[1:22:19] Does he take one preacher out and put
[1:22:21] another one in? Does he take one book
[1:22:23] out and put another idea in? Does he
[1:22:25] take one personality out and put another
[1:22:27] person out in his place? According to
[1:22:30] the prophet, here's what he's going to
[1:22:31] do. He will plant the seed of the entire
[1:22:35] Bible from the serpent to the messenger
[1:22:38] in the former reign. He said, "Then he
[1:22:40] will be rejected by the denominational
[1:22:43] people as his forefather John and Elijah
[1:22:47] as was spoken by our Lord." Let me just
[1:22:49] say this. Denominations has already
[1:22:51] rejected this message.
[1:22:54] There's nothing there, saints. There's
[1:22:57] nothing to go back to and there's
[1:22:59] nothing to bring from there into here.
[1:23:02] Come on. This is not an inclusive
[1:23:04] message. This is an exclusive message.
[1:23:07] Brother Brandham did not preach God
[1:23:09] wants mixtures. He said God wants
[1:23:11] separators.
[1:23:13] And I pray God give us some young people
[1:23:16] that'll catch on fire with the
[1:23:18] revelation of this message and will call
[1:23:20] black and I'll call white white and quit
[1:23:23] trying to paint everything.
[1:23:26] I'm sorry. I'm not a denominational. I'm
[1:23:29] not a chicken. I don't cook. I don't
[1:23:31] scratch. I'm an eagle and I fly because
[1:23:35] I was born for the heavens.
[1:23:38] I can't feed in denominational food.
[1:23:40] There's nothing there to give me
[1:23:42] strength.
[1:23:46] It's why you can't bring a chicken
[1:23:47] preacher in to feed eagles. It won't
[1:23:48] work. What we need today, brother, is to
[1:23:52] sew the gospel seed of the word of the
[1:23:55] power, the resurrection of Christ, the
[1:23:58] living being that's living with us.
[1:24:03] He's in us now. Present tense.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know what Paul said?
[1:24:09] He said, "Don't yield your members as
[1:24:10] instruments of unrighteousness." He
[1:24:13] said, "But yield yourselves unto God."
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Can I say unto the message?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Yield yourselves unto the message as
[1:24:22] those that are alive from the dead.
[1:24:26] as your members, as instruments of
[1:24:29] righteousness unto God. That word yield
[1:24:32] is powerful. It means to place a person
[1:24:35] or a thing at one's disposal. That word
[1:24:38] instruments means a weapon or a tool. It
[1:24:41] is a thing used. It is arms used in
[1:24:44] warfare. Know ye not, verse 16, that to
[1:24:47] whom ye yield yourselves servants to
[1:24:50] obey? His servants ye are to whom you
[1:24:53] obey, whether of sin unto death, or of
[1:24:56] obedience unto righteousness. But God be
[1:24:59] faint, that we were the servants of sin.
[1:25:02] Listen to what Paul says. But ye have
[1:25:04] obeyed from the heart. Now, come on,
[1:25:07] church. How can you obey from the heart
[1:25:10] unless God sends a prophet messenger to
[1:25:13] turn the heart?
[1:25:16] So in order for you to be able to
[1:25:18] advance in the obedience of the gospel,
[1:25:21] he sent a prophet to instruct us and to
[1:25:24] turn our heart that we could from the
[1:25:27] heart obey the form of doctrine which
[1:25:30] was delivered to you. You know what that
[1:25:32] word obeyed means? It means of one who
[1:25:35] on the knock at the door comes to listen
[1:25:37] to who it is. So when something knocks
[1:25:40] on your door, if you obey the knock, you
[1:25:44] get up to go listen. I love the rest of
[1:25:46] it. And then hear what they have to say.
[1:25:50] Do you all know there's a difference in
[1:25:52] listening and hearing?
[1:25:54] There's a difference. Amen. Somebody
[1:25:56] said, "We listen to tapes all the time,
[1:25:58] and we can tell cuz you don't go to
[1:26:00] church no more."
[1:26:03] Because if you was hearing what's on
[1:26:05] those tapes, you would hear a prophet
[1:26:07] say, "If God is in your heart, you can't
[1:26:10] wait for them doors to get open
[1:26:13] to come in there and to fellowship with
[1:26:16] your brothers and sisters." Come on.
[1:26:19] There's a big difference in listening
[1:26:20] and hearing. There's millions that will
[1:26:22] listen, but there's only an elected few
[1:26:25] that will hear. And the true evidence of
[1:26:28] hearing what the spirit is saying unto
[1:26:30] the church is the ability to obey what
[1:26:33] he says. It ain't enough just to hear
[1:26:36] it. You got to obey it.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "You can't prove a difference."
[1:26:41] Oh, yes, I can. I can. You probably
[1:26:44] heard me share this before, but it was
[1:26:46] it was one of the first times I was I
[1:26:48] was studying something in the Bible and
[1:26:50] the Lord gave me a real life experience.
[1:26:52] Amen. To confirm it in my heart. I went
[1:26:54] into the tire shop there in the town of
[1:26:57] Tennessee I grew up in. And there was a
[1:26:58] man in there. He was a fellow message
[1:27:00] believer. And he come up to me and
[1:27:02] Brother Ray, he says, "Oh, you know my
[1:27:04] wife, she listens to tapes all the
[1:27:06] time." I said, "Well, praise God,
[1:27:08] brother. That's wonderful." And he said,
[1:27:09] "Brother Andrew," he said, "She listens
[1:27:11] to tapes every day of her life. And when
[1:27:14] she gets up, she listens to them. When
[1:27:15] she goes to bed, she listens to them." I
[1:27:17] said, "Well, I'm starting to wonder,
[1:27:18] does he listen?" Amen. She listens to
[1:27:21] tapes all the time. And I said, "Well,
[1:27:22] praise the Lord." He said, "But Andrew,
[1:27:24] I brought her car down here to get a
[1:27:25] flat tire fixed." And sure enough, I got
[1:27:28] in the car and I turned her car on and
[1:27:31] there was a tape playing in her car. She
[1:27:33] had been listening to a tape. I said,
[1:27:34] "Praise God, brother." So, we just
[1:27:36] talked there and I left and went down to
[1:27:38] down to the market there, Food City in
[1:27:40] town. And I walk in there and Brother
[1:27:42] David, when I walk in there, I look down
[1:27:44] the aisle and I see this lady I know.
[1:27:47] And it's that man's wife wearing a pair
[1:27:50] of pants.
[1:27:52] And I said, "Wait a second. That can't
[1:27:54] be." And I turned and you know how we do
[1:27:57] when we see somebody we don't want to
[1:27:58] talk to, we quickly go around the other
[1:28:00] aisle. Well, I quickly turned
[1:28:03] and went around the other aisle, too.
[1:28:05] Oh, God bless you. How you doing,
[1:28:07] brother? I said, "Oh my goodness, it
[1:28:09] can't be." And as clear as I'm talking
[1:28:11] to you, the spirit of God spoke in my
[1:28:13] heart and said, "See, there's a
[1:28:14] difference in listening and hearing. If
[1:28:16] she was hearing, she'd take them pants
[1:28:18] off and put a dress on." Are y'all
[1:28:21] hearing me? It ain't enough just to
[1:28:23] listen, young people. It's time to hear
[1:28:26] what the spirit has to say unto the
[1:28:29] churches. And when you truly hear what
[1:28:32] the spirit has to say, it'll bring such
[1:28:34] a reality of revelation in your soul
[1:28:37] that there will be one day be able to
[1:28:40] stand in front of you. Paul said,
[1:28:42] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:28:46] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:28:50] door, I will come into him and will suck
[1:28:53] with him and he with me. The prophet of
[1:28:55] God said, see that word s, it means to
[1:28:58] reveal myself to them.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; I will reveal that I am the same
[1:29:03] yesterday,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; today, and forever. the son of man will
[1:29:09] be revealed in that day when all
[1:29:11] churchity and everything else becomes
[1:29:14] Sodom like that. I'll be on the outside
[1:29:19] but I'll be knocking trying to get in. I
[1:29:22] love this quote. He said, "So I'll say
[1:29:24] one thing. If you don't want him, he
[1:29:27] won't bore you with himself.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; No, he won't push himself on you. He
[1:29:32] never did. He knocks and you're on the
[1:29:36] inside. You're the one that opens the
[1:29:38] door, but he will knock. He will give
[1:29:42] you the opportunity. He said, just think
[1:29:45] what an opportunity. I know thousands of
[1:29:49] people tonight, there is people, are you
[1:29:51] hearing me? That's in this world that
[1:29:54] God never will and never did knock at
[1:29:57] their heart and won't. But if God has
[1:30:00] knocked at your heart's door, you're
[1:30:03] privileged. You ought to come.
[1:30:07] If God allowed this message to knock at
[1:30:10] the heart of your door, you ought to
[1:30:12] realize I am the privileged person on
[1:30:14] the earth to receive the visitation of
[1:30:18] Elohim in the hour that I'm living in.
[1:30:21] Listen, when something knocks on the
[1:30:22] door, it's trying to present itself to
[1:30:25] you.
[1:30:27] Listen, someone knocks, they're
[1:30:28] presenting, but when you get up and go
[1:30:30] open the door, you are receiving what
[1:30:33] they're presenting. I love this because
[1:30:35] the Bible says, "In that day, saith the
[1:30:37] Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O
[1:30:39] Zerubable, my servant, the son of
[1:30:42] Chhatel, and saith the Lord, and will
[1:30:44] make thee as a signate, for I have
[1:30:46] chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts."
[1:30:49] What he's saying there is, I'm going to
[1:30:51] I'm going to lay my hand on somebody.
[1:30:53] I'm going to take them, brother. Said,
[1:30:55] do you see he's seen something in me?
[1:30:59] He's seen something in you. So, he had a
[1:31:02] reason to save you. Look at the people
[1:31:05] that's unsaved today. Look at the
[1:31:07] millions he could have took beside you.
[1:31:09] But he took you and no one can take your
[1:31:12] place. See, God chose you and no one can
[1:31:16] take your place. God took you and no one
[1:31:20] can take your place.
[1:31:23] God put your name on the lamb's book of
[1:31:26] life before the foundation of the world.
[1:31:29] He claimed you to confirm his word
[1:31:32] through you. Listen, this is more than
[1:31:34] just a sermon. This is Christ, the
[1:31:37] revealed word returning in the world of
[1:31:41] Palace Judgment Hall. What are you going
[1:31:43] to do with this Jesus called Christ?
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; God is taking you young people to
[1:31:49] confirm his word through you and his
[1:31:51] word will accomplish what he has sent it
[1:31:53] forth to do. You see, when Pilate stood
[1:31:56] there, are you okay? When pilot stood
[1:31:58] there, he said there was Jesus, the word
[1:32:01] made flesh and he was in he came into
[1:32:04] the earth. He came to do one thing that
[1:32:07] was to accomplish the purpose of God.
[1:32:10] Amen. From heaven and he did. Now watch
[1:32:13] a prophet pick this up. Now we are left
[1:32:17] as we understand to carry on the work
[1:32:20] that he come to accomplish his death at
[1:32:23] Calvary. He was with us and he come out
[1:32:27] of God into the world and went from the
[1:32:30] world into God and has come again in the
[1:32:34] form of the Holy Spirit. And he is with
[1:32:38] us. He is in us to the end of the world
[1:32:41] carrying out in his church the same work
[1:32:44] that he did when he was here on the
[1:32:48] earth. Listen, he's not here in a
[1:32:52] corporal body. If a man come in here
[1:32:55] with nail scars in his hands and a
[1:32:57] bloody robe on, I would not bow down and
[1:33:00] worship him. You know why? Because a
[1:33:02] prophet sowed the entire Bible seed in
[1:33:06] my heart and gave me the ability by the
[1:33:08] preaching of the gospel to discern
[1:33:11] between the spirit of truth and the
[1:33:13] spirit of error. Oh, there's a reason
[1:33:16] why the devil hates you young people. is
[1:33:18] he's deceived everybody else. But he
[1:33:20] can't deceive you because there is
[1:33:25] something on the inside of you that you
[1:33:27] didn't put there. The church didn't put
[1:33:30] it there. The preacher didn't put it
[1:33:32] there. Amen. A good service didn't put
[1:33:34] it there. But God put it there. And he
[1:33:37] put it there to be a channel that when
[1:33:39] he would reveal himself, there would be
[1:33:42] someone on the earth to catch it.
[1:33:45] Listen. You say then how did he come if
[1:33:48] he didn't come in a nail scar hands and
[1:33:50] a crown of thorns on his head tonight?
[1:33:52] How is he here? You know what Paul said
[1:33:54] in Hebrews 10:7 then said I lo I come
[1:34:00] in the volume of the book. It is written
[1:34:04] of me to do thy will oh God. Brother
[1:34:08] said now I want to continue to speak
[1:34:09] about our Lord in his ministry today. He
[1:34:13] said, "Now there's many people in the
[1:34:15] Bible that teaches the Bible as a
[1:34:17] historical book,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; which it is, but it's more than that and
[1:34:23] a history. It's a prophetic book also.
[1:34:27] It foretells what was and it tells what
[1:34:32] will be." Do you accept that to be
[1:34:35] truth?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What is truth? The Bible
[1:34:40] is the truth. Do you accept it to be the
[1:34:43] truth? And now the same Jesus that was
[1:34:47] is the same Jesus that is and will be.
[1:34:50] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:34:53] forever. He said, now his ministry
[1:34:56] carries on. He said, will you help me,
[1:34:58] Almighty God? Amen. Come near to me,
[1:35:01] Father, and anoint thy servant and pack
[1:35:04] me from this sense bound existence into
[1:35:07] the spheres where you live. and may this
[1:35:10] be done through Jesus Christ's name that
[1:35:12] I might know the diseases and the
[1:35:16] thoughts of the people's mind. So he was
[1:35:19] not just ex Oh God, can I preach now? He
[1:35:22] was not just revealing the facial
[1:35:24] expressions on their face.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody come to church with a frown on.
[1:35:31] They're having a bad day. It's the Lord.
[1:35:33] I tell you, you're having a bad day.
[1:35:34] Your frown reveals that
[1:35:39] But he stood there and revealed the
[1:35:41] diseases, the color of coat the doctor
[1:35:44] was wearing, the type of person they
[1:35:46] come on church. He said, "Lord, take me
[1:35:49] away and put yourself in that the works
[1:35:52] of God might be done here in the city."
[1:35:56] He said, Jesus said, "I come to do the
[1:35:57] will of the father and the same spirit
[1:36:00] that he had to begin the works of the
[1:36:02] father and to finish the atonement."
[1:36:04] Amen. to make a way that we could carry
[1:36:07] the message. He made a way, young
[1:36:10] people, that we could carry the message.
[1:36:13] If the spirit that's in you, then you'll
[1:36:15] have the same attitude towards people
[1:36:17] trying to do what you can to help them.
[1:36:20] Listen, Lord, when your knowledge comes
[1:36:23] is like his knowledge, I come to do the
[1:36:25] will of God. He said, see, with the
[1:36:28] father's word, he defeated every devil.
[1:36:32] With the father's word, he defeated
[1:36:35] every devil. You agree with me that
[1:36:37] Jesus came in the volume of the book?
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Do you agree? Can I tell you something?
[1:36:43] This Bible you're carrying is the book
[1:36:45] he stepped out of.
[1:36:49] He stepped out of that book. Oh, but let
[1:36:52] me give the devil another punch. That's
[1:36:54] the same book I stepped out of. That's
[1:36:57] the same book you stepped down because
[1:36:59] the same word that speaks to the
[1:37:01] bridegroom is the same word that speaks
[1:37:04] to the bride. Listen young people, this
[1:37:06] is not another custom. This is an
[1:37:09] appointment. It's an opportunity. It's a
[1:37:12] special moment in the presence of the
[1:37:15] word.
[1:37:18] Oh, may I get you tonight to see that
[1:37:20] you're more than just young people. You
[1:37:22] are the living instrumentality of God.
[1:37:26] Paul said that you would prove what is
[1:37:28] that good and acceptable and the perfect
[1:37:30] will of God.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're more than just young
[1:37:33] people here tonight. He says you're the
[1:37:35] house that God dwells in. Not a building
[1:37:38] with a big bell on top of it and a high
[1:37:40] steeple, but a body hast thou prepared.
[1:37:45] Oh, folks. A body that God can dwell in.
[1:37:49] A God can walk in, that God can see in,
[1:37:53] that God can talk in, that God can work
[1:37:56] in. God walking on two feet.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Can I say this to you? He has moved into
[1:38:04] you and we have moved into him.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He has moved into us and
[1:38:12] we have moved into him. And Jesus spoke
[1:38:15] to you young people. He said at that day
[1:38:19] ye shall know that I am in my father and
[1:38:22] ye in me and I in you. Do you know what
[1:38:24] it took a prophet to stand there and say
[1:38:27] the word becomes you and you become the
[1:38:30] word. See at that day ask a philosopher
[1:38:34] he'll tell you this day or some other
[1:38:36] day or the day back there. But a prophet
[1:38:39] come along and said at that day what
[1:38:41] day? This day. Hallelujah. We find out
[1:38:45] the great hidden mysteries of God are
[1:38:48] now being revealed and that he is in me
[1:38:52] and I am in him and in you. God Emmanuel
[1:38:56] with us.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen young people. God
[1:39:00] Emmanuel with us. It was that Emmanuel
[1:39:03] that seen George Wright sitting down
[1:39:05] there just now laying there dying when
[1:39:08] four doctors passed him. It was that
[1:39:10] Emanuel when he had to borrow a womb,
[1:39:12] when he had to borrow a grave, he
[1:39:14] borrowed my eyes and said, "Go tell
[1:39:17] brother George, thus sayaeth the Lord,
[1:39:19] he'll dig the grave of those preachers
[1:39:21] and things that's laughing at him." It
[1:39:24] was that Emmanuel. It was the same one
[1:39:26] about the little animals the other day
[1:39:28] in the woods. It was the same one.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah. It was the same one about
[1:39:34] Margie Morgan sitting there. Amen. Can I
[1:39:37] bring it from George Ranch? Can I bring
[1:39:39] it from the little fish? Can I bring it
[1:39:41] from the squirrels? Can I bring it from
[1:39:43] Margie Morgan? Can I bring it right
[1:39:45] here? It's the same one who borrowed the
[1:39:48] mental faculties, the senses of this
[1:39:51] body to present to the world today
[1:39:54] through you. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ is
[1:39:58] on display through you.
[1:40:02] This message has brought the God of the
[1:40:05] Bible into the flesh of the redeemed and
[1:40:08] has put him on display.
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, you're way out there.
[1:40:14] No, I'm not. Christ is not a million
[1:40:16] miles away. He's right here
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; in this building tonight. Christ has
[1:40:22] been presented present.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Christ has been presented present.
[1:40:31] by the message
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; of the hour.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; What an opportunity. He says
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; he's here in the form of the written
[1:40:41] word.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus that brought again the Lord
[1:40:48] Jesus from the dead and has presented to
[1:40:50] him to us in the this morning in the
[1:40:54] form of the Holy Spirit. Now I want to
[1:40:57] say this to you. God has always been on
[1:40:59] the earth in some form. Right?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; He never left the earth.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Then if he's here, brother
[1:41:05] Andrew, where's he at?" Brother Ram
[1:41:07] said, "Can't you see the son of man in
[1:41:10] the form of prophetic message
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; returning back again in his church
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; in prophecy, revealing Jesus Christ the
[1:41:20] same yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Can I read the rest of it? It's never
[1:41:28] been done to the age till this time.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; How does God interpret his word? By
[1:41:37] bringing it to pass.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He said, "Let there be
[1:41:41] a sun." How did he bring that to pass?
[1:41:44] There was a son. The son interpreted the
[1:41:48] spoken word. He said, "Let there be a
[1:41:50] moon." And the moon come in the sky. And
[1:41:53] the moon interpreted the spoken word.
[1:41:55] Oh, I say to you tonight, young people,
[1:41:58] there's some things that's been revealed
[1:42:00] through this prophet's ministry. Like
[1:42:02] one of these mornings, you're going to
[1:42:03] feel a cold sweep come over your body.
[1:42:06] How is he going to interpret that? All I
[1:42:09] know is some morning, brother Micaiah,
[1:42:12] I'm going to feel a cold sweep. The
[1:42:14] bride is the interpretation of the word.
[1:42:19] Listen, it's not been done till this
[1:42:22] time.
[1:42:24] What are you talking about? The presence
[1:42:27] of the Lord Jesus is right here. He
[1:42:30] said, "Do you see?" Amen. It's not his
[1:42:33] coming. It's his appearing.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Now, the appearing of the Lord is now.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; When he's appearing in his people, when
[1:42:43] his spirit is working among them, when
[1:42:46] it's proven that it's him with them,
[1:42:48] what's it doing? Oh, God. It's getting
[1:42:51] them ready for the rapture,
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; for the coming of the Lord. Now listen,
[1:42:58] watch this prophetic announcement. My
[1:43:00] ministry is different from a from a
[1:43:03] pastor or from a teacher. If I say
[1:43:05] things wrong, brethren, forgive me. I
[1:43:07] don't mean it. But this is my ministry.
[1:43:10] See?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; To declare him that he's here.
[1:43:17] See what he's saying is what Jesus was
[1:43:20] in a corporal body is what he is now.
[1:43:24] His presence he is supposed to return in
[1:43:27] the last days. We know that through
[1:43:30] human flesh and declare himself the same
[1:43:32] way. Oh, amen. Can I start these
[1:43:35] meetings off with some words of comfort?
[1:43:37] Is that okay? Now for your comfort, I
[1:43:40] say this to you in his name. He is here.
[1:43:45] The same God that came down and talked
[1:43:48] to Abraham had his back turned to the
[1:43:51] tent and Sarah on the inside of the tent
[1:43:54] and he knew what she was thinking. That
[1:43:57] same God is right here in this building
[1:44:01] tonight. Oh, Satan, get out of our way.
[1:44:04] We're not just gathered here looking for
[1:44:06] truth. We are possessing truth.
[1:44:12] What are you saying? I'm saying our
[1:44:14] father has revealed the word to impart
[1:44:17] the knowledge of his presence to his
[1:44:19] children.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:44:23] Satan don't want you to receive this.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to keep punching at you so
[1:44:29] this word seed don't get in you.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Satan don't want you to receive this
[1:44:34] heavenly knowledge.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; He don't mind you get an intellectual
[1:44:39] conception. He don't mind you get a
[1:44:41] message education. He don't mind you get
[1:44:44] a chill bump and a goosebump and a good
[1:44:45] feeling. He don't mind you get an
[1:44:47] emotion and a sensation. He don't mind
[1:44:50] you get a
[1:44:52] just don't get the heavenly knowledge.
[1:44:55] Can I say this? Because when you know
[1:44:58] Christ is here, then you know he's
[1:45:01] defeated.
[1:45:03] When you know Christ is here, then you
[1:45:06] know the devil is defeated. As long as
[1:45:10] you're wondering if he's here, as long
[1:45:13] as you're presuming, is he here? As long
[1:45:16] as you're guessing, is he here? That
[1:45:18] devil can wreak havoc. But when the
[1:45:20] revelation strikes your soul, he's not a
[1:45:23] million miles away. He's right here in
[1:45:26] this building tonight. If he is here,
[1:45:29] then cancer is defeated. If he is here,
[1:45:32] then childhood diabetes is defeated. If
[1:45:34] he is here, every complex, every
[1:45:37] nervousness, every suicidal spirit is
[1:45:40] defeated in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:46] I say let God arise and his enemies be
[1:45:49] scattered. Let the revelation arise in
[1:45:52] your heart.
[1:45:55] What I'm feeling is more than a
[1:45:57] sensation. I'm feeling his presence.
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:03] I'm feeling his presence.
[1:46:05] [Applause]
[1:46:08] And when you recognize
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; when you recognize his presence,
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; when you recognize his presence, not
[1:46:20] when you feel it,
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; brother David. When you recognize it,
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:28] when you recognize his presence, you
[1:46:32] release his power.
[1:46:36] When you recognize his presence, when
[1:46:40] you recognize this is my opportunity,
[1:46:43] when you recognize, Brother Jesse Luke,
[1:46:46] when you recognize he's not in a grave
[1:46:48] in Jerusalem, he's not in a tomb in
[1:46:51] Jeffersonville, he's not in a library,
[1:46:53] he's not in a congress hall in
[1:46:55] Washington DC, he is right here in the
[1:46:58] building tonight. When you recognize
[1:47:01] that, you release his power.
[1:47:07] You say, "I don't feel it." That's okay.
[1:47:10] Just recognize it. You say, "I can't
[1:47:12] sense it." That's okay. Just recognize
[1:47:16] it. Because the minute you recognize it
[1:47:19] is the minute you release the power of
[1:47:22] the Almighty God.
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; When I feel better, that's too late.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; When I feel better, that's too late.
[1:47:41] [Applause]
[1:47:45] When things start looking better, that's
[1:47:48] too late.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; When my favorite preacher takes the
[1:47:52] microphone,
[1:47:54] that's too late.
[1:47:58] Now is your time. Now is your
[1:48:02] opportunity.
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:08] No matter how much God
[1:48:11] is standing present.
[1:48:14] How many believe he's here?
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe he's in this building?
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; You You believe he's right here?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You believe he's right here in this
[1:48:23] building tonight?
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; You just released his power.
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:38] All things are possible
[1:48:42] to them that can believe. Satan, I adure
[1:48:47] thee in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:48:50] condemn you. Take your hands off of
[1:48:53] God's property. Release the faith of the
[1:48:56] children of God in the word of God.
[1:49:00] You don't have to wait till things
[1:49:02] change to praise him. You don't have to
[1:49:03] wait till things look better to believe.
[1:49:05] You don't have to wait till some special
[1:49:07] hot moment comes.
[1:49:10] The minute the revelation strikes your
[1:49:12] heart, he is here. The devil is
[1:49:16] defeated. Sin is defeated.
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:24] Hallelujah.
[1:49:25] Why should we here till we die? This is
[1:49:28] our opportunity.
[1:49:35] Hallelujah.
[1:49:37] Hallelujah.
[1:49:39] I'm going to preach to you by I'm going
[1:49:40] to just say this very straight. God's
[1:49:42] heard your prayers.
[1:49:45] God's heard your petitions. God's been
[1:49:47] in them prayer meetings. God's been by
[1:49:50] them beds at night when you've been
[1:49:51] praying about situations and things for
[1:49:54] this meeting. And can I say this to you
[1:49:56] upon the authority of the word of the
[1:49:57] Lord? He's here to meet your
[1:49:59] expectations.
[1:50:01] [Applause]
[1:50:07] Brother, I'm stand there in the prayer
[1:50:08] line. I hurt him today. He said, "Come
[1:50:11] now, sir." He said, "Be real reverent."
[1:50:14] He said, "Come now, sir." He said, "Do
[1:50:16] you believe me to be God's servant,
[1:50:18] God's prophet? You've been waiting a
[1:50:20] long time, brother Ray. I heard these
[1:50:22] words." He said, 'You've been praying
[1:50:25] for a long time for an opportunity to
[1:50:28] stand before Brother Brandham.
[1:50:32] Oh, listen. I rebuke that devil that
[1:50:35] tries to make you feel like an idoltor
[1:50:37] for enjoying them quotes.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm not Ahab. I come from
[1:50:41] Elijah. I rebuke that devil. We're not a
[1:50:44] bunch of idolattors. We know who is in
[1:50:47] that man.
[1:50:50] We're not a bunch of ignoramuses. We
[1:50:53] know he was a son of man, but he was
[1:50:56] revealing. He was revealing the son of
[1:50:59] man that he's in the room that he's here
[1:51:02] to heal you. He's here to save you. He's
[1:51:06] here to deliver you. He's here to bring
[1:51:08] the prodical home.
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:16] He says, "You waited a long time. You
[1:51:19] waited a long time." He said, "But it's
[1:51:21] better late than never."
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; It's better late than never. He said,
[1:51:30] "Sir, that trouble you got, it just left
[1:51:32] you."
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Go on your way. Praising God.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Andrew, I've gone too
[1:51:40] far." You say, "Brother Andrew, I've
[1:51:43] done this and I've done that and I I've
[1:51:45] done this and I've done that." Can I Can
[1:51:47] I just say something to you? Man's
[1:51:49] extremity
[1:51:50] is God's opportunity.
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Man's extremity
[1:51:56] is God's opportunity.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, I'm down to nothing.
[1:52:00] God's up to something."
[1:52:03] You say, "Brother Ender, it's the
[1:52:04] darkest hour it's ever been." That's
[1:52:06] okay. God's up to something. Because
[1:52:08] man's extremity is God's opportunity. As
[1:52:13] long as a doctor can do something, he's
[1:52:15] in God's way. as long as you can do
[1:52:18] something, you're in God's way. But when
[1:52:20] you've exhausted every resource, when
[1:52:22] you've gone as far as you can go, when
[1:52:25] you've prayed as long as you can pray,
[1:52:26] when you've cried as hard as you can
[1:52:28] cry, and you finally get to a point, you
[1:52:30] throw up your hands and you say, "Lord,
[1:52:32] I'm down to nothing. I don't know what
[1:52:34] to do." Can I tell you what you just
[1:52:36] did? You just seized. You just seized
[1:52:40] your opportunity in his presence.
[1:52:46] You just seize your opportunity.
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:52] If God appears, he appears on purpose.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, what are you getting at?
[1:53:01] I want to say this. He's here.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Now, it's time for you to get to Jesus.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; There's a little woman one time. She
[1:53:12] goes over there and she and you know the
[1:53:15] story. I'm not going to preach the whole
[1:53:16] story to you, but you know it. She sees
[1:53:18] Jesus in the corner
[1:53:20] with dirty feet.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; He's been ignored. He's been he's been
[1:53:25] humiliated. Y'all know that something
[1:53:26] brother said Jesus comes where he's
[1:53:28] invited.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know the all knowing God knew
[1:53:31] when he walked in that house he was
[1:53:33] going to be humiliated.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; He knew he was going to be made fun of.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; He knew he was going to be laughed at.
[1:53:39] But he still
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; he still went
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; anyhow.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Do y'all know that?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And he sat in the corner with dirty
[1:53:50] feet. I love what the prophet of God
[1:53:51] said. Are you with me?
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; He said she goes down there and she
[1:53:56] takes what little money she's got.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And he said she walked in there and
[1:54:00] said, "I want the I want the best."
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; They said, "Ma'am, you just got a little
[1:54:06] bit of money." She said, "No, I want the
[1:54:08] best
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; because he's worth my all.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; This is my one opportunity.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; This is my one chance. This is my one
[1:54:20] opportunity." See, because of who I am,
[1:54:23] they won't let me around him. All them
[1:54:25] all them religious people, they won't
[1:54:26] let me around him. But I recognized who
[1:54:28] he was. Can I say why she did? because
[1:54:32] there was something inside of her that
[1:54:34] connected with something inside of him
[1:54:37] and it be to pull her. It be to draw
[1:54:41] her. She said, "Lord," she said, she
[1:54:44] said, "Give me, give me the best." Ram
[1:54:46] said she didn't want no cheap anointing.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He said she wanted the best anointing.
[1:54:51] And when she got down there, I love
[1:54:53] this. Brother Re said there was a lot of
[1:54:55] things between her and her opportunity.
[1:54:58] There was a lot of things between her
[1:55:01] and her opportunity. So she walked in
[1:55:03] there on the first night and she said,
[1:55:05] "Oh Lord, there's too much. I I'll come
[1:55:08] back try tomorrow night. Let me
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; No, you know what the prophet of God
[1:55:12] said? He said she be to elbow.
[1:55:16] She be to elbow her way through."
[1:55:21] Glory to God.
[1:55:23] Glory to God. She began to elbow her way
[1:55:27] through. There was this complex and and
[1:55:29] there was this sin and there was this
[1:55:31] stronghold and there was this voice and
[1:55:34] but she didn't back up. She said, "This
[1:55:36] is my one opportunity. I got to get to
[1:55:40] the message of the hour. I got to get to
[1:55:44] the revelation."
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:48] They said, "Calm down." She said, "You
[1:55:50] don't know how bad I need him. You don't
[1:55:53] know how bad I need him. She elbowed her
[1:55:55] way through the mat. She elbowed her way
[1:55:58] through critics. She elbowed her way
[1:56:00] through people laughing at her. She
[1:56:02] elbowed her way through people saying
[1:56:04] the message wasn't what it was. But she
[1:56:06] elbowed her way through it until she
[1:56:09] made it to the feet of Jesus.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said she be to wash it with
[1:56:19] her tears.
[1:56:21] She began to dry it with a hair of her
[1:56:25] head.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; I love this part. He said, "Then
[1:56:30] somebody said, "Wait a second." Said,
[1:56:32] "She broke the bottle and she began to
[1:56:35] pour the oil out
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; and they ran over there and they said,
[1:56:38] "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:56:41] Save some.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Save some.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Save it. Just save just a little bit."
[1:56:47] You know, just just just save some. She
[1:56:50] said, "No,
[1:56:52] this is my opportunity.
[1:56:56] No, this is my opportunity.
[1:57:00] I can't save any. I can't hold anything
[1:57:03] back. This is my opportunity.
[1:57:08] I can't hold nothing back. I got to let
[1:57:11] it all go." Come on, young people. This
[1:57:14] is your opportunity. Don't hold anything
[1:57:17] back. Let it all go. Let it all go
[1:57:20] tonight. Let every bit of yourself go.
[1:57:24] I will not hold it back. I will not hold
[1:57:27] it back. You know what the prophet of
[1:57:28] God said? He said when she began to pour
[1:57:31] it all on his feet, it be to testify to
[1:57:34] them, she believed he was worth
[1:57:36] everything.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; She seized.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; She seized her opportunity.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not just another youth
[1:57:47] camp.
[1:57:50] Can I Can I just say this to you?
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; This is not just another TWT.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; The hour is too late, young people.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; This is not just another service.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; The hour
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; is too late.
[1:58:08] [Applause]
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; This is not just another weekend with
[1:58:13] your friends.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; The hour. Come on.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; It's too late.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you? The way the Lord
[1:58:23] put it on my heart.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; You know, blind Barameus stood there
[1:58:26] that day and brother said these words.
[1:58:28] He said he he couldn't see Jesus,
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; but he knew, brother Jay, he was passing
[1:58:33] by
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; and he knew this is my opportunity.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't have no sense aside in his
[1:58:42] eyes to declare this was him.
[1:58:46] But his presence was so powerful,
[1:58:48] brother A.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is my opportunity." You
[1:58:51] know what the prophet of God said? He
[1:58:53] said he couldn't wait until the next
[1:58:55] service.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; There was not another service coming. He
[1:59:00] said he didn't have that opportunity.
[1:59:02] Listen to this, young people. He said
[1:59:04] that was his first and his last
[1:59:07] opportunity. It was the only opportunity
[1:59:11] he ever had or ever would have to
[1:59:14] receive his sight.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know you've heard this. Well,
[1:59:19] you'll have another chance. And I
[1:59:21] believe that you'll have this. But can I
[1:59:23] say this to you? Treat every opportunity
[1:59:26] like it's the first and it's the last.
[1:59:29] It's the only opportunity.
[1:59:33] If you're going to sing a song, sing it
[1:59:36] like it's your first opportunity. like
[1:59:38] it's your only opportunity, like it's
[1:59:40] your last. If you're going to pray, pray
[1:59:43] like it's your only opportunity. Pray
[1:59:45] like it's your first and your last. If
[1:59:48] you're going to preach, brothers, let us
[1:59:50] preach like it's our first opportunity.
[1:59:53] It's our only opportunity and it's our
[1:59:55] last opportunity. And young people, if
[1:59:58] you're going to believe this message,
[2:00:00] believe it right now like it's your
[2:00:02] first opportunity to believe it. Like
[2:00:04] it's your last opportunity to believe
[2:00:06] it. Like it's your only opportunity.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; He's passing by.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; He's here. Yes,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; God has provided you an opportunity,
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; a time,
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; a place,
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; a moment,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; a golden opportunity,
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; eyes to see,
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; ears to hear,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; a heart to believe.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I just share this with you and
[2:00:44] I'm done? St. John 4.
[2:00:47] When you see this is your opportunity,
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; it'll change the way you approach the
[2:00:51] services.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; When you see this is your opportunity,
[2:00:56] it'll change the way you approach the
[2:00:58] word of God.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; When that revelation strikes your heart,
[2:01:01] listen, young people, there's a lot of
[2:01:04] things trying to deal with you right
[2:01:05] now.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of ideas.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of customs.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of traditions.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of websites.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of unbelieving voices.
[2:01:17] There's a lot of repbate voices
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; and they're trying to deal with you
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; and they're trying to tell you this and
[2:01:23] tell you that and convince you this and
[2:01:25] convince you that. They're trying to
[2:01:27] tear down the authority of the message
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; and they're trying to water down the
[2:01:32] fact that God sent a prophet and they're
[2:01:34] trying to trying to water down the
[2:01:35] effect of this message and and then and
[2:01:37] then all of a sudden they start I'm just
[2:01:40] I'm just going to preach right here.
[2:01:42] They start trying to say things like,
[2:01:43] "Well, don't quote brother Brandham so
[2:01:44] much and and and don't really enter in,
[2:01:46] you know, and and don't really but but
[2:01:50] when else are we going to have an
[2:01:51] opportunity to do it?
[2:01:54] If we don't do it now,
[2:01:57] when are we going to do it? If we don't
[2:02:01] enjoy the message now, when are we going
[2:02:04] to enjoy it? If we don't preach it now,
[2:02:07] when are we going to preach it? I think
[2:02:09] it's time to draw our swords and say,
[2:02:12] "This is my hour. This is my time. This
[2:02:15] is my opportunity."
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; you're the woman at the well.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; As our musicians come tonight,
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; you're the woman at the well.
[2:02:35] This is a special moment.
[2:02:37] Not because I'm here.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Or some other preachers here,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; but brother Nathan, because he's here,
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; this is a special moment,
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; See, God sets up things.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; God arranges things.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; God's in the details
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; and God fixes things.
[2:03:00] So that when he begins to bring that
[2:03:05] that
[2:03:07] pivotal moment,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; when he begins to when he begins to
[2:03:12] bring that that uh how would we say it?
[2:03:15] That that climax moment of of a
[2:03:17] testimony or a situation. When he begins
[2:03:20] to do that, brother, he's got every
[2:03:23] thing in place. I was over the other day
[2:03:25] in Czech Republic. Brother Josh Martin
[2:03:27] and I was there and brother Andrew uh
[2:03:30] Mars I believe is how you pronounce his
[2:03:31] last name from Ireland. He was preaching
[2:03:33] the the f first morning service of the
[2:03:36] youth camp there and he come down the
[2:03:38] end of his sermon and I'd been studying
[2:03:39] on things to preach and to minister and
[2:03:41] the brother had called me and asked me
[2:03:43] about coming and he said brother Andrew
[2:03:44] he said there was a preacher left the
[2:03:46] message and he he's trying to influence
[2:03:48] young people and pull young people and
[2:03:50] he's pulled some and he said there's a
[2:03:51] real burden on our heart. He said we'd
[2:03:53] felt to have you to come. Would you
[2:03:54] come? And so I I went and I'm there and
[2:03:56] you just know how you just get under a
[2:03:59] burden
[2:04:00] and brother Andrew is closing his sermon
[2:04:02] out and he says these words. I've
[2:04:04] already got my sermon on my heart,
[2:04:06] brother Ray. And brother Andrew says
[2:04:08] these words. He says, "You see, God will
[2:04:10] fix things to deal with things
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; in your life
[2:04:16] that will never deal with you again."
[2:04:22] And
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; I thought,
[2:04:25] whoa.
[2:04:26] And when he said that, young people,
[2:04:28] something in my heart went right to St.
[2:04:30] John chapter 4.
[2:04:33] And the Bible said that Jesus was going
[2:04:36] from Galilee, from Judea, I believe,
[2:04:38] down to Galilee.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; And I like to say it like this. And he
[2:04:42] must have needs to go by St. Mary's,
[2:04:44] Ohio.
[2:04:49] He must have needs, brother Josh, to go
[2:04:52] by St. Mary's, Ohio.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; He must have needs.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; God
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; has needs.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; He must have needs to go by Samaria. And
[2:05:05] he and and he sits on a whale.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; He sits on a whale.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to borrow brother
[2:05:15] David's statement right now. I'm done
[2:05:17] preaching. Just having fun. He sits on a
[2:05:20] whale. Think about this. He don't sit
[2:05:23] just anywhere. He sets on a whale.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; And this woman comes out with her water
[2:05:30] bucket and he don't wait on God. She
[2:05:33] don't wait on him. He's all
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; He's already there.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; She don't get down and pray. She don't
[2:05:44] get down in bed. He's already there.
[2:05:55] And he's sitting there on the whale and
[2:05:58] he says, "Give me a drink."
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; And you know what she says? She says,
[2:06:05] "Listen, the Jews have no dealings
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; with the Samaritans.
[2:06:15] Come on now.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; She thought a Jew was coming to deal
[2:06:21] with a Samaritan.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; But what was really happening is what's
[2:06:26] happening right here in this building
[2:06:27] tonight.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; The predestinated word was coming to
[2:06:32] deal with the predestinated seed.
[2:06:37] It wasn't a Jew coming to deal with a
[2:06:40] Samaritan. It was the word coming to
[2:06:43] deal with the seed.
[2:06:45] But they said what happened? He said the
[2:06:48] word seen the word. The word that was in
[2:06:52] your father saw the word that was in
[2:06:54] your soul. It was the opportunity for
[2:06:57] that word to come alive. Listen, I'm not
[2:07:00] going to preach no fake. I'm going to
[2:07:01] say it like this. And of all places for
[2:07:04] a dirty, filthy woman to be, where was
[2:07:06] she at? She was at the well. She was at
[2:07:09] a perfect place for something dirty to
[2:07:12] be.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet of God said? He
[2:07:18] said, "Right here tonight," he said,
[2:07:20] "You got an opportunity at the well." He
[2:07:23] said, "There's no better place that's in
[2:07:26] Christ."
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Christ is the message.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; And that day there shall be a fountain
[2:07:30] open. Listen, he was David's fountain of
[2:07:33] life.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; He is still that fountain in the house
[2:07:36] of David. and he's right here
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; tonight. I want you to stand up on your
[2:07:41] feet for a moment.
[2:07:43] It
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; was her opportunity.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; God fixed it.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; God arranged things.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; See, brother, see, when she met that
[2:07:57] open well, can I say it like this? When
[2:08:00] she met the open word,
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; he said the old system lost its
[2:08:06] strength. Right?
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; It no longer tasted good.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now see, if you'll come
[2:08:14] tonight and plunge beneath the crimson
[2:08:16] flow of that fountain, you'll come up on
[2:08:18] the other side washed. Where we went in
[2:08:20] sinners, we'll come out saved. Where we
[2:08:23] went in sick, we'll come out well. We go
[2:08:26] in downtrodden, disheartened, weary,
[2:08:29] tossed about by every little thing, and
[2:08:32] come out on the other side established."
[2:08:36] Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, how we thank thee for this great
[2:08:41] opportunity to come to the fountain.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Listen tonight, young people. You said,
[2:08:47] "Brother Andrew, I've already been
[2:08:49] saved. I've already received the Holy
[2:08:51] Ghost.
[2:08:52] The devil's battled my mind, battling my
[2:08:55] spirit." I want to tell you this
[2:08:56] tonight. You're standing by the
[2:08:59] fountain.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Of assurity. Right.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; You can drink from this fountain. Let me
[2:09:07] say it this. You can come to this camp
[2:09:09] with questions in your mind
[2:09:11] about the message or about anything.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; You can come to this camp up and down.
[2:09:16] Up and down.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; And I believe you can leave here
[2:09:19] established.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; I believe one drink out of this fountain
[2:09:24] and you can leave here so established
[2:09:25] the devil don't know what to do with
[2:09:27] you.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Listen. Brother Ram said, "Listen,
[2:09:30] listen. Word believers hear me. Oh word
[2:09:33] believers, give into my message.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Not my message, his message.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; He firmly declares
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; to be the truth.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; I believe it tonight. I believe there's
[2:09:43] a fountain open. Do we have a Do we have
[2:09:46] a receiver in the building tonight?
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; The voice of deliverance is speaking.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; The voice of authority is speaking.
[2:09:56] Treat every opportunity
[2:09:58] sees it tonight. How many say going to
[2:10:01] these meetings? This is my meeting.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; These are my services.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; These these sermons are my sermons.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; This atmosphere is mine.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; This presence, it's mine.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heart together tonight.
[2:10:24] Now is the time.
[2:10:28] Now
[2:10:29] is the golden opportunity.
[2:10:33] Now is the grand opportunity.
[2:10:37] God has watched over you young people.
[2:10:40] God has watched over, as the prophet of
[2:10:43] God would say in the message, he'll say,
[2:10:45] "God has watched over generations
[2:10:48] to get you to where you are right now."
[2:10:52] He's fixed things and he's set up
[2:10:55] things. He's moved things and positioned
[2:10:58] things and shifted things to get you to
[2:11:01] where you are right now.
[2:11:03] God sent this message
[2:11:06] knowing there would be somebody receive
[2:11:08] it.
[2:11:10] Knowing there would be somebody believe
[2:11:12] it.
[2:11:14] Knowing there would be someone who would
[2:11:16] not just listen to it, but they would
[2:11:19] hear it.
[2:11:21] When that knock on the door would come.
[2:11:24] When that voice in Revelation 10:7 would
[2:11:27] begin to knock at the door's heart,
[2:11:31] they would begin to knock knowing there
[2:11:33] would be somebody open that door.
[2:11:36] I wonder tonight with every head bowed,
[2:11:38] every eye closed, just you and the Lord.
[2:11:41] You say, "Lord, I I hear that knock. I
[2:11:45] feel that knock.
[2:11:47] Lord, I hear your word, and it's
[2:11:48] challenging me. It's challenging me to
[2:11:51] dig into this message like never before.
[2:11:55] is challenging me to move into the into
[2:11:57] the revelations that God has brought out
[2:11:59] through this vindicated prophet.
[2:12:02] This message is not just letter, but
[2:12:04] it's it's his presence. It's his spirit.
[2:12:08] It's calling me into higher heights. I
[2:12:11] want to go there, Lord. It's calling me
[2:12:14] into deeper depths.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm ready tonight to make a full
[2:12:19] surrender. Lord, Lord, I'm ready tonight
[2:12:22] to cut ties with everything and launch
[2:12:25] out tonight into the deep.
[2:12:28] I'm ready tonight to follow you.
[2:12:31] He's sitting at the whale.
[2:12:34] You said, "Brother Andrew, is the altar
[2:12:35] the whale?" It can be, but he's sitting
[2:12:38] at the well. The altar is your heart
[2:12:39] tonight.
[2:12:41] He wants to reveal himself to you this
[2:12:43] weekend.
[2:12:45] Let me say, "Lord, I open the door. Come
[2:12:48] into my life.
[2:12:49] [Music]
[2:12:50] God bless you, Almighty God.
[2:12:55] Lord, this is a powerful group of young
[2:12:57] people standing before me, Lord.
[2:13:00] Lord, these are not just young men and
[2:13:03] young ladies, but Lord, these are chosen
[2:13:06] vessels, Lord. Father, these are
[2:13:09] predestinated hearts and predestinated
[2:13:12] lives. And Lord, they're here not by
[2:13:16] accident.
[2:13:17] They're not here by happen chance, Lord.
[2:13:21] Father, I believe they're here under
[2:13:23] divine orchestration, Lord.
[2:13:26] Father, I believe they're here under
[2:13:28] divine predestination, Lord. Father, I
[2:13:32] know the enemy's done everything he can
[2:13:34] to stop them and to block them and to
[2:13:36] confuse them, Lord, to bring their minds
[2:13:39] and to bring their hearts and their
[2:13:41] spirits, oh God, into into confusions
[2:13:44] and into into all kinds of things. But
[2:13:46] Lord, I thank you that there's a seed on
[2:13:48] the inside of their hearts, Lord,
[2:13:51] that no matter what the devil would try
[2:13:53] to put against them, there's something
[2:13:56] on the inside of them, dear God, that's
[2:13:59] ordained to rise above it all.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, they've not come here for
[2:14:03] just another weekend or just another
[2:14:05] good time. Lord, I believe we're going
[2:14:07] to have a good time. I believe we're
[2:14:08] having one. But Lord, as we as we turn
[2:14:12] on the tapes and we read through the
[2:14:14] books and we break open our Bibles,
[2:14:17] Lord, we see the hour we're living in is
[2:14:20] late. Father, Israel is in the homeland
[2:14:24] and Lord, Russia's hollering and and the
[2:14:26] world is falling apart. Lord, everything
[2:14:28] your prophet brought out by this by this
[2:14:31] inspiration is happening before our
[2:14:33] eyes.
[2:14:35] Lord, we believe that at any moment
[2:14:37] there's not another age coming. There's
[2:14:39] not another church age coming. This is
[2:14:41] the final people, Lord. This is the
[2:14:44] final age, Lord. Father, I pray tonight,
[2:14:48] dear God. If there be one that hasn't
[2:14:51] seized their opportunity,
[2:14:53] Lord, they're still looking for truth.
[2:14:55] They're still trying to find truth.
[2:14:58] They're still trying to find something
[2:14:59] that'll give them, Lord, a satisfaction
[2:15:02] in their heart. Oh God, may this be the
[2:15:04] night their search is over, Lord. Lord,
[2:15:07] may this be the night that your word
[2:15:09] breaks open in their heart. And Lord,
[2:15:11] they can see who not just brother
[2:15:13] Brandham was or who you are, but Lord,
[2:15:16] they can find their self right here in
[2:15:18] this message. And they can say, "Lord,
[2:15:21] I'm one of those one in a million that
[2:15:24] you gave the opportunity to hear these
[2:15:26] things. Thank you.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; I'm one in a million, Lord, that you
[2:15:30] allowed my heart to be flexible and to
[2:15:33] be tender towards the voice of the
[2:15:34] seventh angel.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; That when he would begin to speak, the
[2:15:38] things he would begin to say would Lord
[2:15:41] begin to turn my heart
[2:15:44] back to the faith of the fathers.
[2:15:46] And Father, I pray tonight, dear God,
[2:15:48] that every enemy be bound, every spirit
[2:15:51] be broken. Lord, we're in your presence
[2:15:55] and your power is here tonight.
[2:15:58] in Jesus name.
[2:16:01] Lord, if there's one sick here tonight,
[2:16:03] may they recognize your presence and
[2:16:06] release your healing power. If there's
[2:16:09] one bound here tonight, may they
[2:16:11] recognize your presence
[2:16:13] and release your delivering power
[2:16:16] in the name of Jesus.
[2:16:19] In the name of Jesus.
[2:16:22] In the name of Jesus. Nothing.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Won't you just slip your hands up to him
[2:16:26] tonight?
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Why don't you be like that little woman
[2:16:32] in the Bible?
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Nothing like
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; she elbowed her way through.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; She made her way to the feet of Jesus.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; She broke open the bottle.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; She poured all the oil out on his feet.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; She began to wash his feet. She began to
[2:16:49] worship him.
[2:16:51] Father of God says she got beside
[2:16:53] herself.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, tonight
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; on the first night of this camp, get
[2:17:00] beside yourself.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Let go of everything. All the worries,
[2:17:05] all the troubles, all the problems.
[2:17:08] [Music]

[2:17:17] like the presence.

[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; You know, I've experienced a lot of
[2:57:40] thirst
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; over the years of my life.
[2:57:45] But there was a day when he came to my
[2:57:48] well
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; and I could say like that woman said
[2:57:53] that if you could ever get a drink of
[2:57:54] this water,
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; you'll never thirst again. In fact,
[2:57:58] Jesus said he not only give you a drink,
[2:58:00] he said that he that believeth on me out
[2:58:02] of his belly shall flow a river
[2:58:04] &gt;&gt; of living water.
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, when you get
[2:58:07] thirsty, you don't have to run back to
[2:58:09] the well, don't have to run back to
[2:58:10] youth camp. You have within yourself a
[2:58:14] source of life and strength. Amen.
[2:58:18] That's where we're standing tonight.
[2:58:20] We're not standing on an emotion. We're
[2:58:22] not standing on a feeling. Amen. But
[2:58:24] it's a faith down in your soul that has
[2:58:27] made a contact with God.
[2:58:30] Amen. How many believe he's here
[2:58:33] tonight? How many recognize his
[2:58:35] presence? Amen. It's on a much deeper
[2:58:37] level than we feel that he's here. Amen.
[2:58:40] We know that he's here. We recognize
[2:58:42] that he's here. We believe that he's
[2:58:44] here. It's revealed to us that he's here
[2:58:47] by the message of the hour. So, so
[2:58:49] grateful for the ministry of the word
[2:58:51] tonight, for the moving of the spirit.
[2:58:53] Amen. He's here. And if you recognize
[2:58:56] that he's here, as brother Andrew said
[2:58:59] as he quoted, Amen. then it's it's it's
[2:59:03] bringing the power of his presence on
[2:59:05] the scene for you. Brother Brano said,
[2:59:08] "I believe tonight he said that the Holy
[2:59:10] Spirit is here. It's here for those who
[2:59:13] are destined to receive it."
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; Who that believes it, who's waiting on
[2:59:19] it.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; It's here to straighten out every one of
[2:59:21] them spiritual problems.
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; It's here to heal every sick person
[2:59:26] that's present. It's here, but you've
[2:59:28] got to come and get in the atmosphere of
[2:59:30] it and the attitude to receive it. You
[2:59:34] got to come not in emotional workup, but
[2:59:37] you got to come on the basis of
[2:59:38] believing a promise that God made. Amen.
[2:59:41] Some of you been to this camp 5 years
[2:59:42] now. You know where we stand. Amen.
[2:59:44] Nobody's going to take this pulpit and
[2:59:46] attack you for your enthusiasm. Amen.
[2:59:49] For an emotional praise. Amen. For for
[2:59:52] expressing your heart to God. Amen. But
[2:59:54] but listen, what we're saying is that
[2:59:56] behind all of this bubbling, there's a
[2:59:58] well.
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; There's a well. He said, "And you come
[3:00:02] on the basis of believing a promise that
[3:00:04] God made. That's what does it." Amen.
[3:00:08] Amen. Maybe there's somebody here. You
[3:00:10] know how it is sometimes on the first
[3:00:12] night of a meeting and you you just come
[3:00:15] with a little bit of that coldness on
[3:00:17] you.
[3:00:18] Struggle a little bit to enter in and
[3:00:20] then the devil comes to your mind. He's
[3:00:21] got you all anxious, all nervous.
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that how he works?
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, you know, you're not going to
[3:00:28] get anything. Oh, you're not feeling
[3:00:30] what that one's feeling or acting like
[3:00:31] that one's acting. Listen, friends, put
[3:00:33] that aside tonight. Put it to the side.
[3:00:36] Say, "Lord, I recognize your presence. I
[3:00:38] don't care if I feel a thing. I
[3:00:41] recognize my opportunity,
[3:00:43] and I'm here to get a drink. I'm not
[3:00:45] going to turn down my opportunity, Lord.
[3:00:47] I believe your word. I'm here to receive
[3:00:50] what I came to camp to receive. And I've
[3:00:52] taken a hold of it by faith,
[3:00:55] not by sensation." Amen. Amen. You
[3:00:59] approach You approach God with that kind
[3:01:01] of an attitude this weekend. That's the
[3:01:03] kind of mental attitude that'll bring
[3:01:04] every promise of God to pass. Amen. How
[3:01:08] many going to seize that opportunity?
[3:01:10] God bless you tonight. Amen. There's
[3:01:12] going to be a snack shack behind the
[3:01:14] auditorium here uh selling refreshments
[3:01:17] staffed by the campground staff here
