And when they saw it, Elijah changed it. And he changed from go look for the cloud. He changed it to running down the city, get your barrels out. &gt;&gt; Rains are coming. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen. God supplied it, you know. And I was thinking about having this nice suit and one I got like brother Ray [music] and uh [laughter] I think about having that enjoying it and look over and got a beautiful wife sitting next to me. She's younger than I am, you know, and I I just I just almost let let it just let it go, you know, just thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; and coming here and standing in front of this congregation, see all these wonderful faces and the smiles and the beauty and the hearts and the desire to serve God.

I tell you, he's been so good. Amen. Amen. As we uh come this [music] morning to the word of the Lord. Amen. I uh I'm just I'm just got something on my heart today. Uh, I'm I'm still in this book of Hebrews, but it's just been it's just been a real burden to me. Um, and and I I thought, well, I'm gonna step away from it for this morning, but uh yeah, it just wasn't able to do it. So, I I just want to speak a few things on it. And and just just before we read his [music] word, let's just speak to the author just for a moment. Father, we're so thankful today. Lord, there's just something in our heart that Lord, I am so thankful. I I don't know, Lord, what what I did [music] or said that gained your favor, Lord, that you would allow my heart to be [music] open to your great word. But I am so thankful, Lord. I'm so thankful for this morning for believers that would gather in this room that Lord that they would hear [music and clears throat] this word of life and Lord, it would be strength to them and they would [music] receive it with gladness. And Father, we ask you now as we would read your word, Lord, we know this word. It [music] contains the power of life, Lord, of deliverance, of healing, of mercy. And as we read your word and we speak upon it, we want to [music] invite you that you would come Lord and speak to the needs of your children this morning and you would walk the aisles of this building. We ask you for it now in Jesus name. Amen and amen. And God [music] bless you. If you have your Bibles today in the book of Hebrews, the first chapter, uh I want to [music] read uh chapter verses 1 uh to 3. Hebrews 1 uh 1:3. Amen. Uh there's a [crying] there's such a depth uh in this and I know last Sunday you might have thought I was tying the whole Bible into the first book of Hebrews. Uh but it's there's such a depth in this uh that it uh that it's hard uh just to to maybe say it uh maybe in a in a a teaching way, but you know, sometimes you just say things right out and they are they're more a little more simple, but uh I want you to always know that they're backed up in the word of God. Hebrews chapter 1:es 1:3. Now God who in sunundred times and diverse manners spake in the times past unto the fathers by the prophets. So God did the speaking in various times in various ways by the prophets. &gt;&gt; But hath in these last days, can I just say this? The ultimate messenger. &gt;&gt; He hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he appointed heir of all things. by whom also he made the worlds. Now the Bible says the Lord created the heavens and earth in six days. So then this son is also the Lord. &gt;&gt; He also made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things. &gt;&gt; Somebody say it with me. All things. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; That's a lot of things. [clears throat] Yeah. &gt;&gt; Upholding all things by the word of his power when he had himself purged our sins and sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. May God bless his word as you could be seated this morning. Uh, I want to take an uh maybe a subcontext here for this, but I want to talk to you about dispensing the word of his power. Dispensing the word of his power. As we have been speaking on this, there's been a a strong underlaying of dispensation. And you've been hearing me talk a lot about dispensation, but dispensation is truth. And if you want to know how to serve God and you desire to get something from God, you got to know the dispensation that you're living in. And that dispensation, amen, doesn't change God. It just changes your approach to God. Amen. Uh I I love the story. Brother Bam uses it so much. And he talks about the Sarapheneician woman in the Bible of a woman that was needing something from the Lord. And she approached the same Jesus Christ that blind Bardameus approached when he sat on the on the stone and in that beautiful story and said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me." And and the Bible said, "And the man's blind eyes were healed because he cried for mercy from the son of David." And this woman tried the very same thing. And she and she spoke to him. But we find out because she was a gentile that he wasn't he wasn't even willing to accept her worship when the Bible said she worshiped. Amen. And he spoke not a word to her. And he basically he was ignoring her. Amen. Because she was not approaching him from the right direction from the from the from the right word. Amen. From from her dispensation of being a gentile. But then the Bible says this is what you do when the Lord ain't answering. Now, we all know what to do when he does, but what did it do when he don't? Amen. And the Bible said she worshiped the more. &gt;&gt; She didn't give up on the idea that power is right in front of me. God is standing right here in this man. So, she didn't just worship a little bit because she didn't get a response. She just stopped. The Bible says she worshiped the more and begin to say, "Lord, have mercy on me." And when she used that word Lord, she said the right thing right there because then Amen. then it got the Lord's attention and then he began to speak to her and she said, "Well, I got some need of healing." And he said, "Well," he said, "I didn't isn't healing the children's bread?" And Amen, but you're you're just a dog. In other words, the and and then of course she could have got angry. You know, she could have got angry and said, "Well, if you're not going to help me and you're going to talk to me that way, I'm just going to go now." Amen. But she didn't do that at all. She knew she was in the presence of the one that could change things and help. So then she looked upon him and said, "That's nothing, of course, but the truth." She began an agreement with the word of God in the right age. And what did it do? It released healing unto her. And brother Ram said it very clearly. He said she's the first first miracle among the Gentiles. Amen. And she received it right there by agreeing with the word of God. Amen. Do you see? Had Jesus never spoke to her, there would have never been a place for her agreement. But because he spoke to her because she took the right attitude and she said the right thing. He spoke to her and she agreed with the word. And when she agreed with the word, she got her healing. Amen. Amen. That's exactly where brother takes it. When he talks about Hadtie Wright, amen. When Hadtie Wright receives, Amen. the salvation of her children, Brother Bam said, "What is it that you would have had?" Amen. And she said the right thing. You remember she had said amen to the power of God falling on brother Bam's life. You he he told the story unto you that uh that study you know amen what really was behind the scenes as brother Bam had talked about a seven squirrel and somebody was wondering whether he had told the truth about the story or not. And he went out the next morning and he found the seven squirrel but he didn't find it normally. He just said, "It'll be there under that log." And walked over and picked it up and took it back and said, "Here's the seventh squirrel." Amen. And somebody in the room, amen, was well well, we knew you would find it. Basically, they were calling him like he was telling the story wrong. And and and Hadtie said, "Brother Bam said, how in the world did that happen?" She said, "Well," he said, "Well, sister had all I can tell you is it like it was when Abraham was up there on that mountain and that ram was in that bush." He said he's still the same Jehovah Gyra. And that lady had the right thing. She said that ain't nothing but the truth. Amen. And there come an agreement with the word of God. And when that agreement came, the power of salvation fell in that room and her children were saved. And I I TELL YOU, IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING FROM GOD, just start agreeing with the word of God. Amen. Amen. When the WORD OF GOD SAYS SOMETHING, PUT YOUR HEART WITH IT and begin to agree with it. Amen. AND YOU WILL FIND that it WILL UNLOCK A POWER TO YOU. AMEN. That goes back to the very source of almighty God. We're not talking about denominational power. We're not talking about rel religiosity or traditional power. We're talking about the power of God is released when you go into agreement with the word of the age that you're living in. &gt;&gt; My when I think about that today, I I think about these beautiful scriptures that are laying here. Amen. When the when when when when Paul is trying to tell the Hebrews, he's trying to tell them, "Listen, Amen. I know you have your Jewish laws and you have your prophets and you have your Jewish traditions and and it's all laying there." Amen. But there's a power to be excessed by the one that created the heavens and the earth. Amen. Has changed sensations. And he's the same God. Amen. But these things have been given to you and I through the word of God. When I I think about that this morning, I think about the parallel of that time because in the changing of dispensations, that's when people get mixed up. You know, Brother Brandon said it. He said it's hard for the Lutheran to see. He said when the Wesley begin to preach the message of sanctification, he said so hard for them to see it. He said, "And when the Pentecostals begin to receive the gifts and the spirit began to fall, he said IT WAS SO HARD FOR them Wesley and that that sanctified group, it was so hard for them to receive the moving of that spirit." He said, "And is it's so hard today for those Pentecostals to see the message of the hour. It's hard for them to see it, but God sent it anyhow." Amen. And what they don't realize is every bit of the power that they experienced in Isuza Street, God wasn't taking that away. When he brought the word, he was giving an access not to just a part of it, BUT TO THE COMPLETE POWER of God through the message of the hour. When I think about this today, I think of the prophet of God and the unveiling of God. And he begins to talk to the church. And he said, now notice here, he says, he came as a prophet and they crucified him. He said he came, amen, as the son of man. Then after the Holy Spirit came, he was then the son of God. God is a spirit. And he was the Holy Spirit, son of God who lived through the church ages as the son of God. And in the millennium, he'll be the son of David. Now, we're changing dispensations. He'll be the king, the son of David in the millennium, sitting upon the throne of his father, David. He is the son of David. Now, and remember between the son of God and the Leodysia church age had put him out and Luke said he would be revealed again as the son of man the prophet will be fulfilling the rest of it. See the scripture ties perfectly together. The son of man, the son of God, the son of David. What is it? It's the same God all the time. He said just changing his form. Amen. What is it? It's just changed. It's the same God all the time. It's just changed. NOW, WHAT HE'S DOING IS is when he comes to fulfill the scriptures. It's not that he does away with it. He fulfills it so as that you will know if you are a workman of God. The Bible said that we had to rightly divide the word of truth that the workman be not ashamed. Is that right? So, brother Random tell us this. He'll say you can't do Saturday's work on Tuesday and you can't do Amen. Sunday's work on Saturday. And brother Brandham is telling us in the rising of the sun, this ain't Saturday, folks. Amen. IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S telling you this is not just another Pentecostal age. This is the resurrection of the SON OF GOD. WE HAVE WENT BACK TO THE FIRST day again. THE CHURCH IS AN ORDER OF THE NEW CREATION. WE'RE NOT JUST A A LITTLE AMPED UP PENTECOSTALS. WE'RE NOT PENTECOSTALS THAT JUST UH AMEN. STUDIED THE WORD A LITTLE BETTER. AMEN. WE'RE OF THE ORIGINAL BRANCH OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH. AND THIS WORD HAS BROUGHT US BACK TO THE FOUNDATION of the teachings of the word of God in the age we're living in. And now what it's done is this message has fulfilled the generations. NOW IN GOD'S chosen place of worship, how many knows God chooses where you worship? &gt;&gt; IN GOD'S CHOSEN PLACE OF WORSHIP, brother Bam said, I want to ask you something. HE SAID WE MIGHT SAY IN Malachi 4 that aren't we also a promised an eagle a pillar of fire to be following to cho show the Aaron church of this day that in Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus the same yesterday today and forever aren't we promised another one to come flying from the wilderness that's exactly the truth how fitting and matching is Luke 17:30 where the son of man eagle will be revealing himself to bring to not all other worship places such as denominations and so forth. Now, that I want you to hear what he just said. He said, "It'll come to not." Now, that's a good hillbilly word. Amen. It'll come to nothing. In other words, when this message comes forward, Amen. The only approach and worship to God is under what he releases. Now, somebody said, "Well, then you mean, AMEN, YOU GOT to come to BUT BUT IF YOU JUST MAKE IT the message of William Brandom, that's cultish, friends. that that's just another creed, another denomination. But if you recognize that it's not just the message of William Brandham we're talking about, it is the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And the FIRST PART OF THAT SECOND COMING IS ATTACHED TO THE APPEARING of the son of man which is fulfilling 1 Thessalonians 4, Luke 17, Malachi 4, Revelations 10, REVELATIONS 5, the end of Revelations 3. SEE, IT'S THE FULFILLING OF THE WORD OF GOD. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT A MAN, A KUCKIAN. IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST THAT HILLBILLY BROTHER BRANDHAM AS GOD BLESS HIM. We love Brother Brandham. Don't Amen. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. DON'T YOU REDUCE OR WEAKEN THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO JUST ONE MAN. THIS IS THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND MANIFEST AND FULFILL THE WORD OF THE AGE WE'RE LIVING IN. WE HAVE CHANGED IN DISPENSATIONS. WE ARE NOT JUST IN THE CHURCH AGE AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE COME INTO THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE AGE WE'RE living in. My goodness, to bring to place all other worship. In other words, you know, you can worship God and it be in vain. There are many gatherings this morning, Amen, that's in vain. I I hate to sound that way, but folks, it's in vain. Amen. Don't you start looking at other generations and other denominations and thinking, "Well, it ain't so bad after all." Yes, it is. No, no, it is not worship to God. It's the truth, folks. Amen. What is it? Amen. It's brought to not all other places of worship. You know, the Bible tells us, Amen, that it'll come to pass in the last days that it'll be such a deception, AMEN, THAT EVEN the elect would be deceived if it was possible. But it's NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE GOD HAD PUT a seed inside of your heart to recognize THE CHANGE THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS GENERATION. My goodness, to think of this. Brother Bam said in Malachi 4, he'll turn the hearts of these children. These things are not for another age. This baptism in Jesus' name is not for back there. He's now the same. And he's brought to not all other places of worship. That's what this last a eagle is to do. Amen. The rest of it is foolishness and denominational folly. &gt;&gt; THE REST OF IT IS foolishness and denominational folly. Amen. but to point them again with the same sign. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. We have not just received a prophet, we have received the son of man. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. See what is going on. You you see what Paul is introducing back here in the Hebrews is he's telling those Jews, this is more than just this what you're what you're calling Jesus of Nazareth and just this movement around this man. And it THAT'S ALL THEY THOUGHT IT WAS IS THIS DRUNKEN soldier son and he's a bastard born and you can make fun of him AND YOU YOU SEE WHAT THEY SAW. THEY THEY THEY RIDICULED it and within their own camps THEY SO MINIMIZED IT THAT IT REALLY HAD NO IMPORTANCE AT ALL. BUT WHEN ISAIAH SAW IT, HE SAID, "MY, WHEN HE COMES," HE SAID, "THE MOUNTAINS WILL BECOME low and THE AND THE VALLEYS WILL BECOME HIGH AND THE CROOKED PLACES WILL BECOME STRAIGHT." ISAIAH SAW IT AS CATACLYSMIC CHANGE UPON THE FACE OF GOD'S CREATION. AND WHEN THE PHARISEES SAW IT, they saw nothing more, amen, than something they could laugh and SCORN AND MAKE FUN OF. But when HE DIED AND WAS BURIED and resurrected again, WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED him in Jerusalem, it all changed right there. and they can crucify another million lambs and it has no effect with God. &gt;&gt; My goodness. I'll tell you, brother man SAID IT LIKE THIS. GOD IS CHRIST as God's provided lamb. How appropriate. Showing that Jerusalem was ceasing and it was in effect until the hour the blood of the lamb was all right until that day. Do you know the crucifixion changed it &gt;&gt; and the old system was done? &gt;&gt; Now you you notice the Bible there. They crucified him. Brother Brham said the most holy people, the most holy city, the most holy God. There they crucified him. And somebody says to me, "Brother Wayne, when did the dispensation change?" Brother Brham said the crucifixion changed it. &gt;&gt; We had the message a long time before they crucified it. &gt;&gt; JUST GO WATCH OUR LORD JESUS AND WATCH HIM ON THE earth 33 years. But when they crucified him, it changed &gt;&gt; UNTIL THAT VERY HOUR. BUT THEN THEY CRUCIFIED HIM. It changed. And brother Bam said the crucifixion is what changes it. The old system is done and there was a new one and the lamb was a sacrifice. Now they were condemning and doing the very thing they had to do. That's right. God be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day because the churches are doing the same thing again today until the hour that the organization and religion is condemned. And they have proved to be sacrificing Christ's word. From then on comes the word and the word only. My, that's a refrigerator quote for you. It's the word and the word only. We're not joining a denomination. We're not joining a creed OR A GROUP OF brothers or SOME ORGANIZATION. AMEN. FROM that moment on, it is the word and the word only. AND THE WORD COMES to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can get together with all your buddies AND AND MAKE UP A BELIEF SYSTEM. And God ain't going to order it. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU CAN SEE A WHOLE GROUP OF GUYS CAN GET TOGETHER AND SAY, "WELL, THEM THEM BUNCH OF RANDOMMITES DOWN THERE. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF CRAZY PEOPLE AND YOU AIN'T GOT TO LISTEN TO THEM." AND GOD AIN'T HONORING one thing they have to say. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to take it a little deeper for just a moment. And that DEVIL CAN GET ALL OF THE HIS LITTLE DEMONS AROUND him and they can have them a real rally and revival and they can make fun of YOU AND TALK BAD ABOUT YOU AND THEY SAY, "WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT MAN, HE AIN'T NO GOOD FOR NOTHING." AND AND I'LL TELL YOU AND AND THEY CAN JUST START PILING IT ON AND THEY'LL COME RIGHT TO YOUR SLEEP AND THEY'LL GET THAT WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING, THEY'LL BE RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE NO GOOD. AND AMEN. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HEAR ONE word of it. &gt;&gt; THE MOMENT THEY CRUCIFIED THIS WORD, IT BECAME THE WORD AND THE WORD ONLY. AMEN. IF THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "I WAS A SON BEFORE THE WORLD EVER BEGAN. I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR NOTHING ELSE. I AIN'T GOT TO TALK TO NOBODY. I AIN'T GOT TO ASK SOMEBODY. I DON'T HAVE TO GET CHURCH PERMISSION. I DON'T HAVE TO GET A PREACHERS'S PERMISSION. AMEN. I'M A SON BECAUSE HE SAID I'M A SON. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO BE TO GOD. AMEN. FORGET IT. AWAY WITH RELIGION. WHAT DOES THE WORD OF GOD SAY ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; SHE'S A SPOTLESS BRIDE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND THOUGH HALF OF THE NATION THINKS SOMETHING CRAZY ABOUT YOU, IT DON'T MATTER WHAT THEY THINK about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the greatest delivering power in the world is when you quit caring what people think about you. &gt;&gt; When you let the words of man lose gravity over you and you just believe the word of God, &gt;&gt; IF THEY SPOKE THAT WAY OF OUR LORD, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT them to say about you? &gt;&gt; It was so far that the Bible said, "When all men speak well of you, YOU TAKE HEED. YOU WATCH OUT. WHEN EVERYBODY TALKS GOOD ABOUT YOU, YOU WATCH OUT. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A GOOD TESTIMONY among your own. AMEN. BUT PEOPLE'S GOING TO THINK YOU'RE A FANATIC. WHO CARES? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You really believe in THAT HOLY GHOST STUFF AND ROLLING IN THE FLOOR AND STUFF. ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. I'm a one of them. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL really believe in like PILLARS OF FIRE AND PROPHETIC THINGS. And y'all really believe in that? I'm one of them. Amen. Before I could read THE BIBLE, GOOD, I ALREADY HEARD WHAT JESUS COULD DO. DON'T TELL ME BECAUSE I LEARNED TO READ THE BIBLE. AMEN. THAT JESUS QUIT DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE I HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; BEFORE I GOT SAVED, I KNEW HE WAS A CREATOR AND A HEALER. AND I KNEW BEFORE I WAS SAVED, I KNEW HE WAS MIGHTY AND POWERFUL. AMEN. COME ON. THERE'S THERE'S PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD THAT AIN'T even ever heard of the message. Amen. I'll tell you the miracle working power working of God. IT DON'T TELL ME WE come in the message and then somehow that dampened or watered down. &gt;&gt; You see that old pascal lamb passed away and Christ become our lamb at the crucifixion. &gt;&gt; And the day the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted creed instead of the word. That's the day &gt;&gt; that the word come into full effect. &gt;&gt; That's just been recently. That's out of the second the indictment of this generation. Brother Bam indicted them for the second crucifixion of our Lord Jesus. He said not on a cross, a rugged wood cross. He said from a wooden pull pit they did it. &gt;&gt; He said but they can't crucify the flesh cuz it ain't here. He said so they'll crucify the effect of that word. &gt;&gt; My it's no good and it's just another man and it's &gt;&gt; Amen. But the day they crucified it, they become ineffective places of worship. and from the word and the word only. Amen. Brother man said it was the end of the church age. The son of man was revealed and Jesus was ending that Jewish age. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God was entering ending in end ending this gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's I don't have time to preach these things, but I'll give it to you. That's why he said the seven seal ends all things. &gt;&gt; Did it end it right then? No. &gt;&gt; But it ends all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when a prophet began to announce it, it was over. Whether it was a day or a year or a month, it's over. &gt;&gt; Now, now watch it. Watch, Brother Bam. I I often I often say it like this. You climb you climb top of a tower. If you could see Goomer about at about uh 10:00 this morning, had you been real high with a good pair of binoculars and you could have seen me leave my driveway and you could have announced to the people standing around that tire, "Hey, Brother Wayne's coming." But it would HAVE BEEN A HALF HOUR BEFORE I pulled up in that drive out there. Amen. BUT WHEN DID I LEAVE? &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN THE GUY SAW ME DO IT &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE HAD A PROPHET AMONG US THAT HAS CLIMBED UP THERE IN ANOTHER WORLD and made an ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CHURCH. WE HAVE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE PENTECOSTALS. WE HAVE GOT THE WORD OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND GOD HAS BROUGHT US OUT OF ALL THE DEAD DARK DENOMINATIONALISM AND THE CONFUSION OF THIS AGE. WE HAVE A MESSAGE. GLORY BE TO GOD. I'm so glad this morning that I'm not in the hands of a bunch of traditional idealists and amen and confusion and amen following somebody this way and follow another guy that way and following it this way. Oh, I say amen, raise up the banner of the pillar of fire AND LET'S FOLLOW HIM. AMEN. THE LEADER OF THE CHURCH. Let's follow him. &gt;&gt; It's the son of man. Amen. I I know you're familiar with these things. That's why I hit them fastly. Amen. It's the son of man. These words are fulfilled before us. If you're watching, watch the attraction. Brother said, "3 years ago, these things was a prophecy." But what time is it, sir? It was a prophecy. But now is it history? The promise is fulfilled. So what time is it? And what's the attraction? God fulfills his word. SO YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT TIME is it? God fulfilled his word. That's the time. It's the time that when God does it, then you turn to what God did. We're at the end time. End time evangelism. Brother Brand, I'm going to say this. We're at the end time. You see, we have changed dispensations from the old church age back there where the dismal day was. And we got to join the church and put your name on a book until the evening light, the restoration, the return again of the Holy Spirit upon the earth. Another Pentecost, another sign, ANOTHER THING THAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE. AND ALL THE people doesn't believe it because they're SO SET LIKE THEY was in the days of Jesus. And he told us this day would be here. It is a changing of dispensation. &gt;&gt; It is a changing of dispensation. Watch here in the adoption. I love this little uh quote here. You believe in dispensations of the Bible. Amen. See the dispensation of the fullness of time. There's been a dispensation SEE OF THE MOSAIC LAW. There's been a dis dispensation of John the Baptist. There was a dispensation of Christ. There's a dispensation of church organization. There's a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. BUT NOW IT'S the dispensation OF ADOPTION. HALLELUJAH. THE CHURCH IS GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MIND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE, FOLK. WE'RE NOT JUST FLOATING ALONG AS CHURCH MEMBERS. WE HAVE DIRECTION by the pillar of fire. We're going somewhere. &gt;&gt; Can I pull up Hebrews chapter 1 and verse three? I want to read this to you again. Who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things. Somebody say it with me. Upholding all things. Upholding all things by the word of his power. Now, I want you to think about this. Not just spiritual things. We're not just talking about spiritual things. We're talking about all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just spirit things, but all things. FROM THE GALAXIES IN heaven to the breath in your lungs, he upholds all things. &gt;&gt; My, if you got breath this morning, that's why the Bible said every man that have breath. LET HIM PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; That breath don't belong to you. IT BELONGS TO GOD. YOU'RE UPHELD. THE VERY THE VERY LIFE THAT YOU HAVE THIS MORNING comes from God. Everything around you, all things are upheld by the word of his power. AMEN. SEE, GOD DOES NOT UPHOLD THINGS WITH ARMIES. He doesn't uphold it with effort. Aren't you glad? It's not human effort. It's not human ability. He doesn't uphold IT LIKE THAT. HE DOESN'T even hold it even maybe with his hands. But he upholds it with his word. &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS IS NOT JUST A PASSIVE STATEMENT. THIS IS ACTIVE and constant sustaining OF THE SOVEREIGN ONE OF GOD. THIS Y'ALL REALIZE that this word I just love this word upholding. Amen. It's upholding. Look how he says upholding. Not just uphold. Upholding. &gt;&gt; Now, it matters because in the Greek, this word is not a noun or an adjective. It's a verb. &gt;&gt; This is an action statement. YOU I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT IT. WELL, HE UPHOLDS THINGS LIKE HE JUST TAKES IT IN HIS HAND. He holds it up. Amen. That's no. HE'S UPHOLDING. IT'S a it's a it's an active verb. It's something THAT HE CONTINUES TO DO. HERE WE ARE 4,000 YEARS PAST CREATION AND GOD'S STILL HOLDING THE UNIVERSE. &gt;&gt; I was listening to the brother Bram last night and the power of God. He said, "You tell me when it turns nighttime who hangs out all the stars in the heavens?" He said, "The power of God." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHO IS IT IN THE MORNING TOOK the sun and put it there?" Amen. And told it to rise? He said it was God. WHO IS IT THAT TAKES A BRUSH AND THE SUNSET AND BRUSHES THE PAINTS THE THE SKIES AND THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL? HE SAID IT'S THE POWER OF GOD. AMEN. WHAT IS IT MAKES THE SONG IN THE BIRD? IT'S THE POWER OF GOD. WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU COME TO CHURCH AND WORSHIP ON A SUNDAY MORNING? IT'S THE POWER OF GOD. AMEN. HE IS UPHOLDING ALL THINGS &gt;&gt; BY THE power of God. &gt;&gt; My when I think about him upholding these things by his word, not with armies or efforts, but by the word of God. It's a Greek word fiel which means to carry to bear forward toward a goal. It's the idea that Jesus didn't just hold creation, but he's moving it toward a purpose. &gt;&gt; He's moving it toward a purpose. Amen. You know, the word was powerful in creation. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; There was. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be," it responded. &gt;&gt; It's not because of the power of the word. &gt;&gt; It's because of who spoke. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, it was the word of creative power that was speaking. &gt;&gt; So when he spoke something, something responded &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS CREATION. THAT SAME one that said, "Let there be," stood on the bow of a boat, in the Bible and said, "Peace be still." to the waves he created. &gt;&gt; Because the words, "PEACE BE STILL," COULD HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY MANY PEOPLE. BUT WHEN THE ONE WHO CREATED THE WAVES SAID, "PEACE, BE STILL," THEY HELD STILL BECAUSE IT WAS POWER THAT WAS SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T just empty words. It wasn't just man's words. It was the power of God released upon that storm by word. &gt;&gt; My when I think about it, I think about that same one that walked to Lazarus tomb and said, "Lazarus, come out of there." They thought it was too late, folk. Everybody thought it was too late. &gt;&gt; They thought it was too late for revival. you know, it's too late for something to happen. IT'S TOO LATE. AMEN. GIVE UP ON THAT PERSON. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST TOO MUCH, TOO LATE. THEY'RE ALREADY STINKING and rotten. They're full of the world. There's no helping THEM AT ALL. SEE, BUT BUT BUT EVEN MARTHA SAID TO THE LORD, "LORD, HAD YOU BEEN HERE, HAD THEY BEEN AWARE OF THIS, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DIED." And Jesus said, "Martha, even now, Amen. Right now, I am the resurrection and the life. And he that believeth on me, though he were dead, he shall live. WHOSOEVER LIVETH AND BELIEVETH IN ME SHALL NEVER DIE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? HE SAYS, DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? AND BY THE WORD of his power, HE TURNED AROUND. THE POWER OF RESURRECTION WAS IN HIM. HE SAID, HE SAID, LAZARUS, COME FORTH. Oh God, I love it. And brother Bon said it. He said, if he' have said that in general, the whole the whole graveyard would have EMPTIED BECAUSE POWER WAS SPEAKING. HE HAD to name Lazarus. He had to he had to name him or there WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHURCHWIDE REVIVAL. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NATIONWIDE REVIVAL. BUT IF HE' JUST SPEAK THAT NAME, IT WOULD BE TO THE INDIVIDUAL HE MEANT IT TO BE. IT WAS NOT a powerful word for the man laying NEXT TO HIM. IT WASN'T POWERFUL FOR THE MAN THREE TOMBS DOWN. BUT THE MAN NAMED LAZARUS, IT WAS THE WORD OF HIS POWER THAT SPOKE TO HIM. AND HE HAD TO COME FROM THE DEAD TO AGREE WITH IT. HALLELUJAH. HE HAD TO COME OUT OF THE DEAD TO AGREE WITH IT. AND I'LL TELL YOU, SOMETIMES GOD'S GOT TO BRING YOU OUT OF A STATE OF WHEN YOU GET NERVOUS AND UNDERNEATH THINGS AND ALL THIS AND HE'LL PREACH A WORD RIGHT TO YOU, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COME OUT OF IT TO RESPOND TO IT. I SAY COME OUT OF IT. I SAY AWAKE AND RISE, OH THOU THAT SLEEPEST, AND AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD. THAT'S A WORD FOR ME THIS MORNING. THAT'S A WORD FOR MY LIFE TODAY. WON'T MEAN nothing to a guy three rows down, but in my heart, HE SPOKE MY NAME. &gt;&gt; Somebody give ME SOME ROOM. HALLELUJAH. TELL SOMEBODY, GIVE ME SOME ROOM. I FEEL LIKE PRAISING GOD THIS MORNING. I FEEL LIKE PRAISING. I FEEL LIKE RESPONDING TO THE WORD OF GOD. I FEEL LIKE AGREEING TO THE WORD OF GOD. I'M LOOKING FOR A SUPERNATURAL MOVE IN THE HOLY GHOST. AND THE WORD IS COMING. AND THE WORD IS COMING. MY OPPORTUNITY HAS ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; You wake up on Friday, say, "Well, I can't wait for Sunday." You can wake up on Saturday, you say, "I can't wait for Sunday." Well, Sunday is here. Amen. You have arrived. You ain't got to wait another hour, another day, and man of God is preaching THE WORD OF GOD. YOU GOT A SEED IN YOU THAT HAS A NEED FOR THE WORD OF GOD. AND THAT IS THE WORD OF HIS POWER THAT IS coming into your heart this word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to wake up to respond. &gt;&gt; Well, [sighs] &gt;&gt; you know what had to happen? Demons had to let go of him. &gt;&gt; Corruption had turned him loose. &gt;&gt; When it was spoken, it wasn't just awaken, &gt;&gt; it was loosening. &gt;&gt; Look, look what he done. The word upheld. And it it didn't just awaken him. It took him from an awakening state. And the word produced a transformation THAT PUT HIM BACK LIKE HE WAS BEFORE SICKNESS GOT A HOLD OF IT. THIS WORD, THIS MESSAGE IS NOT JUST TO WAKE YOU UP OR JUST TO GIVE YOU A NEW BIRTH. IT'S TO PUT YOU BACK IN THE ORIGINAL STATE THAT GOD HAD IN HIS MIND OF WHAT A TRUE SON IS. COME ON. WE'RE NOT A CHURCH. WE'RE A SON, A DAUGHTER OF GOD, THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. IT WAS BUILT TO DO MORE THAN JUST GIVE YOU a birth. &gt;&gt; IT'S UPHOLDING YOU. IT'S MOVING YOU. IT'S BEARING YOU. HE'S BEARING YOU ON EAGLE'S WINGS. HE'S PICKED YOU UP AND HE'S CARRYING YOU INTO the adoption. &gt;&gt; Do you see that dispensation's adoption, folks? &gt;&gt; So, you're hearing the word of your adoption. &gt;&gt; You remember the story? He would took him out on a in a and the angels would take him in a public place and then announce authority over him. What do you think happened when the seals opened, &gt;&gt; we had them out? We had a a Jordan and transfiguration and so did we have an Ohio &gt;&gt; and a sunset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And on sunset a word opened. &gt;&gt; And that word brought to not all your other teachings. It finished &gt;&gt; everything everybody else was telling you. &gt;&gt; Come on, Moses. It was the end of your Egyptian education. That's what happened. &gt;&gt; And God sent a word at an appointed time by angels to announce over brother said they come for that day. He said the word of God came for you. Right &gt;&gt; now, think of this because it's a word of adoption. This this word furial, it's a beautiful word. It's powerful, more more powerful than we could ever exhibit here. But I'll say this, it means to bear, to bring forth, to carry. It means to be driven, to endure, to go on, to lay, to lead, to move, to reach, to rushing, to uphold. So it's an active word. &gt;&gt; Now, if you read that again, it's so odd how it reads. and upholding all things by the word of his power. You know, the Bible said the word doesn't go out void, &gt;&gt; but it'll uphold all things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It'll accomplish. &gt;&gt; It'll it it'll accomplish that which was spoken &gt;&gt; until it fulfillment. Uh uh in first Peter, the same word uh Greek is used. 1st Peter 1:13, it's beautiful. He says, "Being brought," see, completely the hope of grace now being brought. But pull that up in the in the uh 1st Peter 1:13. Read it like this. Wherefore g your loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation Jesus Christ. How many knows what grace that is right there? &gt;&gt; There was a grace delivered and then there's a grace to be brought. &gt;&gt; That's why that Zechariah 4 said grace. Grace to the headstone. grace that started the dispensation &gt;&gt; and a grace to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Which we would title it rapture grace. &gt;&gt; That's why when the thunder's open, brother Bram said it'll be faith for grace. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you can't set this grace without faith. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. But watch what he says under the hope of him. For the grace that is brought unto Now watch this. The fuller expanded rendering of this Greek. Amen. I'm just reading it out of dictionary. Yes. He says, "Having girded up the loins of your mind, being radically moderate, completely hope on the grace being carried along to you in the revelation concerning Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; The word is carrying along &gt;&gt; something that that will be revealed to you. It's carrying along. Don't you think every writer here put something in here for you? &gt;&gt; And it was carried along. The word was carrying along something &gt;&gt; that would be revealed at the revelation. It means to bear up to carry. Now I I I think this this is an amazing um section of of scripture. I I like I like how he says it here. He said the following is an expanded view of this. We're in in the view of the meaning of salvation that extends to glorification. A salvation that extends. So he upholds all things. So it extends unto glorification. In other words, this word of his power will move you &gt;&gt; from salvation to glorification. &gt;&gt; As brother Bam teaches us, we're in a humiliated tabernacle. &gt;&gt; But we're moving to a glorified tabernacle. &gt;&gt; How are you going to go from humiliation to glorification? How you getting there? &gt;&gt; The word of his power. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the agent that will carry you from humiliation to glorification. It's what will carry you from sadness to joy. &gt;&gt; It's what's going to carry you from sickness to health. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T HE SAY, "I'LL SEND MY WORD AND I'll heal them." &gt;&gt; Amen. When his WORD COMES, THE HEALER is in that word. AND IF YOU'RE SICK AND YOU NEED HEALING, THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL uphold you in that word AND IT'LL BEAR YOU TO A HEALING. IT'LL BRING YOU TO YOUR HEALING. BROTHER said it would. He said when you have prayer OVER YOU AND THE BIBLE SAID CONFESS YOUR faults one to the other and then lay hands AND HAVE PRAYER. BROTHER Ba on every time nearly he prayed for somebody, he followed it up by saying, "Now go thank the Lord for your healing &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WORD YOU GO THANKING GOD FOR WHAT YOU DID AND HE IS A HIGH PRIEST OF YOUR CONFESSION." AMEN. ISN'T IT SOMETHING THAT GOD GIVE US SOMETHING TO SAY? Y'ALL Y'ALL have heard me preach on old uh that that blind fell the sitting in the barber chair. I forget his name just now, but Amen. He he said in the he said in the barber chair and and brother Bham said when he come into prayer line he was blind. Brother Bham said you're going to heal. Thus sayith the Lord you're healed. And he left blind come back in the prayer line blind. And he said brother Brandham you said I was healed. Brother Bam said you said you believe me. &gt;&gt; I can't see. He said what's that got to do with it? And and the man said, BROTHER B SAID, "THEN I SAW I had to give him something to say, &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; of his healing." &gt;&gt; BROTHER MAN SAID, "YOU GO TESTIFY YOU'VE BEEN HEALED." Nothing changed. &gt;&gt; His eyesight DIDN'T CHANGE. HIS AMEN. NOTHING CHANGED, &gt;&gt; BUT HIS CONFESSION. AND WHEN HE LEFT AGREEING, &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO AGREE WITH. AND WHEN HE LEFT AGREEING, HE COME BACK HEALED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT TOOK HIM FROM HIS BLINDNESS TO HIS SIGHT. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU TODAY, YOU TAKE A HOLD OF THIS MESSAGE AND YOU SAY WHAT THE PROPHET SAID ON THESE BOOKS AND TAPES AND IT'LL TAKE YOU FROM THIS MORTALITY IMMORTALITY. IT'LL TAKE YOU FROM A LAND OF DARKNESS AND CLOUDINESS AND CONFUSION INTO THE LAND THAT'S BRIGHTER THAN DAY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. It'll carry you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother man says, "Who's got any more power than God?" So, what kind of power have you got? Amen. Uh, overtake you that'll care for you. The power that created the universe. What power is taking care of you more. It's the power that created the universe. Now, in this sign of the end, Brother Bam makes this statement. He says, "See, now there's a third pull coming. Don't you try to explain it. See how I approached it tonight. I feel duty bound to my church to say something to draw your own conclusion. Amen. Brother Bam laid out a lot of stuff. Said now draw your conclusion from this. Is it the thunders or is it the climax of my ministry or is it the seven seal or he named several things. Well, if you'd like to study the message, it was all those things. Okay. &gt;&gt; This the third pull was all those things. The same as Jesus was the high priest, the lamb. All of them was a type of something. And it all pointed to him. &gt;&gt; And that's why when you get to the third pole, you start to recognize that it was him. &gt;&gt; See, the third pull was Christ. It wasn't It wasn't Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; It was him. That's why Brother Brham said, "Watch these first two pools. Satan can impersonate them." &gt;&gt; He said, "Matter of fact, Satan can impersonate anything God does, but he can't be him." &gt;&gt; And you see what he says about that third pole. They'll never impersonate it &gt;&gt; because it's him. That's right. &gt;&gt; It was him doing the speaking. &gt;&gt; How could William Brandham create that squirrel? &gt;&gt; HE COULD ONLY SPEAK IT. BUT IF IT WASN'T THE WORD OF POWER, IT WOULDN'T HAVE NEVER DONE NOTHING. &gt;&gt; You see, BUT WHEN HE SPEAKS, AMEN. THE CREATIVE power is in his word. &gt;&gt; I I I thank God. Amen. Do you see brother Bam said that this mystery will begin to open up and it'll bring power to the church. And it'll bring power to the church. You want to experience power, real power in your life, learn your dispensation. It's adoption. &gt;&gt; Learn the messenger of your dispensation. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Do do you see how everybody's getting mixed up and they want that eighth messenger? &gt;&gt; Well, listen. There is an eighth messenger. It's Christ. Somebody said to me one time, "If it's a bride age, who's the messenger?" Christ. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of there's a lot of names out there. People trying to make eighth messengers and eighth ages and all that stuff. Amen. YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO? BUT they're the truth ALWAYS HAS TO SURVIVE the fanaticism. &gt;&gt; THERE AND THERE IS A MESSENGER OF THIS AGE, BUT THAT MESSENGER IS CHRIST. AND BECAUSE HE WAS OPERATING IN THE HUMAN BODY OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM, EVERYBODY CAN'T GET THE TWO SEPARATED. &gt;&gt; But if YOU CAN GET IT SEPARATED, IT WAS MORE THAN A MAN SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, buckle your seat belt. &gt;&gt; But when the angel of the Lord moves down, it becomes a voice of God to you. IF I OFFENDED YOU BY saying that, forgive me. But I felt that might have been resented. &gt;&gt; But I am God's voice to you. &gt;&gt; That was an echo, wasn't it? Boom. Glory to God. I SAY THAT AGAIN. THE TIME was under inspiration. I felt bad about it the first time, but it repeated it. Amen. I like that revelation. It's the echo of Revelations 18, right? Come out of my people. Come out of heaven. But brother Bram said, "It's the seventh angel on earth that said it." But the heaven so recognized the message on earth that it just echoed it back. &gt;&gt; And here, brother Bram says that I'm God's voice and an echo come right back. But where did the echo come from? &gt;&gt; IT COME OUT OF THE SAME GUY. &gt;&gt; Look at this. AMEN. BROTHER RAM IS SAYING, "I FELT bad the first time, but he repeated it." &gt;&gt; Now in anointed ones of the end time, Brother Brandham tells us over and over, but this is a beautiful setting. He said, listen now. HE SAYS, "I WASN'T THE ONE THAT appeared down on the river. &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he appeared. I'm not the one that performs things and fortells things and happens as perfectly. I'm only the one that's near when he does it. I was only a voice that he used &gt;&gt; TO SAY IT." &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT wasn't what I knew, it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through isn't me. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the seventh angel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE MANIFESTATION of the son of man. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THE SEVENTH ANGEL. &gt;&gt; SEE, now to a whole group of people, you just demoted brother Brandham. You just That's real almost blasphemy. It wasn't the seventh angel, did it? Amen. But to another group, Amen. You see, it's a revelation to us that brother Brandon was born to prophet. But a prophet is a channel that another being was using. I RECOGNIZE THE BEING that was using THAT MAN AS THE SAME JESUS THAT WAS IN THIS BIBLE. MATTER OF FACT, ISAIAH WAS THE ONE THAT CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND HE INTRODUCED THIS AGE TO &gt;&gt; OH, WE HAVE SEEN HIM. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE HANDLED HIM. WE HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; Our eyes have beheld my you. YOU SAY, "PREACHER, what are YOU TALKING ABOUT?" HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN. It wasn't the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No. Come on. Brother Bram's voice wouldn't do to you what this message does to you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How in the world? &gt;&gt; How could that man's voice rearrange your entire life? &gt;&gt; Just a man. Come on. &gt;&gt; Brother Ronnie uh over there in West Virginia. Brother Ronnie. Uh, yeah, man. I'm forgetting names like crazy today. Amen. Brother, Brother Brother Ronnie uh used to go up there and Ron Lily, he used to go up there in Canada and he visited with a group up there and they they got these tapes into the into the library of the prisons and they had a they had a guy who was having serious temper problems and he he went off on this temper fit and and and and somebody had bought him a tape recorder and they put him in confinement and put him in there with a tape and tape recorder, some of the other inmates and they pushed play on the thing and he sat in there and it so mellowled him out &gt;&gt; that they started using it like a prescription for people who were having anger problems in the college or in the prison. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, "PREACHER, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M SAYING THAT THE BIBLE SAID IT WAS THE PRINCE OF PEACE." &gt;&gt; HOW CAN THAT LITTLE TAPE BRING PEACE RIGHT IN THAT HOME IN THE MIDST OF I I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HOW CAN IT JUST BRING PEACE RIGHT IN THERE? I GOT TO THINKING about this this morning. Me and brother Isaac standing out there. I got to thinking about that when the writers start writing about him and he said, "Oh, he's the prince of peace." And I thought, "I'm glad he didn't stop there. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't just say he's the prince of peace and feel the end of his commitment." But he went on to say he's the mighty God. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE EVERLASTING FATHER. &gt;&gt; I SAY TELL ON PROPHET. AREN'T YOU GLAD BROTHER BRANDON DIDN'T COME TO 54 AND QUIT? OR HE COME TO 56 AND QUIT? AIN'T YOU GLAD THAT HE KEPT PREACHING? AMEN. UNTIL HE TOLD IT ALL, UNTIL WE HAD A MESSAGE BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE IS THE WORD OF HIS POWER. &gt;&gt; He gave us something to agree with. &gt;&gt; WILL PAUL BE JUDGED? OH, THEN I PREACHED WHAT PAUL AND THERE WAS A LOT OF people said. &gt;&gt; We're resting on that. DO YOU SEE IN YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS MESSAGE, YOU'RE NOT AGREEING WITH THE SEVENTH ANGEL. YOU'RE NOT AGREEING WITH JUST THAT MAN, WILLIAM BRANDHAM. YOU'RE AGREEING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BIBLE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY MY TAPES BACK. THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY THESE RECORDINGS BACK OVER THERE, MAYBE IN HEAVEN, AND I'LL GET TO HEAR MY OWN VOICE SAY IT JUST LIKE BROTHER RANDOM SAID IT. SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, BROTHER WAYNE, you aren't say it LIKE HE SAID IT." AMEN. THAT'S OKAY right here. And you know, you didn't get in all these little groups and everybody got this opinion. This family GOT THIS OPINION. SOMEBODY ELSE GOT THIS OPINION. I'M NOT looking right here, folks. I'm not looking down right here. I'm thinking about another day. I'M THINKING ABOUT A day when I stand BEFORE THE LORD AND I COULD HEAR HIM SAY, "THOU HAS DONE WELL, MY GOOD AND MY FAITHFUL SERVANT." &gt;&gt; FAITHFUL TO WHAT? FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE, TO THE MESSAGE HE GAVE ME. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T HELP WHAT he gave the other ages. &gt;&gt; He gave me this one. &gt;&gt; And I know and and I hate it. I I do hate that the message causes separation. I hate it. And some people, bless their hearts, they're so loyal to a church, but they're not faithful to this message at all. &gt;&gt; They're so loyal to a church. They let a pastor, a preacher say anything he wants to, and they'll just dismiss it as as some little something. Listen, I'm sorry, not me. &gt;&gt; We come too far. WE'RE TOO FAR GONE. IF WE START DOING THAT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK IN OUR past and and we're going to HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERY PREACHER AND EVERY SITUATION we walked away from to stay WITH THIS MESSAGE. LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO, BUT AS far as me AND MY HOUSE, WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE, FOLKS. WE DIDN'T COME HERE JUST FOR ONE SERVICE. WE'RE GOING BACK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING. IT'S THE WORD OF HIS OWN POWER. &gt;&gt; That angel was not the son of man. He was only a messenger &gt;&gt; from the son of man. That son of man is Christ. &gt;&gt; Now I clarified my eighth angel spot, didn't I? That that that messenger is Christ. The son of man is Christ. Revelations 10 is Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one that you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man. His words are going to fail you &gt;&gt; feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. Do you see that? His words will fail you. Then you get these folks get so locked up in this every word brother Bam says thus sayaith the Lord. So when a when a preacher comes along and tries to preach the revelation and stay with the message then folks are thinking well he's trying to say every word brother Bram said. No that's the straw man you created. &gt;&gt; That's the devil's straw man. That's not Wayne Lawson. Come on. &gt;&gt; Pick that spirit up, didn't I? &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S THE DEVIL'S STRAW, MAN. THAT'S NOT ME. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people get they they get other preachers in their mind and they try to to label me with that. &gt;&gt; Keep your labels. &gt;&gt; I'm a message preacher. &gt;&gt; I didn't know nothing when God brought me in this message. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS IN THE NEW OR THE OLD. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH THE BIBLE. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH LIFE. I HAD LIVED 22 YEARS AND WAS A WRECK. BUT GOD, RICH IN HIS MERCY, OPENED MY HEART TO THIS WORD AND IT'S UPHELD ME AND IT TOOK ME FROM MY SALVATION AND BROUGHT ME TO WHERE I AM TODAY. DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM'S MISTAKES. I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD THAT'S BROUGHT ME THIS FAR. HE KEPT ME. HE'S CARRYING ME. HE'S GOING TO KEEP CARRYING ME. &gt;&gt; WELL, I FEEL LIKE TAKING A SHOUTING SPELL. AMEN. HE'S THE GOD OF MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND THIS MESSAGE came from him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I love it when I'm listening to the prophet cuz I know I know who he is and I know who he's speaking for. &gt;&gt; He said, "When you hear my voice speaking, when that inspiration is on, I have no more control of that than nothing. I do not have control of that. It speaks itself. &gt;&gt; It's my voice and I'm listening to myself talk just as you're listening to me talk. Me and Brother Brandham was listening to the voice that was coming out of him. And we were both holling amen. &gt;&gt; CUZ HE WAS SAYING THINGS HE DIDN'T KNOW. HE WAS SAYING THINGS HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. BUT HE WAS A CHANNEL. HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD. THAT WAS THROUGH THIS GENERATION. YES. &gt;&gt; I stake my life ON IT. I STAKE MY SOUL ON IT. &gt;&gt; THERE AIN'T NOTHING ELSE TO FOLLOW in this generation. &gt;&gt; He signs. Brother ma'am said, "See, [laughter] it's not for you to follow me. It's are you TO FOLLOW THE LORD JESUS? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will lead you." Now, Brother Bam's got some beautiful statements. You heard me telling something, didn't you? He said, 'Well, that was my voice, but I was not operating it. Amen. Jesus authority on the word. Brother man says it like this. You believe this is him speaking, not me, &gt;&gt; but he's speaking through here. &gt;&gt; Then if that be his voice speaking through me, his presence is here. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham described himself like a microphone. &gt;&gt; And if I don't speak, this microphone don't say nothing. And it's got no words of its own. It's got no vocabulary of its own. It's only magnifying what I put in it. &gt;&gt; And brother Brown was telling you, I'm a mute, folks. &gt;&gt; What you're hearing, &gt;&gt; I'm hearing with you. &gt;&gt; And some people, they think brother Brown was way off because, you know, he said the White Horse Rider in 1960, it was the was the Christ. Then he comes in the seals and says &gt;&gt; it's the Antichrist. And for some reason that discourages people. &gt;&gt; Well, it was a great encouragement to me &gt;&gt; cuz here I am believing that dispensations are changing. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "These things which I'm about to reveal has been hidden &gt;&gt; and no man knows what they ARE." WELL, IF BROTHER BRANDON WOULD HAVE KNEW, HOW hidden would they have been? &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE REALLY HIDDEN &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD SAID, "SEAL IT UP." BUT IN THE END TIME, HE SAID, "THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, THESE THINGS WILL BE MADE KNOWN, AND THE WORD OF HIS POWER WILL BE SPOKEN OUT." &gt;&gt; My goodness, it might have been my voice, but it wasn't me speaking. &gt;&gt; Now, you if you if you look into this, you you you can look at brother Brandham. The hour has come. It's some beautiful beautiful things. You're you you know, can you imagine now? You're standing before the prophet. You're conscious that something is here, isn't you? You're conscious. It's the spirit of the Lord. You believe me? Yes, ma'am. I'm coming back again now. Oh, yes. You have something. It's It's your stomach and you have stomach trouble. I see the foods and stuff that you can't digest, right? Isn't that right? It's something like, see, that caused you to have a spasm in the stomach, a regurgitation, a sour, and your teeth become sensitive cuz you have persistent headaches and things. Isn't that right? Yes, true, sister. Now, that wasn't me talking. &gt;&gt; That was something else talking. &gt;&gt; Then he identifies it was the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, let let let's just say, Brother Brandon said, "Do you believe me to be a prophet? Do you believe me to be a prophet?" Now, what watch when he says in a greater witness than in John, I I'll not read the whole thing. I'll go down here. There's a woman is also suffering. I see her changing garments and she's suffering with something in her leg. It's a varicose vein. She's rubbing with cramps in her legs. Those things are true, aren't they? If they are, raise up your hand. Do you believe? Now, I do not know what I said to the woman. That wasn't me talking. That was the angel you see on that picture. Just bring that picture up. &gt;&gt; That's the angel you see on that picture. A lot of people's really scared of that word paracia because people used to pronounce it per ruia. And you know, I guess if you pronounce it peruia, then you preach it like peruia. But if you pronounce it paracia, you preach it like the Bible. [laughter] &gt;&gt; They said it wrong and preached it wrong. &gt;&gt; We're going to say it right and preach it right. &gt;&gt; The word paracia is strictly a Greek word in the Bible. It means revealing or coming. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You know what the real meaning is? One alongside of. &gt;&gt; There's one alongside of. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S TWO of them. &gt;&gt; NOW, JOSHUA AND MOSES, YOU SAW IT. JOHN AND JESUS, YOU SAW IT. BUT HERE, IT'S A SUPERNATURAL BEING. &gt;&gt; And brother BAM SAID, "WHEN YOU HEARD ME SPEAKING, IT WASN'T ME. It was that angel of the Lord speaking." &gt;&gt; Now, that pillar of fire is the one Paul's talking about here in the Hebrews. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he takes it to creation, takes it to Moses, and then takes it in his meeting with him. And he Paul Paul asked this light what its name was. &gt;&gt; Got it in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Lord, who are you? So he told us it was Jehovah. He knew that, &gt;&gt; but he didn't know the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he said, I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; That light is the angel of the covenant. See, now watch Brother Brandham. He'll go over. He'll go over it and he'll say it here like this in living uh in the living Christ. Now, if you be reverent, how do you do, sister? Believe with all your heart. The son of God is risen from the dead. He's revealing in this line of divine healing, the mercies of his resurrection. Do you believe him with all your heart? Something very strange about you, lady. You look like somebody I know or something. Your features are disturbing me a little. I want to watch this. And as Elijah said, "Look, if it wasn't that I respected the presence of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at you." And Peter and John said, "Look on us." In other words, not to look to them as healers, but look on us. We've got something to say to you. &gt;&gt; Why are we looking that way? &gt;&gt; Because he had something to say to us. &gt;&gt; This woman is looking at a prophet. HE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER. And look what he says. You've just been operated on. &gt;&gt; You've had an operation. And that tumor operation, they removed a tumor and that was on the bladder. And do something. They put some kind of treatment in you to see if something else was wrong. And that treatment was in a thing that dissolved and went out and they now think it's a malignancy. Your niece, I see, standing there. I haven't seen her in the meeting, but I know see I see her standing by your side smiling and these things are so whatsoever I told you it's the absolute truth. Now that wasn't me talking to you lady. That was my VOICE BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE TALKING. Do you believe it was the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it was the Lord JESUS CHRIST? NOW THIS PICTURE SHOWS YOU TWO BEINGS. It shows you a human being. Shows you a supernatural being. But it was brother Ram WAS TELLING YOU THAT pillar of fire is using my voice to speak to you. &gt;&gt; It's pretty powerful, folks. In 1953, watch Brother Bam says it like this. Everyone believe now with all your heart. Do you believe? We're strangers. We're perfect strangers. I don't know you, but if if there would be anything in your life and us strangers, it'd have to come from a supernatural resource. Isn't that right? You're aware that you're standing near something. Now watch it. She knew she was standing next to brother Brandt. &gt;&gt; He says, "But you're aware you're standing near something more than your brother." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's his presence. &gt;&gt; Did you ever see that picture they took of him? You've seen it. Well, that's what you're aware of. That's so close. Now, &gt;&gt; do you believe me to be his prophet? You're very upset, aren't you? Your doctor recently gave you an X-ray picture and you're afraid of cancer, aren't you? See, but it's down in your bowels. See, it's a tumor. They said a tumor. You was afraid it was cancerous, but it is in the boughels. Isn't that right? It's the truth. That's the truth. Raise your hand. You know, lady, I never seen you in my life. That wasn't me talking. You might have heard my voice. THAT WAS HIM TALKING. WELL, THEN IF HE'S THAT CLOSE TO YOU NOW, won't you accept him? &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT HE DONE. HE SHOWED YOU YOU'RE FEELING SOMETHING THAT AIN'T your brother and you're hearing something that ain't your brother. You're in HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; SO, GO AHEAD AND ACCEPT HIM WHILE YOU'RE IN HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; OH, I'LL TELL you this. I'M GLAD THAT GOD GAVE US THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE IS NOT SOMETHING that's coming just from a man. It's coming from the one that created the heavens and the earth. COME ON NOW. AND HE'S COMING TO THIS AGE FOR ANOTHER CREATION, FOR THE CREATION OF HIS BRIDE. AND HE HAS A WORD. He has a word that is different than what brother Brandham thought. He has a word that was different than some of the Baptists thought. He has a word. He has a message. Now, in the rising of the sun, you can take that down. In the rising of the sun, what's the prophet say it here? HE SAYS, "AS CHRIST WAS THE FIRST ONE TO raise from all of the prophets that slept in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept. And in the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now you got to watch how you put those uh commas and all that the punctuation because it really means the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride coming of Christ coming out of the church. There will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. Now waving of that sheath. What was that sheath? The first one to come to mature. The first one to proved it was a wheat. Now I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. It was waved over the people. Now, what was William Brandham waving over those people by saying, "It's not my voice. &gt;&gt; That's not me." That's that angel of the Lord. That's that pillar of the fire. What was he waving over those people? He was waving to them. The son of man has come to fulfill his word in this generation. NOW, WATCH THIS. HALLELUJAH. I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. For the first time, there will come forth for the bride age, a resurrection out of dark denominationalism. IT'LL BE A MESSAGE THAT THE FULL MATURITY of the word has turned back into full power. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHAT THE BRIDE'S GOING TO HAVE A MESSAGE AND THIS MESSAGE WILL BE? THE WORD HAS RETURNED TO ITS FULL POWER. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT this morning, then it it's a beautiful thing to THINK BECAUSE NOW WHAT you're what you're hearing is it's not the power of the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look, I've heard some powerful sermons by people don't even preach truth. &gt;&gt; They say powerful words. &gt;&gt; You you've heard you've heard atheists say powerful words. &gt;&gt; You you I mean, when I was in the world, country music stars could sing powerful words. They could move you emotionally. had nothing to do with God. &gt;&gt; Powerful words. &gt;&gt; But there's a different in the word of his power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM HIM. YOU SEE, THEN IF YOU CAN PICK UP THE SAME WORD he brought to you NOW. IT'S NOT ME SAYING IT. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S NOT ME. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT YOU GOING AROUND AND SAYING, "WELL, THE SCRIPTURE means this and the SCRIPTURE MEANS THIS." YOU'RE NOW USING the word of his power. DO YOU SEE A PROPHET HAS BROUGHT A MESSAGE to the believer? And in agreement with that message, we're standing here this morning WITH THE WORD OF THAT power coming through the church. WHAT POWER? THE SAME POWER. &gt;&gt; THE POWER that created the heavens and earth have come right here into this age into the men and women that's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And you're sitting right here this morning. You say, "Brother Wayne, I crave the power of God." How many craves the power of God? &gt;&gt; I crave the power of God. Brother Brandham said, "If you are CRAVING THE POWER OF GOD, THEN THERE IS A POWER OF GOD SOMEWHERE TO MEET IT." &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE THERE'S GOT TO BE A POWER. AS LONG AS THE HUMAN BEINGS are searching and hungering AND CALLING FOR THE POWER OF GOD, THERE'S GOT TO BE A POWER SOMEWHERE TO RESPOND TO IT. IF WE'RE HUNGRY FOR IT, IF WE'RE CALLING FOR IT, IF WE'RE ASKING FOR IT, GOD IS HERE THIS MORNING TO RESPOND TO THAT to give you the power, amen, that has been released in this word. This message is the most powerful force that's ever been put on the earth. &gt;&gt; Listen, you you we we talk about Pentecost. We say, "WELL, THIS HAPPENED on the day of Pentecost, and there was there was 120 in the upper room, and hey, listen, that that's wonderful, brother." Amen. And then 3,000 were saved right after that. Oh, that's a beautiful story. BUT WHAT ABOUT DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA? &gt;&gt; AND IF THE PENTECOSTALS WASN'T SO UH IF THEY WASN'T SO BEAT DOWN BY THE DENOMINATIONS, MOST OF THOSE PENTECOSTAL BROTHERS WOULD START EVERY SERVICE BY TELLING YOU THAT 30,000 PEOPLE GAVE THEIR LIFE TO JESUS in one altar CALL IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA. 10 times the POWER OF PENTECOST HAS VISITED THIS GENERATION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK BACK TO ACTS 2 TO FIND THE POWER OF GOD. THE POWER OF GOD HAS COME UNTO US. IT HAS COME UNTO US BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT going to WATER IT DOWN. I'M NOT GOING TO WATER THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO JUST A LITTLE TEACHING OR JUST A LITTLE IDEA. IT IS THE POWER OF GOD UNDER SALVATION. IT IS THE POWER OF CHANGE. IT IS THE POWER OF ADOPTION. IT IS THE POWER OF LIFE. IT'LL DO SOMETHING for you there ain't nothing else going to do for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the power of the devil could take a hold of a man and make him 10 times more powerful, what would happen if you surrender to God? &gt;&gt; I need a witness. &gt;&gt; I need a witness of the power of God this MORNING. I NEED A WITNESS THIS MORNING. SOMEBODY THAT COULD SAY, "BROTHER WAYNE, I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE power of God." &gt;&gt; If you're hungering for the power of God, I want you to look around this room. I I'M HUNGRY FOR THE POWER OF GOD. I'VE EXPERIENCED THE POWER OF GOD. LISTEN, I KNOW some of you sitting here, we're getting ready to go to camp and I know your heart is overflowing right now cuz some of you never even knew about the power of God until you visited that little camp meeting over there. Amen. I I was talking to somebody the other day and they told me said, "Brother Wayne, I come down there and I didn't know what to expect, but I had to go through that prayer line cuz I seen all them people getting under that anointing." He said, "I walked in and they carried me out." Amen. He said, "I don't know what happened, but I ain't never been the same." Amen. CUZ IT WAS THE power of God. COME ON. THERE'S SOME OF YOU RECEIVE THINGS, AMEN, THAT YOU CAN NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. BROTHER KYLE, IS IT TRUE? IS IT TRUE THE POWER OF GOD IN COMING INTO A CHRISTIAN'S LIFE, SOMEBODY THAT'S ALREADY BORN AGAIN? BUT THE POWER OF [screaming] GOD IS MORE THAN JUST BEING BORN AGAIN. IT IS THE ADOPTION OF THE CHURCH TO TAKE YOU BACK TO EVERYTHING THAT YOU LOST. AUTHORITY. SPOKEN WORD AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, there's a Goliath in the land. I know. I know there's a Goliath in the land that we live in today. &gt;&gt; Well, if God still heals, then you know, heal somebody. &gt;&gt; That's the same exact voice. &gt;&gt; And on the day of judgment, God's going to hear that voice agreeing with the voice of them Pharisees that said, "Jesus, &gt;&gt; if you can't even save yourself, come off the cross. Let me see you do a miracle. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That's the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me let me see you do a miracle. &gt;&gt; Oh, if that third pull's for the bride, let me see you create a squirrel. God didn't commit all of us to create squirrels. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T CREATE US ALL. BROTHER SAID SOME OF YOU ARE MOSES. HE SAID MOSES WAS DONE the miracle AND THERE WAS BELIEVERS TO follow the MIRACLE &gt;&gt; AND NOT EVERYBODY'S A MOSES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IF GOD COMMITTED YOU JUST TO FOLLOW THE MESSAGE? COME ON, CHURCH. WHAT GOOD IS THE THIRD PULL IF THERE'S NO FOLLOWERS? &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THE THIRD PULL COME TO CREATE FOLLOWERS. PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED THE PILLAR OF FIRE. THAT'S IN THE BOOK OF MATTHEW, THE MAGI THAT FOLLOWED THE STAR. COME ON, CHURCH. WHY WAS THEY IN THE BIBLE? BROTHER BRAM SAID to have a type of people who followed a supernatural light. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said, "AND WHEN JEHOVAH GOD, THAT GREAT ANGEL COME OUT of the heavens and and created a star, they followed it. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, now we got this Goliath and and you know it's easy when when when troubles are up and things are happening. That's when Goliath really comes out. That's when brother Ram said when the odds are against you when when when the chips are down. &gt;&gt; When you've been sick a couple years, you know, you ain't never getting over this. &gt;&gt; There's your Goliath. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got cancer and they just keep suffering and suffering. So, well, see there, God don't heal cancer no more. Oh, here's your one. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I knew a guy claimed his healing and he died. &gt;&gt; Well, I know a bunch of people that took chemo and died. &gt;&gt; Now, there's been a lot more die under medical care &gt;&gt; and you still going to the doctor. &gt;&gt; I'm [clears throat] not against the doctor. Just don't be against divine healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, brother Bam said it like this. He said, "And when you allow the channel of memory to be your access, you'll never get your healing in that channel." &gt;&gt; He said, "Because in the channel of memory, you know, somebody claimed their healing and didn't get it." He said, "So, you got to go over that memory to get to your healing." He said, "But if you'll bypass all those channels, and you'll go straight to the word of God, it's the word of power. It's the word OF HEALING. IT'S HOW YOU GET YOUR HEALING. IT'S HOW YOU OVERCOME YOUR GOLIATH. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it. I love how Brother Bram says things. He said, "I'm a witness of the power of God." You see, oh David run up there. It's come out of the message witness 53. He said, "You see old David run up there and they got this Goliath and David runs up in the middle of him says, "I'm a witness of the power of God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Little shrutddy kid &gt;&gt; ain't even got his ain't even got his license to carry spear. No CCW, nothing. He He can't can't carry a gun. &gt;&gt; And he walks up in the middle of the crowd &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm a witness of the power of God. &gt;&gt; WHO WHO IS THIS UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE?" AMEN. That that that's out here bragging like this. &gt;&gt; Well, I TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS JUST A KID, there's a bear come in. I killed it. &gt;&gt; I'M A WITNESS &gt;&gt; THAT A LION COME in to get one of father's sheep AND AND AND AND I SLAYED THAT LION. I'M A WITNESS. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU THIS, IF HE'LL KILL A BEAR and a lion over a LITTLE SHEEP, WHAT'S GOD GOING TO DO TO THIS GOLIATH over his children? &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHEN DAVID TOLD HIM, "I'M NOT JUST A WITNESS, BUT I'M ABOUT TO MAKE YOU A WITNESS. &gt;&gt; I'M ABOUT TO LET YOU SEE." AMEN. THAT IF YOU'LL JUST LET GOD BE GOD, HE'S STILL GOD. &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER WHEN I first got saved, Brother Levi, I wanted to believe that God still did miracles. And I still wanted to believe that God healed. I want to believe God was everything that he'd ever been. And there was all kinds of people had all kinds of things to say. But one day I found out that the Jesus that did it in the Bible, Amen. He didn't stay in the tomb. But on the third day, he rose. Amen. And he's right HERE THIS MORNING. AND HE'S JUST AS MUCH GOD THIS MORNING AS HE WAS BACK THERE IN THE BIBLE. AND WHEN HIS WORD COMES TO YOU, IT IS THE POWER OF GOD THAT IS COMING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I tell you what he done. He whipped that Goliath. And you've whipped yours, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can whip that Goliath of your life this morning. Do you know that them people, let me encourage you, you can whip that Goliath that says you've been in it too long to get out of it. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, HE'S HERE THIS MORNING TO BRING you out of it. HE'S CALLING YOU BY NAME. THE WORD OF POWER MAY NOT MEAN nothing to the rest OF THIS GENERATION, BUT IT'LL MEAN SOMETHING to you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to stay under that. God comes to call. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says it like that. He said he come he said see in this days when they say the days of miracles is passed when they say this old time religion he says he says won't take anymore that was something for your grandpa and your grandma brother I'm glad tonight that there's some witnesses of that oldfashioned Holy Ghost guy killing sin killing religion that kills out nature and adamic powers of the devil and your heart can be plain. Oh what a witness. Aren't you glad right now? I want you to witness these young people THAT THE HOLY GHOST DIDN'T STOP BACK THERE. IS STILL LIVE this morning. AMEN. AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST THAT DONE WHAT HE DID FOR ME IS RIGHT HERE TODAY AND IT'S GOING TO CARRY YOU RIGHT THROUGH YOUR CAMP MEETING, young people. &gt;&gt; Don't you let nobody put no limits on God. &gt;&gt; Oh, but they're going to say, I'm I'm continue to quote, but they're going to say, "Well, them people are just too noisy." AMEN. BROTHER M SAID, "BUT THEY GOT SOMETHING TO BE NOISY ABOUT." THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I PROVE TO YOU THAT BIBLE religion is a noisy religion. &gt;&gt; Job, where were you when the foundations were planted and THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY? THE RELIGION OF A TRUE CHRISTIAN IS A NOISY RELIGION. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER, IF YOU THINK THIS IS NOISY, YOU WAIT TILL I GET OVER THERE AND I GET THIS NEW BODY, BROTHER. AMEN. YOU THINK ABOUT NOISY HERE. YOU THINK I'M SHOUTING HERE. YOU WAIT TILL I GET A NEW BODY AND I [cheering] AIN'T GOT NO MORE PAIN. AND I AIN'T GOT NO MORE TROUBLE. AND THERE'S NO MORE WEARY, BROTHER, IN [cheering] MY GLORIFIED BODY. I WON'T GET [applause] TIRED. I WON'T GET WEARY. I WON'T GET TROUBLED. I feel like THAT THIS MORNING. I THANK GOD FOR this word. &gt;&gt; OH, THEY'RE TOO NOISY. OH, BROTHER BRANDHAM. AMEN. BROTHER BRANDON, they're too noisy. He said, "It's not them shouting. IT'S THE POWER OF God moving through them. WOO. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ME SHOUTING. IT'S THE POWER OF GOD MOVING THROUGH YOU. THE POWER THAT SAVED YOU IS THE POWER MOVING THROUGH YOU WHEN YOU SAY HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? IT'S COMING FROM another world. And when IT SWEEPS DOWN IN THE CHURCH, OH, I say, let that chariot sweep through the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Just as I was getting in the car this morning. Amen. in a scripture I ain't heard in years. It come right up in my ear. He said, "I withholdeth no good thing from them that are good or right from the upright. I holdeth no good thing. I withhold no good thing." I thought, "Lord, what does that mean?" Amen. DO YOU KNOW THIS GOSPEL IS good news? Do you know it's THE GOOD NEWS YOU'RE SAVED? DO YOU KNOW IT'S THE GOOD NEWS YOU'RE FILLED? IT'S THE GOOD NEWS HE'S ALIVE. IT'S THE GOOD NEWS HE WALKS AMONG YOU. AMEN. DON'T WITHHOLD THE GOOD THINGS. COME ON. WE DON'T WANT TO GET SO INTELLECTUAL THAT WE WITHHOLD THE GOOD THINGS FROM GOD'S CHILDREN. GIVE THEM THE GOOD THINGS, THE POWER OF GOD, AND THE REALITIES OF GOD. I certainly believe this morning. I believe it. I believe people get so messed up in their traditions until they withhold the things of God. They withhold the moving OF THE HOLY GHOST. THEY withhold the shouting and rejoicing and the dancing in the spirit. Well, listen. AMEN. YOU MIGHT BE OLD. AMEN. AND YOU MIGHT BE TIRED. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A GENERATION, AMEN, THAT'S READY TO WORSHIP GOD. THEY WANT TO SERVE GOD. I'M 52 AND I ain't old and tired. I tell you what I WANT IS AN OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST FILILLED REVIVAL THAT'LL CHANGE HEARTS, CHANGE LIVES. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm in the message. I'm in THE MESSAGE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "AMEN. What is it?" HE SAID, "THEY HAVE A form of religion, but they deny the power thereof. It's the resurrection of JESUS CHRIST THAT PRESENTS HIM TO YOU TONIGHT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE power of God to change a man. That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POWER OF GOD TO CHANGE A LIFE. LISTEN, SOME OF YOU MAYBE got the Holy Ghost and you said, "Well, we're just cruising now." Amen. But you know, you got habits that you need to get rid of. Do you know the word of his power will change that? DO YOU KNOW GETTING in a good meeting somewhere WILL CHANGE THAT? YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME MARRIAGE SITUATIONS IN THIS BUILDING right now that if you would GET IN A GOOD OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST MEETING AND GET A REFILLING OF THE HOLY GHOST, IT WOULD CHANGE YOUR MARRIAGE. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR CHURCH. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR FAMILY. IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING BECAUSE THE POWER OF GOD IS WHAT WILL CHANGE IT. &gt;&gt; AH, it'll make a sunny day in the middle of your clouds. &gt;&gt; Don't withhold a good thing. Ain't you glad? Ain't you glad Malachi didn't quit writing when he said, "Unto them that fear my name." Ain't you glad he didn't stop right there? Ain't you glad he went on to say, "Don't withhold it, Malachi. Don't withhold the good thing unto them that fear my name." Keep writing, brother. He said, "The son of righteousness shall arise with healings IN HIS WINGS. BEHOLD, I SEND UNTO YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD. MY GOD DID NOT WITHHOLD THE GOOD THINGS." He spoke the word of his power. &gt;&gt; And that word coming to the church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Lord said, "Preacher, what in the world?" The word of his power is where you get a new beginning this morning. &gt;&gt; How many like start over? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; How many like a like a new start? &gt;&gt; Would you a new start? And &gt;&gt; don't get hung up on my old and tired statement. That's some young people, too. So, you ever heard they're old in their spirit, you know, &gt;&gt; they stay home, don't get out, don't go nowhere, don't have no friends, don't nothing. You know, &gt;&gt; they're tired. They're old and tired. Even young people. But wouldn't it be something if the Holy Spirit that wrote this Bible that created the heavens and earth come in this building right now &gt;&gt; and start you over. &gt;&gt; Preacher, what are you really discussing? I'm discussing the things that people have said to you and about you. &gt;&gt; I'm discussing the things that you carry in your spirit daily &gt;&gt; because of some little criticism. Somebody made fun of the way you dressed or they made fun of you because you quoted brother Brandham or you was one of them faith people. &gt;&gt; You know, you went down there, you go over, oh, you go you you go over there where they shout and holler and stuff, you know. Oh, you go over there with the believe the prophet. And you see, every word of criticism that you take into you is just like latching you spiritually and just just comes to bind your spirit to hold you. Listen, I don't care what anybody says. I got a place to dump it off. &gt;&gt; I got a place to just come along and say, "Look, look, devil. I've heard all of you I want to hear. &gt;&gt; I've heard all of you I want to hear." He'll send somebody. Well, I tell you what, y'all keep that shouting up. Y'all just going to turn into a bunch of fanatics. Well, fanatic to who? &gt;&gt; Fanatic to who? It's kind of like somebody said, "Well, we believe." Brother B said, "Who's we?" &gt;&gt; You and who? &gt;&gt; Not you in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I tell y'all, y'all just fanatic. I'll tell you what I preached. I preached in Africa, Nathan. And about the third time that lady run up the middle of the aisle shouting and hollering, blowing the whistles like we at the soccer game, I said, "Well, we laidback people back this day. [laughter] Man, I was praying for myself and her cuz I was hoping she'd choke on it one time and I was like [laughter] I say that we would have prayed for HER [laughter] fanatical to who? &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH TO WHO? &gt;&gt; Not to the person THAT'S UNDER THE FOUNTAIN. NOT TO THAT PERSON THAT'S BEEN FIGHTING DEVILS FOR A WHOLE YEAR AND THE ANOINTING GETS ON THEM AND THEY FEEL LIGHT ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; THEY FEEL ENOUGH LIKE DANC. AMEN. IT'S NOT FANATICAL TO THAT GUY. IT'S NOT FANATICAL TO THAT [cheering] GIRL THAT'S BEEN UNDER THAT ANXIETY AND NERVOUSNESS AND SHE PRAYS UNTIL TONGUES START COMING OUT AND SHE STARTS LIFTING HER [cheering] HANDS AND SHE STARTS SPEAKING IN OTHER TONGUES TO HER. OH, IT'S NOT TOO FANATICAL. IT'S THE BEST DAY OF OUR LIFE. [cheering] LET ME TELL YOU, I BELIEVE IN A FANATICAL RELIGION THAT SAVES HEARTS, THAT CHANGES LIVES, THAT GIVES HEALING AND POWER TO THE BELIEVER. YOU [cheering] BRING ME A FANATIC IF YOU WANT TO, BROTHER. THIS FANATIC IS GOING TO GO TO HEAVEN ONE MORNING. I'M GOING TO BREAK FROM ONE DIMENSION TO ANOTHER. AND WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN, AMEN. It'll be fanatical there for sure. &gt;&gt; You're all standing. Stand with me. It'll be fanatical for sure. &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come. It'll be fanatical, folks. &gt;&gt; At least to somebody. &gt;&gt; It struck me one day. I was preaching a certain part of the message. Seemed like nobody wanted to preach and I was preaching right along. Had some guys start, well, Brother Wayne's wrong on this. Brother Wayne's wrong on this. So, I went back to the message and I listened to Brother Ram real careful. And I took what he said and said it just like he said it. And they said, "You're wrong on that." And then I realized I can't preach what Brother Ram said and be right by them. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to have to quit wearing what they think &gt;&gt; and say what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you see what you got to come to? &gt;&gt; The word of his power. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you come under that word, you're agreeing not with William Brandom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're agreeing with the one that was talking through him. &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe there's a I believe there's another being behind this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've announced it many times to you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is not here this morning, &gt;&gt; but the one that used him the Almighty, &gt;&gt; the one that spoke through him. &gt;&gt; The counselor, &gt;&gt; the prince of peace, &gt;&gt; the mighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How far will he be from me, brother Matt? How far will he be? Arm reach or will it be up in the heavens or? He said, "I'll be above you." &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I'll be with you." &gt;&gt; Oh, but there's coming a time &gt;&gt; that I'll be with you even Amen. &gt;&gt; How far is the power from you right now? Then &gt;&gt; how far is the power from you right now? How much the power the power of God? How far is it from you? &gt;&gt; I'm going to use the Bible on you. &gt;&gt; My Bible said he was asleep in the ship. &gt;&gt; And Brother Brham said it just like this. He said, "And you're a mud ship, &gt;&gt; and he's asleep in you right now, &gt;&gt; and the one that saved you is resting there." &gt;&gt; And he said, "The one that heals the sick is resting there." &gt;&gt; He said, "But if you just wake him up, &gt;&gt; he could speak the word of his power &gt;&gt; and your storms would settle right now, &gt;&gt; things would change." Listen, he's he's an ontime God, folks. &gt;&gt; He's an ontime God. He's &gt;&gt; He's come. Y'all y'all forgive me for my length this morning. There's something on my heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to I I I know I preached four in a row lately, and y'all forgive me for that. I I don't want to seem like a hog, but there's something on my heart. I tell you what I'm doing. I want to get my words in with the words of a prophet. And I want to get your words. I want to get your conscience. I want to get your belief systems. I want to get what you think. I want to get it in line with that prophet &gt;&gt; because it's more than William Brandom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't, brother Adam, don't you want when you get there if if perhaps they pull a tape of your life out and they they play your speech when they push it, don't don't you want to hear the voice on that tape before the whole saints of God? Don't you want to hear it say what you heard brother Brim say? And then you're standing there because that's already been accepted. &gt;&gt; What an opportunity to love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What an opportunity to serve him.
