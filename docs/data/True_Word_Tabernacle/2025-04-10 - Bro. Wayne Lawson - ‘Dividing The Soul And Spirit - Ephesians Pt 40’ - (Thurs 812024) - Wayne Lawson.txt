line Saturday night but to be honest with you uh I felt like 90% of the work was done before the prayer line ever started amen the Holy Spirit just moved in the church and uh there was Deliverance and hearts that were delivered all over the congregation long time before the prayer line even began the Holy Spirit had had done most of his work and we certainly are thankful for that tonight and amen

home we certainly glad to see him get some vacation time uh in Ephesians the 6th chapter and I want to read tonight from the word of the Lord Ephesians chapter 6 and we want to read the 17th verse here and we'll be also reading a few uh Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 Paul said and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and let's turn to book of Hebrews chapter 4 I want to read from the 12th ver verse here very very powerful scripture Hebrews 4 and verse 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of the soul and the spirit and the joints and the moral and is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart God bless you as you could be seated tonight I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening I'd like to talk to you about dividing of the soul and the spirit dividing of the soul and the spirit greatest battle ever fought brother brandham tells us a beautiful uh thing when he tells us a human being is made up like a grain of wheat it's a seed a human being is a seed physically you're a seed of your father and mother and life came from the father and the pulp came from the mother and the two together the egg and blood comes together and the blood cell is life and there it begins and develops making the child now any seed has a shell on the outside and the inside is the pulp and then inside of the pulp is the germ of life well that's the way we're made we are Body Soul and Spirit that's the way we are made Body Soul and Spirit now when you uh I I was just thinking on this while I was gone I was just kind of fellowshipping with the Lord on it and I was looking at situations and as we uh of course looking always for the Holy Spirit to give direction on healing and manifestations of his word and his truth and I was just considering some subjects here out of this uh out of this series on greatest battle and it come into my heart I got to thinking of how uh that when we look at people we we almost want to just see one person uh like if you look at someone you think that you're just looking at one person when that's really not true when you maybe when you go to the doctor the Medical Science now I'm not talking about Christian doctors of course they have better knowledge than this but if you go to a medical doctor and they're trying to treat a patient they're always just treating one person that's why sometimes medical science cannot reach into the place that is exactly needed because they're trying to just fix one person but when the scripture details that there is more than one person now there's just one body but there's more than one person brother brandom uh of course is telling us this I we'll take it Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 and44 Paul will say that it is sown a natural body and is raised a spiritual body and there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body so it is written the first Adam was made a living soul and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit now how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterwards which is spiritual now the first man is of the earth Earthly the second man is the Lord From Heaven and is Earthly such as they are also that are Earthly and is in the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and we have been born of the image of the Earthly so also shall we bear the image of the Heavenly so he's evenly dividing that there is a body body that is a natural body and then there is a spiritual body I'll give you another one in second Corinthians 5 and verse one for we know that if there Earthly House of this Tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of God not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for We Grown uh this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven now Paul calls this human body he calls it a tabernacle I love how in other places he calls it this body of humiliation brother Bram calls it a pest house and so we know the human body on the outside is still subject to the elements of the world that we live in uh becoming sick and and a aging process and the the Mortal being that we're living in amen but in 1 Corinthians 15 and 40 Paul will say this he said that there are bodies celestial bodies and there are bodies terrestrial so there is bodies that are terrestrial there are bodies that are cel Ral so the terrestrial body would be a pest house it would be a human body it would be the veil that we live in it would be a human body now most people trying to deal with people they're only trying to deal with that one man but you cannot deal with sin or sickness only by dealing with one man that's right brother Bram says in the experiences he said there are two people he said now there are two people in one see amen there are two people in one there are two men enticing Spirits if you'd like to see it in the scripture you remember in the Bible when Jehoshaphat and Ahab was up at the Battle of ramoth Gilead y'all remember how that uh Ahab was representing the the natural man the backsliding king and then here come Jehoshaphat and when he got up there they had 400 prophets prophesying to them go down into the battle so there are two men I I would like to say that represents the two men in you you can see a Jehoshaphat and you can see an a Ahab now when they were trying to get aligned for the battle that they were about to enter into Jehosaphat was hearing ahab's prophecies that was coming and the prophet of God said but but there Jehoshaphat said isn't there one more voice and he said that question was coming to him amen because he wasn't satisfied with what he was hearing something in him told him something was wrong with what he was hearing now that's where brother bam many times in questions and answers on some of them real particular question questions brother bandam will say I really don't have scripture to answer it he said but if there is a question then don't do it remember that because he said the question is coming from the soul realm in other words there is something on the inside of you that's not satisfied with the answer that you're getting so you got two different men there the outward man the outward man of course is happy with an intellectual gospel or denominational idea or you know something to dismiss or substitute the things of God but now that inner man is not satisfied with that amen I I'll say that he represents him that said isn't there one more amen and and of course then amen the outward man said yeah there's one more but he hates us he's always prophesying against us he's always correcting our errors and he's always dealing with our flesh but but there was an inner man amen that wanted to hear what the word of God had to say about it and I certainly believe tonight that's the truth that there's an inner man see man was not made to lie see amen so that way there is a conscience and there's a subconscious but man's not made to lie so you can you you can see there's something that unnerves him now amen so that's telling us that we can never give the Inner Man a substitute amen by the outer man so brother bam says it many times how that they now people because they're supposed to be a new birth he said they try to substitute the new birth with something else amen knowing there should be so we substitute it with a hand Shake but a handshake Never Satisfied the human soul amen a a joining of a church it never satisfies the human soul you can even have a good crying spell it will not satisfy the human soul but it would only be that God would deal with that soul with his word and only the word can truly bring a birth to satisfy the Inside Man and what he needs see that's the thirst of man is to come in contact with God y'all know that God is his word amen we know that God is his word so until the soul comes in contact with God there is no life within that Soul amen you see a man brother man said you can take a man and dress him up amen he said you can take him out here he's made out of wood and you can dress him up with chalk and whatever you want to ever so much he has no feelings he has no conscience he says he'll never take the place of a real man and neither will a bogus conversion that walks up and says I've joined the church or I'll try to do better it'll never take a place of a genuine oldfashioned God sent Holy Ghost conversion that makes a man different in his heart see I can't do it because there's no life in there there's nothing to give him life life has to come from God and God's way of giving life is through the word of God Amen you see we find out in the scriptures amen that there is an inside man I love how brother BR sometimes he'll say it he'll say we need to pinch the Inside Man and wake him up Amen in other words pinch your conscience and and make that Inside Man awaken to the things of God see there is an inside man God Amen made man he first made him in his own image with the spirit and then he put a man in five senses now not to declare him but to contact his Earthly home see a scientific part of a man the te see The Taste the feel the smell the hear is only to contact the Earthly home but the Inside Man which is a spirit contacts God since science knows nothing about it do you see the thing that contacts the Inside Man is God the thing that contacts the outside man is intellectuals it's the it's the outward expression of man there is an outside man look at the prophet says that there's an outside man that God put a human flesh here and gave him five senses to contact his Earthly home and the inside men the spirit has two senses and that is unbelief and that is Faith now see then Faith then is a substance it's not just a thought is that right faith is not just a thought faith is an actual substance amen it's a substance the outside man is govern governed by five senses but the Inside Man is governed by two senses Faith or its doubt see first before you were a natural man you were a supernatural man is that right the supernatural man is first now we think of it in backwards to what God thinks of it when you think about the Tabernacle in the wilderness we think about going into the Tabernacle and we think about it that it's the outer courts and then we go into the inner courts and then we go into the holies of holies but God starts with his word and then he puts a movement of a of an inner court and then he puts an outer court and then there's the congregation and he does it because he begins with his word he he's not on his way to his word he begins with his word and God began you with his word he put something in you and provided a way of course you could live in this human life and God put first his own image which the image of God and God is a supernatural being and he was a supernatural man and he put him in five senses and none of those senses will declare his Heavenly Home those five senses will only declare his Earthly home and God giving them senses to contact not to contact God you were never given your outward senses to contact God that's not what they're for they're for dealing with this life but there's an inside man that deals with God and Only God Alone can fix what's WR wrong with the Inside Man do you see there are two men in that understanding there are two trees in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of knowledge and there is a tree of life there's two men and each of them feed from a different tree the natural man feeds from the Tree of knowledge amen and there amen of course then one of them is the tree of knowledge the other tree of life and man can never know God by knowledge so no matter how much well we educate ourselves or how Pastor our smart our pastor is no matter how many degrees he's got God is not known by education neither is he known by scientific research the only way God is known is by faith amen that's the only way to know him is by faith Amen brother BR says it like this when man was eating on the tree of life he had eternal life but when he left the tree of life and went to the tree of the knowledge the first bite he took he separated his Fellowship from God God now here's the thing there are two men there are two bodies amen and there are two trees now you ever think that inside of your body is another man brother man said did you know that there's another man inside your body that's amazing isn't it that there's another person inside your body he's called The Inside Man and the inside man is of god it's the spirit spirit of God that's inside our being well glory be to God Amen now here's the thing you have now two men you have two consciences you have a subconscious and you have a conscience in other words in this room right now you're conscience of the natural things that are here uh that I used to preach some uh youth camps and and one time I I was watching a bunch of young guys and I and this is a little crude of saying it but you know if you got a bunch of young guys and there's a bunch of pretty young girls and they're all in the same room usually the boys don't pick their nose at that time because they're conscience that there's some girls on the other side of the room see they're conscious of this right but there is things that you're not conscious of and that's the subconscious so you might be conscious you're in this room and I'm preaching and you're speaking and you can hear everything going on in here but there are things in the sub conscience realm that your natural man is not aware that they are here but there is an inner man that is in contact with God and He Knows by his word that the angels of the Lord are encamped about this building now now we've got to mmit to this whether we feel it or we don't feel it has nothing to do with the reality that it's here amen whether as an excitement on our flesh or not an excitement on our flesh that presence is in this building right now and has nothing to do with the contact of God and the inner man do you see what it is way down in our hearts there's a subconscious now brother brandham was telling us in his own Ministry that what his ability to do is a profit was to move between the conscience and the subconscious without ever going to sleep now if you dream you enter a subconscious world and you go somewhere you don't know where you went but you come back with memories and feelings and you got all kinds of ideas but brother brandom said and sometimes when God gives it of course it declares the future and all other things but brother brandom could go to sleep while standing in the Pulpit talking to you and he would have a vision which would move him from the conscience to the subconscious realm and he could declare things that were not in the time realm at all but he could go back to Eternity where the Garden of Eden was tell you what color Eve's eyes was tell you exactly what happened in the fall he could tell you what color brother our lord Jesus robe was the day he was baptized he could tell you the pain and Agony on the road to Calvary he could speak about the woman at the well he could talk about the resurrection in the inner realm the subc conscience would make the scripture reality rather than just something you read because the inner man was moving into those reals now brother Ram said if you start overseas and he said you're going in a ship he said you see the whole ship he said it's all there he said but what's controlling that ship is the man up there in the Wheelhouse he said you got a you got a motor and you got a boat you got everything there but the thing steering it is there's a man up there in the Wheelhouse you might not be able to see and brother man said you're looking out the outward man is just a ship sailing through life but there's a man in the Wheelhouse that you're not able to see but that is the fell that's steering the ship tonight there is a there's a person down on the inside after all there's one who steering the ship amen now we got to get these fellas agreeing he brother said now we got two men and we got to get them in agreement with one another that's where healing comes is when they get in agreement one to another he said sometimes people come up to the prayer line and they'll say brother bradam I really have a lot of faith that I'm going to get healed and he said and I know they don't he said the outward intellectual man is saying I have faith he said but the inner man is still doubting he said and until the Inner Man and the outer man align with the word of God there can be no healing so it takes God to move the inner man in line with the word of God to make it come to pass and to believe it now many times when brother randam is speaking about faith to move mountains and he's talking about M Mark 11 and 24 he's discussing that there are more than one man and we've got to get them all in line before we could move forward now here's the thing there's got to be uh there's got to be an alignment of them two before that we can move forward now here Jesus brother B tells us this he says see you got to get these fellas agreeing is that right and then we move forward your orders and everything see there's nothing to make you doubt it now you go back to the hospital in the morning they say your arm is still sift your Cancer's still there now that wouldn't have one Speck of it see that wouldn't phase you a bit if this all agreed see because Faith does anything now in you is God you that have the Holy Ghost now how many's got the Holy Ghost in here tonight in you is the Holy Ghost and brother BR says see do you believe that Jesus said I give you power now let me show you the weakness of the church by God's grace I give you power over unclean spirits you'll cast them out not I will you will you will cast them out cast them out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and they shall drink dreadly thing and it will not harm them now we think of the great St Paul one time he landed on a certain Island and the ship was wrecked and God had promised him that he was going to a certain destination is that right he had to go to Rome see Caesar amen and he was going to a certain destination he was going to Rome to stand before Caesar and he believed God so he was helping the men he had changed about him as a prisoner and he was helping the man throw some wood in the fire now remember the prophecy when he was in the ship and and it looked like the ship would be destroyed that they would all be lost and the angel of the Lord came to Paul in the middle of the night and Paul rose up and said it's come to me now I got to go to Caesar and and he said anybody as long as you stay with the ship you're going to make it it's going to be okay amen and they held on and amen and and when the ship broke apart they floated ashore and he went up on the bank and the people sitting there thought well for sure this man's a prisoner or some murder or something like this he's in change he's bound and he starts warming his hands over the fire I'm paraphrasing to you he starts warming his hands over the fire and a serpent reaches out of the fire and bites him so the people sitting around surely thought well he deserves what he's getting because evidently he's not going to outrun the Justice amen but when when the scripture says but Paul then shook the thing back in the fire now they said it was a venomous State brother Brandon said more than likely it was a Mamba and when it bit him but look Paul never got fear upon him but anybody knows that the natural man built by Mamba is about to die in the natural realm the outside man knows this is the end of the road for me amen but there was another man in Paul it wasn't just one Paul sitting there there was another man on the inside and brother randam said when he throw that word that great deadly Beast serpent bit him right through his hand and the Beast was so deadly until if it bit a person he would drop dead the minute or two his chains he was a prisoner he must be a murderer he might escape the storm but he's never going to escape this serpent he's going to die but look Paul looked and seen it and this all agreed so the body the spirit the soul all agreed and there was not one Speck of fear amen there was not one Speck of fear it said they would take up serpents and it would not harm them he looked at that deathly bite and there was no fear in him well glory to God Amen a serpent bit him and he had no fear in him because he had the Inner Man and the outer man lined up together with the word of God Amen if they take up serpents they shall not harm them isn't that powerful that that word was so aligned that there was no harm not one Speck of fear you know what brother Bram said fear will do he said it'll bring it on amen he said you know fear is a giant of course fear is something that will bring destruction but there was no fear in here and he looked at that deathly bite without fear and he said Satan Steeps in Satan brings in fear but God said my perfect love it cast out fear he said there you are I'm God's man and there hangs a serpent but there's not one Speck of fear there he said he looked around and said well he shook it off in the fire and he got some more sticks and put it on and they saidwell Paul ain't you afraid you're about to fall dead he said certainly not I cannot fall dead for the holy spirit is in me now watch what he says the very holy spirit that made the heavens and the Earth had so charged this man with power to the death then that Fang of the serpent wouldn't even go into his body because his whole body was full of the spirit the same as it was full of blood Oh Glory he had blood in his body but there was more than blood in the body of Paul the power of the Holy Spirit was just as much in the body as the human blood was in the body and when that power that Holy Spirit began to move in there the Serpent's bite couldn't even touch him oh church I'll tell you what a powerful reality the serpent couldn't B him brother man said every little cell of blood is life and there you are all charged full of the Holy Ghost why certainly they walked on water now how' they do it because them men were lined up they walked on water they done great Miracles there was so perfect ly in harmony with God that's right what was it amen Paul knew he couldn't die you know why Paul couldn't die cuz God had already told him you're going to Rome and you're going to stand in front of Caesar he knew there wasn't no serpent could keep him out of Rome he knew there wasn't no shipwreck going to keep him out of there because inside he knew this man has got to fulfill the will of God that's exactly what faith is tonight faith is a revelation of the will of God and Faith won't move the outward man but faith will move the inward man and when the inward man begins to move the body has got to move with it because the inner man is in charge of the whole thing amen I don't know about you but I've had some rough mornings trying to get up and go to church and I I felt tired early in the morning time or two especially when you travel halfway around the world and you got an early morning service amen sometimes you don't want to get you don't even want to get out of bed but you know what you do brother Noah you say to your foot foot I'm the one in charge get yourself out of this bed and you tell the first foot you tell the second foot and when you hit the floor you begin to charge that body and say this old body is going to go to the house of God today and if I'm tired I'm going to preach and if I don't feel good I'm going to worship because there this body this human body is not the one in charge of my life there is another man in there he's the one that's in charge now you know what brother BR meant when he said it's not the size of the dog that's in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog who is it on the inside of you I'll tell you who it is it's the spirit of Jesus Christ the great Joshua is on the inside of the church do you see what it is amen he's telling us that that didn't phase him because he had to go Hallelujah couldn't face him because he had to go he had to go stand before him it couldn't keep him from doing it because if he tread on the head of serpents it wasn't going to harm him why he could walk over scorpions and it wouldn't harm him they could wreck the boats and it wouldn't harm him because there was a predestinated will and destination for his life and the devil is not more powerful than the purpose of God over your life I think brother Ray's favorite quote around here is that that Satan can't destroy the purpose of God and if you find the purpose of God in your life and that is inner man ever connects with it you'll know there ain't a devil there is not a hell there is not an angel out of hell that can destroy the purpose of God that has B over your life now I know amen that gets rough on legalists but we're not legalists we're Believers amen now watch because the prophet of God tells us this he said they kept waiting for him to fall dead but he couldn't cuz he had to go to Rome Hallelujah watch brother bam in this message of uh in confirmation and commission watch him transfer it to his own Ministry and he says a few minutes he said a commission had been confirmed that he had came down out of Heaven remember how they at the fire they change their confession he's a murderer he's he's getting what he deserves and then they say it must be God In the Flesh brother man said there it was confirmed his commission to go before Rome he said and here it is they said he shall tread of scorpions and and nothing shall harm them and they had the evidence to prove it now I got to hurry friends I'd stay all night here but there's a few more things the prophet said there shall come a day that is called not night or day but a dismal day and in the evening time it shall be light so brother Bram is now transferring that to his own Ministry and he's telling you I've got a destination amen before he began his ministry he was going to introduce the Messiah to the age was he not he was going to introduce Christ to the age there wasn't a denomination that could stop him is that right but listen brother Ram's greatest problem was not the denomination how many knows that brother Ram said oh no he said Martin Luther it was no no was no great miracle he could overcome the Catholic church he said it was the Fanatics around him that he would have to overcome the Fanatics around him now now I don't I don't want to get too doctrinal in this area but I want to do say this brother brandom got snake bit too y'all know what that snake was it was a deity Doctrine that's right yeah I can read it to you brother Bram said it like this he says see uh he says that a few nights ago I had a visitation from the Lord I seen a baby a serpent which was yelling black and telling me right along and the thing struck me on the leg but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me now listen to this this is this message if you want to Rick it up 19616 Revelation chapter 5 he originally titles it bruise serpent they retitled it I don't know why but well maybe I do know why but he said that he said but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect and I looked down where it had bit me and I turned to get a gun to shoot the thing right in the middle and I turned the gun to shoot it and he said just pick up the stick laying there and I turned my back and picked the stick up and it wiggled in some water he said well I can't it wiggled in water that's people right the thing wiggled off into some people and the prophet in 1960s telling them that that serpent bid him but watch he couldn't it couldn't destroy him then the seals have not even opened the revelation of the word has not come into the Perfection to bring this bride into his resurrection amen so brother bam is telling us my blood was so rich that it couldn't affect me now he's not talking about the outer man having rich blood he's talking about the inner man having rich blood listen brother B said I think we need a blood a food to build up our resistance from our diseases now don't take food and let your body get weak you'll be subject to diseases if you don't eat you're going to be subject to diseases and diseases will break into the bloodstream and here you're gone if your blood isn't rich and pure then the disease will go right into the bloodstream he says so you've got to eat good nourishing food to keep your bloodstream right if you don't you're allergic to diseases that's what's a matter with a lot of Christians come on now amen let me see what brother says here he says now the very next chapter the opening of the seals we have to skip and go to different places he says now we get to these seals and when they begin to open the mysteries of them oh how glorious with a rich spiritual vitamins amen I tell you this if you're not eating on the opening of the word there is no vitamin to keep that spirit I me listen I I I I don't hope this don't sound harsh we got some visitors God bless you and I pray for you you forgive me if I get too far here but I'll say this this amen the deity direction does not believe in the open of the seals and I always wondered why amen but if you can believe in the opening of The Seven seal you know this message wasn't introducing William brandom this is this message was not about a man William Brandon it was introducing Jesus Christ to the age we're living in the first pull was for the outer man the second pull was for the spirit man but the third pull is to the soul of the God of Jesus Christ and it'll take the opening of that word to eat if you want to stay without diseases eat that somebody said well brother wait I just can't get over problems and you know forgiveness and situations come up and I don't know how amen we can't listen brother B said it was weak blood he said but if you'll enrich that blood with good vitamins that healing would come through the bloodstream life is healing Church Life is healing you take the life out of a body and there's no healing in the body Amen brother man said it over and over cut the finger of a man if he's dead it'll never heal he said but if there's life in that man amen and the blood is Flowing right amen that that will heal back because there's power in the blood there is life In The Blood Church of the Living God the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the life in the blood that flows into the Church of the Living God and as long as there is life in the church there is healing in the church if there's life in the church there is Deliverance in the church Hallelujah if there's life in there there's something in there to bring grace and mercy now there's two different men there's an outside man and brother bam said this he feeds on psychology and intellectual but the Inside Man feeds on the word of God woo there are true trees there are two men they're both carnal and they are natural God has never been known by science am man he's never known by science he's only known by faith that's where it started was in the Garden of Eden two trees one was Tree of Life the other was a tree of knowledge and man took his first bite he separated himself from the Tree of Life and every time he bites off the tree of knowledge he continually gets further away from the tree of life because he begins to think he knows how to reason it out and you cannot reason out God you got to come back to the simple tree of life yes sir and abide under the eating of the fruit of Life glory to God looking into the Unseen you go all the way back to the Garden of Eden and brother Bram says it like this man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes he said that's where he's deceived that's where Satan deceived is by what she could see but the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was death to the soul amen something can be pleasant to the eye but it's death to the soul right do you see so is it tonight God wants to lead a man so he made a control Tire in the midst of his heart that man would be led by the spirit now getting off on his own leading is what separates him from fellowship see now here's the thing sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God your emotions is your control see and you notice a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world can never please God but a man that will not look at the things of the world and just go according to the lead of the spirit they're usually in the will of God there is a great fight tonight Satan took the eye a man's head to control him by his head and God took his heart so both Satan and God is trying to show you something God is trying to show your heart Revelation and Satan's trying to show your eye something else well here's the thing I was just thinking today I wish I was a little more uh scientific I should have probably Googled it or something but the human eye the man's eye it can't see very far actually as far as far is concerned I think they call it the Coralis effect it's a if you're a shooter you know uh it's a I used to survey and it's it's a good example if you set up a survey in uh laser uh you you only get about a th yards out of that or 1,00 feet each way from it a couple thousand feet because that there begins to be elevation change in the Earth because of the curvature of the earth and if somebody believes in Flat Earth y'all don't listen right now okay but there's there's a COR Coralis effect and uh I I'm a fisherman so Lake Erie will teach you a big lesson you go to Lake Arie you go out about 5 miles and the trees get shorter you go out 15 miles on Lake Arie and turn to look back the shore they ain't no Shore because it's out of the eyesight because of the curvature of the earth the earth gets in the way of your vision after only a few miles now if you climb up real high and you climb up in the Spheres and you say I'm going to see further from this from this mountain well if it's not a cloudy day because the atmosphere that you live in in the earth clouds are getting the way I think uh we were just up in B and I was in Edmonton and I think uh uh I think brother Ben went right down through bamp and they' been a big fire in Jasper and and uh the smoke had come into bamp so they really didn't get to see the mountains very well and if you get high on the mountain you can't see because of the clouds so when you get up in that sphere even if you can get higher there's so many atmosphere effects that keeps the vision from reaching a certain point because of the natural natur man so he can climb up in there but see a born again man can climb up in the atmospheres and things see he can get up into Faith until he can see the omnipotence of God isn't it amazing that you could start climbing that you could see the omnipotence of God see when you're down here low in the human realm you're saying that's not possible there's things that I can't do there's that situation it's never going to end this problem is never going to happen but if you begin to climb up into the fear of God in the atmospheres you begin to look and see the omnipotence of God and then you can begin to call every word a positive act because see he's designed you to climb see now man is see then limited by sight he is a sense bound man he's a sense bound existence but if he could climb up high the inner man can climb up high and the beauty of that is you can do it right in the service you you see that you don't have to leave the service to go find a mountain somewhere to climb up high but you can sit right in a service like this and the Bible said that John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day how many represents John here tonight that bride it's not your natural man he's representing he's representing your spiritual man and the Bible said he got in the spirit on the Lord's day so in this leosan age somebody can get in the spirit isn't that powerful somebody can get in the spirit and the prophet of God said it like this when you get in the spirit everything looks different and when he got up in the spirit in Revelations 4 called up out of the loud to see an age into a door that was opened up in heaven what could he see from that door he could see the Throne of God he could see himself sitting around the Throne of God he could look all the way in eternity amen from the island of patmas I tell you the island of patmas was a prison but you can't put a man in prison that can get in the spirit of God you can't keep him down because God can lift him up and he can look up and see beyond now of course Abraham is a great example of this because Faith actually Our Father Abraham being not weak in faith he could look in Romans 4:16 he said therefore it is a faith that it might be of the grace of God to the end of the promise be sure to all that not only that which is the law but to that also which is the faith of Abraham is the father of us all and as it is rich and I have made thee the father of many nations before whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calth things which be not as though they were amen now that's powerful to me now how could he see things that wasn't it's because the natural man wasn't doing the looking see what it was faith that saw it it wasn't the human man that saw it Heen to heal nothing had changed but Faith had changed the inside man that he is able to see see inside man it looks through the eyes and seees things that are not now look it can look into the Unseen say you need a healing tonight it's an unseen thing but the prophet of God said if you need something unseen he said like you say to me I need an acor tree he said I need an oak tree he said well I want it in my front yard he said but I could give you an acre I'm giving you the Unseen version of an oak tree if I give you an ACR you say well give me an oak tree and I give you an ACR I've given you an oak tree in potential I've given you the visible Oak Tree in The Invisible real and if you know the power of a seed you'll take that seed and put it in the place you want it to grow because you know there's a law over the seed that will bring forth of its own kind and brother Ram said it like this now you've got the tree and Seed form and you might as well begin to Rejoice because you got that tree and Seed form it'll produce and you take this ACR and put it in the ground and a little box somewhere and set in the house and keep it watered the first thing you know it comes up as a little acor tree is that right and that trans set it in the yard but you can praise God as sure as you get the acor because you've got the tree already and when God said I am the Lord that Health thee just start praising you got it right there amen amen you don't see results but that don't make any difference see you got it anyhow cuz the word of God is the seed is that right and when a seed is sold with Incorruptible seed what is it it makes the impossible possible because it's the seed of God that has been given to you that is the very story of our faith now we can't use our intellectuals and go there it must be in our faith faith causes you to see things differently you look at the Outlook things are different when faith is looking you ever notice where the Bible said Moses who seeing the invisible who seeing the invisible thought it that he would rather have the reproach of Christ greater than the riches of Egypt so by what he was looking at in the spirit he would rather have that when it's at its worst than Egypt when it was at its best amen is't that powerful he would rather have the worst God had to offer was better than the best the world had to offer because he wasn't looking at it as a natural man it was the inner man that was looking at it and saw by faith what God had said about those people watch you got two men again you got Pharaoh you got Moses Inner Man outer man and they're looking at the same people and the prophet of God said they looked at the same window at the same people and Pharaoh when he looked at it he saw mud dobers he saw he just saw a bunch of slaves he saw something he could make fun of Amen but when Moses looked at it he saw the promise of God when Moses looked at it he saw the grace of God bringing the people out of slavery and becoming the very Heritage of God do you see the outward man looks at the church and they see all the problems and they see all the issues and they see all the humanity but let the inner man look at the same person out the same window at the same problem and the inner man will see it much different than the outer man amen because your outward man is controlled by six different senses or five different senses and your inward man is only controlled by two now brother bam will go into this very powerful and he say now here's the thing a real genine Christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that was back Yonder at the beginning which is the word he was the fullness of all of you your body your spirit and your soul you were in him back under under at Calvary he forew you what you would be here and he only broadcast what would take place now you were were in him you died with him you died to your pride you died to your Fashions you died to the world you died with him in Calvary and you Rose up with him when he rose again see because you've accepted it now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ well you why I'm sitting in Bluffton Ohio and true word Tabernacle the outward man is sitting in True Word Tabernacle and Bluff in Ohio but the inner man is sitting resurrected with Christ in Heavenly places that where I am there ye may be also that's what he said amen he sent this message to take you where he is if he is lifted up the bride has been lifted up that's right there's an inside man and it will punctuate it with the word of God brother Ram said I learned that years ago I learned that years ago and he goes into the example and he said when my wife died I was holding her by the hands crying for her now watch what he he's talking about the Inside Man and the outside man and my daddy in his arms died this arm right here his daddy died in his arms his wife died and he was crying for her and as I prayed as hard as I could how could I face the public again there's the real issue to preach Divine Healing how could I preach that he is a good god and let my daddy die a sinner how could I preach that I don't know how but I know he's right amen woo am the word of God shall never fail it shall Triumph no matter what it is then I know there was something inside of all these reasonings something's inside of these emotions everything else is like that there was an inside man that held me in that hour listen he didn't feel like shouting that afternoon he didn't feel like having a glory train or having a Jericho March amen he was tore to pieces and and his reasonings were saying there is no reason to preach the gospel there's no reason to preach Divine Healing but there was somebody in his emotions there was somebody else in his reasoning there was an inside man in there that held to the word of God listen I tell you when you can't hold on as a God that can hold on anyhow when you have worn out and fainted and you're tired and you don't know how to go on thank God there's an inside man there somebody tied to the power of God nothing else could have done it everything showed everything proved was wrong and I was wrong but the word of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world held on inside that Inside Man then is the predestinated word of God from the beginning do you hear what he's saying that's what held on to me that's what made Paul walk past the snake bite that's what made brother bandam move beyond the deity teachings that's what made him move be beond the fanaticisms is there was something that was on the inside amen you sometimes can't reason it out you can't reason it out but it has to be revealed to you now brother Bram brings it up can you bring up that first picture brother Brown brings it up and if you've never seen these pictures it it might help you a little bit um you know how much of a teacher I am so forgive me amen but brother Bram is making this if you're reading greatest battle ever fought soul and Spirit are flipped but in the late 65 6465 he corrects it and says the soul is the inside of the inside and the spirit if you'll watch What's Happening Here look on that outside body look at the influence trying to come into that body look at that sickness fear and hatred strife and envy and lust and pride and Malice and tensions look at all the different look at all the different things attacking that outward man now if you go into that Spirit realm look at how much how much it's shrinking it's shrinking to memory and re reasoning affection imagination and conscience but take one more step into the soul and it's just faith and doubt now in that soul is where the predestinated gene that's the inner the inside man that's on the inside now brother bandam will teach us that's the real you give me the next one there I I've got to hurry quicker than I meant to but let's just put it let's just get it real close Genesis 1 2627 is one man Genesis 27's the other man the gene of God now that's that can I say it to you let's start before we that's the real you how many ever heard brother Ram say it this body that you're looking at it's not the real you but the real you is inside and that real you is Heavenly is that right that real you is theophonic that real you is perfect that's not your theophany body but there is a real theophany there is a perfect there is an immortal it's sinless it lives by the word it's written in the lamb Book of Life yes sir it possesses Zoey life it is the real you now that outward man is Earthly and flesh and it's imperfect and it's mortal and it's born in sin it loves the world it's written in the book of life it needs a new birth it's the negative VI now until you separate them two people you're going to live a very confused life until you're able to understand that that outward man has all kinds of things coming at him all the time that he is open to the elements if you don't put clothes on you get cold see the inner man though he's only moved by two senses by faith or doubt see but that outward man so you you I I'll show it to you in scripture first Thessalonians 5 and 22 23 1 Thessalonians 5 and 23 the very God of Peace sanctify you holy I pray God for your whole spirit and soul and body so Paul was teaching this as well you your spirit your soul your body brother bam said you're a triun being now watch this you're a triun being now Hebrews 4 and 12 says that the word is powerful sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even dividing the soul and the spirit people say well to me is there really a difference of Soul and Spirit Well just read that scripture it tells you there is now it says to the dividing of so it tells us it can be divided there is somebody that can divide the difference between the SP Spirit and the Soul it takes the word of God so there's two men there's an outward man and an inner man and the inner man is divided in two people there is a spirit and there is a soul can I say it to you there is three kinds of Believers in every crowd and instead of looking over at somebody just look at yourself this old boy on the outside I hate to tell you but he don't believe nothing he's just an unbeliever now if you can get pretty deep in this but can we just can we just say it that the Bible said that that the dust shall be the meat of the serpent all the days of its life where's that serpent bite the people brother Bram said God's calling these children to separate from the evil one who is it the man on the outside see taste feel smell here now look what he's telling you there's an unbeliever out here on the outside but there's a unbeliever but there's a mate believer somewhere somebody said well you're calling me a mate believer I say your spirit is I say your spirit can flip-flop on you I say you can be in one crowd and feel one way and get in another crowd and feel another way and your spirit will flip-flop on you just like this but down inside of that spirit is a soul that's right and that soul is a gene that come from God from before the foundation of the world and that is a real believer he believes when you're up he believes when you're down he believes when you're sick he believes when you're in trouble he believes when the police is shouting he believes when it's not shouting he doesn't care because he's a Believer I tell you God has made amen the spirit of God has come that he might be able to separate that you might see there's an inside to the inside that's where you are that's where your start is is in the soul inside this body see there is a control tower it's directed from the inside see that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul now the Third Realm now we won't spend too much much timer but let's just go here to the to to for a couple more minutes the five senses are on the outer realm and there's only one way you can get into that body is by those five senses yeah but then there's five that lets you get into the spirit realm of conscience and reasoning and memory and you know there there's five for the spirit five for the soul there's 10 of them which represents the 10 spies that were back there in the days of Joshua and they all said we cannot possess this promise we can't do it amen but there's a soul in there saying we can possess this promise we can receive this word of God inside of that inside what is it it's a soul now what is a soul it's you you are a soul the part inside of you that see Never Dies now in leadership brother Brown says it about is plain there's a bunch of quotes but let me get this one's real plain he said now watch this many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell H ain't that amazing look brother Bram then says there is an outside person you've got five different senses and God gave you senses to contact him your Earthly home with see taste feel smell and hear then you got a spirit on the inside of that and it has five Outlets of conscience love so forth five Outlets to contact the spirit world your physical contacts the physical your spiritual contacts the spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is a gene that has come from God now look what he's telling you this is outside of the realm of whether you has set in the rain or not set in the rain this is what God has sent into this age that is predestinated and determined of God to have a bride amen it's the word of God brother Ram said things that are to be I got the B AP ISM of the Holy Spirit he said that has nothing to do with it I know that's tough but let's just get to the real point that has nothing to do with it it's only a temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul that was born of God it controls the whole thing now you say preacher what are you trying to get at let's just continue for a moment amen what he says here he says remember now kesis and balum they prophesied that didn't have nothing to do with this inside unless that was God's seed oh now we're at the point unless that was God's seed his Gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished I don't care how much you shout and speak with tongues or run and Shout It has nothing to do with it wo he said preacher where you going can I say it the rain falls on the just and the unjust the rain when it comes now brother Ram said it comes of course when the rain falls on the church he said it falls on the just and the unjust he said of course the rain is coming for the just of course God sent the rain for the just but the unjust get under the rain the same as the just get under the rain but listen you can pour all the water you want to on a cabar it's always going to be a cuar but if you ever get the water on a weak grain Hallelujah it'll be a grain to begin with you see what brother Bram saying you amen he's saying to you amen I joined the church he said you can join the church but so did the just and the unjust and you could join all the church you want but if you wasn't a seed from the beginning Church join it ain't never going to help you amen you can get the Holy Ghost but if you won the seed from the beginning it's never going to help you so if you ever recognize you're a seed it don't matter if it's good days bad days it don't matter if it's trouble it don't matter if there's rejoicing it means I am a Jee that has come from God hallelujah hallelujah it's outside the realm of humanity the soul the soul now watch brother bam said see to understand it you got to take the message of the hour he says see that's it you got to take the message of the hour either you receive it or you reject it that's eternal life you receive the message or reject it that's your eternal life the choice of your conduct you're either for God or against God and the outward Expressions what's on the inside many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven but that don't mean that you're going to heaven you can have the baptism every hour in your life and be lost and go to hell the Bible says so I thought the Bible says so yes the Bible says so First Corinthians the Bible said you can speak with tongues of men and angels but if you don't have charity look what he saying amen the baptism of the spirit that was falling in the Pentecostal age they were given it as speaking in tongues and shouting and gifts and dancing and brother said you could do every bit of that but if you're rejecting the message the seed life is wrong amen but if that Seed Life Is Right Hallelujah let the bad days come let the good days come it doesn't make any difference listen cloudy skies and rainy days are no sign of God's disapproval amen I say tonight you need to get outside of the realm of our feel or I think or I hope and step into the realm of seed life I know I come from God and there's not enough Devils out of hell to ever stop the Church of the Living God God has ordained this generation and there will be nothing that can hinder it hallelujah hallelujah what is it it's dealing with the seed they both live by the same water one's anointed to denomination the other's anointing to the word hey what is it unless that was God's seed from the beginning you're finished let me tell y'all something I know you know it but I want to remind you this the Rapture is by election don't you ever let the devil talk you out that the Rapture is not your Works folks right right I'm sorry it's not the Rapture is not your works the Rapture is by election what is the difference in the five wise and the five foolish virgin he said I laid my material out and put a pattern over it and that which fell into the pattern was the wise virgin and that that wasn't in the pattern was the foolish amen I say tonight that God has ordained a bride to stand in this generation and if that bride seed is on the inside of you listen the devil better always get out of the way because the Church of the Living God can divide the difference tonight look at the prophet he'll speak it here he said your soul is a part of God you're an attribute of God but you're just displayed on the earth amen now I want to take a couple scriptures and listen what he says for by one offering we're perfected forever them that are Sanctified do you know it's impossible for a man of God that is a seed of God that has been regenerated under him impossible for that man to be lost do y'all know that you know Hebrews 6 says it is impossible do you know that it's impossible and brother Ashton that's the devil's favorite scripture it's the favorite scripture he has to beat down the children of God that if they have failed somewhere or they've had trouble somewhere the devil always say well you can't never get right it's impossible for you to ever to get right and it's a complete twisting of the scripture what that scripture means is a seed of God go on and read it it said the rainfalls and some bring forth briers unto rejection but others bring forth the fruit of the field brother said there it is the rainfall but there's a just and there's an unjust the rain will fall but there's a seed and there's a nonseed but there is something on the inside listen you didn't become seed when you come to the altar you didn't come seed when you found the baptism of the Holy Ghost the reason you come to the altar is there was a seed in you the reason you got life is there was a seed in you the the seed was first Hallelujah it was first that's why you are who you are tonight that's why you keep pressing on in the middle of every struggle in the middle of every battle because seed is on the inside yes sir brother bam said it very clearly now now if you're if you're if you're if you're a legalist I I apologize ahead of time you're going to make mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do wrong I'm reading you go out sometimes and do things that you don't mean to do but that don't mean you're lost that means you're going to get correction I'm reading my little boy a lot of times will do things you know that it's against your rules and you know what they expect when they do it and they're going to get a weapon for it and sometimes it's a good one but it's still your child and it's impossible for a man to ever be gone again that once been born of eternal life God is not an Indian giver and he that Hearth my words and believeth on him has passed from Death under life amen and shall not come into the in into it now listen here's here's here's where I here's where I want to really major this point you got to narrow the battle you can't fight the battle with 10 fronts uh oh I I I wish I was a better pronunciator that's good brother but the but the but the human mind brother B says the Battleground right you got Gettysburg and you got uh waterl you got great Battlegrounds right but I was studying one what's I can't pronounce it thermop thermop kind of like a thermometer thermop good I'm there now I can get that thermop y'all know I'm above my pray grade don't you thermop but it was a guy named Le leonitis and he had a bunch of he had a bunch of soldiers but his soldiers I think I was reading here earlier maybe had about 7,000 men Collective to fight and he was fighting against a Persian army that some estimates put it in millions and some estimates put it in 300,000 but what difference does it make he had 7,000 it's unbelievable odds but there was a there was an actual place here that was called Hot Springs is that correct it was called the hot springs and what they were doing is Brother s they were coming out of the ships to invade Greece and they were coming out like droves and they were coming up the hills now if they could have spread out say they had a say they was in Lima Ohio you'd have been in trouble cuz they'd have been 40 mies wide but they were living in mountainous regions and it was along the coast so what they did was leonius de developed a spot where he could bring the battle down to a channel where there was just a few men could fit through so there might be there might be 200 100 million Horsemen behind but he could whip them one devil at a time listen you got to narrow the battle you got to you got to you got to get the channel smaller you can't fight the devil on 10 fronts bring him down to the Inside Man and Whi that devil somebody said what do you mean brother bam said Richmond whipped him how did he take for uh Richmond he said he took it one step at a time just as he came to it and how you going to whip 200 100,000,000 demons in this age just as I come to them but if I bring it down to the soul realm I can whip them one devil at a time we don't have to whip them all the same day but let's Channel it down and whip them as they come I believe the Church of the Living God has a right to take it into the soul realm bring it down there where it can be ruined are you understanding what I'm saying yeah because your failure Satan's trying to fight you in your failures and you're struggling there and brother man said in in your emotions you're struggling he'll beat you there so take the battle into the soul where you can say to Satan no matter the failures I'm a Son of God no matter the struggle I'm a Son of God well you can say bring all you got devil I'm a Son of God when I feel good I'm a son when I feel bad I'm a son when I wake up in the morning I'm a son I'm a Son of God bring the battle where you can win it you can't fight all these Devils at the same time you're a human being too many problems folks there's too many ways for the devil to get to you right oh if you're going to if you're going to fight in the flesh listen some of you young boys have the devil wh you tomorrow he got some little strip tees to walk out in the Bikini out in front of you look at there where you went if that's the realm you're living in you're done the first [Applause] look come on come out of that thing and step over into a realm where you have authority step into that realm where you can stand with that enemy as long as you live there in that carnal brother bam said you're controlled by them senses now I know this is beating the Devil up real bad but somebody might already call the amulets for him do y'all know there were two William Brams y'all know that yeah now how can I take a cuar and make a grain of weed out of it impossible to do it the only way it can be is the inside of that cuar has been transmitted from a cuar to a wheat life so brother Braham is now not talking about seed life not wheat and cuar but he's talking about eternal life or wheat life in a cuar nature and he says this life has been taken out but the nature of a cuar is still sticky and until this new life is fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth it's no more cuar but a wheat but while here on Earth this cuar is sticky and it's got the nature of the wheat on the inside and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and you're going to have a carnal nature and that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside of you you're born again do do you see what brother Ram's doing for you canot tell you the prayer lines were young people that got the baptism of the holy ghost in a prayer line two years ago come back in the prayer line and they say I thought that I had received something but I did something wrong or I said something wrong or I felt something wrong and in the immaturity of that life Satan is telling you that you didn't get nothing that's right when you got everything but if you can't divide the two he's going to lie to you the rest of your life and you'll be a 60 or 70 year old person saying I'm not sure if I have the Holy Ghost because you're not separating the spirit and the Soul now do you see here what he's trying to say to you brother Bram says now to to settle this he said there was an old indan he said he said it was no end and he said Billy Paul went to give him some prayer cards and he said you know he's passing them out and he said he wouldn't give them to him it wasn't sick and he said he'd been giving people the headaches and things and he said I wanted to give them to somebody really was troubled and he said he brother Billy Paul went over and he started to give the prayer card to this old boy and he said he was an Indian he said uh he said I want a prayer card and bil he said what's wrong he said me sick he said you sick he said me sick he said well what's wrong with you cuz brother bramman told him find out what's wrong before you get in prayer card he said he didn't tell him so he went on he come back a little later and the old boy seen prayer cards leaving he said hey I want a prayer card give me one and he said what's wrong with you he said me sick so he kept saying be sick so brother Bram said come to find out when he talked to somebody and told him what was wrong they said well we taught him English but the only English word we taught him was me sick so he didn't know how to say anything me sick so somebody asked him they said hey chief they said somebody told me that youd got converted and received the Holy Ghost he said how you getting along he said me pretty good me pretty bad he said what you mean you pretty good you pretty bad he said well since I got saved he said I got two dogs in me I got a black dog and I got a white dog and they're always a fight in one another and somebody said well which one of them's winning he said whichever one I feed the most so how you doing pretty good pretty bad and sometimes you ask them how you doing pretty good pretty bad but listen tonight if you're separated you can do real good you can take that word and begin to eat it like a Believer and when that devil shows up and says you ain't got nothing you take the word of God and put him out of your house Satan I can tell you the time and I can tell you the place I can tell you when the Lord now you you got to be careful cuz when you say that then you got somebody that's a young person is going to be scared to come to a prayer line to ask for the Holy Ghost don't you let that don't you let that get in your spirit as we believe in it you keep coming till you got satisfied you got it that's what you do how long does it take to get the Holy Ghost as long as it takes don't take it don't take a day or 10 days it takes the moment that it happens and if I hadn't got the Holy Ghost 25 30 years ago I'd still be praying for it tonight because it receives I want you to stand to your feet with us tonight there's two men I kept hearing brother brand say have the Holy Ghost every day and it not matter have the rain on the J in the UN and I kept thinking how could a true seed be rained on and still be lost it's because he's not talking to you he's not talking to the gene seed of God because he turns it right around to tell you that once that is born that there would be no way of taking it away from you that's right don't you loving for it tonight A
