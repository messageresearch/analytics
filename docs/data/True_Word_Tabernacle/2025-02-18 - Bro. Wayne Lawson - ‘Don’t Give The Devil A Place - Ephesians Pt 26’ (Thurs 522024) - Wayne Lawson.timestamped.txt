[5:59] bit in this uh if the Lord just keeps me
[6:01] in it and I may pull out of it and come
[6:03] back but uh for the next month and a
[6:05] half or so we're going to try to labor
[6:06] in this and and finish this finish this
[6:09] portion of the book amen Ephesians
[6:11] chapter
[6:12] 4 and I want to read from the 23rd
[6:17] verse and be renewed in the spirit of
[6:21] your
[6:22] mind and that you put on the new man
[6:26] which after God is created and
[6:30] righteousness and true Holiness I like
[6:32] the way Paul says that and righteousness
[6:35] and true Holiness amen wherefor putting
[6:38] away
[6:39] lying speak every man truth with his
[6:42] neighbor for we are
[6:45] members one of
[6:47] another now be angry and sin
[6:52] not let not the sun go down upon your
[6:57] wrath I like way he says this
[7:01] neither give place to the
[7:05] devil and that's kind of where we want
[7:07] to speak to you a little bit tonight
[7:10] don't give the devil a place right let's
[7:14] just bow our hearts Heavenly Father we
[7:15] thank you tonight we thank you for the
[7:18] Gathering of your children here Lord and
[7:20] the
[7:20] blessing father that wherever two or
[7:23] three are gathered in my name there that
[7:25] you would be in the midst of them and
[7:27] father I pray tonight that your great
[7:29] would just come upon your word as we
[7:31] have been endeavoring to look upon these
[7:34] things Lord seeking you asking you for
[7:37] your grace Lord in these subjects and we
[7:40] just ask now that you would come Lord
[7:42] and you would lead us in your word
[7:44] speaking to the needs father now we ask
[7:47] it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we
[7:49] pray amen and amen and God bless you as
[7:54] you could have your seats amen I want to
[7:56] talk to you a little bit tonight about
[7:58] don't give the Dev a place now Jesus
[8:01] says it here in the Book of John the
[8:03] 14th chapter 29th verse he said I told
[8:07] you before that it come to pass when it
[8:09] came to pass you might believe Hereafter
[8:13] I will not talk much with you for the
[8:16] prince of the world cometh and have
[8:18] nothing in me amen I want to say it the
[8:22] way the Lord said it that devil ain't
[8:23] got nothing in me amen he had no place
[8:27] in God he had no place in Christ he had
[8:30] nothing in him you know I find that uh
[8:34] is the Bible has predicted that this is
[8:37] a great season of of uh Supernatural
[8:40] manifestations even as the Bible would
[8:43] call it the day when the son of man is
[8:45] to be revealed now if you wonder how far
[8:47] that's come along they asked brother
[8:49] brandom said when the son of man is
[8:50] revealed from Heaven said when will that
[8:53] be brother BR said he's now being
[8:55] revealed from heaven so we find that we
[8:58] have found ourselves in in the junction
[9:00] of time amen and immortality and
[9:03] mortality have began to Junction
[9:06] together and that's why the age has been
[9:07] chalk full of Supernatural events and
[9:10] angels and manifestations of every kind
[9:13] and uh and even in the anointing of the
[9:15] great seventh angel when he began to
[9:17] come uh in anointed ones of the end time
[9:19] of course the Bible talks about Christ
[9:22] and false Christ so we know there's
[9:23] great anointings coming upon the end
[9:25] time and it's for the manifesting or the
[9:28] fulfilling of scripture that's why the
[9:30] anointing is coming and brother Ram
[9:32] tells us this in not one's the end time
[9:34] he said now I want you to know and you
[9:36] that listen to this tape that you might
[9:37] have thought today that I was trying to
[9:40] say something about myself being that I
[9:42] was packing a message but I have no more
[9:44] to do with that than nothing it's just a
[9:47] voice and my voice against my better
[9:50] judgment and I wanted to be a Trapper
[9:52] but it's the will of my father that I
[9:54] have declared to do and determined to do
[9:57] now I wasn't the one that appeared down
[10:00] on the river y'all know this quote well
[10:01] don't you and I was only standing there
[10:04] when he appeared now people wonder so
[10:07] brother Wayne when's the appearing of
[10:09] the lord well listen to this I was
[10:11] standing there when he appeared I'm the
[10:13] one that performs the things and
[10:15] foretells them that happens as perfect
[10:17] as they are I'm only one that's near
[10:20] when he does it I was only a voice that
[10:23] he used to say it it wasn't what I knew
[10:27] it's what I surrendered myself to yes
[10:31] sir it he spoke through it isn't me not
[10:35] the seventh angel It's the
[10:37] manifestation of the son of man it
[10:39] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[10:42] mystery that God unfolded not a man God
[10:45] the angel was not the son of man he was
[10:47] the messenger from the son of man the
[10:50] son of man is Christ he is the one
[10:53] you're feeding on now this is what he's
[10:56] saying you're he's the one you're
[10:58] feeding on now you're not feeding on a
[11:00] man a man and his words will fail but
[11:03] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[11:07] word of the son of man now if you
[11:09] haven't fed fully on every word to give
[11:11] yourself strength to Fly Above
[11:13] denominations I pray that you do at this
[11:15] time now notice what he's telling us
[11:18] amen and I love the way brother bam
[11:20] introduces this he says to us it wasn't
[11:22] what I did it's what I surrendered
[11:25] myself to it was God was appearing it
[11:28] was the appearing of the Lord it was the
[11:30] revealing of the son of man but there
[11:32] had to be a body to manifest that there
[11:35] had to be a lot of people kind of gets
[11:37] that mixed up on the sheath waving and
[11:39] they they get worried whether or not you
[11:40] believe it was brother bandam or you
[11:42] believe it was Christ but of course it
[11:43] was Christ but he had to have a body to
[11:46] manifest through to prove that it was
[11:49] the full maturity or the adoption age
[11:51] amen and we seen that he did it because
[11:54] now this is prophecy of what he
[11:56] surrendered himself to now Hebrews the
[11:58] first chapter uh it says God in Sun
[12:01] Times spoke through diverse manners to
[12:02] the fathers but in the last day by his
[12:04] son Christ Jesus now brother Ram said
[12:07] there it is it's the Holy Spirit taking
[12:09] possession of the church to operate
[12:12] Christ in the church now he's going to
[12:15] compare now he Hebrews 1 with
[12:18] Revelations 10 and Luke 17 he's telling
[12:21] you what is happening is it's what I was
[12:23] surrendering to it was Christ it was not
[12:26] the seventh angel it was the son of man
[12:29] it's Christ coming in see it's the Holy
[12:32] Spirit taking possession Amen to operate
[12:36] Christ in the church now when you become
[12:38] as he was he become as you was now how
[12:41] could he become as he was he become you
[12:44] that you might become him now it's above
[12:47] our understanding and there's no way to
[12:50] explain that and don't try just accept
[12:54] it see he spoke it and that settles it
[12:57] just say it's right and believe it am
[12:59] amen all that was in God he poured into
[13:02] Christ and all that was in Christ he's
[13:04] poured it in the church now don't try to
[13:06] explain that just believe that amen just
[13:09] believe that's the truth amen I might
[13:12] not be able to make a sense of that but
[13:14] I certainly believe it's the truth and
[13:16] know that God made a way for it to do it
[13:18] now of course it didn't happen all to
[13:20] once did it amen when God poured himself
[13:22] into you amen he baptized you with the
[13:25] Holy Ghost it was the changing of the
[13:26] Soul we know that we had an old soul and
[13:29] it died and a New Soul and people tried
[13:31] to say well there's two Souls no it was
[13:33] a redeemed soul and if you're wondering
[13:35] just take the the Earth itself and look
[13:37] there's not there's three different
[13:39] Earths three different worlds one Earth
[13:41] right amen so there's an old you and a
[13:44] new you amen and God created but that
[13:46] Spirit began to move on you but but
[13:48] brother Bram says it like this from the
[13:50] Messiah he says see he told Joshua that
[13:53] he could possess everywhere his foot
[13:55] touched right amen so when Joshua
[13:57] crossed the Jordan River R he was in the
[14:00] promised land but he didn't possess
[14:02] every inch of it the first day but as he
[14:05] began to walk and you remember brother
[14:06] man said he said how did Grant take
[14:08] Richmond he said just as he came to it
[14:11] and how do we take the promised land
[14:13] just as we come to it and whenever you
[14:15] put your foot on something you begin to
[14:17] possess it and brother Ram said see
[14:19] what's happening he says see there's
[14:22] when a person's borned again he says
[14:23] it's like a button like the light about
[14:26] the size of a button entered your soul
[14:28] he said then it begins to take over it
[14:30] begins to it begins to now what it was
[14:33] promising in this age is it's promising
[14:35] a complete possession right not just
[14:38] justification that light will grow out
[14:40] to sanctification it'll grow out to a
[14:42] baptism of the spirit but it'll even go
[14:44] further than that in this age it will be
[14:46] an incarnate God or it will come to the
[14:49] place of full manifestation of every
[14:51] scripture that is written for the bride
[14:53] Church it begins to take possession and
[14:56] brother bam says it begins to take over
[14:58] the fibers of of you that's powerful
[15:00] isn't it he begins a spreading out he
[15:02] goes to working through you in you and
[15:04] around you amen it begins a a feeling of
[15:07] the fibers some many ever heard brother
[15:09] Bram say I want to I want to be so full
[15:11] till every fiber is filled up is that
[15:14] right now listen if you want to keep the
[15:15] devil out you just get full is that
[15:17] right amen if you want to keep the devil
[15:20] out of your life just get your life so
[15:22] full of God there's no room for the
[15:24] devil amen amen if you get a glass
[15:26] completely full there's no room for
[15:28] anything else in it and when alive and
[15:30] every fiber of your body begins to be
[15:32] filled with the Holy Ghost amen there's
[15:35] no room for the devil amen because it's
[15:37] a pressing out of the devil it's a
[15:39] pushing and and now the devil was
[15:41] inhabiting I know he was but there's a
[15:44] dis inhabiting of the devil and an
[15:46] inhabiting of God in the age that we're
[15:48] living in now the prophet tells us of
[15:51] course he says about man you remember
[15:54] brother B talking about man's a even in
[15:56] his Fallen State he's still a God right
[15:58] and he talks about how that a man could
[16:00] stand on one side of the world and break
[16:03] a glass on the other side of the world
[16:05] and he said that's the reason that God
[16:07] was man and man was God and we are his
[16:10] offsprings and he's only trying to get a
[16:13] hold of a man or get a man in his hand
[16:16] and that's all J's trying to do is get a
[16:18] man in his hand that's really what he
[16:20] wants amen remember brother BR said the
[16:22] most powerful thing in the world is not
[16:23] an atomic bomb he said it's a believer
[16:26] in contact with his maker and when a
[16:28] Believer gets in contact with his maker
[16:30] he already was an offspring of God he
[16:32] already was a son but he was a fallen
[16:35] son and when the spirit of God comes
[16:37] upon him he becomes a redeemed son and a
[16:39] redeemed son in contact with his God
[16:42] Amen there's nothing God cannot do
[16:44] through that man all things are possible
[16:47] to him that believes is God Amen because
[16:49] you become so full and your every fiber
[16:52] becomes full of God until God can
[16:55] operate through that human being in a
[16:57] Divine way I think it's powerful tonight
[16:59] in the Messiah brother brandom tolds us
[17:01] he said not not everything is a con
[17:03] conductor not all theology is the right
[17:06] kind of conductor so if you're trying to
[17:08] get electricity from the power pole into
[17:11] this place you got to have a conduit to
[17:13] do so and there's wires that'll carry
[17:15] that electric and amen and if you turn
[17:17] the lights on back here lights don't
[17:19] come on we don't go around and say hey
[17:21] there's no such thing as electricity
[17:23] amen we go back checking is it the
[17:25] breaker is it the conduit what what is
[17:28] it that has been broken because we know
[17:30] electricity is real we've seen it too
[17:32] many times but if there's no light in
[17:34] the room amen then we've got to find out
[17:37] what is the problem well I tell you
[17:39] there's something to do with a conduit
[17:41] there's something amen that has broken
[17:43] down between the power source and the
[17:46] outlet and brother B said see not all
[17:48] theology is a conductor to the power of
[17:51] God not all not everything you hear will
[17:54] be a conductor to the power of God it's
[17:55] good to see you brother Carle amen I
[17:57] know you he worked to get here here
[17:58] tonight amen you see what it is not
[18:01] everything is a conduit sometimes
[18:02] brother R says it like this a lot of
[18:05] theology is an insulator to it a lot of
[18:09] theology is an insulator to the power of
[18:11] God it ought to be see the word of God
[18:14] ought to bring the power of God the word
[18:16] of God are to bring life the word of God
[18:18] are to bring healing amen but when
[18:21] theology becomes an insulator to the
[18:23] power of God that's time to get rid of
[18:25] the theology I don't know about you but
[18:27] I'm not interested in being a theologian
[18:29] I want to be a Son of God full of the
[18:32] power of God Amen with the grace of God
[18:34] in our lives tonight and I believe that
[18:37] I believe a lot of theology is an
[18:39] insulator from it and I know there's a
[18:41] lot of churches but not all churches are
[18:42] True
[18:43] Churches brother bam said it's called
[18:45] Blasphemous names there's a lot of
[18:47] theology there's a lot of religiosity
[18:50] Amen but there is a true church in the
[18:52] middle of all of this there is a true
[18:54] church and I just think and believe that
[18:56] we're a part of that true church I don't
[18:58] believe are that only true church but I
[19:01] believe we're a part of the body of the
[19:02] True Church of the Living God because
[19:05] brother Ram said Christ in the true
[19:07] church is a continuation of the book of
[19:10] Acts see what it is it's not the acts of
[19:12] a man it's the acts of God in a man it's
[19:16] not what we can do it's what can we
[19:18] surrender ourselves to amen if God could
[19:21] get a man in his hand what could really
[19:23] happen in the house of God tonight if we
[19:25] could get every fear and every doubt and
[19:27] every anxiety and every every bit of the
[19:30] theology that brings fear upon man what
[19:33] could God do if he could get you in his
[19:35] hands tonight amen the gift brother Ram
[19:37] said was man getting out of the way so
[19:40] God could come into the church and act
[19:42] the way he wants to brother Ram said
[19:44] Christ and the true church is a
[19:45] continuation of the book of Acts and it
[19:48] shows that how the Antichrist Spirit
[19:50] would come into the church and he would
[19:52] try to defile it making it lukewarm
[19:55] formal and Powerless now there is the uh
[19:59] there is what the objective of the
[20:01] Antichrist spirit is the objective the
[20:04] Antichrist is to defile to make lukewarm
[20:07] formal and Powerless so when you see
[20:10] something trying to defile the moving of
[20:12] the spirit something trying to make a
[20:14] people lukewarm amen or make them formal
[20:17] and make them powerless that's is the
[20:20] object of the Antichrist Spirit now what
[20:23] is the object of the spirit of God Amen
[20:25] to make a man in his hand so he can
[20:28] become conduit to the works of God and
[20:30] he could become another book of Acts
[20:32] when God is dealing with you amen you
[20:35] become an open conduit for the spirit of
[20:37] God when the spirit of the Antichrist is
[20:40] dealing with you you become closed up
[20:42] fearful doubtful unbelieving amen become
[20:45] ashamed of the things of God because you
[20:48] see the the the Antichrist spirit is
[20:51] anti- word or anti the move of
[20:55] God Amen now the seed of discrepancy
[20:57] brother bam says when when a man stands
[21:00] a gospel preacher even and says the days
[21:02] of Miracles is passed that is the seed
[21:05] of discrepancy now if you go back to the
[21:07] Book of Genesis the serpent seed
[21:09] remember it was the seed of the serpent
[21:11] which was sown contrary to the word of
[21:13] God had Adam and Eve only stayed with
[21:15] the word life would have come by the
[21:17] word but the moment that Satan come in
[21:20] he anointed Eve with unbelief of God's
[21:23] word and that was the great that that
[21:25] Eve only fell on One Promise how many
[21:27] knows that only fa on one promise and
[21:30] that promise was that God would keep his
[21:31] word and when and when he was anointed
[21:34] with it watch now amen the prophet says
[21:36] see anything of course that's a seed of
[21:38] discrepancy is something that's contrary
[21:40] to the word of God so so now we see hear
[21:44] things today that's contrary to the word
[21:46] and we don't want to call it the devil
[21:47] but really that's what it is it's the
[21:49] seed of the devil it's a word that is
[21:51] spoken that is contrary to the word of
[21:54] God and it's the days of Miracles it's
[21:56] pass see that's the seed of discrepancy
[21:59] when a man stands a minister a pastor of
[22:01] a church somewhere and they do not
[22:03] believe that Jesus Christ is the same in
[22:05] every detail except the physical body
[22:08] he's the same yesterday today and
[22:10] forever that's the seed of discrepancy
[22:13] when he says that miracles in the
[22:15] apostolic age has passed that's the seed
[22:18] of discrepancy when they say there's no
[22:20] such thing as Divine Healing that's the
[22:23] seed of discrepancy and the world is
[22:26] full of it and it crows out and chokes
[22:30] down the weed have you ever felt choked
[22:33] down have you ever heard have you ever
[22:35] been in conversations that choke you
[22:37] down you know what I'm talking about
[22:39] amen you're on fire for God it's like
[22:41] somebody's trying to take a wet blanket
[22:43] and just choke down what you really
[22:44] believe about the power of the Living
[22:46] God let me tell you what it is it's the
[22:48] seed of discrepancy it's the devil amen
[22:52] and the world is full of it and it tries
[22:54] to choke down the weed brother R said
[22:56] now listen if you don't think that this
[22:58] Spirit ain't still alive now here's the
[23:00] audacity can you imagine The Audacity Of
[23:02] This Spirit it went to Brother brandham
[23:04] ministers went to William brandham can
[23:06] you imagine and they said I want to
[23:08] straighten you out on something when we
[23:10] get a chance and brother brand says this
[23:12] is the best chance I know come on over
[23:14] now amen and he said well Mr brandom
[23:17] you're trying to say I believe you're
[23:19] sincere and honest but you're trying to
[23:21] introduce the world to an Apostolic
[23:23] Doctrine he said and the apostolic age
[23:26] ceased with the apostles brother AB brah
[23:28] said the first thing I'd like to know
[23:30] brother is do you believe the word of
[23:31] God is inspired he said yes sir I
[23:34] certainly do he said then when you show
[23:36] me that in the word where the apostolic
[23:39] age
[23:40] ceased and if you can show me where that
[23:43] is I'll believe it with you amen I'll
[23:46] believe it with you but he couldn't show
[23:48] it to him in the word because it had
[23:50] never ceased and the apostolic age will
[23:53] never cease as long as God is calling
[23:55] people he is still healing and saving
[23:58] and delivering and filling them with the
[24:00] Holy Ghost brother B said it like this
[24:02] we can still preach Divine Healing and
[24:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we can
[24:07] still have the power of God to separate
[24:10] us from the things of the world this
[24:12] Apostolic age has never ceased and it
[24:14] never will it's going to go on and I
[24:17] love how brother Brown comes along
[24:19] behind it and he says see though
[24:21] Scholars may tell you the apostolic age
[24:23] is over don't you believe it amen don't
[24:27] you believe it amen and three Witnesses
[24:29] brother BR said but here's the thing the
[24:31] Antichrist spirit is not a communistic
[24:34] spirit the Antichrist spirit is a
[24:36] religious spirit amen and brother Ram
[24:39] said he had delivered himself so can you
[24:41] imagine brother Ram held a whole meeting
[24:43] in three Witnesses in near Pennsylvania
[24:45] to say that the communistic spirit was
[24:48] not the Antichrist the Antichrist was
[24:50] religious amen because people didn't
[24:52] know that in that day amen and we don't
[24:55] need to forget that now amen that the
[24:57] Antichrist spirit is not a communistic
[24:59] spirit it is a religious spirit and the
[25:02] worst devil there is the worst demon
[25:05] there is amen the one that killed Jesus
[25:08] was a religious party and they want to
[25:11] say it was the devil that killed him so
[25:13] amen we want to watch that going to
[25:15] church and being religious has nothing
[25:17] to do with the Born Again of the Holy
[25:20] Ghost and become a Christian it's a
[25:22] different thing so going to church and
[25:24] being religious has nothing to do with a
[25:27] born again experience of almighty God
[25:29] let me say something to you tonight amen
[25:31] I know that Christians go to church but
[25:33] church has never saved nobody I know
[25:36] Christians go to church but church has
[25:38] never healed nobody but it's the power
[25:41] of the holy ghost that comes into a
[25:43] church by a divine revelation that fills
[25:46] Hearts amen and I tell you today the
[25:49] prophet of God was inditing this
[25:50] generation he was not inditing the
[25:52] sinner go read it he said I'm not
[25:55] inditing that sinner out there I'm divid
[25:57] I'm in inditing the pull pits for the
[26:00] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ they
[26:02] did not Cru his physical body They
[26:05] Crucified the effects of the word as it
[26:08] was being preached the Antichrist spirit
[26:10] is not a communistic spirit it is a
[26:13] religious spirit and the worst demon I
[26:16] know of is a religious spirit amen
[26:20] somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I
[26:22] I know some fundamental preachers well
[26:24] brother BR said they can be fundamental
[26:26] he said and they preach all the fund
[26:28] fals of the scripture but they deny the
[26:30] power thereof the power of what the
[26:33] power of the Gospel preach the gospel
[26:36] but deny the power of it can you imagine
[26:39] it's a l to see and worship Church what
[26:41] is it it's a worship that's beautiful
[26:43] and formal but cold and dead it's
[26:46] culture and education have taken the
[26:49] place of a spirit-given word isn't that
[26:52] something the world we're living in it's
[26:54] got a beautiful worship it's got a me a
[26:57] religiosity amen great intellectual
[26:59] preachers but it's cold and it's dead
[27:02] and they have let education take the
[27:04] place of a spirit filled word well I
[27:07] don't know about you tonight but I'm not
[27:09] going to give no place to the devil amen
[27:11] education will never take the place of a
[27:14] Spirit-filled word education will never
[27:17] take the place of a holy ghost filled
[27:19] Church of a living God Amen I'll tell
[27:22] you just good theology coming into the
[27:24] church will never take the place of what
[27:27] it means for the Holy Ghost to get a
[27:29] hold of a preacher and begin to discern
[27:31] hearts and speak lives in the lives and
[27:34] amen Minister back forth I I stopped on
[27:36] the way up from uh from the camp and
[27:39] talked with Brother David and sister
[27:40] Faith had lunch with them on Tuesday and
[27:42] they were going on and on about the
[27:44] service here Sunday Amen on and on she
[27:46] said they were telling me said well
[27:47] brother Wayne said Brother Ray done such
[27:49] a wonderful job said but come app point
[27:51] in the service when the Holy Spirit just
[27:52] took him over and he started ministering
[27:54] right to needs he said got right in the
[27:56] car with some of the kids were coming up
[27:58] and the discussions they were having and
[28:00] the Holy Spirit begin to listen folks
[28:02] education will never replace that
[28:05] education will never get that amen it'll
[28:07] take a Spirit-filled man speaking a
[28:10] Spirit-filled word that's what this
[28:12] generation needs it's got colleges it's
[28:15] got education it's got formality but
[28:18] what this age needs is a real God that's
[28:21] alive and he meets us on Sunday mornings
[28:24] it's it's not just come together to
[28:26] shake hands and fellowship and hear an
[28:29] intellectual teaching oh B we want to
[28:31] see the Lord Jesus amen as he begins to
[28:33] move through the congregation and he
[28:35] speaks personally to the needs and the
[28:38] lives and and somebody might get the
[28:40] Holy Ghost in the middle of the
[28:42] preaching amen somebody might receive
[28:44] healing in the middle of the preaching
[28:46] we need a spiritual atmosphere with a
[28:49] spiritual touch of the power of God we
[28:52] got no place for the devil here in True
[28:54] Word Tabernacle his powerless and formal
[28:58] worship has no place in this
[29:01] church no place for the devil no place
[29:04] for theology no place for education I
[29:07] say God feel every fiber feel every
[29:10] every element of this
[29:13] room well somebody shout hallelujah
[29:17] hallelujah glory be to God the power of
[29:19] the Gospel I believe it amen the Moab
[29:23] worship was was fundamental but it was
[29:25] powerless seven altars seven Rams oh but
[29:29] they didn't have that Pillar of Fire but
[29:31] there Moses was up there on the mountain
[29:34] Oh my he had fundamentalism too but it
[29:38] was backed by the power of God now a
[29:40] true revelation of the two spirits that
[29:42] work within the church Amen brother Bram
[29:46] said If by God's spirit we're able to
[29:48] discern and withstand that Antichrist
[29:51] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[29:55] her isn't that powerful if you can
[29:58] discern the Antichrist Spirit it is
[30:00] powerless before you in other words that
[30:02] if you're able to see it and discern it
[30:05] it exposes it so it has no power over
[30:08] you somebody says to you well don't you
[30:11] y'all don't worship like that but see if
[30:12] you know that's the devil talking to you
[30:14] you go I don't have to listen to you
[30:17] you're not my dad you're not my mom you
[30:20] ever seen a little kid they and another
[30:22] little kid tell them what to do amen
[30:24] they say it with authority and another
[30:26] little kid looks say he not my mama
[30:30] cuzz they know that kid has no authority
[30:32] over them well this Antichrist teaching
[30:35] has zero authority over the bride of
[30:38] Christ not our
[30:39] Daddy has nothing to do with us now this
[30:43] is the time of discernment you got to
[30:45] have discernment in this age you got to
[30:47] discern in this age amen you got to have
[30:49] strong meat belonging to them that are
[30:51] full age that they might exercise the
[30:53] ability to discern between an antichrist
[30:56] and the spirit of Christ you said
[30:58] preacher how do you discern I'll tell
[30:59] you brother Ram gave us a key now a key
[31:02] is powerful because you have the key it
[31:04] fits in all the different locks and
[31:06] brother Ram gave us a key of discerning
[31:08] Spirits you know what he gave us the key
[31:09] of he said the way I was able to lay out
[31:12] the church ages and the messenger of the
[31:14] ages he says it's because Jesus Christ
[31:17] never changes he is the same yesterday
[31:21] today and forever and his nature never
[31:23] changes he said so I was able to see him
[31:27] in every age
[31:28] and he was able to lay out so that's why
[31:31] that you can discern the spirit of
[31:33] Christ brother Braham said well somebody
[31:34] said well brother Wayne I don't know if
[31:36] preachers are to have discernment do you
[31:37] know brother Bram said if you're a
[31:38] Christian you'll be able to discern if
[31:40] somebody's a Christian within just a few
[31:43] minutes that's right amen if if you're
[31:46] now the problem I have is that
[31:47] discernment sometimes tells me what I'm
[31:49] dealing with and the person don't want
[31:51] to everybody to know that so then they
[31:52] get mad at me but but the spirit of
[31:55] Christ discerns by the word of God you
[31:58] know something is of God or something's
[32:00] not of God right now the Bible says in 1
[32:04] John chapter 4 beloved believe not every
[32:07] Spirit but try the spirit whether they
[32:10] are of God because many false prophets
[32:13] are going out into this world try the
[32:16] spirit Revelation 2 and2 it said thou
[32:18] Hast tried them which say they are
[32:20] Apostles and they are not and has found
[32:22] them Liars now in the Ephesian Church
[32:25] age brother Bram said it's not really
[32:26] you that tries the Apostle and the
[32:29] prophet and the teacher it's the word
[32:32] that tries them amen it's the word y'all
[32:35] yall y'all had to forgive me but I've
[32:36] I've had my I've had my share of uh of
[32:39] matches throughout 25 years of traveling
[32:42] amen and one thing I found out is a
[32:44] false teacher or a false preacher does
[32:46] not like
[32:48] questions you want to make a false
[32:50] preacher mad at you ask him a question
[32:51] about his theology man he'll get mad and
[32:54] get mad and fly off the handle at you
[32:56] every time because you're question is a
[32:58] challenge and and what's bad is in my
[33:00] early age I was so innocent I was really
[33:02] asking because I'd heard brother BR say
[33:04] something and he had taught something
[33:06] then I heard somebody say something and
[33:07] I'd be like but brother Bram said that
[33:09] why you teach that and I was just
[33:11] innocent in my questions but I found out
[33:13] that they was not well received at all
[33:16] amen because you see what it is is that
[33:19] it that God gives us the word to try
[33:21] Spirits amen that's what we see in John
[33:24] CH 4 and: 2 the Bible said hereby know
[33:28] ye the spirit of God every spirit that
[33:31] confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
[33:34] the flesh is of God now watch not that
[33:37] he has come but that he is come now
[33:40] there's a lot of difference in that
[33:42] because there's a lot of people believe
[33:44] in a 2,000 year old Jesus and they
[33:46] believe in Jesus back then if you try to
[33:48] tell them about current Revelation
[33:50] they'll say I don't know nothing but
[33:52] Jesus and him crucified but see he
[33:54] raised up on the third day amen and
[33:57] Jesus Jesus is come in the flesh today
[34:00] and Jesus today is the Holy Ghost he's
[34:04] not the Holy Ghost is not an emotion as
[34:06] some has made it it's not tongues as
[34:08] some has made it it's not a Doctrine as
[34:11] some has made it amen the Holy Ghost is
[34:13] a person it is the person of almighty
[34:16] God and it has come in this day to
[34:19] manifest himself in the form of a bride
[34:22] this is the bride coming of Christ she
[34:26] is Anointed with the spirit of truth and
[34:28] the continuation of the book of Acts now
[34:31] I tell you what in this age we're going
[34:33] to have to do is discern withstand and
[34:35] overcome that devil and you said brother
[34:37] Wayne overcome yes the Bible tells us
[34:39] that we will overcome in this age but to
[34:42] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[34:45] every one of his tricks now watch lots
[34:47] of people say there is no devil that
[34:50] it's just a thought and don't you
[34:51] believe that there is a real devil he's
[34:54] just as real as you are or anybody a
[34:57] real Dev devil and you must recognize
[34:59] him real you must know he's a devil but
[35:02] at the same time you recognize him
[35:05] you've got to know he's a devil he's
[35:07] against you but to overcome that you've
[35:10] got to recognize that greater and
[35:12] mightier is he that is in one of who has
[35:15] already overcome him and by his grace
[35:18] you're more than a match to him that's
[35:20] real overcoming when you recognize
[35:22] there's a real devil listen that's not
[35:24] just a bad mood you're in it's a devil
[35:27] that's not not just anxiety it's a devil
[35:30] it's not just sickness it's a devil come
[35:32] on it's not just jealousy it's a devil
[35:35] it's not just malice or Strife or Envy
[35:38] it's a devil and a devil has nothing to
[35:41] do with the bride of Jesus Christ it's a
[35:45] devil and it's time to call it a devil
[35:47] come on you ain't going to talk it you
[35:49] ain't going to talk no devil out of
[35:50] somebody amen it'll have to be the word
[35:52] of God that brings it out of listen let
[35:54] me just say it like I believe it I don't
[35:56] believe you can educate at a devil out
[35:58] of
[35:59] somebody I don't believe you can
[36:01] theologize a devil
[36:04] out that's not a word but I made it up
[36:07] it's it's a fitting word right now but
[36:09] you got to recognize the devil that he's
[36:11] real that Devil he's a real devil and
[36:14] listen that Devil's really after you
[36:17] he's really wanting to destroy you he he
[36:19] is a thief he's a robber right amen he's
[36:23] a murderer he's a liar from the
[36:25] beginning he if he comes the only kills
[36:28] comes to steal kill and Rob amen but
[36:30] what he's looking for is a door to get
[36:33] in that's all he's looking for is a door
[36:35] to get in and you've got to realize that
[36:37] he's real and then you got to stand up
[36:39] against him well I'll tell you if you
[36:41] got Christ in you you're more than a
[36:44] match for the
[36:45] devil that's right you're more than a
[36:47] match from that devil to withstand means
[36:50] to stand up against to oppose with a
[36:53] firm determination to resist
[36:56] successfully amen it means to be proof
[36:59] against resist the effect or W with
[37:01] withand the impact of something to stop
[37:05] or to obstruct the course of something
[37:08] it means resisting the devil it means
[37:11] amen it means to obstruct the course
[37:14] that Satan would take watch when we find
[37:17] out this I I found out in James chapter
[37:20] 4 it's a beautiful scripture and James
[37:22] says it like this submit yourselves
[37:24] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[37:27] will flee from you but listen most
[37:29] people get in that and all they start
[37:31] with is resist the devil well that's
[37:33] real good but if you get the first part
[37:35] right then you can resist the devil
[37:37] because the first of it says submit
[37:39] yourself therefore to God Amen do you
[37:41] know the Bible teaches us that pride
[37:43] comes just before the fall and and the
[37:46] Bible even tells us that God resisteth
[37:49] the proud and give grace to the humble
[37:51] so if you want to find something
[37:53] powerful in your life you've got to find
[37:56] an ability to humble yourself or to
[37:59] submit yourself to God watch where we
[38:01] started it's not what I did it's what I
[38:04] surrendered myself to and as the Church
[38:06] of the Living God becomes a when you
[38:09] become aware that the immortal God is in
[38:12] the room that if we begin to submit
[38:14] ourselves amen then we're able to resist
[38:17] the devil because there's something in
[38:19] us that can do the resisting if we can
[38:22] resist him we can withstand him we can
[38:25] oppose him I love it amen man we can
[38:28] protest everything that he's doing now
[38:30] Satan will be powerless before us if we
[38:33] can understand him withstand him and
[38:36] resist him he can become powerless isn't
[38:38] it be wouldn't it be something if Satan
[38:40] was completely powerless in your home in
[38:43] your life in your church in your
[38:45] experience you said preacher it's not
[38:47] possible it is
[38:49] possible brother bam said you can
[38:51] withstand this Spirit if you can discern
[38:53] and this Antichrist Spirit withstand it
[38:56] that Satan will be power powerless
[38:57] before her now if you want to take it to
[39:00] the scripture brother brandom uses this
[39:03] portion of scripture in the back of the
[39:05] Book of Matthew the 8th chapter and the
[39:07] 29th verse it's when Jesus is crossing
[39:10] the Seas and he's going to the tombs of
[39:12] the gardian and Jesus is going just for
[39:15] a oneman Revival now I tell you wherever
[39:18] the word goes there's going to be
[39:21] Revival now the Bible tells us that he
[39:23] went to a graveyard I I tell you I like
[39:26] to type it a bit like leosia amen that
[39:29] it was a person that was full of devils
[39:31] as leosia has been filled with Devils
[39:35] amen and they were bound a lunatic
[39:37] spirit and it was crazy man now now now
[39:40] now you got to know brother Brandon said
[39:42] the way this man got in this shape amen
[39:44] is that he lied about something and
[39:47] Spirits began to gather one to the other
[39:49] until he became in this kind of
[39:51] condition amen and when Jesus went to
[39:53] him the Bible tells us that the man come
[39:56] out to meet Jesus you know the story
[39:58] brother bam said he come out and he was
[39:59] going to he was going to thought he was
[40:01] going to destroy Jesus till he realized
[40:03] that the one that threw him out of
[40:04] Heaven standing in this man and when he
[40:07] begin to realize it you know what he
[40:09] done he begin to worship and begin to
[40:11] beseech the Lord and the 31st verse the
[40:14] Bible said the Devils besought him and
[40:17] and and if thou cast us out suffer us to
[40:23] go into that herd of swine yeah now
[40:26] listen God does not possess animal
[40:29] Souls animals don't have a soul that God
[40:32] can get in them but demons possess
[40:36] animals remember the first serpent in
[40:39] the Bible a demon possessed that man he
[40:42] got into his Spirit and the Bible tells
[40:43] us here that the devil saw that he was
[40:47] going to be without a body now brother
[40:49] Brandon will teach us a very powerful
[40:50] lesson he said if the devil is without a
[40:53] body he's powerless a devil floating
[40:56] around here is powerless he can scratch
[40:59] at the door he can beat on your heart he
[41:02] can try his best to speak to you but
[41:05] until you open the door he is powerless
[41:10] amen I tell you what this devil do y'all
[41:12] know the devil knows amen that the
[41:14] Millennium is coming and he knew that
[41:16] Jesus was the king of the Millennium and
[41:18] and as he was speaking to him he
[41:20] actually asked the Lord he said why
[41:21] tormented me before my time and he knew
[41:24] the Lord was about to remove him from
[41:27] his his Temple where he was exercising
[41:30] his power but he asked a favor said Lord
[41:33] won't you put me in these swine Lord let
[41:36] me go into the swine because he needed a
[41:40] tabernacle to go into you see the Devil
[41:44] is a spirit and if you talk about demons
[41:47] they're real now but demons are Fallen
[41:49] Angels they are the spirits that
[41:52] influence people amen and they need a
[41:55] tabernacle they need someone to get into
[41:58] they don't speak unless they can use
[42:00] your voice and and they don't hurt
[42:02] unless they can use your hands and they
[42:03] don't they're not able to do things
[42:05] unless they can get into a human body
[42:08] but these demons ask permission of the
[42:10] Lord that they might be able to get into
[42:12] the body of these swine now here's the
[42:14] thing a great lesson you might have want
[42:15] to learn about the devil right now is
[42:17] the Devil is a cruel Master yeah the
[42:20] devil's a cruel master and he destroys
[42:23] the temple that is given to him isn't it
[42:26] something amen that he immediately
[42:28] destroyed the life of those swine amen
[42:31] they ran off and killed themselves now I
[42:33] want you to say something realize
[42:34] something right now the demons that was
[42:36] in those those Hogs are still alive
[42:39] today and those demons are still here
[42:42] today that's why people say when you got
[42:44] this Holy Ghost religion you lost your
[42:46] mind brother B said no it's when you
[42:49] first time you was ever in your right
[42:50] mind he said because that man was crazy
[42:54] but the Bible says when he come to the
[42:56] feet of Jesus Jesus he was clothed and
[42:59] in his right mind amen and I'll tell you
[43:01] this if you ever get in contact with
[43:03] Jesus amen he'll put the right kind of
[43:06] clothes on you and he'll bring you back
[43:08] to your right mind that you might be
[43:10] able to worship God I tell you friends I
[43:13] believe tonight demons are powerless
[43:15] unless they're embodied so They begged
[43:17] with Mercy to go in there that Jesus
[43:20] would permit them a swine body because
[43:22] he wouldn't permit them a human body
[43:25] isn't that amazing Jesus wouldn't let
[43:28] him go get another human so they had to
[43:30] go get in a hog now watch that's why
[43:34] Paul is saying don't give place to the
[43:38] devil he had to ask permission of the
[43:40] Lord to go in there he had to ask the
[43:43] Lord let us go into this wine because
[43:46] Jesus had supreme authority over what
[43:49] the devil could possess and what he
[43:51] can't possess let me say something to
[43:53] you tonight deity is not in heaven that
[43:55] same Jesus is in the Church of the
[43:58] Living God every person in here that has
[44:01] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:03] he's in your body tonight and that
[44:05] whether you know it or not you have
[44:07] authority over where that devil goes and
[44:11] where he don't go you are not a weak
[44:13] powerless church but you are the Blood
[44:15] Bought Sons and Daughters of God with
[44:18] supreme authority and you've got a right
[44:20] to share the Dominion of Christ tonight
[44:22] to tell him where to go and where not to
[44:26] go
[44:27] and you might not have realized who you
[44:29] really are but if you could ever really
[44:30] see it Satan would become powerless
[44:32] before you tonight because you have a
[44:34] right to tell him to leave I think it's
[44:37] a powerful thing amen when you begin to
[44:39] see when you begin to see that that
[44:42] great logos in Jesus just said to the
[44:44] devil go and he went and that same logos
[44:48] that same Pillar of Fire is embodied in
[44:50] The Believer tonight as the baptism of
[44:52] the Holy Ghost and has authority over
[44:55] the devil and tells him where he can go
[44:58] that's why Paul would instruct you now
[45:00] watch what Paul's doing he's just went
[45:02] through being renewed in the new man
[45:04] he's just told you to be transformed in
[45:07] the new man and now he says don't give
[45:09] place to the devil now he's instructing
[45:11] you as a child of God don't you open the
[45:15] door to the devil because don't you give
[45:18] this devil power I love how he says it
[45:21] neither give place to the devil neither
[45:24] give in other words the devil can't take
[45:26] it you're going to have to give it do
[45:28] you know if the devil is in your life
[45:30] tonight it's because you've given him
[45:32] ground do you know that you had to give
[45:34] up some place you had to open some door
[45:37] to let that devil in you say brother
[45:39] Wayne Amen I didn't open the door
[45:41] unknowingly maybe you did maybe you gave
[45:44] some part maybe you got upset at some
[45:46] person now now I just have to preach the
[45:48] way I see things but I I'll have to say
[45:50] this now Caleb sitting here he he grew
[45:53] up in Arkansas too and he remembers want
[45:55] Ridge Arkansas down me and my own POA
[45:57] house and they got a uh uh they got a a
[45:59] fan sitting outside the door in the
[46:01] summer and it blows and you think crazy
[46:03] people got fans outside but but what it
[46:05] is is the mosquitoes are so bad there in
[46:07] that rice country that you could just
[46:09] wipe them off your I mean they're just
[46:11] horrid aren't they you take a breath and
[46:13] they just come in your mouth they're
[46:14] just mosquitoes are horrible amen and
[46:16] and I remember as long back as I got
[46:19] memory coming in in the summer night and
[46:21] hear my old Granddad or my dad or one of
[46:23] them holler shut the door boy yeah amen
[46:27] I thought my name was shut the
[46:30] door shut the door shut the door shut
[46:33] the door mystery behind it car we didn't
[46:35] have no air conditioners back in those
[46:37] days we had an old attic fan and our
[46:39] screens usually had two or three holes
[46:41] in them and amen and you know amen you
[46:43] had to leave that on it got so hot
[46:44] Nathan you couldn't cover up with a
[46:46] sheet amen but it was but but if the
[46:48] mosquitoes got in there you just have to
[46:50] lay there and sweat cuz you couldn't
[46:52] sleep without a sheet on so so but it
[46:54] didn't matter who you let in that door
[46:57] it didn't matter what reason you open
[46:58] the door it didn't matter amen what
[47:00] person was knocking and asking to come
[47:02] in amen I remember telling old my dad
[47:05] many times my grandpa many times well
[47:06] I'm doing so so they said I don't care
[47:08] shut the
[47:10] door because it wasn't what you were
[47:12] doing or not doing it's what you were
[47:14] letting in and you see many times in the
[47:17] Christian church we have forgotten that
[47:20] we have control of the door come on now
[47:24] come on Church y'all know I'm telling
[47:26] you the truth some of our entertainment
[47:28] is opened the door to a lot of anxiety
[47:31] in people's lives sometimes the movie
[47:33] theaters have caused more trouble amen
[47:36] because it's opened the door to certain
[47:38] spirits and certain situations and we're
[47:41] not legalist here I'm not talking about
[47:43] something legal I'm talking about
[47:45] overcoming lives I'm talking about
[47:47] sometimes you're fighting things that
[47:49] you have invited In Yourself by the type
[47:52] of music you've allowed on the radio by
[47:55] the type of magazine that you read by
[47:58] the type of moments books that you've
[48:00] looked
[48:01] at y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[48:04] I feel like a preacher right now amen
[48:06] you know many marriages have suffered
[48:09] because a sister has read some romance
[48:11] book and she's got an idea of what this
[48:14] perfect man is well let me tell you what
[48:16] a perfect man is he's a Son of God that
[48:19] works for a living loves his family he
[48:21] might have to be gone 12 hours a day and
[48:24] come in with dirt under his fingernails
[48:26] and he might not always be Mr prissy or
[48:29] in the best mood come on church but he's
[48:31] a man of God and he brings his family to
[48:33] church and he stands with his family
[48:36] that's the kind of man you want not some
[48:39] fell riding the White Horse and he never
[48:41] had a bad day and every everyday's roses
[48:44] and everyday's this that's a bunch of
[48:46] fantasy nonsense that has ruined many
[48:50] marriages well go ahead and preach
[48:52] preacher I think I will amen come on now
[48:55] now boy boy boy amen I think the Holy
[48:58] Ghost done showed up tonight I think
[49:00] it's time to shut the door to many of
[49:02] those situations amen and cut that devil
[49:05] out of your mind and out of your
[49:08] relationships come on now you know what
[49:10] I'm talking about that's the same thing
[49:12] some of you boys looking at them women
[49:14] and you see that bikini and you that
[49:15] Brass Body you looking at all that amen
[49:18] that woman never gave birth to your
[49:19] children she's never labored with your
[49:21] family amen if you ask her to stay home
[49:24] and clean your house she'd leave you the
[49:26] first
[49:29] day well we might as well preach Ain we
[49:32] amen that's why the Bible said husbands
[49:34] be not bitter toward your wives but love
[49:37] them that's why I said sister don't hold
[49:40] your body from your husband and close
[49:43] the door don't give a place to the
[49:46] devil don't you let your husband's Minds
[49:49] R around some Jezabel somewhere amen be

[49:59] preach like this a while Hallelujah I
[50:01] don't think we ought to give the devil a
[50:02] place tonight I think we are to shut the
[50:05] door in the face of the devil and tell
[50:07] him you're just not welcome in the house
[50:09] of
[50:10] God I believe it
[50:13] church I don't believe we are to give
[50:15] him no opportunity we are not give him
[50:16] no room now now I know that we've nearly
[50:19] made a law out of it and I don't think
[50:20] it ought to be a law cuz it ain't right
[50:22] but that's the reason we have our boys
[50:25] chaperoned with our young girls
[50:27] that's the reason these young kids don't
[50:28] get out and run around the car together
[50:31] amen or married men and and married
[50:33] women that ain't married together that's
[50:35] the reason they don't get out and run in
[50:36] cars and sit and talk and and look at
[50:39] one another in eyes you ever see it amen
[50:41] they just sit and talk and they bat
[50:42] their eyes and look at one another and
[50:44] eyes listen sister you got no right
[50:46] looking in the eyes of a married man
[50:47] like that amen that's her that's that's

[50:52] little look you got belongs to your
[50:54] husband I'm going to preach amen amen I
[50:57] tell you this it belongs to your husband
[50:58] you ought to shut the door on that thing

[51:03] am a loyal
[51:07] woman that's what I believe I believe
[51:09] that my daughters I taught them cover
[51:11] yourself
[51:12] up your body is a sacred thing and it
[51:16] belongs to one man and one man
[51:20] only that's the truth sister you know
[51:22] it's the truth amen I I tell you I'm
[51:25] going amen myself tonight that's just
[51:27] good preaching right
[51:28] [Applause]
[51:29] there you know it's right amen you see
[51:32] but you give place to the devil when you
[51:35] start doing that when you start when you
[51:37] start having those personal
[51:39] relationships I don't know what I'm
[51:40] doing here but when you start having
[51:42] them personal relationships with with
[51:44] you know you take they call them work
[51:45] wives now and and they call them uh work
[51:48] husbands now that maybe they don't have
[51:50] a physical relationship but it becomes
[51:52] so emotional and they begin emotional
[51:54] relationships one with the other and
[51:56] until they mistreat their own spouses
[51:59] wishing they was like some other man or
[52:01] like some other woman well let me tell
[52:02] you this I married the woman I liked and
[52:05] I still like her and I still love her

[52:42] magazine they're real flesh and blood
[52:45] and that's why you pray for them you
[52:46] know it's well I'll tell you what my
[52:48] husband he's in he's done that and he's
[52:51] and I'm just going to leave him man I
[52:53] remember when I read those Mals it said
[52:55] to death do we park through sickness and
[52:58] health through riches or poor that's why
[53:00] you put them things in that Val that's
[53:03] why you put them in there cuz hard times
[53:05] are going to come but amen this is not a
[53:08] 50/50 it's a 100 100 if you don't give a
[53:11] hundred and he gives a 100 you ain't
[53:13] going to make
[53:14] it it's 100% me and 100% her through
[53:18] riches and parts good thing we put that
[53:20] in there cuz she'd have left me for
[53:23] sure after that 14th house and we drove
[53:26] hey y'all come on now you see that nice
[53:28] car we got today somebody give to us but
[53:30] but y'all see that nice car come on now
[53:32] heyen that was a $650 car a few years
[53:35] ago with a a hood spray painted that
[53:37] girl got up and sat right next to me no
[53:39] air conditioner swept dripping and she
[53:41] was just happy to go with
[53:44] me it didn't take a fancy car look and
[53:47] and if they're looking for a fancy car
[53:49] young brother if they're looking for
[53:50] some kind of money before they ready hey
[53:52] forget it wrong kind of woman you want
[53:55] somebody got some character amen because
[53:58] physical traits
[54:01] change but you want character somebody
[54:04] that will love you and stay with you a
[54:06] good woman's a crown in a man's hair
[54:09] amen but a bad woman the Bible said was
[54:11] water in his
[54:13] blood I don't believe we ought to give
[54:15] place to the devil I believe we ought to
[54:17] I believe we ought to take our place
[54:18] amen not give him room or license not
[54:21] give that devil an opportunity or a set
[54:24] of circumstances
[54:27] that now I'm just reading what it means
[54:29] opportunity or set of circumstances a
[54:31] situation or condition favorable to a
[54:34] goal or a position or Prospect the
[54:36] advancement of success so so Satan wants
[54:39] an advancement in your life he wants to
[54:42] be
[54:43] successful yeah but you're going to have
[54:44] to give him the place to do it isn't
[54:47] that something
[54:49] yeah when you start thinking about it
[54:51] like that it'll make you shut some
[54:53] things off it'll make you shut the door
[54:56] on certain thoughts and certain feelings
[54:58] and and you know because Satan actually
[55:00] gets his success the way he does it is
[55:03] he explains the value of God's word
[55:06] away that's the way Satan gets success
[55:09] do you see what you have to do now
[55:11] remember Devils don't
[55:13] die amen but one day they will be
[55:17] totally
[55:18] annihilated but today they're working
[55:20] from generation to generation in human
[55:22] being some of them's in the form of
[55:23] cancer some of them's in the form of
[55:25] epileps
[55:27] some of them is in the form of
[55:28] tuberculosis they get into the flesh but
[55:30] seemingly they are powerless until they
[55:32] get into a
[55:34] person they have to operate through a
[55:36] person which brings another thought that
[55:38] the Holy Spirit covers the earth but is
[55:42] helpless until it gets into you and me
[55:46] God is depending on you and I the Holy
[55:48] Spirit the Earth is full of the spirit
[55:51] of God it's been poured out but it
[55:53] cannot operate until it comes into human
[55:56] beings isn't that something amen that
[55:59] that you can bind God that's what the
[56:02] Bible brother bram's talking about he
[56:03] said when they released the Demons of re
[56:06] Euphrates remember brother B said Here
[56:07] Comes Michael and his angels and Lucifer
[56:09] and his angels He said they're back at
[56:11] War again you remember him talking about
[56:13] it he said the Holy Spirit has been
[56:15] loosed out of Creeds and dogmas after
[56:17] 2,000 years what's it mean loosed he's
[56:20] always been here but the teachings and
[56:23] the theologies have been an insulate
[56:26] rather than a conductor of the spirit of
[56:29] God but with the return of the seventh
[56:32] angel would be a restoration of the word
[56:35] and it would be a word of power it would
[56:37] put the church back in Authority again
[56:40] you would know you're a Son of God you
[56:42] would know you're a daughter of God you
[56:44] would know the devil's the devil but
[56:46] greater is he that's in me than he
[56:48] that's in this
[56:50] world
[56:51] hallelujah
[56:53] hallelujah now I know the scripture
[56:56] tells us that old Devil's going to be
[56:58] bound A Thousand Years remember that
[57:00] song when the Lord Returns the Earth
[57:02] again Satan will be bound A Thousand
[57:04] Years amen I I love that idea a thousand
[57:08] years of bondage but brother Ram said
[57:10] you know what's going to bind him it's
[57:12] not a log chain he said it's a chain of
[57:17] circumstances now what does that mean he
[57:19] says all of his subjects will be in hell
[57:23] and that Resurrection on Earth redeemed
[57:26] Jesus will be them Satan has nothing to
[57:29] work with during the Millennium the
[57:32] reason it's the Millennium is there is
[57:34] nobody there that Satan can work
[57:37] through now that's powerful Satan is
[57:40] Bound for a thousand years the church
[57:42] that's on Earth in the presence of
[57:44] Christ has nothing he can work on so
[57:47] it's not a chain as in a log chain it's
[57:49] a chain of circumstance he has nothing
[57:52] he can do he's helpless and hopeless I
[57:55] love to think about the devil like that
[57:57] helpless and hopeless waiting for a
[57:59] resurrection of his subjects he has
[58:02] nothing to work through Revelation 20
[58:04] And1 I'll read the scripture for you and
[58:06] the angel come down from heaven having
[58:08] the key of the bottomless pit and a
[58:09] great chain in his hand and he laid hold
[58:12] on the dragon that serpent which is the
[58:14] devil and he bound him a thousand years
[58:18] that bondage of a thousand years now
[58:20] watch in Revelation 20 and5 it explains
[58:22] it and the rest of the Dead live not
[58:24] again until the thousand years were
[58:25] finished that is the first resurrection
[58:28] but blessed and holy somebody say
[58:30] blessed and holy blessed andly blessed
[58:33] and holy is he that have part in the
[58:36] first resurrection so the first

[59:18] let me say something to you tonight do
[59:20] you know it can become that way in your
[59:23] life
[59:24] now in Matthew 16 the Bible said Thou
[59:27] Art Peter and Upon This Rock I build my
[59:29] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[59:33] Prevail against it and I will give Thee
[59:35] the Keys of the Kingdom and whatsoever
[59:37] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[59:39] in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt
[59:41] loose on the Earth shall be loosed in
[59:43] heaven you have the power tonight to
[59:46] bind your enemy you have the power
[59:49] tonight to loose your enemy you can bind
[59:52] the devil and you can loose him whatever
[59:55] you bind in heaven shall on the Earth
[59:57] shall be bound up in heaven can you
[59:59] imagine tonight you've got a power to
[1:00:01] look at the Devil and say Satan I bind
[1:00:03] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:06] amen I tell you what you ought to do is
[1:00:08] make that nervous devil nervous tonight
[1:00:10] and say thou demon of neurotics that
[1:00:13] binds you by the power of the Living God
[1:00:16] you can't keep me quiet anymore I know
[1:00:18] I'm a Son of God I know I have authority
[1:00:21] over this devil Hallelujah we ought to
[1:00:25] not set quiet we've got an authority
[1:00:28] we've got a voice we've got a right to
[1:00:31] speak tonight and tell that devil I'm a
[1:00:34] full grown man I'm a full grown son of
[1:00:37] the Living God I've got a right to speak
[1:00:41] I know who I am I know my my authority
[1:00:43] is I know you're a devil I know you're
[1:00:46] illicit and
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:49] illegal that's right you know what it
[1:00:52] means to bind it means to put under
[1:00:54] obligation of the Lord
[1:00:56] to forbid or prohibit to declare
[1:00:59] something illicit in other words when
[1:01:01] the devil starts working in your life
[1:01:03] y'all want tell you I want to tell you
[1:01:04] something he's
[1:01:07] trespassing I don't have time to teach
[1:01:09] on it you can go look it up but when the
[1:01:11] Bible calls you Christ you know that's
[1:01:13] anointed right but if you spell Christ c
[1:01:15] h r i s TS Christ many many people right
[1:01:20] all right but if you put an apostrophe s
[1:01:23] there the apostrophe changes everything
[1:01:26] everything and it speaks of possession
[1:01:29] yeah and you are Christ with an
[1:01:32] apostrophe yes you belong to him he
[1:01:35] bought you paid for you you are his
[1:01:39] property and anything that comes on that
[1:01:42] property is elicit and Satan has no
[1:01:46] rights let me say something tonight he
[1:01:48] has no legal rights upon the Church of
[1:01:51] the Living God he is trespassing in your
[1:01:54] life he is trp passing listen we have a
[1:01:57] right tonight to take that old Serpent
[1:01:59] and bind him the same way the prophet
[1:02:01] was shown that he could bind that
[1:02:03] serpent or he can loose it amen as I was
[1:02:07] with Moses yeah so am I with you can you
[1:02:13] know that he's with you tonight in a
[1:02:15] binding power and in a loosing power
[1:02:18] that within your voice you have a right
[1:02:20] to bind Satan tonight amen the
[1:02:22] never-failing presence of God is with us
[1:02:25] then right now tonight the word of God
[1:02:27] will defeat Satan in whatever form he
[1:02:31] comes in it is written we'll settle it
[1:02:34] all amen you don't have to listen to the
[1:02:37] devil tonight we're actually taught to
[1:02:39] resist him we do not have Amen to do
[1:02:43] anything we can simply turn him down
[1:02:45] walk away God said a certain thing and
[1:02:48] no matter what he's telling you you do
[1:02:51] not have to listen to him yes
[1:02:54] sir that's right I tell you friends to
[1:02:57] think tonight to see that you do not
[1:03:00] have to listen to him let me tell you
[1:03:02] what the devil's doing he's got a tactic
[1:03:05] how many knows what the tactic means
[1:03:07] it's the approach it's the way he does
[1:03:09] things and the prophet of God taught us
[1:03:12] his tactic I'm glad we had a prophet
[1:03:13] aren't you he said a tactic is to get
[1:03:16] you to disbelieve the
[1:03:18] word that's his tactic and if he can get
[1:03:21] you to disbelieve he has disarmed you
[1:03:25] and he can take his place in your life
[1:03:28] now the prophet will tell us this he
[1:03:30] said when one little ioda of God's word
[1:03:33] is disbelieved that's where all trouble
[1:03:35] comes
[1:03:36] from but if you would set your basis
[1:03:40] upon God said so he said it sets a
[1:03:44] stream between you and God and every
[1:03:48] channel comes open between you and God
[1:03:52] when you say I don't believe the word it
[1:03:54] closes the channels of you and God when
[1:03:58] you take God at his word it opens every
[1:04:01] channel can you imagine every channel is
[1:04:04] opened every channel is open to the
[1:04:06] spirit of God brother Bram said that's
[1:04:08] what it is he said see the channels get
[1:04:10] all clogged
[1:04:12] up he said but we are to take and clear
[1:04:14] them out tonight he said and when you go
[1:04:16] to do that don't take some little 22 he
[1:04:18] said get the atomic bomb of God get
[1:04:22] God's atomic bomb I love it brother BR
[1:04:24] said it'll blow sickness and Devils
[1:04:26] right out left and right it'll
[1:04:29] annihilate them discriminate against
[1:04:31] them it'll destroy everything that's
[1:04:33] ungodly when that bomb of Faith drops in
[1:04:36] there with the word of God behind it it
[1:04:39] blows out every devil every sickness
[1:04:41] every disease look don't give a place
[1:04:43] for him tonight drop a bomb on him don't
[1:04:47] give a place to that devil tonight drop
[1:04:49] a bomb on that devil blow out the
[1:04:52] sickness blow out the disease blow out
[1:04:55] the trouble allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:04:57] move in there amen amen amen you said
[1:05:00] will preach to them why does it work for
[1:05:02] some and not for others brother B said
[1:05:03] it's the channel that's why it works so
[1:05:06] well for one person don't work so good
[1:05:08] for another it's because of the channel
[1:05:11] now watch this brother ramam says it
[1:05:14] clearly he said that's why when Eve
[1:05:17] stopped and talked to the devil look at
[1:05:20] everything that come out of that
[1:05:22] talk look at how long it lasts
[1:05:26] look at how much trouble come from it
[1:05:29] just because she stopped and had one
[1:05:32] conversation with the devil isn't that
[1:05:34] amazing amen just a few minutes with the
[1:05:37] devil reasoning the word of God could
[1:05:39] cause all the trouble we see do you see
[1:05:42] the tactic of the devil in your life
[1:05:45] amen just that little bit of reasoning
[1:05:47] amen I'm sick because God don't love me
[1:05:50] I'm sick because amen God's punishing me
[1:05:53] amen look what God don't love me God God
[1:05:55] don't care about me somebody will come
[1:05:57] along and say well this brother he hates
[1:05:59] me and this sister she don't think
[1:06:01] nothing about and when that begins to
[1:06:03] happen let me tell you what's going on
[1:06:05] you begin to reason against God's word
[1:06:07] and when you do Satan comes in like a
[1:06:10] flood because you're letting
[1:06:13] him you know that's why brother B said
[1:06:16] don't stop and talk to him now it's a
[1:06:18] little rude seemingly but the prophet
[1:06:21] said don't stop and talk don't stop and
[1:06:25] reason at
[1:06:28] all remember the scripture I ain't got
[1:06:30] time to preach it but I give you the
[1:06:32] scripture Gaza take this take this staff
[1:06:35] and go lay it on the boy now don't you
[1:06:38] stop if somebody says to you hello don't
[1:06:41] you say hello back if somebody says
[1:06:44] something to you you don't stop you
[1:06:45] don't talk you don't reason you don't do
[1:06:48] nothing you take the staff and put it on
[1:06:50] the child he was under the word of God
[1:06:54] to not give place to do anything or
[1:06:56] anybody to talk to him Church listen you
[1:06:59] have been given a commission of God to
[1:07:02] speak the word and go forward don't stop
[1:07:05] and talk about it don't stop and reason
[1:07:07] about it we've got the message of the
[1:07:09] hour we don't need a second opinion or
[1:07:13] another preacher we've got the word in
[1:07:15] this season so don't stop don't stop for
[1:07:18] nothing speak the word and go forward
[1:07:21] and keep moving in the presence of God
[1:07:24] you say preacher what are you talking
[1:07:26] about tonight I'm telling you this I'm
[1:07:28] telling you that it's a Time amen that
[1:07:31] you have to cut down whatever's in the
[1:07:34] way and move on to whatever God has
[1:07:37] promised
[1:07:42] you so brother Bram said God sent a
[1:07:44] preacher to a town to hold a Revival
[1:07:45] said he got there and started cleaning
[1:07:47] it up you remember the story he said the
[1:07:49] bully the town saw him over woring that
[1:07:51] wind and come and said what are you
[1:07:52] doing he said God sent me here to have
[1:07:54] Revival he said well you're going to
[1:07:55] have to whip
[1:07:57] me before we have Revival brother Bram
[1:08:00] said he told him said well soon as I get
[1:08:02] done with this wind you're the
[1:08:04] next and brother Bram said see he was
[1:08:06] willing to do whatever it took to
[1:08:08] fulfill the commission God had gave him
[1:08:10] so he climbed out off that ladder and
[1:08:12] gave the old boy a whipping stood him up
[1:08:14] dust him off invited him to church man
[1:08:16] come got
[1:08:20] saved come on yeah CU he was ready to do
[1:08:24] whatever it was because he wouldn't be
[1:08:28] stopped and when you start toward
[1:08:30] something with God there's going to come
[1:08:31] a
[1:08:32] reasoning you may have to whip that
[1:08:35] devil there's going to come a little
