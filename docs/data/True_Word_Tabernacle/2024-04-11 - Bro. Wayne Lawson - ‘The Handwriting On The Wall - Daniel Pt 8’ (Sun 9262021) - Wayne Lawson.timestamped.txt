[7:34] writing that was written many many
[7:38] tickle you Farson this is the writing
[7:42] that was written God bless you as you
[7:45] may be seated this
[7:47] morning uh I have just read something to
[7:51] you uh that was
[7:54] supernaturally
[7:56] written on the party halls of the palace
[7:59] of
[8:00] Babylon when it was coming to an
[8:04] end I want to this morning to speak to
[8:07] you a little bit from Daniel the 5th
[8:09] chapter and uh uh the subject would be
[8:13] the handwriting on the wall uh we have
[8:16] several places that we can pull from
[8:19] this morning uh because of the uh
[8:22] because of the message of the hour uh we
[8:25] have an absolute Authority on this
[8:28] subject and a able to look deeper into
[8:31] it than just the surface and uh we want
[8:34] to if we can just maybe to take a few
[8:36] minutes in the setting you that was here
[8:39] on Thursday night we talked a lot about
[8:42] uh Nebuchadnezzar and his time in the
[8:45] field and the lessons that was Learned
[8:47] was a learn was of humility and uh in
[8:50] Daniel the 5th chapter this is a time of
[8:54] the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar uh the
[8:56] rule has left and uh NE Nebuchadnezzar's
[9:00] son had actually ruled for a period of
[9:02] time but he had brought on his grandson
[9:04] Bel shazar who was uh Nebuchadnezzar's
[9:07] grandson they were actually ruling here
[9:09] together there actually was I believe
[9:11] there was two two leaders at this moment
[9:14] and uh but yet the the grandson had
[9:18] moved up a little closer in and it was
[9:20] actually become the king of of Babylon
[9:23] here in the Book of Daniel the 5th
[9:24] chapter you'll read a couple different
[9:26] places it'll call this boy the son of
[9:29] Nebuchadnezzar but it was actually his
[9:32] grandson uh and so but as you as you
[9:35] read here the setting of this scene a
[9:38] prophet will take us back here and he'll
[9:40] talk to us a little bit about the city
[9:42] of Babylon now we've been studying The
[9:43] Book of Daniel and we've been talking a
[9:45] lot about Babylon so I'll not go deep
[9:47] into that area of it but but but we do
[9:50] know that Babylon uh was a city that was
[9:53] built of course uh in that time it was a
[9:56] great scientific City it was the leading
[9:58] city of the World many things we have
[10:00] today actually come from Babylon it's
[10:02] even today uh like your 60 minutes in an
[10:06] hour 60 seconds in a minute and 24 hours
[10:08] all that came from Babylon there's
[10:10] several even the hieroglyphics some of
[10:12] the arithmetic a lot of them things
[10:14] actually come from those time period so
[10:15] they're very Advanced people and uh this
[10:18] this city of Babylon that uh that we're
[10:20] reading about this morning had is come
[10:23] to its Glory it's come to its Heights
[10:26] it's uh been a city so long that it has
[10:28] become secure within itself and within
[10:31] the borders of its walls it had a a
[10:34] tremendous Army great Army brother Bram
[10:36] said it had of course I think he was
[10:38] referring to America when he said it but
[10:40] he's talking about they had the greatest
[10:41] of armies even of Atomic Warfare and he
[10:44] was talking about the power of the Army
[10:47] in that time and he said Not only did
[10:49] they have a tremendous Army and had done
[10:52] had done amazing feats as far as being
[10:55] conquerors they had also at the same
[10:58] time built walls around around the city
[11:00] of Babylon uh brother Bram says it here
[11:02] he say it's amazing that they was some
[11:04] near 200 ft high and 80t thick uh the
[11:10] city's circular was about 120 mil so
[11:12] they had 120 miles of 200t high walls
[11:17] that were 80 foot thick he said they
[11:19] could run chariot races on the top of
[11:21] those walls they did have the gates in
[11:24] the city but the gates were actually
[11:26] brass so there wasn't wooden gates which
[11:28] was a great protection from fire
[11:30] whenever an army would attack of course
[11:33] the way they would attack was they would
[11:34] attack the gates and if there were
[11:36] wooden gates they just shoot them full
[11:37] of of fire and then burn the gates and
[11:39] break through and they they go on so
[11:41] these guys had stone walls and they had
[11:43] brass Gates and they were thick enough
[11:45] that they couldn't get through it high
[11:47] enough they couldn't climb over it and
[11:49] brother Bram said because they had
[11:51] gotten Behind These Walls he said they
[11:53] had began to get a great security and to
[11:57] believe that they were
[12:00] Untouchable and brother B says anytime
[12:02] man gets in the place where he builds
[12:04] security like this he said this is the
[12:07] point that sin begins to take over when
[12:10] men believe that God can't see them or
[12:12] that there would be no re recompense or
[12:15] no payment for the things that done he
[12:17] said that's When sin really begins to
[12:19] ramp up uh it normally does not produce
[12:23] a better place to live it produces a
[12:25] better place to sin and so whenever that
[12:28] they started doing this
[12:29] this this is a point that brother Rah is
[12:31] very strong on and by making this point
[12:34] he brings it up in handwriting on the
[12:36] wall and he did something back in the
[12:39] Matthew series if any of you remember
[12:40] back that far when we were dealing with
[12:42] Matthew 2 uh we we actually went into
[12:45] how that the Bible said and God had
[12:48] brought uh his son out of Israel and use
[12:51] that specific scripture to prove that
[12:53] God uses the scripture more than one
[12:56] time so sometimes we see people read a
[12:58] script scripture and they think well
[13:00] that's the end of that scripture
[13:01] whatever one time it was in the Old
[13:02] Testament or something but brother
[13:04] random uh actually brings the Bible to
[13:07] us and says that the Bible is not just
[13:09] like a letter that you wrote one of your
[13:11] friends he said like if I write you a
[13:13] letter it's good one time to that one
[13:15] person he said but the the the Bible is
[13:18] the inspired word of God he said so it's
[13:22] so powerful he says that its meanings
[13:25] and its scripture are manifold in other
[13:27] words it it will be used again and again
[13:30] because of the meaning in the case of
[13:31] Matthew 2 I bring thy son out of Egypt
[13:34] he said that was Jacob when Jacob come
[13:36] out of Egypt when Israel come out of
[13:38] Egypt but again it lived again when
[13:40] Jesus was brought out of Egypt in his
[13:42] day same scripture amen but it was used
[13:44] the same way of course again uh we know
[13:47] the scripture says that uh talking Jesus
[13:50] one day said you seek a sign but no sign
[13:52] given to a wicked and adulterous gener
[13:54] gration except the sign of Jonas of
[13:56] course that's a double scripture it's in
[13:58] the days of Jesus but brother B said he
[14:00] was speaking that day but really was
[14:02] meaning it for this day so when we look
[14:06] back in the scripture and we're reading
[14:07] Daniel chapter 5 brother Bram uses
[14:09] Daniel 5 exactly the same way and he
[14:13] said actually see that the scripture is
[14:15] today repeating again like it did in the
[14:19] days of Babylon so when you're reading
[14:21] Daniel 5 you think you're reading about
[14:24] Bel jaar's Feast you're thinking about
[14:26] something that happened to 539 BC see
[14:29] you're thinking it's that far removed
[14:31] from you over 2500 years but actually
[14:34] you're reading uh today's newspaper you
[14:37] can take the Book of Daniel and the Book
[14:38] of Revelation and you can realize it's
[14:40] actually happening right now today
[14:43] because scriptures are repeating itself
[14:45] now what brother random is showing us is
[14:47] we do not have Bel shazar we do not have
[14:49] Babylon but we have America and we have
[14:52] the same spirit that was existing in the
[14:55] days of Babylon is existing today the
[14:58] same way now brother Bram is very clear
[15:00] to say that Spirits don't die he said
[15:02] men die but the spirits live on so we
[15:05] see that that as the repeat of scripture
[15:08] begins then you can go back in the
[15:10] scripture and brother bam does a
[15:11] tremendous job to do this of showing the
[15:14] similarities between Babylon and the
[15:16] current day and he actually makes the
[15:18] scriptures begin to live quite quite
[15:20] profoundly he preaches it several times
[15:22] it's entitled handwriting on the wall I
[15:24] would suggest anyone could would go
[15:26] listen to it and look because even
[15:29] brother bandam draws out points like
[15:30] certain like uh they had 200t roads now
[15:34] that that's an odd thing uh to say about
[15:37] a city having 200 foot roads typing it
[15:40] but how many you realizes that America
[15:41] didn't have super highways until just
[15:43] the last 50 years it was a you go
[15:46] through a lot of little towns and you
[15:48] you you look and see how the little
[15:49] bitty streets was in the towns I've been
[15:52] to Europe several times EUR European
[15:54] streets in Germany sometimes on those
[15:56] little streets you can't hardly even put
[15:57] one car and they park on the because it
[16:00] was in the times when America was born
[16:03] of course it was it was a horse and
[16:05] Buggies and it was small cars and then
[16:07] the roads come along and it was just
[16:08] little I don't know if you've ever seen
[16:10] the cars from the early 40s but they're
[16:12] just little narrow cars and so the the
[16:15] the the highways were very small in this
[16:17] country but after World War II remember
[16:19] they seen the autobond it was in Germany
[16:22] and they come back and Eisenhower began
[16:23] to build the interstate systems and he
[16:25] was doing it for military use to be able
[16:27] to uh to bring the military across and
[16:30] they started building interstates and
[16:32] super highways well you you think those
[16:34] things just happened but brother brandom
[16:36] had a vision in
[16:38] 1933 where there would be a an auto car
[16:41] automated car driving down a super
[16:44] highway and he explains these real super
[16:47] wide highways but they didn't have them
[16:48] in
[16:49] 1933 but today look at the super
[16:52] highways we have and he talks about
[16:54] Babylon in the days of its destruction
[16:57] having 200t highways so he's showing us
[17:00] that whatever was existing during those
[17:03] days have now begin to relive again and
[17:06] not just the highways being wide not
[17:08] just the militaries being great but
[17:10] we're living in a time when the attitude
[17:13] of the people have returned to the same
[17:15] attitude that it was in that day see in
[17:18] in this country now I know many of us is
[17:20] too young to remember these things but
[17:21] we do have history and we do have books
[17:23] and you can read and look and uh but in
[17:26] the in the 40s in America people were
[17:29] desperate for God not just the message
[17:31] people not just a few people uh that
[17:33] were in a certain type of church but but
[17:36] you had community churches and you had
[17:37] where people got together everybody
[17:39] prayed they they were praying for
[17:41] soldiers and the war America was almost
[17:43] being taken over by the Japanese and the
[17:45] Germans and the security of the future
[17:48] wasn't there and people were fasting and
[17:49] praying and holding visuals and Revival
[17:52] meetings and and they were longing for
[17:54] God but see after we won the war and
[17:57] after things begin to settle down we
[17:59] begin to get a bigger military we begin
[18:00] to get the UN we begin to depend upon
[18:03] one another and we thought everything
[18:05] was everything was settled America's too
[18:07] great to fall right now as soon as that
[18:11] attitude begin to live in America people
[18:15] all of the sudden watch what's happening
[18:17] in the same time periods rock and roll
[18:19] was being born television is starting to
[18:22] come out sin is starting to go on the
[18:25] increase like never before I I thought
[18:28] it was amazing at the parallels when
[18:31] brother BR begins to talk about
[18:32] belshazzar here who is the is actually
[18:35] the the the king at the time of the
[18:38] destruction of Babylon that his attitude
[18:40] brother B said his attitude his Spirit
[18:43] was that we canot fall we cannot be
[18:45] destroyed now here's the problem with
[18:47] that the scripture had already been
[18:50] prophesied when Nebuchadnezzar had had a
[18:53] dream and Daniel had told Nebuchadnezzar
[18:56] that there would come an end to his
[18:57] kingdom and the mes and the Persians
[19:00] were going to overtake it when this
[19:02] scripture is being transpired in Daniel
[19:05] 5 there has been already two great
[19:07] battles between the mes and the Persians
[19:10] and the Babylonians and the Babylonians
[19:12] had lost those battles and the Persians
[19:15] had besieged the city of Babylon they
[19:18] was literally circled the city of
[19:20] Babylon and this man was so arrogant
[19:23] that he didn't believe that they would
[19:25] be able to penetrate those walls or my
[19:27] kingdom cannot fall uh uh it's recorded
[19:30] in history that the day they threw this
[19:32] Festival that the per that they had
[19:34] looked out and the Persians had
[19:36] disappeared and they believed the
[19:38] Persians had gave up and went home
[19:40] that's what they thought they thought
[19:42] this is all over Russia's not going to
[19:44] attack us they're not going to use their
[19:46] bombs this is all finished we can all
[19:48] relax we can hold a party we can we can
[19:51] we can just go back to the business as
[19:53] usual and brother M says what happened
[19:55] that day was this this Bel chazar the
[19:58] Bible record towards it that he invites
[20:00] a thousand of the princes and begins to
[20:02] have a party and and they I love how
[20:05] brother Bram says things he said they
[20:07] had a rock and roll party amen they had
[20:10] a rock and roll party well I'm the guy I
[20:12] went back and looked and you know you do
[20:14] you realize that Elvis Presley did not
[20:17] even come into music until
[20:20] 1954 he come in Sun Records in 1954 amen
[20:24] from from down in the south of
[20:25] Mississippi there and it's amazing to me
[20:28] that in
[20:29] 1954 what was transpiring on the earth
[20:33] spiritually amen but the entire American
[20:36] popular was swung towards rock and roll
[20:39] in the same hours that there was a
[20:42] prophet on the scene and God was doing
[20:44] something to deliver the people and he
[20:46] was bringing the adoption authority to
[20:48] the church from The Book of Romans the
[20:51] sons of God was going to receive the
[20:53] authority of the spoken word just in a
[20:55] short few years that would come and an
[20:58] adoption robe set upon a bride a blood
[21:01] wash bride and while God is transpiring
[21:04] working in the Supernatural to bring the
[21:06] greatest Revival that has ever struck
[21:09] the planet in them same hours Satan is
[21:11] inspiring Elvis Presley to come out of
[21:14] the Pentecostal church and and bring a
[21:16] rock and roll and drums and a hot guitar
[21:19] and cause the girls to begin to Boogie
[21:21] wogie and brought brought actually
[21:23] brought sex acts right out on the
[21:24] platform and brought the spirit of
[21:26] sexuality and rock and roll and
[21:28] sensuality brought it right into the
[21:30] right into the platform back in 1954
[21:33] amen every church was preaching against
[21:36] it the Baptist and the lutherans and
[21:38] everybody was preaching against it but
[21:40] all of the sudden amen the the people
[21:42] the people began to win the battle and
[21:45] begin to get what they wanted so rock
[21:47] and roll begin to take over amen it just
[21:49] a couple years before that prohibition
[21:51] had Struck it it it had never been like
[21:54] this in the history of the world alcohol
[21:56] was legalized right here this country
[21:59] now I come from Arkansas I just be
[22:01] honest for years right there in that
[22:03] little town in Arkansas where we come
[22:05] from you'd have to drive a solid hour to
[22:07] get a beer you you would unless you
[22:10] found somebody illegal CU every County
[22:12] around where I live was dry there was no
[22:14] even till today they're all dry counties
[22:17] there there was five liquor license give
[22:19] in a city I worked with in Jonesboro
[22:21] Arkansas and there was two clubs in that
[22:24] City and there there was five I believe
[22:26] five liquor license we looked it up one
[22:28] day to see who owned it three of them
[22:30] the Baptist Church owned they bought
[22:32] them and used them and said they they
[22:34] actually bought the liquor license so
[22:36] nobody else could set up a beer joint in
[22:37] that town that that was the kind of
[22:40] that's the kind of feeling that was in
[22:41] that area against liquor but but you
[22:44] recognize if that would have stuck in
[22:46] every family in every home now we now
[22:49] Liquor's been legalized so long now that
[22:51] people don't think that much about it
[22:53] just a little social drink or a little
[22:55] little something to be drink but but you
[22:57] recognize that it all always magnifies
[22:59] the wrong kind of nature amen and it
[23:02] emboldens we used to say got get a
[23:05] little bit of Whiskey In Me 6ot tall and
[23:08] bulletproof and that's true amen they're
[23:10] six foot tall and bulletproof they'll
[23:12] fight and meaner than a a snake a and
[23:15] make up bold things and do bold things
[23:18] they would never do that without alcohol
[23:20] but the more alcohol is drink the Bolder
[23:23] people come the more less they're
[23:24] worried about the consequences of things
[23:27] amen you you you see when you're
[23:28] thinking with the right mind you're
[23:30] thinking about the consequences of your
[23:32] choices not just your choices but when
[23:34] you when you get a little bit under the
[23:36] wrong influence you forget about the
[23:38] consequence and you just make the choice
[23:40] to whatever the whatever the flesh wants
[23:42] now we can promise you something that
[23:44] the pleasure of sin amen it the Bible
[23:47] calls it pleasure so the pleasure of sin
[23:49] is real but it is only for a season you
[23:52] see it is only a season that is
[23:55] pleasurable and then it becomes very
[23:57] costly there there's many homes today
[23:59] that have been broke apart by alcohol
[24:01] there's many homes today there's many
[24:03] there's many of little kids that will go
[24:05] to bed tonight on an empty stomach with
[24:07] no clothes amen with with with a
[24:09] horrible living conditions because Daddy
[24:11] went and spent the grocery money on on a
[24:14] pack of beer and got drunk and and spent
[24:17] I I've literally oh my Lord I don't know
[24:18] why I'm here but can I is it okay if I
[24:20] preach y'all this morning amen but
[24:22] literally I've seen guys give away $100
[24:25] bills and their kids at home and needing
[24:28] clothes and needing food and but they
[24:30] get a little drunk and they just lit
[24:33] I've literally heard men holding $100
[24:36] bills and burning them right in the air
[24:38] because they a little bit SED they
[24:40] wanted to be uh uh show how big they
[24:42] were because they were on alcohol now
[24:44] now now that that thing was alive in the
[24:48] days of Babylon and you you tell me
[24:50] where has it ever been any worse than it
[24:53] is right now you can't even go to a
[24:56] restaurant without there being alcohol
[24:59] everywhere amen and what's going on why
[25:01] is it brother Ram tells us in the
[25:03] message he says what happened is God
[25:05] sent a comforter he says he cares so he
[25:08] sends the word which is a comforter but
[25:11] men could not receive the spirit of
[25:13] Truth as a comforter so they're
[25:15] literally so neurotic they have to have
[25:17] something so the alcohol is making more
[25:20] alcohol than they ever have people
[25:22] drinking more whiskey more beer CU
[25:24] they're trying to satisfy or bring a
[25:26] comfort to that situation ation that's
[25:28] in their life they're smoking more
[25:30] cigarettes cigarettes were not even
[25:31] invented to the late 1800s or 1900s amen
[25:35] it wasn't back in the back in 1700s you
[25:38] know that pictures where people walking
[25:40] around smoking cigarettes all day that
[25:42] that wasn't that wasn't something to do
[25:44] but it wasn't until the maror man come
[25:46] along and then they went into the
[25:48] Hollywood and and Hollywood see it made
[25:50] a way to make it where uh important
[25:52] people drink whiskey and smoked
[25:54] cigarettes amen it made a way where
[25:56] people who were supposed to be a certain
[25:58] way did things like this which become
[26:01] popular which then become the a very run
[26:04] of the meal now I I I hope you're see
[26:06] what I'm trying to say to you that the
[26:09] spirit that was in this day was no
[26:12] different than it was in that day they
[26:14] were drinking they were having a rock
[26:16] and roll party they were enjoying the
[26:18] night life they were having a good time
[26:20] it wasn't just the people the president
[26:23] was the one that invited them to do it
[26:26] they're having a party because there's
[26:27] no consequence there's no God he can't
[26:30] see us we're Behind These Walls we're
[26:32] falsely secured that's what a prophet is
[26:35] telling us they were had their security
[26:37] in their military they had their
[26:39] security in their walls not in their God
[26:42] Amen but brother Ram says it he said but
[26:44] look he said amen God was not looking
[26:47] through the walls he said he was looking
[26:49] down through under through the walls he
[26:52] was above the walls looking down on the
[26:54] sin he wasn't trying to see it through
[26:57] so the false sec security had brought
[26:59] them that way now I I want to take just
[27:01] a moment in this deceiving age we're
[27:03] living in probably brother Ram said it's
[27:05] the most deceiving of all the ages this
[27:07] is the season of time when the man of
[27:11] sin shall be revealed now he said what
[27:13] was a a child of disobedience in the
[27:15] days of Paul has now become a man of sin
[27:18] he said how much greater is a man
[27:21] deceiving than a child is deceiving so
[27:23] we're living in the age right now where
[27:25] we have built churches and church
[27:27] membership and people have become
[27:30] members of churches and they have
[27:32] decided that they're secure in the
[27:34] church membership live like the devil
[27:36] five days a week go to church on Sunday
[27:38] but if you're a member of that church
[27:40] it's all right everything's okay God's
[27:42] not going to be able to see through that
[27:44] church membership amen do you see the
[27:46] falseness of the security that is being
[27:49] built within the people the lie that is
[27:52] been told to the people just believe and
[27:55] you've got the Holy Ghost just believe
[27:57] my Doctrine and you're safe from all
[27:59] tribulation you're safe from everything
[28:01] just believe that's all you have to do
[28:03] is just believe and you got it it don't
[28:05] take a life it don't take Doctrine it
[28:07] don't take truth it don't take life it
[28:10] don't take Holiness do do you see the
[28:12] falseness of the security of what the
[28:15] devil done in that day he has repeated
[28:18] in this day doing the same thing but
[28:21] today men are not hiding behind walls
[28:24] they're hiding behind the Fig Leaf of
[28:27] man-made r religion and they decided
[28:30] that God can't see through it but he saw
[28:32] through it in the Garden of Eden he
[28:34] looked right through Adam amen he looked
[28:37] right through zakus when he was hiding
[28:40] he climbed up high and got behind a fig
[28:43] Leaf but that Discerning Spirit of the
[28:45] Lord Jesus looked right at him amen and
[28:48] said zakus come on down you can't hide
[28:51] behind the leaf Adam can't hide behind
[28:53] the leaf and you can't hide behind the
[28:55] leaf you cannot cover up sin you cannot
[28:59] make it look pretty you cannot say it's
[29:02] okay because amen because I'm so and so
[29:04] or I believe certain thing sin God will
[29:08] judge wherever that it is found God will
[29:11] judge sin that's the truth friend amen
[29:14] whether it don't matter where you come
[29:15] from or where you're going that stands
[29:17] to be the truth God will judge sin and
[29:21] there is only one covering for sin there
[29:23] is only one place to hide from sin that
[29:27] is in Jes Jesus Christ the son of God
[29:30] and the only way to get into Christ he
[29:33] said by one Spirit we are baptized into
[29:36] one body and the only way you can ever
[29:38] say I am safe is if you have received
[29:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy
[29:45] Ghost will bring a safety into your life
[29:48] oh aren't you so glad today to know that
[29:50] you're sitting under a word that is told
[29:53] you don't be settled on memberships
[29:55] don't be settled with a church don't be
[29:57] settled with the doctrine you get the
[29:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost and let the
[30:02] spirit and the life of Jesus
[30:05] Christ come upon you do you see what it
[30:08] is it's a type of America it's a false
[30:10] security they close the doors and build
[30:13] up a military and believe they could do
[30:15] what they wanted to now look what they
[30:17] do brother bam will say it one place
[30:19] he'll say and while they were doing this
[30:21] there was a prophet in the land I
[30:23] thought oh my Daniel was there the whole
[30:26] time that was message and there was a
[30:29] prophet existing while they were going
[30:31] the way they were going amen there was a
[30:33] prophet there the whole time but rather
[30:35] than obeying the message rather than
[30:37] humbling to the message you know what
[30:39] they did they made fun of
[30:41] it can you imagine making fun of a
[30:45] message with the Persians camped outside
[30:48] the
[30:49] gates are you hearing me Russia don't
[30:53] have to make bombs today they got
[30:56] them Putin doesn't have to describe and
[30:59] make new Atomic Warfare he's got it what
[31:03] will destroy this world is setting in
[31:06] the bomb hangers today what is going to
[31:10] obliterate this world that we're in is
[31:12] in the bomb hangers you said well God
[31:14] would never do that to America but in
[31:17] 1933 the same guy that saw Germany being
[31:21] Hitler invaded in into into musolini and
[31:25] how musolini would die and how the
[31:27] cigarettes would become illegal to smoke
[31:29] and how they would build the magin
[31:31] online amen how he said an automatic car
[31:33] was coming how that there would be a
[31:35] woman dressed in purple of president or
[31:37] vice president of the country amen the
[31:40] same guy that said all of that he said
[31:42] the last thing I saw was America laying
[31:45] in ashes he said I had to turn my head
[31:48] from it it was so bad look church amen
[31:51] this America is finished this America
[31:55] judgment has come on it not not today in
[31:59] 1956 a prophet announced the Judgment
[32:02] Upon This Nation they had turned down
[32:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and only
[32:07] judgment is left for this nation that
[32:09] we're living in do not build your home
[32:12] as an American do not build your life as
[32:15] an American you are a citizen of another
[32:18] kingdom do not invest in America do not
[32:21] invest in the politics of America do not
[32:24] set your securities as an American amen
[32:27] be before I'm an American I'm a Son of
[32:30] God before I amen of any civilization of
[32:33] this Earth I am a child of God Daniel
[32:37] was in Babylon but he was not a
[32:39] Babylonian he was an Israelite amen and
[32:42] today we are the sons of God and and as
[32:45] the prophet said we are more Jew than
[32:47] the Jew because we Are Spiritual Jew by
[32:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are the
[32:52] Seed of Abraham and Heir according to
[32:56] the promise the Judgment that that's on
[32:58] This Nation amen does not mean our end
[33:01] it is declaring our a
[33:05] beginning my don't forget who you
[33:08] are now what's amazing is they bring
[33:12] these things out and they begin to make
[33:13] fun of them in one place brother randam
[33:15] said the vessels they were making fun of
[33:17] was Holy Ghost filled people God's
[33:20] vessels they were making fun of the
[33:23] vessels uh I I I think that it's amazing
[33:27] that the the scriptures tells us that
[33:29] the arrogance of this man I want you to
[33:31] read the chapter when you get home I'm
[33:32] not going to read to you a lot but but
[33:34] the arrogance of this man Bel chanard
[33:37] this is how arrogant he
[33:39] was in the middle of the very ones that
[33:43] were prophesied to take over his
[33:45] kingdom he literally was having a rock
[33:47] and roll party and to top it off you
[33:50] know what he
[33:51] done he told his his his people his
[33:55] authorities he said you go down there
[33:58] and get the vessels that we pillaged out
[34:01] of Jerusalem where we destroyed that
[34:04] place of worship you go get the vessels
[34:06] and bring them up here and let's drink
[34:09] out of them brother BR said can you
[34:11] imagine the vessel of God when they
[34:14] poured Pat's Blue Ribbon into the vessel
[34:17] can you imagine that he had such a a
[34:20] boldness that God could not get to him
[34:23] amen he had such a disdaining thing for
[34:25] God that he poured that that that full
[34:28] of liquor and the the thing that was
[34:31] concentrated designed for the worship of
[34:34] almighty God was being used for the
[34:37] worship of another God now I don't have
[34:39] message says this so you can take it or
[34:41] leave it but they say that belshazzar
[34:43] had switched the from the gods of
[34:45] Nebuchadnezzar and was worshiping a moon
[34:47] God whose name was sin I thought that
[34:49] was pretty
[34:50] fitting amen it was a moon God and they
[34:52] were worshiping and they believed that
[34:55] the powers of the gods that they were
[34:57] under were greater than the gods of
[34:59] Daniel who had prophesied there do you
[35:01] see what he's doing he's facing the end
[35:04] and mocking the one that prophesied he
[35:07] would be ended he was in the middle of
[35:10] it saying you there's no end coming
[35:13] there's no judgment coming amen somebody
[35:15] go get the vessels out of that false
[35:17] God's Temple that we took over and
[35:19] crushed go get them and let's drink and
[35:21] they were drinking from the cups now do
[35:24] y'all do y'all if you study the book of
[35:25] Jeremiah you'll find this very very
[35:28] interesting for the book of Jeremiah
[35:30] you'll find out that while they were
[35:31] actually drinking from these cups this
[35:34] is exactly when that a handwriting
[35:37] appears on the wall when you look at
[35:39] Jeremiah chapter 50 you're reading
[35:41] chapter verses
[35:42] 28-34 the Bible actually says amen that
[35:45] them that flee and Escape out of the
[35:47] land of Babylon to declare and design
[35:49] the Vengeance of the Lord Our God for
[35:51] the Vengeance of his Temple do you know
[35:53] in Jeremiah it is nearly 80 years or 90
[35:57] before they drank out of these cups and
[36:00] the and the temple is being judged that
[36:02] God says through Jeremiah that when
[36:04] judgment comes to Babylon it'll be for
[36:06] the Vengeance of the Temple of the lord
[36:09] and there he sits with a cup in his hand
[36:13] and he's drinking from this now I I I
[36:15] don't have ability to set the scene but
[36:17] I want you to realize it's a modern
[36:19] America and in the middle of modern
[36:22] America in the middle of a rock and roll
[36:23] party Supernatural sign shows up on the
[36:26] wall and it says many tickle you Farson
[36:29] amen it's just a the Bible says I I
[36:31] think it's amazing I was trying to I was
[36:34] trying to picture this yesterday I was
[36:36] just trying to think what that King was
[36:37] thinking when the Bible said he actually
[36:40] saw a part of the hand as it wrote it on
[36:43] the
[36:46] wall can you imagine that God of Daniel
[36:50] can't get to
[36:55] me who
[36:58] who let him in
[37:01] here which one of you guards let him in
[37:04] here how did that hand get on that wall
[37:07] to even ride
[37:09] it because God's not subject to their
[37:11] rules or their
[37:13] orders he was involved whether they want
[37:16] him involved or not and he wrote he
[37:19] wrote right on the wall a supernatural
[37:22] now brother Randon when he said when
[37:23] this Supernatural comes he said the
[37:26] supernatural he said that's exactly how
[37:29] the Babylonian Kingdom went out the
[37:32] Gentile kingdom come in with
[37:35] Supernatural on the wall he said and
[37:37] that's how the Gentile kingdom is going
[37:39] to
[37:41] end the Gentile kingdom was the was the
[37:44] time that Daniel was living there it
[37:46] began and it began with
[37:49] Supernatural but the middle of that
[37:51] Supernatural was the ending of Babylon
[37:54] and that's exactly how the Gentile
[37:56] kingdoms Within is with the supernatural
[37:59] can can you think about this in the
[38:01] middle of Elvis Presley having a rock
[38:03] and roll concert Amen in Louisiana
[38:06] across the street from the Louisiana
[38:09] hayride was Jack Moore's Life Tabernacle
[38:13] where weam brandham the seventh star was
[38:15] being introduced to America through jack
[38:18] Moore's meetings and across the street
[38:20] was a Louisiana hay ride Elvis Presley
[38:23] was introducing the world to rock and
[38:24] roll they were both having a gathering
[38:27] one under rock and roll one under the
[38:29] word of God in the middle of the Rock
[38:31] and Roll Party the supernatural was
[38:34] being written on the wall I've literally
[38:36] been down the street Jack moris is on
[38:38] one side Louisiana Hy rides on the other
[38:40] side there's two stars being born
[38:43] Hollywood had a star but God had a star
[38:46] and one was going to lead us away from
[38:48] judgment and the other was leading
[38:50] thousands in the Judgment amen Elvis
[38:53] Presley amen you know what brother R
[38:55] said about him he said he was a judas's
[38:57] carer he said he had no business singing
[39:00] The Gospel of Jesus Christ amen he said
[39:03] he's a hypocrite he's a Judas scariot
[39:05] and he led a million Souls can you think
[39:08] about all the little girls tonight that
[39:10] is in hell because of that rock and roll
[39:13] boogie wogie music listen let me I I oh
[39:16] God I don't know what's wrong with me
[39:17] brother Ray but I tell you it's just the
[39:19] truth but the brother Ram said if you're
[39:21] unconverted he said that rock and roll
[39:23] will sound pretty good to you he said
[39:25] you can't help it these young people
[39:26] can't help
[39:27] it sounds pretty good to them but I
[39:29] think the Church of the Living God ought
[39:31] to be growed up a little bit past rock
[39:34] and roll I think it ought to be a shame
[39:36] if rock and roll is coming over our
[39:38] televisions and radios and whatever more
[39:40] in our homes and our little kids are
[39:42] hearing rock and roll cuz Mama and
[39:44] Daddy's doing well I'm preaching I might
[39:46] as well go ahead and preach and if
[39:47] anybody come to become the church
[39:49] tonight I'd appreciate an amen amen do
[39:51] you see what it is there's a rock and
[39:53] roll and now I know we was laughing
[39:55] about the other day me and my daughter
[39:56] be great she was talking about it she
[39:58] said dad I I understand countries bad he
[40:01] said she said when they play it people
[40:02] lose their dogs and they lose their
[40:04] homes and they lose their truck and they
[40:06] lose their parents and they lose their
[40:08] wife and they lose everything she said
[40:11] but you know when people play rock and
[40:12] roll they kill their mom and they kill
[40:14] their dad they burned their house amen
[40:17] it's just a it's just a greater
[40:18] advancement of the same thing now now I
[40:21] I don't have time to argue rock and roll
[40:23] if you want to have that argument we'll
[40:24] have it later but I can promise you I'm
[40:26] going to win if we take take the
[40:29] word if we take the word if we take
[40:31] modern arguments you can reason your way
[40:33] out of anything that's exactly what Eve
[40:35] did in the garden and look at the mess
[40:37] she ended up in so it's a good time to
[40:39] quit reasoning what what a prophet said
[40:41] and believe what a prophet said and if
[40:44] he said the thing will lead your soul to
[40:45] Hell it'll take you to Hell in a hand
[40:48] basket so it's time to get rid of it
[40:50] hello Church of the Living God it's time
[40:52] to have a house cleaning in the Church
[40:54] of God it's time to remember we are not
[40:57] just vessels we are Sanctified vessels
[41:00] of almighty god well my
[41:05] goodness amen do you see what it was it
[41:08] was a it was a it was a time of rock and
[41:10] roll it was a time when these things
[41:12] were happening they were drinking wine
[41:15] and they were Rock and rolling and
[41:17] brother R said the modern strip teasers
[41:19] was
[41:26] dancing
[41:31] I wish you was preaching brother
[41:38] R you see what it was you see the
[41:40] setting see what he's telling us the
[41:43] idea well we'll just go dance a little
[41:45] and have a little drink and brother BR
[41:47] is telling you that's exactly the state
[41:50] Babylon was in the day they got
[41:54] judged do you see what it was God had
[41:57] gave them a message an end is here God
[42:01] had gave them a prophet the end is here
[42:03] but they made fun of
[42:05] it the way people do today when you
[42:08] preach against rock and roll
[42:10] music the same way they do today sitting
[42:13] right in churches and they'll just kind
[42:14] of Snicker in the back of the mind with
[42:16] that old
[42:17] Crank That Old that old crank if he was
[42:20] a young guy he' enjoy well I was a young
[42:22] guy and I preached against it when I was
[42:23] 21 years
[42:26] old
[42:28] probably a little harder than I am this
[42:31] morning I've seasoned a little bit I'm
[42:33] trying to be
[42:37] nice but they they made fun of it do do
[42:39] you see that they made fun of
[42:41] it they made fun of what a prophet had
[42:44] to say about drinking and carousing and
[42:48] dancing and rock and roll they literally
[42:52] were looking at the destruction and the
[42:55] end of the world
[42:57] laughing at a
[43:01] prophet you said brother Wayne I'm not
[43:04] laughing at a prophet but the Bible
[43:06] says Jesus says your mouth is near me
[43:10] but your
[43:12] heart it's far from
[43:15] me do you see what happens is there has
[43:18] to be there has to be a
[43:21] realization of the modern America and
[43:24] what we're looking at there there is a
[43:26] reason and they're doing it but it's not
[43:30] scriptural see when this when this come
[43:33] on the wall the supernatural appears in
[43:36] this kind of a moment I just it just it
[43:39] just struck me it's happening at the
[43:42] same
[43:44] time and and now the Bible says when the
[43:48] supernatural comes that the king is
[43:50] shaken by it he he he he he's just he's
[43:54] just it's amazing to him that God would
[43:57] do something so Supernatural cuz what it
[43:58] done is it brought a reality that there
[44:00] was a
[44:01] God that maybe what Daniel said wasn't
[44:05] crazy maybe some of these things are
[44:07] true so when this appears on the wall he
[44:10] goes and gets all of his preachers and
[44:12] all of his susers and he says to them
[44:14] what does these things actually
[44:16] mean what does these mean now I I
[44:19] thought it was amazing that none of them
[44:22] understood what it really
[44:25] meant nobody could tell him what that
[44:27] meant what that writing was there they
[44:30] didn't understand the language they
[44:31] didn't know the handwriting they was not
[44:34] familiar with this words of the of the
[44:36] one they were dealing with so they asked
[44:38] everybody nobody knew nobody knew how to
[44:40] take care of it but brother ramam says
[44:42] but watch the scripture says there was a
[44:44] woman who was a queen who lived in that
[44:46] day which was the mother of Bel chazar
[44:49] and they brought her in brother B said
[44:50] notice she wasn't in the
[44:52] party hey she she wasn't in the party
[44:55] she remembered from the days of Daniel
[44:57] when they brought her in and she looked
[45:00] at the writing she says listen now there
[45:02] is a man that's in the Kingdom that was
[45:05] in the kingdom in the days of their
[45:07] father Nebuchadnezzar who who would be
[45:09] able to solve problems like this and
[45:12] he's here and there's a man here that
[45:14] can dissolve the doubts I think it's
[45:17] written in two places in verse 10 and
[45:19] verse 12 that she said there's a man
[45:21] here that can dissolve Z when brother
[45:23] bam comes to this point you would think
[45:25] that he would say he was the man that
[45:27] could dissolve the doubts brother Bram
[45:28] pushed that away he said see there is a
[45:31] man in the Kingdom he said but the man
[45:33] in the kingdom is Jesus Christ he said
[45:36] there is a man in the Kingdom today see
[45:39] he was standing in the Pentecostal
[45:42] Kingdom and he was looking at the end of
[45:44] the Pentecostal age and he was saying to
[45:46] him there's a man here right now in the
[45:49] Kingdom who can dissolve the doubts he
[45:51] can answer the questions he can tell you
[45:53] what the Supernatural is about what does
[45:55] all these things mean man has no clue
[45:58] what they mean but God is able to
[46:01] dissolve the doubts Amen Let me let me
[46:03] just say this I believe that brother
[46:05] Brandon was saying something very clear
[46:07] to us Isaiah 60 says that there was
[46:09] Darkness amen upon the Earth and gross
[46:12] Darkness on the people but at the same
[46:14] time the Bible said unto the children of
[46:17] God arise and shine for thy light has
[46:20] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[46:22] upon thee in the same hour of darkness
[46:25] when the great light of understanding
[46:28] and reality in the same hour those were
[46:31] the same words but they meant something
[46:33] totally different to two types of people
[46:36] it took the one who could understand it
[46:38] to dissolve the doubts of what the real
[46:39] meaning of it is what is the real
[46:41] meaning of the message what is the real
[46:43] meaning I I think it's powerful what's
[46:46] the meaning of all the angels that were
[46:48] seen appearing through the 1940s and
[46:50] 1950s listen I I I I know some of you
[46:53] sitting here maybe don't realize this
[46:55] but the Angels were appearing to a lot
[46:56] more than brother randam am me not not
[46:59] in Ministry wise but Angels were coming
[47:01] to people all over the country I right
[47:04] within my family my grandmother had a
[47:06] angel come standing at the end of her
[47:08] bed two or three nights in a row in
[47:10] different periods of her life it was an
[47:12] Ang would literally come in and stand
[47:14] amen just right in front of things my
[47:16] dad amen had these experiences as a
[47:18] little boy back in the early 50s when he
[47:21] he'd be in a rocking chair he said wake
[47:22] up and it' be somebody sitting there in
[47:24] the rocking chair watching him sleep
[47:26] amen he he couldn't hardly sleep as a
[47:27] little boy people all over the country
[47:30] why was all these Ministries springing
[47:32] up why was with the miracle men who
[47:34] wasn't even good men were seeing great
[47:36] miracles in their lives and Revival
[47:39] fires Were Striking amen UFOs were being
[47:42] spotted everywhere people used to make
[47:43] fun of UFOs Air Force is now releasing
[47:47] videos and proof that a Air Force has
[47:50] being seing UFOs for
[47:52] years UFO unidentified flying objects
[47:55] amen amen what what do they mean what do
[47:58] they mean well it took a prophet amen
[48:00] but the prophet stood there and said
[48:03] there's a man that can tell us what it
[48:04] is is same thing in Genesis the 6th
[48:08] chapter when the two angels went down to
[48:11] Sodom brother B said there was an
[48:12] investigating judgment going on at that
[48:15] time and God was sending Watchers Out of
[48:18] Heaven to investigate what was going on
[48:21] on the earth look Church they're not
[48:23] unidentified fine objects they're Angels
[48:26] who are there to look at the Earth and
[48:28] see the condition it's in for the Bible
[48:31] said amen when the cup of the Amorite of
[48:34] the iniquity has become full that there
[48:37] would be a Deliverance for the Seed of
[48:39] Abraham and God has got angels watching
[48:42] those cups because there's a Deliverance
[48:45] that is coming on the Church of the
[48:47] Living God just like his angels were
[48:49] watching that night in Babylon Daniel
[48:52] was a prisoner Hebrew children were a
[48:54] prisoner thousands of Israelites were
[48:56] prisoners in Babylon and while they were
[48:59] reeling in their party God sent a
[49:01] supernatural sign on the wall it meant
[49:04] judgment to one but it meant Deliverance
[49:07] to another my when I think about it this
[49:11] morning I think about the grace of God
[49:14] when that appears that Queen said there
[49:16] is a dissolver of doubts there's one
[49:18] that can dissolve your doubts brother
[49:20] man said if you're having doubts about
[49:22] this message he said come up to the
[49:24] Altar and ask the Holy Spirit about it
[49:26] heal his arm your
[49:27] doubts if there's a spirit of doubt I
[49:30] preached a youth meeting one year in
[49:31] Edmonton and titled it the dissolver of
[49:33] doubts I didn't realize it but right
[49:36] then there was a there was a big critic
[49:38] that rose up in that area against the
[49:40] message and one of their youth leaders
[49:41] had fell under it and become a Judas and
[49:43] was trying to pull the young people out
[49:45] of the church pull them away from the
[49:47] message of the hour and God sent me in
[49:49] there right at that time and I preached
[49:51] a message the dissolver of doubts I
[49:53] didn't understand why I was preaching it
[49:54] at that moment but I knew I was supposed
[49:56] to be preaching it and while I was
[49:58] preaching that dissolver doubts I begin
[50:00] to invite the children won't you just
[50:03] come and have an experience with
[50:04] somebody who can tell you if it's right
[50:06] don't ask me if it's right don't ask a
[50:09] preacher if it's right don't ask another
[50:11] man if it's right there's one that knows
[50:13] this message is right and it's the god
[50:15] that sent it and if you'll get in the
[50:17] presence of the Angel of the Lord he
[50:19] will confirm to you this is the word in
[50:22] heaven he but in heaven they're not
[50:24] questioning this message they're not
[50:26] questioning brother rand's teachings in
[50:28] heaven matter of fact brother random
[50:30] went up there and they said brother
[50:31] random we're resting on what you taught
[50:34] Heaven's resting on it amen how much
[50:36] greater can we today put our rest and
[50:38] our hope and our strength in this
[50:41] message that we begin to believe let it
[50:43] Search Your Heart let the message Search
[50:45] Your Heart kill every doubt kill every
[50:48] feeling don't let that devil amen
[50:50] destroy you I know there's a lot of
[50:52] gainsayers there's a lot of critics we
[50:54] were talking at the house the other day
[50:56] and I told told the kids I said I'll
[50:57] tell you this amen I've studied a lot of
[51:00] preachers I've studied a lot of sermons
[51:02] I've read a lot of books I've watched a
[51:04] lot of videos I've seen brother Bam's
[51:06] contemporaries I've heard their tricks
[51:08] I've seen their shamsters I've seen all
[51:10] the nonsense they done amen but but
[51:13] honestly what did William brandom ever
[51:15] do but but exalt Jesus Christ honestly
[51:20] from your heart you you answer that to
[51:22] me what did Brother brandom ever do but
[51:24] exalt Jesus Christ if you want to prove
[51:27] Jesus Christ is alive right now you take
[51:30] any other Ministry and prove it for me
[51:32] but if you'll allow me to use this
[51:35] message I will give you physical
[51:37] evidence that Jesus Christ is not in the
[51:39] Tomb over there in Israel he is alive
[51:43] and he's the same yesterday today and
[51:45] forever he is the almighty God we're not
[51:48] here talking about a man named William
[51:51] brandom we're talking about Jesus Christ
[51:54] the son of God who has rose up from from
[51:56] the dead and is hearing power and
[51:59] authority and Glory you talk about
[52:01] safety I'm not building a bomb shelter
[52:04] I'm not setting up AA Allen or no
[52:07] alcoholics synomous either amen that
[52:09] there is some feathers oh God there's
[52:12] some feathers Amen brother brother in
[52:14] Psalms 91 he said we could hide amen we
[52:18] could hide God will hide you under the
[52:21] feathers and the shadow of the Almighty
[52:24] I believe there's a secret place don't
[52:26] you
[52:28] come on I can't I can't pull off the
[52:30] fact that judgment Struck it William
[52:32] brandom said it did Amen in 1965 he
[52:35] threw up a rock he said judgment has
[52:37] struck the west coast and earthquakes
[52:40] earthquakes begin to release on that
[52:42] West Coast that ain't stopped
[52:46] yet they ain't stopped yet it almost
[52:49] suck Alaska but there's vibrations
[52:51] running in the earth amen that one of
[52:54] those vibrations one of these days will
[52:55] hit the right moment and when the angels
[52:58] look upon the Earth and said that's the
[53:00] finish of it we're done with it La is
[53:03] going to sink friends it's going to go
[53:05] under the ocean and right there in that
[53:07] place of judgment they're producing
[53:09] movies and they're producing filth and
[53:12] they're producing everything amen but
[53:14] what is it God has already predicted
[53:16] what would happen in
[53:17] it but when judgment Begin to Fall amen
[53:21] there was something that was given to
[53:22] the
[53:23] church that she would be able to to be
[53:27] delivered this writing was written was
[53:29] me manyi tickle e Farson and Daniel
[53:33] himself when he comes into the room to
[53:37] interpret
[53:38] it I thought it was pretty amazing
[53:40] because Daniel don't just go in there
[53:42] interpret it he gives that King a
[53:46] rebuke go read it serious a serious
[53:50] rebuke he tells him that this kingdom is
[53:53] falling because of the same sin nebuchad
[53:56] Nezar had committed and had been seven
[53:58] years in the wilderness for it and he
[54:01] told him he said look at this he said to
[54:04] him he said look King you knew what
[54:06] happened to
[54:08] Nebuchadnezzar you know what happened
[54:11] you that was your
[54:13] granddaddy you know what happened to him
[54:16] when he revolted against God you know
[54:19] what happened to that man but yet you do
[54:21] this
[54:22] anyhow you you you act like this knowing
[54:25] you know what happened then and you
[54:28] acting like it ain't going to happen now
[54:30] come on Church come on now that adultery
[54:33] Spirit ruined other men it'll ruin you
[54:36] that alcohol ruined others it'll ruin
[54:38] you tobacco ruined others it'll ruin
[54:42] you you know what it does amen I think
[54:45] it's high time that we quit being
[54:47] arrogant and start repenting and saying
[54:50] Lord I'm sorry that I thought that way
[54:52] or felt that
[54:54] way cuz what it really meant many many
[54:57] TI you fars and what it really
[54:59] meant put it in simple language it meant
[55:02] you in
[55:05] trouble you're in real trouble you in
[55:09] the kind of big trouble you can't get
[55:11] out of
[55:13] trouble you in
[55:16] trouble this Prophet looks at him and
[55:18] says this is the interpretation of the
[55:20] thing meaning meaning God hath numbered
[55:24] thy kingdom it's finished
[55:29] it's
[55:30] finished you think about that when God
[55:33] says it's
[55:36] finished it's finished he said it's
[55:40] finished when God pronounces something
[55:43] as
[55:44] finished it's
[55:46] finished it's fulfilled it's
[55:49] time it's amazing when you read
[55:51] Revelations the 10th chapter isn't it
[55:54] when a mighty Angel comes down out of
[55:56] heaven he has his hands lifted and his
[55:59] announcement is time will be no more
[56:04] what's this message mean
[56:06] anyhow it's
[56:09] finished according to Daniel 12 the book
[56:11] is open at the end time according to
[56:14] scripture the seventh angel is the last
[56:17] Angel to the to the church
[56:19] ages it means it's finished brother B
[56:23] said the seven seal means the end
[56:27] the end of struggling
[56:29] nature the end what what's it the end of
[56:32] brother Wayne I tell you in the church
[56:34] AG book can I can I have some Liberty
[56:36] here on Church AG book in the church AG
[56:39] book he thinks well you done took a
[56:40] bunch of Liberty brother
[56:42] Wayne Uh in in the church age book
[56:45] brother brandham actually says this and
[56:46] I I sometimes I I just want to put in a
[56:49] little plug for brother Bram cuz I get
[56:51] so tired of people uh uh uh attacking
[56:54] the the the grace of God God that was
[56:56] sent through him but brother br will say
[56:59] in the church's book he said I predict
[57:00] and do not prophesy that the World
[57:02] Systems will end
[57:04] 1977 he said I say this by divine
[57:07] inspiration so people went around and
[57:09] brother Bram says I predict I do not
[57:10] prophesy do not go say brother brandham
[57:13] said but they did they went and said and
[57:16] he didn't say so what made it appear
[57:19] brother brandham had falsely
[57:22] said said well he said it by divine
[57:25] inspiration he did he had Divine
[57:26] inspired dreams seven of them or visions
[57:30] and he said according to those I don't
[57:32] see how it could go
[57:34] past you see brother Wayne did something
[57:37] end it did World Systems did end if you
[57:40] read in the church age Book World
[57:41] Systems are denominational
[57:44] ages according to the breach amen used
[57:47] to be page 74 I don't know what the page
[57:49] is now but according to breach page 74
[57:51] brother Bram said when the book is open
[57:53] denominational ages are ended he said
[57:56] what God is doing now is revealing what
[57:59] they left
[58:00] out you said preacher what are you
[58:02] saying I'm saying it's
[58:04] finished I'm saying Church government is
[58:08] finished I'm saying the shuck carried
[58:11] the life for a period but it's finished
[58:15] the seed and the Shu have now separated
[58:18] judgment has fell upon the Shu amen it's
[58:21] being gathered in the Garner for the
[58:23] burning amen the harvesting angels have
[58:26] come upon the Earth and they're
[58:28] Gathering the Church of the Living God
[58:30] and denomination is bundling the rest of
[58:32] it
[58:34] together it's
[58:36] finished and we could preach a while on
[58:39] that it's it's finished amen what is it
[58:41] it's finished and the interpretation
[58:43] means Thou Art weighed in a balance and
[58:45] found warning other words God's word on
[58:48] one side and you on the other side and
[58:51] you don't weigh
[58:53] enough be the first time we were told we
[58:55] didn't weigh enough
[58:59] huh you can't meet the
[59:02] balance but if you see what's on the
[59:04] other side you'll understand why you
[59:06] can't meet the
[59:07] balance because people say well brother
[59:09] way I'm a good man I do good works I go
[59:11] to church I do this I do this and do
[59:12] this and they give you all these works
[59:13] and you put all them works on one side
[59:15] and you put Jesus on the other side and
[59:17] you still don't weigh
[59:18] enough because you're never going to
[59:20] weigh enough on those scales you know
[59:23] what those scales say be ye perfect even
[59:25] as my Father in Heaven which is perfect
[59:28] only Perfection will weigh out on those
[59:30] scales and brother BR said how are you
[59:33] going to be a perfect people be married
[59:35] to a perfect bridegroom and live in a
[59:37] perfect place except for the perfect
[59:41] word so he's telling you the only way to
[59:44] weigh on these scales of judgment is
[59:46] this message is going to have to come
[59:48] into you this perfect word's going to
[59:50] have to live not as a Doctrine but as a
[59:53] life it's got to come into the church
[59:55] because because the church the world has
[59:57] been found warning amen and it doesn't
[1:00:00] weigh enough and thy kingdom is then
[1:00:02] divided and given unto the mes and the
[1:00:03] Persians right then right at that very
[1:00:06] hour there was something going on
[1:00:08] Babylon had been built into the standard
[1:00:10] of like the Garden of Eden and it was a
[1:00:12] city where the palace was in the center
[1:00:14] and a river run underneath those 200
[1:00:17] foot high walls that was a river run
[1:00:20] under those 80 foot thick walls and it
[1:00:23] was an exceptionally dry season that
[1:00:25] year
[1:00:27] and the Persians while they had besieged
[1:00:29] had secretly been out there
[1:00:32] digging a deter for that River to empty
[1:00:36] the channel that they could go under
[1:00:39] that wall so when when he looked out
[1:00:41] when Bel chazar looked out and said well
[1:00:43] they're all gone they've left the city
[1:00:45] they've run because of the Great and
[1:00:47] Mighty Babylon that wasn't what had
[1:00:48] happened they had went down into the
[1:00:50] riverbeds and they couldn't be seen and
[1:00:53] that night he went through a party to
[1:00:55] rejoice that they're all gone and while
[1:00:57] he was partying a supernatural sign said
[1:01:00] judgment has come Daniel had said your
[1:01:03] kingdom is leaving you in that same hour
[1:01:06] Persia come under them 80 foot thick
[1:01:10] walls and came straight to the Palace
[1:01:13] the Bible records that this man was
[1:01:15] killed that very night amen it wasn't a
[1:01:18] long time coming he was killed that very
[1:01:20] night but you know something that was
[1:01:22] powerful about this story the moment the
[1:01:25] Babylonian kingdom was killed amen it
[1:01:27] changed kingdoms same city same same
[1:01:31] setup same building same people
[1:01:33] everywhere but the kingdom had changed
[1:01:36] the authority had changed the
[1:01:38] dispensations had changed there had come
[1:01:41] an end to one and the beginning of
[1:01:43] another do you know what had happened
[1:01:45] Darius had been made King who was a me
[1:01:48] and he had a buddy who he was partners
[1:01:50] with was a Persian who was named was
[1:01:52] Cyrus have you ever read about King
[1:01:54] Cyrus King Cyrus had been predicted in
[1:01:57] Isaiah it was 600 years or 400 years
[1:02:01] before the fall of Babylon that that
[1:02:03] Isaiah prophesied that there would be
[1:02:06] Isaiah 45 exactly there would be a man
[1:02:08] whose name was Sirius who would come
[1:02:11] into the kingdom of Babylon and who
[1:02:14] would take over the gates of that
[1:02:16] Kingdom and would deliver the children
[1:02:18] of God can you imagine that God predict
[1:02:21] a deliverer who was a gentile who didn't
[1:02:23] even know God and say I'm going to send
[1:02:26] him in there and he's going to deliver
[1:02:28] you and not only will he deliver you
[1:02:30] he'll rebuild your temple he'll give you
[1:02:32] your Liberty he'll help you get back to
[1:02:34] your land your Exile days are over he
[1:02:36] said preacher what are you saying I'm
[1:02:38] saying when the supernatural appeared on
[1:02:40] the wall to one Kingdom it was a finish
[1:02:44] to one Kingdom it was an end it was a
[1:02:46] destruction it was the end of the system
[1:02:49] but to the other Kingdom it was the
[1:02:51] dawning of a new day the opening of The
[1:02:54] Seven Seals was not the end of the Bride
[1:02:56] it was the beginning of a bride age it
[1:02:59] was the beginning of a dispensation
[1:03:01] where the word of God was going to rule
[1:03:04] over the Church of God Amen we are not
[1:03:06] going into darkness but we have come out
[1:03:08] of dark Le oia and we have moved into
[1:03:11] the rising of the sun there has been
[1:03:13] another government issued upon the
[1:03:16] Church of the Living God I think about
[1:03:18] it this morning and I think about the
[1:03:20] ends of systems I think about the end of
[1:03:22] denomination I think about the end of
[1:03:25] the shock I think about the end of it it
[1:03:27] happened down there with Moses in the
[1:03:29] Bible when he went into Goan amen what
[1:03:32] was it his coming his Supernatural was
[1:03:35] the end to Pharaoh but it wasn't the end
[1:03:38] to the children of Israel it was the
[1:03:40] dawning of a new day the promise had
[1:03:42] come unto them the deliverer had come to
[1:03:45] their house I believe this morning
[1:03:47] church amen that this message of
[1:03:49] judgment is not a judgment upon the
[1:03:52] bride it's a judgment upon the world I
[1:03:55] believe the Supernatural means the world
[1:03:57] has come under judgment but the Church
[1:03:59] of the Living God has moved into a
[1:04:02] Rapture cycle where the anointing of God
[1:04:05] is upon their life we are at the
[1:04:08] place we're at the place Israel was when
[1:04:11] they returned back to their Homeland
[1:04:14] when they went back to rebuild the
[1:04:15] Temple when they went back to go back to
[1:04:18] the order of their worship you know what
[1:04:20] they had done sister terar when they
[1:04:22] went into captivity they had went by the
[1:04:24] willow trees and they had hung up their
[1:04:26] hearts and they went into captivity and
[1:04:29] them Hearts have been hanging there for
[1:04:31] 70 years amen but now that the
[1:04:34] supernatural sign had come they could
[1:04:36] turn around and they could go back and
[1:04:39] pick them Harps up on their way back
[1:04:41] home listen I believe that the hour of
[1:04:44] worship has come to the bride of Christ
[1:04:46] I I believe the Bible said when the book
[1:04:48] was opened up amen the Bible said they
[1:04:51] heard me John shouting they heard me on
[1:04:54] the earth and they heard me in the
[1:04:55] heaven
[1:04:56] and they heard me under the Earth what
[1:04:58] does the supernatural mean it means a
[1:05:00] day of worship for the Church of the
[1:05:02] Living God not worshiping under a
[1:05:05] Pentecostal Feast worshiping under amen
