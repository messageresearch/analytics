[0:00] It makes me want to
[0:02] shout
[0:04] hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[0:08] you're worthy of all the glory, all the
[0:13] honor and all the
[0:16] praise. Embrace me,
[0:19] [Applause]
[0:23] shout Jesus.
[0:29] [Music]
[0:34] Oh, it makes me
[0:44] [Music]
[0:48] All the honor and all the
[0:51] [Music]
[0:53] praise. When I think about the
[0:58] Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me,
[1:04] how he filled me with the Holy Ghost,
[1:08] how he healed me to the uttermost. When
[1:13] I think about the Lord, how he picked
[1:17] me, how he turned
[1:20] me, how he
[1:24] I feel
[1:25] [Applause]
[1:33] [Music]
[1:37] sorry. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:46] [Music]
[1:59] Heat.
[2:02] [Music]
[2:08] Heat. Yeah.
[2:19] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:43] Hallelujah. If you're
[2:45] [Applause]
[2:46] living for life this
[2:50] morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We gave
[2:53] ourselves to the world while we were
[2:55] there, but I'm no longer a part of that.
[2:57] Amen. I'm so thankful for life this
[3:00] morning, for the power of the Holy Ghost
[3:03] that would come into our lives. And
[3:05] Amen. I'm so thankful for what God has
[3:08] done. Amen. And how how could we deny
[3:11] that he has done a work in our lives.
[3:14] Amen. And I just want to thank him for
[3:16] his mercy and his grace. And what a
[3:19] tremendous uh time to serve the Lord
[3:21] today and a great honor to be here on
[3:25] this beautiful Mother's Day. Uh I just
[3:27] wonder maybe it's a it's just a special
[3:30] feeling in the church today. I'm all
[3:32] these wonderful mothers and and uh just
[3:35] the spirit around them and Amen. I just
[3:38] wonder if we could just bow our hearts
[3:39] together today and let's have a word of
[3:41] prayer just before we go into the
[3:42] scripture. Amen. And we just want to
[3:44] thank the Lord. Father, I want to thank
[3:47] you for motherhood, Lord, for that that
[3:50] office, Lord, that you have disposed
[3:52] upon this generation. And Lord, we know
[3:57] that Lord, as every other office, Lord,
[3:59] it's been tore out and destroyed. And
[4:02] the enemy has tried to do everything.
[4:04] You sent a prophet to tell us that it
[4:07] was Satan himself had recognized that it
[4:10] was a time to reckon, but Lord, you
[4:14] always have a witness.
[4:17] Lord, you always have one. You preserve,
[4:20] Lord, to show what it is, what that real
[4:22] office is, and what it looks like to
[4:24] have a mother. We thank you for every
[4:26] one of them this morning. Lord, we thank
[4:28] you for the gift that you have placed in
[4:30] them. Now, Lord, as we have gathered
[4:32] here, of course, we look at these
[4:35] mothers in the natural, but but Father,
[4:37] this tabernacle here is a mother in the
[4:40] spiritual.
[4:41] She is mothering, brooding over young
[4:43] children, birthing and teaching and
[4:46] bringing forth in this age. And we know
[4:49] there's been so much perversion around
[4:51] churches and their teachings and ideas
[4:53] throughout the age, Lord. But Father, I
[4:55] pray that she remains a light. She
[4:58] remains a light, Lord, of what it looks
[5:00] like to come into the house of God and
[5:02] feel the power and the inspiration of
[5:05] your word as it moves across the great
[5:07] anointing of God. We ask you, Father,
[5:10] this morning that you would bless them.
[5:12] Bless everyone that's gathered here in
[5:14] this building. May your word speak to
[5:15] them today. Help us get out of the way,
[5:18] Lord, that you may use us to edify your
[5:20] children. We ask it in the mighty name
[5:22] of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And
[5:26] amen. And God bless you this morning.
[5:28] And I would like to go into the
[5:30] scripture in the book of Revelations.
[5:31] And I want to read the sixth chapter.
[5:34] And I'm going to just read these first
[5:35] few verses um as I have been uh working
[5:39] in them. Uh chapter 6 verses
[5:43] uh I want to read the third verse here.
[5:46] We'll just read verses 1 to 4 and just
[5:49] include
[5:53] it. And I saw when the lamb had opened
[5:56] one of the seals and I heard as it was
[5:59] the noise of a thunder.
[6:02] Now because the thunders have sounded we
[6:06] know that word thunder it's symbology
[6:10] for voice
[6:13] right and as I heard as it was the noise
[6:15] of a a voice one of the four beasts
[6:18] saying come and see of course we know
[6:20] that's one of the four creatures from
[6:22] the book of revelations the fourth
[6:23] chapter it's the lion and I said and
[6:26] behold a white horse now white horse is
[6:29] symbology for the antichrist spirit
[6:31] that rode out from the days of Paul
[6:34] against the word of God. And he that sat
[6:36] on him had a bow, and it is apparent not
[6:39] what is written, but what isn't. He had
[6:41] a bow, but no arrows. It was a bluff.
[6:43] He's a liar. And he and a crown was
[6:48] given unto him. So he wrote 300 years
[6:50] without a crown until AD 325. in Nika.
[6:53] He was crowned under Constantine when
[6:56] they had the Nyian council and they
[6:58] elected a pope and he went forth
[7:01] conquering and to conquer. So then
[7:04] therefore he started nickelism to
[7:07] conquer the churches where men could
[7:08] rule over them. Now I'm doing this
[7:11] because uh as we've been teaching the
[7:13] last few weeks, I want you to see that
[7:15] you're learning this uh Revelations the
[7:17] 6th chapter verse by verse at this
[7:19] point. Amen. And when he had opened the
[7:23] second seal, I heard the second beast
[7:26] say. Now here's your ox anointing, come
[7:28] and see. And there went out another
[7:31] horse. And that was red. Now we're
[7:34] speaking of the time that in AD30 under
[7:37] the edict of Thessalonica, they began to
[7:40] enforce that the Roman Catholic Church
[7:42] trinitarian doctrine was the only type
[7:46] of Christianity that you could practice.
[7:49] Every other thing was called heresy. So
[7:53] spirit-led, spirit manifesting,
[7:56] tongue-alking, Holy Ghost filled people
[7:58] were killed as heretics under this red
[8:02] horse. And the power was given to him
[8:04] that he set therein to take peace from
[8:06] the earth, and that they should kill one
[8:08] another. And there was given unto him a
[8:11] great sword. May God bless his word as
[8:13] you could be seated this morning. Amen.
[8:16] Uh it is Mother's Day.
[8:23] [Music]
[8:27] 540509, a Mother's Day message, the
[8:30] invasion of the United States of
[8:32] [Laughter]
[8:32] [Music]
[8:34] America. Seriously, Brother Bram said,
[8:37] "Maybe brother Neville will bring a
[8:39] nicer message
[8:40] tonight. Since we don't have a second
[8:43] service, I'm going to have to close
[8:44] differently than I start.
[8:48] Brother Ram says to you little mothers
[8:50] here this morning that's been real
[8:52] mothers. I know there's many of you and
[8:54] I think of every one of you. Let me tell
[8:56] you something. God bless you. You're the
[8:59] fifth gospel.
[9:01] You're the fifth gospel. There's
[9:02] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Mama. Let
[9:06] me tell you, mama's gospel is powerful.
[9:10] As the saying goes, the hand that rocks
[9:12] the cradle rules the world.
[9:15] Now, brother Brandham will take this
[9:17] saying in just another paragraph below.
[9:19] He'll say, "Remember when Moses was a
[9:22] little boy, his mother gave him
[9:24] instruction, and it was a godly mother
[9:26] that took little Moses on her knees, and
[9:28] Moses taught him all. He was her he he
[9:32] was her teacher, or she was his teacher,
[9:34] rather. And under Pharaoh, now these
[9:37] things, see, Moses, someday, you're
[9:40] going to deliver the children of Israel.
[9:43] You're the boy that's called keep
[9:45] yourself pure and unspotted from the
[9:47] world. You're the one now. Right in
[9:50] Pharaoh's house, this woman was teaching
[9:53] her son different than what Pharaoh was
[9:55] teaching him. You're the one you're
[9:58] going to deliver your children, the
[9:59] children from this place. Now, no other
[10:02] place do we know where he ever went to
[10:05] in his seminary. All of his teaching he
[10:08] ever got. He stayed right there in
[10:10] Phthalo's palace, which was heathen. But
[10:13] his mother taught him. Look at the power
[10:16] of this mother in Pharaoh's house. He
[10:18] never had no seminary. But his mother
[10:20] taught him. And that's a real mother.
[10:23] She taught him the precepts of the Lord.
[10:26] She told him how he must be holy. She
[10:28] told him how and what he must live and
[10:31] what he must do and would do for him.
[10:34] And God and it stuck with Moses all the
[10:37] days of his life. And any true loyal
[10:40] mother that'll ever take little babies
[10:42] instead of sending them to a picture
[10:44] show or a dance or so forth and she'll
[10:47] put them on her lap and teach them about
[10:49] the Lord Jesus. And here the other day
[10:51] he said, "I was talking to a mother on
[10:52] the telephone and brother," she said,
[10:54] "Brother Billy, my poor boy's in
[10:56] trouble." I said, "Oh, what trouble's he
[10:58] in?" And she said, "Well, I know about
[11:00] it, sister dear." And she said, "Oh,
[11:02] he's wrong, brother. I don't know. He
[11:04] said, "She says this, one says this and
[11:07] one says that." And and he says, "But
[11:09] she says, mother says, no matter what,
[11:12] whether he's wrong or not, I love him."
[11:15] Yeah. And there you are. I love him. He
[11:17] said to his mother, "I've been so
[11:19] deceived by these things, mother. I
[11:21] believe that you're the only sweetheart
[11:22] I really have." Ain't that nice when a
[11:25] boy sees his mama as a sweetheart? Amen.
[11:28] Now, it she's a she's a real friend to
[11:31] you. And I'll tell you that from being
[11:33] 50 years old, you never quit being a
[11:35] mama's baby. They love you your whole
[11:37] life. Amen. That's a real mother's love.
[11:40] See, they'll put their arms around their
[11:42] baby. Now, regardless of whether they're
[11:44] right or whether they're wrong, and she
[11:46] goes right on. Amen. If a mother can
[11:48] think of that of her baby, how much more
[11:52] can God think of his, you stay right
[11:54] with him? Now, there was another mother
[11:57] in the Bible. Amen. And there was a
[11:59] mother called Herodia and she taught her
[12:01] daughter how to tap dance because she
[12:04] wanted her to be popular. And she danced
[12:06] before the king but then required the
[12:09] head of John the Baptist. And we are
[12:11] recorded of 70 of her offsprings. This
[12:14] damsel that danced before Herodous
[12:16] daughter danced before Herod. 70 of her
[12:19] offsprings either they were prostitutes
[12:21] or went to the gallows. Amen. Now watch
[12:24] what happened. Here's a mother that
[12:26] motherthered Moses in the house of
[12:28] Pharaoh. Amen. And look, he becomes such
[12:30] a man. One mother taught her taught hers
[12:33] the things of the world. The other
[12:35] mother taught the things of God. One
[12:37] become a leader and a conqueror. Amen.
[12:40] And is a mortal among men today. And the
[12:43] other is debed and in hell and taken
[12:46] thousands times thousands withered. Do
[12:48] you see what I mean? Bring up a child in
[12:51] the way that it should go. Amen. bring
[12:54] up a child in the way it'll go. If it
[12:56] goes, it won't depart. It'll come back.
[12:58] Amen. Just keep that teaching right now.
[13:01] I want to maybe just move over in the
[13:03] scripture for a moment as we're going to
[13:04] continue on this revelations contained
[13:07] under the seals. Amen. I I hope this has
[13:10] been okay study with you all. I
[13:12] certainly have been immensely personally
[13:14] blessed because of the studies of
[13:16] things. And I don't know uh how many of
[13:18] you uh study scripture with history and
[13:20] and with the seal book and things, but I
[13:23] I was just telling Cararissa on the way
[13:24] this morning uh I I I've I've studied
[13:27] the seal book very strongly in the
[13:28] church age book and heard the tapes and
[13:30] went through the Bible, but I've never
[13:32] uh really dug so deeply in history as I
[13:35] have recently. Uh but it's amazing to me
[13:37] because if you if you really get into
[13:39] the history of the world, you actually
[13:42] think that that John must have been
[13:44] writing this in consecutive with it the
[13:48] history happening and then him writing
[13:50] it. But he actually wrote these things,
[13:52] some of them 500, a thousand years and
[13:55] in our case 2,000 years before they ever
[13:58] happened. But he he wrote them with more
[14:01] accuracy than the historians could write
[14:03] them because he knew the motive behind
[14:06] what was actually happening. His
[14:08] revelation is actually more accurate
[14:10] than the historians that recorded. And I
[14:12] can prove that by the Bible because
[14:14] Paul's revelation was more accurate than
[14:16] Peter. Amen. Who was right there with
[14:19] Jesus. Amen. But Paul had a revelation
[14:21] that was more accurate and actually said
[14:23] it was so accurate that he said anybody
[14:25] that would argue with my revelation let
[14:27] them be cursed. Amen. So the revelation
[14:29] is more accurate than the historians or
[14:32] uh even what the church wants to relate.
[14:35] Amen. The revelation is the accurate
[14:38] part because they some took it one way
[14:39] and some took it another and read one
[14:41] historian it says this and another says
[14:43] this but the accurate part of it is the
[14:45] revelation of what really happened and
[14:48] what was really behind what was
[14:50] happening. Now amen. Uh if you were here
[14:53] with us Thursday night, we dug deeply
[14:54] into Revelations the 13th chapter and we
[14:57] was speaking of the Roman Empire and the
[15:00] changing of the Roman Empire from
[15:02] paganism unto papal Rome and how that it
[15:06] influenced the denominational era of the
[15:08] Protestant churches which never were
[15:11] even in existence until after Martin
[15:14] Luther. If you go back and look at all
[15:15] the history records and out of Luther it
[15:17] came swingly and then the Baptist and
[15:19] the Anabaptist and and on and on came.
[15:22] So denominational as you know it today
[15:24] was only birthed after the times of
[15:27] Martin Luther. Now we we want to if we
[15:29] can go into Revelations the 17th chapter
[15:32] with you and and let's read the first
[15:34] verse. Amen. Now because we're we're
[15:37] looking at the second seal there and
[15:38] we've been studying deeply on the red
[15:40] horse. Amen. And there came one of the
[15:42] seven angels. Amen. that had the seven
[15:45] vows and talked with me, saying, "Come
[15:47] hither, and I will show unto thee the
[15:50] judgment." Now, look at that. He's going
[15:52] to show the judgment of the great
[15:55] So, when you read Revelations 18, you're
[15:57] going to read about the judgment of this
[16:00] of of Can I just call it a prostitute?
[16:02] Would that be all right with you all?
[16:03] Amen. And and but you're going to read
[16:05] about this prostitute. Amen. And and the
[16:07] Bible says, "Come hither and I will show
[16:10] unto thee the judgment of this
[16:11] prostitute that setth upon many waters."
[16:14] Now, first thing we got to do is
[16:16] discover who is this and what is the
[16:19] waters she's sitting on. Now, number
[16:21] one, we recognize that this uh brother
[16:23] Bam calls it a prostitute or a He
[16:26] said, "Excuse me, but that's the
[16:27] language of the Bible. But she's a foul
[16:29] woman, and I hate to say the word, but
[16:31] it's written here. It's a woman that
[16:33] professes to be a good woman and commits
[16:36] adultery with other men. Now, if a woman
[16:39] then represents a church, then it's a
[16:42] church that professes to be Christian
[16:44] but commits adultery in other things.
[16:48] So, what you're reading about is a a
[16:50] great prostitute is a woman. It's a
[16:52] church. But this woman is not a clean
[16:54] woman. She's a she's a church, but she
[16:57] has brought in other lovers. Amen. In
[16:59] other words, Amen. She is uh says that
[17:02] she's clean. She says that she is a a
[17:04] pure virtuous, the only church, the only
[17:07] people, but really she's committed
[17:10] adultery with other things and she has
[17:12] brought in uncleanness. Now, of course,
[17:15] uh uncleanness would speak of
[17:17] fornication or adulteries. In other
[17:20] words, she has other lovers. Amen. Now,
[17:22] it's it's uh as the scripture says, this
[17:25] woman then siteth upon many waters. Now,
[17:29] if you're a Bible reader, you can just
[17:30] look right across the page in Revelation
[17:33] 17 and 15. And the Bible says, "And the
[17:35] waters which thou sawest where the horse
[17:37] siteth are the peoples and multitudes
[17:40] and nations and tongues." So, she setth
[17:42] upon many people. Now, we read
[17:44] Revelations 13 and1 on Thursday night
[17:47] and showed you that there was a beast
[17:49] that come up out of the sea. Remember
[17:51] her? That beast that come up out of the
[17:53] sea is Revelations 13. We see that now
[17:56] the Bible's revealing in Revelation 17
[17:59] her judgment as she set it upon many
[18:02] waters. Now let's move into this next
[18:04] verse here if we can. And the scripture
[18:06] says, "In whom the kings of the earth
[18:08] have committed fornication, and the
[18:11] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[18:14] drunk with the wine of her fornication."
[18:16] Now the kings of the earth have
[18:19] committed fornication. So whoever this
[18:21] woman is, this this church that is
[18:23] unclean, she has not been alone in her
[18:26] fornication. She has not committed
[18:29] adultery by herself. But the Bible says
[18:32] the kings of the earth have committed
[18:35] this with her. Now if you know a
[18:37] history, and this is where history gets
[18:39] very interesting to me, is you look at
[18:41] this Roman Catholic church which is
[18:43] speaking of, you'll find out that she
[18:46] committed fornications with the kings of
[18:48] the earth. Now uh it's a it's a great
[18:50] study. Amen. Meaning that she
[18:53] intermingled her religion with the kings
[18:55] of the earth. Now uh when when you uh
[18:58] study uh history, you'll find that in
[19:01] the 88 800s was a king named
[19:03] Charlemagne. How many is relevant with
[19:05] Charlemagne? You know who Charlemagne
[19:06] is? Charlemagne was a Frankish king
[19:09] which kind of when Yeah, of course.
[19:11] Amen. That's some of his favorite
[19:13] studying. Amen. when a Frankish king who
[19:15] was when France and Germany basically
[19:18] were one kingdom. Amen. There was a king
[19:20] named Charlemagne that was over them.
[19:22] Amen. But but something special about
[19:25] Charlemagne in church history is he was
[19:27] the first ever king to travel to Rome to
[19:31] be uh uh to be crowned by the pope. So
[19:34] in December uh uh 25th which would been
[19:37] Christmas day in 800, Charlemagne become
[19:40] crowned by a pope. Now the problem with
[19:43] this is is anytime somebody puts a crown
[19:46] on your head that means they had power
[19:48] to do it. So that crown then existed
[19:51] under the power of the Roman church and
[19:54] France was influenced by the influence
[19:57] of the Roman church. So the kings of the
[20:00] earth. Now they began this and actually
[20:02] for over a thousand years the Roman
[20:05] Catholic Church placed crowns upon
[20:07] king's heads all throughout Europe. Can
[20:10] you imagine that? The Roman church was
[20:12] putting authority upon kings to be kings
[20:16] upon the earth. See, what they were
[20:18] doing was teaching they had authority in
[20:21] the in the world that they were they
[20:23] were the one. If they said you were
[20:24] king, you were king. But see, they
[20:26] wasn't innocent in what they were doing
[20:29] because they wanted the inhabitants of
[20:31] the earth to drink of their wine. They
[20:34] wanted they wanted everybody to take the
[20:36] Kool-Aid. Can we say it better this way?
[20:38] They wanted to intoxicate the world. So
[20:41] the way to get the inhabitants of the
[20:44] earth was to get the kings of the earth.
[20:47] If I can get the kings, I can get the
[20:49] people under them. Because if we give
[20:51] the king enough power, then he'll make
[20:54] the people come subject to the Roman
[20:57] church and we'll never have to even
[20:59] raise a hand. Now, Charlemagne, amen,
[21:01] was the king. And and if you look into
[21:03] history, it's a pretty bad it's a pretty
[21:05] bad uh thing because uh according to
[21:08] history, Charlemagne killed masses in
[21:11] the name of Christianity. Amen. It it
[21:13] How many knows who the Saxons are? Amen.
[21:17] As in
[21:18] Anglo-Saxons. Amen. The Saxons were at
[21:20] one time in Germany under the Frankish
[21:23] rule, the Germanic people that before
[21:25] they moved to England, who now we are
[21:27] Anglo-Saxons from England. But before
[21:29] that time, they were there and
[21:31] Charlemagne, amen, decided everybody was
[21:33] going to become Christians. So he began
[21:35] to put pressure on the people to become
[21:38] Christians. Now it's easy when you're
[21:40] reading history because they make it as
[21:42] though they were pagans and Christians.
[21:45] But see, that's not accurate history
[21:47] because the revelation will teach you
[21:49] that there was a lot of people who were
[21:51] being killed as pagans were heretic and
[21:55] they were heretics, but they really
[21:57] wasn't. They were really the original
[22:00] church. Amen. That was worshiping God
[22:04] under the dictates of their hearts
[22:06] according to the teachings of the Bible.
[22:08] Amen. But this Roman church under these
[22:10] kings decided you will only worship
[22:13] under this formal religion of the
[22:15] trinitarian doctrine of the Roman
[22:17] Catholic Church. And if you don't, we
[22:20] will kill you. This this one king,
[22:23] Charlemagne, I don't have time to preach
[22:25] all of them, but I'll I'll show you this
[22:26] one. Charlemagne actively promoted
[22:29] Christianity. In some cases, used force
[22:32] to spread, particularly during his
[22:34] campaigns against the Saxons. He is
[22:36] known He is known for the for the
[22:39] massacre of Verdon where he killed
[22:43] 4,500 so-called pagans in one slaughter.
[22:48] Amen. He he ruled over 4,500 at one time
[22:52] and said, "You're all pagans. You're
[22:54] going to die." And you know why they
[22:55] were dying? Because they wouldn't take a
[22:58] trinitarian baptism of the name of the
[23:01] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Now, isn't
[23:03] that something? Amen. and and how now
[23:06] it's it's in history. Amen. Charlemagne
[23:09] had a zeal and a military prowess that
[23:11] led to forced conversions of many
[23:14] non-Christian populations, expanding his
[23:16] empire and the Roman Empire. He viewed
[23:20] Christianity as a crucial vision to the
[23:23] United Kingdom and how he could bring
[23:26] all his subjects into the Christian
[23:28] fold. What a wonderful evangelist he
[23:30] was.
[23:32] Amen. the massacre of Verdon. Amen.
[23:35] During the Saxon Wars where Frankish
[23:37] King Charlemagne ordered 4,500 in
[23:39] October of 782. Amen. He done it under
[23:43] this one law. And I can't speak Latin
[23:45] and I'm not going to try to give you
[23:46] he'll be Latin, but this is the law. And
[23:48] I I can't pronounce the name of it, but
[23:50] I'll read the law to you. If anyone of
[23:52] the race of these Saxons hereafter
[23:55] concealed among them, shall have wished
[23:57] to hide himself
[23:59] unbaptized, he shall scorn to come to
[24:02] baptism, and shall have wished to remain
[24:05] a pagan, let him be punished by death.
[24:09] Anybody that wouldn't climb under the
[24:12] sprinkling spout of the Roman church and
[24:15] be baptized in trinitarian doctrine, let
[24:18] him be put to death. Now we wonder how
[24:21] that the trinitarian doctrine of the
[24:23] father, son, and holy ghost gain such
[24:25] power when they read the Christian books
[24:27] and and and today when brother Brandham
[24:29] under the seals begin to teach the
[24:30] doctrine of the oneness of the godhead
[24:32] and the baptism of the name of the Lord
[24:34] Jesus Christ, people begin to look back
[24:35] in history and said, "Well, they
[24:37] baptized this way back in 300s and 800s
[24:40] and 900s." Well, of course they did
[24:42] because everybody that didn't died.
[24:45] Amen. But you got to take history back a
[24:47] little further than the 800s. You got to
[24:49] go back further than the 300s. Go back
[24:52] to the book of Acts with the apostles
[24:55] with the foundation of this church. And
[24:57] Paul said, "Let every teaching of the
[24:59] church, let every teaching, if he'd be
[25:01] an angel that would come from heaven or
[25:03] anybody else and would say something
[25:06] different than I say, let him be
[25:07] accursed." Amen. Because what we were
[25:10] finding that was Paul. You find me one
[25:13] place in this Bible where Paul ever
[25:15] taught trinitarianism or he ever
[25:18] baptized in the name of the father, son,
[25:20] and holy ghost or he ever taught
[25:22] organization or
[25:23] denominationalism. It's not in the
[25:26] Bible. Can I say it the way Jesus said
[25:28] it? It's not so from the beginning. But
[25:32] what they did is they so hybridized it
[25:34] and anybody that didn't believe their
[25:36] hybrid religion was going to die till
[25:38] they thought they could stomp it out and
[25:40] they could kill it out. Oh, that God has
[25:42] always had somewhere. He's had a little
[25:45] group somewhere that he would hide the
[25:47] truth in life. And in the middle of the
[25:50] persecutions, in the middle of the
[25:52] inquisitions, in the middle of the red
[25:54] horse riding to stomp out all truth,
[25:57] there was a mother. There was a
[25:59] beautiful woman called the bride
[26:02] that held the sacred virtues of the word
[26:05] of God. Amen.
[26:08] My hallelujah.
[26:11] Yes, sir. And the kings of the
[26:13] earth committed this with her. Can you
[26:16] imagine the fornications and the
[26:18] adultery, the twisting
[26:22] of the word of God? They took it from
[26:25] the hands of the people and put it in
[26:28] the
[26:29] control of the ministry. Yes.
[26:33] Now, this is why the white horse was so
[26:35] powerful is because his lie of nickelism
[26:39] was so wrong.
[26:41] But it was taught so it was so innocent.
[26:46] It was so innocent. Come on.
[26:48] Now you watch and see the scripture
[26:51] says that her
[26:54] fornications, the
[26:56] inhabitants of the
[26:58] earth drank with the
[27:02] wine of her fornication. They were
[27:04] intoxicated.
[27:07] They were intoxicated with this false
[27:09] teachings.
[27:11] Loved it.
[27:13] Now the Bible says that he carried me in
[27:16] a way in the spirit into the wilderness
[27:18] and I saw a woman. There's your church
[27:21] and she set upon a scarlet colored
[27:24] beast and there it is right there's your
[27:27] Roman Empire. There's that beast. That
[27:29] woman said on that beast and it had full
[27:32] of names of
[27:33] blasphemy. We are the ones.
[27:36] Our church is the right church. That's
[27:38] right. You got to watch that one, don't
[27:41] you? Cuz that's not just in the history
[27:44] books. You hear that in modern days?
[27:47] You don't come to our church, you can't
[27:49] even be saved.
[27:52] Well, if you're not under my ministry,
[27:54] you'll never get the rapture.
[27:57] Well, that's a lie out of the pits of
[27:59] hell.
[28:01] There'll be a bride. There'll be a
[28:03] virgin bride. She'll be
[28:05] worldwide because she's elected from the
[28:09] foundation of the world. You don't go in
[28:11] the rapture because you come to True Her
[28:13] Tabernacle. You're going to be in the
[28:15] rapture because your name was in the
[28:17] Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation
[28:20] of the world. It's not It's not Wayne
[28:23] Lawson. Amen. Or Brother Ericson or one
[28:25] of these men of God. And anytime Oh my
[28:28] goodness. It's a nickel in spirit,
[28:31] folks. Brother Bam said it back there.
[28:33] They told somebody he was going to
[28:34] baptize them. They said, they told me if
[28:36] I get baptized that way, they was going
[28:38] to take my name off of the book. Brother
[28:39] said, "What difference does that make?"
[28:41] And they said, "Well, if your name
[28:42] wasn't on the book, you couldn't go to
[28:44] heaven." Amen. I tell you what, I don't
[28:46] care if my name's on any church book as
[28:49] long as it's in the Lamb's Book of Life,
[28:52] what difference does it really make?
[28:54] Because if your name is in the Lamb's
[28:56] Book of Life, God will move heaven and
[28:59] earth to put you in the rapture. Let me
[29:01] say it like this. If your name is there
[29:03] and you know it's there, you say, "How
[29:05] do I know it's there?" Because the Bible
[29:08] teaches us, amen, that you can see your
[29:10] name by the preaching of this mystery of
[29:13] this end time. When you recognize this
[29:16] word to be eagle food, you have heard
[29:18] from your theophony. You have recognized
[29:21] your name on the lamb's book of life.
[29:23] Amen. And my name ain't no church book
[29:25] and it ain't no denomination and it
[29:27] ain't on a preachers's list and it ain't
[29:29] a part of a membership, but my name has
[29:32] been written in the lamb's book of life
[29:34] where God has birthed us in this age.
[29:38] Hallelujah.
[29:39] What a devil. What a what a stinking old
[29:42] rotten devil to take the glory out of
[29:43] the blood and out of the Holy Ghost and
[29:45] put it in some church.
[29:48] Join our church and you'll be saved.
[29:51] That's a lie. That's right. That's
[29:53] right.
[29:55] Brother Brand preaches it in thinking
[29:56] man's filter if you want to. He he makes
[29:59] it. Here's the way he describes it.
[30:02] Smoking a filtered cigarette opposed to
[30:05] smoking an unfiltered cigarette.
[30:09] If you had a picture of lungs of an
[30:12] unfiltered cigarette smoker and you had
[30:15] the picture of lungs of a filtered
[30:17] cigarette smoker, they look the same.
[30:22] filtered or unfiltered, they're a
[30:23] cigarette smoker.
[30:26] You take the soul of an unbeliever in
[30:30] the world and you take the soul of an
[30:32] unbeliever in a church and you look at
[30:35] their soul and it's the same whether
[30:37] it's filtered or unfiltered.
[30:40] Cuz the only way to change that soul is
[30:43] by the new birth of the baptism of the
[30:45] Holy Ghost.
[30:49] There's no other way, folks. Amen. It
[30:52] ain't filtered or unfiltered. It's born
[30:54] or unborn.
[30:56] It ain't the church you join.
[30:59] Glory.
[31:01] You see those those things come up in
[31:03] there. And this color scarlet colored
[31:06] beast was full of this blasphemy.
[31:08] We're the one. And brother Bam quotes
[31:11] that we're the one. They were the people
[31:12] were drunk on the church is the only
[31:15] church. The Catholic church is the only
[31:16] church. And the kings were killing
[31:18] people that didn't agree with that. My
[31:21] church is the only church. If you don't
[31:22] like it, I'll kill you.
[31:27] Now, this woman was arrayed in purple
[31:29] and scarlet. Now, of course, this is
[31:31] dealing with with her her royalty and
[31:34] her beauty, and she's decked with gold
[31:38] and precious stones. I've been over
[31:39] there. I saw it. She's decked with gold.
[31:41] Yeah, they got more gold over there.
[31:45] I saw one rug. They had it hanging on
[31:47] the wall. Uh they don't call them rugs,
[31:50] I don't think. But
[31:52] what? That's hillbilly. You know, they
[31:56] don't call them rugs. This This thing
[31:58] had a hundred kilos of gold in it. The
[32:02] threading it threaded in with 100 kilos
[32:04] of gold. I done the figures. Just the
[32:06] just the gold in the rug without
[32:09] antiquity value. It was worth $10
[32:11] million.
[32:13] That was just one rug.
[32:18] You talk about decked with gold.
[32:21] All right. The greatest artwork in the
[32:23] world, the most ancient museums, the
[32:26] greatest the wealth of the world. I
[32:28] asked my tour guide. I said, "What's
[32:29] this Vatican worth?" He said, "It's
[32:31] worth more than any other country in the
[32:32] world." Wow. 100 acres. Wow. 100 acres.
[32:37] But a city,
[32:39] 18th verse of Revelation 17, but a city
[32:42] that reignth over kings.
[32:46] Where is there another city that reignth
[32:49] over kings?
[32:52] She carried me away, and I saw this
[32:53] woman sitting on the scarlet beast full
[32:55] of names and blasphemy, having seven
[32:57] heads and 10 horns. Seven heads. The
[32:59] seven hills of Rome. I saw them. Yes,
[33:01] sir. The seven heads. You'll find also
[33:04] speak of the dictators and the emperors
[33:06] before the switch of pagan to paple. We
[33:09] got the actual names if you'd like them.
[33:11] The 10 horns speak of the 10 toes of the
[33:13] 10 kingdoms of Daniel's vision. And the
[33:16] woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
[33:18] and decked with gold and precious stones
[33:20] and pearls and having a golden cup in
[33:24] her hand full of the abominations and
[33:26] the filthiness and the fornication.
[33:28] Here's what she was the given to the
[33:31] inhabitants of the earth was this cup of
[33:34] abomination. And and it could I call it
[33:36] the cup of iniquity?
[33:39] And the people were drinking. Didn't
[33:41] Didn't they ask Jesus to drink of his
[33:43] cup? When he was on the earth, they
[33:45] said, "We we want to drink of your cup."
[33:47] And Jesus said, "You could drink of my
[33:48] cup." Remember that? You can drink of
[33:51] the cup. So to drink of the cup of the
[33:53] word, amen is to drink of it, to
[33:55] participate, to receive it, to Drink the
[33:58] Kool-Aid. That's modern language.
[34:01] You drink it. You're drinking the
[34:02] Kool-Aid. Now, we say it with a um how
[34:04] could I say it? With a negative
[34:06] connation because we mean it in a
[34:07] negative way. Amen. That but we find out
[34:10] this that we see the golden cup and the
[34:13] handful of abominations and filthies and
[34:15] fornications. And upon her
[34:18] forehead was a name
[34:21] written mystery Babylon. Now, now this
[34:24] church has got the name of mystery
[34:26] Babylon. Now Babylon is a city which has
[34:29] existed long before it which was
[34:31] important and and John would have
[34:33] understood Babylon because Babylon would
[34:35] have been
[34:37] amen that region of the world but
[34:39] Babylon why mystery Babylon is because
[34:42] it's a church. It's a religion but it is
[34:45] a Christian so-called church but it has
[34:49] the teachings of Babylon in it.
[34:52] Now I could give you maybe a little
[34:54] history lesson. I'm not going to, but
[34:56] this is where and I'll tie it to a
[34:58] scripture. You can look at it later, but
[35:00] look in your Pergamus church age and see
[35:02] what the prophet said about the seed of
[35:04] Satan and how the Adalas wield the
[35:07] Babylonian religion to the Roman Empire
[35:12] before it was papal Rome. The Roman
[35:15] Empire became Babylonian in its worship.
[35:19] And we find then that's how Babylon got
[35:22] into the Catholic Church because the
[35:24] Roman Empire had the Babylonian worship.
[35:27] They had all the idols. Uh I was just
[35:29] with a uh she had two doctorate degrees,
[35:32] a historian over there when I was doing
[35:34] that tour and and we were discussing
[35:36] some of these things and she said,
[35:37] "Well, where do you think happened to
[35:39] all the
[35:41] pagans?" She said, "They didn't just
[35:43] disappear."
[35:44] I said, "No, I know what happened to
[35:46] them. Come on now. It's just like you
[35:48] remember years ago when when uh we
[35:50] invaded Iraq, America, we her shame and
[35:53] her glory. We we did it. We was in Iraq
[35:56] and remember they had like a big old
[35:57] huge standing army. Y'all remember that?
[35:59] And the army was coming, but when the
[36:01] when the Americans uh that was in my
[36:03] day, I guess back in the early 90s, but
[36:05] when the Americans went in real strong
[36:07] and they started taking Well, Chris, the
[36:09] army disappeared. Yeah. Remember that
[36:12] Vernon? You remember that? The army
[36:13] disappeared. What happened to the army?
[36:15] They just took off their their army
[36:17] clothes and put on their regular clothes
[36:18] and said, "I'm just a regular Joe."
[36:22] And the pagans just took off their pagan
[36:24] robes and put on their papa robes. They
[36:27] didn't go anywhere. They just changed
[36:30] their approach. Do you see what what
[36:33] what what happens is upon the name is
[36:35] written mystery Babylon. Now watch the
[36:38] great the mother of harlots. Now this is
[36:40] amazing to me because you watch in the
[36:42] verse one. She is a great that
[36:45] sets upon many waters. But by verse
[36:47] five, it's calling her a mother. And
[36:50] she's mothering not sons, but churches.
[36:54] And those churches are not virgin
[36:56] churches. They're harlot churches.
[36:59] She's now went from being a to
[37:02] being a mother,
[37:06] bringing forth denominations. Look what
[37:08] it is. It's an abomination to the earth.
[37:11] And I saw this woman was drunken with
[37:13] the blood of the saints, which the blood
[37:16] of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her,
[37:19] I wondered with great admiration. Amen.
[37:22] Isn't it amazing that when he begins to
[37:24] look at her, Amen, he actually sees that
[37:27] she has drunk. Amen. She has drunk with
[37:30] the wine of the blood of the saints
[37:33] because she is the one by her doctrine
[37:36] by her giving forth of this cup she was
[37:39] bringing the people under death. Now if
[37:42] you watch she is full of doctrine. Now
[37:45] you say preacher really what is the
[37:47] doctrine that you're speaking of? Can I
[37:49] just specifically give you two two
[37:51] elements of doctrine that causes a
[37:54] church to become like this one in the
[37:55] Bible?
[37:57] There are two elements of this and
[37:58] you'll find them in the book of
[37:59] revelations under the Pergamus age and
[38:01] you'll find Revelations 2 and verse1 14
[38:04] and verse1 15 in the Pergamus age which
[38:06] is the per Can you put that picture up
[38:08] if you can the Pergamus age aligning
[38:10] with the horse riders you can see that
[38:12] under the second seal I'm just showing
[38:15] you this so it can tie together the
[38:16] seals uh with the church ages for you in
[38:19] your mind that second seal which is the
[38:21] red horse rider watch it fall under the
[38:23] pagamus and the thyrian age and at the
[38:25] end of the thyroid age, the black horse
[38:27] begins to ride. So if you're looking in
[38:29] your church age book, you're looking at
[38:31] Pergamus and Thitara as the red horse
[38:33] rider, which is also Revelations the 2nd
[38:36] chapter, the 14th verse. And watch what
[38:38] it was that God had against the Pergamus
[38:41] church, but they held two doctrines.
[38:44] They had that doctrine of the
[38:46] nickelism, and they also had the
[38:48] doctrine of Balism. Yeah. So they taught
[38:52] like Balam taught, but they did it
[38:54] through a nicicoatan system. Now
[38:57] nickelism, you can take it down now if
[38:59] you'd like. Nicoleism is actually
[39:01] speaking of the hierarchy. Again, it's
[39:04] it's uh and I'll just give you real
[39:05] quick, we'll move on, but this is
[39:07] dealing with bishop and elders. Now,
[39:09] this is real important because what
[39:10] happens is they call it bishop and
[39:12] elders. In other words, there's a bishop
[39:14] that will rule over multiple churches
[39:16] and then there would be an elder in each
[39:18] church which would be called a local
[39:20] elder and a bishop would be over a bunch
[39:23] of elders. But brother Ram said they got
[39:24] it mixed up because actually a pastor is
[39:29] the highest authority of the local
[39:32] church. How many knows he said it? He
[39:35] says but bishop is speaking of the
[39:37] pastorship and he said the elder speaks
[39:39] of his age. It wasn't that there would
[39:43] be a man over a bunch of churches and
[39:45] all of them would be elders. See, that's
[39:47] a nicotan teaching.
[39:52] Now, if you argue with me, you're
[39:54] directly arguing with brother Brandham,
[39:57] and I can read it to you if you'd rather
[39:58] me do it. But he said the mixup with
[40:00] bishop and elders. Now, you said,
[40:02] "Preacher, we've seen that in the
[40:03] message." And we have, but it's still
[40:06] nicotism. Whether it was in the message
[40:08] or the Baptist or the theolog, it don't
[40:11] matter where it's at. That's the reason
[40:13] this church age book is your best friend
[40:15] when you're discerning the two spirits
[40:17] that work within the framework of the
[40:19] Christian church. We've seen it. Amen. I
[40:22] I I I could start naming doctrines, but
[40:24] I'm not going to. But but we've seen
[40:26] that spirit work and how that bishops
[40:29] and they rise up and then they get
[40:30] pastors under them. And you know what's
[40:32] bad is uh uh if the if the pastor,
[40:35] brother Eric, disagrees with the bishop,
[40:37] you know what happens to the poor elder?
[40:39] Amen. Amen. The bishop moves him out of
[40:41] the way, splits his church, tears the
[40:42] guy down, and he pretty much loses his
[40:44] ministry. Amen. Because But but look
[40:47] now, he should have never built a
[40:49] platform for a bishop over his church.
[40:53] He should have stayed with the Bible as
[40:55] a spirit-led man of God and said there
[40:58] is nothing over the pastor in the local
[41:00] assembly.
[41:04] That's right. Amen. Do you see now and
[41:07] watch what watch what's taking place
[41:09] when you start putting when you start
[41:10] putting bishops and and and and they
[41:12] start ruling then they get a certain
[41:15] direction or they get a certain teaching
[41:16] or they and usually in in our case it
[41:19] usually goes something like you know
[41:21] well brother Brandham said this but
[41:26] and then that's when you're placed under
[41:28] a man
[41:30] instead of the message
[41:34] the headship of the church should be
[41:36] Christ.
[41:38] Come on, church. The word of this age
[41:41] come out of a prophet that is a
[41:43] vindicated headship to the church of the
[41:45] living God. That's why in this church,
[41:47] you heard me say it often. Amen. If if I
[41:50] say something that's contrary to what
[41:52] brother Brandham said, you just say,
[41:54] "Poor brother Wayne, we'll pray for
[41:56] him." And you believe what the prophet
[41:58] said, would you please? It is not
[42:01] offensive to me for you to take the
[42:03] prophet's words over mine. It just means
[42:05] I've done a good job.
[42:10] Now watch because because what happens
[42:12] is is you're seeing a nickelism and that
[42:16] nickelism because of that they separated
[42:19] the church from the word. Now they can
[42:22] put a Balum teaching in there. Right now
[42:24] watch what they did under Balum
[42:26] teaching. How many knows what Bale Por
[42:27] is in the scripture? Bale peor is from
[42:30] the book of numbers. And what happened
[42:32] was when Balam, amen, was hired by Bao
[42:35] through religion, he was supposed to
[42:37] curse the Holy Ghost move of God.
[42:40] Remember Moses was moving through Moab
[42:43] and Bailo said, "We can't let this kind
[42:44] of move happen. So, we got to get us a
[42:47] religious stop. We got to get us a
[42:50] preacher that'll preach against that
[42:52] Holy Ghost stuff and make a heretic out
[42:54] of anybody that believes in the Holy
[42:56] Ghost. We we got to just call them holy
[42:58] rollers and we got to make bad names out
[43:00] of them people. Make nobody want to be
[43:02] like that, you know. But when Baum went
[43:05] to curse them, he said, "I've done
[43:07] everything I can do." He But God has
[43:09] blessed these people. How can I curse
[43:11] them when God's already blessed them?
[43:13] And he went back to Bailo and he said,
[43:15] "Look, Bail, I can't curse these people,
[43:17] but I can teach you a way.
[43:20] I can show you a way that their own God
[43:23] will punish them." Yes, sir. Balam said,
[43:25] bail said, "Come on, do the teaching."
[43:27] He said, 'Well, you put up a feast. Now,
[43:28] this is paraphrasing and I'm going to
[43:30] going to say it instead of read it.
[43:32] Okay, so but Balam put up a feast in
[43:35] Moab called the feast of Bale Por and
[43:38] they invited all of the Israelite people
[43:41] down to eat meat and have a unity party
[43:44] and and and and after all, we're all
[43:47] one.
[43:49] We're all one. No, no, no, no. We're not
[43:51] all one, folks. that brother Brandham
[43:54] said teaching alone weakened Israel and
[43:57] that's why they turned around and went
[43:59] back and said we're nothing bigger than
[44:00] grasshoppers because they saw themselves
[44:03] on an equal human basis with them in the
[44:06] Canaanite and Palestine and the
[44:07] Malachites but they wasn't the same.
[44:09] They were Abraham's children. Amen. And
[44:12] as Abraham's children they were heirs
[44:14] whoever promised in the land. Listen,
[44:16] you cannot measure David and Goliath the
[44:18] same. Glock might be bigger, but David
[44:21] was a son of Abraham.
[44:25] Come on, church. We are not just another
[44:28] church. We are not just another people.
[44:31] We are Nazerites, sacred virginborn
[44:34] church of the living God. We are not
[44:38] just something else. We are not just
[44:40] another church or another denomination.
[44:42] We hold a sacred trust of the virtue of
[44:45] the word of God. Yeah,
[44:49] you can find a you can find a bad woman
[44:51] on every corner.
[44:55] Solomon said you can't find a good man
[44:57] in a thousand and not one good woman in
[44:59] them. It's the reason he said it was a
[45:01] precious and a a wonderful thing.
[45:05] The sacredness of her. So they took the
[45:08] doctrines of Balum that Balam taught
[45:10] them. They're all the same, which was
[45:13] what weakened them. But when they got
[45:14] down to the feast of Bior, how many
[45:16] knows what happens?
[45:18] Brother Bram said, "Them Israelite men
[45:20] was
[45:21] not counting on the beauty of those
[45:25] Moabites women."
[45:30] So they
[45:31] committed fornication. That's right.
[45:37] Man, that's tough stuff.
[45:39] Listen.
[45:42] 24,000 died
[45:44] because of the feast of Belpor
[45:47] because Balum taught them to commit
[45:50] fornication.
[45:51] What is the teaching of this church,
[45:53] that Roman church? What's it teaching
[45:55] the people to do?
[45:58] To commit fornication on God. By
[46:01] therefore not just naturally killing
[46:03] them. They naturally killed 68 million.
[46:06] But how many did they put to spiritual
[46:08] death,
[46:12] spiritually dead
[46:14] because of the teaching of Balum through
[46:17] the nickelans? They separated God from
[46:20] his word and gave him form instead of
[46:23] the power of God. Listen, God cannot
[46:26] operate outside of his word. That's
[46:28] right. Listen, brother ma'am said you
[46:30] cannot replace spiritual manifestation
[46:32] with form. You cannot replace spiritual
[46:36] manifestation with form. Jesus said the
[46:38] father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[46:41] works. So the works of the church must
[46:43] be done by the father dwelling in them.
[46:46] You cannot separate them from it. You
[46:50] can't do it. It must be a spirit
[46:52] manifested word that comes into the
[46:54] church of the living God. Now look what
[46:56] happens. They actually caused this
[46:58] balanism to come and 24,000 dies. Now,
[47:01] amen. For the for the I know it's ain't
[47:03] to my church, but to a critic listening
[47:05] to me, Amen. You you you think Brother
[47:07] Bram said 500 one place said 700, the
[47:09] other. And you want to dislodge him?
[47:10] Well, the Bible said 24,000 in the book
[47:13] of Numbers, but Paul now he got real
[47:15] messed up and said there was 23,000
[47:17] died. 1 Corinthians 10:8, he missed it
[47:20] by a thousand. I guess Paul was false
[47:22] prophet.
[47:24] Yeah.
[47:27] Figuring the way they figure.
[47:32] Well, I tell you what, I never learned
[47:34] to add and subtract like that.
[47:37] 24,000 or 23,000. Paul was right.
[47:45] Well, I'm just going to take the Bible.
[47:47] Which
[47:47] one? 24,000. 23,000? Both Bible. Come
[47:51] on.
[47:54] Critical thinking will put you back on
[47:57] in a denominational place. The spirit of
[48:00] revelation is the eagle of the age that
[48:03] it'll kill every spirit of unbelief. The
[48:06] revelation is a lot of people died
[48:09] because of that false doctrine.
[48:12] [Applause]
[48:14] Pill of fire showed up in Houston
[48:15] Coliseum. Brother Bam said there was
[48:17] 30,000 or something or he said there was
[48:19] 400 ushers and they got mixed up with
[48:21] 400 ushers or 100 ushers and they
[48:25] pillar of fire up here.
[48:27] [Music]
[48:31] I'm not guessing. I got a picture of it
[48:34] and no matter how many critics take that
[48:36] picture and say it's no good. Of course
[48:38] they say it's no good. Of course they
[48:42] say. But we didn't even take it. But
[48:45] Carrie, I love it. We didn't take it.
[48:47] The critics took it. That's like taking
[48:50] Goliath's sword and cutting off his own
[48:52] head. You take the picture of Put it up
[48:55] there right quick. You take this picture
[48:57] of a prophet. This ain't in my notes.
[48:59] And the pillar of fire over his head.
[49:00] Amen. It's like taking the sword of
[49:02] Goliath and cutting his own head off. I
[49:04] love to show it when I preach. I love
[49:06] for it to flash up on the screen.
[49:08] Goliath. Amen. I come to you in the name
[49:11] of the Lord.
[49:14] history, Bible, Revelation, it all says
[49:18] that's the angel of the covenant. That
[49:20] is Jesus Christ that's returned to this
[49:23] age. The same one that wrote the Old
[49:26] Testament under Moses and wrote the New
[49:28] Testament under Paul has come now to
[49:31] reveal the revelation that is written in
[49:34] this Bible. We are not an inherent
[49:37] bride. We are an infallible bride built
[49:40] upon the word. Amen.
[49:44] Heavens and earth could pass away, but
[49:46] my word, it will never pass away.
[49:49] So, oh, this bride will fall like other
[49:51] brides. No, sir, she won't. This bride
[49:53] will never fail. She's already
[49:56] pregnantated with the unadulterated,
[49:58] germatized word of almighty God. Yes,
[50:01] sir, she's pregnantated with it. She
[50:04] cannot fall from it
[50:07] because she is the word.
[50:13] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. She is the word.
[50:17] She's not like the word. She's not just
[50:20] believing the word. She is the word.
[50:23] She's the spirit manifesting power of
[50:27] almighty God.
[50:30] Then they say, "A little while and the
[50:32] world seeth me no more. For I will be
[50:34] with you, even in you, until the end of
[50:37] the age." And that same Jesus stood in
[50:40] the body of this bride to manifest these
[50:42] end time messages.
[50:46] It's in you this morning to believe it.
[50:51] Oh, forgive me. It's not my notes. Feels
[50:54] awful good though.
[50:58] They get drunk on the wine of that
[50:59] fornication. I get drunk on the wine of
[51:01] truth.
[51:03] It's intoxicating to feel the truth of
[51:05] God come flowing in a building
[51:07] uninhibited,
[51:09] unrestricted. Thank you, true
[51:11] tabernacle. Thank you for your faith and
[51:14] your belief. Thank you for an open
[51:16] pullpit to preach this message. Thank
[51:18] you for the preaching. Amen. To a place
[51:21] to preach and teach the power of
[51:25] God. A real mother you are.
[51:30] Hallelujah. How
[51:35] about he miss
[51:37] some room
[51:41] intoxicated on the truth of God.
[51:46] Sure they're full of the doctrine of
[51:48] baalism and nickelism.
[51:51] Can you imagine ba when they got
[51:54] married? That's brother B said they they
[51:55] they got married there under BPR and he
[51:58] said that's what Constantine did to the
[52:00] church married it to Babylonian religion
[52:02] and the marriage caused the problem
[52:05] cuz you're joining up with something
[52:07] that won't correct itself to the word.
[52:11] That's the reason you never get in an
[52:13] organization.
[52:16] People tried for years to tell me how
[52:17] wrong I was in my ministry that I need
[52:19] to be out in this organization that one
[52:20] trying to convert. And I said, "Well, if
[52:21] Brother Brandham couldn't convert him,
[52:22] how in the world
[52:25] could a simple hillbilly like me convert
[52:27] him?"
[52:29] But I feel God gave me a different
[52:31] ministry. He gave me a ministry to
[52:32] preach what has been preached in this
[52:34] age. Right.
[52:39] Now they taught
[52:41] that nickelans taught that bailic
[52:44] doctrine and brought fornication into
[52:46] the church where brother Brandham
[52:50] says he says
[52:52] that the same spirit that causes
[52:56] spiritual fornication is the spirit
[52:58] found in the denominational church
[53:02] church age book. Amen.
[53:05] So, Brother Wayne, I think we ought to
[53:06] just bring them all in. I don't. I think
[53:09] you ought to flee it like the plague.
[53:13] You said them people, them are wonderful
[53:14] people. That organization is the mark of
[53:17] the beast.
[53:19] And I do not apologize one bit. It is
[53:21] the mark of the beast. Young people flee
[53:24] it like it's a plague. Amen.
[53:32] Someday they may quieten your pastor's
[53:34] voice, but don't never forget this.
[53:37] It's the mark of the beast.
[53:43] Amen. Of
[53:45] course, bishops and
[53:48] elders took the control of hierarchy of
[53:51] organization, took the spirit
[53:53] manifestation out and separated it. As
[53:56] Balam began to teach formalism of a
[53:58] fundamental altar
[54:01] and do away with the spirit
[54:02] manifestation.
[54:04] Look what it was. They committed
[54:06] fornications. They joined up. They
[54:09] joined up with it. Now in Revelation 17
[54:13] and5 the Bible covers this when it
[54:16] speaks of the Thyra church age. Now if
[54:19] you're a Bible reader that's Revelations
[54:21] 2 and verse 18. The Thitara age
[54:25] parallels the fifth verse of Revelation
[54:28] 17. And this was a great mother of
[54:33] harlots. She was the mother of harlots.
[54:35] Now, if you're looking in Revelations 2
[54:37] under the Thitara age, brother Bram
[54:39] said, "This thyra was known as a
[54:41] dominating female."
[54:44] Now, I got some powerful quotes. I just
[54:45] ain't going to read them all because I
[54:46] don't have time. But, Brother Bram said
[54:48] it was never given a woman an iron will.
[54:51] He said she was never given the
[54:53] disposition of an iron will. She was
[54:55] given a submissive spirit.
[54:58] That a woman should submit to her
[55:00] husband. Amen.
[55:02] A church has to have a spirit to submit
[55:06] to the word.
[55:08] Yes, sir. I don't care what brother
[55:10] Brandham said. Well, I
[55:12] do. Yes, sir.
[55:15] When David stood up there and said, "I
[55:17] want a drink from the well of
[55:18] Bethlehem." And they had the they had
[55:20] them they had a a garrison of
[55:22] Philistines around that well. His men
[55:25] heard that and brother Bram said his
[55:27] desire
[55:29] became their command.
[55:33] Hallelujah. If God wants our ladies to
[55:35] dress a certain way, if it's his desire,
[55:40] it's our command.
[55:42] If he wants us to baptize a certain way,
[55:44] he wants us to operate the church a
[55:46] certain way. If it's his desire, it's
[55:49] our command. We are not a rebellious
[55:52] people.
[55:54] We easily submit.
[55:58] Let me say this. If we teach it
[56:00] different than brother Brandham, it's
[56:01] just cuz we ain't read it yet.
[56:05] But if you think I teach it different,
[56:06] Brother Brandham, wait till you go read
[56:08] it first
[56:13] cuz I might not be the one reading it
[56:15] wrong.
[56:17] Come on. Do you see? They got drunk on
[56:20] that doctrine that they was the ones
[56:22] right
[56:24] and they were the inhabitants was
[56:27] accepting that and it was nothing more
[56:30] than according to the scripture a
[56:32] dominating woman a
[56:35] prostitute that has children. Now I want
[56:38] to read from here in Revelation 17.
[56:40] Watch this. Daughters go to Revelations
[56:42] 2 and 20. And the Bible says that woman
[56:47] Jezebel.
[56:48] Now, isn't it amazing? He's bringing
[56:50] Jezebel in to Revelations the 17th
[56:53] chapter. Jezeb that woman Jezebel.
[56:58] Now, watch. It's become a her. Now, the
[57:00] doctrines have turned into a her.
[57:03] The church is now embodying
[57:06] the doctrine of this nickel and this
[57:09] baalism and it's now known as Jezebel.
[57:12] Now watch Jezebel in the scripture. Now
[57:14] you that have read about Jezebel know
[57:17] she lived in the time of Ahab. Brother
[57:19] Brham said, "Watch her." She was the
[57:20] daughter of a murdering idolatry
[57:24] and she became the wife of a so-called
[57:28] son of God.
[57:30] And he happened to be the king of
[57:32] Israel. It was a political marriage
[57:35] between heathenism and and Israel, which
[57:39] now y'all have to pay attention here
[57:41] because you have 10 tribes. Now, I I
[57:44] want to make this parallel. I want you
[57:46] to catch it. So, I'm not going to I'm
[57:47] not going to preach it. I want to just
[57:48] say it to you. You've got the Roman
[57:50] Catholic Church and you have
[57:52] denominations of Protestants.
[57:56] Watch in the scripture. You have Israel,
[57:59] 10 tribes, and you have Judah, two
[58:02] tribes.
[58:04] They're all Israel as they are the
[58:07] Christian church. But they're separate.
[58:10] Remember, they got separated just after
[58:12] Solomon, his son, he brought separation
[58:14] in, and they separated the kingdoms and
[58:18] the 10 tribes that were now called
[58:21] Israel. Those 10 tribes had a man named
[58:23] Ahab who was ruling over them. And when
[58:27] Ahab married Jezebel, she brought in her
[58:30] unbelief with her. So instead of her
[58:34] converting, she brought
[58:36] in. Now, Brother Bam said it. He said,
[58:38] "If a good boy marry a bad woman," he
[58:41] said, "Either she'll become a good woman
[58:42] or he'll become a bad man."
[58:46] That was why he told our our young
[58:48] people to be careful how you marry.
[58:49] That's right. And he says, watch how she
[58:51] brought that Jezebel in and instead of
[58:54] her converting to Jehovah God, she
[58:57] started worshiping Baal and Aarda and to
[59:00] and to make her happy. Now that Babylon,
[59:03] watch it, Baal. And they wanted to make
[59:05] her happy. So he be to build temples
[59:08] that then became bigger than the temples
[59:11] they had to worship Jehovah. The Bible
[59:14] goes so far as to say on every high
[59:16] place
[59:18] they had altars built unto Baal. Isn't
[59:21] that something? And they would place
[59:23] them altars and they would worship. And
[59:25] this in this season, remember, they
[59:28] begin to persecute the prophets and the
[59:31] priests of Jehovah and put them to
[59:33] death. That's when God sent Elijah on
[59:36] the scene. Remember, right in the middle
[59:37] of that, Elijah come on the scene. Amen.
[59:40] and begin to curse Jezebel and curse
[59:42] Ahab and tell him what their futures
[59:44] were going to be. But if you watch this
[59:46] now, she Jezebel was as the harlot
[59:49] church, but she had daughters.
[59:53] And just as Jezebel had a natural
[59:55] daughter, the Roman church had a
[59:58] daughter of spiritual likeness. Amen. In
[1:00:01] being they were organization. Now watch.
[1:00:03] Jezebel had a daughter named Athela. I
[1:00:05] think that's pronounced correctly.
[1:00:07] Athela. A t h e l i a I believe Aila.
[1:00:11] And she had a daughter named Athela.
[1:00:12] It's in the scripture. And and and and
[1:00:14] this this woman
[1:00:17] Athela married one of the kings of
[1:00:21] Judah. So now Jezebel's daughter is
[1:00:25] taking the sins of Israel, Ahab and
[1:00:27] Jezebel, and carrying them over into the
[1:00:30] Lutheran church. I mean over into Judah.
[1:00:35] Yeah. And now Judah is taking the same
[1:00:39] uncleanness that has been found in
[1:00:42] Israel, which called God to curse him
[1:00:45] through Elijah and bring the famine upon
[1:00:48] the land. But now through Athela,
[1:00:50] Jezebel's daughter, they have brought
[1:00:52] the same teachings into Judah. And watch
[1:00:55] this. And when when when the Bible said,
[1:00:57] Amen, that when her son died, who was
[1:00:59] supposed to sit up on the throne, y'all
[1:01:01] know what they did? This woman, Athela,
[1:01:03] she was a murdering woman. That's right.
[1:01:05] She was a dominating female just like
[1:01:07] her mama. And the moment her son died,
[1:01:10] who was supposed to be sitting on the
[1:01:12] throne of Judah, Amen. She killed the
[1:01:15] entire line of kings.
[1:01:18] She killed every king. Amen. I think it
[1:01:20] was uh seven of them. Amen. She killed
[1:01:23] every one of them that could by blood
[1:01:26] sit on the throne of Judah because she
[1:01:29] was taking the throne. She had exalted
[1:01:33] herself. This is Bible. She exalted
[1:01:36] herself as the queen of Judah in the
[1:01:39] place of God's seed had promised David
[1:01:42] forever thou shalt sit upon the throne
[1:01:44] of but watch in the middle of that
[1:01:46] slaughter in the middle of the slaughter
[1:01:48] of the was an aunt in there and she
[1:01:51] looked over and saw Joash and he was
[1:01:53] just an infant boy and she ran and
[1:01:55] grabbed Joash and took off running and
[1:01:58] hid him in the temple. And the scripture
[1:02:00] tells us that there was seven years
[1:02:02] passed that Aila ruled that while all
[1:02:06] the time little Joash was growing up in
[1:02:09] the secrets, he was growing up in the
[1:02:11] dark places. Because after a little
[1:02:13] while, Amen. God was going to reveal
[1:02:16] there is still one who owns the throne.
[1:02:19] There is a real
[1:02:21] Oh, church of the living God. For seven
[1:02:24] ages, this Aila, Jezebel, and her
[1:02:27] daughters have been trying to take away
[1:02:30] the throne that belongs to the church of
[1:02:32] God. But the whole time, there's been a
[1:02:34] little bride. She's been hid in the
[1:02:36] scripture. Every time in this church
[1:02:39] age, every time, glory be to God, every
[1:02:42] time in this church age, he speaks to a
[1:02:44] bad vine, he speaks to a good one,
[1:02:47] because God has never forgot that
[1:02:49] there's coming a bride. There's coming
[1:02:51] one growing up out of it. I will have a
[1:02:54] fruit tree.
[1:02:56] There'll be a bride tree in the last
[1:02:58] days. There'll be one coming that'll
[1:03:00] bear the fruit of almighty God. Yes,
[1:03:03] there's a harlot. Yes, there's a
[1:03:05] prostitute. Yes, there's a mother of
[1:03:07] their systems. Oh, but there's another
[1:03:09] one.
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:13] She's mentioned every time.
[1:03:17] What's the scripture? Let's read it. And
[1:03:18] the angel said unto me, why you marvel?
[1:03:22] I'll tell you the mystery of this woman
[1:03:23] and of the beast and that carth her
[1:03:25] which has seven heads. Have we heard the
[1:03:27] mystery?
[1:03:30] Whatever angel was talking to John must
[1:03:32] have been talking here in the last days
[1:03:33] or something. Yes, Lord. All right. The
[1:03:36] beast that thou sawest and is not, and
[1:03:38] ascend out of the bottomless pit, and
[1:03:39] goeth into predition, and they that
[1:03:41] dwell on the
[1:03:43] earth, and they now, isn't it
[1:03:46] amazing? Right in the heart of the
[1:03:50] center of the revelation of revealing
[1:03:52] this prostitute in her system. He's
[1:03:56] going to talk about people whose names
[1:04:00] he's telling you there's a seed remains.
[1:04:03] There's a people that's in the lamb's
[1:04:05] book of life from the foundation of the
[1:04:06] world. And when they beheld the beast
[1:04:09] that was and is and is not, how many
[1:04:10] knows what that is? The beast that is
[1:04:12] and is was not and is and is and is not.
[1:04:15] It's the
[1:04:16] pope. I was standing there the other
[1:04:18] day, brother. It was the neatest thing.
[1:04:20] We was in the Vatican and they had these
[1:04:23] tubs made out of Chris' like to have one
[1:04:26] of them things. Big old big old pretty
[1:04:29] tubs. They were made out of marble. Some
[1:04:30] of the prettiest marble. And they was
[1:04:32] highly polished, beautiful
[1:04:34] tubs. I don't know where they carried
[1:04:36] the water from, but they had carry a
[1:04:37] while. It was they were
[1:04:38] nice. And the guy, he looks over at us
[1:04:41] and he says, "These tubs have not moved
[1:04:44] from this spot in 800
[1:04:48] years." Look, you know they had no woman
[1:04:51] pope,
[1:04:54] right? She would have rearranged that.
[1:05:06] Y'all know it's
[1:05:11] true. Man was in
[1:05:14] charge. He said that that bath hasn't
[1:05:17] moved in 800 years. And I thought, there
[1:05:21] it is. They have come and went for 800
[1:05:25] years. Yeah. And not even move the
[1:05:27] bathtub.
[1:05:31] that which was and was not. Look at what
[1:05:34] they do. They left that system,
[1:05:37] rise and fall of popes. But that system
[1:05:40] never changed. It's the same ungodly
[1:05:44] system that started in A325 that rules
[1:05:46] today. Amen. But watch, but what is
[1:05:49] happening is is God is revealing. He's
[1:05:52] revealing to the church. Amen. what it
[1:05:55] is. And he's revealing how that the
[1:05:58] church in the last days will under the
[1:06:01] spirit of wisdom and understanding will
[1:06:04] be able to understand why things are
[1:06:08] what they were about. And we're going to
[1:06:10] be Now, the Bible tells us in 2
[1:06:12] Thessalonians 2 that there would be a
[1:06:15] revealing of the of the man of sin. How
[1:06:18] many knows when that happened? When the
[1:06:20] first seal opened, there's a revealing
[1:06:22] of the man of sin. And watch what's
[1:06:24] happening at that same time is coming a
[1:06:27] restoration to the church. In Joel the 2
[1:06:30] chapter, watch it now. It has to stay
[1:06:31] there. In Joel chapter 2, you watch the
[1:06:34] Bible say, amen, that behold, rejoice
[1:06:38] thou daughter of Zion.
[1:06:41] Rejoice greatly, thou daughter of Zion.
[1:06:44] So Zion has daughters.
[1:06:48] Zion is the new Jerusalem.
[1:06:51] There's a prostitute with daughters, but
[1:06:53] Zion has daughters. If there is a false
[1:06:56] woman, there's a real woman.
[1:06:59] Brother Bam said, "You got to see the
[1:07:01] contrast. What good would day be without
[1:07:03] night?" What good would a good woman be
[1:07:07] if you never seen a bad one? But when
[1:07:09] you've seen a bad woman, you know how to
[1:07:11] respect a good one. You know the virtue
[1:07:13] and the character of a real good woman.
[1:07:16] Somebody said, "Well, brother Wayne, I
[1:07:17] tell you what, I I grew up in the world
[1:07:18] and I messed up my life and and maybe
[1:07:20] maybe that's me." No, no. I want to show
[1:07:23] you a beautiful picture. Back in the
[1:07:25] days of Elijah, remember when he cursed
[1:07:27] Jezebel? Remember what kind of woman she
[1:07:29] was? She cursed him. But in this
[1:07:31] generation under a prophet, Brother
[1:07:33] Brandham walks into a a cafe right here
[1:07:36] in Ohio. And when he walks in, he looks
[1:07:38] at a woman sitting there, which is a bad
[1:07:41] woman. and she's got shorts and makeup
[1:07:43] and drunk and flirting with young men.
[1:07:45] And brother Bam said, "Oh, it made me
[1:07:47] sick to my stomach." And I I thought,
[1:07:48] "How could God ever do anything?" He
[1:07:51] said, "And all of a sudden, the voice of
[1:07:52] the Lord said, "Step behind the door."
[1:07:54] And he stepped behind the door and he
[1:07:56] began to see a vision of the blood and
[1:07:58] he saw the blood around the earth. And
[1:08:00] he said, "I seen sins coming up from the
[1:08:03] earth and hitting the Lord Jesus." And
[1:08:05] he would wse and he would wse and he
[1:08:07] said and it was like a bumper stopping
[1:08:09] these sins that kept slamming into him.
[1:08:12] And he said I looked over at him and
[1:08:14] said, "Lord, is that the sins of the
[1:08:15] world?" He said, "No, they're your
[1:08:17] sins." And brother Bam said, he told
[1:08:19] him, he said, look, he said, if I've
[1:08:21] forgiven you, how can you condemn her?
[1:08:25] Because this spirit of Elijah has come
[1:08:28] under the power of the blood. Oh church,
[1:08:32] this morning I say this. Amen. There is
[1:08:35] not a woman that this message can't
[1:08:36] clean up. There is not a home that it
[1:08:39] can't fix. There is not a life that it
[1:08:42] can't
[1:08:44] change. What about Rahab of the Bible?
[1:08:47] Come on, church. What about her? Walls
[1:08:50] of Jericho fell down. She come out, but
[1:08:53] God didn't leave her just there. He took
[1:08:55] her and married her to the salmon and
[1:09:00] made her a part of the lineage. Her
[1:09:02] marriage. Yeah. Come on. Jezebel's
[1:09:05] marriage killed. Athela's marriage
[1:09:08] killed. But the marriage of Rahab
[1:09:11] brought a savior into the earth. Amen.
[1:09:14] The marriage of Ruth brought a savior
[1:09:18] into the earth. I tell you, rejoice ye,
[1:09:21] oh daughters of Zion. The marriage of
[1:09:23] the lamb has come. There has been a
[1:09:26] marriage and it's brought life and it's
[1:09:30] brought joy.
[1:09:33] She's got the word.
[1:09:35] She can bring children. She can bring
[1:09:38] word children.
[1:09:41] It's the responsibility of this church
[1:09:43] to birth children into this age.
[1:09:46] And as any good mother, we're not just
[1:09:48] going to birth them. We're going to feed
[1:09:49] them. We're going to train them. We're
[1:09:52] going to teach them the ways of God. Oh,
[1:09:54] but we've got to keep an atmosphere in
[1:09:56] here that there is a birth possible that
[1:09:59] the children of God can come in and find
[1:10:01] the birth of the word in the age we're
[1:10:04] living in. God help us.
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:08] There's been a marriage to a word
[1:10:11] and life has come out of it. Stand to
[1:10:15] your feet with me this morning. And life
[1:10:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:27] Hallelujah.
[1:10:29] If our uh candidates for baptism, you
[1:10:33] can be dismissed at this time and the
[1:10:35] deacons will show you a place that you
[1:10:37] can
[1:10:39] change
[1:10:43] life. It's never changed. Right. Right.
[1:10:48] John the third chapter. Jesus first
[1:10:51] doctrine he ever taught. You must be
[1:10:54] born again.
[1:10:56] I don't understand. Said a master
[1:10:58] teacher. He said, "Oh, you got to have a
[1:11:01] new birth of the water and the blood,
[1:11:05] the spirit. There's got to be a new
[1:11:07] birth." Right?
[1:11:10] Well, shock you. Brother Bram said
[1:11:12] denominational system can't bring forth
[1:11:15] a word birth.
[1:11:18] You know what's wrong?
[1:11:21] They've took a modern day spirit.
[1:11:24] And they don't want any of them. Acts
[1:11:26] 238
[1:11:28] tongue talking babies because it'll ruin
[1:11:31] the form.
[1:11:37] It'll ruin the form. Do you know the
[1:11:39] Bible said that there should come forth,
[1:11:41] rejoice, oh daughters of Zion, you have
[1:11:43] received the former reign moderately,
[1:11:45] but there shall come forth both former
[1:11:47] and latter in the same month. I pour out
[1:11:51] my spirit, sayaith the Lord upon all of
[1:11:53] this flesh. Amen. He's promising a
[1:11:56] flood. He's promising a flood of the
[1:11:58] Holy Ghost. You can't flood a building
[1:12:01] without changing it.
[1:12:03] If you turn a flood in here, the boards
[1:12:05] will start popping off the walls and the
[1:12:07] and the carpet will be changed. Nobody
[1:12:09] wants to flood a building cuz it hurt
[1:12:11] changes the forms. Everything's changed.
[1:12:13] Well, listen. This is a spiritual
[1:12:15] building and I want to change the form
[1:12:18] into a place where God can save and heal
[1:12:21] and heal and deliver and give life. Let
[1:12:24] it be a birthing place, a place where
[1:12:26] sons and daughters of God can come to
[1:12:30] hear the word of God.
[1:12:33] Oh my goodness. Yeah. This last day age,
[1:12:36] butter bam said they're they don't want
[1:12:39] none of
[1:12:40] them rolling around the floor screaming
[1:12:43] and crying. And brother Bam said the
[1:12:45] miserable creatures that they think they
[1:12:48] are. Why it would ruin their modern
[1:12:54] society.
[1:12:57] Cuz I tell you what, any church that
[1:13:00] somebody praying through to the Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost ruins, needs ruining.
[1:13:06] And any day we get so polished, somebody
[1:13:08] can't throw through to the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:09] then we need to take the polish off and
[1:13:12] fill the altars up.
[1:13:14] Yes, sir. Somebody said, "Brother Wayne,
[1:13:16] what's it take?" I'll tell you what,
[1:13:18] more times than anything Brother Bram
[1:13:19] said about a birth, how many knows what
[1:13:21] was he said? It's a mess. That's right.
[1:13:24] And he said, "If it's a P hospital room
[1:13:26] or your h, it don't matter where it
[1:13:28] takes place. It's a mess." Would it
[1:13:32] shock you to hear what Brother Brham
[1:13:34] said when he said, "Sometimes what I
[1:13:36] think we need is to get down to the
[1:13:38] altar and flop like a chicken with our
[1:13:40] head cut off until we get something."
[1:13:44] Come on. But until we get something, not
[1:13:46] just get up and go talk about our
[1:13:48] neighbor or some arrogant spirit where
[1:13:50] we're we're the only people or No. pray
[1:13:52] through till you die from the sin of
[1:13:55] this earth and let a new birth. Let the
[1:13:58] word let the word conquer our souls.
[1:14:03] I believe it. I I don't believe in this
[1:14:05] nicicoatism and bailic teachings of
[1:14:08] we're all one. No. When God fills you
[1:14:10] with the Holy Ghost, you're a new
[1:14:11] creation in Christ Jesus filled with the
[1:14:15] power of God. Acts 2:38, tongue-talking,
[1:14:18] Holy Ghost fil believers seeing visions
[1:14:20] and having dreams and all the gifts of
[1:14:23] the spirit should be available in that
[1:14:25] group.
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:28] I know everybody talks about tongues.
[1:14:29] That's the only way anybody cares about,
[1:14:30] but wisdom actually is the top of those.
[1:14:34] How many knows the gift of wisdom's in
[1:14:35] this building?
[1:14:39] Brother Bram said it would be. And to
[1:14:41] him that have wisdom, let him understand
[1:14:44] the things which
[1:14:48] I think that gift is is very vibrant in
[1:14:51] this building,
[1:14:54] the understanding of the word. Oh, we
[1:14:57] love him this morning, don't we? We love
[1:15:00] him. The Bible's telling us, "Go ye
[1:15:04] therefore and teach all nations." Bring
[1:15:06] it up. Matthew 28:19. Just as we go into
[1:15:08] our baptism this
[1:15:10] morning, the last thing Jesus said to
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:15] church, "Go ye therefore and teach all
[1:15:17] nations and baptizing them
[1:15:20] in the name."
[1:15:24] Just take a moment.
[1:15:26] It don't say title.
[1:15:29] Yeah. Because the next three things he
[1:15:31] gives is titles
[1:15:34] in the name. It don't say names
[1:15:37] because there's not plurality
[1:15:39] in the name of salvation.
[1:15:42] But it said in the name of the
[1:15:45] father. Now somebody said what's his
[1:15:47] name? What did Jesus say it was? He said
[1:15:50] I have come in my father's
[1:15:56] name. What's the name of the son
[1:16:02] and of the holy ghost? Ephesians 3:14
[1:16:05] said, "The whole family in heaven and in
[1:16:08] earth
[1:16:10] have the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:16:14] So then for let every knee bow and every
[1:16:18] tongue confess.
[1:16:21] Now, Apostle Peter was standing right
[1:16:23] there, Sister Barb, and he was listening
[1:16:26] to his master.
[1:16:28] And Peter had been asked the question in
[1:16:30] Matthew 16, who do you say I am? And he
[1:16:33] said, I say thou art the Christ, the son
[1:16:36] of the living God. And Jesus said, that
[1:16:38] is a correct
[1:16:39] revelation. And because thou has said
[1:16:42] this, thy name is Peter, and upon this
[1:16:44] rock I'll build my
[1:16:46] church. See, I give to you the keys to
[1:16:51] the
[1:16:51] kingdom. Whatever you bind shall be
[1:16:54] bound. Whatever you loose shall be
[1:16:55] loosed.
[1:16:59] That's Peter, the first pope.
[1:17:08] Well, if that's so I'm Catholic, too.
[1:17:14] Do you know they got in that triple
[1:17:15] crown? They got crossed keys on the
[1:17:18] crown. Two big skeleton keys crossed.
[1:17:21] You know what that's for? Keys to bind
[1:17:23] and loose in any realm.
[1:17:28] And the Lord said to Peter, "You got the
[1:17:31] keys. Whatever you bind shall be bound.
[1:17:33] Whatever you lose shall be loosed." Do
[1:17:35] you think Peter lost those keys?
[1:17:39] But in Acts the 2 chapter, when they
[1:17:41] said, "Men and brethren, what could we
[1:17:44] do to be saved?"
[1:17:47] He pulled out his key.
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:52] Repent every one of you in the name of
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:17:56] sins.
[1:17:58] be baptized in his name
