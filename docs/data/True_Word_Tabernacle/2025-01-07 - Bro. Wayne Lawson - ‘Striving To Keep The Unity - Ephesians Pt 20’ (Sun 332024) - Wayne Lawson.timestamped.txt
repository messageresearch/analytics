[3:53] hearts to iten amen I know you come to
[3:55] the house of the Lord this morning on
[3:57] fire ready to give the devil a hard time
[4:00] and Jesus a lot of Praise amen amen I
[4:04] bring you greetings from Brother Ericson
[4:05] I spoke with him this morning and he
[4:07] said please greet the Saints he's still
[4:09] got a little cough in his in his lungs
[4:12] and he said he's doing well but he he
[4:14] felt like he maybe wouldn't have the
[4:16] strength quite to preach today so amen
[4:19] um but he just wanted to greet you all
[4:20] and tell you all that he loves you amen
[4:23] and um we certainly looking for the Lord
[4:26] to just continue to touch him and his
[4:28] body amen we certainly love you and this
[4:31] this morning if we could just go to the
[4:32] Lord in a word of prayer amen if you
[4:35] have a special need this morning I I
[4:37] wonder maybe just we might do something
[4:39] a little special this morning why don't
[4:41] you just reach over and lay your hand on
[4:42] someone there and I'm going to ask you
[4:45] to pray and ask God that he' just reach
[4:49] into the need there almighty
[4:52] god father your Prophet taught us that
[4:55] Lord there was a light in the body of a
[4:58] Believer and when they laid their hands
[5:00] one on another there was an eternal
[5:02] light that passed from the human body to
[5:04] the other now Lord Jesus I can't see
[5:08] that light but I've had a prophet Lord
[5:10] to teach us and father as they begin to
[5:13] bind one to the other Lord father I know
[5:17] this morning that your anointing is real
[5:19] and as it moves across this building
[5:22] father I pray that every Spirit unlike
[5:24] you Lord would be bound and broken this
[5:27] morning by Your Word oh God and May
[5:29] there be a healing anointing in this
[5:31] room that every son and daughter of God
[5:33] would feel a liberty and a freedom Lord
[5:36] father for those that be baptized today
[5:38] may this be a service Lord like no other
[5:41] may it Electrify their heart with the
[5:43] presence of God lord as you prepare them
[5:47] Lord for a grave and a resurrection
[5:49] today we ask you for your mercy Lord
[5:51] upon this Sanctuary now Lord before your
[5:55] people I acknowledge my smallness Lord
[5:58] and my inability
[6:00] but oh God if you could just use us this
[6:02] morning For Your Glory we would praise
[6:04] you and honor you for it Lord we would
[6:07] make your grace known among your people
[6:09] Lord and we'll tell about your wonderful
[6:12] name and the works that you have
[6:13] committed Among Us Lord we ask you
[6:16] father for these things now in the
[6:18] mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[6:22] and amen and God bless you today amen
[6:26] certainly enjoyed that song service amen
[6:29] amen God bless you in the book of
[6:31] Ephesians we want to look this morning
[6:33] in the fourth
[6:34] chapter um amen I I I told you Ephesians
[6:38] 4:2 but I want to start in Ephesians 4:1
[6:40] and read down to verse 6 amen Ephesians
[6:44] uh
[6:45] 4 1 to about verse six there amen
[6:52] um what a wonderful day to serve the
[6:55] Lord huh
[6:57] amen uh 41
[7:00] uh I therefore the prisoner of the
[7:04] Lord beseech ye that you walk worthy of
[7:08] the vocation where with you are
[7:12] called with all loneliness and meekness
[7:16] with
[7:17] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[7:21] love
[7:23] endeavoring to keep the unity somebody
[7:25] say keep the unity keep the Well there
[7:28] must have been some Unity already
[7:30] there and he just wanted to keep it
[7:34] right to keep the unity of the spirit in
[7:38] the bond of
[7:40] Peace there is one
[7:42] body one Spirit even as you are called
[7:46] in one hope of your calling now watch
[7:49] that first verse and watch this one see
[7:51] in the hope of your calling so your
[7:54] calling has something to do with this uh
[7:57] scripture now one Lord and one faith and
[8:01] one baptism one God and Father of all
[8:04] who is above all and through all and in
[8:08] you all amen we love the Lord this
[8:11] morning may God bless you as you be
[8:12] seated we'd like to speak to you a
[8:15] little bit today and I want to speak to
[8:17] you here uh I'm going to exchange the
[8:19] word endeavoring for the word striving
[8:22] all righten and let's let's I want to
[8:24] speak to you if I take the title for
[8:26] this Ephesians part here I want to talk
[8:28] to you about striving
[8:30] to keep the unity somebody say keep keep
[8:33] amen we want to keep the unity amen
[8:36] because you know what we found is is
[8:38] that Paul amen and you remember I spent
[8:41] a little bit of time in the great
[8:43] separate or Great Divide between the
[8:45] Gentile church and the Jewish church but
[8:48] then Paul began to say that the middle
[8:50] wall of partition has been broke down
[8:52] that which was between us and we're both
[8:55] now which were Twain we're made one in
[8:57] Christ so he showed that there was a a
[9:00] Unity that had been brought and had the
[9:03] The Great Divide between Gentile and Jew
[9:05] you talking about it you talking about a
[9:07] gap now in lifestyles in laws in
[9:11] Traditions and in their whole lives
[9:14] there was such a even a racial divide
[9:16] amen uh H such a difference of opinions
[9:19] and you Remember The Strife even with
[9:22] Peter and Paul and and and about the
[9:24] circumcisions and the uncircumcision and
[9:26] there was just so much so much there
[9:28] amen but but what we find is is that
[9:31] Paul was saying that God is our peace
[9:34] and he's broken down the middle wall and
[9:37] then he begins to speak to us about our
[9:40] calling and he tells us that I'm a
[9:42] prisoner of the Lord and remember that
[9:44] being harnessed to an absolute and he
[9:46] said beseech ye that you would walk
[9:48] worthy of the vocation where with you
[9:51] are called so Paul knew that he had to
[9:54] walk a certain way as an apostle he knew
[9:56] there was a worthiness of his calling
[9:59] brother man preaches a whole sermon amen
[10:01] is your life worthy of the Gospel amen
[10:04] so there is a worthiness in other words
[10:06] there's a way that a Christian walks and
[10:08] it's because that he's called to be a
[10:11] Christian you know when God calls you to
[10:13] be a Christian you're not just another
[10:15] and I'll say this morning most of us
[10:17] here are American amen you're not just
[10:19] another American you're not just another
[10:21] person you remember brother B talks how
[10:23] much difference there is in the American
[10:26] Kingdom and in the Christian kingdom
[10:28] amen and just because someone's American
[10:30] don't mean they're Christian amen and
[10:32] just because someone belongs to a church
[10:34] don't mean they're a Christian but to be
[10:36] a Christian means that you have the
[10:37] Christlike Spirit which God gave us by
[10:41] the Holy Ghost and and Paul is telling
[10:43] us therefore that we ought to walk
[10:45] worthy of the vocation so he's talking
[10:47] about movement and he's talking about
[10:49] walking now one thing about the
[10:51] communion we've learned amen is that
[10:53] back in the days of our Lord they walked
[10:55] in the streets and of course if you've
[10:57] ever been uh into the middle East very
[10:59] much most uh most of them if they have
[11:02] inside bathrooms they're just poed right
[11:05] out to the street brother brother Alex
[11:07] been there in India and you had to stop
[11:09] step across that little trough when you
[11:10] come out of people's houses and the the
[11:12] sewer raw is just running right down the
[11:14] street and and the and the cattle will
[11:17] go through it and move it up on the
[11:18] street and that's why in India you
[11:20] always pull your shoes off when you go
[11:22] in people's houses cuz uh there's all
[11:24] kinds of things along the street that
[11:26] that a person would pick up when they
[11:28] walk and of course this is a lot to do
[11:31] with the custom of washing the feet back
[11:33] in the days of our Lord when they would
[11:35] wear sandals and their feet would become
[11:37] filthy and they would wash their feet as
[11:39] they come in the houses with people so
[11:41] Paul is saying therefore that as we walk
[11:44] amen we have to walk worthy of the
[11:46] vocation or the calling which God has
[11:49] gave us now each one of you this morning
[11:51] may not be called to apostleship or you
[11:53] may not be called into pastorship or
[11:55] into the Evangelist or you may not have
[11:57] the ministry of such a that but each of
[11:59] you are called To Be A Witness of Jesus
[12:02] Christ your calling is as a Christian is
[12:05] that you are to testify to this world
[12:08] that Jesus Christ resurrected on the
[12:10] third day and he's not in the Tomb in
[12:13] Jerusalem but matter of fact his spirit
[12:15] is alive in me this morning and because
[12:18] he's alive I'm alive and there is a
[12:21] Christian spirit in this Earth because
[12:23] he has sent it back into our lives and
[12:25] as we walk we're going to we're going to
[12:28] encounter situations we're going to
[12:30] encounter problems as a Christian you're
[12:33] going to walk into situations as a
[12:35] church you're going to move through
[12:37] things and as you move thank God we're
[12:38] not stagnant is that right amen we've
[12:41] had a lot of a lot of changes since I
[12:43] think 2020 we've had a church and then
[12:45] we moved to the greenhouse for a while
[12:47] and I thank God for those days I think
[12:49] the church actually grew about 50 people
[12:52] while we was at the greenhouse you know
[12:53] little did we know we was in a little
[12:55] building and there was people waiting to
[12:56] come they just didn't have a seat you
[12:58] know and so so there was a little change
[13:00] took place and we had to preach in a
[13:02] little oddness and there but you know
[13:04] the Holy Spirit used those moments and
[13:06] then we went over to the banquet and and
[13:09] then we come back over here and bought
[13:10] this assembly and we thought we'd go in
[13:12] there but it wouldn't fit by the time we
[13:14] got here so now we're going to have to
[13:16] do something else so we're constantly
[13:18] walking well as you move and as you walk
[13:21] there is opportunities amen for
[13:24] situations to arise for inconsistencies
[13:27] and and bumps into human nature and
[13:29] lives and and could I say it if you walk
[13:32] around probably going to stub your toe
[13:33] or there's going to be something you're
[13:35] going to bump against and as we move in
[13:37] this administration of a Christian Life
[13:40] we must Advance ourselves and as we
[13:43] advance we should be getting stronger
[13:45] and we should becoming more Christlike
[13:47] and we should be laying off the old man
[13:50] and moving into the newness of life and
[13:52] if we're going to walk Paul said this is
[13:54] how we must move and I love how Paul
[13:57] says this he says we must move with all
[13:59] loneliness I I I I just go back and read
[14:02] this in the second verse as we walk with
[14:04] all loneliness and meekness with
[14:07] longsuffering for bearing one another in
[14:10] love now now you don't think that ain't
[14:12] a lot you go study it a little bit but
[14:14] the scripture says with all loneliness
[14:17] now what that actually means is this
[14:19] Apostle is acting here as he's directing
[14:22] a man to walk worthy of his vocation
[14:25] he's saying to to fulfill this calling
[14:28] you have to walk lowly now if you want
[14:30] to ride a high horse you'll never do it
[14:32] in the kingdom of God the kingdom of God
[14:36] doesn't have high horses all of them are
[14:39] the spirit of loneliness and meekness
[14:42] amen the scripture tells us with all
[14:44] loneliness now the word loneliness
[14:46] actually is just speaking of the word
[14:48] humility as you walk in humility now
[14:52] amen I'll tell you it's a it's a
[14:53] powerful place to walk and I know amen
[14:56] that it's not the easiest position to
[14:58] walk in humility amen because it seems
[15:01] like you get walked on a lot but let me
[15:03] say this amen if you walk in Christian
[15:06] Life you're going to have to walk humble
[15:08] because that's what God called you to
[15:10] was to humility now the prophet tells us
[15:13] this and I'll say this with all my heart
[15:16] and I found it to be true and the most
[15:18] powerful thing that a Believer could
[15:20] ever have is humility because humility
[15:23] brother Bram said the Way Up Is Down
[15:26] amen now now man's got it all messed up
[15:28] he thinks the way up is up and the way
[15:30] down is down but the prophet said the
[15:32] Way Up Is Down amen because we put it
[15:35] upside down now Jesus said let the
[15:37] greatest among you be the servant of all
[15:41] now amen if you ever thought maybe that
[15:43] once a man becomes a pastor you know he
[15:45] gets to do what he wants and have what
[15:47] he wants and acts like he wants now you
[15:49] got that all messed up amen because he
[15:51] becomes the servant of everyone he he
[15:53] probably has less of his opinion than
[15:56] any person in this building amen you you
[15:59] have to give up and and I won't tell you
[16:00] too much about the calling but I'll say
[16:02] this you can't have any of yourself left
[16:04] if you're going to lead you you just got
[16:06] to completely die to all your feelings
[16:09] all your thoughts all your opinions
[16:11] everything because you know if if you're
[16:14] if you're going to be in the office of
[16:16] pastorship it's an office of a shepherd
[16:18] and and what I found out is this is the
[16:21] great Shepherd is Jesus Christ and he's
[16:24] The Shepherd of this church amen amen
[16:27] there's just one Shepherd of the church
[16:28] church and I found that if we get out of
[16:31] his way he's a great Shepherd amen and
[16:34] he can lead every family and he can he
[16:36] the best thing that can be done for your
[16:38] life amen is that the Holy Spirit can
[16:41] get a man and he can press him and
[16:43] humble him and and and and and it would
[16:45] be it' be wonderful if you could stand
[16:47] up here and feel proud and pride amen
[16:50] but but you find out all of a sudden
[16:52] there's no pride in you because you know
[16:53] you can't do nothing you can't help
[16:55] nobody Everything You Touch falls apart
[16:58] every everything you try to personally
[17:00] get involved in it blows up on you after
[17:03] a while you find yourself in a prayer
[17:04] closet throwing your hands up and saying
[17:06] like brother Bram I'm not a hunter I'm
[17:08] not a preacher I'm not a leader I'm a
[17:10] servant of you Lord and whatever you
[17:12] want to do just come and do and then
[17:15] comes the power of God because it's not
[17:18] a man taking the glory it's God taking
[17:21] the glory listen if you got anything to
[17:23] boast of this morning I say you are to
[17:25] boast in this that God gave you the Holy
[17:28] Ghost and gave you the love of God and
[17:30] you've got a family and you got people
[17:32] around you because God is merciful to
[17:35] give this to you and if you're going to
[17:37] walk you have to walk in humility if
[17:40] you're going to walk with God Amen watch
[17:43] this Greek word here it actually means
[17:46] Amen to compare it we'll go to the book
[17:48] of SC of Acts chapter 2019 and let's
[17:51] just read this here serving the Lord
[17:53] with all humility of
[17:55] Mind serving the Lord with all humility
[17:58] of mind Philippians 2 and3 let nothing
[18:01] be done through Strife or vain Glory but
[18:03] in the loneliness of mind isn't this
[18:06] something in Colossians 2:18 he says let
[18:09] no man begal you of your reward
[18:13] involuntary
[18:15] humility voluntarily humble nobody has
[18:19] to make you that way nobody has to beat
[18:21] you into it you're just voluntarily low
[18:24] of mind and humbled in spirit amen let
[18:27] no man rob you of that that in
[18:29] Colossians 2 and 23 which things indeed
[18:32] show wisdom in a worship and humility
[18:34] and neglecting of the body not in the
[18:36] honor to satisfying of the flesh colians
[18:39] Colossians 3 and12 put therefore the
[18:41] elect of God holy belov barels of Mercy
[18:44] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and
[18:48] longsuffering amen F first Peter 5 and5
[18:51] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[18:53] to the Elder yay of all you be subject
[18:55] one to other and be clothed with
[18:58] humility
[19:00] for God resisteth somebody say resist
[19:03] resist he resisteth the proud and giveth
[19:07] grace to the humble I don't want God
[19:09] resisting me so I want to Humble where
[19:12] God can give grace to the humble now
[19:15] it's something to me here because amen
[19:17] the idea is the humility of Mind amen
[19:21] becomes to those who are called they
[19:23] will walk worthy of their calling in
[19:26] humility let me give you that Greek word
[19:28] here and I and I'd have to spell it I
[19:30] there's no way I could pronounce it amen
[19:32] but it actually means to be humble of
[19:34] Mind lowly to be lowly is to Humble of
[19:38] mind the having of a humble opinion of
[19:43] oneself this hey look studying this I I
[19:45] thought I'd get under my desk you know
[19:47] time or two listen to this he says a
[19:49] deep sense of one's moral
[19:53] littleness modesty humility loneliness
[19:56] of mind now what he's saying amen be be
[19:59] if you're going to walk you're going to
[20:01] have to have a sense of your littleness
[20:03] now we could each of us pick up our big
[20:06] side and and we could make what good
[20:08] parts we have shine but here Paul is
[20:10] saying to walk you've got to walk in
[20:13] Humble mind aware of your littleness
[20:17] it's odd because this is what brother
[20:18] Bram teaches in influence of another he
[20:20] said be conscience he said one thing to
[20:23] be conscious of is your littleness if
[20:25] you want to get somewhere with God make
[20:28] yourself real
[20:31] little the Walk of humility and
[20:34] influence in 1963 brother bam tells us
[20:37] that the prophet Isaiah goes in the
[20:39] presence of God and when he sees the
[20:41] presence of God he covers his feet
[20:43] speaking of a man's walk he must walk in
[20:48] humility amen even when Moses when the
[20:51] presence of God take off your shoes
[20:53] Moses right now now brother Danny
[20:56] steeman one time years ago he's
[20:57] preaching I thought it was was beautiful
[20:59] he said you know Moses and Sephora had a
[21:01] lot of fun back out there on the back
[21:03] side of the desert brother Bram said she
[21:05] was as hot-tempered as he was and he
[21:07] said it actually he said they God did
[21:09] that to take it out of him is that right
[21:12] he said Sephora was Moses's cross he it
[21:15] crucified his Humanity amen and and
[21:17] brother brother Danny he got to laugh
[21:19] and he said he said you know what he
[21:21] said God was in sefar before he ever met
[21:24] Moses in the bush he said because the
[21:26] first thing that happened when Moses
[21:27] come in the presence of God he said take
[21:29] your shoes off he said how many times
[21:31] Sephora had said that amen take off your
[21:34] shoes you know so so you recognize that
[21:37] God can be in the thing that's rubbing
[21:39] you amen before you ever get into his
[21:42] presence preparing you to be humble to
[21:45] be humble in mind to not think so much
[21:48] amen that when you come into the
[21:49] presence of God it's easily to be
[21:52] humbled brother B said you see you
[21:54] you're you're actually nothing he said
[21:56] take a glass of water put your hand the
[21:58] water pull it out he says you see that's
[22:01] what's going to happen when they bury
[22:02] you he said they're going to have a
[22:04] funeral procession he said then after
[22:06] that people's going to start forgetting
[22:07] about you he said but your influence is
[22:10] going to live on and on Amen the
[22:13] influence that you had in life so be
[22:15] conscious of your littleness amen be
[22:17] conscious not of how big you are but of
[22:20] how little you are you're small and when
[22:22] we're that way God can if God can do
[22:25] nothing without us but we can do can't
[22:28] do do without him see see our littleness
[22:31] amen even if a prophet a Vindicated
[22:33] Prophet had to get little in the
[22:35] presence of God brother B said what it
[22:37] ought to do to you and
[22:39] I amen it ought to bring a loneliness
[22:42] now just stay with me a minute we'll go
[22:44] we're just building here a little bit
[22:45] amen don't don't get too excited amen
[22:48] it's a littleness of Mind a and watch
[22:50] what he said with all loneliness and
[22:52] with all meekness and I I think this is
[22:55] powerful cuz we're going to deal with a
[22:56] couple of spirits here amen what's he
[22:59] doing he's talking about loneliness and
[23:01] now he's going to compare that with
[23:03] meekness now meekness actually is the
[23:06] opposite to anger and IR irbil of
[23:08] disposition in other words when me when
[23:11] you're Meek you're able to receive
[23:14] injury without
[23:15] retaliation see what what meekness
[23:18] considers is how you receive injury to
[23:20] yourself other words if you feel real
[23:22] big if you're a real big person and
[23:24] you're real important the slightest
[23:26] things offend you because how dare they
[23:29] talk about me like that how dare they
[23:31] act like that toward me how dare see the
[23:34] bigger you get the more offended people
[23:36] are but the smaller you become you're
[23:38] surprised people are nice to you you're
[23:41] surprised somebody wants to shake your
[23:42] hand the smaller you get amen the better
[23:45] things are for you somebody gives you a
[23:48] gift if you're great big and you don't
[23:49] think much about it but if you're just
[23:51] nothing and you ain't got nothing
[23:52] somebody gives you a gift man it just
[23:54] really just swells I don't deserve to
[23:57] get this and and they did this for me
[23:59] amen so listen you don't want to see how
[24:01] big you want to see how little and come
[24:03] into the meekness of the spirit listen
[24:06] now somebody said well if I become Meek
[24:08] somebody's going to run over me well
[24:10] listen meekness don't mean
[24:12] weakness don't don't mix up meekness and
[24:16] weakness because in Numbers Chapter 12
[24:18] the Bible said Moses was very Meek and
[24:21] said he was Meek above all of the men on
[24:23] the face of the Earth amen but watch
[24:25] what happens when Meek people become
[24:27] really
[24:28] but the Bible tells us in this very
[24:30] verse of scripture that they got to
[24:32] talking about him at the Tabernacle and
[24:34] when they did God said Moses separate
[24:36] yourself and he put leprosy on them
[24:38] because he said to them look this man
[24:40] Moses is different than everybody else
[24:42] he might must be the meekest person he
[24:45] said but other people have dreams and
[24:47] they have visions but this man I speak
[24:49] live to hear with and if you want to get
[24:51] in a talking relationship with God see
[24:54] how low you can become see how Meek you
[24:57] can become don't worry about somebody
[24:59] running over you we've got a Shepherd to
[25:01] protect us we got a Shepherd that's over
[25:04] our soul listen lay down on the floor
[25:06] and let them walk over you but there's a
[25:08] God that'll take up for you there's a
[25:11] God that'll stand by you in the middle
[25:13] of it listen it don't matter what we do
[25:15] or what others do let them do what they
[25:17] want to just be meek in the spirit and
[25:20] let him be the shepherd of your soul
[25:23] I'll tell you what amen if you're
[25:25] protecting yourself amen you'll become a
[25:27] very arrogant and
[25:29] [Music]
[25:31] mean it's the truth you become defensive
[25:35] you have a complex then nobody can help
[25:37] you nobody can correct you nobody can
[25:39] talk to you because they're trying to
[25:41] destroy you but as you become
[25:44] meaker as you become
[25:46] lowly look what happens it's the manner
[25:49] and how you receive an
[25:51] injury we're actually to Bear one
[25:54] another patiently and not retaliate or
[25:57] seek
[25:58] Revenge woo Hallelujah somebody amen
[26:02] better put the seat belts on and close
[26:04] the
[26:05] doors amen how are we to retaliate not
[26:08] with Envy not with revenge in mind come
[26:11] on church amen we're to receive injury
[26:14] amen Without Anger or without desire of
[26:17] Revenge with a mild and forgiving
[26:22] Spirit hallelujah amen I tell you what
[26:25] brother amen there's got to come a time
[26:27] in our lives the scripture actually says
[26:29] it that you actually can have a
[26:31] conscience void of offense wouldn't that
[26:34] be something this morning if you had a
[26:36] conscience That Couldn't retain offenses
[26:38] wouldn't it be something if you were so
[26:40] built that every offense come in when
[26:42] out it's just like your car when it goes
[26:44] firing off and you drove to to the
[26:46] church this morning there's something
[26:48] happening in that car it's firing and
[26:50] when it fires the Pistons move and the
[26:52] valves move and the combustion has a has
[26:55] an exhaust and it goes right out the
[26:57] tailpipe well you let that tailpipe stop
[26:59] up and see how far you get so there's
[27:01] got to come something happening and when
[27:03] things happen something's got to get out
[27:05] and as long as you got people together
[27:07] there's going to be offenses that happen
[27:09] it's not how you get offended it's how
[27:11] you deal with the offense when it comes
[27:14] listen it is human to be offended but it
[27:17] is divine to forgive and the Forgiveness
[27:20] of God Amen comes through loneliness of
[27:22] mind and the meekness of our spirit I
[27:26] tell you what let me say this you said
[27:28] preacher it's going to run over me but
[27:29] can I say what Jesus said he said
[27:31] blessed are the meek they shall inherit
[27:35] the earth listen you might not get the
[27:37] respect you think you need but you're
[27:39] going to get the Earth itself you will
[27:41] be in the Millennium when it comes for
[27:43] blessed are the peacemakers blessed are
[27:46] the meek for they shall see God isn't it
[27:49] beautiful blessed are the meek amen now
[27:51] you know brother bam says it he says see
[27:54] knowing that you're an heir to the
[27:55] promise not because you deserve it
[27:57] because God has promised
[28:00] it now listen not because you've done
[28:03] something but God's G you the same kind
[28:05] of promise when you're dead in Christ
[28:07] and take on Abraham's seed you're Heir
[28:09] with Abraham and the promise and the
[28:10] only way you could be Heir is to be dead
[28:13] to yourself and to take on the Seed of
[28:15] Abraham isn't the promise to Abraham and
[28:18] his seed it was given unto him in Romans
[28:20] 4 to be the heir of the earth so all the
[28:23] promises that you're connected to is to
[28:25] be heir of the earth is through AB
[28:28] Abraham but the only way to be Abraham's
[28:30] seed is to be dead in Christ by the
[28:33] baptism of the spirit and you can kick a
[28:35] dead man but what
[28:39] happens I know sometimes I feel more
[28:42] alive cuz somebody kicks me and I want
[28:43] to say something but I say hey you got
[28:45] to die boy amen listen let me let me can
[28:48] I can I just get out there can we just
[28:50] preach a little bit when somebody kicks
[28:52] you if there's a comeback you're not
[28:54] dead you need to die a little more you
[28:56] just need to die a little more you said
[28:58] preacher I died yesterday but Paul said
[29:01] I got to Die daily and brother B said if
[29:03] Paul had to Die daily in that day he
[29:06] said we'll have to die more today than
[29:08] we did
[29:09] then kind of like a fellow I was up
[29:11] there in candada one time and I was
[29:12] preaching he was quite an older
[29:14] gentleman hey man had a head full of jet
[29:16] black hair got to talking to him and I
[29:18] said man I said what what how how in the
[29:21] world you keep hair like that he said
[29:23] brother he said no offenses in me he
[29:24] said I Die daily I said oh man that's
[29:27] good I said' really how do you do that
[29:29] and I think he said it was clar all or
[29:31] Harris for man or
[29:33] something he died every day I don't
[29:36] really think that's what it was talking
[29:37] about I think dying daily is dying out
[29:40] to our flesh amen dying out to who we
[29:43] are dying out to offenses listen if it's
[29:45] offended today don't carry it to
[29:47] tomorrow let the thing go and say God
[29:50] it's in your hands and we're going to
[29:52] Mar into the power of God we are walking
[29:54] on Church forgetting the things which
[29:57] are behind the and let us press to the
[29:59] calling of the high listen I don't know
[30:02] about you but in a hundred years from
[30:03] now we won't care who picked the color
[30:05] of the carpets we won't care are are you
[30:08] hearing me now we won't care amen who
[30:10] set the temperature or whether it was
[30:11] hot or was it cold who's even going to
[30:13] remember some of these
[30:15] [Applause]
[30:17] things but as you die is the Seed of
[30:20] Abraham now the Seed of Abraham was them
[30:22] if you watch this when God came to
[30:24] Abraham he told him because you're the
[30:26] heir of the earth I won't hold my
[30:28] secrets from
[30:30] thee as you die you set yourself in
[30:34] position to see the revelation of the
[30:37] word when you die from yourself and you
[30:41] die what happens is you open your spirit
[30:44] to the spirit of Revelation and the
[30:46] message of the hour can become brand new
[30:48] to you listen the Bible said we are in a
[30:51] Warfare is that right we're in a Warfare
[30:53] this is not a recreation game this is
[30:56] not a game this is a fire it's not a
[30:58] game now that you ever hear that song
[31:01] Run if you want to run if you will but I
[31:02] come here to stay amen it's a powerful
[31:05] song because really it's talking about
[31:07] Christian warfare that's what we're here
[31:09] this morning as soldiers amen and as we
[31:12] fight the fight of Faith we've got to
[31:14] learn to walk so as that we can be
[31:16] conquering and victorious in our walk
[31:19] now this is this is the thing as you as
[31:21] you see that we should cast down every
[31:23] imagination bringing it subject to the
[31:25] word of God in other words don't allow
[31:27] the devil
[31:30] to cut your mind off from the
[31:33] word because of issues in your family in
[31:37] your church in your
[31:41] lives I'm preaching to
[31:44] you you know complexes has robbed more
[31:47] joy than anything I know
[31:49] of it's odd sometimes sometimes I mean I
[31:52] tell people all the time I say I I
[31:54] apologize for things I never did never
[31:57] said never thought never
[32:01] felt because of another person the way
[32:03] they view
[32:04] things they take injury when there's no
[32:08] injury
[32:09] meant they take offense when there's no
[32:12] offense meant but it's how you're
[32:14] receiving it so what we want to do is
[32:17] change our
[32:19] receiver we want to we want to become
[32:21] Meek so that we can receive without
[32:24] injury with all meekness now now y'all
[32:27] y'all know I'm PR preaching right there
[32:28] with Joseph y'all now there ain't nobody
[32:30] ever been done more wrong than
[32:33] he and when his Brethren come he met
[32:36] them with meekness and said what the
[32:38] devil meant for evil God used for
[32:41] good that's why I can say this morning
[32:44] is nothing the devil can do against the
[32:46] Church of the Living God if God before
[32:48] us who can be against us KN in all
[32:51] things we are more and conquerors in
[32:53] Christ Jesus amen to him that is called
[32:57] according to the purpose amen listen all
[32:59] things work together and there ain't
[33:01] nothing the devil can do because God who
[33:04] is rich in Mercy has gave us Mercy when
[33:06] we didn't deserve Mercy but this morning
[33:09] Hallelujah we've got a glory and a unity
[33:12] and I don't know about you but I plan on
[33:14] keeping
[33:16] it I say Satan you can't have the unity
[33:19] of twt I say you can't have the unity of
[33:23] the ministry you can't have the unity of
[33:25] our youth you can't have the unity of
[33:28] our Brotherhood I say take your hands
[33:30] off Satan you are trespassing on the
[33:33] places of almighty God and there's one
[33:36] preacher in this building this morning
[33:38] that'll say we won't settle with the
[33:40] devil we won't lay our Downs down and
[33:43] forget it I say Satan has no
[33:46] rights he got no rights in the house of
[33:50] [Applause]
[33:52] God no land for peace deals around here
[33:58] I tell you something funny the other day
[33:59] brother brother CLE come from over in
[34:01] Hager toown is a year ago I I ain't been
[34:04] over in a year or better he said brother
[34:06] why you come over on a Wednesday night
[34:07] there preach for us and he said uh he
[34:11] said it's pretty amazing he said I had a
[34:13] court case I was in court with and I was
[34:15] trying to decide what to do and my
[34:17] lawyer told me to settle on this land
[34:19] dispute he said you come over and pre
[34:21] y'all probably remember the message on
[34:23] squatters he said you come over and
[34:25] preached on squatters he said you didn't
[34:27] we ain't going to deal with the devil
[34:29] and we ain't going to settle with the
[34:31] devil that's they ain't no it's legally
[34:34] belongs to us and that's all he said
[34:36] that day I'd prayed and asked God for a
[34:37] direct answer on the lamb
[34:41] dispute he said I took it as a word of
[34:43] the Lord his lawyer thought he was
[34:46] crazy but when it was all settled almost
[34:49] a year later the judge Agreed 100% with
[34:52] his case but even his own lawyer was
[34:55] wondering if he was going to win well
[34:57] let me say something to you this morning
[34:59] you've already
[35:00] won let me tell you the judge has
[35:03] already
[35:04] spoken and you got to ever right to tell
[35:06] the devil not today devil and somebody
[35:10] somebody told Bethany one day seen a
[35:11] sign said she wearing a shirt said not
[35:13] today devil and some old boy looked at
[35:15] and said then when she said never and I
[35:18] tell you I say the same thing not today
[35:20] not tomorrow not next week not the next
[35:22] week I say never devil you will never
[35:25] put Your Filthy Hands on the Church of
[35:28] the Living God but by the authority of
[35:31] the word of God we adure
[35:34] thee hallelujah hallelujah I think it's
[35:37] time just to rejoice in the presence of
[35:39] the Lord it's mine and I'm going to keep
[35:44] it Hallelujah blessed are the meat for
[35:47] they shall inherit the earth I will not
[35:50] keep things back from them that's going
[35:51] to inherit the earth how much more will
[35:54] we reveal the secrets to the church as
[35:56] going to inherit the earth he wouldn't
[35:58] keep it from Abraham and he won't keep
[36:00] it from the children of Israel from you
[36:04] if we live in the spirit we ought to
[36:07] walk in the spirit in Galatians 6 the
[36:09] Bible said we are to restore in the
[36:12] spirit of
[36:13] meekness if you think you're
[36:16] spiritual amen and I know a lot of you
[36:19] are but if somebody be overtaken in The
[36:21] Fault let the
[36:24] spiritual let the one that is spiritual
[36:27] now spiritual don't and Y y'all got to
[36:31] forgive me now but can I say it you know
[36:33] back when I was a kid they had a they
[36:35] had a show called Bozo he was a clown
[36:39] and he went around and give everybody a
[36:40] button you know like the kid knew the
[36:42] answer he' give them a little button
[36:44] well let me say this finding a fault in
[36:47] your brother is not going to get you a
[36:49] bozo
[36:55] button can can I can I can I give you
[36:58] another
[37:00] one usually the people that see the most
[37:03] fault are the most
[37:09] troubled sometimes you feel spiritual
[37:11] because you see all the
[37:13] problems but sometimes you're living so
[37:16] much in the flesh that that's all you're
[37:19] paying attention
[37:21] to and the more you look the more
[37:24] trouble you have and the more you focus
[37:27] the the more overcome you are you ever
[37:29] noticed that when you start seeing
[37:31] problems in other people's lives it
[37:32] don't make you feel spiritual have you
[37:34] ever noticed that you if you ever
[37:36] noticed you never seeing a problem in
[37:38] somebody's life say oh I want to get
[37:39] closer to
[37:41] God some reason it makes you say well I
[37:43] wonder if there's any truth to anything
[37:45] I wonder if that church has got I wonder
[37:47] if this isn't that
[37:49] odd see but what it is is if you have
[37:52] the spirit of meekness you could
[37:54] consider that yourself you have
[37:59] problems and I know we can't talk about
[38:01] them this
[38:04] morning
[38:06] amen do you see we ought to restore in
[38:09] the spirit of meekness brother Ram tells
[38:11] us about it right he says don't never
[38:13] let no little ISM or something a little
[38:15] bad feeling ever rise up amongst you get
[38:17] it out of the way next
[38:21] month oh it ain't like that he said get
[38:24] it out of the way right now
[38:28] I like that one you know why because the
[38:31] longer you leave it the more it
[38:33] festers and bitterness
[38:35] destroys it's kind of like shooting your
[38:37] muzzle loer in the fall and don't clean
[38:40] it to the
[38:41] spring if that's real gunpowder just
[38:44] don't clean it throw it away you're
[38:46] going to need a new gun cuz it's going
[38:48] to corrode everything involved and the
[38:50] longer offenses stay in lives the more
[38:53] corrosion and the more trouble and you
[38:56] know you and and the more things you
[38:59] have said and the more people you have
[39:01] talked to and the more trouble has come
[39:05] and now you're looking how am I going to
[39:06] fix this I go
[39:09] no call that person and I got to talk
[39:12] that
[39:13] person but if it would have just been
[39:15] fixed right
[39:17] away now I'm telling you that for a
[39:20] reason don't think that you can take
[39:22] milk out of the fridge and put it
[39:24] outside and it'll be better tomorrow
[39:28] it's not getting
[39:29] better if you got an issue in your
[39:31] marriage don't think living in separate
[39:33] homes for 6 months is going to fix
[39:35] it and any man that tells you that don't
[39:39] know nothing about the
[39:41] gospel that may be in a Christian
[39:44] counseling or some counselor's book
[39:45] somewhere but unless that man is
[39:48] grievously grievously evil in some
[39:52] manner if there's an issue in a home you
[39:54] know what needs to happen if you can't
[39:56] forgive him and he can't forgive you
[39:58] then you ought to go back to
[40:01] Calvary and you ought to get right with
[40:03] God and get down at an altar and pray
[40:06] till that Unforgiven Spirit gets out of
[40:08] your heart come on church amen there
[40:11] ought to be a Oneness in a Christian
[40:13] marriage and it ought to be a life of
[40:15] forgiveness and loneliness and meekness
[40:17] until you can live with one another and
[40:19] if you can't do that amen get your
[40:22] experience with God because that's what
[40:24] it's going to take in this in this
[40:26] atmosphere in this age you can't just
[40:29] have two in a marriage it takes three in
[40:31] a marriage it takes a husband it takes a
[40:34] wife and it takes God and if God is the
[40:37] office above all of it and the man is
[40:39] below God and the woman is below the man
[40:42] you'll see a home that'll strike Harmony
[40:45] and the power of God will FL through
[40:46] that come on don't you tell me it's
[40:48] better to live alone no it's better to
[40:50] fix our wrongs and get ourselves
[40:54] right hey glory to God somebody shout
[40:58] hallelujah you know I'm telling you the
[41:01] truth a Christian ought to have
[41:03] loneliness of mind he ought to have
[41:05] meekness of spirit he ought to have
[41:07] longsuffering and forbearing one with
[41:10] another we ought to be patient with one
[41:12] another's
[41:13] faults I'm just preaching now that isn't
[41:16] this amazing because he said bear
[41:18] patiently faults one of the other your
[41:23] infirmities now you said preacher how do
[41:25] we do that turn to 1 Corinthians 13
[41:27] verse 4 to
[41:30] 7 now this this just this reading is to
[41:33] me is phenomenal charity suffereth long
[41:37] there's your longsuffering so brother
[41:39] Wayne how could I get longsuffering get
[41:41] in
[41:43] love get in love with God and you'll
[41:46] love everybody else do you know that's
[41:49] the one relationship that affects every
[41:51] other relationship yes sir if you really
[41:53] really really really really fall in love
[41:55] with God then you're going to love love
[41:57] his children and you're going to try to
[41:59] help his children now now I I know you
[42:02] know when back years ago I was with a
[42:03] brother he was an older brother wasn't a
[42:05] preacher me and him was just visiting
[42:07] we're talking and he said to me he said
[42:09] brother Wayne did you ever notice
[42:10] something he said if it's somebody that
[42:13] you really really really really love he
[42:16] said you sit in a room and let people
[42:17] start talking about him he said you'll
[42:20] defend them he said you won't hardly set
[42:23] still until you have to say well but man
[42:26] there might be something else there
[42:28] there you you you'll come up with some
[42:29] little defense he said but if you don't
[42:32] like the
[42:33] guy he said when somebody starts talking
[42:36] he said you'll pull up a chair and
[42:38] listen and he said you'll actually pull
[42:40] on them a little
[42:42] bit do you see you say preacher why
[42:45] would you say that because if you would
[42:46] love everybody the
[42:49] same now some of you can put up with a
[42:52] lot from some
[42:55] people but let the let another person do
[42:59] the same thing and see how differently
[43:01] you act then that tells you that you
[43:04] have a hierarchy of
[43:09] personalities well we come to church
[43:10] this morning did
[43:12] we so find the person you're most
[43:15] patient with and you're the most
[43:17] forbearing with and you're the most
[43:19] longsuffering with and then love
[43:21] everybody else as if it was that person
[43:23] and your life will become uh uh it'll
[43:26] become a complete completely different
[43:28] life because now you're loving one
[43:31] another do you know that's the only debt
[43:32] you owe to God he said the debt of love
[43:35] that you should love one another as
[43:37] Christ has loved the church now watch
[43:39] this suffereth long as kind chth envieth
[43:43] not it vauth not itself it's not puffed
[43:47] up it does not behave itself unseemly it
[43:50] seeketh not her own is not
[43:53] easily that didn't say that
[43:58] that is not
[44:02] easily
[44:05] thinketh well that's so hard to say
[44:07] ain't
[44:10] it I know he said that
[44:13] because I know she said that because you
[44:17] know it don't think
[44:20] evil I'm I'm talking about transitioning
[44:23] your whole
[44:25] life I'm talking about walking in a room
[44:28] and filling Joy
[44:32] again amen when you don't think no evil
[44:35] you don't rejoice in iniquity but
[44:38] rejoice in truth beareth all things
[44:41] believeth all things hopeth all things
[44:43] watch this
[44:46] endureth all things do you see what it
[44:48] is the virtue of longsuffering may be
[44:51] the most manifested virtue in our manner
[44:54] of
[44:56] Lifestyle listen I'll tell you this if
[44:59] you're going to walk with human beings
[45:01] longsuffering and forbearing is going to
[45:04] be one of the most essential
[45:06] parts of your life because you can bear
[45:10] long with someone meaning you're going
[45:12] to have more need of
[45:14] this because of your contacts with
[45:17] humans now I wish we were all I wish we
[45:20] were as all as perfect as
[45:25] Isaac but we're
[45:31] not I don't know if he's I don't know if
[45:33] he's capable of thinking a mean
[45:35] thought and I had to throw away three to
[45:38] get the right
[45:41] on I'm tell you it took a lot of God to
[45:44] save
[45:47] me but he saved me so if he did it for
[45:52] me I believe he could just do it for
[45:55] anybody now what is it amen what is it
[45:57] it's not really how A Supernatural
[46:00] person I love Jason Krab has a beautiful
[46:03] song it's not how you walk on
[46:06] water I'd love to see somebody walk on
[46:09] water but I'd lot rather see them walk
[46:11] in this Spirit on
[46:13] land I'd lot rather see the Paradox of a
[46:17] human being with so much love in their
[46:20] heart that they were quick to forgive
[46:22] they were long to
[46:23] rebuke wouldn't it wouldn't it be
[46:25] something such a paradox
[46:27] to see a human being but you see God has
[46:30] committed this Paradox in us there are
[46:33] so many dangers of Divisions in the
[46:35] Church of the Living God but God made us
[46:37] one and I'll say this with every danger
[46:40] of division with every danger of
[46:42] dissatisfaction with every danger of dis
[46:44] unification there's a God who Still
[46:47] Remains on the throne of our hearts to
[46:49] war against it as we walk with Longs
[46:51] suffering and forbearance and meekness
[46:53] you said preacher what are you doing I'm
[46:55] talking to you about keeping the unity
[46:57] because if you're going to keep Unity
[46:59] you're going to have to keep the spirit
[47:01] that keeps unity in the Church of the
[47:03] Living God do you know what Unity let me
[47:05] say this the unity is the most precious
[47:07] thing that you can have as a
[47:09] church and I just want to I just want to
[47:12] clarify to the whole world I want to
[47:14] tell the devil and all of his angels
[47:16] there is unity in True Word
[47:20] Tabernacle there is Unity so well I know
[47:22] this one fusses and that and said this
[47:24] and that and said that that's not what
[47:25] we're talking about you're never going
[47:27] to get past disagreements amen what you
[47:29] have is a Oneness of purpose you have a
[47:32] unity of life we're going in the rapture
[47:35] we believe this message we're willing to
[47:37] sacrifice our own ideas our own thoughts
[47:40] our own lives amen so that we might walk
[47:43] in the presence of God Unity Amen in the
[47:46] presence of God how beautiful it is I
[47:48] love how it says in Psalms 133 behold
[47:51] how good and how pleasant is it for
[47:53] Brethren to dwell together in unity it
[47:56] is like precious ointment upon the head
[47:59] that ran down upon the beard even
[48:01] Aaron's beard and went down to the
[48:03] skirts of his garments as the de of
[48:06] Hermon as the de that descended upon the
[48:09] mountains of Zion for the Lord commanded
[48:12] his Blessing even life forever more so
[48:15] what you're seeing is David was saying
[48:17] this stuff's so precious that it makes
[48:19] it powerful it actually was like the oil
[48:23] that was on the beard of Aaron that ran
[48:25] down now the brother breaks this down I
[48:27] won't read all these to you but I'll
[48:29] tell you I got the quotes brother Bram
[48:31] breaks this down and he said it was
[48:33] required of them to go in the presence
[48:35] of God now Unity is required of the
[48:39] church to go into the presence of God
[48:42] Unity is required a Unity of purpose a
[48:45] Unity of Oneness listen let me say this
[48:48] amen if you get the right purpose in
[48:50] your life you can sacrifice everything
[48:52] else for that purpose so when your
[48:55] purpose becomes great greater than your
[48:57] personal thought then purpose will rule
[49:00] in unity in a church or in a house or in
[49:03] a
[49:05] home amen now now watch what's happening
[49:08] it's required to go into the presence of
[49:10] God y'all know when you get in the
[49:12] presence of God everything else changes
[49:14] right so what you see sometimes what you
[49:17] really need to do is we you just lay
[49:19] down whatever it is and then get in the
[49:23] presence of God and then the presence of
[49:26] God will make everything else coming to
[49:27] line so you don't have to you don't have
[49:30] to get it all you just got to get in the
[49:32] presence of God and how do you do that
[49:34] just lay it all aside and I'll say this
[49:36] amen I I I I want to I want to give a
[49:38] rose where roses due true word
[49:40] Tabernacle is absolutely to me the
[49:43] greatest assembly on the
[49:45] planet all right you may have another
[49:48] favorite assembly and I say God bless
[49:50] you this is my favorite assembly it's my
[49:52] favorite pull pit this is my favorite
[49:54] group you to preacher how could you feel
[49:57] that way how could I
[49:59] not it really don't matter what's going
[50:01] on you people come to the house of the
[50:03] Lord lay it all aside and shout and
[50:06] worship and praise and receive the word
[50:08] of God Amen I've seen some of you come
[50:11] through great afflictions of lefts and
[50:13] lives and troubles and trials of every
[50:15] situation in your homes and tragedies
[50:18] but that never stopped
[50:20] you because you were trained to know if
[50:23] I could just get in the presence of God
[50:26] it's going to be okay everything's going
[50:28] to be okay if I could just get in the
[50:31] presence of God sometimes you feel like
[50:34] crawling in the back door but by the
[50:36] time the service is over you're ready to
[50:38] shout out in the middle of the parking
[50:40] lot and let the whole world know because
[50:43] we are the Church of the Living God
[50:47] hallelujah I say lay it all aside and
[50:49] let the power of God move us in the
[50:51] presence of God it's precious this
[50:54] morning Unity is precious it's worth
[50:57] giving up everything
[51:00] for Hallelujah it preserves a man to go
[51:03] in the presence of God when Brethren can
[51:06] dwell together in unity he said preacher
[51:09] you want Unity no I want to keep Unity
[51:13] cuz we already have
[51:16] it if you have something you won't keep
[51:20] it listen
[51:22] now if you ever get a new Cadillac you
[51:26] probably going to want to keep
[51:29] it if you ever get a new fishing
[51:33] boat you're going to want to keep it
[51:36] somebody can thr well you saving for
[51:37] boat nope got
[51:40] one I'm just trying to keep
[51:45] it you got to make that payment
[51:48] yall I'm just trying to keep
[51:51] it so why you don't have to do nothing
[51:53] well they can come and get it too
[51:56] so if I neglect what's supposed to be
[51:59] done I probably can't keep it come on
[52:02] you're living in a house you got to keep
[52:05] you got a house but you're paying you
[52:06] got to keep it you don't have to find it
[52:09] you already bought it but you got to
[52:11] keep it so you got to do what is
[52:12] possible to keep it and I say that that
[52:15] the unity of this assembly is so
[52:18] precious that we'll pay the payment to
[52:20] keep it and if it's my opinion your
[52:23] opinion somebody else's opinion what is
[52:25] an opinion worth
[52:29] anyhow my my old Granddad he used to say
[52:32] son opinions like ails everybody's got
[52:34] them and they raise them up and
[52:39] down y'all getting a lot of hillbilly
[52:41] sayans lately ain't you they're just a
[52:43] flying out
[52:46] there but you got it didn't you it's
[52:50] simple but it's the truth see opinions
[52:52] change telling us the value of an
[52:55] opinion is only good at certain moments
[52:58] cuz even the person with the opinion
[53:00] only holds it till they find out it
[53:01] ain't
[53:04] good and then they say who thought of
[53:06] that
[53:08] anyhow a bad
[53:11] idea so opinions are they're not they're
[53:14] not they're not
[53:15] Priceless opinions are not that valuable
[53:19] that you couldn't trade it for
[53:24] Unity right
[53:26] now if you had a young person sitting
[53:27] here today and you trying to get them
[53:29] the Holy Ghost and you knew that you
[53:31] needed an
[53:33] atmosphere and let's just say you had a
[53:35] $100 bill in your pocket and you knew if
[53:37] I put this $100 bill in that offering
[53:40] that's all it would cost to get
[53:45] Unity well Unity is not bought with
[53:50] money but it is the surrendering of
[53:55] opinions it's the the laying
[53:57] aside of
[53:59] ideas now you say preacher you're
[54:03] you're are you really saying these now
[54:06] listen my desire My Desire is a pure
[54:09] desire because what I want to see is the
[54:11] best for
[54:12] you now Jesus said in John
[54:15] 17 I
[54:17] pray this is Jesus's
[54:20] prayer that they may be one even as we
[54:23] are one Jesus prayed for Oneness so we
[54:26] are either in that prayer or fighting
[54:28] that
[54:29] prayer well Hallelujah I want to be in
[54:32] that
[54:33] prayer so my desire for Oneness and
[54:36] unity lays in the prayer of our Lord
[54:39] Jesus Christ it's not only my desire
[54:41] it's his desire so my desire was give to
[54:44] me from him and if you listen to Oneness
[54:47] of unity brother B preaches it twice and
[54:49] he says in both of them that the desire
[54:51] of oness come from God he said and watch
[54:54] he said watch The Devil copy God's
[54:56] Oneness he said he always does it he
[54:59] takes something that is powerful copies
[55:01] it and he said his Oneness is always a
[55:03] fake Oneness or you you remember he says
[55:06] watch how man brings Oneness but they
[55:08] bring it on a false Oneness and they
[55:10] bring a false unity and that usually
[55:13] when the false comes it comes then a
[55:15] force to enforce it right but God never
[55:20] forces Unity he gives the spirit of
[55:23] unity and then we release willfully
[55:26] anything that afflicts Unity let me say
[55:30] this amen it's amazing that God wants us
[55:33] to be one God wants us to be one now I
[55:35] know I don't have time to clarify all
[55:37] these areas but I'll say this he's not
[55:39] talking about denominational
[55:41] Oneness Unity some people want Unity
[55:44] here in the message are among all the
[55:45] churches and they said well we need
[55:47] Unity we need unity and here I'm
[55:48] standing there thinking we got
[55:50] Unity somebody said well we need Unity
[55:53] we need to get together does that mean
[55:55] Unity
[55:56] if we all sit down and agree with every
[55:58] verse and every scripture is that is
[56:00] that what unity means come on church
[56:03] amen but yet unity means a diversity of
[56:06] even thought or diversity of even
[56:08] feeling amen but what it means is that
[56:10] we have one goal and one purpose and we
[56:13] can be unified with people who are in
[56:15] Africa we never met because we're one
[56:18] body it's not just this assembly it's
[56:21] all of the body of Jesus Christ and
[56:23] we're baptized into those bodies amen
[56:26] now listen there's a diversity of ideas
[56:28] and feelings and and that's going to be
[56:29] even in your own home in your own church
[56:33] and and some of them opinions are see
[56:36] some of them come from God some come
[56:37] from the devil
[56:39] and you know it's just like the other
[56:41] day I said you know we all know Chevys
[56:43] are
[56:50] better sorry Aiden don't quit
[56:54] me horse boys just walk walked out the
[56:59] door but that's not affected our
[57:03] Oneness cuz it's a
[57:06] car do you see now because there's a
[57:11] thirst then there must be a fulfillment
[57:13] of thirst a thirst for Oneness is a true
[57:16] thirst but God has a way to do it and
[57:19] Paul desired this in the Philippian
[57:20] church he said in Philippians 2 that you
[57:23] may fulfill ye my joy that you be like
[57:25] my Ed having the same love being of one
[57:28] cord and one mind it was Paul's desire
[57:30] his joy in Ephesians 4 he says it let us
[57:34] endure to keep the unity of the spirit
[57:36] in the bond of Peace Amen in Colossians
[57:39] see Paul was traveling to different
[57:41] churches he didn't change his opinion
[57:43] from church to church he says this in
[57:45] Colossians in the colossian church Above
[57:47] All Things put on charity which is the
[57:49] bond of perfectness and let the peace of
[57:52] God rule in your hearts to which you're
[57:55] also called in one body to the
[57:58] Corinthian Church he said there should
[58:00] be no Schism in the body but the members
[58:03] should have the same care one for
[58:06] another now the word Schism here
[58:07] actually means
[58:09] division there should be no divisions
[58:11] right in First Corinthians Paul says it
[58:14] like this brethren in the name of the
[58:15] Lord Jesus Christ speak the same thing
[58:18] that there be no divisions among you
[58:21] somebody asked me the other day he said
[58:22] brother Wayne is it possible for all the
[58:23] message preachers to say the same thing
[58:25] I said if they all say say what brother
[58:26] Bram said it'll be
[58:29] easy somebody on a certain teaching they
[58:32] were talking to me and they said well
[58:33] certain certain certain Ser said this
[58:35] and he said that and he said that I said
[58:36] well what would you teach if you didn't
[58:38] know so and so he said well I guess I'd
[58:40] say what brother Bram said I said well
[58:41] then what's the
[58:45] problem see if if if another voice is
[58:48] added to it there's your division right
[58:51] so it's not the person staying with the
[58:54] message that's causing the division
[58:57] so as long as your heart is on the
[58:58] message you speak the same thing brother
[59:00] bandom said the prophet the spirit and
[59:02] the bride will say the same thing that
[59:05] will be a perfect union in that church
[59:07] amen that God would be able to put them
[59:10] together if there is anything
[59:11] contentious comes in now since we're
[59:13] teaching here in this little area let me
[59:15] just for a moment just touch this I'll
[59:17] probably not be on it for a while so
[59:19] might as well touch it while we're here
[59:20] if there would be something contentious
[59:22] that would come in brother Wayne how do
[59:24] we deal with it Mark 11:24 to 26 I say
[59:27] to you whatsoever things you desire When
[59:29] you pray believe that you receive them
[59:31] and you shall have them and when you
[59:33] stand praying
[59:36] forgive and if you have odd against any
[59:40] that your father also which is in heaven
[59:42] May forgive you your trespasses but if
[59:45] you do not
[59:46] forgive neither with your father which
[59:48] is in heaven forgive your trespasses now
[59:51] let's go to Matthew 18 I say unto you
[59:54] that if two shall agree on one thing
[59:56] on the earth as touching anything they
[59:58] shall ask it shall be done of them of
[1:00:00] the Father which is in heaven for where
[1:00:02] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:00:05] there I am in the midst of them then
[1:00:06] came Peter to them and said Lord how off
[1:00:09] if my brother should sin against me and
[1:00:11] I forgive him till seven
[1:00:14] times ah and Jesus said unto him I say
[1:00:18] unto thee until seven times but until 70
[1:00:22] times 7 490 times brother rap cook
[1:00:26] figured it up I think he said it was two
[1:00:28] minutes every two minutes you got to
[1:00:30] forgive
[1:00:33] somebody I preached that out brother Ron
[1:00:35] Spencer everybody running around after
[1:00:37] church and somebody said something they
[1:00:38] said you got two
[1:00:42] minutes so if you start saying something
[1:00:44] today at lunch somebody
[1:00:46] goes you know you're in
[1:00:51] trouble if you're about to leave stay
[1:00:53] two more minutes it'll
[1:00:54] help do you you see now Paul says that
[1:00:58] we ought to if possible everything that
[1:01:00] lies within us live peaceably with other
[1:01:03] men in Acts the 2 chapter they were all
[1:01:06] gathered in one room but they wasn't
[1:01:08] just in one room but the Bible said they
[1:01:10] were in one Accord they meant they
[1:01:13] wasn't just in the church they wasn't
[1:01:15] just in a home they wasn't just in a
[1:01:17] room they were in one mind and they were
[1:01:20] in one Accord you know what made them in
[1:01:22] that one mind Jesus said unto them in
[1:01:24] Luke 24:49 he said if you'll go ter in
[1:01:27] Jerusalem that you'll be endued with
[1:01:30] power from upon High I will send the
[1:01:32] promise of my father upon you when the
[1:01:35] promise of God was to be sent upon them
[1:01:38] Isaiah 28 the prophet of God said with
[1:01:40] stammer lips and other tongues will I
[1:01:42] speak unto these my people and this is
[1:01:44] the rest where with caus the weary to
[1:01:46] rest amen what was it Isaiah prophesied
[1:01:49] an outpouring of the spirit of God Jesus
[1:01:52] was telling them get in that room and
[1:01:54] I'm going to send the Holy Ghost in
[1:01:56] there he gave them 10 days to get it out
[1:01:58] of them he gave them 10 days to let it
[1:02:01] all get out of them they worked out
[1:02:03] every little issue and they worked out
[1:02:05] every disagreement with the promises of
[1:02:07] God and they got in that room and said
[1:02:09] we're going to receive the promise we're
[1:02:10] going to receive the promise we're going
[1:02:12] to receive the promise and they waited
[1:02:14] and they waited and they waited and they
[1:02:16] waited till eight days and somebody got
[1:02:18] up and said okay guys I think we got it
[1:02:20] we ought to just go home
[1:02:22] now brother B said no that wasn't the
[1:02:24] way it happened
[1:02:26] he said they waited till something
[1:02:27] happened he said and when something
[1:02:29] happened he said there was the rush of A
[1:02:31] Mighty Wind coming in that building and
[1:02:33] it filled their hearts where they were
[1:02:35] setting the Bible said that was clothing
[1:02:37] tongues of
[1:02:39] fire now Church think about this there
[1:02:42] were clothing tongues of fire that came
[1:02:45] and settled on 120 different people amen
[1:02:48] somebody said well preacher how we ever
[1:02:50] going to get the church in Oneness amen
[1:02:52] that's how they got in Oneness they got
[1:02:54] under a promise of God God and when they
[1:02:56] got in unity in that promise God sent
[1:02:58] the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God got
[1:03:01] in every one of them and made them of
[1:03:03] one body think about this the god of
[1:03:07] Heaven who was that Pillar of Fire tore
[1:03:10] himself apart that he might put his body
[1:03:15] together Jesus tore his body
[1:03:19] apart that he could put you together can
[1:03:22] you think of that this morning that God
[1:03:23] would tear himself apart so you could be
[1:03:25] one he would take him to Calvary and
[1:03:28] tear his body so you could be one I'll
[1:03:30] tell you this I believe God has got that
[1:03:32] kind of church this morning I believe he
[1:03:34] paid for that kind of church and he
[1:03:36] wants that kind of church and if I don't
[1:03:38] know about you but I want to give him
[1:03:39] that kind of church I believe there can
[1:03:41] be perfect unity in the house of God I
[1:03:44] believe there can be perfect unity in
[1:03:46] Brotherhood I think it's too bad we get
[1:03:49] away from it but I believe it's possible
[1:03:51] and I believe we have obtained it I say
[1:03:53] we ought to keep it I say we ought to
[1:03:55] not let it
[1:03:58] die brother B said that great spirit is
[1:04:00] on us don't let it die stay there stay
[1:04:03] on your days and night on your knees and
[1:04:05] keep the spirit of unity among you he
[1:04:08] says the ministry should unite the
[1:04:13] body you're not worried on me are you
[1:04:16] amen the ministry are to unite the body
[1:04:19] not
[1:04:21] denominations but you ought to unite
[1:04:23] brothers and sisters in purpose and in
[1:04:26] heart and in unity to see the coming of
[1:04:28] the Lord Jesus amen we ought to handle
[1:04:31] ourselves to maintain Unity now here's a
[1:04:34] beautiful thing brother brandom now I I
[1:04:36] don't know of a more spiritual man that
[1:04:38] lived in Our Generations there was
[1:04:40] nobody even in the same universe with
[1:04:42] William
[1:04:43] brandom in wisdom and Revelation in
[1:04:49] knowledge now now I'm not saying this
[1:04:52] because we have a church project it
[1:04:53] actually just the way brother B taught
[1:04:54] it but y'all know brother Bram had a
[1:04:56] church project in 1962 right and they
[1:05:00] Advanced the building do y'all know that
[1:05:02] brother Bram wasn't for it
[1:05:07] actually but he said I seen what the
[1:05:10] brothers wanted to
[1:05:11] do and he said we had a vote and he said
[1:05:15] that ought to be the motive of every
[1:05:16] Christian every person in the church is
[1:05:18] unify ourselves together and stick
[1:05:20] together look at this he say let's
[1:05:23] sacrifice our idea because that's the
[1:05:25] the only way to Stand United so brother
[1:05:28] brandham actually brother brandham
[1:05:31] actually voted that he didn't want the
[1:05:34] building but the rest of the church
[1:05:36] voted for it so he got behind
[1:05:40] it now now you're talking about a
[1:05:43] man you're talking about a man that was
[1:05:47] small because he could have just stood
[1:05:49] up and said look I'm a prophet and we
[1:05:50] ain't going to do
[1:05:53] this but he's saying the heart of the
[1:05:55] people
[1:05:56] people and he said you know what it's
[1:05:58] just my
[1:06:00] opinion so what he's doing he's showing
[1:06:03] you how that the appearing of the Lord
[1:06:06] would bring a Unity among the
[1:06:10] people brother Brandon was more
[1:06:12] spiritual than any of us guys and look
[1:06:15] what he done he brought
[1:06:19] Unity now you find out then the unity
[1:06:22] that the prophet teaches is to bring it
[1:06:25] he wanted to put us together and I'll
[1:06:27] say this do you know brother Bram said
[1:06:29] you're stronger together do you know the
[1:06:32] Bible said you're stronger together sir
[1:06:35] he and brother man said if you got a
[1:06:37] part of the Holy Ghost who got the Holy
[1:06:38] Ghost in here if you got a part of the
[1:06:40] Holy Ghost and I got a part of the Holy
[1:06:42] Ghost next man's got a part of the Holy
[1:06:43] Ghost put them together and is three
[1:06:45] times
[1:06:47] stronger than it was each one of you
[1:06:50] brother Bram says has a little fire in
[1:06:52] here and each one of you is a part of
[1:06:54] God and when you come together together
[1:06:56] it's the body of Christ
[1:07:00] uniting Hallelujah brother Bram says it
[1:07:03] like this we are not a divided people
[1:07:05] we've got to be in unity because each of
[1:07:07] us is holding a part of God we must come
[1:07:10] together the pillar of fire is
[1:07:11] manifested in its wholeness and its
[1:07:13] fullness and when his church sets
[1:07:15] together in Heavenly places then the
[1:07:17] fullness of the power of God in his
[1:07:19] church each one of us holding spiritual
[1:07:23] gifts and spiritual offices coming
[1:07:26] together brings the pillar of fire back
[1:07:30] again you see what it is here we are
[1:07:32] sitting here brother B said maybe 50 of
[1:07:35] us well we're probably what six times
[1:07:37] that 50 of us sitting here together we
[1:07:39] got 50 spoonfuls where there is Unity
[1:07:42] where there is a gathering there is
[1:07:44] safety just as twice as hard in a
[1:07:47] prophet's hands as the sticks to break
[1:07:48] than two sticks are to break them one
[1:07:51] brother B I'm actually demonstrating
[1:07:52] what is an example of and you can do
[1:07:54] this when you get home if you want to
[1:07:56] take one pencil and break it and take 10
[1:07:58] tape them together and then break
[1:08:00] that and you'll see that you're a lot
[1:08:02] weaker by
[1:08:03] yourself but when you put yourselves
[1:08:06] together the Bible says amen if one
[1:08:09] could chase a thousand then Pooh could
[1:08:12] put 10,000 to flight think about that if
[1:08:15] one could chase a th000 and two 10,000
[1:08:17] what about you this morning what what
[1:08:20] about you this morning as a Church of
[1:08:22] the Living God I'll tell you what
[1:08:24] brother Bram says he said two good
[1:08:26] members that's really on fire for God
[1:08:28] it'll do something for a church that 40
[1:08:31] revivals couldn't do you could have 40
[1:08:34] revivals but two of you on fire in unity
[1:08:37] this morning can do more for this
[1:08:39] assembly than 40 Revival meetings I'll
[1:08:42] tell you what I'm looking for is for two
[1:08:44] I'm just looking can I get two this
[1:08:46] morning well I got a lot more than two
[1:08:48] well I tell you this I believe the
[1:08:50] devil's in trouble
[1:08:52] then I believe we get two on fire and
[1:08:55] what about if we get 300 on fire and
[1:08:57] their hearts begin to join together I
[1:08:59] tell you what the devil's in trouble
[1:09:01] brother B said if you give me 500 people
[1:09:04] that was in the spirit of God and on
[1:09:06] fire I'll do more for the kingdom of God
[1:09:08] than they've done in 2,000 years can you
[1:09:11] imagine this morning this is uniting
[1:09:14] time the message of the hour was
[1:09:17] released for your Unity this has never
[1:09:20] been since the early church has the
[1:09:22] seals been released to unify the church
[1:09:25] church God tied the Mysteries together
[1:09:28] to tie the church together he tied the
[1:09:30] word together to tie the church together
[1:09:33] it is written in the scripture that
[1:09:34] there would be a gathering in the last
[1:09:36] day and they would be gathered unto him
[1:09:39] so when he appears in the church it
[1:09:41] brings a gathering of the Bride of Jesus
[1:09:44] Christ and looks now when he starts
[1:09:46] appearing people were in denominations
[1:09:49] and they were disunified but when God
[1:09:51] appeared they came out people were in
[1:09:53] their homes and they were in their is
[1:09:56] but when God appeared they came out he
[1:09:58] began to unify them by his
[1:10:01] presence oh I say this morning there is
[1:10:03] a trumpet calling the church together I
[1:10:06] say there's a seal that has opened up
[1:10:08] there is a word that has been released
[1:10:10] and it's calling the church out of every
[1:10:12] Walk of Life every opinion every
[1:10:15] situation every racial divide every
[1:10:17] social divide every emotional divide he
[1:10:20] man brother B said he's got them ducks
[1:10:22] and he said one Ducks was over here and
[1:10:24] another Ducks was over were here and
[1:10:25] they had a fence in between them and
[1:10:27] brother Greg brother said there were
[1:10:28] ducks on both sides of the fence he said
[1:10:31] and you could keep them in the fence he
[1:10:33] said Till the water gots AR Rising he
[1:10:35] said after a while the water got up high
[1:10:37] enough that it let the Ducks out of the
[1:10:39] fence and I say if you have fenced
[1:10:41] yourself off with the off fences of your
[1:10:44] life with struggles and trials and
[1:10:46] differences I say the Holy Ghost this
[1:10:48] morning pour out on the Church of the
[1:10:50] Living God to raise us in a place that
[1:10:53] we can remember we're all ducks we're
[1:10:55] all the children of God we all love God
[1:10:59] hallelujah I believe it this morning I
[1:11:01] believe the Holy Spirit pulls us
[1:11:03] together amen I believe this that we
[1:11:05] ought to know this morning where there
[1:11:07] is
[1:11:08] disunity the spirit of God is not
[1:11:12] welcome and I say he's welcome here this
[1:11:15] morning he's welcome in the Church of
[1:11:17] the Living God can our musicians come
[1:11:19] today I believe this I believe
[1:11:23] expectancy we'll bring together the
[1:11:27] church brother bam said it like this he
[1:11:30] said if they hadn't to separate the
[1:11:32] American Indians it could have never
[1:11:34] whipped
[1:11:37] them so the first thing first thing the
[1:11:40] devil
[1:11:41] does is separate
[1:11:43] divide before he
[1:11:45] conquers take take those take those 10
[1:11:48] pencils can you get a imagination with
[1:11:50] me take a ball of 10 pencils and line
[1:11:53] them up and just wrap tape around each
[1:11:55] side and try to break them you can't do
[1:11:57] it nor can you separate them because
[1:12:01] they're bonded together so the first
[1:12:04] thing you'd have to
[1:12:05] do is break the bond that holds it
[1:12:09] together and once you break that Bond
[1:12:13] scissors knife nail clippers really
[1:12:16] don't matter what you
[1:12:18] use but when you can
[1:12:21] individualize then you can
[1:12:23] break so you can see that Satan would
[1:12:26] like to break a bond of
[1:12:30] Peace so he can
[1:12:35] individualize I mean I mean we all live
[1:12:37] right we all got families and we got
[1:12:39] called to church and we all got issues
[1:12:41] anybody that ain't never been offended
[1:12:43] or troubled anything like that you go
[1:12:45] ahead and go because I ain't talking to
[1:12:48] you but anybody
[1:12:52] else have you ever notice when you get a
[1:12:55] offended your first
[1:12:58] thought is not hey I'm going to get
[1:13:00] closer to that
[1:13:02] person isn't that
[1:13:04] odd if you think somebody said something
[1:13:07] bad about you or they did something
[1:13:08] against you why isn't it your first
[1:13:11] thought I'm going to go give them a big
[1:13:13] hug and tell them how I love
[1:13:16] them it's actually opposite to
[1:13:19] that I don't know if I'll talk to them
[1:13:21] again
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:27] because it's the
[1:13:28] enemy that
[1:13:31] divides but when you get to praying you
[1:13:34] ever notice this when you when you get
[1:13:35] to
[1:13:37] praying it makes you love people more
[1:13:40] and you ever notice this when you get in
[1:13:42] a forgiven Spirit you forgive
[1:13:44] everybody when somebody's really serious
[1:13:47] about forgiveness when they really get
[1:13:48] to that place they want they want when
[1:13:51] they really want people to forgive them
[1:13:53] and they want to get right with the Lord
[1:13:55] and they want to get right with people
[1:13:58] did you ever notice they're not specific
[1:14:00] on like they don't just pick one person
[1:14:03] let's just say maybe they're upset with
[1:14:05] you brother John and they're upset with
[1:14:06] 10 other people too but they won't just
[1:14:09] come to
[1:14:11] you they'll want to get it right with
[1:14:16] everybody
[1:14:17] sure but watch politics if somebody
[1:14:21] needs to correct something
[1:14:22] politically they'll pick the political
[1:14:25] Choice make it right there and not make
[1:14:28] it right everywhere
[1:14:31] else but when someone really wants to
[1:14:33] make things right and get it right in
[1:14:35] their heart they just want everybody to
[1:14:37] love them they want to make it right
[1:14:38] with everybody they'll just stand in the
[1:14:41] middle go among people and say hey if
[1:14:43] I've ever done anything if I ever said
[1:14:44] anything you watch somebody new
[1:14:46] Christian It's the funniest thing their
[1:14:47] conscience is so it's so
[1:14:50] open and they'll they they'll stop him
[1:14:52] and they'll say but way if you know of
[1:14:54] anything I've done done or anything I
[1:14:56] said I'd like to get it I'd like to just
[1:14:59] get it
[1:15:02] right and I tell you this morning God
[1:15:05] God is still moving isn't he amen I know
[1:15:08] I've been in the Ephesians book a while
[1:15:10] we we're going to be in a couple more
[1:15:11] chapters and then we'll be out of
[1:15:15] it but this morning as we walk in the
[1:15:18] calling we're called Christian kingdom
[1:15:20] there's one law but love all loneliness
[1:15:23] and humbleness of mind
[1:15:25] we should be
[1:15:27] longsuffering endeavoring
[1:15:29] striving to
[1:15:31] keep what we
[1:15:33] have I want to keep it I want to keep
[1:15:37] the
[1:15:39] unity if you want to keep something
[1:15:42] sometimes it cost you something so if
[1:15:44] there's a little something in your heart
[1:15:45] this morning something you would like to
[1:15:47] say brother Wayne before
[1:15:49] God I want to keep my
[1:15:52] Unity maybe in your home
[1:15:55] maybe in your little family your little
[1:15:57] family there's a there's an
[1:15:59] upheaval and you're sitting there
[1:16:01] thinking how how we ever going to fix
[1:16:03] this let me tell you there's a
[1:16:06] God who divided the Red Sea and put it
[1:16:09] back together
[1:16:11] again there's a God that put healing in
[1:16:13] your body I was just thinking about this
[1:16:15] this morning brother I just down
[1:16:16] preached for Matt Morrison I remember
[1:16:18] when he was a little boy he was playing
[1:16:20] and McDonald's fell down and he broke
[1:16:23] his wrist
[1:16:25] it it was broke broke and he come in
[1:16:27] there and that thing was they there was
[1:16:29] a whole group standing around there and
[1:16:31] he was crying with that broke wrist and
[1:16:32] he come up there in McDonald's and his
[1:16:35] mom and several of the sisters were
[1:16:37] standing there and they just wished over
[1:16:39] and laid hands on him and they started
[1:16:42] praying and when they started praying
[1:16:43] there was a pop and that that hand just
[1:16:46] straightened out and it healed
[1:16:49] instantly and one of them just out of
[1:16:51] their breath said it's the third pull
[1:16:56] now something can be so severely broken
[1:16:58] and everything everything in your
[1:17:00] knowledge tells you that takes 60 days
[1:17:03] to
[1:17:05] heal you might have to go to surgery and
[1:17:08] sometimes you have to and you might have
[1:17:10] to have a pen in it and then it'll hold
[1:17:12] it together wide heels and you'll have
[1:17:14] to carry it for months but there's
[1:17:17] moments under the power of the spirit
[1:17:19] that he can heal something in a
[1:17:22] second there was another little boy Kyle
[1:17:25] down there in in Arkansas my wife was
[1:17:27] standing there when it happened they was
[1:17:28] playing after a a a fellowship and
[1:17:30] there's dinner and kind of like out here
[1:17:32] and some of the kids running around
[1:17:33] little boy fell and he broke the top
[1:17:35] part of his arm there were two there
[1:17:37] were two fire uh firemen standing there
[1:17:40] and they were building a splint for it
[1:17:43] Chris is sitting right there they were
[1:17:44] building a splint for it and the little
[1:17:46] boy he started crying and he looked up
[1:17:48] his daddy's the first uh responder in
[1:17:50] the fireman he looked up his daddy he
[1:17:52] said Daddy he said can't we at least
[1:17:54] pray
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:17:57] his daddy just said he told me brother
[1:17:59] Morgan he told me he said he said I
[1:18:01] didn't have any faith and it was going
[1:18:03] to change he said but he asked me and I
[1:18:04] felt

[1:18:30] spirit in this building and things that
[1:18:33] you say they're so broken brother Wayne
[1:18:35] they can't be put back together I say

[1:19:02] showed up and went off and brother Bisal
[1:19:04] said he he told me this personally
[1:19:06] sitting on the couch he said brother
