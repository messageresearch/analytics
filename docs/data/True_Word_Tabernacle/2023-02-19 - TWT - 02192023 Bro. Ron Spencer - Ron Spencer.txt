Lord I believe that all things [Music] power hits to him now father in an atmosphere like this anything can happen you're very much a god of at your specialty of impossibilities Lord we bring our seemingly impossibilities before you now we spoke of Jarius last night and then that realm it didn't even move you the most haunting enemy had struck that home and you were greater than that enemy you're greater than every enemy that would come to try to baffle your children now Lord Jesus we ask you to come and take full control of this service [Music] if we could borrow the words of our prophet he said if you could give us a temporary Resurrection the greatest gift that any of us as ministers have is to get ourselves out of the way so if you could take that self today and let it blow up in a balloon take your Holy Ghost pen and bust it now Lord we come and surrender ourselves to you Lord bless this audience bless this church I ask you now that you do a supernatural work here this morning touch us we pray we're just your servants reporting for Duty and if there's anything special about us it's you I think we could all say that 100 percent now we give ourselves to you we place our needs on your altar bless his church we pray in Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you amen good to be with you on a Sunday morning it is the Lord's Day but as a matter of fact every day is the Lord's Day man we bring you greetings from home too many people want to say hello especially Andrew and his wife sister Katie I have my granddaughter here this morning and she's here to fulfill a birthday desire and so yeah happy birthday to you amen you guys have stole our hearts here that we've been old friends a long time and so back in the 90s we started this journey together and and we become friends one day we'll spend eternity together amen maybe you could be seated just a moment before we go too far I would like to thank you for having me and being my friend for all these years and thank you for all the prayers that you have prayed for me and God doesn't unsee any of those things and and that's what's the difference is amen it'd be good to us amen I so love you and uh so so thank you for what you mean to the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world I just have a couple of opening comments this morning to to see the transition that you're involved in here and we realize that this old man's church this is God's church but sometimes we just need to stop and think thank God for what he has done you remember there was men that came back to Jesus to thank him and it's very important to stop and thank him for what he has done and no man with his own energies will produce anything if you do it with your own energies you'll only make a mistake and so we are very aware of those things if if we can just just move ourselves out of the way I've been friends with Brother Ray Erickson for way too many years the first time I saw Brother Ray I was speaking at the Tabernacle in over over the way where brother Jonathan's at and I had been invited I think there was about 40 people there and I preached a sermon called the autopsy of the Dead Church no don't get scared I'm not going to preach it today and I remembered as a man sat on the aisle and he had his foot about halfway out in the aisle he had dark hair presence of God just emulated out of him brother Tom Brown came to the Altar and just just bellowed and we prayed together for quite a while and I walked into the pastor studied and he and brother Isaiah Brooks said do you know who you prayed for at the altar and I said no this is my first time here I don't know anybody he said that's Tom Brown I said well and we became great friends but I said I want to know who the guy is that had his foot out in the aisle I like that guy he said that's Ray Erickson Ray asked me to come the first time and I was busy I couldn't come I told him no he asked me again a bit later and I told him no you know three times his charms and so I've been coming now way too many years and so amen I found Brother Ray to be a real man of God Ray is a legend in his own time he's a Powerhouse he operates with such power and such humility at the same time it's just just incredible he he's a visionary you guys came from Astoria to the church Downtown to where he was and I preached that so many and then and then here you are and his vision has not diminished you're about to build a new church I hope I'm not giving you news foreign you won't do it as one man you'll do it as a team and he'd been a phenomenal Minister for many to see how it's to be done well so a lot of people do it and they do it but he's done it well the atmosphere in this church is kind of like my home Church I like that you're easy people to preach to you come hungry you come ready you're a team here you're not pulling against one another throwing rocks at one another you're a team you just find your place in the body we don't need Stars we just need we just need family brother Ray's family is a is an example of how it is how it's to be done if you would want a picture of the message of the hour and what family is you do not need a six-week course on how to raise a family this message tells you everything that you need and if you want pictures of how it is race family does that and so I've watched them as they grow and we're getting gray hair now grandchildren are coming and a lot of them and we can see that this message wasn't just a Revival to Brother Ray and his wife but it became to his children and then the flame went to his children's children Will Go On because it's God's work Brother Ray thank you I'm not done Brother Ray one of the qualities of Brother Ray is he wasn't a kingdom Builder and I just I'm not here to fix 30 years but he should have been the pastor of this area a long time ago but when politics gets into anything politics whether they're in Washington or in a church is that the devil if you need that said again I can do that for you and brother Ray didn't let politics rule his gift as a matter of fact it only magnified through the years it wasn't about how many people was in the crowd it just continued to work when I first came here brother Ray was working and he kept working and he kept working and then he became a full-time Pastor here which he was before but he had two jobs three jobs and it was a job to raise Ben brother a can look at his family and see them take leadership in the in this church he can be proud that it lives he wasn't a kingdom Builder but even great Kings as they see themselves age they want to see their work go on I would say there's a lot of churches around the message very jealous of what has just happened here because you just didn't get anybody to to be their pastor you got one of the greatest preachers on the Earth haven't got my offering yet so all these years he's been right here with you working as a team member and I don't know if you you do any study in history but this guy reminds me he's a country boy but he reminds me of a man named Feeney Finney was a liar Finney had the Holy Ghost and Finney would preach and five miles down the road they would drop their lunch boxes and give their heart to Jesus Christ I knew brother Wayne as a as a young man as he began to preach he's not just one of the boys I don't think that we lift each other up or try to lift each other up it's God that places the gift he didn't go to school he was just a kid on the river doing fishing he never asked for any of these accolades or anything all he wanted to do was serve the Lord I thought it was a tremendous thing for him to come and work with Brother Ray these years I've applauded it I've shouted it to the moon and and back and to the Stars again because Brother Ray had qualities that he would need in his leadership skills now brother Ray's loved this church and he loved his work and he loves you as people he's not finished it's kind of like a an old fire horse you know it used to be they they dropped the water wagons with a with horses you know that hook she was young one day and he could run probably faster than them all and he was hooked to other horses sometimes four six eight horses and they ran with all of their plight and that lead horses not very kind of knew where the fire was yeah had a sense inside of me but there come a day that his steps were a little slower didn't mean he wasn't still a great horse but his steps were slower he couldn't get to the fire in time so what they did was they just simply put him in the in the barn you know that old Bell would ring and he'd come out of that Barn charging and he ran all the way down about a mile with those horses just running with everything that was within him and he come to the fence and they would go on now whether you knew it or not he was thanking God for the fence now family I want to just tell you you're going to watch your pastor be more relaxed than ever before you're going to see him enjoy services like never before and when he preached he's charged his wagon he's been ready for for a month and now all of a sudden he gets to he gets to preach and he preaches and then he goes thank God for the fence and then he hears a little problem in the church and he said Wayne this is your baby I know but what you don't understand is God's did it all and so I would like to stop and congratulate you I'm probably not like anybody else that you'll have in but I can't say hello in five minutes so but I'd like to congratulate you as an audience for your prayer and there'll be some transition that'll seem kind of bumpy on the way don't you worry you'll get to the pavement soon enough and what God's going to need not just from you and brother Reagan from Wayne brother Wayne he's going to need you to stay a team need you to stay a body because brother Wayne didn't go to a school somewhere could be a pastor he's going to learn from that guy sitting in the back with a cough so brother Wayne brother Ray's not mad at me and moved to the back he told me he said I got a call so be careful when you shake his hand I want to say I love you brother Wayne's Ministry is going to change he's been an evangelist he could take that sermon that was so inspired and preached a hundred times and make it feel as fresh as it's ever been but now he's going to be a pastor and so as a pastor he's going to be with you you know as an evangelist you hit and run you're hit and run you're Hit and Run some of you know you got some you don't know you got but now as a pastor he's going to be with you for the Long Haul and he's going to watch you mature and the difference with the pastor he has to be patient with you he has to watch you grow from a baby change her diapers then after a while you'll learn to eat on your own you'll throw food on the floor but he can't throw you out in the road because now he's your pastor and he's going to watch you make mistakes and he knows I can't micromanage them and be there to hold their hand all the time but but I'm here for you and he's going to watch you grow and and one day we'll all be in heaven and we'll thank Brother Ray and brother Wayne and this team sitting here Brother Ray can look at this group of young men and his grandsons boy what a job they did at brother Tim pritz the other day this church was showcased by these boys preaching and that big tall guy right there well they're all tall to me yeah but that big tall guy on Sunday morning he just he just blew the place up and and you started it out on Friday night and you didn't act a bit nervous as a matter of fact it was so great until you came to my church a few weeks ago and well that boy don't he looks like he's been preaching for a long time Brother Ray if you want to set your ministry at work there it is I'd like to say thank you thank you thank you I hope that wasn't too much if it was only one of me nobody's going to copy me or impersonate me they might do that to other preachers but they won't do me so amen you know the thing about being short is you come along to kind of put your shoulder to the wheel and to be a help to guys like this well I want you to understand about guys that like us being short the tall guys carry the big log and so a short guys come along and put our shoulder up like we're carrying it so that's what I'm doing this I'm kind of putting my shoulder up there I love you I hope that was okay for you amen I love you oh you guys can take dinner and get messed up so amen tell Connie she'll pay more attention so glad to have my with white with me and very well Happy Valentine's Day again if you didn't get to get your wife roses you know go ahead and get that taken care of and if you get her a box of chocolates remember what brother Brown said about this wipes and I think she's got a demon he said well get a box of chocolate so sisters if your husband comes in with roses and a box of chocolate remember the quote your husband thinks you got a demon [Applause] [Laughter] how many men's guilty thank you me and you're not the only ones in the building sister Connie I really don't think you have a demon I love you with all my heart I love you I love you when we're there I hope you shake my hand and amen amen we made it we're gonna make it we're gonna make it we're gonna make it amen amen Matthew Chapter 13 if you will stand with me this morning hope you haven't started your clock yet because I haven't started mine they're mine Matthew Chapter 13 and we read the whole scripture last last night but we'll read a portion and the same day went Jesus out of the house and set by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying behold A sower went forth to sow let's go down to the end of where we read last night and the disciples came and said unto him why speaketh thou unto them in parables and he answered and said to them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be shall be taken away even that that he has therefore speak I to them in Parables because seeing because sins because they see and see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and see and you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have closed less than any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I shall heal them I think that such a powerful statement and I shall hear heal them now he says it like this blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verbally I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and they hear those things which you hear have not hurt them yet you can be seated what a time we live in you're the ending of all ages God has watched over your seed since the foundation of the world that which was potential now is reality what was in God's Vision now lives thoughts are now expressed the mess delivered and it has the capacity to change your body not just cause you to live right but that's that's just part of this but it's it has the capacity the potential in it for a people is going to take the rapture your identification is rapture your identification is reflection and if we go by the way of the Grave God made us a promise that we're going to raise up on that Resurrection morning it's not a promise by a preacher it is a promise of God and the seed the seed is not destroyed when your body wears out and it longer no longer can sustain life right right yeah it may go back to the gases and the ashes but God makes a promise that on Resurrection morning he'll raise that body back up [Applause] at that point you'll never know what time is ever like or tall is ever like or death is ever like because God has designed you as an eternal being we didn't come here to build a church a bride around the world we're linked as a family you can be with somebody from South Africa just meet them and all of a sudden you realize you've been family all along and the Really the realization is you stepped out of Eternity into a space of time just like your marriage you you joined maybe maybe you meet that certain one for a certain time and and you just know she's special and you marry and you enjoy life and and energy to enjoy life you begin to raise children together if you're fortunate enough and you watch them and you watch them grow and almost overnight you're gray-headed where did time go right you know for a real marriage you're not fighting and fussing and fuming and those things don't happen in your home as real believers mom you realize there's another Power trying to disturb your day and you just say I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let you control this day God make a way and you you lay your ego down at the door kind of like a church and lay your ego down at the door you're selfishness down at the door now you're married and to become one and you enjoy marriage this ain't a marriage seminar but it is when you get the Holy Ghost your prayers are different you're eating at the table is different enjoying one another is different sure I came across a spot here a bump in the road and but I enjoy my wife more now than ever sure there's difficult days and sure there's days yourself out of the Lazy Boy seems like you want your feet to move but they just won't move you want things to happen but your body just won't make it happen but there's another round Glory can you come on Amen brother Brandon would say it like this give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a house way that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factor worker that'll put God first there's the real key when you lose your focus remember what your number one priority is it's God it's God it's not politics it's not it's not uh trying to build yourself up because we're nobody and if you want to figure out how important you are brother may I say I'm not going to do it put your finger down in a bucket of water and pull it out find a hole the important thing about you is him that'll put God first in everything I'll show you Amanda to be successful in spite of all what a statement this all that the devil can put on him he seeks God first he says we're flesh of his flesh we're bone of this bone God raised up his bone and flesh out of the grave and they cannot hide the the man that has the potentials death cannot take him Jesus said all that the father has given me will come and I'll raise him up at the last day oh my Easter while we're righted in eastern when he's raised and will and we raise with him he sent back the abstract we hold it as the baptism of the Holy Ghost what powerful statement he's about to say He Is Alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever I can imagine as Paul is beginning to describe as we're speaking today and I maybe didn't give you for those that wasn't here last night he sent his seeds into the Earth and though might be thousands of years now you have arrived now it's your turn it's your turn to run Paul would be given the responsibility to in Hebrews chapter 11. to just catch it a name to catch a name that had significant Eternal purpose in the mind of God and in their space of time they took the Earth I can't imagine what the responsibility would be like in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 32 I just read your portion here he said what shall we then shall we say hi more for the time would fail me to tell you of Gideon and Barack and of Samson of Jeff and I of David and of Samuel and of the prophets that's a mouthful you're talking about a dream team from heaven all in the same sentence who through faith submute kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises strap the mouths of the Lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weaknesses were made strong what's grounded in Fight to turn the flight to the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had a trial of cruel mockings and scourgeons moreover bonds and imprisonment listen you could take just a portion of a sentence and preach for months they were stoned they were song asunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins been destitute and afflicted when I read that about being strong everybody knows the name John Wesley he was five foot one and redheaded I like it he would put me put out of a lot of churches today because he was so emotional and he preached and then his inspiration of preaching one time he was in a field because the church a churches wouldn't hold his crowd and a hailstorm came and they just stood there ten thousand people stood there while he preached one day he was preaching and the whole crowd got slain in the spirit and he thought what he said was so important he went out and tried to set him up and said listen but they were so drunk in the spirit these men were powerful men these men were men that God slowly seed into the Earth God knew that he was sending them into the Earth and he was anointing them with purpose but it wasn't an easy Road they hated him so much till they stoned him over and over again stalled him I just read about in the Old Testament how they stoned him and here we've got a church age messenger right right right they're stoning brother Branham now they'll pay for that every Rock they throw they'll pay for that but let me just say this to you as they stoned John Wesley he didn't quit I read his diary over and over again he would it was very it was a very intellectual man and being his extreme intellect he would write so dry in his literature he said today I was stoned and I waited till the last one left and it climbed out from under the stack of stones and guy went home preparing to preach tomorrow how many times did it happen five times I found it five times you'd mostly quit Church I hoped you wouldn't these were men with passion he had a message to preach and he preaching his message it cost him a lot no church welcomed it nobody welcomed him he would build churches later and it would become the Methodist movement it was a new method of preaching not a Pulpit but he would stand in the in the streets on a basket and preach because nobody wanted him but that didn't stop the message no Paul would say it like this of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all haven't obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided a better thing for us that they with us should not be made perfect there is a people in another Realm counting on you how many brother random calls you the final voice to the final age it goes all the way back in the mind of God in the last book in Revelations chapter 5 we were standing there screaming Hallelujah and worshiping Our Redeemer we're all at them to fight with him and then he would begin to write wherefore seeing we're also compassionate about with all of this group so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin was just so easily beside us and let it run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author the finisher of our faith who for the joy and be sat before him and doing the cross despising the shame and it sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God what a statement brother Branham was standing and God would use a man to to speak in tongues and then speak God was speaking to him and God spoke to him these words because thou has chosen The Narrow Path the harder way that thou has walked in your truth your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven will await them what a glorious decision that thou has made this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass that tremendous victory in the left divine I would like to say this is more than just a wig in Branham this is for every one of you you had to make a choice and at many times it was a difficult choice it was a narrow path but what a reward what a phenomenal reward that we have brother Graham says the devil is always trying to point you to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that is genuine I'm real careful who I point my children to Heroes Hollywood and all of these stars are not Heroes politics and all their Stars they're not Heroes this Sports World in all of their scars it's not Heroes look around the building [Applause] these are real people that are heroes and he gives it a theme a devil is almost harmless unless he can have something to work in you remember those Devils that were cast out of a legion that they had he said they wanted to do more mischievousness they wanted to go into the halts so Devils must have something to work with and I said it that realm and the negative realm if the devil wants somebody to work with how much God needs you I want to remind you for with God not this is possible so regardless of how many blockades that you have to go through and walls that seem so tall to climb God is great at impossibilities ye are of God we quoted it last night I came from God and I'm going back to God that was our origin we're here and we're going back to him year of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you know there's certain names sometimes God sees has a name and it becomes your name and you realize that you came from God and you're going to go back do you realize that your name actually shakes hell you may be nobody here but in hell you have become extra Tormentor hell is always wanting a News Bulletin on what you're up to today and what you don't realize is you as your prayer life you are praying for an atmosphere around your home you don't need a hundred people standing guard in another dimension there are angels that's watching over your house Psalms 91 has been dispatched to take care of you angels are in charge to take care of you to watch your children going to school if you're going to look back God has prepared you oh my brother Ron God save me from this what you don't understand that's only half the story what God has kept you from if you could have only seen the enemy trying to destroy your life a spirit trying to creep into your home an attitude trying to change you and God rich in Mercy by the gift of the Holy Ghost wash that thing out like an Artesian well he just washed that thing out that's why the need of the Holy Ghost is more important today than ever before because Satan is on the attack he's trying to get in your mind and so God rich in Mercy fills you with the Holy Ghost and every time a little trash goes in watch Holy Ghost water pushes it right back up [Applause] God has a law of reproduction in his seat they have all the potentials of God not just a portion God poured all of himself inside of you you're an amateur God on the earth you've heard these things but the devil would whisper in your ear trying to get you to believe another report but whose report will We Believe you're God's masterpiece the scripture says in these signs shall follow them that believe in my name he has given you a checkbook with authority to sign the check my wife that's here our bank would not recognize my name if I would sign a check they would go there's some forgery going on here because since we've been married she signed my checks foreign I don't have a clue this might be foreign to a lot of people I don't have a clue to how much money is in my own bank I'm not worried and that right Connie once in a while I'll just look at her and say we okay because when I said I do everything that I own is hers and everything she owns is hers [Applause] but we have an identification to another kingdom amen and so we as his wife sang the church sometimes we back God for things when we have the authority to just write a check you know Connie when she goes to the store she don't call me said is it okay I hope I don't hurt nobody's feelings here on is it okay is it okay is it okay it's okay I'm busy here you just do what you got to do sometimes Brother Ray we just delegate my cancer doctors told me said you learned to delegate you don't have to shake 300 people's hands get the deacons to do that they do a great job I just tell everybody I love them I haven't changed my mind there are days but you're the wife of God I don't know how many quotes you've got to hear but you're God's wife I hope you get it you're his wife you're his you are the Christ Living in bright form on the Earth why shouldn't we overcome you have all of his potentials you don't have to beg you're not a slave no more it's live Just Breathe quit beating yourself just breathe here we go there was a time you had to remind yourself you were married I'm married I'm married I'm married I'm married I'm married but after it becomes a reality you don't have to worry about that no more you're married [Applause] and sometimes when you came to church you were I married to him I'm married to him I'm married to him but one day it wakes up inside of you that means why I'm him in bright form I have all of his potentials he put it in me [Applause] I was a group of men that signed the Magna Carta for our independence as America and their names they were powerful people some of them will have his hat on the great plantations they were some of them rich some of them were just common workers Liars but we declared that we were independent from foreign rules we forgot it but these people signed that Magna Carta the Declaration of Independence and they signed it they sealed their life with their signature we're free we're not going to live as slaves no more what you don't realize that once they signed it and became a part of it now every enemy turned on them their plantations was destroyed most of their families was destroyed mom as a matter of fact one man the enemy had infotril infiltrated his family and his home and he told George Washington if the enemy's going to live in my home blow it up blow it up I say this we have signed our life to this message [Applause] we have given our whole identification to this message we are not the old man no more we're a new preacher in Christ Jesus we read our name in that book I said this wasn't for everybody but was for me and I recognize I'm as Eternal as Jesus Christ is eternal I don't have to make myself do anything his life is living on the inside of me Shakespeare Beethoven diligent but if the spirit of Christ lives inside of you you'll do the works of Jesus Christ it was a man he signed his names and he signed it larger than anybody else his name is called John Hancock later they would ask him why did you sign your name so large he said when the king reads it I want him to see my name without his glasses let me sign this message tell every devil in hell knows your name and at Large don't be a coward don't be a whiny box sign your name so large collaborate devil in hell knows who you are I'm not worried about bullets in my back the Armor's on the front and we are charging like never before [Applause] huh the scripture says that Jesus said unto them no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of heaven I want to say this to you and you've heard me say it before never give up young people all across this building I want you to say it with me never never give up whatever the reason is too much pressure exhausted frustrated lack of commitment the spirit to flee run from responsibility refusing to train the thoughts of escaping it all let me just tell you something about escaping it all we live in a world that you want to go to the back side of the mountains and then when you get there 52 000 other people are there and all the things all of a sudden you find yourself in that isolation with 52 people in front of you at Starbucks and what you was escaping you have just found again but this world it's not our home this world is no place to relax brother Ron I'm wiped out good because that means if you're fighting Satan's trying to get you right brother on the things that I've been through I could write a book about my horrors of life well that's just stuff come on I got on a plane after a meeting about 20 years ago I got about halfway and I was called to the next layover and they told me we have we've canceled your flight and I said I I really want to go home I looked across at the younger lady at the counter and I said I really I'm wore out I preached a meeting and I really I really need to go home and then I blame my wife I said my wife needs me they put me on a complete different Airline I got I got in that place and put me beside of a window and a big guy sat down beside him he was a rattle boss and he told me about how important he was and what his job he had and talked about his boss that sit behind beside him all the time he talked about how great he was and you know he just kept going and kept going and we were about to land and he finally said what do you do I didn't have a lot of time to just waste with him and I said well I'm a preacher and I preached the message of William Mary and Brenner and the guy that had been silent was sitting at the aisle all of a sudden he perks up he said I grew up in the message and he started talking about the Miracles that he knew and as we land he's telling me I grew up and he said I got away in my my my family is demolished and my life is demolished and I I own an insurance company and I I have all of this but I don't have God I told that story for about 20 years looking for that man in the meetings families moved from North Carolina to our church and a brother comes and he comes to the church and he's there a couple of times and and uh we're going to have a little pizza get together and so uh I don't I don't know him he don't know me and we're just talking as we're going into the into the fellowship hall and and he would sit down beside of me and he began to talk and others would begin to talk I think we had about 12 at the table at that time and the Lord Whispers in my ear the man that was on the plane is setting beside him and in the other ear what if you're wrong and I looked at him and I I just kind of set back 20 years I've been looking for him 20 years of Devastation in his life 20 years of a lot of turmoil and God hasn't forgot him he'd write books about his turmoil of his life actually write books about his turmoil in his life and I said we've met before he said no we've never met before I said yeah yeah we've met before he said how you know that I said a little voice just spoke in my ear that I met you on an airplane and I've been looking for you for 20 years and so I told him the story that I just told you and he put his hands over his face and he said my God God never gave up on me let me just say this to you and your children [Music] that seems so impossible God does not give up on his kids [Applause] he made a promise I'll not lose one of them not one of them [Applause] for him insane like this you may be going through hell but God will watch over you his grace and his love he's rich in Mercy his Redemption is as strong today as it's ever been his power to forgive when he forgives the most wretched sinner in the world it doesn't diminish his power whatsoever because that which he deposited is him himself and you may be in a pawn shop and feel like nobody will ever look at you but God's headed your way [Applause] thank you Lord when I called you out last night as a doctor don't you never let nobody make fun of you amen God called you to be where you're at and don't you be intimidated by people's spirits because God placed you there you didn't put yourself there God blessed you there thank you Lord is that all right for me to go on foreign God sends his seeds into the Earth he sends them on a mission your mission was to be more than a mailman people didn't know that God had an angel stepping on their soul and your prayers in the morning protected their homes as you visited you being in a certain School you may be the only believer but God blesses that school because you're there you working on a certain job God blesses that job because you're there you walk into an empty restaurant and all of a sudden it begins to fill up because you're there it's blessings that's been commanded over top of your life there's blessings have been commanded over top of your life don't you take some servants don't become a beggar you're God's child and he's commanded blessings to be on you how bless you coming in and I'll bless you going out don't you ever take a slave in talented we're not slaves we're children of God we're amateur Gods on the young this ain't no pep talk this is what God has given to you this isn't what I promised you this is what God said I'll bless you with amen thank you Lord you walked up brother Aegis your life was devastated I don't know the whole story but it was in prayer you had a back condition and while we prayed I've never ever did it since while we pray God spoke in my ear and said ask him what his hobby is we stopped he was a guy he looked kind of shocked when I stopped and asked him Greenhouse well let's pray that God blesses the greenhouse what about you don't get jealous of what God did don't get jealous of brother Wayne don't get jealous of these boys oh they're just preachers because they're Granddad they ran from that these guys didn't want to do the job because they saw the turmoil that he had to go through the fights but now it's their turn long live the king so you can enjoy the labors as these guys work it's enjoying this Sister Mary brother Darren I know you've got a wonderful family I know you got but you didn't put that gift in that boy he was probably a stinker growing up most preachers are stinkers growing up but God rich in Mercy I think about the the things that God has did allowed me to be a part of his life his wife's life when Satan tried it I don't I can't find her but when Satan tried to destroy her and take her life yeah yeah come on is it okay for me to do a little talk here by the way and you brought her to my house you told her you'd take her any place in the earth anywhere she made a choice to come to my house you go girl when you call me I begin to pray this is life or death I forget we met we talked she wasn't even the same person Satan made into time we went into the house we said in what we call a great room it's tall and we begin to pray and a demon spoke out of her he said I'm not coming out and we rebuke that demon spirit of God hit brother Wayne he rolled all over the floor he rolled all over my office spoke in tongues you don't believe in that you need a birth and I I asked her ever after everything settled down I said would you like to see my puppy because I needed her to relax Brother Ray I'm sorry if I'm telling something that's too too I needed her to relax to where I could catch her spirit of what caused it and I had a dog it was an Australian Shepherd his granddaddy won the New York State show she was beautiful cancer took a life what a devil picked on my dog cancer took her life her name was Belle we called her Bell after Beauty and the Beast I don't like Disney brother Ron shame on you and Belle came out and jumped up in her lap and he she just loved her she started rubbing all over bail and bail could make you feel like you were the most important person in the world brother Wayne was on the golf cart sitting behind she was sitting beside of me we hadn't went a hundred yards and the Lord told her exactly what was going on her daddy didn't even know God cared amen because you were going to be a preacher's wife had you been born a male you would have preached sermons but we don't believe in transgender so you get to sing songs and songs in your songs you create an atmosphere to where Devil's run God allowed you to go through that trial that while you could sing songs even in the depth of that Psalm you could reach down where nobody else can reach because the seed that got deposited on the inside of you is not for 10 or 20 years it's for eternity he sent that seed into the Earth [Applause] and you needed a wife that had been through all of that because she would know how to pray for your ministry when you feel so intimidated I'm just a young guy I'm Just a Nobody I I don't even hardly know what to say and then you stand to your feet and preach a masterpiece because of the sea he sent his seed into the Earth buddy Robinson he sent his seed into the Earth and he would trap millions of miles Charles City would stand intimidated but he would preach and he would preach convictions so strong until the entire police department didn't have nothing to do and they became the original barbershop quartet oh because God sent his seed child spiritual shook London and Europe and he would write our president of the United States a letter declare slavery free and our president Tom with a beard went to Gettysburg and a man spoke in front of him two hours nobody remembers what he spoke hardly anybody knows his name but a man named Abraham Lincoln because God sent his sin he knew we were coming God was going to have a messenger born in this land in the same state as that president was glory and he needed him to be free to preach this message he needed to be so so bound to the word and so entrusted he would only say God's word and on his way he writes his speech the Gettysburg Address how did the history but there was a preacher behind him in London named Charles Spurgeon my body says I need to quit my spirit says I got to finish this you can help me brother Brennan was under a tree he was a bootleggers child he's carrying water water to make moonshine they were running from the law most Moonshiners didn't drink their own whiskey because it meant money how do you know that I came from Moonshiner families her grandfather was a Moonshiner my great-grandfather was a Moonshiner it was money now they put up making beer all over the world nobody says nothing it's glorifying but in that day it was against the law and brother Brandon was currying water God didn't care where he was carrying water to me all but brother Ron I've been through such stuff really God's not ashamed of where you had to come from he's not so ashamed brother Ronald probably never fit it in church don't you worry we're not concerned with your past we're concerned with your future that's what we're concerned about now don't don't beat yourself in purgatory all the time that's already been taken care of it's a done deal you can't do anything about yesterday but your future is what God's got on his mind you would have never even Satan would have never been able to see the potential and this man that would never weigh over 150 pounds in his in his bodily flesh starts out as a boxer never defeated going west and he's laying on a saddle and a fella starts playing through his comb and the spirit of God drops don't worry no matter how far you go God will find you that guy's family's been murdered and tormented and had a wretch but God know what he laid inside of your seed it's not your flesh that is so important it's the seed that has been deposited [Applause] amen thank you Lord the messages that you hear are more than the mind of a man but God choreographed every sermon and you hear it brother Branham say well I was I just come down I wanted to worship with you I came into town and I wanted to worship with you really don't have any notes but brother Neville said You Preach and he gets up and preaches and knoweth it not one of the most powerful sermons he ever preach or door in a door and he gets up and he just starts talking because it wasn't him patience standing in front of him he said you've been nervous nervous since a child about 40 years I see you get off a bus and the dog chases you down the road I've been nervous since that time and you begin to realize that that man don't know you but that that presence that's between you he knows you now you're the you're the granddaughter of a great preacher isn't that right yeah his name Charlie I've known him for many years now what he preached all those years now lives inside of you thank you Lord am I right thank you Lord and there's a special blessing because you're his Granddaddy and God will pay his even his grandchildren yeah a special blessing because of his work but there's an enemy would try to deter you and take you in different directions but if you can just remember your origin preaching to More Than Just That Girl don't you never be ashamed to work God has brought you from amen because where God brought you from he's taken you back it's more than just a salmon story it's just more than a migration of birds God brought you from heaven and out of the Lamb's Book and he's going to break you back Russia screaming she wants to drop a bomb on American end at all but there's Angels standing there I'm finishing now but there's Angels standing there those men are ordained to fulfill what God Said was going to happen just like you're ordained to fulfill what gods have in the Bride of Jesus Christ China's screaming North Korea screaming I ran screaming and we appear as the weakest that we've ever been God ordained that too but nothing can happen not one bomb can drop until God's got a covenant with the families of the Earth that can have the most powerful weapons even beyond their mind's life it doesn't matter they can't do anything until that last seed comes in he knows where they're at because he was sitting on a boat hair down on his shoulders his robe was a little dirty and he just simply said A sower went forth to sew because he was the great sword and only hours he'd go to a graveyard for what you're the most important thing on God's mind the stars are hanging in orbit and yet in all of God's Great vastness you are the most important thing on God's mind why do you talk to them in parables blessed are your eyes are you see blessed are your ears for you here blessed are you Ray Erickson blessed are you blessed are you Wayne Lawson blessed are you you could have been a lot of things on the Earth but God gave you the highest job he could give you the preach this word if you hear I've died don't believe it for a second amen because I'll be more alive there than I've ever been here I love you with all my heart thank you I love you I love you with all my heart amen I hope someday we can come back and see you again amen come on but if that doesn't happen look for me I will be there
