[1:12:00] amen and and labored for us until he
[1:12:03] became
[1:12:04] hungry can you imagine that the creator
[1:12:06] of the universe would stand on a hill in
[1:12:07] galilee and feel hunger pains down in
[1:12:10] his stomach amen just to know what
[1:12:12] you're going through

[1:12:24] purpose why he came the reason he
[1:12:26] endured those things

[1:19:50] worth it all
[1:19:51] amen god bless you tonight exodus 2 and
[1:19:55] verse 23
[1:19:57] and he said it came to pass in the
[1:19:59] process of time
[1:20:00] that the king of egypt died
[1:20:03] and the children of israel sighed by the
[1:20:05] reason of bondage
[1:20:07] and they cried and their cry came up to
[1:20:09] god by reason of the bondage
[1:20:12] and god heard their groaning
[1:20:15] and god remembered his covenant with
[1:20:17] abraham with isaac and jacob and with
[1:20:19] jacob
[1:20:20] and god looked upon the children of
[1:20:22] israel
[1:20:23] and god had respect unto them
[1:20:26] next chapter now moses kept the flock of
[1:20:29] jethro his father-in-law the priest of
[1:20:31] medium and he led the flock to the
[1:20:33] backside of the desert and came to the
[1:20:36] mountain of god even to horeb and the
[1:20:39] angel of the lord appeared unto him in a
[1:20:41] flame of fire out of the midst of the
[1:20:43] bush and he looked and behold the bush
[1:20:46] burned with fire and the bush was not
[1:20:48] consumed
[1:20:50] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:20:53] see this great sight
[1:20:54] while the bush is not burned
[1:20:56] and when the lord saw that he turned
[1:20:59] aside to see god called unto him out of
[1:21:01] the midst of the bush and said moses
[1:21:04] moses
[1:21:05] and he said here am i
[1:21:07] and he said draw not not
[1:21:09] hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[1:21:12] feet
[1:21:13] for the place whereon thou standest is
[1:21:15] holy ground
[1:21:17] moreover he said i am the god of thy
[1:21:19] father the god of abraham the god of
[1:21:21] isaac the god of jacob and moses hit his
[1:21:24] face for he is afraid to look upon god
[1:21:27] and the lord said
[1:21:29] i have surely seen the affliction of my
[1:21:31] people which are in egypt and i've heard
[1:21:34] their cry by reason of their taskmasters
[1:21:37] for i know their sorrows
[1:21:40] and i am come down to deliver them out
[1:21:42] of the hand of the egyptians and to
[1:21:45] bring them up out of that land into a
[1:21:47] good land and enlarge into a land
[1:21:49] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[1:21:52] place of the canaanites and the hittites
[1:21:54] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[1:21:56] the hibites and the jebusites now
[1:21:59] therefore behold the cry of the children
[1:22:01] of israel has come unto me
[1:22:03] and i have also seen the oppression
[1:22:05] where with the egyptians oppress them it
[1:22:08] doesn't look like god misses anything
[1:22:11] amen come now therefore and i will send
[1:22:13] thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[1:22:16] forth my people the children of israel
[1:22:18] out of egypt and moses said unto god who
[1:22:21] am i
[1:22:22] that i should go into pharaoh and that i
[1:22:24] should bring forth the children of
[1:22:25] israel out of egypt and he said
[1:22:27] certainly i will be with thee and this
[1:22:30] shall be a token of thee that i've sent
[1:22:32] thee when thou has brought forth the
[1:22:34] people of egypt you shall serve god upon
[1:22:36] this mountain and moses said unto god
[1:22:39] behold when i'm come to the children of
[1:22:41] israel and shall say unto them the god
[1:22:43] of your fathers has sent me unto you and
[1:22:45] they shall say to me what is his name
[1:22:47] what shall i say unto them and moses
[1:22:49] said it and god said unto moses i am
[1:22:53] that i am and he said thus shalt thou
[1:22:56] say unto the children of israel i am has
[1:22:59] sent me unto you and god said moreover
[1:23:02] unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the
[1:23:05] children of israel
[1:23:06] the lord god of your fathers the god of
[1:23:08] abraham the god of isaac the god of
[1:23:11] jacob has sent me unto you and this is
[1:23:14] my name forever
[1:23:17] and this is my memorial unto all
[1:23:21] generations
[1:23:22] amen god bless you today you can be
[1:23:24] seated
[1:23:36] i'd like to speak to you on a little
[1:23:38] thought that lord began to
[1:23:40] set upon my heart as i would
[1:23:42] come to these meetings loose them
[1:23:44] and let them go
[1:23:47] loose them and let them go you know it's
[1:23:49] a very wonderful thing to read the
[1:23:51] scripture
[1:23:52] as we have read and to understand
[1:23:54] that this is a god who hears and
[1:23:57] understands
[1:23:59] he understands your situations he
[1:24:01] understands your problems he understands
[1:24:03] exactly where you're at every moment of
[1:24:06] the day
[1:24:07] he knows exactly the feelings that
[1:24:08] you're having he's been through every
[1:24:10] one of them he's he as brother nathan
[1:24:12] was saying he's felt hunger he's felt
[1:24:14] for being forsaken he's felt the the
[1:24:17] feelings of humanity and he's a god who
[1:24:20] hears and understands i want you to
[1:24:23] understand this god has heard your cry
[1:24:25] he has heard your request he has seen
[1:24:27] your tears he he has seen and under and
[1:24:30] heard the questions that are in your
[1:24:32] hearts i i want you to understand
[1:24:34] tonight you're serving a personal god
[1:24:37] not just a god who's somewhere way off
[1:24:39] somewhere
[1:24:40] out there in the clouds somewhere but
[1:24:42] he's a very present god for a present
[1:24:45] need and this is what he was telling
[1:24:47] them and telling moses as you stood here
[1:24:49] when they ask you who i am you tell them
[1:24:51] i am that i am in other words i am
[1:24:55] present that whatever you have need of
[1:24:57] i'm present for that so if you need a
[1:24:59] healer i am if you need a savior i am if
[1:25:03] you need a deliverer i am if you need a
[1:25:06] waymaker i am if you need a promise
[1:25:08] keeper i am if you need a comforter i am
[1:25:12] if you need a god i am if you need a
[1:25:15] friend i am i am whatever you have need
[1:25:18] of in your present situation and he also
[1:25:21] was showing moses that he's not just a
[1:25:24] god of history although he was a god of
[1:25:26] abraham isaac and jacob but he was also
[1:25:29] showing him i'm the same yesterday today
[1:25:32] and forever and this is what he wants to
[1:25:34] get across to unto you young people
[1:25:36] maybe in these meetings that he wants
[1:25:38] you to understand that he's not just a
[1:25:40] god of history sure he showed himself
[1:25:43] powerly powerfully 50 years ago or 60
[1:25:46] years ago and and many many times down
[1:25:49] through your parents life and maybe
[1:25:50] sometimes in your lives but he wants you
[1:25:52] to understand that tonight i am that i
[1:25:55] am jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:25:59] and forever because if he's just a god
[1:26:01] of yesterday but not a god of today he's
[1:26:03] not a god at all but he is a god that
[1:26:06] right now can meet any need touch any
[1:26:08] heart change any life it doesn't matter
[1:26:11] how bad you're covered up in sin it
[1:26:13] doesn't matter if you've been a
[1:26:14] backslider for however many years this
[1:26:16] is a god who can meet your needs who can
[1:26:19] change your life who can touch you and
[1:26:21] turn you around you might be going down
[1:26:23] the wrong path tonight but this god is
[1:26:25] big enough to take care of you this god
[1:26:28] is big enough to take the challenge of
[1:26:30] any devil in hell that would try to rise
[1:26:32] up and try to come against you this god
[1:26:34] is big enough and he's a present god so
[1:26:38] it's not one that's miles away or even
[1:26:40] in another country somewhere or it's
[1:26:42] distance and or he's unaware of what's
[1:26:44] going on this god is very personal he
[1:26:48] knows what it's like to ask why
[1:26:52] amen he knows exactly because he would
[1:26:55] say it there on the cross why hast thou
[1:26:57] forsaken me so he also knows a feeling
[1:27:00] of feeling
[1:27:02] forsaken amen he knows what it's like to
[1:27:05] go through social distancing
[1:27:08] and feel forsaken and all alone and
[1:27:10] nobody cares and nobody understands he
[1:27:13] knows all about it therefore he had put
[1:27:15] in his word i will never leave you or
[1:27:18] forsake you
[1:27:19] because i know what they're feeling is
[1:27:21] like i know what it's like to feel like
[1:27:23] i'm all by myself and nobody cares and
[1:27:26] nobody understands and nobody wants to
[1:27:28] even know about my troubles he knows all
[1:27:30] about that but so he had put something
[1:27:32] in his word that when you feel forsaken
[1:27:35] he'll put that in his word and said i
[1:27:36] won't forsake you amen men may forsake
[1:27:39] you friends may forsake you every kind
[1:27:42] of the word all things of the world is
[1:27:43] going to move away and forsake but
[1:27:45] there's a god here tonight that promises
[1:27:48] i'm your friend that's sticking closer
[1:27:50] than a brother that when you're in the
[1:27:51] hardest trials of your life when you're
[1:27:53] going through the deepest darkest
[1:27:55] moments of your life i'm there
[1:27:58] amen when you're in tears and you're in
[1:28:00] sorrow i'm there amen when you can't
[1:28:02] find comfort i'm there when you can't
[1:28:05] find somebody to lean on i'm there
[1:28:09] hallelujah this is a friend amen that
[1:28:11] wants to be your friend closer than
[1:28:13] anyone here in this building
[1:28:15] closer than your mama and your daddy you
[1:28:17] can find somebody that you can rest upon
[1:28:22] he knows the feeling and he's heard your
[1:28:24] cry
[1:28:25] he's seen what the devil has been doing
[1:28:27] to you and he has come down to deliver
[1:28:32] oh hallelujah
[1:28:33] now this god is a supernatural god
[1:28:36] he's not an intellectual god he's a
[1:28:39] supernatural god and he has supernatural
[1:28:42] signs and supernatural wonders and
[1:28:44] there's a supernatural in the midst when
[1:28:46] he comes down that's moses when he came
[1:28:49] down now moses had tried him on his own
[1:28:51] he tried to amen to deliver the children
[1:28:54] of israel he had tried to bring him out
[1:28:56] as as he knew the promises they'd been
[1:28:58] given for and so he tried and he
[1:28:59] produced a dead egyptian so he's fleeing
[1:29:02] out there on the back side of the desert
[1:29:04] and he's all alone and he's thinking
[1:29:05] god's done for god but god hasn't forgot
[1:29:08] it's been 40 years but god hasn't forgot
[1:29:12] amen it's been 50 60 years since the
[1:29:14] prophet's been gone but god hasn't
[1:29:16] forgot
[1:29:18] hallelujah his word is still true
[1:29:21] those that are alive and remain shall be
[1:29:24] changed
[1:29:25] amen he hasn't forgot one of his
[1:29:27] promises he hasn't forgot one dot of his
[1:29:29] word he knows and he knows all about it
[1:29:32] and he still has the power to bring it
[1:29:34] to pass
[1:29:36] in your life
[1:29:39] hallelujah and so moses is out there
[1:29:42] wandering around and taking care of a
[1:29:43] few sheep and he sees something that's
[1:29:45] very supernatural
[1:29:47] amen no he may he couldn't explain it he
[1:29:49] couldn't describe it he couldn't exactly
[1:29:52] tell exactly all about it so he thought
[1:29:53] i'll go see it because something's going
[1:29:55] on there's a bush that's on fire but
[1:29:57] it's not burning
[1:30:00] and he walks up there and he begins to
[1:30:02] approach it and a voice speaks out of
[1:30:04] the bush it was a supernatural thing
[1:30:06] that took place and he told moses i am
[1:30:09] that i am it was showing them always
[1:30:12] present tense not i was not or not i
[1:30:15] will be but i am
[1:30:17] i've come down to show you that i am
[1:30:20] your deliverer
[1:30:23] oh hallelujah i pray that same pillar of
[1:30:25] fire falls in this building tonight
[1:30:28] that'll come down and show you i'm not
[1:30:30] just the preacher's deliverer or mama's
[1:30:32] deliverer or daddy's deliver or the
[1:30:34] deacons deliver i'm your deliverer
[1:30:37] i'm your satisfier i'm your god
[1:30:41] not just their god i'm your god
[1:30:45] [Applause]

[1:30:49] voice spoke

[1:38:52] guess what disbelief whatever you want
[1:38:54] to call it
[1:38:56] i've seen a lady
[1:38:58] stand there in faith
[1:39:03] she was an example
[1:39:05] godly example
[1:39:07] of faith
[1:39:10] i can't tell you how many times
[1:39:12] in a meeting that she would be in the

[1:39:33] i don't care how much they say it don't
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:43] yeah
[1:39:45] i'm tired of that stinking rotten
[1:39:47] devil that wants to take the joy out of
[1:39:49] the hearts of men and women
[1:39:54] i feel like the man when people want to
[1:39:56] say i'm making a scene or i'm making um
[1:39:59] whatever they want to call it holy
[1:40:01] roller this that and the other whatever
[1:40:02] they want whatever name they want to put
[1:40:04] up brother brown said he said he ain't
[1:40:05] never seen the holy roller yet
[1:40:08] but anyway
[1:40:10] i'm like the man that was sitting in
[1:40:12] that wheelchair
[1:40:14] and he'd been told that he was healed
[1:40:16] and he began to confess it
[1:40:19] over i'm healed in the name of jesus i'm
[1:40:21] healed in the name of jesus you know he
[1:40:23] calls the scene in his town
[1:40:25] his family and they they be you're
[1:40:27] making a mockery of the word no you're
[1:40:29] not making a mockery when you confess
[1:40:31] the word
[1:40:33] that's all he was doing he was
[1:40:35] confessing the word
[1:40:36] by his stripes i'm healed
[1:40:39] and a bunch of preachers got backslidden
[1:40:40] apparently preachers come over there and
[1:40:42] begin to talk to him and said you know
[1:40:44] what you're making a mockery you you
[1:40:46] ought to be ashamed of himself he said
[1:40:47] sir if you were sitting in the seat i am
[1:40:52] if you were sitting where i'm sitting
[1:40:54] you wouldn't take the last hope from me
[1:40:57] by his stripes i'm healed and out of
[1:41:00] that seat he came
[1:41:03] and i want to tell those who want to say
[1:41:04] you need to shut up you need not be so
[1:41:07] loud and you need to not have so much
[1:41:09] worship if you were sitting where i was
[1:41:11] sitting
[1:41:12] and i was bound and lust and i was bound
[1:41:15] and sin and god raised me up from there
[1:41:18] i've got something to sing about
[1:41:21] i got something to shout about i have
[1:41:23] witnessed the power of the holy ghost in
[1:41:26] my life
[1:41:44] hallelujah well you say well brother
[1:41:46] timothy i've seen a lot of people shout
[1:41:48] and dance and they ain't got no victory
[1:41:49] they go right in pornography this well
[1:41:51] i've seen a lot of people that say they
[1:41:52] got the word and they're in pornography
[1:41:58] i didn't mean to go there but anyway
[1:42:01] amen
[1:42:04] amen
[1:42:05] it is it ain't the word the
[1:42:07] intellectuals
[1:42:09] the intellectual capabilities to
[1:42:11] understand something it's the life of
[1:42:13] the word
[1:42:17] he said they'll worship me in spirit and
[1:42:19] truth
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:24] but anyway from chapter 14 and verse 1
[1:42:26] says the lord speaking to moses now this
[1:42:29] is after all the plagues and we're
[1:42:30] skipping a lot of things all the plagues
[1:42:31] and things that are taken the death
[1:42:33] angel they come through the land
[1:42:36] he said speaking to the children of
[1:42:37] israel
[1:42:40] that they turn and encount
[1:42:42] before petheroth
[1:42:44] between migdal and the sea
[1:42:47] for pharaoh will say of the children of
[1:42:49] israel they are entangled in the land
[1:42:51] and wilderness has shut them in
[1:42:54] and i will harden pharaoh's heart
[1:42:56] and he shall follow after them and i
[1:42:58] will be honored upon pharaoh and upon
[1:43:00] all his hosts
[1:43:01] that the egyptians may know
[1:43:03] that i am the lord
[1:43:06] now these must be some stupid people
[1:43:10] because apparently after all they've
[1:43:11] seen they still didn't know he's the
[1:43:13] lord
[1:43:15] i mean they've seen their their god of
[1:43:16] the nile turned to blood they've seen
[1:43:18] amen frogs as deep is all who knows how
[1:43:21] deep
[1:43:22] and flies and bowls and then their death
[1:43:25] of the firstborn
[1:43:31] and it was told the king of egypt that
[1:43:32] the people fled and the heart of pharaoh
[1:43:35] and his servants were turned against the
[1:43:36] people and they said why have we done
[1:43:38] this and we've let israel go from
[1:43:40] serving us and he made readiest chariot
[1:43:42] and took his people with him and he took
[1:43:44] 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots
[1:43:47] of egypt and the captains over every one
[1:43:49] of them
[1:43:50] and the lord hardened the heart of
[1:43:51] pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued
[1:43:53] after the children of israel and the
[1:43:55] children of israel went out with a high
[1:43:57] hand
[1:43:58] but the egyptians pursued them and all
[1:44:00] the horses and chariots and his horsemen
[1:44:02] and his army and overtook them by
[1:44:04] encamping by the sea and when pharaoh
[1:44:06] drew nigh the children of israel lifted
[1:44:08] up their eyes and behold the egyptians
[1:44:10] marched after them and they were sore
[1:44:12] afraid
[1:44:14] now that's another paradox really it's
[1:44:16] interesting that al after all they've
[1:44:18] seen and all they witnessed
[1:44:21] they're afraid
[1:44:24] and the children of israel cried out
[1:44:26] unto the lord and they said unto moses
[1:44:28] because there are no graves in egypt
[1:44:30] hast thou taken us away to die in the
[1:44:32] wilderness wherefore
[1:44:34] has thou dealt us with dealt with us
[1:44:37] with us to carry us forth out of egypt
[1:44:39] it's not this not the word that we
[1:44:40] detail thee in egypt saying let us alone
[1:44:42] that we may serve the egyptians for it
[1:44:44] had been better for us to serve the
[1:44:46] egyptians
[1:44:47] then
[1:44:48] that we and that we should die in the
[1:44:50] wilderness
[1:44:52] and moses said unto the
[1:44:55] how much sense does that make
[1:44:59] they've been dying for 400 years
[1:45:03] with a slave belt
[1:45:05] and now they're experiencing freedom and
[1:45:07] they're saying well we could have just
[1:45:09] died in egypt
[1:45:10] well if i'm going to die i'm going to
[1:45:12] die a free
[1:45:13] [Applause]
[1:45:14] man if i'm going to die i'm going to die
[1:45:17] a liberated man
[1:45:21] amen and moses said unto the people fear
[1:45:24] ye not stand still and see the salvation
[1:45:28] of the lord which has shown you this day
[1:45:31] for the egyptians which you have seen
[1:45:33] today you shall see them again no more
[1:45:36] forever remember that no more forever

[1:46:22] hallelujah it's not just a pastor it's

[1:49:31] oh my
[1:49:33] and we know the stories they moved up
[1:49:35] amen the pillar of fire went and stood
[1:49:37] between the egyptians and the camp of
[1:49:40] israel and moses stretched out his hand
[1:49:42] over the sea and the lord caused the sea
[1:49:44] to go back by a strong west east wind
[1:49:47] and made the sea dry land and the waters
[1:49:49] were divided and the children of israel
[1:49:51] went into the midst of the sea on dry
[1:49:53] ground and the waters were a wall on the
[1:49:55] right and on their left and the
[1:49:57] egyptians thought that's a pretty good
[1:49:59] idea let's go too and went after them in
[1:50:01] the midst of the sea even all pharaoh's
[1:50:03] horses all his chariots and all his
[1:50:06] horsemen and it came to pass in the
[1:50:08] morning watched the lord
[1:50:14] looked upon the host of egyptians to the
[1:50:16] pillar of fire in the cloud and troubled
[1:50:18] the host of egyptian and took off their
[1:50:20] chariot wheels that they drave them
[1:50:23] heavily so the egyptians said let us
[1:50:24] flee from the face of the israel for the
[1:50:27] lord fighted for them against the
[1:50:29] egyptians
[1:50:32] and the lord said unto moses stretch out
[1:50:34] the hand of the sea and the waters may
[1:50:36] come again upon the egyptians upon their
[1:50:39] chariots and upon their horsemen and
[1:50:41] moses stretched forth his hand over the
[1:50:43] sea and the sea returned to his strength
[1:50:45] when the morning appear and the
[1:50:47] egyptians fled and the lord overthrew
[1:50:49] the egyptians in the midst of the sea
[1:50:52] and the waters returned and covered the
[1:50:54] chariots the horsemen and all the hosts
[1:50:56] of pharaoh that it came into the sea
[1:50:59] after them and there remained not so
[1:51:01] much as one of them but the children of
[1:51:04] israel walked upon dry land
[1:51:08] and the waters were a wall to their
[1:51:10] right into their left thus saved the
[1:51:13] israel lord saved israel that day out of
[1:51:16] the hands of the egyptians and israel
[1:51:18] saw
[1:51:21] the egyptians dead upon the seashore
[1:51:26] and something here because he said the
[1:51:27] egyptians that you see you'll see no
[1:51:30] more forever
[1:51:31] and then a few scriptures later they saw
[1:51:34] them on the seashore
[1:51:37] but their capabilities were different
[1:51:41] they no longer had the life in them they
[1:51:43] no longer were able to pick up a whip
[1:51:45] again
[1:51:46] they no longer could grab them and
[1:51:48] ravish them they no longer could take
[1:51:50] them under their control they lost their
[1:51:53] power
[1:51:59] hallelujah
[1:52:00] they lost all power to do it
[1:52:04] no wonder when miriam saw that one that
[1:52:06] had striped her and beat her and had
[1:52:08] come against her she grabbed the
[1:52:10] tambourine she said this is more than i
[1:52:12] can take my enemy is dead

[1:58:30] and prostitutes on the street he
[1:58:32] expected you to do all kinds of things

[2:04:34] he comes there and he says man
[2:04:36] this wasn't what i was expecting
[2:04:38] this wasn't what i was looking for
[2:04:40] he goes outside to get him a fresh
[2:04:42] breath of breath of air
[2:04:45] he's standing there looking out out at
[2:04:47] the stars and saying well really why did
[2:04:48] i come there and all of a sudden here's
[2:04:50] a creek in the door and out the creek of
[2:04:52] this door comes this ragged little girl
[2:04:55] and she's carrying a pan of dishwater
[2:04:57] and she's going down to a fence and she
[2:04:59] pours it over the fence and he's
[2:05:01] watching her

[2:05:24] and he begins to talk to her
[2:05:26] begins to express her heart his heart to

[2:05:29] asked her who she was
[2:05:31] brother said she was one of them
[2:05:32] castaways didn't think much about her
[2:05:37] just put off in the corner thought she
[2:05:38] was a bit too fanatical or something
[2:05:42] she's over there doing
[2:05:43] doing the work

[2:08:00] let's turn to acts chapter 2 and verse
[2:08:02] 5.
[2:08:05] peter therefore was kept in prison
[2:08:08] but prayer was made without ceasing of
[2:08:10] the church of god for him
[2:08:12] and when herod would have been would
[2:08:14] have brought him forth the same night
[2:08:16] peter
[2:08:17] was sleeping between two soldiers
[2:08:20] bound with chains
[2:08:23] and the keepers before the door kept the
[2:08:26] prison
[2:08:27] and behold the angel of the lord came
[2:08:29] unto him and a light shined in the
[2:08:32] prison
[2:08:33] and he smotes peter on the side and
[2:08:36] raised him up saying arise up quickly
[2:08:39] and his chains fell off from his hands
[2:08:42] and the angel said in them gird thyself
[2:08:44] and bind up those sandals and so he did
[2:08:47] and saith unto him cast thy garment
[2:08:49] about thee and follow me and he went out
[2:08:51] and followed him and was not that it was
[2:08:53] true which was done by the angel but
[2:08:55] thought he saw a vision but when they
[2:08:57] were past the first and the second ward
[2:09:00] and they came to the iron gate that
[2:09:02] leadeth unto the city which opened to
[2:09:04] them of his own accord and they went out
[2:09:06] and passed on through one street and
[2:09:08] fought with the angel departed apart
[2:09:10] from him and when peter was come to
[2:09:13] himself he said now i'll know assuredly
[2:09:16] that the lord has sent the angel and
[2:09:18] hath delivered me out of the hand of
[2:09:20] herod and from all the what
[2:09:24] expectation of the people of the jews
[2:09:27] the devil's expectations was changed
[2:09:33] many of you he's trying to put every
[2:09:34] kind of sin in your life
[2:09:36] every kind of thing on your phones

[2:09:42] every kind of defilement and every kind
[2:09:44] of thing and spirits of anxieties and
[2:09:47] fears and things you don't think you can
[2:09:48] overcome amen but all of a sudden you're
[2:09:51] sitting in a prison no more
[2:09:53] and you seem to be bound but you don't
[2:09:55] realize back at home there's a whole
[2:09:57] whole
[2:09:58] household of people that are praying for

[2:10:02] there's churches that are praying for
[2:10:04] you there's homes that are praying for
[2:10:06] you there's there's parents that are
[2:10:08] praying for you there's pastors that are
[2:10:10] praying for you and god will come right
[2:10:13] down in your prison and say boy get up
[2:10:18] and he'll take you past the first gate
[2:10:20] sanctificate justification pass the
[2:10:22] second game sanctification pass of god
[2:10:25] the gate of iron the holy ghost and set
[2:10:28] you free
[2:10:29] [Applause]
[2:10:32] that is what he's here to do
[2:10:35] there is an angel here that's here to
[2:10:37] smote you on the side and say it's time
[2:10:39] for you to quit sitting in that prison i
[2:10:42] got power over the prison i got power
[2:10:44] over the one sitting next to you i got
[2:10:46] power over the devil that's trying to
[2:10:48] hold you
[2:10:49] i say satan loose them and let them go
[2:10:54] you don't have to be bowed one moment
[2:10:56] longer you don't have to serve the devil
[2:10:58] one moment
[2:11:00] five more minutes with the devil's too
[2:11:02] much
[2:11:04] i say tonight throw that hoe down throw
[2:11:07] that thing down and spin tormenting here
[2:11:09] and say devil i'm not going home with it
[2:11:12] i'm not picking it back up i'm not
[2:11:14] holding one more rotators i'm not going
[2:11:17] down one more your rose
[2:11:19] [Applause]
[2:11:24] hallelujah
[2:11:28] he expected you would quit
[2:11:30] he expected you would be lost he
[2:11:33] expected that you would have no hope but
[2:11:35] an angel came
[2:11:37] and the devil's plans for you were
[2:11:39] canceled
[2:11:40] they were changed for eternity when the
[2:11:42] angel drops into the room the devil's
[2:11:45] voice is over
[2:11:56] oh praise the name of the lord
[2:12:01] i can think of another man
[2:12:03] and got real sick one day and they
[2:12:06] called for jesus to come and pray for
[2:12:08] him
[2:12:09] and jesus seemed like he went another
[2:12:11] way he did
[2:12:12] he went exactly the opposite way
[2:12:17] it's easy to feel that sometimes you
[2:12:20] know when you're going through things in
[2:12:21] life
[2:12:22] you're calling out to his name you're
[2:12:24] crying
[2:12:25] you're saying lord move lord move
[2:12:27] just seems like he keeps going
[2:12:32] but he has a plan
[2:12:36] but daryl ward
[2:12:37] helped me a lot with this situation with
[2:12:39] my mom
[2:12:40] he said you know what he said he was in
[2:12:42] the military so
[2:12:43] he said you know we had military life
[2:12:45] and military training he said there was
[2:12:47] general orders that were given
[2:12:50] and every day you carried out those
[2:12:51] general orders
[2:12:53] and he said the only thing that changed
[2:12:54] the general orders of the army or the
[2:12:56] navy was for a commanding officer to
[2:12:58] step in the room and say today we're
[2:13:00] doing this
[2:13:02] and he said you couldn't argue with it
[2:13:03] you couldn't fuss with it you saluted
[2:13:05] him you said yes sir
[2:13:08] he said brother timothy y'all have been
[2:13:10] carrying out the general orders
[2:13:12] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:13:14] they shall recover he's the lord god
[2:13:16] that heals all our diseases he said
[2:13:18] you've been walking in faith he said but
[2:13:21] today
[2:13:22] command an officer stepped in the room
[2:13:24] he said this is the plan
[2:13:26] and i said i salute him
[2:13:33] because he's got power over my life
[2:13:38] i'll carry out his plans
[2:13:40] they shall lay hands on the sick i ain't
[2:13:41] never said i said brother brown said
[2:13:43] i've seen where he put it in i ain't
[2:13:45] seen where he took it out
[2:13:52] altar calls prayer lines
[2:13:55] everything that god has for god's people
[2:13:57] any kind of way he wants to move i want
[2:13:59] to let him move
[2:14:04] he's the commanding officer i'm not
[2:14:07] but i will carry out to the very end
[2:14:09] whatever he says
[2:14:13] but here's this man going down down
[2:14:15] until he dies and they put him in a tomb
[2:14:19] and jesus
[2:14:20] is walking the other way four days
[2:14:24] his disciples are questioning and
[2:14:25] wondering what in the world is going on
[2:14:28] we we've seen you do so many mighty
[2:14:29] miracle things and you mean you're going
[2:14:30] to let your friend die
[2:14:33] he said he's not dead he sleeps
[2:14:36] the sickness is not unto death but for
[2:14:37] the glory of god that the son of man my
[2:14:39] son of god might be glorified thereby
[2:14:43] i love that how he talked about you know
[2:14:45] the blind man and john there that was
[2:14:47] born blind and the disciples asked was
[2:14:50] this man born blind because his mom and
[2:14:51] dad sinned or because of his sin he said
[2:14:53] no he said so that the glory of god
[2:14:56] might be revealed in him
[2:14:59] you're not going through things because
[2:15:01] you've done something
[2:15:02] you're going through things so god can
[2:15:04] prove who he is
[2:15:14] and here he comes
[2:15:17] scripture verse 5 says in jesus love
[2:15:20] martha this is john 11 verse 5
[2:15:22] and her sister in lazarus when he heard
[2:15:24] therefore he was sick
[2:15:26] he abode two days to the same place
[2:15:28] where he was and after they say let us
[2:15:30] go on to judea
[2:15:31] master the jews saw blake sought to
[2:15:33] stone thee goes there there again and he
[2:15:35] just keeps on moving and keeps on going
[2:15:38] he says our friend lazarus sleepeth but
[2:15:40] i go that i may awake him
[2:15:43] and the disciples said lord if he sleeps
[2:15:45] he shall do well how jesus spake
[2:15:47] of his death but they thought he spoke
[2:15:49] of him taking a rest and sleep then
[2:15:51] jesus said to them plainly lazarus is
[2:15:53] dead and i'm glad for your sakes that i
[2:15:55] was not there to the intent you may
[2:15:57] believe nevertheless let us go unto him
[2:16:00] and then said thomas
[2:16:02] let us also go that we may die with him
[2:16:04] then when jesus came he found that he
[2:16:06] had laying in the grave four days
[2:16:08] already now bethany was nine to
[2:16:10] jerusalem
[2:16:11] going down to martha as soon as she
[2:16:13] heard jesus was coming went and met him
[2:16:15] but mary set still in the house then
[2:16:17] said mary martha unto jesus lord if thou
[2:16:20] has been here my brother would not have
[2:16:22] died
[2:16:23] but i know that even now
[2:16:25] whatsoever thou will ask of god god will
[2:16:27] give it to thee jesus said unto her thy
[2:16:30] brothers shall rise again martha said i
[2:16:33] know that he shall rise again in the
[2:16:34] resurrection at the last day and jesus
[2:16:37] said unto her i am
[2:16:42] i am the resurrection and the life and
[2:16:45] he that believeth in me though he were
[2:16:47] dead yet he shall live and whosoever
[2:16:50] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[2:16:53] die believeth now this
[2:16:56] she said yeah lord i believe that thou
[2:16:58] art the christ the son of god we shall
[2:17:00] come into the world and when she had so
[2:17:02] said she went away and called mary and
[2:17:04] said the master is come and calleth for
[2:17:07] thee and as soon as she heard that she
[2:17:09] rose and came unto him and jesus was not
[2:17:11] yet coming to town but in the place
[2:17:13] where martha met him and the jews which
[2:17:15] were with her in the house comfort her
[2:17:17] and said when they saw mary and she rose
[2:17:19] up hastily and went out and followed her
[2:17:20] saying she'd go with them to the grave
[2:17:22] to weep there
[2:17:23] then when mary come to jesus she fell
[2:17:25] down on his feet saying lord if thou has
[2:17:28] been here my brother had not died but
[2:17:30] when jesus therefore saw him weeping and
[2:17:32] the jews also weeping which came with
[2:17:33] her he groaned in the spirit it was
[2:17:35] troubled and said where have you laid
[2:17:37] him and they said lord come and see and
[2:17:40] jesus wept
[2:17:42] then said the jews behold how he loved
[2:17:44] him and some of them said could this man
[2:17:46] which opened the eyes of the blind
[2:17:48] caused even this man should not have
[2:17:49] died jesus therefore again groaning
[2:17:51] himself coming to the grave it was a
[2:17:54] cave and a stone lay upon it and jesus
[2:17:56] said take away the stone
[2:17:58] martha the sister of him that was dead
[2:18:00] saying to him lord by the time he
[2:18:02] stinketh for he had been dead for days
[2:18:05] jesus said unto her said not unto thee
[2:18:07] that if i would have believed i should
[2:18:09] have see the glory of god and they took
[2:18:11] away the stone and the place where the
[2:18:13] dead was laid and jesus lifted up his
[2:18:15] eyes and said father i thank thee that
[2:18:18] thou hast heard me
[2:18:19] and i know that thou hears me always but
[2:18:22] because of this people which stand by i
[2:18:24] said it that they may believe that thou
[2:18:26] hast sent me and when he had thus spoken
[2:18:28] he cried with a loud voice lazarus
[2:18:32] come forth
[2:18:36] and here's a cold dead stiff man been
[2:18:39] laying there four days but he heard the
[2:18:42] voice of the resurrection
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:46] in other words he heard a voice greater
[2:18:49] than death
[2:18:54] and when that voice
[2:18:56] called unto him death could no longer
[2:18:59] hold him
[2:19:03] oh hallelujah amen i want you to
[2:19:06] understand he was showing that he could
[2:19:08] overcome the chief of the tribe of
[2:19:10] demons
[2:19:11] the chief of the tribe of demons and
[2:19:13] when the chief falls everything under
[2:19:16] him false
[2:19:17] [Music]
[2:19:18] we know that when he went to that maniac
[2:19:20] come up on the platform brother branham
[2:19:22] and you know the story and that man was
[2:19:24] i said i'll hit you and he said over my
[2:19:26] feet you'll fall and he rared back
[2:19:28] hocked the spit and spitting brother
[2:19:29] man's face ran back to hit him and he
[2:19:31] before he could he just fell over his
[2:19:33] feet
[2:19:36] and the police come up and said is he
[2:19:37] delivered he said no he's not delivered
[2:19:39] he said he worships that thing but would
[2:19:41] you get him off my feet
[2:19:43] and he said he took him off rolled him
[2:19:45] off his feet and he went back to the
[2:19:46] pulpit and he said now as i was saying
[2:19:50] faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:19:52] for
[2:19:54] the evidence of things not seen all of a
[2:19:57] sudden a man in a wheelchair popped out
[2:19:58] of his seat
[2:20:00] this one popped off a cot that way he
[2:20:02] said in just about five minutes time
[2:20:04] every person in that building was healed
[2:20:07] he said why because the chief of that
[2:20:09] tribe of demons had made a challenge
[2:20:14] but he lost
[2:20:17] and when he lost every devil fell under
[2:20:21] him
[2:20:24] i want you to hear again tonight as you
[2:20:26] heard last night you were dealing with a
[2:20:28] defeated foe
[2:20:30] he's nothing but a bluff
[2:20:32] our god broke his back at calvary he
[2:20:35] don't have no power he don't have
[2:20:38] another moment he can hold you if he'll
[2:20:40] just walk away and say i ain't going
[2:20:42] that way
[2:20:47] i don't have to be bound by that spirit
[2:20:49] i don't have to be bound i say this
[2:20:52] evening lazarus come forth
