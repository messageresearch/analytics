========================================
[Music] oh yes spirit of God write your word in my heart feel my whole be consume my life God The Vessel I want to so let you you can [Music] Lord amen let's just bow our hearts faithful father we thank you this morning for the grace that you've shown us Lord to be able to stand here today and to lift our hands and have it in our heart to desire that you would fill us Lord father in a in a generation that is steadily moving away from you Lord to have it in our hearts to be close to you and to be associated with people that love you and Lord want to F your spirit and know your realities Lord we just ask you this morning as we invite you as a congregation we invite you to come here into this room Lord to feel the ows and hearts and lives and and Lord your Prophet told us that you would come with your invit and we just ask you now that you would come to the platform and Lord you would take these few things that that we've put together Lord that we feel that you're leading us to say and we ask that you would take those things Lord and you would bless your people and Lord you would give us a Divine Direction this morning and we ask you father now Lord let all the glory be given to you we thank you in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you this morning and certainly good to be here amen if you have your Bibles we're going to be looking in the book of Corinthians uh we want to uh look in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 amen we're just going to maybe to um take something from here this morning one scripture 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 8 um if I've been listening to this tape a little bit lately just been on my heart and and I'm praying the Lord would give us a little something from that would be a blessing to you 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 8 for if the trumpet would give an uncertain sound who should prepare himself to the battle amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated um this is very common uh scripture reading among the church and the people and uh brother brandom made it a very popular scripture among the message people having preached it several times um he he said a lot of things through this scripture and um I just want to maybe share a couple things that has just really stuck out to my heart and U and we just want to uh say we want to welcome everyone this morning God bless you and and to the visitors that are here God bless you uh we we want to say that we certainly thank God for his mercy and how that he is able to bring us amen and I would just sitting there listening to the song service this morning and I had this trumpet sound on my mind and I thought you know it's amazing amen what God can do with music and how he can bring sounds and feelings and and deliver things through it and and I sitting there thinking about it and I and I did want to take time this morning we don't do this often but uh we do want to take time to say God bless you all and we thank you for your uh your worship and the atmosphere here in the church a lot of times we just come the platform and just take off preaching and y'all have to forgive forgive me for that because what it is actually is I get a little nervous if I sit and talk to you and so I got to get in here where the anointing is and then it takes me out of the way and then I'm okay um but so I I usually just go straight to it so never take it as a slide or that I'm that I don't want to speak to the people it's more just about nerves than it is uh if the gift kicks in then we then we take off you know and uh so um we we want to say that and I I was just thinking this morning though about the church and about the the resilience of the people uh to to worship despite uh the issues in the land and the trials and troubles and to come on a Sunday morning and see the church full and the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and and those things don't just happen and so we want to say that we appreciate the men of God and you know and brother Ray for leading and and making a way for the atmosphere to be here it it's a real blessing to our heart to serve with him and and to be with him and under him as a pastor and we appreciate him greatly and uh I'm just thinking about the song Services even this morning and and I don't think we say it much but we appreciate you brother Ben for all you do amen for the songs there's a lot of work goes in this and and we we know he does a lot of other things too but but we really appreciate him for the worship here in the the church and the musicians and so it's it's a real blessing there's a lot going on here and we we sure appreciate lot in the back you know with the deacons and the trustees and there's a lot of work so we do want to just stop once in a while and say that that is that thank you these things are not going unseen they may go unsaid but they're not unseen and we just want to say God bless you and um and I I I thinking of this this morning I was just thinking of the sermon and and what from from the things that I'm gathering from this and I just I just want to speak to you a little bit today and I want to talk to you about a p positive gospel uh I want to talk to you about a positive gospel and in saying that uh I don't want you to relate it to the charismatic world and the way that they view things but but I want to talk to you about a positive gospel that's the very thing that that I would have on my heart and to say something like to say positive I want to say it this way something that ex that is expressed clearly it's something that is fully assured it's something confident it's actually independent of changing circumstances uh it's it's uncontestable or incontestable it's positive it's uh not fictitious it's real uh it's active and effective the word positive actually means effective in social economic function rather than just merely maintaining peace and order but it's something that's positive or something that's active uh it's something that directs moving toward a source of stimulation positive is the higher electric potential consisting the part from which the current flows to external circuits the positive see a positive role model A positive influence a positive point of view it's uh if you pick up some of the synonyms it means a sure a certain a positive meaning having no doubt or uncertainty when you think of sure it stresses the subject of intuition feeling or Assurance see you felt sure I'd forgotten something but certain May apply to a basis of a conclusion or a conviction on definite grounds of in uh disputable evidence say something you're certain about or something you're positive about see certain is to be fully confident it means to be positive as something's going to be certain way having a real or beneficial effect or result they took a positive action got a positive experience it's unquestionable it has positive proof it shows an acceptance or an approval it's positive and I believe that the message that we are preaching today I believe that it is a positive gospel I don't believe that we have anything that's uncertain in the word of God that we are following after we're not here this morning in this I hope so or I think so or maybe so or it could be so or I think it's like we're talking about a positive gospel something that you can take your soul and you can rest your Eternal salvation based upon the things that are being said the things that we and branam said are not a shifting sand they're not ifs and ANS and bunts and maybe but it is a positive absolute truth that comes from almighty God can I say it this way it's not just a truth it is the truth it's not just a way it's the way it's not just an idea it's the truth it's the way it's the life it is Christ it's positive you know we're looking at a world right now if you listen to Prophet speaking a trumpet sound 63 there if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother Bram actually is in the uh the the um he's actually in the Fallout of the elections during this time which of course it very well parallels with our exact timing he said the fall out of an election and he goes into the elections and talks about how that these elections are happening and he's talking about people who invest themselves in these elections and he said how disappointed they have become in the way the elections turned out and the way things are happening and it's odd because the way he's bringing this he said see there is no certainty in politics and then he moves from politics and he says now there's no certainty in home life and then he moves to religion and he said and there's no certainty in religion and then he moves to the church and he says there's no certainty in the church he says but the time brother Bram gets down he actually he actually begins to say is there anything because if you listen the first 20 minutes of the tape you would wonder does he believe there's certainty in anything amen but you know he does believe in some certainties and uh the trumpet gives an uncertain sound in in the paragraph 60 he'll say this he says now I I'm trying to tell you the things of the earth is shaking and you can put no confidence in them they're uncertain and anything that's uncertain I'd just rather leave away from it he said and anything that's uncertain just leave away from it I don't like that negative thing I don't like to get mixed up in the negative side I like it positive be on the positive side I like it positive you know I thought it was powerful because here's a prophet with a platform could pretty much say anything he wanted amen because God was backing him up and he says what I'd like to do is keep it positive I'd like to stay on the positive side do you know that brother BR said in 56 he said that Christianity has no negative nothing in it it's everything absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of God has a positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has a positive hold on him with the assurance by the almighty God by an oath of himself that he will raise him up in the last day and take him to Glory there's no if ands or nothing amen it's something that is positive you know many times Christianity is actually misrepresented Christianity can be represented many times Christianity is represented as religion it's represented as orders it's represented as Traditions but the prophet of God said Christianity is is misrepresented to people he said Christianity has been represented to the people as a declaration of creed he said but Christianity is a living being it's not a declaration of Doctrine it's not a declaration of my thoughts and my ideas but Christianity is a living being Christianity is a living being can you listen to what he's saying he says it's a living being it's Jesus Christ the resurrected God that's alive Among Us right now my goodness amen he'll say it again in 1954 Christianity is a living being in mankind that's the proof of his resurrected God's son who was God With Us amen and hear ye him he'll say that's the way real Christianity is it's a living experience I like that don't you it's a living being it's a living experience and he'll explain what he means Pentecost is not a denomination but Pentecost is an experience that anybody can have if they wish to have it it's something that you experience it's the Holy Spirit Christianity is a living being Christianity is a living experience Christianity is Pentecost not a denomination but it's a Vindicated proof of the resurrection of Jesus Christ you know you have no other way to prove the resurrection of Jesus outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen a Pentecostal experience is a Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ my to think about it today it's an absolute amen then there's got to be an absolute there's got to be a positive amen now in the absolute brother Ram says it like this I think now that we need something positive I think that we need something we can hold on to it's true it's a crucial hour amen we must have something that we are positive that's right something that we can hold on to now how is the case going he said according to Webster an absolute is an unlimited in power it's an ultimate it's an ultimate it's an amen it's the absolute that's the end that's everything now every great achievement that's ever been in the world has been tied to some sort of absolute you cannot do anything unless you have something that you can hold on to Now isn't it beautiful because he's preaching in uncertain sound and he starts letting us know that it's something that is certain and he preaches the entire message of the absolute to guarantee to you that he's saying I'm preaching this because I believe you need something positive you need something that is certain something that will not be changing on you something that doesn't transition with the times you know that's the thing I hate about politics it changes I mean like one day it's this and the next day it's something else it changes with the times it changes with a crowd it changes with a mindset amen but there is something that's not going to change on you there is something that you can put your reputation you can build your life you can build your family and that what we're looking at this morning the prophet of God said is there anything searching is there a place that I can call final is there a place that I can say there's not going to be any changes to this is there a place that I can bring you this morning that says things are not going to change the way they are is the way they always are going to be and he said yes there is a place there is a place we can go it's the certainty it's the word of God and God has given a word in this age amen I don't care what comes I don't care what goes churches come churches fall men come men go but the word of God remaineth forever and ever amen Ministries does not remain forever amen men does not remain forever churches does not remain forever kingdoms does not remain forever but the word of God God it remaineth forever there shall be no end to this amen if you build on this I tell you what a prophet said I'd rather be standing on the word of God Amen than standing in heaven my what a place to stand what an hour to stand something that is positive a place that you can stand that is certain in Matthew 24 the heavens and earth shall pass away but my word it shall not fail God has a certain Foundation my to know there is a place to build Amen in in Low Country in in bottom country people wor about building their houses no place to build they build them they do everything they can do to sh them up the best they can amen but there is a place and Jesus said he can build on the Rock Amen the rock of Revelation the rock of Truth in numbers 23 and 19 amen it's a beautiful reading the 19th and the 20th verse the Bible said God is not a man that he should lie and neither the son of man that he should repent and he that he shall not do it or hath he spoken and he shall not make it good for behold I received a commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it in Psalms 19 and7 the law of the Lord is perfect David's singing these songs I love David's songs for the law of the Lord is perfect to the converting of the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple in Psalms 89 and 34 for my Covenant I will not break nor alter the thing which has gone out of my lip you mean there's somebody that can say something to you that won't alter what they say there is some there is a being somewhere there is an instrument somewhere that can say something and it not be altered after it comes out of their lips whatever they say you can take it to the bank you can you can take it and build your life you can run all over the world and say this is true because it won't be altered God won't pull it back and change it on you my to think I I want you to hear me there's something that you can get a hold of that they won't change it on you after you get started with it this message is the most amen the most sure thing that has ever come into your life God ain't going to pull it back God ain't going to change his mind about it God ain't going to quit backing it amen this message will take you all the way to Glory it's good amen it's good all the way to Glory it'll get you in the door when you get there it'll get you past the Judgment bars there is something that will not be altered my when I when I get to reading these Scriptures it just kind of it just grows up with Amen in Isaiah amen he begin to say Amen of course proverbs 30 amen we got to get Solomon in here the wisest men in the world every word of God is pure and he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him in Isaiah 40 eight the grass withereth and the flower fadeth but the word of our God shall stand forever in Isaiah 55 this is a powerful one to me so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the thing which I please and prosper in the thing were unto I sent it amen that's the word of God you let me let me just say this to you when it comes out of God's mouth when the word comes out of his mouth he cannot alter that word amen to make it fit a certain situation now I've been around enough so-called prophets and they prophesy a little something amen and then they they say it vague enough that they can make the the they can make their prophecies turn to the events you know they they'll just trim things up and they'll turn it around amen they'll they'll alter it enough to make it sound like they really knew what they was doing all the time amen but you recognize God don't have to do that amen When God Says something the thing were unto he sent it that word doesn't change or alter until it become accomplished I don't care how long the word is there it will perform what it is said I I think of the greatest the greatest thing that ever was when brother Bram stood there and said in the beginning he created the heavens and the Earth he said it could have been a million years when God said it let it be light it could have been a million years before light ever came but when God said it it had to come was a settled matter I think of Isaiah the very one who said this in Isaiah the 7th chapter preaching on a Sunday morning would have been a Saturday evening probably at that time but the prophet of God said he was out there preaching amen he and he was he was get got under the inspiration and he never took thought of what he was saying he' just become a channel and and he heard himself utter Behold a virgin shall conceive he said had he ever thought about it he would have never said it but he had already become a channel a prophet is a channel and the word come directly through him and begin to prophesy a it's powerful because he said a virgin shall conceive do you know that it was over 700 years it was over 700 years that that word circled the Earth amen that word Isaiah prophesied and for it is close to 700 years I don't know the exact date but it was almost 700 years it circled the Earth amen until a 16-year-old girl was standing next to a well one morning and that word amen that had went out of Isaiah was actually not the word of a prophet it was a word of God and it was a sure word an unchanging un altering word it was a word of Salvation a word of power a word of Truth it was a positive word a virgin shall conceiv I don't hope so don't think so maybe so maybe God will find somebody maybe somebody will raise up and believe the word it was a it was a positive word that that that God was going to come into the womb of a virgin even if it took 700 years before it happened that word circle the Earth until it dropped into the womb of that little woman amen glory to God think about this in Genesis the 1 third chapter it was God that said the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent I don't think so hope so maybe so but the woman seed shall bruise the head of the serpent and there he was the woman's seed amen it was the virgin's child it was Jesus Christ which was the sure word of God manifested in the Life M to think about it this morning amen that there I'm going to get ahead of myself but I just got to say it amen there's been a word prophesied there's been a message prophesied over the Church of the Living God there coming a bride without spot a Rinko or any such thing I I've heard I heard Paul prophesy amen that there will be a people that's going to change their body they're going to take on incorrupt they're going to put off mortality and I believe amen that that same gospel has never changed but it's been waiting looking for a bride and that's the seed that we're prophesying over you this morning amen that's why we can't get off of the Seven Seals that's why we can't get off of Amen of the god sending a prophet and the message of the hour because it is the seed in the season that we are living in this is a sure word that's going to change the body of somebody wo I'm talking about a positive gospel I'm not talking about something amen that that come out of some Almanac I'm not talking about something amen that come out of some school or out of the mind of some man but this is the Eternal logos of God who thought of you before the world ever began I was just reading yesterday and the prophet said it like this he said the life that was in God that thought of you before the world begin is in your body right now and there's nothing can separate you from it hey I tell you this morning it's not a Creed in me it's not a Dogma in me it's not a teaching in me it is a seed word being manifested in the age and the Bible said the whole earth was groaning waiting for the time of manifestation because if God said it amen it's got to happen we know if God said it just set your clock set your calendar amen just get ready it's got to come it's a positive word well glory to God if they don't got a right to praise you who does Amen if this bride ain't got a right to Rejoice who does [Applause] wo I believe it's time for it it's positive and there are some people who are positive about it see the word that goes out he can't bring that back he's already said it it's already been spoken don't you promise a trip to Disney World unless you're going to do it right amen Zach used to get me over the burel he loved them little flashlights he said Daddy can I have a flashlight say sure tomorrow morning he get up and say when we going to Walmart when we going to Walmart I didn't know what he was want to go to Walmart for I said what we going to Walmart for he said you promised to get me a flashlight yeah if he ever got my promise he knew he could hold me with my own words oh y'all know what I'm talking about I'm talking about when a King gave a man his last wish he was going to crucify him they were going to kill the man they gave him his last wish and he said what do you want he said I want to drink of cold water he said the king said well you can have a drink cold water he said I'm afraid they'll kill me before I get it drink he said no no he said they won't do that he said I promise you they won't take your life till after you drink your water so he had him bring him a glass of cold water the man looked at the king looked at the water and poured it out on the ground they had to turn him loose cuz he had a king's word on it are you hearing me Church of the Living God he said that he said you'll not die but you will live you'll not die you'll live you'll be changed in the moment in the twinkl of an i you said well amen I know this one and they died and I know this one and they died amen that's where we see difference because I believe that a Christian can never die I believe that a Christian can change dimensions a Christian you can bury them amen but brother let me let me tell you something there is a word that goes into the grave of a Christian and you'll never hold them Christians there death's got to get out of the way we got God's word on it in Titus the first chapter the second verse in Hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promis before the world began in 1 Peter 1:25 I I'd like to done a circle on this this one in my study but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you this is the thing whereby the gospel is preached unto you the word that endureth forever think of this and this this in Revelations three sums it up and unto the angel of the Church of to see a right these things saith the amen the faithful and true Witness the beginning of the creation of God BL to see a church age book brother B goes very much through this point but he says that he is the god of the amen he goes book to the back to the book of Isaiah and said he's the god of Truth and brother B said that's not a good a good hold on that scripture he said the better way of saying it he's the god of the amen he's the soate to the word of God he's the one that said it he's the one that'll amen it are you amen I I I'll tell you this I know there's a lot of good Ministries and a lot of good preachers but I only know one of them that can stand up in the platform amen and give you the thoughts and patterns out of the scripture and when he got done he would say now if I'm telling you the truth then the one that wrote it will come here right now and God it was one thing brother Chris I said amen and you said amen amen but the beauty of it is is in William brandom's meetings God said amen God would come right down in there and say amen he would back up those word are you hearing me and I believe today I believe if a man's going to preach this same message that the same God of the amen is alive today the same as he ever was I don't believe that we just had to have a bunch of dry intellectual sermons I don't believe we have to just be a Creed and dogma and a teaching and a Doctrine I believe that the god that wrote this Bible and come into the house of God and back up this Bible with an inspiration and a power I don't have to explain to those young people why you can't experience God I don't have to explain to y'all that God changed since I was saved but I believe that the same God that saved me will give you a Salvation will give you the Holy Ghost the same God Amen that brought light into my soul is still as much light right now as he's ever been oh if we could just get out of the way if we could just get out of God's way what could God actually do he's still Amen in sermons and brother brandom actually said before a man come to the pull pit he ought to meet the pillar of fire on the back side of the desert cuz he is faithful he is the god of the amen he is the truth you know it's a beautiful thing brother bam says these words I think they're powerful he is true to himself he won't lie concerning this scripture brother R said this the faithful and true witness he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to his word he will back it up and he is true to us he will lose none of us my he's a true God he's true to himself he's true to his word and he's true to you amen it's a positive it's a certain amen do you know the prophet uses Philippians to say this be confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work will perform it under the day of Jesus Christ be confident let me just let me just interchange the word I'm preaching this morning be positive be sure be confident that the god that began it he's able to finish it God is not a beginner and not a finisher but our God is a finisher when I think about this this just this just strikes me when you hear a prophet say things uh that that are so clear in how he says them in certain sound he says or in uncertain sound he says it this way it's not an uncertain sound God cannot give an uncertain sound amen God cannot give an uncertain sound amen now some people are uncertain now does that now you have to ask yourself is that God or is that your training is it God or is it training amen we find out that God cannot utter an uncertain sound brother BR said Creeds have an uncertain sound yeah denominations can preach an uncertain sound but God cannot utter an uncertain sound this is the word of God and it's no uncertainty about it it's certain 1 Corinthians 14 if the trumpet would give an uncertain sound who could prepare for the battle in other words Paul is took this to the military in Ephesians Paul said you got to dress up as a warrior put on the whole armor do you see Paul is relating your life as a Christian as to a soldier in an army he's letting you know this you not come to a picnic now he's letting you know this is not a picnic this isn't a this isn't playground that this is an actual battle now you can have peace times in the middle of battles it's like when you're in base camp or when you're in training camp amen and you almost forget there's a battle going on because God's given you a time of training and then you get back in the battle amen but don't waste your moments of training thinking amen that everything's going to remain that way because there's coming a battle very quickly and he's just preparing you for what's coming ahead to that you're going to have to face now Paul is speaking of this and he's saying brother B says it's the scriptures like training a soldier to a sound that's what God is doing he's training you to a sound and it's the sound of a trumpet now of course we know that he's talking about a gospel trumpet amen he's talking about a gospel trumpet you know that's the sound that that John heard Amen in in Revelation chapter one when he was caught up he said I Heard a Voice as it was the sound of a trumpet it was clear and distinct other words a voice a sound of a trumpet something that was clear and distinct and brother R says what is it it's a trumpet it's a gospel trumpet and what is the gospel trumpet for it's for a person it's for Gatherings it's for war and in this case amen the trumpets that we have heard amen are a gospel Trumpet Of course there's a trumpet that sounds to Israel which is for a political disturbance but the trumpet that sounds in the church is for a spiritual disturbance isn't that beautiful God sounds a trumpet for a spiritual for a spiritual disturbance and we actually sometimes think well all hell is against us but we've kind of sometimes if we're not careful we forget really which direction this is going because actually the message of the hour has declared war against Satan the prophet of God said there has been a battle of Truth down Through the Ages he said where every messenger represented a trumpet like Paul all all the way to the to the messenger of Malachi 4 they each one have a trumpet and they sound as a partial amen throughout them ages amen but brother R says see but because in the Battle of Truth things are lost in that battle he said but when it comes to that seventh trumpet he said he's going to blow that trumpet and declare war on every lie the devil has told amen can you imagine the message has declared war on every false Doctrine in every scripture amen do you recognize why the dark is getting so dark do you know do you really know why because light is pressing on it amen it wouldn't be that dark If the message hadn't come but the message is the light that has pressed Darkness into the corner amen it is it is caused it to press itself together and it's caused a unity in the darkness amen but there is also a unity in the light amen and this gospel trumpet begins to sound and amen I'm I'm just going to preach to you a minute but I'll say this amen there're soldiers being trained now amen for this greatest battle that's ever been fought amen that's the battle we're in isn't it beautiful when you take them seven Messengers and you see a trumpet per age amen and how they sounded but do you know when it comes to that seventh one do you know that he doesn't just sound one trumpet but all trumpets sound under that one message that all the Thunders will sound under that one voice it's one voice but it's seven Thunders it's one trumpet but it's seven trumpets it's seven Messengers he's collect ing the truth amen from the time of Paul all the way to the day we're living that's why amen I don't know how many of you know but amen they're actually claiming brother brandham has taken Lin and he's trying to plagiarize Lin but you know that's such a lie from the devil amen as if as if Lin had all of his things from inspiration and it was this great prophet brother man trying to copy him amen Lin received his things from men before him from from they took things from Paul and irus he took things from Martin and and you can see exact phrases that Lin took from other theologians in his time and he laid those things out but he couldn't come to conclusions he couldn't make conclusions on certain things because he wasn't positive he wasn't certain of what it was going to be amen but when a messenger come he had a trumpet of God and he would have a certain sound and it would settle it for the bride of Christ you see amen William brandom took everything lck and said and and put it in a little jar and said it in a couple sermons but he went on to say things that Lin had never understood at the world had never understood but he didn't just say them he said it with a trumpet of a certainty that declared war on every ungodly thing oh come on Church of the Living God there's times you got to declare war there's times that the enemy has possessions of yours and he's put them behind walled cities amen and as long as you're a peace with it as long as you don't get bothered by it the devil will hold them as long as you can let them be held amen but you know that a trumpet also sounds for Jubilee it also sounds for Jubilee so the seven trumpets were war and they were also Jubilee but do you know in the Jubilee a person behind a wall City couldn't come out in Jubilee they couldn't come out amen but do you know there was a little girl named RAB that was in the city of Jericho amen and she belonged to God and she belonged to God before the world began she represented this bride that was caught behind the walls of denomination and hoard them amen that that her parentage had put her in but when God met the the very King of Kings amen when Joshua met the captain of the host the orderer amen the great one that could order everything that could sound a trumpet of of complete Victory he told Joshua you take the Army amen and you put them in order and you March around the walls of Jericho do you know they marched seven days in silence do you know they marched seven days in silence every day amen they marched every day and the only thing they do is they blow a trumpet amen they would March and they would blow a but there was silence they wasn't able to do anything amen but in that seventh day it was to March seven times and they marched and when they marched seven trumpets begin to blow and when the trumpets sounded seven consecutive sounds there was a voice that come into the bride and she be to shout and when she begin to shout the walls begin to come down listen these trumpets have unified a voice in The Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says with one voice they begin to Rejoice they begin to shout and the walls begin to come down do you see what it is if Raab if you're caught behind the wall God don't have to get you out from behind the wall God can tear the wall down he's a god amen that'll keep his word there was a promise that had been given amen those Messengers had give a promise and it was a certain promise when this City's destroyed you and your family will be saved and when God knocked down those walls those trumpets led the children of Israel and they brought in a gentile woman let me tell you this amen there's a spiritual trumpet to the Church of the Living God but we call them seals and under the seventh seal God revealed the mysteries of the entire Bible that gave the bride a certainty on serpent seed a certainty on water baptism a certainty on the godhead we are not a confused people that's why I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is a clear sounding positive gospel you might think I'm crazy but I'm not ashamed amen I am confident that the message of William brandom is the sound of the trumpet of God that is prepared the bride to give her a voice and you know what I think it's time I think it's time to declare war on every wall upon every disease upon every denomination we ought to declare war this morning and say Satan amen you've held it for your last day you've held it for your last time I'm talking about something positive tell you why people aren't positive because they ain't sure they ain't confident they're ashamed because they don't know but there should be no excuse of a bride not knowing this morning now a soldier trained to a sound a positive sound a clear and distinct sound now the trumpet the word of God the Living God is the trumpet don't mix nothing with it he says now listen the thing is is that when you start training people to a sound that is actually what's been going on with with with with your lives for the last years now from the message you you Pastor come up here and take a few things and he'll say now we're going to read this and what he's doing is he's putting something in you that is a training that whenever you hear the gospel you'll know what it means when somebody reads the scripture you'll know what it means you you're you you got to you're you're being trained you're not miss being trained to a teaching you're trained to a sound and it's a distinct clear this is the word of God now you're being trained now watch and and in training sometimes you wonder if things are necessary brother Bram pulls this out and in trumpet uncertain sound he talks about the soldiers being trained in the military and he said they have them out there stat side he said they have a 90 lb sack on their back a metal helmet on their head and a gun in their hand combat boots on and they're running down the road 10 mile or whatever he said and they're all looking at each other going why is this necessary anybody shooting at us they know why is this necessary see and and and the prophet of God said that's the devil's job is to reason the word like the word says you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Devil comes to say is that really necessary is it really the prophet of God said see if the government is going to issue not one thing unless they know you're going to have to use it you must train for that they find the best thing they can to protect you because they're interested in the nation you see that they're interested in the nation so they're trying to get you to survive because they're interested in the Kingdom now the prophet says this and Satan then comes around with a reason power and Satan know the loophole that was a place to get the people to break down the easiest was at reasoning so they don't they don't say that it's not there they just say Let Me Reason with you is it actually necessary if God said it it's necessary whether we have to he said whether we have to cry and boohoo and do all these things listen is it necessary to come to an altar and cry and boohoo and pray and shout and rejoice and sing is it necessary brother R says it like this he says whether we have to cry or boohoo or do all this he said if God said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is necessary I don't care how heavy it is or how much the world you have to give up you're going to have to use it one of these days to stay alive it's the only way of your survival it's amazing to me people today are actually asking those questions is it necessary is it necessary to have these meetings where people are getting in and the power of God and and and and I know there's a lot of names been placed on it Pentecostalism and and and and a bunch of bunch of Pentecostals and it's like it's a bad name these days I don't understand but anyhow that it that it stole this black name to it like it's a shame amen but but what they're actually saying is the way they're acting is not necessary but a prophet is saying if God sent it it don't matter how heavy it is you need to pack it because you're going to need it for survival now watch this and brother Bram he shows the contrast between the modern church and the church at Pentecost that come out of the upper room he said when these Brethren came out of Pentecost up there they were convinced now this is in a message convinced and concern see the pattern they were convinced he says and they were convinced that he was all they needed and they were convinced that's all the people needed he said and I'm convinced of the same thing so some people are wondering if it's necessary but brother brandom said the disciples said it's not only necessary it's the only thing necessary you can throw off everything you got but don't throw off that Holy Ghost it's the only thing necessary that brother B said they thought it I think it I believe it's the way it ought to be hey he and let me just say it like this let me add my voice to the prophets I know a lot of people say well it's in the message we don't have to preach it amen but I'll say it like this oh god brother R am I am I okay amen I I just say it like this I have to just be honest I think we got some cowards raising up in this message they want to stand behind the tape recorder and push it and run off somewhere amen they want to push it and talk about something they want to push play and run off and let the prophet say it and they don't want to stand with it amen but if if a prophet said it I'm ready to stand with you you can shoot me full of holes you can take off my head you can tire and feather me but let my voice stand with his voice let it Circle up in heaven today I believe this message is the truth I believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a necessary thing before you can ever be saved I don't believe you can learn Doctrine and be saved I don't believe you can agree with me and be saved I believe you've got to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a positive proof of the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ my I believe you got to remain on the word of God I believe you got to stay there on it amen it ain't changing it's not variable it's not going away if God said he gives the Holy Ghost and you don't got it yet stay on the word of God it don't matter amen stay right there if it takes you 5 years 10 years if it takes you 5 minutes or 10 minutes the Holy Ghost already came 2,000 years ago amen the only thing you're looking for is stand on the word until you receive the experience that God gave it and the reason you don't hear many men preach it is because they' never been there and they don't they're not confident that God will show up amen but I was there the night that God came to that Altar and gave me a Divine experience so I can assure you every young person in this building if you wrestle with the angel of God there is a God that can touch back as a God Amen that can give you the Holy Ghost I know they they try to talk me out of telling my my testimony in Europe they said don't tell that testimony we'll have kids trying to get an experience I said praise God let's tell it everywhere then let's tell it everywhere at the pillar of fire can show up visible in a church and fill you with the Holy Ghost I don't know if that's how he'll do it but he will I don't know how he will do it but the Bible said if you repent and are baptized in the name ofes Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive a gift of the Holy Ghost that ain't something to laugh at that ain't something to ridicule and talk about and to bad mouth that is the necessary experience before a man can go in the Rapture and I declare war on every devil and every reasoning spirit that says it's not necessary in the hour We're living I say Amen that unless we're going to preach what Paul preached amen but Paul said it if I or an angel come and say any other thing let him be cursed well I don't know if the Holy Ghost is for today that's not God I don't know if you can get them kind of experiences now I I tell you back in the day that ain't that that's not God no sir not my God you want to we need a positive example I I love positive influences and Jesus is the greatest example I know and he even said I do these things as an example for you brother BR said what did he do he said when the devil come to him in his power the devil was in his height and Jesus was in his weakness he come and tempted him on the on the scripture and Jesus right backed right up to the word and he said it is written look what he done he come back to a certain he didn't stand out there and argue with that devil he come right back on the word and said it is written and he stood right there on it is written and while he was standing on it is written look the prophet of God said see that's the thing that's certain is the promise you got to keep going back to the promise you don't go back to well I think this or I feel like it could be this way or I don't know why this ain't happening you got to go back to the promise that's the example that God showed us listen if God already said it brother B said it like this how can these things happen happen see how can we get a watch what he's going to say how can this happen how can we get a bunch of people together with a Rapture and Grace to go up he said I don't know but he's going to do it now that's a prophet I don't know but he going to do it now if we're not careful we'll try to sound smart and explain that how he's going to do it brother BR said oh I don't know how you do it but he'll do it it's just simple it's just certain he was certain he was going to do it listen this anointing of Elijah this Elijah spirit amen was actually an example now I want you to notice in the time of judgment that God told Elijah he said you go down to the brook sherith for I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there and brother R picks this up and he says Elijah I might send some Ravens he said see he said no I will do it he said so it's all already done he said see it's not a it's not I'm going to try or H uh he said it's already done he said now that's our God he's already done it he's already done it he will he might probably he will he's already done it see I have commanded the Ravens to feed you there now look at this he he immediately takes that to the scripture and said and God has commanded his spirit and his Blessing to the church so he's actually commanded it towards you not just like Elijah I I command the Ravens to feij you he said he has commanded his spirit and his Blessing to the church that's why it says that he has commanded brother B said this is unto your children and your children he said see the trumpet has done sounded I believe it you see he's saying when the word said it it was a trumpet sounding and God can't pull that back so he's got to bless somebody he's got to commend somebody he's got to bring life to somebody in Acts chapter 2 amen it it is Peter who says that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and this is a promise now in Mark 16 watch the trumpet after he appeared on the leaven after he appeared unto the leaven as they sat and ate meat and he abraded them with their unbelief and the hardness of heart because they believed not which he had seen after him after he had risen in other words he was getting on to him because they wouldn't believe in the testimony of the ones that had saw him amen and he was telling them this but now look he appeared to them in a positive body now now the body he appeared to them had died had been buried and had been resurrected it had already went to the father and come back again and this was what was talking to him them men were hearing from a positive source and he was telling them amen he said unto them go in the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth is baptized but he that believeth shall be damned he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe for in my name they shall cast out Devils what that wording they shall they shall cast out devils not a hope so maybe so they shall speak with new tongues right now today somebody speaks in tongues somehow that that that's some kind of major crime I I I I I I don't figure this out the Bible said they shall speak with tongues but now if you speak with tongues somebody your label is a Pentecostal and oh he's just after the gifts what maybe he's after the [Applause] giver and The Giver gets so real now I I y'all got to forgive me I read the message there I read it a lot and I read what William brandom said that in the upper room when the quickening power come rise and son just in case you wonderers 1965 he said it didn't only Quicken their soul he said it also quickened their bodies and that's why they shouted and danced and run in the street and become drunk he said it quickened their language and they had a Heavenly language it wasn't something to ridicule and talk about and fuss about it was a Heavenly language are you hearing me Jesus himself spoke for tongues on the cross well glory amen I thought somebody like that amen do you see what it is they shall speak with tongues they shall cast out Devils does he do it I've seen him do it does he heal the sick he said they shall recover I've seen him do it I've seen God with my own eyes heal the sick raise the dead I've seen people speak with tongues and prophesy I've seen the power of God come upon them listen I want you to know I'm certain I'm positive that he'll do it again now this this sound of this trumpet goes out and brother BR says the thing is a lot of people hear it he said but my sheep know my voice look at that word know my sheep are not uncertain about this my sheep the Sheep of God are not uncertain concerning this matter they know my voice they know amen they know my word brother B actually says it a voice a trumpet a word word a certain sound he said my sheep actually know it he said look at them disciples when they come down they sing that word manifesting in Jesus he said they know that was sheep food he they know that was the trumpet so sheep food and trumpet are now the same thing they know that was sheep food they know it was certain he said my sheep no amen they seen the word of God being manifested when they seen the word living in someone they didn't question what was happening in them they were certain that was the promise of God coming into that individual isn't it beautiful he tries a trumpet and he said my sheep know my voice the sound of the trumpet because it's the Bible see now in the end of the paragraph he'll say it like this real sheep listen for that they listen for that positive the the Sheep of God listen for that positive see now years ago when I first come on the field uh the Lord actually I don't know I don't want to say it wrong but I I God actually commissioned me years back it it and and I was preach the gospel but when I was first went into the Evangelical world and preaching uh I I I didn't feel like just a regular evangelist the way brother Bram said things about how they should preach and what so I I didn't I didn't understand because my Ministry was a little bit different than the other brothers I was hearing and I was thinking I was I was thinking well maybe I'm just out of place or I was all you know and so you know how you do in the young Ministry you stagger a little bit you go this way and you and so I was kind of curious and questioning and one day I was listening to uh the Bible there and and The Book of John and after the resurrection when Jesus comes to Peter and he says to him do you love me remember he's about three failures he says do you love me and Peter said yes Lord he said Do You Love Me He said Yes Lord he said do you love me and third time he said thou knowest and and when he said it three times I thought Lord I'm a whole lot about my brother Peter I feel like I failed you a couple two or three times myself amen but the the next thing he said was if you love me feed my sheep if you love me Fe feed my sheep and and and and it was like a it was like something come on me amen that then I understood I didn't care what you call me or what put what kind of tag you put on me I knew that I was actually asked of the Lord to take the message and feed the sheep of God and so all over this place in different countries and everything I was preaching this message and I and I found out why I found out the thing that I was supposed to be feeding the prophet of God said this he said the food that they're looking for is life life a real sheep is looking for life and that's the only thing that has life Jesus said my words they are life I am the way I am the truth and I am the life do you see what the Sheep food is it's not just intellectual educated he never said if you love me educate my people he said if you love me feed my sheep and what is sheep food it's the word of God manifested watch when Peter come out of the upper room it was him he had told to and when Peter come out of the upper room he looked in the Book of Joel and he said this is that that Joel prophesied there was no question there was no maybe so but what you're seeing is the thing that Joel prophesied and he fed them that experience by the scripture I'll tell you this it's a powerful thing that I believe that we ought to feed on the gospel I believe that's what happened in the Book of Romans amen when he spoke of Paul Paul spoke of Abraham and he said that Abraham never even staggered at the promise he never even staggered but he was fully persuaded positive confident he was fully persuaded amen I I hope I didn't throw you off with that comment about feeding my sheep but but you get my point amen we're we're here to preach life we're here to preach the life of this message amen listen he persuaded him and and brother B said see Abraham was persuaded and wasn't ashamed to testify at a 100y old he was going to have a baby because he was positive the trumpet had sounded he was sure that that was going to happen listen now I think the thing today is that we need to be persuaded beyond the place of Doubt beyond our fears beyond our understandings we need a persuasion from the holy ghost that that thing is so true that we put our lives upon it brother BR said I'm persuaded are you persuaded amen that's the thing are you fully persuaded this morning that there is nothing else of Salvation or life amen outside of Jesus Christ manifested I'll tell you this are you persuaded brother Bram said are you persuaded that this is the Holy Ghost are you persuaded this is the way are you persuaded he's a Healer are you persuaded he's coming again are you persuaded he's the same yesterday today and forever if it's him it'll be positive listen if it's him dealing with you this will be positive Jesus said I'll tell you how the Holy Spirit works I I found it was powerful uh Thursday night brother brother U Ronnie was ministering he hit this particular quote and I tell you what I thought I'd do a backflip because that's I mean I literally had it in notes and was studying it and looking all over it and amen but trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother Bram said Jesus when he was on the Earth was standing at the grave of Lazarus and he said listen he was a discourse with the people of talking about how he yet being not 50 years old said that he had seen Abraham and he said you notice how positive he was before Abraham was I am not I was or I will be but I am I'm positive then he said at the grave of Laz before he went down there he told Martha I am the resurrection and the life I ought to be not I ought to be or I will be but I am you see what he was saying not somebody like but I am the resurrection listen he was so solid of that that later look what he said there's there was nothing wavering about it there was nothing uncertain it was a positive I am the resurrection and life now whosoever look what look at how much he knew this whosoever that liveth and believeth in me shall never die that not might not that that might not they perhaps want that nothing uncertain about it they won't die he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has passed from Death unto life they should not come to the Judgment he says watch now they won't come to the judgment he took my judgment and I ain't got no business there he passed from Death unto life in trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother BR said watch he said you destroy this temple in three days I will raise it up again there was nothing uncertain he know he was a person in the scripture that David spoke of he actually knew that David was talking about him when he said you can put my soul but my flesh shall Rest In Hope for I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption neither his soul in Hell amen and David actually had prophesied of him and brother Ram says it like this he knew he was included in a scriptural promise therefore he was positive amen now now it's amazing because you think well that was Jesus but then brother Bram stops and includes Us by saying can't we be that positive can't you and I be a as positive as Jesus was when he said put me in the grave and three days I'll rise it up again look if Jesus was that positive because he knew he was included in the promise brother Bram said can't we be that positive can't we take him for our example amen we take him for others as long as God's word said it we can be a positive about the word as he was about it amen I am the resurrection and the life and I will raise again that was his portion but our portion is if I'm the person over there in John 5:24 faily verely you know what that word means absolutely absolutely positively positively that's powerful ain't it John 5:24 positive positive I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath passed hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is pass from Death unto life amen you can take John 5 and say positive positive amen I have already pass from Death unto life because I have took I have took the word of God Amen there's things that you can actually know now I want I want to just in closing say this to you there is things that you can actually be positive about you can know this beforehand and I thought about this last night and I thought dear Lord amen to be that positive of what's going to happen in the future with my life with with everything that I am but do you know that the scripture is written that job in the 19th Chapter even without reading scripture caught a revelation and said that my words were written that they would be printed in a book he said that they would be Graven with an iron pin and lead and rock forever that's how certain he was about what he was saying take a pen and write this in the stone I'm certain about what I'm saying he says listen I know my redeemer liveth what was that man so certain about he was certain that the Redeemer was alive job says I know well what do you really know job I know he is alive I know my redeemer is living listen I tell you something this morning amen he knew he was alive and he knew though the skin worms would eat his body he knew in his flesh he was going to see God he knew that you couldn't keep him in the grave he knew that there was nothing that would keep him from rising up and he would say I know my redeemer liveth brother Bram said it like this I like those positive words he spoke amen some people don't think that it's a it's a good thing to speak positive I know I'm coming up I know God's going to raise me up brother B said I like that positive I think Christianity is positive I don't think there's any negative inage amen if somebody's going in the Rapture and they're going to go from this church I believe it's me I think you ought to be positive I don't mind if you go to but I believe I'm going I believe I'm going to be a part and people say well the rapture's already over no it's not I'm still here how could the Rapture go if I'm here amen because I'm positive ser and amen I might not know all my math or all my arithmetic I may not understand all the science and all the ballistics of my gun but I'll tell you one thing I know I know that Jesus rose up on the third day and I know he's alive this morning I know the power of that Resurrection has come back in the Church of the Living God to manifest his power and I'm certain I am certain that God has G us a promise now I want you to know this morning I believe you can be I can be I believe you can be just as certain as Jesus was certain you preacher how in the world can you be that certain because he said when I see the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you now it takes you all the way back into the token in The Exodus 12th chapter it takes you back there under a Moses Ministry when Moses took the blood of the lamb and said now the judgments are coming but if you put this Blood over your doors when the death angel comes you and your house will be saved now that Daddy was positive sure that that man speaking was God's deliverer he was God's mouth peace Brother BR tells a story how even a little boy would come come and pull on his daddy's shirt or his leg and he'd say Daddy the death Angel's coming tonight are you positive are you positive that what you're putting there is the sound of the trumpet are you positive what's out there isn't just something you guys come up with come on are you positive daddy brother B said that little boy ask his daddy are you positive come on certain my life is hanging in the balance dad are you certain what you're doing has got me under the token and brother Braham said see by Moses offering the blood of a lamb on the door he said he put it visible where that the angel could see it when he was passing by the angel didn't even have to go in the house he just saw the blood now brother Bram says but watch now because it was the death of a lamb you you could not be any more positive that a lamb died than having the blood of that lamb on your door the most positive thing that you could do to prove the death of the Lamb was to display the blood of his life it was the greatest proof you could have is you could point at the blood that little boy could point and he his daddy could say right there son is our evening sacrifice and that's the requirement that God has given us a prophet do you know the prophet of God said see but today that the blood that was on that door was only representing the blood of God's only begotten son amen and today we're not taking the chemical of that blood and putting in our homes we're not putting it up on our churches he said but we're taking the life that was released in that blood the life that when it struck the Earth it it it destroyed the backbone of sin and death and Every curse and every disease do you see what it was when Jesus when Jesus let that blood one drop of that blood touch the Earth do you know what Jesus could say as he lifted up his hands he could actually say it's actually finished he could say it it's finished and I tell you what what a powerful thing to say Amen to stay it distinctly and clear and without argument and without reason and without discussion amen it's a positive statement it is finished amen because the blood was what had settled the matter amen and the prophet of God said and we could take that blood this morning amen and what can we do we take the life of the blood which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't you ever let somebody talk you out of it don't ever let nobody talk you out of the Holy Ghost it is the life of the blood and when it comes upon you it is a positive token that you have been saved that you have been secured that you have been assured let the death angel pass amen but I've got the token applied let the death angel come but I'm positive this morning I've got a blood over my house I've got a token over my family we've got a token over the church oh when I heard Brother Ray cry out the names of people the other day he said I claim them I said that's right that's a token that's in effect that token is in effect listen to me it's a positive sure thing that the blood amen of Jesus dropped on the ground how do you know the blood's there I got the life how do you know the blood's there I got the life of the blood I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it makes me act funny sometimes it makes me talk funny sometimes but it keeps me secure all the time I'm not up one day and down the other I'm not lost one day and saved another if you ever been saved amen time and etern eternity and all the Devils of Hell cannot change it I'm talking about something positive Oh Glory I'm talking about something positive now don't let the devil get a blessing don't you let that devil steal your blessing amen you ignore every devil and you say God Amen I'm secure this morning amen I've got the Holy Ghost I got the power of God in my life if you can't press through it what are you going to what else is going to stop you if you can't press through a little noise what's going to stop you if you can't press through a little problem what's going to stop you are you hearing me church sometimes you got to press through you got to break over every devil in hell has raised up its head and said I don't want you to get this blessing I don't want you to get this blessing but it's already commanded to you God has already sent it to you he's already sent the promise of God upon the Church of the Living God it don't matter what the devil does or how many dust storms or how many trials or how many promises I tell you what the devil don't want it don't want me preaching like this but I'm not going to stop I'm not going to back off I'm not going to settle down I'm not going to back up and say well maybe it'll change it no sir amen that's everything the devil wants brother Robert That Old Devil tried to silence you and you laid over in that hospital and he tried to silence you but God said I'm certain I got more for brother Robert amen and here he sets this morning as a positive SCE that there's a Healer in the house of God Amen what about Joe Lions amen there's a Healer in the house of God what about it brother David there's a Healer in the house of God hey I still believe in the healing and saving and atoning power of Jesus Christ I still believe in enough joy to dance in the spirit I still believe in enough joy to break into other languages and prophesy and see the power of God Amen I don't believe this message took anything from God I believe it put it in line and it put it back in the church where Devils canot get a hold of it are you positive are you positive you got the Holy Ghost are you sure you got the Holy Ghost Ah that's God's way to make you positive well Chuck God could heal a broken spirit God can cuss the spirit of depression and raise a man back up if you don't quit you win is that right if you don't quit you win church if you don't quit you're going to win if you don't give up you're going to make it if you don't just say it's too hard amen you're going to step from one dimension to another and there's a Grace here this morning what you need is in the building you you ain't got to go to some school to get it you ain't got to go to some special minister to get it the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been loosed in the church glory be to God is that sharing sprs back there you're not supposed to be here you're supposed to be in the hospital with some kind of heart problems that's what they said Thursday amen but the power of prayer is still the greatest weapon on the face of the Earth and that's why you're sitting here this morning because somebody got down and be to pray amen oh come on church I'm positive Prayer Changes Things I'm positive that God has some things to [Music] do still real got the musicians come it's still real it's still the power of God it's still true truth it ain't changing it's not variable it's not moving out and leaving us brother R raay
