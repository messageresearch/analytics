[10:16] spirit, make me also dawn.
[10:22] Oh gracious
[10:28] Jesus, Lord of

[12:09] And then your
[12:11] life will never
[12:15] be the
[12:18] same. Never be the
[12:21] same. And there's
[12:25] only one
[12:28] way to touch
[12:31] him. Just believe.
[12:36] Oh, when you
[12:40] call
[12:41] on his
[12:48] name,
[12:51] Jesus is
[12:53] all that really matters.
[12:58] Then your
[12:59] life and then your life will
[13:05] never
[13:09] Hallelujah. Thank God for his touch.
[13:12] There is only there is
[13:15] only
[13:18] oh one way to touch him.
[13:28] Just
[13:30] [Music]
[13:33] believe his
[13:37] name. Let's stand this morning. Go to
[13:40] the Lord in prayer. Brother Joel Strike
[13:42] says, "I want to thank the Lord for
[13:43] touching my left knee again last night
[13:46] in the prayer line. Seems like I had
[13:48] injured it at work several weeks ago and
[13:51] I had been to the chiropractor to adjust
[13:54] it, but it was hurting every day. And at
[13:56] the beginning of service, it was
[13:58] hurting. But at the end when we were
[14:01] singing, the love of Jesus is so
[14:03] wonderful. I was able to jump up and
[14:05] down without any pain. I can't remember
[14:07] the last time I have been able to jump
[14:09] without pain. Hallelujah. The love of
[14:12] Jesus is so wonderful. It wasn't even
[14:15] thinking about my need in the prayer
[14:16] line, but he touched me anyways. So, I
[14:20] know he cares about he cares
[14:23] about the uh the things I was praying
[14:26] about. So, we thank the Lord for
[14:29] touching our brother. Amen.
[14:32] Amen. It's wonderful to be painfree.
[14:35] Amen. Praise the Lord for that. Thank
[14:39] God for his touch and for all the many
[14:41] healings and miracles last night. Our
[14:44] God is so wonderful. Amen. And we're
[14:46] we're still thanking and praising him
[14:48] this morning.
[14:49] Amen.
[14:51] Amen. I've lost some good friends. A
[14:56] long life's
[14:59] way. Some loved ones
[15:03] departed in heaven to stay. But thank
[15:08] God I didn't lose
[15:13] [Music]
[15:16] everything. I've
[15:18] lost
[15:19] people who said that. You sing it who
[15:23] know it. In the time of
[15:27] they were
[15:30] never there.
[15:33] But in my
[15:35] [Music]
[15:36] disappointment, in my season of
[15:41] pain, one thing never
[15:45] wavered, one thing never
[15:51] changed. Oh, let's sing it now. Oh, I
[15:55] never lost my
[15:58] whole glory.
[16:01] I never
[16:05] [Music]
[16:09] lost. Oh, I never lost my
[16:15] faith. But most of
[16:19] all, I never lost my
[16:26] way. Glory.
[16:29] Oh yes, I'll let some
[16:34] blessings slip
[16:38] away. I lost my
[16:42] focus and went
[16:46] astray. Thank God I didn't lose
[16:51] everything.
[16:55] Oh, I lost
[16:58] possession at
[17:02] work. Oh yes, Lord. And I've lost some
[17:08] battles by walking in fear.
[17:13] But in the midst of my
[17:16] struggles, in my season of
[17:21] pain, one thing never
[17:25] wavered. One thing never
[17:29] [Applause]
[17:32] changed. I never lost. Oh, I never lost
[17:38] [Applause]
[17:39] my glory.
[17:43] Yes, I never lost my
[17:51] joy. I never lost
[17:56] my but most of
[18:00] all I never lost my
[18:06] friend. S again. Oh, I never lost my
[18:16] [Applause]
[18:21] [Music]

[20:30] praise.
[20:32] Hallelujah. Amen.
[20:35] Hallelujah. I need this in prayer this
[20:37] morning.
[20:43] Uh for anyone that's in town visiting
[20:46] for the youth, there's going to be a
[20:47] youth fellowship this afternoon at the
[20:48] Mcnalty home. So you're invited there.
[20:51] Lunch will be served and any of your
[20:53] family traveling with you, but focused
[20:55] on the youth there. So God bless you.
[20:57] Let's go to the Lord in prayer this
[20:58] morning. How many happy to be in the
[21:00] house of the Lord? Amen. Heavenly
[21:02] Father, Lord, we just want to come
[21:03] before you, Lord, with thanksgiving in
[21:06] our hearts today, Lord, just for the
[21:08] work that you've done among us this
[21:10] weekend, Father, for the for the praise,
[21:12] Lord, the joy, and Lord, the atmosphere
[21:15] of worship, Lord. And I just feel, Lord,
[21:18] that we've had a wonderful time, Lord,
[21:21] as a church family, Lord, and Lord, to
[21:24] our family, Lord, that maybe doesn't
[21:25] attend here, Lord, but are visiting here
[21:28] with us, Lord, brothers and sisters in
[21:30] Christ, Lord. We just feel so close
[21:32] together, Lord, because of what your
[21:34] spirit has wrought in this place,
[21:36] Father. And Lord, we're so excited to be
[21:38] gathered together once again, Father, to
[21:40] fellowship around this living word. And
[21:42] Lord, to just enjoy your presence,
[21:44] Father. And Lord, be in contact today
[21:47] with a living God, Lord. And and Lord,

[21:55] upon us, Lord. That your hand is upon
[21:57] our lives, Lord. And Lord, that you hold
[21:59] all that we are, Lord. And all that lays
[22:01] before us is in your hand, Lord. The
[22:03] same hand that holds us, pushes the
[22:05] enemy back before us, Father, makes a
[22:07] way, Father, for us to proceed. And
[22:09] that's what we ask for today, Lord, that
[22:11] we would just progress, Lord, as
[22:14] individuals, Lord, as a church, as the
[22:16] word is brought forth, Lord. And we
[22:18] thank you for your servant, Lord, that
[22:19] you sent our way, Lord, for Brother Ron
[22:22] and Brother Tim, Lord, our elders. And
[22:24] Lord, we just thank you for their
[22:25] ministry, Lord. And I pray this morning
[22:27] we would, Lord, that I trust we'd be
[22:29] able to make your servant welcome today,
[22:30] Father. Lord, that he could just
[22:32] deliver, Lord, the inspiration that's on
[22:34] his heart, Lord, with liberty, Father,
[22:36] and just to feel at home, Lord. And
[22:38] Lord, we we thank you for the gifts that
[22:40] you place among us, Lord. And we don't
[22:42] lift up human flesh, Lord, but we
[22:44] recognize, Lord, when you have
[22:46] established something in a man, Lord, to
[22:48] bless your people. We thank you, Father,
[22:50] for these elders, Lord, which have
[22:51] invested in us, Lord, in many ways and
[22:54] over the years, directly and indirectly,
[22:56] Lord, and and Lord, and blessed us as a
[22:58] church, Father. And we thank you for the
[23:00] kinship, Lord, that we have with them,
[23:02] Lord. We just want to we want to give
[23:04] honor where it's due, Father. Even
[23:06] double honor as we're commanded by the
[23:08] scripture, Lord Jesus. We're just so
[23:10] thankful, Father, for another moment in
[23:12] your presence, Lord. We never want to
[23:14] take it for granted, Lord. We just want
[23:16] to worship you, Father. We want to we
[23:18] want to not only invite you in our midst
[23:20] again today, Father, but we want to make
[23:21] you welcome, Lord. Uh with Lord, that
[23:24] beautiful water your prophet spoke about
[23:26] tears of repentance, Lord. We come
[23:28] before you humbly, Lord. We Lord, we
[23:30] know that we were unworthy, but by your
[23:32] blood, Father, we've been made worthy,
[23:34] Lord. And we've been made partakers of
[23:36] your divine nature, Lord. We're sharers
[23:38] of your attributes, joint hes, Lord, of
[23:40] every promise. And Lord, you've made us
[23:42] holy. You've made us accepted in the
[23:44] beloved. Father, you have put us in a
[23:46] position, Lord. And so, Lord, uh how
[23:48] could we not lift you up, Father, Lord,
[23:50] because we're in you, Father? And the
[23:52] higher that you were lifted up, the
[23:53] higher we're lifted up in you by your
[23:55] grace, Lord. And we're thankful to be
[23:57] identified with you today, Lord. And

[24:43] morning? Missions. All right. Just sing
[24:47] their special if the sisters will come
[24:49] and the brothers will come and receive
[24:50] the missions offering this morning
[24:52] during the special.
[25:31] [Music]
[25:35] All I've heard about
[25:43] Heaven makes me want to
[25:46] [Music]
[25:51] go. The more ties that I have there,
[25:57] friends and loved ones who've gone on
[26:01] makes it
[26:03] harder to be
[26:11] In a world that's
[26:13] just passing
[26:17] by with all its
[26:20] trles and
[26:22] cares that here seems so
[26:27] great when
[26:29] compared to my future home.
[26:35] There's nothing here holding
[26:43] me. I'm getting lonely for
[26:47] home. I'm so lonely for home. My eyes
[26:52] are
[26:53] aching to
[26:55] see the glory that awaits me. My
[27:01] bridegroom is
[27:04] here. Yes, he is
[27:08] here. And I know that he longs to Yes,
[27:14] he is
[27:16] longing for that
[27:19] fellowship
[27:21] we
[27:22] had before.
[27:25] In morning
[27:29] stars shouted for
[27:32] joy. I'm being called
[27:36] [Music]
[27:41] back. I'm going
[27:48] home when a saint passes on.
[27:56] How it saddens our
[28:03] hearts. For we still
[28:07] here feel the pain and the
[28:11] loss of one we have loved.
[28:20] But now
[28:22] imagine
[28:26] heaven. Oh, the shouts of
[28:30] rejoicing that one has come
[28:35] home. It was one short breath, one small
[28:41] step that took them there.
[28:49] [Music]
[28:51] There's nothing on earth that can be put
[28:56] to the
[28:58] test. No pleasure these mortal lives.
[29:04] No. do outweigh the bliss and the
[29:09] freedom of
[29:12] souls that we the redeemed will soon
[29:19] know. Getting lonely for
[29:22] home. I'm so lonely for home. My eyes
[29:27] are aching to
[29:30] see the glory that awaits me. My
[29:36] bridegroom is
[29:38] here. I feel him
[29:41] here. And I know that he longs to. Yes,
[29:47] he is
[29:49] longing for that
[29:51] fellowship
[29:53] we
[29:54] had before.
[29:57] In morning
[30:00] stars shouted for
[30:04] joy. I'm being called back.
[30:12] I'm going
[30:15] [Music]
[30:20] home for that fellowship
[30:24] we had before.
[30:28] When morning
[30:31] stars shouted for
[30:35] joy of being called
[30:38] [Music]
[30:42] back, I'm going home.
[30:51] [Applause]
[31:10] With that song this morning, we remember
[31:13] the memory of Brother Charlie and Sister
[31:15] Rachel Collins. Today's been three years
[31:17] since they passed to their heavenly
[31:19] reward to remember you, brother Chuck,
[31:22] Sister Debbie, Courtney,
[31:25] Joshua, Caleb, Abraham, their family,
[31:29] church family here. Amen. We we know our
[31:34] God
[31:35] has some something great in store when
[31:38] we can't explain with words, with tongue
[31:42] or pen, but God has purpose in it all.
[31:45] Amen.
[31:47] Praise the name of the Lord
[31:51] Jesus. I'm going
[31:58] home. I'm going
[32:01] [Music]
[32:05] soon. I'm going
[32:09] where I belong.
[32:12] [Music]
[32:22] I've always
[32:26] been. Oh
[32:29] yes, a
[32:31] stranger
[32:35] here. But
[32:38] now, but now I'm go.
[32:42] [Music]
[32:46] Oh, it won't be
[32:52] long. Oh, yeah. Somebody help me
[32:55] sing till we'll be
[32:59] leaving
[33:02] you.
[33:03] Oh, it won't be
[33:08] long. Don't be sad for them.
[33:12] Oh, will be going
[33:20] home. It won't be
[33:23] long. By the grace of
[33:26] God, they're more real than we are. And
[33:29] this
[33:30] will
[33:32] glory. Thank you,
[33:34] Lord. Just a few inches away. Oh, it
[33:39] won't be long.
[33:43] Oh god.
[34:03] [Music]
[34:11] Oh, it won't be

[34:52] months. Count the months as
[34:58] weeks. Count the years. Count the weeks
[35:03] as days.

[35:09] Oh, we'll be going
[35:15] home. We'll be
[35:18] going. We'll be going
[35:24] home. It won't be
[35:27] long till you will be

[55:23] misgrace, the elect lady. Lord, oh God,
[55:27] we thank you for your love to us, for
[55:30] all that you've done, for the healings
[55:33] that you bring, the deliverances, Lord.
[55:37] Lord, for the love that you surround us
[55:39] with. Lord, you're so good to us. I pray
[55:43] your blessings today upon us. May we
[55:47] just find the channel of the Holy
[55:49] Spirit, God, that you will just flow
[55:52] through the word and that you'll just
[55:55] use this vessel this morning as I I I
[55:58] just pray that I can be so emptied out
[56:00] that it just be God flowing, Lord,
[56:04] through me today. Lord, that you would
[56:07] bless the ears of the hearer, Lord. May
[56:09] there be hearts to receive. Speak to us
[56:12] now. We're your children. We've gathered
[56:15] in your name and here we come now to
[56:18] this last service of this series of
[56:21] meetings. And we want to thank you Lord
[56:24] for every service. We want to thank you
[56:27] Lord for the prayer line last night and
[56:29] so many that were touched in your
[56:31] presence. Lord, we want to thank you for
[56:34] using our brother Ron in such a
[56:36] miraculous way. And Lord, ministered to
[56:39] us that just lifted our faith and caused
[56:42] us to believe your promise. Lord, we
[56:45] thank you for faithful servants. Father,
[56:48] Lord, we thank you for the ministry in
[56:50] this church and for each one that
[56:53] assembles from the Lord. There's no
[56:55] little ones, but one for what one might
[56:58] think would be the least to the
[57:00] greatest. and there's no great ones
[57:02] among us. We're all one. Lord, I pray
[57:04] God today that you'll speak now as we
[57:08] surrender ourselves to you and humble
[57:11] ourselves in your presence and just say,
[57:13] "Lord, without you, we can do nothing."
[57:17] So Lord, if you'll just come and anoint
[57:19] us, Lord, we know if you'll just speak,
[57:22] it won't be just man speaking, but it'll
[57:25] be God ministering to the heart of his
[57:28] bride. We know Lord that you told us as
[57:32] a bridegroom, as a husband that we
[57:35] should show due benevolence to our wife.
[57:39] We know Lord, you couldn't command us to
[57:41] do that and you not do the same as a
[57:45] husband, as a bridegroom. So Lord, we
[57:48] know you're going to pour out your love
[57:50] upon us today. and we're going to feel
[57:53] your presence and we're going to be
[57:55] lifted up into heavenly places and we're
[57:58] going to walk in victory and your
[58:00] children Lord will
[58:02] experience the joys that is promised to
[58:06] them as the believers. We commit
[58:08] ourselves to you now in the name of
[58:11] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God bless
[58:15] you. If you'll turn with me to Genesis
[58:18] chapter 18, we'll read from the ninth
[58:21] verse. I just want to say it's just been
[58:24] a joy and a privilege to be here and we
[58:27] so thank the Lord for his goodness to us
[58:30] and I certainly appreciate the
[58:32] hospitality of your pastors here and how
[58:35] they have blessed us and and we've just
[58:37] had a wonderful time together and and
[58:40] you're such a welcoming congregation and
[58:42] and uh I said years ago when I preached
[58:45] at brother Ray's church I I went back
[58:47] home I said that church has the same
[58:50] spirit my church Yes. Amen. So, you
[58:53] know, it just it just always feels so
[58:55] welcoming and so wonderful. And seeing
[58:58] your young people just loving the Lord
[59:00] and serving him, you know, that that
[59:02] just makes my heart rejoice. I the youth
[59:06] camp you've started and and what you've
[59:09] done here and working with the young
[59:11] people. Uh those are eternal treasures.
[59:15] And and I tell you that what you place
[59:17] into
[59:18] that, you know, it will be rewarded many
[59:21] many times. Amen. Because they are the
[59:24] generation that will see the coming of
[59:26] the Lord. And I believe that God will
[59:28] have young people in this age that will
[59:30] be overcomers. And will be triumphant in
[59:34] this day. And I couldn't be more proud
[59:36] to be identified with you and be be part
[59:40] of the great elect of God. Amen. Let's
[59:43] look at Genesis 18 and verse 9. And and
[59:47] they said unto him, where is Sarah thy
[59:50] wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
[59:53] And he said, I will certainly return
[59:55] unto thee according to the time of life.
[59:57] And lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
[1:00:01] And Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:00:03] which was behind him. And now Abraham
[1:00:06] and Sarah were old and well stricken in
[1:00:09] age, and it ceased to be with Sarah
[1:00:12] after the manner of women. Therefore
[1:00:15] Sarah laughed within herself, saying,
[1:00:18] After I am waxed old, shall I have
[1:00:21] pleasure, my lord being old also? And
[1:00:25] the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore
[1:00:28] did Sarah lie? Saying, Shall I, but
[1:00:31] surely bear a child, which I'm old? Is
[1:00:35] there anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:00:38] Amen. At that time appointed, I will
[1:00:42] return unto thee according to the time
[1:00:45] of life, and Sarah shall have a son. And
[1:00:49] then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not,
[1:00:52] for she was afraid. And he said, Nay,
[1:00:56] but thou didest laugh. God bless you.
[1:00:59] You can be seated.
[1:01:04] Why? We look at so many wonderful things
[1:01:06] in the scripture and the Bible is just
[1:01:10] so full of exceeding great and precious
[1:01:14] promises. But not only are they just
[1:01:16] promises, they're actually prophetical.
[1:01:20] And when we look at the scripture, we
[1:01:22] don't look at it as just some history
[1:01:25] there or story in the Bible. That's
[1:01:27] right. But it actually is foretelling
[1:01:30] end time events. and where we are here
[1:01:33] in this end time. And you know, as we
[1:01:36] look at this um account in the Bible,
[1:01:39] Sarah laughed within her heart or within
[1:01:42] herself. And and these were these were
[1:01:45] thoughts and they were not even words.
[1:01:48] And she laughed. She actually in the
[1:01:51] Hebrew she it says that she literally
[1:01:56] scoffed or mockingly
[1:01:59] laughed. And you know, she was thinking,
[1:02:01] how ridiculous can this be? How
[1:02:05] impossible, how unlikely, you know, that
[1:02:08] this could ever happen. And her thoughts
[1:02:10] got called out by Almighty God because
[1:02:13] she was doubting right in the face of
[1:02:17] God himself.
[1:02:19] And you can imagine this, right in the
[1:02:21] face of God, she scoffs and she laughs
[1:02:24] and and she doesn't really say something
[1:02:27] out loud. It's it's a it's a something
[1:02:30] in her heart and she's doubting right in
[1:02:33] God's faith and face and God is God is a
[1:02:36] holy God and he cannot stand seeing and
[1:02:41] and um you know brother Brandham talked
[1:02:43] about God and his holiness. He said he's
[1:02:46] such a holy God that angels look black
[1:02:49] in his presence. So, you know, we we see
[1:02:53] in this standing in front of God and and
[1:02:57] he just can't stand sin and and unbelief
[1:03:00] is the root of sin. And brother Brandham
[1:03:04] tells us in sermons like Elijah in the
[1:03:06] meal offering, he said the church is
[1:03:08] going to be there without spot or
[1:03:10] wrinkle. There, in other words, there
[1:03:12] won't be one sin or doubt. You know, the
[1:03:16] grace of God, he said, will do that.
[1:03:18] It'll it'll have to it'll take grace.
[1:03:22] Like he talked to Abraham when Sarah
[1:03:25] doubted him. Well, right then he should
[1:03:27] have slain Sarah right then for doubting
[1:03:30] cuz that's the worst sin there is is
[1:03:34] unbelief. And the only sin and she
[1:03:36] doubted and she laughed within herself
[1:03:39] and the angel discerned her in the tent.
[1:03:42] He said, "Is that right? For but why
[1:03:45] couldn't he take Sarah be? because she
[1:03:48] was a part of Abraham. He would have to
[1:03:51] take Abraham, too. And we're a part of
[1:03:53] Jesus when we're a part when we're in
[1:03:56] the body of Christ. And our unbeliefs
[1:03:59] are excused if we did it ignorantly like
[1:04:01] she did for she was scared.
[1:04:04] He says again, uh, as he explains this,
[1:04:07] our sins would ruin us
[1:04:11] if we wasn't part of Christ. He can
[1:04:14] strike the church. He can't strike the
[1:04:17] church because we're Christ. Sarah and
[1:04:20] Abraham were one. And Christ and his
[1:04:22] church is one. And our sins are covered
[1:04:25] by his blood, by his faith, not ours,
[1:04:28] we're trusting in his finished work. So
[1:04:32] if it were not for grace, and let me
[1:04:35] tell you, we're going to need a lot of
[1:04:36] grace for the rapture.
[1:04:39] Amen. We're not just going to need
[1:04:41] faith. We're going to need a lot of
[1:04:43] grace for the rapture. And brother
[1:04:46] Brandon says again, "Let me give you a
[1:04:48] little grace here. I I want a little
[1:04:50] grace." Amen. I'd like a double portion
[1:04:53] of it. Could you just give me a a big
[1:04:56] heaping of it today? I need some grace.
[1:04:58] He said that minute, God would have
[1:05:01] killed Sarah for disbelieving that
[1:05:04] angel. He didn't. Look at that. Look at
[1:05:08] that angel went down and told Lot's wife
[1:05:11] not to look back and see what happened
[1:05:12] to her for her unbelief.
[1:05:14] But he couldn't take Sarah because she
[1:05:18] was a part of Abraham. And today the
[1:05:20] unbelief with the real true church. Now
[1:05:24] we're not talking about the false
[1:05:25] church. He said the unbelief with the
[1:05:28] real true church. She has unbelief. But
[1:05:31] he can't touch her. We're in Jesus. See,
[1:05:34] you can't take the church without
[1:05:37] hurting Christ. He couldn't take Sarah
[1:05:40] without hurting Abraham. So grace
[1:05:43] covered it. Oh hallelujah. Grace. Grace.
[1:05:48] God's grace. Grace that will pardon and
[1:05:52] cleanse within. Amen. God you see could
[1:05:55] not change his mind. He couldn't change
[1:05:58] his plan. I mean he had already told
[1:06:01] Abraham when he told Abraham you're
[1:06:03] going to have a child he was talking
[1:06:06] about Abra uh Sarah too because Sarah
[1:06:09] was a part of Abraham. And so he was
[1:06:11] saying Sarah is going to have a child.
[1:06:14] Amen. So God when he releases a promise,
[1:06:17] he can't go back on his word. He has to
[1:06:20] do what he said he would do. If he said,
[1:06:23] "I'll have a bride and she'll be without
[1:06:25] spot or wrinkle. I don't care what the
[1:06:28] trouble is in the age. I don't care how
[1:06:31] evil it is. I don't care how dark it
[1:06:34] gets." Amen. God's word has to come to
[1:06:37] pass. He will have a bride without spot
[1:06:41] or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing.
[1:06:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:47] And she will be a woman of faith.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah. I'm talking about you.
[1:06:55] She will be a woman of faith. Now, he
[1:06:57] asked, you know, when I come, when I
[1:07:00] come, will I find faith? You see, God
[1:07:03] says, I'm expecting faith. And let me
[1:07:05] tell you, if God's expecting faith,
[1:07:08] God's going to get what he wants. He's
[1:07:10] going to get what he expects. Amen. But
[1:07:13] it'll take the grace of God to provide
[1:07:16] the faith of God. Amen. And Sarah was
[1:07:18] still faithless. She was looking at
[1:07:21] herself. That's what we often do. We
[1:07:24] look at ourselves rather than look at
[1:07:26] God's promise. We're so prone to look at
[1:07:29] our weakness and how we can't do it and
[1:07:31] how unable we are rather than look and
[1:07:34] seeing how great our God is. Amen. So
[1:07:38] she was looking at herself instead of
[1:07:41] God. What where he said there is nothing
[1:07:45] too hard for the Lord. She was looking
[1:07:47] at her circumstances. As brother
[1:07:50] Brandham said in birth pains, he said
[1:07:52] why did Sarah life concerning this baby?
[1:07:55] Sarah come forth and said she didn't but
[1:07:58] said and he said but you did and he
[1:08:00] would have killed her right there if she
[1:08:02] wasn't a part of Abraham. So God would
[1:08:06] slay us if we wasn't part of Christ. The
[1:08:10] mercy of Christ all holds us together as
[1:08:14] doubters and perversions in the word.
[1:08:19] Amen. You got to realize if you weren't
[1:08:22] a part of his thoughts, right? If you
[1:08:25] weren't a part of his word, if you
[1:08:27] weren't a part of his thinking of his
[1:08:29] plan, but God has to fulfill his word.
[1:08:32] He cannot go back on it instead of
[1:08:35] killing us or just abandon his plan,
[1:08:38] taking somebody else. No, no. God has to
[1:08:41] get us on board. Amen. He's got to get
[1:08:45] us to believing again.
[1:08:48] Yes, sir. He can't change his mind.
[1:08:51] Amen. He can't ex you out of his list.
[1:08:54] He can't take your name off the book.
[1:08:57] Come on now. Amen. He cannot change his
[1:09:01] mind about you. Amen. Whatever his
[1:09:04] original thought was, he's got to stay
[1:09:07] with his original thought. He can't say,
[1:09:10] "You're going to be down here in
[1:09:11] Leodosia." Oh, I didn't know it would be
[1:09:14] that bad. I didn't realize they would
[1:09:16] have that kind of problem. I didn't
[1:09:18] realize they would do this and they
[1:09:21] would falter there and they would fail
[1:09:23] there. No, he can't say I'll
[1:09:30] exchange his mind.
[1:09:35] Hallelujah.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. Like he told Job, I already
[1:09:40] seen you shouting over your trial. I've
[1:09:42] seen you come out into victory. I've
[1:09:45] seen you with great joy. I've seen you.
[1:09:48] Hallelujah. A victorious church without
[1:09:50] spot or wrinkle. And you're going to be
[1:09:53] everything I said you would be.
[1:10:01] So God has to fulfill his word. Yes,
[1:10:03] sir. Instead of killing us
[1:10:07] or abandon his plan, he's got to get us
[1:10:10] on board. Yes, sir. This is what he had
[1:10:13] to do with Sarah. He had he has to get
[1:10:15] us to believe again.
[1:10:18] Amen. And for them, he had to perform
[1:10:21] signs. Had to And for us, he performed
[1:10:24] signs. He sent a message to get us to
[1:10:28] believe it again to change our thinking
[1:10:31] to turn our hearts. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:10:33] right. Amen. And you know, we as
[1:10:36] ministers have a responsibility to
[1:10:38] preach faith.
[1:10:42] Amen. And if I'm guilty of anything, I
[1:10:44] wouldn't be guilty of preaching faith.
[1:10:47] Amen. Because brother Brandon said, "If
[1:10:49] he ever was God, he's still God." So you
[1:10:52] see, it's a lack of faith that's been
[1:10:55] preached into the people that make makes
[1:10:58] to them let that sense six sense, which
[1:11:01] is faith lay dormant.
[1:11:04] Amen. Well, I tell you what, we got to
[1:11:06] preach faith. Amen. We got to have a
[1:11:08] people where that faith is not dormant
[1:11:11] in the church, but it's an active faith.
[1:11:15] Amen. And brothers, if we'll just preach
[1:11:18] the message, people will believe the
[1:11:21] supernatural.
[1:11:23] Amen. And if you believe the
[1:11:25] supernatural, it's going to start
[1:11:26] happening. Miracles will happen.
[1:11:30] Deliverance will happen. Anywhere faith
[1:11:33] is preached. And to have faith, we must
[1:11:36] have the right attitude toward the
[1:11:38] divine promise. Our thinking has to be
[1:11:41] corrected and our hearts have to be
[1:11:43] turned.
[1:11:48] You see, it's really important what we
[1:11:50] think. That's right, brother. Because
[1:11:52] this was just Sarah thinking.
[1:11:56] She didn't even say anything out loud.
[1:11:58] She said it in her heart.
[1:12:01] It's important what we think. And it's
[1:12:04] important what we say.
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:08] That's right. Proverbs 18:21 says,
[1:12:11] "Death and life are in the power of the
[1:12:13] tongue, and those who love it will eat
[1:12:16] its fruits." So if you're prone to
[1:12:19] negativity,
[1:12:22] you'll eat its fruits.
[1:12:24] Your tongue has the power to bring death
[1:12:27] or life. And if your confession will
[1:12:30] line up with God's word, come on,
[1:12:32] somebody. Instead of your problems,
[1:12:35] instead of your feelings, instead of
[1:12:37] your circumstances, Amen. then you will
[1:12:40] eat the fruit of the life and the
[1:12:42] blessings that come from the word.
[1:12:45] I'll tell you what, if I was prayed for
[1:12:47] last night, I would start right now
[1:12:49] already confessing, I am healed. I am
[1:12:52] saved. I'm delivered. My children are
[1:12:55] coming home. I'm going to be blessed.
[1:12:58] Come on.
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:02] Amen. There's got to be works with
[1:13:04] faith. Faith without works is dead.
[1:13:07] Faith cannot remain inactive. Faith has
[1:13:10] to be put into works.
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:17] You see, the Bible said in Proverbs
[1:13:19] 6:24, "Gracious words are like a
[1:13:21] honeycomb.
[1:13:23] Sweetness to the soul and health to the
[1:13:26] body,
[1:13:28] saying the right things, having the
[1:13:31] right attitude about the word is of
[1:13:34] vital importance. It can't be
[1:13:36] overemphasized. God's word must be
[1:13:40] believed.
[1:13:42] Amen. You see, like the old woman Sarah,
[1:13:46] she's sitting in her unbelief there.
[1:13:49] She's scuffing at the promise. Her heart
[1:13:52] had to be changed from doubting to
[1:13:55] believing.
[1:13:57] And it took the manifestations of God in
[1:13:59] the form of of a man to discern her
[1:14:03] heart and turn it from the unbelief. And
[1:14:06] it was so great of unbelief that it was
[1:14:09] actually years of
[1:14:12] accumulated unbelief
[1:14:15] that she would scoff in the very face of
[1:14:18] the all knowing God and then try to
[1:14:20] cover it up by lying.
[1:14:24] No, I'm a real believer. No, I've never
[1:14:25] doubted. No, I I've
[1:14:29] right in the face of God.
[1:14:32] You know, similarly, the old woman, the
[1:14:35] church,
[1:14:37] I don't know if you know this, Sarah's
[1:14:40] prophesying of you.
[1:14:43] Come on.
[1:14:45] Amen, brother. And the word has said,
[1:14:47] "This 2,000y old bride,
[1:14:52] no matter how old, how feeble,
[1:14:53] decryptid, and whatever, and walking
[1:14:55] around on her cane and stooped over and
[1:14:58] and bent with traditions and whatever
[1:15:00] else, she's going to bring forth the
[1:15:02] promised son.
[1:15:04] There's going to be a rapture in this
[1:15:06] hour. He's going to bring forth life in
[1:15:10] the church."
[1:15:14] Amen. Amen. So now we've been barren for
[1:15:18] 2,000 years. You know what we've been
[1:15:19] waiting on? The promised son.
[1:15:24] Amen. Waiting on the promised son. You
[1:15:27] know, every every cycle that they went
[1:15:30] through of every church they you know
[1:15:32] you we're going to get it this time. We
[1:15:35] we'll conceive this time. We'll get it
[1:15:37] this time. And finally she gets to the
[1:15:40] point of
[1:15:42] what's the use?
[1:15:46] It's not for me.
[1:15:48] She's been waiting on the promised
[1:15:51] son Jesus to return.
[1:15:54] And now she receives a visitation to
[1:15:56] turn her heart away from those years of
[1:16:00] accumulated unbelief,
[1:16:04] accumulated doubts, of misinterpreted
[1:16:07] theologies. And I believe again to back
[1:16:10] to the faith of when she was a young
[1:16:14] church so that she first in her heart
[1:16:18] must return to the bride she was at
[1:16:21] Pentecost.
[1:16:24] Amen. Can you imagine to be like the
[1:16:27] bride at Pentecost?
[1:16:29] To dance with your bridegroom
[1:16:32] again. a beautiful young vibrant church
[1:16:36] filled with the spirit. People so in
[1:16:39] love with Jesus.
[1:16:42] Amen. You know, in essence, this is what
[1:16:44] the angel said when he reaffirmed the
[1:16:47] promise of a child with Sarah. Sarah,
[1:16:50] you're going to be young again.
[1:16:52] I'm going to renew you. I'm restoring
[1:16:56] you.
[1:16:57] You know, as brother Brandon said, as it
[1:16:59] was to be the age in which the true
[1:17:01] church would return to being the bride
[1:17:03] she was at Pentecost, we know there
[1:17:05] mustn't necessity be the return of
[1:17:08] dynamic power. What? She has to be the
[1:17:11] same bride, the same kind, built out of
[1:17:15] the same kind of material that she was
[1:17:17] at the first place. Now read Malachi 4
[1:17:20] and see if we're not supposed to have a
[1:17:23] message in the last days that it will
[1:17:25] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:17:28] the fathers, back to the original
[1:17:30] Pentecostal message, word by word. And
[1:17:34] then he says, "Brothers, we are here."
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:41] Amen. Oh, Sarah, do you remember? You
[1:17:45] remember what it was like to skip like a
[1:17:47] young girl or you're a 90year-old bent
[1:17:51] over woman sitting there back in your
[1:17:54] bitterness scoffing at the promise
[1:17:57] saying it'll never happen to me. This is
[1:17:59] slow as the second coming of Christ.
[1:18:03] Scoffing. Come on, brother. Scoffing.
[1:18:08] Amen. Remember what it was though to to
[1:18:10] skip like a young girl to sport with
[1:18:13] your husband? Do you remember? Do you
[1:18:17] remember your first love? You remember
[1:18:19] what it was like when Jesus was
[1:18:21] everything? Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] Hallelujah. You're going to return to
[1:18:26] that, Sarah.
[1:18:29] Amen. Hallelujah. Remember what it was
[1:18:32] like to laugh and to rejoice like a
[1:18:35] young girl? Sarah, you're going to shout
[1:18:39] and dance again.
[1:18:42] Really? You You remember what it was
[1:18:44] like to be beautiful and desirable? Oh,
[1:18:47] you're going to be so desirable. Your
[1:18:50] bridegroom, Jesus, is coming back for
[1:18:52] you.
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] Hallelujah. You see, she's that little
[1:18:58] faith woman. Yet, she's been a doubter.
[1:19:01] Looks like God would have gave up on her
[1:19:02] a long time ago. Amen. But he can't.
[1:19:05] She's a part of him.
[1:19:09] Now, let's hear Brother Brandham
[1:19:10] describe her with prophetic eyes. And
[1:19:13] and you know, if you don't mind, I'm I I
[1:19:16] may may not quote just exactly maybe
[1:19:19] paraphrase it just a little bit, but
[1:19:21] this is from God of this evil age. The
[1:19:23] substance is there. She, the real true
[1:19:26] Christian, has revelation or faith in
[1:19:29] his word. She makes no claim of
[1:19:31] knowledge. They say, "Well, you have you
[1:19:34] got a doctor's degree." Makes no claim.
[1:19:37] I believe his word. Doesn't claim to be
[1:19:40] educated. Doesn't belong to any
[1:19:42] denomination, any party, any sect. She
[1:19:46] belongs to Christ. She's his wife, not
[1:19:49] the wife of a denomination.
[1:19:52] But in
[1:19:53] obedience, this little faith woman
[1:19:57] that lives by faith, the bride, she
[1:20:01] believes the word of God. She's obedient
[1:20:04] and watching in love for the promise of
[1:20:08] the age to be confirmed. She's watching
[1:20:10] for it. She is part of that word. And
[1:20:13] she is watching for her life to manifest
[1:20:16] that word.
[1:20:19] Amen. That's what I'm speaking on today.
[1:20:22] That little faith woman. And I'm talking
[1:20:25] about you.
[1:20:27] You may not feel like a little faith
[1:20:29] woman, but if God calls you that,
[1:20:33] that's what you are. And the word of God
[1:20:36] puts you then in position to be a people
[1:20:40] of faith.
[1:20:42] Amen. Amen. The word of the angel put
[1:20:46] Sarah in position of a
[1:20:49] princess stately divine woman of high
[1:20:53] rank. Yes. For too long she could only
[1:20:57] see herself as a failure as too far
[1:21:00] gone. You know, as too old or too
[1:21:03] undesirable or you know
[1:21:06] why she was now at the point said I
[1:21:09] couldn't even be desirable to as a wife
[1:21:11] to a 100y old man.
[1:21:16] She
[1:21:18] was certainly in her mind unable to
[1:21:21] fulfill the prophecy.
[1:21:24] She was too weak. She was too faithless
[1:21:27] to even believe. Hope for her was gone.
[1:21:32] Not only was her body dead, her faith
[1:21:35] was dead.
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:37] Amen. Now, she saw herself as one thing
[1:21:42] and God saw her as another. Amen. Hello.
[1:21:46] Oh, if we could just see ourselves as
[1:21:49] God sees us. God didn't see a woman too
[1:21:52] old, too unable, too weak, too much
[1:21:56] doubt. Oh, no. He didn't see her like
[1:21:59] that. He saw her as a princess,
[1:22:03] as a mother of many. Somebody help me
[1:22:07] preach. It's like Gideon, you know, they
[1:22:10] come to when he's hiding and he's
[1:22:12] fearful and he's afraid and God comes to
[1:22:15] him and said, "The Lord is with thee,
[1:22:17] thou mighty man of valor."
[1:22:22] Who you talking about? God, I don't see
[1:22:24] him here. Ain't nobody here meets that
[1:22:27] descript. No, I'm hiding here.
[1:22:31] I'm the one worried and fearful and
[1:22:33] afraid. I'm no mighty man of valor. He
[1:22:36] didn't see himself as a mighty man of
[1:22:38] valor. Amen. Right then, he was hiding
[1:22:41] from the enemy. Gideon didn't feel like
[1:22:43] at all that he was a mighty man. He was.
[1:22:46] But he was.
[1:22:48] And with an army of 300, he defeated
[1:22:51] millions of the Midianites. Let me tell
[1:22:54] you, that is a mighty man of strength.
[1:22:58] Amen. Take your nap some other time. I'm
[1:23:00] preaching to you. Amen. So he said,
[1:23:03] "Where is Sarah, thy wife?" Here's what
[1:23:05] he Where is Sarah, thy wife? I got to
[1:23:08] get Sarah on board. I got to get Sarah.
[1:23:12] I got to get the bride to believe him. I
[1:23:14] got to get people's heart turned back to
[1:23:16] believing again where they can believe
[1:23:19] that there's nothing too hard for the
[1:23:20] Lord. They can believe in the
[1:23:22] miraculous. They can believe in the Holy
[1:23:25] Spirit. they can believe that they can
[1:23:27] be filled again with the genuine seal of
[1:23:30] God and be sealed to the name. I got to
[1:23:33] get people to believe it again.
[1:23:37] That's right.
[1:23:40] Where is your
[1:23:41] wife? She's back there hiding in the
[1:23:46] tent. Sitting back there pouting,
[1:23:50] worried,
[1:23:52] gave up on the promise long time ago. No
[1:23:54] need to even come out. Bent
[1:23:57] over, you
[1:23:59] know, wrinkled up. Where is your wife,
[1:24:03] Sarah?
[1:24:05] Where's the princess?
[1:24:12] I want to see the princess. Have the
[1:24:13] princess come out. Amen. The mother of
[1:24:17] mason.
[1:24:20] Princess, I don't feel like no princess.
[1:24:24] Sarah meaning mother of
[1:24:26] nations. I've never even had a child
[1:24:30] and she laughed within herself in her
[1:24:32] heart. You see, she needed her heart
[1:24:35] turned. And we need our hearts turned.
[1:24:39] Amen. Malachi 4 said, "I'll send you
[1:24:41] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:24:44] the Lord, the great and dreadful day of
[1:24:46] the Lord, and he shall turn
[1:24:50] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:24:53] children, the heart of the children to
[1:24:55] the fathers, lest I come and smite the
[1:24:57] earth with a curse." If I don't come and
[1:24:59] turn them, I'll just have to wipe it all
[1:25:02] off.
[1:25:05] Come on. Amen. I would have to give up
[1:25:08] on my plan. But I'm going to do
[1:25:11] something.
[1:25:12] I can't leave my people in unbelief and
[1:25:16] doubt and fear and powerless and weak.
[1:25:20] Amen. I have to put a strength into her.
[1:25:23] I have to turn her back to believing
[1:25:25] again.
[1:25:29] The heart has to be turned back to the
[1:25:31] word, the original faith that was once
[1:25:33] delivered to the saints. Yes, sir. But
[1:25:35] not just the word as a theology,
[1:25:38] but the word in power.
[1:25:41] Isaiah 55 and 7 said, "Let the wicked
[1:25:44] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[1:25:47] his thoughts, and let him return unto
[1:25:50] the Lord, for he will have mercy upon
[1:25:52] him and to our God, for he will
[1:25:55] abundantly pardon." Aren't you glad to
[1:25:58] serve a God like that? For he says, "My
[1:26:01] thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
[1:26:03] are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord.
[1:26:07] For as the heavens are higher than the
[1:26:09] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[1:26:11] ways, and my thoughts and your thoughts.
[1:26:14] For as the rain cometh down in the snow
[1:26:16] from heaven, and returneth not thither,
[1:26:19] but waterth the earth, and maketh it
[1:26:21] bring forth, and bud, that it may give
[1:26:23] seed to the ser, and bread to the eater.
[1:26:26] So shall my word that be that goeth
[1:26:29] forth out of my mouth, it shall not
[1:26:31] return unto me void, but it shall
[1:26:33] accomplish that which I please, and it
[1:26:36] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:26:38] sent it.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah.
[1:26:42] My word will not return void. I've
[1:26:46] released a message in this day. I've
[1:26:48] released a word and it's a powerful
[1:26:51] word. There's a dynamic power that goes
[1:26:54] with it. A creative power. And I'll
[1:26:56] create a bride.
[1:26:59] I'll call her out.
[1:27:01] [Applause]
[1:27:04] Should be mine. She'll be my elect, my
[1:27:06] chosen,
[1:27:09] my beloved.
[1:27:10] For you shall go out with joy and be led
[1:27:13] forth with peace. And the mountains and
[1:27:16] the hills shall break before you forth
[1:27:18] before you in the sing. and all the
[1:27:20] trees of the field shall clap their
[1:27:22] hands. Amen. I don't know if you know
[1:27:25] what that is, but that's Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] revival. Little bride like Sarah, you're
[1:27:30] going to laugh and you're going to
[1:27:32] rejoice again.
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:42] And instead of the
[1:27:44] thorn and making another denomination
[1:27:48] and a thorny group of people shall come
[1:27:50] up the vert tree instead of the brier
[1:27:53] there come up the myrtle tree and it
[1:27:56] shall be to the Lord for a name for an
[1:27:59] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[1:28:02] off. Amen. What a word of promise. What
[1:28:05] a prophecy. What a prophecy. Amen. Not
[1:28:08] only is it a prophecy, that's the
[1:28:10] prophecy. You are the fulfillment.
[1:28:14] Hallelujah. If he said, "Amen, I'm going
[1:28:17] to have a rapture." That word cannot
[1:28:19] return to him empty. It has to
[1:28:22] accomplish what he sent it to do. If he
[1:28:24] said, "We're going to be there without
[1:28:26] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, then
[1:28:28] I don't care how big your blemish is. We
[1:28:31] are going to be there without blemish.
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:40] Amen. Yes, sir. First Thessalonian tells
[1:28:43] us the word of God works effectively and
[1:28:46] has intended results in those that
[1:28:49] believe. Another translation says, "When
[1:28:52] you have faith, the word of God is a
[1:28:55] living power in you." Amen.
[1:28:59] The word became a living power within
[1:29:02] Sarah. It arrested her thoughts. It
[1:29:06] changed her attitude. Amen. It enlarged
[1:29:10] her faith. And finally, it changed her
[1:29:13] body.
[1:29:14] Yes, sir. Come on. The change had to
[1:29:17] start from the inside out.
[1:29:21] That's right. Amen. When Elohim came
[1:29:24] accompanied to with them two angels, she
[1:29:26] was faithless. She was hopeless. She was
[1:29:29] bitter. She was angry. She was old. She
[1:29:33] was set in her ways. She didn't want to
[1:29:36] be bothered.
[1:29:39] Come on. And if you ever read Brother
[1:29:41] Brandam on it, he said she was in a bad
[1:29:43] mood that day.
[1:29:47] But when he came, he turned her heart.
[1:29:50] And in turning her heart, she began to
[1:29:53] see herself as God saw her. That's
[1:29:57] right.
[1:29:59] Amen. She was the
[1:30:02] princess, the mother of nations,
[1:30:05] chosen, elect, desirable, no longer a
[1:30:10] forsaken woman, but sought after.
[1:30:15] Not even just by her husband, but a
[1:30:18] young king sought after her. She was so
[1:30:21] beautiful, but that beauty had to come
[1:30:23] from the inside first.
[1:30:28] Amen. There had to be a change of
[1:30:30] attitude, of mindset.
[1:30:33] Faith had to start to work within her.
[1:30:37] The change happens from the inside out.
[1:30:40] A desired healing always begins from the
[1:30:43] inside out by turning the heart from
[1:30:47] doubting, from the
[1:30:49] impossibilities to faith to believing.
[1:30:52] Yeah. Now Sarah had a change of heart
[1:30:55] first before the change in her body. She
[1:30:59] had to start believing she was a
[1:31:01] princess.
[1:31:05] She had to start believing she was a
[1:31:07] mother of nations.
[1:31:09] Not one by substitution either. Come on.
[1:31:13] Through a child of Hagar, but she was
[1:31:15] indeed the queen mother of the Abrahamic
[1:31:19] race. Amen. Amen. Oh, she she had
[1:31:23] started
[1:31:25] walking. When this change started on the
[1:31:28] inside, first thing you know, he called
[1:31:31] me a princess.
[1:31:34] He called me He called me princess.
[1:31:38] He said I was a mother of masons.
[1:31:43] Amen. and sed pretty soon instead of her
[1:31:46] head down low and stooped over, she
[1:31:50] began to walk like a princess.
[1:31:53] And now I just can't press like a woman,
[1:31:55] but I'll tell you what, she she held her
[1:31:58] head up high
[1:32:01] and God called her a princess. And that
[1:32:04] nagging feeling of I'll never be good
[1:32:06] enough and I'm too weak and my faith
[1:32:09] isn't very strong and I'll never have
[1:32:11] enough faith and I can never please God
[1:32:13] enough and it's too much. God just
[1:32:15] expects too much.
[1:32:18] That spirit of fear that just sneaks up
[1:32:21] on you and overwhelms you that keeps
[1:32:23] trying you, you know, you keep trying to
[1:32:25] pry his wicked fingers off of your neck.
[1:32:29] But I listen, God wanted her to know.
[1:32:33] Yeah, I've called you for a purpose.
[1:32:37] You are loved.
[1:32:41] You know, sometimes God just does things
[1:32:44] special like that. I had a brother in my
[1:32:47] church. He's gone on to be with the Lord
[1:32:49] now. Was died a faithful
[1:32:51] Christian. You know, I don't like
[1:32:53] preaching funerals too much, but it's a
[1:32:56] lot easier when you know one's really
[1:32:58] surrendered to God. Yeah, but I knew
[1:33:01] this man since he was young
[1:33:03] and dealt with him and his wife and
[1:33:06] through many things and you know he just
[1:33:09] was wicked.
[1:33:13] come to church, live, you know, lived a
[1:33:16] double standard, double life,
[1:33:18] everything. And out of church and in
[1:33:21] church and out of church and oh
[1:33:24] my, horrible, indescribably
[1:33:28] horrible, you know, so bad I've hardly
[1:33:31] ever done this. Maybe in 50 years of
[1:33:34] ministry, maybe I probably count on one
[1:33:36] hand how many times I had to do it. But
[1:33:38] I finally had to put him out of the
[1:33:40] church, turn him out over to the devil
[1:33:44] because he just wouldn't ever
[1:33:48] repent. Kept, you know, one one to, you
[1:33:53] know, sometimes people just go out and
[1:33:55] do whatever they want to do. Well, go
[1:33:57] out do what you got to do. But you're in
[1:34:00] the church and you're bringing shame and
[1:34:04] and and and trouble in the church and
[1:34:06] all of that. Sometimes you just have to
[1:34:11] say, "We don't want to do this.
[1:34:14] We've pleaded with you. We've tried. We
[1:34:17] prayed with you. We've we've we've cried
[1:34:20] on the altar with you, but we got to
[1:34:23] turn you over to Satan."
[1:34:26] And you know, sin pays his wages.
[1:34:31] He's laying on a hospital bill, some bed
[1:34:34] some 20 years later. And I went to him
[1:34:37] and I said,
[1:34:38] "Bob," I said, "You know, you've run for
[1:34:42] the Lord a long time, and now, you know,
[1:34:45] you're here in this situation. You're
[1:34:47] fixing to go to a serious
[1:34:49] surgery." And he said, "Yeah." I said,
[1:34:53] 'But God still cares.
[1:34:57] There's still hope. You don't have to
[1:35:00] keep on going in direction you can. You
[1:35:02] can turn around right now.
[1:35:06] And right there, I led him back to the
[1:35:07] Lord. And you know, he never walked
[1:35:10] again.
[1:35:12] Got around with a walker for a little
[1:35:13] while, finally to a wheelchair. But you
[1:35:16] know, he was sitting there in his house
[1:35:18] one day and you know, you've been
[1:35:20] scarred with sin and got all that guilt
[1:35:23] and shame and harm that has brought to
[1:35:26] your family and you see the seed you
[1:35:28] swed and you know all of
[1:35:31] that. You know, he was sitting there by
[1:35:36] the phone. He didn't we didn't we didn't
[1:35:40] very few of us had a cell phone in them,
[1:35:43] you know.
[1:35:45] So he he was sitting there by the phone
[1:35:48] was on the wall and he had a high chair
[1:35:50] that he just kind of sitting there and
[1:35:53] he was sitting there drinking his iced
[1:35:55] tea and and he was just praying said,
[1:35:58] "Lord, you've been so good to me. You've
[1:36:02] forgiven me of my sins and I know I'm
[1:36:05] forgiven, Lord. I know you did it, Lord.
[1:36:07] And I do believe you love me. But if you
[1:36:10] could just show me somehow, if you could
[1:36:13] just let me know that you love me. Now,
[1:36:17] I love you, Lord, and I'm telling you, I
[1:36:19] love you, and but I just love you to
[1:36:21] hear it, hear it from you. And, you
[1:36:23] know, he took his run out of his tea
[1:36:27] that he was drinking. So he, you know,
[1:36:30] with his walker just taking painful
[1:36:33] steps and made it around the the counter
[1:36:36] and got over and refilled his glass and
[1:36:39] painfully made it back all the way and
[1:36:42] and he's praying all the way, Lord, if
[1:36:45] you could just somehow tell me, I just
[1:36:48] so appreciate it, Lord. Just let me know
[1:36:50] somehow you love me. I've done so many
[1:36:53] things and you've forgiven me. I accept
[1:36:56] your forgiveness. and he just sat down
[1:36:59] and he said at the chair and said, "Hey,
[1:37:02] man." Went to sip of water and the phone
[1:37:05] rang. Well, I was out in my barn. I was
[1:37:09] a I've been a farmer and I was out
[1:37:11] milking and you know the Holy Spirit
[1:37:15] spoke to me said, "Go call Bob on the
[1:37:20] phone and tell him these words. Just say
[1:37:23] these three words to him. I love you.
[1:37:27] Hallelujah.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah.
[1:37:31] So I left the animals on the stand and I
[1:37:34] run outside and I I I grabbed a a phone
[1:37:38] where I could get a signal and I said,
[1:37:40] "Hey, hey, Bob, let me tell you
[1:37:42] something. I don't know what's going on
[1:37:44] and I don't know why, but God just spoke
[1:37:46] to tell me me just in this moment and
[1:37:49] let you know this. He wanted me to give
[1:37:52] you this message. I love you.
[1:38:01] And I don't care what you've been
[1:38:04] through and the scars in your life. He
[1:38:06] loves you so much. He gave his life for
[1:38:11] you to redeem you, to wash you, to
[1:38:16] cleanse you, to make you acceptable in
[1:38:19] his sight. Amen.
[1:38:21] Oh, God. You say, "Oh, Brother Tim, I
[1:38:25] just wish God would tell me that." Well,
[1:38:27] he does over and over again. I'm telling
[1:38:31] you this morning. Isaiah 43 and4 says,
[1:38:34] and this is God, you are precious in my
[1:38:37] eyes and you are honored and I love you.
[1:38:43] Amen. And then Psalms 46 says, "God is
[1:38:46] within her and she will not fall." Amen.
[1:38:50] John 15:9, "As the Father has loved me,
[1:38:53] so have I loved you. Abide in my love."
[1:38:58] But despite of all of that, many times
[1:39:01] we feel doubtful. How can he love me?
[1:39:06] I've never done anything worthy of being
[1:39:09] loved, you know.
[1:39:11] But this is what the God of the Bible
[1:39:13] says. You're worthy.
[1:39:17] God says you're worth fighting for.
[1:39:21] Exodus 14:14, "The Lord will fight for
[1:39:24] you. You only need to be still." You're
[1:39:27] worth fighting for. God says you're
[1:39:29] valuable.
[1:39:32] Come on. Amen. Are not five sparrows
[1:39:35] sold for two copper coins? And not one
[1:39:38] of them is forgotten before God. But the
[1:39:40] very hairs of your head are all number.
[1:39:43] Do not fear. Therefore, you are much
[1:39:45] value than many sparrows.
[1:39:49] Amen. Deuteromy said, "It is the Lord
[1:39:51] who goes before you. He will be with
[1:39:53] you. He will never leave you or forsake
[1:39:56] you. Do not fear or be dismayed."
[1:40:00] Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:01] Now according to the
[1:40:03] dictionary cinnamon synonyms for worthy
[1:40:07] are
[1:40:08] valuable,
[1:40:10] admirable, precious,
[1:40:13] worthwhile.
[1:40:15] Do you see yourself in that light?
[1:40:18] Are you
[1:40:20] afraid I just don't quite measure up?
[1:40:25] Do you
[1:40:26] understand how valuable you are in God's
[1:40:29] eyes? Amen.
[1:40:32] So much that you have been chosen and
[1:40:34] elected and predestinated and set apart
[1:40:37] as his beloved.
[1:40:40] You're not a nobody.
[1:40:43] You're a somebody.
[1:40:45] And you're part of the body.
[1:40:48] And you know what happened to Sarah? The
[1:40:50] peace of God be to rule her heart. And
[1:40:53] no longer did she have these negative
[1:40:55] thoughts that ruled her heart.
[1:40:59] You know, brother Brandham tells us,
[1:41:00] keep thinking on that. If there be any
[1:41:02] praise, if there be any virtue, think on
[1:41:04] these things. You can't get anything
[1:41:06] from God with a negative thought. He
[1:41:08] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:41:10] is and he is rewarder of those that
[1:41:13] diligently seek him. Amen. So, we got to
[1:41:17] have the right mental attitude toward
[1:41:20] God's promise to bring it to pass that
[1:41:23] I'm chosen. I am loved. I am worthy. I
[1:41:27] am blessed.
[1:41:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:31] Oh, God help me. I hope I can preaching
[1:41:33] to a bunch of sleeping virgins today.
[1:41:38] Amen. The alarm clock going off. Wake
[1:41:40] up. You see the word of the son of man,
[1:41:44] God in clothes of a man, God in dust.
[1:41:47] His word begin to rule her heart. Oh
[1:41:50] God, that's what we want is his word to
[1:41:53] rule our heart, not our fears.
[1:41:56] Not our worries, not our anxieties, but
[1:42:00] his word to rule our hearts.
[1:42:04] Amen. Colossians 3:15. And let the God
[1:42:06] of peace rule in your hearts to the
[1:42:09] which you are called in one body, and be
[1:42:11] you thankful. And let the word of God
[1:42:13] dwell in you richly in all wisdom,
[1:42:16] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:42:18] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[1:42:22] singing with grace in your hearts to the
[1:42:25] Lord.
[1:42:26] Let the peace of God take full control.
[1:42:30] Give it preeminence.
[1:42:33] Be thankful.
[1:42:36] When you start looking at your don'ts
[1:42:38] and your wants, be thankful for what you
[1:42:41] got.
[1:42:42] Amen. I've always given thanks. The word
[1:42:46] is to dwell in you richly. It's to is
[1:42:49] teaching, admonishing, and and psalms
[1:42:52] and hymns and and spiritual singing with
[1:42:55] grace in your hearts. Isaiah 26:3, "Thou
[1:42:59] will keep him in perfect peace, whose
[1:43:01] mind is stayed on thee, because he
[1:43:05] trusts in thee."
[1:43:07] So trust in the Lord forever. For in the
[1:43:10] Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.
[1:43:15] Of course, the spirit of God is the word
[1:43:18] of God. They're one and the same. We're
[1:43:20] to be a word bride. That's right. And
[1:43:22] what's coming forth in this in this hour
[1:43:25] from from the church is a word bride. As
[1:43:28] brother Brandon said in the birth
[1:43:31] message, birth pains, she's fixing to
[1:43:33] bring forth the perfect word and the
[1:43:35] groom. The word is coming for the word
[1:43:37] bride as a woman is a part of the man so
[1:43:41] that the church will be will have to be
[1:43:43] a word abiding church. Every word of the
[1:43:46] Bible,
[1:43:48] every word spoke of the virgin must be
[1:43:50] fulfilled in this bride. She is the
[1:43:53] embodiment of the word.
[1:43:55] Malachi 4 says our hearts will be
[1:43:57] turned. So somebody's going to believe.
[1:44:00] [Applause]
[1:44:01] Hallelujah. When I get discouraged
[1:44:03] sometimes, and I do. Amen. I look at
[1:44:06] people instead of looking at the
[1:44:07] promise. And I have to get my eyes off
[1:44:09] of men and their failures and their
[1:44:11] faults. And I have to look back at the
[1:44:13] promise and said, "God, you said I'll
[1:44:15] have a bride and they will be without
[1:44:17] spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such
[1:44:20] thing."
[1:44:24] So therefore, as Psalms 57 says, "My
[1:44:27] heart is fixed.
[1:44:30] I want you to fix your heart on the
[1:44:32] promise." Oh God, my heart is fixed.
[1:44:36] I will sing and give praise. I'm keeping
[1:44:40] my mind, my heart on thee, oh God. I'll
[1:44:42] sing and give praise. Awake up my glory.
[1:44:45] Awake sultry and harp. I myself will
[1:44:49] wake early. I will praise thee, oh Lord,
[1:44:51] among the people. I will sing unto thee
[1:44:53] among the nations, for thy mercy is
[1:44:55] great as the heavens, and thy truth unto
[1:44:58] the clouds. Be thou exalted, oh God,
[1:45:00] above the heavens. Let thy glory be
[1:45:03] above all the earth.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. He says again in Psalms
[1:45:08] 1:12, "Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is
[1:45:12] the man that fears or re rever the Lord,
[1:45:15] that delight greatly in his commandments
[1:45:18] or his word." Amen.
[1:45:21] Listen to what he said.
[1:45:24] Focus in right now. Every mother, every
[1:45:26] dad, right now, focus in on this next
[1:45:28] verse. His seed shall be mighty in the
[1:45:33] earth.
[1:45:35] Come on now.
[1:45:37] This is what he said. This is what's
[1:45:39] prophesied over your children.
[1:45:44] Amen. Come on now.
[1:45:47] Hallelujah. Oh, you know, I've had
[1:45:49] mothers get frustrated with their
[1:45:50] children. My kid must be a serpent seed.
[1:45:53] None of my kids are serpent seed.
[1:45:56] I ain't going to believe that about none
[1:45:57] of them.
[1:46:00] Amen. No, my children are called.
[1:46:02] They're elected. They're chosen. They
[1:46:05] are blessed. They're going to be there.
[1:46:08] And I'm not leaving a hook behind. Oh,
[1:46:11] no. I'm taking every every promise. I I
[1:46:14] claim my children, my their spouses now.
[1:46:17] I claim my grandchildren. They're all
[1:46:19] going. I'm not leaving any behind.
[1:46:26] Why? He said his seed should be mighty
[1:46:28] upon the earth. My My children are
[1:46:32] mighty upon the earth. That's what God's
[1:46:34] children are. That's what your children
[1:46:36] are. So I they ain't that way right now.
[1:46:39] I'm not talking about right now old
[1:46:41] decrepit Sarah. I'm talking about.
[1:46:44] Hallelujah. What's God said about your
[1:46:46] children?
[1:46:51] The generation, the offspring of the
[1:46:54] upright shall be blessed.
[1:46:59] The offspring of the upright shall be
[1:47:03] blessed.
[1:47:06] [Applause]
[1:47:07] Well, brother Tim, I just got to live
[1:47:09] poor on the earth. Wealth and riches
[1:47:11] shall be in his house, and his
[1:47:13] righteousness endureth forever. Unto the
[1:47:16] upright that rises arises light in the
[1:47:19] darkness. Amen. He is gracious and full
[1:47:22] of compassion and righteous.
[1:47:26] Amen. Watch what he says now. A good man
[1:47:28] showeth favor and lendeth. He will guide
[1:47:31] his affairs with discretion. And I ask
[1:47:34] you, is not God a good man?
[1:47:39] Then he shows favor
[1:47:42] and he gives.
[1:47:44] He guides the affairs of his house with
[1:47:46] discretion. He provides for his wife,
[1:47:50] the
[1:47:51] church. He loves her.
[1:47:54] I'm trying to tell you something. God
[1:47:56] really loves you.
[1:48:00] His favor is on you, Mary.
[1:48:04] Mary, you're highly favored.
[1:48:08] You had an angel come. Come on,
[1:48:10] somebody. You had an angel. You had a
[1:48:13] messenger. You had a messenger from God
[1:48:15] that come to tell you, you're highly
[1:48:17] favored. And I got a message for you.
[1:48:21] You're the virgin that's going to bring
[1:48:22] him back again.
[1:48:24] Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] Somebody's going to believe that. Amen.
[1:48:29] Somebody's going to look in the mirror
[1:48:31] of God's word and say, "Mama, that's
[1:48:32] me." Somebody's not going to try to
[1:48:35] perpetuate another generation and say,
[1:48:37] "Well, our generation failed and
[1:48:39] somebody else can take it." No, I am the
[1:48:42] generation that's going in.
[1:48:48] I didn't expect this to fail or to fall.
[1:48:51] I came here to win.
[1:48:54] That's right. And a winner never quits.
[1:48:57] And a quitter will never win.
[1:49:02] Glory to God. Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:05] Amen. Amen. Good preacher. Surely he
[1:49:09] will not be moved forever. The righteous
[1:49:12] shall be in everlasting
[1:49:14] remembrance. He shall not be afraid of
[1:49:17] evil tidings. His heart is fixed.
[1:49:22] Trusting in the Lord. Come on, get your
[1:49:25] heart turned and fixed
[1:49:27] on the Lord. His heart is established.
[1:49:31] He shall not be afraid until he sees his
[1:49:34] desire upon his enemy.
[1:49:38] I'm going to see my desire on my enemy.
[1:49:41] I'm going to see my desire. Oh man, I'm
[1:49:43] going to see my desire on the enemy of
[1:49:45] cancer. On the enemy of disease, on the
[1:49:49] enemy that wants to pull away our young
[1:49:51] people. I'm going to see my desire upon
[1:49:53] my enemies.
[1:49:55] Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] [Applause]
[1:49:58] Fixed. You see, Jesus, you see, Jesus
[1:50:04] knew, as he says in the church age book,
[1:50:06] Jesus knew there's going to be a
[1:50:08] terrible drift away from the word in the
[1:50:11] Pergamian age, which was as
[1:50:15] yet 200 years off from the Patmas
[1:50:18] vision. He knew that the drift would
[1:50:21] cause them to go into the dark ages. He
[1:50:24] knew that the way man originally got
[1:50:27] away from God was was by first leaving
[1:50:30] the word. If you leave that word, you
[1:50:32] have left God.
[1:50:34] Thus, he has presented himself to the
[1:50:36] church at Pergamus and indeed to all the
[1:50:39] churches of the ages. I am the word.
[1:50:43] If you want deity in your midst, then
[1:50:47] welcome and receive the word. Don't ever
[1:50:50] let anyone or anything get between you
[1:50:52] and that word. This is what I'm giving
[1:50:55] you. The word is a revelation of myself.
[1:50:57] I am the word. Remember that.
[1:51:01] Amen. Well, oh, glory, brother Tim.
[1:51:04] We've received the message. We've
[1:51:05] welcomed the word. Yeah. God sent a
[1:51:07] prophet. Hallelujah. Yeah. You received
[1:51:09] that portion. Yeah.
[1:51:12] But what about the word about your
[1:51:13] healing? Yeah.
[1:51:17] Amen. What about this word? And the Lord
[1:51:19] will take away all sickness from you and
[1:51:23] will afflict you with none of the
[1:51:24] terrible diseases of Egypt which you've
[1:51:26] known. I want you to take note of this.
[1:51:30] We were taught by this message that no
[1:51:32] sickness is from God.
[1:51:36] Amen. Listen. He said he takes away
[1:51:40] sickness,
[1:51:41] not that he brings it. He promised he
[1:51:44] would not afflict us with any of the
[1:51:48] terrible diseases of Egypt. So let me
[1:51:51] tell you, all sickness
[1:51:54] is of the devil.
[1:51:57] God did not bring it to you, but he will
[1:52:01] take it away from you.
[1:52:05] Amen. It is a foreign life. It is a
[1:52:08] demonic life. And we have the right to
[1:52:12] cast it out.
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:16] Amen. So if you want deity in your
[1:52:18] midst, you're welcome and receive the
[1:52:20] word. All right. Quit thinking now. I'm
[1:52:24] sick.
[1:52:25] God, whoa, what did I do this time?
[1:52:30] How did I fail you? What did I do to
[1:52:33] deserve this?
[1:52:35] Oh, why are you always blaming? Why do
[1:52:38] we always blame our relationship with
[1:52:41] God?
[1:52:45] Like that he's watching out to get us
[1:52:49] that he's just waiting. He's just
[1:52:51] waiting for the slightest mistake so he
[1:52:54] can condemn us. Come on.
[1:52:58] You know how many people have tried to
[1:53:00] pin it on brother Ron
[1:53:02] that somehow he failed the Lord, that
[1:53:05] he's been disobedient, that he wasn't
[1:53:08] good enough, and he didn't do the right
[1:53:10] things.
[1:53:12] Surely that's why that he's sick.
[1:53:15] That sickness ain't of God. That
[1:53:17] sickness is of the devil.
[1:53:20] That's right. Well, I'm sick, Brother
[1:53:22] Jim. I must have failed God. You're sick
[1:53:25] because you're human.
[1:53:29] Cuz you're mortal. That's why you're
[1:53:32] sick. And your body was perverted from
[1:53:34] the perfection. And it's opened the ever
[1:53:36] tormented spirit of the devil.
[1:53:40] Because you're mortal. That's right.
[1:53:43] Brother Brandham said, "Satan's army
[1:53:45] brings diseases." That's what Satan is.
[1:53:48] He's a destroyer. Satan. The whole
[1:53:50] kingdom of Satan is sickness, death,
[1:53:52] sorrow, frustrations, worry, all on
[1:53:55] Satan. God is life, faith, joy, peace
[1:53:59] over here. That's the two great forces
[1:54:01] that's coming together right now.
[1:54:02] They're battling. They're battling right
[1:54:04] here in the building right now. They're
[1:54:05] battle day by day with you ever force.
[1:54:09] Satan following you along. That great
[1:54:12] big kingly priestly Goliath trying to
[1:54:15] scare the liver out of you. True. And
[1:54:19] you're fortified. Amen. With the gospel,
[1:54:21] with the word of the truth around your
[1:54:23] loin. Glory, preacher. That's what it
[1:54:25] is. Helmet of salvation, the shield of
[1:54:27] faith, the sword, waving it in your
[1:54:29] hand. Satan, I'm coming to meet you. You
[1:54:32] meet me in the name of science. You meet
[1:54:34] me in the name of culture and knowledge.
[1:54:36] But I meet you in the name of the Lord,
[1:54:38] God of Israel. I'm coming after you.
[1:54:40] Give way. Even death can't stand there.
[1:54:43] Chop a hole right through
[1:54:45] it. Amen.
[1:54:50] But brother
[1:54:52] Tim, you just don't know me. I I'm just
[1:54:55] not worthy to be
[1:54:57] healed. And I I I just I just can't seem
[1:55:01] to have the faith. I I've just
[1:55:04] done too many sins, bad sins. I've been
[1:55:09] too wicked in my life. I I'm just not
[1:55:13] worthy.
[1:55:16] But I I'll tell you what I'll do. You
[1:55:18] know, with your encouragement this
[1:55:21] morning, I I'll stand close enough to
[1:55:23] the table and just hope that God will
[1:55:27] throw me a crumb.
[1:55:34] Well, now if you're truly a sinner with
[1:55:37] unconfessed sins, that might be the
[1:55:39] case.
[1:55:41] So, I just give you a word. Repent.
[1:55:47] That's that simple. Repent.
[1:55:50] It don't take a lot of time.
[1:55:54] Come on. It just one moment of sincere
[1:55:56] believing. Come on. Confessing to God.
[1:55:59] Repent. Turn from it. Amen. Put it
[1:56:03] behind you.
[1:56:08] You know, I don't have the time to tell
[1:56:10] you all the details of it, but let me
[1:56:12] just get through this quickly. There's a
[1:56:13] sister in my
[1:56:15] church that I I was there in the prayer
[1:56:18] line when she went through the prayer
[1:56:20] line at brother Brandham's
[1:56:21] meetings and there was she was a young
[1:56:25] girl. She was a cheerleader in high
[1:56:26] school. I told this the other day to you
[1:56:29] some of you. She was a cheerleader in
[1:56:32] high school and her uncle came and to
[1:56:34] her. he'd kind of gotten among the full
[1:56:35] gospel and met brother Brandon's in the
[1:56:38] some of the meetings and um I don't
[1:56:41] think met him personally but met him you
[1:56:43] know by going to his meetings anyway he
[1:56:46] came and said hey there's a prophet
[1:56:49] there's a prophet in the land and God
[1:56:52] sent a messenger and and he was telling
[1:56:54] his sister and his niece there her name
[1:56:57] was Jeanie Jeanie was a cheerleader in
[1:57:00] high school Methodist girl very popular
[1:57:03] man, she'd picked up the slipping around
[1:57:06] smoking, you know, her mama didn't know
[1:57:09] it, so it was kind of hidden from her
[1:57:14] mama. So anyway, they got in the prayer
[1:57:17] line. It was one, it was an open prayer
[1:57:19] line. They just give everybody a card
[1:57:20] that wanted to come. They got in the
[1:57:23] prayer line and and they just wanted to
[1:57:27] go, you
[1:57:28] know, be be close to this prophet just
[1:57:31] to to be blessed. They didn't really
[1:57:34] have a particular need they didn't know
[1:57:36] of. But anyway, as she comes up, she's
[1:57:39] standing there and in the prayer line
[1:57:41] and about four or five people ahead of
[1:57:44] her, you know, it's a fast line. you
[1:57:47] know, they're just praying, passing them
[1:57:48] through, praying, passing them through,
[1:57:49] and God blessed us, and then Lord
[1:57:51] touched his heart and whatever. And as
[1:57:55] they were passing them through, Brother
[1:57:57] Brandham stopped the lady in front of
[1:58:00] her, about four or five ahead of her,
[1:58:01] and said, "Wait a
[1:58:04] minute. You're desiring a great thing.
[1:58:07] You're wanting a
[1:58:09] baby. But if you repent of that sin in
[1:58:12] your life, that cigarette you're
[1:58:14] smoking, God will forgive you and he'll
[1:58:17] grant you that
[1:58:19] baby. Wow. You know, Genie, she realized
[1:58:23] right now I'm
[1:58:27] exposed. I get in front of this prophet,
[1:58:30] he's going to tell my mama I've been
[1:58:32] smoking. I'm going to be in trouble.
[1:58:36] So, you know what Jeanie did? She bowed
[1:58:38] her head and said, "God, I didn't know
[1:58:41] how wrong that was. Forgive me right
[1:58:44] now. Watch me, Lord. Cleanse me from
[1:58:47] that. I'm so sorry, Lord. I I I take
[1:58:52] that from me." And you know what?
[1:58:56] Five people later, she passes through
[1:59:00] feeling the very presence of the angel
[1:59:02] of God. Not one sin was called out
[1:59:06] because now it's under the blood and not
[1:59:10] even a prophet can pull it
[1:59:14] out. It don't take forever.
[1:59:18] Amen. So if you need to repent, repent.
[1:59:23] Turn from it. Yes, sir.
[1:59:28] But if you're a redeemed son or daughter
[1:59:30] of God, that's just no way to approach
[1:59:33] him.
[1:59:35] You know, healing is the children's
[1:59:37] bread.
[1:59:39] It's designed, baked, especially for us.
[1:59:43] That's right.
[1:59:44] He was that meal offering that was
[1:59:46] ground,
[1:59:49] wounded, bruised,
[1:59:52] sifted, and made into bread.
[1:59:56] Healing is the children's bread. It's
[1:59:58] designed for us. Oh, yeah. Sometimes, oh
[2:00:01] yeah, even a prostitute will get a
[2:00:03] miracle. But as a bride of Christ, we're
[2:00:06] not asking God to feed the children and
[2:00:09] throw us a drum. Right?
[2:00:12] We need not crawl as dogs under the
[2:00:14] table hoping for a crime. Somebody help
[2:00:17] me preach. We're sons. We're his
[2:00:20] offspring. He by birth boy brought us
[2:00:23] into the family. And that's not how God
[2:00:26] wants his children to behave.
[2:00:29] Come on. We didn't come. We didn't ask
[2:00:31] for this position at the table. Amen. by
[2:00:34] his own design, by his plan, by his
[2:00:37] fornowledge. He birthed us into his
[2:00:39] household. And we are not an
[2:00:41] afterthought. We are pre-planned. We
[2:00:44] have his name. We have his identity. We
[2:00:47] are his children. And we have been
[2:00:49] called to come to his table.
[2:00:53] And by his design, we have a place to
[2:00:56] sit there.
[2:00:59] Yes, sir. Amen. And ain't the bread of
[2:01:02] healing. The bread of
[2:01:05] salvation, the bread of promise. Let's
[2:01:08] just take it and eat it with
[2:01:10] thanksgiving.
[2:01:11] Let's set it. Let's sit at his table.
[2:01:14] That son's not as slinking dogs under
[2:01:17] the table. Come on. Hoping that we'd get
[2:01:20] a crumb. Amen.
[2:01:22] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Brother Brandham
[2:01:25] said, "Divine healings today is not for
[2:01:27] the unbeliever. It's for those who
[2:01:29] believe. The baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:01:32] today is not for the unbelievers. It's
[2:01:35] for those who believe. Jesus died for
[2:01:38] believers, not for unbelievers. It's for
[2:01:40] those who believe. The supernatural
[2:01:42] follows. Who is supernatural minded?
[2:01:45] That's right. When the hungering and
[2:01:47] thirsting, when you got an expectancy,
[2:01:50] when you read God's word and expect to
[2:01:52] see God perform what he said he will do,
[2:01:55] God will do it. Be a crumb hunter. Amen.
[2:01:59] Amen. That's okay. Be a crumb hunter.
[2:02:02] But be willing to take a crumb. Every
[2:02:05] bit of it good.
[2:02:09] Amen. If you don't watch me and
[2:02:11] something falls under the table, I'll
[2:02:13] get it and eat it anyhow.
[2:02:15] You ain't nobody looking.
[2:02:18] Amen. Got this 3se secondond rule. If
[2:02:20] it's only been there 3 seconds, it's
[2:02:23] okay. But don't settle for a crumb.
[2:02:25] That's right.
[2:02:28] Listen, there's a seven course menu set
[2:02:30] before us. When God sets a table,
[2:02:33] there's an abundance.
[2:02:37] Hallelujah. Amen. He don't give a
[2:02:40] little. Come on, somebody. When he fed
[2:02:42] the 5,000, he didn't just give barely
[2:02:45] enough. There was nobody went away
[2:02:48] hungry and there was baskets of it left
[2:02:51] over.
[2:02:55] Amen. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:59] My it fed 5,000 men. If women, children
[2:03:02] were counted, then there would have been
[2:03:03] 15,000 with that small meal. And they
[2:03:06] ate as much as they wanted. They were
[2:03:09] all satisfied.
[2:03:11] He lavished so much food that there were
[2:03:14] 12 baskets full of broken pieces and
[2:03:16] fish left over. Do you ever think about
[2:03:18] that? There was there was enough to take
[2:03:20] home.
[2:03:22] Did you ever notice? You ever notice
[2:03:24] there's two accounts? He he fed 5,000
[2:03:26] first time in Matthew 14. Then he feeds
[2:03:29] 4,000 second time in Matthew 15. Wonder
[2:03:33] what's the difference?
[2:03:35] Well, there was 5,000 took place near
[2:03:37] Bethada, which is close to the Sea of
[2:03:39] Galilee. There was 4,000 in the region
[2:03:42] of the
[2:03:43] Garrison. The first location near Bethea
[2:03:47] is Jewish. The second location is the
[2:03:50] region of the garrisoned. That's
[2:03:53] Gentiles. And what's the numbers, my
[2:03:55] child? Feeding of 5,000 represents the
[2:03:58] Jews. Five loaves.
[2:04:00] 5,000. You see, representing the old
[2:04:04] covenant, the first five books of Moses.
[2:04:07] And they end up with 12 baskets
[2:04:10] representing the 12 tribes of Israel.
[2:04:13] And the feeding of the 4,000 among the
[2:04:15] Gentiles represents the four gospels,
[2:04:18] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[2:04:21] Amen. And guess how many that little how
[2:04:24] many baskets they took up? They took up
[2:04:27] um seven baskets.
[2:04:30] Perfect
[2:04:31] representation. Come on, somebody. Amen.
[2:04:34] And there seven loaves were used and
[2:04:36] they took up seven baskets. perfect
[2:04:38] representation of seven churches making
[2:04:41] the fullness of the Gentiles. Well, the
[2:04:44] point of it is whether you agree with
[2:04:45] that or not, the point of it is when God
[2:04:48] sets a table, there is plenty.
[2:04:53] [Applause]
[2:04:59] Hallelujah. Not only is there plenty,
[2:05:02] there is overflow.
[2:05:04] Yeah. He's a God who's call himself El
[2:05:08] Shai. I'm more than enough.
[2:05:11] Amen. I'm not just barely a healer. I'm
[2:05:14] more than enough. I'm not just a
[2:05:17] deliverer. I'm more than enough.
[2:05:20] I'm the God who is more.
[2:05:27] Yes, sir.
[2:05:30] Brother Brandham
[2:05:33] said he said um in here in actton
[2:05:36] receiving the word he said I believe
[2:05:40] brother last evening brother David
[2:05:43] Duplicus I believe he did this
[2:05:45] congregation an injustice when we were
[2:05:48] on the road home we got in the car
[2:05:51] together and I looked down I said oh
[2:05:52] it's nearly 10:00 I said brother David I
[2:05:56] suppose I kept those people too wrong.
[2:05:59] And he said, "Brother Brandham, I think
[2:06:02] them people feel like I do. We're tired
[2:06:04] of hearing sermonets by preacheretses to
[2:06:10] Christianetses." So he said, "You know,
[2:06:12] that might encourage me to preach two
[2:06:14] more hours
[2:06:15] tonight. I I I Oh, I usually let out by
[2:06:19] 1:00, but I never I used to. I didn't.
[2:06:22] We just started good getting good at
[2:06:23] 1:00. We stayed there and praised the
[2:06:25] Lord all night. And it's too bad we ever
[2:06:28] got away from that, isn't it? And got
[2:06:30] into a 20minute intellectual sermon. I
[2:06:33] just wonder where all that came from. I
[2:06:35] wonder if we're not trying to pattern
[2:06:36] after the world a little bit too much. I
[2:06:39] believe if it hadn't worked in our ranks
[2:06:41] too much, think we should get out get
[2:06:45] out of it. You know, I just love to sit
[2:06:48] and mince and eat and mince and eat when
[2:06:52] I'm at the table.
[2:06:54] Now, that's a little bit southern for
[2:06:56] you people up here in Ohio, maybe, but
[2:06:59] we know what that means down in the
[2:07:01] South. We're big people down in the
[2:07:05] South. We know how to eat.
[2:07:08] And I tell you what, we like to mince
[2:07:10] and eat. What in the world does that
[2:07:12] mean, Brother Tim? Well, you know, you
[2:07:14] fill your plate up and you go to eat and
[2:07:17] then you run out of this, but you got to
[2:07:19] have a little more of this to go with
[2:07:22] this to be able to finish the meal. So,
[2:07:24] give me a little bit of more mashed
[2:07:26] ters. I need another piece of meat. I
[2:07:28] need, you know, she just mints. And you
[2:07:31] know, you know, you you're eating more
[2:07:32] when you're finishing up than what you
[2:07:34] started with.
[2:07:37] You see, and and so that's what it
[2:07:40] means. He said, "I like to mince and
[2:07:42] eat." You know, sitting at the Lord's
[2:07:45] table. Give me just a little more of
[2:07:47] that faith.
[2:07:49] I need a little more of that love. I
[2:07:52] need a little more of that grace. I I
[2:07:54] got to have it on my plate. I I want a
[2:07:57] greater portion.
[2:08:00] If you don't mind, I want a double
[2:08:02] portion.
[2:08:05] Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord.
[2:08:09] Come quench the thirst into my soul.
[2:08:13] Said, "Our pastor tonight preached about
[2:08:15] 45 minutes and I seen him look up at the
[2:08:17] clock and I said, "Yeah, brother
[2:08:18] Neville, you're getting it also. 45
[2:08:21] minutes. That's not long enough to get
[2:08:22] started. He's getting just interested. I
[2:08:25] was just getting stirred up to a place.
[2:08:27] I was feeling good, you know, and then
[2:08:29] he cut it off. What a shame.
[2:08:33] I know you've looked at your watch.
[2:08:37] That's okay.
[2:08:39] You know, with as many of you that took
[2:08:41] naps while I was
[2:08:42] preaching, I got a lot of time.
[2:08:50] Amen. Be willing though to sop up every
[2:08:53] crumb, hunt for the last crumb on the
[2:08:55] plate.
[2:08:57] Amen. You know, because he promised us a
[2:09:01] good full square meal, the full seven
[2:09:03] courts menu for all the seven seals are
[2:09:06] open and everything ready for the word
[2:09:08] of God to those who can receive it.
[2:09:10] Amen.
[2:09:12] So why take a few crumbs when our
[2:09:16] restorations promises that the fat shall
[2:09:19] overflow with wine and oil and you shall
[2:09:22] eat in plenty and the floor shall be
[2:09:25] full of wheat and the fat shall overflow
[2:09:28] with wine and oil. And I will restore to
[2:09:30] you the years that the locust is eaten,
[2:09:32] the cattle, the ganker worm, the
[2:09:34] caterpillar, the palmer worm, my great
[2:09:36] army which has sent among you. And ye
[2:09:38] shall eat of plenty and be satisfied and
[2:09:41] praise the name of the Lord your God
[2:09:43] that have dealt wondrously with you.
[2:09:46] Amen. And my people shall never be
[2:09:49] ashamed.
[2:09:51] [Applause]
[2:09:53] Hallelujah. Take the bread. It's
[2:09:55] healing. Healing is deliverance. It'll
[2:09:59] satisfy the hunger. It satisfies taste.
[2:10:04] And I want to tell you,
[2:10:07] take the
[2:10:09] bread and dip it in oil.
[2:10:15] And then dip it in wine.
[2:10:18] Yes, sir. That's right.
[2:10:21] Oh, wine, brother Tim. Yeah. Now the
[2:10:25] power of revelation brings stimulation
[2:10:27] to the believer. For the power of wine,
[2:10:30] natural wine is to stimulate. It's to
[2:10:32] bring a person that's all slumped down
[2:10:34] like Sarah slumped down to stimulation.
[2:10:38] And when there's when now there's power
[2:10:40] of revelation of the word, it gives
[2:10:42] stimulation of joy to the believer.
[2:10:44] Stimulation of satisfaction, the
[2:10:47] stimulation that is vindicated, is
[2:10:49] proved is called the scripture. We want
[2:10:51] to refer to it as new wine. As we refer
[2:10:54] to it like that as days are drunk on new
[2:10:56] wine. All right. Spiritual wine. Amen.
[2:10:59] And he said as a natural wine reveals
[2:11:02] itself in stimulated power so does the
[2:11:05] new wine as it reveals the word of God
[2:11:07] which is spirit and it stimulates and it
[2:11:11] gives joy because God is the word. And
[2:11:14] the new wine stimulates when it reveals
[2:11:17] the word and then it brings joy beyond
[2:11:20] measure. Yes. It brings such joy to just
[2:11:23] get over flooded.
[2:11:26] Hallelujah. Amen. As Ephesians 18 5:18
[2:11:30] said, "Be not drunk with with wine, with
[2:11:33] natural wine. We're in is excess, but be
[2:11:35] filled with the spirit." In other words,
[2:11:38] get drunk on the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:41] Come on. The spirit of God makes you so
[2:11:44] drunk, you'll forget your enemies.
[2:11:48] Come on now. Everything Everybody's in
[2:11:50] love with you. You don't care who's
[2:11:52] standing around you. You're the biggest
[2:11:54] man in the country right then. Come on.
[2:11:57] When you get drunk on that wine, you
[2:11:59] don't worry about enemies.
[2:12:03] Amen. It don't matter if your neighbor
[2:12:04] is sitting next to you and they go to a
[2:12:07] dignified church. Just let the Holy
[2:12:08] Ghost get on you one time.
[2:12:11] See what takes place. The prophet of God
[2:12:13] said, "Get right. Get real good. house
[2:12:17] drunk and you'll see what takes place.
[2:12:21] You'll say, "Sister, I got it. You want
[2:12:23] it, too.
[2:12:25] Something will take place."
[2:12:28] He said, "This Holy Ghost gospel is
[2:12:31] nothing but one great big powerhouse of
[2:12:33] joy." The Holy Ghost gospel is a perfect
[2:12:37] intoxication for every man that's got
[2:12:39] the blues. You take a drink of the
[2:12:41] gospel of Jesus Christ, be filled with
[2:12:44] the Holy Ghost, you're drunk until you
[2:12:45] leave the world. Joy unspeakable and
[2:12:48] full of glory is constant stimulation,
[2:12:51] constant
[2:12:52] intoxication, drunk night and day. Amen.
[2:12:59] Did you notice at the
[2:13:03] Passover that Jesus dipped the sap?
[2:13:09] That's good.
[2:13:12] I love it. Come on. He dipped this on.
[2:13:16] He didn't hand them dry bread.
[2:13:19] Hallelujah. There's too much dry bread
[2:13:22] being served today and the children are
[2:13:24] choking on it.
[2:13:26] So let's sit at the table with the
[2:13:29] filled with the spirit, the wine of God,
[2:13:31] eating the bread and flip it in an oil.
[2:13:36] And then hallelujah, you'll get to you
[2:13:38] go you'll get to doing things.
[2:13:40] Hallelujah. You'll go over and dip it
[2:13:42] over in the wine.
[2:13:44] get that stimulation of revelation.
[2:13:48] Hallelujah. And you'll start speaking
[2:13:50] yourself in psalms and hymns and
[2:13:52] spiritual songs and singing and making
[2:13:54] melody in your heart to the Lord and
[2:13:56] giving thanks all for all things to God.
[2:14:02] Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:14:05] Dip it. Dip the soop. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:14:10] Let it let let us be
[2:14:12] sufficiently in, you know, impressed
[2:14:15] with the word in our midst. I can have
[2:14:18] healing
[2:14:20] because it's in the word.
[2:14:23] His attitude toward healing and casting
[2:14:25] Satan out is the same as it was when he
[2:14:28] walked the shores of Galilee.
[2:14:30] That's right. I can have peace.
[2:14:34] Peace I leave with you. My peace I give
[2:14:36] to you. Not as the world giveth. give I
[2:14:39] to you. Let not your heart be troubled.
[2:14:42] Neither let it be afraid. Right.
[2:14:46] Amen. Brother Brandham said he's left
[2:14:48] this word behind on printed page. It's a
[2:14:50] part of him when it's taken by faith
[2:14:52] into a spiritfilled life. And then he
[2:14:55] goes on to say he said what so when a
[2:14:57] spirit born spiritfilled man and faith
[2:15:00] takes that word into his heart places it
[2:15:03] on his lips. That's the same as deity
[2:15:05] speaking. Every mountain has to go.
[2:15:08] Satan cannot stand before that man.
[2:15:13] Amen. Amen. He said again in the Pergam
[2:15:16] in the church age that today when the
[2:15:18] church returns to the word in faith, we
[2:15:21] can say without doubt that the glory of
[2:15:23] God and the wonderful acts of God will
[2:15:24] be in her midst again.
[2:15:26] And she will cuz she's that little faith
[2:15:29] woman. She must know her position as a
[2:15:33] princess, as that little faith woman.
[2:15:37] Amen. You've got to position yourself in
[2:15:40] the promise of the word and realize
[2:15:45] you're called to be here in this age in
[2:15:47] this time. And so the restoration
[2:15:50] promised is a restoration or a return to
[2:15:54] the word in faith. And of course, as he
[2:15:57] said, without doubt, the glory and
[2:15:59] wonderful acts of God will be in her. So
[2:16:02] the word is not just mere theology. It's
[2:16:06] the word and power. And Jesus said the
[2:16:09] word that I speak, they are spirit and
[2:16:13] they are life. So you see again we
[2:16:16] cannot just teach the word. Amen. We
[2:16:19] must preach the word with power. Are you
[2:16:23] with me? Amen. You see the difference
[2:16:25] between Jesus doctrine and the doctrine
[2:16:28] of the Pharisees was his was with
[2:16:30] authority and it cast Satan out.
[2:16:34] Amen. That's exactly right. You see,
[2:16:37] denominations will preach a word with no
[2:16:39] authority.
[2:16:41] But we got more than a theology today.
[2:16:45] And the proof that it is the word is
[2:16:47] there is an authority that goes with the
[2:16:49] word that cast Satan out.
[2:16:55] Yes, sir. The Bible said they were
[2:16:56] astonished in his doctrine because he
[2:16:58] taught as one having authority.
[2:17:01] Amen. In Marks 1:27, they were all
[2:17:04] amazed and so much they questioned among
[2:17:06] themselves, "What is this? What new
[2:17:08] doctrine is this? For with authority he
[2:17:10] commandeth unclean spirits, and they do
[2:17:12] obey him." You see, this doctrine gives
[2:17:15] you authority over devils. It doesn't
[2:17:18] strip us and make us powerless.
[2:17:22] Well, brother Tim, now I tell you what,
[2:17:25] we are revelated people. We got great
[2:17:27] revelation. We we absolutely know more
[2:17:31] than anybody else. Praise God.
[2:17:34] Yeah, that's knowledge.
[2:17:38] And it puffers up. But it's not
[2:17:41] revelation.
[2:17:43] It's the revelation of God that will
[2:17:46] give you authority over the devil.
[2:17:52] Amen. So knowledge comes from human
[2:17:55] ability. Revelation comes by the
[2:17:57] supernatural.
[2:18:00] Amen. And so now we are seated with him
[2:18:03] as he said with power and authority over
[2:18:05] every devil. If you can only believe
[2:18:08] what God has given, but if you're seated
[2:18:10] there, you will use it for you ordained
[2:18:12] to do what you're to do. Amen. So let's
[2:18:16] don't turn this message into a powerless
[2:18:19] religion. It's the word of God and it's
[2:18:22] alive.
[2:18:25] Amen. is the word of God is alive. The
[2:18:27] Bible said the word of God is quick.
[2:18:28] That don't mean it's fast. It means it's
[2:18:30] alive.
[2:18:32] It's living. It's powerful. It's sharper
[2:18:34] than any two-edged sword. All scripture
[2:18:37] is breathed out by God. And it's
[2:18:39] profitable for teaching, reprove, for
[2:18:41] correction, for training, and
[2:18:43] righteousness that the man of God should
[2:18:45] be complete, equipped for every good
[2:18:46] work. It has living power. And it's
[2:18:49] interjective,
[2:18:52] energetic, and and active. And it is our
[2:18:55] vision, right? Well, brother Tim, I I've
[2:18:59] never seen a vision. Well, don't feel
[2:19:02] like the Lone Ranger. I ain't seen many
[2:19:04] myself. You know, there's some may see
[2:19:07] visions more than others. Some of them,
[2:19:11] you know, they're all right as long as
[2:19:13] they're scriptural according to the
[2:19:14] word. But let me tell you about this
[2:19:16] vision. Brother Brandham said, "I read
[2:19:20] the Bible sometimes and I get up and run
[2:19:23] around the chair and scream to the top
[2:19:25] of my voice and I cry a little bit and I
[2:19:28] sit down and read a little more and get
[2:19:30] up and run around again." And I guess if
[2:19:32] the maid or somebody would come by,
[2:19:33] they'd think I had a maniac shut up in
[2:19:35] that room. But you know, I like it. No
[2:19:39] matter what I act like here, I just feel
[2:19:42] good. I'm going to another land. See,
[2:19:44] and I like to hear about it. And you
[2:19:47] listen now. You can see a vision anytime
[2:19:50] you look into the Bible.
[2:19:53] [Applause]
[2:19:55] Hallelujah.
[2:19:56] Amen. You've been seeing visions all
[2:19:58] along and didn't know it.
[2:20:02] Every time you look in the Bible, you
[2:20:04] are seeing a vision. You are seeing
[2:20:07] God's thoughts of you. Amen. Don't limit
[2:20:11] it to being a book of history, just a
[2:20:13] book of moral code, but it's a vision.
[2:20:16] It's a prophecy. And what did it say of
[2:20:17] you? He told you, "Search those
[2:20:20] scriptures. In them, you think they are
[2:20:22] eternal. You have eternal life. They are
[2:20:24] they that testify of me." You see, they
[2:20:27] testify of a bride in this end time.
[2:20:30] Amen. You can look in the scripture. I
[2:20:33] can look in the scripture and see that
[2:20:35] I'm raptured. Yes, sir.
[2:20:38] [Applause]
[2:20:40] I'm not left behind for the tribulation.
[2:20:43] I'm not going to make it. I've already
[2:20:46] made it.
[2:20:50] Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I am the
[2:20:52] resurrection." And you should be able to
[2:20:54] say, "I am the rapture."
[2:20:59] Somebody asked me one time, "Buddy Tim,
[2:21:01] with all this going on, you think we
[2:21:02] missed the rapture?" I said, "No, no, we
[2:21:05] ain't missed the rapture. I am the
[2:21:07] rapture.
[2:21:08] [Applause]
[2:21:10] Hallelujah. He can't take a bride
[2:21:12] without taking me. I'm part of it.
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:17] Amen. It's written. God has spoke of me.
[2:21:21] Amen. Now, you know, we we sometimes
[2:21:25] stagger at the truths of the word, but I
[2:21:28] want to tell you something. You know
[2:21:29] what faith is? It's simply believing
[2:21:32] that God will do what he said in his
[2:21:35] word that he would do.
[2:21:38] That is the truth. Amen. Amen.
[2:21:42] You see, this is what Sarah did. She
[2:21:45] judged him faithful who had promised.
[2:21:50] She believed that God would do what he
[2:21:53] said he would do. She didn't know how.
[2:21:56] She just knew that he would. And this is
[2:21:59] what Abraham did. Abraham simply
[2:22:01] believed that God would do what he said
[2:22:04] he would do. Amen. And God imputed to
[2:22:07] him for righteousness and he would not
[2:22:10] impute say sin to Sarah and neither will
[2:22:13] he impute sin to the bride.
[2:22:17] You're going to receive the son of
[2:22:18] promise. Jesus is coming back for you.
[2:22:22] Amen. in this evil day. In spite of the
[2:22:24] fact that you laughed,
[2:22:27] in spite of the fact that you have some
[2:22:29] sometimes said it's impossible for this
[2:22:31] old unbelieving church like me to be one
[2:22:33] that brings back uh brings Jesus back to
[2:22:36] earth. You know, now let me tell you,
[2:22:39] don't say I'm unworthy.
[2:22:42] Quit saying that.
[2:22:45] I'm not righteous enough. I just I I
[2:22:49] haven't done nothing to deserve it. But
[2:22:52] be happy that your iniquities are
[2:22:54] forgiven
[2:22:57] and that your sins are covered. Be happy
[2:23:00] and rejoice because the Lord will not
[2:23:02] impute sin to you.
[2:23:06] He said of you, you're without spot or
[2:23:08] wrinkle or blemish. You He said of you,
[2:23:10] you never did it in the first place.
[2:23:13] That's right. In my original thinking
[2:23:15] before the world began, you were that
[2:23:17] spotless, sinless bride. You're perfect
[2:23:20] in my eyes.
[2:23:25] Lord, there's a story all over the
[2:23:27] internet and other ministers have been
[2:23:29] spoke about it, but let me just talk
[2:23:30] about it. There was a a girl who others
[2:23:35] thought wasn't the prettiest of
[2:23:38] girls. She lived out, you know, on an
[2:23:42] island or
[2:23:44] some foreign
[2:23:46] country, you know, maybe a little more
[2:23:49] primitive than what we are here. But
[2:23:52] anyway,
[2:23:53] she was taught by everybody to be a
[2:23:57] little bit
[2:23:58] homely and very little worth and she
[2:24:02] always went down around with her head
[2:24:04] down and her shoulders drooping and
[2:24:07] could hardly look up at anybody, you
[2:24:10] know, always
[2:24:12] embarrassed. But there was a young man
[2:24:15] passed through her country and he was
[2:24:18] very wealthy and he was from a prominent
[2:24:21] family and he saw her and he loved her
[2:24:24] and he saw her potential
[2:24:28] and he went to her father and he offered
[2:24:31] 10 cows for this
[2:24:35] girl and that was an unheard of price.
[2:24:39] Come on. Nobody had ever paid 10 cows
[2:24:43] for a girl.
[2:24:44] The prettiest of girls were never worth
[2:24:47] more than two or three
[2:24:50] cows. And why? There were many in the
[2:24:53] village that thought a girl like this
[2:24:54] was only worth a goose and a
[2:24:59] chicken, you know. But he saw her and he
[2:25:03] loved her and he said, "I'll give
[2:25:07] something valuable for her. I'll give 10
[2:25:11] cows for this girl."
[2:25:14] And later on, you know, a year or so
[2:25:16] after marriage and she went on to his
[2:25:18] home place, she come back to hers. And
[2:25:20] when she come back, she came on a
[2:25:22] carriage, you know, and and and carried
[2:25:25] there into the village. And there she
[2:25:28] was. This regal girl with a crown on her
[2:25:31] head. This same girl they thought was a
[2:25:35] little worth came riding in a carriage
[2:25:38] with her royal apparel with dignity with
[2:25:41] her head held high, her shoulders back.
[2:25:45] Why? Because her husband
[2:25:49] saw value in her.
[2:25:51] [Applause]
[2:25:52] [Music]
[2:25:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Her husband saw value
[2:25:58] in her and it made her feel regal.
[2:26:02] She put her shoulders back, held her
[2:26:05] head up high.
[2:26:07] She was no longer this worthless girl.
[2:26:11] She was valuable.
[2:26:15] You know, God spoke of Israel in her
[2:26:17] restoration. And in Zephaniah 3:14, I
[2:26:21] don't know what translation I put down
[2:26:23] here, but you can try to follow along.
[2:26:25] Sing, oh daughter of Zion. Shout, O
[2:26:28] Israel, be glad and rejoice with all
[2:26:32] your heart, oh daughter of Jerusalem.
[2:26:35] The Lord had taken away your judgments.
[2:26:38] Oh, thank you, Jesus. He has cast out
[2:26:41] your enemies. The king of Israel, the
[2:26:44] Lord is in your midst.
[2:26:47] You will see disaster no more.
[2:26:51] In that day it'll be said to Jerusalem,
[2:26:54] "Do not fear. Zion, let not your hands
[2:26:58] be weak.
[2:27:00] The Lord your God is in your
[2:27:03] midst. The mighty one will save. He will
[2:27:07] rejoice over you with gladness. He will
[2:27:10] quite you with his love. He will rejoice
[2:27:14] over you with singing.
[2:27:21] Did you catch that? God sings.
[2:27:30] Oh, you hung up on me. Some of you just
[2:27:32] came back to church. Some of you just
[2:27:34] left. But those of you still here, God
[2:27:39] sings. Amen.
[2:27:42] Did you notice this? Let me tell you
[2:27:44] about this. God, you think his bride, he
[2:27:47] has chosen that we around here get a
[2:27:50] little emotional sometime.
[2:27:53] God is an emotional God.
[2:27:58] He ain't no dead pan.
[2:28:02] Come on now. He's an emotional God. He's
[2:28:05] not without feeling. And the Bible said,
[2:28:08] now I could list them, but you know, you
[2:28:11] know, you'd have to mince and eat a lot,
[2:28:14] but you know, God gets angry. That's an
[2:28:17] emotion.
[2:28:20] Mhm. The anger of the Lord has turned
[2:28:22] burned against people. God hates.
[2:28:28] You know what? I want to hate what God
[2:28:29] hates and love what he loves. But God
[2:28:32] hates, that's an emotion. You hate all
[2:28:34] those who do iniquity.
[2:28:36] God loves. That's an emotion. For God so
[2:28:39] loved the world that he gave his only
[2:28:42] begotten son.
[2:28:44] God has compassion. I will be gracious
[2:28:47] to whom I'll be gracious. I'll show
[2:28:49] compassion on whom I will show
[2:28:51] compassion. God grieavves.
[2:28:56] But they rebelled and grieved his Holy
[2:28:58] Spirit. I'm quoting you the Bible. God
[2:29:02] laughs.
[2:29:06] God expresses joy.
[2:29:09] And he he says his joy is our strength.
[2:29:14] God rejoices for he says, "As the
[2:29:16] bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so
[2:29:18] you will your God rejoice over you."
[2:29:23] And Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are
[2:29:26] God's workmanship."
[2:29:28] That we are his handiwork or his
[2:29:30] craftsmanship. We are his own master
[2:29:33] work. We are his work of art.
[2:29:40] Created in Christ Jesus to do good works
[2:29:44] which God prepared in advance for us to
[2:29:46] do. Do you know what that means? We are
[2:29:49] God's accomplishment.
[2:29:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, can you imagine?
[2:29:58] Can you imagine God doing bad
[2:30:02] workmanship?
[2:30:04] No, you can't. No. He's a master.
[2:30:10] He doesn't do bad work.
[2:30:14] Come on. So if you're still breathing,
[2:30:19] Yes. He's not through working on you.
[2:30:23] That's right. Amen.
[2:30:26] You are his workmanship.
[2:30:28] So he's working on you. But but brother
[2:30:31] Tim, my my faith is not too strong. Shut
[2:30:34] up. Just shut up. Let him work. He ain't
[2:30:38] through.
[2:30:42] You know you painting a wall over here
[2:30:44] and somebody you missed this box. Shut
[2:30:46] up. I get it.
[2:30:50] I know what I'm doing. This ain't my
[2:30:52] first paint job.
[2:30:54] And God says the same thing. You know,
[2:30:56] well, my faith is too strong. Shut up.
[2:30:59] Let me work.
[2:31:01] I know how to increase it.
[2:31:05] Well, I don't have much strength. I know
[2:31:06] how to fix it.
[2:31:09] I'm I'm working on it.
[2:31:12] Amen. And when he gets through with that
[2:31:14] little spot of mustard seed faith, that
[2:31:17] mustard seed faith will become rapturing
[2:31:20] faith.
[2:31:23] Amen. Are you with me? So God rejoices
[2:31:26] as he works.
[2:31:28] And he sings as he works.
[2:31:31] Oh yeah. He starts humming a song.
[2:31:35] [Music]
[2:31:37] You know, and he's working there and
[2:31:40] he's smoothing out wrinkles. You know
[2:31:43] you got some wrinkles.
[2:31:45] You know better than anybody, don't you?
[2:31:48] Blemish. Oh, that bitterness. Uh-uh.
[2:31:51] That ain't me.
[2:31:53] I got to work that out. He works it
[2:31:55] right out of you. No. No. None of that
[2:31:58] fear. That's not a me. I didn't put that
[2:32:00] in there. That's got to go. Nope. That
[2:32:03] ain't that ain't a part of my
[2:32:04] masterpiece.
[2:32:06] Amen. That unbelief, that ain't a me.
[2:32:08] Watch that out. Oh, here's a little
[2:32:11] secret sin. Nope. I can't let this
[2:32:14] lukewarm warmness be in my bride. That's
[2:32:16] a blemish. Let's get rid of it. and he
[2:32:19] washes it out. Washing by the water of
[2:32:22] the word and washing out all
[2:32:25] imperfection.
[2:32:26] And as God works, God smiles.
[2:32:31] And he sings
[2:32:34] as he forms his bride
[2:32:36] and he delights in her. Oh, and he sings
[2:32:41] as he works, smoothing out all the
[2:32:44] wrinkles, cleansing out every sin, all
[2:32:48] unbelief. And as he sings, he's looking
[2:32:51] toward his future.
[2:32:54] Oh, I want to see
[2:32:57] her and look upon her
[2:33:00] face. And there I'll sing
[2:33:04] forever of her beauty and her
[2:33:07] grace. And on the streets of glory we'll
[2:33:11] shout and we'll
[2:33:14] embrace. Satan's bound. My bride is
[2:33:17] crowned. Together we'll lift our voice.
[2:33:21] And he sings loudly. Did you know that?
[2:33:24] The Bible said in Zephaniah 3, he will
[2:33:27] exalt over you with loud singing.
[2:33:31] God gets loud when he sings and he says,
[2:33:34] "Oh, I want to see her happy and
[2:33:38] complete
[2:33:39] there with me forever. My raptured bride
[2:33:44] shall be. We'll honeymoon together for a
[2:33:48] thousand years of peace. Sin will be all
[2:33:52] passed. We'll reign at last throughout
[2:33:56] all eternity.
[2:33:58] [Applause]
[2:34:02] Hallelujah. So he works on you as he
[2:34:05] sings. Now what do you got to do? You
[2:34:08] got to quit the wrong
[2:34:10] thinking. Well, Jesus couldn't love
[2:34:12] somebody like me. It's not for me. I've
[2:34:14] got too many blemishes. I can't live it.
[2:34:17] I'll never be perfect. My faith is so
[2:34:19] little. I'll never be raptured. You
[2:34:21] know, you're talking the devil's
[2:34:22] language.
[2:34:24] That's not God's language. You know that
[2:34:26] you need you need to tell the devil that
[2:34:28] he's going to be brought to zero.
[2:34:32] And when you say that, you look down
[2:34:34] when you do it because he's already
[2:34:36] beneath your feet.
[2:34:39] Hallelujah.
[2:34:41] Now Sarah's thoughts displeased God.
[2:34:45] Because without faith, it's impossible
[2:34:47] to please him. I It's impossible for me
[2:34:50] to be a mother. I I passed up that
[2:34:52] opportunity long ago. I never had a
[2:34:55] another had another chance. You know, I
[2:34:57] was prayed for. You know, Brother Tim, I
[2:34:59] walked in victory for 6 months and and
[2:35:01] now I'm all sick again and and God
[2:35:04] healed me and I rejoice and somehow my
[2:35:06] faith got away from me and I lost my
[2:35:08] healing. Oh, is that so? Well, let me
[2:35:11] tell you about a man one time that Jesus
[2:35:14] called to come walk on water.
[2:35:17] This man didn't walk on water once. He
[2:35:19] walked on water twice. That's right.
[2:35:22] The first time he walked on water, he
[2:35:24] got his eyes on the wrong thing. On the
[2:35:27] billers and the rays and all the winds
[2:35:29] and the storms and the lightning bolts.
[2:35:31] And he got his eyes off of Jesus and he
[2:35:33] started drowning. But you know what? He
[2:35:35] took his eyes off the storm and put it
[2:35:37] back on Jesus and said, "Jesus, don't
[2:35:39] you, you know, reach out. Do you care
[2:35:41] that I perish?" And Jesus reached out a
[2:35:43] hand to him and Peter walked on water
[2:35:45] twice. I'm telling you, if you have
[2:35:48] fallen,
[2:35:50] You once walked on your water. You once
[2:35:53] walked in victory. You can walk again.
[2:35:56] God is a God of first chances, second
[2:35:59] chances, third chances, fourth chances,
[2:36:01] fifth chances. God is a God who will not
[2:36:04] give up on his elect. He has not given
[2:36:07] up on you tonight, today. And he will
[2:36:09] not give up on you anytime.
[2:36:12] Yes, sir.
[2:36:14] Against all odds, we have to believe.
[2:36:18] Amen.
[2:36:20] Now, we're going to have to be convinced
[2:36:23] of his promise. And I want to tell you
[2:36:25] what, I'm convinced.
[2:36:28] I'm convinced. When I lay hands on the
[2:36:30] sick, they shall recover.
[2:36:32] I'm convinced. Not because of the magic
[2:36:34] or the mystic power of my hands, but
[2:36:36] because he said I would do this. When I
[2:36:39] command evil spirits to leave, they're
[2:36:41] going to leave. Not because I'm a holy
[2:36:44] man. And so with a perfect record, my
[2:36:46] righteous because but because my
[2:36:48] righteousness is of him and he said of
[2:36:51] me in my name, you'll cast the devils
[2:36:53] out.
[2:36:54] Amen. That's the faith of a trueborn
[2:36:58] Christian. Amen. Let's just try to bring
[2:37:01] this
[2:37:02] down. Sarah kept looking at herself.
[2:37:07] But one
[2:37:07] day when the angel came, it caused her
[2:37:12] not to look at herself anymore, but to
[2:37:15] begin to look at the promise.
[2:37:18] And the Bible said
[2:37:21] she receives truth because she judged
[2:37:27] him faithful.
[2:37:32] Now, she had not been faithful.
[2:37:35] Right.
[2:37:37] She had doubted. She had lied in the
[2:37:39] face of God.
[2:37:41] But when she turned away from what she
[2:37:45] was to what he is
[2:37:49] and she judged him faithful who gave the
[2:37:53] promise. That's what gave her strength.
[2:37:56] That's right. Amen. So you see again th
[2:38:00] this is exactly where the bride will
[2:38:02] receive strength when she gets her eyes
[2:38:05] back on Jesus and she looks at the
[2:38:08] promise instead of the problem. Amen.
[2:38:11] And she begins to speak the promise
[2:38:14] instead of talk about the problem.
[2:38:18] Come on. When you make your problem
[2:38:19] bigger than God Amen. then you really
[2:38:22] got a problem. You got to get your eyes
[2:38:25] back on the promise. Sarah had made her
[2:38:29] situation bigger than God. And God said,
[2:38:31] "Is there anything too hard for me?" And
[2:38:34] that's what God's saying to you today.
[2:38:36] Is there anything too hard for the Lord?
[2:38:38] That's right. There's nothing too hard.
[2:38:41] No situation, no problem.
[2:38:45] Amen. You know, he's a good good father.
[2:38:50] As a boy, I was afraid of my daddy. I
[2:38:54] really was. When he come home from
[2:38:57] work, we
[2:38:59] scattered. I longed for his approval,
[2:39:02] but I found none. You know, he was a
[2:39:05] good man. He did many great things for
[2:39:08] me, and I appreciate that. But, you
[2:39:12] know, I could never measure
[2:39:13] up. I could never meet his
[2:39:17] approval. But you know
[2:39:20] what? When I became a father, I broke
[2:39:23] the cycle.
[2:39:27] I want my children to know they're my
[2:39:29] joy.
[2:39:31] That I'm proud of them. My girls, and I
[2:39:34] have three of them. They're all
[2:39:35] Christian, great Christian girls.
[2:39:38] They're daddy's girls.
[2:39:40] My son, you know him. He's my pride.
[2:39:44] He's the apple of my eye as my girls
[2:39:47] are. They don't have to guess about it.
[2:39:50] I tell them that.
[2:39:53] I tell them that they are loved. You
[2:39:55] know, any man who can't tell his sons
[2:39:56] and daughters that they're loved is not
[2:39:58] a father. He's only he, you know, he not
[2:40:01] only tells them, he shows them, he
[2:40:03] expresses it. And this all goes on down
[2:40:06] to my grandsons. I don't even call them
[2:40:08] my grandsons. I said, "These are my
[2:40:09] sons."
[2:40:12] They too are my sons. My granddaughters,
[2:40:14] they are my daughters. And papa's proud.
[2:40:18] Amen. They make me proud. I'm a proud
[2:40:20] that I'm their papa. Amen. I don't want
[2:40:23] them afraid of me. I want them to trust
[2:40:25] me. I want them to love me.
[2:40:30] Amen. Under the law, you know, there was
[2:40:31] only on one birth. You know, a man could
[2:40:33] be birthed under sin, but there was no
[2:40:35] new birth that could birth you into
[2:40:37] righteousness. But in the New Testament,
[2:40:39] that's not so. We got a new birth. And
[2:40:41] that birth places us in a relationship
[2:40:44] to God that we are actually his
[2:40:46] offspring.
[2:40:49] Now, I want to tell you, God wants to
[2:40:50] bless his people. Now, I'm going to read
[2:40:53] you some blessings if you'll go with me.
[2:40:55] Oh, I I didn't put the reference down,
[2:40:57] but it's chapter 28 somewhere. Maybe
[2:40:59] it's Deuteronomy. And it shall come to
[2:41:01] pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
[2:41:04] unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to
[2:41:06] observe and to do all the commandments
[2:41:09] which I command thee this day, that the
[2:41:11] Lord thy God will set thee on high above
[2:41:13] all the nations of the earth. and all
[2:41:16] these blessings shall come on thee and
[2:41:19] overtake thee. Did you get that?
[2:41:21] Blessings are going to overtake you. You
[2:41:24] see, surely goodness and mercy is going
[2:41:27] to chase after me all the days of my
[2:41:29] life.
[2:41:31] Come on. That's Psalms 23. Amen. Watch
[2:41:34] now. And he says in verse two, "And all
[2:41:36] these blessings will come on thee and
[2:41:38] overtake thee if thou should hearken to
[2:41:40] the voice of the Lord thy God. Blessed
[2:41:42] shalt thou be in the city,
[2:41:45] and blessed thou shalt thou be in the
[2:41:47] field, and blessed shall be the fruit of
[2:41:50] thy body, and the fruit of thy ground,
[2:41:52] and the fruit of thy cattle, and the
[2:41:54] increase of thy kind, and the flocks of
[2:41:57] thy sheep, and blessed shalt thou be thy
[2:41:59] basket, and their store, and blessed
[2:42:02] shalt thou be when thou comest in, and
[2:42:04] blessed shalt thou be when you goeth
[2:42:06] out. And the Lord shall cause thy
[2:42:08] enemies that rise up against thee to be
[2:42:10] smitten before thy face, and they shall
[2:42:13] come out against thee one way, and flee
[2:42:15] before you seven ways.
[2:42:19] Somebody ought to say, "Mama, that's
[2:42:21] me."
[2:42:22] Amen. The Lord shall command the
[2:42:24] command, command the blessing upon thee,
[2:42:27] upon thy storehouse, and all that
[2:42:29] settlest on thy hands unto and thou
[2:42:33] shall be blessed thee in the land which
[2:42:34] the Lord thy God giveth thee. And the
[2:42:37] Lord shall establish thee as a holy
[2:42:39] people and himself as he sworn unto
[2:42:41] thee. If thou keep the commandments of
[2:42:43] the Lord, that God walk in his way. And
[2:42:45] all the people of the earth that see
[2:42:46] thee shall be called by see that thou
[2:42:49] art called by the name of the Lord, and
[2:42:50] they shall be afraid of thee. And the
[2:42:52] Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods,
[2:42:54] and the fruit of thy body, and the fruit
[2:42:55] of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
[2:42:56] ground, and in the land which the Lord
[2:43:00] swear unto thy fathers to give thee. And
[2:43:02] the Lord shall open unto thee his good
[2:43:05] treasure the heaven to give rain unto
[2:43:07] thy land and his season to bless all the
[2:43:09] work of thy hand. And thou shall lend
[2:43:11] unto many nations and thou shalt not
[2:43:13] borrow. Is somebody getting anything out
[2:43:15] of this? And the Lord shall make thee
[2:43:18] the head
[2:43:20] and not the tail, and thou shalt be
[2:43:22] above only and thou shalt not be
[2:43:25] beneath. If thou shalt hearken to the
[2:43:27] commandments of the Lord thy God which I
[2:43:29] command thee this day to observe and to
[2:43:30] do them. And thou shalt not go aside
[2:43:32] from any of my words which I command
[2:43:34] thee this day to the right hand of the
[2:43:36] left after other to go after other gods
[2:43:39] to serve them. If however you do not
[2:43:42] obey the Lord your God by carefully
[2:43:44] following the commandments and statutes
[2:43:46] I'm giving you today, all these curses
[2:43:49] will come upon you and overtake you. And
[2:43:53] you will be cursed in the city and
[2:43:55] cursed in the country. And your basket
[2:43:57] and the kneading bowl shall be cursed.
[2:43:59] And the fruit of your womb will be
[2:44:01] cursed as the produce of your lamb. And
[2:44:04] the calves of your herds and the lambs
[2:44:07] of your flock. And you'll be cursed when
[2:44:09] you come in and cursed when you go out.
[2:44:12] And I just want to say stop.
[2:44:16] Jesus.
[2:44:19] Galatians 3:13.
[2:44:21] Yes.
[2:44:22] Christ has redeemed us from the curse of
[2:44:27] the law being made a curse for us. For
[2:44:31] it is written, "Cursed is everyone that
[2:44:33] hangeth upon a
[2:44:35] tree."
[2:44:37] Hallelujah. None of the
[2:44:39] curses, none of the curses, none of the
[2:44:43] curses apply to you. Jesus took your
[2:44:47] curse, only the blessings.
[2:44:53] Oh, the blessings.
[2:45:00] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:45:03] My God. We could read all the way
[2:45:05] through Romans chapter 8, and you can do
[2:45:07] it later. But I want to tell you
[2:45:10] friends, we're not a cursed people. He
[2:45:13] took our curse.
[2:45:15] [Applause]
[2:45:18] I want you to get it. Amen. Yes, we
[2:45:20] should have been killed. We should have
[2:45:22] been wiped out. But grace overtook us
[2:45:28] [Music]
[2:45:29] if it were not for grace. Hallelujah.
[2:45:34] Hallelujah. Now I'm closing.
[2:45:39] You've been wanting to hear that a long
[2:45:40] time.
[2:45:43] Genesis 21 and1. This is good.
[2:45:48] And the Lord did visit Sarah
[2:45:52] as he had said. And the Lord said to
[2:45:54] Sarah, did to Sarah as he had
[2:45:58] spoken. God fulfilled his promise,
[2:46:00] didn't he? For Sarah conceived and bare
[2:46:03] Abraham a son in his old age, at the set
[2:46:07] time of which God had spoken to him. And
[2:46:12] Abraham called the name of his son that
[2:46:14] was born to him, who Sarah bare to him,
[2:46:18] Isaac. And Abraham circumcised his son
[2:46:21] Isaac, being 8 days old, as God had
[2:46:24] commanded him. And Abraham was 100 years
[2:46:28] old when his son Isaac was born in him.
[2:46:32] And Sarah said, "Watch. God hath made up
[2:46:37] me to laugh,
[2:46:40] so that all that hear me will laugh with
[2:46:43] me."
[2:46:45] And said, "He who should have said
[2:46:47] unto," and she said, "Who would have
[2:46:50] said to Abraham that Sarah would have
[2:46:52] given children to suck? For I have borne
[2:46:55] him a son in his old
[2:46:58] age." Now, let me tell you something,
[2:47:00] church.
[2:47:01] Yeah, Sarah laughed at the
[2:47:04] promise and should have been
[2:47:07] destroyed, but she not only had grace
[2:47:10] over that life, she had the last laugh.
[2:47:17] And there's an old proverb that says,
[2:47:19] "He that lasts
[2:47:21] lasts best."
[2:47:26] Hallelujah. But here she looked now at
[2:47:29] this promised son and said, "God has
[2:47:33] made me to laugh." The first time I was
[2:47:36] laughing in my unbelief. Now I am
[2:47:39] laughing cuz God have made me to laugh.
[2:47:42] Oh hallelujah, brother. We are about to
[2:47:46] get the last laugh.
[2:47:48] Are you with me? Somebody help me preach
[2:47:51] right here. We're going to get the last
[2:47:53] laugh.
[2:47:55] Amen. when I when I see when I watched
[2:47:58] my wife, you know, gasping her last
[2:48:01] breath and taking her last breath. But
[2:48:04] brother, that was that was what the
[2:48:05] devil did do. But I'm going to get the
[2:48:07] last laugh.
[2:48:09] Amen. I'll see her young again in a
[2:48:12] vibrant body, never to age, never to get
[2:48:15] sick again. Somebody help me preach.
[2:48:18] Amen. I'm going to have the last laugh.
[2:48:21] Amen. The devil has laughed at me and
[2:48:23] mocked at me and tried to disqualify me.
[2:48:26] You're not good enough and you're, you
[2:48:27] know, you're lame in your feet and
[2:48:29] you've got this and you got problems and
[2:48:31] others have discredited me, but I'm
[2:48:33] going to have the last laugh.
[2:48:35] [Applause]
[2:48:36] You ain't seen nothing yet. Amen. The
[2:48:39] devil's been laughing about this cancer,
[2:48:41] about our brother Ron, but we're about
[2:48:43] to get our last laugh.
[2:48:49] Hallelujah. Oh yeah, brother Tim. The
[2:48:51] 15y old boy preacher's getting gray in
[2:48:54] his head. Let me tell you, I'm going to
[2:48:56] get the last laugh.
[2:48:58] You ain't see me yet when I put on my
[2:49:01] new clothes. Hallelujah. When I get my
[2:49:04] new body, when I get that that that
[2:49:07] matches my soul. Amen. I'm going to get
[2:49:09] a body that was never lied in, never
[2:49:12] smoked in, never drunk in. Amen. That
[2:49:14] was never sin in, never evil thought in.
[2:49:17] I'm going to have a body that's a
[2:49:19] masterpiece to my soul. Yeah, I'm about
[2:49:22] to get the last laugh. Amen. I tell you,
[2:49:25] you are about to get that last laugh.
[2:49:27] God's going to give you a life over that
[2:49:28] sickness. You're going to rejoice cuz
[2:49:30] you're healed. You're going to rejoice
[2:49:32] cuz your children are coming back in.
[2:49:34] I'm prophesying over you. I am telling
[2:49:37] you what the word said. You will be
[2:49:39] blessed in the field. You will be
[2:49:40] blessed coming out. You'll be blessed
[2:49:42] going in. All that you will do will be
[2:49:44] blessed. Come on, church.
[2:49:47] You are about to get the last laugh.
[2:49:49] Yes, sir.
[2:49:52] Hallelujah.
[2:49:53] I'm going to be like a new kid in my new
[2:49:55] clothes. Amen. I'll tell you what. I'm
[2:49:58] going to look over here and I'm going to
[2:50:00] see a redheaded Ron Spencer. Amen. And
[2:50:04] I'm going to grab him and I'm going to
[2:50:06] dance with him. We're going to be like
[2:50:08] little boys in our new clothes. Amen.
[2:50:11] We're going to say ain't no devil, ain't
[2:50:13] no demon ever able to pull us down. We
[2:50:17] are more than conquerors in Christ.
[2:50:19] We're going to dance. We're going to
[2:50:20] shout. We're going to rejoice. We are
[2:50:23] more than conquered than
[2:50:26] heaven.
[2:50:28] Hallelujah. Now, start rejoicing
[2:50:32] now cuz you can prophesy. You're going
[2:50:36] to laugh over your
[2:50:40] enemies.
[2:50:42] Hallelujah. The enemies you see, you'll

[2:50:52] victory. You don't have to let that
[2:50:54] sickness control you. You control that
[2:50:57] sickness. Laugh over it right now. I'm
[2:51:00] more than conqueror
[2:51:03] through him that loved me. God bless
[2:51:06] you, church.
[2:51:19] Amen. Those were two different mountains
[2:51:22] there in Deuteronomy 28. There was a
[2:51:24] there was a mountain on the left and a
[2:51:26] mountain on the right. And the children
[2:51:27] of Israel passed between those mountains
[2:51:29] going in the promised land. And God had
[2:51:32] Moses appoint a group of men to stand on
[2:51:34] the mount of cursing. And it was a group
[2:51:36] of men that stood on the mount of
[2:51:38] blessing. And while the people passed
[2:51:40] into the land, they would scream out the
[2:51:42] cursing from one mountain and they would
[2:51:44] scream out the blessing from another
[2:51:46] mountain. And I tell you, when I began
[2:51:48] to read that as a young man, I said,
[2:51:50] "God, you never anointed me to stand on
[2:51:52] the bless the mountain of cursing to
[2:51:54] your bride. You anointed me to stand on
[2:51:57] that mountain of blessing where we
[2:51:59] prophesy blessing over this church."
[2:52:02] Amen. The Bible said, "Prophesy again
[2:52:04] over these people." Amen. And I
[2:52:06] certainly believe God has blessed us
[2:52:08] today. Amen. How many enjoyed the word
[2:52:10] of God today? Amen. What a
[2:52:13] blessing. What an absolute blessing.
