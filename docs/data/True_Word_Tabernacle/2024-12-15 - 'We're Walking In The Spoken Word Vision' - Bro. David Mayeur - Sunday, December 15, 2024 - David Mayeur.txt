thank brother Ron and Brother David for coming for these meetings what a tremendous blessing amen and uh it's it's always such a great honor to have men of God that are willing to come and and to share their life experiences and there when you hear a man speak like that you're you're getting not just a sermon you're getting a summary of experience in life and and uh when he starts talking about the you know the squirrels uh the devil said to brother BR the woods are full of them we everyone had that moment in our life the woods are full of them you know we've had that uh you know well it would have just been this way or something would have happened but you know God knows exactly amen his great experience in our life and what he's done for us and it's such a great time to be here this morning and amen in his presence and we're U we want to take just a moment and thank uh uh uh Brother Richard grills for his work here at the church I don't know if he's in the room or not maybe yet he's there with the Sunday School uh but we we sure want to thank Brother Richard I don't know if you all uh know how much involvement Brother Richard has but he's representing the church here uh with the Bible Believers School they're having some difficulties of course changing of times Seasons Everything Changes right and uh so they're having some um transitional uh Seasons that they're going from one way of funding to another and they're doing a lot of fundraisings and things and brother uh Richard is actually uh he's representing this assembly in that situation so anything happening he just comes and talks to us and that we we certainly appreciate him it's all volunteer work so we thank him for being involved and uh but they have a few things they're doing if you want to know how to help uh the government's made some ways for you to make some donations that are tax credits and also they're doing uh different type of fundraisings I think they just had the mums that they did and amen I got involved in that I like those Ms and but then I think they're doing something with Panda Express today but any if you um to today after church so if you want to know something about that see brother Richard or on the back wall back there on the buling board there's something there where you can just look at that and see amen and we're here at the assembly I I think better than half of Bible believer school is now true word Tabernacle so we we're heavily supporting the school so amen so we certainly want to see that success of that and amen but we certainly appreciate Brother Richard thank you for your labors there and amen I know it's not yeah cuz you never had such a hard day do you had to ask a pastor for money and and he's he's he's come to me twice very so God bless him amen for his for his labors and we have a very special day today uh brother David's going to be speaking for us but just before we get there we have a uh we have a very special day today for uh brother Austin and sister Destiny I don't know where they are they're usually on this side so they're back there in the back amen uh sorry about the seating it all changes doesn't it amen that's a good problem to have amen so Brother Richard also because of the way the seating is we have a Bible study that the young people go to Just prior and during the first part of the service and we had a problem is some of these young guys and some of these young girls that were going to Bible study when they come out they don't have a seat so if you come out now and you see a little sign laying in a seat and says this seat belongs to Ella Ericson she's in Bible study don't get upset at Ella that's just the way we come up with the try to uh to to let them both be in Bible study and no you can't get one of them for everybody I seen you look at me David David's like H you got to come early for Bible study get one and then and there's a age limit on Bible study so it's we so but uh so it is it is a real honor that Destiny and Austin uh are here with us as a part of this assembly it's a it's a great honor to have them their parents uh his parents brother Rodney and sister Suzanne is here as well today amen they're over there okay all the way in that corner and it is such an honor to have them and amen they have a a baby dedication today with Caleb Eugene Ooa amen and we're we're so happy to be a part of that now here we don't sprinkle babies or baptize babies but we do dedicate them to the Lord and we won't take this time today amen I don't know if sister Brenda is here today sister Brenda's here today is I don't know about brother Eddie if he's in no he's not here so it's sister Brenda today amen and so we got a grandma on one side and grandparents both on the other side and we thank the Lord Lord amen that he would Supply family to help and secure the future of this child and be around them and we certainly so appreciated I wonder if we could sing that little song together this morning amen as they would get ready to come and we would we would make little Caleb Eugene welcome in the house of the Lord but also that we just bring and dedicate him to the Lord this morning amen Amen brother Ben [Music] bring bring [Music] [Music] that believer [Music] look at this your children children's children amen amen let's just bow father we bow our hearts here this morning as we bring little Caleb to you and this Ooa family Lord the Robison family as they gather together around it I pray Lord that your grace Lord would just be upon the little man and father as you make Caleb such a a warrior and such a solid believer we pray Lord that your anointing be upon this young man as we bring him to you to dedicate him to you today we pray Lord may you just dispatch your angels around him Lord father give him blessings and mercies and bless the home Lord and I pray for this young family that you would give them grace and mercy Mercy Lord as we dedicate him to you today Father we commit this in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you for it father amen and amen amen maybe just one [Music] amen Caleb was a mighty warrior wasn't he I remember the first time I got this studying on Caleb and when Moses gave him property he counted it as a title deed amen he didn't have a piece of paper but he had Moses's words he could have it you know and when I found out he was a gentile and that he was able to get into the promise through the tribe of Judah well I tell you that was shouting material right there amen cuz that's exactly how this Gentile Church got into the promises of God it was through that tribe of Judah amen y'all know that Judah amen that that's that's the one that Rahab married into right she married into it and that's the tribe of praise and that's the reason I believe that praise comes so easily to the Gentile church and when the Bible speaks of the Tabernacle of David being lifted up again it was a tabernacle of praise and I believe this morning what a what a beautiful time to praise the Lord whatever season you're in whatever time in your life it's always a good time to praise the Lord amen can we just stand to our feet this morning and we're going to invite Brother David to come amen and we trust the Lord has has uh done something Mighty for you already this weekend but we're just praying that his Spirit might just say something this morning to to bring that to that very moment you know uh uh Friday night one of the brothers came by to to me there and he said uh he said I was watching Brother David preach there and he said I had just told my family about Moses meeting that burning bush and he said when that guy was up there preaching he said I seen a man on fire he said I was telling my family to watch that burning bush preach again amen I thought is that that's powerful thought amen and amen and he happened to his name was Brother David too amen so we're going to invite a burning bush to the platform this morning amen and we ask that you just take your shoes off as it were not really but but as it were and invite the presence of the Lord amen Amen Brother David as you come this morning every praise is to our God every word of worship in one Accord Every Praise every praise is to our God [Music] every praise is to our God oh every word of worship in one Accord Every Praise every praise is to our God sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah to our God yes Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Every Praise every praise is to our God God my savior God my [Applause] savior God my healer God my deliverer oh

Hallelujah to our god Glory Hallelujah Every Praise every praise is to our God hallelujah every praise is to my God he is my healer he is my savior he is my all and all and all my praise is to my God isn't he wonderful isn't he worthy of all our praise amen we were created to worship Him amen so I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of my Lord Jesus I'm not ashamed to give glory to God Amen because I'm getting ready there won't be silence there there will be worship amen holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty amen amen amen so this morning amen God gives another us another opportunity to give praise to our God Amen I was just reading amen how many Nightingales do we have here this morning if you don't know what it is you can look it up the prophet tells us when he was looking up what a nighting gale was he says no matter how dark the night is so no matter what happened between last night and this morning I know Satan isy is is trying to do everything to stop us from giving praise to our God so no matter how dark the night may be if The Nightingales just see a star he has to worship and if you ask the little star why are you shining I am shining because the sun is shining upon me and the nigh and Gale recognizes and that's why he worship us listen he says well that's what the matter with the old time Holy Ghost Born Again oldfashioned camp meeting weekend meeting it ain't about brother Ron about Brother David no no God God is on the scene God is still the same Hallelujah am and call me oldfashioned call me oldfashioned if you want but you know what one day you're going to call me godone I'm getting ready for a Rapture and it's closer than we can think it's closer than even your theology can cuz you can't put God in a box amen he says an oldfashioned kind meeting revivalist it's not them people excited but R it's not them people excited amen it's the power of God shining on them Hallelujah shining out giving light and I'm telling you there are a lot of Nightingales in the Holy Ghost Church that when they see the first ray of light Glory Glory Glory when they see the first ray of light they ring out the Praises of God hallelujah oh and he said if they could hold their peace these rocks will cry out I often tell the Saints who wants to be replaced by a rock not me God gave me these vocal cords and like David would say everything how many do we have people here that are breeding but everything that have breath praise ye the Lord amen so I'm a n Andale this morning amen because I see the light bright shining so I can shout I can Rejoice brother Wayne was talking about oh yes we happily Rejoice we happily shout give me that oldtime religion it's good enough for me it was good for brother brandham oh it's certain good for me hallelujah hallelujah so to God be all the praise amen once again I want to thank you for being a blessing to me I said that with all my heart amen really you've blessed my wife and I even the first time we came here several years back said oh my that's the church we want to be it I say that in all honesty you know why I love to worship not just making noise not just an emotion but a reality amen because the pure word is being spoken and there's something on the inside saying amen and the more I praise the more I water the word with praise the more the word changes me amen so certainly it's a great honor for me to be standing before the redeemed once again amen yes you stole our hearts but it's it's a good thing we're family amen We Are One glorious family and it's wonderful you even ordered snow for when we landed cuz we come from France Switzerland so we have snow there so thank you for that amen so thank you once again brother Wayne Brother Ray for the trust the love and uh yes putting me here it's it's quite an honor really to be standing here so may God bless us this morning amen as we go to the word and what can we say about last night my you know every moment we spend in the presence of the Lord we should be so thankful because the prophet tells us when the last one comes in when the Rapture will take place then the holy spirit will be taken think of it people will still preach the message they will even preach the Rapture but it will be over so every moment we have that we can spend in the presence of the Lord is a privilege a Grace that God gives us so this morning amen we want to take our time and see how the Lord leads amen uh if we can open our Bibles to Romans 8 just going to read one verse Verse 18 say Amen when you're there amen for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us how many can say Amen to that am but the David I'm going through a hard time yes there's no trial above what you can take and through the trial God gives you strength but it's not comparable to the glory that God will reveal in us hallelujah second Peter 1 verse three according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so God has the desire for us to be part partakers I love that word one final scripture in Isaiah 16 verse 1 and two the lord gave me that yesterday afternoon so by God's grace we just going to continue you know that's what God does it's perfect you know brother Ron Brother David or I've been with brother Wayne on on the field and and it's not let's talk and and see what we can preach on so this is not an orchestration by man but it's an orchestration by God Amen so the lord gave me and we're going to speak on that this morning so Isaiah 60 arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and grows Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee may God add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord once again Lord we want to say thank you Father for the privilege you gave us Lord to be gathered here and to be standing on Holy Ground because you said there where two or three are gathered in your name you are with us so father we pray L May you take full control now of the service Lord may you anoint the speaker may you anoint the hearer Lord those that are present those that are streaming father you know each and every one father and Lord God I pray Lord as the word is going forward Lord may you give a deeper Revelation to each and everyone father to what your plan is for our lives and father Lord may we as the word goes forward Lord just worship you in spirit and in truth so that this word father transforms us from glory to glory Lord I pray may you bless the pastor brother Wayne may you bless the Elder may you bless the officers Lord may you bless the whole church Lord God lord how what a blessing they are father so not just locally father but the bride around the world so father we thank you for your goodness so may you take everything under your control we ask these things in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated so brother Ron he spoke yesterday amen I love his title not only the title amen but I I do like when when when I prepare a sermon to have a good title so you know brother R he says sight into an unseen real amen so he he was speaking how you know it wasn't a Christmas sermon we know we're getting closer to Christmas and that's just a day we put aside we know it wasn't Christmas you you've been taught well amen but he he mentioned it's a season of light and although there's gross Darkness upon the Earth the word of God tells us that the glory of God will be revealed in us so God has a plan and by God's grace we're going to see what God's plan is just like I said Friday because when the bride knows amen who she is so there's something about realizing what we are doing here right now and what's God's plan is for our lives amen so this is a season season of light we can look around and people they put nice lights everywhere cuz we're getting close to Christmas and and they forgot the real meaning of the light amen so it's the same in Europe amen but God's light amen the prophet says that's his word amen th thy light is a word that will guide me in everything amen so light was born a Christmas day amen so we know without life when he said let there be light that was God's word so without light amen the Esther's there's no life without sunlight we wouldn't have any plants the greenhouse we can give all we can all the vitamins but without the sunlight there wouldn't be any nice flowers any plants any vegetables nothing no existence so everything on our planet depends on the sun rising every day and producing its energy raise now that's the natural now what about the spiritual the raise of the s o n that brings the seed to maturity that's why we need to ripen under the presence of the s o n and that's what is going on right now I don't want to go ahead of myself amen so the prophet says what is light is the Vindicated spoken word of God Amen so let the light shine this morning amen so we see as I as I Was preparing amen as a title I forgot my title we are walking in this spoken word vision and I was thinking brother brother Ron gave several testimonies of our precious brother Ed amen who who had a privilege to to to be with brother Brandon amen and experience amen the the reality of God Amen I remember as he he told me personally the the the the the testimony of how he was hunting with with brother brandham and and and there was a vision and brother brother ad didn't even realize he was in the vision his wife precious sister Ruth prepared his bag amen and here brother brother Bram tells and and and this will happen and that will happen and something happened that brother Ed had to change his shirt you see how God orchestrate things he didn't realize it when he woke up and all of a sudden he goes goes in the back takes out a shirt puts it on and there's a green Checker chur Hallelujah he was walking in division right then and nothing can stop the word of God from manifesting amen so well Brother David what does this has to do with us okay no problem we'll get there let me give you another spoken word Vision amen pertaining to us amen I told you and the Bible is full of types that's why when the word was being open Amen brother brand says this book has become a new Bible amen he saw every type Christ and his bride amen and we see how elaser amen how eleazer he had to go amen Abraham calls him and say I want for Isaac I want a a precious bride I don't want those girls from no I want a pure virtuous bride so we see we can you can read it and I want it's a sermon in itself but how amen how he made uh an oath think of it elazer in the Bible you can read it he had to put his hands under his thigh amen meaning it was a sign of surrender a sign of submission even Jacob did the same thing when he made the oath with his son Joseph that I don't want to be buried there I want to be buried in canadan so it was a type you know what it also represent that under the tie it was considered the source of post posterity life if you surrender he is our head and if we surrender life will flow freely so we see how elaser has to go amen think of it naturally you go to a country and you need to find a bride and there's so many quotes and I don't want to go in there but I love it because while he's praying God is already moving because the prophet says that Rebecca came under the anointing of the spirit and here eleazer he he he prayed and then he prophesied because he spoke the word he said let the damsel that gives not only water to me but also to my camels let she be the elected lady amen so here because God works on both ends amen Here Comes Rebecca amen and how she says oh can I have a drink of water not only you but even your camels amen think of it 10 camels that's scripture 10 camel they they drink about I think about 50 gallons yeah m wow wow yeah that's times 10 now the prophet comes and he says that's that Beast represents a power and that same Beast that she watered with her praise is the power that will take her to her Heavenly home that will take her to her groom that's why Saints I'm not ashamed to worship my God because the more I worship Him in spirit and Truth something is happening that Satan can't see the world can't see but my God is transforming me amen that's why we are walking that was a type amen of Malachi 4 amen sent for the bride amen and then there when he came to Isaac there's no more question of elazer come on preach with me now it ain't about brother Branham it Ain it is all about Christ and the bride he did his job he did what he had to do according to the word but now it's up to us to manifest the word of God hallelujah Glory so yeah know I'm not ashamed of the Gospel amen you think I'm too excited I've got so much to be excited about he amen amen amen you know amen the prophet says we need more Moses with the burning bush to attract some of the other ones that are still out amen God is still alive God still performs Miracles amen people think amen God of the past God of brother brandham but let me tell you my Bible tells me that he's ashamed yesterday today and even tomorrow hallelujah amen amen amen so oh the only light comes from the word and we also know in the word that in the evening time you know what time we're living in we're in the end of the evening time and he said there will be light and there is light shining bright amen so we see God always God had attributes that he wanted to express the prophet tells us to become tangible so God he is an object of Praise of worship amen and even with Moses we can see I'm not going to end there go that's a whole series AP part but you take it that's for you Pastor we can see how Moses got instruction to build the Tabernacle amen and and there was a certain area so there was the outer Court the inner Court the holiest of holiest where God the light the shakina glory the prophet calls us the amber light the Halo amen we can see how it was veiled just like it's veiled today but real for his bride we see in Hebrews amen how he we know in the holiest of holies there's a golden sensor the Ark of the Covenant the Mana the Aaron's rod and I think I mentioned it Friday a dried up stick that produces fruit that's what has ask from from us not to copy not to do something manufacture something you know a sheep you don't have to ask it to produce wool do you where's brother Aiden let me put on my glasses I don't think you go in in the greenhouse and say now I want this type of flower so please let it be this type of flow he plants the seed he knows exactly what will come out so God planted a seed and he knows what will come out Satan tries to hybrid things he tries by all means but an apple tree will produce apples the tree of life will produce life come on and the tree of knowledge and wisdom will produce theology a dead Church a lukewarm church but the bride she's standing on the pure word of God and she knows amen she comes from God and goes back to God and she's walking right now present tense in the spoken word Vision Hallelujah and the more we walk the more we walk in the word who some glad morning when this life is over I will be changed in the twinkling of an eye oh Father Make It Real to each and every one of us hallelujah hallelujah so in Hebrews 9 amen it says verse eight the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest so we see amen that means if you look it up in the in the concordance or the Lexicon amen to render apparance to appear to show but glory be to God Amen Seven Ages had to pass and now here at the last and final age there's no other age it ends with loudy and you know what the good news is I'm in the bride age but it ends with loud Des here so even though there can be gross Darkness upon the Earth hey God says when you have every born again son and daughter of God Amen you have something in you that you can go and create yourself another world and go live in it well start creating your world I go to school and you start worshiping Darkness hey has no effect on you loudy has no effect on you the world has no effect on you that's the power of God it ain't go somewhere on a nice Sandy Beach I know we all would love that especially the pastors and and I got a big amen there right bad news not yet we have a Heavenly Home awaiting amen but the Lord wants us to create the atmosphere no matter where we are amen even when Satan comes playing with your mind you answer him with faith when he comes with doubt you answer him with the word of God Amen and you see the power not of your word of his word amen amen so we see amen how it was veiled but God had this desire away from the beginning Amen to become tangible to manifest himself so nothing is out of cater are you hearing me nothing is going wrong amen and then the privilege was giving to the high priest Amen to go once a year amen the prophet tells us amen he's he was stripped and dressed right and he made us Kings and Priests so we need to be stripped I don't like it when brother Wayne or brother R when they you know they preach and and I think it's for me blessed are thou if you still hear the word of God because those that hear the truth and don't accept the truth amen they receive an hour and you know what they become spiritually deaf so if you hear the word and you feel like oh yes I need to put my life in order I need to run to the altar I need to ask forgiveness to this brother to that sister you better run amen I was hallelujah amen I was back in in maisha's Island this summer amen and as the word was being preached it ain't about Brother David no no no if you have that thought you're completely wrong it a it is all about our God because he still does the miraculous the phenomenal the Supernatural and the Supernatural is natural for God so while I was preaching the presence of the Lord filled the house and there were some I didn't know a thing about it there were some issues between families oh yeah even in maisha's Island not just in Ohio or Virginia or in tonan that's where we come from but the presence of the Lord was there amen and as God was dealing with the hearts all of a sudden a sister was running to another sister oh just embracing her please forgive me you think this is a man doing no this is God doing and he's the same for us come on church he can do exceeding above what you can think what you can imagine but all we sensor it enough to God's voice we need to be stripped and dressed right dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready to enter in that man he walked in such a way that every time he moved it wasn't you've seen that brother he did this this this you've seen that sister oh she's still like this and this every step every movement of his life sir every time when he moved his legs you can move your leg no problem every time he made a step it had to play Holy Holy Holy unto to the Lord God Almighty my is that your testimony so we see when Jesus died on the day of atonement he rent the veil in two now for who that whosoever may come at any time into the shakina glory how by the baptism of the Holy Ghost many people think I have a nice sticker here I'm in the message I believe the message I'm in True Word Tabernacle I know brother Ray you better know Jesus Christ in the resurrection and the power of the Resurrection amen unless you have the token applied there's no Rapture for you amen but God still seals God is still in the sealing business hallelujah amen amen amen amen so that's why these meetings are so important let me say it even better every meeting is important because some people they are only living from special meeting to special meeting to special meeting to special meeting every service is a special meeting so let's start acting upon it we come in these doors how with thankgiving Thanksgiving in our hearts oh it was a rough day and well thank you Jesus I'm in your presence and you're going to charge me and tomorrow I'm going to kill some demons come on are you with me you know in the Army I don't know brother hey you make me feel a liberty here so you know we love when the soldiers that are on the front line come on do the work but you know what God needs each and every one of you we can sing I'm in the Lord's army left right left right I'm in the Lord's army you know that b you know Sunday school but go on Brother Ray brother Wayne go on brother Ron you kill the demons and then H God has chosen you and you know the good news even brother Brenham he says you know what Jesus Christ is walking on the front row with us so I feel good that it doesn't depend on my strength nor by might oh but by the spirit of the Lord this mountain shall be moved come on SO fear not little flock you have received power you have received light amen amen amen so he tore the veil in two amen and he received the name above our name the name of Jesus he says the veil of sin was rent into the veil of sickness was rent into and every Veil listen to that that kept man away from God was rent into we have no excuse whatsoever that's right whoever we are whether it's the first time you come in this in this in this church we have no excuse whatsoever we have received an Open Door an open book Hallelujah so the veil that kept man away from God was rented two amen and he scattered every devil he made a search light from Glory you want to know what the def definition is of search light a powerful beam of light that is projected a search light is an apparatus that combines an extremely luminous source with a mirrored parabolic reflector my my my you know why I get so excited because those words that you can find in a definition of Webster or whoever the prophet uses them and when you look it up you can but Rejoice because God Amen the night Andale I I spoke about he Rejoice because he sees just a little star but a little star has no light of himself but he reflects the light of the sun amen and God is asking us to reflect his light in this Dark Age that's why he said Darkness will cover the Earth but upon you and in you my glory shall be manifested and that's what's going on amen amen amen so he made a way with his own blood that whosoever whosoever will come amen and come into the shikina glory and be filled filled with what the power of Pentecost I'm not bringing you back to 9 1906 a soua street no the word of God brings us back to our origin that's when the first church was founded and even our blessed sister who found favor not our hell Mary and no she needed that kind of experience and we all need that kind of experience a lifechanging experience being born again amen amen amen oh and in that Glory sh Glory everything is possible the prophet says Jesus is here you're not hearing me brother brandham is saying to some people Jesus is standing here wearing a blue tie Brother David you consider yourself as Jesus I'm just quoting the word oh and people don't like you for that hey that's just quoting the word that doesn't make a God out of me like Oh Brother David no no don't go don't get into those doctrines but Jesus is stalking you every service through the vessel that God chose so if you don't like my tie oh don't look the veil people are looking to the veil and if you look to the fail you will see mistakes brother Brown wasn't perfect there's only one that is perfect and that's Jesus Christ and I can only be perfect by him and him alone the prophet says the shikina glory he reveals to the believer so we need to be a believer not a so-called believer not an unbeliever but a true believer and he that the Shina Glory reveals to the believer that he is the same yesterday today and forever come on now there is power in that light you know this Pillar of Fire when it came down you know God likes to change in morphe change his mask and he left something for the father final time at the end of the final age something real special are you with me that Pillar of Fire came between the Pharaoh the Army and his people and here Moses why do you cry Moses just speak so why do you cry speak the word of God until you believe it and you will see the miraculous happen amen Moses was just walking and he thought well I'm acting according to the word what he didn't see and thank God for Malachi 4 amen he said out of that Pillar of Fire there were angry eyes and to see had to open so don't fear no matter what you face there's something with you on the front line amen when the prophet left us the pillar of fire didn't leave us God didn't leave us his work was done but now it's up to us and we walk day after day after day in the manifestation of the spoken word vision for me for us that's the say the word come on now but it takes the Simplicity of believing God that's right I love it simplicity people love to make complicated only believe and you'll see his glory amen we see how the temple amen when Solomon when they dedicated the temple amen we know how the glory of God filled the house now what house will you build me mhm Amen brother BR says why don't we dedicate ourselves to the worship of the Living God and let him fill us with himself and then we shall see the shik glory return again to the house of the Living God which is the human body but God is in plain view now it was death one time to walk behind that Veil and you know what it's death now not to go into be beyond that Veil and he says and now it's in plain view the revealed word my and people criticize the word PR criticize the revealed word amen and and people want to build kingdoms upon it make them a big ey and a small you and and I have a greater Revelation yeah I had people tell me that I said God bless you God gives a measure to each and everyone and I ask you one thing please pray for me that I may have a greater Revelation and that's my honest prayer that he reveals himself day after day after day hallelujah amen so we see now in Christ Jesus in Ephesians 2 ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who had made both one and had broken down the m wall of partition between us we're going to celebrate Christmas soon no not me Brother David I'm not going to go into Pagan stuff don't worry the prophet tells us the true Christmas what is it having Christ Living in you and he's the one we worship so Jesus took his own blood and entered into the holiest of holies to redeem us and to tear down the middle wall of petition that you yourself might come into the shikina glory with him and live under the blessings of God come on Church Redeemed by the blood and when the True Blood came the blood of Jesus Christ God's son he broke down the middle wall of petition he tore down the curtain from top to bottom showing it wasn't a man doing it amen he tore down the curtain from top to Bon and now the believer whosoever will he can come into the shikina glory that's why he says we have some untapped resources but it's about time we go Beyond the Veil and we start pulling the dividends that God purchased for us if you don't know what a dividend is ask somebody who knows I'll put it simple a shareholder he only wants dividends you got it right okay we've got unta resources that are unlimited unlimited amen we thank God you know people they w't put God in a box untapped resources that means every time are you hearing me old and young every time you come to God you can get what you need if you can believe he says yeah Satan plays with our mind but as the word is being spoken we receive fate is being built when God send us a restored word it's to give us perfect Faith that's why even brother Brandon says the Rapture will be an easy thing try didn't work I I don't want to make something funny do I'm making a point here amen because there are some laws that are part of this world when he created with gravitation you know no nobody will say hey I'm gone no but there's a power in the word of God which is Jesus Christ that will take us up and every law of gravitation they will be every demon can try to pull you down on and you'll say bye bye World let me go ahead and now myself Enoch a type of the Bride amen he was just you know it pleased God why because he had faith and just L like the prophet says he took an afternoon walk is it that simple oh yeah yeah Prophet says even the Rapture is in you then and it'll be an easy thing so don't start writing a thesis a doctorate how it has to happen believe the word in all its power and was walking amen and every step he took took him higher and higher and higher because it pleased God to take him to Rapture him because he believed in God amen amen amen so we know amen he came the mercy seed is hanging in clear view of the congregation amen but now there are many that are under the popular opinion that's another word we like huh well I don't like it to be honest because you know brother Wayne what is the popular opinion on this subject serpent SE marriage and divorce and going to stop there but what's the popular opinion we don't want the popular opinion we want What God Says amen let every every word from a man be a liar but God's word be the only truth amen so we don't want a popular opinion we want to stand on what is right if you want to be blessed in your life stand live according to the word of God yes people people may be jealous about it but who cares what God has blessed nobody can curse hey people look at Israel and say oh Israel this this this this this God has blessed who can curse amen since the Holy Ghost has come in his last days as prophesied the veil is rent amen and that's why we can see the extreme joy and peace extreme joy come on how many are happy this morning hey this is the Lord this is the day of the Lord let us rejoice and be glad in it you're hungry I'm not going to preach like brother Tim God bless my buddy I'm going to preach longer oh don't worry you know there where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty when we come into the house of God we should be under so much rejoicing you know people they wanton buy their tradition you have to do this you have to do that they shouldn't be D dancing there shouldn't be singing well let me tell you that's the LIE from hell because Satan he loves to keep people bound but when God is dealing with you I don't care if I act like a drunkard I don't care how I act there's a fire burning within [Applause] me that's why the prophet says I've seen nothing nothing this orderly I gave I think I spoke a brother Tim the same when I was a Marius amen sister Jessica Adams before I came up she sung the song uh How does it go in Jesus name uh we I speak Jesus thank you I speak Jesus the anointing came down I couldn't even preach I just under the anointing orted God's people all of a sudden amen my mind went to the scripture amen quoting Joshua amen how they had to go around and there was silence yes there was but at a point of time at a point of time there was true worship amen and I started going around I'll do it again I started going around the there was an a tent so I just walked around and you know what there was such an anointing oh well you can say they're young people but they all ran and they kept on walking worshiping oh they received the Holy Ghost they received their healing they received their Deliverance do you think because it was just a type or because Brother David Just sh no because somebody took God at his word and people think oh you're acting crazy what let me be crazy about God hallelujah God amen amen amen this extreme joy woo we should have faces like this in the fiery furnace yes are you with me because even brother brandham he he goes he goes to the back mind of Christ you know of God and and what does he say Here Comes Gabriel have you seen your three sons they're going to be burned oh yeah I'm watching have you seen brothers so and so sister so oh yeah my eyes are on this parrow but my eyes are on my bride now let me go and destroy the Earth that's how we would like to do it sometimes you know let me do this and let me do that I know I'm I I'm hitting some things here don't blame the mailman the message comes from God but you know what God says this is a man-sized job I'm going to go down and that's exactly what happened in our generation come on now I'm going to come down reveal myself to my bride and the prophet says and they had hours of hours of rejoicing think of it in the in the fire that was heated up seven times stronger you want to know the power of the light which is God the only thing that was burned you know was there GI bondage the power of God is so that even their clothes didn't smell oh come on now come on now amen that's the power of God here this morning that's why we have extreme joy and peace and things that the church has today we have it today it's in plain view of those who believe Hallelujah that's why I don't know who was talking because it was the same language that was with the brothers I think you know I said well I don't need lot of language on that but in our language it says you're cuckoo so it was just a sign and people think when somebody is is is under the anointing of God or somebody who testifies I'm Healed and still has a leg or sorry brother one somebody who testifies service after service every Sunday morning I love his testimony God bless you Sister Carnie where every Sunday morning yes his body says I can't but something within him I'm going to destroy Satan in the name of Jesus and here he comes he he can be sick even before going behind a Pulpit I'm not saying that to have pity I'm just saying that to show the glory of God in a surrendered vessel amen that goes behind a Pulpit Satan even before he opens the door let's let's give him another one but here he goes and the anointing comes down and people are saved people are healed people are delivered amen and he's the same God for us this morning it all depends on if we believe if we believe for the impossible because all things are possible to them that believe amen amen amen so we're living amen as my title says we're walking in the spoken word Vision so now as I said on Friday Satan perverts everything listen to how many know Tik [Music] Tok come on let me put on my glasses that doesn't make me an old man huh sorry how many know Tik Tok yeah I don't have it just so you know but I know about it nobody dares how comes I mean have you preached against it brother you did well brother Wayne okay so for those who don't know Tik Tok is a social media I'm not going to preach on that but I'm going to make a link here wait for creating and sharing this discovering all types short videos and the name it they play on Tik Tok is that's a complicated word I'm going to say now an onomo it's stands for clocks and countdowns minute by minute so onom matopo is a word that sounds like the noise it describes Tick Tock and as I said before and people oh I have so many followers MH I'm an influencer and so on but we see the prophet says in the countdown the spiritual astronaut is in Christ and he's listening to the word of God not Tick Tock listen to the countdown of the word of God and to see where it's going and he's fixing to leave now not for the moon he will pass the moon so fast he's on his road to heaven and he's listening to the countdown oh yes he's headed for heaven in a Raptor oh he's in Christ he's wrapped in his glory headed for heaven with him and leave the Earth let's get in the astronaut very quickly because the doors will close after a while the countdown's on science says that their countdown is three minutes listen he says that in 62 is three minutes hours may be ahead of that it might be one ready for 4 Z let's come in so now Satan scientist they all heard about the Doomsday Clock yeah it started in 1947 after the Cold War so it's a clock where so-call intelligent people with all due respect I say that but there's only one intelligence that's let me just enter something here you know we are people are creating artificial intelligence it comes to such a point it's made by humans so even artificial intelligence started lying H why because they're tapping into this tree of knowledge instead of the Bride we the bride we should tap in this this this untapped resources in the tree of life amen so we see they make such a big fuss and and you know hey there's one intelligence and that's he and him alone that's why we should listen to the condam of the word amen so we see this Doomsday Clock amen started and now it's 90 seconds to midnight Satan always takes something out of the word and makes something out of it are you with me few more moments okay thanks as long there's this good bro I'm going midnight marks the beginning and the ending of a day are you with me what does the Bible say about midnight Exodus 11 I'm just going to give you some types and Moses said thus sayeth the Lord about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt let's continue Exodus 12 and it came to pass that at midnight the Lord smoted all the firstborn in the land of Egypt and from the firstborn of the Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of the cattle judges 16 and Samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the Gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulder and carried them upon the top of the hill that is before heon and then Ruth another type come on now and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold the woman laid At His Feet act 16 and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sank praise unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake and so the foundation of the prisons were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed come on church amen in the evening time we're so close to what they call midnight I'm not done yet with midnight I'm coming back to that but let's say a few moments with Paul and Silas amen as they were in prison Shadrach masak and Abednego they lived in what we could call Sodom and Gomorrah not quoting that they live there get me right but no matter what the circumstances were they decided they even changed their name to take their their true identity away but that couldn't change the identity that God plac there and that's the same for us in lyia young people and old people no matter how dark it may be the glory of God is upon thee and is revealed through [Music] you so don't be afraid to worship Paul and Silas listen when we look when you when you look it up amen the word hymns the strong lexicon says whom that means to sing praise celebrating God they sung you know what they sung the Pascal hymns that's the Psalm 11318 136 and the Jews call that the great halel the word halel comes from praise it means Hallelujah and I I read the quote what brother Brenham says even the hot and tots amen they can use the word hallelujah which means glory to my God Amen so I should be afraid to scream on the top of my lungs the top of my voice Hallelujah because he is worthy of all my praise amen amen amen the exaltation praise ye the Lord hallelujah it comes from the Greek root Allelujah appears throughout all the Psalms amen and it means and the phrase it means to shine to praise to boast or celebrate God our true worship should be at the level of the miracle we expect because when I praise Hallelujah I can boast I love what brother brandham says I cannot boast on my family but there's one I can boast on and that's Jesus Christ and I'm not afraid to worship him I'm not afraid that's why he says we can face demons he said when he received the vision walking in the spoken word he said now Satan you can line up all you demons and you can sty to stop that little boy from Raising from the dead but nothing can stop the word of God from manifesting in me in us hallelujah amen so I'm not afraid to [Music] boast what does it say p 113 praise ye the Lord Praise ye all ye Servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord hey it's still early blessed be the name of the Lord from this time for and forever more from the rising of the sun until the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised he is to be praised by who By Me By Us by the redeemed amen amen amen Psalm 118 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good come on church is he good to you is he really good just like Jesus asked Peter do you love me is he really good then he's worthy of my praise amen oh let Israel now say that his Mercy endured forever let them now not fear the lord say that his Mercy endured forever I called upon the Lord in distress and the Lord answered me and said me in a large place the Lord is on my side and I will not fear what can man do unto me think of it Paul and silus were sitting legs maybe you don't see me but that's okay and one time brother on remember we took a picture we visited I don't know where it was just how it was where wburg that's how they were and they just remembered hey Paul let's give glory to God let's start worshiping let's create an atmosphere in this place where even no matter how we can be bound looking through our eyes let us worship amen and they created an atmosphere and did you hear what they say amen for God is with me his Mercy endured forever what I was impr hey his Mercy endured forever they started worshiping and an earthquake came amen you know when God is doing something oh yes he can shake oh every Foundation amen every stronghold has to come down and it shook the whole house and it set them all at Liberty that's why when you worship Him in spirit and in truth your neighbor can be boundless bound be but you worship will create an atmosphere here that all of a sudden he doesn't know what's going on but he feels the presence of the Lord amen hallelujah oh what's going on that's the power of God hallelujah amen Psalm 136 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good sir and his Mercy endured forever let's continue I don't want to all these are sermons in itself but Matthew 25 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him at midnight there's a cry amen there may be foolish versions but there are some wise that have the oil the anointing the wine of stimulation and their lambs they full up like the prophet says we need to be filled up filled up till every [Music] fiber hallelujah amen amen in China tick Tok amen is known as doing which means shaking sound look Satan is but a copier but let me tell you the word of God is a certain sound that will maybe shake you but will make you Rapture Ready because the sound of God's trumpet is a clear sound and when you hear that sound you will prepare for battle but if it's a confusion how can you be ready but this pure word has sounded mightily powerfully and the bride says it's nothing but the truth hallelujah God revealed his word to us amen listen amen we have a clear view of who he is of who we are the seals are open this is the most glorious time I'm not saying that just to say something it's a reality oh and when the seven seal opened there was silence for the David there silence well maybe for you brother or sister but not for me because the silence is broken because when the seals were opened seven Thunders uttered their voices amen everything that was a mystery amen was revealed so there's nobody coming to reveal something that was forgotten no no no Eleazar did his job well amen and God used the mouthpiece to speak to his bride so his bride can prepare herself what with the revealed word come on Saints Hallelujah so it's not a half an hour of silence for some it is but for the bride he's revealing his secrets to her amen people want to use that scripture sh has to be silence in church I'm so sick and tired of this demon because if you don't praise him if I don't praise him these stones will praise him God will find somebody that he can get praise out of and I just don't want to make noise I want to worship Him in spirit and in truth but when I see my true identity when I see that he gives me every Redemptive blessing every promise when I see my name in the book I can but glorify the name of Jesus Hallelujah Glory don't never be a dead Church hallelujah what did he Veil the word he says now let me take a few moments if that's okay for Esther is that okay I quoted I think Friday predestination looks back to fall knowledge fall knowledge looks at the destiny God in the beginning could see all things the way it would happen and he knew the end from the beginning that wonderful and to think that every Born Again child of God today has the privilege and Assurance to know that God knows his own we see and I'm not going to go into all the details that's another series brother Wayne and I know you preach on that too but we see how Esther was chosen for such a time as this sir just like this Esther is chosen for such a time as this so we see how amen we go through the whole story and and how amen Mari he says well if you be silent God will use somebody else so there goes all their theology against worship you know brother DAV it you should hear a KNE drop on the floor well I'm sorry if you want to hear that needle don't come to my church don't come to BR rain's Church don't come to BR Ron's church because people want to take something and to put God in a box so even Mari he says if you won't say a thing God will take somebody else else cuz God wants to be worshiped he wants to be worshiped amen and then we see how amen yeah the Amplified says if you keep silent at this time I'm going to bring it to our front door huh so the days of Silence are over we can Rejoice we have our name in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and it's not a revelation a man can give it's God himself giving us that Revelation that why the opening of the word is a jubilee is a Revival it's a wakeup call Hallelujah so he came down the head of the body to show us our position now listen Esther the theologians they say this book is useless because God isn't even mentioned in the Book of Esther so why why is it Esther let me tell you CU she's a type of us got to make it more clear the Book of Esther is right after the book of Nehemiah Nehemiah he represents the Jews going back to their Homeland and Esther is before the Book of Job job represents the resurrection I know my redeemer live it so after the Jews go to their Homeland and just before the resurrection there's a queen that comes to her rightful position come on Church you think that's just by chance no God knows he knows he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was God the word was with God that's the revelation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah then when she comes to the king she needed a scepter few more minutes the scepter of the king we can see in the Bible different verses you know a scepter could have different sizes but if it was pure gold gold is heavy either he had muscles like this or 20 people were holding his hands but that's not the case listen Bible says the scepter ordinary was made of wood of certain kind of vines or straight branches Etc so there was wood and gold we have the cross and deity without the cross we are lost and with with the cross we receive D talking about the privileged people Saints we are to be the most happiest people in the earth and that goes from Ohio to Virginia to France to Switzerland to Germany to China to Japan amen the bride ought to be the happiest [Music] people well let's act upon according to the word he became sin like me that I might become righteousness of God he took my place that I can take his now Hallelujah isn't he wonderful we live in a Time Saints Amen brother Bram had seven Visions six are already done amen the prophet and again people try to put amen says the word of God and put God in a box the sixth vision is over is manifested the seven is only remaining and I saw ashes I saw the destruction of America that's the only remaining but before that there's a Rapture taking place the prophet says about these Visions amen the Catholic oh they already in the White House it struck me when the president to be said all the Catholics should vote for me what a declaration what also struck me well not struck me I just see the we're walking in the manifestation the spoken word Vision now last week he went to Paris to what to nraam do you think that's just a coincidence oh God still has control over everything even in Russia even in Israel even in Sy everywhere God knows and there's nothing out of cader God knows exactly and he will manifest every single word amen amen isn't that something amen so that's why we can give him glory Saints because we are a privileged people amen so there's nothing going to stop it there will be light in the evening time I don't care listen how he says it the works that I do you shall also do I love that it's probably only for brother Ron and brother Wayne and brother Ray but for me no did he say that I could get a better know than that did he say that he said the works that I do shall ye do also he says I don't care how many seals you try to put over it God will break every seal he broke the Seal of the Tomb he broke the Seal of hell he broke the Seal of death he broke the Seal of the grave and arose forever more and triumphant over the grave that hell tombs and every manmade thing there was I love the end part to show that he was God and cannot be sealed away from the people hallelujah glory be to God he cannot be sealed away from the people anymore people try I have a special Ministry because you know I'm coming after brother brandham and you should I'll make more sense to this word and you take one word you add one word it is finished amen that's why God himself says you can't seal me away any longer I am here the I am came down for his bride to show who she is and she accepts it willingly gladly rejoicing glory amen that shows we are invited Amen to be part Akers of all that he is partakers you know what that means that means we participate we take part of we are in the picture where Satan is out of the picture although brother Ron said yeah there's a picture taken and he will be held responsible that's true but he's out of the picture says the prophet he's but a stump on the side of the road that God is using to bringing his people to himself that's come on Saints am I the only one rejoicing come on oh it's the anointing no the anointing is everywhere amen wherever you may be in the back and the front God fills all time all space he fills everything and he fills every heart who has the desire amen amen amen amen so he says to be partakers it's in the word here he says glory be to God and it's just a word for some but to us it's a manifestation they say I see no more word but for us it's a reality isn't that something that's why we have boldness to enter into the holiest of Hol am and not to go in is death you must enter in Christ few more moments he says that blood cell perfect lamb that God created God came in that blood cell was pierced what for to open that cell where no man had ever entered before before think of it no man ever entered before even Spurgeon he said when they came to him well what is Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 he says do not touch because that's for somebody who will come on the sea when in our time in our time in our age so he was wise enough not to say hey I'm going to explain he knew so that blood cell that no man have ever entered to bring you and I in that blood cell isn't that something and then he says we are joined HS with Christ in the kingdom of God God woo he says the god in you wake up are you being wak up by the word of God not by Brother David that is just you know jumping around oh this joy that I have you can take it away but it's definitely a wakeup call amen I have a a sister amen a Catholic lady she was a Catholic lady 72 years old anden during covid she all by God's choice came on on our web page and started streaming it's really by God's predestination because she was looking for another church think of it a Catholic and then she contacts me and she said wow what is preach my eyes are being open because I've been reading the Bible and and and and and what they say in the Catholic church is wrong and then and what you say is true it's not what I say it's what he says amen I baptized that sister during covid she's about eight hours away from the church amen I sent her to Seven Seals seven Church ages she couldn't sleep at night because she was devouring the word and she said oh this is so wonderful you know why because she saw her name in the book Hallelujah the god in you wake up I love God's word people don't like the wakeup call let's be honest some people when the when alarm goes off leave me 10 1550 more minutes when you hear the wakeup call from God you better jump up because while there is still time and a chance when he knocks on your door you better open up don't wait until tomorrow what you can do this morning don't play that game where certain say I wait until I see Israel do that I wait until I see Russia do that or I wait until this or until that it'll be too late that's that's why even the prophet says amen oh when those that have went before us when they will be walking think of it they won't see them and you will think of it Wayne you're preaching R go you think he will only go to where he used to preach who knows I'm trying to make a point here where some will see and others want but while you hear his voice even this morning my point and brother Ron was speaking on side into an unseen round and this morning we are walking in the spoken word vision just like I gave the example of brother Ed he only realized all of a sudden when he was carrying the green checkered chirt I'm walking into vision and it's the same with us amen maybe one morning you will wake up my hair's back my wrinkles are gone and maybe you young that are I think you were 13 no remembered well H I'm 18 Dad Dad let's get ready and here comes dad oh yes son sorry brother rnie love you it's Rapture time it's Rapture time just like when the angel came down th with those two Neighbors those ladies where the prophet prophesied he spoke the word you are healed amen and they went home did they go crying weeping no they gave glory to God Amen they went into another dimension they saw amen the healing they saw the victory they saw it amen and one morning the angel passed there and there was rejoicing on the left there was rejoicing on the right because the angel came back amen and when the trumpet will sound there will be don't just wait for the trumpet to sound because you've missed the whole picture then because when you receive the open book amen I'm I'm I'm winding up here Revelation 10 says you go to the angel take the open book eat the open book so you be become a part of him and he becomes a part of you the prophet says the word becomes you and you become the word I love that amen so what do you what what should you do then come on help me thou must prophesy Again Me Brother David yes because this word will never fail the prophet says I have the quotes there he says there's certain things that Christ did when he was here and he left certains for us to do do you think it will be just let there be squirrels maybe you like squirrels I've never eaten one what I'm sorry forgive me brother and that's not what the third poll is about wind up here hallelujah he says it was speared out yonder this blood cell and it freed God it freed God why because he had a people chosen that he wanted to manifest his glory in and that's what is happening now there's an invisible Union amen going on right now amen and he says God himself came down into the blood cell and wrapped the blood around him and now he says to make you perfect and to bring you back into Fellowship to bring you through that blood cell into himself okay are you ready dropping a few more bombs I'm winding up what do you say brother Wayne usually when you're winding up five more minutes you don't say that okay so I'm just saying like brother Wayne okay are you ready de itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Ghost are you hearing me I got a few more there amen so if D lays in the man what is going on here what is going on right now brother brandom he says it's happening day after day after day and people miss it people come to church play Church they just think I'm going to church I have to pay my ti I give offerings and that's it no we have a higher calling that calling is to Perfection and the only way is for him to be in you and you in him and that's why we should run the race that is before us lay aside everything that is against but deity lays in the brother or sister that receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he was on the cross amen It Was Written of me in my father's word I have confirmed it Yonder at the cross it is finished right how many can say that with me it is finished he paid the price for my salvation he paid the price for my Redemption he paid the price for my healing he paid it all Hallelujah listen the Earth knew it was him it shook with great earthquake when he died we all know what happened the moon and the sun hid their face can go in and I'll leave that God put way from the beginning those two lights one the Sun for the day the moon a reflection that's a type of Christ and the bride to reflect you see the words he uses reflector the bride to reflect his glory and then when the ultimate price was paid for us the moon and the sun hid their face do you know why because there was the light the True Light there was the True Light that each and everyone needed Jesus Christ amen and as we approach Christmas I'm going to give you a Christmas sermon but let his light Jesus Christ shine through your life you young Sisters You elderly sisters you young Brothers you elderly Brothers amen may we be a reflector amen of God's glory in this dark and gloomy age because that's what is going on D now in the bride Hallelujah amen amen amen he oh and when God when when when he went down Satan thought he had a victory but he took him by the neck that's you thought you had me are you listening I know Satan is running after us trying seeking who he may devour create that world where the pillar of Fire there you know why CU he's afraid of fire Daniel created the atmosphere those I've been to Africa for those that went to Africa when a lion roars it is scary there's something woo but when those lions that hadn't been fed for days and Daniel he didn't listen to what the king or whoever could say I will keep worshiping I will keep praising God in the good and in the bad times I will give him glory no matter what well Daniel I'm sorry I love you very much but I put a law and I have to throw you in the D in the end the Lions then you know Satan comes and makes you all kinds of promises he has nothing to give you you're not hearing me he has nothing to give you young people he has nothing to give you but God gives him gives us everything amen So Daniel was thrown in he creates the atmosphere amen where the fire comes down those Lions what do they become little kittens hey you love the prophet read the word they are afraid of fire even those lions and I love how the prophet says amen and we can't we can make a little drama out of it come on here lion I need a little pillow here the other one lay here I need nice warm think of it I don't know I don't know what you're facing but he knows and when you create that atmosphere when the light is shining through you no demon of hell can get you isn't that wonderful Why Don't We Stand trying to find something to you know that's what makes Satan's mad that's what shakes him when the Church of Jesus Christ only knew who they were because he said there's nothing impossible to you Saints Prophet Cole also talks about how we should pinch our conscience it's about time we pinch ourselves we are walking brothers sisters in the spoken word Vision that's there will be a bride without to W up and the prophet says she is him that's why he says deity lays and those that receive the baptism of holy ghost that doesn't make us two anymore are you hearing me there are no more Twain They are one and here we have people that makes a trinity again God's W from before the foundation of the world God's plan was to have a bride without spot or wrinkle and for this final age to reveal himself in us so maybe you're not and thank God you're not Mr Trump but people you know they look up to some certain people yeah you are you value way more than all whatever the world can call great right because he chose us Saints day after day we are walking in the spoken word Vision that is manifesting itself so let us rejoice and be glad amen because we serve a mighty God and I don't know if this may be the last time I don't know because let me tell you one thing when when we look in the scriptures there ain't much time left are you hearing me there ain't much time left Israel is is in her Homeland six visions are manifested there's one left but we will be raptured before isn't he wonderful isn't he marvelous so if we never see here in Ohio Bluff you're going to find me rejoicing and don't use that as an excuse not to worship our Lord and savior now amen think of Rebecca 50 somewhat gallons 10 camels the more she worshiped the power of the word yeah and brought her to her Heavenly Home amen that's what awaits us can you play that song How Great Is Our God sing with me how great is our God I love you with the love of the Lord truly you have blessed my heart sorry if I fell at Liberty brother Wayne
