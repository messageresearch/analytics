[1:09] the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen
[1:13] and amen and God bless you tonight and
[1:16] uh if you have your Bibles in Ephesians
[1:18] the first chapter I want to read these
[1:20] first three verses Ephesians chapter 1
[1:22] verse
[1:24] 1-3 uh I've been I've been working on
[1:27] some things for the book of Ephesians
[1:28] for a little while and Sunday uh brother
[1:31] brother Mel just inspired me there uh in
[1:34] the book of Ephesians and I I'm going to
[1:36] maybe I'm not going to speak every
[1:38] service probably on it but I'm going to
[1:40] start a little series here in the book
[1:42] of Ephesians and I've got some things
[1:43] that I just want to work through and uh
[1:46] I'm I'm a I'm a studier by nature and I
[1:48] like the and I like to go through things
[1:50] and the book of Ephesians is some
[1:52] powerful things in it I think it would
[1:54] be a blessing to all of us amen and so I
[1:56] want to um just take tonight for uh for
[1:59] first three three verses of this and
[2:00] read it and then we'll we'll see how the
[2:03] Lord leads us uh Paul an apostle of
[2:06] Jesus Christ by the will of God and to
[2:10] the Saints which are at Ephesus and to
[2:13] the faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace
[2:17] be to you and peace from God our Father
[2:22] and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed
[2:25] be the God and the father of our Lord
[2:27] Jesus Christ who hath blessed blessed us
[2:31] with all spiritual
[2:33] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:38] amen we ask the Lord to bless his word
[2:40] as you could be seated tonight I want to
[2:43] uh just speak to you here a little bit
[2:44] on this and if you uh enjoy studying at
[2:47] home uh maybe uh I'll give you a few of
[2:50] the sermon titles that I'm studying
[2:52] personally and you you can go through
[2:54] them if you'd like uh I'm studying the
[2:56] of course the adoption series I think it
[2:58] was three or four parts of that and then
[3:01] also I'm listening to uh a believer's
[3:03] position in Christ uh and then we were
[3:07] also uh looking into uh the Paradox and
[3:11] then we looked into Israel and the
[3:12] church so there's several sermons here
[3:14] that we're that we're drawing from to
[3:17] get direction that it's not just maybe
[3:19] just a one-sided uh situation but
[3:21] looking into all of them and I I have
[3:24] found some beautiful things uh that
[3:25] brother brandham has to say about the
[3:28] book of Ephesians and uh starting out
[3:30] the adoption series it's a real a real
[3:32] powerful that first maybe 20 minutes of
[3:34] the first adoption you'll just get some
[3:37] real nuggets right off the bat and
[3:39] you'll you'll hear some things that are
[3:41] quite a blessing to you I want to read
[3:43] this from paragraph 34 now the book of
[3:45] Ephesians as I was just saying to my
[3:47] opinion is one of the greatest books of
[3:50] the New Testament it leaves us on here
[3:53] where Calvinism runs out on one Limb and
[3:56] armenis runs out on the other limb but
[3:59] the book of Ephesian draws it together
[4:02] and positionally places the church now
[4:05] brother bram's using two um theological
[4:07] terms of groups Calvinism would be the
[4:10] grace Group which would be under Luther
[4:13] and and then but yet on the other limb
[4:16] of this was the armenis which would be
[4:18] the legal arm and the prophet says but
[4:20] both of them meet here in the book of
[4:22] Ephesians which is a very uh powerful
[4:25] thing if you like to know where truth is
[4:27] and you know uh brother B said that's
[4:29] where they meet now if you get on any
[4:31] one of those limbs you'll find yourself
[4:33] way out somewhere you know you get uh
[4:35] you get in it and you can see it in the
[4:37] Reformation of the church when just the
[4:39] just shall live by faith and that's when
[4:41] the Martin Luther's group come out under
[4:44] justification of course they were coming
[4:46] right out of the darkness and if they
[4:47] could just believe the just by faith
[4:50] there was a light that came in the
[4:51] church and they got so on that that
[4:54] after a while they got where they didn't
[4:56] believe in alar calls anymore they
[4:57] didn't believe in evangelism they didn't
[4:59] believe amen and they kind of got into
[5:01] that realm of whatever God does god'll
[5:04] do amen and and you've met people like
[5:06] that when they get into predestination
[5:08] well it don't matter anyhow just what's
[5:09] going to happen is going to happen you
[5:11] know and so they get into that thought
[5:13] you know so they get learning down there
[5:14] brother Bram said but then that's when
[5:16] God raised up John Wesley and then they
[5:18] come in and stomped out the idea he said
[5:21] and then he took it to the legal side
[5:23] and then so we got two arms we got an
[5:25] armenius and we got a legalism he said
[5:28] or a Calvinism he said but see in the
[5:30] book of Ephesians is what pulls the
[5:32] thing together now to make itth to make
[5:34] it make sense brother brandom always I I
[5:37] just love how he does his teaching is so
[5:39] simple It just strikes the heart and
[5:41] brother B explains it when he says see
[5:44] what really it is he says is that by
[5:46] Grace you're saved now that's the
[5:47] scripture he said so Grace is what God
[5:50] does for you he said but now the works
[5:52] is what you do for him but it has
[5:55] nothing to do with your salvation it has
[5:57] everything to do with his grace and in
[5:59] your life and and the prophet will say
[6:01] it he said now here's the only way I can
[6:03] explain it to you he said when I get
[6:05] ready to go overseas he said I got a
[6:07] lovely family and a lovely wife he said
[6:09] we'll get down to pray together when I
[6:11] get ready to go he said she don't give
[6:13] me a balling out and saying listen Mr
[6:15] brandom if you don't behave yourself
[6:16] when you're overseas I'm going to leave
[6:18] you he says it's not that way at all he
[6:20] says there's an understanding of love
[6:22] and it's what's between us and that's
[6:24] what brings Perfection and love is what
[6:27] it is that brings uh the real Revelation
[6:29] to the Church of that brings the balance
[6:32] in it that if you really fall in love
[6:34] with the Lord you're not really going to
[6:35] do things amen that you believe is wrong
[6:38] because you love the lord it's not going
[6:40] to be because he's going to throw you
[6:42] out of the Kingdom or you're going to
[6:43] lose your salvation but you just love
[6:46] the Lord so you're going to do things
[6:48] that are right before him because you
[6:50] love him amen amen and that's exactly I
[6:53] believe when you when you see that
[6:54] Revelation it gives you a liberty in
[6:57] your life to live for the Lord with love
[6:59] and with strength and with truth and and
[7:02] the prophet of God begins to tell us
[7:04] this is where it comes together this is
[7:06] how it fits together in our lives now
[7:08] here in the adoption series brother B
[7:10] will say it like this I'd like to say
[7:12] that this book of Ephesians perfectly
[7:14] parallels the Old Testament Joshua now
[7:17] Ephesians the book of Ephesians and I've
[7:19] typed it with Joshua and if you noticed
[7:22] Israel was brought up out of Egypt and
[7:24] there's three stages of that Journey one
[7:27] stage was leaving Egypt the next was in
[7:29] the wilderness and the next stage was in
[7:31] Canaan so you see the justification was
[7:34] the leaving of Egypt and then the
[7:36] sanctification was doubt in the
[7:37] wilderness but then it became the
[7:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost when they
[7:41] crossed over the Jordan and brother M
[7:43] said that's the reason we don't believe
[7:45] of course that Canaan represents the
[7:47] Millennium he said see but it does
[7:49] represent the age of the Overcomer the
[7:52] dispensation of overcoming because in
[7:54] Canaan they're killed and burned and
[7:56] took cities and there is no death in the
[7:58] Millennium so when you you hear people
[7:59] sing about the Canaan land well we use
[8:02] the word Canaan land to sing about
[8:03] heaven but really in the scriptural type
[8:06] Canaan land is not heaven Canaan land is
[8:09] the age of the Overcomer it's the land
[8:12] of our overcoming in this age now and
[8:15] it's been crossed into now in the
[8:17] Paradox brother R will say this Joshua
[8:19] here is a book actually is a book of
[8:22] redemption of the Old Testament Joshua
[8:24] and we would have to consider it to be
[8:26] that because the book of redemption
[8:28] because it's red Redemption has two
[8:30] parts now y'all know these quotes real
[8:32] well Redemption has two parts See
[8:34] Redemption anywhere has two parts so
[8:37] brother B is going to bring that home to
[8:39] us anywhere you find Redemption there's
[8:42] going to be two parts of that Redemption
[8:44] he says now that is out of and into it
[8:48] takes two parts to make Redemption
[8:50] there's a coming out of and a going into
[8:53] to Moses represented the law which
[8:56] brought them out of Egypt and Joshua
[8:58] represented SED the grace that took him
[9:00] in the promised land I love it how
[9:02] brother bam speaks about that Grace he
[9:04] said the law and the grace you see there
[9:06] were two different aspects of God's
[9:08] commands now the law brought them out
[9:10] Moses and Joshua took them in it
[9:13] represents something for our day now it
[9:16] represents that we are in a
[9:18] journey and we're coming from Egypt into
[9:20] a promised land so we have to come out
[9:23] of the Egypt the chaos and on our road
[9:26] to this promised land in our father's
[9:28] house of many mansions there's a going
[9:29] out of and there's a going into now
[9:32] y'all know a lot of people comes out of
[9:34] Amen but it's that going into it's the
[9:36] that's the real struggle it's not the
[9:38] coming out of it's the going into cuz
[9:40] that's it takes election to bring you
[9:43] into something see law can bring you out
[9:46] but it'll take Grace to take you in and
[9:48] brother R says this you remember brother
[9:50] R says how that Joshua represented Grace
[9:52] he says because watch now Grace was
[9:54] before the law Grace was during the law
[9:57] and Grace was after the law but the law
[10:00] could never position the people it took
[10:02] the grace of God to position the people
[10:05] see remember the Bible says that the law
[10:07] amen could not make the promise
[10:09] ineffective in being that the promise
[10:11] was made 430 years before the law in
[10:14] other words before there was a law ever
[10:16] given by Moses Abraham received a
[10:18] promise from God that these people would
[10:21] go in this promised land so it was not
[10:23] according to the law that they would go
[10:25] in it was according to the promise that
[10:27] they would go in and that promise was a
[10:29] promise of Grace now of course if we're
[10:32] going to look back in the Old Testament
[10:34] and we're going to see the great
[10:35] parallels of why they were going amen
[10:38] but it's beautiful to hear a prophet say
[10:40] it he said but this promise was given to
[10:42] the church is not a natural land but a
[10:45] spiritual land in 1 Peter chapter 2 and9
[10:48] for you are a holy generation a royal
[10:51] priesthood called out of Darkness Into
[10:54] The Marvelous Light amen do you see them
[10:56] we are a people going into a land but
[10:58] it's a spiritual land it is not a
[11:01] natural land so we have to ask ourselves
[11:03] tonight what land is brother Adam
[11:05] talking about what spiritual land
[11:08] brother B says in adoption that the land
[11:10] of promised to the New Testament to the
[11:12] believer is the promise of the holy
[11:15] spirit for it shall come to pass in the
[11:18] last days now he's going to Joel chapter
[11:20] 2 that I will pour out my spirit upon
[11:22] All Flesh and your sons and daughters
[11:24] shall prophesy and your handmaids of
[11:27] manservants will I pour out my spirit
[11:30] and they shall prophesy and I shall show
[11:32] wonders in the heavens now the prophet
[11:33] is actually speaking here now that the
[11:36] promise coming out of Joel chapter 2 is
[11:38] the promise of the end time church that
[11:41] it is a spiritual promise amen amen so
[11:44] we want to remember we got to be a
[11:46] spiritual people because we have a
[11:48] spiritual promise Amen in Joel chapter 2
[11:51] he's telling this our land now let me
[11:53] just take a couple scriptures here in
[11:55] Ephesians chapter 1 and: 13 Paul calls
[11:58] the holy Holy Spirit the spirit of
[12:00] Promise in Ephesians 1:13 he said to
[12:03] whom also we trusted after that you
[12:05] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[12:07] your salvation and whom after that you
[12:09] had believed you were sealed by that
[12:12] Holy Spirit of Promise isn't that
[12:14] powerful by the spirit of Promise can
[12:17] you pull up Luke 24 and 49 and the Bible
[12:20] when Jesus told them to go Jerusalem I
[12:23] love how he says to them behold I send
[12:26] the promise of my father upon you that
[12:29] you tar in Jerusalem until you be endued
[12:32] with power from up on high now these
[12:35] were natural seeds of Abraham they were
[12:37] naturally the Seed of Abraham they were
[12:40] naturally following Jesus they were
[12:42] naturally in the promised land but they
[12:44] didn't have the promise that the father
[12:47] had made to the church in Luke 24:49
[12:50] Jesus is Calling it the promise of the
[12:52] father now brother randam will say what
[12:55] promise is he talking about he's talking
[12:57] about the book of Isaiah the 28th
[12:59] chapter and the 9th verse Isaiah 28 and
[13:02] ver9 For Whom Shall he teach knowledge
[13:04] and Whom Shall he make to understand
[13:06] Doctrine them that are winged from the
[13:09] milk and drawn from the breast for
[13:10] precept must be upon precept and line
[13:14] must be upon line and here a little and
[13:16] there a little but with stammering lips
[13:18] and other tongue will I speak unto this
[13:20] people to whom he said this is the rest
[13:23] somebody say the rest this is the rest
[13:27] amen this is the rest where with you may
[13:29] cause the weary to rest and this is the
[13:32] refreshing yet they would not hear amen
[13:35] this is the rest now that's a powerful
[13:37] thing because that's exactly what the
[13:40] promised land was going to be to Israel
[13:42] it was going to be their rest it was
[13:44] going to be their inheritance it was
[13:46] going to be land that belonged to them
[13:48] amen they didn't have to leave it they
[13:50] didn't have to set it aside they didn't
[13:53] they didn't have to say well this
[13:54] belongs to the Egyptians and we can't
[13:56] have it and and and we got to move on
[13:58] but but this would be their land of rest
[14:01] the same as the baptism of the Holy
[14:03] Ghost would be the place of rest for the
[14:06] believer in the last days now I can go
[14:08] to Hebrews the 4th chapter and you can
[14:10] see that Paul said this that we should
[14:12] fear unless a promise remains for the
[14:15] church now what promise is it that would
[14:17] take the fear from the church it was a
[14:20] promise of the spirit of God and then
[14:22] Paul goes on to say that Jesus did not
[14:25] give us another day to bring rest unto
[14:27] us he says but he said unto us come unto
[14:31] me all ye that are weak and heavy laden
[14:33] and I will give you rest now you all
[14:36] know through scripture there's three
[14:38] rest right there's a rest with God in
[14:40] the beginning he created seven days and
[14:42] a rest came and then whenever the law
[14:45] came they put the seventh day keep it
[14:47] holy and he gave them a rest but but but
[14:50] brother Bram says but the third rest
[14:52] which Paul is talking about was when God
[14:55] gave a rest to the People by coming into
[14:57] them and when God comes into a person it
[15:01] is a rest from their labors it is a rest
[15:04] from wearing whether I'm going to make
[15:06] it or I'm not going to make it it's a
[15:08] it's a place of coming out of that Amen
[15:11] to the altar everynight trying to figure
[15:13] out if I'm saved do I have the Holy
[15:15] Ghost am I going to be wearing now I
[15:16] don't mind somebody coming to the altar
[15:18] you can come all you want amen but it's
[15:20] a terrible thing to see a demon
[15:22] tormenting a person on something that's
[15:24] valuable as eternal life there's nothing
[15:27] worse than seeing amen someone
[15:29] constantly struggling am I saved do I
[15:31] have the Holy Ghost don't I have the
[15:33] Holy Ghost do I have it don't I have it
[15:35] it's a struggle and the devil is the
[15:37] only one that would torment a person
[15:39] like that when the Bible predicts and
[15:42] gives you a promise of Eternal salvation
[15:45] by receiving the baptism of the Holy
[15:47] Ghost listen Jesus ain't going to die
[15:49] again the blood ain't going to be shed
[15:51] again the Holy Ghost is not going to be
[15:54] given again so tonight it's really not
[15:56] how much we pray it's how much we
[15:58] receive the promise that God has sent in
[16:01] this age I don't know about you but I'm
[16:03] ready to accept everything that God has
[16:06] for my life amen listen to me young
[16:08] people if you've been worrying in that
[16:10] place let me say to you amen quit
[16:12] worrying about it and receive What the
[16:14] Lord Has give you by a promise and then
[16:18] you drive your steak in the ground and
[16:20] you say God has made me a promise and
[16:23] here I'm going to
[16:25] stand amen now I I know what I'm talking
[16:28] about cuz amen if you don't get to that
[16:30] place in your life every time you say a
[16:32] little something wrong every time say
[16:34] you feel a little something wrong then
[16:35] there you go back wondering do I have it
[16:37] don't I have it but see what he's saying
[16:39] here is there's a promise to the church
[16:42] that they can come out of that place and
[16:44] they can rest and they can rest amen you
[16:48] see when the battle's over that's when
[16:50] madick met Abraham right when the battle
[16:53] was over when the Battle of life was
[16:55] settled amen now you got to battle it
[16:57] out but when that when that that battle
[16:59] settled don't ever let someone take that
[17:03] from
[17:04] you it is the foundation of the peace in
[17:07] your life don't ever let someone place
[17:10] your a Salvation on
[17:13] works right now I'm I'm I'm standing
[17:16] where a prophet's at I know right where
[17:17] I'm at he said legalism is not in this
[17:20] Bible at
[17:22] all it's not on this Bible at all now if
[17:25] there was some way to work our way in
[17:28] when Jes Jesus was in The Garden of
[17:30] Gethsemane and he made an Earnest prayer
[17:33] he was bleeding sweat drops from his
[17:36] brow the first shedding of seven
[17:38] sheddings of blood was for the will of
[17:41] mankind and he was saying father not my
[17:44] will thy will be done if there be any
[17:48] other way if there be any other way let
[17:52] this cup pass from me amen and we found
[17:55] out there's no other way for a man to be
[17:58] saved saved there's no other way for a
[18:00] man to be saved than that that they
[18:02] receive the Covenant blood of Jesus
[18:05] Christ and as you receive it you receive
[18:08] it by faith and when you comes into the
[18:10] heart God seals the Heart by the baptism
[18:12] of the Holy Ghost and then you got a
[18:14] ride it's a Greek or a bond or a male or
[18:17] a free don't matter where you are from
[18:19] and what your belief was when God Saves
[18:21] you you're saved and you're Sav for Time
[18:23] and
[18:25] Eternity amen now we're talking about
[18:27] something powerful here
[18:28] because we we see amen that this that
[18:31] this book of Ephesians is not just
[18:34] written to
[18:36] anybody how many realizes that this book
[18:39] is addressed to somebody it's literally
[18:41] a letter addressed to a people now the
[18:45] prophet will tell us this he says watch
[18:47] Paul said Paul an apostle of Jesus
[18:49] Christ by the will of God and to the
[18:50] Saints which are at Ephesus and to the
[18:54] faithful in Christ Jesus I I mean I just
[18:57] I don't we don't don't have time to
[18:58] preach on every Point here but but I
[19:00] thought it was interesting Daniel that
[19:02] that it introduces him as Paul now
[19:05] there's an entire sermon right there
[19:07] amen it says Paul now that ain't his
[19:09] name Paul is not this man's name
[19:12] actually his name is Saul he was born to
[19:15] Saul he was a he was he was actually
[19:17] born to The Tribe of Benjamin and
[19:20] circumcised on the eighth day and
[19:21] according to Paul's testimony he said
[19:24] concerning the law he was completely
[19:26] blameless and concern earning Zeal he
[19:29] was killing Christians but when he went
[19:32] to do against the will of God look at
[19:34] the god who's rich in Mercy that man set
[19:37] out to kill Christians and it was the
[19:39] Zeal of his heart to do it but God is so
[19:43] merciful that he stopped him in his
[19:45] tracks can you imagine that God had to
[19:48] Blind him to let him see what he needed
[19:50] to see God had to take his natural side
[19:52] to give him spiritual side I know you
[19:55] thank God all the time for things you do
[19:57] for you you but sometimes you are to
[19:59] thank God for the things he kept you
[20:02] from sometimes you are to thank God for
[20:05] the things he kept you from and listen
[20:07] to Paul's testimony here he is his
[20:09] name's Saul and he's a self-righteous
[20:12] Pharisee he has the law on his side and
[20:14] he's going but the pillar of fire amen
[20:17] had an elected group who needed a
[20:19] messenger and a an Angelic Covenant that
[20:23] God had made with a gentile church and
[20:25] he needed a messenger and God came to
[20:27] this man in total Grace it was total
[20:30] Grace that spoke to Paul and he said
[20:33] Lord who art thou and he said I am Jesus
[20:35] whom thou persecutest amen that great
[20:38] pillar of light when it be to speak to
[20:40] him amen it it actually caused him to go
[20:42] blind Daniel and the Bible said many
[20:44] people didn't even hear it amen saw the
[20:47] light didn't hear the voice some saw the
[20:49] uh I believe they saw heard the voice
[20:50] didn't see the light amen but Paul went
[20:53] to the city uh uh the city and actually
[20:55] went to the Straight Street I I pre
[20:58] preached a sermon one time on getting
[20:59] straight on Straight Street you know
[21:01] amen he was so crooked amen he needed a
[21:04] place to get straight his his his
[21:07] understandings was so messed up he look
[21:09] now look how did Paul get to the right
[21:12] place he had to go to the pillar fire he
[21:14] had to bypass even the Pharisees of his
[21:18] time Amen in Galatians when Paul comes
[21:20] back he said I went three years in the
[21:22] desert and discovered I never learned
[21:25] this Revelation he said in any of my
[21:27] brethren or even up in Jerusalem I never
[21:29] went conferred with the disciples but
[21:31] the Revelation which he had was so
[21:33] Superior to all the other uh disciples
[21:37] that he said even if an angel would come
[21:38] and say something different than what I
[21:40] say let him be a cursed now from there
[21:43] is where brother brandham gets the
[21:45] statement amen that a a redeemed son on
[21:48] the Earth has more power than an angel
[21:51] in
[21:52] heaven he said so this redeemed son so
[21:55] here he meant he changes his name and
[21:57] brings it to Paul now Paul who has been
[22:00] converted met the pillar of fire knows
[22:02] what he's dealing with comes back to the
[22:04] church and writes a letter amen and he
[22:07] says it's by the will of God now I think
[22:09] it's Bing I was reading this this today
[22:11] in believer's position of Christ and
[22:13] brother man gets to talking about the
[22:14] will of God and he said see he said it's
[22:17] like he he confirms Paul he said it was
[22:19] like me that time he said I went down to
[22:20] this Pentecostal church he said man he
[22:23] said there was this girl got out in the
[22:24] aisle and she got to shouting and
[22:25] dancing he said she's dancing all over
[22:27] the building and he said and I got to
[22:29] think it he said I didn't say it now he
[22:31] said but in my heart I thought she was
[22:33] flat
[22:35] wrong I'm I'm just quoting him he said I
[22:37] thought I was that she was flat wrong he
[22:40] said so when I went back down to the to
[22:42] my church he said they got to sing in
[22:44] that meet in the air one time he said
[22:46] next thing I know he said I was out
[22:47] there doing the same thing he said see
[22:50] it was by the will of God now look what
[22:53] he's doing he's taking Paul and he's
[22:55] saying by the will of God something that
[22:58] he thought was flat wrong he found out
[23:00] he was doing himself brother man in this
[23:03] very verse is using that Paul who
[23:06] thought the Gentiles were flat wrong who
[23:08] thought Christianity was flat wrong amen
[23:12] but now by the will of God Amen he's
[23:14] going to open a door of Vance unto the
[23:16] whole Realm of the Gentile church
[23:19] because God who is rich in Mercy has
[23:21] come to this man Paul an apostle by the
[23:24] will of God I I tell you what you could
[23:25] preach a while on this cuz brother Ram
[23:27] says it what by the S hendred Council it
[23:30] wasn't by a group of men by laying on
[23:32] hands they didn't come along brother B
[23:33] said the latter day you you latter rain
[23:35] people he said you think that I'm
[23:36] persecuting the church he said I'm not
[23:38] he said but it's got to be by the will
[23:40] of God see because they want to ordain
[23:42] gifts in the church you know what he's
[23:45] brother man puts out a lot in this verse
[23:47] but he says in the light of rain y'all
[23:49] know they want to make they want to lay
[23:50] hands make prophets out of people but
[23:53] everybody should know prophets or born
[23:56] Prophets You Don't become a prophet
[23:58] you're born a prophet and brother man is
[24:01] teaching us the difference he says see
[24:03] here Paul is an apostle by the will of
[24:07] God it wasn't what somebody wanted him
[24:09] to do or what he wanted to do but it was
[24:12] what God called him to do and he was
[24:14] called to them that are faithful in
[24:17] Christ Jesus I think it's beautiful to
[24:19] the Saints which are in Christ Jesus
[24:22] we're in Catholic country up here and
[24:24] and and most people think Saints has got
[24:26] to be dead you know everybody thinks
[24:28] Saints got to be dead it ain't no living
[24:30] Saints but brother Bram said but Saint
[24:33] actually means a Sanctified one amen he
[24:36] said now if you start praying to Saints
[24:38] he says you're communing with the
[24:41] dead amen I don't know a lot about All
[24:43] Saints Day but I know we got some
[24:45] Halloween coming up and if you want to
[24:47] know what I think about it I don't
[24:48] disagree with brother Ry on that at all
[24:50] I think it's a bunch of heathenism is
[24:52] what I think about it you do whatever
[24:53] you want to but if you want to know what
[24:55] I think and there it is amen I think I
[24:58] think that if you start communing with
[24:59] the dead you're communing with the dead
[25:02] and it's it's a it's a somebody said
[25:04] well brother Brandon don't you believe
[25:06] in talking to Jesus ain't he dead he
[25:08] said oh there's a big difference see he
[25:10] said Jesus raised from the dead and he's
[25:13] alive forever more so we're not here
[25:15] tonight amen we're not here tonight
[25:17] communing with the dead man amen but our
[25:19] lord Jesus is raised from the grave and
[25:22] he's alive forever more amen it's Saints
[25:25] which are in Ephesus now I know they
[25:27] want to wait till they die to make them
[25:28] a saint amen but there are real saints
[25:31] that are alive and I believe they're in
[25:33] this building tonight I believe we have
[25:35] real saints right here in this building
[25:38] tonight Saints of the Lord saints of God
[25:41] Sanctified unto the Lord see Sanctified
[25:44] sanctified people to the faithful that
[25:47] are in Christ Jesus don't you love it
[25:48] that he don't just say Sanctified but he
[25:50] said to the faithful that are in Christ
[25:53] Jesus to the faithful who are in Christ
[25:56] Jesus so this book is being addressed uh
[25:59] to the elected church it's being to them
[26:03] that are
[26:04] predestinated and listen how closely
[26:06] brother B says we'll get to it in a few
[26:08] moments Paul is speaking or addressing
[26:10] Ephesians 1 directly straight to the
[26:13] solder shoulder of the church that's
[26:15] what they're doing tonight this is not
[26:17] for babies this is for
[26:19] grown-ups this is not for babies he says
[26:22] this is for grown-ups amen we're trying
[26:25] to get to full Doctrine see now watch
[26:27] what he's going to do he said who's he
[26:29] dressing not a bunch of babies but to
[26:32] the people that are set in Heavenly
[26:34] places and be blessed he said you know
[26:36] something you've been taught you've been
[26:39] saved and I want to tell you what it's
[26:41] about look at the beauty of that you've
[26:44] been saved now the book of Ephesians is
[26:46] going to tell you what it's about amen
[26:49] when you when you when you start
[26:50] approaching this this an this this will
[26:53] answer a great big area and a great
[26:55] question if you're a studier you're
[26:57] going to see something way far beyond
[26:59] what I'm talking to you tonight about
[27:01] but you're going to see that the book of
[27:02] Ephesians is to people who are already
[27:05] saved the book of Ephesians is not a
[27:08] book that you read to get saved or get
[27:11] the Holy Ghost it's a book to people who
[27:13] are already saved now watch this because
[27:16] you're going to find immediately the
[27:18] book of Ephesians is an adoption book
[27:22] the book of Ephesians is a positionally
[27:24] placed book the book of Ephesians is a
[27:27] josh book now what's he who's he
[27:29] addressing he's addressing to them that
[27:32] are already saved amen he has chosen Us
[27:36] in him before the world began now this
[27:39] book is not to everybody right this book
[27:42] is not to everybody in Genesis 17 and4
[27:46] you will find that the Covenant that God
[27:48] made was not with everybody it was with
[27:50] Abraham's seed right when God made a
[27:53] covenant with the Earth he made that
[27:55] Covenant with Abraham's seed let's read
[27:57] here as for me behold my Covenant is
[27:59] with thee and thou sh be a father of
[28:01] many nations now neither shall thy name
[28:03] anymore be called Abram but thy name
[28:06] Shall be Called Abraham look at that
[28:08] change of names Saul Paul Abram Abraham
[28:11] amen and a father of many nations I have
[28:14] made thee and I will make thee exceeding
[28:17] fruitful and I will make nations of
[28:20] these and Kings shall come out of thee
[28:23] my goodness we didn't got enough time to
[28:25] preach on that one and Kings shall come
[28:28] out of theee do you do you recognize
[28:31] that he's talking about that whole line
[28:33] of David he's talking about the king of
[28:36] King that whole line of Kings is going
[28:39] to come out of him amen but it's not
[28:41] even to mention the Gentile Kingdom amen
[28:44] where there will be spiritual kings that
[28:47] will come right out of Abraham's loins
[28:49] amen because he'll be a father of Kings
[28:52] Amen in other words we are a royal
[28:54] lineage of Abraham we are not we are not
[28:57] of the ishma church we are not of one of
[29:01] the 12 uh different uh sons that Abraham
[29:04] had but we've come out of the Royal Line
[29:06] amen we've come out of the royal seed
[29:09] amen where it all belongs to you and I
[29:12] look at what he says here and he will
[29:14] establish Amen brother Braham switches
[29:16] the word he says predestinate my
[29:18] Covenant he said between me and thee and
[29:21] thy seed after thee and their
[29:24] generations for an Everlasting Covenant
[29:26] and be un
[29:27] God unto thee and to the seed after thee
[29:30] and I will give unto thee and to thy
[29:31] seed after thee the land wherein thou
[29:33] are a stranger and all the land of
[29:35] Canaan for an everlasting possession I
[29:37] will be their God now that's that's
[29:39] exactly what's going over there right
[29:41] now in Israel is the the Palestinians
[29:45] coming from the ishel line they want to
[29:47] take over the Jewish property that God
[29:50] gave them under a covenant to Abraham
[29:53] and Drew out the borders Joshua has the
[29:56] maps it come from an entire birth line
[29:59] that they they belong there it belongs
[30:02] to them but ishmael's line says we are
[30:04] Seed of Abraham as well and it's going
[30:06] to belong to us and there's a war going
[30:08] on but one of them really owns
[30:11] it it really belongs to one of them well
[30:15] there is also a spiritual seat of
[30:17] Abraham which is the Gentile church and
[30:21] our inheritance is not the land of
[30:23] Israel it's the power of the Holy Ghost
[30:26] it's the spiritual land of almighty God
[30:29] that we have been an inheritor in that
[30:31] Land by the grace of God you see amen we
[30:34] were predestinated into it so people say
[30:37] well by the way then when you start
[30:38] preaching these promises they're to
[30:40] everybody they're not to everybody
[30:42] they're to Abraham's
[30:44] seed amen do you see what it is brother
[30:46] manam says it like this Christ was
[30:48] predestinated he was the royal Seed of
[30:51] Abraham do you see that he was the royal
[30:53] Seed of Abraham ishmail was not that
[30:55] seed Isaac was not that seed Jesus was
[30:59] that
[30:59] seed so Sarah didn't have Abraham's
[31:02] Royal seed Mary had Abraham's Royal
[31:06] seed remember it one was by a doubted
[31:09] promise one was through the works of the
[31:11] flesh but the next one was by promise
[31:14] amen and Mary had that seed see what it
[31:17] was when the spirit come on Christ he
[31:19] bore record of the word of God and when
[31:22] the water spirit falls on the word seed
[31:25] the Royal Seed of Abraham faith in God's
[31:28] word will produce the same kind of crop
[31:30] amen you said well I don't believe that
[31:32] he said well then go back to Genesis 17
[31:34] and read it and he reads the scripture
[31:36] we just read he says what does Abraham
[31:39] see now it's not his flesh see Paul said
[31:43] Jew is the Jew outward is not the real
[31:46] Jew it's the Jew inwardly and what is
[31:49] the Seed of Abraham those that believe
[31:52] the whole word of God oh my goodness
[31:55] isn't that powerful tonight he amen
[31:57] those that believe the whole word of God
[31:59] you say well am I Abraham's seed do you
[32:01] believe the whole word of God then
[32:03] you're Abraham seed you see amen isn't
[32:06] that what the real battle is about amen
[32:09] what seed you're of Amen look at how
[32:12] many times you've had the devil say to
[32:14] you amen there's a Rapture but not for
[32:16] you there's a real Prophet but you ain't
[32:18] a part of it there's a real bride but
[32:20] you're not a part of it amen There's
[32:21] real promises but you're not a part of
[32:23] it but see if you believe the whole word
[32:25] of God it qualifies you as Abraham's
[32:28] seed and you're an heir according to the
[32:31] promise listen amen thank God that he
[32:34] put it in
[32:36] believing thank God he put it in
[32:38] believing now I can go to Romans 4 with
[32:40] you he said this is to the shity of all
[32:43] of the Seed of Abraham remember that it
[32:45] was the shity of all seed that it might
[32:48] be by grace that the Heathen would
[32:51] receive the Promise by the hearing of
[32:54] the word of God in that amazing that's
[32:57] how Rahab was converted it was by the
[33:00] hearing of the word of God she didn't
[33:03] see the Red Sea open but she believed it
[33:06] she didn't see Joshua's commission but
[33:09] she believed it and because she believed
[33:11] it she was a part of it and to think
[33:14] tonight amen the devil can torment us
[33:17] but he can't keep us from believing the
[33:19] word of God in this age listen let me
[33:22] just say it very clearly I didn't see
[33:25] that bridge fall but I believe believe
[33:28] it I didn't see that dead boy raised up
[33:31] but I believe it I didn't see the angel
[33:34] come to the prophet but I believe it I
[33:37] didn't see it with my own eyes that
[33:39] Pillar of Fire in Sam Houston but I
[33:42] believe it anyhow and I tell you the
[33:45] Seed of Abraham can believe the
[33:48] impossible I know the devil will fight
[33:50] you on everything he can fight you on
[33:52] but there is where you stand and say I
[33:55] believe it anyhow
[33:57] [Music]
[33:58] see he can torment you but he can't keep
[34:00] you from
[34:02] believing what is the Seed of Abraham
[34:05] it's them that believe the whole word of
[34:07] God regardless of what denomination Papa
[34:09] Mama or anybody says they believe the
[34:11] whole word of God I will establish my
[34:13] Covenant right now predestinate my
[34:16] Covenant with the seed and in each
[34:19] generation they will believe it there
[34:21] you are the Seed of Abraham now watch
[34:23] God said I will establish it with a seed
[34:28] I'm making my promise with a seed the
[34:32] book of Ephesians is not to everybody
[34:34] it's to the believer it's to the
[34:37] spiritual Jew it's to the person that
[34:40] believes the whole word of God that's
[34:42] who this book of Ephesians is written to
[34:44] to the faithful who are in Christ Jesus
[34:48] can we just read it go over to the book
[34:50] of Corinthians let's read Corinthians uh
[34:52] the 12th chapter let's see see what he
[34:54] says here uh First Corinth Ians CH 12
[34:58] isn't it verse 13 I didn't write it down
[35:01] but let's let's let's just get it from
[35:03] memory here first Corinthians chapter 12
[35:06] and verse 13 for by one
[35:10] Spirit can somebody say
[35:13] Spirit by one Spirit by one Spirit we
[35:16] are all baptized into one body isn't
[35:21] that beautiful amen whether we be Jews
[35:23] or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free
[35:26] have been made all to drink into one
[35:29] spirit amen oh my by one spirit I love
[35:32] how brother B he'll said it over and
[35:34] over by one Spirit we are baptized into
[35:37] one body what spirit is it then it's the
[35:40] spirit of God that is baptized the
[35:43] church back into the body of Christ it's
[35:45] the spirit of God that has opened up and
[35:48] put man back in the corridors of Glory
[35:50] it's the spirit of God that has baptized
[35:53] you into your original genetics and put
[35:55] you in the body of of God put you air to
[35:58] every promise of God but it's the word
[36:01] that teaches you who you are hallelujah
[36:05] amen it took the book of Ephesians to
[36:07] declare to the church we have rights
[36:11] here man we were born yes we were
[36:13] birthed but what's the rights of the
[36:15] church amen I think it's a powerful
[36:18] thing by one Spirit we are baptized into
[36:20] one body can we catch another set of
[36:21] scriptures galatian chapter 3 and let's
[36:24] look in the eth verse if you're gonna
[36:25] bring it up I won't turn there Galatians
[36:27] chapter 3 and let's look in the eth
[36:28] verse powerful
[36:31] scriptures if you're if you're looking
[36:33] at this it's powerful
[36:35] scriptures Galatians chapter 3 and the
[36:38] scripture foreseeing that God would
[36:40] justify the Heathen through faith
[36:41] preached before the gospel unto
[36:44] them Abraham saying in thee shall All
[36:47] Nations be blessed isn't that powerful
[36:51] keep moving that so then they which be
[36:54] of Faith are blessed with faithful
[36:57] Abraham keep moving it for as many as
[37:00] are the works of the law under the curse
[37:02] for it is written cursed is everyone
[37:05] that continueth not in all things which
[37:07] were written in the book of the law to
[37:09] do
[37:10] them but that no man is justified by the
[37:13] law in the sight of God it is evidence
[37:17] that just shall live by faith keep
[37:19] moving now amen you see and the law is
[37:22] not of Faith but the man that doeth them
[37:25] shall live in them them yeah Christ hath
[37:29] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[37:33] being made a curse for us for it is
[37:35] written curse it is everyone that
[37:38] hangeth on a tree now look at the curse
[37:41] that was over the people the curse that
[37:43] was over the church amen but brother
[37:44] Levi he didn't stop halfway up the hill
[37:47] amen he didn't stop I I tell you
[37:50] sometimes it's just staggering to see
[37:52] what Christ done and I I heard brother B
[37:54] on tape this morning he said it like
[37:56] like this he said the anointing left him
[37:59] and he went there as a man I thought oh
[38:02] God what kind of love could push a man
[38:05] without anointing I know what it is to
[38:07] get up in the pull pit and begin to
[38:09] preach and sometimes the anointing is
[38:10] not as powerful as it is other times but
[38:13] you have a duty to do amen and you press
[38:15] through it and any of you ever preach
[38:17] kind of knows that feeling amen but but
[38:19] there's love in your heart and you go on
[38:21] and start carrying out the commission
[38:23] then you feel the anointing as it begins
[38:25] to build amen but you see our lord Jesus
[38:28] operated completely without anointing in
[38:31] the last moments of his life but he knew
[38:34] his position with God was to take the
[38:37] curse away from Mankind and it could
[38:40] only be done through that cross oh amen
[38:43] I'll tell you this how far did he go
[38:45] brother he went far enough to rebuke the
[38:48] curse can I say it like this the spell
[38:51] has been broken off of the church
[38:54] because Jesus went all the way and
[38:56] because he went all the way you and I
[38:59] could go all the way we don't have to
[39:01] stop tonight in justification we don't
[39:04] have to stop in sanctification but we
[39:06] can go on unto the baptism of the Holy
[39:09] Ghost where every Power has been given
[39:12] to the church my goodness what is it
[39:15] it's a breakthrough a Revival the curse
[39:17] has been taken off the curse of sin the
[39:20] curse that you were born under amen it
[39:23] has been broken off of
[39:25] you my goodness somebody said well what
[39:29] you can bring it back up now heyen do
[39:31] you see the curse was
[39:35] moved that the blessing could
[39:38] come y'all y'all immediately brother
[39:40] Bram goes back in the Old Testament puts
[39:42] Jacob isn't it Jacob when he's blessing
[39:44] his the name's Jacob yeah it's when
[39:46] Jacob they go down and Jacob's blessing
[39:48] his sons there and when he brings the
[39:50] Elder and brings the younger and he
[39:53] crosses his hands and he starts putting
[39:56] the the blessing on the wrong one and
[39:58] they said father you're blessing the
[40:00] wrong one he said I know but God has
[40:04] crossed my hands and brother R said
[40:06] there it was in the cross there the
[40:09] crossing of the hands took the blessing
[40:11] from one and put it on the other and
[40:13] there at Calvary God took the blessing
[40:16] and laid it on the Gentiles amen though
[40:19] what a blessing tonight blessed with all
[40:22] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[40:25] brother man said it like this he said
[40:27] see if you're outside of the Kingdom
[40:29] it's just emotions he said but oh if
[40:32] you're inside there it's spiritual
[40:35] blessings in Christ Jesus Heath redeemed
[40:38] us from the curse which is written
[40:39] cursed is everyone that hangeth on the
[40:42] tree let's continue down that verse The
[40:44] Blessing of Abraham might come on the
[40:46] Gentiles through Christ which we might
[40:48] receive the promise of the spirit
[40:51] through faith my goodness Brethren I
[40:54] speak after the manner of men though it
[40:56] be a man's Covenant yet be confirmed no
[40:58] man dis knowth or adth there un let's
[41:01] keep going we're going to go back down
[41:02] to the 20 of something verse now to
[41:04] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[41:06] made and he saith not unto thy seeds as
[41:10] of many but as of thy one and to thy
[41:14] seed which is
[41:17] Christ one seed watch this many
[41:22] promises look at that there's a plural
[41:25] on the word promise
[41:27] and there's not on the word seed and to
[41:30] thy seeds as of many but as of one to
[41:32] thy seed which is Christ you got one
[41:35] Christ now if you study the message
[41:37] that's a powerful thought because in the
[41:39] Bible in Matthew 24:24 he said there
[41:42] would be Christ and false Christ with a
[41:45] plural brother said be many of them
[41:47] Christ he said but one true Christ one
[41:51] real seed and here he's saying one seed
[41:54] but a lot of promises amen but it's
[41:57] given through one C continue into the
[41:59] next verse and this I say the Covenant
[42:01] that was confirmed before of God in
[42:03] Christ the law which was 430 years
[42:05] cannot disan know that should make the
[42:07] promise of God of none
[42:10] effect for if the inheritance be of the
[42:13] law it is no more a promise but God gave
[42:16] it to Abraham by promise it's a
[42:18] beautiful set of scriptures wherefore
[42:20] the service the law it was added because
[42:22] of transgressions till the seed should
[42:24] come to whom the promise was made and
[42:26] ordained by angels in the hand of a
[42:29] mediator it's like Paul knew something
[42:31] here huh now there is a
[42:34] mediator is not a mediator of a one but
[42:37] of God is
[42:41] one in the law against the promises of
[42:44] God God forbid if there had been a law
[42:46] given which could have given life verily
[42:48] righteousness should have been by the
[42:50] law amen I I I think it's the actually
[42:53] the 208th verse we're looking for there
[42:56] amen you'll see it the promise of Faith
[42:58] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[43:00] believe there is neither Jew nor Greek
[43:03] there is neither Bond or free there is
[43:06] neither male nor female for you are all
[43:09] one in Christ
[43:11] Jesus amen you are all one in Christ
[43:15] Jesus so being born into Christ makes
[43:18] you Abraham's seed and HS according to
[43:23] the promise now look at the power
[43:26] because now we're talking about amen
[43:28] that this is this is coming to a certain
[43:31] people the book of Ephesians is not to
[43:34] everybody it's to a certain people it's
[43:37] to the Seed of Abraham the believer the
[43:41] spiritually birthed people in this age
[43:44] now the prophet of God let us know this
[43:46] he said see who did it God when did he
[43:49] do it before the foundation of the world
[43:52] then if we come in an illegitimate birth
[43:54] through Eve's corruption
[43:57] making us all her children and subject
[44:00] to death then the Sovereign God has to
[44:03] make a way to redeem his children all
[44:07] the father hath given me will come and
[44:08] no man come unless my father draws him
[44:13] now it's amazing to me the book of
[44:16] Ephesians will parallel the Book of
[44:19] Joshua this was brother bram's
[44:22] Ministry
[44:24] Joshua in the Paradox in 65 brother Bram
[44:27] said a few years ago I could take my
[44:30] Bible if you didn't know this about
[44:31] brother Bram is a it's something
[44:32] powerful to know but it could take his
[44:34] Bible and he could get in front of
[44:36] somebody and say what is my commission
[44:39] and he could just lay his Bible down and
[44:41] it would fall open to Joshua the first
[44:43] chapter yeah every time yeah now if you
[44:47] go ahead and try that with your own
[44:48] Bible sometimes you'll find the balance
[44:49] don't
[44:51] work that's that's there's that's a
[44:53] pretty fat part and a pretty thin part
[44:56] it splits at the right part now that
[44:59] split was done by the hand of God now it
[45:03] was a few years later he kept telling
[45:05] people this but then one night brother
[45:08] Ram said a vision came and he said a
[45:10] Bible come out of the ceiling I can just
[45:13] imagine sitting in my
[45:15] office and a Bible come out of the
[45:18] ceiling and a hand read the first nine
[45:21] verses of the Book of Joshua to brother
[45:24] brandham and brother B says that hand
[45:27] came and read them now that's where he
[45:30] takes his text for the message Paradox
[45:33] from those first nine verses in the
[45:36] Paradox brother bam will tell us that
[45:38] when we cross the
[45:40] Jordan that's where all the promises are
[45:44] laying we'll get into the vision later
[45:46] but that's where all the promises are
[45:48] laying is on the other side of Jordan
[45:51] other words on the other side of the
[45:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost that that's
[45:56] where all the promises are laying amen
[45:59] do you see every promise lays in the
[46:02] promised
[46:03] land amen a Believer can come to
[46:06] recognition that he needs to be saved
[46:08] then he comes to a stage of
[46:09] sanctification now I will say this in
[46:11] passing tonight sanctification is a
[46:14] place you got to go but a place you
[46:16] can't
[46:18] stay CU that is that fair enough it's a
[46:21] place you got to go but a place you
[46:24] can't stay
[46:26] right because this is the Wilderness
[46:29] Journey for the for the church it was in
[46:32] the age of sanctification in your
[46:34] personal walk brother Bram says if you
[46:37] repent and get Sanctified and don't get
[46:39] the Holy Ghost you'll be seven times
[46:41] worse than you were from before he said
[46:44] that's why that Billy Graham has such
[46:46] problems with his converts he says
[46:49] because he makes him a target for the
[46:52] devil he said because he don't build his
[46:55] nest High high enough and the snakes get
[46:58] into the
[46:59] eggs do you see what it is it takes a
[47:02] moving on into the Holy Ghost it takes a
[47:05] a pressing on in to the spirit of God
[47:08] you got to cross it you got to you got
[47:09] to go to sanctification but you can't
[47:12] stay there you can't just stay in the
[47:15] Sanctified life and say this has got it
[47:17] this has got it this has got it it
[47:18] creates legalism and I just just since
[47:21] we're at home and I'm just preaching
[47:23] I'll say this some of the meanest people
[47:26] you ever met were religious sanctified
[47:29] people the meanest people you ever met
[47:32] in your life is people that only went to
[47:34] sanctification and they never got the
[47:37] Holy Ghost cuz if they would have got
[47:39] the Holy Ghost they'd have had some long
[47:41] suffering and some gentleness and some
[47:44] kindness and some peace and they would
[47:46] have had something in them for a little
[47:47] kindness but you just take a now we just
[47:50] we just come out of the age
[47:52] sanctification and they come up so far
[47:54] but they wouldn't go into the holy
[47:55] Spirit In other words they wouldn't let
[47:57] a divine nature come in amen and they
[48:00] got Sanctified and it just made them
[48:02] religious and made them mean and they
[48:04] keep up with how many services you miss
[48:06] and they keep up
[48:09] how y'all know what I'm talking about
[48:12] it's all a set of rules but listen I
[48:15] don't know about y'all I've had all the
[48:17] religion I
[48:18] want I've had all the measuring tapes
[48:21] and all the rule books and all I've had
[48:24] all of that I want amen but if we get
[48:26] the spirit of God on the inside of us
[48:30] amen he's our leader he's our guide he's
[48:32] our teacher and we're not doing these
[48:35] things because amen somebody said we
[48:37] couldn't we do it because we love God
[48:40] and we want to be a good influence in
[48:41] this age we don't want to be no
[48:43] stumbling block we don't want to cause
[48:45] somebody to stumble over our lives amen
[48:47] so we give our hearts to Christ and we
[48:49] move on in there it's in Ephesus brother
[48:52] B says he says in Ephesus after the day
[48:55] of Pentecost see there comes an Ephesus
[48:58] brings us positionally like in Joshua
[49:01] see what happens is is Joshua wasn't
[49:04] taking these people just anywhere he was
[49:06] taking them to a place their name was
[49:09] on now now many of you know this some of
[49:12] you might not but Jacob had 12 sons and
[49:15] those sons names were the names of the
[49:18] 12 tribes of Israel it would be like
[49:20] George washingon had 50 kids and some of
[49:23] them were named Arkansas Michigan
[49:25] Louisiana
[49:26] so the the the the name of the tribe was
[49:30] the name of one of the sons of Jacob
[49:33] which had his name changed to Israel so
[49:36] Israel had 12 sons the nation Israel had
[49:40] 12 tribes and 12 states of land that was
[49:43] divided in 12 places but the division of
[49:46] that land was not by Joshua's own
[49:49] thinking but in Genesis the 30th chapter
[49:52] when those children were born there
[49:55] mothers now think about this their
[49:57] mothers when they were birthing those
[49:59] children cried out a name and a labor
[50:02] pain and the prophet said that name that
[50:05] they cried out positionally placed
[50:08] Israel in its Homeland and he said the
[50:11] name represented by the well over the
[50:13] wall next to the Sea it represented
[50:16] where they belonged amen and there they
[50:18] were birthed and went into that
[50:20] Wilderness and there they went into
[50:22] Egypt and there they were 400 years at
[50:25] away from it but after 400 years God
[50:29] still remembered where they belonged God
[50:32] still remembered where they was at and
[50:34] how they were going to get there but
[50:36] when Joshua come unto them it was the
[50:38] grace of God that could look at a tribe
[50:41] and say that's your land and that's your
[50:44] land and that's your land now amen it's
[50:48] exactly The Inheritance that we're
[50:49] talking about in the book of Ephesians
[50:52] amen it was a division of the land
[50:53] casting lots and placing them each one
[50:56] but the prophet speaking of you and I
[50:58] said God had us in his mind from before
[51:02] the world began remember that he put our
[51:06] names on the Lamb's Book of Life from
[51:08] before the foundation of the world and
[51:10] when he spoke I wondered one time how
[51:12] did he put my name on the
[51:14] book y'all ever wonder that how did he
[51:17] write my name on the book I tell you
[51:19] what I like to shatter my heels off when
[51:21] I found
[51:22] it brother Bram said he' spoke your name
[51:28] yeah that's why the spoken word calls
[51:31] your
[51:32] name it was written by the spoken word
[51:35] and you're called by the spoken word but
[51:38] the spoken word of this message matches
[51:41] the spoken word that was in the mind of
[51:44] God that's why the Baptist can't place
[51:46] you and that's why the Lutheran can't
[51:48] tell you who you are that's why that the
[51:51] Pentecostals could never position the
[51:53] church cuz they didn't have the mind of
[51:56] God but this message has opened up the
[51:59] mind of God and a prophet has spoke back
[52:02] the adoption Authority into the church
[52:04] Calling You by
[52:07] name oh he spoke your name position he
[52:10] placed you gave you a promise now let me
[52:13] say this when a prophet begin to to to
[52:15] divvy up this and he begin to split this
[52:18] inheritance brother Greg early on Amen
[52:20] brother Bram couldn't tell the
[52:22] difference sometimes between Israel
[52:23] promises and Gentile promises when we
[52:25] first come into the land he said some
[52:27] things mixing it up but you watch as we
[52:30] get closer to 65 Things become clearer
[52:33] and clearer and clearer and as he gets
[52:35] to the end of it he starts saying things
[52:38] like the bride can do Greater Works he
[52:40] starts saying things like the spoken
[52:42] word is a part of your inheritance and
[52:45] what's he doing he's dividing those
[52:47] things into the church as an inheritance
[52:50] of you and I as Sons and Daughters of
[52:52] God that promise is not for everybody
[52:55] Mark the 11th chapter Pentecost the
[52:57] world name it claim it has nothing to do
[53:00] with Mark 11th chapter that is for sons
[53:03] of God who are positioned in the
[53:05] promises of God and through Divine
[53:08] orders they can speak the word of
[53:12] God now don't think it'll come without
[53:16] fighting don't think it'll come without
[53:18] fighting if you want to see if you want
[53:20] to see in the natural what you're facing
[53:22] in the spiritual watch Hamas right now
[53:26] and watch Israel right now Israel is
[53:29] there and I could take this Bible and
[53:31] stand here all night and prove to you
[53:33] that it is an eternal land and it
[53:35] belonged to them from before the world
[53:38] began and God gave it to them through
[53:40] prophets he raised it up he certified it
[53:43] and gave it but watch those terrorists
[53:46] attack them on their own land and then
[53:48] the whole world get up in arms because
[53:51] they prend themselves you see the same
[53:54] thing in the Church of the Living God
[53:55] God you see it terrorists attack the
[53:57] move of God they attack the prayer lines
[54:00] they attack the move of the Holy Spirit
[54:02] they attack the dancing in the anointing
[54:04] they attack Every Which Way But if you
[54:06] would turn and defend yourself well he's
[54:08] just fighting well he's just this well
[54:10] he's just this listen folks we got
[54:12] god-given privileges the spoken word
[54:15] belongs to us the moving of the spirit
[54:18] belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to
[54:20] us it is a land that we're living in
[54:23] it's full Doctrine
[54:27] I don't know I've been attacked a lot I
[54:29] know these men of God have I I was
[54:31] laughing the other day and I I don't
[54:33] want to reveal too much of your private
[54:35] testimony so you can tell it later or
[54:37] whatever you want to do but he said when
[54:39] he first come out of a movement I'll
[54:41] just put it that way first come out of a
[54:43] movement well that that movement the
[54:45] teachers the spirit behind it was so
[54:47] rough that any emotion it's Pentecost
[54:51] yeah any emotion it's just Pentecost
[54:54] it's if you cry a little well you're
[54:56] just emotional it's emotional manifest
[54:58] it's just just so they name call the
[55:00] thing to disposition the church from
[55:03] being able just to
[55:04] rest just to just to rest you know I'm
[55:07] watching something happening I probably
[55:09] a little open here but let's just say
[55:11] I'm watching something happening in the
[55:12] world around the churches right now a
[55:14] little war going on of whether we should
[55:16] worship shouldn't worship whether we
[55:18] should or shouldn't what and they're
[55:19] making it to the place where you can't
[55:21] hardly preach no more and just preach
[55:23] the quotes and move home without
[55:25] somebody what's he mean by that what's
[55:26] he mean by that I tell you what we ought
[55:28] to do is just inherit the promise amen
[55:30] forget the devil and everything he said
[55:32] and everything he's got in his mind it's
[55:35] a Church of the Living God we got a
[55:36] right to
[55:38] it I believe it I believe those right
[55:41] are there and I believe God has put men
[55:44] of God into this age amen that can stand
[55:46] here with the promises of God and tell
[55:49] every uncircumcised devil you've got no
[55:52] right to take away what God has G give
[55:55] the church give it in power give it in
[55:58] might I'll take a few minutes in closing
[56:00] y'all okay amen you you see here brother
[56:03] bam says it like this adoption in the
[56:05] message adoption he said teaching is
[56:07] treacherous and I got to agree with him
[56:09] when you get to teaching amen that's
[56:11] where the the the rub starts happening
[56:13] isn't it we get to teaching a little bit
[56:15] but brother Bram says but I think and
[56:17] feel at this point it might be good to
[56:19] bring the church to what I think is a
[56:21] complete understanding
[56:23] positionally of what we are in Christ
[56:26] Jesus and sometimes I think preaching is
[56:28] a wonderful thing and brother biller
[56:31] beer teaching goes beyond the little
[56:33] especially to the church preaching
[56:35] catches The Sinner you've seen it he
[56:38] said brings him under condemnation by
[56:40] the word but teaching places a man
[56:43] positionally what he
[56:45] is and we can never rightly be able to
[56:49] have faith until positionally we know
[56:52] what we are right now now some people
[56:55] say well brother Wayne don't believe in
[56:56] teaching that's a lie I do believe in
[56:58] teaching I just don't believe in a bunch
[57:00] of dry
[57:02] teaching I don't believe in a bunch of
[57:04] intellectualism being put in the place
[57:06] of anointed
[57:08] teaching now y'all got to be you got to
[57:10] be honest sometimes a man ain't got a
[57:12] call in his life he has no anointing in
[57:13] his life six-foot icicle and he gets up
[57:16] and says he's a teacher so everybody
[57:18] just has to endure for hours because
[57:21] usually they're not short- winded I
[57:23] might as well just be honest they're not
[57:25] usually short- winded they just go on
[57:27] and on and on and on and on and on and
[57:28] on and the longer they talk the colder
[57:30] it gets amen you know what I'm talking
[57:33] about so don't throw away teaching
[57:35] because you've seen somebody wasn't
[57:36] called to teach teach there is a real
[57:38] teacher there is a real gift of teaching
[57:41] there is a real anointing that comes in
[57:43] and lays the word together and when you
[57:45] see that word coming together brother it
[57:48] ought to create something on the inside
[57:50] of the church that'll make it stand in
[57:52] the face of hell and say it belongs to
[57:54] me anyhow the devil says you can't but
[57:57] it's mine anyhow because we believe in
[57:59] it amen it's a right kind of teaching
[58:02] brings a right kind of faith I tell you
[58:04] what a prophet said he said many times
[58:06] what we're getting is Hope instead of
[58:10] Faith teaching would give the faith he
[58:13] said sometimes we're getting hope
[58:15] instead of Faith he said now what what's
[58:17] what's the real difference I'll tell you
[58:19] the real difference hope is believing
[58:21] that he
[58:22] can Faith is believing that he
[58:26] did hope is I'm praying God's going to
[58:29] heal me Faith is God healed me Faith is
[58:33] that which puts it in tomorrow and if
[58:35] you're not careful becomes the enemy of
[58:37] your healing because the devil gets in
[58:40] your hope and puts it off to another day
[58:43] but faith can stand with the word of God
[58:45] and say by Stripes I am healed I am
[58:48] healed tonight I am saved tonight do you
[58:51] see that don't hope you got the Holy
[58:53] Ghost let faith come on the inside of
[58:55] you and say I got the Holy Ghost by the
[58:58] blood of Jesus
[59:00] Christ make it come from a hope to a
[59:03] faith now brother BR breaks into it he
[59:06] says I'll just preach it instead of read
[59:08] it to you he said but this whole world
[59:10] is full of electricity but you can go
[59:12] stand out in the middle of a field
[59:13] somewhere that's dark and wish for light
[59:17] he said but electric is real but you got
[59:20] to put it there through a conduit so
[59:23] there's a way to put electricity in that
[59:26] dark place but you got to follow the
[59:28] laws of it you you stand there and
[59:31] you're up there on Lake Erie and and and
[59:33] then you go somewhere and it's so dry
[59:35] that they can't grow any plants and you
[59:36] say how is it all this water could be on
[59:38] the Earth but this place don't have any
[59:41] that but but the brother B said but see
[59:43] watch you can use the laws of gravity
[59:46] you can use a certain law and bring the
[59:49] water to another place if you follow the
[59:51] right laws and so is there a law of
[59:55] faith that law of Faith Works in the
[59:58] church but if we would be taught right
[1:00:01] that law would work better every
[1:00:05] day now you say taught right brother
[1:00:07] Wayne what does that mean if we're
[1:00:09] taught right the law of faith will
[1:00:12] access a greater law because what
[1:00:14] happens is if there's some unsur in
[1:00:17] us if the devil's got a little spot
[1:00:20] there he's working on you see you can
[1:00:22] get along and go to church without that
[1:00:24] okay you can come to meet and even say
[1:00:27] amen and that'll be okay but when you
[1:00:29] get to that
[1:00:32] Showdown when you get to that real hard
[1:00:35] spot if the enemy can move you off of
[1:00:38] that by maybe it don't belong to me
[1:00:41] maybe I shouldn't be here maybe it
[1:00:43] really isn't something I should do then
[1:00:45] all of a sudden now you are
[1:00:47] dispositioned because your faith is
[1:00:50] wrong so if you stand there tonight and
[1:00:52] you're saying well amen I I I'm this
[1:00:54] because I because I felt this way and I
[1:00:56] thought that way and I this this if any
[1:00:58] of those elements are in your
[1:01:00] positioning you'll lose
[1:01:02] it let me just let me just go real quick
[1:01:05] here if your if your positioning has to
[1:01:08] do with your feelings do you know
[1:01:10] brother B said Satan will beat you on
[1:01:12] the stump with
[1:01:14] that cuz you felt good then you felt
[1:01:19] bad brother M says it like this he says
[1:01:22] if you're looking in a mirror at your
[1:01:24] self you will lose your
[1:01:29] position he said but if you would turn
[1:01:32] and look at
[1:01:34] Christ isn't that something tonight if
[1:01:37] you look to Christ you'd gain the
[1:01:40] strength you need for that perfect Faith
[1:01:42] amen it'll fill your charge your life
[1:01:45] with electricity it'll give you the law
[1:01:48] amen what we have is an Ephesus we have
[1:01:50] an Ephesus of Faith moving into Faith
[1:01:54] amen amen why don't you stand with me
[1:01:56] tonight there must come an Ephesians to
[1:01:58] this far musicians would come I'm going
[1:01:59] to get long I'm sorry amen there there's
[1:02:02] got to be an Ephesians to this
[1:02:05] right there's got to be an Ephesians to
[1:02:08] this brother bam tells us this very
[1:02:11] closely he says there's got to be an
[1:02:13] Ephesians to this
[1:02:15] journey the same as there was to that
[1:02:19] Journey now we're not talking about the
[1:02:22] Ephesus Church age we're talking about

[1:02:27] Ephesus those

[1:02:33] to this we've got our
[1:02:38] Joshua we got our
[1:02:41] seed we got our
[1:02:44] Believers now if we take the
[1:02:48] word and we stand there with that word
[1:02:52] the book of Ephesians will place us
[1:02:55] to a position that we can
[1:02:57] fight we can we can stand
[1:03:00] positionally and hold ourselves in that
[1:03:03] word amen I I pray it was a little help
[1:03:07] tonight I'm going to I'm going to be
