Oh, when darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy day, my anchor hold within the veil. Oh, my anchor holds. My anchor holds within the veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a beautiful reality this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just beyond the veil. That's the anchor and the hope of every believer. Amen. Is not in this life, but it's in a life just beyond. Scripture tells us that we're our anchor, our hope. Amen. Lies beyond the veil of this flesh. And thank God we have it this morning. That there's something there that is bigger and greater. Amen. And I think the more that we are conscious of it and the more that we talk about it, the more that we focus upon it, the more our lives are full of purpose, our hearts are set upon the goals of God. And we're looking at the recompenses of reward and the grace that God has before us. And and the less uh real it seems, the less heaven, the less the angels, the less the other dimensions, the less they seem real. It seems that's when hearts wander and minds are maybe uh become more complicated in life. But if we just focus our hearts and our minds upon it and I believe that's I believe that's why we're gathering even here this morning. Just listening to the prophet yesterday and he's talking about things that are to be and and he's talking about a young mother and how she begins to have a baby. He said that that father wanting that baby to be born perfect said you know there's a there's sometimes a body is crawling or craving it's crying out for something and he said that's you know what causes a father to get special things or do certain things and and he immediately says and that's that's what God is doing. He said, 'Why are we having these revivals and why are we having church and why are we gathering together and why are we so insistent on preaching the word of God is because there's something developing within the church and it's for another land. It's for another realm. Amen. It's so good to be in the house of God this morning and amen to be here on a Sunday morning. I would like to say that it's a great privilege to see each of you that could be here today and to see the the house of God to be a place that I I I find brother Brandham says this and for years I wondered what he meant when he said that the gospel was still the greatest drawing power and I'd go by football stadiums on the way to church and when I was evangelizing and you'd be going through a city and man the parks are full and the football fields are full and the softball fields are full and you get to church and maybe 200, 300 people, 400. And brother Ram said, "It's still the greatest drawing power." And then I listened to the next part of that. He said, "To them that are drawn to it." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Oh yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; To the one that's drawn to it, there's nothing more greater. There's not a greater pull. There's not a greater draw. There's nothing else they'd rather do than serve the Lord God." Amen. And it's so good to be a part of that and to see that that burden in each of your hearts. And Amen. We want to just take a moment this morning before we open the word in prayer. Let's let's just bow our hearts for prayer. And let's speak to him just a moment. And father, we are we're so certain this morning of your grace. And Lord, I I thank you that Lord that there is a witness this morning that when we even bow our heart to pray that there's someone to hear us. Lord, you taught your disciples to pray. And you begin with our father which art in heaven. Lord teaching your children that there is things that is unseen. There is an ear to hear the prayer. And I ask you this morning father as we speak to you that are not visible in a human realm at this moment but Lord that you hear us. The Bible said that you were touched by faith. And I ask you this morning as our hearts are grown together, Lord, to come and worship you today, Lord. I ask you that you would step into the realm so real, Lord. That we could that we could feel the inspiration that Lord, as though we are not in heaven this morning, but Lord, may the atmosphere of heaven become so real that we'll be acquainted with it before we ever go. We ask you this morning that you would take the voice, Lord, of a simple man and use it for your glory. We ask that you would bless your children this morning as we would speak from your word. Lord, I know that it is written, you said in this Bible that he that heareth or readeth these words that they would be blessed. And I ask you this morning, Lord, that you would give us the grace as we would speak these things that hearts would be, Lord, set on you, our affections, our lives, Lord, as we turn to you this morning. Now, Lord, we're inviting you to come take your word, Lord, and have the preeminence in this meeting. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you. If you have your Bibles today, we just like to go into the word of the Lord. Amen. I'm I'm going to be speaking here to you from John the 14th chapter. I'm going to read the first three verses. Um this is still under that same topic of the opening of the word. I'm I've been studying through the seal book and and uh of course many things but uh in doing so I I've been speaking to you about the inspirations that are coming uh to me personally about uh revelations contained under the seals. And uh it it's a it's an amazing to me it's an amazing study and I just pray that uh it would be something uh that would be a blessing to you in John 14. And I want to read the first three verses. Now let not your heart be troubled. For ye believe in God, believe also in me. For in my father's house are many mansions. And if it were not so, I would have told you. and I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am, there ye may be also. Amen. Uh we ask the Lord to bless his word this morning. She could be seated. If I would take a a subject this morning for a topic, um just a subtopic, I'm trying to place something on it so we could find it later. if you're trying to get into it. Uh I want to speak to you this morning on heaven is a real place. Heaven is a real place. Uh and I love how Jesus said this that he went to prepare a place. Amen. Heaven is a real place and things that are to be. Brother Brandham says it this. He said uh if we're Christians and I just wonder this morning how many Christians are in the building just by the uplifting of your hand. And I'd say that almost every person I see has their hands lifted up. up and brother Bram said that's the way it is a lot of times he said in our meetings or even in our churches these days he said there's so many that are just Christians and he says and I think uh that we ought to be notified ahead as Christians that we don't have to guess and that we ought to be notified of what our destination will be and I want to speak tonight he said on the subject of things that are to be now that's a powerful subject and things that are to be and speaking last night on the rapture. He said, "Then I want to speak on this subject that I might tie last night's message." So, Brother Bam uh is is telling us as Christians that there's something that's going to be. And I I like to think about that that he's he's dealing with our future, not just our present, but also our future. And he's telling us about things that are to be, but he's telling us, amen, that there uh is a future for the church. Now, it's coming at a wonderful time because uh Brother Brandham is actually speaking this uh standing on the on the um you could say the cusp of the changing of time and eternity when uh when as a prophet reading the handwriting on the wall, opening of these seals and seeing the debacery and the evil and all the great uh the the the the apostasy that has struck the age. And he's seeing the darkness in schools and motherhood. And he's seeing it in families and churches. And he everywhere he looks, he can see the the the as it were a shadow or hand of darkness as it settles over the nations. And in the face of every bit of that, he's saying to the Christians, there's something coming for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what I hope it is, because in Hebrews 13, Paul will tell us this. He'll say that here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come. So I I I love how brother Brandham says it. He says this this is the grandest of all of the ages. And he's permitted us to live in because it's the closing out of time and it's the blending in of eternity. And history only tells us what we have read and what has been. But what's in the future lays in the hands of God. Amen. I love brother Brandham how he says things so wonderfully and he says it to us like this. He says I want you to know every sensible person that has any reasoning knows something's this to happen. There's not a person in this building that's got right mind but knows that this world cannot stand under these conditions. We can't stand friends and there's not one thing as your pastor, as your brother, there is not one thing that I could guide you towards this morning but to Jesus Christ. My when I think about it this morning, I think of how that a prophet said, "In all of the things, there's only one thing that I know that I could point you to that is a certain future for you as a person, as a believer, and that is to Jesus Christ." Brother Brandham says, "In things that are to be," he says, "I believe this. Therefore, the bride in the rapture is going to come. And I believe that this is all pre-planned by God, &gt;&gt; and it's backed up." And the beginning, he knowed every man, every place. He He knew all about it. It's pre-planned. God knew it would be here. He made a way so that when we get here, he's going to prepare a place for us. And when we get there, it'll all be prepared. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as this night is prepared, as this hour is prepared. Yes, his fornowledge tells us this thing. And we know he's omnipresent, right? He's omniscant and he is omnipresent. Therefore, his fornowledge. He can't be like the wind over the earth because he's a being. He isn't just a myth. He's a being. He dwells. He dwells in a house. He dwells in a place called heaven. &gt;&gt; He dwells in a house. He dwells in a place called heaven. Listen, heaven is not a pipe dream. &gt;&gt; Heaven is not the uh theory of some uh uh poor people grasping to reach up to a pie in the sky to give the uh uh you uh the underlings of the world something to hope for. Y'all know that's the teaching of the great intellectual mind, the agnostic and the antichrist and amen. And and and the atheist is that you are all being fed a line to keep a social pattern and this Christianity of something that's coming and something that's just being given to you. It's all in somebody's mind. But listen, I I want you to know it's more amen than somebody's mind or somebody's idea or some kind of a a pipe dream that's been given to the church. Amen. What it is is it's a reality and heaven is real and God is real and these things that we are preaching are real. Amen. And I believe we're going to go there because Jesus said in his own words, "I go to prepare a place for you." Amen. And just as this human body was prepared for your coming to this earth, so has God prepared a place for you when you leave this earth. There is a place prepared. As sure as there is a God in heaven, there is a place for you as a church of the living God. Amen. Brother Ben, preaching sermons like things that are to be more than a couple hours. Preaching future home of the earthly bridegroom and the heavenly bridegroom more than three hours. Amen. He preaches the rapture more than two hours. The sudden secret going away of the church nearly a nearly a two-hour sermon now. Amen. That's about five, seven, nine different hours. Amen. just in this little concept of thought and and and I'll say this much more he says in many other places. So please this morning as I speak to you amen when you leave here today I want you to know before I preach this amen I will not conclusively deal with this subject. There is no way within just this few moments of time that I could amen bring in every piece and every moment and every situation and compass it into one sermon. So give me a little grace in this. If I miss your favorite quote, then just know I know it's there, but I can't take the extra hour to preach it this morning. Amen. And if I say a little something that don't fit within your realms, just remember how brother Bam said that you should eat apple pie. &gt;&gt; How many pie eaters we got here? Amen. If you come to something that you just can't maybe get digested like apple, brother Bam said just spit it out and keep eating. Amen. So I I believe that there's a lot of things, amen, that to be discussed upon this subject because it's talking about our future as a church, as a people. Amen. Not just what we are here, but what we're going to be in the fourthcoming. Now, if you're watching these seals as we're studying them, you're getting into the fourth horse rider in the fourth seal. Amen. And you're seeing a pale horse come riding. And and the prophet said simply, it's just a mixture of the three other horses. Amen. And it's coming together. And he said, "Look how these three things are coming together. And what is it here?" It's named death and hell is going to follow after it. Amen. So death is coming and hell is going to follow after that. So we see, amen, that this power was going to be given for destruction and for troubles. And so we can look this morning and we can see denominationalism and we can see the harlot and we can see the beast and and we can see that it's it's been named in this age. Now, the reason we have a name for death and we know what it is is because we've had a prophet among us. Now, if you're uh studying this in the fourth seal, there's actually a fourth living creature that comes forward and tells John to come and see. And that is the eagle. And it's not just an eagle. It's actually a flying eagle. And this eagle is the last of the creatures that does. So if you watch the fifth, sixth, and seventh seal, there's actually no creature related with those other seals because brother Ram said here in the fourth seal is when death is going to be named. In other words, the eagle or the messenger that has came and preached unto us. Not only has he told us what is, but he's going to also talk to us about what is coming. And it will be just as vindicated as what he's talking about in current times as what it's going to be. So, Brother Brandham is the one that looked upon denomination and said, "It's death." He looked upon the Catholic and said, "It's death." He looked upon the the rightest living of the age. Y'all remember it? He met those Americans in the Canadian uh hotel and the girls running down the hall drunk and half-dressed and their babies at home with their husbands and they're crying, "Woo! This is life." And he said he caught one of them. Can you imagine? He caught one of them by the hand. He said, "Lady, this is not life. This is death." Amen. And what this America calls life, its night life and social and all of its events and all, that's not life. That's death. Amen. And hell is going to follow after it. Amen. But life comes from the word of God. Amen. You see, when Jesus comes out of the heavens of heavens, he's riding one solid colored horse, and it is the word of God. knowing as a church that we will not mix together things to bring life, but it is the word and the word only that brings life in the church. And I I certainly believe tonight or this morning, that's why, amen, we have life is because we have the word of God. If that is death and hell follows after it, amen, then I believe there is a word this morning and there's something following the belief in this word. It's a heaven. It's a glorified body. It's a redeemed earth. There is an eternal life ahead of the believer that believes this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, I believe that we've had a beast, an eagle, a divine revealer of the word. Amen. That all of heaven follows after this message. It's coming from an immortal land. It's vindicating and made declared to us the word of rapture. It's declared to us the son of man is here. It's declared to us the pillar of fire is on the earth. Now, it's important to me that the pillar of fire is here because this is the return of the pillar of fire. The same one, folks, that led the children of Israel out of Egypt and took them into the promised land is the same pillar of fire that has came to this church to take us not just out of denomination, not just to equipp us for a rapture, but that same pillar of fire will lead us all the way to the millennium. Amen. And we cannot miss it because the one that is leading is the only one that knows how to get there. He is the way. The Bible says in John John 16:12, he Jesus said, "I have many things to say, but you cannot bear them now." How many knows that's a prophecy of the seals? &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I got things to say, but I can't bear them." Now, brother said, "That's a prophecy of the seals." So, people that thinks the seals were preached before Brother preached them, Jesus said they wasn't. He said, "I'd like to say them, but I can't say them. I can't say them now." But when the seventh angel sounds, That's Bible truth, friends. Amen. You see, how be it when the Spirit of truth has come, Amen. He will guide you into all truth, and he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you things to come. Isn't that powerful? The spirit of truth is here to lead you, to guide you. Amen. And it's here to tell you things that are to be. Can we just say it that way? Amen. And we find then Jesus said it. Let not your heart be troubled. You believed in God. Believe also in me. Now if my father's house are many mansions were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place. Now look how Jesus said this. Don't let your heart be troubled with all that you're seeing with everything that's happening now. Jesus is actually fisten to be destroyed at the cross. He's going to be crucified. The worst. Amen. He's going to be taken into government custody. They're going to condemn him to death. They're going to give him corporal punishment. Amen. And they're all going to watch this. They're going to watch the humiliation or the degradation of who they believe is the Messiah. Amen. They believe he's there to fulfill all those scriptures. And they're going to watch him crumble under the Roman emperor's hands. And Jesus said, "Don't let your heart be troubled. My life is ending for a purpose. I go away to prepare a place." Now, listen. If you can believe God, believe me when I say this. Amen. Don't let your heart be troubled. Do you see? Then it's your faith and what Jesus died for that's going to take the trouble out of your heart. If your heart is troubled today, let me say this. Jesus said, "I give unto you peace, but not the way the world gives you peace." He never gave you any any any anti-depressants. He never gave us any counseling. But what he gave us was a sure promise of the word of God and of tomorrow. And I say this, and I I'm not knocking medication. We need it. God bless every every doctrine ever. Amen. You you that's not what we're talking about. Amen. But Jesus was pushing out something that would give peace to the world and that is faith in why I have come here and what I'm doing when you cannot see me any longer. You have to know that you believed in God then don't be troubled because faith is what brings peace and expectation. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said that where I am. Amen. Now this is uh this is a powerful thing to me that where I am Jesus did not dissipate once he was resurrected. &gt;&gt; He was resurrected bodily. Amen. The Bible tells us that he was seen of many and preached unto them for 40 days. My Bible tells me after his resurrection, he took fish from the fire and ate it to prove he wasn't a ghost. He was a glorified man. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. That where I am. So that body is somewhere this morning. &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ. I do not agree with those people that believe that Jesus, Amen, was just a temporary moment. Amen. And he's just our brother now or he's just something that was just for a moment in time and he disappears. But my Bible says in Isaiah 9:6 that the government would be upon his shoulder and would sit upon the throne, amen, of David throughout eternity. Amen. The Bible records and when he comes from the heavens of heavens, he is upon his vesture. It's named the word of God and he is the king of kings, the lord of lords, the glor. Listen, there is no heaven without Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Amen. Somebody said, "Well, I tell you, one of these days Jesus will be our brother and we won't be able to worship him no more." And some don't even believe there'll be a Jesus there at all. Amen. But let me ask you, what is a heaven without Jesus? Amen. He is the object of our worship. He is the adoring of our love and our faith and our hope. He is our savior, our redeemer. He is our Lord. He is our God. He is what I worship and what I live for. I do not live just to be in in a nice place. I live so I can sit at the feet of my redeemer. Amen. And worship him the rest of my days. I'll say this, the greatest moment, the highest moment in human existence is when you so get in the presence of God that you lose the cares of this life. And and to think about the height of that moment, you you young people, when you get in that influence of that anointing, that spirit, and you're dancing down the aisle and you're worshiping God in a dance or rejoicing or Amen. when the spirit falls over you and you break out into, y'all know what that is. when sister hope when you break out in tongues and the power of God. Amen. How high you feel in that very moment. Amen. Listen, there is nothing in this earth that can compare with the height and the glory that a man feels in the presence of Jesus Christ. But this will not be a moment. This will not be one second. This will be the rest of eternity standing in the presence of the almighty God. Oh, that's what heaven is. It's in the presence of God. It's in the presence of the one who gave life unto us. Oh, I want to go to heaven, but I want to see Jesus. I don't want a crown. I don't want a robe. I don't want none of that. I want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what I want to see. &gt;&gt; My I tell you, when you when you've met him, you know he's still real, &gt;&gt; right? Heaven is the place. Jesus said that where I am, &gt;&gt; that where I am, &gt;&gt; that he is somewhere and he's in heaven. And I know there's some spiritual applications to John 14. Don't don't uh don't think I don't know, but I want to look at the reality part of this. &gt;&gt; Heaven. Brother Brandham says it in 65. Christ revealed in his word. You're going to find out one of these days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you go to heaven, you don't fly off somewhere else. &gt;&gt; You're still right here &gt;&gt; in another dimension. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Then the heaven is not a million miles away. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Then heaven's not somewhere way off somewhere. It is a real place, but it's right here &gt;&gt; in another dimension. Brother Bram says it like this. You're standing right here at the platform speaking to the father. I said, "Father, I know you're standing right here." Amen. At this platform and the glorious nails card one is so close in another world or another dimension, he's standing right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd say this when we're dealing with closeness, somebody said, "Brother Wayne, how far is it?" I'll tell you this. When the prophet went beyond the curtain of time, Amen. Uh, and we played the the the portion of you so I wouldn't have to repreach the whole thing, but we played that portion to deal with closeness of heaven. Brother Brandham measured it as a a Kuckian would. He said it was only about 20 ft from where I was. &gt;&gt; He said, "There I was in heaven looking back. It was only about 20 feet from my body." So, amen. I I I don't I don't I don't want to say, "Amen. It was that far." I want to say it like this. It was that near. &gt;&gt; It wasn't 20 foot far. It was 20 foot near because we thought it was a thousand or a million or 200 light years. Amen. When the astronauts went to the moon, amen, they said, "We didn't find him up there." And they come home disappointed that Jesus wasn't on the moon. Amen. The Bible never said he was on the moon. He said he was in heaven. And heaven is just a dimension that's just faster than the one we're in right now. Amen. I'll tell you, he's within the sound of your voice. Amen. He can feel you. He can hear your prayer. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's 20 ft close. &gt;&gt; All the saints of the ages from the time of Apostle Paul all the way to the day, they're just 20 ft from where you are now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we know dimensions, right? We've heard them. Let's just take seven of them. This is what the prophet teaches. Very very clear teaching that there are seven dimensions. The first three of them, time, light, matter. The next one he says is this, you know, science, radio, television. Now, somebody said, "Well, I don't believe in dimensions." Well, turn the radio on and &gt;&gt; turn the television on &gt;&gt; now. Turn the phone on &gt;&gt; and it tells you there is a whole another world that you're not seeing. &gt;&gt; They're passing through here right now. You say, "There ain't nothing else in this room." Turn on a television, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it'll catch. Remember back in the days of the analog when they rabbit ears? I I when I was a little boy, we had rabbit ears and K8 TV. That's all we had. That or white noise? It's fuzz or that, you know, had them little rabbit ears and and and and and you know, hey, uh uh uh Bugs Bunny was going right through the room. &gt;&gt; Road Runner was running right over my couch, but we didn't know it till we turned on the television. And then we received a signal that proved &gt;&gt; brother man said television was here when Jesus was here. &gt;&gt; But you couldn't have told them in that day because there was nothing to declare it in your dimension. &gt;&gt; But when we got radio and television and radar amen and we started getting these signals, somebody began to realize, amen, oh there are things that we can't see in this room. Brother Ram said, then we go right on into the region of the lost in the fifth dimension. He said those are where people go. Amen. That that that have never accepted Christ. You know, as a young child, you're under the blood of Christ. Now, when you come to age of accountability, you have to accept that blood for your own. Amen. And anyone who don't accept that blood for their own, when they pass from this life, they go beyond the blood into the regions of the lost. Amen. But beyond that is the sixth dimension. Amen. with a prophet of God called the paradise or the region of the saved where someone who accepted the blood goes into that region when they pass from here. The seventh is the presence of God. Brother Bram said that's when he was there. He asked them, I want to see Jesus if I'm in heaven. And first thing he wanted to see, I want to see Jesus. And they said, he's just a little higher than this. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, what was it? He was in that seventh dimension. But one day he said, he's going to come and when he does, he's going to judge you first. &gt;&gt; That's powerful, isn't it? Amen. He's going to judge him first. Brother Ram said the people over there said they went in on his doctrine. He says that's the people said we're resting on the thought that you have taught us what Paul taught his believers. Amen. And we find out then that Jesus himself went up into heaven in a corporal body. Amen. And he sits there as a nailed scarred body upon the throne of God. Amen. I'll just say it like brother Bam did. He says he lived in that scarred and bruised for our sins and for our sickness. And he sits on the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see his corporal body? Brother Bram said the thing that is different today about Jesus on the earth, he says today he's here in the form of the Holy Ghost. But his corporal body sits at the right hand of God in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Queen of Sheba, he said the only thing is the corporal body. His body is at the right hand of God, the father in heaven, sitting on the throne of God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Listen, you have no power if that's not true. Because the believer today as a human being, we were fallen from God. Amen. And we had to have something to lift us back from what Adam lost. And Jesus sat down on the throne of God that a human being &gt;&gt; would be back on the throne of God because he is our kinsman sitting on the throne of God. That's why Paul would say this. If you that been risen with Christ, seek the things which are above. Amen. Who Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections there. Amen. Because he's there, then set your affections there. In Mark 16, I'll just give you the scriptures. Mark 16 says, Amen, that the Bible says he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God. Acts chapter 3 said that he would send Jesus Christ be preach be preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the time of the restitution of all things. Now, that's exactly scripture with what brother Brandham said. He said he's right above us now, but he's got to wait until this little season is over and then he'll come. Amen. And he'll take us with him. Remember, he talks about how that they were there in theophony. Now, the scripture tells us, Amen. 1 Peter chap 3 22, he has gone into heaven and sits on the right hand. Now, when we when you start discussing this, it opens up a deeper now it opens up a deeper thing because now we're talking about three different bodies. We're talking about bodies celestial, we're talking about bodies terrestrial, and we're talking about glorified bodies. &gt;&gt; Three bodies, terrestrial, celestial, glorified. That's what the prophet says. He says, see what it is. He says when we drop this robe, we take on a theophony body. He says, "See, that's a body not made with hands, not born of a woman, we're going to go to that. But then at the coming of the Lord, his physical body, then that body that if you're if you die, let's just put it real plain. If you would die before the time, amen, that Christ comes from the heavens of heaven in his corporal body, then this body that dies, you as a person, because we've never seen the real you, that's not the real you. The real you is the one inside that." And brother Ram said, "It ain't no different than a man wearing a coat and he takes one coat off and hangs it in the closet because it's old." And then he puts on a new coat, which is your theophony body, and you step in that theophony. But the theophony is only a temporary until the great resurrection of the saints. &gt;&gt; How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Amen. at the resurrection, brother Bam said, then this theophony will come back and pick up that human body and glorify it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a real point important part now because Jesus came to redeem you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He came to redeem you and that theophony will pick up this human body and glorify it where you'll have a body likened unto his own glorious body. &gt;&gt; Now, now church, that's real powerful. And there's a real reason to make sure we get this right because brother Bam said to us that are dwelling in the flesh. He says if we are still alive at that time. &gt;&gt; He said that theophony is going to come and pick you up. Hallelujah. Amen. What a what a season to live. Amen. What a season. Because that theophony is already forming on the inside of a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What's the mystery of the change? Prophet of God said it develops around the word. Do you see then? Amen. What what if you're if you've already made the connection. Brother Bam said, if it's during the rapture that then this body returns back and picks up that glorified body in 1 Corinthians 15:40, if you like to study these things, 1 Corinthians 15:40, it records celestial and terrestrial. So, we're talking about theophony and we're talking about a human body, two different bodies. Amen. Paul was caught in up in the heavens and saw these things in 2 Corinthians 12 2-4. Now, did brother Bam teach the same thing Paul taught? Watch. Amen. Amen. And I knew a man. I can't tell whether he was in the body or out of the body, but he was caught up into the third heavens. And the Bible says that which was not lawful for man to utter. Amen. Paul went there and saw it because it's a reality. He saw it with his own eyes. He was He was transferred into that place and come back to tell us it's real, but I can't tell you a lot about it. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's powerful to me. It's real, but I can't tell you a lot about it because it's yet unlawful. In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul tells you more about it. He said, "We know this earthly tabernacle be dissolved. We have a building, a house not made with hand, eternal in the heavens." Then he tells us, Paul again tells us this human body to be dissolved. You have one already waiting. Now, now this was not just Paul's revelation that Paul left uh amen without account. Because Peter himself, Amen, makes the same statement in 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 13. He said, "I think it meet as long as I'm in this tabernacle to put you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this tabernacle." He was telling, "I've got this tabernacle. I got to put it off." Amen. But I I know this, amen, that I'm enduring after my decisions to have these things always in remembrance. Now, watch what he says in the 16th verse. Because we have not followed cunningly devised fables. We have been made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, which we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, now Peter in 1 Peter chapter 1, y'all know he's referring to Matthew 17. How many aware of that? &gt;&gt; Peter in 1 Peter 1 is actually talking about his experience on Mount Transfiguration in Matthew 17. And can you imagine being Peter standing there and seeing the Lord Jesus transferred before you and all of the sudden you see Moses and Elijah whom you know Moses has been dead for hundreds of years. And Elijah was carried off on a chariot. But there they were in the promised land. Amen. 800 years later. And they were standing there. And Peter knew who they was. Amen. He said, "I'm an eyewitness that if a man put off this tabernacle, there's another one that cannot decay." And hundreds of years later, he look just like they did back. [Music] &gt;&gt; This is not a cunning device fable. It's the word of God. It is a more sure word of prophecy. The Bible tells us in Matthew 18, Jesus himself said it. He said, "Their angels do always behold the face of my father in heaven." Amen. Brother said, "If you want to understand that," he said, "You got to go to Acts the 12th chapter and see when Apostle Peter was supposed to be dead and he come knocking on the door of John Mark." Amen. And they come to the door and answered and said, "Who is it?" He said, "It's Peter." And they said, "It can't be Peter. He's dead. It must be his angel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, now look, folks, brother Bam is not ever saying we're angels. And Jesus is not saying we're angels, but Paul says the body is celestial. &gt;&gt; It is angelic in it's a celestial body, not an angel. You are always sons. &gt;&gt; You are always sons. Amen. And brother Bam says, "Behold in their face, uh the angels always behold the face of the fathers." He said, "In other words, their angels or their messengers, their bodies, their angelic bodies they go to if they die. They're always before my father's face. If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting." My goodness. Amen. He did not mean that he would go prepare a mansion. He meant he would go prepare a body. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Some of these bodies are redheaded and some are blackheaded." And Amen. Thank God. Amen. Some of you that ain't got hair going to get some hair. I don't think any perfect heads without hair. So, you know what they say, right? They say that uh there's only a few perfect heads and the rest of them God covers with hair. There's red, yellow. God is God of variety. Don't ever get it in your mind. Everybody has to be the same. Come on, church. God is a God of variety. Just go down to the go down to the nursery and look around and there's red flowers and blue flowers and yellow flowers and amen. And the same God creates all of them. There's a blue bird and a yellow bird and there's a black bird and a brown bird and and all kinds of birds and all kinds of humans and all kinds of characters and all but they're all according to God because God is a God of variety. Listen, we we find out brother Bam said then he's not talking about a mansion. And he's talking about a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 1 John chapter 3, I hope this is okay. In 1 John chapter 3, he said, "Beloved, we are now sons of God. It don't yet appear what we shall be, but we know that we shall be like him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is. Questions and answers. Brother Bam said, "It's not even been revealed yet &gt;&gt; what it would be." He said, "But I know because I saw it." &gt;&gt; I know because I saw it. What is it? Amen. I wondered what it would be. It is a celestial body. Amen. Let me say this. Amen. A celestial body. When you pass beyond this life, now I'm not preaching a funeral this morning. I'm preaching your future. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when you pass beyond this life, there is, amen, an immortal dwelling place beyond this region, and there is no babies going to be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that every person will be somewhere that age range of 18, 20, 21, 22? Brother said, "Why is it that you go up to a perfection in human life and then you fall off the other side?" He said, "Showing you the age of that theophony." Amen. &gt;&gt; What he said, he said, "You're eating, you're eating, you're getting stronger, you're getting stronger, and someday you start eating and you still eating the same foods going off on the other side because that is the age of that perfect body." Now, brother Brandon, it's very clear to us when he went beyond the curtain the first time and he seen Sharon Rose. Remember, he's walking there, the wheel on the wagon is broken, &gt;&gt; and a girl, beautiful girl, says to him, "Good morning, daddy." He says, "Now you're the same age as I am. Why would you call me daddy?" And she said, 'Well, I was your little Sharon Rose on the earth, &gt;&gt; but daddy, there's no babies up here. &gt;&gt; Don't you remember your teaching on immortality? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's pretty powerful to me cuz that baby at 6 months old when she passed, had never heard William Brandon preach on immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. But she knew up in heaven his teaching on immortality was true &gt;&gt; because it didn't come from the earth. It came from the heavens. &gt;&gt; This message has been confirmed in heaven. &gt;&gt; This is heaven's message. It's not Amen. It's not man's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I think of the glory of it. Somebody said, "Well, there's no babies there." Yep. And there's no old age there either. &gt;&gt; There will be no old age in that place. Somebody said, "Well, how can you prove it?" Brother said he looked at them women said that was the most beautiful women and and and a voice said to him he said them women you think are so beautiful he said do you notice that one he said no I don't know who she is he said you led her to the Lord when she was 90 years old &gt;&gt; no wonder she's saying precious brother here in this dimension she's 90 years old at the end of her life if you gave her 10,000 years if you gave her 10,000 there's going to come a last day to that 10,000 years. There's going to come a last moment and a person that's lived 10,000 years would give every dime they had to live another day. Amen. Because when it comes to the end, but there there will be no dying because there will be no old age. There will be no 90 year old, no 80 year old. There will be perfect bodies. Oh, church of the living God, it's a reality that there is a body. Amen. Now, somebody said, "Well, Brother Wayne, I think when we get to heaven now, we're all just going to sit on these on these uh clouds and we're going to play our harps and we're going to play music and we're going to enjoy ourselves." And &gt;&gt; now watch, Brother Brand said, "That's a conception we used to have." Yeah, &gt;&gt; we used to have now that they had before the fullness of the word come into existence or the opening of the seven seals that's been promised to us in this age. Do you see? I believe heaven is a real place. Under the opening of the seals, he begins to declare heaven is a real place. This is not so sleeping. &gt;&gt; Brother B says it. You're just as alive as you are right now, but greater in a more perfect life. &gt;&gt; I I love how Brother Bam says it. He says, "Your body's sleeping, but your soul ain't. &gt;&gt; It's not soul sleeping." Amen. It It's a It's a time, Brother Bam says it like here. We're not going to set up there for eternity on a cloud and just strum on our harps. Amen. But we're going to a real place. We're going to a real place. I tell you, heaven is a perfect place. &gt;&gt; My goodness, when when you start to think about heaven, how many ever just sits around once in a while just thinks about heaven? &gt;&gt; You know, you just think about it, you know, &gt;&gt; you think, how's it going to be? And what's everything going to be like? And now the Bible said, "Half hadn't yet been told." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of the things prepared for you. &gt;&gt; And you just, you know, you start thinking about heaven. And and one of the words that that that we have in English language that helps to describe heaven is perfect. And brother Ram uses this word when it comes to heaven. He's excused a lot. It's perfect. Amen. Meaning that there's no spots of imperfection. There's those things that rub you wrong or do Amen. Those little uh those little things that they just won't be there anymore. It's perfect. Brother Bam said, "A perfect heaven, a perfect God, a perfect savior, a perfect blood, a perfect atonement, a perfect being of you." &gt;&gt; All of those things that you hate about yourself, they won't be there. &gt;&gt; All those little things that just drive you crazy about yourself, they just won't be there. &gt;&gt; There'll be a perfect you. &gt;&gt; My goodness. I'll invite y'all over to see the perfect me. Amen. It's a perfect It's a perfect you. It's a perfect me. It's a perfect place. Brother Bam says it's a taking you from this pest house and putting you in my father's house. &gt;&gt; He said when you fell and you were born into this earth, you come into a pest house where all these things are. He said, "Oh, but God's going to take you from a pest house and put you in the father's house." Now, listen. I I I like to read the Bible. I like to read about heaven. Amen, brother Chris. They said heaven is a country. That's pretty big. It's a country. And and and and another person, they explain it as it's the four square city, the celestial city of God. It's a country. It's a city. Amen. One calls it Amen. a a civilization. Amen. They call it a kingdom. Amen. But I like how Jesus said it's my father's house because it's like going home. It's not visiting some foreign nation. It's not visiting some city where we're just going to be tourists. But we are citizens of this kingdom that we're going to. And we have a house there. My father has a house. Hallelujah. I won't be the strange one there. My beliefs won't be the strange ideas. These things that we hold so dear and seem so opposite to the world. They are the regular ideas of heaven. &gt;&gt; All of the women in heaven going to wear dresses and all of them will have long hair. And there won't be none of our sisters peered upon as if they're weird because they don't have 42 paintings and and five different tattoos and 16 earrings. And &gt;&gt; look, I I'm sorry. I Me and Chrissya gets out once in a while and she loves to go shopping. I usually sit in the truck and but but once in a while once in a while I I I'll get up the nerve and I'll go right into the mall with her. And the funniest thing I ever see sometimes these these folks in the mall, you know, these these poor girls and they got and I'm not making fun of anything. I just want you to see something. They got pink hair and purple hair and and I I mean literally enough tattoos and and and and earrings just go all the way through and just I mean you're like, I can't believe that a human being takes that much time to get ready in the morning. &gt;&gt; And I can see them turn and look at my wife as if she's something off of a Oh, if they could see me looking back, I'd be like, &gt;&gt; "She's got morals they don't know nothing about." &gt;&gt; Character &gt;&gt; standing there, a real lady, &gt;&gt; something that they can't even imagine being. &gt;&gt; Amen. But think somehow it's weird. Amen. You you see the modern society of religion looks upon this little church like she's something strange somewhere but they don't Amen. If they could only see me looking back. She's got theological max factors. Brother B said her doors is the gates of hell. Amen. Amen. The sermons are nothing but a bunch of Hollywood hybridization of man's ideas with politics and demon power. &gt;&gt; And they look at a pure word church as if there's something wrong with that church. That ain't nothing wrong with us, but we come from heaven and we're going back to heaven. And there's a reality to this word. We are sons and daughters of God. We are not weird &gt;&gt; in heaven. It's a perfect place calling you. Amen. Just as an expectant mother, amen, is bringing forth life. So are you going into another place? Jesus is going ready. He's going to prepare a place for you. And it's a beautiful place. And it's a beautiful place, brother B. When he calls hope beyond the curtain of time. And when he calls hope back, you remember what she said? She said, "Be what' you call me back for?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Call you back?" He said, "Yeah." She said, "I had just entered the most beautiful place." &gt;&gt; I'm going to paraphrase. "The most beautiful place. Great big birds and beautiful trees and and and it was this." He said, "These white robed people had come to escort me into this place." And I when I heard that, I said, "Oh, thank the Lord. I don't have to cross Jordan alone." &gt;&gt; Amen. To think about it. Amen. Amen. Do you all recognize when it comes your time, if you don't go in the rapture, if you do go in the rapture, they're going to come meet you. &gt;&gt; But if you pass from this life, God won't let you cross that Jordan. Amen. I imagine he'll send some of your buddies over to see you. Do you know there are record upon top of record of people that are leaving this dimension that stand up and start greeting people before they ever go? They start talking about seeing this one and that one and amen and coming back. Amen. What is it? You don't have to cross Jordan. There are people that you know that are still alive in another dimension and you can't see them. But the moment this veil of flesh is dropped, you will see them with your eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Be to God. Amen. You'll talk about something wonderful. Brother Bam said, "Call you back from where?" She said, "Bill, I was in heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She said, "You preached about it, Bill." Oh, but you don't know. &gt;&gt; You preached about it, but you don't know. She said, "Bill, do you know where we made our mistake?" And he said, "Honey, I do. I know where we made our mistake." She said, "Bill, them people wasn't trash." She said, "You, my mama shouldn't have never called them trash, Bill." She said, "I know we never did." Amen. But she said, "Bill, you make me one promise." She said, "You preach this baptism of the Holy Ghost until death takes your time." And you raise my children like that. Now, this is coming from a woman that's went beyond and come back. And she knew there are religions to live by, but there are religions to die by. And not every religion man lives by is a religion you want to die by. But this Holy Ghost religion. It's Holy Ghost religion will hold. It'll hold all the way till you pass beyond the curtain of time. Oh, brother. Amen. When he got over there, you remember what he said to him, Bill. Amen. This is what you call the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This promise. Amen. To preach this. Amen. I tell you this, because this Holy Ghost gospel, Amen. Amen. It means more. Do you know that your human life began in the womb of your mother &gt;&gt; before you ever came into the earth? &gt;&gt; Life begins at conception. &gt;&gt; Do you know that before you get to heaven, you already have eternal life? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know God gives a man eternal life before they go? Do you know the prophet said that our beloved Mary, who the Catholic Church loves so well, he says she couldn't even get into heaven until she staggered under the power of the Holy Ghost and become drunk before God would ever let her in heaven. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something that God commanded that a person receive the Holy Ghost before going into heaven? So, the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not just some emotion. It's not just something we can make fun of or act like there's nothing real about it. But the baptism of his spirit is the life of God coming not just on the spirit of a man, but in the soul of a man where life begins in the soul of a believer here before they ever go to heaven. I'll tell you this. Amen. I know that we were born in sin and we were shaped in iniquity. Amen. But God gave us grace this morning that we might be able, amen, to be able to switch that birth into a heavenly birth before we ever go there and become citizens. Now, the prophet, Amen, says something that's powerful to me. He said he's seen both places. &gt;&gt; I saw a vision of both places by the grace of God. It's, if I'm wrong, forgive me, but I believe I've been in both places. I've seen the redeemed. I've seen the blessed. I've seen the lost and I've seen where they're at. And that's why I stand, brother, today to warn you to flee from a downward path. Don't you never go down that road. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you've got everything to live for. Blessed upward way. When the redeemed of joy and peace, they can't be sorry. There is nothing. They are perfect. Seen both places. And I know it's an awful statement for a person to make, but I believe I've seen both both places. Far be it from any person entering the region of the lost. If you're standing there with hot wires bored through you, tormented in every way, it'd not be like the devil torment that's in that place. There could be nothing. A human mind cannot comprehend what the region of the lost is. There's no way to explain this. There's no way to explain the regions of the blessed. It's so great and that's so horrible. It's from the ridiculous to the sublime. Don't you never go that way. Now, Brother Brandham says it. He said, "When I was in the realms of the loss, I screamed out and said, "Oh, God." He said, "Don't never let a person come here. You can't. There's no tongue to describe the horrors of it. There's no way for me to tell you. If you believe there's a burning hell full of fire and brimstone, that would be a cool shady green pasture to the side of what horrors of this lost condition and the misery that's associated in this place. When I was a little boy, that's when he fell in the vision of hell. Now, just for your uh studying, I want you to know that's when he was talking about when he he died on the table when he had been shot in the legs and descended into hell. And he said, "I cried, oh God." He said, "But there wasn't no God there." And he said, "I cried, oh mama, but there was no mama there." He said, he remember he said, and then he cried. And he said, I cried, but there was nothing there. And he said, I could not offer to God anything. I couldn't say that I had done this or this. He said, the only thing I could say is that I had never committed adultery. But see, there was no appeal before the throne of God that would set a man out of that region of the lost other than the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh, the precious blood of Jesus and it can do what nothing else is able to do. There is no religion, there is no church, there is no church annity, there is no memberships, there is nothing on this planet that can keep a man out of the region of the lost, outside of the blood of Jesus Christ. There is no other hope for the generation. Oh, that precious blood. My how it runs through my stream right this very moment. Oh, the blood, this rock I stand. There is nothing else. There is no other place of hope. There's nothing else for this lost generation. There's nothing else for humanity but the blood of Jesus Christ. No denomination can do it. No pope of Rome, no bishops, no hopes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. So, Brother Wayne, what are you talking about? Do you know Jesus saw what brother Ram said he saw? &gt;&gt; Jesus said from this dimension. He saw both places and he describes them before the blood. And he says that I saw he said I saw a rich man in hell lifted up his eyes and looked unto Abraham's bosom where the old poor Lazarus was in the bosom of Abraham and there was a gulf pitch between them and he said let I pray thee that Lazarus would come and put some some water on my lips but there was no way that they could pass in between those gulfs. Now now friends, brother Bam is very clear to help us in these things because that's before the blood. That's before the blood. So that was a place because man could not go into heaven. He was put in a place called paradise. Amen. But on the death barrel and resurrection of Jesus, he emptied out paradise and took these people into that new Jerusalem or that city of God. Amen. But now we find that Jesus, amen, visiting both of those place spoke of that rich young ruler and spoke of him as one, amen, that gained the world but lost his soul. See, what good is a man than if you gain the whole world &gt;&gt; and lose your soul? &gt;&gt; That soul that could live throughout eternity in perfection. &gt;&gt; Or that soul that can torment in the regions of the lost for eons. &gt;&gt; Now listen, there is a place for an unrepented sinner. There is a literal heaven. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there is a literal hell. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter 5, Paul says it. I I I like how he says it now in first verse. If we could read it. Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love. And Christ also loved us and gave himself an offering for us as a sweet smelling savior. He said, "But fornication and uncleanness or covenantness, let it not be once named among you, has become a saints, neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor gesting, which are not convenient, but rather of giving thanks. For this you know that no whoreonger, no unclean person, no covetous man who is an adulterer have any inheritance in the in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you, for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be ye not partakers with them. Any man tells you, Amen, that it don't matter how you live, what you do, where you go, that man's lying to you. &gt;&gt; There'll come a day that sinners will turn over the ash heaps of hell, hunting that lying preacher that shook their hand and told them, "You're okay now, honey. Listen, you are not okay until the baptism of the Holy Ghost seals that soul under the token of the word of life. Amen. Listen, I I know that somebody said, "Well, brother Wayne, this is a little rough." No, it amen. It ain't near as rough. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's not near as rough. In in Revelation 21 and 27, the Bible said, "There shall then no wise enter into anything that defileth it, neither whatsoever workketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they that which are written in the Lamb's book of life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch the scripture. In Revelation 21:7, it said, "He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and the unbelieving, the abominable, the murderer, the hormonger, the sorcerer, the adulterer, and the liars shall have their part in the lake of fire, which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now the second death in Revelation 20 and verse 10, the Bible said, "And the devil deceived them that were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night and forever. Death and hell follows after it." &gt;&gt; Do you see who's there? the devil, the beast, the f, the one that said William Brandon was wrong on that baptism. &gt;&gt; The one that said that that truth about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that eternal security when life comes on the soul, the ones that lied on that and said just sign here and become a member of our denomination and and if you'll accept our trinitarian our trinitarian doctrine, then then you can have it. See? Amen. But that was deceived. They deceived them and cast them into the lake of fire to be tormented day and night. And then there's a great white throne of judgment. But watch in the 14th verse. And the Bible said, "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire." And this is the second death. &gt;&gt; Death and hell and the false prophet and the devil. They're all going to be cast into the lake of fire. Listen, I'm glad to know today, amen, that there is a coming, an end to this devil. There is coming a death to this devil. Amen. That's what we believe. I believe there is a complete annihilation of the soul that sins. The soul that sinnth shall surely die. The soul now Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed. How I disagree with universalists that say Satan will be saved. He sinned and his soul sinned and his spirit shall be totally annihilated and there will be nothing left of him. Oh, devil, I hope you're listening to us this morning. You deceiver, &gt;&gt; you demon that tries to deceive God's children, you are totally annihilated at the end of this thing. Listen, I take Thank God this morning there won't be no more devil. How could heaven be perfect and a devil be there? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, brother, I think there's an eternal hell." Now, let me just get down into some real reality just a moment. You know, Brother Brandham, the fifth seal divides the bride from Israel. Y'all know how he does it. He said they're crying how long? And they're looking for vengeance. He said that can't be the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen at their cry. Vengeance. He said that can't be the bride. &gt;&gt; See, because in Revelation 21, it calls her the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; She's the voice of mercy. She's the voice of grace. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You can't tell me that we're going to enjoy ourselves eternally and think of someone burning in a hell. &gt;&gt; Come on. How could we enjoy heaven and somebody burning in hell? Brother Rama actually says that. He said, "Did you see God completely does away with it? He completely does away with the memory of it and and takes the memory of the wicked and completely abolishes it so that there won't be any pull in your spirit throughout eternity." Amen. Just as we find the Bible said the soul that sinnth it shall surely die. Come on. We don't believe in eternal hell. But we do know there's eternal death &gt;&gt; because the Bible says a woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she yet liveth. &gt;&gt; Now folks, I this is this is just the plain gospel. &gt;&gt; You can live how you want to. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the pleasure of sin is only for a season. &gt;&gt; And the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching the scripture now. &gt;&gt; And the soul that sinnth shall surely die. Amen. But but we find out God tells us that every one of us was born in death. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come to this earth speaking lies. But Ephesians opens it up and says, "But God who is rich in mercy, while we were yet dead in our sins." &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God that he came through the graveyard of Leodysia and woke me up. &gt;&gt; Now, how did he wake you up? He preached this message over me and the light of the resurrection said, "Come out of that tomb of unbelief and sin and denomination and live, child. If you shall repent of your sins, you shall live." Amen. I'll tell you this. We won't have to die because we live. We live right now. We're alive right now. &gt;&gt; Therefore, your name is in his thinking. Before there was a world began. Now, we were dead and we were separated. But the Bible said while we were yet in our sins, he quickened us and made us together with Christ. That way, grace you are saved. Do you know Romans 5 teaches a beautiful sermon? And Paul says it. He says that. He says, "Listen, he died for us while we were yet sinners. &gt;&gt; We were dead. &gt;&gt; But he died for us." &gt;&gt; Do you know he died for every person that will accept him? &gt;&gt; There is not one person that couldn't turn to Christ this morning and say, "I want to accept you." that he would turn away. &gt;&gt; He said he wouldn't. I will in no wise cast them out. &gt;&gt; He died for us while we were yet ungodly. Now, this this is just simple gospel. &gt;&gt; We all sinned &gt;&gt; and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And without the blood of Christ, you would never reach it. Because the commandment over your life, Brother Mike, he said, "Be ye perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect." And there is no perfection that you can reach that without the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You'll never reach that kind of perfection. That's why my Bible said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Do you know in John chapter 5 and verse 24 it said he that believeth on me he says he has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from death &gt;&gt; unto life. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, heaven is for the overcomer. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us in Hebrews, in Revelation chapter 2, that he that overcomemeth shall not be hurt by the second death. &gt;&gt; Blessed is holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection. On such the second death hath no power. See, now you start getting a glimpse into Brother Bram's teachings on the realities of accepting God through the word. &gt;&gt; Look at what he's starting to say because brother Bram goes in there and he tells us very clearly that a man that is born of God can no more die than God can die. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If God has put life in you, you cannot die any more than God could die because the life is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Now, sin has an end. Suffering has an end. Amen. But eternal life has no end. &gt;&gt; It's Zoey life. &gt;&gt; This service will have an end. It's Zoe life. &gt;&gt; See the life that has no end. &gt;&gt; Nothing but purity will be there. &gt;&gt; The life of God eternity for the ages and on and on. Do you see the overcomer? The overcomer will inherit all things. &gt;&gt; But brother, what does it mean to overcome? Brother Bam said it means to beat down. It means to handcuff. &gt;&gt; It means to It means to bind it. The thing that mastered you, you now master it. &gt;&gt; To overcome. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said the overcomers of the Leodysian age. What is it that they overcome? He says, do you see it? They overcome what? That nickel in spirit. &gt;&gt; They overcome the things of the world. They overcome these denominations. They overcome these priesthoods. They overcome everything the world and sells out to love Christ. So you'll not be hurt by the second death. He has got eternal life. Do you see? Amen. I I find a a great soulless in small statements because they sometimes they're the ones that really penetrate the heart. &gt;&gt; Where John chapter 4, he said, "Ye are of God, little children." &gt;&gt; Yeah. see that you have overcome this world. And greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in you than he that's in this world. &gt;&gt; The greater one is already on the inside. So your faith has raised up to conquer. You have already overcome. &gt;&gt; That's why you're sitting here this morning. &gt;&gt; You had to be an overcomer. Even even to make it to this church, you had to overcome. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; To overcome means to stand the test. Every one of you's been tested. Every one of you's been pushed to your limits. But for some reason, we're still here. &gt;&gt; Tested in every direction. But we overcome every test, every day, every morning. And you say, "Well, preacher, amen, I tell you what, I'm here." But see, we're not just here. We got life in us. &gt;&gt; Because overcome means keep life in you. Listen, brothers. I believe we got life this morning because the word keeps pouring life in the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. To him that overcomemeth. Amen. He shall inherit all things. I'll tell you this. Amen. I I I I don't know. Amen. What would be greater than to hear the Lord say to you, "Enter in my good &gt;&gt; and faithful." &gt;&gt; That's a powerful word, isn't it? &gt;&gt; My good and faithful. &gt;&gt; Yes. my good and faithful servant. Do you see? It was in that place, in that sixth dimension when brother Brandham went there. Now, we're not dealing with postmillennial at this time. It's in that dimension where brother Brandham went in and he said they were everyone in white robes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they he asked them where where did they get these white robes? And he said they got it by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word. &gt;&gt; Now a church can give you a membership, &gt;&gt; but they can't give you a white robe. &gt;&gt; It's only the word that can give that robe. Do you see a place? Heaven is a real place, brother Kyle. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's worth compelling people to go. &gt;&gt; If if it if it if it wasn't if it wasn't knowing the horrors of hell and and the great and the great punishments that await that we would compel them out of it. Heaven is good enough to compel you to go by itself. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Heaven Heaven is the kind of place where every person wants to go. And you know the beauty of it. If you're if you're not on your way to you that's on your way this morning. Amen. I I think you ought to be I think you ought to feel pretty good about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if you ain't on your way this morning, I want you to know there's an invitation being given right now. &gt;&gt; There is an invitation to go to a place. The place that I'm going. You you know you know where I'm going. Brother Bam said I could say this. He said he said if there's one going, &gt;&gt; this is the way you believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm the one. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The place that I'm going, I just got to I just got to thinking on this. The place I'm going. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you where I'm going. I'm going to a place where there won't be any demons. &gt;&gt; And there won't be no devils. &gt;&gt; There won't be no Satan. There'll be no adversary, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There'll be no sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There'll be no unbelief there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there'll be a total annihilation of all darkness. &gt;&gt; There'll be no more sickness as a result of unbelief. Instead, there will be perfect bodies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No pains. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No Tylenol. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No need for pain medication. &gt;&gt; There won't be no backachches. No ED trouble. Come on now. I'm talking about a real place. &gt;&gt; There is a place where the blind is going to see. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; there won't be no glasses or no contacts there. &gt;&gt; There will be no impaired visions. There will be no eye diseases to restrict you which you won't be able to see because brother Amen. Thank God that blindness is going to Amen. going to be taken away because there will be no eye disease to steal the sights that you're going to see. Thank God that the blind will see because look at what you'll be able to see once a man gets into heaven. I don't know about y'all, but sometimes I get up in the mornings and I walk by my flower garden and somehow when the when the sun hits those blooms, I I just can't hardly take the colors. I feel them. I don't know if you if I'm crazy. I may be crazy, but I I feel the colors when I stand up high peak out there in Colorado. Brother Jeremy knows my feeling. Amen. you're right there at the end of September and the golden aspen starts spreading out across and blending into those evergreens and the clarity and the sun starts hitting that and you can literally feel the brilliance of it and and it's just so magnitude and the fire of it and and you can just feel it and I think oh if we could see this in this dimension with the eyesight of heaven and and where there's no bugs there there's no there's nothing to destroy the shimmer of the aspen the deep green of the evergreen the giant oaks will grow air planted by the Lord's own hand will stand in glory. Birds will rest safely in the breaches thereof singing their songs. There'll be all kinds of song birds there. And just out of instinct, you won't have to pull out a book. You'll know every name. &gt;&gt; You'll know every tune. Amen. You'll be able to identify every tune. I I I think uh Spencer, what's he about one? He's almost two now. We walked out by the house by the evergreens the other day. walked around the corner of the house and and a little uh dove was cooing over there. Coo coo. And he says, "It's an owl, papa." I said, "It's almost an owl, buddy. But that's a dove. That's the coup of the dove." Pretty good for a year old, though, I thought. Amen. It's a It's an owl, Papa. Amen. But I say this. Amen. Up there, we'll identify every bird in every song. You look and see the joy. See, you can see it now. You can see it without the obscurity of humanity. You'll see the joy of your brothers and your sisters on their face. That old saintly mother that struggled along and she struggled. You'll see her in her young body rejoicing in the grace of God. I tell you, I'm going to look for some of y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I expect, Amen. Amen. To see the real you, that one. Amen. I don't know if y'all ever watch this or not, but Sister Mary, she's a dancer in hiding back there. She I watch her. She'll pat that foot and hit that hand. I tell you what, you get her over there on that other realm in that new body and there won't be no holding that back no more. Amen. Because, Amen, there'll be a peace that'll come, a joy, amen, to every person. Amen. There it is. Amen. There'll be no feeble fathers and no weary friends. &gt;&gt; There'll be no weary friends there. There'll be no old dad. Well, Jonathan, you won't help.

Let me tell you, this will be the noisiest place that you've ever been. &gt;&gt; Heaven is going to be the happiest place that you've ever seen. Every deaf is going to hear. There will not be a hearing aid. There will not be an impaired Amen. Nobody having to say, "Huh?" It won't be nobody that cannot clearly hear. When we stand to our feet and begin to say, "Oh, hail King Jesus." And we crown him Lord of Lords. Our ears will hear the distinct cries. Oh, I believe God will give me hearing that I'll be able to individualize some of you and hear you. And when you say, "Oh, amen. Hell, the power of Jesus name." Amen. I'll see you, hear you, know that you made it to the other side. It won't be a silent place. Even the death is going to hear no herinade, no struggle, no Amen. No. You You'll be able to hear that singing bird all the way on the other side of the world. You'll be able to hear that bugle of that elk. Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; you ain't never been there. If you ain't never been there, you know, &gt;&gt; you ain't break the stillness of that morning.

I tell you, Brother Jim, won't it be a day, Amen, when you see Brother Jim taking off and sprinting and saying, "Look at my new legs, folks." Amen. We did the best we could do here, but God had a new pair. The lame is going to walk. The blind is going to see. Amen. I'm not talking about a Pharisee. I'm talking about a reality of almighty God.

There will be no disabilities, no hurts, no anger, no pain, no &gt;&gt; to the known man, there's about 18,000 different diseases. And all of those 18,000 diseases, there won't even be one there. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many disabilities known to man, but there won't even be one there. &gt;&gt; But King Jesus, he'll be there. &gt;&gt; And brother, I'm going to be there. And I trust every person sitting in this building this morning's going to be there because we're not going in on our works. We're not going to get to the gate and say, "Lord, I was a good man or I was a good boy or I was a good church member." We're going to go up and say, "Lord, I accepted the pardon of your grace and I accepted your blood. I'm here because I was invited to be here." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What an invitation this morning. &gt;&gt; Hey, I believe we got an invitation to come. And to him that wants to come can come freely. And there's nobody can turn you down. Stand to your feet with me this morning. It's a real place, folks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heaven is a real place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the place I'm going. &gt;&gt; It's the place I'm going. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. you're young in your body and you you don't have any sick friends or you're not taking care of anybody, it means something to you. But if you're in one of them families where you're daily working and helping and dealing with the disabilities and the inadequacies and the oh just one thought of it, &gt;&gt; just one thought that there's a place You know, this is the kind of destination that you don't get somewhere along the way and say, "Well, this would be nicer here." When they were moving west to California from the in the manifest destiny in the 17 1800s, they'd be going across there and take it to Ohio and say, "There's a better place in California. I'll just settle here." But as you journey to heaven, there won't be no place. &gt;&gt; There won't be no destination [Music] that you're going to get to in this life to say, "This is better here." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because Paul said it was far greater. That's a big word. It's far greater. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. I don't know what your heart is, but I know I'm going. How many say, "Brother Wayne, I'm going. &gt;&gt; I'm not going because I It's not It's not my merits." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've accepted I've accepted the pardoning grace of this word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go, brother Ben, if you would. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm kind of home [Music] sick for a country. [Music] Oh yes, Lord. [Music] you which I never been before. Oh, thank you, Father. Oh, sad goodbye. till there is broken. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for time won't matter in you. [Music] to the land. I'm longing for you. [Music] And someday [Music] only I'll stay there my [Music] shall be eternal. Lord you land. Sweet you land. [Music] Oh, I'm looking now [Music] across the river [Music] to where my shall live inside. Oh, it's just a few [Music] days to labor and I will take [Music] my heaven.

Oh, I'm looking now across the across the river [Music] to where I [Music] shall. inside. Oh, there's just a few. There's just only a few [Music] more days to [Music] I will take My heavenly light you longing for you [Music] And someday all the I'll stay there my shall be eternal. Oh, [Music] you love sweet. You know, in preparing yesterday, I came across a song and I put it here in my notes on the number one song. It was Ba Land. The inspiration of the Lord just would pick it up and have brother Ben sang this song unprompted, untalked to. I got written here notes if you'd like to see it. It's just wonderful. There's somebody orchestrating &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; our lives. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This moment is prepared. &gt;&gt; There's a real heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That atmosphere that's coming in here now. That's a &gt;&gt; That's where a prophet said that God had expanded heaven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That it might be for our redemption so we could actually step into that realm. of heaven before we ever get there to feel his feelings to to see his graces. And I'll tell you this morning as we bow our hearts, I maybe maybe there's something going on in your life this morning that but in the view of what you're looking at and with heaven in front of you, you'd like to just set some of the baggage down and say, "Lord, I've let too many things get too important, &gt;&gt; but this is the important thing, Lord. This is this is the important thing. This is what I want to set my heart on. As we bow our heart this morning, hands going up across the building, I want to I want to pray with you. If somebody don't know the Lord Jesus, I want you this morning to accept him. Say, Lord, come into my heart right now, Lord. Make that my home, too. Father God, we bow our hearts today, Lord, knowing that you're a merciful God. this inspiration that just struck our hearts. Lord, I I recognize, Lord, that you're speaking to someone. You're speaking to even hearts across the room, Lord, to refocus, to reset our affections. And Lord, that's what we want to do. We We want to lay aside every weight, Lord. That we'll be able to run this race with our patience, Lord. That not just beginning, but we want to finish it, Lord. And we ask you this morning as we Lord, maybe some across the room say they just need to ask your forgiveness, Lord. Maybe there's things that begin to enter lives and entertainments and worldlyism and things that just begin to draw the attention causing numbness and coldness to enter their lives. Lord, I I pray that they take it out of first place this morning. Lord, they remember why you've called them. remember why they come to the house of the Lord and why this message is so real to them. Lord, I pray, Father, whatever has staggered them, that they would be rejuvenated this morning, refilled of your spirit. Lord, if there's one don't know you, I pray right now that you would just give them that grace to open their hearts that they'd be able to see them. Lord, as we baptize these young people this morning, Lord, Father, we believe it's a great symbol, a great outward expression of something you're doing. And I pray, Father, that it that Lord, it would have eternal significance this morning, Father. Lord, we want to thank you for your grace now as we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen and amen. And as brother Ben's going to lead us in a few songs, we're going to have a baptism. So, I'm just going to go back if you deacons would prepare things. Amen. God bless you, friends. We love you.
