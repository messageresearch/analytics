he's uh from china and he's a precious friend of mine very dear and we've gone to china i think up to 10 or 12 times together and he always calls me passionate he said tom you're passionate yeah he says when you eat you're passionate he he goes man he says you get a you get a steak in front of you as we did and hmm that's great he says it doesn't matter if it's spaghetti or steak you're passionate and he says but when you get behind the word you're really passionate so i that's a good reputation to have we're passionate people we love the word of god don't we i mean just think what would we be without this jesus called christ without this unveiled jesus what kind of people would we be we'd be miserable we'd be out in the world we'd be wondering what is in life but god has given us an answer we know who we are we know where we're going amen we've got a destination we've come from god and we're going back to god jesus said it and it confused the pharisees it confused them but then when the bride came on the scene she started to realize if she is him and he's come from god and going back to god then if she's in him she's come from god and she's going back to god amen take this whole world but give me jesus you know people got these mansions built on these hillsides you know and they think they've got everything and of course we've got on with these bezos and buzzos and

covet thing uh let's just stomp it now it has nothing to do with us it really doesn't you know the thing of it is satan hasn't figured this out yet he really hasn't he hasn't figured it out that he is a liar a cheat and defeated so whatever tactic he's owes through god's going to bring the victory and the glory out of this i've been given a prayer cloth and we're going to be praying for brother robert douglas he's in need i believe god raised brother robert right out of his bed amen i i i just happened to be a believer i i i'd rather be that way than the other way oh brother tom don't you know what the science says i hate that word science you know the science says how about the word says huh every time they say science say word said ask anything in my name believing you shall have what you ask that's what the word says but science says you can't do this you can't do that you'll never get well what are you talking about we've got miracles all around us brother brown said if god before us where's all his miracles didn't he say that he said if you want to see a miracle just look around you have to become a miracle to see a miracle then he turns around the token message he says you've got the very life of god in you and you're only asking what you are and you are the word come on this is what we are and we don't play church we are church right and people say we're going to church tonight you're looking after church tonight hey man where's brother asked ashton where's brother ashton where are you can you can you can i got to get you to stand brother aston my wife's gonna

home i told brother ray i said if i didn't get the back home i have to move in with brother ray he offered not quite i'm putting words in your mouth he did exactly that amen amen well god bless you i chose to come hungry tonight i get the people nervous when when my printer i'll blame my printer okay it just keeps fitting pages out what on earth is that all about i'm only gonna get to page two all right you got about 20 pages really and they're going to stay for 20 pages never but we'll just we'll find a nice spot lord willing and we'll continue on tomorrow morning i mean it's friday night listen i'll tell you what when i was in the world friday night was the big night it was you worked all week all week for friday night then you just let it loose then you couldn't even hardly get out of bed the next morning huh then saturday well my goodness this is saturday night and that was when you just craziness and then sunday was obliterated because you didn't even know that there was a sunday but by the grace of god we got saved and so the special saturday nights and the friday nights that we thought we had in the world are nothing compared to what we have in the presence of the lord amen praise the lord amen well god bless you let's down to our feet us open our bibles let's turn to uh first corinthians please chapter 13. and we'll re start reading at verse 9 to 13. now brother um wayne had asked me to write down some scriptures for the brothers to follow up and put the different quotes up but that's dangerous to me no i don't have to stay with my okay that's very dangerous because i even you know the brothers at home they say what's your title and by the time i get to the platform i've got three more titles so the title i gave them is not the title i got and i said what did i preach on anyway so we'll just preach okay so let's turn to we've got there first uh corinthians 13 verse nine the bible reads for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known let's bow our heads one more time father we've read your eternal word and it is alive tonight i pray god that you'll inspire it to both speaker and hearer that lord the word of god will come to the hearts of your children meeting the needs of each and every one of us we ask it in jesus name amen amen you may have your seats i'd like you now to turn please to revelation chapter 10 revelation chapter 10. revelation chapter 10. of course we know revelation 10 1 and the mighty angel descended we understand that that has been fulfilled and we are church well fed here so i i'm just going to hit the highlights of this and so we go revelation 10 1 the one that was clothed with a cloud rainbow was upon his head and we understand that was fulfilled and and and there had to be a prophet on on the scene brother braham said in the seals there had to be a prophet on the scene revelation 10 7 had to be there for revelation 10 1 to take place and so then we we get that and and um i i said to the church the other day i said don't ever ever be afraid of the book of revelation the book of revelation is the bride's book and the whole world looks at it and they ponder it and they wonder they're afraid of it but we're not afraid of it we love it because it's our book and now i want you to take a look at verse six and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heavens and the things that are therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer so now in this scripture in between revelation 10 1 and revelation 10 7 it doesn't take a rocket science to figure out that this scripture is between the two so a lot of people think that time is going to keep on going on and they live as though time is going to go on but brother brown said he said our mission in life is to find the last one and when the last one takes place because of revelation 10 1 and revelation 10 7 we revelation 10 8 understand what this book and the purpose we have is all about is that fair to say that that with that went down real easy that that's just wonderful thank you so then i'd like to to you know a real real deep title for you i got a real deep title for it tonight i got it you know you know you know anybody graduate here oh yeah and that is crazy it is really crazy when you ask something like that that some people don't is that a trick question right and then you know you sort of go like this like you're embarrassed no hey i graduated hey i made it right i got it right i got my diploma or is that true yeah anybody play ball with their children at all but you know are we too spiritual for that or what did somebody play ball with their boy okay and he hit that ball and he goes dad dad i got it do you ever hear that and then get boned in the head or something and he didn't quite get it but as time went on he got it he got it anybody got a fish fish anybody anybody fish around here oh sure look at those hands go up look at that huh i know you did i just just check it you know and all of a sudden that lure goes oh yeah i hit ah i got it huh there's a little expression it's common it's it's good right so you get your twelve i got it i caught your ball i caught it i caught the fish i got it right how we got any math people here ah okay yeah math math there's a key to math and when you get math and there's a key to it and you get the law of it and then you get in the equation of it and you start working in it i got it sure that's a good feeling it's a good feeling anybody here got saved what happened what happened the night you got saved you said hey i got it i finally got it is that not true i remember i got saved i was along and somebody said talked about hippies today when i don't know look at me and said were you in the hippie era do i look that old apparently i am okay and so you know we're we're in that i remember in the long hair you know the whole deal and i went to a little house meeting and i ran into it and all of a sudden i run up the stairs i hate dad he said what's on i said i got it he said what did he get i said i got jesus jesus who where were christian background we didn't know nothing but when i got it i got it and when you get it you get it and when the word comes alive you got it and i'm talking to a people that have moved now into their position that you can say i got the word i am the word i walk in the word i got it it's not a fish it's not a ball it's not a math equation but i got the word [Applause] amen once you get him you've got everything once you get jesus you get everything you get the alpha you get the omega you get the almighty god do you get the prince of peace you get jehovah shalom jehovah tiscanu jehovah sharma you get everything so what is your problem we have no problems i want to say jesus had no problem oh but come on you've heard she's him how many her ever heard that expression she's him bonus bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his fears life is his life man barely making it man where did that come from that came from laodicea that did not come from thus saith the word listen we got to know who we are in christ and i want you to say tonight by the time we finish i got it i got that which is perfect discount i got that word and it's alive in me [Music] hey many many men yes sir so we got the mighty angel i got it huh i got it you say i know revelation 10 7. you say well that's brother brown is that true of course it is but now we're moving to revelation 10 8 and then it gets a little quieter no no it should get a little higher should get a little higher because the book came down to a prophet but didn't stay in his hand he passed it to you and when he passed it to you he passed the word and the word is christ [Applause] hallelujah amen so now you say well i got the book now what are you gonna do with the book hold the book are you gonna eat the book i think you're gonna eat the book aren't you that's what my bible says eat the book i'm passionate come on if you're going to eat the word you might as well be passionate about it come to church you might as well be passionate about it amen passionate people think we're crazy let us be crazy in a way they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers amen glory be to jesus brother brahman says here lifting him up out of history he said we're standing tonight on the brim watching come to pass and unfold the great scenes these two great scenes and these are one of them is the ending of history time shall be no more he delayeth no longer so now he's saying one of the two scenes has taken place history the ending of history and the other is the ending of time the ending of time many great men down through the ages have longed to see this hour that we are in now as we live in this glorious scene it's a setting of mortal sun and the breaking of eternal light i do feel that we are living in one of the grandest ages that man has ever been permitted to live now let me tell you something saints the quotes that i quote tonight are not the quotes of just william branham because we're going to get into this he was just a veil that god stepped into and spoke to you the elected lady so these aren't the words of man this is the thought of god concerning you we're at two great events the ending of history and the ending of time and so now then we must be blending into eternity okay you got that we're blending into eternity we're living in one of the grandest ages that man has ever permitted to live think about it think about it you know the devil has beat us down so bad you know who more me my me you know look at my problems and all that and god is telling you you're living in the grandest time that man has ever seen but my car's breaking down who's isn't man the bearing went out so what i was driving the other day hit a pothole my wheel fell off i said what's with that and i'm not a mccarrick so i stand out of the car and everybody thinks anybody gets out of a car once your car is broken down that you think you know what you're doing right and a guy comes running up to me ken he says uh can i help you in what you're doing i said i'm not doing nothing i'm just looking at a broken tire i mean it's crazy but you know who doesn't have a problem right and so then we get into the problem party my problem bigger than your problem come on okay let's just erase all the problems because he'll take care of every one of them if we let him the problem of it is we think we can correct our problem we just need to step back and say lord help me through this problem amen we are the most grandest time that man has ever seen yes sir he says we're living in the grandest age that's ever been permitted to live because it's the closing of time and the blending in of eternity history only tells us what we have read and what we've been and what's in the future lays is in the hand of god and we find out today there's not too much history being written because i don't think it'll ever be used so now brother branham is setting a platform can you turn with me please to genesis 1. genesis chapter 1 verse 1. i i you could quote it i know it yeah yeah let's read it together listen let's read it together as a class all right say in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period i agree i was flying i was flying overseas i was going to europe and i was sitting in my seat looking out the window i said man i'm flying at 36 000 feet you know that's pretty cool i'm looking down at greenland and not much in greenland don't ever go there for tourism i don't think so a lot of ice when i was there and or flying over i should say and i'm looking at things like god you're great you're so great wonderful you're so wonderful and the fellow beside me goes what are you saying who are you talking to [Laughter] and i said myself you know that sounds weird to the world that really sounds weird i said actually i was just i was thinking about god oh wow that's really something i said well i said we're at 36 000 feet i said and there's a future home waiting for us at 15 hundred miles i said we're flying at five miles i said i'm not even not past the base they start looking at you like i mean you're way too deep for me man he says okay okay okay let's let's get down to the business you know the you guys say that you know god created the heavens and earth and in seven days and all these animals and where's the dinosaurs go i go wait i'm just looking out the window you know sometimes when you got a 10-hour flight you want to have some quiet time i said well i said let me let's let me he says you know you christians you always say that the earth is you know only you know so and god did it in seven days i said oh really really is that is that what we we believe well he says that's what i think you believe well that's better i said you're not thinking and he get and he turns to me says well sir he says listen he says what do you say well peter says you know that a day is in the lord says a thousand years and there's seven thousand years in creation i said but that was in the creation of the earth the earth could have been here for billions of years he says you actually believe that well i said i happen to have a bible we read genesis 1 together in the beginning god created the heaven and earth period he said i never thought of that before and so we take so much for granted the things that a prophet drops down or god drops down for us it's for us saints of god to have a peace and realize our god is a great god he is a very great god so let's take this now in the beginning brother braham said in christ identified in this the same in all generations 1964 he says now in the beginning that is when time started okay time started at a point because god is eternal so as soon as the bible says in the beginning that is when time started okay this is what your prophet is saying in the beginning that's when time started when eternity broke down into time this is amazing can you imagine eternal god and so now time dropped down now he goes on to say this he says now after a while time comes back to eternity so imagine if i had like a balloon or a round circle and i just cut out the top and like this in this big circle so in this timeline in the beginning so we got the old testament new testament calvary seven ages and the end of time and that's what we're speaking now we're coming to the end of time come to the end here so now eternity broke down into time now after a while time comes back to eternity glory time comes down back into turn course time is eternity too yeah this is a little getting into math glory i can quit preaching i'm going home that's it that's it we're at the end of time we've come time from eternity into time remember the quote kinsman redeemer use it at weddings remember she loves him he loves her they don't know why they stepped out of eternity into time and they will step back to eternity together that's the window he was giving you and i we might be in time but we're breaking back into eternity we're eternal beings if you were ever in the thought of god you're eternal that's what he said he said because god can never have a new thought you always were now you're a manifestation of the thought of god being fulfilled in your age so god saved you for the special age the end of time age bride age the breaking into eternity age oh brother sister we should be shouting dancing up and down we should be thanking god you say well i got a mortgage i got a payment and i got this you got nothing we got this i got it once you realize where you come from you're gonna go to the same place where you came from amen so now this great chain of perfection eternity this great chain of perfection was broken in time space time came because of sin the fall of man that's when time began in the beginning so now time came because of sin let's draw a picture of that time so he drives brother ram dallas is a perfect circle it goes on forever and ever and ever and then all of them once sin dropped in and put a line as my wife calls it a little drop in the chain so the chain was around now it came like this we got that space of time in this chain it comes down now but eternity continues eternity continues god's eternal eternity can it just keeps on going but we're in this space called time but it's not his perfect condition it's not god's perfect condition here's a little gap come down broke over this way goes out that way god had to do that because satan caused it it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and perfecting and for the purging of the lost that god by his sovereign grace might someday lift that gap back up into a perfect circle and then shall roll on and on and on so god's dealing with us in this space called time so in this space of time he starts revealing himself he revealed himself to abraham as jehovah jireh jehovah tiscanu revealed himself as melchizedek god keeps on revealing himself through this space of time and here we're at the end of time knowing all about god's unveiling and that's why he called it the mighty god unveiled before us because he was showing us where god was all through the ages so there's anything god was a prophet is showing you past present and future come on you stay with me because he already saw you in glory he already saw you over there he says don't say i'm gonna make it he said you've already made it i saw you there where were you prophet i was in eternity glory he lived between those two realms that's your prophet that's my prophet that's what we believe brother ray this is what we believe so now time came down at the end of time he was going to have a prophet come in this generation to literally turn your hearts back to the faith of our fathers amen so that faith in us gets so strong he says in the holy ghost series that we lift raise up and the resurrection takes place he said you're already resurrected come on you're already resurrected he said all you're waiting for is your body to catch up to what's already happening hallelujah praise the lord got it that's all you have to say i got it i didn't learn it i got it i got the principle i got it amen if i'm too loud to you forgive me i'm passionate we're passionate he's the author he's the beginner he is the creation of god time time is a little loop it loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity oh i love that expression how the prophet does that jesus was eternity to eternity you know that's like but he stepped into time space and was made flesh and came here in order to sanctify come on you stay with me now saying please once sanctified you're sanctified once justified you're justified once filled with god you're filled with god he can't unfill you he can't unsanctify you he can't unjustify you he calls you the perfect sinless spotless bride of jesus christ that's his thought i got it it's not a quote i got it i got it hallelujah he stepped into time to sanctify to put a streak of blood all across that place to redeem it and connect it back to god again oh my we could have a shouting vote right now this is better than any home run it's better than every base loaded and hitting a home run and the crowd goes crazy saints this to me is where people should be going crazy i've come from eternity i'm going back to eternity he saw you in eternity he said they took me and said brother brown brother branham's here brother brown hey we're tangible we're tangible there'll be tall ones short ones brother wayne and me i think we'll be a little slender hopefully did he say hopefully hopefully huh brother brown said there'll be red hair what no why no he's white i'm not white i'm blonde i hate to tell you you're looking at a blonde man here i might as well prophesy huh we might as well we might as well tell you know my brethren said the high priest can't even move until you first confess it i might you might as well say hey i got a new body i'm going to step into my new body huh you might as well say it and they say brother robert has a need he's healed we might as well say it because that's what we are this is what we are saints so he came in order to sanctify us to put a streak of blood across the place to redeem it and connect it back to god again for all eternity do you see it got it that's all time jesus christ was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world how many believe that you're the bride of jesus christ ah okay so we are a bride and i'm not gonna i'm not looking at anybody when i say this because if we are the bride we're not children god marries bride right so now you have a message called why cry spake come on okay i'll look all over here and not look at anybody over here so now he he makes an announcement to us he said samson didn't even have to pray anymore he was anointed come on come on we're anointed we are already under an unction we are anointed to any devil that comes by our way he said he didn't have to have a prayer meeting he knew who he was and when that devil came he killed those devils [Applause] he killed him he says then why are you crying now look over here so why are you crying he says when any little thing comes up why do you act like a baby okay i'll look over here i'll look at the very back but i didn't say this prophet huh revelation 10 7 but who was speaking through revelation 10 7. revelation 10 1. and what is he doing he's telling the bride to eat the book hey so he says why be babies no more nah don't cry speak it we're breaking into eternity we're going into a rapture we're going into a body change we can't be a bunch of babies over every situation brother erickson there won't be any phone calls in next month you just say didn't you hear what brother tom said actually it's page 39 why can't i speak if anybody wants to put it down is it okay everybody all right he says you know when any little thing comes up you act like a baby you ought to be a man and then this is where we're coming to when that which is perfect is come that which was in part is done away because when i was a child i spake but now i became a man i'm a son of god i've been birthed by the word of god and i claim my position i claim it in the name of jesus christ i claim my children i claim my wife i claim my husband i claim my family hallelujah this is the token age it's the bride age come on why not believe tell the devil let my people go [Applause] amen for the enemy you see today you will see no longer the horse and his rider went into the sea come on the white horse red horse black horse dale horse you will see it no longer hallelujah he might change horses he can do whatever he wants to do but he's under the bride's feet he's under your feet and we're not babies no more come on dads we'll stand at a high priest of our home daddy have you got the blood on the door got it have you got the blood on the door daddy because the death angel's coming i got it hallelujah i got it i guarded by the grace of almighty god hallelujah listen brother brahman says in one place i've got the quote here he said we're living on ball road time we're waiting for the last one so it's borrowed time anybody let me praise this question you hear the news you know it's depressing so my suggestion to you don't hear the news you got 1100 tapes huh that's the good news that is the good news amen that is the good news we need to be in because brother ram said the next war you know this is it's almost comical you see the chinese and the chinese have this humongous army you see the march and they're all looking the same way it doesn't matter what country it doesn't matter what country and they show the power of these men you know what brother braham said he said he said the next war that takes place will only be three minutes you know that's why he called him atomic fodder now you start to understand some of the expressions now why would he call the nation atomic fodder well because they got a bomb now have you read i don't know whether you've studied it out but they have a bomb now that is 670 000 times bigger than hiroshima they said when it drops the continent is annihilated oh my loving brother when the world's on fire don't you want god's bosom oh to be your pillow hide me over in the rock of ages there's not going to be any guy with you know i've got the i got bullets now that go around corners and all of a sudden you see this rocket coming at you like big deal what's that rifle going to do you nothing so they put all their stock into their development of warfare the prophet saw america in ashes that house means to be america happens to be canada too oh we live in canada like at the 49th parallel nothing comes over like the virus this is crazy stuff and they actually believe it but i don't i don't because before you know let me just say this it was quite clinical because because everybody was you know thinking that when when all these borders were being broke loose and and atomic bombs were landing in or cases were landing in the hands of rogue countries and brother graham said it'll be just one little country that you know drank too much and push a button and so anyways you know we had a flurry of that a few years back and one of our brothers and was eating his lunch bucket and i i wasn't eating his lunch bucket he was eating out of his lunch bucket and um when he was eating of course you know a believer is at one end of the table and all the cronies are on the other end and we all know about that and so he's quietly eating his lunch and they said man the bunk could fall any time man aren't you worried about it and all the guys going yeah man what are we gonna do let's get into the mountains like the mountain's going to help you so the brother at the end of the table they said well aren't you worried he said not at all he says why aren't you worried my prophet said before one bomb falls he said i'm going in a rapture that was the quietest lunchroom you ever saw but i got it we got it for old time he says we're living on borrowed time no wonder brother bram said it's three minutes to midnight so i just happened to study that out hey three minutes i wonder how it's ticked since the prophet left he said you got 100 seconds got you 100 seconds that just warms your heart when you get up in the morning hi honey we got 100 seconds left huh and the bride she gets up in the morning says glory be to jesus what a difference huh what a difference yes sir so here we are living on borrowed time so god in his grace and love and mercy in the space of time is unveiling himself because he can't he can't reveal himself as the great unknown god the great god that fills all space and time brother braham said in christ the mystery god revealed he said he's too great for that to ever be revealed to people too mysterious for that he said he's such a great being that never did begin but after you went beyond the cycle of a hundred of billions of trillions and trillions of years of light space and we're talking about a grade 7 education that's god speaking to us man on into the infinite in infant infinity and eternity and a great creature that was all that time but he loved fatherhood so in this great god he loved fatherhood and in loving fatherhood he says because he he wanted to be a father the only way he could do that was to become the son of man the son of man and that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man the son of man why it was god immorphy god changing his mask oh i love this can you stay with me on this for a little bit are we doing all right for time okay so here's a morphe your god comes down in a body of flesh and morphy so now he came to abraham's tent true and and abraham said lord but man said that was elohim right you didn't even see the other two he just saw elohim it was god unveiling himself in morphy so then gideon meets him under a tree in morphy you always have to have a prophet for god to change his mask god always abraham prophet had to see elohim god can never show himself until there's a prophet showing you in morphy so when jesus came john the baptist had to be here come on stay with me so john the baptist said behold the lamb of god they're taking away the sins of the world is that right because now prophet has to introduce a morphe god in flesh then here comes paul the pillar of fire and it had to be paul prophet to say that's jesus come on stay with me so then when william branham was here the pillar of fire came back there had to be a prophet to let us know that revelation 10 1 has come i got it because whenever god changes his mass there always has to be a prophet because god can do nothing amos says until first he reveals it to his servants the prophet first says that right so we've got to say with the bible but if you look it up in the greek if you want to do some studying it'll tell you that that god can never unveil himself without a prophet i thought it was beautiful i love that oh my then god changed his mask one more time amen i no longer call you church come on i no longer call you church i call you bride it took a prophet to let you know god is in you [Applause] yes sir bone of his bone that's what he kept on saying now to the end of his ministry your bones with bones spirit of the spirit flesh is fast life is with his life i can't speak fast enough i'm not like these young fellas that can speak like but isn't that marvelous my girls what a privileged people you are i would have loved to been like these young men to hear what i'm hearing i never heard nothing until i was 21. never heard nothing i didn't know where john 3 16 was didn't have a clue you know he ever come to church and and the minister says will you turn to habakkuk everybody's going habakkuk and you don't want the neighbor to know where you're looking in the table of contents you don't so you know here i am i'm just new i don't know nothing i don't know where john is i could have been looking in genesis for all i know so i go to the table condos my ears are burning of course there's only 15 people in church at that time but you're just a little embarrassed because you didn't know anything and yet here are these young men that can take the wisdom that they've already received now and confused that's why jesus being the word could confuse those pharisees at 12 years of age hallelujah all the bible says in all that dwell upon the earth shall worship the beast but those names that were not written in the book of life will worship them but those whose names were written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world she'll take a rapture that blood streak was abel's lamb that blood streak was was isaiah uh isaac's ram that blood streak was the token for israel that blood streak came to calvary that blood streak is that bleeding word that came in this generation and now the end of the chain has come and god's ready to pull the chain he's a abel's lamb isaac's ram children of israel's token lamb he was john the baptist there's a lamb of god he said eternity dropped down back into time through jesus christ so beloved jude says in jude three beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it's needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints can i give you another translation beloved well i'm making every effort to write about to you about the common salvation i'm compelled to write i'm urgently appealing that you fight strenuously for the defense of this faith and if jude could say it i can say it you can say it we earnestly contend and we'll fight for this revelation people might walk away from it and they've never had a revelation of it they can sit in your church for 10 years 20 years and you think they got what you got they ain't got nothing you got because once a revelation strikes your soul the gates of hell can never never never prevail against it what it shows that you can be sitting in church for 40 years and never have one revelation but there's a group of people amen written in the lamb's book of life she is revelated revelated revelated revelated that's why people fall asleep in church you catch me fall asleep you just say tell him i ain't got it really wrong really brother ray i've heard that my my he didn't get it he didn't get it sorry can i start then at the beginning you must be born again you must be born again because without the new birth you can't see the kingdom of god we try and give everybody we witness to everybody we want to tell them about prophet we want to tell them what god's done we give them serpentine we give them everything they got to get them born again first all they're learning is knowledge oh that you know how many people say well that sounds right really man when when i was i'm not saved and brother ken gave me serpenty man every light came on in the house he said do you mean i could be serpentine and not god's seed you mean that's why i have to be born again of the incre incorruptible seed of god and you know what he did on me he walked out of the room i said where are you going he says you figure it out i said i went through the school of hard knocks but i figured it out one day at an altar i said jesus i surrender all all to jesus i surrender and when i surrendered he took the dope he took the drugs he took the drinking he took the cigarette he took everything in a moment and i've never been the same they say you're a fanatic at 21 and you're a fanatic at 67. you watch me at 81. i'm gonna be like caleb come on i'm stronger now than i was 40 years ago give me my mountain i don't care if there's giants sons of attic i do not care god said he gave me my mountain come on mountain perfection come with me come on let's start climbing from faith force you know come on keep climbing it's your mountain but let me help you on this because doctrines get flying i'm not here to preach talking come on but if you if you said add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge when jesus said not not one man can add a cubit to his measure so tell me how you add let me tell you how do you add well i got faith well i got adverts you know no you can't do that that would be contrary to scripture but if you take a word ad and look it up it's epicorigo epicorigo means there is somebody that has wealth in you that is strong enough to pay your debt [Applause] glory and because it's faith you must lay in the presence of the sun listen you got a prophet that's a word prophet and they say well you're speaking greek he's preaching he's speaking the word and you just go in the word and you'll find it all through it and it's thrilling when you see it epic corgo somebody who has the wealth to pay all things and that the only way that you can add is to lay in the presence of the sun and that seed starts to grow hallelujah that's why he said it's the rising of the sun and the wave shape has been waved over you so the rest of the harvest is going to be like this wave sheep you've been waved over i'm sorry folks you've been waved over there's every one of you got victories got it got it every one of you got the joy joy joy joy donovan got it brian god bless you we got it it's not a theory it's not an understanding it's not a comprehension it's a it's life it's a life it's like this little boy who's 10 years old here anybody 10 just jump to your feet real quick you can sit down with me god bless you son what's your name gabriel i love that name thank you gabriel have a seat so a little young man like gabriel came to me i was in out in meetings and he said brother tommy said can i tell you something i said sure gabe tell me about it he said well i got a lamb i said okay blind bartimaeus all over again he says i got a pet lambie i said wonderful i love milami i said that's great he said but every time i let my lambie go and he hangs around the pigs he acts like a pig i hate he says i have to clean him up all the time because he's hanging around piggies but if you do but if he doesn't hang around pigs he's the lamb okay i'll preach to you [Laughter] you wonder why you lose victory you're hanging around the wrong people it's like i say to the young man back home get around stronger men come on stay with me get around man of faith men i love the message men i love the word so they can walk through the door one sunday night maybe or saturday night say mom i heard that little preacher preached i got it what you get son i'm a son of a living god i got it i got it we earnestly contend for this faith you wonder why preachers preach shout and jump and yeah i wish i was a preacher that was like you know somebody else hey i said man i admire that i like that but you know what i found out i just have to be the best tom that's all i have to do i don't have to copy anybody i don't have to be like anybody i just have to be me because there's only one of you and the sister said amen sugar leather is only one of him but that's true you got it it got to be original you are an original brother brahman said oh wayward man wayward woman this morning when you're sitting here there's something in you telling you some hour that's gone by that hour is now there were thousands there that had obeying an hour past but there was a present tense hour that was the hour that jesus is to appear and there stood the word there stood the people there was the manifestation of god taking place it was being vindicated it was truth manifested but not all saw not all saw i'm so glad that in this day that we're now living in the gloom and the darkness on every hand there seems to be a blessed hope gripping the heart of god's people that some glorious hour jesus shall arrive and in this great time of trouble in this city young folks are ignoring it and many people who don't care about it but the watchmen still cries out they're in their taverns they're drinking they're partnering but they have been warned they have been worn in this space called time nothing was going to harm them then all of a sudden judgment strikes whether it be titus whether it be pearl harbor they've been warned in laodicea we've all been warned amen and now by the grace of god you can say by the time i got it they might not get it but i got it god dropped down from eternity go back into eternity come back down to collect us and we go back to him we go back to him do you believe that come on benjamin franklin anybody know benjamin franklin of course you take history do you know thomas edison so good yeah okay well there had to be a benjamin franklin before there was a thomas edison and each one of them brother branham refers to he says there was benjamin franklin he said something in him said there's electricity that now who told him that who told that little boy there's sulfur in that petal what did he do chew on the guitar first huh then on the chair and then on the bike pedal there was a deep brother brethren's head calling to the deep and that deep called for the sulfur that was in the pedal brother rem said because his body was out of the earth and because his body came out of the earth his earth was calling for sulfur come on i want you to stay with me there was another book called the lamb's book of life and we came out of that book our names were written in that book and because we're in that book your deep is calling for that book you didn't have to look at the baptist church the catholic church any other church but this message was what your heart was calling for malachi 4 came for you amen behold i send you who's the you i got it i got it amen i don't care if it's for anybody else but i know it was for me he sent elijah for me he sent brother biscuit from toronto to cloverdale for me put brother ray erickson here for you you might as well say amen and glorify god for it amen so it was god rich in mercy our deep calling out eternity calling for eternity i got it i come from a place called eternity and i'm going to a place called eternity and how the holy spirit was trying to tell the people throughout the years of this message that god was on the scene and they just wanted to know their address can you imagine that tell me my address please you know your address i hope you know your address do you know where you live and they just wanted to know that god knew where they lived really you want to put god telling you where he is but what god was doing is being graceful and merciful graceful and merciful graceful and merciful and so he's trying to break on the scene for the people in the first poll second poll now he's coming to the third pole and now just like jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me and the bible says 70 disciples left him the multitudes wondered even peter said what's going on here let's be honest if i said to you hey gabe eat my flesh will you and drink my blood or you have no part of me that's exactly what you do and peter said he said peter you're going to go too he said lord where can i go i know one thing for sure you've got the words of eternal life amen gabe you've got a great revelation there i got the words of eternal life he got it who do men say that i the son of man am though at the christ the son of the living god he got it nothing shook him he did did peter have a bad time deny the lord three times i would say he had a bad day even custom swore i'd say that's a bad day anybody had a bad day but you did not lose come on brother graham said we make mistakes all the time but the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from every sin glory to jesus that blood reaches down to the lowest valley so now here here's god breaking on the scene in the message called looking to the unseen you've heard it i'm sure many times brother brown said don't you love those pulsations of faith why don't you just come on down and keep your hands up and praising him and all of a sudden as he says as they come into the altar he said i am the lord that raised christ from the grave where'd that come from i am the lord that raised christ from the grave i am the one that sent the holy ghost i am the one that give the promise brother branham has nothing to do in this i he surrendered his life to me i'm using his spirit and i'm talking through his lips that's me i am the lord i say glory i got it god speaking through that vessel god speaking to his people god getting your people ready there is indeed a man here that can turn on the light don't fear little sister don't feel her fear little sister see this little girl standing there screaming the top of her voice going into high sterics so that's like the bride but you know what her little brother cried out little pride don't fear because he's standing right by he's the engineer there is a man here not there here that can turn on the light when you got the revelation of this message your light went on and you can say i got it brother tom i got it why i've come from god i go back to god i came from eternity i go back to eternity i am an eternal being this is the age brother braham said a personal life of christ come on brother erickson was saying that at the very beginning of his service he said it's christ in the body it's christ in the body it's christ in you the hope of glory it's no longer i that live but christ liveth in me this is the age brother ram said how can i overcome this is the age of life the personal life of christ where the chemical of his body what was in him this jesus now listen he says the water age blood age now it's token age of the holy ghost and the message thirst but the holy ghost itself has brought the person of jesus to you he came to me not a song a revelation he came to me the person of jesus the one that met that woman at the well who she said i got it when the messiah cometh i that speak to thee am he you're no different you came to this fountain that was opened up in the house of david it was opened up and you've been drinking and there's a man here that can turn on the light which is the person of jesus christ himself and when the messiah comes i that speak to thee i know i'll leave it there that's for another service okay i that speak to thee and he and upon this rock i'll build my church now you that have been predestinated unto this inheritance everybody say amen i am predestinated unto this grand inheritance if i am a right inheritance of something and if god is knocking at my heart saying william branham i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world from eternity i called you a long time ago before the nation of the world to preach this gospel i have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life now listen what the prophet said now god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me come on put your name there i want you to put your name there then god from eternity sent this jesus to make your inheritance real to you real to me well here you go now i wish i had a lot of money but i don't have any so there you go but if i had a million bucks i would say hmm somebody in the back row would beat somebody here now i don't know i don't know i'm just holding a million dollars out right it's a winning ticket not one of you be sitting in your seat brian would be scrambling over about four rows because he's so tall and long-legged you'd do anything i said it's free for anybody it's free for anybody and yet the gospel is free for anybody and we got more than a million bucks we got a city made of pure gold huh we'll live for eternity forever and ever but god sent this message which is christ to make this inheritance real to you so you can say i got that brother tom jesus came to me and made this message real to me because brother i'm saying i took his message this message it's christ it's not just a message another church this message is christ can you put up with five more minutes behold i send you a mystery we shall not all sleep tom you're preaching way too long right now just give me five more minutes okay we'll get you into bed behold i show you a mystery amen in a moment he said i'll show you this we shall not all sleep but we shall all i love it oh doesn't mean anybody out here we should all be changed in a moment i want you to hold on to that word moment because we've been talking about time in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trump shall sound and the dead shall rise incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought the past the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory oh how sweet that is that's like honey honey falling down from heaven now that moment is an interesting word in a moment in the space of time because time's going to go into eternity but in a moment it's chaos which is a greek word and that's about all you need to think about like thomas some scholar no i just looked up the word keros it means flash or it means to make a puncture or a mark with a hot iron what that does in that moment it means a recognition of ownership so only those that are owned by god get changed in a moment it means a moment in an instant in an infinitesimal small moment of time god has already marked you out it's not that i'm going to be changed in the moment no you're already marked out for that moment you've already come from eternity for that moment because there's going to be a people that defeat death and you are that people [Applause] you've been marked marked marked by the holy ghost himself hallelujah think about it look it up you can preach now on a whole message i got a whole 11 pages left here i know you're shaking but i won't go there but he said in a moment congressman upshaw because he'd been marked marked he was changed in a k ross a moment got out of his chair after 66 years one glad morning when this life is over this flesh will fly away in a chaos in a moment because i marked your mark for this event we're not living luther's age we're not living wesley's age we're not living pentecostal he said token hate broad age the end of time age this is your age i got it amen hallelujah are you ready someday the great king of these spirits will come jesus come from glory in his body amen he'll turn loose the power of god oh i'm waiting for that moment yes sir and every person that's in him think about it every person that's in him their bodies their atoms will start going together cosmic light will start taking place start making up and in a moment time here's a prophet taking a greek word in a moment of time every person that is in christ will be changed and made young again standing on this earth hallelujah think of it never to get old never to get sick never to have a heartache never to have a worry never to have depression never to have anything but to glorify almighty god to god be the glory hallelujah never sick never depressed no worries no worries oh have you been marked have you been marked by the holy ghost himself he sent jesus he sent this message to you to make your inheritance real my inheritance is a change in the body [Music] not to come to church even though i love you people and brother brother erickson has a lovely church and lively body of christ we didn't come for that we came to hear the word to get our change not to tell you how smart we are how many quotes we can quote how much scripture we know that has nothing to know jesus said jesus or the scripture says which is jesus the word to know him is life eternal the person called jesus christ why did brother brown use the term end of time for a message junction of time time is at hand father the hour has now come time tested memorials sign of the time time tested faith time of decision end time seed sign end time evangelism scriptural signs of the time why was he nailing time because time will be no more huh everybody's so time conscious see i got an amen on that one why we're at the end time we're at the finish time but it's the time saints of god to claim your inheritance in christ jesus it's get away from playing church that's why he said if god before us where's all his miracles and and keep trying to preach and preach and preach and letting us know that's the time to halt play in church he said now the king of glory is amongst his people can you imagine i just don't know brother eriksen what i would do i just asked the brothers the other day we're sitting around having a little bite to eat brother wayne and i just they're just talking and i said can you imagine brother brahm said now the angel of lords he's right here knowing what you know right now it would be you'd be running for not a million dollars you'd be running to the altar where are you jesus i don't think one of us would just be waiting for him to tell us what we are i said lord you're standing right there i don't know why there wasn't a pile up at the pulpit but that's me being carnal because as soon as you come he'll probably wave over that sister dear that has a problem i love this little story at the end here and this is just showing you that time is going to be swallowed up death swallowed up sickness swallowed up he said there was a person she'd come but i looked around i looked around now he's going into another world he said i looked around i saw a doctor well there wasn't a doctor on the platform so now he's broken into another realm he said i see a doctor he's wearing tortoise shell glasses he had one of those like whatever it was called wears on on his head to see down your throat he's discouraged he was shaking his head it's a thin doctor he's shaking his head he just performed the operation on a little colored girl paralyzed her she's paralyzed from the shoulders down can you imagine what kind of a ministry did god send us in this generation and a lot of times people just you know you know the first parts of the message are as profound as what's in the middle of the message and the end of the message is profound is what's in the middle you know people i just skipped the prayer line right what are you thinking that was god coming vindicating now what the word was saying so now here's god coming down brother branham doesn't see a doctor with tortoise shell glasses he's standing here so now he looks forward and he says now he said i turned my back around and i said to my brother bring the next patient bring the next patient now he's broke out of that realm and he's back into this round and then way way back way back i heard someone crying and i looked and here come a hospital stretcher like those along here and an old color lady crawling on her hands and knees screaming god be merciful to me and i looked and there was a little colored girl in the vision and the mother crying lordy mercy she said and this little color girl that i've seen in the vision she the mother says parson will god let my baby live and brother brandon didn't even know it was that little girl and brother brown goes on to say he says i said andy i don't know i can only speak what i see she said oh god have mercy have mercy she kept crying the little thing's paralyzed it's been about two years hasn't it auntie she said yes that's been about two years sir he turned around and called the patient and i looked and i'd seen something now in front of me i seen something materializing it looked like a road but it was a street and going down the street went the
