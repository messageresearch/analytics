read about a a wise virgin over in Matthew 25 that were ready amen and they the prophet of God said I believe he's close enough right now that I could say go out and meet him Amen to go out and meet him amen and I believe that's where we are today amen I want to say God bless you it's certainly good to be at the house of the Lord on Thursday night and to see the place nearly full amen what a what a spirit of Grace and and mercy the Lord is showing us Amen to right in the middle of all this crazy Co and politics and people still got it in their heart to be in the house of the Lord amen I tell you I believe it's talking about a people that's ready amen amen I I just want to say I I I appreciate your resilience Amen to fight back against the coldness of the age amen and to be a part of that amen ready church amen we want to thank the Lord tonight for his Mercy want to Bow our hearts for a word of prayer and let's just pray together father we are certainly privileged and honored to be here among your children to be accounted a part of them Lord and to be able to speak to Lord what we deem to be the most precious thing there is on the earth it is your children Lord I know that you

your your presence among us we thank you Father now we pray in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and God bless you tonight and if we could we just want to turn into the book of uh 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and uh I want to take here for a reading tonight from 1 Corinthians 14 and we want to read from the uh the eth verse again just a little something here in our heart and I I I'm praying about maybe going a certain direction and and I I believe the Lord just kind of leading uh me personally in my studies just leading me across something here tonight I just want to share with you in 1 Corinthians 14 and in the eth verse for if the trumpet would give an uncertain sound who should prepare himself to the battle amen God bless you as you be seated tonight amen uh I just spoke a little bit to you on Sunday from a thought of a positive gospel a positive gospel and I want to speak a little bit further on that tonight and I I just want to maybe take this title that a positive gospel produces a positive experience a positive gospel produces a positive experience I want a positive experience amen I I like things that are positive amen I love I love the things that are true and the things that are real I'm I'm I I just want to maybe reiterate something here from the word positive just in the English dictionary of the Webster there it says fully confident certain it means I'm positive I win it means having a real or beneficient effect or result they took a positive action I have a positive experience it means Beyond doubt it means unquestionable it means a positive proof it means showing acceptance or approval it's a positive response brother Bam from the message of trumpet gives an uncertain sound he says this I'm trying to tell you the things of the earth is shaken and you can't put any confidence in them they're uncertain and anything that's uncertain I'd rather leave away from it I don't like the negative thing I don't like to get mixed up in the negative side I like it positive to be on the positive side amen that's exactly where I want to be all the time is on the positive side I believe a Christian is positive I I believe that's what his whole life is about is being positive Amen brother brandom actually says that Christianity has no negative nothing in it everything is absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of God has a positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has a positive hold on him with the Assurance by the almighty God by an oath to himself that he will raise him up in the last day and and take to him to Glory there's uh no if or and or nothing it's something that's positive Amen brother B again Jehovah Gyra said Christianity has been misrepresented to people Christianity has been represented as a declaration of creed but Christianity is a living being it's a Jesus Christ the resurrected God that's alive Among Us now I really enjoyed that quote I wanted to read it again Jesus Christ amen Christianity is a living being I'd like to just preach a week on that Christianity is a living being it's not form or religion it's not denomination or Creed it's not theology it's a living being that's why the thing that we're doing it's something that's actually alive in us it's something that is living and it's feeding on the word of God Amen Christianity is a living being in mankind that's a proof of the resurrection of God's son who was God With Us amen and and uh hear ye him brother said that's the way real Christianity is a living experience and I I think that's amazing a positive gospel produces a positive experience amen Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience that anybody can have if they wish to have it if something that you experience it's the Holy Spirit I'll tell you what I I than the Lord tonight amen to be a part of a group amen that really believes in the experience of the Holy Ghost that believes in the the moving of the Holy Spirit and amen I I appreciate last Sunday amen we had the youth had a meeting after our meeting and and uh I heard that the spirit of God just come and amened and sanctioned that service and amen what a wonderful blessing I I tell you something I'm I appreciate brother Nathan brother Ronnie and all the people that uh that are involved in these youth meetings and they're preaching them and they're praying and the sacrifice of you mothers and fathers to to bring your children or make sure they get here and all the musicians and their Sunday evenings God bless you for what you're doing these are Eternal things that we're talking about amen and and to think amen that these things were not just a not just a little flyby but I I tell you a lot of the young people come to my house afterwards and we had a couple pizzas and things and we were all sitting around there and it turned out about midnight and still no Ronnie no Isaac and couldn't they couldn't figure out where they were and all finally I said hey look guys man there's a revival going on them boys is up there in the altar praying it's Amen that that's not old news I remember when I first got saved it wasn't no big deal at all to be 1:00 2:00 in the morning up there at the house of God shouting and dancing and snotting and rejoicing and I tell you you can get something that'll stick with you longer than just a a couple days or just a little something amen amen but I think it was long about 6:00 in the morning before they before they got out out of that anointing I think somebody said Sister Mary come up and was going to touch Isaac or something and the spirit got on her and she got out in the that's just what they told me now is that the truth sister Mary amen I tell you you got to watch her now she's a holy ghost woman she get somewhere around it and she's she just gets connected to it amen amen and and I I I heard that the spirit of God was being poured out like that and then and and little did we know uh we got to have supper with the Kegley family last night and sister Mariah was telling us how the Lord had give her the Holy Ghost right in the middle of that meeting amen do you know uh uh did anybody else receive the holy ghost in that meeting did anybody else just throw your hand up now don't be ashamed of did anybody else get the Holy Ghost did anybody else get a refilling of the Holy Ghost on last Sunday amen look at these Hearts amen amen people were getting there was somebody back there Bond tracker wasn't it God bless you sis amen receive the Holy Ghost on Sunday night listen that one soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen do you recognize the prophet of God said Billy Graham would go into a community and win 30,000 and come back and couldn't find one he said but Paul on the other hand took his converts Beyond just a a confession or just a decision and he said Paul would convert one and come back and find 30 or 30,000 amen because it's a real conversion it's something that don't turn it don't back away it's more than just a decision or or just a little made up their mind but it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost something that that changes the soul amen amen I'm convinced amen that there is a a power in this gospel I'm convinced there's a life Chang in power amen I'm one that believes in a positive gospel amen that somebody that is certain that it works preaches the certainty of the Gospel that there's a power of the Resurrection behind that and it is a lifechanging experience coming to the Church of the Living God is not just coming to hear a little lesson or a teaching it ought to be a positive experience it ought to be life changing amen I believe people can come inside the gates of the Church of the Living God and walk out and be Eternal creatures and and never look back and I I believe that I believe that change can happen in the middle of a service I'm just speaking last night for Bible Believers and and God just put it on my heart I just contined with positive gospel but I was speaking for brother Jonathan last night in the middle of it brother brother Ed quinland was sitting there and he said he was sitting there with so much back pain and he said all of a sudden he began to say Amen instead of saying Lord Heal my back pain Lord Heal my back pain he said right in the middle of that of because I was preaching a positive God El amen it's already here and he said right in the middle of it he said I just begin to say Lord I Thank you for my healing amen I thank you for my healing and he said right when I begin to praise God for my healing the back pain left me can can I can I say something to you tonight this is a positive gospel this ain't coming it's already here your blessing's not coming it's already here listen to me your salvation's not coming it's already here the Holy Ghost is not on the way the Holy Ghost is right here in this building tonight there is a way tonight that a Believer can break beyond the Realms of humanity and experience a living God Amen oh to think tonight that we don't have to be satisfied on a denominational fountain or or the Fountain of Creeds amen but we can hook up to elshad and we can draw from the breast of the word of God eternal life will flow right down into that body back pain leaving right in the middle of a church service I I tell you I'm talking about experience tonight amen I remember preaching this same gospel not too many years ago and a person was sitting there with cancer right in the middle of the meeting and jumped up and said I got to testify I come in this meeting with cancer but it just fell off of me I am completely healed do you know you're living in a season when God Amen don't have to heal cancer but it's already healed amen that that the healing power is Flowing from Calvary amen that 2,000 years ago I hear Jesus Christ scream it is finished your healing is finished youen your deliverance is finished every spell is broken Every curse is broken every disease is been destroyed amen then the only thing we need to do today is open up our hearts and receive the blessings of God that has already been given I don't care how many Devils says it ain't true I'll be standing ending on the word of God when this whole world falls apart amen because it's exactly a positive word for a positive experience amen we're not here tonight on Hope Souls than Souls baby Souls amen but there has been something that we're certain we're certain about what it is now I I I'm very I'm very aware that we're intellectual people and and we we can read and write and learn and and thank God we do because amen we got we got Geniuses and doctors and nurses and scientists and electricians and engineers and we put amen and thank God for for the natural world those things are wonderful but when it comes to the things of God those things are useless amen and and we've recognized a long time ago that we can quickly reach the summit of intellectualism and man cannot climb Beyond his own understanding but according to the Bible he said if you will not lean to your own understanding amen that God is ask asking somebody to step out beyond the understanding beyond what they can think or they can imagine do you know that you're serving a god tonight that can do things that you can't even imagine that he can do things above what you can think or ask you can't even ask as high as what God is able to do you can't even imagine what God is able to do amen I don't know what God is going to do for you but he said Abraham I have already blessed you amen and the the blessings of God are already on the Church of the Living God I don't know about you but I'm just ready to say I don't understand it but by the grace of God there is something in me that believes it no matter what I see no matter what I taste no matter what I feel I still just believe it anyhow my goodness amen and we might look like a bunch of fellas out here just a bunch of fanatics but we're not amen and I don't say that trying to save myself I'm trying to say there's a middle of the road somewhere amen and that middle of the road amen is not Co formal and lukewarm it's not just that formalism of of just reading a little and saying amen and singing two songs and going home the middle of the road or the balance is the word of God Amen and I can show you by the word of God that the church can have an acts to experience they can have an upper room experience matter of fact Peter promised this to every man that God calls you can have the same experience of a Bible Holy Ghost just like they had in the upper room I am not a fanatic I am not a crazy man I am a believer I am a butd bought Bible believing Christian a son of the Living God if you want to say it I'm a tongue talking Blood Washed baptized Holy Ghost filled son of the Living God I'm not giving up I'm not turning around I'm not going to lay myself down in the presence of a devil I'm not bow my knee to formalism I'm not bound my knee to the ways of man but by the grace of God I will preach a positive gospel until every Son of God is filled with the Holy Ghost every daughter and every child has a place and an experience for God so brother Wayne you ain't deep enough you don't tell what you get after a while you get so deep you get in a rut and you know what a rut is it's just a grave amen and that's why the prophet said twofold more child of hell that's what they made him he said twice dead and plucked up he said dead amen the the th themometer has went below zero he said with every degree you got colder colder with every degree with every intellectual sermon you got more arrogant more stiff necked amen more entitled more amen you got to have me you got to believe me amen but look at what the power of the Holy Ghost will do it'll take a man like Simon Peter amen and humble him to the place that he was ready to be hung upside down for the experience of God and let me tell you tonight I believe there's some people alive that still believes that the same Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever amen and if we're preaching something different than Paul preached there's something wrong with what we're preaching now we might as well just get straight haven't we we're Believers right amen that's why the young people are going back to the world that's why the young people are going back to the world even while they're in the church they might be in the church but they're really in the world and it's actually just setting in the church but really their hearts is in the world I tell you why because the world offers something amen that's a pull upon their flesh well I pray to God tonight that the church has a greater draw than the world I pray that there's a fire of the Holy Ghost had will pull the young people into the places of altars I actually had a down minister in this message tell me one day brother Wayne we don't want you people to pull the people to an altar we want you to tell them what you know how I tell you this I tell you what I know I know that nothing will change a man's heart but the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can't talk a man out of sin I can't preach a man out of sin but if I can get that man in contact with the Creator he'll change his nature and you'll never be the same again every child every daughter every man needs experience with the Holy Ghost and without that experience there'll be no Rapture there'll be no faith there'll be no Revival glory be to God that's why so many young people brother bam said that's why there's no move CU there's nothing to put Sparks on he said there's there's a of course there's a train but no movement a car but no movement because a a movement needs both gas and and the spark now that word is gasoline isn't it that's what the prophet said and he said now if it don't if it don't do nothing but sputter maybe it's not gasoline and some of these great teachers that we have in this message had put the fires of God out they've not moved the message further amen they ground it down and made it a negative experience and they made it where you leave church more beat down than when you come in you feel more legal and law and you feel less and less amen but something somewhere has got to energize the inner soul of a man to make him know that this body is a lie this world is a lie but there's something in me amen the real me come from God to begin with and there's only one thing that can make that connection one thing can make that connection between you and God my teaching ain't going to do it friend I'm I'm I'm sorry amen I I hope to say I'm a good teacher and I believe in Bible teaching amen but I know the only thing make the connection to you is the spirit of God you know the brother B said that's a positive and this is a negative this life we're living is a negative and that life is a positive is that right amen now I'm just a dumb old hillbilly and I just got simple ways but if I go out in my in my yard and there's an old battery been laying believe me in Arkansas probably had some of them two or three years I tried to clean it up here in a while a little bit amen but I I had some old batteries just to fit in my neighborhood good had a couple old batteries laying around and you get out there and want to put one of them on your bow or on your truck amen and you wonder amen is that thing got any life in it is that thing got any charge now the only way to find that out young people is you got to have you go get your metal bar simple way to do it get a metal bar and put it on the negative and then touch it on the positive now don't try it on your daddy's truck though but and you put it on the negative and touch it on the positive now if you can put both of them together at the same time if you can touch both at the same time you know what I'm going to say there's a there's a charge there there's a spark there's a spark of Dynamics there there is something that comes back to you that there's life in there now the denominational message a theological message does not have the ability to touch this realm and that realm at the same time the their their stick is too short it cannot carry the current amen but the message of the hour has brought us a holy ghost anointing that can reach from this realm to the other realm at the same time it's so far that a prophet of God said when you recognize this word to be Eagle food you have heard from your theophany amen why is it that the people are begin to rejoice in the middle of a church why AR people shout and holler and scream and rejoice is all that really necessary well I tell you what a prophet said he said when you see all that going on what's really happening is there's an unseen Force these me if somebody if something's happening there's something making it happen now you tell me if that's the devil or God I'll tell you what brother random said it was he said the person has bumped into an angel amen and something is charging them amen maybe it is amen I maybe they throw me out the message from my theology but I believe this I believe we got a theophany right now I don't believe God's going to make one I believe we got one waiting right now and I believe once in a while and we come in the house of God and the word by the spirit connects us to that the offering for just a moment and we charge amen there's a dynamic blast in the Church of the Living God that's why somebody wants to shout a little bit that's why somebody wants to run the pews a little bit because they got a charge in the Dynamics and it falls on gasoline amen by now I've been I've been involved in enough meetings you let a little fire start and you you got some some Theologian will get up there and he'll just keep calming it all down till he gets everybody in the seat get every bit of that killed out make sure nobody gets no Wildfire well I tell you amen as a Spire a chance of it among most people amen because every time there's a little spark they pour water on it amen but I'm going to tell you what there is some fire amen and that fire I I have testified I got to testify there's a fire in this church I don't care if I'm a part of it or not if I was on the outside looking in I would have to testify them people got a fire up there amen then if there's a fire in here amen then God helped me to pour some gasoline on the fire of God rather than pouring a bunch of water and a bunch of legalism and a bunch of ideas of man God help us to Fan the Flames of the baptism of the Holy Ghost until it catches and blows across the Church of the Living God I feel the Winds of God from the fire of God the Winds of Change The Winds of Promise The Winds of [Music] anointing you might think I'm crazy but I'm not no sir I'll tell you what happens is there's a move going on right now there's actually a move and I'll tell you what the move is it's moving from your head to your heart all them things you have heard about all them promises you've read about all them quotes that you've read all them scriptures that you've heard about at this season there is something that is moving it from the head down to the heart can I say this the move is on the word is moving into the heart of the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not trying to put you under pressure to shout I'm not trying to put you under pressure to act a certain way I'm trying to give you Liberty I'm trying to tell you that if it's in your heart Amen to rejoice and enjoy God and experience the the holy ghost that this promise is unto you and unto your children amen you can have the blessings of God I tell you Paul Razer said it well I'm riding on it amen we're not trying to produce it we're not trying to manufactur it we're riding on the promises that God has gave the church are you hearing me amen your name is Rebecca right your name is Rebecca amen what was Rebecca doing after elaser left her she got on a camel and that Camel was taking her to her Isaac let me tell you something tonight there's some people that is riding the camel amen of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the power that is moving the [Applause] church now what's the beaut what's the beauty of that something's moving us something's something we're riding something it's not a National Force now amen it's not a National Force but look at that look at how rigid we can become now watch this look how rigid we can become we can get stiff in our we can get stiff in our experience until even the way I just said that about Rebecca riding that Camel will bring up a theological critic right in the middle of the church and I can pick their Spirit up right when they do it amen and usually I don't call them out but I want you to know you'll never have a Revival with that Spirit on you you'll be cold and you'll be critic and you'll be a jealous man the rest of your life but if you could ever turn a loose of that critical spirit and let the Holy Ghost begin to deal with you you would know that there's a power in this building right now that's beyond the ideas of just a theology there's an anointing that'll change your [Applause] life glory to God don't worry I won't call their name amen glory to God Amen look there's a positive thinking there's a positive experience there's a positive way there's something positive that will cause you to change it'll cause a change in you you don't have to stay that way you don't have to stay all all dry and and in a place where you can't be moved by the spirit where the God can't deal with you brother B said the basis of a Revival is flexibility and he said the flexibility was the new wine he said watch how that you can't put new wine in old bottle he said why because they're animal skins and animal skins dry out unless you oil them up good and what we need amen is a baptism in the all of God to make us loose again to make us movable [Music] again hallelujah hallelujah you know you can go to a place right now where you can dwell in a positive realm amen you can go into a realm Beyond negative Thinking Beyond negative things you can go in a realm where all things are possible where all things are certain where all things are a reality in Romans the 12th chapter Paul actually said be you transformed by the renewing of your mind he wasn't intellectually speaking he was speaking about a change of the mind that went deeper than the change of the way you think it went into the mind of God who he said be renewed in the spirit of your mind it's beautiful that Paul says in Philippians 2 to let us and Amen to let the mind of Christ come into us now that's a that's a surrender word let it means you got to let it happen you got to actually open your heart and let it happen he said I stand at the door and knock and if any man would open up it's Jesus standing there knocking at his own house amen I I don't know how long you're going to let him knock how long you're going to let him stand there amen how long you going to leave him and Le de sea with no drink with no cool drink water from the presence of God Amen but I'll tell you this somebody's going to let it happen somebody's going to open up their heart somebody's going to say Come Into My Heart Lord amen watch that same mind now that same mind that was in Christ is being poured into the church he said riding to every man every individual that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same creator that was in heaven amen that created the earth created the man is right in every individual that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what he says in the seven seal he says when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ I think brother Ray took a whole whole whole series on that back a few years ago amen when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ amen it's it's not it's not it's not thinking it's the supernatural because it's so far away from the way we think as humans amen watch this a supernatural atmosphere amen look at this the supernatural comes in and the supernatural Works in an atmosphere do you know that the atmosphere you're in is of the greatest effect upon the church service that the greatest thing that can happen in church is atmosphere that's why we pray for our song leader that's why we pray for our musicians that's why we come to church a little early and begin to pray and get in and and we just move along with the service amen amen and and and rather than feeling resistant against the way he feels LED get in and let the spirit begin to lead the song service let the angel of the Lord begin to come over and hover over the church what's going on in atmosphere amen is being created amen y'all know that we can't help a little chicken pick out of the egg we done establish that but we can create an atmosphere that'll keep them alive till they get out of the egg we can create an atmosphere in the church until a young person can feel the possession even inside the shell something that's telling it just keep moving little fella and you'll come out before long now that human part amen that human part that human part is where our troubles are now I I know this I know this without a sh of a doubt amen I'm I'm my biggest enemy and you're your biggest enemy brother Ram said he was his biggest enemy so the biggest enemy I got in the church is me the biggest enemy I got in the world is me do you know if I could just get me out of the way that God could live amen unhindered if I could just get me out of the way God could preach unhindered if I could just get me out of the way do you see amen then there's a human part that's you that's the human part but there's a deity part in there that's the supernatural God that's been poured in there that wants an expression but your human part gets in the way because you're looking at the thing and you're looking at the trials and you're looking at the struggles and you're looking at the problems but by doing that you're grounding out the positive where that it cannot reflect through your life amen but what we really need is a letting go we really need a Divine surrender Amen to the place of letting flow through US everything that God has GI to us as a church amen I'll tell you this you can come in a supernatural atmosphere there in the church is a supernatural element there is the supernatural mind of God amen and all of this is happening to give us a positive Faith amen isn't it beautiful to have real faith not just to I felt good in the service or or something swept over me and I think things are better amen but a real Dynamic change something that moved you from Hope to Faith something that moved you from being a quote in your mind to something that you would give your life for something that moves into your heart brother bandam says it like this he said so we want to change from Hope today to positive Faith there's only one way we can get positive Faith that's by positive thinking of positive things now a positive thinking watch oh my because now you're getting into the intellectual think positive think positive think positive but William Brandon was not talking about that kind of positive thinking a true positive thought is a supernatural element of God that places the mind of God in you amen where did Moses ever get the idea to part the Red Sea by the spoken word he didn't get that out of a human mind amen but God placed that in his mind where did William brandom get the idea of creating squirrels he didn't come out of his mind but God placed it in his mind then the supernatural Mind Of God is a positive thought do you see that it's a certain thought it's not a thought of uncertainty it's a positive thought it's a positive Faith amen now watch this so we want to change amen don't let that don't let that negative thing I talked about don't let it hang on the church and you say well by the way you was talking to me just repent of it then and just move on don't don't let it hang on you now that's what I'm talking about you let a negative carry you Amen to where it brings you below the atmosphere where eagles are supposed to soar amen so when you identify that the spirit amen rebukes something you're thinking then you just say hey repent of that and then let the spirit move you amen if if if a man is preaching and you're doing something wrong in the middle of the service and he calls out maybe he don't even know what he's talking about he just says something about something you're doing amen watch how that'll affect you in the middle of a service it'll pull you down down cuz you're identifying with that but you got to quit identifying with the negative amen and that's what the blood is for you got to say yeah I did it but God I'm sorry I did it now let me ask you how long does it take take God to forgive you brother brandom says the moment in your heart that you said I'm sorry that's when God forgave you do you know right now you could say oh God don't never let me think that way again amen and the Holy Ghost can burn that out of your [Applause] life it's a

it's at it's had an experience amen a faith that can shut up the symptoms has had an experience with God a faith can shut up the devil has had an experience with God you're not hoping you're not

to you who do you think you are to tell me to leave my home and I'll tell every one of them I'm a blood bought Son of God Amen my sins were paid for that day at Calvary amen and right there because you know what one day I was driving in my little truck and I was down Amen in them old country bottoms along that Black River and I had my old dog in the back and I was listening to a tape of a prophet I don't know what happened I can't explain it but something very positive happened because for just a split second I was actually standing at the foot of the cross amen 2,000 years ago amen I I can't explain that but it was as real as I'm standing right here and I seen the blood coming from that body and within a minute I knew that blood was for me listen to me I don't know who all he died for but I know he died for me I know that he BL for my sins and because of that experience I can stand in the face of any devil of any situation that I've ever been in and said my sins have been covered that placed under the blood I'm not here on my own reputation I'm not preaching on my own reputation I am standing under the blood Banner of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm speaking to you from another realm I'm speaking to you from another world not the world of Wayne Lawson and the negative life and the childhood and the troubles and the abuse and the problems I'm speaking to you from that day on Calvary when Christ came into my heart y'all got to forgive me I feel an inspiration in this building I think I could climb up right now into a realm where all things faith is a positive experience you don't have to let that devil bully you anymore you don't have to let that thing just keep taking your Victory you've got a right tonight to say Satan I'm a blood bought child of God what do you have anything to do with me it's not my imagination I'm not imagining Devils leaving people's lives I'm not imagining people getting the Holy Ghost and changing I'm not imagining that for a 40 minute sermon entire churches are changed entire lives are changed Wayne Lawson can't do that my intell Ence can't do that there's something else going on there's a God that raised from the dead and his name is Jesus Christ and he's here in the building tonight saving and Sanctified and filling with the Holy Ghost you might call me crazy but brother one of these days oh the bombs of Russia are going to fall on this United States but this child of God will be setting in glory oh what am I talking about I'm talking about a revival going on in this church and somebody should pour some gasoline on the Treasures of the Holy Ghost falling there's a thousand churches tonight that wish this anointing was in their midst they wish the children of God were falling under the anointing of God but by Grace God has chosen you from the foundation of the world to be a part of a holy ghost anointing there not be an end to this there are people in this building tonight that is receiving things that we will talk about up in glory [Music] someday this is that which Jo prophesied anden it's shall come to pass in the latter days I will pour out my spirit amen upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters amen shall prophesy and your young men receive visions and your old men shall dream dreams this day this scripture is being poured Out Among the Church of the Living God Amen not just for to make a racket not just to make a noise but to redeem and to restore and to save and to baptize and to move in the power of [Music] God oh brother Wayne but you people so you people so crazy we're not crazy the misunderstanding comes in experience it comes an experience you know what happened amen the prophet said they got to use an experience for measuring line amen they got to use it a measure line of experience so they quit in the word and didn't go far enough to the Holy Ghost amen but there are some people amen that won't just quit amen with an emotion or just a tingling or just a feeling amen what you're experiencing right now is not a bunch of emotionalism but Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed there were many that believed and they thought that was the experience that God was going to give them they thought oh if we believe that's the greatest experience but a prophet said you've stopped too short you stopped in believing but Paul said after that you believed have you received the baptism the indement of power the power of God the experience of God do you recognize tonight there are people that's actually ashamed of this do you know what the prophet of God said don't be ashamed of it it's the word of God made flesh you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying you're having a word experience right now amen I read it this morning a prophet of God said you're having a word experience I thought I was going to shout out of my office brother Aiden amen he said you're having a word experience and I said yeah a true word experience and here I am tonight preaching in a true word Tabernacle and she's having a true word experience amen Beyond just believing it anybody can believe it the Devils believe it everybody believes it but there's somebody that's going to experience the reality of a positive faith that comes from the anointing of God Amen we are not playing games we are not having emotional breakdowns we are found ourselves in the middle of the power of the Holy Ghost they men that fell on the day of Pentecost come on Church somebody going to cross over this Jordan somebody's going to go over this Jordan somebody's going to go on over somebody's going to say I'm done with a powerless life I'm done with a halfway religion I'm done with theologies and doctrines I'm tired I'm tired of the circle that religion has brought me into I'm ready to go over into the Eternal land of the baptism of the spirit of God where I can experience every blessing and every promise that God has made for my life I am not reading from an almanac I'm reading from a prophet of God that said that the baptism of the spirit of God is a definite experience and a man cannot receive the Holy Ghost without an experience brother bam do our young people need the Holy Ghost do our young people need the Holy Ghost brother bam said it's the only way they can be a Son of God and God don't have any grandchildren so if they're going to be saved they've got to have the Holy Ghost it's God's only way of doing it you can call me a Pentecostal but Peter was a Pentecostal and Paul was a Pentecostal and William Brandon was a Pentecostal not by organization by the experience of God that brother Brandon called it an eagle experience did you know that he said you're not a chicken you're an eagle he said you've had an eagle experience of a Pentecostal experience that's why he said a weed age a Pentecostal experience oh I know they've hung up on calling it shuck will brandom called it a weed age William brandom called it a weed anointing an eagle anointing it was a baptism of the spirit and let me tell you something right now that spirit is right here right now it's in this building right now to fill your heart Amen to take away all the all the oh God y'all give me some Grace amen all that confusion amen you know what I'm talking about all those voices rattling around your head wondering which way to go and what go I'm not Discerning amen I'm preaching the word of God and the word is a discerner and this man needs the Holy Ghost to come and wash his mind and wash his spirit amen I know that comes from God Amen that same spirit is in here tonight I'm not trying to imitate a prophet the word itself is a discerner when you preach the gospel it should do more then tickle your ears in order to turn your heart over and say God I can't stop till I get it I can't quit till I get it I got to have it Lord I got to feel it I got to be filled ah people don't want to be identified with this world don't want to be identified with this but brother B said I'm glad to be identified with the people that feel I'm glad to be identified with Ry ericon God bless you buddy I'm glad to be identified with a man that can feel the anointing and recogn I it when he's in the presence of it I'm glad to be a part of a man that can preach the Bible with an experience that can change hearts and change lives amen this don't just happen somebody has to build this somebody has to prep this somebody has to put the people in a trained position that when the Dynamics of God comes they don't push it away they embrace it amen and tonight we have heard the sound of the [Applause] trumpet [Applause] I don't want no more chicken experiences I was not born for it I was not birthed for it and I will die in that atmosphere but there is an atmosphere I was born to live in there was one where the anointing comes by and picks me up above who I am that when that comes up and picks me up to the person that's down inside my being that one that can say Amen to every word that one that can back every promise listen tonight friends this is a reality it's a positive experience won't you come tonight won't the musicians come tonight this is a positive experience it's not an uncertain one this is not an uncertain experience this is a positive one don't you know that you're supposed to know that you know that you know with without of Doubt what that is now why why would a prophet say that you need to know that you know do you know the way brother Ram said this he said you actually need to come out on the sacred Sands of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know most people when they refer to the Holy Ghost mean it something bad about it they refer to it in a negative condentation but brother Bram said it was called The Sacred Sands and if you come out on those sacred Sands Brother David no Theologian now I want you to go back and study the message what brother Bram said he said the devil cannot step on those sacred Sands he cannot step on those sacred Sands I want you to watch what he saying he's saying no Theologian go back and look what he says no Theologian no doctor no psychologist no devil he he lumps theologies psychologies Devils every one of them he said if you ever get in that sacred sand they will never explain it away now who's trying to explain away the Holy Ghost it's the devil and he's doing it the theologians and psychologists and every kind of teacher and they're trying to explain that way and brother Ram said what they're doing is it's their unbelief it's their unbelief and they're making an excuse for their unbelief and they're bypassing the Holy Ghost amen but it's a sacred sand tonight amen that you can come to a place that nobody can explain that away from you nobody I think we pray God tonight tonight that every heart every heart Ben you got something if you don't if you [Music] do [Music] hallu glory and the LIF of my head you're my glory and the LIF of my [Music] head for that now oh Lord our she for [Music] me you're my glory and the lifter of my [Music] hand
