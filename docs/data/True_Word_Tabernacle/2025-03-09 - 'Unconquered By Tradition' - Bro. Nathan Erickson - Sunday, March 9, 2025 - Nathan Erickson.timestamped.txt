[4:42] room amen for for us to put our shoulder
[4:45] behind the wheel it's all we want to be
[4:47] is a help to help move the great load
[4:51] amen let's go to the word of God
[4:55] today Mark chapter 7
[5:10] thank you
[5:13] Jesus Mark chapter 7 and verse
[5:18] 5 we know the story of
[5:23] Jesus how the the Pharisees came to
[5:25] resent him because he and his disciples
[5:27] would act in a
[5:30] in an untraditional or in their minds an
[5:33] inappropriate
[5:34] way and so the Pharisees and scribes
[5:37] asked him why not why walk not thy
[5:39] disciples according to the tradition of
[5:42] the
[5:43] elders but they eat bread with unwash in
[5:46] hands he answered and said unto them
[5:48] well hath Isaiah prophesied of you
[5:51] Hypocrites as it is written this people
[5:53] honth me with their
[5:55] lips but their heart is far from me how
[6:00] be it in vain do they worship me
[6:02] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[6:04] of men for laying aside the Commandment
[6:06] of God you hold the tradition of men the
[6:09] washing of pots and cups and many other
[6:11] such like things you do and I I'll skip
[6:14] over it for the sake of time but the
[6:16] example Christ would use about this
[6:17] Corban it's quite a amazing study if
[6:19] you'd like to take that on your own time
[6:21] but just to take verse 13 He said you're
[6:24] making the word of God of none effect
[6:27] through your tradition which you have
[6:30] delivered and many such like things do
[6:33] ye I I would like to preach this morning
[6:35] a message titled unconquered by
[6:38] Traditions let's just go to him in
[6:41] prayer and how many as you approach him
[6:44] you'd want to come the Lord with a
[6:46] desire this morning say
[6:47] Lord as this meeting has been a special
[6:50] meeting not just another meeting let
[6:53] this service today Lord not just be
[6:55] another service let it not be a
[6:57] tradition of gathering together let let
[6:59] it not be a ritual Lord may we press
[7:03] past the veil of tradition today see you
[7:05] face to face Lord may you come amongst
[7:07] us Lord that's our desire today we thank
[7:10] you for what you have done we thank you
[7:12] for the gifts Lord that you've given
[7:13] this assembly and Lord how they have
[7:16] blessed us Lord and how you have come
[7:18] Lord in your humility to walk the aisles
[7:21] of this little church touch our hearts
[7:24] Lord and let us feel your presence Lord
[7:26] we we were So Unworthy but Lord you paid
[7:29] a price Lord you hung on that cross so
[7:32] that the veil that hid us from you could
[7:34] be rent from the top to the bottom and
[7:36] we could boldly enter into your presence
[7:38] Lord and that's where we want to be
[7:39] today Father we don't want to be caught
[7:42] in the outer Court Lord or even the
[7:44] inner but Lord we want to press into the
[7:46] holy of holies where the shikina glory
[7:48] is Lord and ask that you would hover
[7:49] over us as we Fellowship around your
[7:52] word Lord and and let us Lord let us
[7:55] come up Lord and be caught up into the
[7:57] atmosphere of the heavenlies Lord Lord
[7:59] uh speak to us I pray once more in the
[8:03] name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[8:05] as you're seated
[8:08] today brother Brandon preached the
[8:10] message the unveiling of God and and
[8:12] it's just amazing uh as I've been
[8:14] sitting here this weekend to see the
[8:16] continuity of the inspiration amen that
[8:19] God's given brother Isaac and brother
[8:20] Ronnie and myself and and just just
[8:23] incredible you know how how uh uh it's
[8:26] all dovetailed together brother brandom
[8:28] in the unveiling of God is speaking
[8:30] about you know the veil of the temple
[8:33] that that kept people out of that
[8:35] shakina glory amen and how Christ died
[8:38] so that that Veil could be open so that
[8:40] the believer amen could enter freely
[8:42] into that place and fellowship in the
[8:45] presence of God Amen but he said over
[8:47] the last 2,000 years uh Satan has been
[8:50] at work and uh what has happened is that
[8:53] that place has been veiled up again by
[8:55] veils of tradition and man-made Creeds
[8:58] and traditions of men men and dogmas and
[9:01] and denominational Spirits have have all
[9:03] together covered up that place and and
[9:06] and once again remove the believer from
[9:08] the personal presence of Jesus Christ
[9:11] but brother Brandon said and oh my amen
[9:13] if you're if you're a message believer
[9:15] today by a real experience this is this
[9:17] is your reality brother Bram says that
[9:20] now we have crossed that Riven Veil we
[9:23] are on the other side now on the other
[9:25] side and he said you'll see if you'll
[9:27] break those old traditions and things
[9:29] and come to him you will see him you
[9:31] will see him standing the mighty
[9:34] conqueror he's the Word of Promise for
[9:37] this age made manifest you'll see the
[9:39] Mighty God unveiled see him right Among
[9:41] Us here unveiled the Mighty God
[9:45] unconquered by Traditions he's
[9:48] unconquered by Traditions how many have
[9:50] seen him amen how many have seen him uh
[9:52] in this message how about in this church
[9:54] in your life you've seen amen you you
[9:57] caught a vision of the Mighty God
[9:58] unveiled unconquered by Traditions what
[10:01] a powerful thing to think but you know
[10:04] uh you know as as human beings we're
[10:05] just we're given to a tendency of of
[10:08] being traditional and habitual creatures
[10:11] and so Jesus would rebuke the religious
[10:13] systems of his day and say that you are
[10:16] you are you are holding on to the
[10:17] traditions of the elders and and you're
[10:19] putting it in the place of God's word
[10:22] amen and that's something we you know
[10:24] friends we we have to recognize that all
[10:26] of us as human beings have a certain
[10:27] tendency amen toward word tradition and
[10:30] we we we love habit we love ritual and
[10:33] and and and and we sort of have that in
[10:35] our nature and so amen but we got to
[10:37] remember that a lot of things that go
[10:38] into having a church and a lot of thing
[10:40] that go into our our our sort of
[10:42] Christian daytoday and our our Sunday go
[10:44] meeting kind of a habits are are are
[10:47] just tradition amen and amen and many of
[10:50] them it wasn't your tradition or my
[10:51] tradition but it was something that was
[10:53] handed down from before and we do things
[10:55] after a certain pattern because that's
[10:57] the way it's always been done amen amen
[10:59] but we got to watch those things because
[11:01] amen because some of those things uh
[11:03] have a real truth to them and some of
[11:05] them are just tradition and as long as
[11:06] was around the scripture we teach the
[11:08] principle Jesus said it's the traditions
[11:10] of the elders and so we got to find out
[11:12] that as parents Amen to children or to
[11:15] as an older generation raising up a
[11:17] younger generation not everything that
[11:19] we hand down to them is going to be real
[11:22] the real truth of God some of it's just
[11:24] our Traditions some of it's just our
[11:26] sensibilities some of it's just the you
[11:28] know just just maybe personal opinions
[11:30] and things and that's why we want to we
[11:32] want to in we want to uh instruct our
[11:34] young people if you want to really get
[11:36] somewhere with God Amen one thing you
[11:38] got to watch out for is what I'll call
[11:40] conventional wisdom just traditional
[11:42] wisdom you know you know what I mean
[11:44] it's just uh you know to get to get the
[11:46] kind of you know to learn how to just go
[11:48] with the flow and follow the crowd and
[11:50] just do what other things are doing amen
[11:52] but if you ever want to see Christ in
[11:53] your life get you a real good appetite
[11:56] for truth amen amen cuz conventional
[11:58] wisdom amen it'll get you a good job
[12:00] it'll get you through this world it'll
[12:02] amen it'll help you on your journey
[12:04] through this life amen and through this
[12:06] world but the truth will get you out of
[12:08] this world Amen and there's and that's
[12:10] what we're after today amen it's not
[12:12] just to come together in a traditional
[12:14] Gathering amen but we want the truth of
[12:17] God we want the reality and we want the
[12:19] life amen that's that's what we desire
[12:21] tradition will make the word of God of
[12:23] none effect now see in other words amen
[12:25] it doesn't necessarily mean you don't
[12:27] have the word amen but what tradition
[12:29] does is it takes the effect out of the
[12:31] word you could be preaching the genuine
[12:33] gospel amen there's many people
[12:35] preaching the message of the hour but
[12:37] because of their traditions because of
[12:39] their mindsets because of their Hang-Ups
[12:42] amen and baggage of the past it's taken
[12:44] the effect of that word out of the
[12:45] church amen what a terrible thing
[12:48] brother Brandon would point it out how
[12:49] Jesus would tell them in vain you
[12:51] worship me amen can you imagine what a
[12:54] terrible place to be that they were
[12:55] truly worshiping amen the God Amen of
[12:59] Abraham but but without effect they were
[13:02] wor their worship was in vain because of
[13:04] traditions that would bind them amen
[13:07] that would kill the effect now that's
[13:09] Satan's tool against the church that's
[13:12] Satan that's how Satan conquers the
[13:14] church amen he conquers them by
[13:17] tradition we've all amen I trust we've
[13:19] all studied the church age book and
[13:20] brother brother Brandon will lay it out
[13:22] uh line after line and tell the story
[13:25] amen of how when Christ died and God
[13:27] sent the Holy Ghost down on the day of
[13:29] of Pentecost amen each age got further
[13:31] and further and further away from the
[13:33] pattern amen that God had put into place
[13:35] because they piled up more and more and
[13:38] more and more traditions and it became
[13:40] they got to where they had such a
[13:42] baggage train of of Pomp and
[13:44] Circumstance that the Holy Ghost
[13:45] couldn't move the church anymore God
[13:47] didn't have the preeminence anymore
[13:49] friends that's how Satan conquers the
[13:51] church now he would talk about the
[13:53] nicians right he said now the way that
[13:56] that started out is it was called Deeds
[13:59] amen but then it became a Doctrine right
[14:01] Amen in that to that first church age it
[14:03] was the Deeds of the nicians but then
[14:05] time went on and the Deeds became
[14:07] doctrines it started out as just well
[14:09] that's just how we do it in our church
[14:11] this is just our way of approaching it
[14:13] amen but a little while longer said this
[14:15] is our Doctrine this is the way amen
[14:17] this is the truth this is this is what
[14:19] you got to bow to Amen to be a real
[14:21] believer is get under our Doctrine
[14:24] brother B said it was Deeds then it
[14:25] became a Doctrine it became the standard
[14:29] it became the unbending way now friends
[14:32] we all got our way of doing things amen
[14:34] we all got our Traditions If we're
[14:36] honest about it amen we have a certain
[14:38] order of having Church in this assembly
[14:40] and it's not the order amen that they
[14:41] have in another assembly we have certain
[14:44] traditions we have certain ways of
[14:45] mannerisms you know I'm wearing a suit
[14:47] today amen because that's the tradition
[14:50] amen is to dress in a suit I didn't I
[14:52] didn't come here in a Rob and sandals
[14:53] just to prove that I'm not a slave to
[14:55] tradition I dress like a man in 2025
[14:58] dresses amen and I and we do all that so
[15:00] we have we have traditions we have ways
[15:03] of doing things but brother Bram says
[15:05] what when it's when it becomes an
[15:06] unbending way an unbending way amen
[15:10] that's the problem we've seen it Time
[15:12] After Time After Time even in the ranks
[15:15] of this message amen it started out as
[15:17] somebody's idea it was somebody it was
[15:19] just the Deeds it was amen it was some
[15:21] preacher style or some Church's uh
[15:24] methods amen but then it became the way
[15:27] and it became unbending and it became a
[15:29] cage for God's people Amen to wrap
[15:31] around them and say you got to come this
[15:33] way or God can't help you you got to
[15:35] come to this church you got to sit under
[15:37] this ministry you got to dress this
[15:39] dress you got to talk this talk amen but
[15:42] there's got to be a church somewhere
[15:44] amen that's unconquered by
[15:51] Traditions amen you travel around amen
[15:53] these ministers travel around and preach
[15:55] and they know what I'm talking about
[15:56] everywhere you go they got their way
[15:58] they got their idea
[15:59] and we've been through all this kind of
[16:00] legalism in the message you know amen
[16:02] you go certain place they say well
[16:04] preacher shouldn't wear beards a
[16:05] preacher shouldn't have a beard amen
[16:07] they don't say that much anymore but
[16:09] that was a big thing that was a big
[16:11] thing you go somewhere else say well a
[16:12] preacher should never wear a blue suit
[16:14] amen a preacher should only wear black
[16:15] and white maybe a red tie amen and
[16:18] that's the tradition amen so what do you
[16:20] do as a minister if you got a burden for
[16:22] the people you'll jump through the Hoops
[16:24] you'll shave the beard you'll change the
[16:26] shirt you'll do what you got to do Amen
[16:27] to get to the people and try to get them
[16:30] the message amen but here's the burden
[16:31] of My Heart Church there's got to be a
[16:33] church somewhere shouldn't there ought
[16:35] to be a church somewhere that's
[16:37] unconquered by Traditions that's not
[16:39] bound amen by the ideas of man shouldn't
[16:42] there be a church that believes the
[16:44] message and the whole message and
[16:46] nothing but the
[16:48] message I believe there should and I I
[16:51] intend to be that friends hallelujah oh
[16:54] yeah the unbending way it finally took
[16:56] over and God was pushed aside it started
[16:59] so small so quietly so inoffensively it
[17:03] looked so good it seemed so sound then
[17:06] it caught a hold and like a python it
[17:08] squeezed out the very breath and killed
[17:10] all the spirituality there was in the
[17:11] church amen some of you were sitting in
[17:13] a church when the Winds of peria begin
[17:16] to blow amen some of you Old-Timers you
[17:18] were sitting in a church amen when the
[17:20] false Thunders began to sound amen and
[17:22] it looked good be honest it looked good
[17:24] some of it sounded good it seemed so
[17:26] sound amen But as time has gone watch
[17:29] how it manifested itself amen it bound
[17:32] the church it killed the life it salted
[17:35] the Earth and amen and the Next
[17:37] Generation has no Revival amen but
[17:39] there's got to be a church amen that's
[17:41] unconquered by tradition there's got to
[17:44] be a true bride true Thunders true
[17:47] presence true
[17:51] word oh it caught a hold and like a
[17:54] python it squeezed out the very breath
[17:57] and killed all the spirituality there
[17:58] was in the church oh that false Vine is
[18:00] subtle it's like an angel of Light till
[18:03] it gets a hold on you brother BR said
[18:05] now I want to say I believe in
[18:06] leadership but it's not the leadership
[18:08] of men I believe in I believe in the
[18:11] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[18:14] through the word that's the kind of
[18:16] leadership we want friends you know
[18:18] we're not an organization amen and you
[18:20] know you you could take and me and
[18:22] brother Ronnie and brother Isaac could
[18:23] sit down and swap notes amen and try to
[18:26] do our best to put three sermons
[18:27] together amen would go in continuity but
[18:30] you can't do it better than the Holy
[18:31] Ghost does it amen his way is perfect
[18:34] his way is Anointed amen we want the
[18:37] Holy Ghost leading the church we want
[18:39] the Holy Ghost leading the pastor
[18:41] leading the preacher leading the mother
[18:43] and the father amen Holy Ghost
[18:46] leadership I know in message circles we
[18:48] like to talk a lot about our
[18:50] non-denominational status oh we're not a
[18:53] denomination oh thank God we're not like
[18:55] them Pentecostals thank God we're not
[18:57] like them basist we non-denominational
[18:59] you know I used to go around and tell
[19:02] people cuz you go around and you tell
[19:03] people they ask you well what you know
[19:05] what brand of Christian are you and I
[19:07] that's what I always used to say
[19:08] non-denominational but you know it's
[19:11] cool to be non-denominational now it's
[19:13] cool now amen and now when you you tell
[19:16] somebody you're non- denominational the
[19:17] image they got in their mind amen is
[19:19] somebody with ripped jeans and long hair
[19:21] sitting in a converted movie theater
[19:23] it's cool to be non- denominational
[19:25] friends but we're an independent church
[19:28] we're a Bible believing Church we're a
[19:30] Holy Ghost Church amen amen cuz they can
[19:34] call themselves non- denominational but
[19:36] they're just as dead they're just as
[19:39] bound amen but there's got to be a
[19:41] church somewhere that's free amen oh
[19:45] we're non- denominational friends but
[19:46] you know what there's a pale horse rider
[19:48] today and he is alive and well and that
[19:51] Antichrist spirit is riding against
[19:53] God's church and I know I've preached it
[19:55] before I'll preach it again that the
[19:56] pale horse rider is not fighting today
[19:59] against the Catholic church he killed
[20:01] him a long time ago it was a long time
[20:04] ago that the that the pale horse rider
[20:06] got his hands on the Lutheran church
[20:09] amen and brought that Frosty Touch of
[20:10] death to that organization amen the
[20:13] target amen the enemy the focus of the
[20:17] Antichrist spirit is God's true church
[20:19] today he's riding against you I come to
[20:22] warn you brother amen that false
[20:24] religion spiritual death is riding
[20:27] against you he's riding against the the
[20:29] Bride of Jesus Christ oh sure he is he's
[20:32] killed off Seven Ages of Revival amen
[20:34] but now we come to the final showdown
[20:37] remember brother bam said Jesus had a
[20:39] showdown it was a showdown amen between
[20:42] the Creeds of his day and the Real
[20:44] Living Word but he said there's coming a
[20:46] final showdown and it'll be a battle
[20:48] fought on Mount Zion yeah a Mount Zion
[20:51] Showdown and that's where the battle is
[20:53] friends that's the test will this bride
[20:56] bow her head to denomination Spirits
[20:59] amen will she bow her head to Traditions
[21:03] or will amen will she prove that she's
[21:05] not like Eve will she stay with the word
[21:07] for her day will she keep it pure will
[21:10] she keep it
[21:11] unadulterated I I I'm determined with
[21:14] everything that's in me to fight the
[21:16] good fight today amen and contend for
[21:19] the message of the hour keep the
[21:22] Traditions out of it keep your idea out
[21:25] of
[21:26] it amen we won't conquered by tradition
[21:30] brother Bram in the church age book
[21:32] remember he said you'll be an invincible
[21:33] Army how will you do it he said it's if
[21:36] you get a true revelation of the two
[21:40] Spirits two spirits in the framework of
[21:43] the Christian church now one of them's
[21:46] not in the church but it's in the
[21:47] framework two spirits in the framework
[21:49] of the church and by God's spirit you
[21:52] got to discern and withstand the
[21:56] Antichrist spirit
[21:59] but if you do
[22:00] that Satan will be powerless before
[22:04] her amen that's how you win the final
[22:07] showdown that's how we fight the
[22:09] greatest battle ever fought amen is to
[22:11] be amen such a bride of Christ amen that
[22:14] by the message we can discern amen that
[22:17] there is a cold Hand of Death reaching
[22:19] out toward your life and the devil would
[22:21] like nothing more amen than to snatch
[22:23] you off your message Pew and get his
[22:25] cold clammy hands around you and cause
[22:28] you to bet trade your Revival amen for
[22:30] an old dead tradition and make you think
[22:33] because you believe God sent a prophet
[22:35] and because you dress by the dress code
[22:37] and because you associate with a certain
[22:38] group of people that you've got the
[22:40] goods amen but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[22:43] won't fall for that cuz by God's spirit
[22:45] she can discern the Antichrist spirit
[22:47] and as sure as there's an antichrist
[22:49] Spirit the true spirit of God the true
[22:52] spirit of God is in the bride to win The
[22:57] Showdown she's not like Eve on this
[23:00] one's
[23:01] different oh
[23:04] yeah oh my it's a two-fold revelation
[23:08] that Devil's fighting to kill you this
[23:10] is not a game we don't we don't come to
[23:13] just play church this is not a game that
[23:15] Devil Wants You dead he wants you in a
[23:18] spiritual grave he don't want you to
[23:20] revived he doesn't want you to have
[23:22] power amen he's the thing he's most
[23:25] afraid of is that you'll get a
[23:26] revelation of who you truly are are and
[23:29] what you're supposed to be cuz if you
[23:30] can get a hold of that he's got no power
[23:33] over you you're Invincible you're
[23:36] untouchable impregnable that's right
[23:39] amen so he comes with tradition Satan
[23:41] doesn't care if you belong to a message
[23:44] Church long as he can get you dead in
[23:46] your message church he don't care if you
[23:48] got the right pictures on the wall amen
[23:50] as long as he can kill you amen or get
[23:52] you into fanaticism if he can't get you
[23:54] into fanaticism he'll get you over into
[23:56] formalism he doesn't care long as you're
[24:00] dead yeah we're in a battle
[24:02] friends he just needs to make you dead
[24:04] in the church that you're
[24:06] in amen and cause you to just become a
[24:09] part of the organization but this
[24:11] message did not come to form an
[24:12] organization brother BR said we're not
[24:14] building an organization we are building
[24:17] individuals Christ sent me to build
[24:19] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[24:21] Christ that they might be the PowerHouse
[24:24] and the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[24:26] his word this message neb came to reform
[24:29] the Church it came to restore the
[24:31] individual that's why some of you are
[24:33] sitting around discouraged all the time
[24:35] amen cuz you spend all day long
[24:37] streaming everywhere amen and getting in
[24:39] on all the gossip and all the current
[24:40] events amen and you're worried cuz this
[24:42] one's fighting that one and there's
[24:44] problems over in that church amen the
[24:46] message never came to fix the church
[24:48] it's not a message to the organization
[24:50] don't be surprised if we still have
[24:53] organizational problems around the
[24:55] message just make sure you as an
[24:59] individual have been restored by the
[25:01] word for your
[25:02] [Applause]
[25:07] day stop trying to fix the church let
[25:10] God fix you let him fix your family let
[25:13] him fix your problems let him fix your
[25:18] attitude
[25:20] hallu I'll tell you what's going on
[25:22] around the message it's the passing of
[25:24] the torch amen and the Baton is being
[25:26] passed from one generation to another
[25:28] another amen and many of the first
[25:30] generation that walked with the prophet
[25:31] there's very few of them left but God
[25:34] but see the message can never be
[25:35] denominated this revival can never stop
[25:38] and so God is obligated to raise up
[25:40] another generation of young people amen
[25:43] and he's doing it friends amen I'm here
[25:45] to tell you let my Ministry be a witness
[25:48] God has got another generation and if
[25:50] all of us pass away there will be young
[25:52] people that'll sweep this message on to
[25:55] the coming of the Lord cuz you'll never
[25:57] deny at the
[26:01] message but because it's a passing of
[26:03] the Baton amen there's a war there's a
[26:06] war I don't mean I don't mean a war
[26:08] against the world I mean a war in our
[26:09] pulpits a war amongst our Ministries
[26:12] amen cuz it's a fight for the hearts and
[26:14] the minds of the young people Amen to

[26:17] generational transition amen and so
[26:20] everybody is trying to set the pattern
[26:22] amen yeah every every man every teacher
[26:24] every Church they got their idea the way
[26:26] it should be amen if we could just get
[26:28] the young people to take my pattern if

[26:32] they could just get under my teaching
[26:33] amen then we'd be okay amen I say I pray
[26:36] that our young people amen will be able
[26:39] by the help of the Lord to break out of
[26:41] every pattern of man amen that they'll

[33:03] church with power from on high that's
[33:05] where I'm from I'm from before the
[33:08] denomination before the organization
[33:10] before the
[33:11] Creed take it back to the beginning

[33:22] but now these organizational Spirits are
[33:24] trying to bring us under control amen
[33:26] friends amen when you look around the
[33:28] message ranks and you see and you see

[33:32] form and you see men trying to enforce
[33:34] their ideas on other men amen until we
[33:38] end up we got a music Bishop we got a
[33:40] shout Bishop we got a dance Bishop
[33:42] that's why we left our denomination

[33:47] Old-Timers how many in this church came
[33:49] out of a denominational Church to the
[33:50] message amen look around young people go
[33:53] ask one of these people what it was like
[33:55] under that denominational teaching back
[33:57] in that old dead church amen where
[33:59] somebody had to tell you what to think
[34:01] and somebody had to tell you what to do
[34:02] and somebody had to tell the pastor what
[34:04] to preach we left that behind us we're
[34:07] not going
[34:13] back thought it was amazing brother
[34:15] brother Isaac used the quote it was in
[34:16] my notes Amen brother BR preached on
[34:18] washing Jesus feet amen down there in in
[34:21] in Phoenix amen and he had them
[34:22] Pharisees he had all didn't he have that
[34:25] bunch of preachers nailed amen all
[34:26] sitting around the table talking about
[34:28] how many members they added to their
[34:29] church and how great their Ministry was
[34:31] and what they learned in the Seminary
[34:32] and how intelligent amen they were and
[34:34] how high in this society and all those
[34:36] kind of things and here's Jesus sitting
[34:38] in a corner with dirty feet amen think
[34:40] of it Jesus on the outside of his church
[34:43] amen we know we know what a terrible
[34:44] picture it is Jesus on the outside of
[34:46] the Lutheran Church Jesus on the outside
[34:49] of the Methodist Church Jesus on the
[34:50] outside of the Pentecostal church but
[34:52] there's something that Grieves my soul
[34:54] today to look around our ranks around
[34:56] this world and see Jes Jesus Christ amen
[34:59] the Savior amen sitting on the outside
[35:02] of many a message
[35:04] church but I say let him
[35:07] in brother BR said that's why I left the
[35:10] Baptist
[35:11] [Applause]
[35:13] Church I believe my God ought to be
[35:16] worshiped in the power and demonstration
[35:17] of the Holy Ghost I don't believe in
[35:19] your old Court former Creeds he wants to
[35:21] be loved look at him sitting over there
[35:24] and he can't be loved because of the way
[35:25] he's treated you self-made Seminary
[35:28] chickens of pastors hatch yourself out
[35:30] and put the dirty name of Holy Roller on
[35:32] the worship of Jesus no wonder your
[35:34] congregation don't stand taller it's the
[35:36] way that you've treated him if you would
[35:38] preach the Bible in the power of the
[35:40] resurrection of Christ Saints would be
[35:42] shouting in every
[35:45] church
[35:47] hallah it's not Jesus fault it's your
[35:53] fault look at the messes we got around
[35:55] the message it's not the word's fault
[35:56] it's not the messages fault it's our
[35:59] fault Oh Holy Roller bunch of Fanatics
[36:02] go on Pharisee your time's
[36:04] coming amen just like the children of
[36:06] Israel got out in the wilderness amen
[36:09] they were so happy to get out of Egypt
[36:11] oh they were so happy remember that that
[36:13] first day you stepped out of that dead
[36:15] church and came into the light of the
[36:17] message you were so happy to get out of
[36:19] that church you couldn't you just
[36:20] couldn't wait for the doors to slam
[36:21] behind you amen and you were so happy to
[36:23] leave but after a little while amen
[36:25] people got to grumbling amen you got
[36:27] into some trials you found out coming to
[36:29] the message didn't fix every problem in
[36:30] your life found out there'd still be
[36:32] struggles found out we'd still have
[36:33] battles found out we'd still disappoint
[36:36] one another sometimes in our humanity
[36:38] and it got to that place and all of a
[36:39] sudden the people started saying well
[36:41] you know uh it was more comfortable it
[36:43] was so comfortable back in
[36:45] Egypt it was so comfortable you know if
[36:47] we could just do it a little more like
[36:49] The ecumenical churches do if we could
[36:51] just get everybody together and just
[36:52] talk it out amen and just try to just
[36:54] try to get everybody settled and
[36:56] everybody on the same page if amen if we
[36:58] could just organize ourselves and amen
[37:00] and start getting everybody together and
[37:02] get everybody's name on a book and get
[37:03] some dialogue going and all those kind
[37:05] wasn't it better in Egypt amen wasn't it
[37:07] better back there you know we didn't
[37:09] have to just you know we didn't have to
[37:10] just get so worked up over all these
[37:12] little doctrinal fights we we had a we
[37:14] had somebody to tell us what to do and
[37:16] what to think and all the oh my amen and
[37:18] Joshua and Caleb are sitting there
[37:20] saying that's why we
[37:22] left that's why we left we were slaves
[37:26] in Egypt
[37:28] we were not free we had somebody telling
[37:31] us what to do telling us what to think
[37:33] telling us what to wear telling us how
[37:36] to worship telling us how to shout
[37:38] telling us how to dance telling us how
[37:40] to
[37:41] cry that's why we
[37:43] left and friends when I hear when I
[37:46] detect that Spirit coming around the
[37:48] church trying to get into our into our
[37:50] ministry you young men look at the peers
[37:52] look at your peers around this message
[37:54] and watch that Spirit trying to get into

[38:20] denomination that old rotten carcass I'm
[38:23] an
[38:24] eagle I need something fresh Hallelujah
[38:28] garlic breath
[38:32] preachers once you try to organize this
[38:34] message the day you try to organize it
[38:36] the day you touch it with your opinion
[38:39] it'll kill the
[38:40] Revival that's what's happened that's
[38:43] what's happened today brother BR
[38:44] preached the Third Exodus he said it's
[38:46] because our churches have become
[38:48] intellectual we got the best dressed
[38:50] crowds the biggest
[38:52] organization the smartest ministers am I
[38:55] preaching or what
[38:57] that we have no use of the Holy Spirit
[38:59] the way it was back
[39:01] there amen cuz we're full and he says
[39:05] and they think that they're more able
[39:07] with their intellectual
[39:09] Minds Amen to set a church in order
[39:12] better than what the Holy Spirit could
[39:14] do
[39:15] it so they don't need it any longer we
[39:17] don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the
[39:18] sick we got doctors we don't need the
[39:20] Holy Spirit to speak with tongues we got
[39:22] intelligent people we don't need the
[39:24] Holy Spirit to preach the word we got
[39:25] books amen we don't need holy spirit
[39:28] amen to start churches get under my
[39:30] organization amen we don't need the Holy
[39:32] Spirit to to deliver amen we got
[39:34] Psychology programs amen we don't need
[39:37] that old Holy Spirit we know better
[39:39] we're smarter now we've come a long way
[39:42] we're a better class of
[39:44] people he said they adopted a man-made
[39:46] Spirit a man-made system to take place
[39:49] of the Holy Spirit he said when you do
[39:51] that you take right out of the framework
[39:53] the
[39:54] lifeline brother you remember there's
[39:56] two spirits in the framework of the
[39:58] church the moment you take the holy
[40:00] ghost out of the church you're only left
[40:03] with the Antichrist Spirit that's why
[40:05] you either be under the Seal of God or
[40:08] you'll be under the mark of the beast
[40:10] amen because if you take the Holy Spirit
[40:12] out of the framework the only thing left
[40:14] is spiritual death the only thing left
[40:17] is
[40:19] denomination but he said there's a
[40:21] people that's elected that got their
[40:23] names on the Lamb's Book of Life they
[40:24] can't go for
[40:26] that oh they can't go for that they
[40:28] can't stand it amen now but see but he
[40:31] says we got these churches and he said
[40:33] now watch now how subtle he said they
[40:35] won't come right out and say
[40:38] it oh yeah they won't get in the pulpit
[40:40] and preach against the Holy Ghost yeah
[40:44] oh you honor me with your lips but your
[40:45] heart is far from me they won't come
[40:47] right out and say it but he said their
[40:49] actions prove it and actions speak
[40:51] louder than words how do you judge a
[40:53] church friends not by its teaching but
[40:54] by its Fruit by the life that it can re
[40:57] reproduce that'll show what kind of a
[40:59] seed is in it is what it brings
[41:01] forth amen you can use the words you can
[41:04] preach the message and still kill the
[41:06] Revival and it's happening all over this
[41:08] world Amen but let's speak it out loud
[41:10] today amen speak for this church speak
[41:14] for yourself let's speak it right out

[41:19] not settle I will not bow to
[41:23] denominational idols

[41:42] society Amen brother B said that's the
[41:44] Church of this day amen oh yeah they're
[41:47] impregnated by something because they
[41:48] bring forth members amen but he said

[42:13] opening of the word how can you let

[43:08] far into that worship and screaming and
[43:10] shouting and dancing and carrying on
[43:11] brother brandom said we were off balance

[43:16] mechanics but we need the Dynamics of
[43:19] God to come down and Spark the church

[47:31] don't want it we don't want it we're
[47:33] like that syop phenician woman she
[47:35] wasn't she wasn't one of the chosen she
[47:37] wasn't in the circle oh no she was a
[47:40] gentile so when she came to Jesus amen

[47:45] tradition was in her way amen and she
[47:47] tried to she needed him her daughter was
[47:49] so sick she had to get to Jesus it was
[47:52] the only hope that she had amen but when
[47:54] she when she tried to get to him she hit
[47:55] a wall of tradition
[47:57] and Jesus said hey this Bread's not for
[48:00] you this this isn't how the this isn't
[48:02] how things are done that's not how we do
[48:04] it in this church that's not according
[48:06] to our order that's not according to the
[48:08] way we teach it but she was
[48:12] perseverant the bride is persevering and
[48:15] so when she hits that wall she doesn't
[48:17] stop no she'll persevere she'll say Lord
[48:20] if you won't give me the bread I'll
[48:22] persevere for the crumbs I'll come by an
[48:24] untraditional way

[48:35] down and wash them I I I'll Cry tears of
[48:37] repentance I don't care who's watching I
[48:39] don't care what they think I'll do what
[48:40] it takes to get to Jesus that's the
[48:42] Bride of Jesus Christ I pray amen that
[48:44] we would get a spirit Among Us Amen to
[48:47] persevere past every tradition amen

[48:54] children to True Word Tabernacle I pray
[48:56] we're getting them the church and

[49:16] wrong way amen as we go we go to the
[49:19] veil and we're longing to get into that
[49:21] shakina glory and because of all our
[49:23] traditional thinking amen we come to
[49:24] that Veil and we begin to shake it and
[49:26] pull on and tug and say let me in please
[49:28] let me in Lord I beg you let me pass the
[49:31] veil Lord let me get through but that
[49:33] denominational teaching and that old

[50:50] Holy Ghost and Fire on the inside of you

[51:15] will be by no means
[51:17] lukewarm I don't care how they teach
[51:20] bride maturity today I don't care how
[51:22] they present it as some kind of a cool
[51:25] oh sane and sens
[51:27] intellectual dry dead cold miserable
[51:31] Church experience that's not what it is
[51:33] this bride brother Bram said she will be
[51:35] by no means lukewarm she'll be on fire
[51:37] for God she'll be moving in the spirit
[51:39] of God Amen you'll be y you won't be lay

[51:51] tent come into the holy of holies come
[51:54] into the Shak of Glory
[51:57] amen that's who the bride is she's not a
[51:59] bunch of Pentecostal babies brother
[52:01] Nathan that's all this Pentecostal
[52:02] preaching that's not what it is at
[52:05] all you need to listen to a few more
[52:07] messages you think I'm preaching
[52:09] Pentecost amen I am but not the one
[52:11] you're
[52:13] thinking no we're fired up in rapturing
[52:15] faith we've been fired up into something
[52:17] higher than that we're already
[52:18] resurrected we're getting ready for a
[52:20] Rapture friends amen that we're not
[52:22] we're not part of that Pentecostal
[52:23] denomination It's Just As Dead As the
[52:25] rest of them sure it is brother Bram
[52:28] said actually he never liked the word
[52:29] Pentecost amen because we talk about the
[52:31] Pentecostal fathers amen but that that
[52:34] outpouring to happen on the day of
[52:35] Pentecost amen the Pentecostal
[52:37] worshipper wasn't the ones in the upper
[52:38] room it was the ones that were just
[52:40] observing the feast they were just there
[52:43] for the tradition they were honoring the
[52:45] holiday amen but the real Pentecost is
[52:48] not a denomination it's not a tradition
[52:52] it's not a style worship it's a life
[52:55] it's an experience
[52:57] and we got to get back to the
[52:58] Pentecostal
[53:00] experience the eagle experience yes
[53:04] sir he said we're the ones we're the
[53:06] Church of the firstborn we're the ones
[53:07] that's in the kingdom of God yeah
[53:09] there's a lot of Pentecostal churches
[53:10] and they're just as dead and formal as
[53:12] the rest of them I know I'm preaching
[53:13] about formalism you think you think
[53:15] formalism is just a church where they
[53:17] just cross their arms and fall asleep
[53:19] and they never say an amen well that's
[53:21] that's formal that's dead as can be but
[53:24] most of the time when brother Brandon
[53:25] preaches on formalism he's preaching to
[53:26] Pentecostals amen because the
[53:28] Pentecostals got their form too they got
[53:30] their unbending way amen there's a lot
[53:33] of Pentecostal churches around the
[53:34] message where they bring the people in
[53:36] and they get out their Whip and say you
[53:37] better shout you better dance you better
[53:40] carry on you better get noisy or you're
[53:42] not spiritual amen you better do it the
[53:44] way that we do it here that's just a
[53:46] formal friends amen never let some man
[53:49] try to put you under a form and make you
[53:52] be conform to a certain pattern of
[53:54] behavior that's not Liberty that's not
[53:56] rival that's
[53:58] dead it's
[54:01] formal formal is normal yes sir formal
[54:06] is normal amen this church I I praise
[54:09] the lord it's normal to shout in this
[54:11] church it's normal to break out in a
[54:13] dance it's normal to say Amen it's
[54:16] normal to get excited I thank God it is
[54:18] I trust to never be but if we get to
[54:20] where we're just coming to truer
[54:21] Tabernacle on Sunday morning and just to
[54:23] act in a normal way come on on and this
[54:26] is just the way we do things here amen
[54:28] God spare us amen from a normal spirit I
[54:32] don't want anything to do with normal
[54:33] Christianity I don't want to be a normal
[54:35] message believer I don't want to be a
[54:37] normal church
[54:38] member I don't want to be formal I want
[54:42] to break out of every mold I want to fly
[54:45] I want to fly I'm an eagle don't cage me
[54:50] up you know we get in normal mode that's
[54:53] why God can't move normal mode you think
[54:57] yeah we got Liberty cuz it's noisy
[54:59] friends we got Liberty cuz we let the
[55:02] Holy Ghost do what he
[55:04] [Applause]
[55:08] wants normal mode oh brother R said you
[55:11] can Scream and Shout jump up and down
[55:13] all you want to but you deny this word
[55:15] it won't do any good that's always it
[55:16] it's a word test deny the word it won't
[55:19] do any good you're just cranking the
[55:20] Pistons you got the spark but you got no
[55:22] gasoline to fire it by amen that's the
[55:24] way the church will be said one will set
[55:26] still and the other one will go up both
[55:27] of them claim to be churches both claim
[55:29] to be bride you say What's the
[55:31] difference between the Pentecostals and
[55:33] the message Believers is that the
[55:35] message Believers have the Dynamics and
[55:37] the mechanics what's the difference
[55:39] between the bride and the Baptist the
[55:41] bride has the mechanics and the Dynamics
[55:44] amen she's got the amen she's got the
[55:46] gasoline to give her the power and she's
[55:48] got the spark to make it move she's got
[55:50] both of it friends amen these
[55:52] Pentecostal churches they'll be
[55:54] screaming and shouting and dancing their
[55:55] way right into the trip ulation amen and
[55:57] they'll be sitting still and the bride
[55:58] will be gone amen because all of that is
[56:01] just formal friends Amen brother brandom
[56:03] said it's like a like the mothers used
[56:04] to do they would take coffee grounds and
[56:06] sugar and put it in a sa and give it to
[56:08] the baby to nurse on that's all
[56:10] Pentecostal babies have is a bunch of
[56:12] hype and emotion something to stimulate
[56:14] the flesh something to get them worked
[56:15] up pumped up amen get the organ going
[56:18] till everybody's dancing amen but they
[56:20] got no word and they got so they got no
[56:23] life amen they could talk about the Holy
[56:25] Ghost but I'll tell you what the real
[56:26] Holy Ghost is the true token is the
[56:29] literal life of Jesus Christ it's the
[56:32] same life amen that made it so he
[56:34] couldn't stay in a grave amen but
[56:36] whether you're a dead Lutheran a dead
[56:38] Methodist or a dead Pentecostal you got
[56:40] to get this quickening power in you amen
[56:42] till you resurrect up out of your Dead
[56:44] traditions and get into the real life of
[56:46] Christ life
[56:49] friends life oh we're not Pentecostal by
[56:52] denomination but we're not dead
[56:55] either amen we've been restored to the
[56:58] original faith of the Pentecostal
[56:59] fathers we not been restored just to
[57:01] emotion or just to gifts but we restored
[57:04] to
[57:06] life amen cuz our names were written on
[57:08] the Lamb's Book of Life and that's where
[57:10] the stimulation really is amen because
[57:13] John when he saw his name when he
[57:15] recognized that his name was on that
[57:16] Lamb's Book of Life that's when he could
[57:18] really have a good old fashion
[57:20] Pentecostal meeting that's when he could
[57:22] really make some noise amen oh because
[57:25] he got the Revelation that he had that
[57:28] eternal
[57:30] life that's why when you get around true
[57:32] word Tabernacle you're going to hear the
[57:33] message You're going to hear about seals
[57:35] that have been opened amen you're going
[57:37] to find out that Christ came down the
[57:39] mighty Angel descended in this hour Amen
[57:41] to take the seals off of God's book and
[57:44] give it back to the believer amen when
[57:47] he opened those Seven Seals he opened
[57:49] the Easter seal amen it was the Easter
[57:51] seal that came open amen because the
[57:53] real life of Christ had been buried back
[57:55] again
[57:56] under a Roman seal of denominational
[57:59] Traditions but the message broke the
[58:02] seal amen and that's why we got Easter
[58:05] like never before we've got life amen
[58:09] that's why you'll hear a little noise
[58:10] around
[58:11] here amen because when John saw his name
[58:14] was written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:15] he started getting into some King lamb
[58:17] worship amen he got so excited to know
[58:21] that he was one of God's elected of the
[58:22] day amen that the Bible said everything
[58:25] in the heavens everything beneath
[58:27] everything in the earth and everything
[58:29] in the sea heard John carrying on I pray
[58:31] Lord that we would get such a revelation
[58:33] of who we are today that there would not
[58:35] be a car go by amen that wouldn't hear
[58:38] the noise amen that the community would
[58:41] be aware that the world would become
[58:42] aware amen that there's somebody in
[58:44] bluon Ohio who saw their name written on
[58:46] the L's Book of
[58:48] Life you can't get out of order on that
[58:51] Revelation brother R said I've seen
[58:53] jumping spells and shouting spells and
[58:54] all those kind of things you know what
[58:56] he said nobody got hurt and that's what
[58:58] a lot of these dry formal amen
[59:00] oppressive denominational Spirits have
[59:02] got to learn amen that that carrying on
[59:04] like we had last night that don't hurt
[59:06] anybody actually it helps them actually
[59:08] it sets them free amen oh it don't hurt
[59:11] friends and brother BR said I never saw
[59:13] it out of order it was always right in
[59:15] order because they saw that their names
[59:18] were written on the Lamb's Book of
[59:21] Life ah I say we should praise the Lord
[59:23] today
[59:31] it's never out of order it's never out
[59:33] of order when it comes by the word and I
[59:35] want you to realize that the Revival
[59:36] we're enjoying in this church amen did
[59:38] not come to us by Pentecostal Traditions
[59:41] it did not come to us by man-made
[59:42] manufactured efforts it came by the
[59:44] preaching of the message amen but it
[59:46] came by leadership that knew enough to
[59:48] take their hands off of it and let the
[59:50] Holy Spirit have Liberty and because of
[59:52] that friends that's why we can dance
[59:54] amen and I know as soon as you break out
[59:56] out in a dance everybody around the
[59:57] world wants to come and balance you out
[59:59] and they want to take their quotes and
[1:00:00] try to slap the bonds back around our
[1:00:02] young people and say well yeah all right
[1:00:04] well it's all right if you dance but
[1:00:05] only so hard and only does this song
[1:00:08] it's all right if you shout but you can
[1:00:09] only shout too long and they'll take
[1:00:11] quotes they'll take quotes and kill the
[1:00:15] Revival they'll take that quote out of
[1:00:17] the first seal amen how many times has
[1:00:19] this quote been used to refrigerate a
[1:00:21] church in the four SE where brother Bram
[1:00:23] talked about the Pentecostal churches he
[1:00:25] said they get the music pumping up and
[1:00:26] everybody's jumping amen he said well I
[1:00:28] believe that brother Brandon believed in
[1:00:32] that he said but you know sometime when
[1:00:34] the Music Stops the dancing stops oo do
[1:00:39] you feel that nervous Spirit coming into
[1:00:41] the room on that go read the quote he
[1:00:44] said and that's all right too as long as
[1:00:46] they're living
[1:00:48] right I've listened to this Prophet all
[1:00:50] my life and I've heard him take the word
[1:00:53] of God and dismantle that Pentecostal
[1:00:55] denomination
[1:00:56] all the way down to the ground and lay
[1:00:58] the ax to the root of the tree and I
[1:01:00] have never one time heard him touch the
[1:01:02] blessings or try to withhold the joy and
[1:01:05] the worship and the freedom and the
[1:01:07] Liberty it's all right it's all right if
[1:01:11] they're living right in other words you
[1:01:13] got life so it's all
[1:01:18] right our teachers have made everything
[1:01:21] so super spiritual amen till the only
[1:01:23] way you're allowed to dance amen is if
[1:01:25] the if the Holy Ghost gets over you and
[1:01:26] just overwhelms you to where you become
[1:01:27] unconscious and you begin to just dance
[1:01:30] around and it don't matter if music's
[1:01:31] playing or what's going on I've seen it
[1:01:33] happen Zachary I remember at a youth
[1:01:35] camp I watched you dance for an hour or
[1:01:37] more it didn't matter what was playing
[1:01:38] you were caught up in the spirit dancing
[1:01:40] around the church I believe in that but
[1:01:43] you know what else I believe I believe
[1:01:45] that bride of Christ is free enough
[1:01:47] she's free enough amen she's free all
[1:01:49] together free indeed amen so when the
[1:01:52] song leader gets up and he begins to
[1:01:54] play amen some songs of Pentecostal
[1:01:56] praise I believe it's all right I
[1:01:59] believe it's all right to get that toe
[1:02:01] tapping get that body swaying it's all
[1:02:05] right we're
[1:02:08] alive I'm tired amen of these these
[1:02:11] super stitious overs spiritual amen dead
[1:02:15] formal Devils trying to take the Revival
[1:02:18] out of the
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:24] church you're free you got free
[1:02:27] expression we don't tell you to dance we
[1:02:29] don't tell you not to we don't tell you
[1:02:31] to shout we don't tell you not to say
[1:02:33] brother Athan I'm not really made that
[1:02:35] way I'm not I don't have that kind of
[1:02:36] nature that's all
[1:02:37] right you might not try it
[1:02:39] sometime just cuz you can just cuz he
[1:02:45] can not telling you what to do telling
[1:02:48] you you
[1:02:51] can that all right Pastor what I believe
[1:02:53] I think you believe that
[1:02:56] you gave me that
[1:02:59] impression
[1:03:01] free amen now scripturally they say oh
[1:03:04] you about they're just dancing because
[1:03:05] the music's pumping show me one time in
[1:03:07] the Bible they ever dance without music
[1:03:08] come on come
[1:03:10] on when David danced before the Lord
[1:03:13] they had the tambourine going they were
[1:03:15] playing the harps they struck up the
[1:03:16] band amen when Miriam amen when Miriam
[1:03:19] danced amen she took out that timberl
[1:03:22] heard a man preach one time he said we
[1:03:23] shouldn't have drums in the church cuz
[1:03:25] the never even mentions drum well it
[1:03:27] take a five minutes on Google to prove
[1:03:28] that one wrong amen that timberl that
[1:03:30] maram took that wasn't no tambourine it
[1:03:32] was a snare it was a drum she took that
[1:03:35] drum and she began to play I might I
[1:03:37] think she might have played it on the
[1:03:38] offbeat amen she started playing and she
[1:03:40] struck up a dancing Rhythm she began to
[1:03:43] say I get joy when I think about
[1:03:46] Egyptians in the sea I get joy when I
[1:03:49] think about no Tas Masters over
[1:03:53] me I'm free
[1:03:58] it's all right it's all right it's all
[1:04:04] right he deserves it he's worthy of it
[1:04:09] he man we got time to Worship the Lord
[1:04:11] we got freedom to do
[1:04:14] it let there be
[1:04:16] Liberty Give me liberty or give me
[1:04:19] death it'll be one or the other
[1:04:33] see when now holy ghost gets gets coming
[1:04:35] over your heart amen it begins to
[1:04:37] stimulate you until it don't matter if
[1:04:39] an army of Philistines after you you can
[1:04:41] run through that troop it don't matter
[1:04:43] what wall of denominational Traditions
[1:04:45] is between you and your promise you'll
[1:04:46] run through that
[1:04:49] wall you can do
[1:04:52] it now scripturally it'll always come
[1:04:54] with criticism
[1:04:56] so who cares it's further
[1:05:00] Vindication brother brand got so excited
[1:05:02] in the woods one time he started running
[1:05:04] around that
[1:05:06] tree that that little squirrel got out
[1:05:08] chatter chatter chatter
[1:05:10] chatter you know how he was running cuz
[1:05:13] there was an eagle sitting up there he
[1:05:15] saw how free that eagle was he saw how
[1:05:17] safe how secure how Untouchable that
[1:05:20] eagle
[1:05:21] was oh he got
[1:05:23] excited oh and it bothered that squirrel
[1:05:26] that squirrel just couldn't take it he
[1:05:27] just had to send that email he had to oh
[1:05:30] he had to complain he had to get on his
[1:05:31] blog and blog about it chatter chatter
[1:05:33] chatter chatter but it never bothered
[1:05:35] the eagle it never bothered the eagle
[1:05:38] let the Holy Ghost pour out in a meeting
[1:05:39] it'll get the chickens clucking but it
[1:05:42] don't bother an
[1:05:51] eagle oh when the Dynamics strike a
[1:05:55] chicken it don't do no good but when it
[1:05:57] strikes the eagle brother BR said he
[1:05:58] moves out
[1:06:02] hallelujah amen you know our our our
[1:06:05] bunch of denominational teachers around
[1:06:07] the message won't let the young people
[1:06:08] get enough Holy Ghost to get to the top
[1:06:09] of the fence post how they ever going to
[1:06:11] fly in the heaven you won't let them
[1:06:13] have a Pentecostal experience how they
[1:06:14] going to get into this bright Age come
[1:06:16] on let the little Eagles flop let them
[1:06:19] learn how to fly amen they're candidates
[1:06:22] for the Unseen World they're candidates
[1:06:23] for the supernatural don't deny them
[1:06:25] their experience amen that's a problem
[1:06:29] sometimes that's a problem Mary had amen
[1:06:31] cuz Mary had an experience with God but
[1:06:32] it didn't match their tradition amen
[1:06:35] what oh where we come in the message of
[1:06:37] the hour when the Holy Ghost gives
[1:06:38] somebody an experience but it don't fit
[1:06:40] the teaching It Don't Fit the tradition
[1:06:42] It Don't Fit the sensibilities well then
[1:06:45] throw them
[1:06:47] out cuz you'll never convince Mary of
[1:06:49] that brother man says she knew whose
[1:06:52] baby that was she was there when the
[1:06:54] angel came
[1:06:56] she was there when it happened I was
[1:06:58] there I was always an
[1:07:00] eagle they could peck on me but I'm an
[1:07:03] eagle and I already knew I was an eagle

[1:07:21] for
[1:07:22] Joy Heavenly places friends there's
[1:07:25] nothing more sad no picture more tragic
[1:07:29] than a Cage Bird amen but what we've
[1:07:32] produced around the message by all of
[1:07:33] our man-made Traditions is a bunch of
[1:07:35] caged Eagles we got a little bunch of
[1:07:38] little baby eagles sitting in cages amen
[1:07:40] and the devil didn't put them in there
[1:07:41] we put them in there by our traditions

[1:07:46] superstitions amen but there's only one
[1:07:49] message to caged Eagles yeah yeah we
[1:07:51] heard about the unclean Birds they got
[1:07:53] their cage they got their judgment they

[1:11:34] Ezekiel Saw the vision of it you've
[1:11:35] heard it pre on all weekend how it's

[1:12:07] nothing but a valley of dry
[1:12:09] bones and oh yeah the holy oh yeah the
[1:12:12] wind could come and blow over them and
[1:12:15] it could shake the bones and make a
[1:12:18] rattle it couldn't bring any
[1:12:20] life so God sent Luther God sent Wesley
[1:12:25] God sent acts God sent 1906 Pentecost

[1:12:55] fundamental preaching they got good free
[1:12:57] worship they got everything you would
[1:12:59] think that it would need amen but when
[1:13:01] you go around to these denominational
[1:13:02] churches and if I had have come around
[1:13:04] by some of you before you received your
[1:13:05] resurrection and looked you in the eye
[1:13:08] amen the eyes would have told the story

[1:13:13] Valley yeah you're Justified yeah you're
