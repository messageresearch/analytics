most high God comes from over in the Book of Genesis when God met Abraham and he said to him the most the most high God it was um it was actually one of the titles of Jehovah Elon and and meaning that he is the most high that there is no one above him he is the most high amen it's certainly uh good to have all of our visitors here this morning each one of you and amen and uh we look for a special day in the Lord today and amen uh we're going to be speaking this morning and uh for the book of Ephesians but just before we go to prayer uh through the scripture we'd like to go to prayer if we could just maybe bow our hearts and maybe just might reach over and take somebody by the hand or lay your hand on them and I just want to take just a moment this morning morning just just in prayer there's some things on our heart here but just just in studying last night and and sitting over and and some of the things we were reading here and I thought wouldn't it be something Lord if there could just be a new beginning today and some of the situations and some of the hearts and lives and maybe some come this morning and you just like to redo some things in your life and some new Direction and and I thought oh God we we serve a god that'll let us empty out so we can fill up again so I just wonder this morning as we bow our hearts if you just take a moment pray for the brother beside you or the sister beside you let's just dedicate this to him say Lord speak to our hearts this morning [Music] Father Lord you know the need of your people and father I'm aware that it's far beyond our ability Lord some of these things are so far Out Of Reach for a human being but Lord You're the god of Abraham and there is no condition there's no hindrance to you nor your word oh God and father I pray this morning for your children Lord whom you have shed your blood I pray for Mercy this morning oh God lord the hearts that are crying out even in the evening last night Lord we could just feel it coming into our heart Lord the needes Father the lives this morning that are dedica to you we want to just take a moment before we begin this meeting just a rededication of hearts and lives and asking you oh god father we we don't begin many services this way but this morning we just feel an inspiration Lord that we just begin with a lord we love you we want to serve you with our hearts oh God and we we ask you this morning that there would come such an anointing in the room Lord that you would give us grace and mercy and father that you would speak to our very needs and Lord that you would set aside the enemy that would so try Lord to beset your children but we ask you now for every individual life as one hand is laid on the other of your children Lord joining together Lord coming against the enemy our enemy and your enemy Lord you said you would be adversary to our adversary and we pray this morning that every Spirit unlike you Lord may they be bound by the authority of the almighty God that was written in a contract that whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and as a body this morning we bind every Spirit of confusion we bind every Spirit of unbelief we bind the spirit of sickness Lord and we ask you now in the name of Jesus may your mercy come into this Sanctuary Lord and give us Liberty upon your word now we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you this morning amen if you have your Bibles we' just like to go over into the word now into the book of Ephesians amen I'm I'm just uh just caught up in some of these things and I've just not been able to pull out of them so amen Ephesians chapter 1 uh and actually we're get into some of my favorite part of the book of Ephesians uh this next few verses is just uh I I there's no way that we can teach it verse by verse but I want to preach the subject anyhow um I want to read here uh where we were at uh Thursday night and then continue the reading and you'll see the continuity it's beautiful in whom uh Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also that after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise now what's the seal it's the Holy Ghost now which is the earnest can I say it like this which is also the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession brother Bram said that's what we get till we get to body change or the fullness of the adoption amen now wherefore I also after I heard word of your faith in the Lord Jesus and the love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you mentioning you in my prayers now here's the prayer of apostle Paul that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and the Revelation in the knowledge of him yeah now this is an Apostles prayer over an Ephesian church amen that God would give wisdom Revelation knowledge and that what the next verse that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of the inheritance of the Saints so in verse 17 he's praying that you get wisdom and knowledge of God and in verse 18 he's praying that your eyes will catch your part that's in the calling of God and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen God bless the word as you could be seated this morning I want to read as well from the book of Ephesians here uh this is an amplified version it's um uh I I just thought it was so powerful um if it's just something that kind of helps along uh I love how Paul says this in the King James the Amplified version says it just a little different and I want to read it to you it's beautiful uh I do not cease to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers for I always pray that the god of the Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory that he may Grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation of in sight into the Mysteries and secrets and into the deep and intimate knowledge of him by having the eyes of your heart flooded with light well I like that amen amen by having your heart the eyes of your heart flooded with light so that you can know and understand to which he has called you and how rich is his glorious inheritance in the Saint his set apart ones and you can know and understand what is the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of his power in us who believed now I I love that part and I want to take that if I can amen amen having Hearts flooded with light and I want to talk to us this morning a little bit about our hearts amen flooded with light amen I I just love the idea that God would flood his church with light that he would flood our hearts and he would fill it with light amen uh when I go back into the scriptures I find uh this is a a a great subject and and it covers a vast amount of the message of the hour of course but in this little area I want to talk to you a few minutes in this but I want to go back to 70th week of Daniel just for a moment and brother R going say something here he said that in the last days God's going to reveal these secrets to the church he hasn't done it before and the reason he hasn't done it is to keep the church watching and praying all the time not knowing when he's coming but remember in Daniel 12 he said that the wise shall understand in the last day see it's going to be given the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day they were living in the same is Gabriel came to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last day to reveal these great deep secret things amen now here's what Paul is saying he's saying I'm praying that the Lord will grant unto you this knowledge and wisdom and it'll come to you now I love that Paul's prayers are in line with scriptural promises do you want you want to see your prayers really excel in your life find the promises that God has made and then pray those promises become effective remember uh the other week we were teaching on the bride's Revival and brother R said they not recognized The Awakening of the Bride though praying and fasting they've not recognized The Awakening of the bride and he says see but if they would plead the promise it would become effective to them in other words if you got the promise and you're praying the promise the promise will become effective I I let me just say it like this you've heard brother brandom say pray for Revelation more than anything else amen now he wouldn't tell you that if there wasn't something in there amen that could be brought forth let me just go into the scripture with job when job was standing there and the Lord said unto him where was thou before the foundations of the world now I don't know that job had ever even thought that that was available to know amen amen uh you who would ever sat around without God inspiring that question and think that he could even know where he was before the world began but when God asked ask him that question now amen he says wait a minute this is available so when you go to the end of job in the 42nd chapter you will see job beginning to say unto the Lord declare thou unto me Lord amen and he begins to then uh uh demand of the Lord basically that he would receive the answers that God has asked him so sometimes amen we must realize that our prayers amen if you start praying in the direction that God has given the promise then your prayers can become manifest and here we find that there has been given the spirit and wisdom and Revelation to come in the end time who the Church of the Living God now the Bible declares this in the Book of Daniel Amen that the wise will know their God in Daniel 1 brother brandom's telling us that Gabriel came to Daniel and revealed these things and so will the holy spirit in the last days in Daniel 1 it says in the first year of Darius the son of ayus the seed of of of the mes which which was made uh King over the realm of the Chans in the first year of this Reign Daniel I understood by the book the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem now here's the beauty is is Daniel was actually learning by the books amen he had tooken and he knew the time was coming but he had understood by the books the season that he was living uh I I I think it's powerful in gabel's instructions brother Ram says he knows my heart and he's listening to me but I I wanted that I might Enlighten the people therefore I believe he's going to give it to me and Gable's instructions brother Braham said how do you expect people which are poor people uh brother Bram was going to be preaching on some deep things you know and his wife is talking to him and she says brother bam how do you expect these people I just hear the wife you know how do you expect these poor people and many of them uneducated like we are to understand these things and he said God will give the answer no matter how complicated it is God can break it down and make it simple for for we a portion of those people who are longing and praying for that day that hour that our eyes are set towards heaven and we're watching for this coming and I'm sure that he will show it to us and see here is a man who's saying that that these things are not above your understanding amen the the great mysteries of God in the end time are not Out Of Reach to the church now they were at one time but the spirit of wisdom and Revelation has been given in the end times so the church would come to the knowledge of him now brother bandam says see that was the thing that Daniel did he understood by the books now when we say this he understood by books Daniel was actually reading Jeremiah he was reading the former Prophet that had been in front of them and had prophesied that they would be down in in Babylon for 70 years and as he read these prophecies amen he began to understand them for his season or his day amen Daniel begin to understand by the reading of the books now brother randam said he was reading Jeremiah the 25th chapter amen and in the book of Jeremiah amen it said the word of the Lord was scattered across the world and it had the words of God was like wine to the people they had power they had reality and Jeremiah took the word of the Lord and it was as a wine and the power of that wine it was intoxicating the words that Jeremiah had said can you imagine Daniel drinking the words of Jeremiah 70 years in Babylon 70 years in captivity and he starts drinking in the revelations of Jeremiah my how he's how he must have become intoxicated with liberty and with freedom and the knowledge that this this Babylonian kingdom was coming to an end and there would be a great uh Exile of the Church of the Living God back to original worship amen it was intoxicating by these things now brother brandom tells us this again in Gabriel's instructions it see if there ever was a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray amen for his true servants we see by the letters of the Apostles and by the warning of the holy spirit that we are in the last day now here brother brandom says I understand here he is as Daniel he's just placed himself as a Daniel in the end time reading the letters of the Apostles and he said I understand that there will come scoffers in the last days now now you you here's the beauty is uh understanding is power understanding is power when you really understand and it brings power into your life it's just like maybe somebody comes against the message of the hour so you would start questioning the message because of someone scoffing the message but see if you understand that somebody has got to scoff this message that the Bible said scoffers shall come in the last days so don't let someone scoffing the message shake you up amen because they're supposed to be there amen somebody said something to brother brandom about people was thinking he was deity you know and and brother bam says amen he says well they're not as far off as you think amen but he he told one man he said well I would question my Ministry if they wasn't there see because they was there with Jesus amen amen every time the ministry of Christ has been on the earth you've had all these same spirits and when you start understanding that there has to be the spirits in their places and you understand oh you're just fulfilling that position but see God didn't give us that position he gave us as a position of a Believer amen and you see there's got to understand there shall come scoffers in the last days now there also will come Nation against nation and brother Bram said I understand there'll be tidal waves I understand there'll be fearful sights in the skies flying saucers there will have mysterious lights men's Hearts will fail for fear there'll be perplexities of times and distress and he said and I've read of the organizations and denominations and confederations I understand that women will Bob off their hair in the last day amen boy that was straight up wasn't it he said I understand they'll wear short clothes and walk in high heeled shoes tinkling as they go I understand the morale will be very low in the last day I understand the preachers will be false shepherds in the last day they'll compromise not to feed the people the word of God but go after Creeds and things instead I understand there'll be a voice coming the last days but it'll be crying out of the Wilderness calling the people back to the original message back to the things of God I understand by the books these things are to take place I understand that there will come a famine and the churches will get so organized and everything in the last days that there will come a famine not for the bread and water but for the hearing of the word of God Amen I tell you brother man said if there ever was a nation it was America they had plenty to eat he said but the famine was for the hearing of the true word of God and it's not that there's not preaching right amen there's more Ministry today there's more preaching there's more churches there's more religion than there's ever been but why is there a famine because there's a spirit of confusion that has come in the last days and confuse the people about what to believe about the word they can see the prophet's message but people say well this this and it means this and it means that so people don't know what to believe that's why people are hungry today if they could just believe the prophet they would have a barrel full of meal that would never run dry there is a there is life in the message of the hour but see Satan has brought a famine in the land but the Bible said it would come because of the spirit of confusion now look at this amen the spirit of confusion will knock people away from reality it'll knock it away from it in and people will not be able to feed upon it amen because they won't know what to believe do you see why Paul was saying I'm praying that the people will have the spirit of wisdom and of knowledge in the last day because there will be another group of people that will be confused and though they have the whole word of God they will set hungry because they will not eat the true word of God believing that it's something else you see I understand there'll come famines and it'll be for the the true word of God and people will go from the East to the West Amen to hear the true word of God but churches will be so organized that they'll tighten up and they'll fail to hear it I understand in the last day that there'll be a branch rise out of David now look at the beauty this he said the churches are going to get organized he said but there'll come a branch out of David look what he says he said I understand that he'll send Elijah I don't know that I've ever tied them scriptures together but there'll come a branch amen out of David behold I send unto you Elijah amen what is it the heart of the children will be turned back to the father's the original amen now if you're going to if you're going to Open the Eyes of the people there has to be a dealing with a heart amen the message of the hour is not an intellectual message it is a heart turning message amen and your eyes are directly connected to your heart in 2 Corinthians the 3D chapter Paul said though they still read the words of Moses which speaks of Jesus plainly we all know that but when they read it they read it with a veil over their hearts we know that they they've crucified their very Messiah having the word of God and crucified their Messiah because they had a lack of knowledge of who they were dealing with the Bible said had they had known they would not have crucified him but they did not know because they were blinded but they were blinded by prophecy are you with me they were blinded by prophecy Isaiah said having eyes they wouldn't see and having ears they wouldn't hear but blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear amen God give us the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and knowledge of what God is doing in our generation I understand that there would come amen a prophet in the last days according to Malachi chapter 4 5 and 6 brother Ram says see here it is he said see amen he hasn't done this before and the reason he hasn't see because it was put off for another day but in the last days the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known the church the revelation of the word of God do you know there's nothing of Greater prevailing power than Revelation the Bible said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it Revelation is the most prevailing thing that you can get a hold of when you get Revelation it surpasses amen your emotional state it surpasses the conditions of anything that you're living in Revelation is the supreme power over everything else that's in this life Revelation amen is that which gives Mercy I think it's beautiful when you're reading second Peter and Peter is drawing out what a perfect man is amen it it's beautiful cuz he starts that that with faith and he starts building the church up under faith and then he comes to the third part and he says but we got to add under the church knowledge and I thought it was mighty because amen you know it seeming like knowledge is something uh that that can I just say it this way it's something the devil got a hold of and he so Twisted it that sometimes Holy Ghost filled people hear the word knowledge and go to running backwards because they think you're trying to educate them but brother bam says but remember that tape he preaches lean not to thine own understanding right he says now Proverbs that Solomon was the wisest man of the world was not trying to say to his son to be illiterate he was just saying when your knowledge comes in in conflict with the knowledge of God let your knowledge go amen and believe the things of God Amen so watch we not to our own understanding didn't mean we shouldn't have an understanding but the Bible said with all thy getting get understanding and if if the people perish they perish because of a lack of knowledge amen we need the knowledge of God in us to be a perfect man and that knowledge that I'm talking about it's when Isaiah cries out in Isaiah 28 and said Whom Shall we teach knowledge brother mam said give Revelation amen and then ties it directly with the rest that it causes the weary to rest when we talk about knowledge we're talking about God's knowledge there is a worldly knowledge and it's a foolishness to God and there's a knowledge but there's a knowledge to judge right from wrong there is a knowledge amen of virtue and faith that you judge whether the word is right or wrong see then brother Ram said you can lay aside all Creeds and all your unbelief and you claim you have done see then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie let every man's word leave see the kind of knowledge we need it is a supreme knowledge knowing that God cannot lie whatever else you know in your life know this God cannot lie amen that's the knowledge that the church really needs this morning is that God cannot lie amen I think of brother brandom he said see Abraham had knowledge he said God is able to perform that which he has promised that's the kind of knowledge we need that can rise up and say God is able e stones to rise children unto Abraham if you really know God if you really have a knowledge of God you know God can't lie but God can do everything else he can't fail but he can do everything else because he's God now this knowledge amen that God is does not contradict the knowledge amen uh of his word let me just say this it's a heaven born knowledge it's a spiritual knowledge it's a knowledge of his word brother B says which is not added but but which is grown out of the heart like a peacock feather's grown out of a peacock or a dove feather's grown out of a dove feather you can't add it to you right you you can't add it to you like you can't take it and stick it in you amen I I always loved how brother Bram said it he said you can't take Dove feathers and stick them in a black bird and have a dove right cuz when pressure comes the feather just falls out but you can't take a dove feather and stick it at a dove either a dove has to grow its feathers and the Church of the Living God has to grow Knowledge from the seed that God put in their heart because our God is the god of knowledge Our God knows everything about everything amen it was amazing in the days of Daniel when the king asked and he and he needed some information and the wise men didn't know it and and the susers didn't know it amen but God Amen was the god of knowledge and he was Daniel's God and he had knowledge and understanding of how to interpret the things and our God Amen is a god of knowledge he is a God I believe brother random says it's a genuine Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with an amen isn't it beautiful amen can I say this your adherence to the word of the age is how much power you have you say the truth sets me free I'll tell you this the truth you know sets you free the truth in this Bible is not what's setting you free it's the truth that's come to your heart that has set you free this Bible has been written for 2,000 years but until this knowledge comes into your heart Amen Let me let me just say this we need knowledge of him who is God Amen that can change every situation you see amen you can always tell a person by their knowledge of God how they approach things because sometimes you can come to situations and you'll say well there's no hope in this amen without God there's no hope right without God there's no hope without God there's no change but if you know God you know it doesn't there's not a situ situation that cannot be changed if you know God you know that no matter what it looks like there's a God that can step on the scene and brother Roshan can change a family he can change a situation he can change hearts and minds and lives amen there is nothing too hard for our God I say all things are possible with our God and if we get a revelation in the knowledge of him listen it starts taking away our nervousness it takes away amen that Spirit of depression it takes away that Spirit of hopelessness if you're looking at a situation you said brother way I can't find any hope I pray God give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him and that knowledge will overcome every nervous spirit in this building that revelation will bind every devil in this building this morning God my God he can overcome every situation every devil can fall at his feet come on I know I I I I'm I'm a man I live I've got family you got family we all got family amen we all got situations there's all social and and there's there's all kinds of situations isn't there amen but let me say this amen as long as God is here there is nothing that cannot be changed and let me say this again if you're facing this intellectually and your knowledge and your own personal and you got your hands on it and you're trying to fix it that's really what's wrong with it to begin with if you take your hands off of it and let the god of Mercy begin to work he can change it he can change everything sometimes it's a it's a a it's an underestimation can we just be honest we underestimate the abilities of God many times we underestimate it because you know it's kind of like a little boy bringing a tractor to his daddy amen he he's got a little broke got a little broke piece of a toy and he brings it to his dad said dad fix this and and and then the whole time he's holding it you know the whole time he's fooling with it amen if he just give it to Dad Dad could fix it and then he' give it back to him amen and if we sometimes just need to commit I'm tell you what a prophet said he said the greatest thing you ever done was a committal to God sometimes you need to commit it to God you need to commit it in prayer amen and then let the Holy Spirit begin to work amen and you might not know how God is doing it but let me proom promise you this our God is online even when you don't see him he's working you remember zachus the businessman well I'm preaching now I'm off my but y'all I'm I'm in the subject amen but zakus the businessman y'all remember him Amen brother man said watch zakus he said his wife had prayed for him many nights and she looked over there one night and he was restless and mean and and grouchy I'll put my words to it he got up fussing at her amen and brother man said she just laid over and started praising the Lord amen praising the Lord and your wife's grapping at you yeah because he his husband was gra and brother man said see she knew that God was moving on him and sometimes people get that way amen when they're trying to go their own way but the holy spirit is trying to turn him around and he won't let him go brother B said that's what happened to that man but God was working even when you don't know he's working and the situation starts looking like it's going a long ways off and and you get depressed and you get downhearted and you get to thinking I never will forget this as probably as long as I live I'll never forget this after uh Anna and Zach had three miscarriages brother Ron had told us thus sayith the Lord by Vision she was going to have a child amen I had had the Lord speak it directly to me listen to a tape out in Oklahoma amen so we had two or three different confirmations that God was going to give him a baby I'll never forget it I went out for a jog there in W Park and amen and and Carissa and Anna was in there and I seen Anna come up and she was balling and Carissa was balling and she said I'm going to take her out for a little while I come back and I was out and I was just jogging along and I was praying I said Lord I you made a promise to us I don't think these kids can take this again and I'm sitting here praying to the Lord and almost disappointed in what has happened and I jog back in the house and they hand me a little card and it's a card announcing the pregnancy them women was cuz they was excited and happy and and and here I'm thinking here I'm thinking that the whole world has come to an end and I'm ready to jump off a bridge amen and God was already working he he had already answered the prayer and may I say this morning that that same God is working in situations all over this building amen but the devil is trying to Blind your understanding to how God works and what he does and the situations listen I know we've called him out in prayer and there are situations that's been lingering for years but I say Satan we bind you in the name of Jesus Christ and we stand here this morning to announce that the god of Abraham is on the Move amen do you see knowledge of him I love it how how how the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and knowledge amen but watch how Paul breaks into this nurse verse and he said that the eyes of your understanding being in lightened or that your eyes of your heart be flooded with light woo brother that the heart let it be flooded with light now this this word enlightened here it it means to give light it it means not just a light but it means to give light like it is um uh when when something is shined into the eyes it it is giving light to the individual let me just take you to the scripture in Matthew 6 and22 these are the words of the Lord he said for the light of the body is the eye if therefore Thine Eyes shall be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil the whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in the darkness How Great is Thy Darkness I read it from The Book of Luke saying Luke 11:34 the light of the body is the eye therefore when the eye is single the whole body is full of light and when thine eye is evil the body also is full of Darkness now take heed therefore the light which is in thee be not Darkness isn't that amazing if thine whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doeth give light I love how this is spoken if the light of the body is the eye now this is speaking prophetic right to a church to a body of Believers to a to an end time group if the eye be single the whole body shall be full of light listen you don't have trouble till you have more than one voice you don't have trouble till you have more than one voice and I I want to say that in this in this second in this moment see I appreciate brother Ericson and the revelation God has given him and and and how somebody asked me one time said brother Wayne how's that going to work with you and brother Ray I said real good I said because Brother Ray will never say or do anything outside what brother Ram taught and as long as I don't ever do or say anything outside he taught there's a perfect harmony a perfect harmony so you only have one voice but see it's only when another voice tries to come into that that the trouble begins so let's just say you're you're you go back to the Garden of Eden that's a beautiful place beautiful fellowship and Eve was fellowshipping with the Lord but here come the serpent right and he took his at the Lord also said yeah or hath the Lord said you know I me he just twisted something just a little bit but it was that voice for the serpent that broke the fellowship in the garden eaten and and a Believer can have perfect fellowship with God Amen just easing along right under the message of the hour amen and watch and somebody will come along and say well I don't know if brother Bram was right about that I don't know if that was exactly how that ought to been now what they're doing is amen you think they're just offering you a little different idea but really what they're doing is they're raping and robbing your entire life now watch brother bam said he said when Eve fail for Satan's lie and she allowed that he said the whole world fa he said and so a church he said whenever amen that we receive something outside the word everything under it begins to fall amen you watch a family you watch a father start moving out of the word watch how it starts affecting the whole entire thing when Adam fell the whole world fell now amen what what am I speaking about I'm talking about the singleness of the eye amen if you just keep your eye I remember years ago somebody come and they they had the and and you forgive me if you believe this I I I can't believe it but but but there were some people uh who had this two Lord Doctrine and and they were telling me there was one God but there was two Lords and they took a bunch of quotes and they tried to make them match one another and they were telling me all their ideas of all this and I said but but don't you don't you listen to what brother random said about that and the man says to me this very thing he says well we used to listen to brother brother bam he said but it confuses us now and I said confuses you he said yeah well they was listening to a certain teacher and as long as they just listen to that teacher say what brother Bram said then there was no confusion but when they actually heard the prophet they was hearing something different than what was coming through the teaching and so there was a confusion he said he said well don't you get confused I said no sir I said I was confused till I heard brother bram's tape but when I heard brother eny straighten the whole thing out for me now I tell you how God works about a week later I was listening to a tape and brother Bram was on there he said there was one of my friends the other day with a group of guys and he said they said we don't listen to that William brandom he said because he confuses us and brother Bram said he spoke up and said well I was confused till I heard him yeah I said that's right that's right the Lord knew it was coming so so a lot of times the confusions that we're dealing with is not coming from from the message it's coming from what you're hearing maybe another preacher say and then you hear them say it and then you're listening to the tape and you go well that's not really what brother Braham said about that but don't be confused set aside what the brother said and believe what the word said that just makes things so easy when you're able because what is happening you have a single eye y'all y'all know what I'm talking about brother man said him and Billy Paul stopped and he said there was a anvelope out in the field and he said Billy handed me the binoculars and said here now watch he's looking through something he said look out there at that anvelope and he said when I pulled it up there were three of them out there yeah he said I pulled them down there was just one see looking through them lenses made it look a certain way that was not real but brother BR said but what they needed was a little focusing and sometimes you can look at something through somebody else's it's when somebody tried to teach me a a Doctrine one time on and I don't know where I'm at but God bless y'all y'all keep pulling amen somebody was trying to uh uh put this idea about this return Ministry and they were go they were going on and on about this return Ministry and I said well I tell you what you do just send me all them quotes yeah and I'll sit down and go over them brother Ed God bless you amen I said just I'll go over them and you know amen what they did they said well I just had to come and sit down and go over it with you I said you mean what I need out of them I can't get by the Holy Spirit I'm going to have to have you right amen uh one guy says to me he said uh uh uh they went to all tapes in a church and they don't believe in live Ministry anymore so they cornered one of my daughters at a place and they said well said uh uh what we should do is everybody sit down all the preachers and play tapes and they said well uh is that right they said yeah I think that's right my daughter comes into my office and one of them and she said to me she said Dad she said what do I do I said well you tell him this you tell him to give him all the quotes where brother Bram said that and you'll examine them but meanwhile you send all these quotes and ask him what he thinks about them and there's about 300 pages of quotes of what the prophet had to say about live Ministry and you know what there's not even one time that brother brandom said Ministry should sit down and let somebody else amen play a tape in the church amen do you see what it is it's only confusing if you're not willing to take it to the word of God Amen watch Martin y'all remember it back there with Martin amen when when he was a leader of that school and this guy come and said I got this light on me and I'm the ruler I'm the leader of everybody and they said well amen that's good let's go down and talk to Martin amen he didn't want to go down there he said he had a light the man was carrying a light but take it to the message of the age and see how well that light shines and they started dragging him down there and when they did the light went away amen and I found out if you just bring it back to the message of the hour that the teaching now the word of God will bring Clarity to the mind of the church you see what it is is the light of the body now here's the thing I love how the scriptures are read here it says thine whole body shall be full of light now y'all enjoy scriptural promises amen look in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 22 if thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light that's a promise shall be light Jesus says that shall be light now I love it because the Bible's going to prophesy this to us and it's going to be in Zechariah the 14th chapter it'll say that in the evening time there shall be light can can I just say this Zachariah was not living in an electrical age so he wasn't prophesying the electricity was coming he was talking about the manifestation of the scripture as it says in John chapter one it says that John was a light but he was not the light but Jesus was the True Light that lights every man in other words it was the scripture amen it wasn't John wasn't false light but he wasn't the True Light he wasn't the complete it's the same as brother random told us he said look I'm not him I'm not the one you seek but he's here he's in the midst of you amen when when you see that brother Brandon was a light for his season amen now now I know that could get a little sticky but let's just be let's just be honest here right there was Lutheran light and there was wesleyian light there was Pentecostal light amen and watch now and some people have tried to make that brandom light but brother brandom said I never come to do that at all he said I come to bring brid light he said I come to connect you to the headship which is the word turned on in this age amen it's an evening light can I just resay it so you catch my inspiration in the evening time there shall be light now watch this in the evening time scripture will be fulfilled light is the word Vindicated it is scripture it's the word made flesh in Zechariah 14:7 amen what is it talking about it's talking about in the evening time now the reason it calls it the evening time because the sun sets and the sun rises and the same Sun that was in the East is supposed to set in the west amen it's a beautiful thing if you ever see a good picture of a sunrise you can't tell the difference if it's sunrise or sunet amen because if you don't know the Direction you don't know the difference CU it's the same son and as the son of man Rose in the East so shall he manifest in the west as Lightning Cometh From the East and the West so shall the coming of the son of man be and in the setting of the Sun in Zachariah it shall be light in the evening time oh in second Peter chapter 1 I love how Apostle Peter brings this in if you uh in verse 19 if you're in a if you're a Bible student you study Matthew the 17th chapter Peter James and John were with Jesus when they went on Transfiguration right they went up there together and in second Peter chapter 1 the latter half of the scripture Peter is actually giving his version of what happened on that mountain am and when he begins to tell it in the in second Peter chapter 1 give me that 19 L here's Peter speaking of it he said we also have a more sure word of Prophecy now what's more sure than prophecy the Fulfillment thereof now how many people had read Isaiah and thought that was the Virgin or that was the case or that was and how many sermons had said this is this and this is this but the sure word is fulfillment we're unto you that you take heed as a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts amen you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about Vindicated word in your heart amen you ever let Vindicated word get in your heart and they'll never stop the Saints of the Living God with Vindicated word in their hearts amen it's a day star that arises in your hearts if you wonder about it read the next verse the 20th verse explains it knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation it don't matter what anybody said Isaiah was Jesus fulfilled it don't matter what anybody says Malachi 4 means brother Brandon fulfilled it don't matter what anybody thinks about Ephesians 5 that there'll be a glorious Church somebody has the interpretation of that right now this morning amen what is it it's a day star that arises in the heart can I give you scripture here Isaiah the 60th chapter now the heart flooded with light let's get some light can we Amen in second Peter it's a day star it's the Fulfillment of the word in Isaiah chapter 60 let's watch the first verse of Isaiah 60 arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee my let's go down to for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee as the glory shall be seen upon thee the next verse and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and to the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising isn't that beautiful arise and shine thy light has come the bride light has arrived in the end time it is the bride light that we were looking for Isaiah 60 veres 1 to3 watch 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and the 6th verse here's another example for God who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness my goodness isn't it something when there was no light at all God said let there be light now where is the source of light you asked yourself that if there is complete darkness where do you get light but the source of all light is the word of God in the beginning God spoke and said let there be light if there's any light in this age it will have to come from the word of God the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ watch the next verse in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 8 and then shall the wicked be revealed and whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy him with the brightness of his coming amen go to uh Revelation 8 and verse 4 amen verse one down to four amen shall destroy with the brightness of his coming Amen in Revelations 18 sorry verses 1 to 4 amen and the whole earth the Bible said would be lighted with his glory and I saw an angel come down from heaven sounds like Revelations 10 don't it having a great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and the Earth was lighted with his glory if you read the fourth verse it said come out of my people and be not partakers and brother Ram says that's the seventh angel messenger he brought a light that would lighten this entire planet if the people's hearts were open there's enough light this morning to flood every heart in this loud to see and age no man would have to live in darkness there is no excuse for a Believer this morning setting in darkness there is a light that has come that is a light that will destroy Satan come on now I'm in the Bible if the word made flesh is light yes sir can we get on that word made flesh is light then in in the Book of John it said he was manifested he was manifested you know why he was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and brother if you want to destroy the Devil put some light on the works of the enemy you can have the best set of eyes in the world but if you're sitting in darkness it don't matter you yeah I know y'all know what I'm talking about you ever laid in bed at night and you looked up and seen a shadow and something hanging on the door and man you just about need to crawl under the bed you know am but if you turn the light on it wasn't what you thought it was at all but the light is what changed it the situation never changed but the light shed light on it and revealed to you what you were doing and I'll tell you this amen if God's going to send light in this end time there had to be a eye to catch that light now let me let me just say this if you was blind this morning and you just just shut your eyes just just it don't matter how much light you pour in this building if you're blind light doesn't do no good right yeah it does you no good at all because the eye is the way light gets into the body light has no other access than through the eye amen so brother brandom tells us as a church body we're not in the foot age right he said we're not in the hip age we're not in the shoulder age he said we're not even in the age of the tongues of the Pentecostal Church speaking he said we've moved up into the eye see what good would it do for God to send light if there was no Prophet on the earth to receive the light when it come oh I thank God this morning to know that there was a true Prophet on the earth and when a light began to shine into the Earth that light was not coming from brother brandham he was just there when God began to do these things and bring light to the situation amen I thank God this morning to see amen that there had to be light and it was in the evening time now what light is going to do is light is going to shine on your needs now Sister Kimberly amen I love how the Bible is written and it says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son isn't it beautiful now he gave his only begotten son that nobody should perish is that right isn't it amazing that the blood that Jesus said and I don't think anybody could disagree with this it saves everybody it saves the whole world even a child that dies before the age of a account saved because the sin of the world is what Adam and Eve did and the blood covers everybody if somebody dies without receiving the blood then they go into the presence of God without the blood and that's when they're really in trouble with God but right now there's a blood covering the whole earth and everybody's under that blood that's the scripture amen and everybody's under that blood you say well then preacher what are you talking about then the Bible said but that but there some that didn't believe upon the name of the only begotten son because they love Darkness more than they love light now C can y'all can y'all handle if I get into something a little bit here look look in John 3 uh look in John 3 want show you something it's very beautiful here it this is this is so powerful look in John chapter 3 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn The World Isn't that beautiful but that he the world through him might be saved that he believeth on him not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he ha not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God so everybody said well as long as you say Jesus everybody saved but what is the name now if you go back in the scripture this is beautiful because the the Bible said you can only Worship in the gate where he put his name there's a lot of gates there's a lot of churches there's a lot of Creeds there's a lot of thoughts but you can only worship where he puts his name now now y'all are students of this message and brother B said a name of God is the word interpreted in that age it is a manifestation of that name that's why he preaches the message Look Away to Jesus and then tells five manifestations of the Third where God is fulfilling his word is where his name is come on church amen his name is his word manifested in that age now I'll tell you what brother ramam says in the first seal buckle your seat belts now he said when the when the when the Thunder sounded he said he received a new name he said now he says watch he said that's the reason they're out here hollering Jesus and they're not getting anything people said well that's not possible is it not Elijah in his day on the mountain amen called out for God under the revelation of Jehovah and those other men called for God under the revelation of Baal and this denominational system is calling the name of Jesus but they're doing it under the understanding of a horse system and they're worshiping the devil and don't even know they're doing it and you try to give them light but they love their Creeds more than they love the word of God now we might as well go ahead and say it amen everybody said love love got to love everybody but the Bible said that they receive the spirit of of delusion because they love not the truth come on folks the truth must have you must have a love for truth A Love For Truth is what will carry the church Beyond Creeds and dogmas and ideas brother I tell you I'm very loyal to my church well God bless you for being loyal but I'm not asking you to be loyal to a church I'm asking you to be faithful for Christ when you enter in I want him to say to you Levi thou are a good and a faithful servant I don't want him to say you've been a loyal member of the church what if the church leaves the word the prophet said leave the church I'm going to tell you what the prophet said he said if the oh God follow it follow the man he said but when the man leaves the word now you said why would you do that because there has to be a love of Truth are we married to the preacher or are we married to Christ are we married to the church or are we married to Christ I tell you who I married I remarried the revealed word of the Hour his name is Jesus Christ I'm not married to a bunch of doctrines and a bunch of ideas Jesus is a person and he's here this this morning he's a man turning on the Lights of the church that's why they wasn't get nothing they're saying Jesus but they're not getting it somebody said well brother Wayne that's not hardly you know everything's done through the I know but what Jesus you talking about you talking about the Methodist one the Baptist one the Lutheran One y'all know I'm telling you the truth come accept Jesus and then walk away Bob hered and Brites and go ahead hooped earrings and make up and shout and holler Y and brother Bram said dead thus saith the Lord dead that's tough stuff ain't it it's true brother B said when you cut yourself off from the word you're dead yeah right now watch because that's exactly what Satan wants to do is pull you by your human emotions human emotion and pulled away from the word of God I I think it's powerful when you start seeing that brother Braham said they call but they wasn't get nothing because he had received a new name under the revelation of the seals it revealed the new name of the Lord now it's it didn't change it his name is still Jesus but you finally understand who he really is Right amen he's he's the real the real Jesus yeah we could say this could the real Jesus stand up you see what what we're what we're dealing with is is we're dealing with a real G now if if you if you wonder about my Revelation on that check Matthew 25 there's five wise virgins and five foolish virgins and they're all virgins and they all believe y amen but they didn't get the oil did they and brother Bram said he he exactly typed it he said the ones under Elijah got something he said because when the Vindicated word struck there was a voice sounded out behind them and said our God is God right but the other on screamed hollered beat their altars didn't get nothing oh my and brother BR said the Bible said they wouldn't in the end time they're looking for the oil goes to Matthew 25 he said they don't get the oil right see they're they're not that's that's a deep subject I know but what they didn't do is they didn't go on with the word simply they didn't go on with the word now when you see this then you see the scriptures are saying that they're condemned already now there's enough atonement and we we could take scripture and prove it but I'll just say I think you believe it easily there's enough atonement save everybody that's right one drop of the blood of Jesus saves everybody everybody's saved then why does Isaiah say that we'll have to enlarge the borders of hell why does the bible plainly say there will be many yeah there'll be many called but few are chosen and he starts talking about the idea that people go to hell so somebody says well why is God send anybody to hell he don't brother he don't send anybody to Hell amen now with that atonement how How would be possible now John says we walk in the light as he is in the light and we have fellowship with him we walk in the light as he's in the light so you're moving you're moving in the mercy you're moving in the Revelation and as he moves you move you walk in the light now what happens if the light goes off in the book of Hebrews the scripture says that whenever they turned there was no more sacrifice for their sin what happened to the sacrifice it wasn't that somebody carried it off it's that they moved into darkness and they can no longer see the atonement see the light the light is shining is shining on it let me let me just bring this into a reality the light that shines in your heart it lets you see the atonement and if you go back to the scripture watch what brother Bram will say here or the scripture when the Lord he'll say this he say now you be careful that your light be not Darkness I got some good quotes don't have time to read them you be careful that your light be not Darkness now what what's that speaking of people's Revelation now brother Bram takes Adam and Eve in the garden and he goes that they came and the devil gave a revelation to Eve right the Bible says and she saw she saw it she saw what the devil as to make one wise it's always marveled me cu the devil can't make a wise virgin but she said he made he can make us wise and brother Bram said she caught new light and that new light's what plunged her into darkness yeah amen see what she the understanding she caught plunged her away from the atonement let me let me just say somebody says to you well there's no more there's the the baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't real anymore you accept that in your heart and it'll plunge you into a place of Darkness right and people all around you can be experiencing the power of God but you'll set in darkness because what you've accepted darkened your understanding somebody say well God just don't speak in tongues anymore now here's the thing God still does and people still will but you're not involved see God will still moveed the same as he's always moved amen just like the Lutheran sitting there saying God don't do them things anymore and brother Bram standing there saying your name is so and so and your name is so and so and this is h and a worldwide Revival and the Lutheran saying it don't happen it can't happen but it was happening anyhow but to them that opened their hearts to it the light was flooding their hearts and they were believing the word of God listen if if the Twisted words of a man could plunge a person into darkness into confusion what happens if that heart is opened up to the true word of God then a person setting in darkness can be drugg right out into the greatest Revival that has ever struck the planet a person who is completely involved in neurotics and and they're have you ever seen somebody in the grips of it they're just in the grips of it there's nothing they can do they're just they're just gripped by this dark thing but you let the Holy Ghost break in there and let an understanding strike that heart that there's a light coming to this age and God is still real and God is still true then what it'll do it'll Shake That believer it'll Shake That believer and it'll open their eyes to things that are literally Open the Eyes of our heart Lord our understanding it is a spiritual understanding amen can can I just I I take you on a trip with Elijah and and and Gaza and you think there's a lot of enemies have you ever been there everything's against me everybody's against me amen everything's all everything's around me but you know what brother Eric there was something come from that Prophet when he said Lord open this boy's eyes that he might be able to see amen he didn't do anything but open his eyes and when his eyes were open he was enlightened to the idea that there were angels in this building isn't it something there were angels in the building I've always loved to speak about that a little bit because one thing I found out those angels didn't do anything in that battle brother Levi the Angels didn't get in the battle at all but they gave an assurance to the man who was in the battle that God was with them and the same God that opened the eyes of Gaza is the same God that blinded the eyes of the king of Syria can you imagine they were standing looking at Elijah and they didn't even know it God can open one man's eyes and blind another they can stand and look at the very answer and not know they're looking at it Amen brother B said I would rather be naturally blind as spiritually blind because you can't see anything God has when you're spiritually blind but let me say something this morning I thank God that it's written in the Book of Revelations amen that what we should pray for is ISA that we might be able to see I don't know if you ever read Revelations 3 over Ephesians 1 but it's a beautiful read but that we might have eyesa we might see so let's just let's just ask the prophet brother brandom if if we were in blind Le osia and we want eyesight how do we get it what do we pray for how do we pray that our eyes would come open brother Bram says it he says this is what you what you would do he said see when I was a kid he said my daddy was a a Trapper and he'd TR rat Coons and he would take the lard off of the and put in a A can y'all know how grease is it'll it'll harden up when it gets cold you know and he said there'd be a can of that grease sitting over there and and he said because we lived in a house with draft and he said we lay in the bed he said cold draft come in he said' when we woke up in the morning our eyes would be matted shut y'all ever had any mat in your eyes uh it's it's it's something's a matter right or something it's something matter them eyes is matted up and and and brother R said when we woke up we couldn't see he said so they would go over and get the Kung grees and he said we'd heat it up on the stove a bit he said because it needs to be heated up good before it's applied to the ey he said then we'd take a little that and we'd start wiping he said in that Co grease would wipe that offer he said matter of fact he said it's pretty much a fix all he said we put it on the seals of our shoes and he said we put it on this and do this he said done all kinds of wonderful things it was about a fix all and then brother Bram turns and he said and you know what he said here in the Church of La osia there's been a cold spell and he said many eyes have been maded shut he said but we're going to have to have more than kung GRE to open these eyes he said we're going to need the Holy Ghost he said so what should we do he said heat it up real good I know people don't like them heating up services but once in a while we need to heat it up a little good amen you come into the house of God and every devil Out of Hell sitting on you trying to fight with the service and you feel the pressure of it and you feel the oppression well I tell you if you could see it what it is it's dark spirits that don't want to see the service get so high because evil does not want to see the Holy Ghost ruling in the Church of the Living God but if you start heating it up a little bit amen and you start heating that Spirit up say how do I do it brother with a Hallelujah and a glory to God and Devil you can't have my service amen it's going to be a good morning in the Holy Spirit and when you start heating it up start putting it on the eyes and brother B said eyes start coming open eyes start coming open I'll tell you what brother B said what we need is that Holy Ghost amen we need a fix all don't we and I believe the Holy Ghost is a fix all to the Church of the Living God and look what he says he says what he was doing brother Bram says what he's doing is the Holy Ghost has to get in to the heart to fix the eyesight Luke 24 you've read the story two's walking on the road to EMAs and Jesus appears to them who is he he's everything he promised to be they couldn't see it so he took them in a little room in the evening and he broke bread and them that were slow to understand their eyes come open when he got inside their eyes come open brother BR said that's exactly what opened Peter's eyes that was exactly what opened the woman at the well what opened her eyes he says what has this message did for your eyes if if it opened their eyes in that day won't it open your eyes in this day you said preacher how to open eyes open your heart and say Lord come on in this Heart come in my heart brother man said don't let him stand at the front door he said invite him on in and there's doors down there there brother Bram said there's doors of every kind of door in there he said but one of them doors is your sight he said so invite him into your sight yeah amen and even if a man was naturally blind the Holy Spirit could bring a sight to him this morning it would bring a vision our musicians would come this morning even even if a man was naturally blind yeah he could receive spiritual vision there's nobody probably of a better example in scripture than Samson right oh yeah yeah man a good side man with great strength he laid his head in the lap of Thea too many times and gave away his secret so what is the secret of the church the Holy Ghost and every time you lay your head in the lap of intellectualism it's just emotion yeah it's just work up why them people uneducated and unco shout and hollering go lay your head in it and after a while the Bible said they bind him he'd rise up he' break the binds but he finally gave that secret away that separated that separated to God and they shaved it off of him brother M said they put out his eyes and he stayed that way way and you would have thought his purpose was over right but brother BR said if you watch the story of Samson brother bam tells it a lot he's really talking about the Pentecostal church that's really what he's talking about and he says it stands just as big and powerful As It Ever Was he said and when elij when uh when Samson come out that day he said he was the same size he always was he had the same arms the same fingers the same legs he said he had every member there he said but there was no strength in his members there was no sight in his eyes but what he did was is he said Lord avenge me these my eyes yeah amen avenge me my sight God let me be Avenged for somebody stripping away my ability to see the thing things of God can you imagine he was captive to the very thing he was built up to [Music] destroy yeah right he was telling them Pentecostals you're entering organization and you were raised to destroy it but while he stood there he said take me to the to the strongholds of this building brother Bram said something was going on in that man he began to remember remember when God was real to him and he said the first thing he done is went to it in his mind he said then it become a reality he felt back brother Bram said this brother Tom is a beautiful a beautiful story because brother Bram says the whole time there was something growing back and he said if Samson could ever reach back there and fill those locks he would know that the Covenant was restored amen now this is powerful brother BR preaching you go hear him he does it different places and he stops and just starts Discerning somebody brother Mike he said do you feel the locks he starts exercising that gift of discernment he said church do you feel the locks the Covenant is still there brother BR said he was standing there as a blind man thank you Jesus but he caught a vision that it was possible to be restored he caught the vision that a prayer meeting could change things he caught the vision that another Acts 2 was possible and when he caught that Vision that's when he destroyed the works of the enemy and look what he did do you think the purpose of God Was Defeated God's purpose is never defeated amen right if his purpose was to kill Philistines Brother David he killed more in his death than he did in his life if God's purpose was to kill Philistines his purpose was greater fulfilled that day than it had been in his entire life and I'll tell you something this morning God can avenge your eyes God can Avenge the situations and maybe you've laid your head in somebody's lap and they've yeah they've done all they could do to strip from you the good things of God well brother bram's wrong here after all and he he counted this many people and he said 300 and should have been [Music] 500 I wish you'd let me ask the questions so for the 150,000 Miracles that was done in the first year who did that man or God for 8,300 times that William brandham stood there and said your name is so and so and you're from so and W and sometimes up to 17 different things yeah who did that he never missed it one time but don't want to talk about that well the crowd was 300 and it should
