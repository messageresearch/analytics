[3:11] Oh, you
[3:13] [Music]
[3:27] [Music]
[3:31] my we so love him this morning. Amen.
[3:35] When we were yet unlovable,
[3:38] he loved us.
[3:41] The prophet said it was completely apart
[3:43] from human merit.
[3:46] It was an elective love.
[3:49] He said, "Wherein has you loved us?" He
[3:51] said, "Have you not read that Jacob I
[3:54] loved and Esau I hated before they were
[3:57] ever even born."
[3:59] [Music]
[4:00] Oh, his love. It's so different than the
[4:04] love of man. That's right. But he was so
[4:07] so much love he gave us that he loved us
[4:10] and he begat us in love till we begin to
[4:13] love him. Amen. I I'm so thankful for
[4:16] him this morning and so thankful to each
[4:19] of you and Amen. What a what a
[4:21] tremendous time. Such a such a a good
[4:25] atmosphere and feeling this morning. We
[4:27] so love you all. And I just wonder maybe
[4:29] we just bow our heart for a moment for a
[4:31] word of prayer. Amen. We we just want to
[4:34] go to him this morning. Father, it is
[4:37] such an honor to be able to speak your
[4:39] name among your
[4:41] children. Lord, to see them gathered
[4:44] together on a Sunday morning looking
[4:46] Lord to you for all the grace and the
[4:50] mercy that you give. I'm so thankful for
[4:53] the tender hearts, Lord. For these men
[4:56] of God that you have, the gifts that you
[4:58] have placed here in this assembly, Lord.
[5:01] They desire greatly to take this
[5:04] wonderful word and to speak it out among
[5:07] the people, Lord, and to shed the light
[5:09] of this gospel, Father. It's it's a it's
[5:12] a great burden of our souls and our
[5:15] hearts. And Lord, there's a last one
[5:17] somewhere there, Lord. There's a work to
[5:20] be done. And I I thank you for people of
[5:22] like mind, Lord, for this this gospel to
[5:25] go out and to help and to strengthen,
[5:27] Lord. But we've gathered here this
[5:29] morning, Lord, in this place. And we're
[5:31] asking you that you would just come now,
[5:34] Lord. May the angels of God fill the
[5:37] room. And Lord, may they just stack in
[5:40] here among us and much such faith and
[5:42] such expectation be built in each heart.
[5:45] Lord, may there come an understanding
[5:47] and a revelation. Lord, may you release
[5:50] your anointing to take us higher in your
[5:52] word today, Lord. Father, build faith in
[5:55] our souls to know it's exactly true. Oh
[5:58] God, we're asking you now that you would
[6:00] lead us. Bring a healing to the body.
[6:03] Bring salvation to souls, Lord. Bring
[6:05] faith, Lord. Lord, for rapture. We ask
[6:08] it now in the mighty name of Jesus
[6:11] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. And God
[6:15] bless you this morning. Amen. We want
[6:17] to, if we can, to turn into the book of
[6:19] Revelations, the sixth chapter, the
[6:21] first four verses. And when the lamb had
[6:24] opened one of the seals, and I heard as
[6:27] it was the n the noise of a
[6:31] thunder, one of the four beasts saying,
[6:35] "Come and
[6:36] see." And I saw, and behold, a white
[6:39] horse, and he that said on him had a
[6:42] bow, and the crown was given unto him,
[6:46] and he went forth conquering, and to
[6:50] conquer. And when he had opened the
[6:53] second
[6:54] seal, I heard the second beast say,
[6:58] "Come and
[6:59] see." And there went out another horse
[7:02] that was red, and power was given to
[7:05] him that set thereon to take peace from
[7:08] the earth, and that they should kill one
[7:12] another, and there was given to him a
[7:15] great sword. God bless his word. As you
[7:18] can be seated this morning, I would like
[7:20] to continue this revelation's contained
[7:24] under the seals. Um I I I I know that
[7:28] each of you are students of the message
[7:30] and I know you uh you know these things.
[7:32] Some of these things are very um
[7:34] repetitive. Amen. But I just want to to
[7:37] draw in a few things this morning. Uh
[7:40] it's here in this part of uh the the
[7:43] opening of the seals. It's this part of
[7:45] the word where brother Brandham is
[7:47] discussing with us the great revelation
[7:50] uh of of this horse rider and its uh and
[7:54] its stages of its ride. And I uh I'm
[7:58] struck of course by the by the uh
[8:00] realities that in each one of these
[8:02] seals that each one of them says that
[8:05] there is a beast that would say come and
[8:07] see. Now, in reading that and in then
[8:10] looking into what we're headed to this
[8:13] morning, when you say the word beast, um
[8:15] it you have to be uh a little definitive
[8:18] with that word. And because of the
[8:20] opening of the seals, now we understand
[8:23] what that word is here in Revelation 6
[8:25] and how it differs from other places.
[8:28] You find it in the book of Revelations.
[8:30] uh when you're looking at symbology in
[8:32] Revelation chapter 4, when you uh look
[8:34] in the sixth to the 7th verse, you'll
[8:36] find uh that this uh this this
[8:39] particular thing that he's speaking of
[8:41] in Revelation 6 is recorded in
[8:42] Revelations 4. And it said, "Before the
[8:44] throne, there was a sea of glass lacked
[8:46] under crystal. And in the midst of the
[8:48] throne, round about the throne, there
[8:50] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[8:52] behind. And the first beast was like a
[8:55] lion. And the second beast was like a
[8:57] calf. And the third beast was had the
[9:00] face as a man. And the fourth was like a
[9:04] flying eagle. So this word uh beast here
[9:07] in Revelation 6. And one of the beasts
[9:09] say come and see. When he says that word
[9:12] beast there, it actually is speaking
[9:14] here of the four creatures that's around
[9:17] the throne. Now in Revelation chapter 4,
[9:20] brother Bannon will actually teach us
[9:21] this and he'll say this. He says this
[9:23] here where it says in chapters uh
[9:26] talking about the beast. Of course,
[9:27] there's two different ones, right? There
[9:29] is the word atherion which is found in
[9:33] the Greek. Now in English, you hear the
[9:35] word beast, but in the Greek it actually
[9:38] is the word theion which is found in
[9:40] Revelations 13 and also found in
[9:43] Revelation 17 when it describes the
[9:45] beast of the Bible. Amen. The word
[9:48] theionon is a Greek word which means a
[9:50] wild and untamed beast. Brother Bram
[9:53] said there it is wild and untamed. Amen.
[9:56] I love how brother Bam says it. He says
[9:59] untamed. He says woo untamed. In other
[10:02] words, it can't be brought under the
[10:05] word. It can't be brought under the
[10:06] headship. It it's a beast. It's it's
[10:08] it's a theion. But then brother Bram
[10:10] says but here of course it is entitled a
[10:13] zoo which means a creature a four living
[10:17] creatures not the beast of the wild
[10:19] theion but zoo is a living creature.
[10:23] Amen. Now brother Ram says it's best to
[10:25] call them a living creature because
[10:26] they're not angels they're not elders
[10:28] they're living creatures. You could also
[10:30] entitle them basically as an anointing.
[10:33] Now, by reading in Revelations chapter
[10:36] 6, you're going to see four different
[10:38] seals that are introduced by a beast.
[10:40] And each one of these are represented in
[10:43] Revelations 4 as those living creatures.
[10:46] Amen. We know that of course there's
[10:48] four of them. So, it's speaking of an
[10:50] earthly number dealing with humanity.
[10:53] And these powers will reflect in the
[10:55] earth. Amen. The number four is also
[10:57] reflected in deliverance. Amen. Most of
[11:00] the time you're dealing with ones and
[11:02] threes and sevens, but when you get into
[11:04] the number four, you're dealing with
[11:05] with the earth. And brother Ram says,
[11:07] "So it's is dealing with deliverance.
[11:09] It's dealing with the deliverance of the
[11:11] people on the earth." Of course, this
[11:13] was uh what we found out when the son of
[11:16] man descended into the fire in the days
[11:18] of the three Hebrew children. He was the
[11:20] fourth man in the fire. And that's where
[11:23] the deliverance came along. We find that
[11:25] this is the Amen. On the fourth day is
[11:28] when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.
[11:30] Amen. And if you're a reader of the book
[11:32] of Joel, you you'll know the Bible
[11:35] prophesies that there'll be a
[11:37] restoration in the last days. And there
[11:39] was four bugs that eat from the tree of
[11:41] life. But there's also four that brings
[11:44] restoration. And brother says, of
[11:46] course, that's justification,
[11:48] sanctification, the Holy Ghost. He said,
[11:50] but that last word is the word. The last
[11:53] stage of it is when it comes back to the
[11:56] word. So when full restoration comes, it
[11:59] comes under the word. Amen. So this is a
[12:02] number of the earth which is speaking of
[12:04] the number of deliverance. If you're a a
[12:06] Bible student and you've watched the
[12:07] tribes of Israel, you know that the 12
[12:10] tribes were divided in four quadrants or
[12:13] in three quadr in four different
[12:15] quadrants with three in each one. And
[12:18] they would camp around uh the camp. And
[12:20] they would camp in the north four and
[12:22] the east four and in the south four and
[12:24] the west four. Amen. And these were
[12:27] entitled Judah. And they had a big
[12:29] banner of the lion. And then Ephraim
[12:31] would have a big banner of the ox. And
[12:33] Reuben would have a a banner of the man.
[12:36] And Dan in the north would be the eagle.
[12:38] So they would have a flag that would
[12:41] represent their quadrants and they would
[12:43] be they would be aligned this way
[12:45] showing that this this concept that God
[12:48] had of these creatures go all the way
[12:51] back to the garden of Eden when they
[12:54] left the garden of Eden. Remember that
[12:56] God put uh uh uh angels there protecting
[12:59] the way of the tree of life. Those same
[13:02] ones were put amen in the holies of
[13:05] holies on the ark of the covenant
[13:07] protecting something and then the tribes
[13:10] were camping in protection. Now these
[13:12] were all done and also we find them that
[13:15] these are also aligned perfectly in the
[13:18] gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[13:21] Amen. Showing them that Matthew that
[13:24] great lion. Amen. in if you're a a Bible
[13:27] uh studyer, you'll find out it's amazing
[13:29] even in the chronology of the genealogy
[13:33] of Jesus. Each one of these gospels
[13:35] began with Jesus as a certain way. And
[13:37] remember in Matthew it breaks down the
[13:40] king lineage, showing you that in the
[13:42] beginning he's dealing with the kingship
[13:44] of Jesus being Matthew as the lion, the
[13:48] king. In Mark, he talks about the
[13:50] servant of the public ministry of
[13:52] Christ. Mark is discussing the ox side
[13:55] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Luke is calling
[13:58] him the son of man and he shows the
[14:01] genealogy and how he starts with Adam to
[14:04] show his human side and then John. Amen.
[14:07] He don't start out with any humanity at
[14:09] all. He said in the beginning was the
[14:11] word. And so he begins to show the eagle
[14:14] anointing under that gospel. Amen. Now,
[14:17] what we find then is these these
[14:18] anointings or beasts that are
[14:21] representing the the ages and the
[14:22] revelations. As these seals begin to be
[14:25] opened, every time a white horse rides
[14:28] out, there's also a creature that will
[14:30] accompany that. And brother teaches us
[14:32] that what this is is it's Satan riding
[14:35] out in a ministry. And every time he
[14:38] does, God sends an anointing that will
[14:41] combat what that is, amen, upon it. In
[14:44] Isaiah 59 and 19, brother Bam discusses
[14:47] this scripture with this concept and he
[14:50] said, "So they that fear the name of the
[14:51] Lord from the west and the glory from
[14:53] the rise of the sun. For when the enemy
[14:56] shall come in like a flood,
[14:59] the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a
[15:02] standard against him." Amen. Someone
[15:05] mentioned these things the other day, a
[15:06] couple of them. So, I don't mean to
[15:08] repeat a bunch of this and but I do want
[15:10] to say this that these these these
[15:12] anointings are being sent for the
[15:14] protection of the church or that it
[15:17] would give you a a way to challenge
[15:20] whatever that is that was coming in
[15:22] there. Of course, in that first seal,
[15:23] when that first horse rider went out,
[15:26] we're reading it now with the thunder
[15:28] sounding, the symbols gone. And we know
[15:30] that was the antichrist teachings that
[15:33] was coming out just just after the the
[15:36] Pentecost. 30 years only, Jude started
[15:38] talking about false teachers coming.
[15:41] Amen. Peter started describing the the
[15:44] heresies that would be coming out. If
[15:45] you're a Bible reader, the book of Jude
[15:47] and the second puh book of Peter is
[15:50] almost uh identical because they're
[15:52] under that same line anointing of the
[15:55] ministry of Christ. That was a truth
[15:57] that was coming out against the wolves
[15:59] of Paul and the the the idolatry and the
[16:03] doctrines that were going to coming out.
[16:05] Amen. But you see that the truth of this
[16:08] against the Antichrist teachings, we're
[16:10] dealing with that white horse. But when
[16:12] this when this red horse starts coming
[16:14] out and this this ministry of Satan
[16:16] begins to change, God sends another
[16:19] anointing. And the anointing that he
[16:21] sends is the anointing of an ox which
[16:24] will allow the believers that are coming
[16:27] under this attack from Satan the ability
[16:31] to be able to stand in the midst of the
[16:33] trial, amen, and not fold. I I say
[16:36] friends, I thank God, Amen, that he was
[16:38] able to send an anointing at the right
[16:40] time, at the right age, to be able to
[16:43] challenge, Amen. what it is. Now,
[16:45] Brother Man said, I don't want you to
[16:47] forget this. I want you to examine this.
[16:50] How could a man do anything besides the
[16:53] power of God that has been released to
[16:55] him? How could he do anything except the
[16:58] power of God was released to him? The
[17:00] only thing he can do is to work by the
[17:02] spirit that is among him. And I thank
[17:05] God that he released an anointing. Amen.
[17:08] Amen. An anointing upon the church when
[17:11] it was an age of sacrificial lambs. It
[17:13] was an age of martyr martyrs. It was an
[17:16] age when persecution was coming. Amen.
[17:19] Men were being slaughtered. Amen. And
[17:21] you say, "How could they do it?" Well,
[17:23] they did it because God sent them an
[17:25] anointing to be able to withstand that
[17:29] in that time. Amen. Now, of course,
[17:31] Amen. If you're if you're a studyer,
[17:33] we'll we'll just continue in saying this
[17:35] that that ox anointing came to give them
[17:38] an anointing to withstand the
[17:39] persecutions that was coming. But now
[17:41] eventually that ox will turn into a man
[17:44] and that man then the intelligence of a
[17:47] man like uh Luther and Wesley and Knox
[17:50] and Calvin. Amen. and how they would
[17:52] begin then to be able to take the
[17:54] scriptures and and through through their
[17:56] wisdom and scriptures be able to say and
[17:59] combat that doctrine that had been
[18:01] spread across there. Oh, and them
[18:03] managed look all the way up through
[18:04] there. But as we said the other day,
[18:06] they were just reformers. Amen. And so
[18:09] there's going to be things that William
[18:10] Brandom teaches that's different than
[18:12] Luther and Wesley and Fox uh uh uh Knox
[18:15] and Calvin. And it's because they were
[18:17] reformers. We showed you how, amen, that
[18:20] a reformer like Luther, Amen, a
[18:22] wonderful man of God, but he was still
[18:25] rebuking Israel and saying they needed
[18:27] to be murdered, but he did it because he
[18:29] was a reformer, he was not a prophet.
[18:32] But when a prophet came, how could a
[18:34] prophet speak against the the apple of
[18:37] God's eye? How how could he condemn
[18:39] Israel when it was God himself that
[18:42] blinded Israel and they did what they
[18:44] did? So the mystery would be revealed of
[18:47] how Amen. that God made a way for you
[18:50] Gentiles by blinding Israel. But it
[18:53] would take a prophet to really bring
[18:55] that into reality to the bride in the
[18:58] last days. And that that gets us to this
[19:00] point that that last anointing was going
[19:03] to be an eagle. Amen. He was going to
[19:05] fly up high enough, Amen. to be able to
[19:08] see. He would be prophetic and he would
[19:10] bring eyes to the church. Let me say
[19:12] this. In the last days, amen. In the age
[19:15] that we are entering into, God has
[19:17] chosen this season to open the book of
[19:20] Revelations to the bride of Christ that
[19:22] they might be able to see, Amen. by
[19:25] Revelation the very trail of Satan all
[19:28] the way from Genesis through the book of
[19:30] Revelations until the end. We have seen
[19:33] his trail from the beginning all the way
[19:36] to the end. And I do say what a
[19:38] beautiful revelation that end is.
[19:42] Amen. It make a preacher want to preach
[19:44] thinking about the end of Satan and the
[19:46] annihilation of Satan. And I I I I don't
[19:49] know if you study a lot of theology, but
[19:52] one of the great things that Brother
[19:53] Brandham uh spoke to us that everybody
[19:55] hated the revelation that he brought
[19:57] most people, the denominations anyhow
[19:59] was there is no eternal hell. And and
[20:02] some people were tore up about it. But
[20:04] when I started studying and I I it's one
[20:06] of my favorite revelations. There's no
[20:08] eternal hell. That means that Satan will
[20:10] not be with us throughout eternity. He
[20:13] had a beginning and he will have an end.
[20:15] And I can read you in the back of the
[20:17] book where he is thrown in the lake of
[20:19] fire. And brother Bam said he will be
[20:22] completely
[20:23] annihilated and done away with. Amen. So
[20:26] there is no eternal hell. There is no
[20:29] eternal devil because hell was created
[20:31] for the devil and his angels. But it
[20:33] wasn't created for you. And there's been
[20:36] an eagle that has come to this age to
[20:39] lift this bride up above the
[20:41] denominational teachings and traditions.
[20:44] And and God has given us a a tradition
[20:47] shattering message that would bring
[20:49] revelation to the bride to bring a eagle
[20:52] message to the church of the living God
[20:54] to take our eyes. Amen. To open our eyes
[20:57] to the things which are happening in
[20:59] this age. Listen, I I say this without
[21:02] without uh without any apology. Amen.
[21:05] Only the elect will not worship. Amen.
[21:08] The great image of the beast in the last
[21:10] days. That's right. Everybody else is
[21:13] going to be fooled by that thing. But
[21:15] that elect. Yes. But that elect. Yeah.
[21:20] Have you ever thought about what makes
[21:21] you be able to see the message? You see
[21:24] the message because you're the elect.
[21:28] Do you know why that you won't worship
[21:30] the mark of the beast? Because you see
[21:32] the message.
[21:34] It's not like you had this great ability
[21:36] to figure this all out, but God put
[21:39] something in your heart to believe this
[21:41] message and the message pulled the
[21:43] covers off of denominationalism and
[21:46] showed you the mark of the beast. So,
[21:48] you're standing here today delivered and
[21:51] rapture bound because God gave you the
[21:54] ability to see this message. I say when
[21:58] the enemy comes in like a thud, God will
[22:01] raise the standard of revelation in this
[22:04] bride that she might be able to see. She
[22:07] will not be deceived because God has put
[22:10] it in her heart to believe this message.
[22:13] The eagle, brother Bam says, is
[22:15] revelation and it's deal for the last
[22:17] time. It's the eagle. It's the power of
[22:20] the eagle, a divine revealer of the word
[22:23] of God.
[22:25] Amen. And that's exactly Malachi 4. If
[22:28] you like your Bibles, that's Malachi
[22:30] 4:es 5 and 6. It's Luke 17:30. It's
[22:34] Matthew 24. It's John 14:12. Amen. It's
[22:38] Revelations the 3rd chapter. It's
[22:40] Revelations the 10th chapter. What is
[22:42] it? It's an eagle. Amen. It happens
[22:45] between the sixth and the seventh woe or
[22:47] the third the third the second and third
[22:50] woe and the sixth and seventh trumpet.
[22:52] There comes an angel. a fifth uh the
[22:55] fourth anointing of Elijah coming upon
[22:57] the earth. Amen. To reveal the word to
[23:00] lift us out of tribulation.
[23:05] Amen.
[23:07] Amen. Listen, this message is got a
[23:10] purpose. It's to lift you out
[23:14] of tribulation.
[23:16] Anybody tell you this bride's going
[23:18] through tribulation, they're lying. Come
[23:20] on. It is not the word of God. Yes sir.
[23:24] This message came to lift us out of
[23:28] denomination.
[23:29] Hallelujah.
[23:31] Amen. I tell you, it's a lifting
[23:33] message, isn't it? This eagle power is
[23:35] to call the bride to bring you out of
[23:38] world and traditions of denominations.
[23:41] And even within the very Pentecostal
[23:44] message, there had to be a corner turned
[23:47] that would take us from organization and
[23:50] the age of the church and put us into
[23:52] the word of the bride of Christ. I tell
[23:56] you, there was a corner turned and the
[23:58] prophet of God began to scream, "Come
[23:59] out of her, my people." Amen. And
[24:02] because there will be no eagles in the
[24:05] cage of the unclean bird,
[24:08] won't be no eagles in there. Why ain't
[24:10] there eagles? We were in there, but God
[24:12] sent a message and opened the door.
[24:14] Amen. And said, "House of hell, give way
[24:17] in the name of Jesus Christ, come out of
[24:20] her, my people, and be not partakers of
[24:23] her plagues and her fornications."
[24:25] There's been a message. Call us out of
[24:27] there. Do you see what it is? Amen. Now,
[24:30] now, folks, these are just some things
[24:31] that's in my heart. That mighty angel
[24:34] comes down with a covenant, and he has
[24:37] the strength of the covenant angel. He's
[24:39] a mighty angel. He has the ability to
[24:42] call the name of the bride. And from the
[24:45] word of his power, just as Moses was
[24:48] able to break the power of Egypt to
[24:51] deliver the children of Israel, this
[24:53] message has the word of the power of God
[24:56] to deliver this church. It is a word of
[24:59] truth. It is a word of deliverance. It
[25:01] is a word of power. It is a word of
[25:04] anointing that would bring us outside of
[25:07] it. I say this, this bride has heard her
[25:09] theophony call. She has heard that
[25:12] theophonic call that you are not of this
[25:15] world, that you are sons and you're
[25:18] daughters of God. The message is
[25:20] calling. Amen. Bringing us out. Now,
[25:23] I'll say this that we have come to a
[25:25] time. We can announce it and declare it.
[25:27] Amen. that the time is at hand and the
[25:30] unsealing of this book has come that it
[25:33] might combat the antichrist system of
[25:36] this age by the opening of seven seals.
[25:39] If we deny the opening of these seals,
[25:41] we have forfeited our ability to
[25:44] overcome the antichrist.
[25:47] When the enemy comes like a flood, God
[25:49] raises a standard. This is God's answer
[25:52] to the Antichrist system.
[25:55] The opening of these seals is the answer
[25:58] to the Antichrist system. It is the
[26:00] answer to get you and I out of
[26:02] tribulation. It is the answer for our
[26:05] homes, for our families, for our
[26:06] churches. If you want a church, start on
[26:09] the word. Not the word of Luther and the
[26:12] word of Wesley, but the opening of this
[26:14] word church. I believe in a revival, but
[26:17] it's a third pull revival. It's a word
[26:20] revival. It's a restoration of this
[26:23] bride back to the Amen Eden condition of
[26:26] God where he can minister with his
[26:28] people and revelations can come. Oh,
[26:31] I'll tell you this. Amen. When we get
[26:32] we're going to go on further, of course,
[26:34] but I'll say this. Amen. In Matthew 16,
[26:37] Jesus said, "I'll build my church and
[26:39] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[26:41] against it. On this rock, I'll build my
[26:44] church." What rock is that? Was it
[26:46] Peter? No. Amen. Was it Jesus? No. Amen.
[26:51] What was that rock then? It's the
[26:53] revelation of who he was. Revelation is
[26:57] what builds any church. It's what builds
[27:00] any life. You're only as strong as your
[27:04] adherence to the revealed word of the
[27:06] age you're living in. If Satan can talk
[27:08] you out of this, it's like a man being
[27:11] talked out of his weapon in the middle
[27:12] of battle because it's the only weapon
[27:15] God has gave you. Listen, let me say
[27:16] this. God gave you the best weapon
[27:18] first. That's right.
[27:22] God don't learn, does he? He don't
[27:23] learn. So, he's not learning what's a
[27:26] better weapon. He knew the best weapon
[27:27] first. That's what he gave to Adam and
[27:30] it would have protected Adam and Eve if
[27:32] Eve would have held on to it. But the
[27:34] moment Eve laid it down, reason and come
[27:36] in and broke it. And if the church of
[27:39] the living God will just hold on to the
[27:41] message,
[27:42] if you'll just hold on to the message, I
[27:44] don't care what soussayer says it, what
[27:46] preacher says it, what denomination says
[27:48] it. If they come against this message,
[27:51] it is coming from the pits of hell to
[27:54] destroy the very power that God has
[27:57] given this church, the power of rapture.
[28:01] Listen, I'll say this. We're coming into
[28:02] the greatest battles that has ever been
[28:04] fought. I recognize that we have an
[28:06] Armageddon coming and there's natural
[28:08] and civil battles going to happen. I get
[28:10] it. Third world war is going to strike.
[28:13] But listen, that's not where we're a
[28:15] part of. We're we're not a part of that
[28:17] battle. We're not here for the last
[28:19] three and a half years of the
[28:20] tribulation. But I'll tell you this.
[28:22] Amen. Our battle is right here this
[28:24] morning. Amen. And I know how we will
[28:27] overcome this battle. We will overcome
[28:29] it by the blood of the lamb and the word
[28:32] of our testimony. Confess this message
[28:36] in the face of unbelief, in the face of
[28:38] doubt, in the face of trouble, in the
[28:40] face of problems. We have been given a
[28:43] message that will defeat Satan anywhere,
[28:46] any place, anytime, under any form or
[28:49] any condition. Hold on to your message.
[28:53] Hold on to it with all of your heart.
[28:55] God has given you what will work.
[28:59] Hallelujah. Now, I'll tell you, I don't
[29:01] believe in this in this period of the
[29:03] age that we're living in, now don't
[29:05] don't don't throw me out for saying a
[29:07] few little things like this, but but I
[29:09] don't believe that you're going to see a
[29:10] great sweeping revival like it was in
[29:12] the 40s and 50s.
[29:15] But I see what I see is you're going to
[29:17] see a maturing of the seed.
[29:20] Yes. And
[29:22] because of the glare of another age,
[29:25] people will not be able to see that as a
[29:27] revival.
[29:29] They will look at the revival of other
[29:31] ages and think this one's supposed to be
[29:33] exactly like those ones.
[29:36] But the true revival is the maturing
[29:39] of this people under the message. Come
[29:42] on church. We are not theion untamed
[29:45] beast. We are well taught sons and
[29:48] daughters of God under the anointing of
[29:51] that zoom because we can receive
[29:54] headship. we could receive the word of
[29:56] God in this generation. Now, I believe
[29:59] it's certainly the revival of this age.
[30:01] And while the maturing is happening, I
[30:03] know that there is healing and
[30:04] anointings and powers of every kind.
[30:07] Amen. But it must be done under the
[30:09] word. Amen. Yeah. Now, under this first
[30:12] seal, it's a powerful revelation that
[30:14] Brother Bam is bringing us. And and if
[30:17] you're a if you're a student uh a course
[30:20] of these things, you you you absolutely
[30:22] can see how that the prophet will
[30:24] outline this and and uh he he'll just
[30:27] make it I'll just say it instead of
[30:29] reading all this. I'm going to do this
[30:30] for brother
[30:32] Dallas. Amen. Brother Dallas, instead of
[30:35] just reading it, I'll say it and you'll
[30:36] know it's right. Amen. Amen. The white
[30:39] horse rider, right? The white horse
[30:42] rider was not Jesus Christ.
[30:47] That's true. Now, now that's a
[30:50] definitive thing without reading a lot,
[30:53] without without going through all the
[30:55] quotes. The white horse rider was not
[30:58] Jesus.
[31:00] But it was religious.
[31:04] And the reason it was religious is
[31:06] because the scripture said he went out
[31:08] to conquer and to conquer revealing the
[31:13] intent was to conquer religion to gain
[31:17] his original purpose being that it's not
[31:20] Jesus, it's the antichrist or the devil.
[31:23] Right? And what was his original thing?
[31:25] Isaiah saw it in his heart and said, "Oh
[31:28] Lucifer, son of the morning, why thou
[31:30] fallen from heaven?" Because he desired
[31:33] to have a kingdom greater than that of
[31:35] Michael. He wants to be worshiped as
[31:39] God.
[31:41] Now, there's plenty of people that
[31:43] worship him as the devil, but that
[31:45] that's not what he wants. He wants
[31:48] people to worship him believing
[31:51] they are worshiping God. True. That's
[31:55] what he wants. So that's why it was a
[31:58] white horse is because it was an
[32:00] impersonation of Christianity.
[32:04] It's because it was an antichrist. Now
[32:05] what does that mean? It was an anti-word
[32:08] teaching.
[32:11] Which had of course we we we went
[32:13] through a little deeper on it, but I'll
[32:15] just say it this morning. Which he had a
[32:18] bow and no arrows, meaning he was just a
[32:20] bluff. He's a liar. Yeah, but he he
[32:24] wasn't crowned when he began, but then
[32:26] he took a crown.
[32:29] Now, after he took the crown, then he
[32:31] switches horses from white to red. Now,
[32:34] it's amazing. Uh, I just spent a few
[32:37] days in Rome, so I I' I've got a real
[32:39] firthand look at some of the history of
[32:42] what brother Bram said. And what I found
[32:44] out, we're not bringing nothing new, but
[32:46] the clarity
[32:48] of in which has been said makes me and
[32:50] helps me understand the ripening
[32:53] is it's getting clearer and clearer and
[32:57] clearer until all the obscurity of our
[33:00] own ideas and traditions of the church
[33:04] has been wiped off of it. You know, uh
[33:07] it's amazing here because when you when
[33:09] you look at it, this is divided in three
[33:12] things. And I I'll just say starting
[33:14] with these three things. It's Satan's
[33:16] pattern. Brother Bram calls it just like
[33:18] God has a pattern, Satan has a pattern.
[33:20] So when you're studying the seal book,
[33:22] there's a three things you want to watch
[33:24] for. And brother Bam said the first one
[33:25] of them is Antichrist
[33:28] teaching which Paul mentions and also
[33:32] John here in Revelation chapter 2, it's
[33:35] called Nicicoatan. Right.
[33:38] So the when you when you look at the
[33:39] white horse and you think of the false
[33:41] teaching, brother Bam names it the
[33:44] nicotan doctrine but it but but see it's
[33:47] not a doctrine in the revelation chapter
[33:50] 2. I think it's about the sixth verse.
[33:51] It calls it the deeds
[33:54] of the nickelans. Brother said because
[33:56] it wasn't quite yet a doctrine. It was
[33:59] just a saying. Now be before we go
[34:01] further let's let's let's discover what
[34:03] that was. The nicicoatan doctrine was to
[34:06] conquer the ley. See what that first
[34:09] horse to conquer and to conquer. He was
[34:12] going to conquer the ley by his
[34:14] teaching.
[34:16] Now what's he doing? He's separating the
[34:19] people from the leadership of the Holy
[34:21] Ghost. Now I I never understood quite
[34:25] the depth of the meaning of what that
[34:27] really meant, but this morning hopefully
[34:29] we'll get to it just a little bit. But
[34:30] but you watch this nicicoatin what he's
[34:33] going to do is he means to conquer the
[34:35] ley. It's it's it's it's nic means to
[34:38] conquer. Leotin means leoty. Nicolotin
[34:42] conquer the ley. In other words, there's
[34:43] a holy man and the people. So it
[34:46] separates the priesthood from the
[34:48] people. Now now when did God ever do
[34:51] that?
[34:53] Never. But the Holy Ghost makes us all
[34:56] one. Right? Right. Then there's a gift
[34:59] in our life that places us as pastors,
[35:01] teachers, evangelists, whatever that is,
[35:02] but we're just the same. So it's not one
[35:05] holy man in a pullpit and a bunch of
[35:08] people gathered around, but it's a body
[35:11] of Christ. And the spirit of God is the
[35:13] same on the back row as it is behind the
[35:15] pull pit. It's just operating under a
[35:17] different gift. Now, now, now the
[35:20] prophet is teaching us, of course, at
[35:21] Nicolay. And if you study the history of
[35:23] it, what it was, brother Ran said that
[35:25] the message went in to the to the uh
[35:27] simple homes and things and the slaves
[35:30] and things like that begin to get the
[35:31] revelations and he said they got filled
[35:33] with the Holy Ghost. He said they were
[35:35] just joining and meeting every which
[35:36] way. He said then of course he said then
[35:38] the higher ups started getting it and
[35:40] the bosses of the slaves started getting
[35:41] the Holy Ghost or wanting to get the
[35:43] Holy Ghost. So they started coming to
[35:44] the churches and brother man said then
[35:46] the richer people started moving into
[35:48] the churches like your mayors and he
[35:50] said the high officials of the he in
[35:52] modern day like our our governor would
[35:54] want to come and the mayor wants to come
[35:55] and somebody else wants to come but they
[35:57] don't want to come and after coming a
[35:58] little while they got a little money got
[36:00] a little importance but they don't want
[36:01] to come like it is all of a sudden they
[36:04] start making ideas of change you know
[36:07] wouldn't it be a little better if if we
[36:09] didn't have you know these girls they
[36:11] they you know they're wearing these long
[36:13] dresses And it's, you know, it's a
[36:15] little sloppier. Don't you think we
[36:16] could Don't you think we could fix these
[36:18] things up a little bit? And, you know,
[36:19] this cutting hair thing. What What's the
[36:22] big deal? What's the Why y'all where Oh
[36:24] my. We could We could add 150 200 people
[36:27] if you just forget about that charact
[36:29] care and and why would you ever even say
[36:31] makeup? Why Why you ever even have to
[36:33] mention that at all? Let's just and see
[36:35] what they were doing. And they were
[36:37] trying to change the direction. Now,
[36:39] Brother Mam says this. He said, "And
[36:41] because they were influential and
[36:43] money," he said, "if there wasn't a
[36:45] spirit-led man behind the pull pit," he
[36:48] said, "they would get their way."
[36:51] But I tell you what, if you ever get a
[36:52] spirit-led man behind the pull pit, that
[36:55] devil would die before it ever gets in
[36:57] the door.
[36:58] [Applause]
[37:00] Amen. I I'm going to put a a solid
[37:02] warning to that devil. Don't you ever
[37:04] try to put a bunch of polish on True
[37:06] Word Tabernacle and make it a little
[37:09] better for the world. We're not trying
[37:11] to worldlyize this church. We're trying
[37:14] to bring a sanctified power of God
[37:16] that'll bring liberty and life in the
[37:19] household of God. And yeah, we're going
[37:21] to shout a little and we're going to
[37:23] dance a little. Amen. And somebody's
[37:26] going to have gifts in the body and they
[37:28] might be crying and speaking in tongues
[37:30] and rolling around on the floor. We're
[37:32] not trying to make it more likable for
[37:34] the world.
[37:37] No, that's not our purpose at all. We're
[37:40] trying to get this church in the power
[37:42] of the rapture.
[37:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I know that
[37:47] everybody's got a better way. Brother
[37:49] said, "God gave a baby to cry." He said,
[37:51] "Of course, you could show a better way
[37:53] through a psychologist." He said, "But
[37:54] it ain't no better way
[37:57] than what God's way is." And I I don't
[37:59] want to get off in all that, but I want
[38:00] to say it like this. The nickel and what
[38:02] they were doing was trying to bring
[38:04] control. Yeah.
[38:06] Now, brother Bram is very depictive in
[38:08] this formal.
[38:11] Trying to bring the formal side.
[38:17] That's what it was about. Nicoleism was
[38:19] the formal side. Now, now you we'll get
[38:22] to some things here. They got to they
[38:24] got to bring the formal side. So, watch
[38:25] this. The first pattern is the nickelan
[38:28] spirit. But that spirit didn't have
[38:31] anything more than a deed or a saying
[38:34] until amen we come to Constantine and
[38:38] they have they have the great Nika
[38:40] council and then they actually then form
[38:43] a religion which we know as the Roman
[38:46] Catholic Church of the Nyian teaching of
[38:48] the trinity and when they did that then
[38:51] they crowned themselves a pope which
[38:53] become a false prophet to that teaching.
[38:56] Yeah. So now you have a man, you have a
[38:58] pope that is issuing the doctrine of the
[39:02] nicicoatin and he's crowned the king of
[39:04] that doctrine. So brother said, "What
[39:06] was the doctrine?" It he said it was the
[39:08] pagan uh the stacking up of leaders like
[39:12] a like a bishop, then a pope, and then
[39:14] he said, "See, they got a hierarchy of
[39:16] leadership." He said, "There it is in
[39:18] that system. That's a pagan way of
[39:20] approaching God." Amen. And they put a
[39:23] crown king over it, which was a false
[39:24] prophet. And you know the final stage of
[39:26] that's the beast, right? The incarnate
[39:28] devil. Amen. But that false prophet by
[39:31] that teaching holds the door open for
[39:34] the devil to become incarnate in the
[39:36] earth the moment the bride leaves the
[39:37] earth. Now that's the three phases that
[39:41] you're going to see. But now watch
[39:42] because what we find then is the
[39:45] switching of this of this horse. It has
[39:48] to do with the persecution of the
[39:49] church. Now, if if you uh and and this
[39:52] is actually one thing that struck me so
[39:54] powerful. I didn't I didn't plan this,
[39:56] but I thought it was amazing that I was
[39:58] in Rome in the middle of this study. And
[40:01] and I and I I I I really started getting
[40:03] the connections while I was there
[40:05] because we had a we had a couple
[40:07] different tours. And one of the tours
[40:09] that we took is we took the tour to the
[40:11] Colosseums uh which was built in the
[40:15] days of Jesus there. I mean, before
[40:16] Jesus, but they've been there since the
[40:18] days of Jesus. And so the coliseums
[40:20] where many of our Christian brothers and
[40:22] sisters were put to the death and and
[40:25] they were fed to lions and killed in the
[40:27] public and under crucifixions. Now Neero
[40:30] himself had another coliseum called the
[40:32] circus of Neero which was made of wood.
[40:35] It's not there today. But the stone one
[40:37] which we were at, there was there was uh
[40:39] there was a significant amount uh of the
[40:42] ruins that is still there where they
[40:44] where they brought the persecution upon
[40:47] the the Christians and it was actually a
[40:49] a town center event to be able to do
[40:52] such a thing to the Christians of that
[40:54] day. Now what what's amazing is is uh
[40:57] well we we got a blessing of having a
[40:58] tour guide because I'm going to say
[41:00] something. Sometimes you can go and you
[41:01] can look at a pile of rocks and if
[41:03] somebody don't know what they are it
[41:05] just that old hillbilly like me it's
[41:07] just a pile of rocks you know it look
[41:09] like some old rocks you know I remember
[41:11] going to Israel and and we we went by a
[41:13] pile just a slab there and a couple old
[41:15] big old uh beams up there and just a I
[41:18] don't know a couple old uh piles of uh
[41:21] like concrete piling just standing up
[41:23] there and a flat floor and I it looked
[41:25] like some kind of building years ago or
[41:27] something and I I looked over at that
[41:28] and wasn't impressed at And the lady who
[41:31] was our guide looked over and says,
[41:32] "Now, right there is where Jesus stood
[41:35] and read from the book of Isaiah and
[41:37] said, "This day, this scripture." I whoa
[41:38] whoa whoa
[41:39] whoa. This is different. Now,
[41:43] see, in in having a guide, you you're
[41:46] going to miss things unless you have see
[41:48] things that's laying in the scripture,
[41:50] such minute things that you've just read
[41:52] over and read over, without a god, it's
[41:55] almost don't have the great meaning. But
[41:56] the moment a prophet begins to pick it
[41:59] up and said now right here is where this
[42:01] great transition took place. Now you
[42:04] recognize he and having a guy this lady
[42:06] that was guiding us actually had two
[42:08] different doctorates in uh in in the
[42:10] ancient history of arts and that
[42:12] coliseum. She did her thesis on two of
[42:14] the little paintings there. So, so we we
[42:16] were pretty um pretty blessed to have
[42:18] her along with us and she don't know
[42:19] where uh she didn't know if we was
[42:22] preacher or Catholic or she didn't know
[42:24] anything, you know, and we just got to
[42:26] talking to her. Well, the moment I
[42:27] realized she was a history student, I
[42:30] professor, I guess, I I had questions. I
[42:32] had all kinds of questions. So, I start
[42:34] talking to her and I said, "Well, I
[42:36] would really like to see uh where, you
[42:38] know, where where Paul was buried and
[42:39] where Peter," because Paul was killed in
[42:41] Rome. You know, that's where they cut
[42:41] his head off. I said, "I'd like to see
[42:43] where that happened." And she goes,
[42:45] "Well, Paul is up in certain certain
[42:46] place. You might be able to get in, but
[42:48] with the Pope funeral and all that, I
[42:49] doubt you can get there, but for sure
[42:51] you can't get in where Peter was." And
[42:53] she goes, "Um, I supposed to tell you
[42:56] this, but you know, in
[42:59] history, we don't have any record of
[43:02] Peter being in Rome until the second
[43:05] century, they wrote something about
[43:08] it." Well, I've been a student of the
[43:10] Brillian Brandon. I already knew that.
[43:14] But when she said it, I said, "Well, you
[43:15] might be a real historian then." I said,
[43:17] "Cuz Peter wasn't in Rome." And she
[43:19] said, "No, he was he wasn't in Rome."
[43:21] She said, "You're a Protestant, aren't
[43:22] you?" I said, "Yes, I am." She tagged me
[43:26] right quick. "Yes, I am. I'm protesting.
[43:28] I'm still protesting the Catholic
[43:30] Church. I'm still a Protestant." Amen.
[43:33] But you but was amazing as we we start
[43:35] walking and she and she does something
[43:37] that she's found my interest very
[43:40] quickly as we look from the from the
[43:41] coliseum. She pointed over on the hill
[43:44] and she says, "This is the imperial
[43:45] hill." And I forget the name exactly,
[43:47] but this is where all the emperors of
[43:49] Rome at one time built and there was no
[43:51] uh structures left, but it was just the
[43:53] heel and a platform. And I said, "Well,
[43:56] that's interesting." She said, "Yeah,
[43:57] but it gets more interesting." She said
[43:59] in 800 certain certain year uh about the
[44:02] mid 800s she said there was one of the
[44:04] popes of Rome actually moved to that
[44:07] hill for the purpose to show the people
[44:11] that they had more than religious power
[44:13] in Rome. So they literally built a house
[44:16] on top of the empire the emperor of
[44:19] Rome. They built a house on top of where
[44:21] his house had been and the pope moved in
[44:24] it to prove to all of them, I'm more
[44:27] than just a pope. Yeah. I'm the I'm a
[44:29] civil leader. Well, when we get to when
[44:31] we get to digging into this, then we we
[44:33] we start realizing, Amen, that history
[44:37] itself, Amen, is lined up with the
[44:40] realities of what a prophet teaches us
[44:42] in these seals. Now, if you if you watch
[44:45] that first horse rider, he's a he's a
[44:47] nickelan and he's riding out and and as
[44:50] he rides out, he's telling his story,
[44:52] but he doesn't have any arrows in his
[44:54] bow, so he can't really do anything
[44:56] about it. But from this time now, from
[44:58] the time that the message went into Rome
[45:01] in the early years, you remember when
[45:03] Paul takes it into Rome and and I'm
[45:06] going to take you on just a real quick
[45:07] uh time journey here. But Paul leaves
[45:10] Jerusalem, goes to Rome. Well, he's
[45:12] still alive right and they start a
[45:14] church in Rome now. There's there's a
[45:18] there's there's Christians now in Rome.
[45:22] And in Rome itself, the the city of
[45:24] Rome, they're built on the ideas of
[45:28] Babylonian
[45:30] mysteries that have been brought to
[45:32] them from the city of Pergamus.
[45:36] You all you all remember that back in
[45:39] the days of Babylon when Babylon was
[45:42] falling, one of the king mystery keepers
[45:46] escaped out of Babylon and run to
[45:48] Pergam. Yeah. and he taught his
[45:51] mysteries of the zodiac and his religion
[45:54] and he taught that religion but the
[45:57] man's name was Adalist and by the time
[45:59] the third emperor named Adalus came
[46:01] along when he died he wieldled his
[46:04] entire kingdom to the Roman kingdom
[46:08] so then Rome took that over and became
[46:12] you you all know Julius Caesar he become
[46:14] the first pontis maximus of of Rome and
[46:17] he became both the keeper ers of the
[46:20] mystery of Babylon and the ruler of the
[46:22] Roman Empire. So Julius Caesar was a
[46:24] reason was great empire in the in
[46:26] history and I don't want to get deep in
[46:27] these things but but the reason I'm
[46:29] saying that is because Babylonian
[46:31] religion was already there and here
[46:33] comes Paul and the Christians and they
[46:36] start teaching the Christian doctrine
[46:38] and one of the emperors get mad at him
[46:40] and run Paul and them off and will kill
[46:42] Paul but then the rest of the believers
[46:45] can't return when y'all figure this is
[46:47] crazy. 13 years they were banned from
[46:50] Rome.
[46:52] So for 13 years, that's pretty
[46:54] significant, 13. For 13 years they
[46:57] wasn't allowed to return to Rome to
[46:59] teach Christian doctrine. And being
[47:01] there was no written manuscripts. What
[47:04] happened in them 13 years is the
[47:07] Babylonian ideas of religion of paganism
[47:11] begin to come into the Christian church
[47:14] and they begin to mingle together.
[47:17] Christianity with a Babylonish religion.
[47:20] So in 13 years by the time the believers
[47:23] got back and they saw the church, it
[47:26] looked nothing like the original church.
[47:29] And they found that Amen. instead of
[47:31] Zeus, they got Peter. They had
[47:33] sacramental altars like the pagans.
[47:35] Amen. And they had turned that Christian
[47:38] church into a hybridization between
[47:40] paganism and Christianity. It got so bad
[47:44] that they started another church. They
[47:46] just said, "Man, there's no fixing this
[47:47] one." Amen. And y'all remember when uh
[47:50] when uh Polycart visited there and he
[47:52] come out of there and he said that she's
[47:54] been married to her idols. In other
[47:55] words, there's nothing we could do to
[47:56] help her. And they pulled out and
[47:58] started another church and that one was
[48:00] only partly developed out. And then they
[48:02] started the third church, which which
[48:04] was back to the original ideas of Peter
[48:06] and Paul. But but that's why that the
[48:09] Roman church or Roman Catholic Church
[48:12] says they're the first church of Rome
[48:15] because they are the first church of
[48:17] Rome.
[48:18] They're the first one to deviate from
[48:21] the truth and pull in paganism. And they
[48:25] never left it. From that day till today
[48:29] they have been engrossed in paganism and
[48:31] and and the ideas of a Babylonian
[48:34] religion right there calling themselves
[48:36] Christians. Now why this gets important
[48:39] is because that the nickelans then see
[48:42] became the formal and the high ups and
[48:45] all of those spiritled Holy Ghost
[48:46] fililled people that had to leave that
[48:49] little group and start their own groups
[48:50] again became the persecuted church. But
[48:54] because because the Roman Catholic had
[48:57] no power, they had to be persecuted in a
[49:00] different way. In other words, that now
[49:02] the pagans was the ones that persecuted.
[49:05] Remember Neero and how he killed all of
[49:07] those Christians?
[49:10] You remember uh Rome Rome burned and
[49:12] brother said Nero burned it and sat
[49:15] there and fiddled, but when he got done,
[49:17] somebody had to be blamed. eventually
[49:19] blamed the Christians and thousands of
[49:21] them was killed for burning Rome and
[49:24] because they was this little odd group.
[49:26] See, they had been made weird. Now, I'm
[49:28] getting to a point here. They had been
[49:30] made weird. They had been made odd jaw
[49:32] oddballs, rejected, pushed out because
[49:35] of their their falling in the spirit and
[49:37] their manifestations of the power of
[49:40] God. They were decided that these are
[49:42] oddballs. They need they need pushed
[49:43] out. And when they got pushed out, you
[49:46] have a formal church that's now
[49:48] persecuting this one, but it don't have
[49:50] the power to do it, but it's doing it in
[49:53] in every which direction. Now, this this
[49:57] goes on until the Roman emperor. Now,
[50:00] these these are some important dates. In
[50:03] 303 AD, there's a Roman emperor, and if
[50:07] I could pronounce his name, I would, but
[50:08] it's it's in your church age book. D I E
[50:11] O C D setlesian.
[50:15] Dlesesian. Thank you.
[50:17] Dlesian brought 10 years of the
[50:20] bloodiest persecution.
[50:23] Now, what he did was, now this is
[50:25] important because we're dealing with
[50:27] persecution of of the Christian people,
[50:31] but it's coming from pagans.
[50:35] It's coming from the Jews.
[50:37] This Roman Empire
[50:40] made a law in 303 that outlawed
[50:43] Christianity.
[50:46] All out the Roman Empire. There can't be
[50:49] any Christianity. And if there is, it
[50:51] would be imprisonment, beating or death.
[50:54] So in 303, they begin to put such
[50:57] pressure, but it was the pagans doing
[50:59] it. Yeah. And this and this rocked right
[51:03] along all the way
[51:06] up until about 313. So 10 years of great
[51:10] persecution. And in 313, this is when
[51:14] the civil war was going on for emperors.
[51:16] And Constantine has this beautiful
[51:18] dream. and he believes he can win the
[51:21] civil war and become emperor if he
[51:24] remember he has a dream we'll paint the
[51:25] white crosses on the shields and the
[51:27] Christians will pray for us and we'll
[51:29] win. So Constantine
[51:32] actually passed a law that legalized
[51:35] Christianity in 313. So watch watch the
[51:38] swing. In 303 it's completely illegal to
[51:42] be a Christian by Roman law in 313. Now
[51:45] the Romans legalize it and people can
[51:49] legally be a Christian. Constantine
[51:51] himself was not a Christian but he acted
[51:54] like he was a Christian. It's called the
[51:56] edict of Milan. Brother Bam said
[51:58] yesterday I was listening very deeply
[52:00] and he said he was a politician not a
[52:03] Christian.
[52:05] Amen. But what he did was is he finally
[52:08] took the pressure off of the believers
[52:11] so as that they would be able to to
[52:14] enjoy amen Christianity and
[52:18] 313. But but the Roman Empire now uh I
[52:22] do y'all do y'all have that picture of
[52:23] the map? That Roman Empire. Now now that
[52:26] Roman Empire, and I don't know if any of
[52:28] you have ever really studied these
[52:29] things, so forgive me if it gets a
[52:31] little slow here, but it it it actually
[52:33] has a point on the left in the green.
[52:35] That's Italy where that star is. That's
[52:37] Rome. So the Roman Empire
[52:41] preconstantine, amen, just has this one
[52:43] star which is the which is the capital
[52:45] of the Roman Empire where he would rule.
[52:49] But there was so much unrest. Everything
[52:50] you're looking at was the Roman Empire.
[52:53] But he began to divide the kingdom in
[52:55] the east and the west. There's three or
[52:57] four emperors that did this. But on the
[52:59] right, this star on the right is is
[53:01] actually the home of the Byzantine
[53:04] Empire. You've heard of the Byzantine
[53:05] Empire. Well, that's that city is in
[53:07] Turkey, which today you call it
[53:09] Istanbul. Yeah. But in the time of
[53:12] Constantine, he conquered that city and
[53:14] changed the name from the Benzanites and
[53:16] put the his own name Constanopople.
[53:19] Yeah. Which became the second Rome.
[53:22] Yeah. It's very important to catch this
[53:25] something I've never really taught on,
[53:27] but it became Constantinople. And in the
[53:30] time of Constantine, this one becomes
[53:34] the imperial capital of the Roman
[53:36] Empire.
[53:38] He moves it from Rome to Constantinople.
[53:42] And now he's ruling. You said,
[53:43] "Preacher, what does that matter?"
[53:44] Because now if if you've ever get around
[53:46] to any of the brother Brandham haters,
[53:48] they'll always tell you Na was not in
[53:51] Rome. Because brother Bam always says
[53:53] the Roman Na 325 the Na was in Rome
[53:59] not in Italy. Yeah.
[54:03] Na is only about 50 miles from that star
[54:06] right there. Because the Eastern and
[54:09] Western Roman Empire was hard to hang on
[54:12] to. And since he had legalized
[54:14] Christianity, Constantine had realized
[54:16] now being a Christian that there was big
[54:18] infractions in the in the churches. But
[54:21] there was these spirit-ledd people with
[54:22] spirit manifestations and then there's
[54:24] this formal group and we can't get them
[54:26] together cuz they all got different
[54:28] teachings on who they believe God is.
[54:29] Some the see these these on the side of
[54:32] the formal held the ideas of polytheism
[54:35] which they got through Babylon. Come on.
[54:38] Only place you'll ever find
[54:39] multiplicities of God in the Bible is in
[54:42] the place of Babylon. And Babylon had
[54:45] made its way into the Christian church.
[54:47] And by 320 AD, Amen. here. Constantine
[54:51] says, "We'll fix it. Let's all get
[54:52] together and talk this thing out." Now,
[54:55] that sounds sensible, don't it? Let's
[54:57] have some diplomacy in the church. Let's
[54:59] let's get this thing put together. And
[55:01] when they get together, they come up
[55:04] with what you call the Nyian Council
[55:06] Trinitarian doctrine. That there I got
[55:09] it right here laying in front of me.
[55:11] Amen. It actually is a is an order that
[55:14] tells you that there is a deity of the
[55:17] father, the son, and the holy ghost. Do
[55:20] you say, "Preacher, what's really wrong
[55:22] with that?" Because they have now taken
[55:24] the name of Jesus away from the church.
[55:26] The prophet of God said, "When David
[55:28] come off of that hill and he had to face
[55:30] Goliath, he said, "You come to me with
[55:32] stabs and swords, but I come to you in
[55:35] the name of the Lord." Is that right?
[55:38] And brother Bon says that's exactly what
[55:40] Moses did when he took that rod and he
[55:42] held it over that sea and it opened up.
[55:44] He said that rod represented the name of
[55:47] Jesus Christ. He said if the devil could
[55:49] ever get the name of Jesus out of the
[55:51] church,
[55:53] he will have her whipped. And look what
[55:55] he's doing. He's taking the name of
[55:57] Jesus out and putting him as a second
[55:59] person of the Godhead or some other
[56:02] deity other than God himself. Amen. The
[56:05] devil was taking the glory of God out of
[56:09] Jesus Christ and putting it on a trinity
[56:11] of doctrine which was no more than
[56:14] paganism and Babylonian religion.
[56:17] And in AD 3:25, Amen. Brother Bam said,
[56:20] "There it is." He said, "That's why in
[56:22] the Pergamus age, if you're if you're
[56:24] studyers, go to the Pergam church age."
[56:26] And this is very detailed in there. But
[56:28] in the Pergam age, Brother Bam said,
[56:30] "That's why it was called married." He
[56:32] said because here in AD 3:25 in Nika
[56:36] they married the church and the state
[56:38] together and they married Christianity
[56:41] with paganism.
[56:43] There was a marriage between
[56:44] Christianity and paganism and it's still
[56:47] married today in the form of the Roman
[56:50] Catholic Church. Don't tell me I stood
[56:53] there last week and looked at their
[56:55] idols. I seen their pictures. I seen all
[56:57] of this idolatry that they've been
[56:59] selling the world for years. And the
[57:01] Bible says the kings of the earth would
[57:04] drink of the wine of her fornication.
[57:06] And all of these presidents have
[57:08] swallowed this paganism. And they had
[57:11] drinken till they're drunk with the with
[57:13] the with the royalty of the Roman
[57:15] church. But it ain't nothing but the
[57:17] pits of hell being dunked out into the
[57:20] world to take the glory of Jesus Christ
[57:23] and put it in a man. No wonder when they
[57:26] built the altars for their pope, they
[57:29] set him up and put above his head. Amen.
[57:31] Instead of God, the son of God, they
[57:35] gave you a pope.
[57:38] [Music]
[57:40] Now, these two kingdoms, what's this?
[57:42] Watch this. This is east and west. And
[57:44] that is the reason why the na council
[57:47] comes up. Now, give me that other
[57:48] picture real quick if you can. Now, I
[57:50] know these are deep, but I'll put it on
[57:52] the I'll put it on the tape and you can
[57:54] go back listen to it if you want. Uh the
[57:56] if you go back the history of this
[57:58] picture, I dealt with it heavily and
[58:00] it's on the YouTube that we have here at
[58:02] the church. It's it's Daniel chapter 2
[58:04] dealing with the stone of judgment.
[58:06] Amen. Now, watch this because now we're
[58:09] This is Daniel the 2 chapter. How many
[58:11] you Bible readers? That's Daniel 2 on
[58:13] the left and this is Daniel 7, I
[58:15] believe, on the right. Daniel 2 is the
[58:18] that's the Nebuchadnezzar, right? Yeah.
[58:20] That head of gold is Babylon, right?
[58:23] Right. Then we have the Meo Persians.
[58:26] Remember the meeting Persians, the ones
[58:28] that came in, destroyed Babylon,
[58:31] delivered the children of Israel and
[58:32] they went and built the new Jerusalem,
[58:34] uh the new temple under Zerubabel. Then
[58:37] the Grecian Empire. Now Daniel predicts
[58:39] these all before they happened. Then you
[58:41] have the Grecian Empire which is the
[58:42] thighs of the breast Alexander the great
[58:44] and he rose up and done exactly as a
[58:46] scripture. But the Roman Empire is the
[58:50] first time the image has two legs.
[58:53] Now I just showed you the two legs of
[58:55] the Roman Empire
[58:57] and they developed in two different legs
[58:59] and you see the two legs of iron. So
[59:01] they for for hundreds of years they
[59:03] could rule the world by iron force. When
[59:06] we say the world, that was the world at
[59:08] that time. And they would they would
[59:10] rule by iron force. Those legs, look,
[59:12] they're just iron legs. But when you get
[59:15] down to the bottom, do you see the feet?
[59:18] They begin to be mingled with iron and
[59:20] clay. Now, what it happens is is that
[59:24] today, if you said Rome rules the world,
[59:26] nobody believe you because the Roman
[59:29] Empire was broke up and done away with
[59:31] years ago.
[59:32] But the Roman Empire broke up and was
[59:35] done away with. But the Holy Roman
[59:37] church took its place and became both in
[59:41] east and west. Now you don't have east
[59:43] and west. You don't have it like Rome
[59:45] and then you have east and bull. Now you
[59:47] have the west which America is the west
[59:50] and then you have the east which is
[59:51] communism. Amen. Today we have that
[59:53] division. But the the iron and clay in
[59:56] the feet of this image deals with that
[59:59] Rome will be in every nation under the
[1:00:01] earth. Now, can you imagine that the
[1:00:03] pope has influence in every nation of
[1:00:07] the earth? Isn't that amazing how that
[1:00:10] he could how he could have rulership,
[1:00:13] but he's doing it through religion. Now,
[1:00:15] now folks, this is this is not just um
[1:00:18] this is not just something that is a fly
[1:00:20] by night thing, but on them feet are 10
[1:00:24] toes,
[1:00:26] right? Five in the left, five in the
[1:00:27] east. Do you know now I'm I'm not a
[1:00:30] student. I just read some of these
[1:00:31] things, but but I'll say this. Do you
[1:00:32] know the world right now is divided into
[1:00:34] 10 different fractions? There's a list
[1:00:36] of them. But on them on them 10 toes,
[1:00:40] Brother Bram said, there's a big toe to
[1:00:42] every foot.
[1:00:44] There's a foot in the east and there's a
[1:00:45] foot in the left. And he said the big
[1:00:47] toes on those feet was revealed in the
[1:00:50] days when William Brandon was on the
[1:00:51] earth. How many knows that? Brother
[1:00:53] Brham said we were watching a meeting
[1:00:55] the other day between the east and the
[1:00:57] west. America and Russia with their
[1:01:00] groups were sitting in the same room and
[1:01:02] he said Kruch got mad and took off his
[1:01:05] shoe and beat it on the desk. Now when
[1:01:08] he took his shoe off, what did he do? He
[1:01:10] revealed his foot and brother Ben said,
[1:01:12] "Watch that." He said that Eisenhower,
[1:01:15] he says it means clay and or it's
[1:01:17] opposite, isn't it? Eisenhower means
[1:01:19] iron and Kruch means clay. He said,
[1:01:22] watch, we see the two big toes of
[1:01:24] Daniel's image right there standing in
[1:01:28] the same room and one of them beating
[1:01:30] her shoe upon the desk. What's he
[1:01:31] saying? Brother Bam said in the days of
[1:01:34] those big toes, there would come a
[1:01:36] message that would reveal the whole
[1:01:38] thing. Now, now folks, Amen. You say,
[1:01:41] "Preacher, why are you talking this
[1:01:43] way?" Because the revelation of the
[1:01:45] eagle is what brings reality that this
[1:01:48] denominational system man is trying to
[1:01:51] sell for God is not of God. It's the
[1:01:54] mark of the beast. It is the image of
[1:01:56] the devil. It's not a form of worship
[1:02:00] that belongs to the church of the living
[1:02:02] God.
[1:02:04] Now, now, now, now you can see this. And
[1:02:07] if you watch on the right side, those
[1:02:09] are the same kingdoms.
[1:02:11] like you represent America as a as a
[1:02:13] woman, then you represent her as an
[1:02:15] eagle. There's symbology and those on
[1:02:17] the right are the same symbologies. You
[1:02:19] can let that go for a moment. Now, now
[1:02:22] what we're seeing then is back there
[1:02:25] under that first horse, you're seeing
[1:02:27] that there was no power to kill them,
[1:02:29] but they finally got him a pope in AD25
[1:02:32] and they made a nice council. And now
[1:02:36] they have organized religion for the
[1:02:39] first time. Yeah. And under this
[1:02:42] organized religion, it takes a name of
[1:02:45] the Roman Catholic Church in AD 3:25.
[1:02:49] Amen. This is exactly when this is
[1:02:51] passed. And now Constantine believes he
[1:02:54] has settled the problem between the east
[1:02:56] and the west. So he is able to make a a
[1:03:00] concessions and and and you give up this
[1:03:02] and you give up that. But you know what
[1:03:04] really happened was it was the feast of
[1:03:07] Bale Peor
[1:03:09] and brother Bram said if you're if
[1:03:10] you're a Bible reader he said if you're
[1:03:13] watching the Bible he said the nickelans
[1:03:16] was Moab in the story
[1:03:18] and he says watch the the the the nickel
[1:03:21] is the Moab. He said the paganism of
[1:03:24] course it's the it's the the feast and
[1:03:27] he said then here Balam acts as the one
[1:03:30] that is the prophet to instruct it.
[1:03:33] Yeah, it is. It is. Constantine has
[1:03:36] brought together paganism with God's
[1:03:40] religion. Yeah. Now, I want to show you
[1:03:43] something. Now, it has doubled down on
[1:03:46] the idea that these spirit-led men are
[1:03:50] heretic.
[1:03:53] Because now we have a religion that
[1:03:55] represents true
[1:03:57] Christianity according to the throne of
[1:04:01] Rome.
[1:04:03] Now you say, "Preacher, that don't
[1:04:05] matter." Have you ever read of the Edict
[1:04:07] of
[1:04:08] Thessalonia? Hey, an in Edict of
[1:04:10] Thessalonia. Now, I'm going to watch
[1:04:12] you. Watch these dates again. 303
[1:04:14] illegal by the Roman Empire. In 313,
[1:04:18] legalized Christianity by the Roman
[1:04:20] Empire. In 3:25, a forming of the Roman
[1:04:24] church by the Roman Empire. But then we
[1:04:27] find out not but a few days after that
[1:04:30] in 380 we find out that there's an edict
[1:04:33] of Thessalonia that actually
[1:04:37] makes the church of Naa the only way to
[1:04:42] worship.
[1:04:45] I I actually have a translation of this
[1:04:47] edict. I think it's important. Can I
[1:04:49] read it to you? Yes. It is our desire
[1:04:52] that all various nations which are
[1:04:53] subject to our clemency and moderation
[1:04:55] should continue to profess that the
[1:04:57] religion which was delivered to the
[1:04:59] Romans by the divine apostle Peter. It
[1:05:02] has preserved by faithful tradition and
[1:05:04] is now professed by the pontiff Demus
[1:05:07] and Peter bishop of Alexandria a man of
[1:05:10] apostolic holiness according to the
[1:05:12] apostolic teaching and the doctrine of
[1:05:14] the gospel. Let us believe in the deity
[1:05:16] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:05:19] holy spirit in equal majesty and in holy
[1:05:22] trinity. We order the followers of this
[1:05:25] law to embrace the name of Catholic
[1:05:28] Christians. But as for the others since
[1:05:31] in our judgment they are foolish madmen.
[1:05:34] We decree that they shall be branded
[1:05:37] with ignominous name of heretic and
[1:05:40] shall not presume to give their
[1:05:43] convictions the name of
[1:05:45] churches. They will suffer in the first
[1:05:48] place the chastisement of divine
[1:05:50] condemnation and in the second
[1:05:52] punishment of our authority which is
[1:05:54] accordance to the will of
[1:05:56] heaven of what we should decide to
[1:05:59] inflict.
[1:06:02] It was the pagans that outlawed the
[1:06:05] religion. But now the devil got in
[1:06:08] religion. Yeah. And made his own
[1:06:10] religion. And now the Christians who had
[1:06:14] been persecuted had now become the
[1:06:16] persecutors.
[1:06:18] You say, "Preacher, well now, now why is
[1:06:21] this so important? I'm I'm I'm a little
[1:06:23] bit in theology. I I like to study the
[1:06:25] history of things to see that brother's
[1:06:28] not just saying things. Right. These
[1:06:30] things are are are very logged in
[1:06:32] history in the history of the church.
[1:06:34] And and and it wasn't too long ago, I
[1:06:36] was reading a little article and and and
[1:06:38] one of the uh Lutheran churches were
[1:06:40] just praising St. Augustine of Hippo.
[1:06:44] And I was thinking, my goodness, don't
[1:06:46] they know?
[1:06:49] Don't Don't they know?
[1:06:52] Now, now St. Augustine of
[1:06:55] Hippo
[1:06:57] amazingly became the emperor just
[1:07:00] shortly after or he wasn't the emperor
[1:07:02] he was the influencer just shortly after
[1:07:05] this uh edict of
[1:07:07] Thessalonica and it was his own
[1:07:10] teachings that caused the death of all
[1:07:12] the Christians.
[1:07:14] Now it wasn't just it wasn't just that
[1:07:17] he went out and said these all people
[1:07:18] need to die. No, that wasn't the way it
[1:07:20] happened. What's the devil? Remember
[1:07:23] Jesus said to his disciples, there will
[1:07:25] come a time when they will kill you
[1:07:28] believing right they are doing a service
[1:07:32] for God.
[1:07:34] Now the church itself has passed a law
[1:07:37] that commands the people to worship God
[1:07:40] under the trinitarian doctrine of the
[1:07:42] Nyian council and carry the name of the
[1:07:45] Catholic. St. Augustine of Hippo was
[1:07:48] immediately now if you if you follow his
[1:07:50] life, Augustine wasn't a Christian
[1:07:53] originally. He was a professor of
[1:07:56] rhetoric.
[1:08:00] Yeah. Now, I've heard a lot of rhetoric
[1:08:02] in my life, but let me let me give you a
[1:08:05] definition of rhetoric. It's called the
[1:08:06] art of persuasion.
[1:08:09] When he was a pagan, he was a professor
[1:08:12] of the art of persuasion. He taught for
[1:08:14] a living how to persuade people. So when
[1:08:17] he got saved to become a Christian, he
[1:08:19] believed that the art of persuasion
[1:08:21] ought to be used for Christianity. And
[1:08:23] he was a very a very easy guy. He
[1:08:25] believed in conversion like this. But he
[1:08:28] became very uh uh very uh how can I say
[1:08:31] it very discouraged with his lack of
[1:08:33] ability to spread this gospel as he was
[1:08:36] preaching it. and he got upset and began
[1:08:39] to change and found in the scripture
[1:08:41] where the Bible said in the last days
[1:08:44] the supper of the king's son was set and
[1:08:47] thou art to go out into the highways and
[1:08:49] the byways and compel them
[1:08:53] to come. So his scripture was to compel
[1:08:57] them to come. Now compel amen to you and
[1:09:01] me it actually means to preach the
[1:09:03] gospel to to say to them you need to
[1:09:05] come. But to them, compel meant. Amen.
[1:09:08] If a man is burning in a burning house
[1:09:10] and you run in and he don't want to come
[1:09:12] out, if you took a club and hit him in
[1:09:14] the head and carried him out, he would
[1:09:16] be saved for whatever reason. So he took
[1:09:19] Paul's teachings that a person should be
[1:09:22] turned over their body to the devil for
[1:09:24] the saving of their soul. And he picked
[1:09:26] up the teachings of different scriptures
[1:09:28] and by it began to say, amen, that, oh,
[1:09:31] I can't convert you, but I can make you
[1:09:34] so scared of persecution that you'll be
[1:09:36] converted. And by that, amen, from the
[1:09:40] time of the passing of that law in 380
[1:09:43] all the way up to the 1500s, that's
[1:09:45] where brother Bam said 68 million
[1:09:47] Christians were killed by the sword
[1:09:50] under the teaching of St. Augustine
[1:09:52] Hippo. Now you say, "Preacher, it don't
[1:09:54] matter what we teach." It does matter
[1:09:56] how you approach the gospel because he
[1:09:59] approached it in such a way that those
[1:10:01] spirit-led men became heretics. That
[1:10:04] that that manifestation of the Holy
[1:10:07] Ghost, it was a heretic idea. And you
[1:10:10] ought to be killed for it. Listen, let
[1:10:12] me say this. That doctrine still lives
[1:10:14] today.
[1:10:16] That doctrine still lives today. Why do
[1:10:18] you think they threw them out in the
[1:10:20] early 1900s of their denominational
[1:10:22] churches? Because of the manifestation
[1:10:25] of the spirit and would be coming to the
[1:10:27] church. But man said they would shoot
[1:10:28] them with bullets. Stand there and shoot
[1:10:30] them with bullets because they were holy
[1:10:32] rollers. He said, "Oh, but he said them
[1:10:34] bullets would hit their clothes and fall
[1:10:36] off in the floor." Yes, sir. Because
[1:10:38] they were worshiping God under the power
[1:10:41] of the spirit. Amen. What we're looking
[1:10:43] at is that that devil is now getting off
[1:10:47] of his white horse of innocence and he's
[1:10:49] getting on a red horse where he's going
[1:10:51] to carry a sword and he's going to take
[1:10:54] peace from the earth. Now he's doing it
[1:10:56] under a Christian religion. You say,
[1:10:58] "Brother Wayne, what what what what this
[1:11:00] is all hundreds of years ago." I don't
[1:11:03] have time to read it, so maybe we'll get
[1:11:04] to it later. But these are hundreds of
[1:11:06] years ago. Why is this so important this
[1:11:09] morning? Because the Bible tells us,
[1:11:11] amen, that the image of the beast will
[1:11:16] exercise the same power as the beast
[1:11:19] that was before it. And we seen Jesus
[1:11:22] told him what was going to happen. And
[1:11:24] it happened exactly the way he said it
[1:11:26] would take place. And we have been
[1:11:28] received a warning from God in this last
[1:11:30] day that there will be an image rise up
[1:11:32] to that same beast that was in AD 3:25
[1:11:36] taking its doctrine and it will be known
[1:11:38] to us as a Protestant denominational
[1:11:41] churches in the last day and they will
[1:11:44] persecute everybody that don't come
[1:11:46] under that trinitarian doctrine in the
[1:11:48] last day. Now preacher, you say, "What
[1:11:50] are you talking about? They've already
[1:11:51] kicked us out. They've already made us
[1:11:53] heretics. We They can't fellowship with
[1:11:55] us already. But listen friends, there is
[1:11:57] a persecution coming. There's a
[1:11:59] tribulation coming where they're going
[1:12:01] to drive out that foolish virgin and
[1:12:04] they're going to tear it to pieces. Oh,
[1:12:06] but that eagle has come among us. And he
[1:12:09] said, "Oh, before it gets started, God's
[1:12:12] going to take this bride up off of the
[1:12:15] earth."
[1:12:20] Do you see the history? The history
[1:12:25] explains it explains the reality of what
[1:12:29] a prophet was teaching directly. Yeah.
[1:12:35] Now, when's the last Protestant preacher
[1:12:39] that you heard say denomination is the
[1:12:42] mark of the beast?
[1:12:49] William Brandham.
[1:12:52] In Matthew 13, it said just before the
[1:12:54] end time that they would be bundled for
[1:12:57] the burning.
[1:13:00] Whoever said Baptist and Methodist and
[1:13:03] Lutheran and Presbyterians and are all
[1:13:05] the same.
[1:13:08] They would they would argue to the end
[1:13:10] of the world that they're different.
[1:13:12] Yeah. Yeah. But the prophet said, "Every
[1:13:13] one of them are the same
[1:13:16] because they're birthed out of the
[1:13:18] organization of their mother, the
[1:13:19] harlot."
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] Organization. See, it birthed them out.
[1:13:24] Brother Brandham pulled them all
[1:13:26] together and laid you know that there
[1:13:28] was a beast. And now here's the image of
[1:13:30] that beast. You said, "Preacher, why you
[1:13:32] say it?" Because brother Brandham came
[1:13:34] to the earth to declare this to you and
[1:13:36] I. Come out of her, my people, and be
[1:13:39] not partakers of her fornication. What
[1:13:42] was he doing? He was calling you out of
[1:13:44] the system. Now, those systems are
[1:13:47] shooting this message. They're shooting
[1:13:48] that prophet. They're doing everything
[1:13:50] they can to Amen. Now, don't you think,
[1:13:53] Amen, that some of these critics don't
[1:13:54] have the backings of denominations and
[1:13:56] everything else. Brother Man was wrong.
[1:13:57] He's wrong on this and he's wrong on
[1:13:59] this and he's wrong on this. Amen. I
[1:14:01] tell you what, they want him to be
[1:14:02] wrong, but he's not wrong. And he warned
[1:14:05] this church of the living God against
[1:14:07] organization. Don't you ever organize.
[1:14:11] Come on, church. It ain't a long ways
[1:14:13] from the message. Organizations tried to
[1:14:15] come right in among us. Amen. They've
[1:14:18] tried to make us a new capital. And I
[1:14:19] know it ain't going to be popular, but
[1:14:20] it's the truth. They've tried to make it
[1:14:22] from Rome all the way to Jeffersonville
[1:14:25] and give us a new headquarters of how to
[1:14:27] worship our God. But I believe the sons
[1:14:30] of God are led by the spirit of God. And
[1:14:33] we will worship in liberty. We will
[1:14:36] worship in the spirit of God. We will
[1:14:38] preach this Bible and its truths before
[1:14:41] the children of God. We will not be
[1:14:44] conquered.
[1:14:47] We will not be conquered.
[1:14:50] So, preacher, they'll throw you out.
[1:14:51] It's all right. I've been thrown out of
[1:14:53] better.
[1:14:55] Come on. There's a message running in
[1:14:58] among the church of the living God. Come
[1:14:59] out of her organizational system. Let's
[1:15:02] all get together and talk this out and
[1:15:04] figure out and we can get this doctrine
[1:15:06] all worked out. I don't want nothing to
[1:15:07] do with it. I want nothing to do with a
[1:15:10] bishop over the teaching of true word
[1:15:12] tabernacle and somebody off somewhere
[1:15:14] telling me, "Don't you preach it like
[1:15:16] this and don't you preach it like that."
[1:15:17] We will preach it according to the
[1:15:19] dictates of the Holy Ghost that comes
[1:15:21] through this Bible. It is a Roman
[1:15:24] doctrine to try to put power over this
[1:15:28] church. You pastors need to sit down and
[1:15:31] play a tape. It's Roman Catholic
[1:15:34] doctrine to try to employ power over
[1:15:37] this pull pit. There is but one that has
[1:15:39] power over this pull pit. It is the
[1:15:41] power of our Lord Jesus Christ who is
[1:15:44] the only God who is the only man that is
[1:15:48] the intercessor between God and man.
[1:15:50] Amen.
[1:15:53] If you get a good look at organization
[1:15:55] and it's and what it done throughout the
[1:15:57] ages, then you can understand why men of
[1:15:59] God will flee it like the plague. That's
[1:16:03] right. Well, you're not cooperative. No,
[1:16:04] I'm not.
[1:16:06] Amen.
[1:16:08] I'm not cooperative at all. Yeah.
[1:16:11] Because
[1:16:13] because they're going to call us
[1:16:16] heretics
[1:16:18] for the purpose to persecute.
[1:16:23] If I can call you something bad, you
[1:16:25] know,
[1:16:27] brother Bam said that's what they did
[1:16:28] with Jesus. They called him every dirty
[1:16:31] name, every filthy name. He said, "Bo,
[1:16:33] they had that going, didn't he?" He said
[1:16:35] they had that going among them so much
[1:16:37] that when Jesus come in the room, not a
[1:16:39] one of them Pharisees would wash his
[1:16:40] feet cuz they didn't want to be
[1:16:42] identified with him because of the name
[1:16:45] they put on him. But there was one woman
[1:16:47] rent the whole thing. She said, "I don't
[1:16:50] see him the way you see him." To me,
[1:16:52] he's the Messiah. He's the son of God.
[1:16:55] He's the prophet Moses prophesied. And
[1:16:57] he went, she went right to those feet
[1:16:59] and cleaned up his reputation. But
[1:17:01] brother, it cleaned up hers, too. Amen.
[1:17:03] And while she was washing his feet, he
[1:17:05] she heard the words, "Go and sin no
[1:17:08] more. Thy sins be forgiven you." I pray
[1:17:11] this morning while I'm washing the feet
[1:17:14] of the message of the hour that there's
[1:17:16] a power comes in this room that'll bring
[1:17:18] forgiveness of sin and forgiveness of
[1:17:21] Amen. and bring life into the hearts of
[1:17:23] the church. Listen, friends, this this
[1:17:25] is this is not a game.
[1:17:32] Come on.
[1:17:36] Brother Maram said, "There'll come a day
[1:17:37] there's people that'll believe this so
[1:17:39] strong they would give their life for
[1:17:41] it."
[1:17:44] I believe I'm looking at people like
[1:17:45] that right here this morning. Yes, sir.
[1:17:48] Unconquered
[1:17:50] by tradition.
[1:17:52] Unconquered by man-made religion.
[1:17:56] Free.
[1:17:59] Free. Thank you. So, Brother Wayne,
[1:18:05] it it answers questions, a lot of
[1:18:07] questions when you start studying it. If
[1:18:08] you got questions, it'll answer a bunch
[1:18:10] of them for you.
[1:18:11] when you get back there and you read
[1:18:14] brother Bram saying that Babylon is the
[1:18:17] only thing in the Bible that types
[1:18:21] denominationalism and Babylon was
[1:18:23] started by I won't preach it because I
[1:18:25] want to get in it later but Babylon was
[1:18:27] started by Kush and his son Nimrod made
[1:18:29] it go across the world but you know what
[1:18:32] it was it was a forced worship
[1:18:36] it was a forced worship
[1:18:38] do you see that that on that horse rider
[1:18:40] do you see that the pagans were forcing.
[1:18:42] Yeah. Then the Christians were forcing.
[1:18:45] It was all it was force.
[1:18:47] It was it was compliance and force. You
[1:18:49] come you come under this
[1:18:52] showing you it was from the devil.
[1:18:55] Brother Ram was so against it. He didn't
[1:18:57] even like the alter calls the way they
[1:18:59] were doing them.
[1:19:01] Yes, sir. Somebody said, "Brother Ram
[1:19:02] didn't believe in alter calls." He did
[1:19:04] believe in alter calls. He believed you
[1:19:05] could come right up and get the altar
[1:19:06] and pray. Yeah.
[1:19:08] But he he was so against the idea that
[1:19:12] somebody would go out and get a hold of
[1:19:13] somebody and tell them they need to come
[1:19:15] to the altar.
[1:19:18] He said, "You'll make them 10 times
[1:19:19] harder to win to Christ."
[1:19:22] Amen. Because we It's not force.
[1:19:26] That's why when you see somebody forcing
[1:19:28] people to worship a certain way, it's
[1:19:29] not it's not force. This is not force.
[1:19:34] And you've heard me say it a million
[1:19:35] times. I don't know why I'm saying it
[1:19:36] again today, but dance or don't dance.
[1:19:38] It has nothing to do. It's not us.
[1:19:42] It's not up to dance, don't dance. That
[1:19:44] that's called force.
[1:19:46] Amen. Amen. This message come to bring
[1:19:49] liberty.
[1:19:50] Amen. Bring revelation.
[1:19:53] Amen. You do you see it was a it's a
[1:19:55] it's a forced it's a forced thing that
[1:19:58] come up on Babylon. And and and you
[1:20:01] you'll see it happen. You'll see you'll
[1:20:03] see Nimrod and Kush and their and their
[1:20:05] religion and how that it became a forced
[1:20:08] thing. And brother Ram said something
[1:20:10] very beautiful. He said see what
[1:20:12] happened is Nimrod became the
[1:20:14] interpreter and the confuser
[1:20:17] of the language thereby bringing
[1:20:20] separation among the people.
[1:20:23] Do you see somebody's asked once in a
[1:20:25] while they say well why can't you walk a
[1:20:27] certain way? Why can't you walk with but
[1:20:29] when someone brings interpretation to
[1:20:32] scripture and then demands me to walk
[1:20:34] with that?
[1:20:36] Yeah. Right. How can we walk with
[1:20:40] anything? Right. But what a prophet
[1:20:42] taught. Yes.
[1:20:47] Now you you you got to be real careful
[1:20:49] right here because this is a very
[1:20:51] powerful area.
[1:20:53] Everyone should be able to hold within
[1:20:56] their heart their conscience and every
[1:20:58] preacher should preach the dictates of
[1:21:00] their heart.
[1:21:02] But when someone begins to force another
[1:21:05] group to believe it like this,
[1:21:10] you're going right back to Babylon.
[1:21:13] Yes, sir.
[1:21:15] Right back. Yeah.
[1:21:18] And if there wasn't a spiritled man in
[1:21:20] the pulpit Yeah. Yes, they get their
[1:21:24] way, right? Yeah.
[1:21:27] So, well, it's it's heretic. It's it's
[1:21:29] y'all a bunch of heretics. You can call
[1:21:31] us anything you want to.
[1:21:34] Amen. But we will worship God in the way
[1:21:38] that men call it heresy. Stand to your
[1:21:39] feet with me this morning.
[1:21:53] I've took you on a bit of journey. I
[1:21:54] hope it had been
[1:22:02] How many of you have a a clearer
[1:22:05] understanding of the east and west of
[1:22:08] the Roman Empire?
[1:22:15] that there were two capitals to Rome.
[1:22:19] Yeah.
[1:22:23] The Byzantine Empire we all call it was
[1:22:27] just the Roman Empire. Yeah. Ruled from
[1:22:30] Constantinople. Yeah.
[1:22:34] It was great
[1:22:36] struggles. And that's why you hear
[1:22:38] about, you know, sometimes three or four
[1:22:40] emperors at the same time. You think
[1:22:41] what? How's the all these guys? It's
[1:22:44] because there were different rulerships
[1:22:46] at the same time because the kingdom was
[1:22:48] so expansive.
[1:22:50] But that same thing lives today.
[1:22:58] It runs through
[1:23:00] every organized religion
[1:23:05] bringing force, control,
[1:23:09] dominance,
[1:23:11] to take away the
[1:23:14] liberty to just believe God.
[1:23:18] I've had people say things, brother
[1:23:20] Brown, teach certain thing, they can't
[1:23:21] understand it, and they well, they'll
[1:23:23] just, man, they'll pile up on you, you
[1:23:25] know, and how can you believe that?
[1:23:27] Well, I have seen vindication.
[1:23:34] One day there was John 6 and 66.
[1:23:40] It's a powerful number, isn't it? Three
[1:23:42] kinds of believers that preached out of
[1:23:43] John 6. in John 6 and 66. That's when
[1:23:48] when they started leaving
[1:23:50] them because Jesus said something they
[1:23:53] didn't understand. He said, "Lest you
[1:23:54] eat my flesh and drink my blood, you
[1:23:55] have no part." And they started leaving.
[1:23:58] And Jesus looks around at Peter. He
[1:24:00] would would you go
[1:24:02] also? And brother Bram says, you know,
[1:24:04] Peter, he didn't understand that no more
[1:24:06] than they did.
[1:24:09] He said, but he had saw vindication.
[1:24:11] Yes.
[1:24:13] So, it wasn't what was said, it was who
[1:24:15] was saying it.
[1:24:19] And once you see vindication, you may
[1:24:21] not understand everything you hear,
[1:24:25] but you know who's saying it,
[1:24:29] brother and I were discussing yesterday,
[1:24:32] just some of these little areas, it
[1:24:33] sometimes brings uh misunderstanding.
[1:24:36] Somebody don't understand this way or
[1:24:37] this way. Y'all remember when Bud
[1:24:39] Southwick and Brother Bram killed that
[1:24:41] grizz that caribou up in Canada? He
[1:24:43] killed it way up there and they were
[1:24:44] carrying that 42 inch
[1:24:48] caribou down the side of that mountain
[1:24:51] miles. Brother Josh sitting there we we
[1:24:54] carried out his his elk that time.
[1:24:56] Remember remember packing out that head
[1:24:57] and how heavy that thing was. Can you
[1:24:59] imagine packing that caribou all the way
[1:25:02] out that
[1:25:03] mountain? Brother Bram actually says it.
[1:25:06] He said, "Bud carried it a while, then I
[1:25:08] carried it a while." He said, "Bud
[1:25:11] carried a while and I carried while
[1:25:12] Brother Bram's trophy, but Bud helped
[1:25:13] him carry it."
[1:25:16] See, there's sometimes you come to
[1:25:18] points in the message that you don't
[1:25:20] know how to explain. Sure. And somebody
[1:25:22] said, "What about that?" Well, I just
[1:25:24] take the trophy, hand it to brother
[1:25:26] Brandham,
[1:25:29] and let him carry that
[1:25:32] and just say, "I don't know. It's what
[1:25:33] he said." you just move right on.
[1:25:37] Because someday he'll make it clear to
[1:25:39] you and I
[1:25:42] I pray that something be said this
[1:25:44] morning to inspire you. But I want I
[1:25:46] want y'all to know something without any
[1:25:47] shadow of
[1:25:48] doubt. This message is right.
[1:25:54] Satan has tried to take your worship to
[1:25:57] himself and a prophet pulled the covers
[1:26:00] off so he couldn't.
[1:26:02] Oh, I love him this morning. Don't you?
[1:26:04] Don't you? Brother Ben, you have
[1:26:06] something.
