all in the name of the Lord and amen we're going to go to the word this morning we want to if we could just to Bow our hearts and a word of prayer and ask you this morning that you would just let the Holy Spirit deal with your heart today say God I I I need you to speak to me Father amen I need this quickening power to to speak to my heart father we bow our hearts this morning because we love you and father we bow our hearts knowing that you are the god of heaven and we ask you now this morning that may you come into this meeting Lord as you already have and father we pray that your grace now would direct us Lord that would strengthen Us in the power of your word and Lord knowing our positions and understanding what you have given to this age we ask you father that we would that we would release ourselves in your presence and father we would just enjoy the grace that you have given us now father the sick and the needy I pray that you would move and sweep across this congregation in in an anointing that would break every Yol Lord if there's somebody that don't know you may you introduce yourself this morning Lord and not just in a Creed or denominational thought but may the power of the Resurrection May you may you come by like you did to Paul on the road to EMAs and may you introduce us Lord we ask you father this morning don't be a stranger Among Us Lord but reveal yourself father we invite you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles this morning we want to turn into the book of Ephesians the first chapter I want to read again from the 11th verse amen I uh if you've been following along a little bit in our studies I've I've been reading uh from Daniel the 11th chapter uh the people that know their God shall do great exploits and uh I just started from The Book of Daniel moving into a little bit of a thought on uh the exploits of faith and those have led me to the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I've been reading from here in my personal studies this just personal notes I've been studying on milk honey and Giants so it's kind of a subtopic for me uh but uh I know there's a lot of giants in the land of inheritance and I've been I've been studying a few of the Giants and Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11 in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen may the Lord bless the word this morning as you could be seated I want to continue uh on the exploits of faith and uh I I in in this portion of the word I want to uh just speak to you about this again uh the in inheritance amen that we have received of course I I would just maybe back up just for a moment to you and and uh bring you up to where I'm looking uh but if you remember when we switched to this Ephesians chapter one on the inheritance we went back and found that this word inheritance uh being translated a little different than all the other words uh inheritance in the New Testament and it was speaking more about the casting of lots like they divided the land in the days of Joshua when it was divided among the children of Israel given to each tribe and that they they was given that inheritance now uh The Inheritance that they were given matched exactly what they were told by their mothers in their birth when they in Genesis Chapter 30 when the wives of Jacob had the children of Israel they called out their names and their birth now it took about 400 years after they went into bondage before they were able to possess those names and those names beginning to move into the land and remember uh the tribe and the land match together and Joshua was giving them marching instructions to go take the land and what would belong to them now showing that their inheritance were predating their even their own existence their their names of their tribes were the name of the land they were inheriting showing that predestination had gave them the position they were going to that they wouldn't just going to take land didn't belong to them but the land they were taking they were taking what belonged to them but other people were living on it so just because there's something on the land that belongs to you doesn't mean it doesn't belong to you it just means that it was yours to begin with and then something has moved upon it and so the inheritance that we have brother Ram said somebody had to leave you something he said we've obtained an inheritance somebody left you something before the foundation of the world it was a name written on the book of life that the lamb would be slain and you'd be recognized with it so our inheritance was a name written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation ations of the world and we know that the people who have their names on that book that is the title deed of redemption to the entire Earth so we're connected to the promises in the Book of Romans where Paul had spoke of of Abraham and how that Abraham had been made the heir of the world so all the promises that the church have is connected in a link to being the heir of the world so if we're going to have a redeemed Earth then to to live on a redeemed redeemed Earth you're going to have to have a redeemed body so we're going to live in a redeemed Earth on a redeemed body in a redeemed body so we're looking at the promises amen of that portion but yet we understand that in the age that we're living in this inheritance of course is by predestination uh if you like it in the Bible it's Romans chapter 8: 29 and 30 he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he called and whom he called he justified and them he justified he has already already glorified according to Ephesians 1 and verse 5 amen we'll be reading from the New Testament book of Joshua having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his own will amen isn't it amazing that we could got a new testament Joshua and he said that we were actually predestinated unto the adoption of children you can use the word the placing of children amen into the good into the good pleasures of his own will in other word The Mystery of the will of God concerning your position in the word that was written before you ever came according to the the the book of the adoption brother bam tells us that the land that we're moving into for possession is not a natural land but a spiritual land as the children of Israel under Joshua moved into the land of promise it was a natural land with natural Giant with natural walls amen it was a natural battle under natural circumstances but we as the gentile people are a spiritual seed we're inheriting a spiritual land we have spiritual promises we are fighting spiritual Giants there is spiritual walls there are spiritual problems amen but as they said in the days of the natural we are more than able to take the land then the spiritual Joshua of this age has said to us we are more than able to take the land and that was some calebs among them amen that have to had to wait for 40 years amen but they're still able to to take the land and and they're still ready Amen to take the mountains that God has given to them so the promises that God give to you he give to you emphatically and gave them to you as a designed will of God but you've got to be ready to throw the devil off of your property you've got to ready to fight for what God gave you if you're certain that God gave you I believe that this in the Paradox brother bam says it very clearly he said I I believe and understand there's going to be an Ephesians to this age and in Paradox he says it like this it's promised another Ephesians it's predicted in the scripture we're going to have an Ephesians again and he's causing and speaking of Joshua moving into the promised land as an Ephesian to the move amen they worked under the law of Moses but the law could never take them into the promises but under the grace of God which was Joshua he came and positioned them in that land and brother B is typing that to this age and he's showing you that when the Holy Ghost comes it will position you in the lands of promise and in that Land Of Promise there is to be an Ephesians to it if there's an Ephesians to of course this land that we're in he's showing us then that the Ephesians or the moving in to the land is not the going into the Millennium as many people would like to think amen we are going to be the sons of God in the Millennium I agree with that greatly but brethren we are now the sons of God Amen in 1 John chapter 3 it said we are now the sons of God isn't it and amen look what he says here in the adoption the Canaan does not represent the age of the Millennium it represents the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they killed and burned and took cities and there will be no death in the Millennium so what what the Canaan land represented was not the Millennium to the bride it represented the age of overcoming in the land of adoption and here we are this morning amen treading out the land of adoption the positioning of the church where they belong and and and what God has given to the church it's an inheritance amen God left us an inheritance and our inheritance is sunship amen I I think it's powerful this morning to be a Son of God that's what God left you to be a Son of God Amen what is your inheritance it's sunship to be a the Son of God and if you're a Son of God according to adoption brother bandam said this may choke you to death but amen but the men that are sons of God are amateur Gods so when he uh uh gives us um Mark chap 11 if you say un this mountain brother B said if the little Gods would say unto the mountain be thou moved and don't doubt in your heart that you can have what you believed it shall come to pass you can have what you have said when little Gods when you say when little Gods say unto the the mountain I believe that this is the hour for it I believe that this is the time of the manifestation of the sons of God I believe that the prophet announced it we're in the Ephesians now there was a time of the coming out of denomination there was a time when the Revival was to come out amen but the Revival of the hour is not the coming out of denomination the Revival of the hour is moving into the promises that God has anointed you to believe and stand on and I believe that's where God is leading the church today is into every Divine promise that he has made it's a praise of manifestation it's where amen I love how brother Ram says things he said we're true sons and born sons and filled Sons speak the word of God and it's backed that's right the only way you could move a mountain would be deity speaking and you're a Son of God and you can receive God which is Zoe's own life then you become a part of God Amen I I love some of these quotes I I want to maybe just lay them out here when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart places it upon his lips it's the same as deity speaking and every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man I love it don't you there is a people that Satan cannot stand before now why can't he stand in front of them because they know their position with God and they have been given the word to speak and that word spoken will defeat Satan anywhere any place anytime under any form amen I believe it I believe that we can cut loose of every every uh hindrance and every thing that says these things are not true I believe we got a write this morning and a prophet of God said this a man F fully surrendered to God is omnipotent amen and he uses Mark 11 to prove it I know you don't know that you're all powerful which are all powerful a Man was created with Dominion a believer in his contact with his maker amen is the greatest weapon in the world a believer in contact with God is the most powerful thing that there is this morning I know that the atomic weapon is powerful I know that many things are powerful I understand that but there is nothing of Greater prevailing power than a Believer with a divine revelation of who they are in contact with their God given the power of the spoken word they have the ability this morning to to Route out Satan wherever he is and whatever he's doing I think too many of us has forgotten what our origin is and what we' have been designed to do your origin is to master every circumstance perfect faith will Master every circumstance that the origin that you are of is to be a receiver of perfect faith is that right Faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing the word of God Amen and the age that we are living we have heard a perfect word to design a perfect faith into a perfect manifestation of God in the age we're living in I believe this I don't believe it's a time to forget in the in the in the battles of adversities and trials and troubles I don't believe it's a time to forget who we are I think it's a time to remember who we are let the word of God be our memory is that right I don't think I I don't think it's a time to forget in your heart who you are you are son and daughters of God Amen you the origin of God designed by God adopted by God to be and speak in his stad I love how brother Ram says it he says amen he's given you the legal right so he's given you the power of Eternity can you imagine you have God's power of Eternity amen it's pretty powerful amen when you have a power of Eternity you shouldn't forget it amen do you know that brother random says the spiritual Amnesia that we should be identified with John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse and he that believeth to me the works that I do shall he do also now don't you forget it if you do then you got spiritual Amnesia you've forgotten who you are you forgot what your testimony means how about when he said if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done and you're identified there to believe that's the truth he said if you say to this mountain and be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said shall come to pass you shall have what you have said can you be identified there do you hear him he's saying is your name there is that your identification amen he's saying to you watch now identify there to believe that is the truth if it hasn't he said then you're getting spiritual Amnesia and you have forgot you have lost your Christian balance you have lost your Christian balance when you don't believe that John 14:12 applies to the bride in this age you have lost Christian balance you have lost what the power of the blood has done we are not standing on these promises by our own ability we are standing here by the power of the blood that has cleansed us back to True Sons to field Sons you put us back on the other side with God Amen God ain't on one side the sun's on the other the blood has put us on the same side amen they amen I love how brother random says that he said the blood didn't just Bridge a gap he said it has removed the Gap and has put us back on the same side with God I don't believe we ought to lose who we are I believe we ought to believe who we are and stand on that word amen the everpresent water from the rock this is a a powerful quote I know brother Ray has spoke on this one several times and I'm going to hijack it just for a moment this morning amen but the everpresent water from the rock remember what brother Ram says he said there's a power remember you could speak a world into existence and go live on it he said Hallelujah that's what the power is in the church now so if you're wondering what power is in you here's brother bandam telling you you could create a world and go live on it he said but it's controlled by law remember the quote now it's controlled by law and the law is keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of Faith he said all things are possible to them that believe see the law behind it all things are possible to them that believe there's the law of faith and if you can believe it now watch the scripture amen how brother BR breaks into it whatever God will lead your soul to believe whatever God will lead your soul to believe I love that it's a it's a it's a it's a refrigerator quote whatever God will lead your soul to believe can I can I just say it to you like this whatever God would say this is your ground whatever Joshua would say to you this is your ground whatever he would lead your soul to believe amen now brother Ram would say it differently to to place it into this thought he he'll say every place of The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you so he's saying see whatsoever thing you believe amen it's possible if you believe it and then he turns to say God's got to lead you to believe it and the leading to believe something is the putting of your feet upon those promises so every place you put the soul of your feet belongs to you personally as a possession but if you're going to put your feet on it you're going to have to war to keep it whatever whatever Caleb that you decide that is yours you're going to have to keep it now now now Caleb didn't pick amen the worst ground in all of Israel he picked the choice ground in Israel he picked The High Ground of Hebron around the City of Refuge and he said that's where I'm going to live but because it was beautiful land that's all the Giants said that's where I'm going to live and the Giants was living in the land amen that he was choosing for his portion but God had led him to believe by a prophet that he could possess the land and he was more than willing to able to fight for the land that God said he could have I think this morning Mark 11 and John 14 and the power of this Rapture scripture that's laying here in the Bible that God has led us to believe by an Angel of the Lord that we are the generation to see the changing of our body amen we have seen and Believe by Revelation amen that we are to possess the spoken word we are to possess the promises of God in the age that we're living in so when you believe it amen that is your foot landing on that promise and the moment your foot lands on it as a giant to challenge whether it belongs to you or not but brother I was predestinated to the hour I was predestinated to the time there is something in me that can believe when I cannot see when I cannot taste when I cannot hear I can't smell it I can't prove it but there's something in me that believes it anyhow that is faith and faith is at the Helm of the Church of the Living God to manifest it in this hour I don't know about you but I I don't have any backup in me I don't have any let's just let the Giants have it I don't believe in that kind of religion I believe we are more than able to take everything that God said that we were able to take I believe there's a spirit on the church amen that is the spirit of adoption and is crying Abby father and is causing the church to be about the father's business and Performing the will of God woo brother I believe our name is on it don't you I believe our names are on it amen I believe we're to have the faith to to move into it don't you amen I know it's going to be a war but we are to have faith our names have been called our names are on it I I just break into this little thought right here but I'll say it like this if you ever see it's the will of God for you to have it isn't it different when you see it's the will of God Amen by faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith Rahab by faith Sarah by faith how how did they do it they saw it was the will of God for them to do it when you really see that it's the will of God that your life is fulfilling the scriptures of the end time and you will have no more argument of whether or not you're able to do it you'll know God called you to do it God equipped you to go it God anointed you to do it and you're more than able to do whatever he said you're able to do I believe in a full surrender to the word in the age that we're living in and the word that we have been spoken over belongs to us I I picked up a little something in our conference here over the weekend I which I want to appreciate your prayers for thought it was very successful the devil come along in a a tornado warning Brother Richard right in the front of the meeting I mean I'm getting ready to walk up to the pulpit there in Branson and tornado sirens are going off and people's phones are going off amen the Tornado by grace of God split and went around us and you seen the devastation it caused but God actually spared us am mean the it was it was quite a it was quite a moment but God spared us amen finally I figured out brother Eric what was happening them them sirens amen that was Devils telling other Devils you better get out of town the children of God are gathered up in a conference the power of God is about to be released listen I'm not running from no devil I think it's time that you realize the devils are running from you amen every time you climb out of bed and put your foot foot upon the amen the Devils begin to scatter because they think what is he going to do today do you know that there's a place that you can live that the devil don't even know what to do with you that you're the children of God he's tried everything he's shot at you every way but you're still standing because you're the Church of the Living God it's it's the will of God that you make it through my is the will of God it's the mystery of his will do you see it when you see it by faith then you're ready to move in to it when you see it your nam's on it you're ready to possess it I'll say it to you like this if you ever had a a rich Uncle to pass away or somebody who has great wealth in a family amen one thing about it amen just toward the everybody gets around them everybody amen got a claim on the on the wealth you know amen amen uncles and distant uncles and three times removed cousins and everybody they going to they're going to claim that wealth you know well I knew I was so and so and so never met them in your life don't know who they are but there's a blood connection somewhere so they're going to lay a claim and and you know maybe at the time of the reading of the wheel amen the room could be full of people everybody's got a opinion about who and what belongs to who you know amen maybe maybe for the 30 days between the time of the death of the time the reading of the wheel there's a lot of different arguments about who what belongs where amen so nobody is taking no cars nobody's emptying bank accounts nobody's moving into houses that really amen saying it belongs to them but they're not sure enough they're not actually moving into things until they know for sure when the wheel is read and that's exactly what the church ages have been that after the death of Christ there was somebody on the wheel amen the inheritors of all things were on that wheel but throughout the church ages man has claimed this and this denomination claims this and they claim this and this part claims this and all of them are claiming things that's why when you come up to the end time everybody's under confusion uson and you got so many people claiming so many things it's right in the end time when these things are happening amen but if you ever noticed amen that under the under the seven seal there was a silence that fell over the Earth amen you think about this amen at the time of the reading of the wheel amen instead of the people saying what belongs to him amen God's going to talk about what belongs to them amen and an executive of the wheel comes in and under the breaking of that wheel he by Authority begins to say well this belongs to this person this belongs to that person and as he's reading the names of those Wheels he has identifying you with a portion of what belongs to you through the power of that death oh I tell you something this morning amen that we have had a real a real reading in the last days and when the book was opened up and a prophet was standing there and he identified irus and Columbus and he identified Paul in the Ephesians but then he come down to the last day and begin to prophesy over a bride that what belonged to the Church of the Living God is Not Just justification or sanctification or baptism of the spirit but we possess him our portion is the fullness of the word that is returned to the church in the last days do you see there's a a reading of the wheel to silence to silence all the voice now now if you heard the reading of the wheel you know your names on it you're ready to move into it and you're not ready to move in until you heard your name is that right when you heard your name then you can move in and I believe I've heard my name I have been identified with these things and God didn't just say it he recorded it put it on tape where I can sit down and remind myself on a constant basis where I belong in the scripture and what belongs to me as a Son of God Amen I many people has heard the word preached they've heard the message but they didn't enter in because of unbelief according to Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 2 The Gospel was preached well unto them but they were the word preach did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it no Revelation in what they were hearing identified it to them do you know Revelation is what makes it your possession when you when it's a revelation to you it's it's yours your you're going to fight for it at that point amen do you see what it is now many people fail to see these things because of the human flesh because of humanity now the flesh is one of the greatest areas and trials of the church that I know of and identified of Christ brother bam said the Gentiles of that day failed to see it because it was in human flesh he said I wonder if we'll make that same mistake today if we'd failed to know him because he was the word for that age was identified in a human body now you think of this when God is doing something he does it in humanity in a human Veil and the people fail to enter in because of the veil that he uses now in identified of Christ brother bam said it like this he said how would you believe this now you that now you know that scripture is made plain he said don't let the veil of Flesh bother you now so if you're not careful because of the veil God uses you can't enter into the promise cuz you say now watch in this age that we're living oh that's just brother brandham that's just a prophet that them people are just manf followers amen but he's standing there manifesting the promises of God exactly to fulfill the scripture that Joshua would come among the church and identify them but if they can make the veil bother you then you'll not enter into the words because of the veil because you'll just well that's just a man that's just this and now that could translate real quick quick to the pull pit but we'll just leave it there amen in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother random says it like this you think I'm beside myself but I'm not we have got the devil's answer who's this belong to we got the answer we answered it we've got the answer we don't have to answer it 42 times we know who we are we know what belongs to us amen if you we got the answer to it amen now what he says Christ the word is living in me not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we've got his answer Christ the Risen and paid the price for our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed now watch what he says that God in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day Oh Glory do you see what he's saying to you God came in that redeemed flesh to redeem this flesh to work in this flesh the way he did in that flesh to fulfill the word in this day amen I know that's a lot of different fleshes but I I tell you this when you see it you'll become his flesh and it'll be one flesh amen what is it it's Christ could manifest in his word and watch what a prophet says when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed sees it and accepts it hey and sins are demolished unbelief is demolished look what he says and when a man is redeemed the predestinated seed sees it accepts it his sins are demolished it's separated see it drops in the ink of the blood of Christ and it's never to be remembered God forgets it he stands up as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God now we are the sons of God not what we will be we are now we are now redeemed we are now redeemed Redeemed by the blood now watch this because when you look at the trial message brother R going tell you something he's telling you the world is looking for nail scars they're looking for the nail scars to see the word in this age brother ROM says but we're not looking for nail scars we're looking for the word manifest amen man God makes a promise of these things and he does it just as he says now when you see it in the Rapture book he said you see him come down and declare himself from the heavens stand before groups of men declare himself the same as he ever did that's the truth the Bible opens you see the opening of that word is not just a man opening scripture and speaking them but it's when a veil of Flesh has been redeemed by the blood that can so manifest the word that you're not seeing Nars but you're seeing Jesus now I don't I don't want to maybe stand up here and see tell you all the things I see but I could use some of the other men and I think some of the men who didn't come into the message saw more than some of the men who are in the message like Tommy Osborne when he stand there and say you know we've all preached Jesus but this man manifested Jesus when Tommy Osborne said I've seen Jesus in a vision then I've seen Jesus in this man well listen when the word is manifested your seen Jesus come on he's prophesied in this age to not be here with us but he's been prophesied to be in us and we are here this morning manifesting the promises of the age we're living in amen that is the promise over your life that is the predestination over your life to see his coming in your own flesh In the Flesh of the Church of the Living God and identification quickening power amen it did it to us and quickening power will let us see his coming take the Holy Ghost to see it now it'll help you see his coming now I want you to see something 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 did Paul preach this or not did he not say in the mystery of the Rapture for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now we could preach all morning on the shout but I think we've got it the shout is the message is that right that is a sealed portion of fulfilled word Satan cannot fool with that it's already there whatever he does the message is already preached the message has already got into the church now think of this because if she if this is the shout then there is to be a voice of Resurrection now the Church of the Living God becomes the voice that they hear they become the voice of this message not just in the things they say but in the Declaration of the life that they live that the power that comes in the church amen I I I can I say simply what I'm saying to you that the son of man amen moves into the form of the Bride I challenge you to believe that the son of man is Manifest again today in the form of the Bride but we're so messed up with the veil that we want to keep it all in another age or another time under another Ministry but we're not ready to fight for the reality that God is revealing himself in the form of a bride by the people in the age of the people to the People by the people my goodness if God can manifest in you in the Church of the Living God in order to tear down every barrier if God can manifest in a Kentucky hillbilly in order to tear down every barrier and tell you that if God did it once he can do it again and the church is the place of his appointment this is where he chose a mighty Angel descends from heaven with a shout with a voice in Revelations 10 a mighty Angel comes down out of heaven with a book open a shout is a book open it's a declaration it's a command of an army officer it's a sword drawn and you know he knew the moment he brought that open Word Battle was on brother now I could I could stand here a few minutes but let me just let me just say this to you the moment that something is declared over your life that's when the battle is on you think you have a war let God call you into a Ministry it'll be 10 times worse amen I'm not saying that that you don't have a war I'm just saying that Satan is out to destroy by any means possible anybody who is willing to stand up and say God's promises are true if you'll do it in your home Satan will Target you if you do it in the church Satan will Target you if you do it in the world Satan will Target you are you hearing me amen the bride is the target of Satan the moment the book was open all hell was released against her but when all hell was released all of heaven was released at the same time because everything God has is behind the Church of the Living God taking the promises of this age now I tell you I believe this I believe Satan is trying to keep you from seeing it he don't care if you see God in brother ROM's age or God in Paul's age he cannot stand the fact that you could see that the Revelation has got to move into the church before there could be a change you see if he could keep it out of the church he could then disen the blood if he could keep it out of your life he can diseno the promises of God and the blood of God but I don't know about you but if God said we're able to do it I believe somebody will be past their abilities and the trials of their life and say it ain't nothing but the truth see Satan is trying to keep you from seeing it now watch what brother bam does he says he's trying to keep you from seeing it but as many as received him he gave power to become the sons of God so is it today when we see the great Holy Ghost move made manifest as we receive him to them he gave power to become Sons and Daughters of God that scripture isn't just for the days of Jesus but when you see Jesus in this hour it gives you a reception of something that can manifest now I know I know that you've heard the quote many times in Matthew 16 when he says the gates of hell are against it Peter I give you the keys of the kingdom and you will prevail against it in the gates of hell you will prevail against so the Gates of Hell brother Rand says he says see that's not what the gates of hell is against today he said it's against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever the Gates of Hell shall be against it but it shall never Prevail my goodness it shall never Prevail now watch what happens when you take this word and put it in religion it kills it dead power of transformation paragraph 163 when you try to take this word of God and put it in the religion of the world you bring death to yourself it kills the subject it kills the person you don't have to believe that see if you if you our church see if it's right then there's the boom that kills you that kills the subject in other words brother B said you take these promises going to a church they said well our church don't believe that he said boom there's what killed you the moment somebody says well we don't believe that and you join the we brother said somebody said to me brother BR we don't believe that who see he said you got a mouse in your pocket we and who he said it ain't you in the Bible he said it's you in that group you're with do you see it amen somebody said well that don't apply to this age Mark 11 ain't good for the church John 14 ain't good for the church we're just going to teach a little and believe a little and we're going to go on a Rapture but prophet of God said the moment you do that boom you have died right there in that place that's where you die Amen brother bam says it very clearly he said listen you've got to let everything fall aside take the word only stay right with that word and don't leave when God said it amen I don't care what education can prove my isn't that something they can prove educationally that you shouldn't believe that by the man said don't die with them he said just believe don't care what education can prove amen listen amen I I I know this very for a very fact amen the power of reasoning is the power of death when Satan wanted to grip the entire world in his hand he done it through the power of reasoning is that right amen look at this Amen in paragraph 68 brother R said God by his mighty Prophet seen exactly Vindicated by God and because another Prophet come in with a teaching that is contrary and disputed with Moses and tried to prove to the people people that Moses was wrong isn't that something when when a prophet will preach something and another man anointed will preach something contrary to that amen the prophet of God said look there has to be something wrong with that because Moses was the anointed one to bring the word listen now amen now you can you can switch names all around but it's the same Spirit watch God does God ever change his mind balam a prophet of God he went to B for his information he said but Moses went to God for his information there's the difference B goes to a school to get information B goes to a commentary to get information Moses went to the logos the pillar of fire to get information amen I tell you what the information amen was brought through the logos went out of God the pillar of fire it was the angel of the Covenant Christ the anointed one where was Moses getting this anoint oting his thoughts his information he was getting it from Christ the pillar of fire now it would be one thing if that was just abstract and that was all in another age but in Revelations 10 the Bible said the mighty Angel descended in this age with an open book of information for the Church of the Living God what the prophet was saying about the church was not his intelligence it was a Divine intelligence and I believe it was a crowning Revelation to the Church of the Living God can I say it like this there's nothing going Beyond it I don't believe that you're going to go beyond what this Prophet taught now can we can we hit a giant right here y'all ready to kill a giant amen there are giants in the land of Revelation there's Giants in that land but it's the land the bride was promised she was promised a land of revelation of Truth and prosperity through Revelation that was the way the whole church was built was on Revelation but in the land of Revelation intellectual Giants have grew up and they have taken things and compared things intellectually and made a fanaticism and an education out of divine revelation it's a giant in this age friends and then because of it other people amen they say well just take play the tapes only we don't need any Revelation other people they get to teach in other directions and they say well I I think I think I I knew a group one time they said well we read the church AE book one time and we're finished with it and I thought well you can tell you can tell amen they let any old spirit in they have no barriers whatsoever amen if you read that church age book brother Bram trails that serpent through church ecclesiastical Spirits he outlines nickis he outlines the looseness and traditions of man he shows you how what pastors should be and how they should act and how churches should be set up but if you're not interested in a divine order amen just read it one time set it aside then you ain't got to be see then you're not responsible but I want you to see something they I I I grew up with this just say what the prophet said but I found out they didn't mean it cuz when I started preaching the revelation of the son of man they didn't know he said it because they had picked out what part we could say now I'm just a little bit odd I believe whatever God leads your soul to believe if you can see it in the message go ahead and possess it and it don't matter what anybody says we can or can't have it is a giant on that land mhm it's on the giant is on the land of Revelation so therefore because there is fanaticism in the land of Revelation there are many who don't enter in because of the giant you see it amen it's back in the Old Testament they didn't even go into the land at all because of the giant but because they didn't go into the land they didn't possess what belonged to them they should have killed the Giant and possess the land you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying that giant is there of intellectual and formalism and just studying and learning but you got other guys who won't even study the message and they oh God have mercy I'm going to get in trouble for sure they come the pull pit and they'll say well I hadn't studied any I'm just waiting on inspiration and I'm sitting on the front row going I can tell I couldn't tell I could tell there was nothing put in it there's no heart in it there's no study in it there's no word in it and brother random told us he said the first sermon I ever preached he said I had everybody shouting he said I was crying we were emotional mess walked out and looked at the old pastor and said how' that go he said the worst sermon I ever heard he said what are you talking about he said well you out everybody emotional he said but you didn't put down no word he said I don't care how much emotion you get if the word ain't behind it you got no case and your case has got to be built on the word really We Are Spiritual lawyers and there ought to be a case for what we're saying and there order to be a word-based case amen if you get the word in it's line and its order the devil has no legal right to remain on the property that God gave us because God is the way hey I I believe it I really do now I know we don't have that problem here but I'm just telling you it's a giant in the land now if you think about the giant if you think about the Giants of that land in that land it was called Giants but remember Caleb said it was bread remember that he said the giant is bread in other words it's not no wory to me well in the age we're living in we call them Giants but really they're scarecrows Giants have become scarecrows in my age oh don't you get around that seven Thunder teachings don't you get around what do y'all know something brother Randon was the originator of a seven Thunder message come on church amen I can't help what anybody done with a message after brother bam preached it but don't tell me not to preach the revelation of the seven Thunders because somebody else done something with it I don't know what they've done with the Revelation but it's the revelation of the hour it'll create perfect Faith it'll give you Grace for Rapture it'll create Revival in the bride and ain't nothing but a scarecrow trying to keep you off of some of the greatest word come on church I know how it is y'all stay away from that revelation of the son of man you're going to get messed up and people believe in that peria stuff and they get all messed up well let me tell you peria is only a Greek word for his presence and if you ain't figured out this is the presence of God you ain't you ain't been sincere yet because this is the divine presence of almighty God and is coming to this age we don't have to have the spirit of the Peruan teachers to believe perusia is the presence of God it is the dissension of a mighty Angel come on Church we're not just believing Christ is here this morning we believe he's here in the form of a bride manifesting every word I know those scarecrows are laying there that scarecrow is all over good teachings amen but I am not going to let a giant keep me out of the land of the promises of the word of God so amen one guy come up to me said brother Wayne you can't preach that Ancient of Days amen out of Daniel 7 is that cloud out there in sunset Mountain I said I can't he said no I don't see how that ties together at all I said well I don't need you to see it brother I see it just fine and just because somebody is blinded to what God has did don't mean God put Shackles on my eyes but when he gave it to me and let me see it in the word I've got to write by the grace of God to preach the message of the hour if I got to preach it on a rock on the side of a creek by myself but by the grace of God God has gave us a good church and a good pastor and a good congregation who's ready to take the lands of promise we ain't scared come on Church you might fool me but you can't deceive me you might take a quote and use it wrong but it won't hold me long Amen in Matthew 24:24 it said the deceive the elect if it were possible but it is not possible to deceive the elect of God we going to come out of it well glory to God you know what creation's waiting on you waiting on somebody that'll walk over the Giants to preach the promise waiting on somebody that will ignore every scarecrow and believe the word of God somebody will put a sword in their hand and fight for the land that God gave him this message is right the doctrines are true it's worth preaching it's worth believing it's the hour that we're living in I know I know what Satan's trying to do he's trying to reason you out of these things things isn't it reasonable that we should be preaching about the first coming instead of the second isn't it reasonable that we should preach more about the blood than we do about the things in this age and isn't it reasonable think about this isn't it reasonable that if we just left off serpent seed and and water baptism we just taught some some more fundamental things and and we didn't have to talk about brother you can say what brother R says but just don't quote him you know now I carrying the sword I seen brother R is okay if I preach I Brother s I've seen these bunch of cowards they can quote Charles Spurgeon oh Spurgeon said that all over the Facebook all over the Internet Charles Spurgeon this and Charles Spurgeon that well they ain't going to put the rest of what Charles Spurgeon said when he said I want to go home smoke a cigar it's incense them to God or in the days of Charles Spurgeon when they put out amen be like the be like your preacher your favorite preacher and trying to give the kids bubblegum cigars where you can be a theologian not have the cough yeah you're going to quote that guy but ain't got for sing to quote a prophet of God that lived an infallible life of Jesus Christ in the age we're living in but I don't know about you amen but the land I have is a current message in a current age and every devil of Hell might be against it but brother we'll fight through it we'll fight through every line of it until the promises of God are preached my Satan is reasoned with him he's reasoned against the word of God that's what he done he said that's the same thing the devil does today every heartache every sickness every death every little sick baby every grave only heals side was just believe disbelieve one little word not exactly throw it out just misquote it and reason it boy don't just throw it out just reason it a little bit now when someone says to you well I tell you I got a little reason you shouldn't believe what brother Ram said here well let let let me just read what he said separate yourself and come out of it one thing I want you to notice he he said he obeyed Abraham obey God's word to the letter always remember that's my message you must obey the word knowing anything contrary to it leave it alone it may look good but don't reason against God's word the first thing Satan did was reason against God's word and Eve she never doubted it she never she never doubted it she just reasoned it Satan reasoned it and that's the way he does today if isn't it reasonable that we should do this isn't it reasonable if it's against God's word leave it alone it's the voice of Satan Mercy people say they never haven't heard the Devil talk to them you haven't when that little girl standing there telling you it's okay to cut your hair isn't it reasonable that you could just put on a little bit of this makeup and cut your hair and look like the rest of every world isn't it reasonable it ain't nothing but the voice of the the devil come on you can identify it there easily but identify it over here where a prophet of God said that if you say unto this mountain greater is he that is in you and is he is in this world your deity standing in SHO leather that this is the age of the coming of the Lord in the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ any voice that will reason against that is the voice of Satan trying to distort and tear down the promises that God has anointed Ed you in this age let the word if you abide in me and my word abide in you listen get all these Creeds out get away from it and hold to the word of God because it's Christ and it will manifest itself now you said preacher who who would listen to reasoning people that's not born of God brother Bram said if a man is born to the spirit of God he doesn't listen to reason at all God cannot be reasoned with believed see not AB the shock he said therefore the word is to be fulfilled in this day it's the same part of the word that was fulfilled in that day then what is it this Bride is a word bride do you see that and something has been opened up to you it's a new land that's been opened to you what did he do he opened the Seven Seals and opened a new land for the church to come into as an inheritance the reason other Ministries didn't preach it in other ages because it wasn't opened it would be like asking why did the people not live in there in the time of pharaoh when he had them down in Egypt and they're and and and you're moving in the promises and Caleb is saying that's our land that's our mountain and somebody saying well yeah yeah but why didn't our forefathers live in here it's because it wasn't open to them but it's become open to the church in the last days it God opened the borders he opened the word that would release the church to move in and possess whatever that God would give to them they must be that word bride amen I love this they got to be that word bride so well I I believe all that word but a part of it now watch what he says Eve only failed on One Promise she only failed on One Promise the temptation of the enemy to face and now the people that's called for his name now the people that's called for his name name amen does that sound familiar the people that know God shall do great exploits the people that are called by his name look what he's saying of course it's his bride she has come into contact Again by the same thing not by denominational truth but by every word you see what it is we've come back in contact with every word now if God has gave to us every word and that is our possession every thing every promise is ours let's make it a land again it is a land you're going into and if God gave that to you you're going to have to hold that land you're going to have to hold it you're going to have to you're going to have to know how to possess that land I can tell you that it's yours but if you don't have a sword and an ability to fight a giant you ain't going to hold it Andy now watch brother randam says it like this he says you see you got to know it's a battle I believe we could say that this morning it's a battle and you got to know your enemy and you've got to know your armor your armor is the word and your enemy is anything that will reason against it now the voice of God watch the voice of God if any other voices are contrary to the voice of God it is the voice of the enemy to confuse us that we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke now many people don't think well if Satan would reason how successful would that be but he says the see listen he said remember Satan had a marvelous success and carrying out his threats of sitting on the throne but he did this amen by explaining away the word the value of the word in every age so what Satan's doing is trying to explain away the value of the word if God says something will be that way what value does that have to you what what is the value of that word that has been spoken over you if it was spoken by omnipotent it is omnipotent power to the person that it's been given given to you have received power of the spoken word over your life and then God fortifies that word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost causing you to believe that word and nothing can get in I know I know that it's an age of I know it's a great age and our our soul I mean how many how many people got born again in here this morning your soul you you're born again Amen Let me let me try to bring it to a connection here your soul has been born again but you're operating with 10 senses that are are not saved right would that be would that be fair to say that you have 10 senses that's not saved so you got 10 Gates that the enemy would come into the possession of the Soul so the soul possesses something and there's 10 gates to war against that Soul so so even though you're saved Amen to think that there would be a day when you don't have to battle is a sad mistake to think that you don't need to teach our young people how to war against the enemy it's a sad mistake because they are constantly under a battle and because they're under a battle Satan tells them you're in the wrong place or you're not even a Christian yet or you must not believe or you wouldn't be having these battles but it's contrary to that the real truth of the matter is the soul is saved and Satan is attacking from every gate that he can get to to dispossess you of the promise that God has made to you listen to the prophet in the greatest battle ever fought he said that's what's matter with our Pentecostal faith today we've left too many things to hinder it the faith that has been taught by the Holy Spirit has been living in us we've let too many things looking at somebody else oh my the devil's always trying to point at somebody's failure now Satan is trying to hinder Faith by pointing to a failure that's his purpose amen but why won't he point at the real thing you point at the failures but I got another hundred to point out that are the real thing somebody come up to me here long night is a as a preacher actually and he was a little anti- emotional he said well there's a bunch of them went to a PO to an altar and they were praying through and he goes through all this thing that they were doing and he said now where all of them at now and he was making cuz two or three of them had lost and some of the kids went back to the world where they all at now like it do no good you know I said well I said the ones that got something still with us why you want to focus on the ones that left why not focus on the one that stayed why you got to focus on Amen well nobody got nothing yeah somebody got something amen it was just the others didn't get it but we're going to focus on the one that didn't come on Church why don't we focus on where it works if you want to point out something they want to point out brother randam miscounted the number of people that were standing in the congregation when the pillar of fire came why you want to point out the number of the people why not really point out the pillar of fire really came well you can't prove a bridge fail well amen let me tell you this why not point out things that can be proven to figure out whether or not it is God if you would if a person was sincere that's what they would do they would look for evidence that prove something rather than evidence that would disprove it now you know I'm telling you the truth amen if you stand here today and bring start bringing evidences of people genuine Holy Ghost Field people amen that survived years amen well holy ghost don't hold people well why don't we use brother Ericson as an example and then you tell me that it don't hold somebody why don't we use brother Dallas for an example and then tell me Oh Brother come on we could just keep going through here what about brother Roman over there amen why not an example why not take those examples instead of a I tell you why cuz Satan's Waring on you and he's trying to get you to leave the land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost as an answer amen the prophet of God watch what he said he said it must be accepted in the mind then believe with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality every sense of the soul and the body is scared out with the Holy Spirit he said then your sinense your conscience of God and everything that's Godly flows through you and there's no doubt nowhere there's nothing that can rise up now what what he's saying if you purge that life with the Holy Ghost there's nothing that can rise up he said but then there's nothing can come up in that memory well I remember Sister Jones tried to trust the Lord and she uh Mr doe uh Miss doe tried to trust God for healing one time she failed but if that channel has been cleared out and purged and been filled on the inside with the Holy Spirit see that don't even come in a memory no matter what Miss Jones did or didn't do it's you and God together and nobody else but you two there you are now watch there's the battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks if it ain't it ain't how long you can make the war linger it stop it right now when you begin to believe for something and a devil starts speaking to you don't argue all day or all week with that devil take the word and cut his head off right then stop the battle right then the word said and then you'll find the value of the word you'll find the word has the power to blow the devil out wherever you can place his word listen you got to throw it aside brother man said see now watch if you come and you keep them memories and conscience and everything I might fail I might not be right he said don't you do that I might fail I might not be right do you see what he's saying you throw aside and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails I can't fail because I'm taking your word that's the battle said preacher what are you saying I'm saying that a prophet is teaching you how to war he's teaching you as a son and a daughter of God that your soul has received Christ but the gates of your conscience and your spirit amen the enemy is constantly going to attack through those channels but you got to ride as a child of God to cut that devil off now now I I say this to you you got to learn to war now I know seems like in this age that we're in now that it it turn turns people's stomachs a little bit to war people don't really want to they don't really want the battle they don't want to fight they seem like they turn ya and walk away listen let me tell you if you're going to remain in this you're going to have to learn to war you're going to have to learn to pick up your sword and war against this enemy or you will be defeated in this time that we're living in there is no place where you are are put where you're not going to war there's a giant on every land there's a there's a scarecrow in every area there's something to come in every place you said well preacher I don't know can can can I take a few minutes in the scripture with you amen I want you to watch this because in the days of Joshua when he led the children of Israel over when he brought the children of Israel into their land and they possessed that land do you all realize that not every giant was killed do you know that not every bit of the people were moved out of that land it's the truth and after Joshua was dead and gone amen God did not push away all all of the Giants or all of the people that were living in the same land they were promising in so somebody said well God must not have loved them or or the land would have be completely cleared but do you know it says over here in judges the 2 chapter he said I did not drive out from before them the Nations that Joshua left when he died and though I may prove Israel whether they keep the way of the Lord to walk into him as the fathers did it or not therefore the Lord left these nations without driving them out neither he into the land of the hand of Joshua these are the nations in which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel had had not known all the wars of Canaan only the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at least such as before knew nothing thereof and Joshua Judges the third chapter the 2 verse God says he left the Philistines in the land the promise to teach the generation after Joshua who wasn't in the first Wars of Canaan how to war now you ask yourself this question why after the baptism of the Holy Ghost would you still have to deal with reason and affection and conscience and feelings why would all these Gates still be why would all these enemies still be in this land god is teaching you to war he's teaching you how to pick up your sword and war against that devil listen you're not going into this land without knowing how to war I tell you I when I was sitting here reading that last night I hear that Prophet saying you got to pick up that sword and you got to cut that Spirit you got to do this what is it it's a it's a general of an army teaching a church how to war after he's long gone after he's off the scene he has left something to you to teach you to war you know what teach means it means to train right he's training the church and I'm sitting here listening to this tap greatest battle ever fought and brother man says in the middle of it he says see the reason I'm preaching this this morning is my dream with 6 second Smith my trainer y'all remember that he said look I'm preaching this for you because of that dream with my trainer here is a prophet training a church to be able to go to war with the devil long after he's off of the scene there's a church that still knows how to war they know how to defeat Satan anywhere any place anytime on any land because they know it belongs to them I know I know how the devil works I know how the devil worship will teach them how to War I don't want to fight well listen if you don't want to fight amen you can sit in the ring of observation and watch the war but men better than you are giving you the Liberty that you're experiencing amen men who are willing to put their their shoulder to the wheel and fight against this devil there's no place in this for a coward there's no place in this for somebody that won't pick up their sword and defeat this devil and stand against this devil I believe we've got young men and women here we've got young people that's willing to fight this fight of faith in this hour and they learned to war they've learned to go against this enemy in this age I know how the devil does it's a mind battle on every hand it's a trouble on every hand amen but we will not we will not let Satan move into our conscience or our memory or our reasing we will cut them off we will cut them off do you know that Joshua amen actually LED children of Israel into that land he led Children of Children of Men Who were called Old fighters who wouldn't fight isn't that the oddest thing the Bible called when the old Fighters died off he said then they went in the land I was thinking about it last night I thought old Fighters we're want people to fight and he's let old Fighters die off and I thought what's the difference I'll tell you the difference they fought one another they fought Israel they fought Moses they fought with God they didn't want to fight with their Giants they wanted to fight with the word they wanted to wrestle against the promises amen and when all of that was gone there was a children that didn't want to fight with God they wanted God on their side to fight with that enemy and I believe that's where we are in this age I believe the young people and the people of this age have come to a place they're tired of fighting with one another they're tired of fighting for position in the church and little jealous Spirits floating around and I won Fist and I won't fight and this is my land and this is come on church I think somebody's tired of fighting the quotes somebody's tired of hearing brother random say it one way and we got to explain it way I believe somebody somewhere is ready to believe every word of this message and move in by the promises of God I believe it I believe it I believe you said well preacher I want to move forward you know you can't go any forward to get Egypt off of you I was just studying I I I'm sorry if I got too much I'm going to preach instead of read it to you but I'll say it I'll say it to you like this amen those people came up to such a place that they had to change something to go any further if you read the Old Testament and see how in Joshua when they come up to the promises of God and they was getting ready to go in the generation that had grew up in the wilderness amen do you know that they had never been circumcised I thought about this the other day 40 years amen they had been in the wilderness under a covenant of God and had never even been circumcised I thought what exactly does that mean think about this that the the Covenant amen was no longer in their flesh amen the Covenant of God was not being with there was no difference in that generation than the others but the moment that God got ready to carry them in the land and Joshua the fifth chapter he lined them up on the banks of Jos of gilgal and he said to them joshu jhua you circumcised them all before this can go any further we've got to circumcise this generation now I want you to watch what happens the Bible said when he circumcised them that he rolled the reproach of Egypt off of them oh God I I I I don't want to get too physical here but I want you to understand that was in their flesh brother Tom the circumcised was in their flesh and as long as they wasn't circumcised they were constantly reminded of the failure of their fathers of the curse of not going over of leaving the land and inhabited because of giants but the moment God circumcised them he rolled away the reproach of the failure and the unbelief and the troubles and they position themselves aresh in the Holy Ghost oh God I thank God this morning there is a circumcised Church of the Living God that has come under the message of the hour and is ready to press in my Lord oh brother they're going to press in they're going to they're going to move in Heen let me tell you something God God done something for them brother Howard he didn't just lead them in the land he taught him to war he didn't lead him in the land and lead him harmless and and and and and result to every beast of the field he taught them to war so how do he teach them to war go to the book of I wish I had time to read this but if you go to the Book of Joshua and you read the fifth chapter and you see the circumcision of Israel the very next chapter in Joshua 6 you'll see that that Joshua comes to a possession of the land of Jericho and it's a walled City and he has no military knowledge to destroy that City he does not know how to bring that wall down he has no capacity to do it so he goes to the teacher he goes to the captain of the host and God descends like a mighty Angel and when he meets him in his presence he said I have come down as the captain of the host oh it was almighty God but he would coming as a captain Oh my he was coming as a captain to tell him how to deal with the battles that they were facing of Jericho now I want you to see something powerful right here he taught them to war but when God taught Israel to war he never separated warship from war god taught them war and warship move together with the Church of the Living God I know that you that went to the Army they never taught you trumpets or it never taught you to shout and rejoice when you're in the battle but when God came to Joshua he taught him that you can walk down the Walls is that right he taught him that you can take walls down if you You' do it 6 Ines at a time amen 6 Ines at a time he he would take a take off walking around the around the around those walls and by Vision now he's being taught by God to walk around these walls and he did it one time a day is that right and he did it under quietness amen which is I be honest with you as big a miracle as the walls coming down it was a miracle that he kept that bunch of Holy Ghost people quiet for six days he done sh with them these walls are coming down I know some of you sisters you'd have had a hard time doing it you'd been I know I know he's laughing but he's the biggest duck in the puddle you it'd be a miracle to keep y'all quiet for six days knowing that was but look he's teaching them to war in that land different than the other lands when they come over the Red Sea y'all know this when they come over the Red Sea it was after the Red Sea victory that they danced and rejoiced and had a wonderful time but in the land of promise he was teaching them to war and he was saying that before the walls ever fail you're going to be walking and in this walk it's going to develop into a worship and then trumpets are going to blow and then people are going to begin to Rejoice with one voice and when they begin to shout God God went to war with the church of Israel let me tell you this friends you don't have to have the greatest ability you don't have to be a great trained soldier amen you got to know how to worship the God of War yeah when they started worshiping brother Nathan the walls started crumbling around them because God was teaching them how to war let me tell you you as a Church of the Living God when Devils wore off and they wall off things that belong to you as a possession the way you bring them down brother is don't wait till after you get the victory you start shouting before you get the Victory and you'll bring victory in the camp of God well I don't know about you this morning but I think it's time amen the Church of God shout a little bit over what God is going to do in the Church of the Living God said I don't see nothing yet amen I don't believe we have to wait till we see it I think we can praise God before we ever see the victory we can begin it's our land it's a land of promise and a land of worship and a land of power say well brother Wayne you're going to have to go deeper than that all right second Chronicles chapter 2 of chapter 20 what about second Chronicles when Josiah y'all remember that sermon Against All Odds y'all remember that remember when Josiah seen a whole host coming against him and what he done he went to the house of God and began to pray and God told him amen the battle is not yours it belongs to the Lord he said well Lord what am I supposed to do he said then you appoint you some singers get brother Ben up and let him lead a few songs and when y'all begin to worship let the Warriors come behind the worshippers and I'm going to set up an ambush on them amen and you know the Bible tells us that by the time the Warriors got into the battle the battle was already finished because God had tore down the Devil by the power of worship let me tell you this morning I believe the devil amen knows he's in trouble when the Church of the Living God begins to Worship in the anointing and the power of God I think it's time to go to war and if it's a time to go to war it's a Time To Worship it's a time to shout it's a time to Rejoice it's a time to tell that devil I'm coming after what God devil you better pack up and move off I'm coming after what God has gave me by promise I know people think I'm crazy but I really don't care preacher I want another okay I'll give you one more what about David come on amen God in the Book of Judges said I left those in the land to teach my people war that had not being in the first Canaan somebody said why did he have to circumcise all them people amen before they went in the land you know why he circumcised them because without the circumcision there was no difference between Israel and the Nations they were Waring with but when they were circumcised in their flesh there was a visible difference between the men of God and the men of the world and when David had a circumcision he was not a warrior he was a Shepherd but he was circumcised on the eighth day he knew but he had come from the lineage of Jesse he had been anointed of God and when he started out into that battle what was one of the first things he said who is this uncircumcised Philistine he knew he could whip him he done been taught war god taught him how to whip a devil come on I'm not making it up the book of Psalms says he taught My Hands to War God taught His Hands to War God taught him how to sing God taught him how to play a harp God taught him how to worship out there on the side of the banks amen do you don't think you don't think that David had a funeral song going into the battle do you come on he's in the land where Joshua was shouted before the walls come down and David the Bible tells us he ran into the battle brother random helps us and says he danced himself into the battle because he knew the battle was already won he was fighting and uncircumcised Philistine let me tell you this morning I believe the Church of the Living God has been taught War by a prophet we've been taught War by a prophet amen how in the world will we ever move a devil get the Holy Ghost moving get the power of God the anointing will broke the Yoke the power of God will cast out demons Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover we don't have to lay down and cover up our heads and wish we had a God we represent the God of all the heavens and power we're not here this morning hoping and thinking and maybe we're here with a sword in our hand the can I give you three words to close give you three words can we stand three words no retreat no reserve and no regrets oh I'd love to preach an hour on it brother Bram said it brother Ben no retreat come on no retreat brother what does that look
