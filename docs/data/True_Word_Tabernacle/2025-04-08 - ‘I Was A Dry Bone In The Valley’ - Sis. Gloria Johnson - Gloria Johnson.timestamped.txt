[0:02] [Music]
[0:19] I was a
[0:22] dry bone in the valley.
[0:28] [Music]
[0:30] When
[0:32] Jesus found me,
[0:38] a
[0:40] dry bone in the
[0:48] valley when he put flesh upon me,
[0:55] said, "Son of a man,
[1:00] Can these dry bones
[1:04] live? And I
[1:08] answered, oh
[1:13] Lord, thou knowest.
[1:17] [Music]
[1:23] You have given us
[1:27] prophetic
[1:31] eyes so we won't
[1:35] believe
[1:37] Satan's
[1:40] lies. And
[1:43] although this world thinks us
[1:49] absurd, we will keep
[1:52] on holding to your
[1:57] word. Said, son of a
[2:02] man, can these dry bones
[2:07] live? And I
[2:11] answer, oh
[2:17] Lord, thou
[2:22] knowest, son of
[2:25] man, said, son of
[2:27] [Music]
[2:29] man, can these dry bones
[2:34] live? And I
[2:39] answer, oh
[2:44] Lord, thou
[2:52] knowest. We are the
[2:56] flowers and you are life's essence.
[3:03] May, oh
[3:04] Lord, you have the
[3:11] preeminence. For
[3:14] that's the reason why you made
[3:20] us to
[3:22] achieve your
[3:25] greatest purpose.
[3:28] [Music]
[3:30] said, "Son of a
[3:32] [Applause]
[3:33] man, can these dry bones
[3:39] live and I
[3:43] hurt?" Oh
[3:46] [Applause]
[3:48] Lord, thou knowest.
[3:54] Son of
[3:56] man, said son of
[4:00] man, car is the
[4:04] stri to
[4:06] live and I
[4:10] hurt. Oh
[4:15] Lord, thou knowest.
[4:18] [Music]
[4:24] Now I stand
[4:27] justified and I do
[4:33] appreciate the
[4:35] outpouring of your
[4:38] wonderful
[4:42] grace. Yes, I'm
[4:45] sanified from the
[4:47] bondage of sin.
[4:52] As your holy spirit now dwells
[4:59] within. I am no
[5:03] longer a dry bone in the
[5:07] [Music]
[5:09] valley since
[5:12] Jesus has set me free.
[5:18] [Music]
[5:20] And
[5:21] now I'm
[5:23] growing in his grace.
[5:29] And someday soon I'll see his
[5:35] face said son of a
[5:38] [Music]
[5:40] man
[5:44] can
[5:45] live as I serve.
[5:51] Oh
[5:52] [Music]
[5:55] Lord, thou know it.
[6:01] Son of
[6:03] man, said son of
[6:07] man, can be
[6:11] striled to
[6:13] live and I
[6:17] answer. Oh
[6:22] Lord, thou
[6:27] knowest. Thou
[6:29] know, thou
[6:32] know I
[6:34] [Music]
[6:36] answer. Oh
[6:41] Lord, thou knowest.
[6:44] [Music]
[6:50] [Applause]
