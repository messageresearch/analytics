[3:54] we pray amen and amen and God bless you
[3:58] today if you have your Bibles let's look
[4:01] into the Book of Daniel the 11th chapter
[4:04] The Book of Daniel the 11th chapter I've
[4:07] uh I've been stuck here um it's uh we
[4:11] had uh had planned to speak a little bit
[4:13] here uh from uh Daniel 11th chapter and
[4:16] tied into some things and the Lord just
[4:19] began to open and bring inspiration in
[4:21] it so we've stayed here for a few
[4:23] services and um I'm I'm still intending
[4:26] to carry this into the third pool um but
[4:30] we want to uh we want to just follow the
[4:32] lord here from Daniel the 11th chapter
[4:34] and the 32nd verse I want to take this
[4:37] and
[4:38] read and as such as do wickedly against
[4:41] the Covenant shall be corrupt by
[4:44] flatteries but the people that do know
[4:47] their God shall be strong and do great
[4:52] exploits amen can we also read here in
[4:55] the ninth verse of the 12th
[4:58] chapter and he said go thy Way Daniel
[5:02] for the words are closed up and sealed
[5:05] to the time of the end so we're finding
[5:08] out that the people that know their God
[5:10] is going to have to wait till the end
[5:12] that's the people he's talking about for
[5:15] the time of the end for many shall be
[5:17] purified and made wi and tried but the
[5:20] wicked see again from the 11th chapter
[5:23] the wicked shall do
[5:25] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[5:28] understand
[5:30] but the
[5:31] wise shall understand we thank the Lord
[5:34] for the words you could be
[5:36] seated I want to speak to you again this
[5:39] morning on the exploits of faith I
[5:41] believe this is about the third service
[5:43] that we've been on this subject uh but I
[5:46] I believe it's a very powerful uh thing
[5:48] that we're looking at here speaking of
[5:51] end time events and um and I'm one who
[5:55] believes that the Bible speaks
[5:57] specifically of people I don't believe
[5:59] believe that it's just a general
[6:01] statement the people such as like maybe
[6:04] just somebody might perhaps fall in to
[6:06] fulfill this word but I believe when God
[6:09] writes something he had an intention uh
[6:12] in it when he wrote it I believe he
[6:14] could have wrote your name right here I
[6:15] believe he could have listed the names
[6:17] of the people that he was meaning the
[6:19] people I don't think that God has to
[6:22] learn who the people are when they come
[6:24] but I believe he knew when he said this
[6:26] the people that he was speaking of a
[6:29] certain people people um and uh I I want
[6:32] to maybe continue here and saying the
[6:34] people of course these are the people of
[6:36] God and I I like it because this is not
[6:39] speaking of any specific church it's not
[6:42] speaking of any specific person as far
[6:44] as an individual but rather that the
[6:47] people being a group of people uh I
[6:50] believe I I love how the Apostle Peter
[6:52] will say it that we're A A A peculiar
[6:55] people a chosen generation the people of
[6:59] course coming from the book of Hosea
[7:01] where the Bible said they that were not
[7:03] a people shall be called the people of
[7:06] God according to Romans and I Chapter
[7:09] Paul also says that this is not just the
[7:11] Jew only but also of the Gentile um if
[7:14] you take that to Bible prophecy of
[7:16] course through Abraham's Covenant
[7:18] Abraham saw his seed as the stars and as
[7:20] the Sands of course those are the people
[7:23] and that would move right into the
[7:25] Gentiles according through scripture uh
[7:27] the Bible tells us that not Jew only
[7:29] only but also the Gentile which were Jew
[7:32] inwardly or that they were com into the
[7:34] abrahamic Covenant according to
[7:36] Galatians the 3D chapter the Bible says
[7:38] them that are in Christ are Abraham's
[7:40] seed and Heir according to the promises
[7:43] isn't it amazing just one seed but many
[7:46] promises meaning that you would identify
[7:48] through our lord Jesus the Romans The
[7:50] Book of Romans the eth chapter also says
[7:53] that if we are the sons of God of course
[7:55] by his Spirit then we're also joint HS
[7:58] with every promise that God has made and
[8:01] we're joint hirs with Jesus Christ this
[8:03] morning amen so our our uh blessings our
[8:07] our Grace comes from the spirit of God
[8:10] Amen according to scripture here in
[8:12] Philippians chapter 3 Paul was one of
[8:15] those people who wanted to know their
[8:17] God and he said that I may know him in
[8:20] the power of his resurrection so we do
[8:22] want to know God but we want to know God
[8:25] in the power of his resurrection matters
[8:28] matters who is introduced ing him to you
[8:31] and how that you know him uh when you uh
[8:34] think of this brother Ram will say it to
[8:36] know him by the word now to know him by
[8:38] the word's all right but it's a long
[8:39] ways from sufficient to know him by the
[8:42] word you've got to know him by the
[8:44] person of his resurrection amen you got
[8:47] to know more than just to know his word
[8:48] cuz even the devil can read the Bible
[8:51] and believe amen but but uh he's never
[8:54] saved amen the Bible the Bible is truly
[8:57] surely true and the devil above above
[8:59] all knows that God is real so you've got
[9:02] to have an experience with God that's
[9:03] different than just a learning knowledge
[9:06] amen of course many people had a
[9:08] knowledge of God but not a saving
[9:10] knowledge or not a resurrection
[9:11] knowledge uh so we want want to want to
[9:14] know that we need to experience him and
[9:16] then that's a a true experience when you
[9:18] go into the Bible Luke 24 you'll see the
[9:20] two were walking on the road to EMAs and
[9:23] the Bible says their eyes were opened
[9:26] and they knew him so God has experiences
[9:28] he has things that he does that you
[9:30] would know him of course I believe that
[9:33] that was an end time prophecy of what
[9:35] God would do in the last days that there
[9:37] would be a people who would see God they
[9:39] would know him in the power of his
[9:42] resurrection of course the two on the
[9:44] road to m is a beautiful picture because
[9:46] they met Jesus after his resurrection
[9:49] and was showing that Jesus would make
[9:51] himself known after his resurrection
[9:54] amen which is the ministry of the Holy
[9:57] Ghost today is that we don't believe
[9:59] that Jesus is dead I I am one preacher
[10:02] that don't believe that Jesus is just a
[10:05] symbol of history or he's just a man
[10:08] that lived 2,000 years ago but but I
[10:11] propose that Jesus Christ is alive and
[10:14] just as real this morning as he ever was
[10:17] in any day in history and it's one thing
[10:20] just to say that but it's another thing
[10:21] to know that by an experience with him
[10:25] or an encounter with God that's deeper
[10:28] than just acknowledge of I've read about
[10:31] him or I heard about him amen that's a
[10:33] little bit like a painted fire amen you
[10:36] can you can look at a painted fire but
[10:37] you don't get very warmed by that fire
[10:40] amen but but you literally can set by a
[10:42] fire all you can do is start
[10:44] one I don't believe that we have to just
[10:47] read about men who who met Jesus or who
[10:50] talks about Jesus but I believe that we
[10:52] can know him in a personal encounter in
[10:55] a very powerful way I believe we can
[10:57] know him today the same as did then
[11:00] actually Jesus in John 14 and 20 made a
[11:03] direct prophecy concerning this and he
[11:05] said at that day now he said ye shall
[11:09] know that I am in the father and ye in
[11:11] me and I in you a direct prophecy now
[11:14] that you would know some people don't
[11:16] even believe that you could know when
[11:17] you got saved but Jesus said you could
[11:20] amen some people don't don't even
[11:22] realize that they could know when they
[11:24] received the Holy but Jesus said you
[11:26] could so there is a way that you can
[11:28] actually know amen you can actually know
[11:31] that you're saved and I believe that you
[11:32] need to know that you know amen I I
[11:35] believe that is a something you should
[11:37] know that you know that you have met him
[11:40] Amen on a different level now I believe
[11:42] that's why this message has came to us
[11:44] that we might be able uh to know and to
[11:47] realize the god that we've met now uh
[11:50] when you go into the scripture of course
[11:52] you can read of the abrahamic Covenant
[11:54] and uh I I think it's a powerful thing
[11:57] because the Covenant that God made with
[11:59] his church again the Covenant was the
[12:02] Corporal body of our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:04] which was taken to Calvary and it was
[12:06] broken too now God took his part of the
[12:09] Covenant that he made with man and he
[12:12] took the Corporal body into heaven and
[12:14] he gave back the spirit of Jesus to the
[12:17] church so there's there's there's a
[12:19] covenant that God has made with the
[12:21] people now god holds his part of the
[12:23] Covenant in heaven tonight this morning
[12:26] his part of the Covenant what he holds
[12:28] as a covenant people
[12:29] is the very body of Jesus Christ but
[12:32] what the church holds as a covenant is
[12:35] the very Spirit of Jesus Christ and we
[12:38] have received of his Spirit now God gave
[12:41] that Spirit but I I would say that
[12:43] Through the Ages we could prove with
[12:45] with time and I'm not going to take it
[12:47] this morning but we could show simply
[12:49] how that through the Reformation men
[12:51] like Martin Luther who smoked the PIP
[12:54] and baptized wrongly believed in three
[12:56] gods and and yet he was uh he was a man
[12:59] who was used of God for reformation so
[13:02] it showed that God uses his Spirit
[13:04] sometimes not in a fullness when you
[13:06] look at John Wesley and the
[13:08] sanctification move it was a little
[13:10] further advanced than what John Wesley
[13:12] was amen but yet it was not yet in its
[13:15] fullness so just as a seed is put in the
[13:18] ground and you watch a seed grow through
[13:20] a a a season you can see the seed when
[13:22] it's first put in the ground maybe a
[13:24] piece of corn but you see it coming
[13:26] forward at first and it don't look like
[13:28] corn at all
[13:29] but it is corn but it's just in the
[13:32] stock or it's just in a phase of that
[13:34] corn but it's corn life the whole time
[13:36] so so the whole time it's corn growing
[13:39] to something but if you wait to a
[13:41] certain part of the season the sun
[13:44] itself will become strong and in that
[13:46] season of strength it will give the
[13:49] strength of fullness to the plant itself
[13:52] and then this the plant will begin to
[13:54] reflect the strength of what it's
[13:57] receiving and it can know its full
[13:59] potential in that hour so that's an hour
[14:01] of fullness and so is it in nature that
[14:03] represents God in fullness so has God
[14:07] given a fullness to the Gentile Church
[14:09] in the last day in the baptism of the
[14:12] Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost was only
[14:14] justifying some people or sanctifying
[14:17] others or others that came to the place
[14:19] where they had gifts and manifestations
[14:21] but there's got to come a fullness of
[14:23] that anointing of God upon the church
[14:26] and I I believe that we're living in the
[14:28] season of the fullness when God would
[14:30] give to the church I I could take the
[14:32] scripture and stand here for an hour and
[14:34] I'm going going to but I want you to
[14:35] realize that it's scripture in this
[14:38] where the Bible said that there's a
[14:39] season of favor that comes upon the
[14:42] church or there's a season where God met
[14:44] Abraham and he told him he said that
[14:47] according to the time of life amen I
[14:50] believe God chooses seasons and times to
[14:53] bring favor to bring blessing to bring
[14:55] anointing and God has chosen the last
[14:58] days I think it's powerful myself in the
[15:01] in the season of wickedness in the
[15:03] season of darkness in the season when
[15:05] the wicked are doing wickedly I don't
[15:07] think anybody could could argue that
[15:10] that Bible prophecy is true I don't
[15:13] think anybody would argue with me in
[15:15] Daniel 11 where it said the wicked shall
[15:17] do wickedly amen I don't think anybody
[15:19] would say that that's not true the
[15:21] wicked are doing wickedly and there's an
[15:23] atmosphere today that you can do any
[15:25] wicked thing that you want to without a
[15:28] resistance because the atmosphere of in
[15:30] the world is in an atmosphere of
[15:32] wickedness it's wicked everywhere just
[15:35] like the Bible said in John in the Book
[15:37] of Luke that it would be as the days of
[15:39] Noah even when the imagination of man is
[15:42] upon evil but now they're not just
[15:44] imagining it they're doing it it's
[15:46] wicked is doing Wicked but but how is it
[15:49] that we can give that power to the devil
[15:51] and restrain That Power from God why is
[15:54] it that witch doctors are the only one
[15:56] that can have power why is it that
[15:58] psychics is the only one that can see
[15:59] the future why is that the world readily
[16:02] accepts psychics and witch doctors and
[16:04] Witchcraft and they say that it's real
[16:06] but when you talk about the power of God
[16:08] coming into a surrendered vessel some
[16:11] reason they look at that as something
[16:13] that is wrong but the same as the Bible
[16:15] said the wicked shall do wickedly it
[16:18] said the Saints of the righteous shall
[16:20] do exploits in the power of God if a man
[16:24] can fall under a demonic attack and and
[16:27] some become so possessed that he could
[16:29] have 10 times the natural strength of a
[16:32] human being what would happen if a man
[16:34] or a woman who is a Christian that's
[16:37] Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ if
[16:39] they would surrender their being to the
[16:42] invisible God by the power of the Holy
[16:44] Ghost anything is possible to that
[16:47] believer because they have surrendered
[16:50] their lives to Jesus Christ I tell you
[16:52] it's Amen there's amen there's no amount
[16:54] of wickedness no shortness of wickedness
[16:57] in this age amen but in the samee
[16:59] generation of time I believe we are to
[17:01] create an atmosphere in the Church of
[17:04] God that anything could
[17:06] happen are you the atmosphere of the
[17:08] world's there isn't it Anything Could
[17:10] Happen amen young people walk into
[17:12] school and shoot it's such an atmosphere
[17:14] a little kid can decide they're a a boy
[17:16] if they're a girl and dress like a boy
[17:18] and act like a boy and the whole world
[17:20] plays along with them am mean you can
[17:21] take a grown man put a skirt on and and
[17:24] take long hair and act like a a well
[17:27] it's the truth anyhow amen and the whole
[17:29] world plays along bunch of psychos
[17:31] trying to act like people's this and
[17:33] that and something else and it's an
[17:35] atmosphere where anybody can do it and
[17:37] it goes just fine but but when you try
[17:40] to create an atmosphere that the spirit
[17:43] of God can freely move in somebody
[17:45] thinks something's wrong with that but
[17:47] I'm one that believes that we ought to
[17:49] have an atmosphere of Miracles we ought
[17:51] to have an atmosphere of the baptism of
[17:54] the Holy Ghost there ought to be a sumon
[17:56] amen and a shouting to the word of God
[17:58] there ought to be a feeling in the power
[18:01] of the spirit of God why could people
[18:03] feel evil they can feel wickedness they
[18:05] can feel jealousy they can feel malice
[18:07] they can feel any feeling if it's a
[18:09] wicked feeling but when it comes to
[18:11] feeling the spirit of God something's
[18:14] supposed to be wrong with that but I
[18:16] believe that we ought to feel the power
[18:19] of the anointing of almighty God run
[18:22] through our bodies we are to feel the
[18:24] anointing of life and Truth amen I think
[18:28] I think God to energize the church amen
[18:31] I I don't think anybody has a problem I
[18:34] sometimes the the theologians have so
[18:36] messed up the godhead that they took
[18:38] something very simple made it very
[18:40] complex that people don't understand how
[18:42] many gods there are in heaven amen I
[18:46] it's funny to me if you see a person
[18:48] doing something maybe one man murders
[18:50] another man rapes another person does
[18:52] something else whatever they do
[18:54] everybody will go well that's the devil
[18:56] but when you see the Holy Spirit doing
[18:58] things people wonder which God that is
[19:01] amen but I I'm one that believes that
[19:03] just one devil isn't he nobody has no
[19:04] trouble with that well I don't think it
[19:06] thinks takes three Gods to beat up one
[19:11] devil I think they just one God we can
[19:13] get it real simple can't we it's just
[19:14] one God so what is that that heals it's
[19:17] God what is that that moves in the
[19:19] church by manifestations and power it's
[19:22] God Amen it's not a different God it is
[19:24] the god it's the god that David served
[19:27] when David destroyed Goliath because he
[19:29] knew the god that could do that is that
[19:31] right he had that kind of strength
[19:33] because he had been introduced to that
[19:35] kind of God he didn't learn that from
[19:37] Saul he didn't learn that from the
[19:38] armies but he had had an encounter with
[19:41] the Holy Ghost back there as a shepherd
[19:43] and when he had that encounter he found
[19:45] out he was serving a God that could slay
[19:47] a lion he was serving a God that could
[19:50] kill a bear he knew he could do it
[19:52] because he knew that God he was serving
[19:54] so when he became in a challenge in the
[19:57] Goliath's challenge when he met that
[20:00] challenge he had already had an
[20:01] encounter with God he knew his God so he
[20:03] went into action knowing that this
[20:06] Giant's going to fall amen and I believe
[20:08] today that that kind of man David said
[20:11] the Lord is the strength of my life and
[20:13] that's the that's the strength that I
[20:15] want blessed is the man whose strength
[20:17] is in thee amen if if a man's strength
[20:20] is in the Lord he can walk from strength
[20:22] to strength from increasing power to
[20:25] increasing power David was speaking of
[20:27] course but we can we can give you
[20:29] biblical answers here in the book of
[20:31] numbers of course Caleb himself was 85
[20:34] years old when he took the mountain that
[20:37] Moses had promised amen uh uh one of the
[20:40] great Patriarchs of our faith Abraham
[20:42] was a hundred years old when he had his
[20:44] child with Sarah who was unable to have
[20:46] a child he was strong in faith being not
[20:50] weak but his strength came from elhad
[20:53] the all breasted almighty God who had
[20:55] met him that's where his strength was
[20:57] coming from was an encounter with God a
[21:00] a a a a a an experience with God gave
[21:04] Abraham the encounter he needed to get
[21:07] strength to believe my body's getting
[21:09] older but my promises are true amen and
[21:12] I I believe today that the the strength
[21:15] the the the contact the the grace that
[21:17] we need in our lives is to encounter the
[21:20] god that would tell us this word is
[21:22] true these promises are true now
[21:25] according to Revelations 10 a mighty
[21:27] Angel is the descend in the last days of
[21:30] course that's none other than Christ The
[21:32] Covenant Angel and they that wait upon
[21:35] him they will renew their strength they
[21:38] that have been waiting on the dissension
[21:40] of that angel will actually renew their
[21:43] strength and receive something that they
[21:44] would not faint according to Revelations
[21:47] 12 the Bible said amen that when this
[21:50] great uh this great uh battle could I
[21:52] put it like this this Angelic battle
[21:54] that began in the heavens when Michael
[21:56] and lucer was fighting amen went from an
[21:59] Angelic battle to a human battle is that
[22:02] right amen you can read in Revelations
[22:04] the 12th chapter you can see an Angelic
[22:06] battles becomes a human battle the Bible
[22:09] Begins by saying that Lucifer and
[22:11] Michael was fighting and then it then it
[22:13] comes over in the 11th verse and said
[22:15] they overcame him by the blood and the
[22:17] word amen who's they of course it's the
[22:20] people who were over there in Daniel the
[22:23] 11th chapter the people who know their
[22:25] God will be the people that overcome the
[22:27] Antichrist in the last days now an
[22:30] Angelic battle becomes a human battle
[22:33] but in that battle there must come a
[22:35] strength for a victory there's got to
[22:37] come a strength for a victory in the
[22:40] church or in individuals something has
[22:42] to give the people an overcoming power
[22:45] amen you got to you got to have
[22:47] something to give you an overcoming
[22:48] power you've got to actually face the
[22:51] battle knowing who's going to win this
[22:53] battle we we're not going to sit here
[22:55] and wait till it's over to find out
[22:56] who's a winner amen but David himself
[22:59] told Goliath amen what he was going to
[23:02] do to him before the battle he asked
[23:04] Saul what's my reward before he ever
[23:07] fought the Battle he knew he was the
[23:09] anointed he knew the God he was serving
[23:12] he knew the battle was won before he
[23:14] ever went into the battle and that's why
[23:16] he overcame because the strength that he
[23:19] overcame by come from the knowledge of
[23:22] the God he served and I believe if
[23:24] anybody's going to overcome this wicked
[23:26] lead toan age the going to have to
[23:29] receive strength from God and a
[23:31] knowledge of what the devil is and what
[23:34] God is so they can overcome that Wicked
[23:36] one can I can I say this amen I I
[23:39] believe now is come strength now is come
[23:43] salvation I believe the strength for the
[23:45] church is here amen I I believe the
[23:48] overcoming strength the 11th verse says
[23:51] they overcame him by the blood of the
[23:53] lamb and the word of their testimony in
[23:56] Daniel chapter 11 one of the one of the
[23:58] of the translations to Daniel 11:32 one
[24:01] of the translations powerful translation
[24:03] it says it like this with flatly he will
[24:05] corrupt those who violated the Covenant
[24:08] but the people who know their God will
[24:10] firmly resist so the word exploit can
[24:14] also be translated as the word firmly
[24:17] resist the people that know God will
[24:20] firmly resist the devil isn't that
[24:23] something you got to know who you're
[24:25] resisting
[24:26] though now there's a famous football
[24:28] game years ago y'all remember amen that
[24:31] I think it was even a Super Bowl wasn't
[24:32] it when one of the guy caught the
[24:33] football and and he made the best run of
[24:36] his life but he was running the wrong
[24:39] direction and the crowd was roaring for
[24:41] him but it was the wrong crowd and he
[24:44] was knocking off tackles but it was his
[24:46] own men cuz they were trying to stop him
[24:49] from running he was running the ball for
[24:51] the enemy but he just didn't know he
[24:53] didn't know what he was doing he was
[24:55] fighting hard running hard breaking
[24:57] tackles getting chairs but he was going
[24:59] the wrong way because he wasn't aware he
[25:02] he didn't know had he knew he wouldn't
[25:05] have did it you see that they wouldn't
[25:07] have crucified the Lord had they knew
[25:09] their God they wouldn't have did it you
[25:11] see today people crucify God and don't
[25:14] even know they're doing it they're
[25:16] working against God don't know they're
[25:17] doing it you said preacher I need an
[25:19] example Apostle Paul did it he he
[25:22] thought he was doing something for the
[25:24] Lord and was working against the very
[25:26] thing that he was Desiring to do because
[25:28] CU he didn't know but the moment he met
[25:30] that Pillar of Fire remember what
[25:32] happened he said Lord who are you he
[25:35] said I am Jesus and when he knew is God
[25:39] look what happened Paul became the
[25:41] Gentile to the Church of the of the
[25:44] Apostle to the Church of the Gentiles my
[25:46] because he knew is God look at the
[25:49] strength and look at what Paul did and I
[25:51] believe in the last day that there is a
[25:53] people who can firmly resist the devil
[25:56] because God will make known who is God
[25:59] and who is the devil in the last days
[26:01] you can find it in Bible prophecy in 2
[26:04] Thessalonians the Bible said that he
[26:05] will reveal the Antichrist in his time
[26:08] amen that's under the first seal isn't
[26:10] it when the first seal is revealed
[26:12] that's the time of the when the
[26:13] Antichrist is reveal the word so so
[26:16] sometimes the defeating of your enemy is
[26:19] not in God uh doing something special
[26:21] but just making known something to you
[26:24] truly overcoming the devil is
[26:26] recognizing the devil in his in his
[26:30] trick and then overcoming him by knowing
[26:33] that greater is he that is in you than
[26:36] he that is in the
[26:38] world if you can really see that then
[26:40] you would know that God becomes in this
[26:43] last day fully manifested I believe when
[26:46] God becomes fully manifested amen that
[26:49] the vessel he manifest is in begins to
[26:52] be decreased but then God becomes
[26:56] increased if God could be made known
[26:59] then the individual himself is not the
[27:02] one you follow it's what's been made
[27:05] known now the prophet tells us something
[27:08] powerful I thought I thought it's
[27:09] powerful he told us that today amen just
[27:12] as John in the Bible introduced Jesus
[27:16] Christ and he said now I must
[27:18] decrease and he's going to increase for
[27:20] I was a light for season but now this is
[27:23] the light this is the true light and
[27:26] when he when he made this introduction
[27:27] he said I must decrease and he is going
[27:30] to increase brother BR says we're told
[27:33] that this will repeated again in the
[27:34] last day to introduce the Messiah to the
[27:39] people now and why it had to be
[27:41] Shepherds I think it's a powerful sermon
[27:44] that whenever the angels went to the
[27:45] Shepherds and they told them about Jesus
[27:49] being on the earth can you imagine the
[27:52] Shepherds receiving this kind of message
[27:55] that Jesus was on the Earth that the
[27:58] Messiah had been born now that kind of
[28:01] message went to a certain kind of people
[28:04] those angels went to those Shepherds
[28:06] because they were common people and they
[28:09] could receive a word from the Lord that
[28:12] didn't have to come through the theology
[28:14] or through their ideas but these were
[28:17] simple men who could just receive the
[28:19] word of God that God bypassed the
[28:22] schools God bypassed everything to bring
[28:25] this message to Common herdsman the
[28:28] greatest message of all times he says
[28:30] see we think of Noah's day and the
[28:32] prophets and the great priest and had
[28:33] been in the days G gu the learn Men
[28:36] Kings pones Martin
[28:38] anarchs but when he comes with the
[28:40] greatest message the message was the
[28:43] greatest message it ever give to the
[28:45] Earth was the Messiah is here now see he
[28:49] came to make that known but he bypassed
[28:52] the train to come to the humble to make
[28:54] them know the Messiah is here now can
[28:57] you imagine the greatest message that
[29:00] has ever been preached is the Messiah is
[29:02] here amen I'm thinking today of the
[29:05] message that we are preaching on the
[29:07] Earth today I believe we ought to be
[29:09] preaching the same message the Messiah
[29:12] is here now iist said well preacher how
[29:15] do you say that John 14 said in that day
[29:17] you shall know that I am in the father
[29:20] that you are in me and I in you didn't
[29:22] he say it yet a little while and the
[29:24] world see me no more but you shall see
[29:26] me for I will be with you even in You
[29:29] Until the End of the Age amen then we
[29:32] believe today that the Messiah is the
[29:35] promised word of God for the age that
[29:37] we're living in and that Messiah is not
[29:40] a man the Messiah is the Holy Ghost amen
[29:44] isn't it powerful when you realize that
[29:46] the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ he said I
[29:50] will go away but I will come again unto
[29:52] you the Messiah then is not a man he
[29:55] said brother ma said I'm your brother
[29:57] the Holy Ghost is here and that's the
[30:00] Messiah we have seen the sign of the
[30:02] Messiah now think of this a messiah in
[30:05] human flesh a super sign the Holy Ghost
[30:08] the Holy Ghost resurrected Messiah
[30:10] living among his people amen I believe
[30:13] this I believe a supernatural God in a
[30:16] supernatural body is in a natural
[30:19] people when God moved into the Holy
[30:22] Ghost he could move into the church amen
[30:25] I think it's powerful a natural people
[30:27] can receive a supernatural God in a
[30:30] supernatural body The Immortal Jesus
[30:33] Christ enters a pillar of fire and by
[30:36] that Holy Ghost Fire enters into the
[30:38] church amen he's able to do it that
[30:40] Supernatural God is in a supernatural
[30:42] people now those people will know their
[30:45] God and they will do exploits they will
[30:48] show Supernatural signs to the
[30:51] people in Daniel CH 12 the wise shall
[30:55] understand their
[30:56] God uh let let me let me just go here to
[30:59] Revelation book of symbols when the time
[31:02] is at hand is when this book's going to
[31:05] be
[31:06] revealed now God is going to send
[31:09] something to make known the time that we
[31:12] live
[31:13] in is that right in Daniel the 11th
[31:18] chapter the Bible
[31:20] says amen that he will make known and
[31:23] they shall be strong and they shall do
[31:26] great exploits now can we move into this
[31:28] word exploits for a little
[31:30] bit the word exploit means a bold or
[31:35] daring
[31:38] feet the people who know their God shall
[31:40] be
[31:41] strong and do some daring
[31:46] Feats how many knows of God this
[31:49] morning come on
[31:52] Gideon come on theyve going to do some
[31:55] daring feats
[31:58] they're going to have some daring Deeds
[31:59] the word feat actually means an
[32:02] achievement that requires Great courage
[32:05] skill or
[32:07] strength amen great feats an achievement
[32:10] or an
[32:11] accomplishment a coup or a master stroke
[32:15] the people that know their God is able
[32:17] to do a feat they're able to they're
[32:19] able to overcome the enemy they're over
[32:22] to withstand or resist the devil I I
[32:25] like this one this is another one a deed
[32:27] amen it it it literally they'll be able
[32:30] to do a deed a deed for God Amen in
[32:33] other words a deed something similar
[32:35] would be an action or an activity an
[32:37] exploit a performance or an achievement
[32:40] I give you one more definition amen an
[32:43] exploit means an act those that know
[32:46] their God shall be strong and they shall
[32:49] act theater biblically Parliament law
[32:53] University what is it it's a display
[32:56] here's one of the uh the translations
[32:58] they that know their God will display
[32:59] strength and take
[33:02] action will'll display strength and take
[33:05] action I think it's time for the church
[33:08] to take
[33:09] action amen I believe the people that
[33:12] know their God should know this is the
[33:14] hour of their action I believe it would
[33:16] be the time amen that that would be able
[33:19] that the church should go into action
[33:21] now now you can have churches but I mean
[33:24] an original church I don't mean just the
[33:26] church here in bluon Ohio or just
[33:28] another church but the Church of the
[33:30] Living God Amen should be a church that
[33:33] is universal is that right it should be
[33:36] a universal church it's the body of
[33:38] Christ how do you get into that body by
[33:41] one Spirit now we're not talking about a
[33:43] presbyterian or Baptist or some
[33:45] denomination but we're talking about the
[33:47] Church of the Living God the people of
[33:50] God the church the first born of God do
[33:53] you see that if if if God would grow a
[33:55] tree ever have you ever seen a grafted
[33:57] tree
[33:59] amen you can graft a limb into a tree
[34:01] and that don't mean you're going to get
[34:02] the fruit off of that limb and that's
[34:04] the reason you graft maybe you graft a
[34:06] lemon into an orange tree and and that
[34:08] limb will always produce lemons because
[34:10] it's a lemon limb on an orange tree but
[34:13] if an orange tree produces a branch then
[34:16] you're going to get oranges off of that
[34:17] tree and not lemons and if God ever
[34:20] raises up a church a book of Acts church
[34:25] that will be another book of Acts
[34:27] written by behind that church I believe
[34:29] the True Church of the Living God the
[34:31] people of God is a continuation of the
[34:35] book of Acts amen according to John
[34:37] chapter 15 he said I am the vine and you
[34:40] are the branches and if there is a
[34:42] people that God can move through with
[34:44] his strength and unction those people
[34:47] those people will have another book of
[34:49] Acts written behind it amen I believe
[34:51] these people will live in a certain time
[34:53] I believe they're living in the end time
[34:55] when brother bam ties it together he
[34:57] said these people that lives in this day
[35:00] he said they will live in the day the
[35:02] stone hits the image in the feet the
[35:04] people that do know their their God
[35:06] prophecy after prophecy and seminaries
[35:09] of the world can't take it out God's
[35:11] going to do it anyhow and the people's
[35:14] going to follow it what is it it's God
[35:16] giving an action to the church I believe
[35:19] we've seen these things take place in
[35:21] this age that has given an action to the
[35:24] church Daniel said in the last days the
[35:26] people that do know their God they shall
[35:28] do exploits these scriptures must be
[35:31] fulfilled these scriptures are
[35:33] powerfully true they that know their God
[35:35] shall do exploits that is a promise to
[35:37] the church they will have strength God
[35:40] makes himself known they'll have
[35:41] strength and they will do action I I I
[35:44] love the scripture Jesus said it like
[35:46] this verily I say unto you he that
[35:48] believeth on me the works that I do
[35:50] shall he do also and greater work shall
[35:52] I do because I go unto the father in
[35:56] Mark 11 Jesus said to his disciples
[35:59] after them seeing him curse a fig tree
[36:02] he said to them if you would have faith
[36:04] in God if you would say unto this
[36:06] mountain to be moved it would be done
[36:09] according to what you have asked when a
[36:11] man has an experience with that kind of
[36:13] God he begins to believe that all things
[36:16] are possible to him the same as they're
[36:19] possible to God because you're an heir
[36:21] or a joint air with God Amen I I believe
[36:24] this I believe the things that we're
[36:26] seeing has never happened happened since
[36:28] the coming of the former reign in the
[36:30] first of the Apostles but in the last
[36:32] days now people the kind of church God
[36:35] is looking for I know some people think
[36:37] God's looking for a formal dignified
[36:40] church but I don't believe the first
[36:41] church was a formal dignified church I
[36:44] mean I believe the first church was at
[36:46] the beginning was filled with the spirit
[36:48] it healed the sick it prophesied it had
[36:50] signs and wonders it wasn't ashamed of
[36:52] their religion they shouted and danced
[36:55] under the spirit like drunk men they had
[36:57] clothing tongues of fire they' done
[36:59] signs and wonders exploits followed them
[37:02] that's the kind that was at the
[37:04] beginning that was the kind that's in
[37:06] the middle and that's the kind that's
[37:07] going to be in the end I believe we are
[37:10] that kind of church amen I'm not ashamed
[37:13] of being that kind of church I believe
[37:15] we ought to get an atmosphere with that
[37:17] kind of God that Paul worshiped can come
[37:19] into our church the kind of God that
[37:22] Peter amen let me ask you what kind of
[37:24] God have you been introduced to I
[37:26] believe that we have been introduced to
[37:28] a god that could speak the word of God
[37:30] and cripples could rise up and walk off
[37:33] we've been introduced to a God Amen that
[37:35] could raise the dead that could save The
[37:37] Sinner that could revive the entire
[37:39] world we have been introduced to a
[37:41] living God not a not a determinant or
[37:44] some Creed or some Dogma I don't know
[37:46] about you all but I'm a little sick of
[37:48] religion I'm a little sick of a bunch of
[37:50] people gathering around arguing about
[37:52] money and carpet colors and and who's
[37:55] going to run and what who's going to do
[37:56] I'm a little sick of the religion
[37:58] already a bunch of Hypocrites filling
[38:00] the pull pit amen doing everything they
[38:02] can do to get followings but what about
[38:04] a real genuine Holy Ghost anointing to
[38:08] come in the Church of the Living God
[38:10] with fire and power giving Revival and
[38:13] life until the Holy Ghost takes over
[38:16] every heart and every believer I think
[38:18] we ought to bring Jesus back in the
[38:20] church we ought to bring Jesus with
[38:22] power and with authority we are to take
[38:25] the handcuffs off of God take take the
[38:27] duct tape off of his mouth let God speak
[38:30] again let God act again let God have
[38:33] Miracles again you say how can Jesus do
[38:36] it well let me say this Jesus's Corporal
[38:38] bodies in heaven I think we all believe
[38:40] that that he's got to have another body
[38:42] on the earth and I believe that body is
[38:45] the body of Jesus Christ and if his
[38:48] spirit is in the body wouldn't it act
[38:51] just like he did when he was on the
[38:54] earth when he raised the dead oh my amen
[38:59] I believe it's this hour I believe it's
[39:00] it's an hour where God can perform and
[39:03] work through the church amen I realize
[39:07] that's the hour we're living in now I
[39:09] know I know people say to me say well
[39:11] brother Wayne why AR why aren we just
[39:12] seeing these things now why are we just
[39:14] seeing scripture now amen other men in
[39:16] other ages didn't teach things quite
[39:18] like this well let me tell you can you
[39:20] imagine living in the days of Jesus when
[39:22] Jesus had talked to his disciples he
[39:25] told them about the coming of the
[39:26] crucifixion he told him that he would
[39:28] raise in three days but right after his
[39:31] death on the third day in the moment
[39:33] that the resurrection was to be
[39:35] manifested he found two men walking on
[39:37] the road to EMAs and they were they were
[39:40] downhearted and discouraged and was
[39:42] having a corrupt communication among
[39:45] themselves and Jesus appeared and they
[39:47] didn't even know it was him amen why
[39:49] because God hid from their mind the
[39:53] things that Jesus had said about the
[39:55] resurrection until the moment was being
[39:58] Vindicated and the things concerning
[40:00] this word had been hid right in the
[40:03] Bible until the last days until we had
[40:06] need of it he let us become blind to the
[40:09] things that we see today for the hour we
[40:11] have need of it our fathers didn't know
[40:13] these things the Bible said they
[40:15] wouldn't know them he had them HIIT up
[40:17] but in the last days they would be
[40:19] revealed to the sons of God or they
[40:21] would be made manifested my when I think
[40:24] about this I think of the four knowledge
[40:26] of God when God releases his word when
[40:29] this message came when a prophet Came
[40:31] Upon the Earth and introduced Jesus
[40:33] Christ to this generation as more than a
[40:36] denomination or as more than just some
[40:38] kind of worked up something or some
[40:40] group of of certain men making rules he
[40:43] introduced God as a real God and when he
[40:46] did it there was some people in the mind
[40:48] of God that is wrote about in Daniel the
[40:51] 11th chapter amen that God for ordained
[40:54] them to see that when it happened God or
[40:57] ordained he put somebody on the earth to
[40:59] see the manifestations of God he
[41:01] ordained you to see it if he didn't
[41:04] ordain you you'll never see it but if he
[41:06] did you will see it this is the hour
[41:08] it's here I love how brother Bram says
[41:10] this and I've heard but now I see he
[41:12] said do you see what happened Moses went
[41:15] to the burning
[41:16] bush I think it's powerful Mar as Moses
[41:18] going to the burning bush how many knows
[41:20] Moses went there he's in pretty big
[41:22] trouble his weakness was evident by this
[41:25] time right but when he went to the Bur
[41:27] burning bush it gave Vindication to what
[41:30] Abraham had had promised to him see he
[41:34] received Vindication he saw in the
[41:36] burning bush the same God that Abraham
[41:40] had met and had encountered with and had
[41:42] prophesied and got strength from Moses
[41:44] met that same God as a burning bush
[41:47] because it was as a Vindicated word when
[41:49] job saw him job rose up in job 19 and
[41:53] said I know my redeemer liveth and
[41:56] though the skin worm would eat this body
[41:58] in my flesh shall I see God he
[42:01] prophesied of the Resurrection because
[42:03] he saw the resurrection and William
[42:05] brandom says this he said but see we
[42:08] seen him we see him the same as job saw
[42:12] him we seen him in resurrection power
[42:16] we've not seen him in the grave we
[42:18] didn't anoint him he laying in the Tomb
[42:21] we have seen him after his resurrection
[42:24] we see him this morning in Resurrection
[42:27] power the church amen they heard and
[42:29] read about him and the promises were
[42:31] made but now we see him with our eyes
[42:35] amen I think of this I think of of job
[42:37] and how he saw him people say well I'd
[42:39] like to see him like job up you could
[42:40] see him the same way this
[42:42] morning look at what brother random says
[42:45] it like this he said I know that's how
[42:46] job seen you I know that's how Abraham
[42:49] saw you I know that's how the rest of
[42:51] them saw you because it was your
[42:53] promised word being manifested that's
[42:56] right
[42:57] and I believe this morning we're looking
[42:59] at him with our own eyes amen I believe
[43:02] that I don't believe the third pull is
[43:03] just abstract from the church amen but I
[43:06] believe we are a manifestation of that
[43:08] third pull I don't believe that the
[43:10] Bible is one thing and the church is
[43:12] another I believe we're on manifestation
[43:15] of that Bible I believe when you read
[43:17] that there will be a people who know
[43:19] their God I'm literally looking at a
[43:21] people who will know their God it's not
[43:24] just in the Bible this morning it's
[43:26] living in individuals who are filled
[43:29] with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost Amen
[43:32] in the hour we're living in I tell you
[43:34] what if you would look at it as Bible
[43:36] prophecy if receiving the Holy Ghost you
[43:38] can see Joel chapter 2 said I shall pour
[43:41] out my spirit sayith the Lord and you
[43:43] could see the spirit poured out and you
[43:46] could say this is that that Joel
[43:48] prophesied it ought to do something to
[43:50] you because you're seeing God coming
[43:52] into action you ought to see it in Acts
[43:55] the 2 chapter when they were filled with
[43:57] the Holy Ghost if you could see that
[43:59] same thing take place it ought to do
[44:02] something to the church amen when God
[44:04] said he would heal the sick and these
[44:06] signs shall follow them that believe
[44:08] when you see that it should put you into
[44:10] action because it's God In Action when
[44:13] the people of God are in action amen no
[44:16] man can heal another man no man could
[44:19] save another man so it has to be God I
[44:22] believe it I believe it'll put you in
[44:24] action when you see the word of God
[44:25] fulfilled in your AG
[44:28] I believe it I believe that the pillar
[44:30] of fire met Paul and put him into action
[44:33] what did Paul do after that he went
[44:35] immediately and received the Holy Ghost
[44:37] and then went and preach the gospel it
[44:39] put him into action I believe that I
[44:41] believe if you see him in action it'll
[44:44] put you in action when you look at Jesus
[44:47] doing the word it ought to put you in
[44:49] action to believe that word could be
[44:51] fulfilled I think of the scripture in
[44:53] John chapter n a blind man that's what
[44:55] we were before we we met the Lord we
[44:57] were just blind we didn't know him but
[44:59] we knew we needed him and the Bible
[45:02] records a blind man meeting Jesus and
[45:05] and he goes to him amen and he's
[45:07] Desiring a healing but it's a powerful
[45:10] thing to see that Jesus met him at a
[45:12] certain place he met him at a certain
[45:15] time amen there was a reason that man
[45:18] was blind until that time somebody said
[45:21] well hey man the man was a sinner is his
[45:23] parents was a sinner and Jesus said no
[45:25] it's not true there's nobody s this was
[45:27] done for the glory of God Amen that his
[45:30] eyes might be open to give Glory unto
[45:32] God now look at what happened I I think
[45:34] it's powerful when you read it and you
[45:36] see that that Jesus met this blind man
[45:39] brother Steven met him at a certain
[45:40] place so there was an ordained meeting
[45:43] ground for Jesus and this blind man and
[45:46] when he met this man Jesus actually spit
[45:50] on the ground and took a certain portion
[45:52] of the Earth mud and put it in that
[45:55] Man's eyes well I'm one of them that
[45:57] believes that Jesus was the creator of
[45:59] this heavens and earth I believe he
[46:01] created the heavens and the earth I
[46:03] don't think that he was just another one
[46:05] I think he was the creator of it how
[46:07] many knows when God created the Earth he
[46:09] laid your bodies out in the dust amen he
[46:12] laid them out in the Garden of Eden
[46:14] that's why Adam was laying there as a
[46:16] tree in the ground until the life came
[46:18] into him and he came out of the ground
[46:20] so your body was in this dust the
[46:23] Creator laid you out in this dust he
[46:25] knew where you'd be born born white
[46:27] Place amen think about this blind man
[46:30] his body part of his body the eye was
[46:32] laying in that dirt until the Messiah
[46:35] met him in the right place at the right
[46:37] time and he took the dirt and put in his
[46:40] eye and gave him the substance that he
[46:43] needed to put the man into action for
[46:46] the Messiah in his age look when he
[46:49] received his side he ran into the City
[46:52] and they begin to question what happened
[46:53] to this man what took place to this man
[46:56] the Great leader said what happened he
[46:58] was a blind man unimportant to this
[47:01] moment but with his eyes open exploits
[47:04] had took place in his life and now he
[47:06] was under question what happened to you
[47:08] what doctor did you see how did this
[47:10] happen what took place amen and and and
[47:13] this man said Jesus healed me that's
[47:16] what happened to me Jesus healed me amen
[47:19] and they said well who is he he said you
[47:21] mean to tell me amen that you being the
[47:23] leaders of this of this religion and man
[47:27] healed me who was blind from his
[47:29] mother's womb and you don't know who he
[47:33] is and you don't you know your books and
[47:35] you know your things but you don't know
[47:38] him or you would know that no man could
[47:40] heal the blind save almighty God Amen
[47:44] his own parents was asking him they
[47:46] asked his parents what about it amen his
[47:48] parents wouldn't even take up for him
[47:49] brother Seth they said well ask the boy
[47:51] he's a full age I tell you ask him he
[47:53] can tell you he said well this is what
[47:55] I'm going to tell you amen I I believe
[47:57] it don't you I believe it speaks of a
[47:59] lot of things I believe adoption time
[48:01] comes amen amen I believe it I believe
[48:03] mature age you speak for yourself and
[48:06] they asked him what happened he said
[48:07] well I'll tell you this I was once blind
[48:10] and now I see and I didn't get it in
[48:13] your in your in your in your Creeds and
[48:16] I didn't get it through your
[48:17] organizations but I met this one who was
[48:20] rejected among you and he gave me his
[48:22] sight amen I tell you something this
[48:25] morning I have received spiritual sight
[48:28] from the almighty God and I know where
[48:31] it came from it came from the
[48:35] Messiah he hath anointed him to preach
[48:38] the gospel to Open the Eyes of the Blind
[48:40] and when the eyes of this man come open
[48:42] he went into action I believe if your
[48:45] eyes would come open to what you're in
[48:47] the presence of this morning I believe
[48:49] you'd go into action I believe if you
[48:51] could believe the Bible where it said
[48:53] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[48:55] name I will be there in the midst of
[48:57] them listen to me if you can open your
[48:59] spiritual eyes Jesus Christ the son of
[49:02] God is in this building this morning in
[49:05] power and manifestation I'm not a crazy
[49:08] man I'm a Biblical man I believe the
[49:11] Bible wherever two or three are gathered
[49:13] I'll be there a little while the world
[49:15] see me no more but you'll see me I'll be
[49:17] with you even in You Until the End of
[49:19] the Age either the Bible is true or it's
[49:21] not but if it's the truth you're in the
[49:25] presence of the Messiah Jesus Christ and
[49:28] he has never changed Hebrews 13 and8
[49:32] said I am the same yesterday today and
[49:34] forever and what he did in one day he'll
[49:37] do it again or he isn't God if he saved
[49:41] a man he still saves if he healed he
[49:43] still
[49:46] heals I know people don't want to hear
[49:48] about a Healer today they think it's
[49:49] fanaticism but listen when Jesus was on
[49:52] Earth the first time they said he could
[49:54] heal but not save remember that they
[49:56] said he was a Healer and not a savior
[49:58] now they're trying to say he's a savior
[50:00] and not a Healer but I testify that the
[50:03] atoning blood of Jesus Christ is the
[50:05] atonement for my salvation it's the
[50:08] atonement for my healing and one of
[50:10] these mornings I'm not just going to get
[50:12] a healing of a cold or a cancer but my
[50:16] entire body will be healed in a change
[50:19] at the moment of the twick of an eye I
[50:22] believe in Rapture I believe in an
[50:24] atmosphere and anointing of the change
[50:26] of the
[50:27] body not just a historical God sure as
[50:31] long as he's in history everybody
[50:32] worships him but what about a God today
[50:35] what about Jesus Christ here today what
[50:37] if what if you would have been in
[50:38] Jerusalem when he come riding off of the
[50:40] hill on a white mule and everybody
[50:42] fanatically hollering and praising where
[50:45] would you have been sitting would you
[50:46] have been saying hosan hosan to the king
[50:50] or would you have been saying you got to
[50:51] quieten these people down amen we got to
[50:53] do something with these people Lord what
[50:55] are you going to do with them
[50:57] what are you going to do with them they
[50:58] saw Zachariah 9 riding in front of them
[51:02] they saw the Messiah in the presence and
[51:06] I say today we see in Acts chapter 2
[51:09] right here in the Church of the Living
[51:11] God we see Joel chapter 2 right here in
[51:14] the Church of the Living God what are
[51:15] you going to do with the people when
[51:17] they see Bible prophecies come off of
[51:19] the page and enter into life woo brother
[51:25] gory worship him in another age but what
[51:27] about
[51:30] today people don't want it they don't
[51:32] want the embarrassment of it they don't
[51:33] want to be identified with this kind of
[51:34] God I want to be identified with him I
[51:37] want to be identified in his
[51:39] resurrection I want to feel his
[51:41] resurrection power I want to feel his
[51:43] resurrection and anointing this man got
[51:45] his eyes open and he went into action
[51:47] you can say well the brother Wayne
[51:48] that's back in the Bible what about in
[51:50] our season there was a man named John
[51:52] Ryan entered one of brother Ram's
[51:54] meetings he was a blind man he was a
[51:55] Catholic blind man sit in the middle of
[51:57] the meetings under discernment he saw
[51:59] the power of God come up in the prayer
[52:01] line he said I want my eyes to be open
[52:03] if Jesus is the same I want to receive
[52:05] healing and brother brandham looked into
[52:07] his life and told him who he was and
[52:09] where he was from and what he done for a
[52:11] living and he said thus sayth the Lord
[52:13] John you're going to be healed you're
[52:14] going to be healed of that blindness he
[52:16] walked back to his seat and sat down a
[52:18] little while he got back up and come
[52:20] back in the prayer line he said to
[52:22] brother brandham he said brother
[52:23] brandham he said he Saidi thought you
[52:25] said I was healed' he said brother John
[52:28] I thought you said you believ
[52:30] me he said but brother random I can't
[52:33] see he said John healing has nothing to
[52:36] do with that he said the healing is here
[52:39] he said all you got to do now is go and
[52:42] confess that word until that healing is
[52:45] manifested now that's not crazy that's
[52:47] the Bible Hebrews the third chapter amen
[52:49] the high priest of our confession hold
[52:51] fast by faith our confession remember
[52:54] that and John needed something to say he
[52:57] needed something to go into action with
[52:59] because he didn't know God like that but
[53:02] something gave him strength that Prophet
[53:04] said to him you I see you sin just go
[53:07] confess your sin that's all you got to
[53:09] do and John be to confess that for two
[53:12] solid
[53:15] weeks praise the Lord I'm Healed blind
[53:17] is about praise the Lord I'm healed amen
[53:20] what was it he had been given strength
[53:23] through a word that he couldn't
[53:26] understand but he believed it and
[53:28] because he took the word he received a
[53:31] healing in his eyes I don't understand
[53:33] everything that I know but I know
[53:35] there's a God I know he's the god of his
[53:38] word amen and if you can get past the
[53:40] Giants there's some honey and milk in
[53:42] this
[53:45] story hallu sure enough John two weeks
[53:49] later sitting in a barber chair and they
[53:50] was laughing at him heard you got a heal
[53:52] the other day he said that's right I did
[53:55] sitting there blinding his b that's
[53:56] that's right I did and about that time
[53:58] his eyes come open he jumped up from
[54:00] where he was sitting run down the run
[54:02] down the street praise God I'm healed
[54:05] amen praise God I'm Healed I tell you
[54:07] amen I want to say this morning thank
[54:08] God I'm
[54:12] saved amen you remember when you first
[54:14] got saved the Temptation didn't go away
[54:16] did it you was tempted after you started
[54:19] confessing your salvation even years
[54:21] later still tempted but you never give
[54:23] up your confession of Salvation amen do
[54:26] you you know that healing works the same
[54:28] exact way you do not have to lose your
[54:30] pain the same day you're healed but if
[54:33] you'll hold on to
[54:37] it somebody said well brother way if if
[54:40] God is this real and you guys believe us
[54:42] go down and empty the go out and empty
[54:44] the hospitals out well that's a good
[54:45] that's a good thought but it's just not
[54:47] biblical Jesus went to the pool of
[54:49] Bethesda Heen heal one man among the the
[54:54] multitude now now think about this you
[54:57] said well then then then why wouldn't
[54:59] God heal everybody in the hospital well
[55:00] let me ask you this go down to the barro
[55:02] this morning and preach the gospel and
[55:04] save everybody in that
[55:06] building you said well I can't do that
[55:08] and neither can you go to the hospital
[55:10] and heal every sick person but to them
[55:12] that were healing is ordained to that
[55:15] place where faith will find its resting
[55:16] place there's a healing there not every
[55:19] person is healed but Jesus Is A Healer
[55:22] not every person is saved but Jesus is a
[55:24] savior come on now every person you ever
[55:27] testified was was delivered but I have
[55:30] never quit preaching a delivering Jesus
[55:33] because somebody wasn't delivered it has
[55:36] nothing to do with the power of God Amen
[55:38] if you have faith all things are
[55:41] possible to them that believe he is a
[55:44] delivering God this morning he's a
[55:46] saving
[55:50] God I'm from Jonesboro Arkansas just
[55:52] about 30 miles from there hey man I I I
[55:55] was my my wife wife's grandmother was

[58:34] don't want you to get offended at me but
[58:35] this is the truth he when he began to
[58:37] pray for her you know you know what his
[58:38] prayer was he said Lord right here is a
[58:41] granddaughter to the man that helped you
[58:43] up calvary's
[58:45] hill he said this is one of the
[58:47] granddaughters of the man that helped
[58:48] you pick up your cross when you were
[58:50] going up calvary's hill and she's here
[58:53] blinded tonight would you just open her
[58:55] side in memory of that man and her eyes
[58:59] come open brother B said amen when her
[59:02] eyes come open he said that's the last
[59:04] time I saw her he said she was running
[59:06] out through the parking lot thank God
[59:08] I'm Healed thank God I'm Healed I was
[59:11] blind and now I can see listen to me
[59:14] this morning I think it's time for the
[59:16] church to go into action I was blind but
[59:19] this morning I can see I was lost but
[59:22] I've been saved what happened to you his
[59:25] name is
[59:29] Jesus brother yeah I don't know what
[59:33] about the book of Isaiah what about it
[59:35] when Isaiah went into an encounter with
[59:37] the great Angel amen when he seen the
[59:39] presence of the Lord he covered his face
[59:42] he watched he watched Isaiah watched an
[59:45] Angel cover his face with two Wings
[59:48] cover his feet with two wings and then
[59:50] he flew with two wings that angel had
[59:53] six wings brother Ram says it like this
[59:55] he said that angel has been in the
[59:58] presence of God for the time of creation
[1:00:01] till that day of Isaiah if anybody knew
[1:00:04] how to enter the presence of God that
[1:00:07] angel knew how he said and he was
[1:00:09] showing the servant Isaiah how to come
[1:00:13] into the presence of God he said with
[1:00:15] two hand two two Wings he covers his
[1:00:17] face in in reverence and with two Wings
[1:00:22] he covered his feet with humility he
[1:00:25] said but the third set of wings put him
[1:00:28] in action and because Isaiah was humble
[1:00:32] and reverent before the presence of God
[1:00:35] his actions was the actions of God oh
[1:00:38] listen I believe this morning that if we
[1:00:40] were to reverence oursel to the Holy
[1:00:42] Spirit H humble oursel to the word of
[1:00:44] God then the action in the church now
[1:00:47] watch some people come in contact with
[1:00:49] God and they think that means let's go
[1:00:50] build a denomination let's go make an
[1:00:52] organization let's Feed the World Let's
[1:00:54] do let's build some hospitals those are
[1:00:56] tremendous things those are humanitarian
[1:00:58] things but that was not the commission
[1:01:01] of the Bible the Bible said that we
[1:01:03] should go into the world and preach the
[1:01:05] Gospel of Jesus Christ we should baptize
[1:01:08] them that believe the gospel amen and to
[1:01:11] them that believe should be filled with
[1:01:13] the holy ghost power and these signs
[1:01:16] shall follow them that believe they
[1:01:18] should go into the action of God I
[1:01:20] believe I believe it myself I believe it
[1:01:23] I believe this is the hour for action
[1:01:26] I believe it's the season for Action I
[1:01:28] believe this is the time for it can can
[1:01:30] I say this I believe we're close enough
[1:01:32] to home as our brother said I believe
[1:01:35] the immortal Waters of almighty God wave
[1:01:39] after wave are crashing into mortal
[1:01:42] Realms and they're washing up in the
[1:01:44] banks of mortality and we are here
[1:01:47] waiting in the immortal Waters by the
[1:01:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost we are feeling
[1:01:53] the Life coming from another place we're
[1:01:55] enjoying the presence of God and I
[1:01:58] believe it's an hour if there ever was
[1:02:00] an hour to do something for the Lord I
[1:02:01] believe it's right now amen now I I
[1:02:04] think sometimes you hear things that you
[1:02:06] know but I believe Paul Peter said it
[1:02:08] like this we ought to to stir you up by
[1:02:11] putting you in
[1:02:13] remembrance to stare you up going in the
[1:02:16] Greek the word stare means to render
[1:02:18] into action we ought to put you into
[1:02:20] action by the things that you know it
[1:02:23] ought to it ought to make you go into
[1:02:25] action you you've read about him you've
[1:02:27] heard about him but when you get in that
[1:02:29] Spirit it ought to make you go into
[1:02:30] action you ought to be activated by it
[1:02:33] let mean let me give you an example of a
[1:02:34] woman in the Bible who was an illame
[1:02:37] woman and she came by the house of Simon
[1:02:39] one day and while Simon was had invited
[1:02:42] Jesus he was there but he wasn't
[1:02:45] entertained Jesus wasn't entertained he
[1:02:48] was only
[1:02:49] invited but there was a little woman
[1:02:51] come walking by and saw him sitting
[1:02:54] there unentertained remember remember
[1:02:56] the story in the Bible amen she ran to
[1:02:58] the house amen got everything she had
[1:03:01] MoneyWise and went down and bought some
[1:03:03] Alabaster oil and she come back to
[1:03:07] anoint the feet of Jesus to wash his
[1:03:09] feet now remember the story it's a
[1:03:11] powerful story but what made that woman
[1:03:14] think she could do that what made her do
[1:03:16] that what made her get into that amen I
[1:03:20] I believe that there was another little
[1:03:22] Harlot that she must have had some
[1:03:23] friendship with brother random said that
[1:03:26] they knew one another and there was a
[1:03:28] woman in the Bible who had been caught
[1:03:31] in adultery y'all remember the story
[1:03:33] she' been caught in adultery with a man
[1:03:34] and the Pharisees caught her and they
[1:03:36] drugg the man and the woman down to
[1:03:38] Jesus and threw the woman at the feet of
[1:03:41] Jesus and they quoted the word to him
[1:03:43] and they said the Bible the Moses law
[1:03:45] said that she should be stoned for
[1:03:47] adultery through threw right at the feet
[1:03:48] of Jesus and while she was there they
[1:03:51] said this is what the word says but what
[1:03:53] do you say
[1:03:55] I'll never will forget the first time I
[1:03:57] read that where Jesus knelt down and he
[1:04:01] never answered them he just knelt down
[1:04:02] and started writing in the
[1:04:04] sand I thought the god that knows
[1:04:06] everything I wonder what he wrote about
[1:04:08] the Pharisee and the
[1:04:10] sand cuz he looked up and said you that
[1:04:12] don't have any
[1:04:14] sin cast the first stone and remember
[1:04:18] what happens when they looked up the
[1:04:21] accusers were
[1:04:23] gone the accusers were were left and
[1:04:26] then it was just her and him and he said
[1:04:29] neither do I condemn you amen and he
[1:04:32] didn't write nothing else down amen I
[1:04:34] tell you you talking about that Lamb's
[1:04:35] Book amen there wasn't nothing else
[1:04:37] written down amen amen he just scratched
[1:04:39] it out because there was nothing written
[1:04:41] about her in him she was for ordained
[1:04:45] before the world began and at the feet
[1:04:47] of Jesus Amen we're judgment was
[1:04:50] supposed to happen Deliverance took
[1:04:52] place where judgment was supposed to be
[1:04:56] there she left a sinless woman she came
[1:04:59] she came in adulterous and she left a
[1:05:02] clean woman because Jesus didn't condemn
[1:05:05] her either now I guarantee you that girl
[1:05:08] went into action I guarantee she told
[1:05:11] every one of the harlots down there at
[1:05:13] the whale what had happened to her at
[1:05:15] the feet of Jesus Christ and that little
[1:05:17] girl amen that had the alabaster had
[1:05:20] been very much in knowah the story of
[1:05:23] that other woman and when she come
[1:05:25] walking by and seeing there was nobody
[1:05:27] at the feet of Jesus she said I know
[1:05:30] what happens at his feet I know what
[1:05:32] takes place at his feet I got to run and
[1:05:34] get something and she wouldn't got that
[1:05:36] Alabaster oh and man there's too much to
[1:05:39] preach in it but I think it's powerful
[1:05:40] she went right in the crowd amen she
[1:05:42] elbowed her way right in brother being
[1:05:45] she didn't care what anybody thought she
[1:05:47] didn't care how they felt that was Jesus
[1:05:50] she had a need and she had an
[1:05:52] opportunity and she elbowed her way in
[1:05:55] to get to his feet you know what she did
[1:05:57] that Alabaster oil they say is the most
[1:05:59] costly of all the oils and she had a
[1:06:01] whole bottle full of it brand new she
[1:06:03] had just bought it amen you know what
[1:06:05] she did she didn't open the top of that
[1:06:07] bottle and sprinkle his feet a little
[1:06:09] but the scripture tells us that she that
[1:06:11] she broke the top off of it she broke
[1:06:14] open the vessel you know why she did
[1:06:16] that because she was going to pour
[1:06:18] everything in it on him whatever she had
[1:06:21] saved was now going to be poured out on
[1:06:23] him let me say something this morning
[1:06:26] amen you might have been holding some
[1:06:27] things back from God for a long time but
[1:06:30] when you see him in his power it should
[1:06:32] be the moment that you take the
[1:06:34] reservations off and pour on him
[1:06:38] everything that you've been holding back
[1:06:41] I think you ought to Quick holding back
[1:06:42] I think you ought to get into action
[1:06:44] this morning you ought to say this is
[1:06:46] the Son of God this is the truth and I
[1:06:49] want to give my life to
[1:06:51] him it's a Time for Action
[1:06:55] brother Wayne I don't know can this even
[1:06:57] happen in our day listen I'm preaching
[1:06:59] to you this morning and I can confess to
[1:07:01] you and testify that he is the same
[1:07:03] Jesus this
[1:07:06] morning you home folk have heard me tell
[1:07:08] it let me just re me just retell this
[1:07:10] our musicians come I was in a prayer
[1:07:13] meeting one morning or a Sunday morning
[1:07:16] service actually I wasn't even speaking
[1:07:19] I was sitting on the sidelines that
[1:07:21] morning the pastor was gone we had a
[1:07:22] special guest preacher and I was sitting
[1:07:24] in there and after the brother got down
[1:07:26] preaching he went and sat down and my
[1:07:29] sister that had been uh suffering with a
[1:07:32] stroke had been there in the church that
[1:07:34] morning and and when she seen me with a
[1:07:37] mic she well we had a special
[1:07:39] relationship let's just put it that way
[1:07:40] she was a she was a believer she'
[1:07:42] backslid about 25 years and she went
[1:07:44] into some serious sin she she really
[1:07:47] she' really got in bad trouble and when
[1:07:49] she got ready to come back I went and
[1:07:51] seeing her at the hospital and and was
[1:07:53] testifying to her and she said to me she
[1:07:54] said brother Wayne She he said do you
[1:07:55] really think the people would let me
[1:07:58] come back to church they forgive me I
[1:07:59] said sister I said the bride of Christ
[1:08:02] is the most forgiven people in the
[1:08:03] planet if you just humble your heart and
[1:08:06] repent and seriously ask him to forgive
[1:08:07] you those people accept you like you
[1:08:09] never done anything to start with and
[1:08:11] sure enough it happened just like that
[1:08:14] so we were had a little special
[1:08:15] connection you know and uh I'd knew her
[1:08:17] since I was a baby I guess but that
[1:08:20] morning she she wanted prayer so she
[1:08:22] come up for prayer for a stroke she come
[1:08:25] got in the
[1:08:26] line when she come and stood in that
[1:08:28] line I put my hand on her and began to
[1:08:31] pray for
[1:08:32] her I got finished and I said now sis
[1:08:34] what you need to do is just go testify
[1:08:36] your healing you need to go testify
[1:08:38] about this go confess your healing
[1:08:40] according to scripture that's what it
[1:08:41] said to do and she said to me she said
[1:08:43] well brother Wayne I've got a daughter
[1:08:45] that's a
[1:08:46] nurse and she said now when I go home
[1:08:50] and I tell them that I'm Healed she's
[1:08:51] going to say Mom what are you lying
[1:08:53] for I said sis listen my Bible said let
[1:08:56] every man's word be a
[1:08:58] lie that the word of God stand
[1:09:01] true I said you just tell her honey
[1:09:04] mom's not lying I'm
[1:09:06] confessing I'm confessing what Jesus
[1:09:09] Christ has done for
[1:09:11] me she come back that night and it's the
[1:09:15] oddest feeling you've ever had when
[1:09:17] you're the one in the prayer line you
[1:09:18] prayed for someone that morning and they
[1:09:20] come limping down she come limping down
[1:09:24] the aisle
[1:09:26] for prayer I thought so I got up met her
[1:09:28] again I saidwell Lord you know there's
[1:09:30] nothing I can do but pray that's that's
[1:09:32] that's I can pray I can believe I can
[1:09:34] pray but God's got to do the work so I
[1:09:37] laid my hand on and began to pray
[1:09:40] for or was going to pray for her and she
[1:09:42] said to me I looked at her I laid my
[1:09:44] hand on I looked at her and said
[1:09:45] something about it she said no honey she
[1:09:46] said I want to come up here and
[1:09:48] testify that God had healed me and she
[1:09:51] just as crippled she was that morning
[1:09:53] she said I'd like to testify so when she
[1:09:56] did that I was preaching with a mic
[1:09:57] about like
[1:09:59] this and I went to hand her the mic to
[1:10:03] testify and there she was with that
[1:10:05] crippled I believe it was her maybe her
[1:10:07] right side but her arm was all crippled
[1:10:09] up just like this and when I went to
[1:10:12] hand her the mic she reached out and
[1:10:14] took a hold of that mic with that
