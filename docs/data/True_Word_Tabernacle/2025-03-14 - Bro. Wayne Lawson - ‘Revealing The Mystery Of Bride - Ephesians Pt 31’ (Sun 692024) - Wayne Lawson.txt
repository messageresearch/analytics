Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen we certainly love you and God bless you if you have your Bibles today we would like to go right into the word of the Lord in the book of Ephesians the 5th chapter amen we're going to be going I would like to just read these uh few verses again of Ephesians 5:22 down to 32 amen um it's a tremendous area of the script scripture we have been in Ephesians uh for a little bit of time and this fifth chapter has got my attention right now so you bear with me uh wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord now for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now therefore as the church is subject unto Christ Christ so let wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now so ought men to love their wives even as their own bodies now he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourished and cherished it even as the Lord the church now we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones and for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh now this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church may God bless the reading as you could be seated this morning and this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen uh I want to speak to you if I take a subject this morning I want to talk to you about revealing the mystery of bride revealing the mystery of Bride and and when I when I say that I I I think of here where Paul says but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen being Church being his body and and I'm I'm going to uh use this as a marriage of course bridegroom and bride so we want to talk about the bride part of this um when I when I say this of course Paul it's amazing because Paul is the one who is introducing marriage to the Gentiles he he's bringing the Covenant of marriage to the Gentile church and it's in the book of Ephesians where he's doing it which of course Ephesians is the book of placing and he's placing the Gentile Church in the idea of marriage until this time of course Gentiles didn't have probably a good concept of marriage but they do it this time amen and he's trying to bring the position to them now I I I think it's powerful as he's going to reveal to them what church means what what it means to be a part of the body is speaking about being a part of the Bride now we are living in the season that I do believe that the marriage of the Lamb has come I I believe that that is the season that we're living in uh when I say that of course if you go to Romans the 7th chapter and you see that Paul says that a woman is bound to her first husband as long as he lives but he said that but when he would die she was free to marry another now now brother bandam takes that and he said now you might think amen that that's about marriage and divorce he said but it's actually a prophecy written for the end time which speaks of the marriage of the Lamb it's speaking of that the denominational church had held the church and the bride in it in its the denomination had held it and as long as the denomination lived she was not free to marry but God let the thing die that she would be free to marry so the what's going on today is an event that is made clear by the prophecy of scriptures modern events are made clear prophecy what is all of this about it's about the marriage of the Lamb what's the message of the hour about it's about God taking himself a bride what is it the ministry of brother brandham what is all of this about why all the Tod do what's it what is it it's the great marriage of the Bride you know when royalty gets married big things happen you know they spend uh uh when a king takes a bride or a princess or you remember England they had that marriage a few years ago and Princess Kate married William and I I was actually up in uh Canada when it happened Chris and I were up there with at Saskatoon with brother men those guys and that's all anybody talked about was that wedding they were talking about it over people were staying up half the night and there's no telling the millions and millions and millions of dollars that was spent on on dresses and and and uh security and big cars and man goodness you I mean but it was a marriage it was going on and that's what it was all about now when we look at hour that we're living somebody said well that's a whole lot going on just about a marriage but you're talking about the marriage of the Lamb you're talking about the king of heaven and you're talking about the Queen of Heaven your marriage is a big deal amen this is a big thing and God has gave a marriage to the lamb and the Bible says in Revelations 19 of course let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself rich ready and to her was granted that she would be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints so what she's going to wear amen is going to be amen a grant from him in other words he has prepared her wedding clothes and we know of course that is what the third poll was about was to dress the bride for this marriage and and we see then that this was this was the announcement of the age that there would be now the last time we spoke to you on this it was the marriage of the Lamb I'm going to rehearse just a moment and then continue amen that we have seen that this is the announcement of the age this is the what the Thunders have thundered it they brought a voice out of the throne and they they brought forth the wedding they brought forth the promises of the marriage of course in the Jewish wedding amen the moving from betrothal to wife actually happens under the receiving of the marriage covenant and we recognize that in this age we have had the opening of the Seven Seals amen which was the marriage certificate to the bride it was the Lamb's Book of Life it was the opening of the word it's always been amazing to me that when brother bam comes to dedicate the temple or the Tabernacle there in 1962 he's right there as he's coming to dedicate it he does it in the opening of the seals under goddess in Simplicity and they have uh they have changed the the they have changed the Tabernacle and they moved it from two sections to three which was I thought was very good and then when they when they bring it out brother Bram comes out and he says now I'm a little late getting out to preach this morning he said because I did something in the back room and he had actually married a couple in the back room before he came out to preach there he said now it's real symbolic to what we're about to do here amen that there was a marriage in the back room if you know brother Josiah Scott some of you do his daughter comes here a lot but brother Josiah that was his wife Debbie's uncle that was married back then there in the back I think their name is p pagi yeah I can't get the name exactly what is it it's they're from Arizon it's baji I believe y'all know him huhi Bazi I can't get the name right forgive me amen I just butchered them poor people's names amen but the but the prophet said he had came out for the for for for from it and he said uh if you ask him Josiah said I ask him and he said brother brandom had asked him do you want to be married out in front of the church I'll perform the wedding right out in the church he said or I'll perform it in the back room in this office and they said no brother random we'd rather have a private wedding and he said you you have made the right choice amen because see that third pool was never going to be a public show it was going to be a private thing and what was happening was happening in private amen the world just thought it was a preacher preaching they thought it was just seals opening amen but it was the word word of God coming to make the promise that the bride received it amen and we recognize the prophecy of the hour that's why a prophet would it would entitle the time that we're living he would call it the bright age of course it's the marriage of the Lamb that's what we're talking about this is the season that when the headship of the word would become one with the body it would be receive the message of the hour this would be the time amen that the prophet in the seal book in the first seal he said I'm going to call you bride he began to really differ between church and bride telling you the church amen natural was going to go through the tribulation that the church natural was like the five foolish virgin but he was telling you there's another group there's a wise virgin that have heard the call come out to meet him amen they had went into the marriage amen and we find out in this age of course that this Malachi 4 this ministry this William bradam the world over talks about him now to them he's William bradam but to us he's Elijah to them he's just William brandom to us he was an elaser that brought us to our Isaac Amen to us we know he was coming to choose a part of that Brad relation amen I'd love to know to this morning that we have been chosen by God's provided way Amen to be a bride now there's come churches and churches but there's just got to be one bride and that bride will be made up not just of mechanics only but also of Dynamics now Isaac found this bride in the evening light and we find that this bride will be found by elaser in the evening light this message will'll find the church in evening light it's when the evening Light Came amen you must you could have been uh uh been anybody you was anywhere doing anything but when the evening Light Came you found found out in that light that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ there was not another message could reveal that to you maybe you were Baptist or you were a part of some uh H H church somewhere some church natural and and thank God for all of the Christian churches we appreciate the Lord for them we're not we're not anti- uh churches and people of at all but yet some things cannot be revealed under certain light amen but under the evening light would be a revelation that would bring a marriage to you to Christ himself amen if we every every one of these marriages has to have a certificate and brother bam said the Lamb's Book of Life was your marriage certificate he said the unmar grace of God was the wedding band that you were you were predestinated so we found amen that we are already married amen this bride is not getting married she's already married amen so it's time to recognize the relationship that you have with him so as you can approach him not as a boyfriend not as a flirter not as somebody that you just met but this is your husband and and your checkbook is his checkbook amen and and you know I I found that in the marriage of the Jewish wedding they they actually Yom Kapur of course is the day of atonement we all recognize that and it happens every year for Israel under the blood of bulls and goats and it was a time of resetting of doing away with sins and a and a casting away and remembering the atonement and of course it happens for a nation but when the marriage takes place I was reading some articles on it and they say that there was a personal yum kapore takes place every time a woman gets married amen and what it is is it's when she has done away with her own reputation and her own name and she takes a new name and she takes a new reputation and that's exactly what's happened to the church in this hour we have lost our reput and we have took his amen I know a lot of people didn't want nothing to do with the message of the hour amen but when we saw amen an opportunity to say something good about it to to preach about it to to bless the name of the Lord you know what happened just like that little woman that that was in the Bible that saw Jesus in the house of Simon and he wasn't being worshiped and remember His Feet was dirty and he sat there in the corner and she saw an opportunity to get to the feet of Jesus and when she did she poured upon him the anointing oil and she washed his feet amen you know what she did she took his reputation on her amen I tell you what that's a good reputation to carry he took her reputation and she took his he said to her go and sin no more he took her reputation away from her but when she left her she had the reputation and every time the gospel is preached everywhere the gospel is preached this woman had to be mentioned because her name is mentioned with his name because now she carries his reputation and I thank God that every time the message of this hour is preached it has to recognize there is a people on the Earth today that believe this message they believe the word of God Amen and when you preach about William Brandon you preach about the end time message I know we have a reputation but it's his reputation and I believe that's a reputation carry in this hour a reputation of being the Bride of course Paul of course Paul is going to introduce us amen as the mystery of the Bride going all the way back to Genesis the 2 chapter amen the Bible tells us amen that this is where God brought Adam and Eve together but where did he get Eve out of Adam and you said brother Wayne where are we going to get a bride today we're going to get it out of Christ and you you see where Adam came from out of him came a Eve and so is it today you said brother Wayne where you going to get a bride out of it's got to come out of the same word that spoke of him is the same word that speaks of you and me you've got to get her out of the word you've got to bring her out of the word if she's brought out of denomination she ain't the right one if you bring her out of your ideas or opinion she's not the right one but this will be a word bride who comes from the scripture that's exactly what is upon her in this age you have been brought to Christ just like Eve was brought to Adam amen there is a bride being brought to Christ in this age amen now God uses the position of bride to describe his relationship with the church I'm glad to know that he views us the way we view him if he views us as bride amen then we view him as bridegroom but we also realize his view of us is that kind of relationship and we find out now the scripture tells us if we're going to have that position then we're going to take his name according to scripture amen she takes his name I know we're living in an age amen when women are keeping their own names you know and and they get married and and they keep their own names they keep their own identities they keep all that but that's not a scriptural marriage at all right that's a lean marriage you see they want to be married but they don't want to change names they want to be married but they don't want to change bank accounts you know may maybe sometimes women have more money than men these days I don't know amen but you in the case of Christ amen it's not so at all amen amen he has everything we need and our name is being changed to his now when you start looking into something you say well that's a bride well there's got to be symbology and prophecy if it's going to have an identification it has to have scriptural identification now if you go to the book of Acts the 15th chapter when the gospel became unto the Gentiles in Acts the 15th chapter the 12th verse uh down to the 18th that you could just read here that there was a great happening when Jesus had been on the earth he had told his disciples and he gave them power but he had said now don't go unto the Gentiles but stay here with the house of Israel but in Mark 16 Jesus told them to go unto the whole world and preach the gospel so he changed from being a Jewish religion to being a gospel that would be for all of the Seed of Abraham now there was some of the disciples that were there who were used to working with Jews only and when they begin to see Miracles done among the Gentiles it was very troubling to them in Acts 15th chapter we find out this that the the Bible says in the 12th verse that the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Paul and Barnabas and declaring Miracles and wonders that God had wrought among the Gentiles by them and after they had after they had held their peace Jame answered saying men and Brethren hearken unto me and and I want you to notice who says this and James answered saying men and Brethren hearken unto me Simon hath declared how God did first visit the Gentiles to take them out a people for his name and to agree with the words of the prophets as it is written so Simon is saying that God would take a people out for the Gentiles of the Gentiles and now James is saying it is written in the scripture that after this will I return and build again the Tabernacle of David which is fallen down and I will begin build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up that the resid of men I tell you amen God's going to build out of the residue of men in other words he's going to take the low parts and he's going to use them to build this bride that he's talking about this Tabernacle or this tent of David is talking about the housing place of the Ark of the Covenant it's where it would be it would be put in the residue of men and he would seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called sayith the Lord who does all these things so in other words he's saying this is not Simon and this is not Paul and Barnabas doing this but this is God doing this and watch in the 18th verse known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world so he said not only is it that Amos prophesied this but the one that's doing it knew he would do it before the beginning of the world isn't it amazing that this bride was chosen not in this age she was not chosen 200 years ago or or even here in the book of Acts when they're talking about the prophecy but God chose this bride before the foundations of the world that everything that he did had in mind a bride that he was going to choose and use and become a part of him amen Simon had declared it that God did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name amen other words a place to display himself a place to the Bible actually says that they would he would take them out for a people for his name it means he would superimpose over them his own name he would Place upon them his identity he would put up upon them his grace now in Hosea 1 and9 you know the prophecies and these are just prophecies to show you like if I say I had something on my mind you said well I'm not sure and then I went and picked up five sealed letters and brought them back to you and broke them open and said now back 2,000 years ago here's what I was thinking and and and 500 years ago here's what I was thinking so it would unsealing it would reveal this has been there the whole time but now it's being brought to you so all the way back in Hosea he said I will call his name laomi in other words Hosea is going to have a child by Goomer and then he's going to bring forth and when they name the child the name of this child is going to see you are not my people he says and I will not be your God but yet the number of the children of Israel should be as the Sands of the sea which cannot be measured by numbered it shall come to pass that in the place where it is said ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them you are the sons of the Living God now you Bible readers know that doesn't say the Servants of the Living God it said the sons of the Living God when God is dealing with Israel he's dealing with servants when he's dealing with Gentiles he's dealing with sons and here it says you shall be the sons of the Living God Amen all the way back in Hosea he was saying these people that are not L of people they're going to be my people and the people shall be a people that I will write my name upon them I'll tell you it's a powerful thing in Romans Paul explains the prophecy and he says he says also even us whom Heath called not Jews only but also Gentiles when he said in Hosea amen I will call them my people which were not my people and beloved which were not beloved and it shall come to pass in the place where it is said unto them you are not my people there they shall be called the children of the Living God that's why Peter prophesies in 1 Peter 2:9 you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that have called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light where in times past you were not a people amen he's telling you I knew where you were I knew the kind of people you were but now we have a obtained mercy and we are be called the people of God Amen I know this sounds like amen it sounds like oh he's talking about Peter and Paul and Hosea and you're thinking about something years and years ago but I want you to understand amen that you sitting here as a people was such a motive in everything God did that all the way back to Hosea he was having people named kids that was going to tell you years later I had him named this baby so one day a preacher could stand in the pull pit and tell you the name of the child means you weren't my people but now you are my people and you have obtained Mercy he had Peter prophesy it and say to you I called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light you talk about light I'm talking about bride light I'm talking about somebody that can turn the lights on in your dark life and tell you that God had you on his mind he had you in Prophecy of this Bible before the world's ever be this bride takes the name of the deity of Jesus Christ a name represents a character of life and the name of Jesus Christ is the character of the life of almighty God Jehovah's elected salvation saves us Jesus Joshua the Savior God salvation it's the life of Jesus Christ that is in the church I tell you this the name of God is the very character it's not just the name it's the life that's behind the name and think about it this morning there's a life that's in this bride that was the same life that was in Jesus Christ I'll tell you this God has gave us a position and he has put us legally in a place where he can deal with us anytime he wants to come on Church there's no laws governing when he can deal with us no more not times or dates or moons or ecclesiastics or laws in the days of Moses yall know laws you know it was laws that dealt with the Israel people and only certain times they could come only certain times they could have Lambs y'all know what's right had to be of a certain lineage to go into the holies of holies and only then one time a year and you could only see the fire and you couldn't get close and listen but what God did is he created a position called bride that he removed every law and every tradition and every Dogma that God could walk in the middle of your life on a Sunday morning and the Holy Ghost can fall he don't have to ask questions he don't have to ask nobody if he can he don't have to have a certain lineage or a certain race or a certain place amen God who is rich in Mercy could come in this building when he wants how he wants anytime he wants because he is God and he can legally move the way he wants to move he created a position called bride yes woo glory be to God pise that he might be able to legally do it that's why he called it the Tabernacle of David right y'all know the Tabernacle of David didn't have the laws connected to it it had the ark and yet I think many of the Psalms were written right outside the tent and that wasn't under it was daily sacrifices daily Praises it it bypassed all the laws Moses law was still set up down there right but David was under another law he was under prophet phy of praise and rejoicing speaking of one day there would come something that would be outside the Traditions that he could do what he wanted to with he created a position called bride so that he could do this by his own word I'll tell you it's a powerful thing the predestinated place it's predestinated in other words when God did this he did it all the way back in his mind so everything he did from that time forward would reveal that that was what was on his mind uh you're if you're building a house how many house builders we got in here if you're building a house and you got a you know if you're custom building and a lady says to you look hey I got this vest I bought in Egypt and it's it's this big and it's this and this and I'd like to have it right in my living room and I'd like to have it in that back corner there and I want a notch and I want it a certain way and I want lights on it and you know that before you start building so when you start build building that living room you got a funny looking spot back there and every other Builder that don't know that plan and they don't know that thought they'll wonder why is he doing that right well we don't do it like that down at our church we we we just cover that right off and but see he knows there's something coming so he builds it with the thought in mind and it usually nobody knows about it until it's finished and then the whole thing is revealed at the same time I thank God for it knowing amen that that we see that when God begins to reveal it that that thought is there now all the way now this was Jesus himself look back to Matthew 20 if if some of these scriptures are um um how can I say if they're common to you we're doing our job yeah in Matthew the 20th chapter I was reading some scriptures to some to a family one day here maybe a year ago and a lady said what why don't we know these scriptures in the Bible I said well I don't know I'm sorry whoever you're whoever's training you I I think they should have probably showed you these scriptures so I don't want to show up that day and said Lord said why didn't you show them them scriptures I want you to see these scriptures in Matthew the 20th chapter then came to him the mother of zebedee's children which were her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him yeah Jesus of course in the 21st verse it said and he said unto her what will thou she said unto him Grant these my two sons that they may set the one on the right the other on the left in thy kingdom and Jesus answered and said you know not what you asked now you're able to drink of the cup and be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized and they said unto him we are able he saith unto them you shall drink of my cup baptized with a baptism I'm baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father but it is to be given to them who is prepared of my father now it's amazing to me that this is the sons of zebedy that her the mother is wanting them to sit on the throne they're wanting them to share the throne with Jesus she recognizes his kingship and authority and what's amazing if you go back and read in the Book of Matthew you'll find that the sons of zebede of course are James and John and it's here it is in the Book of Matthew James is hearing from Jesus's own words look they can't set in this place because it has been predestinated for another people other words we're saving the seat right here I know they're not here right now but there's people coming and they got to have a place to be and I have gave them this place and it's James is the one that's hearing this of his own life I can't take it I thought wasn't it something that over in the book of Acts when they're all fussing about Gentiles not having a place in the power of God it was James that knew the prophecy in the Book of Amos that prophesied the Gentiles would sit there I thought oh God Amen even this man James under the inspiration of Jesus knew there was something coming out of that Gentile race here he is using scripture to prove the people set there are going to be Gentiles see it was not them tog now if you if how can I overcome 1963 brother R said there's a mother's desire for her son watch that place Jesus said was predestinated the position was not in existence at that time but it will be granted to them who it's meant for the one set to the right hand the other the closest yet was an overcomer see I don't Grant this I grant this but it will be given after the trial comes after the trial comes how many knows who it was meant for after the trial comes remember the adoption series brother Ram talks about amen that every son must be tried and after his trial then he conquered every gate and brother B then teaches adoption and tells us that you're a son but you got to be trained you got to be tried and after the trial then you possess every gate is that right come on church amen and the trial would not come until the lay out to see and age that's why adoption age don't come until leosa when the Bible said he that overcometh I grant to him to set in my right hand and at my left hand isn't it amazing that adopted church is that bride who's Ephesians five the great mystery Paul was revealing is that this position of bride is the adopted sons of Romans the eth chapter they are the manifested sons that have been on the mind of God from the foundation of the world God will work through that body and he will do it with legal rights can you imagine what God wants to do somebody well you can't work here and you can't work here and you can't work here he said I'll create a position I can I'll prophesy a place I'll make my own place I hope you hear me this morning that's why William brandom cried out in the end of his ministry I'll ride this Trail again it wasn't brother brandom going to ride again amen but Christ was prophesying a place for himself in a bride Ministry that would come in the last day he can do it legally people say well only a prophet could do that amen but a prophet spoke a place for you and I to manifest God in the age we're living in we are working on the authority of a prophet we are not presuming we are not trying to be something we are not we're not trying to make oursel bride he married us he chose us he anointed us he redeemed us this is his work Hallelujah be to God chose you and elected you I don't care what you think about yourself this morning I know what the Bible says about you I know what the prophecy says about you you say I'm not going to make it I said that there's 2,000 year old prophecies laying here that says you will make it and you won't just make it but you're going to overcome you're going to rise up above every bit of it Hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah my praise be to God what an hour to live what a time to manifest you want the scripture it's it's Revelation 3 and 21 to him to overcometh what I grant to set with me in my Throne yeah brother Bram said I don't care how many fastings and repentances no matter what you present to God nobody will gain the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will only be granted to that word bride I don't care how much you fast you ain't getting there come on church I don't care if your mama asked for you your daddy asked for you it don't matter what position in the life you got don't matter how good or how bad it don't matter what you have done it will only be granted to that bride who has been appointed for that place my goodness to think of the grace that is over our lives prophecy laying over this bride no wonder there's a big Todo no wonder it's it's the big thing that is happening the greatest the greatest miracles in the world the most miracles in the world the greatest the greatest auditoriums that's ever been been filled up the greatest move of God that's ever struck the planet Struck it in the end time what's it about the marriage of the Lamb yeah it was done for you to get you where you are yeah so brother Wayne well I'm just you know I'm just a little old me no it's really time you found out who you are amen it's really time for somebody to let you in that you bypassed your first birth your word birth and you were born into this Earth but that word that you bypassed has come to catch you that word you byass has come to catch you and there's a junction in the road immortality step down on the Route 66 you were living on you bypassed it but God met you in the junction and brought you back to the word of God listen amen this bride is already married to him how could he ever forget her how could he let her go he said oh a suckling babe could forget their mother or the mother forget their baby he said but how could I ever forget you come on take a measuring stick and measure the ocean you say I can't then how could he ever forget you how could you measure it how could you look at it but God who is rich in Mercy had it in his mind woo everything he did had everything he saw every place he went it spoke of his intentions it's amazing to me we're the children of Abraham the Royal seed right the Royal seed the Royal bride seed yeah now everybody knows that Jesus was the royal seed but the Royal seed's got a bride so it's a royal Queen seed and and the and and you go all the way back to Genesis 22 and you find that this is this is when they've traveled and they get out on the mountain and and Isaac and Abraham's going to go up on the mountain remember the story and Abraham's carrying the wood yeah and God had told him to take his son up there and crucify him and burn him on the steak and remember then Abraham had said the boy and I'll go the boy and I'll return yeah he knew even if he had to destroy his body that God had gave him from the dead he was able to raise him from the dead yeah he had a perfect faith in what he had received from God now now folks that Mountain's very important because what you're seeing is he's tested on the thing he was given he he had a test he he he spent 25 years waiting for the child now the child's about 14 year old and he's tested on the child yeah see you waited for the message for 400 years yeah the prophecies are 2,000 years of Prophecy waiting for this message to come right but but after you get the message you're going to be tested on it oh brother bam missed it here and he said that he did the see the bride Church the adopted church is tested on the message the message ain't on trial your faith is on [Applause] trial wow you can say well I don't know if brother bram's right that's already settled that's 60y old LS it's in the history books what the question today is is who is that bride where's she at amen how do we find her she's tested on it and that true bde will be tested on it watch when you go up Genesis 22 any commentator that you read can tell you that Isaac was Jesus he was carrying his own cross carrying his own wood up the cross the son of Abraham yeah Human Sacrifice yeah yeah Isaac was Jesus yeah yeah but it's not until the end time that you can find the bride in that scripture do you know the brides in there you don't see her until the story's told cuz let me can I can I can I paraphrase to youall Bor Brother Ray I'm gonna paraphrase it won't be exact so don't count it okay but let me ask you something what did Abraham tell Isaac what did he tell him to get him to sacrifice his own life what kind of story did he tell now see if Abraham would have come at a different time he couldn't told him this right he he meant there was a time MDC came promise came Elohim visited him on the tree he had all kinds of different experiences and 25 years of waiting talk about Earth child had had Isaac appeared in any other part of the story he wouldn't have been able to hear it all but on the mountain up there on that altar see Isaac could hear the entire Redemptive story yeah right he could tell him about from the moment he met God in ER chalis yeah and his journey and his security and how he how he lied about his mama and how he had a body change and how God protected her and how Elohim come and he he could have convinced Isaac and brought him into the same faith that Abraham had that Isaac could have said you're right Dad the god that brought me here if you take my life he could Raise Me Up then here take my life I'll lay it down willingly you see that when that full story is told all the sudden they hear a sound in the bush and it was a ram caught in the thicket right now the Bible is clear to say it was a ram caught with his horns in the thicket now there's that bride that Ram in the bush somebody said well way what the world you talking about listen now and Jehovah JRA brother Ram said God provides his own right now if you go back to Genesis 15 and I'll just lay this in and carry on you can ask me later if you need some answers on it but in Genesis 15 Abraham has promised he's going to have a seed he's going to have a he's going to have an air right going to have a seed and he tells the Lord in Genesis 15 he don't have one only eler this servant is all I have is an heir of my home how do I know I shall inherit and God said well I'll tell you it's easy go down build an altar and take of the Altar and I want you to take five animals down there there and remember what he does he takes a he takes a a a she goat and I think a a oo or lamb and then he says the third one was a ram and brother Ram said now I want you to notice this the first two sacrifices on that altar were female okay but the third one is a he it's a ram showing you the bride will never take a church name feminine she will never take the name Baptist see she'll never take the name Lutheran she will never take the church's name but the real is the manifested word so she's going to take his name I will have a people for my name see there's a there's people joining churches everywhere and they're taking the name of Baptist or Lutheran or Presbyterian and God bless all the people I'm not against none of the people amen but the name they're taking is the name of a religion or Society or something somewhere but God produced this message which was the spoken manifested word and that is the mate of the church when you see that it was the third one in line what was it it was Christ marrying the bride that bride is right there there's Malachi four I shall restore saith the Lord amen bringing the children back it was there under the realm now if you want to study that it's Jehovah jbra part 3 1964 paragraph 209 the Royal seed will not be called by the church denomination of sheot no but by him the manifested word of the realm he is the word of the ram see he would take a people for his name and bear his name oh what are you afraid for then a gentile will bear his name the realm not her the church he Hallelujah see it's he amen it's the word the church has become joined with what is it he was the word not her him the name of the Lord Jesus Vindicated word Now by The Promise the word that was promised amen it has come to him you see what it is he would write his name upon her all the way back to this we find him prophesying in Abraham's day speaking of ram speaking of the Bride marrying the word in that generation amen now it's amazing to me because that John all the way in the Book of Revelations is prophesying amen that he would call this bride a city isn't it amazing that in one place you seeing yourself as RAM typed in scripture another place you're seeing yourself in the heavens as a or a child that's being born or you're seeing yourself in many ways but when John saw you he saw you as a city amen isn't it amazing to me that the most the most glorious City in all of the scripture was the city of New Jerusalem and when bride amen when you were saw by John in the scripture John was seeing a revelation of you as City you know what's amazing John saw two great cities in the Bible and both of them were mysterious cities he saw one of them which was the city of Babylon great mystery Babylon in Revelation 17 And1 and there came one of the Seven Angels which one of them seven angels you reckon it was amen had seven vows and talk with me saying come hither and I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great horde that set up upon many Waters who revealed the Harlot system yeah that seventh angel and the angel said unto me John why did you Marvel at what you have seen I'll tell thee seventh verse I'll tell thee The Mystery of the woman woman and the Beast that Carri her the way the seven horns what was it he began to see that this woman was drunk with the blood of saints so John begin to reveal that will be two Brides In the End Time there will be two great cities one of those cities will be a city of God and the other will be the habitation of devils and every unclean thing amen the same one who revealed mystery Babylon also reveals the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21:9 he said in one of the Angels had the seven vows of the last plagues talk to me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife don't have time to preach on it but he don't say the Lion's wife does he it's the Lamb's wife and and we see then he describes the city of Babylon as a place of confusion now notice he's showing you the difference in the charistics will be prophesied of those cities when he shows you Babylon it's a place of confusion and the Bible said upon her head was written the mystery Babylon the mother of harlots and the Abominations of the Earth the scripture tells us she's the habitation of every clean and hateful bird the prophet of God calls it the house of Hell her gates are the gates to hell she has a theological Max Factor to cover up the gates to make it look beautiful but within her Gates is the Gates of Hell Amen in Revelations 18 and two we find that a lighted Angel comes out of the heaven to call the children out of Babylon and come out of that City because the Bible prophesies she'll be destroyed in the space of one hour now folks when has any City ever been destroyed in the space of one hour but Atomic Warfare is going to make it possible that a city could be destroyed in the space of one hour amen what is it it's the cage of every unclean and every hateful bird describing a church that is full of the devil an antichrist system a city a woman it's a church it's a place of religion amen but it has Blasphemous names isn't it something the name written upon them is the name of blasphemy but there's another city and that New Jerusalem has another name it's not the name of blasphemy it's the name of God written upon her is the interpretation of the word of God god listen folks amen they ought to see has uh uh lukewarm and and and blind and naked and miserable and they don't know it and people look around and they say I wonder what that means but Le oia is interpreting that scripture they have the interpretation of it but the bride has the interpretation of this New Jerusalem city of what she would be in Revelation 21 John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there were no more sea and I saw a holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and we dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and shall be their God I'm prophesying I'm telling you your position in scripture come on watch watch this in Revelation 219 go back to it again and watch this Angel the seventh one I I just say it clearly the seventh one he said I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife is that not what he said I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife look at the next verse and the 10th verse and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me a great City isn't it something I'm going to show you a bride but he show him a city because the city of New Jerusalem types the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right she is the New Jerusalem she is the high mountain of God she is God's worship place in this hour you know when we look at this many times you if you're studying scripture and you want to you want to find it it's called Mount Zion in scripture bride is always Mount Zion right that's what the prophet said you know what Zion actually represents it the name Zion actually means son Sunny Place well I I liked it anyhow I thought it's pretty good Zion actually means Sunny place do you know Zion is actually built on a mountain and according to according to many of the writers amen the name Zion actually means Sunny place because it's the first place where light will strike in that Holy City I tell you friend amen you see everything else could be in darkness but them that are OPP Zion they shall see the light in the troubled times when everything else is setting in darkness there is a light that is shining in this New Jerusalem I know it's dark in leosia oh but to the bride Rise and Shine the Light of the word has come upon the church we amen we see the morning as it has come unto us this city has 12 gates and Foundations it is the tribes of Israel and the Patriarchs of old her cities are cities her streets are streets of gold and her gates are Gates of Pearl and I I know there's so much to preach on those Gates I I think years back our brother uh Brother Francis from over in South Africa done a whole whole series on Gates if you want to study the gates you probably get with brother Brian he's probably still got them but oh my goodness how powerful how powerful but those Gates of pearl you know they actually say the reason they call them Pearl is cuz it's over overcoming right a pearl is is what's made shiny and lustrous because it's in a because it's in a a shell I've seen many of them shiny little fellas some of them ain't perfectly round but they all got a beautiful luster on them and they shine nice because you know what causes that is friction they they're in a in a shell and there's a lot of sand and the water going in and out it just keeps rubbing them like this and after a while it'll polish them dudes up amen so I'll tell you anytime you see Pearl you see overcoming anytime you see Pearl you see somebody has overcome amen I know it's adversity and I know it's trouble amen but her gates are the gates of pearl them that come in come in through overcoming Church you don't get in this without overcoming amen but it's a city of Overcomers it's a city amen where you walk on streets of gold her steps are steps of deity do you know this bride amen we're not talking about deity just in Jesus I'm talking about deity in you and every footstep you take deity is in the bride of Christ oh Hallelujah she's a city oh a city to look at you are the household of God of foundations of Apostles and Prophets and we just preached on that so I'll not go down that line but this mystery Bride is a great mystery it is God's Eternal mystery brother Bram said but now has been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ amen amen that's what God Christ is doing in the church he's letting her know his Secrets what is it he's revealing this word that you might see your position in the word brother bam calls it he said you don't know how much it means to see yourself positionally in the scriptures you I I just want to say this to you if you're trying to find yourself find yourself in the word yeah amen if you're trying to find yourself find yourself in the word I'm going to tell you something thank be to God every time I read the Bible it reads the same I'm so thankful that this book don't change with my moods I I'm thankful that this book don't change with my age my situation or nothing else so if you find yourself find yourself in the word and then you find stability that will Outlast the trials of your life what is it it's that word bride she's the word bride the word groom what is it amen it's a Creed not a Creed or denomination it's a living Oracle of God a living attribute now y'all stay with me just a few minutes here amen I I'm not going to be quite as long as it was last Sunday so you'll be okay that was funny amen it ain't funny when you got to tell people it's funny right amen look now God is in his body Christ and Christ is in his body the bride you are his body God made manifest in Christ but Christ is made manifest in the bride do you see what he's done I hope every man and woman I'm going to quote the prophet will understand this she is the second Eve but she is not breaking and spooling her skirts of Purity and Holiness to her husband amen she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody says am what is it it's her Heavenly place she is blessed with a Heavenly place it's a Heavenly position you may not be nothing in the world but to God you're everything you may not have a position with somebody else in the world and you want to be friends or close to somebody oh but God made a position that is closer than his right hand amen he made you one with himself he made you his bride blessed be the God and the father who ha made us and according to him has chosen Us in Heavenly places amen which speaks of heavenly position I want I just I just want to say this somebody said well brother Wayne if we're so important wouldn't our names be in the Bible they are yeah they are they're there in symbol but it took a message to teach you what part of the Bible you were that's right you were the Rebecca that elaser came to your name is right there in the evening time at the well worshiping and praising and watering camels that's right you're Tamar sitting there trying to bring yourself under disguise just desperate to get the seed of Judah in you yeah your name was Tamar come on you're the Rahab swinging the token from the window amen knowing that it matters what you do with this word you're that woman amen oh I so we always tell the story about her getting delivered from Jericho and coming out of Jericho but brother that is only half the story it's not just a coming out she didn't just come out of Jer but she became the great grandmother of Jesus Christ because she got married hallelujah we're not just coming out of denomination we're getting married we have married the lamb that the suit of Judah might come through the church come on you know you're that second Eve brother Richard the Second Eve you know what Eve should have done in the garden she should have brought Christ and she should have done it by the spoken word but Eve failed to do it it and Mary brought the manifested word and now we find out today we are another Eve and Christ is coming through this body into this age oh Church of the Living God I hope you got your seat belt on but Christ is descending into this age through your body it's coming out of you this is the bride coming of Jesus Christ [Music] oh Hallelujah your name is Rahab your name is Tamar come on Esther your name is estri preacher you got all these names in the Bible cuz you type every one of them amen your name is Esther you come running into the throne room and grab the scepter but what are you going to do with it she saved all of her seed by giving them Authority if you give this bride Authority they won't just try to get a new house or a new car or a new building they bring Salvation to those by the word of God that they believe you are the voice of Mercy to this age come on you're a Tamar and Esther you're a Rahab whether you like it or not you're a be Sheba come on you were in adulterer but your old husband died and the King took you the wife come on church amen thank be to God for Redemption stories hey I'll tell you brother Wayne God can't choose me I've got this problem I got this problem he already made the choice he made the choice when he chose Rahab and he made Tamar and he Cho now now Sister Hannah I want you to be sure that you understand that God is God and he don't change do we agree that God can't never change his mind and what he done in one age he has to do in another age so if God was wanting to choose a bride who would actually try to disqualify herself by her own failures and by her own circumstances he would choose one all the way back there who he qualified by his own work that when he come up here and he said will you marry me and you said well I can't do this and I can't do this he said oh but I made the choice all the way back there I chose you then he wasn't choosing Rahab he was choosing you thank you Lord he wasn't choosing Esther brother Kylie was choosing you because one day he would give a throne and he would give a scepter and he wanted to know what are you going to do with it your character is in [Applause] Esther see before you give somebody Authority you got to know what they're going to do with it your character has already shown what would be done with it yeah h Hallelujah y'all know I'm telling the truth that's why in revelation 22 brother Eric he could say the spirit and the bride say come and the prophet of God would take that scripture and say that you are the final voice to a final age not a voice of Vengeance but a voice of Mercy it's the voice that is in the bride do you see God still has a voice but that voice is in the bride yeah now what has happened is God took the feminist part of himself I know sometimes it's hard to believe this but let's just get down to the fact yeah yeah he took out the feminist part and put it in you he put his own Spirit In You amen is't that powerful yeah because now she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and power of his power she is him amen now these elect are the Eternal thoughts of God and who were elect before the world began so therefore God at this moment is not the author of a physical creation he's the author of another creation a creation called bride this creation of bride would be a new kind of people yeah Jes Jesus being the bridegroom was the head of the body right and he is the beginning of a new race of people that race being a God man now you all sitting here today have heard great great Scholars argue whether he was God or man and the trinitarians take it to task that he was God Amen and then they'll take it to task that he was a man and I see people that they they I remember years ago the Oneness groups they didn't really believe Jesus could have had a family if they didn't believe Jesus in the in the Tomb would have rotted but but he would have now because he was a man and the Bible said he was tempted of every type every like manner as you were tempted everything you go through he went through yeah right he was tempted of every like manner that he might be able to secure us in our Temptations right so he was both God and he was man now if you if you take any of the man part he's not your Kinsman and if you take any of the god part he was not your Redeemer to save you so he has to be God and he has to be man so in the Middle Ages they come up with a word called the hypostatic union and I and I'm not trying to get deep into theology but it's called a hypostatic union and it was used as a way to describe a union that would allow two things to come together and remain both the same thing but live in the same same body so in other words Jesus didn't have to be less man to be God and he didn't have to be less God to be man W Brothers it was a union between God and man and only God could do it most writers will end up calling it a paradox well that's a good word for it it's a paradox come on church but he was the beginning of that race and and and I remember years ago I was studying on the thought and then the Bible said don't be unequally Yol one with the other and and when he and when the when I read that something struck my heart and I thought that's right amen God is not taking an unequal mate yeah amen God is not talking it's not like a dog marrying a cat right come on church it's not like a lamb marrying a goat this is the same species God is marrying his own kind Hallelujah so that bride has got to be both male and female she's got to be human and she's got to be God come on deity dwells in the Tabernacle of a human body let me tell you what we're doing we're always focusing on the human part oh we're human oh we're human oh we're human we're amen I think anybody knows you're a human I know you're a human and the Bible said even God knows you're a human it says it he said even God knows the man's only human amen but what is a man that God would think of him what is a person like you that the Bible all the way from the book of Genesis to the Book of Revelations that you are part of this word because the word was with God and the word is in God and the word is made flesh in you today listen I know it's always a human part why couldn't we turn this morning and talk about the God part why couldn't we talk about the word part that word part of you this morning that the Holy Spirit has beg to move into you by the new birth and gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost I tell you this friend that deity dwells in the Church of the Living God it is a god part and as the father sent me so send I you the god that is in Jesus is the same God that has went in this church now being that this church is going to carry his life she's also going to produces fruit and brother bam says and I'll close here soon and brother Bram says it like this he says that makes her a bride Tree of Life you see it he was the tree of life but she's a bride Tree of Life the same as he bore profit fruit so will this bride bear profit fruit the fruit on her branches will not cast but she shall bring forth in her season exactly what God has prophesied Jesus himself brought Matthew 27 and Psalms 27 and he brought forth even so much to say that he done nothing unless his father would show him the life that was in the branches was the life of God and the fruit that was upon his branches were that which was spoken of him from prophets before him you didn't find any fruit on that tree that wasn't prophetic whether it was through Malachi or Ezekiel or whether it was through Moses it was a it was a it was a prophet tree and it only bore Prophet fruit what they do with the tree they cut it down didn't they and brother R said how did they kill it they put it on a Roman Tree they hung the Tree of Life on a Roman Tree yeah he said do you see then God planted another tree he planted a brid tree on the day of Pentecost yeah and he said look how he did it he justified it Sanctified it and then he filled it with a Holy Ghost and brought forth a bride tree he said now what did they do with that original tree what did the Romans do with the bride tree that come from Pentecost should have been the tree of life should have bore all the fruit but they cut it down and how did they do it how did they take down the tree of life brother Braham said the same way they took down the tree of life they took the brid tree they hung it on Creeds and Dogma wow he said now watch this don't get hung and when brother Ram saying it's it's a restoration bride tree when brother Ram is saying that I thought isn't that something how people get hung on certain sayings yes they get hung up on certain areas yeah and when they do it takes the life from the tree now what's amazing is is the same life that flows through it now that life that begins to flow through listen will be his life it will be his fruit but it's your branch for I am the vine and you are the branches and he that biteth in him shall bring forth much fruit without me you can do nothing what will it do it will bear the fruit of that day yeah see this part of fruit bearing lays within the human being you can't can't have fruit without a bride tree you've got to have the female tree to have the fruit and Jesus said in John 15:6 ye didn't choose me but I chose you and ordained you that you should bring forth much fruit this should be the bride is the tree to bring forth the fruit of God that's why he said the bride the word would come through in and through that bride do you see what it is then there is the power of that believing Church it is the law of reproduction that brings the seed to life it takes the message of the hour and brings it into life it takes it through the body it's the law of reproduction that whenever you lay a seed it has to bring forth of its own kind and this is a god kind it's there the very manifestation of the word would be in the life now this word is going to work through the bride it's going to work in the bride but it would be a prophet's message yeah you see Jesus was a prophet tree so is this bride a prophet tree and it will manifest profit fruit yeah it will bring forth that word now here's the thing folks when you look at this and and we we stand here today and we look at the systems that is in the world and we look look at religion and we look at all of the adversity to what truth holds in this generation I cannot say that there's anything less against the church today than it was in the days of the first church when Joel saw it he saw that it was a cankerworm and a caterpillar and a bugs and they eat at that tree remember it and they eat at that tree until there was there was nothing left but a stump the same bugs that ate on that tree are still here but but but the prophet said but watch when God be to restore the church through justification of Luther when he began to bring it out Luther branches started out on that tree he said and the same insect that attacked the first church attacked it again he said but this time it only killed the Lutheran limb it don't kill the whole tree it only kills the limb that it got on the Dogma the Creed and the the denomination begin to die so let me just say this to you the tree itself in this season we'll never die amen now somebody can take the message and they can go out there and death will strike it because they've added something to it they they brought something on it and and all of the sudden they begin to take the life out of it and they're sitting out there without life and because they have no life they believe there is no life let me say something to you you know God Lives you know God lives right but the question is is there a bride that lives and I say yes I say she's sitting in this building I say she's up from the dead I believe that the same life that was in Jesus Christ is in the Bride of Jesus Christ we know God lives but is there a bride that lives is there a message that lives I say the same insects that attacked the early church has attacked every church amen but this time there's a prophecy laying behind this bride church we see it in the Book of Joel I shall restore sayith the Lord I shall restore sayith the Lord every bug's against it but God's going to restore it anyhow every bug is attacking it but God's going to restore it anyhow you know why because prophecy is laying over this tree restoration is laying over this tree God is going to restore it anyhow can I say it as clear as I know how you can't stop this life you will never stop this life it was in the third day that it was to come now I'll skip a bunch of Prophecy and I'll just say it this it was in the third day this was to come just like our lord Jesus raised in three days the prophecy is there would be an Easter for the bride in the third day amen y'all know it when Jesus come up from the grave some saw him and they went around and they said he's alive but it was really only a rumor cuz not very many people had saw him yeah and when this bride began to come alive come on Revival struck isua Street yeah and Gifts begin to come back in this body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there went a rumor around the world he is alive but it's not till the evening of the third day when Jesus goes in with two disciples and reveals the resurrection that they have indicated proof he's alive and just the same as brother brandom's Ministry was to the isua street movement that was the morning of the third day his ministry was the evening light of the third day and the light began to shine oh Church of the Living God I I wish I had time to build you in these areas but I'll say this where does fruit come it comes in the top of the tree where does Light Strike in the top of the tree where is Mount Zion the top of the tree light for Resurrection has struck the body to mature the life that is laying down in there it's a word it's the third hour of the day or the third day and it shows a manifesting coming forth it was in that third day that's when Esther Rose up and decided something had to be done right it was in that third day when Joshua crossed the river Jordan it was in that third day that Jesus come up from the tomb it was in that third day that they sat there on the side of the Hill y'all know Tuesday afternoon Matthew 24 there was a couple questions asked Jesus and Tuesday afternoon the third day April the 30th brother bam said said that Jesus sat there with the disciples in the third day and told them the Myster of the seals in the third day Matthew 24 if you want to follow it's the six seals and brother R said but the seven seal ain't in there somebody said then what is the seven seal well he was the one talking yeah yeah there you go he wasn't one of The Parables he was the one talking yeah he was the one revealing the six seals what was it it was the word becoming unveiled on the third day we're living in the evening of the third day amen look at the world in the shape it's again yeah but there's something here to restore amen there's something here to restore there is nothing that can stop it God said I shall restore amen do you know David saying of this church he said she's like a tree planted by the water it's amazing to me that David and Joel see the same tree and then in Psalms 2 I'll get to Psalms one next week in Psalms 2 it's amazing because then David said why did the wicked rage why did the wicked rage they could not break the cords of Prophecy connected to Jesus they put him in the grave but three days he'd come out yeah why does a wicked rage today against against the church you can put her in the grave but she come out right because prophecy's laying there you can't stop it right sin tried you know many of you sitting here today sin tried I was just reminded our music players will come sin tried I just reminded today as I was sitting there this morning I was thinking about these things and I thought about that third day and was thinking about what God does on the third day you know and I remember the story brother brandom had been flying he' been crossing over Memphis Tennessee he said the plane had a little trouble and he had to land he said said they put me up I've been there to that little hotel it's real nice he put me the peab body he said the next morning I woke up and he said had some letters I wanted to mail he said so I just went down there to mail some letters and he said as I was walking down there I had a plane to catch and I was needing to go and he said I started walking he said all of a sudden something started leading me he said I started singing a little song I'm one of them and he said I started following the spirit he said after a little while I got down the colored side of town and he said I started walking and kept walking he said after a little while he said I looked over and there was a lady standing there he said she was standing there with Dew on her head standing at the gate he said' when I saw her she said good morning Parson he said well how' you know I was a Parson I I've often thought about this how many times had brother Brown told people who they were yeah this time she was telling him she didn't know his name William brandom because he says uh well I'm I'm I'm William brandom she saids do you know me she said no well then how do you know I'm a Parson well cuz I see I'm like a woman in the Bible who was a shite didn't have a child and yeah she said and God gave her one and child died and said that woman ran to Elijah and seek Resurrection she said I told the Lord I said Lord I'm like that woman but where is you're Elijah and she said Parson I seen you coming down the road well I'll tell you what to many it was just we brand him to that woman that was Elijah he said Well ma'am what's happened and she said well I got this boy said he got out and I raised him right I raised him right said but he got out in this world and said he got to a fool in around he got into sexual sin brother Bram later tells us it was syphus and the boy had contacted a disease and hadn't uh I don't even know if there is cure I don't know much about it but but he wasn't he wasn't able to be helped and that sin had got into his heart and she W look took brother brandom in there and she said brother B said well I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a Divine healer I I have healing campaigns all over the world maybe I could pray with him and she said well let's go in she Saidi really more interested in his soul persons he said I went there and stood over him and I said now tell me what it what it was he saidwell he's been laying here for the last hours and all he'll say is it's dark Mama it's dark said he's floating on this floating on this boat and he's out in this lost in this sea and all he's saying it's dark Mama it's dark brother BR said how long's he been this way she said for about three days Parson oh that struck me three days he's been laying there with that heart problem over sin he said you go ahead and pray mama and when Mama began to pray he said all I could tell she talked to the Lord before he said after she got done praying he said I just reached over on my hands on her the boy and just begin to pray and he said just when I started to pray he said he cried out it's getting light Mama it's getting light am amen and I thought oh what a representation of a third day amen when an Elijah come into this age and people's hearts were sin sick and because of sin and immoralities and Troubles of every kind Hearts troubled at every kind but God had a remedy he sent an Elijah he said he would turn our hearts back to restore us see this is is the third day the light has come the light that would restore the bride to her former position would you stand with us this morning maybe the Lord's dealing with your heart this morning do you see the thing of it is that the real trouble of our age is heart trouble Jesus says not what a man takes in his body it's what comes out of him you could close every alcohol business in the world if it wasn't in a man's heart to drink yeah sure because they would go broke yeah if nobody had desire to smoke or had no desire for sin right there would be no there would be no reason to have it because there would be nobody to consume it yeah but it's the heart right it's amazing to me that it was the third day the prophecy that the bride would restore again and Jesus in the Le oysa age said behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man would open up his heart that I would come in and I would Su with him this would be a heart changing message the message of William Brandon would change Hearts right it's a light that reaches to the depth of the heart and change his Hearts yeah many of you sitting here this morning I I was just trying to go over some things in my mind of of events and people and things and I was thinking all the way back brother Josh when you brought Johnny so long ago he was in our Bible study there Friday night and he was just talking and all a sudden my mind went back yeah they just a young man showed up with skull in his front pocket he wanted to meet the god that that man was talking about but see it was the third day amen and there was a message that can turn a heart amen thank you Lord isn't it amazing that the Holy Spirit could so uniquely lay things together yeah that he could have us all here at a certain moment yeah amen and have a message that could deal with our heart I wonder this morning when our hearts bowed our Elijah has brought a message to change Hearts I wonder this morning would you like to let Jesus in that heart to brother Wayne I just like to surrender
