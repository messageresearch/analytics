few points of order there's a there's a wallet back here in the la lost and found if you're missing wallet richard after the service um just some points of order uh if the lord leads tomorrow we may have a a prayer line like we had last year if if that's the case it'll be as the lord leads of course as the ministry feels if it is the case we we have some brothers and sisters um already prepared uh to support that with directing the flow the deacons and some of the sisters so so they're they're selected and um and uh so just we actually just uh um let that have an uh an orderly fashion stay out of the way and if you know as they need to direct it just be respectful of that amen today we had uh we know we got quite a few families visiting on the grounds during the day and at night it's a little bit of an issue there's a lot of young children running around and so just we ask the parents please keep an eye close eye on your children especially over here in the gym there's really no activities for for younger children that are not campers to be at the gym there's no activities there for them so so keep them in this area with the playground and everything if you would please some of you already know there's some there's some stickers some nice little stickers if you want a little keepsake from the camp see sister felice about those please do not stick those to anything we don't own actually don't stick it to anything you don't own and we'll be all right because i found one on my golf cart earlier and and i don't want to i don't want to name another rule already so hey man we told the young people this morning of course you know this youth camp is a very young event and so these brothers that know that over the years you know you start out just thinking everything's common sense and then as time goes on people create reasons for new rules and so what i said we'll do is uh every time we need a new rule we're going to name it after the person who's the reason hey man so yeah like like for instance the cross rule which is don't try to get a rule named after yourself that's the cross rule and and you don't want to know about the lindsay rule [Music] amen so we just appreciate we appreciate the behavior and the testimony that we've seen in the lives of the young people this weekend you really are a joy and uh and really this message produces the finest young people on the face of the earth [Applause] [Music] hey man so we we love you and we're proud of you and how many believe that our god is a god of purpose god of purpose because he's a god of purpose

stood before you just had buried my dear mother and going through a lot of time a time of grief and and things and can't say this year has been exactly easy but it's been grace his grace will take you through amen and we're thankful for his amazing grace and his goodness to us and his mercy to that's there for us in our time of need and our time of mourning and our time times of sorrow amen he knows what it's all about and he's there to lift us up and i'm thankful for that i know that many of you have went through some of those things in this past year and some very difficult times he didn't promise that we wouldn't have difficult times but he did promise he would be there for us during those difficult times and and i have to say he's he's true to his promises amen his promises are yea and amen so we're very happy to be here with you and and to be a part of this and i think it's a wonderful thing that we can have meetings like this for our youth and and i know it ain't just the young people that get to benefit from this but amen us mamas and daddies get benefits from it as well because you got new sons and new daughters coming home when they've been filled with the holy ghost and rebellion is gone and things are changed in their life you get a lot of benefit from it too amen and so we're thankful for that of course so thankful my wife was able to come with me and and uh you know i've been through a lot of changes in this last year i had two children get married and one get engaged and they're flying left and right away from the nest and i'm like what is going on but i i've been watching brother wayne around that little granddaughter and that's where i'm headed amen i heard that's a good place to be and so hey if you're going to get this old you might as well have benefits right so but uh amen brother andrew and sister sarah beth are with us tonight and right there and engaged here just a few days ago and one of their last youth camps together as single people amen and so uh it's a wonderful thing then you find a real mate amen god's choice for you and that's a great thing amen we're thankful for that and of course my youngest daughter katie is here as well and she's our caboose little redhead amen and uh we're thankful for her as well god bless you we bring you greetings from our home church brother tim pruitt as well my father and just just ask the lord to speak to us tonight i i want to take a thought on the light i've been on i've been on this subject of the light for some time at home but i want to speak on the light the chain breaker the chain breaker genesis 1 and verse 1 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen we let you be seated in the power of transformation the prophet says the bible said that the word or the the world was without form and was void there was nothing but just a darkness or chaos he said what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but way into the darkness there without light churnings of the waters that wandering star twisting around and out of orbit it must have been a terrific mass of something lost that just couldn't find his way and he said that's what we become when we are we are wandering stars we're away from god we're without hope and without god there is no hope amen just turning around out in darkness not knowing where we're going but god took that great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a garden of eden amen by his word that's how we are transformed formed by the word of god when god said let there be light that mass of creation out there came over and the sun began to shine upon it began it began to revolve around the sun and it became a garden of eden because it obeyed the word of god it done the perfect will of god in which transformed out of chaos into a garden of eden by the word of god here it was laying in this condition but the bible says the spirit of god began to move and the spirit of god began to move and the word was spoke and said let there be light and when the word was spoke the dynamics was there to bring the word to pass amen the spirit of god in that moment proved it was greater than the darkness that covered the earth it proved it was greater than the nothingness that was there it proved it was greater than the gloom that was there it was greater than the coldness that was upon the earth the light began to dawn upon the earth for the first time and no doubt the gloom and the coldness and the darkness tried to congeal together and tried to bind together to hold its position but it could not because the spirit of god was greater than the darkness amen the light proved in that moment it was greater than darkness and we can you can have just a little portion of light and it'll push back darkness amen every time light shows it's greater than darkness you know this morning when you got up and you looked at the sun do you realize you was looking at the very spoken word of god and it was spoken millions or whatever years ago and it's still hanging in this place today amen shining every morning pushing back the darkness showing you every morning amen the bible said his mercies are new every morning it's showing you every morning i'm still greater than darkness it doesn't matter how bad it is how hard it is how terrible it is i am greater than the darkness amen i am greater than the spirits of the world and the things that are around now we know the time that we're living in especially as it seems like it gets get seemingly gets worse and worse every year and let me just give you a news flash it's going to continue to get worse amen as this world goes out back out into utter chaos and darkness and into the tribulation amen this world and the world systems is not going to get better it's going to get worse the age that we're living in is not going to get better it's going to get worse but every time amen when you see that sun shining it ought to remind you every morning that i'm still greater than the darkness so it does not matter how great the darkness is going to get it does not matter if you can't see your hand in front of your face that s-o-n is still greater than every dark spirit of hell it's still greater than every darkness of this world it can come together you can line every devil up and amen he's going to bring them it's been opened out of the river euphrates and the enemy has pulled satan into this round and it's getting darker and it's getting you every morning i'm still greater than the darkness amen you feel the warmth of this rays as it bathes over you it stands there as a sign proving that the light of god is still greater than any darkness that could ever hold a child of god it's greater than any coldness that could ever get upon you it's greater than any lukewarmness that can ever settle over your spirit it's greater than any gloom any depression any emptiness any nervousness any anxiety it's greater than any spirit of the enemy if you let the spirit of god begin to move the light will begin to shine amen if you let the spirit of god begin to move that's why it's important that the spirit of god is free to move in our midst it's important that we have the atmosphere that the spirit of god can begin to go out and begin to touch hearts and lives because if the spirit of god is there the light's not going to shine or if the spirit of god is not there the light is not going to shine but that spirit begins to move and that word begins to speak and the light begins to drive back the darkness and it'll drive coldness out of lives and bursts can take place and change of hearts can happen and what happens the spirit of the lord begins to move amen begins to break chains off of each and everyone's life he said you know what brother bran would say like this he said i know that each and every one of you you feel like i do i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i hope we don't get past that i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god moving some experiences i just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again what kind of experiences he got to seeing the lightning flash and the thunder rolling and the elk bugling and the wolf howling he said i got beside myself and i began to run and run around round the tree begin to shout praises of god he said oh just to feel that experience again amen the moment that moment when i first got saved it was so glorious in my heart he said but we're coming to a place we can sit and we can see it move among us and we're just drying out we're just drying out we sit here in the desert and he said i get amongst my brethren and they talk to me and i talk with him a little way of watching feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see the condition of that brother to see what's wrong and i feel us reclining i feel us getting away from the spirit and it's become too natural a thing to us we must worship in the spirit we must live in the spirit amen we must amen we must give our everything in the spirit amen what is it it should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame of our hearts it's got to be in our hearts so we can't rightly present it to any other person the spirit has to pack the message he said i'm trusting and believing every one of you to be real christians amen that you believe i need the spirit of god i need him moving in my midst i need him moving in my church i need him moving in my home i need him moving in my life i need him coming and touching me by his grace and mercy it says you may be maybe a cancer has conquered you or something it's taking a hold of you some disease of sin or whatever it is it may look dark and gloomy to you now it may look like you'll never recover it may look like you can't get over that tb or that prostate trouble or that long trouble or whatever it is that tumor that crippled condition the doctor may say every hope is gone but standing right by your side tonight standing right by your side tonight ready to take you into possession stand the eyes of faith who sees the victory to the lord jesus the christ hallelujah away with satan and his gloom and up with the faith of the lord jesus christ the faith of the almighty god faith can take its holy stand on the rock of ages and pierce like an eagle through every stormy cloud when the very waves of death and disappointments trying to wash its foundations remember it can stand and look at the skies and say god is right hallelujah amen if we could ever get you to lift up from that moment that you're in and you can look past all that gloominess and you can look past all those clouds you can look past all that unbelief and say god is right god is right and if he's been right he's still right his word don't change he said let there be light and there's still a sun hanging there how many got up this morning wondering if the sun was going to come up no it wasn't a thought of that you knew what's going to come up hey man i hadn't got up a morning wondering if it's ever gonna come up or worrying about it why you you didn't get up to worrying about it you knew by faith god spoke it it's going to happen amen you can have that same confidence than that same god that spoke that son into existence and is still hanging there to find darkness there's a same guard that said i will heal all thy diseases it's going to happen he's the same god that says you are delivered it's going to happen and just like the sun defies darkness and gloom the word of god is here to defy every devil amen is here to defy sickness it's here to defy depression it's here to defy fear it's here to
