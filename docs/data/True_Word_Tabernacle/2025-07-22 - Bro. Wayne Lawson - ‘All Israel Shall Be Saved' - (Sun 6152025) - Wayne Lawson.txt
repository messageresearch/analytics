That's able to be here and uh would like to say happy father's day to you all and amen to all the the wonderful fathers that are here this morning. And um you know it's a it's a quite a high calling to be a father &gt;&gt; and uh for one that takes it sincere and serious. He becomes a he comes a provider and a redeemer of his own home and a leader and emotional financial. He becomes the backbone of a home as he leads. And uh we we thank God that in this generation of course the real reality of fatherhood has has been taken and it seems like that there's so many that never stepped up to be what they're supposed to be. So, but as brother Brandham said, if it take a bad woman to show a good one, &gt;&gt; and it'll take a bad man to show a good one. But when you have a when you have good men that are solid Christian men leading their families, bringing them to the house of God, providing them a place to be, what a what a cherished thing that is, amen, to to be able to see it. And we want to take a moment to say thank you. And Amen. I I say God bless you for your dedication. Amen. We uh we certainly appreciate the Lord. It's a it's a direct attribute of God to be a father. I love how the Lord's prayer always began. Our father which is in heaven. Amen. What a what a blessing. Amen. Of a fatherhood. Amen. I uh just have a few things on our heart today. And we would like to just before we go to the scripture, maybe we would just go to the Lord in a word of prayer. Amen. And we want to take just a moment and thank the Lord for his fatherhood over our lives. And amen for uh for the grace that he has given us. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we bow our hearts this morning. We thank you for your word Lord. We want to thank you for the word Lord that has birthed children in this age. For the mercy that you have shown us, for the provision that you have given us. Lord we thank you for the care for the for the strength Lord which you have given to this age through your word. Lord we thank you for these heavenly father we thank you for but we thank you for this earthly fatherhood Lord that you have put among us Lord the grace that you have shown these men Lord and their families. We thank you for the many strong and wonderful leaders that you have put here among us Father. We pray that you would strengthen them, Lord. And Father, as we would take your word this morning, we ask that you would come here today, that you would use this service for your glory and your honor. And Lord, we dedicate this moment, Lord, to your word. That you would take it and you would speak to the heart and to the need of your children. For we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you. Amen. If you have your Bibles today, Amen. I'm I'm not going to be so much speaking a Father's Day message today. I I want to I want to take from the book of Romans, the 11th chapter, and I want to read uh Romans 11:25 down to verse 28. Um this will be uh back a little bit in this series of thoughts that we have been under under the revelations contained under the seals. Of course, I was speaking on the opening of the word and and then as the word opened, I just wanted to take some of the revelations that were laying under the seal and speak about those revelations, not so much maybe even in order, but just as they was inspired to me personally. Um in Romans 11 and 25, the Apostle Paul of course writing concerning Israel, he said, "For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest that you would be wise in your own conceits, that the blindness in part is happen to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in." And so Israel So all Israel shall be saved. That's that's a pretty powerful statement. So all Israel shall be saved. As it is written, there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob. And for this is my covenant unto them which I shall take away their sins. And as concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes. but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sake. Amen. We just ask the Lord to bless his word. As you could be seated this morning, if uh I would take a subtitle on this, I want to speak to you today on all Israel shall be saved. All Israel shall be saved. Amen. I I I think it's a powerful reality when you start realizing the sovereignty of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's beyond uh what we could hope or think or as Paul would say it, it's not he that welleleth nor he that runth, but it's God that shows mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we look here this morning at the ideal that all of Israel shall be saved, I say we have to first understand that not all Israel is Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so you recognize that the part of Israel that will be saved is the part that God elected. Just as he elected this bride, he also numbered a a a remnant of the Jews of Israel that would be saved and have their names on the book the same as you do. Amen. And we so we recognize uh that this is uh this statement of Paul that all of Israel should be saved really gains its traction or it becomes enlightened in the end time message. And it's not until the fifth seal that you really see the potency and the power of what Paul is saying. But if you're under the seals here in the end time, you find brother Brandon will speak this in the fifth seal in Revelations chapter 6. I'll read the 9th through the 11th verse concerning this seal. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I was I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God. Now, brother Ram takes a a moment to tell us that they were slain for the word of God. It doesn't say they were slain for the testimony of Jesus Christ as the martyrs of the church was, but these were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And brother said they were Jews. They were they were they were practicing Jews and they never became Christians. and those souls that were under there. He said, "I want you to know that they were not the early church that had been slain as martyrs uh for the gospel because it depicts it was not them." He says, "And for the testimony, and they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, do thou not judge and avenge our blood upon them upon the earth?" And brother Ram said, "Now, here's another key point. This is not bride material." He said because the bride here would not be crying for vengeance but rather her voice would be the voice of mercy. Amen. How many recognize brother said that the bride would not persecute bride or and then he says or anyone else. I I like that. Or anyone else. And when you see an old persecuting spirit or revengeful spirit that's not the spirit of Christ. And and this bride is the lamb's wife. She cries for mercy. Matter of fact, amen. She is the voice of mercy in the end time. Mercy, amen, is in the bride of Jesus Christ as the voice of God. And I could get a little deeper. Y'all know, amen, that you have become the blood of Christ by the spirit. Amen. So, not only are you just a voice, but your very spirit that is in you is the blood of Christ to this earth and to this. And if you don't think that it's powerful that way, I'll say it again this way. Brother Bram said, "When this bride goes off of the earth, Satan will come down." So what what what what's holding Satan off this morning is the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. And she's a voice of mercy. I and and people don't agree with her and she prays for mercy and and and people persecute her and she prays for mercy because she is the voice of mercy. So these people under this altar most certainly were not amen the early church nor are they the bride of Christ. He says and they cried for vengeance and then white robes were given every one of them. And it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season till the fellow servants and their brethren should be killed and they were and they were should be fulfilled. Now this is certainly dealing uh uh brother Brandon will say it. He says if this is not the early church then this is Israel that's got to be saved as a nation. He said all them that are predestinated that's Israel. See that's Israel itself. If this is not the early church, who is it? Brother Bam says it is Israel. Now Israel, all of Israel, he said, will be saved. And now this is according to lection. That God the father has loved them and blinded them that we Gentiles might have a place of repentance. &gt;&gt; That through Abraham and his seeds, he said, all the world according to his word. See how the sovereignty of God is. His words got to be just can't be nothing else. See, God elected us and he also elected the Jews. &gt;&gt; Now, all of Israel shall be saved. And now, the powerful point behind this today is you'll see what God to save his elect. And if he would go through that to save the elect Jew, look also what he does to save that elect bride. He was so intent on saving the elect bride that he purposely and brother Benam say this in six-fold purpose of Daniel's uh Gabriel's visit to Daniel. God blinded them purposely for you and I. They cannot see because God blinded them. &gt;&gt; Amen. God blinded them. Now friends, you you think of this. They were blinded. Brother Bam says that the of course the Israel was blinded. He says, "Until the fullness of the Gentiles come in." So someone says, "Israel is blinded." Those Jews that rejected Christ while he was on the earth doing the signs of the Messiah, fulfilling all prophecies that were spoke of him and fulfilling them to the very letter. And brother Bram said, "And there his own children crucified him." He said, "Because they were blind to it." That's they would have knew him. They would have saw him, but they were blind to it. it. And brother B said, "And that blindness, of course, Paul says it as well. It was happening for you and I." God blinded his own children that you and I might be saved. I'll tell you, brother, I'm going say it like this. Until the fullness of the Gentiles. Paul says, "Until the how long will they remain blind? Until the fullness of the Gentiles come." Now, we know the fullness of the Gentiles is the book of Revelations, the second and third chapter, which is the church ages. so that the blindness of Israel will remain upon them until the bride be taken off of the earth. Now, that's a very powerful thing. That's why that you cannot go over there and convert the Jews. And I know a lot of people's tried it. Amen. But those Jews will not be converted. How many knows Israel will be born in a day? Amen. They they we're not going to go over as a bunch of Gentiles and convert them. Brother Bam said it'll take a prophet. Amen. They're expecting Elijah. It'll take Elijah the prophet. And brother Bham said, "And I started to go over there." Amen. But the angel of the Lord stopped me and said, "It's not time yet." Now, why wasn't it time? Because you and I were yet to come to Christ that God would allow all he's allowed, Amen, to give you a space of repentance. Let me let me just say to you this morning, if you belong to the Lord and your name is on that lamb's book of life, God will hold back judgments. He'll hold back the devil. He'll hold back everything until that bride gets a repentance that he has called for her to have. Look, he said, "I I will not lose one of them." Amen. Do you know that God is so numbered? This bride. Somebody said, "Well, Amen. You might miss the rapture." That that is completely a bad thought concerning the sovereignty of God. He will not lose one. Come on, church. If your name is in that lamb's book of life, he will turn over this earth to get that bride to repent in this last day. Now, I'm not saying he won't allow some things to happen in your life to make you want to repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. They used to preach that old sermon, he'll burn your barley fields. You know, if God's called you, Amen, you're coming. &gt;&gt; They used to say the devil's going to get you. I'll say you this. Jesus is going to get you. If you belong to him, Jesus is going to get you. He'll haunt your dreams. He'll wake you up in the middle of the night. Amen. You can be sitting on a bar stool somewhere and some drunk will ask you about the Lord. Amen. I I probably shouldn't tell it, but some of my first sermons I I preached to a Pentecostal boy over a fifth of whiskey. Amen. Because even when I was in a drunkard stoop, God was still dealing with me. When I was living in sin, God was dealing with me. And listen, I see young people, they act like they don't care nothing about it. I you you can't fool me. I know what's happening on the inside. If there's a seed in there, Amen. There's a reason they act cuz they're trying to cover up what God is really dealing in their life. But God will get you. Amen. This message will get you. This message come to claim a bride and it'll get every last one that belongs to God. This third pull will it will catch every trout that belongs to God. &gt;&gt; I have no doubt that he will get every one of them. And the brother Bam said it's actually numbered. &gt;&gt; And Israel is blinded. See, he blinded his own children. And brother Bam said, see they're standing at the cross and them Jews howling for his blood. That was his own kids. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that was his own kids. And there was the scripture. He was the word and knowing these people have would they would have glad now he's talking about the cross he said they would have gladly received him &gt;&gt; but the reason he blinded them and they wouldn't recognize him is he come in such a humble way blinded them that they wouldn't receive it &gt;&gt; but that scripture said they wouldn't he said he blinded them and Jesus pied them even so much She said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing." &gt;&gt; He blinded them. Brother Bam said, "Now, watch that real close." He said, "They were given white robes." Now, you you see why the scripture says that those under the altar were martyrs. Now, these were not, as we preached the other day, heaven's real. If you were here, I talked a lot about the white robed ones in the 60 mansion. But in the fifth seal, Brother Bam will deterior uh deliberate or he will divide the altars in heaven and he'll tell you about two different altars. He'll tell you about an altars of the martyrs and then an altar of sacrifice. Now the gentile bride received the blood of Jesus Christ. So in that sixth dimension they're laying under the altar of sacrifice already in white robes. Amen. But these had to be given white robes. So, they're under the altar of a martyr rather than the altar of sacrifice, having accepted Jesus. But watch, but they are not lost even though they didn't receive the blood of Christ. He had an altar to put them under because they were blinded for you and I's sake. So, when this is all done, he said, "I give them white robes." He would give them grace. Now, you say, "Preacher, that's awful. That's awful. Uh, that's awful. Reaching out there that they didn't even have a new birth, but they're going to receive an inheritance of a white robe. Oh, yes. Yes. We're talking about the grace of God. I don't know if we yet have been able to fathom the grace of God. But this scripture ought to really show us the grace of the God that you're serving. These people rejected Christ. They killed him. They they rejected the gospel. They burned the Bibles. They want nothing to do with what we call Christianity. But they gave their lives because they were blinded to what you believe. But when it's all done, God said, "Here you is a white robe that you would be able to enter in just like you received it because we're talking about the grace of God." &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, we want Bible for it." I'm glad you asked. There's a story in the Bible of a man named Joseph. Do you know which is almost a quarter of the Old Testament? Amen. Well, it's almost a quarter of the Old Testament is the book of Joseph. I think it states starts around Genesis 37 and goes to the end of the book of Genesis. And right in the middle of it, it's amazing because it starts and then in Genesis 38, you find here comes Tamar and Judah. Amen. Now, why would God inject these little stories in the middle of Joseph? Because he's talking about the preservation of the seed of Judah. &gt;&gt; Tamar presume pres actually actually preserves the seed of Judah. And and look at what God does to get the seed preserved. Amen. Look at the desperation of Tamar showing you that God is going to have a seed even if he had to cause Tamar to do things which is not understandable to us. Amen. But when Judah saw what she did, Amen. Just in case somebody's here don't know the story of Tamar, let me tell it real quick. I'll tell the quick version of it. Amen. Y'all remember that Judah, Amen, he had to have sons cuz the Bible said that the lawgiver would come out of Judah. the Messiah would come out of Judah. &gt;&gt; It was a it was a king lying Judah. And we find that that he wasn't able to have any. Remember his sons kept dying and his daughter-in-laws went without seed &gt;&gt; and and there was one who had been put in widowhood named Tamar. And they put her away and said, "No, I don't have any more sons for you." And they put her away. But when she got to thinking about this, she put on a dress of harlotry and sat by the whale and sold herself to Judah, which was her father-in-law. &gt;&gt; Which seems crazy, but it was desperation working in her to preserve that seed. &gt;&gt; And when he went into her, remember, Amen. He says, "I don't have any money." She said, "Well, I'll take your token of your ring and your staff." Remember that? And then when he sent a kid by somebody else to go pay, the woman had disappeared with his staff and with his ring. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there she was and somebody comes and says, "Judah, your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the part of a harlot and she's with child. We're going to have to burn her as a as a harlot. Remember?" And he went to pass judgment on her. And when judgment started to come to her, she pulled out a token &gt;&gt; and said, "The thing that is in me belongs to you." And he said, "You're more righteous than I am righteous because she proved the seed that was in her was the seed of the line of Judah." &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God. That's exactly when you see what seed is in you, there's a token that no matter how you come to him, Amen. There's a token laying there. This is my seat. All Israel shall &gt;&gt; be saved. That's right. and she saved that whole line. &gt;&gt; And look at how Judah brings it. And then we see Joseph come into the scriptures and and God sovereignly knew there was a famine coming to the land. &gt;&gt; And Joseph comes up, which is only a prophecy. You know, some prophecies are not written, they're lived, right? &gt;&gt; And Joseph lived the prophecy. Matter of fact, if you interpret the life of Joseph, you don't you you can't interpret Joseph's life until Jesus Christ. Right. &gt;&gt; There there is nothing. Amen. You make sense of all of it without Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right. Because there's certain things that happen in your life. It takes it takes Christ to interpret. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'll just take this on a on a on a level of this basis for us as as believers. There's nothing that happens in your life that it will take God to interpret to come out right. I tell you what, let a tragedy happen in one of your homes and let the devil interpret it and see how you come out. &gt;&gt; God don't love you. God don't answer prayer. God don't keep us covenants. These prayers don't work. Amen. Healing's not for real. Why did this happen to me? All of that comes from the voice of the devil. Listen, your God is right. &gt;&gt; In every decision, he's right and he is faithful and he is true and he has never forsaken you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Nay, in all things we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus who loved us. If God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? And the Bible said this very clearly that all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose. But you know what you're going to have to have? You're going to have to have an interpreter. &gt;&gt; Because if the devil interprets, look what he done for Eve. &gt;&gt; The word means this, then look what it happened. She got pulled out of Eden. And the moment you let the devil start messing with your mind, you're coming out of Eden. &gt;&gt; You're coming out of peace into into anxiety. You're coming out of joy and you're dropping down into depressions and mlly grubs and Amen. But you one time let the scripture interpret your situation and you'll see that you're going through something for your character. &gt;&gt; Come on. Look at it from God's point of view just for a moment. &gt;&gt; Look at it from God's point of view for a moment. Character is what is required to rule. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother man makes it very clear power without character is satanic. &gt;&gt; So look at the power God is giving you as a church. If there was no character molding trials to come with the power that was given then the church would rather than be holy. &gt;&gt; Power without character is satanic. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But power with character fit the rule. Problem is character is not a gift. It's a victory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a victory over every trial. So when character comes, you say, "Preacher, why does the church suffer? Why does family suffer? Why does things suffer?" I'll tell you why they suffer. Because Revelations the 20th chapter says that you have a throne setting in the millennium and you are the kings of the earth that is coming into pass. This is kings. He is the king of &gt;&gt; kings &gt;&gt; rulers sitting here. So there must be a vision. Now you're you're learning from Joseph's life. There must be a vision of leadership to suffer the trial with integrity. &gt;&gt; There must be an understanding with purpose. We come to it with purpose. &gt;&gt; See? See it happens with purpose. All things work together for the good of them. So whatever comes your way, watch this. If you let God, if you let God interpret it, but put it that way. So, watch what Joseph does. Interpret his life by Christ and see uh you know, he he's born of his father. He's loved of his father. He's given a robe. Now, if you take that to Jesus, he was born of the father. He was given the favor of the father. He was loved of the father. He's given the covenant of the father. Do you see? And because that it said he would be the Messiah, he's rejected of his brethren. &gt;&gt; Right. That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was shown a vision of leadership &gt;&gt; and Joseph told it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So his brothers started hating him and then he went to his mom and dad and told them the story and they started hating him. &gt;&gt; And then they sold him &gt;&gt; for silver the same as Jesus was sold for silver. &gt;&gt; And he was thrown in a pit just like Jesus was thrown in a pit. &gt;&gt; And look and they took the blood of an animal and put it on his garment and said that he was dead. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they took Jesus, the blood of Jesus from Calvary was put on the covenant of the rainbow. &gt;&gt; And everyone said he was dead. &gt;&gt; But he wasn't dead. &gt;&gt; He had resurrected &gt;&gt; and he was come to be the Lord of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Do you see the life of Jesus Christ specifically interprets Joseph's life and his coming to a throne? Now, when he got to the throne, he wasn't bitter. But when his brethren came to him and realized, "We did this to you." What did he say? &gt;&gt; No, you meant it for evil, but God meant it for good. &gt;&gt; Look what he done. He flipped the script on them. &gt;&gt; We are not going to have a fight here. Look, you did it for evil, but God did it for good. &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you do to a believer. You throw anything you got at a believer, and God will make it turn out good. Everything that comes in a believer, God will make it turn to the good. &gt;&gt; It'll come out to the good every time. &gt;&gt; And and look and look what he done. He he he turned it right there and said, "God did this to preserve life." &gt;&gt; And brother said, "There it is." See, he gave them grace at the end. He said, "And there it is. Jesus giving grace to Israel at the end." You see, it's a beautiful type in Joseph. What is it? Even Joseph, Amen. And you say, "Well, what was he what was he rejected for? Why did he go there?" Brother B brings it out of the scripture and he said he did it so he could take a gentile wife. &gt;&gt; According to the book of Acts, remember the disciples are arguing over whether the gospel are to go to the Gentiles. And they then began to bring up the prophecies in Amos and said that he would take a people for his name's sake and rebuild again the tabernacle of David. and and and it was then that they knew that it would be a people for the name's sake. Now watch the difference between the gentile and the Jew is a gentile is saved as an individual. The Jew is saved as a nation. &gt;&gt; So when he says a people for his name, he's speaking of individual people who become carrying the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now we don't have a name written on us of man which is 666 or denominational word. But you've had another name written on you, which is the word of God of the age, and you take the name, the manifested word of your age. You take the name. I don't have time to preach on that, but but I'll just say it. It's the gentile. While he's rejected, he takes a gentile wife. And you see perfectly that that was the rejection of Christ and he took a gentile wife. So this was a blindness that come upon Israel just as a blindness had come upon the brethren of Joseph but it was only for a season. &gt;&gt; Now that's important uh that we that we realize it's only for a season. &gt;&gt; Now watch how he says brother Bman questions and answers. He says now watch he said he said now somewhere back there he said when they shall be cast out doesn't that mean that they'll be cast out of God's mind? He said they are brother Bram said but see they are cast out of spiritual benefits for a season &gt;&gt; just a little season &gt;&gt; because what the prophet saw he said Israel he says it will be Israel see when God blinded them and God allowed the rejection of Christ it's just for a season. So, so there's many ask the question, will Israel be forgotten? See, he's taken out of the out of out of out of out of the blessings, &gt;&gt; but not out of the mind of God. &gt;&gt; See, not cast out of the mind. So then you say, "Is Israel forgotten?" No, Israel is not forgotten. I I I think of the beauty of the scripture. If you pull me up Isaiah 49, let's go 13 to verse 16. Amen. Amen. I I thank you all for being uh wise virgins this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing, O heavens. You'll get it tomorrow. Yeah. Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, &gt;&gt; and break forth into singing, O mountains, for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but Zion hath said, "The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me." And here's Isaiah's answer. Can a woman forget her suckling child? &gt;&gt; That she should not have compassion on her son of her womb? Yay, they may forget, but I will not forget thee. &gt;&gt; I will not forget thee. I think that's one of the greatest words ever spoken. I will not forget thee. Here is God telling Israel, I cannot forget you. &gt;&gt; Look, God cannot forget this church. He and brother Ram said he even had it graven on the palms of his hand. Do you know that Jesus even died for those that were rejecting him? Those white robes that he gives out comes from the grace that come from the blood of Jesus Christ at the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see? Somebody said, "Well, has God forgotten his people?" But I want you to know something. God never forgets Israel. God has never forgotten Israel. Somebody said, "Well, why did they go through this and why did they go through that?" It would only be for a season. It would only be a season that God would take them out of their benefits. But even in that season, there was a purpose. And that purpose was there would be a gentile bride. I love how Paul says it in Romans 11 and verse one. I say then, hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I am an Israelite, even the seed of Abraham and the tribe of Judah. God hath not cast away his people, which he forneew. What not? The scripture saith, Elias, how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed the prophets. They have dig down thine altars, and I am a left. Look at a prophet speaking about the trouble in Israel. And even Paul says it like this. But God had to answer him and said, "I've reserved myself 7,000 men who have not bowed an E to to Baal." And even though at this present time, there is a remnant according to the election of grace. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Amen. There's Elijah telling God, "They're all doing it. They're all doing. Look at all the thing. There ain't nobody left." And God then, Brother Bam said, he broke open the book and let and let Elijah see it that there was a remnant that he reserved that should be saved. And there is, I don't care what you see, Israel, it doesn't matter what it looks like, Christ rejecting, you think there's no hope for them. But I'll say this, in this last day, we have received an eagle from God. And that eagle has rose up into the mind of God and said, "Yeah, it's still there. Israel is still in the mind of God. I don't know what it looks like to you, but Israel is still in the mind of God." Oh, that ought to set this bride on fire to know that if God can let a bride Amen. let Israel do all of that, go through all that, act all that way and then still put a prophet on the scene to say to this gentile bride. Somebody said, "Well, then why did Luther say such bad things?" I'll tell you why. Because he was a reformer. He wasn't a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a reformer, not a prophet. But a prophet could never &gt;&gt; say that God had forgotten Israel because God would show him immediately that there is Israel. They're cast out. I love how Brother Bam says cast out but not out of his mind. &gt;&gt; You said, "Preacher, why are you excited?" But I'll tell you this as a gentile people cuz there's been times in your life you was out. &gt;&gt; You was out of benefits because of your sin and your trouble. Amen. And but listen, you might have been out of blessings. You might have been out of benefits as a as somebody out here in the world, but you never been out of the mind of God. You was on his mind. Amen. When his own children were rejecting him of the cross. &gt;&gt; There was something on his mind then. And he still has that in his mind now. I thank God. Amen. That God is not like a man that he is absent minded. Listen, he has never forgot you. He has never forgot this bride. Amen. You cannot be out of his mind. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Israel didn't close their eyes. &gt;&gt; They were blinded. &gt;&gt; Blinded because of us. &gt;&gt; The charge was before Calvary. &gt;&gt; The charge was before Calvary. &gt;&gt; Now, seasons. Let's just talk about seasons. Sister Satie, it's it's been a season. We have been so blessed to have you with us. &gt;&gt; It's been it's been a real blessing. Brother Tim introduced to us to her a few weeks ago and the Smalls have been bringing her over and I think brother John's got him a new granddaughter. He has took her responsibility for her and but she's going to have to be moving on to Missouri. It's a season, &gt;&gt; move on with her family. Now, if that season gets over you, come on back, okay? We'll we'll get you a seat. But there but there's seasons &gt;&gt; and there's purpose in those seasons. Now now I I I'll just say you remember as as we look back in history, Abraham before they ever went into the promised land was told that his children would be there only for a time and then they were going to be carried into Egypt for 400 years. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; but at that they would come an end to that 400 years and God would send a deliverer. Yeah, &gt;&gt; those same ones that God sent a deliverer and brought out began to sin again. &gt;&gt; And God then raised up a man named uh uh Nebuchadnezzar and sent Jeremiah among them &gt;&gt; and said that Nebuchadnezzar is going to tear down the temple and he's going to carry off a bunch of you into Babylon. And Jeremiah prophesied and said it'll be 70 years before you return. Now there was a lot of other people said a lot of things but Jeremiah was a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that he says 70 years. Now if you're looking uh of course that's Jeremiah chapter 25 and we find that this is the prophecies that Daniel is reading when he is coming to the end of the captivity. So 70 years they've been down in captivity and Daniel's been among them and he's been lifted up among the among them and he's he's been there in Babylon. And when it's about 68 years, there's about two years left of desperation starts really striking the heart of Daniel that it's the time, the season is changing. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bam preaches a message. You remember he preaches token and then preaches desperations. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam talks about desperation coming a couple different ways. And he said one thing that causes desperation is tragedy. He said, "But another thing that causes desperation is revelation." &gt;&gt; And the desperation that had fell upon Daniel was that he had read the scriptures and knew that the time and season was changing. &gt;&gt; He knew that the prophesied years of Jeremiah was coming to pass. And if you like Gabriel's instruction uh to Daniel, brother Bam said that's why Gabriel came to Daniel was to instruct him because he was in prayer and fasting concerning the things which he had been reading in the book. He he was reading books, you know, and desperation came from what he was reading. I I I could take a few minutes here. I don't think we will. I'll just say this, brother Bam, in in in Gabel's instruction, he goes into the end time prophecies and he begins to say, I understand by the book &gt;&gt; and he starts laying out things that were happening and how that it ought to anoint our faith to know that the season has arrived that changes is upon us. I understand when you start understanding the things that are happen supposed to happen that day then you see it then you know the season is changing. Now in the book of Daniel Daniel in the ninth chapter he then actually sees amen not only that the 70 years are finishing. So let me just put this in quick chronology that the children of Israel have returned from Egypt and they're living in Israel. They built up their temple. They're living in Jerusalem. They fall into sin. They separate into Israel and Judah. And then Nebuchadnezzar comes in, destroys their temple, and packs them all off under prophecy of Jeremiah. And they stay down there for 70 years. And at the end of that 70 years, Daniel's praying, realizing that we're fisting to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. And God begins to show him that this is the season. But then he sends Gabriel to him and begins to instruct him on six different reasons that they will have 70 weeks. So you see a period of time. God names it with them 400 years. Was God right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God says 70 years. And was God right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God names the season. Now, that same God that had just hit two out of two says to Daniel, "I'm going to give your people 70 weeks." &gt;&gt; Now, don't go don't go to sleep on 70 weeks for me, okay? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stay long here. &gt;&gt; 70 weeks are prophetic weeks. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a lot of calendars, right? There's the astrology calendar, Julian calendar, the Roman calendar. Well, there's also the prophetic calendar. How many ever seen a Jewish calendar? &gt;&gt; They, you know, they run two different calendars, right? There's a prophetic which names their feast and it it runs from the moon and it's a 360day calendar, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, in 360day calendars, each week represents seven years. &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about uh was it 490 years that God gives them? And brother Bram says, "Watch when when he gave them those weeks, he actually detail details exactly how many weeks from the rebuilding of the walls until the coming of the Messiah." So just as now think of this, just as God gives, he gives times. He gives seasons. &gt;&gt; He gives them 70 weeks. He actually prophesies to them 490 years. Now, this is from the time that they rebuild it all the way to the Messiah. Now, think of this because as a church age, when Jesus comes, remember Jerusalem is destroyed again. And Jesus says that Jerusalem will remain trotten down until the until the time of the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; right? And he calls it the times of the Gentile. Amen. And and then so then we recognize that's dealing with Daniel's prophecies. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's dealing with Daniel's prophecies. And Jesus then is actually determining as the Messiah that he is marking a certain part within them weeks. But after Jesus, watch, they were blinded to make room for the Gentiles &gt;&gt; because Paul says they would until the fullness of the Gentiles, not the time of the Gentiles, the fullness of the Gentiles would come in. So, so the 70 weeks that God promises to Israel is stopped at the Messiah &gt;&gt; because they become blinded and then your church age becomes in. And then God gives an opportunity to all of the gentile churches to be saved and he gives a door, an opening, an utterance for them that they might come in. Now, now we can measure that. And just as brother Brandon would say, watch Israel is your time clock. Well, do you know the Gentile is Israel's time clock? But when when you look at the Gentiles from the book of Revelations, the first couple chapters, you will see quickly in Revelations 1, that he has seven stars in his hand. Remember the Lord appears seven stars in his right hand and seven golden candlesticks. And the mystery of those stars are they the seven angels to the seven churches. Now before there was calendars, there was stars. So the Gentiles told their time by the stars. &gt;&gt; So we seen the first age of Paul and we seen how the stars come out of the hand of God. How the time click of prophecy was just being poured out in the ages and we called it the times of the Gentiles and we're waiting for the fullness of the Gentiles. But when that seventh angel begins to sound, that brings a fullness unto the Gentile age and it fulfills the scriptures concerning the Gentiles. Amen. So, watch what you're doing. You're living in the season that God said to his Israel people, I have some time left for you, but it can't start until this bride's out of the way. Right? &gt;&gt; See, God has made a promise to the Jew that he will give them another three and a half weeks that he made promise, but he'll never give them that weeks until this bride is out of the way. Now, go right back to the story of Joseph and see if Joseph didn't have a gentile bride and he kept that bride with him, but he never would reveal himself to his brethren. As long as that bride was sitting there, he only spoke to them in Egyptian. They did not know who he was. Though he was there, they didn't know. But the moment that gentile was moved from the fellowship to the palace, he then began to reveal himself to those Jews. Do you see that God will not forgive them Jews and you're the only thing between him and those Jews. So don't you ever for a moment think that God cannot take care of this gentile bride. Everything that you need for a rapture has already been brought in this message. We're not waiting for a messenger. We're not waiting for another leader. We've got a message from God, a rapturing message from God, a vindication from God. Because that's what the Jews were waiting on was this bride to be saved and carried into a rapture. &gt;&gt; The whole thing is hinging on you. the seventh angel released that star and the message then come into the earth which opened a prophetic age. &gt;&gt; Now if you're a if you're a a student of of scripture, you know the Bible predicts this that there would be 70 weeks. Now how many knows that he also says that the last week would be cut in half. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said and the Messiah shall be cut off in the middle of the week. Now that cut off in the middle of the week, how that's three and a half days. &gt;&gt; And how long was Jesus's ministry? &gt;&gt; Three and a half years. &gt;&gt; Jesus never went to the Gentiles &gt;&gt; when he was here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go not unto the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; but to the lost sheep of Israel." That's right. &gt;&gt; So his ministry was only to Israel in those three and a half years. &gt;&gt; They are owed another three and one half years &gt;&gt; in scripture. Now let's watch the seasons. These seasons of course has an objective and it's found in the six-fold purpose of of Gabriel's visit to Daniel. You might go listen to the whole tape. I don't want to put you to sleep. Now, Daniel's 70 weeks, amen, are speaking of a division of of of first and seven weeks and then 62 weeks and then &gt;&gt; and then the last half is what we're looking at today. &gt;&gt; Now, if you put 360 days in a prophetic calendar, Brother Bam specifically says there's three and a half years left to the Jews. The messianic doctrine of the Jews, there is still three and a half weeks determined. Uh, brother Brown, I'm going to say it again. In the fifth seal, the second half of the 70th week, remember Messiah was cut off in the middle of the week. That's the middle. Well, half of seven is three and a half. How long did Christ preach? See, there is determined another three and a half years. &gt;&gt; Now, you wonder why I'm taking time to read this because some people honestly believe there's seven years left. &gt;&gt; And prior to the seals, Brother Bradom alludes to that. Right? &gt;&gt; But you'll see the correction here in the fifth seal. And the reason you'll see it, you watch this. Watch this. Watch the correction come scripturally. He'll say, "Now I give each of you a robe." Now go back to Revelation 6 and see what he said when he given them white robes. What did they say? How long, Lord? &gt;&gt; How long? And he said, "For a season, &gt;&gt; there yet remains a bit of a season." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this season was how long? Amen. Now, if you turn with me to Revelations 11, watch the scripture. The season. Now, there's to be a season &gt;&gt; because there is an elect Jew left on the earth after the fullness of the Gentiles. Uh, Revelation 11, I believe that's about the second and third verse. Uh, yeah, here it is in third verse. And I will give you power unto my two witnesses. Now, how many knows who them two witnesses are? &gt;&gt; That's Moses and Elijah. That's not the fourth ministry of Moses. Elijah, it's the fifth ministry of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy how long? A thousand, 200, and three score days? &gt;&gt; Three and one half years. The season that is speaking of in the fifth seal is making room for these two witnesses to preach the gospel in Israel. &gt;&gt; Now, isn't it amazing that the Bible is telling us after all of these years that when the fullness of the Gentiles come in that God is going to send two prophets to preach in Israel? Amen. According to Revelations the 7th chapter, they're going to preach in Israel. Now, somebody wants what's what's their message going to be, Brother Wayne? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? What are they going to preach? &gt;&gt; What is those Jews going to preach over there? Moses and Elijah, what are they going to say? Go to Revelations chapter 7 with me. I'm watching the first four verses. Now, see, God could not allow the earth to be destroyed. He couldn't allow the end of the earth because those Jews. &gt;&gt; Do you see? And he can't get to those Jews until he moves you. So when the devil wakes you up in the middle of night and says you miss the rapture, say you lying, devil. &gt;&gt; Watch Revelation 7. And these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that they should not blow on earth, nor the sea, nor in any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. Now what's the seal of the living God? according to Ephesians 4, it is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them, and they were 144,000, the tribes of Israel." Now, watch this, Brother Brand. I'm going show you quickly that these these is directly tied to the three woes, right? because we're talking about three world wars. When the first world war opened and I I won't take a history, but let's just make statements. Do you know when the first world war it was the first time the whole world went to war? And think about the great war that struck. And and and you you historians know that on the 11th day of the 11th month &gt;&gt; that all of a sudden at 11:00 in the morning, &gt;&gt; the war stopped. &gt;&gt; And they still do not know who said peace. &gt;&gt; But if you read the Bible, you'll know exactly who said stop. The one that had the seal of the living God said, "Hold your peace until these 144,000 have been sealed." &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Watch it." He said, "11th hour of the day, the 11th month." What's it saying? That 11th hour people is going to get the same pay that that first hour people got. You see, God is going to give the Holy Ghost to 144,000 Jews. What is these two witnesses going to preach? They're going to preach the same message that you and I are preaching this morning. There is not another gospel. There is not another gospel than the power of the life of Jesus Christ. Somebody said, "But what about the seventh seal?" What is the seventh seal? It is the literal life of almighty God returning to the earth. And that same life, that same grace is going to go over there to those Jews. My there's 144,000 of them that is to be sealed right there. Amen. For the purpose to bring 144,000 in under tribulation. Now, I say it's a very powerful thing. Now, it's 11th hour. It's God's own way of getting them. And as soon as this church, this bride is taken up in the mystery of the seventh seal. We we'll get to these mysteries of the seventh seal, but let me just put it very clearly. Y'all know what opened the seventh seal? Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; The fourth coming of Elijah. it the the cension of the mighty angel is the opening of the seventh seal. And it's real important you see that sir &gt;&gt; because if you can see the seventh seal, it's the mystery of her going. The Jews is called by the mystery of the seventh trumpet &gt;&gt; which is two prophets. You see what he said? What opens the sixth seal is the two prophets. There are two men. Their ministry opens the sixth seal. The same as the seventh angel's ministry opens the seventh seal. Oh, church of the living God. The same thing the trumpets are to Israel, the seals are to this bride. God has opened the door to bring this bride home. This message has called you out. Listen, it's not an accident that in 1948 when Israel is becoming a nation that a prophet is being visited by an angel. It's not an accident that the world went to war at the same time and God gave grace that there might be a hold and instead of destroying Israel in the middle of the world. Listen, what did what what did Iman and Hitler have on their mind? We'll totally eradicate the Jew. &gt;&gt; But what happened? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Jew after 2,000 years was given a nation of its own. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what the devil tried to do to destroy them, God said, "You can't destroy them." &gt;&gt; I made a promise to them. And in the middle of that great destruction, God raised up Israel and put them in a place and gave them borders and gave them a flag and gave them an army. And right now, they're roaring like a lion. Amen. Because there will be no destruction of Israel until 144,000 are saved. Russia, you got to hear me. Iran, you're going to have to hear me. There will be nothing destroy Israel because there's a promise over them. Oh, church of the living God. If he made that kind of promise to Israel, what about this bride? There ain't no devil. There ain't no power. There ain't nothing that can take her. You say, "I'm going through a trial. It's just for a season, but God made a promise. It'll be a short one." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah to God. Do you see these prophets are coming out under these trumpets? &gt;&gt; When you read your Bible and and you're seeing that sixth trumpet, how many read about it &gt;&gt; when the sixth trumpet and the river Euphrates is opened up &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden 200,000,000 horsemen come riding out of there and there and boy, if you read the scripture, man tells you about the Chargers and how the Brother man said, "Oh, there's not 200,000 horsemen in the world today." &gt;&gt; He said, "These are demons." That's right. &gt;&gt; He said that have been bound up. These are the same demons that destroyed Jerusalem under Titus back there when Rome crushed the city of Jerusalem. And they rose up and they tried to destroy Israel again. And they manifested under the anointings of Ikeman and Hitler. Amen. And Stalin. And look what they was doing. But instead of destroying Israel, they were pushing them back. See, because Israel had gotten where they didn't want to go. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to go home. &gt;&gt; They were comfortable in Russia and they were comfortable in Germany and and Italy and they had started settling down. &gt;&gt; But God said, "There's a promise over your life. &gt;&gt; You won't be able to settle there." &gt;&gt; Can Can you hear me, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't the Russians that went back to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. It wasn't the Italians that went back to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; There might have been some mixed blood, but oh no, sir. It was the Jew that returned. &gt;&gt; Do you see what that is? It's not just anybody comes to the homeland of this message. &gt;&gt; It's to them that have theophony. &gt;&gt; Do you see? You might have a human blood and you might be mixed up with some kind of a Irish or Italian or amen some kind of a English or whatever you're mixed in. But I'll say this, before that was there, that was a theophony. And this message didn't come to push you. It come to pull you. There's a third pull pulling this bride back into the homeland. I hear the call of an eagle. There's a season of redemption upon the church. &gt;&gt; And let me say this. When you hear the voice of this eagle, nothing will hold you. &gt;&gt; No. No. Come on. The Amish ain't got a chance once you hear this. &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of you, hey, they we we we we we sometimes nickname it ex Amish. But I'm going to say very clearly, not ex Amish cuz you never were really Amish. You always was a child of God. And that old Amish devil tried to put its hooks in you. But God said, "Not this one. It belongs to me." And he broke the bonds and brought them here. They're sitting here this morning. Amen. Not identified in the Amish. Identified in the presence of God. I know some of the Amish, they try to come out and they stay under the traditions and all that nonsense. I say come out of it if you're going to come out. Come out into the free land. Drop every fake every tie. If you was a Baptist, forget your Baptist. If you were a church of Christ, forget your church of Christ. We were sons before we were on this earth. And when this is all done, we'll still be sons. Hallelujah. I hear the call. Come out over my people. &gt;&gt; This angel of the Lord has called the people back to the genuine atonement of the word of God. Not a bunch of Pentecostal traditions. Not a bunch of nonsense and religiosity. I'm so sick of religion. I'm so sick of traditions and ideas and man-made doctrines. Amen. Forget all of it. We've got a word from heaven and it's my identity and there's a revival in it for every believer in the church of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You see under that sixth trumpet when those when those demons started coming out after those they they were natural demons &gt;&gt; and they were being manifested in shooting and gassing and killing and &gt;&gt; and brother Bham said but now I didn't preach those trumpets because I already preached them supernaturally &gt;&gt; in the seals &gt;&gt; and he didn't even know it. until 1964 feast of trumpets. &gt;&gt; So you say, "Preacher, so you see what's where there's a corner that was turned &gt;&gt; and brother Bam began to say to you things and begin to let you understand that his ministry of Revelations 10 was calling you back. &gt;&gt; We're not going to have another sacrifice. &gt;&gt; He's calling you back to the original sacrifice. Do do you see then the same demons that attack them Jews is spiritually attacking you? &gt;&gt; And you say, "Brother Wayne, why am I such a battle?" Listen, I tell you, there's only one safe place. &gt;&gt; Why is my mind a roar? Cuz there's 200,000,000 demons trying to destroy you. &gt;&gt; Every gun in hell is pointed at you. Every devil has crawled up out of hell and they're looking for a member of that bride to try to pull down. But brother Bam said, "Don't worry." He said, "If all of hell is against you," he said, "And all of heaven is for you. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee there is more of us than there is them. I can count their devils. You can't count my angels." Paul said it. He said, "You have come unto the unnumberable company of angels. You cannot put a number on the amount of angels that come about me. We are encamped by a host of angels. Uncountable number of God's angels that are here in this building this morning. I I know. Amen. Some people don't like it, but I'll just say it very clearly. There's an angel in this church. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord. You say, "How do you know?" Because he always accompanies his message. Hallelujah. That same pillar of fire that led the children of Israel is right here in this building this morning. leading us into the conquering power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's under that sixth trumpet. But the seventh trumpet opens under them two prophets and three and a half years is given back to them Jews. But brother Ma'am said, notice three prophets come out right there. He said one to the Gentile and two to the Jews. Now you know that the son of man once the dispensation changes it don't go back to son of god. &gt;&gt; Come on church. It never returns to son of god. It remains prophetic from now to the time of the millennial kingdom. You are a prophetic people. We are not prophets but we are the fulfillment of a prophet's prophecy. We have rose up out of the scriptures. We have rose up out of the denominations and the graves of tradition to stand &gt;&gt; as a mighty army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, do you see when you look at this? Brother man said, "Do you see them trumpets sounded under that sixth seal?" And I've done preached it supernaturally. &gt;&gt; I've done preached it supernaturally. What is it? It was to rush them Jews back to their homeland. See, a season is coming. &gt;&gt; Watch in Hosea chapter 6. This is a sermon recognizing your day and his message. &gt;&gt; Hosea 6 and verse one. Come and let us return unto the Lord &gt;&gt; for he hath torn &gt;&gt; and he will heal us. &gt;&gt; For he hath smitten, but he will bind us up. He's talking to the Jews. &gt;&gt; And after two days, he will revive us. and in the third day &gt;&gt; he will raise us up and we shall live &gt;&gt; in his sight. &gt;&gt; Now, brother M said that was written over 2,700 years ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you see that's not the Gentile? &gt;&gt; That's the Jew." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Look, they're already gathered." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, how should she be born in a day if she had to be gathered? But all this while while this Joseph's wife is still with him, he's been putting the brethren over there in Israel, &gt;&gt; waiting for their revival. &gt;&gt; Nation could be born in a day. Look, look, look at the grace of God. Return to the Lord. Now, if you're if you like to study Brother Bram's approaches, it's pretty amazing because when he gets in this recognizing your day, he tells the vision of the bride. How many ever heard him tell it? The preview and he talks about the bride goes down perfect bride and he said then they start coming and he said they fall off this way and they fall off this way and they fall off. He said but when it comes to that last bride remember brother Bam said I saw that lay oysanian church. &gt;&gt; Remember that one &gt;&gt; and she was under that boogie woogie and naked &gt;&gt; wearing a gray plastic material. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said I never thought of it till just now. miserable, blind, wretched, naked. Leodysa, &gt;&gt; he said that Le Oysa bride boogie woogie and twisting the rocket. Brother Bam said naked. He said it was a horrible scene. And in the presence of the angel, brother Bram saw it. He said, "I become so ashamed." &gt;&gt; He said, "Is this all I could produce?" &gt;&gt; With this great message, this is all I could produce. He said, "Then I heard that music &gt;&gt; and he said, I said, "Oh, there's going to be a bride." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I looked up and he said that first bride that had went down was coming back again now." And he said, "Here she come." Remember, she was dressed now, not Jewish. She was in all of the nations of the earth. Brother said, "Dressed in her national garb. And here she come." He said, "Walking right to that beat." And he, boy, you talk about a prophet. And brother brother Kyle now we we got a real prophet because when he sees that vision remember somebody in the back started started getting out of line a little bit and brother Bram corrects his own vision. &gt;&gt; Get back in line. &gt;&gt; He knew that would be a perfect bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see that? He didn't say she wasn't bride. He said get back in line. &gt;&gt; If you if you get to fooling around with something and you realize it, you get a little out of step. I already heard him say it. Get back in line. He's talking to people that's already been in line. He's talking to people that's already been lined up. They're already under a message, but somebody got you a little get you a little idea here and a little idea there. Somebody said, "Brother Brand wasn't right here or there." Brother Ram said that out of line was they was doubting me. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? Amen. Somebody said, "Well, can somebody come back from that?" You bet you they can. &gt;&gt; You bet you they can. You say, "There's no way." You don't know the grace that what I'm talking about yet. You say, "Well, they blasphemed the Holy Ghost." I agree that's blasphemy. But does God mark it? That's the question. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that's blasphemy." I agree it's blasphemy. I agree. But do you know a true believer cannot blasphe? &gt;&gt; I got scripture I can stack on your head for a week, but let me give you the best one I got. He that is born of God cannot commit sin. for he cannot sin because the seed of God remainth in him. I want scripture. I'm glad you asked. What about you, Apostle Paul? How would Paul ever make it if that was the case? But Paul was a gene seed of almighty God. And while he was speaking against the blood and speaking against Jesus Christ, there was a seed inside of him. And when the pillar of fire came, it removed all of the doubt and all of the sin and called him back to God. What about you, doubting Peter? What about you? &gt;&gt; Stripped all your clothes off and went fishing, cussed out somebody so you wouldn't have to be identified with this crucified Christ. But the minute he resurrected, he looked around and saw the brethren. And he said, "Where's Peter? Somebody go get Peter." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he had not forgotten him. And he ain't forgotten you and he ain't forgotten Israel. [Music] So, wow. I tell you, &gt;&gt; it's recorded in scripture. It's real. It's it's it's scripturally. It's not. Brother Bram is a scriptural prophet, folks. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's a scriptural prophet. &gt;&gt; You read Revelation 7. You You You do me a favor. When you get home, read it. And I want you to notice that there are 144,000 brought out of 12 tribes. And he names every tribe. But if you're a Bible reader, you know that two of them tribes is wrong. &gt;&gt; Two of them tribes have been taken out and two more have been put in. &gt;&gt; Dan and Ephraim has been taken out and the others have been placed in their place. And somebody said, "How in the world did that happen?" I'll tell you how it happened. all the way back there years ago when Israel was having trouble and and and Israel and Judah divided. What they did is Israel said, "We don't want the people going down to Jerusalem and worshiping because we might lose our influence. So, we're going to build us a couple gold c." Do you see where that old devil go? You see that? You see that devil? &gt;&gt; I can't let my people go to that meeting cuz man, &gt;&gt; if one meeting would deceive you, I'm a sorry preacher. If one meeting would wipe somebody out, my goodness. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I You ain't saying much for the seed life, are you? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; My Bible said, Amen. that they cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Only for a season. &gt;&gt; Go back and read it and see. See if that God didn't when they when they worshiped those golden calves and y'all remember the story coming out of Egypt. Remember Aaron made a golden calf. &gt;&gt; Remember that? &gt;&gt; And when they made that golden calf, the Levites made that. Aaron did. &gt;&gt; And then here we are hundred years later and Dan and Ephraim builds a golden calf just like Aaron did. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Is not this the God that brought us out of Egypt?" Everybody knew the story of Egypt, but they were placing the glory of Jehovah, that pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; on that money-making scheme of denomination. &gt;&gt; Is not this the God that'll get you in rapture? &gt;&gt; Do you see religion? It's same. &gt;&gt; It never changes &gt;&gt; money-making scheme. But God cursed the idea of worshiping idols. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said any man that would do it, his name would be blotted out from under the heavens. &gt;&gt; But when God realigns for the millennial kingdom &gt;&gt; in Revelations the 14th chapter and also in the book of Ezekiel, this Dan and Ephraim are right back in tribal order. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Showing you that God can remember sin, &gt;&gt; but he also can forget it. &gt;&gt; That he can take that and because of his word, he says it. But then God actually will allow them right back in tribal order during the millennium. Do you see all Israel, that's the seventh seal, by the way, you can go listen to it. That's all of Israel &gt;&gt; shall be saved. Right. &gt;&gt; All of Israel &gt;&gt; shall be saved. Won't you stand to your feet with me this morning, all of Israel. When Joseph started revealing himself to his brethren, he just started weeping. This is him. This is our brother. But grace was right there. &gt;&gt; Do you know it's recorded in the book of Zechariah that in the 10th verse that I'll pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem with the spirit of grace and supplications. And they that look upon me that they have pierced shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness of the firstborn. And in that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem in the morning of Hendrin in the valley of Megodon and the land shall mourn. Do you know that Israel every fall after the feast of trumpets they worship a day called the day of atonement. And the feast of trumpets were being sounded under Hitler in the Second World War. So they're there right now waiting for the feast of atonement. Now they think they're there to build a millennial temple. They think they're there to raise a rad heer that they might be able to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Traditionally, that's what they're doing. But God's got them there because there's going to be two witnesses rise up &gt;&gt; and they're going to do the sign of a prophet and they're going to realize that the Messiah they're looking to come they had crucified 2,000 years ago. This feast of atonement will become a feast of mourning &gt;&gt; because they'll realize the lamb has already been slain. And they'll gather in their houses and they'll say unto him, "Where did you get those scars?" In the house of my friends. Amen. Brother Ben, you sing this song. [Music] I will bring you back home.

And I I think it's time, honestly, I believe it's time to blow the trumpet in Zion. &gt;&gt; I I believe it is. I believe it's time to blow the trumpet in Zion and tell the people, "Amen. Awake, Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. This this this this world events that we're facing. I you know, I I I I'm not a prophet or the son of a prophet, but I'll say this. I read my Bible and I hear this message &gt;&gt; and we are living &gt;&gt; in the last moments of the last days of time. &gt;&gt; The these things don't have to be created or they just have to be put in action. &gt;&gt; We're sitting here on the on the brink of some of the greatest changes in history. &gt;&gt; Time will never be the same after Israel attacked Iran. &gt;&gt; Nothing will ever be the same. from that day. &gt;&gt; It'll never go back to normal. &gt;&gt; Not now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It won't. &gt;&gt; You said, "Preacher, what are we waiting on?" There's one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's one. &gt;&gt; Just one. Somebody said, "Well, well, I I think there's got to be maybe the whole church has got to come into adoption at one time." &gt;&gt; Now, if you ever have you ever drove by a field in the late summer, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and seen half of its gold and part of it green, &gt;&gt; right? I'll tell you this, there is some very golden grain in this church. &gt;&gt; There's some very golden grain in this bride. &gt;&gt; There might be some green left, but wait just a minute. She's laying in the presence. &gt;&gt; She's going to ripen up. &gt;&gt; She's going to ripen up. It's It's going home time, folks. &gt;&gt; It's It's the going home time. Amen. I don't know if it's in order, but I feel like it. Amen. What about that song, Blow the Trump in Zion? I I I don't know. Uh, I just feel it in my bones. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to blow a trumpet. &gt;&gt; I believe that's what the gospel is doing, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's sounding It's sounding the alarm to the people. &gt;&gt; Somebody high on the wall has said, "Babylon, Babylon is great. Is fallen is falling." Amen. Come out of her, my people. I heard the call. &gt;&gt; I heard that bride gathering. And in that mystery, the seven seals, she's a go. There's two prophets arriving. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's the season of redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe we're living right in the middle of it. And I thank God that our eyes are wide open to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They rush on the city. They run on the wall. Great is the army that carries out his word. They rush on the city.
