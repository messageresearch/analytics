[53:11] past and you know down in Faro and and
[53:16] and uh got videos of it and things like
[53:18] that you know that well you know those
[53:21] were special moments and time and and um
[53:25] you know we've been down the the road
[53:28] many many many miles now and uh but one
[53:32] day we're coming to The Last Mile we'll

[53:46] great men that have been through and I
[53:48] couldn't name them all but you know my
[53:51] my heart just kind of turned over as I
[53:53] thought about brother John Leon maybe
[53:55] some of his families here tonight and um
[53:59] you know we we think about the many that
[54:02] have gone on before us that have paved
[54:05] the way for many of you I I um I think
[54:09] sometimes you know the things we
[54:11] struggled through in the infancy of the
[54:14] message and understanding and getting a
[54:16] grip of what was done and um you know of
[54:20] what God had s in this day and and then
[54:22] we see young men rise up and they're
[54:25] preaching things that it took me 20
[54:27] years to get to you know that because
[54:30] the road got paved and we speed right
[54:34] down that road you know and but it was a
[54:36] lot of
[54:37] trailblazing and uh but we are so
[54:40] thankful for men of God who have stood
[54:43] down through the time and stood the test
[54:45] of time and and we want to press on to
[54:48] the mark for the price of the High
[54:50] Calling amen God bless you it's so good
[54:53] to be with you and I pray that the
[54:55] Lord's blessings will be upon you

[55:11] ways and I I REM REM sister Lucille you

[55:19] years ago and I think it was must have
[55:22] been ' 88 or ' 89 something like that
[55:24] and and um Lord the Lord used her in a
[55:28] way I I don't think she even knows about
[55:30] it but um I had never been overseas in
[55:33] my life and in know country boy I always
[55:37] say if you leave me alone I just stay on
[55:39] my front
[55:40] porch you know and um so I I got up as
[55:45] far as Michigan that was a long ways for
[55:47] a boy from

[59:08] true that I am keep my
[59:13] reputation but the Lord help us to fill
[59:15] our mouth with good things and and then
[59:17] stop us when we set enough let us follow
[59:21] the nudge of the spirit tonight Ezekiel
[59:24] 37:1
[59:26] the hand of the Lord was upon me and
[59:28] carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
[59:30] and set me down in the midst of the
[59:32] valley which was full of Bones and
[59:35] caused me to pass them round about and
[59:37] behold there were very many in the open
[59:39] Valley and lo they were very dry and he
[59:44] said unto me son of man can these bones
[59:47] live and I answered oh Lord God thou
[59:51] knowest again he said unto me prophesy
[59:55] upon these bones
[59:56] and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear
[1:00:00] the word of the Lord thus sayith the
[1:00:03] Lord unto these bones behold I will
[1:00:06] cause breath to enter into you and you
[1:00:09] shall live and I will a in you upon you
[1:00:13] and will bring up flesh upon you and
[1:00:16] cover you with skin and put breath in
[1:00:18] you and you shall live and you shall
[1:00:21] know that I am the Lord so I prophesied
[1:00:25] as I was commanded and as I prophesied
[1:00:28] there was a noise and a Behold a shaking
[1:00:30] and the bones came together boned his
[1:00:33] bones and when I beheld low the SS and
[1:00:37] the flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[1:00:41] covered them above but there was no
[1:00:43] breath in them then he said unto me
[1:00:47] prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
[1:00:50] man say the wind thus sayith the Lord
[1:00:53] God come from the Four Winds o breath
[1:00:56] and breathe upon these slain that they
[1:00:58] may live so I prophesied as he commanded
[1:01:02] me and the breath came into them and
[1:01:05] they lived and stood upon their feet an
[1:01:09] exceeding great Army let's just talk to
[1:01:12] the Lord once more father thank you for
[1:01:15] these moments and time and the word that
[1:01:17] you have left for our learning I pray
[1:01:20] Lord that you'll bless us tonight in
[1:01:22] your presence and anoint us now as we
[1:01:25] speak in Jesus name amen God bless you
[1:01:29] can be seated I'm going to speak to you
[1:01:31] tonight all you dry bones hear the word
[1:01:34] of the Lord you know there are many
[1:01:37] descriptive words in the Bible that
[1:01:40] describe the last age and its move of
[1:01:43] God and what we see in this passage of
[1:01:46] Ezekiel is the word of the Lord bringing
[1:01:50] a
[1:01:51] restoration and it looks hopeless in
[1:01:53] fact when the prophet is asked can these
[1:01:56] live he had to divert to God and say
[1:01:59] Lord thou knowest it looks so impossible
[1:02:02] but the word of the Lord
[1:02:05] restores and God is doing much more than
[1:02:08] just restoring Doctrine in this day
[1:02:11] although he's that certainly is a very
[1:02:14] integral and important part of what God
[1:02:17] is doing but God is also restoring homes
[1:02:22] he is restoring healing he's restoring
[1:02:25] the AR original outpouring of the Holy
[1:02:27] Ghost he's restoring a book of Acts amen
[1:02:31] he's restoring
[1:02:33] marriages amen well you say well my
[1:02:36] problem is my job well he's a god of
[1:02:39] restoration well my problem is my health
[1:02:41] well God is a restorer of Health it
[1:02:44] makes no difference how aged you are how
[1:02:47] sick you are how what the problem is
[1:02:51] amen God is restoring yes amen we
[1:02:55] remember with Abraham he waited until he
[1:02:57] was 90 years old actually 100 years old
[1:03:01] when he restored him as a very old man
[1:03:04] and healed Sarah when she was past 90
[1:03:08] God has no limits on
[1:03:10] him as he said to Sarah of old is there
[1:03:14] anything too hard for the
[1:03:16] Lord God's Prophet would rush to the
[1:03:19] bedside of a 90-year-old Bill da and see
[1:03:22] God come on the scene and heal him so
[1:03:25] that he would live uh for for years
[1:03:27] after that see there is no limit on God
[1:03:31] right and no matter how far you have
[1:03:34] strayed or how far you have gone into
[1:03:37] sin or what wickedness you have
[1:03:40] committed this God is a
[1:03:43] restorer no matter how bad off your
[1:03:46] family is or how they have strayed away
[1:03:48] from God Amen they they may be a house
[1:03:52] full of infidels and unbelievers but
[1:03:55] this God is a God that can reach further
[1:03:58] down than what you can look up amen he
[1:04:01] can bring a restoration when there's
[1:04:04] only bones left because he's a God that
[1:04:07] said I will restore sayth the
[1:04:11] Lord hallelujah hallelujah we look at
[1:04:14] Israel and that land was dry in a
[1:04:17] desolate place that had long went back
[1:04:19] to briers and thistles and its
[1:04:22] inhabitants had been dispersed around
[1:04:24] the world but his his word is said I
[1:04:27] will restore and God looked upon this
[1:04:31] valley of dry bones and said these Tri
[1:04:34] bones hear the word of the Lord and they
[1:04:37] become a Great and Mighty Army and God's
[1:04:41] word is brought a restoration today
[1:04:43] where the nation of Israel is a mighty
[1:04:46] nation a a thriving Nation a mighty army
[1:04:50] with great expectations of many who are

[1:04:59] see the natural
[1:05:00] fulfillment you know if they are being
[1:05:04] restored so is her spiritual
[1:05:07] counterpart the bride of Christ is
[1:05:10] reaching
[1:05:11] fulfillment amen and and we're even
[1:05:14] ahead of them we're Advanced Beyond them

[1:05:33] original tement and healing is in our
[1:05:36] midst and salvation is in our midst the
[1:05:38] Holy Ghost is in our midst and every
[1:05:41] part of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:43] is with us in this hour it is

[1:28:45] day so there's been wave after wave
[1:28:47] after wave as the Holy Spirit began to
[1:28:50] be poured out and it got poured out on
[1:28:54] you know other ministers caught that
[1:28:56] inspiration and and rode on that wave of
[1:28:59] Divine Healing they saw that part of the
[1:29:02] word that had been laying dormant and
[1:29:04] they said that days of Miracles are
[1:29:06] passed and it worked for them they saw
[1:29:09] it work it gave them Faith to believe it
[1:29:12] would work in their lives too they saw
[1:29:14] it in the Bible is true so there was
[1:29:17] wave after wave that be of the spirit of
[1:29:20] God began to be poured out and poured
[1:29:23] out upon men
[1:29:25] such as Jack Co and or Roberts and
[1:29:28] others who would ride on that wave of
[1:29:31] that
[1:29:33] outpouring and and and what I'm trying
[1:29:35] to tell you today is you got to be
[1:29:39] passionate
[1:29:40] too you must ride on the wave of that
[1:29:46] outpouring because you said in the last
[1:29:48] day I will pour out my spirit upon All
[1:29:52] Flesh
[1:29:55] and my sons and my daughters shall
[1:29:57] prophesy they they're going to speak my
[1:30:01] word amen so what I'm telling you is you
[1:30:04] got to be passionate
[1:30:06] too passionate men took a hold of it
[1:30:10] Jack Cole for example he was a simly god
[1:30:13] preacher he uh he attended some of
[1:30:16] brother Brandon's meetings and and he
[1:30:18] had doubt in his heart he didn't believe
[1:30:20] what he was seeing was real just
[1:30:22] absolutely didn't he supposed to be
[1:30:24] Pentecostal preacher and believeing in
[1:30:26] the the miraculous but you know he just
[1:30:29] he just thought it was just hyping
[1:30:31] hysteria you know was nothing to it so
[1:30:35] you know he he actually testifies where
[1:30:37] he went and and watched you know um went
[1:30:41] to Brother Brandon's meeting and he went
[1:30:43] there as a skeptic that's right brother
[1:30:45] brandham calls him one of my converts to
[1:30:47] Divine Healing I wish a bunch of
[1:30:49] preachers in this message would get
[1:30:52] converted come on
[1:30:54] and anyway you know brother brother
[1:30:57] brandham um he watched brother brandham
[1:31:00] as he prayed for the needs and there was
[1:31:03] a man that came up and he had no
[1:31:07] eyeballs and brother bam told him that
[1:31:10] this man with no eyeballs said you will
[1:31:12] see in three
[1:31:14] days said in three days there will it'll
[1:31:17] take three days for eyeballs to form in
[1:31:20] your eyes and on the third day you will
[1:31:21] be seeing
[1:31:24] Well Jack thought anybody can say that
[1:31:28] you know the blind man will leave and go
[1:31:30] home and no one will know if he's ever
[1:31:32] received his healing you know he'd just
[1:31:34] be one of the thousands in the
[1:31:36] crowd and so his brother Bram leaves the
[1:31:39] platform Jack sitting on the platform
[1:31:41] and near the the exit there brother Bram
[1:31:44] stops puts his hand on his on his knee
[1:31:47] for a minute just kind of pray quietly
[1:31:49] and he says um what are you so skeptical
[1:31:52] about
[1:31:55] you're a preacher too he said actually
[1:31:57] you're sick too but your sickness
[1:31:58] because you run down from so many
[1:32:00] Revival meetings but don't be skeptical
[1:32:03] about this God has a work for you to do
[1:32:07] also and of course he was thrilled to
[1:32:09] hear those words but he want to wait
[1:32:11] until those three days was up and find
[1:32:13] that blind
[1:32:15] man and before he was really convinced
[1:32:18] so you know on the third day he was back
[1:32:21] there for the meeting he looked at that
[1:32:23] man and and he found he's walking around
[1:32:25] and sure enough he had eyeballs formed
[1:32:27] in his in his head but he still couldn't
[1:32:28] see but later that evening as the
[1:32:31] evening time approached he could see as
[1:32:34] good as
[1:32:37] anybody and and you know that brother
[1:32:40] brother Jack would say of brother
[1:32:41] brandham that that William brandham was
[1:32:43] called for dispensational
[1:32:47] purposes and that so inspired him that
[1:32:50] he got under that anointing and began to
[1:32:52] believe God and he rode on that wave of
[1:32:56] Divine Healing right you know those men
[1:32:58] knew how to tap into Heaven's outpouring
[1:33:01] they knew that you you know that you
[1:33:04] could sit right under the flow of the
[1:33:06] spirit and right in the spout where the
[1:33:08] glory was coming out and miss it right
[1:33:11] because of unbelief and unconfessed sins
[1:33:15] right come on now come on you remember
[1:33:17] brother bam tells us that and how I can
[1:33:19] overcome he said I crossed an Old Log
[1:33:21] and it was laying there right in the
[1:33:22] Water of Life and he said it was Doty
[1:33:25] and I I stepped on and a big chunk fell
[1:33:28] off right and he said I looked at it and
[1:33:30] said look at there it's laying right
[1:33:32] there in the fountain and it rottens
[1:33:34] twice as quick he said keep life within
[1:33:39] you amen so Jack had to be stirred from
[1:33:43] his unbelief to start believing and once
[1:33:45] he started believing the power started
[1:33:47] work for him and Heathen Miracles began
[1:33:49] to take place now he didn't you know he
[1:33:52] died in 56 but he didn't go of course
[1:33:54] the opening of the word had not come and
[1:33:56] and we don't know what he would have
[1:33:58] done you know whatever maybe he was just
[1:34:01] predestined for that moment I don't know
[1:34:03] but nevertheless you know he rode on
[1:34:06] that word that he had received right and
[1:34:10] that's what's important with you we have
[1:34:13] received a great word in this
[1:34:16] day right on all of it
[1:34:19] amen yes sir amen
[1:34:24] so they knew they knew that there would
[1:34:26] be things that would keep you from
[1:34:29] riding on that wave into Victory come on
[1:34:32] now so well brother Tim I don't have any
[1:34:34] unconfessed sins I'm not a sinner well
[1:34:37] maybe you didn't go out and rob a
[1:34:39] bank maybe murder
[1:34:42] somebody but every one of us deal with a
[1:34:44] measure of
[1:34:46] unbelief I hear brother Brandon even
[1:34:48] praying many times Lord forgive me of my
[1:34:50] sins amen that's right in fact Brother
[1:34:53] Ray he he prayed that just before we
[1:34:55] came out Lord forgive us of our
[1:34:59] shortcomings and brother bandam was
[1:35:00] shown The Binding of the serpent there a
[1:35:03] hideous mamba likee snake that was after
[1:35:06] God's people and he was told to have
[1:35:09] power to bind it you must be more
[1:35:14] sincere now if I'd have been standing
[1:35:16] there i' said well who could be more
[1:35:17] sincere than William Brandon right but
[1:35:20] God looked at him and said in order to
[1:35:22] do this it's going to take a greater
[1:35:24] depth of
[1:35:25] sincerity you see the gospel must become
[1:35:28] less mechanical and more sincere or
[1:35:34] heartfelt amen you you've got to become
[1:35:37] passionate about what you have and when
[1:35:40] you come to the house of God get rid of
[1:35:42] your
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:45] unbelief amen you know these men knew
[1:35:48] you could not ride on this wave of
[1:35:51] unbelief and unconfessed sin and in your
[1:35:53] life life you had to get rid of it you
[1:35:56] know you can just let envy and Malice
[1:35:58] and strife come in your heart and that
[1:36:00] thing will rob you from the thing that
[1:36:03] God has for
[1:36:04] you amen it'll take the blessings of God
[1:36:07] right out of your
[1:36:09] life some people get some men get a such
[1:36:12] a spirit Sometimes women a spirit of
[1:36:14] possessiveness that possesses your your
[1:36:16] wife and kids and holds them under
[1:36:18] bondage or some spirit of jealousy or
[1:36:21] envy and that evil spirit will kill keep
[1:36:23] you from the glory of God as it comes
[1:36:25] into the
[1:36:27] church right may maybe those things
[1:36:29] aren't outward but inward hidden things
[1:36:32] yes sir there are things we wrestle with
[1:36:34] because of our flesh right and when you
[1:36:37] come into the presence of God you always
[1:36:39] want to examine yourself right remember
[1:36:42] brother bam told us in in the in the in
[1:36:45] the in the message he told us our
[1:36:47] problem is that we're too
[1:36:50] strong preach perfect strength by
[1:36:53] Perfect weakness when we realize we're
[1:36:56] weak when we need
[1:36:59] God well I'm the bride of Christ you
[1:37:01] need Jesus yes sir amen amen if anybody
[1:37:05] needs the comfort of the bridegroom we
[1:37:07] do if anybody needs to be pulled up and
[1:37:10] whispered to love secrets we
[1:37:13] do we need him yes sir yes
[1:37:17] sir that's
[1:37:19] right you know you you look at and you
[1:37:22] say have I lost my first love maybe
[1:37:25] that's the
[1:37:26] sin when you lose your first love you
[1:37:29] lose your
[1:37:31] passion I don't mean to apply that
[1:37:34] you're sick now because of some secret
[1:37:36] sin but it's like the woman with the
[1:37:38] Lost coin you turn over everything in
[1:37:40] your life you throw out anything that
[1:37:42] would hinder your faith find that little
[1:37:44] bit of
[1:37:47] insincerity good brother so you can bind
[1:37:49] that serpent good I mean here's brother
[1:37:52] Ron he fight a satanic attack God's
[1:37:56] using him like never before encouraging
[1:37:58] us on taking away our
[1:38:01] excuses but I look forward to the day of
[1:38:04] total
[1:38:06] Deliverance amen wining this battle and
[1:38:10] restoration amen it may be in this
[1:38:13] meeting that those bones
[1:38:15] live that that Faith Rises up and grasps
[1:38:19] the promise amen that the battle is over
[1:38:22] and the Victory is
[1:38:24] one we have a responsibility as a church
[1:38:27] to produce that kind of atmosphere with
[1:38:30] those kind of things
[1:38:32] happen that's
[1:38:39] right but they realize you know you can
[1:38:41] let envy and Malice and strife come to
[1:38:43] your heart and that thing will rob you
[1:38:46] from the thing that God has for
[1:38:48] you take the blessings of God right out
[1:38:50] of your
[1:38:51] life how many times times and and Jack
[1:38:55] would say this and I'm just going to
[1:38:56] tell a story of his for a moment we'll
[1:38:58] move
[1:38:59] on but
[1:39:01] I but how many times have he said have I
[1:39:04] heard this in a in a healing line people
[1:39:06] say I don't understand it if sister so
[1:39:09] and so didn't get healed and nobody get
[1:39:11] healed cuz she's a saint of God he says
[1:39:14] how do you know she is man looks on the
[1:39:16] outward appearance but God looks on the
[1:39:18] heart you don't know what sister so and
[1:39:20] so is God in a heart quit judging your
[1:39:23] El by yourself judge yourself by him the
[1:39:26] perfect one you've heard it hundreds of
[1:39:29] times their sister so and so and she's
[1:39:30] an invalid if she doesn't get healed
[1:39:32] then nobody get healed so I can't go by
[1:39:35] sister so and so there's only one thing
[1:39:36] I know to go by and that's this book and
[1:39:39] he promised to heal all my diseases and
[1:39:42] take away all my iniquities so you don't
[1:39:45] even know your own wife's heart because
[1:39:48] you look at her faults all her her
[1:39:50] shortcomings and you don't know your
[1:39:52] husband's heart you don't know the
[1:39:54] thoughts that run to his mind or what so
[1:39:57] right what right you have to get up and
[1:39:59] say if God doesn't heal him then nobody
[1:40:01] get
[1:40:02] healed then he tells about how he was in
[1:40:05] a meeting in Netherland Texas one time
[1:40:08] and he was on his way home from church
[1:40:10] and the Pastor said to him you know you
[1:40:13] prayed for a woman tonight and I just
[1:40:14] don't understand that said she's a worst
[1:40:17] drunker in this whole city of of
[1:40:19] Netherlands she come up walking on
[1:40:21] crutches and everybody knows she she's
[1:40:23] been a habitual drunkard and she sat
[1:40:26] down the altar gave her heart to God you
[1:40:27] prayed for her after that and she
[1:40:29] dropped those crutches and went all over
[1:40:31] the building praising
[1:40:37] God aren't you glad for the blood of
[1:40:40] Christ one moment that's
[1:40:44] right one
[1:40:46] [Applause]
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:49] moment stop this for a minute I was just
[1:40:52] a boy and brother those meetings on the
[1:40:54] wings of a snow white dub and those
[1:40:56] meetings there it was a little sister
[1:40:59] that now is in our church sister jeie
[1:41:01] Camp she was in brother bram's meetings
[1:41:04] had been invited there by an uncle who
[1:41:07] had learned that God had sent a prophet
[1:41:09] in this age and and they had open prayer
[1:41:12] line and and they got a prayer card and
[1:41:15] she went in she was 16 years old or so
[1:41:17] was a um you know was a cheerleader in
[1:41:21] high school and and she had picked up
[1:41:24] the habit of
[1:41:25] smoking she's a Methodist girl she knew
[1:41:29] nothing
[1:41:30] about you know the Divine Healing or any
[1:41:33] of that and the power of God but she
[1:41:36] just went and got a prayer card and went
[1:41:38] through the line and about three people
[1:41:41] in front of her brother brandham stopped
[1:41:44] her this woman and said listen you're
[1:41:47] Desiring a great thing you're Desiring a
[1:41:50] baby
[1:41:55] said but you got a habit there that
[1:41:58] you're going to have to surrender and
[1:42:01] that's smoking
[1:42:02] cigarettes if you will if you'll say to
[1:42:05] God I'll not smoke them no more I'll
[1:42:07] give them over to you you'll have that
[1:42:12] baby well Genie's three people
[1:42:16] back and all she's thinking oh God I
[1:42:19] didn't know how bad cigarettes was I
[1:42:21] didn't know how wrong I would but my
[1:42:23] mama don't know I'm smoking cigarettes
[1:42:26] please whatever you do don't tell let
[1:42:27] that man tell my mama what I'm doing
[1:42:30] forgive me right now God please forgive
[1:42:32] me I I Repent right now and she goes
[1:42:35] right through the line brother bandam
[1:42:37] right and felt that presence of the
[1:42:39] angel of God and nothing was ever said
[1:42:42] about her cigarettes because not even a
[1:42:46] prophet can pull something out of your
[1:42:49] life that has been repented of
[1:42:56] Hallelujah there's a quick fix to your
[1:43:00] problem a quick fix for your problem
[1:43:05] repent be sincere that's
[1:43:12] right so anyway he said
[1:43:14] I jack was having this conversation with
[1:43:17] this Pastor said you prayed for that
[1:43:19] woman she dropped her CES and went all
[1:43:21] over the building praising God
[1:43:23] now why would God heal someone like that
[1:43:25] when this sister in my church got a
[1:43:27] Waterhead baby and she's a Deacon's wife
[1:43:29] and they pay their tith they come to
[1:43:31] church and there's not a more Godly
[1:43:33] couple in the world than them why is it
[1:43:35] God wouldn't heal that that baby said I
[1:43:38] I don't know her life he said but I do
[1:43:40] he said no you don't well said he's the
[1:43:42] only she's the only woman and he's the
[1:43:45] the only man I can put uttermost
[1:43:46] confidence in my church and look what
[1:43:48] they have to go through you know
[1:43:50] carrying that Waterhead baby and 8 years
[1:43:53] old and can't walk a big great big head
[1:43:56] little bitty body and the child cries
[1:43:58] all hours of the night now that mother
[1:44:00] has to be up with it now tell me why God
[1:44:03] don't heal that baby and said well I
[1:44:05] don't know her heart you don't either
[1:44:07] yes I do he said and so he said we said
[1:44:10] nothing about it more about it but the
[1:44:11] next morning when the spirit of God was
[1:44:14] moving the sister stood on her feet with
[1:44:17] tears rolling down her cheeks and said
[1:44:18] I've missed God I have murmured and
[1:44:21] complained because God God gave me a
[1:44:24] Waterhead
[1:44:25] baby
[1:44:26] on you know a lot of times people in M
[1:44:30] murmur and complain against God because
[1:44:33] of the grab bag of Life come on now you
[1:44:38] know maybe you've lost your wife or your
[1:44:40] husband or you've been through a divorce
[1:44:42] or somebody did something wrong to you
[1:44:45] or or the church failed you the pastor
[1:44:47] didn't come to see you when you thought
[1:44:50] he should have and you've developed a
[1:44:52] bitterness in your heart
[1:44:55] heart you have to deal with it whatever
[1:44:57] my whatever it is if you want the
[1:44:59] blessings of God you got to deal with
[1:45:01] sin sins kept you from the house of God
[1:45:04] from The Fellowship of Believers from
[1:45:06] the presence of the almighty God and the
[1:45:09] blessings that should flow over your
[1:45:11] life there I tell you what you want it
[1:45:14] where there's nothing between you and
[1:45:16] your
[1:45:16] savior I I know what bitterness would do
[1:45:19] I watched a woman who got bitterness in
[1:45:22] her heart consider never she's Barren
[1:45:24] never could have a child and she held it
[1:45:25] in her heart against God until it began
[1:45:28] to grow and drove her insane she took
[1:45:29] her
[1:45:31] life bitterness is an awful thing yes
[1:45:34] sir you've got to deal with sin right no
[1:45:37] matter what form it's in if it's
[1:45:39] something as small as as losing your
[1:45:41] first love and that passion to please
[1:45:44] God if you want to ride on the wave of
[1:45:47] God's glory if you want the benefits of
[1:45:49] his healing power if you want to see God
[1:45:52] move for your family you want to see
[1:45:54] God's blessings on your life you got to
[1:45:57] deal with sin no matter where it comes
[1:46:01] from it might be from the gossip of
[1:46:03] somebody else who has bitterness in
[1:46:05] their own heart against the church or
[1:46:07] the pastors why you're reluctant you
[1:46:10] know and you don't attend church
[1:46:13] regularly you know your attitude toward
[1:46:15] Christ that's an
[1:46:16] attitude and it's toward Christ you
[1:46:19] think it's against the church the church
[1:46:21] represents Christ
[1:46:24] you got an attitude against the church
[1:46:26] you got an attitude against
[1:46:28] God and it's keeping you from the house
[1:46:31] of God or when you come you will sit
[1:46:34] back pulled back and reserved and don't
[1:46:36] enter
[1:46:39] in are you with me amen and you know
[1:46:43] because you let something happen maybe
[1:46:46] as I said some
[1:46:48] gossip to you and the it's a reason that
[1:46:52] you have no idence in the ministry but
[1:46:54] it's
[1:46:57] sin you know no matter how powerful a
[1:47:00] man of God is he cannot help you unless
[1:47:03] you have confidence in him right that's
[1:47:07] right and Satan will do everything to
[1:47:09] destroy your
[1:47:11] confidence in the work of
[1:47:14] God in the ministry in the pastor
[1:47:19] right
[1:47:20] amen oh it may be just bitterness
[1:47:23] against a

[1:49:24] I don't know of a more saintly couple
[1:49:26] than this woman or husband with the
[1:49:28] Waterhead baby there he's a deacon and
[1:49:30] they pay their tithe and Faithfully they
[1:49:33] stood by me in difficult times but the
[1:49:35] next morning in the prayer meeting she
[1:49:37] stood on her feet and said I've missed
[1:49:39] God I have murmured and complained
[1:49:43] because God gave me a Waterhead
[1:49:48] baby now first of all I want you to get
[1:49:50] a point God doesn't send
[1:49:57] sickness that's right sickness is of the
[1:50:03] devil it is not of God God did not cause
[1:50:07] your children
[1:50:09] astray God did not cause you to be born
[1:50:12] in a dysfunctional
[1:50:14] family amen sin caused that
[1:50:17] dysfunctional family you can't blame God
[1:50:21] for the circumstances of your life you
[1:50:23] mean you got to realize this is a world
[1:50:25] of sin and unbelief and darkness and
[1:50:28] doubting and fear and unfortunately you
[1:50:30] were not born in in God's
[1:50:33] Eden this ain't the Millennium that's
[1:50:35] right last time I checked this is no
[1:50:38] Millennium that's right amen you were
[1:50:41] born in Satan's Eden and you've got to
[1:50:43] overcome it that's
[1:50:46] right and God has confidence right in
[1:50:50] every predestinated seat
[1:50:53] that no matter what circumstance or
[1:50:56] situation you have been brought up under
[1:50:59] you are going to rise above
[1:51:06] it it ain't you so much he has
[1:51:09] confidence he has confidence in his
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:15] seed the woman at the well was a seed of
[1:51:18] God and brother Bon said about it she
[1:51:20] probably wasn't a bad girl she probably
[1:51:22] just sold out by her father for monetary
[1:51:24] reason and started that kind of life but
[1:51:26] the devil cannot cannnot hide a
[1:51:29] predestinated seed from his
[1:51:31] God hallelujah hallelujah he came to
[1:51:35] seek and to save that which was
[1:51:37] lost I cannot lose something unless it
[1:51:41] was in my possession
[1:51:45] first
[1:51:46] Hallelujah come on that's right he came
[1:51:49] to seek and save that which was lost
[1:51:52] that's right
[1:51:55] me just stop and relax a minute and tell
[1:51:57] you a story about a little boy that went
[1:52:00] made himself a
[1:52:04] sailboat he worked day and night on the
[1:52:07] thing it was really a piece of
[1:52:10] art he went out every day then when he
[1:52:13] got it complete and sailed his
[1:52:16] boat one
[1:52:18] day a wind came up and blew that
[1:52:21] sailboat out of his
[1:52:23] reach way out and he watched it go out
[1:52:26] of
[1:52:27] sight well every day he went looking for
[1:52:30] his
[1:52:31] sailboat where is my sailboat it's got
[1:52:34] to be here
[1:52:35] somewhere I I I I lost it out here and
[1:52:38] it's got to show up so he every day
[1:52:41] would get out where's my sailboat I got
[1:52:43] to find
[1:52:45] it and Van he looked for it one day he
[1:52:49] was in town walked by a pawn shop and in
[1:52:52] the window was his
[1:52:54] sailboat
[1:52:55] Hallelujah he looked there at that
[1:52:58] sailboat and oh he was shocked it had a
[1:53:01] huge price on
[1:53:03] it it was more than any of the money
[1:53:06] that he
[1:53:07] had but he wanted that
[1:53:09] sailboat so he said I know what I'll do
[1:53:12] I'm going to go back home I'm going to
[1:53:13] sell all my toys my bicycle everything
[1:53:17] I'm you know all my games I'm going to
[1:53:19] sell everything and I'm going to get the
[1:53:21] money for that sailboat
[1:53:23] so he finally you know has a sale goes
[1:53:26] back to the bond shop with the money and
[1:53:29] he pays the
[1:53:31] price and as he walks out of the pawn
[1:53:34] shop he is seen hugging that little
[1:53:37] sailboat to his arms to his heart like
[1:53:41] that and as he does he says little
[1:53:44] sailboat you're
[1:53:47] mine you were mine when I made
[1:53:51] you and and now you're mine when I
[1:53:54] bought you you are twice
[1:53:57] [Music]

[1:54:03] foundational world before you did
[1:54:05] anything wrong but he left all of Glory
[1:54:09] when you stayed away from him and he
[1:54:11] paid the price of redemption and he came
[1:54:15] down and purchased you you are his twice
[1:54:25] God's got the first claim on your
[1:54:27] life for the devil ever got to you God

[2:07:03] Street was not the
[2:07:04] complete ah it was however greater than
[2:07:07] Luther's
[2:07:08] justification right it was greater than
[2:07:10] Wesley's
[2:07:11] sanctification and because it was
[2:07:13] accompanied withurst of emotions and
[2:07:15] speaking in tongues people thought it
[2:07:17] was real but it went back in
[2:07:19] organization and proved it wasn't real
[2:07:23] but there is another people in the
[2:07:26] land who are the final wave of the
[2:07:29] spirit it is more than justification and
[2:07:32] forgiveness of sin it's more than just a
[2:07:35] Sanctified life where one puts off the
[2:07:37] sins of the past amen it's more than
[2:07:40] just an outburst of emotion and a gift
[2:07:43] of the spirit but it's the hour where
[2:07:45] the very Life of Christ from Heaven
[2:07:49] opened up the Seven Seals yeah and
[2:07:52] brought back down to us the full promise
[2:07:56] the full inheritance where you can look

[2:11:49] Pentecost could not preach that that's
[2:11:52] isusa Street failed brother Brandon
[2:11:55] would tell them in their 50th Jubilee
[2:11:57] where I think Pentecost failed and that
[2:12:00] was because they didn't go far enough
[2:12:01] with God they wouldn't go into the inner
[2:12:03] Court they stopped with speaking in
[2:12:07] tongues and didn't press
[2:12:12] on

[2:13:06] gifts of the word and too many only have
[2:13:09] it in the form of letter leaving the

[2:15:23] the word prior ages drank the milk of
[2:15:26] the word in the age of justification it

[2:15:36] days of Wesley
[2:15:38] sanctification it was unskillful in the
[2:15:40] word of righteousness and isusa Street
[2:15:42] drank milk the milk of emotion and gifts
[2:15:45] and excited the the human spirit and its

[2:20:18] full word has come
[2:20:21] but guess what in that full word is
[2:20:24] every Divine
[2:20:27] promise not just one part all of
[2:20:30] [Applause]
[2:20:32] it sure a gift is not the evidence of a
[2:20:35] Spirit-filled life it's it's not what
[2:20:37] we're seeking after we're not trying to
[2:20:39] speak with tongues that's all over with
[2:20:41] the full word has come to manifestation
[2:20:44] and with the full word is all
[2:20:48] here when you get in that per perfect
[2:20:52] body all that which was in part will be
[2:20:55] done away

[2:21:24] we'll all speak a Heavenly
[2:21:27] language everybody will speak in tongues
[2:21:29] there it won't be a phenomena that's

[2:21:43] tell you even though even though let me
[2:21:46] just say the full word is here so it has
[2:21:48] every every promise in it and if you
[2:21:51] ever get born of the word you'll be a
[2:21:53] tongue speaking acts 238 screaming
[2:21:56] yelling younging because that's the only
[2:21:58] kind the word can bring
[2:22:01] forth
[2:22:03] Hallelujah the full word has come at the
[2:22:07] opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10
[2:22:10] the full word is to be born into

[2:22:16] spirit of God in the full strength as he
[2:22:18] was here on the Earth manifested the
[2:22:20] same way doing the same thing so we're
[2:22:23] in the day when the full word has been
[2:22:25] made manifest and revealed and that's
[2:22:28] the wave we are riding
[2:22:34] on well AR our emphasis is not on
[2:22:38] speaking in tongues anymore that's right
[2:22:40] but we still have speaking in tongues
[2:22:42] because it's in the word amen amen we
[2:22:45] have prayer
[2:22:47] lines cuz it's in the word that's right
[2:22:50] amen amen we cast out
[2:22:53] Devils because it's in the
[2:22:55] word amen well we don't need things like
[2:22:58] that now brother Tim that's but that's
[2:23:00] not what Paul said he said I would that
[2:23:02] you all speak with Tong but rather that
[2:23:03] you prophesied right he he concludes a
[2:23:07] discourse on on the gifts and the use
[2:23:09] and he says wherefore brother covet to
[2:23:10] prophesy and forbid not to speak with
[2:23:13] tongues well our emphasis brother Tim is
[2:23:16] no longer on Divine Healing that's right
[2:23:19] and the Great Divine healing movement is
[2:23:21] over that's right and and but as long as
[2:23:25] we got needs in our
[2:23:27] body come on now we still need Divine
[2:23:32] Healing and guess what it's a part of
[2:23:34] the word you can't have it all and not
[2:23:38] have Divine
[2:23:40] Healing I tell you if your daughter was
[2:23:43] grievously vexed of a devil wouldn't you

[2:23:53] don't know who you who we is but it
[2:23:55] ain't
[2:24:00] me cuz the older I get the more I
[2:24:04] realize I need
[2:24:07] it sure the emphasis on having the
[2:24:10] fullness of the word but with the word
[2:24:12] comes the fullness of the power the full
[2:24:15] word is born in the manifestation again
[2:24:18] and Vindicated by the spirit of God full
[2:24:20] strength as it was here on the earth you
