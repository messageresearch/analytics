this message is not in a decline amen but god is raising up a bride amen amen glory be to god one other thing uh that we'd announce and we'll we'll be in touch through that mailing list that's on that website uh our other big youth event that we try to put on every year is a is a youth banquet right around valentine's day weekend and so you're invited to that as well amen now we just changed the order and i want to get out of the way amen but i just want to i just want to speak about amen the move of god last night amen that was real that was real amen you know we had some meetings at brother nathan bryant's church there in indiana a few weeks ago and brother wayne preached a wonderful service there and there was a sister got up and testified we had a prayer line saturday night a sister gave a testimony an older sister she said i was there in 1965 in brother branham's prayer line in the state of california i believe she took her daughter through her son through something like that and she said what we what we experienced tonight she said it was just exactly the same as it moved in brother brown's prayer line you know why that is it's the same god it's not a it's not a different amen it's the pillar of fire amen amen and so we can lay claim to reality amen i can testify to you that in that prayer line virtue was flowing out amen young people were being touched lives were being changed things of eternal value were being accomplished amen it's more than emotion something way down on the inside is happening the transforming power of god glory be to god and so we can testify that this is that which was prophesied of a bride that would come in the last days and the son of man ministry would continue on in her voice [Applause] hallelujah as she would do the greater works hallelujah so i encourage you young people if you've had an experience from the lord this weekend go home and feed that experience with the word of god get into this message amen because i'll tell you one thing that fire on the inside of you let that spark that dynamics touch the mechanics of this word amen there will be a power coming to that there will be a movement there will be a change in your life a lasting effect feed that experience amen god bless you we'll turn it over to the song leader amen let's enter in together one more time amen and prepare ourselves for the

it's an honor and a privilege to be here we want to thank true word tabernacle for this opportunity brother ray and everyone working with you amen i know the work that goes into these meetings it's not easy actually i find this is a lot easier amen but uh amen brother ben i want to thank you for that calm song service amen that's the way i like it worshiping the lord and giving god if he if there's anybody worth praising is him [Music] hallelujah you know i think if the world can get all caught up in the football gods or this god or some other god i just don't see a reason why the children of god can't worship the one true living god with all their heart with all their might with everything that they have let every breath that has that everyone that hath breath praise ye the lord hallelujah amen let's just borrow our heads if you have a need you want to make it known to him i know god did some wonderful things many wonderful things last night we're here to rejoice in the goodness of god this morning amen won't you just lay one hands on one another and let's just pray together pretty soon we'll be getting on buses getting in vans and cars going back to our homes and some are going back to churches maybe with not very many young people some are going back to some serious situations won't you pray for the one next to you say god just move on their lives keep them lord amen you open your voice and speak to the creator for a moment father lord jesus we want to thank you for this opportunity we've had this weekend lord to come together father and to put our licks of fire together and lord to worship around your word and to see the great miraculous god move in our midst lord it just moves our hearts to think of all the goodness you've bestowed upon us lord that you've given us the victories lord you've given in lives father what a mighty god you are lord you see these young people father going back home to go to schools to work homes fathers some go into homes maybe that mom and dad don't serve the lord some go into places of difficulties and situations i ask god that you'll be with him father lord may that light burn ever brighter father as it would go into different places lord and may that light begin to consume lord those that are around them father lord in light the fire even greater lord father i know this bride is not going down in defeat but lord we're going to rise up we're going to go into the change of our bodies lord and i believe there's young people that's going to step lord from a young body and to an another eternal young body lord there's gonna be young people that's overcome just like daniel and three hebrew children overcame in their day mary who said be it unto me according to thy word father you have young people in this age that we're living in lord that's going to overcome lord i believe i'm looking at those this morning and i know you're here this morning too just put a song in our hearts father a song for the battle lord that we're going to go through because we know father we're going to go through more battles we're going to go through more temptations mind battles are still going to be there devils are still going to try to come and scratch out our doors but lord your word said you're going to surround us with songs of deliverance let deliverance arise in our hearts today we pray commit this time into your hands in jesus name amen amen how many can say praise the lord amen turn in your bibles to psalms chapter 40 and also isaiah 61. i'm actually sharing something with you that's very close to me this morning because as i was sitting in in the service for the memorial service of my mom the lord would drop this thought into my heart for this service amen and i just pray the lord to help me this morning to deliver psalms 40 and verse 1 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up out of a horrible pit out of the mirey clay and he set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord amen isaiah 61 and verse 1. the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prisons of them that are bound them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord or the jubilee and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to point unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified amen god bless you you can be seated this morning i'd like to speak to you on a new song to sing a new song to sing amen you know as we look in the scripture here david knew what it was like to be in some low places you could read as read as the history of him as he would go through life's journey he'd find himself in caves he would find himself in hiding he would find himself even after he became king to be a rejected king he knew what it's like to be in a horrible pit and mary clay you know there's something that he seemed like he couldn't get out of on his own and but god came on the scene many times for david and he would take him and take him out of those situations in the miraculous ways we could you know we could read about it and and it's been mentioned here this weekend already of zig lag where he would go and he would come back and he'd find us that ziglag was burned and women as women were taken captive and and david and his men you know came to the city and it was their wives were gone their sons and their daughters were gone and david and the people that were with with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no power to weep so he knew what it was like to cry he knew what it was like to be in a depressed situation or or under a spirit of heaviness and that and to be honest with you that's a real prevalent spirit in the age that we live in it's a spirit of heaviness it's a spirit of it's also in that as a spirit of anxiety and fear i mean i these brothers up here could testify of how many that comes into up for prayer for anxiety and fear it's a prevalent a spirit in the age that we're living in but there's something that's greater than that spirit amen and david would find himself in this moment and even even where you know his own men would turn against him and think of stone in him and and here the scripture would say david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stone in him because the soul of all the people was so grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god amen i want you to understand there's only one place to find true encouragement it's not on facebook it's not on some social media you know somebody likes your pages enough or somebody that's not true encouragement but what's true encouragement is this word of god now we're not going to get up here and try to tell you that you're going to go home and there's not going to be no more devil there's not going to be no more mind battles there's not going to be any more spirits that comes against you amen they're going to be here until the end amen we're going to face these things you're going to go home and there's going to be that same devil there you're going to go home they're going to be that same spirit that tries to come you're going to go home and there's going to be those things around you but there's going to you're going to go home and there's a different spirit on the inside of you amen where you will not no longer look for temporary things to bring temporary pleasures or temporary happiness or temporary joy that's not what we're looking at we're looking for eternal happiness and eternal joy and that can only be found in something that is eternal amen and so david encouraged himself in the lord his god and you know what brother bannon would say even in 56 he would say many are becoming discouraged he said you know when we become discouraged it takes our strength from us it takes our ability to fight you know we just want to give up we you know satan pulls you away and he'll try that when you get home and begin you begin to think that nobody cares and nobody understands and nobody's worried about your situation he said but what we need to do is take courage we need to be encouraged trials may come he said we've never ever promised to be immune from trials but he promised he would give you the grace to go through the trial amen if the mountain's too high if the door is too deep or too wide he will give you the grace to go through it don't worry keep your eyes on christ for he's the only one he's the only one that can take you through so when you're discouraged that's when the devil tries to really pour it upon you and when it's when he tries to get you if you can come to church and say well i don't know i don't know if i'll get any better i don't know if i i've been prayed for and i still got this issue he said don't be discouraged encourage yourself in the lord your god amen because god is there to fight your battles i want you to understand children of god you're not standing alone the devil may try to tell you you're standing alone until you're all by yourself but there's a greater host that's here among us than the number that are here with us that we can see with our visible eye there's angels of god chariots of fire the power of god the holy spirit that is moving in his people leading us on to the promised land we're not in this battle alone we're not fighting alone we're not by ourself it's not just me and somebody else but god is with me god is with you he'll go on the bus with you he'll get in the car with you he'll be in your room when you get home this god will never leave you this god will never forsake you amen this god is here for you in the worst trials of your life i'm a witness of that god will go through with you through the darkest moments of your life and he will give you a song for the battle hallelujah he said god doesn't want you to be frowning amen you know it was something this young person always stuck with me brother john lafontaine would always say this he said are you happy and notify your face amen mean god wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't ever be upset just walk with god knowing that you're walking with him nothing can harm you as long as you're with him nothing can harm you hallelujah i'm glad i'm with him i'm not just with a preacher i'm not just here because i'm a preacher's son i'm not here just because i'm just you know i'm a certain person on a certain street no i am with jesus jesus has brought me safely this far and jesus is going to take me all the way home hallelujah don't you know who got you here the one who got you here is more than enough power to take you from this place through every trial through every temptation through every struggle through every mind battle through every situation in your life there is a power that's greater than the enemy you face you are not going home alone you're going with jesus and if god be for you who can be against you [Applause] hallelujah there's neither powers there's no thing's presence there's nothing future coming nothing can separate us from him we are in him hallelujah we didn't come in by our own will he's by his choice he elected us he brought us to himself it is his business to take care of what he took for himself no man can pluck them from my father's hand for he's the greatest of them all it's a father who takes care of you and who's got any who's got any more power than god so what kind of power have you got over you that right there now this morning i'll tell you what kind of power it is it's the power that created that sun that's still hanging in space it's the power that created this earth that's still standing here amen earthquakes just try to destroy tsunamis has tried to destroy but it's still hanging in this place stars are still hanging there by the power of god that's the same power let there be light that is over your life in this evening time it's the same word it's the same power it's the same anointing that's standing there and the sun spoke into existence and is still there today millions or however many years ago since it was spoken to the place and you can try to put it out you can try clouds can try to cover it up but it's still there it still remains and i want to tell you children of god the devil will come again and he'll try to put depression over you he'll try to put anxiety over you he'll try to put every kind of mind battle in your mind but you shall remain not because i said it he said it and he's the final word for your life [Applause] amen you need to tell that devil this morning i shall remain what kind of power is over you oh my but god will test his people every child that comes to god must be tested no exceptions he said maybe tonight you're sick or just to have a little child training just a little testing but don't be discouraged god is still on the throne he knows all things he's still in control he said if you were truly born of the spirit of god everything's working together for your good he's going to make everything right god promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep his word he kept it for thousands of years to every believer why would you be any exception why would you be an exception we are no exception he that kept abraham will keep you he that kept moses will keep you he that kept shamgar will keep you or you might have to fight but he'll keep you he that kept david will keep you he that kept the daniel in the lion's den he'll keep you he that kept the three hebrew children he'll keep you he that kept peter he'll keep you he that kept paul and all those down to the dark cages he will keep you don't be discouraged there's another quote don't be discouraged we're living in a terrible hour that's enough to be discouraged about a terrible hour for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour for the believer because we are near the end [Applause] we're looking for the coming of our blessed lord jesus christ it's like i told my sisters or as we stood around the bedside of my mom i said we are the lucky ones because we don't have it just a few moments we ain't got 60 years i don't believe we ain't got 20 years 10 years five years i believe in just any moment we're the lucky ones we're right here at the last time i believe there's gonna be a funeral one day when they put that seed in the ground it's gonna pop right back up and say it's time to go home i believe that's how close we are [Applause] hallelujah but god will give you a soul god will give you a rejoicing in your heart that you can take back from this camp god gave me a song i'd be a brother ron spencer's and i would be ministering on a on god answer that god did answers you know my mom was had just come out of the hospital and she's having a hard time with things we didn't really let all out what was happening just asking for prayer and i'm ministering on the god that answers how he answers an unexpected time an unexpected place in an unexpected way and i get down to the end of it and i walk out in front of brother ron's pulpit and i walk away from my ipad that's laying there and i begin to talk about the three hubert children how they come down into the moment their last step into the fire brother brown said brother brown said when gabriel come to god said have you been watching down there he said yeah i've been watching he's i've been seeing what's going on he said i've been watching it all take place gabriel said well i got my sword drawn send me down there he said no no no you've been a good angel and wormwood come and he said i'm the i'm the angel over the floods i'll put the fire out and he said no no y'all been good angels he said but this ain't your job this is my job and he said he took off those robes and he laid him down and he grabbed the east and the west wind and he grabbed a zigzag of light and as they took their last step into the fire sometimes he'll let you get there they got to their last step in the fire and all of a sudden there was not three men in there there was four men in there and as i'm telling that my eye my ipad laying on the pulpit begins to switch over out of my notes onto an app onto the message and picks out a message and pushes play in the middle of 56 brother brad was preaching the sermon the worst center in the city and at the very beginning he begins to speak i'm standing here and i hear a voice and i'm like what's going on i'm looking around it was an unexpected place an unexpected time in an unexpected way and the voice begins to speak instead of something that is my favorite of the hymns he said because it expresses his extreme deity especially in the hour that we're living in he said people wants to make him just a prophet but he's more than a prophet he's god that him happened to be down from his glory now in my mind and my hope and my faith i'm believing and speaking about my mama that she's going to come out and without a smell of smoke on her and be healed she was she got the best healing she could ever get because she went to a place saying a devil in hell can touch her they ain't a brain bleed can touch her they ain't a devil that can torment her in her mind no more his power over her is finished but god was showing me you're about to walk in the fire but i'm with you you're about to be in a fire but i'm with you i have come down i have come down to show you who i am in my voice this morning i want to scream out oh how i love him oh how i adore him my life my everything my all in be the all of the lord i would fly home in a few weeks as i'm landing my mom's going back in the hospital she stayed in there and she never came out she was in there five weeks that later on that week as i would get home i would go with my wife and we would pray with her in the icu she wouldn't even respond to even what it was praying you know my mom wasn't like that if you prayed for her sometimes she'd out pray you just who she was she would she didn't even really act like she knew i was praying for and the next day me and my father would go in there and we'd pray for her again she didn't yet and spoke in like 18 hours or so and she's she's there in that mom in that condition looking around has this brain bleed going on in her brain dad we pray for him dad goes into the restroom i said mom look me in the face we locked eyeball to eyeball and i said i want you to understand i know he's come down in the fire i said because it's been personally revealed to me down from his glory i was talking to her and she ain't spoken 17 hours and she's looking me eyeball to eyeball and all of a sudden out of her mouth began to sing down from his glory everliving story my god and savior came and jesus was his name born in a manger to his own stranger the man of sorrows tears in agony she sang that verse he didn't say it she sang it better than what i just did all of a sudden she began to sing oh how i love him tears began to come in their eyes and she broke and she started praying and she said oh how i love you oh i watched a woman live what was in amen hebrews 11 by faith she could go right there and she is there in hebrews 12 the cloud of witnesses oh hallelujah i can hear her voice this morning amen is this screaming out to you young people don't give up don't turn around don't stop it's worth it it's worth it amen it's worth every mind battle she had them she knew what it was like it's worth every sickness it's worth every trial it's worth every trouble all to just experience what i'm experiencing this morning oh how i love him [Applause] i trust that you can have that song in your heart when you leave here maybe you come here loving something else but i say god may you leave in jesus name loving him more than you ever loved him serving him greater than you ever served him with all your heart with all your passion with everything you got [Applause] it's a wonderful hour for a believer david had a choice you're at a choice do i go home and continue or do i make a decision i'm taking a different road some of you need to go out and go home and clean out your closets he said well i love god no you don't not when you love the world that's what the bible says so if you really found the love in your heart it's time to get rid of all that stuff video games i'd trash them hey i'm going to be very honest with you this morning amen video games i'd trash them make up trashed tight clothes trashed and that's for boys or girls [Applause] hey don't you understand what's happening boys laodicea is trying to turn you into a bunch of sissies trying to turn you into a bunch of look like a bunch of homosexuals that's not who you are i'm not here to look like that i'm not here to dress like sodom i'm not here to copy what they're doing that's not my world my world's in glory [Applause] when does it become a cool thing that our boys are wearing these old tight gym clothes showing every bulger thing i'm going to try to give you a new song to sing because your song's been laodicea you've been singing the songs of laodicea and how great their fabs are and how great their fashions are and how great their men are i want to be just like mike well he's gone and retired that's my day whoever it is kobe's dead i don't even know who it is now i want to be just like them that's what you say well not my heart what you're doing on the outside shows what your heart is hey i mean we got we can't even get our gym clothes to go all the way down to our ankles no but we want to wear shorts so bad well i got socks that comes up i know i'm probably stepping on some toes but your stove your toes need to be stepped on because i'm not going to stand in the day of judgment and say i should have said it who are you representing who are you showing what what kingdom are you from hallelujah you know and that's the truth brothers i can't get off of it we get we've been on our sisters for a long time do this do this to be honest with you let me just put it this way the message is not a bunch of rules and regulations the message is a life and if you got the life you won't have no problem with any kind of thing the word says but if you don't have the life you'll still have makeup if you don't have the life you'll still trim your hair if you don't have a life you'll still wear them tight pants if you don't have the life you'll still look like sodom if i was you i'd go take those clothes and i would burn them [Applause] cause that's not who you are [Applause] let me give you a new song to see i am redeemed bought with a price jesus gave his whole life for me that's who i am david had a decision would he go deeper worry would he worry more would he be distressed more depression more but david turns towards encouragement not only to be encouraged but there was no one around him who could or would or did that for him but to encourage himself hello somebody oh if i could just get a text if i could just get somebody to like my post i'd be encouraged who says that friend on facebook really is your friend the world wants to call them all friends they ain't all friends but what did david do he turned to the word he found his encouragement in the lord amen for david had a covenant got with god and so david's situation made it god's situation david's trouble made it god's trouble because he had a covenant with god amen we'll never get to the solution of our problems and the solution of our situation until you get your focus off of your problem and get it back on your god too many people are trying to find a solution for the church problems and try to find a solution for this and they got this nag and that thing going over there and always got something going on why because their focus is not right if they would put it on the word of god they wouldn't see all the things that's going on around them and if they did they would pray about it the discouragement don't come from the lord it comes from my adversary the devil that's why david could encourage himself in the lord anxiety worry fretting discouragement indicates we're walking by sight and not by faith let me read you a couple of things brother branham and and discernment lines would say let's let us say praise be to god oh my that is what we need this is the time is this the patient how do you do sister you're an awful deep thinker got a weary spirit always worrying about things you got no business to worrying about you're nervous upset caused you to have acid in your blood which give you arthritis the devil did meant no you did it all right come lady you're a very deep thinker you're sincere with all your heart but it's caused you to be a nervous person you're very nervous you're always taking other people's problems and thinking about that and crossing bridges before you get to it building things that never happen and it's developed a stomach trouble for you there's hundreds of them go look them up not just women there's men too amen paul but paul said we walk by faith and not by sight so that was his source of stability and strength when we walk by faith we're putting confidence in our god not confidence in me but confidence in our god when we find ourselves in discouragement we need to find out where am i going to place my trust where am i going to rest at well when the circumstances of life pressed into david david would press into his benefits he knew he had some benefits laying in there bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your iniquities who heals all your diseases who redeems your life from destruction who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like eagles so stop giving voice to your discouragement and start giving voice to the encouragement stop repeating the lies of the devil and start speaking the promises of god listen these promises are not for just preachers to speak it's for you to speak it's for you to put it in your mouth your mountain knows your voice well brother timothy i don't know about all this weekend of meetings and all this worked up emotion is that what you want to call it i'm not sick of that devil been hanging around the skirts of the message hanging around the outward looking around seeing if they can find fault and failure why don't you go back to your denomination because you ain't never left it amen we we want to this we want to try to make it where our kids can't have the same experiences the same moments with the lord and and pull out all of the moving of the spirit preach it right preach it right out of the pool right out of the church from the pulpit people today are still suffering from things that were said amen against the movement of the spirit i mean them against the movement of god and they don't even know how to react when the spirit of god moves to the building scared they might be out of order scared they might be doing something wrong scared scared scared worried word word i know there's a cloud that wants to hang around you and says you're getting a little emotional you're getting a little fanatical you're getting pentecost well i don't know who said this but i thought it was pretty good if i'm truly azusa street pentecost at least i'm a couple of church ages past where you're at [Applause] you want to be a lutheran go ahead and be a lutheran you know but i know that's not who we are because there's a word a revealed word in our hour there's a mighty angel in our midst god himself has come down from his glory and been revealed in the people and you mean to tell me when the king of kings comes in i can't act like they did when they were there in the streets of jerusalem shouting singing hosanna blessed it be the name of the lord hosanna but you know there were some lutherans there too they were called pharisees won't you make them shut up don't let them sing that song that song ain't right we've legit legislated the moving of the spirit right out of our churches and call it god that's not god that's the antichrist amen because i know what this god does i know how he changed my life i know what he did to that little redheaded boy standing a man standing over there when he was a redheaded boy and a rascal and god chased him forever and stood before you last night [Applause] i know what he did for brother way every one of these brothers god come down a miraculous way are we supposed to sit around and twiddle our thumbs act like nothing's going on act like the king of kings ain't in our midst you know we had a camp there for a few years a family camp in our our area of course we couldn't have meetings in our church because it's too small and this man is nazarene camp matter of fact and this man came and he sat in the back of our meetings they had a tomb not a tombstone but a marker said buddy robinson preached here go read buddy robinson's testimony of what the what they used to act like he said he came there hey i can't even remember it go read it he said by the time i do remember this he said by the time the preacher was done preaching and screaming he said i thought he was going to scream until the tent flaps blew out and the trees was going to be laid down around he said something got a hold of me and something got a hold of another man i can't remember buddy robinson or this other man one of them skimming up the tree that was holding up the tent and screaming to the light singing and shouting yeah because what was happening life was passing through the body and here this man walks in the back of our camp takes in a couple of services it's tears streaming down his eyes he walks up to brother daryl i believe it was one of our deacons and he said brother he said we used to have services just like that he said whatever you do don't lose that ain't that amazing a nazarene would say whatever you do don't lose that a nazarene would say it and we got preachers of the message that says it ain't right so-called preachers of the message well i can tell you what david did when david saw the word being restored coming back in this position and into his place oh that was that was a good service brother priest you preached a good one no david got excited he got to rejoicing he got to shouting he got to having a good time got to dancing around that ark because he saw it coming back because he knew what was with that heart was the blessings of god was with that ark where the word is the blessings are and he got to rejoicing but you do know do you realize there was somebody that was very close to david david's own wife that stood there and criticized somebody very close to david it wasn't it ain't been the pentecostals necessarily or even that nazarene's been encouraging us but it's those that are close to us wants to look in on cameras and and mock the very moving of the holy ghost and try to put a cloud on you and say it ain't so but what happened to that her wound was sealed and she never brought forth fruit those that want to criticize the movement of god and say it's a bunch of fanaticism and call it a dirty name pinnacle when when in the world is the word pentecost become a dirty word it's not a dirty word i it identifies me with men on the day of pentecost even those men in the zoo's tree was really wonderful god called me in [Applause] but that's not who we are we are of the original vine the original seed the original life the original word their womb is being sealed they've taken on the creeds of man man made creeds and dogmas can't even produce a quote for what he says he believes i say if you don't like what you've been seeing keep watching there's going to be not less healings there's going to be more healings there's going to be more deliverances there's going to be more prodigals returned there's going to be more holy ghosts there's going to be more power there's going to be more anointing there's going to be more worship [Applause] hallelujah it's going to be more worship because i know what he did for me i know he's been through the fire with me i know he's been watching me he's been all over me he's been protecting me hallelujah you know even brother branham found himself in that seat there for a moment you know the story he found himself so i want to say this because i'm praying there's hope for those that are in this seat that they'll find themselves and realize what they've been doing brother brown said he was teaching on some things on the second coming of christ he said he had a pretty good long service about four hours four and a half hours and he's going to have a little halftime he said oh boy that gets some people nervous they were singing a special there's some people come from louisville and four gospel people said they had a special something some young young ladies wanted some little tin cans and things that had the washboard some thimbles on it the fingers they was playing in this washboard so i guess you've seen the hookup one was playing was going to play the piano and they started playing that song there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by well that's something to get excited about and this little lady turned real white around the mouth and began to beat that piano said i believe if they had three decks of keys should have played every one of them so i never seen such playing in my life and the lady on that watch board and hitting them thimbles little blond-headed sister about so high jumped out on the floor and started dancing and i was sitting there i said oh my here it is why'd they have to do that so i weighed and looked around the people and looked up to me and i looked around i thought well i'm a fundamentalist you couldn't show that to me in the bible he said there's a whole lot of things that us fundamentalists don't even know that's in there man if a prophet could have that honesty he said so i looked around i thought well my where did dancing ever come from i was sitting there in the seat of the scornful of course you know but listen to this statement not saying nothing i was afraid to say something because i was afraid they might be right and i might be wrong apparently there's some people that ain't afraid of being wrong amen but the prophet of god said i was afraid because they might be right he said now isn't that terrible i thought in the next thought though i thought well isn't that terrible right there in my tabernacle another place you'd say they're making my tabernacle or a tavern so there's a little lady out there just their eyes closed dancing around first thing you know what another one started i thought oh my so then i began to rehearse in my mind that in the bible they they did dance and i thought well when they dance what was it dancing spoke of when pharaoh was pursuing israel and all the enemy was drowned and marian picked up a tambourine and began to beat that tambourine and begin to dance and all the daughters of israel followed her dance and i thought well well they had the victory and i read what david when the ark was been coming along when he seen it returning back he got so happy he started dancing what was it he had victory his sweetheart made fun of him well you don't like that watch this and down around he went again i thought well she sat up there and laughed and god put a curse on her but he said david is a man after my own heart and i thought well that's the only thing that's the matter with me i just ain't got enough dancing or enough victory maybe he said a few minutes something happened he said my methodist foot got the patent [Applause] he said this might shock you but when i come to myself i was out there with that little girl dancing on the floor just the thing i thought i wouldn't do i did he said i never danced in my life i've never been on a dance floor in my life but i guess i did all right i sure felt awful good because i had a lot of victory after that you say what's all this dancing being around because there's some young people that saw depression laying on the floor anxiety laying on the floor fear laying on the floor every spirit of hell that they had been coming in here with [Applause] but they came into this camp and they put on the garment of praise [Applause] because i seen the king was here and they begin to praise the king of kings and the lord of lords [Applause] hallelujah there were some daughters of god that saw that devil that had tormented him in their night watches when he was down in the valley when he was all by themselves laying there dead oh hallelujah if some of you could ever see that critical spirit dead it'll put a dance in your feet if you could ever see that spirit of god moving upon your heart there'd be something moving you there'd be an amen that would be a shout of the king [Applause] put on the garment of praise [Applause] cast down that spirit of heaviness cast down that anxiety and fear and say devil i'm done with you i'm done with your mind battles i'm done with the spirits of hell i'm going on with jesus [Music] well victory is my victory is mine there you go victory today today is the hour today is a moment [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh some of you in the back will realize god's still god he wasn't just god when you gave your heart at an altar but he's still god today and he can come and give you a refilling of the baptism of the holy ghost that'll put a pep in your stem that'll cause you to walk amen to cause you to talk cause you to go on with jesus maybe you found yourself in some stagnated condition i said get out in the name of jesus christ come to the living waters come get a drink [Applause] here's a sister that put a walker aside is there somebody else that i want to drink hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wave that garment of praise you come in here waving depression it ain't there no more you come waving fear it ain't there no more you come waving every kind of sin of the devil it ain't well no more but i'm gonna wave the garment of praise i'm gonna give my god glory i'm gonna give him honor i'm gonna give him everything let's do his lovely name you know in the south we've got this saying maybe it's around here too i bet he's singing a different tune now you know why we say that because somebody has had a radical event change in their life because he's now acting different it's causing him to act different because of this life-altering event he can no longer sing the same song because it don't apply guess what depression it don't apply guess what hell it don't apply but i will praise the mighty name of jesus i will sing how great is our god this new song is a way of saying i have met the creator of the entire interview of our universe it has been a life-changing experience and i will never be the same therefore i'll sing a new song because my desires have changed oh hallelujah you know me and brother andrew last night went home drunk i'm sure there was a lot of you that went home drunk got a little bit of i had a hard time

enemy in the greatness of thy excellence thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentence forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and when the blasts of our nostrils the waters were gathered together and the flood stood up when the enemy comes in like a flood i raised the standard up and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea and the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide my lust shall be satisfied i'll draw my sword my hand shall destroy them when they get home i'm going to get them but thou didst blow with i win that's what we witnessed last night a rushing mighty wind thou didst blow with thy wind and the sea covered them you know what the sea represents it represents the blood of jesus many types in that sea what's sin what's in oh

edom shall be amazed and the mighty men are moab fear and dread shall follow them follow them by the greatness of that harm they shall be as still as stone until thy people pass over o lord to the people passover thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance in the place o lord which i was made thee and to dwell in in the sanctuary oh lord thou hast which our hands have established and the lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in his chariots and his horsemen and the lord brought the waters of the sea over them but the children of israel walked on dry land and about that time that was more than mariam could take she happened to catch a glimpse over there that one's floating around that'd take that whip and beat her try to keep her from making it she almost did him get on that bus he was beating her so bad mind battles and every kind of thing trying to hold him i saw him last night even trying to beat him as he was coming into the line and trying to make him come from getting into that presence but they came anyways [Applause] you know how dumb the devil is you know how dumb the devil is he'll chain himself to you he'll chain himself to you and he'll come along with some kind of situation and he'll grab a hold of you and he'll try to start pulling you and trying to pull you through this but next thing you so you hear the word of god and you start pulling him to an altar you start pulling him to a place and you pull him right to the place of your deliverance to the place of his death i saw demons that were chained they had changed themselves to young people but it wasn't for that young person destruction it was for their deliverance and god in this moment they walked in with sorrows they walked in with doubts they walked in with prayer but all kind of things of depression anxiety legalism lust pornography but they came out on the other side do i got a witness here tonight this morning i got somebody said yep that was me i was there i know what god did for me got a few more minutes brother brown said them old egyptian taskmasters drove them people to do things they were burdened to do after they looked back in that red sea they found them everyone drowned no wonder moses could sing a new song no wonder he could sing in the spirit oh miriam picked up a tambourine and began to beat the tambourine and run down the banks rejoicing if that ain't an old holy ghost meeting i ain't never seen one the daughters of israel following her do the same thing why because they had overcome and he said a man who never knows what it's like to live a victorious life he'll never know it until he completely overcomes who himself the biggest enemy you got is yourself that's the reason you can't rise up in faith because you've got too many intellectuals now listen to this i thought this was amazing with last night he said the intellectual part says well this or that but faith says this is that [Applause] oh my we can read in revelations 5 and verse 1. i saw a right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written therein and on the backside seal with seven seals this is for you young people amen i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look they're wrong and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither looked their own but one of the elders said we've not john we've not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david have prepared prevailed to open the book and the loose the seals thereof and i'll be held and though in the midst of the throne of four beasts in the midst of the elder stood a lamb it was time to quit looking upon their worthiness or their unworthiness it was time to start looking at the worthiness of the lamb hallelujah the lamb that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god he came and took the book out of the right hand and sat on the throne and when he took the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having won every one of harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals for thou slain and has redeemed us unto god by thy blood out of every kindred tongue people and nation and hath made us unto our gods kings and priests and we shall reign upon the earth and i beheld and heard the voice of many angels round the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a quite timid voice a loud voice worthy is lamb worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing listen to this and every creature which was in heaven and on earth and under the earth such are in sea and all that are in them heard i say that's a loud shout out as a loud shout blessing and honor and glory and power unto the lamb and the four beasts said amen i want you to understand what heaven is saying about your worship amen amen keep pressing on it's for you it's for you quit singing the song of unworthiness and start singing the lambs worthy quit singing about what you've done start singing about what he's already done it's not what you've made yourself it's what he made you he chose you he said your mind he said your mind he said your mind he said brother timothy i got a lot of things in my life i got a lot of weirdness i got this i got that whatever it doesn't matter what you are what matters he chose you oh my and he hath made you kings and priests that's a different song that's a song of rulership that's a song of of dominion and power he hath made us he hath made it salvation is his doing it's not man's doing it's his doing and he has redeemed you for a purpose right now we reign with christ have a dominion over sin see if there's anything worth shouting in here about have dominion over sin over the world over the flesh and over the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure he has made us priests offering a spiritual praise of sacrificed lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and kings and our god no wonder the world does not appeal to us we're a peculiar people zealous under good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto a father get these scriptures up as we finish this up go ahead and ask i'm not going to get quite close but i'm asking musicians to come oh sing unto the lord psalm 98 and verse 1 o singing to the lord a new song for he has done marvelous things is that your testimony this morning he's done marvelous things his right hand his holy arm has gotten him the victory the lord has made him known his salvation his righteousness as he openly showed inside of the heathen he has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of israel oh the ends of the earth has seen the salvation of our god make a joyful noise unto the lord all the earth and make a loud noise and make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise sing unto the lord with the heart with the voice of song with trumpets with the sound of cornet make a joyful noise of the lord your king let the sea roar and the fullness thereof and the world mercy jesus and we want a quiet little service you know there's a man that was criticizing brother bran was preaching mainly criticizing those that were shouting a man and he said he told that man he said listen here he said that made him chills run up and down your back you're gonna freeze to death when you get to heaven he said well it's kind of funny to me i heard them y'all just out there at that ball game shouting and carrying on and you mean to tell me we can't do that this is the quietest place you're ever going to live because if you make it to heaven there's going to be shouting there's going to be praises if you make it to hell there's going to be groaning and gnashing of teeth but i say with all my heart prepare yourself to enter into the gates of praise enter into the glories of the lord we're going to have an eternal camp meeting what a time is going to be brother wayne brother jonathan when we ain't tired no more we ain't weary no more there ain't no brain bleeds there there ain't no cancer there there ain't no devils of sorrow there ain't no devils of any kind anymore we're free from every criticism we're free from everything the man tries to put down on our necks we're free to worship the king of king and the lord of lords let the sea roar let the floods clap let the heels be joyful psalms 149 and verse 1 says praise ye the lord sing unto the lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the saints that israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of zion be joyful in their king let them praise his name and death it's in the bible i know some of them church of christ messages people i ain't making fun of you i'm calling out that spirit i'm sick of it wants to wall up the praises of almighty god if you don't want it just go ahead and let me have it if you don't want to give it to him let me give it to him if you don't want to glorify him i'm going to glorify because i know if i don't if you don't there's going to be some rocks cry out and as long as i'm alive i'm going to glorify the king of kings and the lord of the lord they ain't a rock there in a tree they ain't a hill they ain't an ocean in the earth that's going to take my praise and take my place and given my god glory and giving him honor oh my let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand so fight and praise praise and fight this is what he told nehemiah told them when they went to rebuke build the walls of jerusalem he said you put a stone in one hand and put it on the wall but you have a sword in the other amen because handbook ballot now his his cronies was trying to come in and destroy the work of god still at work for god has taken pleasure in his people oh my he will beautify the meek with salvation let the saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of god be in their mouth and the two edges sword in

iron to execute upon the judgment written this honor of havoc have all his saints praise you the lord praise you the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise

he's been good to me you say well you lost your mama he's been good to me he's kept me he's kept me in the valley he's kept me in the mouth i found out he's not just god on the mountain he's god in the valley he's god no matter where i go he's not just god in this building at a youth camp with all these around you he's god in your bedrooms he's god where you're in your personal time he's god in every moment he's god in every situation i tell you what you need to do when that spirit of heaven starts trying to come around just lift up those hands i saw what it would do got a minute i don't know maybe what y'all expected with a man just lost his mama to come up here and preach to you but i've never been in a more exciting place in all my life my mom walked in victory she would have her first brain bleed and she had lost her sight on the peripheral vision and things and she was in a bad situation couldn't take care of herself it's been about six years ago almost to the dot she was in her bedroom thinking about things spirit of heaviness he was trying to sit down on her my youngest sister bethany and her husband mike was living upstairs there because he was building a house and she bethany come in to check on her little drew dexter was there a little 18 month old boy that never walked never crawled maybe pulled up once or twice on the side of a furniture but just a few days before that a few months before that he'd been seen in a vision walking my sister comes in that bedroom and she puts him out in the middle of the floor and she goes over to check on mom and my mom began to think of the goodness of god how god had spared her life and how god had watched over her and god had took care of her and here she was and all of a sudden she just began to lift up those hands and she began to praise she began to glorify and as she did her sight came back and as she did that little boy that was out there in the middle of a floor never walked never crawled stood up and began to run all over that house oh my that reminds me of a paul and silas one time that found themselves in a bad situation but they turned their eyes away from the things around them the prison walls and everything that was around them and paul looked at those silas and said let's have some little praise going on i'm sick of hearing all this moaning i'm sick of hearing we can't take it i'm sick of hearing we'll never get out of here i'm sick of hearing there ain't no rapture i'm sick of hearing there ain't no healings i'm sick of hearing all this i'm gonna praise my god and while i praise he's gonna set ambushments around my enemy and he's going to destroy my enemy i'm going to give you a little ammunition amen it said when they sang praises they sing the passover psalms write it down it's psalms 113-118 and psalms 136 i'm going to read the first part of it because it's just too good to pass up praise ye the lord could you imagine and that's in that prison all of a sudden been moanings and cussings and cursings and i didn't deserve this and then i got blah blah all kinds of stuff church ain't never what i think it ought to be paul looked at old silence said you know what it's time to praise paul you're crazy you lost your mind you don't you see your beat don't you see you got scars don't you see you have problems and situation you can't get out i ain't worried

incidentally incidentally nathan is my grandson he came to the office before the service started and he said grandpa we can get the camp this year would it be all right to have a youth meeting and you know i wasn't even thinking you know how we're going to get all the help and everything i just said okay that'll be good that'll be fine but i stand amazed as a pastor how the church got behind him [Music] behind that desire and that burden and i know nathan has already thanked the people and and spoke about the people but i want to say that as a pastor i'm so proud of our local church people how they got behind this and put their hearts into it to make a success spiritually i say to god be the glory to god be their glory [Applause] i want to thank the ministers brother timothy brother andrew god bless you for your labors you know in the third exodus brotherhood said that pillar fire is with us to lead us onto the millennium you probably heard brother andrew and maybe you don't want

young people don't be afraid god is with you and he'll take you on you keep on praying for revelation because when that revelation that spiritual revelation hits you gates of hell can't prevail against it you know you can have this in your home church [Music] you can actually have this in your home church i mean we've had dancing in the spirit at the home church we've had a lot of shouting too so you don't have to wait for a camp meeting glory to god you are the church you are the church [Music] hallelujah [Music] he's not coming he's here he's here inside of you hallelujah it's pretty
