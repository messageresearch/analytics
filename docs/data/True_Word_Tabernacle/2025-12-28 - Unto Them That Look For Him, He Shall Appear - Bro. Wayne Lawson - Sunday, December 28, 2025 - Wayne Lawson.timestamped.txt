[0:45] [music] We
[0:49] are [singing]
[0:51] love. [music]
[0:56] I [music]
[0:58] love him

[1:06] first
[1:08] love
[1:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:17] [music]
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20] [singing]
[1:24] [music]
[1:29] [music]
[1:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. It's
[1:41] certainly a great honor to be gathered
[1:43] in the house of the Lord together and
[1:46] amen to see all the saints that [music]
[1:47] would be able to be out here this
[1:48] morning. Amen. And the blessing of the
[1:51] Lord. Amen. In our lives, his grace in
[1:53] our heart and Amen. What a what a
[1:55] tremendous time to serve the Lord with
[1:57] your families and [music] and the life
[1:59] that he's given us. Uh I think of the
[2:02] prophet when he says that there would
[2:04] this would be the day the greatest
[2:05] [music] day that it would be to serve
[2:07] him. He said I'd rather do it right now.
[2:10] And I think of all the ages and all the
[2:12] wonderful things that had happened down
[2:14] through the years. And then I think of a
[2:16] prophet that saw by vision many of the
[2:20] things that you read about in the Bible.
[2:22] And then he still said that this is the
[2:24] greatest time to live. So I I I think
[2:27] that it was a very informed [music]
[2:29] saying. So whatever he was seeing, I
[2:32] pray often, Lord, let me see what
[2:34] [music] he saw that makes him say things
[2:37] like that that that we would be able in
[2:39] this great dark hour and time that we'd
[2:41] be able to catch what it is, what kind
[2:44] of inspiration was on a prophet to make
[2:45] him say something of such of such
[2:48] powerful uh words. Amen. It's a as a a
[2:51] great blessing to be able to be together
[2:53] with the children of God. And uh I think
[2:55] I see [music] Canada showed up over
[2:57] here. And brother Jake, Amen. He's one
[2:59] of our he's one of our Canadian sheep.
[3:01] Amen. God bless you, brother Jake. And
[3:03] Amen. Sure. Welcome to be here this
[3:05] morning. And I think he brought a friend
[3:07] with him this time. God bless you,
[3:08] brother Jonathan. Sure. Good to see you
[3:09] today. And Amen. We're uh so blessed
[3:12] that they're able to be here. He gets to
[3:14] come down a couple times a year. So we
[3:16] we certainly love him and appreciate
[3:18] him. [music] Glad he could be here. and
[3:20] and all of you that are here this
[3:21] morning. I I got a niece here this
[3:23] morning just saying for you. It's sure
[3:24] good to have them here and Amen. They
[3:26] come up to visit us once in a while and
[3:29] Amen. I think the kids make [music] it
[3:30] hard on them to go home and Amen. But uh
[3:33] but uh we sure want to love everybody in
[3:35] a certain way and Amen. I I wish that
[3:38] there was room. Amen. and uh uh that you
[3:41] could you could spend as much time with
[3:43] every individual all the time every day
[3:46] and show love cuz this is to my heart uh
[3:49] the bride of Christ is the greatest
[3:52] thing on the face of the earth the cream
[3:54] [music] of the crop as a prophet would
[3:56] call it and amen and I I think you
[3:58] deserve the best. Amen. because you are
[4:01] the best. And I certainly believe that
[4:03] of of whatever the Lord has purchased
[4:05] with his own blood is quite precious.
[4:07] And we want to thank you for your time
[4:09] today. [music] We have a few things upon
[4:11] our heart. And we want to take some time
[4:13] this morning in the book of Hebrews. Um
[4:16] I uh I certainly uh appreciate the Lord
[4:19] for what he's been opening to us. And we
[4:22] have been preaching along and uh I think
[4:24] brother Carrie said we could just park
[4:25] here a while. So we we took you at it,
[4:27] Brother Carrie. We just parked in there
[4:29] and just staying on it a while. And so
[4:31] we're going to be in Hebrews chapter 9
[4:32] this morning. Amen. And uh uh
[4:35] [clears throat] this is this is a
[4:37] scripture
[4:38] uh that uh has has been a great
[4:41] inspiration to me through the years of
[4:44] studying the message of the hour. And
[4:46] it's odd to me how that uh things that
[4:49] that you might study regularly and not
[4:52] maybe realize the the weight of what
[4:54] you're actually reading until you start
[4:57] really nailing it down. And uh in a few
[5:00] years ago, this really took fire to me
[5:02] personally. And so, but as we're in the
[5:04] book of Hebrews, uh I want to cover this
[5:07] this morning from the 9th chapter in the
[5:10] 28th verse. Amen. And just before we
[5:12] read, let's just bow our hearts. Father,
[5:14] we're so thankful this morning, Lord,
[5:17] that you would give us the grace to
[5:19] stand here before your children today,
[5:21] Lord, as we stand here as a people. We
[5:24] look to you, Lord, knowing that, Father,
[5:27] that your grace and your mercy, Lord,
[5:29] the desire of our heart, Lord, is to be
[5:32] exactly what you'd have us to be. And
[5:35] Lord, we're asking you this morning that
[5:37] you would take from our heart all
[5:39] tradition, Lord. May you take from us
[5:41] all of our previous conceptions and
[5:44] mindsets, Lord. And may Lord, you come
[5:48] by this way today. Illuminate our
[5:50] hearts. Father, fill our minds with
[5:52] revelation and wisdom. And Lord, give us
[5:55] what it is that would strengthen us in
[5:57] your mercies, Father. Now, we invite you
[5:59] into this. We pray in the name of Jesus
[6:02] Christ. Amen. And amen. In Hebrews
[6:06] chapter 9 and the 28th verse,
[6:10] so Christ once was offered to bear the
[6:13] sins of many,
[6:15] and unto them that look,
[6:18] for him shall he appear, the second time
[6:23] without sin unto salvation. May God
[6:26] bless his word. You could be seated this
[6:28] morning.
[6:29] Uh I want to speak from that uh phrase
[6:33] this morning. Unto them that look for
[6:36] him,
[6:37] he shall appear. Unto them that look for
[6:40] him, he shall appear. This is out of the
[6:44] Hebrew series, but it's as normal. We're
[6:46] trying to take an a context so that you
[6:49] could you could look upon it. Um I very
[6:52] rarely use other um from the pullpit.
[6:54] Anyhow, use other translations. I like
[6:57] this one though, a New International
[6:59] Version. Uh and I want you just listen
[7:02] to the way that they read it. I I like
[7:04] the way it said. So Christ was
[7:06] sacrificed once to take away the sins of
[7:08] many and he will appear a second time
[7:12] not to bear sin but to bring salvation.
[7:16] Uh in the King James version of course
[7:18] it says the same thing but the reading
[7:21] of it sometimes uh you look at it and
[7:23] you go what does he mean by that? He
[7:25] shall appear the second time without sin
[7:28] unto salvation. It means that when he
[7:30] appears the second time, he's not
[7:32] appearing uh to bear our sins, but he's
[7:35] appearing to bring salvation. Of course,
[7:38] this has a lot to do with what we've
[7:40] been studying on Melazdc when he
[7:42] appeared unto Abraham. Melazdc had both
[7:45] wine and bread, but there was no lamb.
[7:47] Showing you that he had went and
[7:48] redeemed Lot and had brought him back
[7:50] and had was serving communion rather
[7:53] than sacrificing a lamb. And so we see
[7:56] part of the coming uh of Melkazedc in
[7:58] the end time and how uh that Paul says
[8:01] here uh that he will appear. Now Paul in
[8:04] Hebrews 9 has covered strongly uh the
[8:07] revelation of Melchazdc. But he said
[8:09] really you can't bear what I've got to
[8:11] say about this. Uh but there is coming a
[8:14] people uh that will receive the
[8:16] revelation of Melazdc that will be so
[8:18] effective that when I appear they'll be
[8:21] able to see me. Amen. And so to them
[8:23] that that look for him. Now to behold it
[8:26] means to appear is actually means to
[8:28] take heed or to take notice to to to um
[8:32] to appear. Uh is is it deals with
[8:35] something that it basically he's showing
[8:38] himself. Uh this word look for actually
[8:41] means to eagerly await. And I like this
[8:44] one to expect fully.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Those that expect fully the Lord uh they
[8:50] shall see him. Amen. them that expect
[8:52] fully. Those that are eagerly awaiting,
[8:55] they're expecting fully. Now, when I
[8:58] when I look at this, of course, it's the
[9:00] same type of word out of the book of
[9:01] Romans, the 8th chapter, where it says
[9:04] creation believers, they eagerly wait
[9:06] for the manifestation of the sons. The
[9:08] whole thing waiteth. When you're uh
[9:10] reading scriptures, a lot of times it
[9:12] talks about a waiting period uh as being
[9:15] that someone is waiting or someone is
[9:17] looking. And and of course after Paul is
[9:20] speaking of this, he's saying that those
[9:23] that are waiting are looking for Christ
[9:25] to appear uh not to bring an end to sin
[9:28] to sacrifice himself like he did the
[9:30] first, but this will be uh based upon
[9:33] that he will bring salvation. Now here
[9:35] in uh expectations, brother Bam says an
[9:38] expectation has to be built on something
[9:41] uh that's got faith behind it. Because
[9:43] if you're expecting something, it's
[9:45] because something's been promised or or
[9:47] some way like that. So if you want to
[9:49] have a real expectation, it's got to be
[9:52] built upon thus saith the Lord. So in
[9:55] other words, if you're really expecting
[9:57] something, it's based on something. If I
[9:59] tell you, hey, I'm going to do certain
[10:01] certain thing for you. Well, you have an
[10:02] expectation, but that's because that I
[10:05] promised you something or I said
[10:07] something that made you expect it. So
[10:09] I'm I'm not talking to entitled people.
[10:12] I'm talking to people that has been a
[10:14] promise has been made to them uh by the
[10:16] word of God. So, we're not just
[10:18] entitled. We're not just uh uh uh you
[10:20] know, I mean, we're not just sitting
[10:21] around saying, "Well, God owes me
[10:23] something." But this is God's idea. He's
[10:26] the one uh that brought it up, you know,
[10:28] years ago. And you forgive me if you
[10:30] don't like Disney. and and and and but
[10:32] years ago when my my kids were small, we
[10:34] took them down to Disney and and and we
[10:36] couldn't really uh uh afford all of it.
[10:38] But we seen a big sign and said that if
[10:41] you know you could stay cheap and this
[10:42] and this and all you had to do is go to
[10:43] this one little probably's never been to
[10:46] these sales events, but but it was a
[10:48] what it really is is they give you a
[10:50] free ticket nearly and a free room to
[10:52] come and sit into a hour and a half or
[10:55] something like that to listen to a sales
[10:56] market like that. and and uh and so I
[10:59] got led in there by a sign, you know, um
[11:02] and and I took what they gave me. And
[11:03] when I got in there, the guy's talking
[11:05] to me, he's talking about all of it. And
[11:06] I said, "Well, I'm sorry. I'm probably
[11:08] not going to buy anything." He said,
[11:09] "Sorry." He said, "We trapped you in
[11:11] here. We we brought you in here by the
[11:13] sign. You didn't ask to come. We brought
[11:15] you in here so I can try to sell you."
[11:17] And I said, "That's right. I I that's
[11:19] right." And and and you hear Brother
[11:21] Brandham talk about Christians uh that
[11:23] they're brought in by Christ. It's not
[11:26] that. It's really not that you sought
[11:28] it. You thought you did, but you didn't
[11:30] really. Something something brought you.
[11:32] Something something attracted your
[11:34] attention. Something was given to make
[11:37] you want to. And there's things offered
[11:39] and you might feel, but yet there is an
[11:42] expectation. And that expectation comes
[11:44] from promise. And and now brother
[11:46] Brandon will tell us this. Amen. It
[11:48] comes from promise. Now uh when brother
[11:50] Ram deals with this particular scripture
[11:53] he comes from a message look uh but a
[11:55] lot of times he'll use it again in a
[11:57] certain way and he'll say now uh when
[12:00] Jesus was on the earth and he showed the
[12:02] Messiah sign of course he did that and
[12:04] and if you've uh studied this you'll see
[12:07] where I'm at. If you hadn't studied it
[12:08] you it would be a good time to take time
[12:10] because I'm not going to take an hour on
[12:12] it. Uh but when Jesus came remember he
[12:14] said I came unto my own and my own
[12:16] receive me not. And he said now don't go
[12:19] out there. He said now you stay here
[12:21] with the house of Israel. And brother
[12:23] Bam says watch when Jesus performs the
[12:26] Messiah sign. He never performs it to a
[12:28] Gentile.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; He says because the Gentiles were not
[12:33] expecting that
[12:35] &gt;&gt; right there. There was no promise to the
[12:37] Gentiles. They wasn't looking for him.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Now brother Bam will go to say this. we
[12:42] Gentiles or Anglo-Saxons was not looking
[12:45] for no Messiah. He only comes to those
[12:50] who are looking for him. I used to know
[12:52] a guy that he would quote that quote and
[12:53] then he every morning 6:00 he'd stand
[12:55] and look into the east sky cuz he was
[12:58] looking for him. And I said, "Well, I
[12:59] don't think that's what the prophet
[13:01] meant." Uh because he was saying those
[13:04] that are looking for the Messiah, he
[13:06] only comes to those who are looking for
[13:08] him. And I'd like uh for that to go
[13:10] home. He said, "I hope that stands as
[13:13] high as the trees down here before you
[13:17] that you can can't look without seeing
[13:20] it. He only comes to those who are
[13:24] looking for him." Brother man said, "I
[13:26] pray this statement gets as big as a
[13:29] tree before you. He only comes to those
[13:33] who are looking for him." Amen. I hope
[13:36] that stands as high as the trees. He
[13:38] only comes to that. See, we Gentiles
[13:41] wasn't looking. We wasn't looking for a
[13:43] Messiah, but the Jew and the Samaritans
[13:45] were. Amen. So, we'll see how he made
[13:49] himself known. How did Jesus make
[13:52] himself known to the Jew? He made
[13:54] himself known by the Messiah sign. Amen.
[13:57] When he read the hearts, he made himself
[13:59] known to the Samaritans. The same way
[14:01] with a woman at the well. That's how he
[14:03] did it. Sir, we would see Jesus. Brother
[14:05] man said if that was the sign of the
[14:07] Messiah yesterday and he's has the same
[14:11] Messiah today, it'll have to be the same
[14:14] thing today as it was yesterday. That's
[14:16] how he makes himself known to the
[14:19] church.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; The same way he made himself known to
[14:23] the Jew and to the Samaritan, he will
[14:25] also make himself known unto the
[14:28] Gentile. And how did he do it then is
[14:30] the same way he does it now. You notice
[14:33] how many times brother Brandham used
[14:35] discernment on the platform and he says
[14:37] now he's not dead he's alive and then
[14:40] he'll take a woman and he'll say now
[14:42] this woman standing here is just like it
[14:44] was the scene in John the 4th chapter
[14:46] and brother B will draw out the whole
[14:48] thing and he'll say now if it was in
[14:50] that day what would happen Jesus would
[14:52] tell her her sin he would tell her about
[14:54] her religion and he'll go through that
[14:56] he said then when that struck her life
[14:59] she said sir I perceive thou art a
[15:01] prophet
[15:02] because the light had struck some
[15:04] training. Something in her, brother Ram
[15:07] says, what? She says, "We know thou art
[15:09] a Messiah. We know thou art the
[15:12] prophet." He said, "Then there was some
[15:13] teaching in there." There was something
[15:15] in there that was expecting to see
[15:17] something because when she saw it, she
[15:20] said, "We know that when the Messiah
[15:22] cometh, he will be a prophet." So, there
[15:25] was something expecting. So, then when
[15:27] she saw it, then she knew what she was
[15:30] looking at. Amen. Amen. And if you're
[15:32] reading uh the Apostle Paul, he's
[15:35] projecting that the same Messiah that
[15:37] was in the Bible will be appearing in
[15:39] the last day. And how will you know him
[15:42] when he comes?
[15:45] &gt;&gt; It would have to be the same sign. Now,
[15:48] this Messiah, Amen, they wasn't looking
[15:50] for one, but this Messiah only comes and
[15:53] makes himself manifest to those who are
[15:55] looking for him. The reason we don't see
[15:58] these things today is because we're not
[16:00] looking for them. We are looking to our
[16:03] church or to our denomination or to our
[16:06] structures. How much we are growing. Get
[16:09] your eyes off of that and look to the
[16:12] Messiah. We're at the end time. Now,
[16:15] watch what he's doing. Brother Brandham
[16:16] is then telling you the only reason you
[16:19] wouldn't see him today is because you're
[16:21] not looking at him. He's not telling
[16:24] you. It's not because he's not
[16:25] manifesting. It's not because he's not
[16:28] here. It's not because he's not alive.
[16:30] But you're just not looking at him.
[16:32] You're looking at the at the church.
[16:34] You're looking at the building. You're
[16:36] looking at the group. You're looking at
[16:37] the situations. But the Messiah is here.
[16:40] Now, in the Bible, when the Messiah made
[16:43] himself known, look at the effect that
[16:45] it had even on the woman at the well.
[16:48] Brother man uses it and it's a famous
[16:50] way that he shows the sign of the
[16:52] Messiah is because he chooses a woman
[16:54] that's a mixed religion between Jew and
[16:56] Gentile Samaritan and then he also
[16:59] chooses her because she's a harlot. And
[17:01] brother B says see that that she is a
[17:03] prophecy that the same sign's going to
[17:06] come to the gentile church because the
[17:09] gentile church is a mixed people and it
[17:12] will be to a harlot system. She will she
[17:15] will be called out of the harlots. Amen.
[17:17] to be made virgin, right? Amen. So, we
[17:20] find then that Jesus doing that to her
[17:23] is a prophecy that he's going to do it
[17:25] in the end time. When she saw the symbol
[17:28] of THE MESSIAH, THE BIBLE said she
[17:30] dropped her water pot and ran into the
[17:33] city. Now, can you imagine? Amen. Here
[17:35] she is, an ill-famed woman going into
[17:37] the city. AMEN. TO TELL all of the
[17:40] religious PEOPLE WHERE THE MESSIAH WAS
[17:43] AND WHO HE WAS. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE,
[17:45] BROTHER MAN SAID THAT WOMAN didn't have
[17:47] no voice. He said even today you watch
[17:49] how some sometimes in places women don't
[17:52] have a voice at all. He said look what
[17:54] it would have been in that day. That
[17:56] woman would HAVE HAD NO VOICE IN THAT
[17:58] DAY AT ALL. AMEN. LET ALONE a harlot
[18:02] having a voice in religion. They
[18:04] couldn't even COME TO THE WELL WITH THAT
[18:06] WOMAN. BUT SHE CAUGHT ON SUCH FIRE BY
[18:09] SEEING THE MESSIAH THAT SHE WAS SO
[18:12] INFLUENCED by what she saw. Amen. SHE
[18:15] RAN FROM THE WI. LISTEN, SHE DIDN'T EVEN
[18:17] STAY THERE WITH JESUS. SHE PUT DOWN HER
[18:19] WATER POT AND SAID, "I GOT TO TELL
[18:21] SOMEBODY THAT THE MESSIAH HAS COME INTO
[18:24] THIS EARTH AND SHE RAN DOWN THERE AND
[18:26] THE BIBLE SAID MANY BELIEVED upon him
[18:29] because of her testimony." Let me tell
[18:32] you, if you can get influenced enough by
[18:33] this message, you can become
[18:35] influential. PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO
[18:37] BE INFLUENTIAL. THIS IS A LAND OF
[18:39] INFLUENCERS. I'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU DO
[18:41] IT. YOU GET UNDER THE MESSAGE OF THE
[18:43] HOUR AND LET IT SO INFLUENCE YOUR MIND
[18:46] AND YOUR THINKING UNTIL YOU BEGIN TO
[18:48] RECOGNIZE WHAT IT REALLY IS. AND THEN
[18:50] SOMETHING WILL HAVE YOU SAY, "THE
[18:52] MESSIAH IS HERE ON THE EARTH TODAY."
[18:55] AMEN. COME SEE. WHERE'S HE AT? COME SEE.
[18:58] YOU CAN SEE HIM IF YOU KNOW HOW TO look
[19:00] for him. THAT WOMAN GOT SO SHE GOT SO
[19:02] INFIRED WITH IT. AMEN. SHE DIDN'T WALK
[19:05] OUT to the city and go, "Well, I I don't
[19:06] have nothing to say this morning." And
[19:08] and and and I I I tell you, I I don't
[19:11] feel like I could move anybody or help
[19:13] anybody. I'm going That wasn't the way
[19:15] that woman went out there.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Because she had seen something worth
[19:18] saying.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. SHE HAD SEEN SOMETHING
[19:22] WORTH SAYING. AMEN. AND IF YOU and if IN
[19:25] YOUR SPIRIT YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO
[19:28] TESTIFY, I SAY YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AGAIN.
[19:30] YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AT THIS MESSAGE AGAIN.
[19:32] AMEN. GET GET YOUR MIND OUT OF ALL THE
[19:34] TRADITIONS AND THE IDEAS AROUND CHURCH
[19:37] AND ALL THE people saying, "Well, it
[19:39] means this and IT MEANS THAT." AND YOU
[19:40] GET ON THERE AND LISTEN TO SOME PASTOR.
[19:42] AMEN. MAKING FUN OF BROTHER BAM or
[19:44] ridiculing him. And then you get on
[19:45] there and listen to some other guy and
[19:47] he's walking TALKING ABOUT WORSHIP AND
[19:49] HE'S AGAINST THIS AND THAT AND SOMETHING
[19:51] ELSE AND YOU GET YOUR MIND SO FULL OF
[19:53] THAT UNTIL AFTER A WHILE ALL YOUR JOY IS
[19:55] GONE AND ALL YOUR REVIVAL'S GONE. BUT IF
[19:58] THIS MESSAGE, AMEN, IN THAT DAY COULD
[20:00] REVIVE A WOMAN AT THE WELL. AMEN. TO
[20:03] MAKE HER GO INTO THE CITY AND SPEAK
[20:05] WHERE SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO SPEAK. WHAT
[20:08] ABOUT THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD? WHAT
[20:10] IT OUGHT TO DO TO US THIS MORNING? IN
[20:12] ORDER TO CAUSE A REVIVAL TO DROP DOWN
[20:15] THE HEART OF THE SOULS OF THE PEOPLE OF
[20:17] GOD UNTIL THEY SHAKE OFF ALL OF THAT
[20:20] DEPRESSION
[20:22] &gt;&gt; AND ANXIETY AND SAY, "LISTEN, AMEN. I
[20:25] MIGHT NOT BE MUCH PERSONALLY, BUT I HAVE
[20:27] SEEN SOMETHING.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; I have seen something."
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I seen something. Amen. I seen the
[20:37] sign of the Messiah. Amen. You You say
[20:40] you seen him? Yes, I seen his sign.
[20:43] [laughter] What kind of man was he?
[20:45] Amen. I seen the sign.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. I seen the sign. Now,
[20:50] if you're wondering about this and we
[20:52] would see Jesus 1962, this is July 4th
[20:55] of 1962. Brother Brandham ties Hebrews 9
[20:58] directly to what I'm talking about when
[21:00] he says, "See, the Gentiles wasn't
[21:02] looking for a Messiah." See, and Messiah
[21:05] only comes to those who are looking for
[21:08] him. That's the only way. To them that
[21:10] look, he will appear the second time. To
[21:13] them that look, he will appear the
[21:15] second time. Just to those who are
[21:18] looking for him. Amen. And pertaining
[21:20] they are really looking for him. He
[21:22] never come to the gentile. That miracle
[21:25] was never performed to the gentile.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; The miracle never performed the gentile.
[21:30] NOW WATCH THAT ONE STATEMENT GOES. IT
[21:32] GOES LIKE A star bust through the
[21:34] message.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He never performed that miracle.
[21:37] Okay. Now to you that's if you're
[21:40] studying the message this will help you
[21:41] because you've heard the negative. If
[21:43] God be with us where's the miracles. So
[21:46] they take it to a Pentecostal side a
[21:48] negative. Amen. And a man says well if
[21:51] God's with you then where's this and I
[21:53] want to see more signs and I want to see
[21:55] more of this and I want to see more of
[21:56] this. And they place the presence of God
[22:00] solely upon that. But watch now. Brother
[22:02] Random goes to show you that the
[22:04] antichrist spirit can work in the same
[22:06] realm. That's right.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it wasn't until the
[22:11] word came that we knew the difference
[22:13] between the two spirits.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now watch what I'm saying,
[22:18] though. He said the miracle. So, if you
[22:20] go listen to the sermon, if God be for
[22:22] us, where's the miracle? You're going to
[22:23] find out the miracle that that Gideon is
[22:26] talking about is the Messa sign of
[22:29] vindication of the word. Because brother
[22:31] Bram says it's not until the angel
[22:34] touches the sacrifice and it disappears
[22:37] in fire that Gideon sees the miracle
[22:39] he's looking for which is vindication.
[22:42] Now that same miracle IS WHAT HAPPENED
[22:44] WITH ELIJAH on the mountain when he's
[22:47] standing against Baal. Remember and he
[22:49] brought fire and the WHOLE CONGREGATION
[22:51] SAID OUR GOD IS GOD. BROTHER B SAID
[22:53] THAT'S BECAUSE THEY SAW VINDICATION.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW GOD THAT ANSWERS BY FIRE. THEY
[22:59] saw vindication OF HIS WORD. NOW, IN
[23:02] THIS SEASON, AMEN. What we're looking
[23:04] for is the miracle that he PERFORMED
[23:07] WITH ABRAHAM BACK in Genesis the 18th
[23:10] chapter. Brother man said, "There it
[23:11] is." IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE MIRACLE,
[23:13] look in Genesis 18 and see when he read
[23:16] SARAH'S HEART WHEN SHE WAS IN the tent
[23:18] that was behind him. Now, this now THIS
[23:20] IS POWERFUL, FOLKS, BECAUSE THE MIRACLE
[23:23] was never performed before the Gentile.
[23:25] SO WHEN YOU SEE BROTHER BRANDHAM turning
[23:26] his back to the congregation and
[23:29] performing that he's performing the
[23:31] miracle THAT TELLS YOU GOD IS WITH US.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WAS HEY, BROTHER BAM SAID THERE
[23:37] IT IS. HE'S confirming the covenant to
[23:39] the church. HE THAT'S HIS CONFIRMATION
[23:42] OF THE COVENANT. WATCH WHEN YOU GO TO
[23:44] SAMSON AND YOU SEE SAMSON. remember he
[23:46] was under covenant and then the covenant
[23:48] was broken AND HE GOT BLINDED and he
[23:50] lost his power AND HE'S OUT THERE
[23:52] WORKING AND BROTHER SAYS WATCH BUT ALL
[23:54] THE TIME the locks were growing back
[23:58] &gt;&gt; and he said IF HE COULD EVER FEEL LIKE
[24:00] HE was under that covenant he could
[24:02] defeat his enemy and brother Brandon
[24:03] said one day he reached up and felt
[24:05] those locks and he cried out just ONE
[24:08] MORE TIME NOW BROTHER BRANDHAM IS
[24:10] TALKING TO THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH AND
[24:12] HE'S TALKING HOW THAT YOU USED TO BE A
[24:14] POWERFUL GROUP BUT NOW YOU'RE JUST
[24:16] ENTERTAINING.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; And he TALKED ABOUT SAMSON. IT'S JUST A
[24:20] SHOW. YOU'RE JUST CLOWNING NOW. LIKE
[24:22] SAMSON WAS to them Philistine gods. DO
[24:25] US A MIRACLE. SHOW US SOMETHING
[24:27] WONDERFUL. HE SAID THAT'S WHAT PENTECOST
[24:29] HAS BEEN REDUCED TO. THEY LOST THE POWER
[24:32] AND THE STRENGTH, BUT THEY'RE STILL
[24:34] PUTTING ON A SHOW. BUT BROTHER BAM SAID,
[24:36] "BUT WHEN THE COVENANT RETURNED, SAMSON
[24:38] SAID,"LORD, JUST ONE MORE TIME, LET
[24:41] STRENGTH ENTER EVERY MEMBER." BROTHER
[24:43] MADDEN WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BRIDE. LET
[24:45] THE STRENGTH OF GOD RETURN TO EVERY
[24:48] MEMBER IN THE BODY BECAUSE WHEN HE
[24:51] REACHED UP AND FELT THEM LOCKS, he knew
[24:53] he was still under covenant. And brother
[24:56] Brandham preaching this now and looks
[24:58] out in the congregation, discerned
[25:00] somebody's hearts, and he said, "There
[25:02] it is. You feel them? You feel the
[25:04] locks? Do you feel the locks?" And he
[25:06] starts discerning other. Do you FEEL THE
[25:08] LOCKS? WHAT'S HE DOING? BY HIS SIGN OF
[25:11] DISCERNMENT, he's telling THE MEMBERS OF
[25:13] THIS BODY THAT'S CRYING ONE MORE TIME
[25:15] THAT THE COVENANT IS STILL IN EFFECT FOR
[25:18] THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. GOD IS
[25:21] STILL WITH YOU.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; OH CHURCH, I'LL TELL YOU THIS. IT DON'T
[25:24] MATTER WHAT WE GO THROUGH IF WE KNOW
[25:26] GOD'S WITH US. THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE
[25:28] VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DOUBT, I WILL
[25:31] FEAR NO EVIL BECAUSE THOU ART WITH ME.
[25:34] THOU ART MY ROD AND MY STAFF. ABRAHAM
[25:36] SAID, "MY SHIELD AND MY BUCKLER." DAVID
[25:39] SAID, "THOUGH YOU HIDE MY SOUL IN HELL,
[25:41] IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE GOD WILL BE
[25:44] THERE WITH ME WHEREVER I MAKE MY BED
[25:46] WHEREVER I GO." AMEN. DO YOU NOT REALIZE
[25:49] THAT GOD IS WITH YOU? YOU SAY, "I'M
[25:51] GOING THROUGH TRIALS." I SAY, "GOD IS
[25:53] WITH YOU." BUT I'M NOT SAYING THAT BY
[25:56] AMEN. I FEEL BETTER TODAY THAN I DID
[25:58] YESTERDAY, AND I FEEL A LITTLE MORE
[26:00] EXCITED TODAY THAN I DID YESTERDAY, AND
[26:03] I'M DOWN TODAY, AND I'M UP TOMORROW.
[26:05] AMEN. FORGET THE WHOLE THING. THERE'S A
[26:07] SIGN OVER THE CHURCH THAT GOD IS WITH
[26:11] US.
[26:13] [applause]
[26:15] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THERE, I
[26:16] DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN READ THE SIGNS AND
[26:18] THE SIGN SAYS THAT MESSIAH IS HERE ON
[26:22] EARTH NOW.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. He's the same. He
[26:28] appeared to them two tribes and he's
[26:30] appearing to you today. He's here today.
[26:33] That angel, brother Bam said, turned his
[26:35] back to that tent. Why did Sarah lad?
[26:37] What kind of telepathy is that? See,
[26:39] it's not telepathy. It was a sign to
[26:41] Abraham.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; The messenger of the Holy Spirit is
[26:45] coming to the elected church. Now, of
[26:48] course, Brother Bram says the same son
[26:50] that God manifested in the east is
[26:52] appearing in the west. This is the
[26:54] evening time. Now, amen. Brother Bram
[26:58] says this in Jehovah Gyra. He comes to
[27:00] the humblehearted, those that are
[27:02] looking for him. And here he is tonight.
[27:05] the Holy Spirit, the same angel. Brother
[27:09] Ma'am, then a little later, the quote
[27:11] says, "If I die tonight and I never
[27:14] enter p this pull pit tomorrow night, my
[27:17] word is truth because it's not my words,
[27:20] it's his."
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see he he actually was up on the
[27:26] earth announced by a prophet to be in
[27:30] the presence of the people? Now, when
[27:33] you when you look into this, you'll see
[27:36] that he was there and he was walking
[27:39] among them. But the sign made him known
[27:42] to the woman at the well. He was there
[27:44] and he was walking among them. When he
[27:46] looked at Peter who had his hands full
[27:48] of net and called him and Peter dropped
[27:50] his net and went and followed him, what
[27:52] happened? He didn't come. He just opened
[27:54] Peter's eyes.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; He He didn't come special to the whale.
[27:58] He opened her eyes.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That same one that when he
[28:03] appeared to the two on the road to
[28:04] Emmas, that was the resurrected Christ
[28:07] after his death, burial, and
[28:09] resurrection, showing the same ministry
[28:12] to them too on the road that he had
[28:14] showed to that woman AND TO HIS
[28:16] DISCIPLES WHO WERE STANDING THERE
[28:18] recognized the same one that was before
[28:21] death is now alive doing the same thing
[28:24] now, PREDICTING THAT THERE WOULD COME A
[28:28] MINISTRY AFTER his resurrection. Now it
[28:31] was the presence then and it was the
[28:33] presence now. Now what was needed was
[28:36] God needed to change the scene.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; That's what needed when when you think
[28:42] about this in the unveiling of God.
[28:43] Brother Bam goes down and he's talking
[28:45] about Elijah and how he was down at
[28:47] Elisha was down at Dolphin, you know,
[28:49] and he had his servant Gahesa with him
[28:51] and that's when the Syrian army swirled
[28:53] in around him and he said, "Well,
[28:55] there's there's more of us than there is
[28:56] of them." And brother Bam draws out the
[28:59] picture and he says, "Well, Gahesa, you
[29:01] know, he he he didn't see what Elisha
[29:03] saw." But but Elisha prayed the prayer
[29:07] and said, "Lord, open the boy's eyes
[29:10] that he might be able to see." Now,
[29:12] Brother Bam draws a huge thing and he
[29:15] says, "Listen now, God never put the
[29:18] angels there.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; He just changed his sea."
[29:24] Now, NOW IF IF YOU COULD TAKE FROM THAT,
[29:26] brother Brandham, Elijah in the last
[29:29] days said, now Elisha never did see them
[29:33] angels personally. He wouldn't he DIDN'T
[29:36] LOOK OUT THE LOG WINDOW and see the
[29:38] angels out on the mountain. He said he
[29:40] was taking that from scripture that were
[29:43] that that they that fear the Lord shall
[29:45] the angels of the Lord encamp about them
[29:47] that fear. So, he was taking the word
[29:50] and announcing what he couldn't see. AND
[29:53] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TELLING A
[29:55] CONGREGATION that and then turns around
[29:57] and says, "The angel of the LORD IS
[29:59] HERE."
[30:00] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING SAYING, "WELL,
[30:02] WHERE'S HE AT?" AMEN. WHAT WHERE'S HE
[30:04] AT? AND BROTHER B WAS SAYING, "OH, HE
[30:06] DIDN'T NEED TO COME. HE JUST NEEDED TO
[30:08] CHANGE THEIR SCENE."
[30:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND TODAY, what we really need is
[30:12] to change the scene. BUT WE KNOW HOW TO
[30:16] SEE HIM TO UNDERSTAND HE'S IN THE
[30:18] PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE. AMEN. AND HE HAS
[30:21] SHOWED HIMSELF BY A SIGN. HE ONLY comes
[30:24] to those who are looking for him.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Are you looking for him this morning?
[30:29] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 9, let's reread it.
[30:31] Christ once offered to bear the sins of
[30:33] many, and unto them that look, he shall
[30:35] appear the second time without sin unto
[30:38] salvation. In 2 Timothy 4 and verse 8,
[30:41] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[30:43] crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
[30:45] the righteous judge, shall give me at
[30:48] that day, and not to me only, but unto
[30:51] all them also that love his appearing.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Unto them that love his appearing. How
[30:58] many knows, Brother Bam said that his
[31:00] ministry was that appearing?
[31:02] &gt;&gt; I got several quotes. Amen. That that
[31:05] his ministry was that appearing. Paul
[31:08] said unto them that love is appearing.
[31:10] Do you know that the Bible says that in
[31:12] the last days there will be scoffers.
[31:14] Amen. There will be people literally
[31:16] that all they're going to do is scoff
[31:19] the message and other people's going to
[31:20] say, "Well, it might not be true because
[31:23] so and so don't see it or so and SO
[31:25] SCOFF AT IT." BUT THE SCRIPTURE says
[31:27] scoffers SHALL COME. BUT IT ALSO SAYS
[31:30] UNTO THEM THAT ALSO LOVE HIS APPEARING.
[31:33] SO JUST AS SURE AS THERE'S PEOPLE'S
[31:35] GOING TO SCOFF IT, THERE'S PEOPLE THAT'S
[31:37] GOING TO LOVE IT. WELL, I HAPPEN TO BE
[31:40] one of them. I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THEM
[31:42] THAT LOVE THE APPEARING OF the Lord in
[31:45] the last days that he has manifested
[31:47] himself so clearly in our generation.
[31:50] You you your Bible people, let's read
[31:53] scripture. COLOSSIANS 3 AND VERSE 4.
[31:55] WHEN CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE, when he
[31:58] shall appear, then we shall also appear
[32:00] with him in glory. when Christ who is
[32:03] our life shall appear. HOW MANY REALIZES
[32:05] THAT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON TAKES JOHN THE 4TH
[32:09] CHAPTER, the woman at the well again,
[32:11] and he SAYS SHE WAS SITTING there
[32:13] waiting for her life to be manifest.
[32:16] THAT'S ALL SHE WAS WAITING ON WAS HER
[32:17] LIFE TO be manifest because the one she
[32:20] was living on the earth, AMEN, WAS LEFT
[32:22] HER IN THAT PLACE. BUT CHRIST WAS COMING
[32:25] FROM ANOTHER PLACE. HE COME TO RAISE HER
[32:29] thinking above the thinking she had
[32:31] right then of who she was. Do you see
[32:34] that? When he shall appear, then we
[32:36] shall appear with him IN GLORY. WHEN HE
[32:38] APPEARS, he's coming from a different
[32:40] realm, a a different denom, a a
[32:43] different dimension, A DIFFERENT PLACE.
[32:45] SO WHAT HE THINKS AND what he says is
[32:48] able then to lift the people unto
[32:51] another realm. You can appear with him
[32:52] in glory if you can see this. This is
[32:55] his appearing. You see, if you're
[32:57] looking at it the wrong way, then the
[33:00] message is condemning you. If you're
[33:02] looking at it from THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING
[33:04] at it, it's raising you to THE LEVEL OF
[33:07] BEING THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU CAN
[33:11] YOU CAN APPEAR WITH HIM. THAT'S WHY HE
[33:13] SAID, "WHEN ZION HAS BEEN BUILT UP, THEN
[33:15] SHALL I APPEAR WITH HIM IN GLORY." YOU
[33:18] SEE THE APPEARANCE OF THE LORD WAS
[33:20] WAITING FOR THE BRIDE TO GET BUILT UP IN
[33:22] THE PLACE of glory. 1 John chapter 2 and
[33:26] verse 28. And now little children abide
[33:28] in him that when he shall appear we may
[33:31] have a confidence and not be ashamed
[33:34] before him at his coming. When he shall
[33:36] appear. I love that. Amen. That we'll
[33:39] not be ashamed. Well, I'm not ashamed.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the message. I'm not
[33:44] ashamed to say what it is. I'm not
[33:47] ashamed to say what it does. AMEN.
[33:49] BECAUSE I'M NOT ASHAMED OF brother
[33:51] Bradom. I'm not ashamed of the appearing
[33:52] of the LORD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I
[33:55] KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING THIS IS the
[33:57] appearing of the Lord. It is what it is.
[34:00] And God has OPENED THIS DUMB HILLY'S
[34:02] EYES. YOU SEE, IT'S THE FULFILLMENT OF
[34:05] SCRIPTURE IN MY GENERATION. I COULD
[34:08] STAND TODAY LIKE THEY STOOD IN THE BIBLE
[34:10] AND SAY, "THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE IS
[34:13] FULFILLED."
[34:14] &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK AT THAT. IT'S FULFILLED WHETHER
[34:16] YOU SEE IT OR YOU DON'T SEE IT. BUT
[34:18] TODAY I PRAY THAT THE SCRIPTURE is
[34:20] fulfilled in your ears. That you're able
[34:23] TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE
[34:25] HOUR IS NOT A HIT AND MISS. IT'S NOT
[34:28] BROTHER BRANDHAM GUESSING AT THINGS.
[34:30] IT'S NOT A MAN BUILDING UP HIS
[34:32] DENOMINATION OR HIS FOLLOWING. IT IS THE
[34:35] FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD IN OUR
[34:37] GENERATION. THIS IS THE WORD COMING TO
[34:40] PASS. OH, WHEN YOU SEE IT, BROTHER, you
[34:43] can't unsee it. When you see it in the
[34:45] scripture, you'll see it again and
[34:47] again. Amen. Watch the scripture.
[34:49] Beloved, now we are the sons of God. And
[34:52] it doth not yet appear what we shall be,
[34:54] but we know that when he shall appear.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; When he shall appear, we shall be like
[35:00] him, for we shall see him
[35:03] &gt;&gt; as he is.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; That we shall know. And and if you're a
[35:08] studyer of the message, you'll know THAT
[35:10] BROTHER BRANDHAM TAKES THAT TO
[35:12] THEOPHONY. AND HE TEACHES US, WATCH THE
[35:15] REVELATION OF MELAZDC. THAT'S GOD
[35:17] THEOPHONY. GOD. AMEN. BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T
[35:20] KNOW WAS THAT WE HAVE THEOPHONY.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S IN THE APPEARING OF THE LORD
[35:25] THAT WE COME TO THE REVELATION THAT WE
[35:28] ALSO HAVE THEOPHONY. LOOK WHAT HE SAID.
[35:30] WHEREVER THE CARCASS IS, THERE THE
[35:31] EAGLES are gathered together. And
[35:32] brother said, "What's the eagles?" The
[35:34] church. He said, "But what's the
[35:36] carcass?" is the fresh word. And when
[35:38] you recognize that the very message IS
[35:42] THE EAGLE FOOD, THEN you have HEARD FROM
[35:45] YOUR THEOPHONY. THIS IS MORE THAN A
[35:48] MINISTRY OF A MAN, WILLIAM BRANDOM.
[35:50] THAT'S WHY THAT IT DIDN'T STOP WHEN
[35:52] BROTHER BRANDHAM DIED. THIS MINISTRY IS
[35:55] STILL MOVING BECAUSE IT'S THE MINISTRY
[35:57] OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS IS NOT A JUST, OH
[36:01] GOD, I WISH I HAD THE VOICE OF 10,000
[36:03] ANGELS. THIS IS MORE THAN THE MAN
[36:05] WILLIAM BRANDOM.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST
[36:10] THAT HE PROMISED IN THE LAST DAYS THAT
[36:12] HE WOULD APPEAR AMONG US. AMEN. AND HOW
[36:15] IS IT THAT GOD, AMEN, COULD appear and
[36:18] might make himself KNOWN? DO YOU SEE
[36:19] THAT? HE'S NEVER REQUIRED you to worship
[36:21] something you didn't know.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; He's never said go down and worship at
[36:26] the unknown god under his tomb. But he
[36:28] makes himself known.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; And watch his identification. and he
[36:34] fulfills the word.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see that? AMEN. NOW WATCH
[36:39] IN JOHN 14. Did he promise he would
[36:41] appear? Look, I just read four
[36:43] scriptures of promising he would appear.
[36:46] But then in John 14, he also promised
[36:49] THAT YOU WOULD SEE HIM IN JOHN 14. Yet a
[36:52] little while and the world seeth me no
[36:54] more, BUT YE SHALL SEE ME. BECAUSE I
[36:58] LIVE, ye live also. How many knows that
[37:00] ye is a special class of people?
[37:03] Ye. That brother Bam uses the word ye
[37:06] class. There's the high class, there's
[37:08] the low class, there's the ye class. And
[37:10] brother Bam said the ye class is the
[37:13] people that see him. Come on, CHURCH.
[37:15] IT'S THE BEST CLASS OF PEOPLE.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAID, "OH, WE'LL GO DOWN AND
[37:20] JOIN THE HIGHER CLASS." HE SAID,
[37:21] "THERE'S NO BETTER CLASS." AMEN. THE
[37:23] GREATEST CLASS IS THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
[37:25] been filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THAT
[37:27] CLASS OF PEOPLE IS a ye class of people.
[37:31] Brother Bam TALKS ABOUT IT. HE TALKS
[37:32] ABOUT BILLY Graham filling up the the
[37:34] auditoriums and he talks about this. He
[37:36] said, "What's a class of them?" You
[37:38] remember he talked about he STOOD THERE
[37:39] ONE DAY AND HE was watching a uh he was
[37:42] waiting. He said, "I'm waiting on this
[37:43] building for my crowd to go in." He
[37:45] said, "And this intellectual fellow
[37:47] said, I watched his crowd come out and
[37:48] he said they was all well-dressed and
[37:50] nice and he said everything was
[37:51] perfect." He said, "Then here come my
[37:53] group." Yeah.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; He said there was the insane and the
[37:56] crippled and the lame and the halt and
[37:57] you know everything in the world was was
[37:59] pulled in around it and and you know
[38:01] years ago and I may told you this but I
[38:03] thought it was pretty good. Me and
[38:04] brother me and brother menia was sitting
[38:06] in Canada. We were sitting at a table
[38:07] with a brother and and and he might have
[38:09] that other brother might have been a
[38:10] little higher class than most of the
[38:12] message people
[38:14] and I don't say that as a compliment.
[38:16] Uh anybody that looks down on this bride
[38:19] you you too high. You need to get off
[38:20] your high horse.
[38:22] get your hand down here where we'll know
[38:24] you, you know.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; And he was just a little higher cuz he
[38:26] says, well, he said, there's a lot of
[38:28] there's a lot of basically riff raff
[38:30] around this message. There's a lot of
[38:32] odd people. And he just kept saying
[38:34] around that message and this message and
[38:36] them people and and my temperature was
[38:39] rising. I was checking myself. Amen. Cuz
[38:42] I was I was taking it personal and uh
[38:44] and in a minute, Brother Menow, I guess
[38:46] he could feel my spirit. And brother
[38:48] Manel very very as a stately gentleman
[38:50] that he is he said well brother you know
[38:52] why that is right and the brother the
[38:55] brother said no he said it's because it
[38:57] offers hope to everybody
[39:00] &gt;&gt; you see the message offers hope to
[39:02] everybody you don't have to be from a
[39:04] certain family to see the message is
[39:06] hope you YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FROM a
[39:09] certain social class to see the MESSAGE
[39:12] IS HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN
[39:13] EDUCATION to understand BUT IF YOU NEED
[39:16] HOPE THIS IS THE APPEARING OF THE LORD.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHEN HE APPEARS WITH POWER AND
[39:22] WITH GLORY AND HE SHOWS THE ABILITY. OH,
[39:24] COME ON NOW. YOU SEE WHAT IT IS? YOU YOU
[39:26] GOT TO YOU GOT TO GET INTO THAT PLACE
[39:28] WHERE THE HOLY SPIRIT CAN MOVE BECAUSE
[39:31] IT'S hope for everybody.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; THIS IS HOPE FOR EVERYBODY. THIS AIN'T
[39:37] HOPE for just one family. This ain't
[39:39] just for the Lawsons or the Ericsons. OR
[39:41] YOU SAY, "WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I
[39:42] AIN'T GOT NO CHANCE BECAUSE I'M NOT AN
[39:44] ERICSON." WELL, LISTEN. WHEN I MOVED
[39:46] HERE, I I DON'T HAVE NO FAMILY, NOBODY.
[39:48] BROTHER RAY BROUGHT ME IN HERE AS AN
[39:50] ORPHAN.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU, IF YOU MOVED IN HERE
[39:53] LATELY, YOU SEE ALL THE FAMILY AROUND
[39:55] ME. WELL, MY KIDS WAS IN UH Zach's 16
[39:58] and and Bethany was 10 and Gracie was
[40:00] about 14 AND AND IT WAS JUST OUR LITTLE
[40:02] FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. AND BROTHER
[40:04] RAY EXTENDED I WENT to some of his
[40:06] family things and he took me out to
[40:08] lunch and he just kind of brought ME IN
[40:10] AND MADE me a part of his FAMILY AND
[40:11] TREATED ME like his family. AMEN. BUT
[40:13] YOU BUT I WASN'T AN ERICSON. BUT I'M
[40:15] PASTORING THE CHURCH BECAUSE THE MESSAGE
[40:18] DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO BE AN ERICSON.
[40:21] AND IT DON'T REQUIRE YOU TO BE A LAWSON.
[40:23] AND ANY DEVIL THAT SAYS SO IS A LYING
[40:26] DEVIL OUT OF THE PITS OF HELL. YOU DON'T
[40:28] HAVE TO BE A LAWSON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[40:30] BE A REAGAN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A
[40:32] SPENCER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PUIT.
[40:34] YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A BRISCOLL. COME ON
[40:36] CHURCH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN
[40:38] NAME. BUT YE SHALL SEE ME. THAT'S THE
[40:42] CLASS WE'RE AFTER IS THE ONE THAT CAN
[40:44] LOOK UP AND SEE GOD IN HIS MERCY AND IN
[40:47] HIS PRESENCE.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL SEE ME. YOU CAN SEE HE
[40:52] PROMISED YOU CAN SEE HIM. AMEN. IT IT'S
[40:54] NOT IT'S NOT THAT you have to be a
[40:56] certain people to see him. HE SO
[40:58] MANIFESTED HIMSELF THAT THEY SEEN him in
[41:01] Africa and they seen him IN INDIA. THEY
[41:03] SEEN HIM AT A GRASS HUTCH. IN INDIA,
[41:06] THEY SAW IT. COME ON, CHURCH. THEY
[41:07] DIDN'T EVEN HAVE SHOES TO WEAR TO
[41:09] CHURCH. THEY DIDN'T HAVE FOOD TO EAT
[41:11] WHILE THEY GATHERED, BUT THEY STILL SEEN
[41:14] HIM. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. IT DON'T COST YOU
[41:17] ANYTHING TO SEE HIM. [laughter] AMEN.
[41:19] YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE WEALTH TO SEE
[41:20] HIM. JUST OPEN YOUR EYES. HE IS AMONG US
[41:24] TODAY, THE SAME AS HE WAS IN THE DAYS
[41:27] THAT BEFORE OUR TIMES.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; YOU, it's a ye class. This is a ye
[41:32] class.
[41:35] And God can TAKE YOU A HILLBILLY OFF of
[41:38] the river in Arkansas and show you this
[41:41] revelation.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; And and I I I sometimes sometimes I I
[41:49] want I I wish I could maybe get the
[41:52] expression we didn't start where we are.
[41:58] Why did I even start as a pastor w with
[42:00] with the people and the blessing and
[42:02] brother Ray behind me and I that wasn't
[42:04] the way we started.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Matt saw me. I hadn't been saved very
[42:09] long. You come to that house, we had
[42:10] $23,000 in it and it sat next to that uh
[42:14] next to the river down there and had a
[42:16] railroad track that went by. You
[42:18] remember it? Vernon remembers. He
[42:20] remembers coming over the house and
[42:21] helping me with a hammer and we had a
[42:23] $650 car. We beat the hood out on it and
[42:26] he bought the expensive spray paint and
[42:28] we spray painted that baby with a can
[42:30] and I drove that to work. Amen. And he
[42:33] loan me his car to preach out of cuz we
[42:36] didn't have Amen. uh a little G to give
[42:38] us a Cadillac at that time in our life.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; We didn't have it folks. IT WAS SMALL
[42:44] AND IT WAS LITTLE. BUT I SEEN SOMETHING.
[42:47] I SEEN SOMETHING. AND I SEEN MORE THAN
[42:50] WILLIAM BRANDOM. I SEEN MORE THAN JUST A
[42:52] GROUP OF PEOPLE. I SAW THE COMING OF THE
[42:55] LORD. I SAW THE APPEARING OF ALMIGHTY
[42:57] GOD IN MY GENERATION. AND IT DONE
[43:00] SOMETHING INSIDE OF THIS HILLBILLY'S
[43:02] HEART. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.
[43:04] I'M NOT THE BEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD.
[43:06] BUT I'LL TELL [laughter] YOU THIS, IT'S
[43:08] JESUS CHRIST THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY,
[43:11] AND FOREVER. AND IF HE'S ALIVE, IF HE'S
[43:14] ALIVE, THEN I DON'T HAVE TO BE THE BEST
[43:16] PREACHER. HE SAID HE WOULD SHOW UP. IF
[43:19] HE'S ALIVE, I DON'T HAVE TO HEAL THE
[43:21] SICK. HE SAID HE WOULD HEAL THE SICK. HE
[43:23] WOULD RAISE THE DEAD. HE WOULD SAVE THE
[43:25] LOST. HE WOULD FILL WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[43:27] THIS IS NOT OUR MINISTRY. IT'S THE
[43:30] MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN THAT IS
[43:33] COMING IN THIS HANDS TO MANIFEST THE
[43:36] POWER OF GOD OVER THIS GENERATION.
[43:40] SO, WAYNE, I WANT TO GET HIGHER. LOOK AT
[43:42] IT. LOOK AT IT AND SEE IT FOR WHAT IT
[43:45] IS. AND IT'LL BEGIN TO RAISE YOU.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; SEE, it's you you don't look at the end
[43:52] and say, "Well, that that that wasn't
[43:54] how we got there, right?"
[43:58] &gt;&gt; You see the blessing on people. I always
[43:59] loved Brother Bisc for it. Brother Bisll
[44:02] was a He actually was a very wealthy
[44:05] man. I don't know how many y'all know
[44:06] that. One of his grandsons told me one
[44:08] time they was in school and found it out
[44:09] and was shocked [panting]
[44:12] that they that their granddad was that
[44:14] wealthy because they didn't know it. But
[44:16] he made his money in auction companies.
[44:18] He's a great businessman. And he got rid
[44:20] of he got out of that and got into the
[44:22] preaching of the gospel and traveled and
[44:25] all that. You know, he did it because he
[44:26] loved the message. That's why he did it.
[44:29] And you know what's powerful? Amen. is
[44:33] every time that I ever heard brother
[44:35] Bisco talk about his prosperity, you
[44:37] know what he said? He said it's because
[44:40] of my respect to the ministry of brother
[44:41] Brandham.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; He said that's why it was. God showed
[44:46] him early on that it was not just a man.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Bisco tells it, don't he? He
[44:52] said, I don't know why we're on brother
[44:54] Ed, but we'll just tell it. As brother
[44:55] Bis tells it, he said, "We're riding
[44:57] down the road." And he said, "We're
[44:58] going moose hunting." And he said,
[45:00] "Brother Brandham is just Brother
[45:01] Brandham." And he points over and said,
[45:02] "The lady I prayed for the other night's
[45:04] in that house right there." And he said,
[45:05] "We're hundreds of miles from where the
[45:08] meeting took place, but that woman he
[45:10] had prayed for," he said, "I knew her
[45:12] and I knew that that's where they were
[45:14] keeping her." Amen. And he said he was
[45:16] exactly right where she was and who was
[45:18] there. He said, "My goodness, you you
[45:21] because brother Biscll could see I know
[45:24] Brother Brandham, but whoever that is
[45:26] pointing that out,
[45:28] &gt;&gt; that's something different than that man
[45:29] sitting in the seat next to me." And
[45:31] brother, brother Brisco said, "We're
[45:32] driving down THE ROAD AND GOING MOOSE
[45:34] HUNTING." HE SAID, "BROTHER Bam said,
[45:35] "He's here." And he said, "I SEEN THE
[45:36] WHISKERS STICK OUT ON HIS FACE." HE SAID
[45:39] HE TURNED REAL PALE and the whiskers
[45:41] STUCK OUT ON HIS FACE. HE SAID ALL OF A
[45:43] SUDDEN A MOOSE JUST WALKS UP OVER THERE.
[45:45] AND BROTHER BIS SAID, "I JUST GOT SHOT
[45:47] THE MOOSE." AND BROTHER BISL SAYS,
[45:48] "BROTHER RANDOM TOLD HIM, HE SAID,
[45:50] LISTEN, HE SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS every
[45:52] time he comes." BUT THE BISCLL GOES HOME
[45:54] AND GETS ELEVATED FROM A LITTLE BITTY
[45:56] NOTHING JOB THAT HE STARTED AS A JANITOR
[45:59] AND GOES TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE
[46:00] COMPANY BECAUSE OF AN IDEA THAT GOD GAVE
[46:03] HIM IN INSPIRATION. WHAT LIFTED HIM? IT
[46:06] WAS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WHAT LIFTED
[46:08] RAY ERICSON FROM A PIG FARMER TO A
[46:10] MINISTER KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD? WHAT
[46:12] LIFTED HIM? THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[46:15] WHAT LIFTED WAYNE LAWSON OUT OF THE
[46:17] HILLS OF ARKANSAS? THE MESSAGE OF THE
[46:19] HOUR. WHAT LIFTED DONNIE REAGAN OUT OF
[46:22] BEING A PENTECOSTAL BOY? THE MESSAGE OF
[46:24] THE HOUR. WHAT LIFTED TIM PUIT? THE
[46:27] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND IF IT LIFTED
[46:29] THEM and it it can lift you, IT CAN LIFT
[46:32] A PIG FARMER. IT CAN LIFT A HILLBILLY.
[46:34] IT CAN LIFT YOU OUT OF YOUR SITUATIONS.
[46:37] BUT YOU CAN'T LET SOMEBODY TELL YOU it's
[46:40] not right.
[46:45] Come on.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; You know,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; the the the the the magnitude
[46:52] of what this message really means. I do
[46:56] not have the language to express to you.
[46:59] [panting]
[47:00] [snorts]
[47:00] &gt;&gt; In Luke the 17th chapter, people read
[47:02] this for 2,000 years. His own words,
[47:05] "Even shall it be when the Son of Man is
[47:07] revealed." That's Jesus's words
[47:09] &gt;&gt; laid in the Bible for 2,000 years.
[47:14] but is manifest in the ministry of
[47:17] William Brandham.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Bama repeatedly says there
[47:22] it is. There's the manifestation. Here's
[47:24] the sign in Matthew 24 and 27. As the
[47:28] lightning cometh out of the east and
[47:29] shineth under the west, so also shall
[47:31] the coming of the son of man be. Out of
[47:33] the east under the west, there's the
[47:35] light. Brother said, just like the sun.
[47:37] You ever looked at the picture of a of a
[47:39] sunrise?
[47:40] you look. Are you sure it's a sunrise or
[47:42] is it a sunset? Cuz they look the same.
[47:46] It's only if you know your directions
[47:48] that you can tell the difference. If
[47:50] it's a sunrise or a sunset, if you think
[47:53] the east is west and the west is east,
[47:54] you will get them mixed up because there
[47:56] is no difference. It's the same sun.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Look at a sunset on the water and look
[48:03] at a sunrise on the water and you tell
[48:06] me just by looking without knowing the
[48:08] time.
[48:10] But if I add the time, I CAN SAY THE
[48:13] SAME SUN that rose in the east is NOW
[48:15] SETTING IN THE WEST. IF YOU KNOW THE
[48:17] TIME, YOU KNOW THE SETTING. LISTEN. IF
[48:19] HE SAID THE RISING OF THE SUN WAS THE
[48:22] MINISTRY OF JESUS IN THE BODY OF JESUS
[48:25] OF NAZARETH THAT HAD COME TO DIE FOR OUR
[48:27] SINS, THEN THE SETTING OF THE SUN WILL
[48:30] BE THE SAME JESUS. HE WILL LOOK THE
[48:33] SAME. HE WILL BE THE SAME. HE WILL HAVE
[48:36] THE SAME SIGNS, THE SAME POWER, THE SAME
[48:38] ANOINTING.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You got to be so careful, folks, because
[48:43] brother Brandham never one time said,
[48:45] "Come here. Is this what Paul did?"
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Not one time.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Not one time DOES HE SAY, "WELL, I'M
[48:55] GOING to turn my back to you and show
[48:57] you that Paul's ministry is here."
[49:01] [clears throat]
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:04] Because Paul didn't have the ministry of
[49:07] the son of man for the evening message.
[49:10] He was telling the Gentiles what TO LOOK
[49:14] FOR.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BUILDING EXPECTATION FOR THE END
[49:18] TIME MESSAGE OF WILLIAM RANDOM.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; LOOK. AMEN. He shall appear. Amen. Now,
[49:24] if you're if you're looking in your
[49:25] Bible, Amen. I I'll say this. God God
[49:29] our Lord Jesus said he was light. I'm
[49:31] the light of the world. And if you look
[49:33] in the Bible, the word is light. And if
[49:36] you ask yourself this, light, light from
[49:39] the east to the west, the son of man
[49:41] light. If you asked yourself this, what
[49:43] is the source of light?
[49:45] &gt;&gt; What's the source of light? Genesis
[49:47] first chapter. In the beginning, see, it
[49:49] was all dark and then God said,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; so the word is the source of light.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; So [snorts] if it's going to be an
[49:57] evening light, there has to be a word
[50:00] source of light. Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; The word source is I will appear unto
[50:05] them the second time without sin under
[50:07] salvation. I will reveal myself. I will
[50:10] come. The son of man will come. That's
[50:12] the word source of it. But it don't
[50:14] become light until the messenger of the
[50:17] hour comes and picks up the scriptures
[50:20] and begins to make it live. Then it
[50:22] becomes light.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And the same light that was in the east
[50:25] comes in the west. What did Jesus do? He
[50:27] just fulfilled scripture. And when that
[50:29] lie of that ministry struck the seed
[50:32] that was laying in Peter, Peter went
[50:34] into revival.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT STRUCK THE PHARISEE, THE
[50:37] PHARISEE SLAPPED him and said it was of
[50:39] the devil.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT LIGHT STRIKES THE RIGHT SEED,
[50:44] there is expectation in that seed
[50:46] because it's light. How many realizes
[50:48] that Jesus himself walking on the earth
[50:50] was light?
[50:52] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 42, WATCH THE SCRIPTURE. THUS
[50:55] SAITH THE LORD GOD, THAT THOU created
[50:56] heavens and earth, and stretched them
[50:58] out, and spread them on the earth, that
[51:00] which cometh out of it. He giveth
[51:02] breathe unto the people uh uh unto it,
[51:04] and spirit to them that walketh therein.
[51:07] I am the Lord, have called thee in
[51:09] righteousness, and will hold thine hand,
[51:11] and will keep thee, and give thee for a
[51:13] covenant of the people, for a light unto
[51:16] the Gentile.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; I will give THEE FOR A COVENANT, and a
[51:21] light unto the Gentile. Now watch in
[51:23] Matthew chapter 4 the 13th and 14th
[51:26] verses. And leaving Nazareth, he came
[51:28] across Capernaum and upon the sea coast
[51:30] and the borders of Zylon and Ethylon.
[51:32] And that it MIGHT BE FULFILLED WHICH WAS
[51:35] SPOKEN BY ISAIAH the prophet, saying
[51:37] that the land of Zeblon, the land of
[51:38] Nethalum, were the way of the sea beyond
[51:40] the Jordan and the Gentiles, the people
[51:42] which set in darkness saw great light.
[51:46] They didn't see a electric light. They
[51:48] didn't see a a bulb. They didn't see the
[51:51] sun s u n hanging there. They seen the
[51:55] word
[51:57] &gt;&gt; of Isaiah
[51:59] &gt;&gt; walking on the seashore. And it was a
[52:02] light unto them that sat in darkness.
[52:05] The people that sat in darkness saw
[52:07] great light. In Isaiah 9 and2 he said,
[52:09] "People that walk in darkness have seen
[52:11] great light, and they that dwell in the
[52:12] shadow of death upon him have light
[52:14] shined." In in in the book OF LUKE, WHEN
[52:17] ZECHARIAH was birthing, Amen. and he was
[52:20] going to bring forth. What did he
[52:21] prophesy concerning the Lord Jesus? HE
[52:24] SAID, "THOU TENDER MERCY OF our God,
[52:26] WHEREBY THE DAYSPRING ON HIGH VISITED us
[52:29] to give light to them which set in
[52:31] darkness and in the shadow of death TO
[52:33] GUIDE OUR FEET into the way OF PEACE."
[52:36] SO JOHN'S FATHER identified Jesus with
[52:39] the scriptures. It was Simeon in LUKE
[52:41] CHAPTER 2. HE DID THE SAME THING. AMEN.
[52:43] AND THE BIBLE SAID IT WAS REVEALED UNTO
[52:45] HIM BY THE HOLY GHOST that he wouldn't
[52:47] see death before he seen the Lord's
[52:49] Christ. AND HE CAME BY SPIRIT INTO THE
[52:51] TEMPLE. IT WAS IN THE time of the
[52:53] presentation of the baby. Isn't that
[52:54] pretty good? He got the at the time it
[52:56] was being presented is the time Simeon
[52:59] came. Amen. He came at the right time.
[53:01] How many knows when they circumcised
[53:03] babies? It was the eighth day, wasn't
[53:04] it? On the eighth day, Simeon went into
[53:07] the temple where the the presentation OF
[53:09] THE CHILD WAS BEING MADE. AND HE RAN AND
[53:12] GRABBED THE WORD IN FLESH. AMEN. AND
[53:15] HELD IT UP TO THE CONGREGATION AND SAID,
[53:17] "HE'S A LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES." CAN
[53:21] YOU IMAGINE, CHURCH?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; That people thought he was absolutely
[53:25] crazy.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; But he showed up at the right time at
[53:29] the presentment of the word MADE FLESH
[53:32] AND IDENTIFIED WHAT THEY WERE ALREADY
[53:34] looking at it. They were already
[53:37] BEHOLDING IT. BUT NOW SOMEBODY WAS
[53:39] TAKING THE SCRIPTURE AND TELLING THEM
[53:41] WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT. THIS IS NOT A
[53:43] NORMAL CHILD. THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER
[53:46] MESSAGE. THIS IS THE LIGHT OF THE
[53:48] GENTILES AND HE HELD UP THE WORD made
[53:51] flesh so the whole place could see it
[53:53] and made the ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE DAY OF
[53:55] PRESENTMENT. [laughter] AMEN. HE WENT TO
[53:57] THE TABERNACLE ON THE EIGHTH DAY TO SEE
[54:00] CHRIST. I TELL YOU WHAT, AND HERE WE ARE
[54:02] AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THE PRESENTMENT OF
[54:06] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND IT'S THE
[54:08] EIGHTH DAY AND WE'RE IN THE TEMPLE. AND
[54:11] IT'S NOT CHRIST WHO'S WITH US. IT'S
[54:13] CHRIST THAT IS IN US. AND HE'S RIGHT
[54:16] HERE THIS MORNING THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[54:18] TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, brother, what do
[54:24] you mean eighth day? Isn't Sunday the
[54:25] eighth day? Isn't this is Sunday,
[54:28] right?" Okay. Okay. I just want to make
[54:29] sure I lost my mind. Th This is Sunday.
[54:32] S U N D A Y. Tomorrow's Monday.
[54:34] Yesterday was Saturday.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; So, this is eighth day, right?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; But somebody going to help me.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; This is eighth day. Right.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; If it's Sunday, it's the eighth day of
[54:46] the week.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Well, if you woke up in the hospital
[54:51] after a car wreck, they'd say, "What day
[54:52] is it?
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Where are you at? YEAH.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT DAY is it? Come on. Do you know
[54:59] what day it is?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT SEASON YOU'RE LIVING
[55:02] IN?
[55:03] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE [snorts] LIVING IN THE SEASON OF
[55:05] THE PRESENTMENT WHERE WE'RE NOT JUST IN
[55:08] ANOTHER CHURCH AGE. THIS IS NOT SATURDAY
[55:10] AND IT'S NOT MONDAY. IT'S THE FIRST DAY
[55:13] OF THE WEEK AGAIN. AMEN. AND THE SON OF
[55:16] MAN HAS BEEN RISEN UP TO WAVE OVER THE
[55:20] PEOPLE.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. THEY THOUGHT SIMEON WAS
[55:26] CRAZY. AND THERE'S been a lot of people
[55:28] thought I was crazy, too. BUT I HAVE
[55:30] SEEN THAT IN the evening time, there
[55:33] shall be light. As long as Hebrews 9 was
[55:36] in the Bible, as long as Luke 17 laid in
[55:39] the Bible, as long as Matthew 24 was
[55:41] JUST IN THE BIBLE, YOU GOT A right to
[55:43] question it. But once IT HAS BEEN
[55:45] MANIFESTED, IT IS NOW SIN TO DISBELIEVE
[55:49] THE FULFILLED WORD OF YOUR AGE. I AM NOT
[55:52] A SINNER, BROTHER. I AM A BELIEVER. AND
[55:55] I BELIEVE THE SCRIPTURES HAVE BEEN
[55:57] FULFILLED IN THIS GENERATION. NOT JUST
[55:59] SO I COULD PREACH ABOUT IT, BUT THAT I
[56:01] MIGHT HAVE LIGHT. I MIGHT HAVE LIGHT IN
[56:03] THE DARK AGE OF LEADSIA TO KNOW WHO I
[56:06] AM. TO KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT. TO KNOW
[56:08] WHERE I'M GOING. I TELL YOU ONE THING,
[56:10] the way to know, Amen, is to know who
[56:12] you are. Then you know what you're not.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; I I don't have to know every name in the
[56:19] airport.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; I just got to know my name.
[56:23] I don't have to sit there and listen
[56:25] through EVERY NAME.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO. I guess
[56:29] they SIT AND LISTEN TO EVERY NAME AND
[56:31] THEY'RE LIKE, "SHH, THEY'RE CALLING
[56:32] NAMES." I DON'T HAVE TO SH BECAUSE I
[56:34] KNOW WHEN my name's called.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I CAN HEAR IT, MAN. YOU CAN BE WALKING
[56:37] ACROSS, YOU JUST HEAR YOUR NAME. YOU'RE
[56:39] LIKE, "THEY'RE talking to me." Maybe I'm
[56:41] designed that way. I don't know. But if
[56:42] you know who you are, you know who you
[56:44] ain't.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. THERE'S A LOT OF
[56:48] FOOLISH VIRGIN AND THERE'S A LOT OF
[56:50] ANTICHRIST AND THERE'S A LOT OF SERPENT
[56:52] SEED AND I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH
[56:54] ALL WHO IS AND WHO IS WHAT. BY THE WAY,
[56:56] WHO DO YOU THINK THEY ARE AND HOW DO YOU
[56:58] THINK IT FITS? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW
[57:00] WHO I AM. SO, I KNOW WHO I AM.
[57:04] I'M AN ACTS 238 TONGUE-TALKING BABY BORN
[57:08] OF THE WORD OF GOD IN MY GENERATION. I
[57:11] SEE IT. I BELIEVE IT. I MANIFEST IT
[57:14] BECAUSE I AM THAT WORD CHILD. BUT THE
[57:17] BIBLE PROPHESIED WOULD COME IN THE AGE
[57:19] we're living in. I ain't got to keep up
[57:21] with what everybody else believes. I got
[57:22] to know what I believe.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ray, do you think the co
[57:30] was the mark of the beast? You know,
[57:32] because if you got that shot, that's the
[57:33] mark of the beast, right? And then if
[57:34] you had to sign a paper and if you had
[57:36] got your social security card and oh,
[57:38] well, maybe it's that bank card OR YOU
[57:40] IT'S AMAZING ALL OF THE CHARTS AND ALL
[57:43] THE IDEAS. AND I I TELL YOU, I COULD
[57:45] STOP RIGHT here and just punt kick this
[57:46] conspiracy nonsense. Half y'all KEEP
[57:49] YOURSELVES SO TIED UP IN YOUTUBE and
[57:50] Facebook and Instagram and some other
[57:52] gram or some OTHER SOMETHING THAT YOU
[57:54] GOT YOUR MIND SO FULL OF OF OF CONCEPTS
[57:56] AND IDEAS. AMEN. YOU GOT THE MARK of the
[57:59] beast OVER THERE AND YOU GOT TRIBULATION
[58:01] OVER THERE AND YOU GOT THIS OVER HERE.
[58:03] YOU NEVER GOT THAT OUT OF THE MESSAGE OF
[58:05] THE HOUR.
[58:07] IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE smarter
[58:09] because I don't know what YOU'RE TALKING
[58:10] ABOUT, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
[58:12] TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT AIN'T THE
[58:13] MESSAGE.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T that I can't read OR I CAN'T
[58:17] WATCH. I JUST CHOOSE NOT TO BECAUSE I
[58:20] NEED FAITH IN MY HEART THAT I WANT TO
[58:23] MAKE A RAPTURE. I WANT TO KNOW WHO I AM.
[58:25] I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I WANT TO
[58:27] KNOW WHERE I'm going.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; What do you think the mark of the beast
[58:32] is? I'll tell you what it ain't.
[58:36] because I can tell you what it is.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; It is denying the Holy Spirit.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And it's already in the earth.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; And if you want to put a name on it,
[58:51] it's joining the denominational system
[58:53] that opposes the message of the hour.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Now whether that's independent, Roman
[58:57] Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, whatever
[58:59] name you put on it, it's still the same
[59:01] thing. It ain't the Holy Ghost.
[59:05] That ain't in proper English, is it?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; It ain't the Holy Ghost. That's all I
[59:11] can tell you.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Wayne, don't you think we
[59:14] need to know it? Now, y'all y'all got to
[59:16] y'all got to watch me. I guess I'm a
[59:17] little bit of a I'm a little bit a
[59:19] stickler on this point. If I needed to
[59:21] know it, it'd be in this message.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You may need to feel important. I don't.
[59:29] Come on. Come on.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I come a long ways in my life to humble
[59:34] myself to what William Brandham said.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; And the more I humbled myself, the
[59:38] clearer the message got. And the more I
[59:40] humbled myself, the more powerful it
[59:42] got. And the more I humbled myself, I
[59:45] FOUND OUT WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM MEANT.
[59:46] The gift is getting YOURSELF
[59:50] &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE WAY.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD CAN'T USE YOU TILL YOU QUALIFY
[59:54] YOURSELF IN THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE
[59:57] MEANT TO MANIFEST.
[1:00:00] THAT'S PROBABLY TO SOMEBODY OUT on the
[1:00:02] line there.
[1:00:05] [laughter]
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; It's not legalist here. You can do
[1:00:11] whatever you want to,
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; but if I were you, I'd pull back from my
[1:00:15] conspiracies and study the message.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Now, Christ was the first one to raise
[1:00:24] from the prophets that topped in many
[1:00:26] places. He was the first fruits of those
[1:00:28] that slept and in the bride coming of
[1:00:30] Christ.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Now, you got to watch uh some people
[1:00:33] that have edited this sermon put the
[1:00:36] comma in the wrong place
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; cuz I listen to tapes
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; and I read
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; and I might not be a good English uh but
[1:00:47] when they put the comma in the wrong
[1:00:48] place, they change the meaning of less
[1:00:49] quote.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Brand wasn't talking about
[1:00:53] the bride coming out of denomination.
[1:00:56] He was talking about the bride coming of
[1:00:58] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; See, coming out of the church, there
[1:01:03] will have to be a sheath waved again in
[1:01:05] the last days. You all know what that
[1:01:07] sheath waving was. It was the first one
[1:01:09] in maturity, right? Yes, sir.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; The first one in maturity because there
[1:01:12] had been a maturing light.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And when the light changes, that's why
[1:01:17] you watch. See, because there's a light
[1:01:18] in the spring and there's a light in the
[1:01:21] fall.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And there's that August sun that has
[1:01:24] strength. The strength of the August sun
[1:01:26] is to cause separation between seed and
[1:01:28] shuck.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; That's the reason it gets so so and and
[1:01:32] you've heard me preach it about about
[1:01:34] soybean fields and how it comes a
[1:01:36] ripening season and part of it ain't as
[1:01:38] ripe as the others cuz maybe there's a
[1:01:39] shade tree in one corner of it and it it
[1:01:41] protects it from the strength of it. You
[1:01:44] see, if you've grew up under a shade
[1:01:46] tree somewhere that thought preaching
[1:01:48] the strength of the message might be too
[1:01:49] much for somebody, then it shades you
[1:01:52] from certain areas of it and and you're
[1:01:54] you're allowed uh uh to to be a little
[1:01:57] behind in some areas.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; But the strength of the message is what
[1:02:03] matures you to who you really are.
[1:02:07] So, so when when it takes the strength
[1:02:09] of the teaching of the son of man to
[1:02:12] show you that the son of man don't only
[1:02:14] manifest in a in a in a prophet, he'll
[1:02:17] also manifest in the bride.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; See, but that that's going to take the
[1:02:22] strength of it. Somebody's somebody's
[1:02:24] going to have to to preach it with
[1:02:25] strength. And and here a prophet had
[1:02:27] come to maturity. Now, William Brandham
[1:02:30] himself, the man William Brandom was not
[1:02:33] actually the sheath waving. How many
[1:02:34] knows the sheath waving's Christ?
[1:02:37] But Christ had a bride body.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; So somebody had to come to maturity
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; in the age we're living in.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Now that man's name is William
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Brandom.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Now he brother Brandham stood and his
[1:02:52] life the manifestation of the word that
[1:02:55] happened in him was waved over the
[1:02:58] people to identify what had happened.
[1:03:01] What had happened is men was trying to
[1:03:03] present JESUS AND THEY WERE CHANGING HIM
[1:03:06] FROM THE BIBLE. They were they WERE
[1:03:07] TEACHING THE BIBLE JESUS AND THEN THEY
[1:03:09] WERE SAYING BUT see he DON'T HEAL TODAY
[1:03:11] OR THEY WOULD SAY BUT YOU KNOW BUT THIS
[1:03:13] IS NOT A PART OF IT TODAY BUT THEY WERE
[1:03:15] CHANGING IT BUT THE reason they were
[1:03:17] changing it is because their
[1:03:18] denomination couldn't produce it.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT HERE comes a messenger. Amen.
[1:03:24] That's don't have to produce nothing.
[1:03:26] He's trying to teach you it's the word
[1:03:28] because you know something's happening
[1:03:30] and it's so supernatural. Some people
[1:03:32] think it's the devil.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, WATCH NOW. HALLELUJAH. THE
[1:03:37] SHEATH GOT TO BE WAVED AND FOR THE FIRST
[1:03:39] TIME will come forth for the bride age.
[1:03:42] Now, there's some people that are really
[1:03:44] uh they're really anti-bride age. But
[1:03:46] but you know when I'm a I'm an Arkansas
[1:03:49] hillbilly folks and I didn't ever have
[1:03:51] any term in my dictionary that was bride
[1:03:54] age. I didn't even know. Did you,
[1:03:55] brother Ray, before you come to the
[1:03:56] message? Did is anybody in here ever
[1:03:59] heard the term bride age before you come
[1:04:00] in the message?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; So where did that come from anyhow?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Help me out now.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; The term bride age come from who?
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; That's what I thought. So it's not a
[1:04:12] Baptist idea and it's not a Lutheran
[1:04:14] idea.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't my idea.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; But one day this hillbilly is reading
[1:04:18] Rise of the Sun and Brother Bram said,
[1:04:20] "For the first time." Ah, for the first
[1:04:24] time then. This is not the third time it
[1:04:26] happened. This is not the fifth time it
[1:04:28] happened. THIS IS THE FIRST time that
[1:04:30] it's happened. For a bride age, amen.
[1:04:33] There will be a resurrection out of dark
[1:04:36] denominationalism will be a MESSAGE THAT
[1:04:38] THE FULL MATURITY of the word has turned
[1:04:41] AGAIN INTO POWER AND IS WAVED over the
[1:04:44] people by the same signs and wonders
[1:04:45] that he did back there. SEE, IT'S THE
[1:04:48] FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD. HE WAS THE
[1:04:50] MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD. SO IS IT
[1:04:52] TODAY? GOD'S WORD HAS BEEN FULLY
[1:04:55] MANIFESTED. THAT'S THE LIGHT. That's the
[1:04:58] light. IT'S BEEN FULLY MANIFESTED. WHEN
[1:05:00] YOU LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, AND ISA IN
[1:05:02] ZACHCHARIAH, HE SAYS, "IN THE EVENING
[1:05:05] TIME SHALL BE LIGHT." WHAT'S HE TALKING
[1:05:06] ABOUT? THERE'LL COME A MESSAGE THAT WILL
[1:05:09] MANIFEST THE SCRIPTURES THAT HAVE BEEN
[1:05:11] PROMISED for this generation. Now, in
[1:05:14] Isaiah 45:22, he said, "Look unto me all
[1:05:16] ye saved into all the ends of the earth.
[1:05:19] Look unto me." Now, how you going to see
[1:05:21] Jesus then? Amen. If if William Brandon,
[1:05:24] brother Brandham prophesied by
[1:05:26] scriptures and said the corporal body of
[1:05:28] Jesus wouldn't be on the earth till the
[1:05:30] millennium.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But then Isaiah says you got to look
[1:05:33] unto him.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself says you shall see me. So
[1:05:38] the same invisible immortal God will
[1:05:42] appear behind mask as he always has.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; HE HAS APPEARED BEHIND THE veil in every
[1:05:48] age. HE APPEARED BEHIND VEIL. IT WOULD
[1:05:51] BE THEOPHONY WORD BEHIND VEIL IN EVERY
[1:05:54] ONE OF THEM INSTANCES. AND THEN BROTHER
[1:05:56] BRAM SAYS, BUT YOU GOT TO look away to
[1:05:57] Jesus. YOU GOT TO SEE beyond the veil.
[1:06:00] And once you look beyond the veil, you
[1:06:02] can see you can look, but what are you
[1:06:05] looking at?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; And how you look matters, right?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Now, if if if it wouldn't matter, watch
[1:06:12] Jesus. Amen. Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:06:15] in the wilderness. Even so, the son of
[1:06:17] man must be lifted up. Now watch, it
[1:06:21] must be lifted up. Now, if you go back
[1:06:24] here and you see that brother Brandham
[1:06:25] himself was saying the sheath waving of
[1:06:29] the Old Testament was only a type of the
[1:06:32] resurrection of Jesus and that in the
[1:06:34] last days, that same resurrected Christ
[1:06:37] will use the bride church. And brother
[1:06:39] Adam's the first one to mature to prove
[1:06:42] he is THE SEED. AND GOD TAKES HIS
[1:06:45] ministry and waves it over the people.
[1:06:49] That ministry is a light over the seed.
[1:06:53] Now, IT'S GOING TO STRIKE over a
[1:06:55] Pharisee and they're going to say,
[1:06:56] "BROTHER BROWN'S ANTICHRIST." BUT THEN
[1:06:59] IT'S going to strike OVER A
[1:07:00] PREDESTINATED SEED AND THEY'RE GOING TO
[1:07:02] SAY, "IT'S THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME LIGHT THAT WAS IN THE
[1:07:06] BIBLE, BUT IT MATTERS THE SEED THAT'S IN
[1:07:09] THE INDIVIDUAL." AMEN.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; It's the truth, folks.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; When you look at the Bible AND YOU SEE
[1:07:16] IN 1 Thessalonians 4 that the ministry
[1:07:19] of the rapture is the ministry of
[1:07:21] William Random, the Lord himself shall
[1:07:23] descend from heaven. But God will use a
[1:07:25] prophetic word in that generation. When
[1:07:28] you see that and then you read
[1:07:29] Revelations 10 and you see a mighty
[1:07:31] angel coming OUT OF HEAVEN WITH AN open
[1:07:33] book and you see that's William
[1:07:35] Brandham. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S HERE.
[1:07:37] AMEN. and he's traveling across the the
[1:07:39] nation AND HE SAYS GOD TOLD ME AMEN IN
[1:07:42] THE CAVE THE supernatural I'm having
[1:07:43] brother Timothy he said it was the first
[1:07:45] two pulls of my ministry and he TOLD ME
[1:07:47] THAT I COULD TAKE SOMEBODY AND I COULD
[1:07:49] hold their hand my left hand their right
[1:07:51] hand if you did it any other way it
[1:07:53] didn't work left hand to right hand he
[1:07:55] said then I would be able to tell them
[1:07:57] whatever disease they had and he said I
[1:07:59] was supposed to pray for them and if
[1:08:01] they didn't get healed I was supposed to
[1:08:03] say to them God bless you and pass them
[1:08:05] on by because there's a curse over into
[1:08:07] that life.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID, "THEN IT'LL COME TO PASS.
[1:08:10] YOU'LL have a second pull in your
[1:08:11] ministry. And then when YOU HAVE THAT
[1:08:13] SECOND PULL, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM
[1:08:15] the very secrets that's in the heart."
[1:08:19] Now, that was the second pull. If they
[1:08:21] don't believe the voice of the first
[1:08:22] sign, they will believe the voice of the
[1:08:25] second sign. So the first two signs THAT
[1:08:28] HE HAD, THAT SECOND SIGN WAS THE MESSIAH
[1:08:30] SIGN THAT WOULD be followed by a voice.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard voice of the sign?
[1:08:36] So he wasn't just going to give a sign,
[1:08:39] BUT JUST AS JESUS CAME into the earth in
[1:08:42] two signs, but his THIRD PULL WAS HE was
[1:08:45] going to take the WORD AND HE WAS GOING
[1:08:48] TO TO TELL THEM THE SCRIPTURES AND HOW
[1:08:50] THEY FIT AND HE WAS GOING TO FULFILL
[1:08:52] WORDS AND THEY WASN'T GOING TO LIKE THAT
[1:08:54] very well. So brother Brandham had his
[1:08:56] first two pulls and then he's out there
[1:08:57] in California and he sees the 10th
[1:09:00] vision or the third pull. How many ever
[1:09:01] read about it?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a there's a there's a lot
[1:09:04] in the world looking for brother Brandon
[1:09:05] to return to a tent and all that stuff.
[1:09:07] But really what it was is it was a tent
[1:09:09] vision. Amen. But but don't make it
[1:09:11] complicated because he also was fishing
[1:09:13] and he also was holding the baby shoe
[1:09:15] trying to lace it.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; So why is it that people can easily see
[1:09:20] that the baby shoe is symbolic and the
[1:09:21] fishing is symbolic but the tent ain't?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I mean if you if you just
[1:09:29] just common knowledge would tell you one
[1:09:32] two.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; So Moses had a natural tent.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; THIS MOSES HAD A SPIRITUAL tent
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; and he received a vision and it would be
[1:09:43] his third pull.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Now that third pull, now I'm bringing it
[1:09:46] up for a reason because the third PULL
[1:09:49] WAS THE PART OF the ministry that WOULD
[1:09:52] SPEAK FOR ITSELF. THE THIRD PULL WOULD
[1:09:55] NOT BE WILLIAM BRANDHAM. IT WOULD NOT BE
[1:09:58] HIM, BUT IT WOULD BE AMEN. IT WOULD BE
[1:10:00] CHRIST manifesting the son of man
[1:10:03] ministry through that body by voice. HE
[1:10:07] WOULD SPEAK IT OUT. BROTHER BAM WILL SAY
[1:10:09] IT HERE CLEARLY. Look away to Jesus. The
[1:10:11] third pull has now been vindicated.
[1:10:13] Amen. I'm sure you all know what it is.
[1:10:15] Y'all know what it is.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The third pull of William
[1:10:20] Brandham's ministry clearly is is the
[1:10:24] first fold of the seven seal, the coming
[1:10:26] of the Lord.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You can't look at his ministry without
[1:10:30] seeing the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't I'm I'm going I'm going to
[1:10:37] bring it further, but I want to just say
[1:10:38] this here in case you don't hear no
[1:10:39] more. That's the appearing of Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ. BUT IF YOU STOP it right there,
[1:10:44] the revival died in 1965.
[1:10:49] But if it was the ministry of Jesus
[1:10:51] Christ, THEN THE SAME REVIVAL BY THE
[1:10:54] SAME LIFE, BY THE SAME SIGN IS STILL
[1:10:57] ALIVE RIGHT NOW IN THE CHURCH of the
[1:11:00] living God. AND LET ME SAY THIS, OUR GOD
[1:11:03] DIDN'T DIE IN 1965. THEY DIDN'T BURY HIM
[1:11:06] IN JEFFERSONVILLE. WE BURIED HIS PROPHET
[1:11:09] IN JEFFERSONVILLE. BUT ONE OF THESE
[1:11:11] MORNINGS BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9, GOD'S GOING
[1:11:13] TO RAISE UP BROTHER BRANDHAM. AMEN. AND
[1:11:15] WE AND HE TOLD US HOW IT WAS GOING TO
[1:11:17] BE.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But you see this? The third pull
[1:11:22] has been properly identified. We know
[1:11:24] what it is. The third pull is here. So
[1:11:26] in 1963,
[1:11:28] the third pull is here. People that are
[1:11:30] looking for it, I'm sorry. It was there
[1:11:32] in 1963. LOOK AWAY TO JESUS. HE SAID
[1:11:35] THIS WILL BE THE THING THAT starts
[1:11:37] rapturing faith. He was telling you his
[1:11:39] ministry. The third pull is the opening
[1:11:41] of the word. The mysteries revealed. The
[1:11:44] third pull is the opening of seven
[1:11:46] seals. The third pull, remember what HE
[1:11:48] SAID WHEN HE WAS IN SABINO CANYON and he
[1:11:51] was praying about them angels coming to
[1:11:52] him and he had his hands lifted up and a
[1:11:54] sword struck his hands and when the
[1:11:56] sword struck his hands, HE SAID, "I WAS
[1:11:58] AFRAID." And a voice said, "Don't be
[1:12:00] afraid."
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; This is the third pull.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; This is the third pull. It's the word in
[1:12:09] the hand of a prophet. The voice come
[1:12:11] back. This is the third pull. What is
[1:12:13] it? Don't you fear it. It's been placed
[1:12:15] in your hand. Don't fear it. It's not
[1:12:17] your death. It's your ministry. LOOK,
[1:12:20] DON'T FEAR THE THIRD PULL. AMEN. Don't
[1:12:22] fear it. It's not your death. It's your
[1:12:24] ministry. IT'S THE PART OF THE MINISTRY
[1:12:26] OF BROTHER BRANDHAM THAT DIDN'T DIE WITH
[1:12:28] BROTHER BRANDHAM.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST TWO PULLS CAN ONLY BE OPERATED
[1:12:33] IN HIS PRESENCE. IT WAS IN THE MAN
[1:12:35] WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S NOT A MESSIAH SIGN
[1:12:38] WITH ANOTHER MAN. IT'S NOT A TAKING OF A
[1:12:40] HAND WITH ANOTHER MAN. BUT THAT THIRD
[1:12:43] PULL WASN'T THE MAN WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT
[1:12:46] WAS CHRIST. IT WAS CHRIST HIMSELF THAT
[1:12:49] WAS COMING TO HIM TO BE INTRODUCED.
[1:13:02] It was just teaching. Okay, that's one
[1:13:05] thing. But this is far greater than
[1:13:07] teaching, folks.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; This went beyond brother Eric. It went
[1:13:10] way beyond just teaching.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; In the message, look away to Jesus. Now,
[1:13:14] if you like the Hebrews 9 sermon, you
[1:13:17] can find it in Luke and then and then of
[1:13:19] course it paragraphs right off of look
[1:13:21] away to Jesus. Looking unto Jesus. All
[1:13:23] these sermons, amen, are coming from the
[1:13:26] inspiration out of Hebrews the 9th
[1:13:28] chapter. And brother Brandham then
[1:13:29] didn't look away to Jesus. He's coming
[1:13:32] into this lousy and condition and he's
[1:13:35] telling the people look away to Jesus
[1:13:38] and there's no no corporal body there.
[1:13:40] Now he's in the next few years, brother
[1:13:42] Richard, he's going to go all over
[1:13:44] America and he's going to say at the
[1:13:46] river he met me and said I'm going to
[1:13:48] introduce I'm bringing a message that'll
[1:13:50] introduce you for his second coming. and
[1:13:51] he goes and puts himself ON TRIAL AND
[1:13:54] ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. HE PUTS THIS
[1:13:56] MESSAGE on trial and he tried it all
[1:13:58] over the country in different places in
[1:14:01] different events and changed the venue
[1:14:03] many times. Now there's people coming
[1:14:05] along now behind him and they're trying
[1:14:07] to retry the case he tried in the 60s.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry. You're too late.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT A TRIAL OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM
[1:14:16] NOW. This is a TRIAL OF YOUR FAITH NOW.
[1:14:20] I am right.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE THAT? SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL,
[1:14:23] BROTHER RE'S HOME HERE AND HE'S WRONG."
[1:14:25] THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHAT HE
[1:14:27] DID AND what was true. IT'S JUST ABOUT
[1:14:30] YOUR FAITH NOW.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU can stand to believe it in
[1:14:33] the face of criticism or not.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS IS THAT HE PUT IT
[1:14:36] ON TRIAL and he says, "You're looking
[1:14:38] for nail scars." He said, "That's not
[1:14:40] the way he promised to appear." That's
[1:14:42] not the way. He said it was not the
[1:14:45] promise.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. When when Jesus
[1:14:49] appeared to Martin with nail scars and A
[1:14:52] CROWN ON HIS HEAD, MARTIN THREW AN
[1:14:53] INKWELL at him and told the devil to get
[1:14:55] out of his ROOM
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WASN'T TIME FOR THAT.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM KNEW IT WASN'T TIME FOR
[1:15:01] THAT, FOLKS.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "But it is time for the word of
[1:15:05] God to be made manifest." And then he
[1:15:07] began to pull out and show you the
[1:15:09] manifestation of the word in our
[1:15:11] generation. SO IF IT WAS JUST AN IDEA or
[1:15:14] a teaching, it would just be now more
[1:15:16] theology. But it's way beyond just
[1:15:18] theology and and in the message look
[1:15:20] away to Jesus, brother Bannon comes
[1:15:22] along and he tells us he tells us
[1:15:24] something that that if you can get this
[1:15:26] in your heart, it'll help you on every
[1:15:28] sermon you listen to in 1963 4 and 5 is
[1:15:31] that when he a lot of times is saying
[1:15:33] Jesus, he's talking about vindicated
[1:15:35] word.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the word being
[1:15:40] manifested. That's what he's really
[1:15:41] dealing with is the word being manifest.
[1:15:43] So he's telling you God has done
[1:15:45] something. Now look at that. Look at
[1:15:47] what he's doing. And he actually gives
[1:15:49] us five manifestations of the third
[1:15:51] pull. How many are aware of there are
[1:15:53] actually five manifestations?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands if you know there
[1:15:58] are five manifestations of the third
[1:15:59] pull. Brother actually talks about this
[1:16:02] and and and just just to bring them back
[1:16:04] to your memory. You remember brother was
[1:16:06] squirrel hunting
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; and he said I was thinking about the
[1:16:09] scriptures and I was thinking about Mark
[1:16:11] the 11th chapter and how that Jesus made
[1:16:14] that promise to his disciples. Amen. And
[1:16:17] he said to them if you say unto this
[1:16:18] mountain be thou moved. And brother said
[1:16:20] I was wondering how that Jesus would say
[1:16:23] if you say. If you say he said I
[1:16:26] wondered it wasn't what Jesus said it
[1:16:28] was what you say. And he said I was
[1:16:29] wondering how DOES THAT FIT IN THE
[1:16:31] BIBLE? AND A VOICE SPOKE to me out there
[1:16:33] in the woods and said, "Brother
[1:16:35] Brandon," he says, "It said to me, it's
[1:16:37] just as true as all other scriptures are
[1:16:40] true."
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And he SAID, "I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:16:43] I THOUGHT THAT THAT'S SO CONFUSING TO
[1:16:45] ME. HOW COULD IT BE?" AND he said,
[1:16:47] "There was another scripture confusing
[1:16:49] to me of how Moses, AMEN, TOLD GOD A
[1:16:51] better idea rather than destroying the
[1:16:53] children of Israel." He said, "It always
[1:16:55] confused me how Moses could tell God a
[1:16:58] better idea." He said, "But then the
[1:16:59] revelation came. It was Christ in Moses.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "SO IF CHRIST WAS IN MOSES,
[1:17:06] SPEAKING UNDER BLOOD of bulls AND GOATS,
[1:17:09] HOW ABOUT UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:17:11] CHRIST?" AND BROTHER B SAID, "WHAT IT'S
[1:17:13] GOING TO BE THEN IS DEITY IS GOING TO
[1:17:15] TAKE CONTROL OF HUMAN LIPS."
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; AND IT WON'T BE YOU SPEAKING.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Now that's paraphrasing, but
[1:17:23] just so you get the point. IT WON'T BE
[1:17:24] YOU SPEAKING.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE HIM SPEAKING through you. And
[1:17:30] brother man said just to prove it. He
[1:17:32] said I be to speak and you remember the
[1:17:34] story and he created squirrels three
[1:17:36] straight times and he said the devil
[1:17:38] said well the the woods are just full of
[1:17:39] them. HE SAID HE said well I sat there
[1:17:41] to about noon and never seen another
[1:17:43] squirrel. And he see what he done. He
[1:17:45] spoke those squirrels and then he come
[1:17:47] BACK AND HE TOLD THE CONGREGATION ABOUT
[1:17:49] IT. NOW IF YOU if you study closely many
[1:17:52] people get it confused and they get the
[1:17:54] first time he created squirrels confused
[1:17:55] with Hattie right? But it wasn't the
[1:17:57] first time. It was the second time it
[1:17:58] happened. So the second time it
[1:18:00] happened, brother Ram had been down in
[1:18:02] in Indiana down there where the rights
[1:18:05] lived and and you know how many enjoyed
[1:18:08] Melkazdc the other day. You study
[1:18:09] Melkazedc. Y'all enjoy that. And he was
[1:18:11] the king of Salem and the priest of the
[1:18:13] most high God. What a what a powerful
[1:18:15] study. Uh brother brother Howard. But
[1:18:17] you know where brother Brandham was when
[1:18:18] he created squirrels the second time? He
[1:18:20] was in Salem, Indiana.
[1:18:23] He was out there under a tree in the
[1:18:25] woods in Salem. and he's standing out
[1:18:28] there and brother said it was just like
[1:18:30] it was the time before and he said I
[1:18:32] created them squirrels and then remember
[1:18:34] he created squirrels and then he went
[1:18:36] back to the house and started telling
[1:18:38] the story that evening about it and he
[1:18:40] said but that last squirrel HE SAID I
[1:18:42] SHOT HIM BUT he went over and crawled
[1:18:44] under a log and I wasn't able to get him
[1:18:45] before it got dark and and and and one
[1:18:48] of the guys that was listening to it
[1:18:50] misheard it a little bit maybe and then
[1:18:52] the next morning he comes in in prayer
[1:18:54] and he's talking about it they're
[1:18:56] talking about going hunting and the guy
[1:18:57] says, "Well, if Brother Brandham told us
[1:18:59] the truth,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; he'll go out there and find that other
[1:19:02] squirrel today."
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Y'all ever remember him saying that?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, be careful what you say."
[1:19:08] Brother Bram said,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; "And that guy was making a liar out of
[1:19:12] Brother Brandham."
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "I had never
[1:19:15] said it like that."
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; But he said, "When I got out there, I
[1:19:18] told the Lord, Lord, if I don't find
[1:19:20] that squirrel, they're going to think I
[1:19:22] was lying to them." And he said, "I was
[1:19:25] standing around there and I looked
[1:19:27] around and saw a a a little thing laying
[1:19:30] there on the ground." He says, "THE
[1:19:32] VOICE SAID TO ME, just say where it'll
[1:19:34] be."
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO INSTEAD OF NOW SPEAKING a
[1:19:38] squirrel AND SHOOTING IT, HE'S NOW
[1:19:40] SAYING WHERE A DEAD SQUIRREL IS GOING TO
[1:19:41] BE so he can find it to prove he wasn't
[1:19:43] lying to him.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; AND HE SPOKE HE SPOKE IT'LL BE LAYING
[1:19:47] RIGHT THERE UNDER THAT AND WALKED OVER
[1:19:48] THERE AND PICKED THAT squirrel up and
[1:19:50] then took it down to Hattie Wright's
[1:19:52] house. And he was going to he was going
[1:19:54] to take Hattie write some foods, you
[1:19:56] know. Amen. Amen. Hadtie was going to
[1:19:58] cook for him, but brother Ram cooked for
[1:19:59] her. Amen. And and HE TOOK THAT HE TOOK
[1:20:02] THAT SQUIRREL IN THERE AND STARTED
[1:20:03] TELLING that story and Haddie was
[1:20:06] listening TO THE STORY AND SAID,
[1:20:07] "BROTHER BRANDOM, HOW IN THE WORLD did
[1:20:10] that happen?" That's when he said, "Now,
[1:20:12] Hattie, I'm going to tell you this. IT
[1:20:14] COULD ONLY BE THE SAME JEHOVAH GYRA THAT
[1:20:17] WAS WITH ABRAHAM up there on the
[1:20:19] mountain that created that realm. HE
[1:20:21] CREATED THAT SQUIRREL OUT THERE IN THEM
[1:20:23] WOODS and had he SAID, "THAT AIN'T
[1:20:25] NOTHING BUT the truth." LOOK WHAT
[1:20:28] HAPPENED. BROTHER BRANDHAM WAVED OVER
[1:20:30] HER. AMEN. HE WAVED OVER HER THE REALITY
[1:20:34] OF THE SPOKEN WORD. THAT LIGHT WAS LAID
[1:20:37] OVER HER. AND SHE DIDN'T SAY, "OH,
[1:20:39] THAT'S SUCH FANATICISM, BROTHER. OH, I
[1:20:41] can't ACCEPT THAT. CREATION BY THE
[1:20:43] SPOKEN word of a dead animal just to
[1:20:45] prove you're a prophet.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; I can't accept that. No, sir." SHE SAID,
[1:20:50] "THAT'S NOTHING BUT the truth, BROTHER
[1:20:52] BRANDHAM." AND HE SAID, "THERE, SHE SAID
[1:20:54] the right thing." HE SAID, "JUST LIKE
[1:20:56] THAT SARAPHENEICIAN WOMAN IN THE BIBLE
[1:20:58] SAID THE RIGHT THING." SHE SAID THE
[1:21:00] RIGHT THING AND HE SAID, "HATTIE, you
[1:21:03] ask whatever you want." Now there that
[1:21:05] that manifestation was already taking
[1:21:07] place on animal life just like it did in
[1:21:09] the Bible in Genesis 1 when God created
[1:21:11] the animals. Now it's going to move to
[1:21:13] human life. Look at the evolution of the
[1:21:15] third pool. And it moved from the animal
[1:21:17] life AND NOW HE WAS SAYING TO HATTIE,
[1:21:19] "HATTIE, WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?" Brother
[1:21:21] Brandham said, "There was a sick uh
[1:21:22] sister there in a wheelchair. She was a
[1:21:25] really poor woman." And he said, SHE
[1:21:27] SAID TO HIM, "WHATEVER YOU HAVE DESIRE."
[1:21:29] AND SHE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDOM, I DON'T
[1:21:30] KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR." SHE SAID, HE
[1:21:33] SAID, "WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?" SHE SAID,
[1:21:34] "WELL, I DESIRE THE THE LIFE OF MY
[1:21:36] CHILDREN." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[1:21:38] "THEN THUS SAITH THE LORD, I GIVE THEM
[1:21:40] TO YOU, HADDIE, IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:21:42] CHRIST." WATCH THAT THIRD PULL, FOLKS.
[1:21:45] ONCE THAT THIRD PULL BEGIN TO be waved
[1:21:47] over her.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And when IT WAS WAVED OVER HER, HER
[1:21:51] ACCEPTANCE OF IT THEN ACTIVATED HER
[1:21:54] VOICE IN THE SAME THING SHE WAS
[1:21:57] ACTIVATED TO ACT IN. LISTEN, I'M GOING
[1:21:59] TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. This message
[1:22:00] ain't just for brother Random in the
[1:22:02] 60s. Amen. AND WHEN YOU'RE SITTING HERE
[1:22:04] AND YOU'RE HEARING THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:22:06] HOUR, DON'T YOU LET NO DEVIL TELL YOU
[1:22:08] THAT WAS JUST FOR HATTY WRIGHT. BECAUSE
[1:22:10] GOD IS NOT A RESPECTORATE PERSON. AND IF
[1:22:13] YOU CAN ACCEPT IT THAT GOD CAN DO IT,
[1:22:16] YOU'VE GOT THE SAME RIGHT RIGHT HERE
[1:22:18] THIS MORNING TO TELL THAT DEVIL, I GOT A
[1:22:21] BABY, AND I'M GOING TO LAY CLAIM TO IT
[1:22:23] BY THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; WHY? [screaming] WHY WAS HE WAVING IT?
[1:22:29] WHY DID BROTHER BRANDHAM TELL IT? WHY
[1:22:31] DID WAYNE LAWSON HEAR IT YEARS LATER?
[1:22:34] BECAUSE IN THE DAYS OF the voice OF THE
[1:22:35] SEVENTH ANGEL, THE MYSTERY OF GOD WOULD
[1:22:38] BE REVEALED. AND AS HE BEGINS TO WAVE IT
[1:22:40] OVER THEM, BROTHER BRANDHAM KNEW, GOD
[1:22:42] KNEW. When Wayne Lawson heard it, HE WAS
[1:22:44] GOING TO TELL CROWDS ALL OVER THE WORLD,
[1:22:46] I WAS GOING TO GO FROM CORNER TO CORNER
[1:22:48] SAYING, "GOD DID SOMETHING IN THE WOODS
[1:22:51] IN 1950S AND DONE IT IN A LITTLE CABIN.
[1:22:54] AND IF HE DONE IT THERE, HE CAN DO IT IN
[1:22:56] YOUR CHURCH. HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR PEW.
[1:22:58] HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR HOME. YOU DON'T
[1:23:00] HAVE TO BE HIGH CLASS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:23:03] BE NOBODY. YOU GOT TO BE A BELIEVER.
[1:23:10] YOU'VE heard me tell it, but I think it
[1:23:11] must be told. But my my grandmother,
[1:23:14] Brother Vernon's mama, said she desired
[1:23:17] to meet Hatty Wright her whole after she
[1:23:20] come into the message, she started
[1:23:21] following the message in the 40s in
[1:23:23] Jonesboro in 47, followed it all the way
[1:23:25] through. And after brother Bam had
[1:23:27] passed and went on, she wanted to meet
[1:23:28] this this Hatty Wright they all talked
[1:23:30] about. Of course, all the mamas wanted
[1:23:32] to meet her, you know, and and she said
[1:23:34] she went to a meeting at Jeffersonville
[1:23:36] and the seat was real tight and she went
[1:23:38] in and sat down, got up and went to the
[1:23:40] restroom or something, I don't know, and
[1:23:41] come back and there was a lady sitting
[1:23:42] right next to her and she sat down next
[1:23:44] to that lady and she was pretty miffed
[1:23:47] over her seat. Y'all don't never get
[1:23:49] like that, do you? She was miffed at the
[1:23:52] woman because her seat and they it
[1:23:55] didn't all work out. You can get the
[1:23:56] rest of the story later, but it didn't
[1:23:58] just she was a little bothered and and
[1:24:00] brother Billy Paul or whoever was
[1:24:01] opening the service said, "We'd like to
[1:24:03] welcome Hattie Wright tonight." And
[1:24:05] she's sitting right next to Hattie
[1:24:06] Wright. The woman was so plain she
[1:24:09] didn't stick out in the crowd. She was
[1:24:11] so poor, Brother Bam said she made $200
[1:24:14] a year. She was so poor, Brother Bam
[1:24:17] said she had gave $40 to the building
[1:24:19] fund. And he SAID, "BROTHER NEVILLE SAW
[1:24:21] IT and got $20 of it and gave it back to
[1:24:24] her cuz he knew she didn't have any
[1:24:25] groceries." And Brother BAM SAID,
[1:24:27] "MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I WALKED in the
[1:24:29] room that day, I had the other $20 in my
[1:24:32] pocket AND WAS PLANNING TO GIVE IT BACK
[1:24:34] TO HER, and the Lord said, "I got
[1:24:36] something better FOR HER. I GOT
[1:24:38] SOMETHING BETTER FOR HER." LET ME TELL
[1:24:39] YOU THIS. GOD'S GOT SOMETHING BETTER FOR
[1:24:41] YOU. YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO THIS MESSAGE.
[1:24:44] HE'S GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. I CAN'T GIVE
[1:24:46] IT BACK TO YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T
[1:24:48] GIVE IT BACK TO YOU. BUT THE GOD THAT
[1:24:50] SENT THIS MESSAGE.
[1:24:54] [applause and cheering] That's right.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Some people think I'm crazy, but you go
[1:24:57] ahead and think I'm crazy. But this
[1:24:58] prophet said, "You got a right to claim
[1:25:00] your children."
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; I've heard it. I've heard it a 100
[1:25:04] times, Brother David. People say, "Well,
[1:25:06] can we create squirrels?" Well, Brother
[1:25:08] Brown didn't tell that so we'd all go
[1:25:09] out and be squirrel hunters. I am a
[1:25:11] squirrel hunter, but he didn't say that
[1:25:12] so we'd all be squirrel hunters. He
[1:25:14] would tell you that so you would KNOW
[1:25:16] THAT THE SAME CREATOR THAT CREATED the
[1:25:18] first squirrel can create ANOTHER
[1:25:20] SQUIRREL TO TELL YOU IT'S NOT WILLIAM
[1:25:22] BRANDON TALKING TO YOU. IT'S A CREATOR
[1:25:25] TALKING TO YOU. AND THIS MORNING WE ARE
[1:25:27] NOT SQUIRREL HUNTING. WE ARE NOT HERE IN
[1:25:30] THE WOODS HUNTING. WE ARE IN WE'RE IN
[1:25:32] THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD WHERE WE
[1:25:34] NEED AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE SPIRIT OF
[1:25:36] GOD CAN MOVE AROUND US. I THINK IT'S
[1:25:39] TIME TO ACTIVATE THAT SPOKEN WORD BY
[1:25:42] SAYING AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD AND PUSH
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; ACTIVATE THAT FAITH.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; So, brother Wayne, can we speak
[1:25:56] squirrels? This is my contention. Kai,
[1:25:58] we got a right to
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; and we have the potential to.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean you will because
[1:26:05] that's a divine act of the will of God.
[1:26:07] Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you you got two of them
[1:26:11] laying side by side. Then brother Random
[1:26:13] tells the story of how how he was
[1:26:16] hunting out in Colorado and and look it
[1:26:18] happened on a mountain IN COLORADO WITH
[1:26:20] A WHY DID HE FEEL THE NEED TO TELL US
[1:26:22] ABOUT his hunting trip? WHY DID WHY DID
[1:26:25] BROTHER RAM COME BACK AND TALK TO US
[1:26:27] ABOUT HUNTING? I'm out there hunting. He
[1:26:30] said, "I'm out there hunting with these
[1:26:31] guys and THERE'S A BLIZZARD COMING."
[1:26:32] HE'S TELLING US ALL THIS STUFF AND HE
[1:26:34] SAYS, "I go up on the mountain in a
[1:26:36] blizzard. They've been predicting to
[1:26:37] come for days." He said, "All of a
[1:26:39] sudden, the blizzard was on me." And he
[1:26:42] says, "I like any smart man would do."
[1:26:44] He comes off the mountain. If you never
[1:26:45] been in the mountains, you don't
[1:26:46] understand what a storm is high. But
[1:26:49] you're not down here in the storm.
[1:26:50] You're up there in the storm. So that
[1:26:53] cloud that's 10,000 foot high. You're in
[1:26:55] the middle of the 10,000 foot.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; So it's a different kind of storm up
[1:26:59] there. you can you it gets so blind in
[1:27:00] snow that you can't see your head from
[1:27:02] your toe.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown was up there and he
[1:27:05] said, "I seen it was coming so I headed
[1:27:07] down to the camp so I wouldn't get
[1:27:08] caught out in it." And he said, "I
[1:27:10] hadn't gotten very far and a voice spoke
[1:27:11] to me and said, turn around and go back
[1:27:14] up."
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; He said, I said, "Lord, back into that
[1:27:18] storm if you want to hear it from his
[1:27:21] own voice. He that is in you." This the
[1:27:23] tape, he that is in you. And he said, "I
[1:27:25] went back, turned around, and he said,
[1:27:27] I'm looking at that storm." And he said,
[1:27:29] "The Lord said to him, my voice,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; it still calms the storms."
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I turned around and went
[1:27:36] back up there on that mountain and stood
[1:27:39] there." Y'all remember the story
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; and stood there and said, "Son, you
[1:27:43] shine for three days and storm, you go
[1:27:46] back where you come from." Isn't that
[1:27:47] something? a prophet standing there
[1:27:51] in the in in in the in in the in the
[1:27:52] late 50s, early 60s, you know,
[1:27:57] 2,000 years past the great creator Jesus
[1:28:00] standing on the bow of the boat and
[1:28:02] there's a mortal man, born of sin, full
[1:28:05] of mistakes, standing there telling the
[1:28:08] storm to go back where it came from.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; And the storm turned around and went
[1:28:15] back where it came from. and the sun be
[1:28:18] to shine.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; How did that happen? Under this word.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Look what happens. Brother said, "When
[1:28:26] the sun started shining, I looked up
[1:28:28] there and seen some deer." AND HE SAID,
[1:28:29] "I'D MADE A PROMISE TO THE Lord I
[1:28:31] wouldn't shoot deer for anybody else
[1:28:33] anymore."
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I used to fill their tags and
[1:28:35] bring them off the mountain." He said,
[1:28:36] "But I promised I wouldn't." And he
[1:28:38] said, "There stood them deer." And he
[1:28:40] said, "I looked over at them and he
[1:28:41] said,"Little deer, I give you your life.
[1:28:44] Go on." And the Lord said, "I you
[1:28:46] remembered your promise." Y'all remember
[1:28:47] that?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. What? It's so powerful, folks.
[1:28:51] Amen. Cuz there he stood. He's in
[1:28:53] Colorado. Nobody's ever logged it, Matt.
[1:28:55] So, Brother Ram said, "There I stand in
[1:28:57] virgin timber.
[1:29:00] There he is controlling the atmosphere.
[1:29:03] There he is speaking to animals. And
[1:29:06] there he's walking in trees that's never
[1:29:08] been cut." He was all the way back in
[1:29:12] Eden again. Yeah.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Look at the camp he was in.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; He was in the camp OF EDEN RIGHT THERE
[1:29:20] ON A MORTAL MAN STANDING IN TIME.
[1:29:22] BROTHER BAM SAID, "ALL OF A SUDDEN, I
[1:29:23] STARTED CRYING." HE SAID, "AND I heard
[1:29:25] them tears hit the leaves and they were
[1:29:27] dry leaves." And he thought, "Oh my
[1:29:29] God." He said, "There it is. The wind
[1:29:31] had already dried it up." Amen. Because
[1:29:34] a mortal man had spoke to a storm. It
[1:29:37] left and sent a wind to dry away the
[1:29:39] residue. Y'all heard me preach ON CAN I
[1:29:41] CAN I PREACH THIS MORNING?
[1:29:43] AMEN. THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM. SEE,
[1:29:45] BROTHER JOEL, THINGS HAPPEN and then
[1:29:47] things are left over after they happen.
[1:29:48] Cuz the storm CAN QUIT. BUT A LOT OF
[1:29:50] TIMES THE STORM AIN'T THE COMPLETE
[1:29:52] PROBLEM. IT'S THE DAMAGE IT DOES WHEN
[1:29:54] YOU'RE IN THE STORM CUZ YOU CAN BE OVER
[1:29:56] THE STORM IN MONTHS OR WEEKS AND you're
[1:29:58] still DEALING WITH THE STORM DAMAGE.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY ever heard brother Bam talk
[1:30:02] about the brown bear, the grizzly? He
[1:30:03] was the brown bear he was going to kill.
[1:30:05] And brother Bisco, there's brother Bisco
[1:30:06] again. Amen. And brother Biscoll says
[1:30:08] that he said, "I was on that trip." He
[1:30:10] sat and personally told me what
[1:30:12] happened. He said, "Brother Brandon
[1:30:14] didn't get the bear. The bear was
[1:30:15] there." Brother Brandham didn't get the
[1:30:17] bear. He said because he went with the
[1:30:19] guide instead of going with us young
[1:30:21] guys the way the vision told him to go.
[1:30:23] And he said we sat and rained for days
[1:30:25] and couldn't even hunt after that.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; HE SAID WHEN WE FINALLY GOT READY TO GO,
[1:30:31] HE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, BROTHER
[1:30:32] EDDIE, where's that bear? Where was it
[1:30:34] at?" He said, "I took him down there and
[1:30:36] showed him where the bear was." And he
[1:30:37] said he stood there and said, "You're
[1:30:39] going back to the horses." And brother
[1:30:40] Bam stood there with his hat off. And a
[1:30:42] little bit he come back up and said,
[1:30:44] "Eddie, it's going to be okay. We'll
[1:30:45] ride out of here dry." Now, it's been
[1:30:48] raining for about 3 or four or 5 days.
[1:30:49] Eddie said it rained the whole time. And
[1:30:52] he said, "When we got riding out of
[1:30:53] there, you could pass one of them
[1:30:55] saplings and hit it and they didn't have
[1:30:58] any water on them." He said, "We rolled
[1:31:01] out of there dry."
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; YOU Y'ALL EVER WALK through the woods
[1:31:05] after a good rain? You don't stay dry.
[1:31:07] You might not get rained on, but you
[1:31:09] going to be wet. That's when you find
[1:31:11] out if your boots are actually actually
[1:31:13] waterproof or not. It ain't when it's
[1:31:14] raining. It's when you're walking
[1:31:15] through that wet grass on the way back
[1:31:17] to the truck after it rained on you.
[1:31:19] Amen. AND YOU SEE, BROTHER EDDIE SAID,
[1:31:21] "WE rode right through there and the
[1:31:23] limbs were DRY AND THE LEAVES WERE DRY
[1:31:26] BECAUSE GOD DIDN'T ONLY STOP THE STORM."
[1:31:29] AMEN. HE ALSO DRIED UP THE LEAVES. DO
[1:31:32] YOU SEE FRIENDS? STORMS COME INTO LIVES
[1:31:34] AND PEOPLE'S SITUATIONS HAPPEN. BUT LONG
[1:31:37] [screaming] AFTER THE RAIN STOPPED AND
[1:31:39] LONG AFTER THE STORM, THERE'S STILL
[1:31:41] THERE'S STILL RESIDUE OF THINGS THAT ARE
[1:31:43] LEFT OVER ON YOUR LIFE. BUT THIS MESSAGE
[1:31:46] DON'T ONLY DEAL WITH THE STORMS. THEY
[1:31:48] DEAL WITH WHAT'S LEFT OVER AFTER THE
[1:31:50] STORMS. AND THIS MORNING, I SAY THAT LET
[1:31:53] THE WIND OF THE HOLY GHOST BLOW OVER THE
[1:31:56] CHURCH AND BLOW AWAY ALL THE ILL
[1:31:58] FEELINGS. AMEN. THE LITTLE FAMILY FEUDS
[1:32:00] and situation. I could preach RIGHT NOW.
[1:32:02] AMEN. LITTLE SITUATION JUST ROSE UP AND
[1:32:05] YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE FOUGHT A
[1:32:06] LITTLE BIT AND YOU SAID, "I'M SORRY."
[1:32:08] BUT DOWN IN YOUR HEART, THERE'S STILL
[1:32:10] THAT LITTLE TINGE. AMEN. WELL, YOU CAN'T
[1:32:12] REALLY GET RID OF IT, BUT THERE'S A WIND
[1:32:15] THAT CAN COME IN THIS CHURCH THIS
[1:32:16] MORNING. NOT ONLY CAN IT SETTLE THE
[1:32:19] PROBLEM, IT CAN TAKE AWAY THE GUILT AND
[1:32:21] THE FEELINGS AFTER THE PROBLEM IS OVER.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:32:30] about. Yeah.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I feel the Holy Ghost moving on
[1:32:37] something right now.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; You can sit down and talk it over, but
[1:32:41] you can't get rid of the feelings after,
[1:32:42] can you? That's why people are scared to
[1:32:44] death to have a talk.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; That's why people don't want to sit down
[1:32:47] and talk. It's because you all have had
[1:32:49] experiences of sitting down and talking
[1:32:51] and then two weeks later they still got
[1:32:53] that same little coldness towards you.
[1:32:55] Amen. Let me tell you this. Christianity
[1:32:57] is different than that. We ought to be
[1:32:59] able to sit down and bitterly disagree
[1:33:01] and put our arms around one another. It
[1:33:03] would take care of a lot of the anxiety
[1:33:05] that's in people's lives if they would
[1:33:07] get a revelation that there is true
[1:33:09] forgiveness. BUT YOU GOT to be able to
[1:33:11] forgive before you can receive
[1:33:13] forgiveness. Come on, church. I'M
[1:33:15] PREACHING TO YOU. I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:33:17] SITUATIONS THAT RISE UP IN FAMILIES AND
[1:33:19] HOMES AND LIVES AND FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
[1:33:21] LATER, IT'S STILL A PROBLEM. IT OUGHT
[1:33:24] NOT BE SO AMONG THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:33:26] GOD. THIS IS THE MINISTRY OF JESUS
[1:33:29] CHRIST.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not a witch doctor.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. This it's not it's not it's not
[1:33:38] witchcraft. It's the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And it wouldn't bring something up
[1:33:43] unless it's good for you.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even Can you imagine?
[1:33:49] Brother Brham experienced this fishing,
[1:33:51] folks.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Here's for you fishermen.
[1:33:56] Brother Bram said he's sitting out in
[1:33:57] the boat with lie on Kyle Wood. Y'all
[1:33:58] remember the story?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; He's He's brim fishing. Anybody that
[1:34:01] brim fishes know you got to be quick cuz
[1:34:04] if you ain't quick, Nathan, they'll
[1:34:06] swallow the whole hook and then you got
[1:34:08] to pull the guts out. And when you put
[1:34:10] them in the live, well, they'll just in
[1:34:12] there and bait and they'll be dead. And
[1:34:14] if you're there all day, it was no sense
[1:34:15] even keeping them. And brother Bam said,
[1:34:17] "We were catching bait." So they wanted
[1:34:19] them alive, right? So you catch it
[1:34:21] because you're going to put it later,
[1:34:22] use it for bait and put it on the hook
[1:34:23] and throw it out and catch a big catfish
[1:34:24] or a bass or something. And he said he
[1:34:27] Kyle had had had hooked one and pulled
[1:34:29] the guts out of it and he just threw it
[1:34:32] back in the water and said, "You you
[1:34:33] little fishy, you shot your last wad."
[1:34:35] And just threw him right out like that.
[1:34:37] And brother Bram said, "Then they got to
[1:34:39] talking and he said, I told him said
[1:34:41] something great's going to happen here
[1:34:42] in a minute."
[1:34:44] And he said, "We sat there for a while
[1:34:46] and we got to talking and he said," Kyle
[1:34:49] got to talking to his uh brother Banks
[1:34:52] and they said, "Banks, we ought to go
[1:34:54] down to that lady that used to be so
[1:34:56] good to us and tell her what the Lord
[1:34:57] Jesus has done for us."
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And it so pleased the Lord.
[1:35:02] Brother Bram said he felt the spirit of
[1:35:04] the Lord. I I love the I love how tender
[1:35:08] brother Bram was.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz if sometimes I have to be
[1:35:12] honest, if the wind blows, Nathan, it
[1:35:14] just the wind blew. [laughter] It's a
[1:35:16] little windy today.
[1:35:20] But brother Bram pulls his hat off and
[1:35:22] says, "Okay, he's here."
[1:35:25] And all of a sudden stands up in the
[1:35:26] boat and he says that fish, now y'all
[1:35:29] know fishing, had had laid on its side
[1:35:33] and floated over against the liies. He
[1:35:34] said, "Been laying over a half hour."
[1:35:36] All that stuff's powerful preaching, by
[1:35:37] the way. There's about a half hour of
[1:35:39] silence in the lily, you know, and but
[1:35:41] he was laying there and brother Bam
[1:35:43] said, "I turned and looked at him and
[1:35:45] said,"Little fishy, I give you your life
[1:35:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus." And that
[1:35:48] fish turned up
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; and swam off.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Bam said, "Now," he said, "I got all
[1:35:56] kinds of kids dying. [clears throat]
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; I've got needs,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; great needs all over the world." Yeah.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "There he is using that on
[1:36:06] a animal."
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why would he do it?" He said,
[1:36:11] "To tell you he cares about even the
[1:36:14] smallest thing."
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU SAID, "WELL, HE DON'T CARE IF I
[1:36:20] GET NEW SHOES." He does.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; HE DOES. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE PRAY AND AND
[1:36:25] AND and they be without the money they
[1:36:28] need and they got a little kid at home
[1:36:29] and they'd like a little certain kind of
[1:36:31] outfit or something like that and they
[1:36:32] go over to the store and sure enough
[1:36:33] that baby's on sale and $100 or
[1:36:35] something they picking it up for three
[1:36:36] or four bucks,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; And and and people that know they ain't
[1:36:40] got no money see their kid running
[1:36:41] around an hour suit and they go,
[1:36:42] "Where'd you get that?" Said, "Well, the
[1:36:44] Lord's just good."
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; That's like a pastor driving the
[1:36:47] Cadillac.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord's just good. [laughter]
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells these stories and then
[1:37:03] he he flips over and then he tells the
[1:37:05] story of of his own wife and how that
[1:37:07] she had had picked up a tumor. How many
[1:37:10] knows how that happened? The the tumor.
[1:37:12] You ever read I I I don't I need hands.
[1:37:14] So I know if I'm telling this for the
[1:37:16] first time or Amen. So, so Brother
[1:37:18] Brandham in discernment, he he takes a
[1:37:20] hand and then he would tell them what
[1:37:22] they what was wrong with the person. He
[1:37:24] said, "And I took my wife's hand because
[1:37:25] I knew there wasn't nothing wrong with
[1:37:26] her." And he said, "When I took her
[1:37:28] hand, I said, "There's an there's an
[1:37:29] ovary on a tumor on your left ovary."
[1:37:32] And he said, "We had the doctor check
[1:37:34] and there wasn't." 15 years later, he
[1:37:36] said, "I come home from a campaign." And
[1:37:39] he said, "Joseph was acting up." And he
[1:37:42] said, "Uh, she asked me to whip Joseph."
[1:37:45] And he said, "I told her I just ain't
[1:37:47] got the nerve to do it." So his nerves
[1:37:48] are all tore up and he didn't have the
[1:37:51] nerve to whip his son right then and
[1:37:52] said she got mad at him and slammed the
[1:37:55] door in his face and said, "Well, if you
[1:37:57] had to live with him, if you had to put
[1:37:59] up with him and he said, I thought, poor
[1:38:01] little thing, she's so nervous and tore
[1:38:03] up, you know." And he said, "I went on
[1:38:05] outside to wash my car." Now that's a
[1:38:07] smart man.
[1:38:10] That's prophetic insight right there.
[1:38:14] He didn't chase her. He went out and
[1:38:16] washed his car. Listen. He went out and
[1:38:19] washed his car. And while he's washing
[1:38:20] his car, he said the voice of the Lord
[1:38:22] spoke to him. He said, "Go read certain
[1:38:23] certain scripture." Book Chronicles.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And he said the scripture was when
[1:38:27] Miriam and Aaron had made fun of Moses.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You go tell her to read
[1:38:33] the scripture."
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; So he went in there and said, "Honey,
[1:38:38] you've offended the Lord."
[1:38:41] Now, now, now guys, this is real tender
[1:38:44] area right here.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; But do you know, brother Bram said,
[1:38:47] "Sister, you serve the Lord as you serve
[1:38:49] your husband.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You've offended the Lord how you've
[1:38:58] acted toward your husband." And when she
[1:39:01] and when she acted like that, Brother
[1:39:02] Bram said, he turned around and told the
[1:39:03] Lord, said, "Lord, I'm sorry."
[1:39:06] She didn't mean it. And brother Bam said
[1:39:09] a few days later the tumor started
[1:39:11] growing. He said then it got to a walnut
[1:39:14] then it got to an orange. He said then
[1:39:16] it started sticking out on her side.
[1:39:19] And he said I tell you what he said I
[1:39:20] was home and he said we've we were
[1:39:22] planning. Now listen this is a prophet
[1:39:24] in case you're wondering how to handle
[1:39:25] things. This is a prophet. He said the
[1:39:28] tumor got to getting bad and we took her
[1:39:30] to the doctor.
[1:39:35] And he said, and I said that it wasn't
[1:39:37] she wasn't getting healed. So God was
[1:39:39] testing our faith. And he said, "I told
[1:39:41] the doctor, if it needs to come out, go
[1:39:44] ahead and do the surgery."
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Are y'all are y'all hearing?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; That's the way Brother Brandham handled
[1:39:52] it.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, he said she was
[1:39:55] going to have to go and then I went home
[1:39:57] alone and she was going down to the
[1:39:58] doctor. And he said, "And I went home
[1:40:00] and I was in the in my living room." And
[1:40:03] he said, "I began to pray." And he said,
[1:40:05] "I had been home alone before."
[1:40:08] And he said, "I began to pray." And
[1:40:10] said, "Lord, I've come home to an empty
[1:40:12] house before." And he starts talking to
[1:40:14] the Lord about it. And he starts
[1:40:16] apologizing for his wife. Now look, look
[1:40:18] at the love. Lord, don't be upset at
[1:40:20] her. She She And he starts explaining,
[1:40:24] "Lord, she's a good wife to me. She's a
[1:40:26] good mother. She never complains when I
[1:40:29] hunt. She's never He starts He starts He
[1:40:32] starts taking up for his wife to his
[1:40:34] Lord.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And he starts when he starts that all of
[1:40:39] a sudden you now the reason I'm telling
[1:40:42] you that cuz you can watch the third
[1:40:43] pull almost every case of it was
[1:40:45] activated by divine love. And he goes he
[1:40:48] goes when that happened he said a voice
[1:40:51] said to me stand to your feet
[1:40:54] and say how it'll be. And he said, "I
[1:40:56] stood up in the middle of that living
[1:40:58] room and he said, when I stood up, I
[1:41:00] said, before the doctor ever touches
[1:41:03] her, it'll be gone."
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "The next day, I
[1:41:08] get a call from her and said, "Honey, I
[1:41:10] was laying on the table and the doctor
[1:41:13] came in to do the surgery and he
[1:41:15] couldn't find the tumor. It just
[1:41:18] disappeared."
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "See there five the
[1:41:21] number of grace."
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Five different times that that was
[1:41:26] manifested
[1:41:28] that you could see that it was more than
[1:41:30] a man doing that
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; that it was the spirit of God.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel like I've got long on you.
[1:41:36] I'm sorry.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; It It's It's more than the It's more
[1:41:40] than just a man. It's more than William
[1:41:42] Brham.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; It's the fulfillment of scriptures.
[1:41:46] Right.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And as those scriptures are begin to
[1:41:48] wave over the people, watch how that
[1:41:50] dealt with it dealt with it dealt with
[1:41:52] family.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; It didn't just Do you see that? It
[1:41:56] didn't just leave Hatty Wright a super
[1:41:58] spiritual person, but it gave her
[1:42:00] something for her children.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Look at Brother Bram's own marriage. The
[1:42:04] third pull was right in his home.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Do you see this? This third pull ain't
[1:42:10] something that's just abstract and it's
[1:42:12] out there somewhere. It's right in human
[1:42:14] life. It's right here. And and this
[1:42:17] message WILL WORK IN YOUR FAMILY. IT'LL
[1:42:20] WORK IN YOUR HOME. It'll teach you how
[1:42:22] to raise children. It'll teach you HOW
[1:42:23] TO TREAT A WIFE. It'll teach a woman how
[1:42:25] to TREAT HER HUSBAND. THIS MESSAGE HAS
[1:42:28] THE ARTIFACTS. IT HAS everything that
[1:42:30] you need. Amen. If you begin to lift it
[1:42:32] up for what it is,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; you see it. It's more THAN JUST THIS
[1:42:37] MAN, WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S GOD'S
[1:42:39] FULFILLMENT OF HIS WORD IN this
[1:42:41] generation. Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to receive it in that
[1:42:44] aspect, then you begin to accept it for
[1:42:46] what it is. Amen. I I say this morning
[1:42:49] as our musicians would come, Amen, as
[1:42:51] you as you see it for what it is, as you
[1:42:53] begin to accept the message for for
[1:42:56] being what it is, that's when the
[1:42:58] message starts becoming its
[1:42:59] effectiveness on you.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; You see, that's why the that's why the
[1:43:03] devil is uh that's why the devil is
[1:43:05] always that's why that he's always
[1:43:08] against it. That's why he's always
[1:43:10] working.
[1:43:13] is that he he wants to take away from
[1:43:15] the effectiveness of the word.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; But it got real serious around that,
[1:43:23] didn't it? It's the truth.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; It's a truth.
[1:43:31] See, it it it matters. Y'all know it
[1:43:34] matters how you correct your children.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Y'all know that.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; You remember Billy Paul?
[1:43:42] Brother Bram said he was going to offend
[1:43:43] that angel by whipping that child mad.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You You can offend God how you treat his
[1:43:51] servants.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; That that that's not fearful. What that
[1:43:57] is is is it's is it's an acknowledgment.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; That what you're dealing with is not
[1:44:03] just another man,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Or just another woman or just another
[1:44:08] child.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the bride of Christ.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; The place of his manifestation in this
[1:44:14] last day.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; If you look for him,
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; you can see him.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; If you're looking for Won't you stand to
[1:44:20] your feet with me this morning? If you
[1:44:22] look for him,
[1:44:25] you can see him.
[1:44:28] He shall appear the second time.
[1:44:33] I love I love how brother Brandham
[1:44:36] I love how he goes to God for his wife.
[1:44:41] I just love how he does it.
[1:44:45] God's taken up for him. He's explaining
[1:44:46] to God why she's a good woman.
[1:44:51] Lord, forgive her.
[1:44:54] She didn't mean she didn't mean that.
[1:44:56] Lord, I know her. She loves me and I
[1:44:59] love her and
[1:45:02] but God used a prophet
[1:45:06] to show to show that side of life and
[1:45:09] then when and when it got to that place
[1:45:11] look at the word come and just remove
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; just he totally removed that tumor out
[1:45:17] of our life.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; You know he can do the same thing today.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; He can cause the storm to disappear.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:26] Andy can take away the effects.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; He certainly can. I believe he can I
[1:45:34] believe he can move in such a way this
[1:45:36] morning
[1:45:38] that he can cause he can cause hearts
[1:45:41] to to notify and to realize that he's in
[1:45:44] their presence and then know what
[1:45:45] they're dealing with with with someone.
[1:45:47] you know, uh if he's taken away the
[1:45:50] problem,
[1:45:52] Satan always wants to remain uh in the
[1:45:55] situation by emotion.
[1:45:59] Um I I know I know through years of of
[1:46:02] dealing with experiences, my own
[1:46:04] experiences.
[1:46:06] Do you know you can you can you can
[1:46:08] either live past something
[1:46:12] or you can stay in it. And sometimes you
[1:46:15] you deal with people maybe they got into
[1:46:17] a problem with a church or they get into
[1:46:18] a problem in their family. 10 years
[1:46:21] later you can meet them and they're
[1:46:24] still discussing the same fight.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; They still talking about the same
[1:46:29] problems, the same things that was said
[1:46:32] about them, the same that it's just the
[1:46:35] same the same 10 years later. And if
[1:46:37] they don't do something, you meet them
[1:46:40] 10 years later and it'll be a still be
[1:46:43] the same thing.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I remember I went down into another
[1:46:47] region. I won't tell you where it's at,
[1:46:48] but I was down in another region in the
[1:46:50] States and I went over to preach for a
[1:46:52] brother and there had been some church
[1:46:54] trouble years prior and uh the brother
[1:46:57] got talking to me. One of the pastors
[1:46:59] got talking to me about the other pastor
[1:47:01] and uh man had me all tore up, you know.
[1:47:04] Now I'm I'm just a vist preacher.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I just come to preach, you know, have me
[1:47:09] have my spirit all tore up. And after a
[1:47:11] little bit, I I got the courage. I said,
[1:47:13] "Well, when did that happen?" And man,
[1:47:16] it had been like almost 30 years.
[1:47:20] [laughter] I'm like, "Whoa, you ain't
[1:47:23] over that yet."
[1:47:26] You know
[1:47:28] what'll stay with you is what you allow
[1:47:30] to stay with you.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know you can leave it behind you
[1:47:34] this morning?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. to those that look to him the
[1:47:37] second time. When you look at him this
[1:47:40] morning, you can see that he is a
[1:47:42] savior. [crying]
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; You can see it. You can see that he's
[1:47:46] your deliverer.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You can see that. You can see he's the
[1:47:50] one that set you free. I know personally
[1:47:54] what brought us up. I know what'll lift
[1:47:56] you up. It's the message of this hour.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our hearts together.
[1:48:02] Father,
[1:48:04] we're so thankful this morning for the
[1:48:06] grace that you have given.
[1:48:11] Lord, there's some some things that we
[1:48:13] have read and we have heard,
[1:48:16] Lord, that have just electrified our
[1:48:18] hearts. [music]
[1:48:20] And Lord, I'll never get over it.
[1:48:23] I'll never get over the realities that
[1:48:26] you have been so kind to open my heart
[1:48:28] and eyes to see
[1:48:31] that your scriptures have been fulfilled
[1:48:33] in my generation.

[1:48:58] prophet.
[1:49:00] The storm may be over, [music]
[1:49:03] but Lord, I pray not only that the storm
[1:49:05] be gone, but may you dry May you dry
[1:49:08] what's left over from it, Lord. May you
[1:49:11] [music] take the feelings and may you
[1:49:13] sweep them away. May you restore that
[1:49:16] fellowship. Lord, [music]
[1:49:18] I pray that there'd be such a love that
[1:49:20] would move in this assembly. Lord,

[1:49:46] ask you [music] that your spirit, Lord,
[1:49:48] would just begin to move upon those
[1:49:50] needs. Father, maybe somebody sitting
[1:49:52] here this morning claiming their
[1:49:54] children, [music] Lord. I pray, Father,
[1:49:56] that faith would raise up in them as
[1:49:58] they do it. Lord, maybe as even as we
[1:50:00] have spoken, Lord, maybe there's things
[1:50:02] that are rising up in the mind and the
[1:50:04] heart, but Lord, we know that you can
[1:50:06] take them. Lord, you can deal with them
[1:50:07] this morning. [music]
[1:50:09] We give them all to you, Father, in
[1:50:11] Jesus name. We thank you for it, [music]
