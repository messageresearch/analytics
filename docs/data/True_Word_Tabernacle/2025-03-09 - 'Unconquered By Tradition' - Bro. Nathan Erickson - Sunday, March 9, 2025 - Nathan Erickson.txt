can speak for all of us I know to say there's nowhere we'd rather be there's nowhere we'd rather hold a meeting than right here amen with this church this is such a queenly church so well-appointed

behind the wheel it's all we want to be is a help to help move the great load amen let's go to the word of God today Mark chapter 7 thank you Jesus Mark chapter 7 and verse 5 we know the story of Jesus how the the Pharisees came to resent him because he and his disciples would act in a in an untraditional or in their minds an inappropriate way and so the Pharisees and scribes asked him why not why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but they eat bread with unwash in hands he answered and said unto them well hath Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do and I I'll skip over it for the sake of time but the example Christ would use about this Corban it's quite a amazing study if you'd like to take that on your own time but just to take verse 13 He said you're making the word of God of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things do ye I I would like to preach this morning a message titled unconquered by Traditions let's just go to him in prayer and how many as you approach him you'd want to come the Lord with a desire this morning say Lord as this meeting has been a special meeting not just another meeting let this service today Lord not just be another service let it not be a tradition of gathering together let let it not be a ritual Lord may we press past the veil of tradition today see you face to face Lord may you come amongst us Lord that's our desire today we thank you for what you have done we thank you for the gifts Lord that you've given this assembly and Lord how they have blessed us Lord and how you have come Lord in your humility to walk the aisles of this little church touch our hearts Lord and let us feel your presence Lord we we were So Unworthy but Lord you paid a price Lord you hung on that cross so that the veil that hid us from you could be rent from the top to the bottom and we could boldly enter into your presence Lord and that's where we want to be today Father we don't want to be caught in the outer Court Lord or even the inner but Lord we want to press into the holy of holies where the shikina glory is Lord and ask that you would hover over us as we Fellowship around your word Lord and and let us Lord let us come up Lord and be caught up into the atmosphere of the heavenlies Lord Lord uh speak to us I pray once more in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you as you're seated today brother Brandon preached the message the unveiling of God and and it's just amazing uh as I've been sitting here this weekend to see the continuity of the inspiration amen that God's given brother Isaac and brother Ronnie and myself and and just just incredible you know how how uh uh it's all dovetailed together brother brandom in the unveiling of God is speaking about you know the veil of the temple that that kept people out of that shakina glory amen and how Christ died so that that Veil could be open so that the believer amen could enter freely into that place and fellowship in the presence of God Amen but he said over the last 2,000 years uh Satan has been at work and uh what has happened is that that place has been veiled up again by veils of tradition and man-made Creeds and traditions of men men and dogmas and and denominational Spirits have have all together covered up that place and and and once again remove the believer from the personal presence of Jesus Christ but brother Brandon said and oh my amen if you're if you're a message believer today by a real experience this is this is your reality brother Bram says that now we have crossed that Riven Veil we are on the other side now on the other side and he said you'll see if you'll break those old traditions and things and come to him you will see him you will see him standing the mighty conqueror he's the Word of Promise for this age made manifest you'll see the Mighty God unveiled see him right Among Us here unveiled the Mighty God unconquered by Traditions he's unconquered by Traditions how many have seen him amen how many have seen him uh in this message how about in this church in your life you've seen amen you you caught a vision of the Mighty God unveiled unconquered by Traditions what a powerful thing to think but you know uh you know as as human beings we're just we're given to a tendency of of being traditional and habitual creatures and so Jesus would rebuke the religious systems of his day and say that you are you are you are holding on to the traditions of the elders and and you're putting it in the place of God's word amen and that's something we you know friends we we have to recognize that all of us as human beings have a certain tendency amen toward word tradition and we we we love habit we love ritual and and and and and we sort of have that in our nature and so amen but we got to remember that a lot of things that go into having a church and a lot of thing that go into our our our sort of Christian daytoday and our our Sunday go meeting kind of a habits are are are just tradition amen and amen and many of them it wasn't your tradition or my tradition but it was something that was handed down from before and we do things after a certain pattern because that's the way it's always been done amen amen but we got to watch those things because amen because some of those things uh have a real truth to them and some of them are just tradition and as long as was around the scripture we teach the principle Jesus said it's the traditions of the elders and so we got to find out that as parents Amen to children or to as an older generation raising up a younger generation not everything that we hand down to them is going to be real the real truth of God some of it's just our Traditions some of it's just our sensibilities some of it's just the you know just just maybe personal opinions and things and that's why we want to we want to in we want to uh instruct our young people if you want to really get somewhere with God Amen one thing you got to watch out for is what I'll call conventional wisdom just traditional wisdom you know you know what I mean it's just uh you know to get to get the kind of you know to learn how to just go with the flow and follow the crowd and just do what other things are doing amen but if you ever want to see Christ in your life get you a real good appetite for truth amen amen cuz conventional wisdom amen it'll get you a good job it'll get you through this world it'll amen it'll help you on your journey through this life amen and through this world but the truth will get you out of this world Amen and there's and that's what we're after today amen it's not just to come together in a traditional Gathering amen but we want the truth of God we want the reality and we want the life amen that's that's what we desire tradition will make the word of God of none effect now see in other words amen it doesn't necessarily mean you don't have the word amen but what tradition does is it takes the effect out of the word you could be preaching the genuine gospel amen there's many people preaching the message of the hour but because of their traditions because of their mindsets because of their Hang-Ups amen and baggage of the past it's taken the effect of that word out of the church amen what a terrible thing brother Brandon would point it out how Jesus would tell them in vain you worship me amen can you imagine what a terrible place to be that they were truly worshiping amen the God Amen of Abraham but but without effect they were wor their worship was in vain because of traditions that would bind them amen that would kill the effect now that's Satan's tool against the church that's Satan that's how Satan conquers the church amen he conquers them by tradition we've all amen I trust we've all studied the church age book and brother brother Brandon will lay it out uh line after line and tell the story amen of how when Christ died and God sent the Holy Ghost down on the day of of Pentecost amen each age got further and further and further away from the pattern amen that God had put into place because they piled up more and more and more and more traditions and it became they got to where they had such a baggage train of of Pomp and Circumstance that the Holy Ghost couldn't move the church anymore God didn't have the preeminence anymore friends that's how Satan conquers the church now he would talk about the nicians right he said now the way that that started out is it was called Deeds amen but then it became a Doctrine right Amen in that to that first church age it was the Deeds of the nicians but then time went on and the Deeds became doctrines it started out as just well that's just how we do it in our church this is just our way of approaching it amen but a little while longer said this is our Doctrine this is the way amen this is the truth this is this is what you got to bow to Amen to be a real believer is get under our Doctrine brother B said it was Deeds then it became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way now friends we all got our way of doing things amen we all got our Traditions If we're honest about it amen we have a certain order of having Church in this assembly and it's not the order amen that they have in another assembly we have certain traditions we have certain ways of mannerisms you know I'm wearing a suit today amen because that's the tradition amen is to dress in a suit I didn't I didn't come here in a Rob and sandals just to prove that I'm not a slave to tradition I dress like a man in 2025 dresses amen and I and we do all that so we have we have traditions we have ways of doing things but brother Bram says what when it's when it becomes an unbending way an unbending way amen that's the problem we've seen it Time After Time After Time even in the ranks of this message amen it started out as somebody's idea it was somebody it was just the Deeds it was amen it was some preacher style or some Church's uh methods amen but then it became the way and it became unbending and it became a cage for God's people Amen to wrap around them and say you got to come this way or God can't help you you got to come to this church you got to sit under this ministry you got to dress this dress you got to talk this talk amen but there's got to be a church somewhere amen that's unconquered by Traditions amen you travel around amen these ministers travel around and preach and they know what I'm talking about everywhere you go they got their way they got their idea and we've been through all this kind of legalism in the message you know amen you go certain place they say well preacher shouldn't wear beards a preacher shouldn't have a beard amen they don't say that much anymore but that was a big thing that was a big thing you go somewhere else say well a preacher should never wear a blue suit amen a preacher should only wear black and white maybe a red tie amen and that's the tradition amen so what do you do as a minister if you got a burden for the people you'll jump through the Hoops you'll shave the beard you'll change the shirt you'll do what you got to do Amen to get to the people and try to get them the message amen but here's the burden of My Heart Church there's got to be a church somewhere shouldn't there ought to be a church somewhere that's unconquered by Traditions that's not bound amen by the ideas of man shouldn't there be a church that believes the message and the whole message and nothing but the message I believe there should and I I intend to be that friends hallelujah oh yeah the unbending way it finally took over and God was pushed aside it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then it caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church amen some of you were sitting in a church when the Winds of peria begin to blow amen some of you Old-Timers you were sitting in a church amen when the false Thunders began to sound amen and it looked good be honest it looked good some of it sounded good it seemed so sound amen But as time has gone watch how it manifested itself amen it bound the church it killed the life it salted the Earth and amen and the Next Generation has no Revival amen but there's got to be a church amen that's unconquered by tradition there's got to be a true bride true Thunders true presence true word oh it caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church oh that false Vine is subtle it's like an angel of Light till it gets a hold on you brother BR said now I want to say I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word that's the kind of leadership we want friends you know we're not an organization amen and you know you you could take and me and brother Ronnie and brother Isaac could sit down and swap notes amen and try to do our best to put three sermons together amen would go in continuity but you can't do it better than the Holy Ghost does it amen his way is perfect his way is Anointed amen we want the Holy Ghost leading the church we want the Holy Ghost leading the pastor leading the preacher leading the mother and the father amen Holy Ghost leadership I know in message circles we like to talk a lot about our non-denominational status oh we're not a denomination oh thank God we're not like them Pentecostals thank God we're not like them basist we non-denominational you know I used to go around and tell people cuz you go around and you tell people they ask you well what you know what brand of Christian are you and I that's what I always used to say non-denominational but you know it's cool to be non-denominational now it's cool now amen and now when you you tell somebody you're non- denominational the image they got in their mind amen is somebody with ripped jeans and long hair sitting in a converted movie theater it's cool to be non- denominational friends but we're an independent church we're a Bible believing Church we're a Holy Ghost Church amen amen cuz they can call themselves non- denominational but they're just as dead they're just as bound amen but there's got to be a church somewhere that's free amen oh we're non- denominational friends but you know what there's a pale horse rider today and he is alive and well and that Antichrist spirit is riding against God's church and I know I've preached it before I'll preach it again that the pale horse rider is not fighting today against the Catholic church he killed him a long time ago it was a long time ago that the that the pale horse rider got his hands on the Lutheran church amen and brought that Frosty Touch of death to that organization amen the target amen the enemy the focus of the Antichrist spirit is God's true church today he's riding against you I come to warn you brother amen that false religion spiritual death is riding against you he's riding against the the Bride of Jesus Christ oh sure he is he's killed off Seven Ages of Revival amen but now we come to the final showdown remember brother bam said Jesus had a showdown it was a showdown amen between the Creeds of his day and the Real Living Word but he said there's coming a final showdown and it'll be a battle fought on Mount Zion yeah a Mount Zion Showdown and that's where the battle is friends that's the test will this bride bow her head to denomination Spirits amen will she bow her head to Traditions or will amen will she prove that she's not like Eve will she stay with the word for her day will she keep it pure will she keep it unadulterated I I I'm determined with everything that's in me to fight the good fight today amen and contend for the message of the hour keep the Traditions out of it keep your idea out of it amen we won't conquered by tradition brother Bram in the church age book remember he said you'll be an invincible Army how will you do it he said it's if you get a true revelation of the two Spirits two spirits in the framework of the Christian church now one of them's not in the church but it's in the framework two spirits in the framework of the church and by God's spirit you got to discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit but if you do that Satan will be powerless before her amen that's how you win the final showdown that's how we fight the greatest battle ever fought amen is to be amen such a bride of Christ amen that by the message we can discern amen that there is a cold Hand of Death reaching out toward your life and the devil would like nothing more amen than to snatch you off your message Pew and get his cold clammy hands around you and cause you to bet trade your Revival amen for an old dead tradition and make you think because you believe God sent a prophet and because you dress by the dress code and because you associate with a certain group of people that you've got the goods amen but the Bride of Jesus Christ won't fall for that cuz by God's spirit she can discern the Antichrist spirit and as sure as there's an antichrist Spirit the true spirit of God the true spirit of God is in the bride to win The Showdown she's not like Eve on this one's different oh yeah oh my it's a two-fold revelation that Devil's fighting to kill you this is not a game we don't we don't come to just play church this is not a game that Devil Wants You dead he wants you in a spiritual grave he don't want you to revived he doesn't want you to have power amen he's the thing he's most afraid of is that you'll get a revelation of who you truly are are and what you're supposed to be cuz if you can get a hold of that he's got no power over you you're Invincible you're untouchable impregnable that's right amen so he comes with tradition Satan doesn't care if you belong to a message Church long as he can get you dead in your message church he don't care if you got the right pictures on the wall amen as long as he can kill you amen or get you into fanaticism if he can't get you into fanaticism he'll get you over into formalism he doesn't care long as you're dead yeah we're in a battle friends he just needs to make you dead in the church that you're in amen and cause you to just become a part of the organization but this message did not come to form an organization brother BR said we're not building an organization we are building individuals Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word this message neb came to reform the Church it came to restore the individual that's why some of you are sitting around discouraged all the time amen cuz you spend all day long streaming everywhere amen and getting in on all the gossip and all the current events amen and you're worried cuz this one's fighting that one and there's problems over in that church amen the message never came to fix the church it's not a message to the organization don't be surprised if we still have organizational problems around the message just make sure you as an individual have been restored by the word for your [Applause] day stop trying to fix the church let God fix you let him fix your family let him fix your problems let him fix your attitude hallu I'll tell you what's going on around the message it's the passing of the torch amen and the Baton is being passed from one generation to another another amen and many of the first generation that walked with the prophet there's very few of them left but God but see the message can never be denominated this revival can never stop and so God is obligated to raise up another generation of young people amen and he's doing it friends amen I'm here to tell you let my Ministry be a witness God has got another generation and if all of us pass away there will be young people that'll sweep this message on to the coming of the Lord cuz you'll never deny at the message but because it's a passing of the Baton amen there's a war there's a war I don't mean I don't mean a war against the world I mean a war in our pulpits a war amongst our Ministries amen cuz it's a fight for the hearts and the minds of the young people Amen to see the message make the right generational transition amen and so everybody is trying to set the pattern amen yeah every every man every teacher every Church they got their idea the way it should be amen if we could just get the young people to take my pattern if they could just accept my formula if they could just get under my teaching amen then we'd be okay amen I say I pray that our young people amen will be able by the help of the Lord to break out of every pattern of man amen that they'll be independent of all of our ideas that they'll be protected from our good intentions no let the Lord send the Revival to this generation don't Point them to your idea Point them to the message amen hallelujah friends amen we don't have any archbishops in this message this is a sovereign church amen we're not here to put ourselves under any leader under any man or man's teaching under any idea we're not here to join a circle or a group amen we're here to be free amen liberated by the word for our day amen we're here for the bride's Revival amen the Bible says you've been bought with a don't be the Servants of men anymore but what I see too much around the message is a is a is a is itching ears amen itching after some teacher some leader some preacher some politician some philosopher some influencer some thought leader somebody tell me what to think somebody tell me what to believe somebody tell me what's true oh break out of the pattern don't be the Servants of man Christ died to set you free and every fresh and true Revival the church age book says will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age amen young people are sitting here say brother Nathan how can I get the Revival how can I be in the bride's Revival get back to the word for our day get back to the message get back to truth amen forget about the history forget about the water under the bridge forget about the false doctrines forget about the church drama forget about the hurts get back to the message Hallelujah that's what brother told about that wounded soldier amen he was laying there on the verge of death amen and his instructions were amen he said how do I get back to Jesus well where'd you leave him where'd you leave him go back to where you left him go back to where you left him listen friends if you're sitting here if there's somebody sitting in a Pew here and you've been hurt by Churches you've been wounded in the battles over doctrines amen and personalities amen you've been hurt you've been scarred you've been you're a wounded soldier I'll tell you what go back to where you left him amen there's still life for you there's still healing there's still [Applause] truth just get back to the message that's where you'll find it back to the word friends amen and that's why because of this war over this Young Generation amen that's why we get all these shots fired people get in the pulpit and they fire a mortar shell somewhere to the other side of the world to some other Church some other country amen amen and you know what we end up with it's a bunch of stupid arguments arguing about how whether we can dance how hard we can dance when we can dance when we can shout whether we can say Amen how loud we can say Amen stupid arguments get out from under the men I'll tell you what I tell you I'm not the pastor here but I can I can know I can speak to our direction of this church amen you want to you want to amen you want to be blessed in this church and grow under this ministry I'll tell you what you got to do do you got to leave your fight at the door when you come in don't come in here amen want somebody want the preacher to take sides with you amen and talk about what's going on on the other side of the country that's not what we're about we're here to preach the message we're here for the moving of the spirit we're here for the Revival leave your arguments at the door amen cuz sure as am you come sit in the church amen and and you say well you know I would I would oh I would humble myself to that quote brother Wayne and that leans a little too much to the person I'm fighting with and I I I I believe brother brandom said that but I I want to balance you out or you'll end up like that guy forget that guy that guy's not the pastor here that guy doesn't go here amen we want to be free free from organization free from denomination free from the oppression of man-made Creeds and ideas Amen brother B said they had the Bible for 2,000 years and all they've done is carve it up into pieces and argue about it but the Bible was not made to be talked about it was made to be lived that's the way it is with the message friends it's to be lived it's got to be a Living Word the letter kth and the Letter's got a big body count around the ranks of the message of oh yeah we got our isms give it a little time they'll be WMS that's right amen but go back to where you left him brother BR preached a message called the way back he said you won't find him in denomination he's not there you'll never find him in an educational program he's not there oh they're looking for him they're looking for him they got the they got the bestseller from the Bible bookstore they got their Psychology programs amen they got their they got their modern theology amen they got their new influencers amen they're new they're they're they're you know the new culture Amen in the in the in the youth they got all those kind of things they're looking for him but he's not there you will find him in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that is the only place you will find him that's the only place friends that's the only place we'll find Christ today amen is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost they say oh all all this fighting over our personal sensibilities half the things that you hold dear amen are not your it's not your Doctrine it's not your belief it's just your sensibility and when somebody doesn't measure up to your little your little sensibility and your little leaning you're ready to throw them out of the church amen you got to leave your opinions behind to travel with the message leave them old Idols back in Egypt heyen say that's not how we do it where I'm from oh in our church we don't we don't carry on like that no not in our church no we don't that's not how we do it where I'm from let me tell you where I'm from I'm from the beginning let me tell you how we do it where I'm from where I'm from the sons of God shout for joy where I'm from they get in one mind and one Accord and they wait on that rushing Mighty Wind to come and abew the church with power from on high that's where I'm from I'm from before the denomination before the organization before the Creed take it back to the beginning friends in the beginning it wasn't so in the beginning we didn't do it like that right in the beginning we were free but now these organizational Spirits are trying to bring us under control amen friends amen when you look around the message ranks and you see and you see and you see hierarchies beginning to form and you see men trying to enforce their ideas on other men amen until we end up we got a music Bishop we got a shout Bishop we got a dance Bishop that's why we left our denomination that's exactly why we left some of you Old-Timers how many in this church came out of a denominational Church to the message amen look around young people go ask one of these people what it was like under that denominational teaching back in that old dead church amen where somebody had to tell you what to think and somebody had to tell you what to do and somebody had to tell the pastor what to preach we left that behind us we're not going back thought it was amazing brother brother Isaac used the quote it was in my notes Amen brother BR preached on washing Jesus feet amen down there in in in Phoenix amen and he had them Pharisees he had all didn't he have that bunch of preachers nailed amen all sitting around the table talking about how many members they added to their church and how great their Ministry was and what they learned in the Seminary and how intelligent amen they were and how high in this society and all those kind of things and here's Jesus sitting in a corner with dirty feet amen think of it Jesus on the outside of his church amen we know we know what a terrible picture it is Jesus on the outside of the Lutheran Church Jesus on the outside of the Methodist Church Jesus on the outside of the Pentecostal church but there's something that Grieves my soul today to look around our ranks around this world and see Jes Jesus Christ amen the Savior amen sitting on the outside of many a message church but I say let him in brother BR said that's why I left the Baptist [Applause] Church I believe my God ought to be worshiped in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost I don't believe in your old Court former Creeds he wants to be loved look at him sitting over there and he can't be loved because of the way he's treated you self-made Seminary chickens of pastors hatch yourself out and put the dirty name of Holy Roller on the worship of Jesus no wonder your congregation don't stand taller it's the way that you've treated him if you would preach the Bible in the power of the resurrection of Christ Saints would be shouting in every church hallah it's not Jesus fault it's your fault look at the messes we got around the message it's not the word's fault it's not the messages fault it's our fault Oh Holy Roller bunch of Fanatics go on Pharisee your time's coming amen just like the children of Israel got out in the wilderness amen they were so happy to get out of Egypt oh they were so happy remember that that first day you stepped out of that dead church and came into the light of the message you were so happy to get out of that church you couldn't you just couldn't wait for the doors to slam behind you amen and you were so happy to leave but after a little while amen people got to grumbling amen you got into some trials you found out coming to the message didn't fix every problem in your life found out there'd still be struggles found out we'd still have battles found out we'd still disappoint one another sometimes in our humanity and it got to that place and all of a sudden the people started saying well you know uh it was more comfortable it was so comfortable back in Egypt it was so comfortable you know if we could just do it a little more like The ecumenical churches do if we could just get everybody together and just talk it out amen and just try to just try to get everybody settled and everybody on the same page if amen if we could just organize ourselves and amen and start getting everybody together and get everybody's name on a book and get some dialogue going and all those kind wasn't it better in Egypt amen wasn't it better back there you know we didn't have to just you know we didn't have to just get so worked up over all these little doctrinal fights we we had a we had somebody to tell us what to do and what to think and all the oh my amen and Joshua and Caleb are sitting there saying that's why we left that's why we left we were slaves in Egypt we were not free we had somebody telling us what to do telling us what to think telling us what to wear telling us how to worship telling us how to shout telling us how to dance telling us how to cry that's why we left and friends when I hear when I detect that Spirit coming around the church trying to get into our into our ministry you young men look at the peers look at your peers around this message and watch that Spirit trying to get into the Next Generation amen and start trying to just cool things down and just get things organized and just talk things out I'll tell you what it smells like garlic to me smells like somebody amen's been lusting after the flesh pots of Egypt and all their garlic and all their spice but I don't want no garlic amen smelling garlic breath devil amen telling me to give up what I got and go back to that to that pig sty of denomination that old rotten carcass I'm an eagle I need something fresh Hallelujah garlic breath preachers once you try to organize this message the day you try to organize it the day you touch it with your opinion it'll kill the Revival that's what's happened that's what's happened today brother BR preached the Third Exodus he said it's because our churches have become intellectual we got the best dressed crowds the biggest organization the smartest ministers am I preaching or what that we have no use of the Holy Spirit the way it was back there amen cuz we're full and he says and they think that they're more able with their intellectual Minds Amen to set a church in order better than what the Holy Spirit could do it so they don't need it any longer we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got doctors we don't need the Holy Spirit to speak with tongues we got intelligent people we don't need the Holy Spirit to preach the word we got books amen we don't need holy spirit amen to start churches get under my organization amen we don't need the Holy Spirit to to deliver amen we got Psychology programs amen we don't need that old Holy Spirit we know better we're smarter now we've come a long way we're a better class of people he said they adopted a man-made Spirit a man-made system to take place of the Holy Spirit he said when you do that you take right out of the framework the lifeline brother you remember there's two spirits in the framework of the church the moment you take the holy ghost out of the church you're only left with the Antichrist Spirit that's why you either be under the Seal of God or you'll be under the mark of the beast amen because if you take the Holy Spirit out of the framework the only thing left is spiritual death the only thing left is denomination but he said there's a people that's elected that got their names on the Lamb's Book of Life they can't go for that oh they can't go for that they can't stand it amen now but see but he says we got these churches and he said now watch now how subtle he said they won't come right out and say it oh yeah they won't get in the pulpit and preach against the Holy Ghost yeah oh you honor me with your lips but your heart is far from me they won't come right out and say it but he said their actions prove it and actions speak louder than words how do you judge a church friends not by its teaching but by its Fruit by the life that it can re reproduce that'll show what kind of a seed is in it is what it brings forth amen you can use the words you can preach the message and still kill the Revival and it's happening all over this world Amen but let's speak it out loud today amen speak for this church speak for yourself let's speak it right out let my actions prove amen that I will not settle I will not bow to denominational idols won't stand for organization my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and reality belongs to me yeah we got all out of that High Society kind of churches around the message and they're a better class they come longer they're richer amen they're more intelligent they're higher in the society Amen brother B said that's the Church of this day amen oh yeah they're impregnated by something because they bring forth members amen but he said look amen she doesn't want any of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable youngans hanging on to her she she don't want no children running around the church making noise amen and making a mess she don't want it cuz it would embarrass her amen yeah her teacher friend from amen from another country would call her up and chew her out for letting that go on and say I thought you were deep I thought you were spiritual I thought you were in the opening of the word how can you let these little young carry on like that amen but oh friends amen that's the only kind the word of God can bring forth and word teaching word preaching word Doctrine word truth will bring forth babies it'll bring forth young people that are baptized with the new birth it'll make a mess it'll embarrass you come on but it don't embarrass me Amen to say well they throw her out at the next Council but I'm not in the council oh yeah it would ruin her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belongs to but I don't belong to that church so that don't bother me a bit kicked me out of the organization I never joined it I never put my name on it I want the Dynamics of God that's where brother brandom put the emphasis you said you got to have a balance brother Nathan you can't get too far into that worship and screaming and shouting and dancing and carrying on brother brandom said we were off balance he said we put too much emphasis on the mechanics but we need the Dynamics of God to come down and Spark the church and make this thing move we got a lot of high polish Cadillacs sitting around the message of the hour and they never never moved a mile amen 30 years later they're still talking about their old doctrinal dispute and what happened and what so and so said and what so and so was teaching amen they've been dead 30 years let it go and get on down the road it don't matter how polished we are that's what that simonized coat was remember brother Bram said you can have a simonized coat on that Cadillac and have it all sparkling and Shining amen that's what that is that's a Polish he said you can have it all polished up amen but it's got to have a spark to move and friends I tell you I fear that around the message we get a little too polished and we're a little too worried about what we're wearing and what and and and how much money we make and where we're at in the society and what our reputation is and how we look and what they think out on the internet who cares we can stand and knock a little bit of the polish off of this thing get it out on the road and hit some bumps amen uh pick up some dings and scratches along the journey but move that's the Holy Ghost Church it's a church in action oh yeah oh yeah you don't want to pick up any scars you don't want to have any troubles don't ever move just sit there amen but there's some children that the word brings forth amen it's something something Wells up within them they got to move they got to shout they got nobody manufactured that it was in them amen when they got that fing of the Holy Ghost gasoline amen when that message begin to amen when good when good God Holy Ghost preachers amen begin to stockpile up the resources amen into their spiritual tank amen after a while they get into a meeting like last night amen and the spark amen of the Holy Ghost fire comes into the room and touches them on the amen just oh just a touch that's all they need just a touch it don't take much to have Holy Ghost meeting if you got realax 238 children amen Just a Touch just at the first nudge they're ready to go fire on all 16 cylinders yes sir that's a bride of Jesus Christ he said you're too stiff and starchy in your Society said if I had a society like that in my church I'd kick them out and start over with a bunch of harlots self-made bunch of educated idiots wow Jesus said whosoever will let him come but brother BR says but you don't want him you don't want him yeah yeah let the Holy Ghost get to working on on the coworker Amen on some on somebody's somebody's schoolmate they come into these doors they got a little makeup on or it's a woman wearing pants or a man with long hair you don't want them It embarrasses you amen cuz you got your you got your Apostolic legalistic reputation to uphold you don't want them amen you don't want them you just oh yeah if they if it's the mayor let him come if it's a doctor a lawyer an engineer let him come amen but Jesus said whosoever will and he said the last kind the last call was to go and get the kind of people that the church doesn't want that's the supper call amen go get the lowest one go down to the gutters and get somebody that needs Jesus and keep the polish out of the church James said if you come to the word and you're poor praise the Lord you've been lifted up he said if you come to the word and you're rich praise the Lord you've been brought down amen we're all one amen and this message ought to still have enough holy ghost in it to make a Sears sucker trousers put its arms around a silk suit and pull them up to the chest and be one in Christian love friends oh get the polish off the church get that starchy stiff High Society worried about whatever somebody thinks man-made religion out of here we don't want it we don't want it we're like that syop phenician woman she wasn't she wasn't one of the chosen she wasn't in the circle oh no she was a gentile so when she came to Jesus amen she was trying to get to Jesus amen but tradition was in her way amen and she tried to she needed him her daughter was so sick she had to get to Jesus it was the only hope that she had amen but when she when she tried to get to him she hit a wall of tradition and Jesus said hey this Bread's not for you this this isn't how the this isn't how things are done that's not how we do it in this church that's not according to our order that's not according to the way we teach it but she was perseverant the bride is persevering and so when she hits that wall she doesn't stop no she'll persevere she'll say Lord if you won't give me the bread I'll persevere for the crumbs I'll come by an untraditional way if you won't have me as the son of David I'll call you my lord I'll make you my master I'll grubel at your feet I'll get down and wash them I I I'll Cry tears of repentance I don't care who's watching I don't care what they think I'll do what it takes to get to Jesus that's the Bride of Jesus Christ I pray amen that we would get a spirit Among Us Amen to persevere past every tradition amen until we could get to Christ for this hour I pray we're not just getting our children to True Word Tabernacle I pray we're getting them the church and getting them to Christ where there's quickening power quickening power that's what lays Beyond the Veil oh you got to persevere amen you got to persevere until it's revealed to you amen that you were just trying the wrong way you were trying the wrong way amen as we go we go to the veil and we're longing to get into that shakina glory and because of all our traditional thinking amen we come to that Veil and we begin to shake it and pull on and tug and say let me in please let me in Lord I beg you let me pass the veil Lord let me get through but that denominational teaching and that old tradition and that legalism you were you were raised under amen and that condemnation somebody put on you and all that amen it's just keep you just can't press past it amen but just keep persevering until the Lord comes to you and takes you by the hand and says look amen don't press don't push don't work enter in enter in take me as your lord and enter in to the quickening power that's how an old dead Christian amen can get the greenness back and bear the fruit again in the shakina glory that's what the message came for friends amen amen to bring that quickening power to you amen you've heard a lot of teaching on in this church lately how the brother Bram said we are already resurrected you are already resurrected amen the Dynamics and the mechanics has quickened us and we're quickened in the presence of God where his spirit is that's where you're at where his spirit is seated together in Heavenly places he said we're already fired up oh brother Nathan I got to get past that Veil I I'm so afraid I'll miss the Rapture I'm so afraid I'm so afraid I'll be serpent seed I'm so afraid God will throw me away and I'll send away my day of Grace you're already fired up that Holy Ghost and Fire on the inside of you that's got you burning amen for the kingdom of God Amen that is the quickening power that raised up Jesus from the dead how could you miss the Rapture when the rapture's already in you you're already resurrected you know you're not trying to make it you already made it the message cut the veil so you can get into the shikina glory she won't be lay out of sin she will be by no means lukewarm I don't care how they teach bride maturity today I don't care how they present it as some kind of a cool oh sane and sens intellectual dry dead cold miserable Church experience that's not what it is this bride brother Bram said she will be by no means lukewarm she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving in the spirit of God Amen you'll be y you won't be lay out of see friends amen if you're a lay out of if you're acting like if you if you got the spirit of lay out of SE on you you got to come up a little higher come up into the bride Age come into the tent come into the holy of holies come into the Shak of Glory amen that's who the bride is she's not a bunch of Pentecostal babies brother Nathan that's all this Pentecostal preaching that's not what it is at all you need to listen to a few more messages you think I'm preaching Pentecost amen I am but not the one you're thinking no we're fired up in rapturing faith we've been fired up into something higher than that we're already resurrected we're getting ready for a Rapture friends amen that we're not we're not part of that Pentecostal denomination It's Just As Dead As the rest of them sure it is brother Bram said actually he never liked the word Pentecost amen because we talk about the Pentecostal fathers amen but that that outpouring to happen on the day of Pentecost amen the Pentecostal worshipper wasn't the ones in the upper room it was the ones that were just observing the feast they were just there for the tradition they were honoring the holiday amen but the real Pentecost is not a denomination it's not a tradition it's not a style worship it's a life it's an experience and we got to get back to the Pentecostal experience the eagle experience yes sir he said we're the ones we're the Church of the firstborn we're the ones that's in the kingdom of God yeah there's a lot of Pentecostal churches and they're just as dead and formal as the rest of them I know I'm preaching about formalism you think you think formalism is just a church where they just cross their arms and fall asleep and they never say an amen well that's that's formal that's dead as can be but most of the time when brother Brandon preaches on formalism he's preaching to Pentecostals amen because the Pentecostals got their form too they got their unbending way amen there's a lot of Pentecostal churches around the message where they bring the people in and they get out their Whip and say you better shout you better dance you better carry on you better get noisy or you're not spiritual amen you better do it the way that we do it here that's just a formal friends amen never let some man try to put you under a form and make you be conform to a certain pattern of behavior that's not Liberty that's not rival that's dead it's formal formal is normal yes sir formal is normal amen this church I I praise the lord it's normal to shout in this church it's normal to break out in a dance it's normal to say Amen it's normal to get excited I thank God it is I trust to never be but if we get to where we're just coming to truer Tabernacle on Sunday morning and just to act in a normal way come on on and this is just the way we do things here amen God spare us amen from a normal spirit I don't want anything to do with normal Christianity I don't want to be a normal message believer I don't want to be a normal church member I don't want to be formal I want to break out of every mold I want to fly I want to fly I'm an eagle don't cage me up you know we get in normal mode that's why God can't move normal mode you think yeah we got Liberty cuz it's noisy friends we got Liberty cuz we let the Holy Ghost do what he [Applause] wants normal mode oh brother R said you can Scream and Shout jump up and down all you want to but you deny this word it won't do any good that's always it it's a word test deny the word it won't do any good you're just cranking the Pistons you got the spark but you got no gasoline to fire it by amen that's the way the church will be said one will set still and the other one will go up both of them claim to be churches both claim to be bride you say What's the difference between the Pentecostals and the message Believers is that the message Believers have the Dynamics and the mechanics what's the difference between the bride and the Baptist the bride has the mechanics and the Dynamics amen she's got the amen she's got the gasoline to give her the power and she's got the spark to make it move she's got both of it friends amen these Pentecostal churches they'll be screaming and shouting and dancing their way right into the trip ulation amen and they'll be sitting still and the bride will be gone amen because all of that is just formal friends Amen brother brandom said it's like a like the mothers used to do they would take coffee grounds and sugar and put it in a sa and give it to the baby to nurse on that's all Pentecostal babies have is a bunch of hype and emotion something to stimulate the flesh something to get them worked up pumped up amen get the organ going till everybody's dancing amen but they got no word and they got so they got no life amen they could talk about the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you what the real Holy Ghost is the true token is the literal life of Jesus Christ it's the same life amen that made it so he couldn't stay in a grave amen but whether you're a dead Lutheran a dead Methodist or a dead Pentecostal you got to get this quickening power in you amen till you resurrect up out of your Dead traditions and get into the real life of Christ life friends life oh we're not Pentecostal by denomination but we're not dead either amen we've been restored to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers we not been restored just to emotion or just to gifts but we restored to life amen cuz our names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life and that's where the stimulation really is amen because John when he saw his name when he recognized that his name was on that Lamb's Book of Life that's when he could really have a good old fashion Pentecostal meeting that's when he could really make some noise amen oh because he got the Revelation that he had that eternal life that's why when you get around true word Tabernacle you're going to hear the message You're going to hear about seals that have been opened amen you're going to find out that Christ came down the mighty Angel descended in this hour Amen to take the seals off of God's book and give it back to the believer amen when he opened those Seven Seals he opened the Easter seal amen it was the Easter seal that came open amen because the real life of Christ had been buried back again under a Roman seal of denominational Traditions but the message broke the seal amen and that's why we got Easter like never before we've got life amen that's why you'll hear a little noise around here amen because when John saw his name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life he started getting into some King lamb worship amen he got so excited to know that he was one of God's elected of the day amen that the Bible said everything in the heavens everything beneath everything in the earth and everything in the sea heard John carrying on I pray Lord that we would get such a revelation of who we are today that there would not be a car go by amen that wouldn't hear the noise amen that the community would be aware that the world would become aware amen that there's somebody in bluon Ohio who saw their name written on the L's Book of Life you can't get out of order on that Revelation brother R said I've seen jumping spells and shouting spells and all those kind of things you know what he said nobody got hurt and that's what a lot of these dry formal amen oppressive denominational Spirits have got to learn amen that that carrying on like we had last night that don't hurt anybody actually it helps them actually it sets them free amen oh it don't hurt friends and brother BR said I never saw it out of order it was always right in order because they saw that their names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life ah I say we should praise the Lord today it's never out of order it's never out of order when it comes by the word and I want you to realize that the Revival we're enjoying in this church amen did not come to us by Pentecostal Traditions it did not come to us by man-made manufactured efforts it came by the preaching of the message amen but it came by leadership that knew enough to take their hands off of it and let the Holy Spirit have Liberty and because of that friends that's why we can dance amen and I know as soon as you break out out in a dance everybody around the world wants to come and balance you out and they want to take their quotes and try to slap the bonds back around our young people and say well yeah all right well it's all right if you dance but only so hard and only does this song it's all right if you shout but you can only shout too long and they'll take quotes they'll take quotes and kill the Revival they'll take that quote out of the first seal amen how many times has this quote been used to refrigerate a church in the four SE where brother Bram talked about the Pentecostal churches he said they get the music pumping up and everybody's jumping amen he said well I believe that brother Brandon believed in that he said but you know sometime when the Music Stops the dancing stops oo do you feel that nervous Spirit coming into the room on that go read the quote he said and that's all right too as long as they're living right I've listened to this Prophet all my life and I've heard him take the word of God and dismantle that Pentecostal denomination all the way down to the ground and lay the ax to the root of the tree and I have never one time heard him touch the blessings or try to withhold the joy and the worship and the freedom and the Liberty it's all right it's all right if they're living right in other words you got life so it's all right our teachers have made everything so super spiritual amen till the only way you're allowed to dance amen is if the if the Holy Ghost gets over you and just overwhelms you to where you become unconscious and you begin to just dance around and it don't matter if music's playing or what's going on I've seen it happen Zachary I remember at a youth camp I watched you dance for an hour or more it didn't matter what was playing you were caught up in the spirit dancing around the church I believe in that but you know what else I believe I believe that bride of Christ is free enough she's free enough amen she's free all together free indeed amen so when the song leader gets up and he begins to play amen some songs of Pentecostal praise I believe it's all right I believe it's all right to get that toe tapping get that body swaying it's all right we're alive I'm tired amen of these these super stitious overs spiritual amen dead formal Devils trying to take the Revival out of the [Applause] church you're free you got free expression we don't tell you to dance we don't tell you not to we don't tell you to shout we don't tell you not to say brother Athan I'm not really made that way I'm not I don't have that kind of nature that's all right you might not try it sometime just cuz you can just cuz he can not telling you what to do telling you you can that all right Pastor what I believe I think you believe that you gave me that impression free amen now scripturally they say oh you about they're just dancing because the music's pumping show me one time in the Bible they ever dance without music come on come on when David danced before the Lord they had the tambourine going they were playing the harps they struck up the band amen when Miriam amen when Miriam danced amen she took out that timberl heard a man preach one time he said we shouldn't have drums in the church cuz the never even mentions drum well it take a five minutes on Google to prove that one wrong amen that timberl that maram took that wasn't no tambourine it was a snare it was a drum she took that drum and she began to play I might I think she might have played it on the offbeat amen she started playing and she struck up a dancing Rhythm she began to say I get joy when I think about Egyptians in the sea I get joy when I think about no Tas Masters over me I'm free it's all right it's all right it's all right he deserves it he's worthy of it he man we got time to Worship the Lord we got freedom to do it let there be Liberty Give me liberty or give me death it'll be one or the other see when now holy ghost gets gets coming over your heart amen it begins to stimulate you until it don't matter if an army of Philistines after you you can run through that troop it don't matter what wall of denominational Traditions is between you and your promise you'll run through that wall you can do it now scripturally it'll always come with criticism so who cares it's further Vindication brother brand got so excited in the woods one time he started running around that tree that that little squirrel got out chatter chatter chatter chatter you know how he was running cuz there was an eagle sitting up there he saw how free that eagle was he saw how safe how secure how Untouchable that eagle was oh he got excited oh and it bothered that squirrel that squirrel just couldn't take it he just had to send that email he had to oh he had to complain he had to get on his blog and blog about it chatter chatter chatter chatter but it never bothered the eagle it never bothered the eagle let the Holy Ghost pour out in a meeting it'll get the chickens clucking but it don't bother an eagle oh when the Dynamics strike a chicken it don't do no good but when it strikes the eagle brother BR said he moves out hallelujah amen you know our our our bunch of denominational teachers around the message won't let the young people get enough Holy Ghost to get to the top of the fence post how they ever going to fly in the heaven you won't let them have a Pentecostal experience how they going to get into this bright Age come on let the little Eagles flop let them learn how to fly amen they're candidates for the Unseen World they're candidates for the supernatural don't deny them their experience amen that's a problem sometimes that's a problem Mary had amen cuz Mary had an experience with God but it didn't match their tradition amen what oh where we come in the message of the hour when the Holy Ghost gives somebody an experience but it don't fit the teaching It Don't Fit the tradition It Don't Fit the sensibilities well then throw them out cuz you'll never convince Mary of that brother man says she knew whose baby that was she was there when the angel came she was there when it happened I was there I was always an eagle they could peck on me but I'm an eagle and I already knew I was an eagle because when I heard this message amen I understood it brother BR said a true Eagle will understand when you recognize the message of the hour was Eagle food you heard from your theophany it ought to put you right back to where the sons of God were shouting for Joy Heavenly places friends there's nothing more sad no picture more tragic than a Cage Bird amen but what we've produced around the message by all of our man-made Traditions is a bunch of caged Eagles we got a little bunch of little baby eagles sitting in cages amen and the devil didn't put them in there we put them in there by our traditions and by our teachings and by our superstitions amen but there's only one message to caged Eagles yeah yeah we heard about the unclean Birds they got their cage they got their judgment they got their message but the only message to caged Eagles is House of Hell giveway House of Hell give way friends if you're an if you if you know you're an eagle today I don't know what kind of cage you're in maybe somehow you made it through that service last night and you didn't receive your deliverance well then put the name amen if you're bold enough shout it out right now whatever you're dealing with amen speak it out to the Lord amen and I'm anointed to preach you the message of the hour and the only thing the message of the hour has to say to cage Eagles is House of Hell give way depression give way suicide give way homosexual Spirits give way pornography give way dead cold formal lukewarm conditions give Way open up the grave hallelujah hallelujah that's why you could see the Rapture you are the Rapture yeah you realize what this message represents brother Bram said there will come forth for the first time a bright age say well every age had a bright age but not like this one he said for the first time there will come forth a bright age and the bright age will be a resurrection out of dark denominationalism oh friends a message that the full maturity of the word has returned in full power full maturity mechanics full power dynamics amen full maturity and full power has been waved over the people by the same signs and wonders and what the message what the waving of the sheath means is because I live you live also because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is Amen to be quickened from the dead friends we got the mechanics and the Dynamics we got full maturity we got full power we got rapturing faith amen we don't have to trade one for the other we come into the resurrection already what a resurrection that was when the mighty conqueror went down into the regions of the Lost took the keys snatched them out of the hands of the devil said you can't hold my children anymore amen you don't have a key for the door you can't lock them up you can't hold them back amen I'm sitting before him an open door that anybody that hears my word and believes on me amen can come up out of their dark denominational grave and come into resurrection and life amen because I live my children will live they'll be alive they'll have signs of life amen they'll be alive in Emotion they'll be alive in power they'll be alive in maturity they'll be alive in character they'll be all together quickened from the dead that's what the message is it's a resurrection oh friends don't you remember where you were you were dead you were dead you were sitting in that barroom or you were sitting in that Pew and you were just as dead as you could be you were dead in that club you were dead in that Baptist Church brother Jonathan you were in a message Church you were in this church but you were dead amen but when the light flashed over you you recognized the rising of the sun amen and Easter came into your life and pulled you out of that denominational grave now we see you shining CU your light has come oh yeah God had to send a message amen because no matter how we reformed God's church it was still dead Ezekiel Saw the vision of it you've heard it pre on all weekend how it's that fourth work amen because there was a valley of dry bones and that was supposed to be an invincible Army but the tragic picture was they were dry dead conquered it was a conquered Army oh yeah it was an Army that started out with High Hopes High ambitions amen but after a while amen the battles of Life came in amen and the cankerworm and the Palmer worm and the caterpillar ate away at that Army until it was nothing but a valley of dry bones and oh yeah the holy oh yeah the wind could come and blow over them and it could shake the bones and make a rattle it couldn't bring any life so God sent Luther God sent Wesley God sent acts God sent 1906 Pentecost isusa Street yeah those were works of God Amen and before you knew it oh yeah because he said I'll restore it I'll restore it I know it's dead but I'll restore it amen but by three works of Redemption come into the church amen it put the it put the senu back on the bones it put the flesh over the senu and it put the skin over the flesh amen and now you got a bunch of churches out here that look real good amen they look so good amen they got they got good fundamental preaching they got good free worship they got everything you would think that it would need amen but when you go around to these denominational churches and if I had have come around by some of you before you received your resurrection and looked you in the eye amen the eyes would have told the story dead blank laying there in that dry Valley yeah you're Justified yeah you're Sanctified yeah you went to you could go to a youth camp and get under the move of the Holy Ghost on your spirit amen but on the inside dead dead what a terrible picture but God said I'll restore it I'll restore it so after three works of redemption amen he spoke to his prophet he said Son of Man son of man son of man prophesy one more time and call to the winds amen call to the winds and cause them to enter into those corpses and let it be the Breath of Life breathing into those lungs that's what the message of the hour f is friends it's the Breath of God Amen to Breathe Into You amen until until you could live live and be what a Christian was supposed to be live and worship you like you're alive live and feel like you're alive it's life it's breath I say Lord breathe on us amen that's what the Elijah Ministry does Moses never raised the dead Isaiah never raised the dead but mama if you got a if you got babies that are in a spiritually dead condition I'll tell you what you do get them under the Elijah Ministry Amen Let it amen spread that Elijah Ministry out over them amen and let it breathe a breath of life into them it'll do it friends it's full of quickening power sir amen it's full of quickening power oh yeah Pentecostals are saying where is that rushing Mighty Wind where' It Go oh that rushing Mighty Wind that roared into the upper room and even in brother brandom's meeting came in and roared you can hear it right over the microphone that
