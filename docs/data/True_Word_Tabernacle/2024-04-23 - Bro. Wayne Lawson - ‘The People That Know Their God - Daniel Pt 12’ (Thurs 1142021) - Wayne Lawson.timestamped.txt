[4:50] have in store for your church Lord we're
[4:54] we're here tonight to just to yield
[4:56] ourselves to
[4:57] that we heard
[5:00] your Prophet speaking today by tape and
[5:03] he said Lord that there are many gifts
[5:05] in the body teachers and pastors and
[5:07] evangelist and missionaries and speakers
[5:10] with tongues and visions and but Lord he
[5:13] said the problem is is finding someone
[5:16] to yield to it and I pray tonight father
[5:20] that we be a yielded vessel Lord we're
[5:23] not wanting to show a an intellectual
[5:27] ability or human power

[6:05] and the honor for it father you're a
[6:07] merciful god and we ask it in the name
[6:10] of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
[6:15] God bless you tonight if you have your
[6:17] Bibles we'd maybe just like to take a
[6:19] few moments in the scripture for the
[6:21] Book of Daniel the 11th chapter and uh I
[6:24] want to just pick back up here in this
[6:26] 32nd
[6:27] verse um it say a very very powerful
[6:31] verse of scripture and I I had a lot of
[6:34] things on it that I just barely got
[6:36] started in it on Sunday and the spirit
[6:39] of the Lord just kind of took over it
[6:40] was time to time to worship a little
[6:42] while and
[6:45] amen in the 32nd verse Daniel
[6:55] 11:32 and to such as do wickedly against
[6:59] the Covenant shall be corrupt by
[7:03] flatteries but the people that do know
[7:06] their God shall be
[7:09] strong and do
[7:11] exploits God bless you tonight as you
[7:14] may be seated I just want to take a a
[7:17] few minutes tonight in this and I'd like
[7:20] to just continue in this exploits of
[7:22] Faith um and having this in the
[7:25] background of our mind that this is
[7:27] going to tie into the third pool of
[7:29] course but I want to I just want to take
[7:31] a few moments into this scripture and
[7:34] and it it it it has got it's got a lot
[7:37] in it amen it's got a lot in it uh the
[7:40] scripture speaking here in Daniel
[7:42] chapter 11 saying but the people that do
[7:45] know their God shall be strong and do
[7:48] great exploits uh I like how this begins
[7:51] saying the people amen telling us then
[7:55] that this is not just an individual
[7:57] person but this is a group of people
[8:00] it's people who uh it will be involved
[8:04] it'll be a people now I know sometimes
[8:06] that that's a very general statement the
[8:09] people but that it actually is speaking
[8:11] of someone when you go to the book of
[8:14] Hosea remember the scripture prophesies
[8:16] that the people who were not a people
[8:19] shall be called the people of God and
[8:21] over in the Book of Romans Paul said
[8:23] that's not in Hosea is not speaking of
[8:25] the Jew only but it's also speaking of
[8:27] the Gentile as when Abraham was told
[8:29] that his seed shall be as the stars and
[8:32] as the Sands of the sea speaking of the
[8:34] people who were not a people but become
[8:37] a people that's where the scripture says
[8:39] you're are a chosen people right amen
[8:42] and seeing that the end time message
[8:44] brings that closer to you when over in
[8:46] Revelations the 18th chapter and the
[8:48] fourth verse it said come out of her my
[8:52] people and remember when brother Bram
[8:54] went beyond the curtain of time and the
[8:56] six uh that tells it in the fifth seal
[8:58] there real real PL he tells how that he
[9:00] went beyond the curtain of time and
[9:02] while he was there he seen a lot of
[9:04] people coming and they said are these
[9:05] all Broms he said oh no he said these
[9:08] are your converts and those people were
[9:11] the people who were followers of this
[9:13] message were wearing white robes amen
[9:16] and they had already been beyond and
[9:18] they all said of course if you hadn't
[9:21] come we wouldn't be here amen so so the
[9:24] people that I'm talking about are
[9:26] actually in scripture uh but I believe
[9:28] that there are alive today and I
[9:30] personally believe that there's some of
[9:32] those people sitting in this building
[9:34] tonight I believe that we are uh uh that
[9:36] we are privileged to speak to the people
[9:39] uh that Daniel saw in this Vision that
[9:42] many years ago I know that's a an
[9:44] amazing thing but to think about tonight
[9:47] that God could foresee and and I I would
[9:49] challenge anyone to to the scripture
[9:52] upon the theology that God fornew
[9:54] foresaw and fores spoke of this end time
[9:57] bride it's easy for us to look at the
[9:59] scripture and we could see Jesus and how
[10:01] he was predestinated and we can see him
[10:03] in the prophecies and and we could see
[10:05] him spoken in the word but the prophet
[10:08] tells us that his mystical body is just
[10:11] as predestinated as his physical body
[10:15] and she is spoken of the same as was his
[10:17] natural body that came from Mary so is
[10:20] this end time bride spoken of in
[10:22] scripture and as he stepped out of the
[10:25] Old Testament and become the Fulfillment
[10:27] of those prophecies so is the bride
[10:29] stepping out and becoming the
[10:31] Fulfillment of the prophecies that was
[10:33] given to them now so I I believe today
[10:36] that of course the scripture would speak
[10:38] it in a symbol but then the symbol has
[10:40] to become a reality at some point and
[10:43] when the Thunders are revealed how many
[10:45] knows brother B said that's when the
[10:46] symbol was taken off and it become a
[10:48] reality because the voice of God reveals
[10:51] it amen it actually brings the
[10:53] revelation of it and and to see now this
[10:56] the people uh the Bible said that do
[10:58] know their God so the people that do
[11:00] know their God I I I'm saying that this
[11:03] is an end time prophecy uh that it's
[11:05] spoken for the end times so I'm speaking
[11:08] to the people of the end time the people
[11:11] that do know their God Amen when I when
[11:13] I when I think of this I think of those
[11:15] people uh that are to show up in the end
[11:18] time as that blood-washed bride uh
[11:21] people that do know their God Amen now
[11:24] they they if the people that do know
[11:26] their God now of course here if we look
[11:28] in pH Philippians chapter 3 uh Paul said
[11:31] this that I may know him in the power of
[11:35] his resurrection that's how we're
[11:36] supposed to know him is in the power of
[11:39] his resurrection now s would see Jesus
[11:42] brother bandam says he said now we could
[11:44] know him to know him by the word he said
[11:47] to know him by the word it's all right
[11:50] but it's a long ways from being
[11:51] sufficient to know him by the word we've
[11:54] got to know him by the person of his
[11:57] resurrection amen now of course here and
[11:59] you must be borned again uh brother Bram
[12:02] will say this he said the true word
[12:04] comes to the true prophet he said and he
[12:07] tells you the true word and you follow
[12:10] that true word you will get a true
[12:13] experience of that word because the word
[12:16] is made flesh in you I like that don't
[12:17] you the word comes to a prophet you
[12:20] follow the word and the word leads you
[12:22] to an experience of the word it'll make
[12:24] the word become flesh in you of course
[12:27] this is the age that the people are to
[12:29] know God they're to know him in the way
[12:32] that he is revealed there's a lot of
[12:33] people miss him and the prophet said the
[12:36] reason they miss him is because they
[12:38] miss him in the Simplicity of the way he
[12:40] reveals himself they they miss God
[12:43] because they don't see the way he
[12:45] reveals himself because God both hides
[12:47] himself in Simplicity and he reveals
[12:50] himself the same way amen now if you can
[12:53] uh see that this is the age amen I I I I
[12:56] would say that if we are looking in the
[12:58] Book of Luke the 24th chapter I believe
[13:01] that we could see a prophecy of these
[13:03] same people that know their God and do
[13:05] exploits I believe we see a prophecy of
[13:08] these people in the tub that's on the
[13:09] road to EMAs when they were walking and
[13:12] they walked a six-hour journey brother B
[13:14] types it with this with the church ages
[13:16] and how that there's a a people that
[13:18] hear the gospel for the six ages he said
[13:22] but watch in the end time when it become
[13:24] the evening these two goes in the room
[13:27] with Jesus right at the end right if the
[13:29] evening and the Bible says in Luke 24:31
[13:32] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[13:36] him and their eyes were open and they
[13:39] knew him now what did Jesus do to them
[13:43] that made their eyes open now we're
[13:45] talking about end time prophecies uh
[13:47] they there was something here that made
[13:49] them know that it was him they they
[13:52] actually seen and knew it was him
[13:53] brother Adam said the way he opened
[13:55] their eyes is the same way he opened the
[13:58] eyes of the woman at the well it was the
[14:01] same way he opened Peter's eyes when he
[14:04] told him who his father was and what his
[14:06] name was it's the same way he opened
[14:09] their eyes so the Messiah sign or the
[14:12] sign that the church would know him
[14:14] would not be revealed to the end time so
[14:16] this prophecy is not laying for another
[14:19] day but it's actually a current prophecy
[14:22] for the age we're living in again we can
[14:24] look in John 14 and the 20th verse the
[14:27] Bible said for in that day you shall
[14:29] know him Amen in that day you shall know
[14:32] that I am in the father that you in me
[14:35] and I in you now what day is that
[14:37] brother bam said it's the day when the
[14:39] Revelation is made known that's the
[14:41] season that we're living in amen that's
[14:44] the reason this message has come is to
[14:47] make you know him that's the purpose of
[14:50] the message that's the reason he's
[14:52] appearing in the last day how many knows
[14:53] the Bible prophesies this in 1 John
[14:56] chapter 3 and it says when he shall
[14:58] appear he said You shall be like him for
[15:01] you shall know him as he is that's right
[15:03] so it takes an appearing of the Lord to
[15:06] know him it takes a revealing of the
[15:09] Lord to know him so if the Bible
[15:11] prophesies and says you shall know the
[15:13] Lord amen do you see it's it's not
[15:15] saying I will reveal myself but it's
[15:17] saying that you will know him which
[15:19] tells us that there will be a revealing
[15:22] of him just as he prophesied in Luke
[15:24] 17:30 and said in that day when the son
[15:27] of man is revealed and how many ever
[15:29] heard brother B say the day he shall be
[15:32] made known so in the season of making
[15:35] known that's the season of the church
[15:37] that's the hour so so what would it be
[15:39] for God to make himself known and nobody
[15:42] there to recognize it amen as it is such
[15:45] in sometime some of the message uh
[15:47] directions in the end time amen
[15:49] everybody Stacks everything up in
[15:50] brother brandom and they place it on the
[15:52] prophet and it's all something 50 years
[15:54] ago and now we're just here putting
[15:56] things together intellectually and
[15:58] trying to progress the church in
[16:00] knowledge and training and intellectual
[16:02] things and and I'm I'm for reading the
[16:04] books and you can tell by the way I
[16:05] preach that I study the message believe
[16:07] the message but you see you can take the
[16:09] words of God and put them together with
[16:12] intellectuals and that's not God Amen
[16:14] intellectual power is not God that's the
[16:17] reason there's so many intellectual
[16:19] Christians is because there's a lot of
[16:21] intellectual preachers an intellectual
[16:24] knowledge produces an intellectual power
[16:26] so that's why people will stand and
[16:28] Proclaim their ability in the
[16:30] resurrection because they say well I
[16:31] know this and I know this and I know
[16:33] this and I know this but somebody's got
[16:35] to know him the power of the
[16:38] Resurrection The Power of the Rapture
[16:40] somebody's got to experience that amen
[16:43] and then the Holy Spirit can use gifts
[16:45] of the body amen that those gifts ad
[16:48] Ministry the holy spirit will take
[16:50] things that truly are the word but he'll
[16:52] put them together by the spirit and when
[16:55] they're spoken they will release the
[16:57] spirit and and many times when the
[16:59] spirit is released from a from God
[17:01] anointed Ministry and God anointed gifts
[17:04] when the spirit is released and somebody
[17:06] who's intellectual will run off and say
[17:08] well that's just emotional but I I won't
[17:10] stand still to allow people to water
[17:13] down the moving of the Holy Ghost as
[17:15] some experience of emotionalism or some
[17:19] Pentecostalism amen it's the power of
[17:21] God under salvation it's the power of
[17:25] God that delivers hearts and fixes and
[17:27] and we're we're here under brother
[17:29] Ericson who's who's not a big counselor
[17:32] or psychological fell to try to counsel
[17:34] everything out of everybody he's a
[17:36] little like I am and believe in the Holy
[17:38] Ghost will fix things amen if we can
[17:41] turn the Holy Ghost loose it'll fix
[17:43] depressions it'll fix marriage problems
[17:46] it'll fix issues it'll fix things you
[17:48] ain't even talked to us about because
[17:51] the Holy Ghost is a discerner of the
[17:53] thought and the intents of the heart
[17:55] amen I seen the Holy Ghost released in
[17:57] this church on Sunday and I've seen
[17:59] things fixed the people been carrying
[18:01] things in their Spirit little
[18:03] depressions and troubles and we've been
[18:05] praying Lord how is this going to be
[18:07] fixed amen but I tell you what to fix
[18:09] everything is to get God in the room one
[18:12] time and let the Holy Spirit turn loose
[18:15] upon the church and he'll make the weak
[18:17] say I am strong and he'll make the poor
[18:20] say I am rich he'll give them something
[18:23] to testify about the power of God I
[18:26] think it's time to release the anointing
[18:28] the church and to take the limits off of
[18:31] God to let the Holy Spirit deal with
[18:34] hearts and deal with lives amen come on
[18:36] now that's a yielding preacher and a
[18:38] yielding congregation we can't ball up
[18:41] every time a little correction comes
[18:43] across the platform every time the Holy
[18:46] Spirit begins to deal with the life
[18:47] that's not a time to ball up and get
[18:49] your feelings hurt and get mad at the
[18:51] preacher that's a time to say oh me
[18:53] that's the truth anyhow I'm going to
[18:55] stand in the house of God and let the
[18:58] spirit of God not deal with my life
[19:00] because if we're ever going to take a
[19:02] rapture we will do it not by might not
[19:05] by power but by my spirit sayith the
[19:08] Lord of hosts we are looking to change
[19:11] our bodies from a mortal body to an
[19:14] immortal body and how are we going to do
[19:16] it through an intellectual power the
[19:19] intellectual powers of this world has
[19:22] got things so messed up they don't know
[19:24] whether they're boys or girls they don't
[19:26] even know if God created the Earth
[19:28] people don't know they're in confusion
[19:31] they're through into Bottomless Pits of
[19:33] man's ideas but God has still got an
[19:36] anointing upon his word that'll make you
[19:40] know that there's a God and there's a
[19:42] reality to these things my when I think
[19:45] about it tonight I think about the
[19:47] people that's going to know their God
[19:50] Amen the people that know their God Amen
[19:53] I believe there's some people in here
[19:54] tonight that know God I believe we
[19:56] really know him in the power of his
[19:59] manifestations we welcome him in the
[20:01] power of His realities we know him see
[20:05] see see we know his nature we know his
[20:07] character that's why we can go through
[20:09] hard things but if you know God amen
[20:12] sister sus the Bible said all things
[20:14] were together for the good of them that
[20:16] love God and to them are called
[20:18] according to his purpose the devil would
[20:20] try to make you think that God was
[20:22] behind the storm but brother bam comes
[20:24] along and he said the storm the winds
[20:26] would have never hurt you till the devil
[20:28] got into it amen so the devil's your
[20:31] adversary amen that's the reason
[20:33] sicknesses they don't come from God it
[20:36] comes from the devil that's the reason
[20:38] we can fight it that's the reason we can
[20:40] stand up in this age because we know the
[20:43] nature of our God my when I think about
[20:47] this tonight I think that there's a
[20:49] people amen believing people amen that
[20:52] he should appear in the last days to
[20:55] bring these people back to the word that
[20:57] she would know her husband her mate the
[20:59] revealed word you'll know him like a
[21:01] woman knows her
[21:02] husband that's pretty intimate that's a
[21:06] powerful way to know God Amen now
[21:08] brother Ram says this is when amen the
[21:10] church is brought into full Covenant
[21:12] again the Covenant of the church he took
[21:15] his physical body and he gave you his
[21:17] spirit so the Covenant that you have
[21:19] with God is his
[21:22] Spirit without his Spirit you don't have
[21:25] a
[21:26] covenant without his Spirit now now I I
[21:29] I could take this to the scripture I'll
[21:30] give you one scripture and then I'll
[21:31] move on in Romans the 8th chapter said
[21:34] he that hath not the spirit of God is
[21:36] none of
[21:37] his amen you don't belong to God without
[21:41] the spirit of God it's your Covenant
[21:45] with God you're not Jew by your natural
[21:48] birth you are only a Jew by a spiritual
[21:51] birth and you become the Seed of Abraham
[21:54] by the spirit the spirit of God must
[21:58] quick you to put you into these promises
[22:01] you're dead until the spirit of God
[22:03] quickens you in Ephesians chapter 1 they
[22:06] said he whom he hath quickened or has
[22:09] made alive it takes the spirit of God to
[22:11] do it now that Spirit was justifying the
[22:14] Holy Ghost was justified in the days of
[22:17] Luther he was Sanctified in the days of
[22:19] Wesley but the Bible says that the
[22:21] Covenant is to be brought into a full
[22:24] strength in the last days that's the
[22:27] spirit now brother B I'm going take this
[22:28] this to the book of Isaiah the 28th
[22:30] chapter in the message the true witness
[22:33] and he'll read the scripture for in the
[22:34] day shall the Lord of hosts be a Crown
[22:36] of Glory and a diem of beauty under the
[22:39] residue of his people and the spirit of
[22:41] judgment to him that Seth in judgment
[22:43] and watch and for strength them that
[22:46] turn the battle to the gate the spirit
[22:49] shall be strength unto them that turn
[22:51] the battle to the gate brother bam says
[22:53] it like this Isaiah this great man
[22:55] foretold the coming of the Holy Ghost if
[22:58] we go I can read it let's just read for
[23:00] a moment and find out about the coming
[23:01] of the Holy Spirit Isaiah let's read in
[23:03] the fifth verse and brother man begins
[23:05] to read it in the day of the Lord the
[23:07] the Crown of Glory he's speaking of this
[23:09] great day when the witness comes when it
[23:12] is our Crown the holy spirit is our
[23:16] Crown isn't that
[23:18] amazing that's the crown of the church
[23:20] is the Holy Spirit and the diadem of
[23:23] beauty unto the residue of his people
[23:27] amen Now isn't it something the residue
[23:29] the people that's left over he'll be a
[23:31] diadem a Crown of Glory a diadem then
[23:34] think 700 years before it happen the
[23:36] spirit of judgment to him that sth in
[23:39] judgment what does it do it takes it do
[23:41] at the altar for strength to them that
[23:43] turn the battle then them who is
[23:46] standing for him and with him this great
[23:49] spirit the Holy Spirit that's prophesied
[23:51] will be the strength of him that stands
[23:53] at the gate in the battle he is our
[23:56] strength we rely upon him not upon
[23:59] culture not upon education not upon the
[24:02] things of the world not by might or by
[24:05] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[24:07] the church rest solemnly in that he will
[24:12] be the strength of him that stands in
[24:14] the gate not his theological background
[24:18] not his denomination but the Holy Ghost
[24:20] will be his strength he will be the one
[24:24] that stands in the gate he'll rely upon
[24:27] the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn
[24:29] the alien
[24:30] away again Isaiah prophesied it said it
[24:33] would come to pass that he would send
[24:35] his Spirit it' be a Crown of Glory for
[24:36] the church a strength for him that
[24:39] stands in the gate how would we know it
[24:42] was the spirit because the Bible said
[24:44] with stammering lips and other tongues
[24:46] will I speak unto this people and this
[24:48] is the rest and the refreshing but
[24:51] brother bam said but for all of this
[24:53] they wanted an organization and their
[24:55] denomination rather than the spirit is a
[24:58] Crown they wanted a denomination as a
[25:00] crown rather than the spirit as a crown
[25:02] they wanted intellectual power as a
[25:04] crown rather than letting him be the
[25:06] crown of the church to be the to be the
[25:09] Showcase of the church they want
[25:11] something else to show their building
[25:13] their organization their abilities amen
[25:16] but the real crown of the Church of the
[25:18] Living God is the spirit of God that
[25:21] comes among them amen he is a refreshing
[25:24] amen the presence of God is a refreshing
[25:27] to a man and the Bible said with
[25:29] stammering lips in other tongues will I
[25:31] speak unto this people see that's why
[25:34] David said for the Lord is my strength
[25:36] and blessed is that man whose strength
[25:39] is in the Lord remember the scripture
[25:41] from strength unto strength amen from
[25:44] increasing Victorious power amen a
[25:47] strengthen the church by the spirit of
[25:49] God Amen I left you here on Sunday Paul
[25:53] uh uh uh actually David amen prophesied
[25:56] about a strength to a strength move
[25:58] moving from Victory to Victory amen but
[26:00] in numbers we found Caleb who was a
[26:03] follower remember the the the the the
[26:05] the the first part of the quotes that we
[26:08] read to you the true word comes to a
[26:10] true prophet and if you'll follow that
[26:12] true word you'll get a true word
[26:14] experience amen and Caleb had a
[26:17] following Spirit what was he following
[26:20] the prophet of the hour Moses amen and
[26:23] the Caleb of this hour will be following
[26:26] the prophet of this hour a true word
[26:28] prophet and if they will continue to
[26:30] follow Jesus said this to his disciples
[26:33] if you'll follow if you'll continue in
[26:35] the truth you shall know the truth and
[26:39] the truth is what's going to set you
[26:40] free if you're going to get free tonight
[26:43] the truth's going to set you free the
[26:45] truth the spirit of the word will come
[26:48] in as a deliverer and he that the sun
[26:51] sets free he's going to be free indeed
[26:54] there's nothing like the freedom that
[26:56] when the Holy Ghost releases a a man of
[26:59] his of his ideas and of his troubles and
[27:02] the situations of his life my freedom
[27:05] like you've never add in your life isn't
[27:07] it beautiful to be free in the spirit
[27:09] isn't it beautiful to believe for the
[27:11] things of God and to allow his Spirit to
[27:15] come amen it's like Caleb who was 85
[27:18] years old amen and said I'm as strong as
[27:21] the day I was in the day that Moses sent
[27:23] me my strength even so more strong now
[27:26] for war to go out and to come in
[27:30] therefore give me this mountain you see
[27:32] what he was saying I'm not going to let
[27:34] these amalekites or these anx or any
[27:37] other a take anything that Moses said I
[27:40] could have and I believe there's a
[27:42] Church of the Living God that'll fully
[27:44] follow this message and if this Prophet
[27:47] prophesied that that would be a bride in
[27:49] strength in this hour she won't keep
[27:52] fighting until she possesses everything
[27:55] that the message says she could have
[27:57] this this message said we can have an
[27:59] experience with God this message said
[28:02] these signs shall follow them that
[28:04] believe this message said that creative
[28:06] power will come into the Church of the
[28:09] Living God this message says that we
[28:11] will become as a minority but we will
[28:13] grow in power and in strength and there
[28:16] will be a people on the Earth that who
[28:18] will be alive in the day when God
[28:21] changes a body from a mortal to an
[28:24] immortal somebody so full of the Holy
[28:26] Ghost until every every fiber of their
[28:29] body oh Church of the Living God I do
[28:31] not believe the Rapture will be a
[28:34] intellectual experience I believe it
[28:36] will be an intimate spiritual experience
[28:38] with almighty God I believe it'll be a
[28:41] so falling in love into the presence of
[28:43] God until you're changed from one
[28:46] dimension to another dimension I know
[28:48] what I'm talking about I've been in the
[28:50] spirit of prayer until I feel a
[28:52] quickening take a hold of my tongue take
[28:54] a hold of my eyes take a hold of my mind
[28:57] begin to tie things together and put me
[29:00] in another dimension tell me things
[29:02] that's about to take place and prophesy
[29:04] to me in my inner chamers the same
[29:07] spirit of God that saves you the same
[29:09] spirit of God that deals with you is the
[29:12] same spirit of God that will leads you
[29:14] to every promise this Bible said you
[29:17] could have we are join HS to every
[29:20] promise that Jesus Christ made to the
[29:22] church and we're not going to give up on
[29:24] one inch of this
[29:25] ground I think we should learn from
[29:28] Israel amen we cannot trade land for
[29:31] peace it will not work you cannot give
[29:34] up land and get peace with a devil every
[29:37] piece of land you give up the devil's
[29:39] taking more if you give up the the right
[29:42] of creative power he'll take away your
[29:44] right to pray for the sick you give up
[29:46] your right to pray for the sick he'll
[29:48] take your joy he'll take your happiness
[29:51] he'll take your faith he'll make you a
[29:53] Weak and Powerless church but there's a
[29:55] pride in the last days that not going to
[29:58] give up one inch of the ground that God
[30:02] has given we have already had prophecy
[30:05] over our lives we have been prophesied
[30:08] over oh God I believe there's a church
[30:11] amen that's riding this Trail again I
[30:14] believe there's a church that is
[30:16] prophesying again I believe there's a
[30:18] church who's on the ride tonight we got
[30:21] the sword in our mouth we're on a
[30:23] Vindicated word and we're going to ride
[30:25] down every devil and get him between the
[30:28] church and the promises of God church
[30:31] this is not a time to let off this is a
[30:33] time to press the battle this is a time
[30:36] to press like you've never pressed
[30:38] before press against it until the
[30:40] anointing of God drops into your life my
[30:44] Lord what an hour to serve God what a
[30:47] day to serve God the holy spirit will be
[30:50] your
[30:52] crown n it's nothing to get ashamed
[30:55] about the Holy Spirit ain't something to
[30:57] be ashamed of it's something to
[30:59] welcome it's something to welcome in the
[31:01] church it'll it'll heal the sick babies
[31:05] amen it'll heal the sick Minds it'll
[31:07] take care of situations that we don't
[31:09] even understand but God is still a God
[31:13] who is able to do the things that he
[31:16] prophesied that he would do don't you
[31:18] think you give up a little land you're
[31:19] going to get some peace that's a devil
[31:22] line to
[31:24] you well we might as well go ahead and
[31:26] preach about it haven't we amen one of
[31:28] these well some of these girls get a
[31:29] little Victory and dance out in the
[31:31] aisle Devil comes and says well he man
[31:33] did you do the right thing is that what
[31:35] you should have done then they get
[31:36] worried because somebody thinks one
[31:37] thing somebody thinks something else and
[31:39] then the Devil comes and says well if
[31:41] you just wouldn't do that anymore you
[31:43] wouldn't have to worry about that but
[31:45] you know the problem is the minute you
[31:47] back up on God the spirit of God leaves
[31:49] you and you get depressed you get
[31:51] discouraged you don't have the ability
[31:54] to surrender no more cuz you're
[31:56] terrified of what might happen happen
[31:58] when you let go well let me tell you
[32:00] tonight I've lost my fear of men and
[32:03] what they can do to me I say let go and
[32:06] let God have his way in the Church of
[32:08] the Living God let the power of God fall
[32:11] in the church amen the only thing they
[32:13] can do is kill me the only thing the
[32:15] world can do is kill me and that would
[32:17] release me that would release me to go
[32:20] in the presence of God like I've never
[32:23] been in my life I believe it's the hour
[32:26] let the Holy Ghost come in a way it's
[32:28] never come yielding in a way that we
[32:31] never had well somebody's going to think
[32:34] we're Heretics but I'm with Apostle Paul
[32:36] and Ray Ericson and the way you call
[32:39] heresy is the way I worship the god of
[32:41] my fathers the way you call a
[32:46] nut Willam Brandon said it why why I am
[32:50] a Holy
[32:52] Roller yes sir I'm identified right
[32:55] there a Holy Roller a nut a holy ghost
[32:58] filled man but at least I'm yielding to
[33:01] something that is giv life back to me
[33:04] that's given strength back to me Satan
[33:07] has come but he's come to kill you and
[33:09] to steal and to Rob your joy and to Rob
[33:13] your blessing but let the spirit of God
[33:15] bring strength upon you KN him invite
[33:19] him bring him in let him yield your life
[33:23] to
[33:23] him now I know what I'm talking about
[33:26] you go to Quench and the spirit and
[33:28] you'll find a different kind of
[33:30] God you going to quench in the spirit
[33:33] the brother R knows what I'm saying cut

[33:38] that let him call you and you say I'm
[33:39] not going to do it you'll go backwards
[33:41] 100 m hour but if God's calling you it's
[33:44] time to answer the call if God's dealing
[33:46] with you it's time to say Lord I'm ready
[33:49] for you to deal with my life if he's
[33:51] trying to give you the Holy Ghost it's
[33:53] time to surrender to the Holy Ghost if
[33:56] he's trying to take over over your
[33:58] family say God come and take over my
[34:01] church take over my family take over my

[34:59] singing until worship strikes the
[35:02] building and God makes a bunch of men

[35:17] devil I'm not going to give my yielding
[35:19] to no devil I'm not going to live in
[35:21] fear of what happens when the Holy Ghost
[35:23] comes I say God come on it might be
[35:27] tonight that our bodies are
[35:30] changed Oh Glory to God I believe it's
[35:34] the hour for it I believe these exploits
[35:37] are more than just healing for sick I
[35:39] believe they're more than just a
[35:41] gathering together I believe the
[35:43] exploits that's going to be done in the
[35:44] church amen the Bible said limbs can be
[35:47] added I believe we're living in the
[35:49] season of it that you can speak the word
[35:51] of God and it'll be as you said I
[35:54] believe we're living in the season you
[35:56] are one word from the the change of your
[36:00] body you're a to be sitting here on a
[36:02] night just like tonight and the gospel
[36:04] being preached to you and the word
[36:06] released and you receive it and you feel
[36:10] a change start coming over you come on
[36:12] if it can change you in the spirit why
[36:14] can't it change you in the body you come
[36:16] in here sometimes in you're draging and
[36:18] you can barely get in the door but about
[36:20] 20 minutes into the sermon something
[36:22] starts churning you start feeling better
[36:25] what's it doing is changing you is
[36:27] changing you from the natural to the
[36:30] Supernatural and the Holy Ghost is here
[36:33] to change us in one of these days he
[36:35] will change us from the natural man to a
[36:39] innatural man or a supernatural being in
[36:43] God I believe it it's not an hour to be
[36:46] weak in the
[36:48] spirit it's not an hour to back up on
[36:50] the spirit of God this is an hour to go
[36:53] forward with all your heart and with all
[36:55] your might
[36:58] God if you want to use me use me
[37:00] Lord you want to speak through me speak
[37:02] through me Lord you want to deal with me
[37:04] deal with me Lord I'm not going to cut
[37:06] you
[37:06] off what business do we have to tell God
[37:10] he don't have a right in our lives what
[37:12] business do we have to tell God you
[37:14] can't do that through me Lord amen why
[37:17] wouldn't we be a yielded Church why
[37:19] wouldn't we be a yielded vessel why
[37:21] wouldn't be yield as young people have
[37:23] you got to be 40 years old before God
[37:26] can use you I don't MO believe it I
[37:28] believe God can use any of these young
[37:30] men and women in this church I believe
[37:32] he can use them in the gifts I believe
[37:34] he can use them in the ministry I
[37:35] believe he can use them in song he can
[37:37] use them in anointing and he can use
[37:40] them to pull on the word of God until
[37:42] tell the Holy Ghost falls in the church
[37:45] with anointing and with
[37:49] power that's what I
[37:52] believe I believe the crown of any life
[37:55] is the spirit of God
[37:57] I believe the crown of any Ministry is
[37:59] not how well you can put the word
[38:01] together it's what happens when the word
[38:02] comes does the spirit of God back up
[38:05] what's being said that's what I want to
[38:07] brother mam said the spirit of God ought
[38:09] to be with every Minister that ministers
[38:11] there ought to be something behind it
[38:13] not just a man saying something there
[38:15] ought to be a life behind it there ought
[38:17] to be a changing power on the inside of
[38:21] it well I might as well just go ahead
[38:24] and preach since I'm this far in right
[38:28] sometimes we go to preach and the spirit
[38:30] of God Falls amen the power of God
[38:32] changes lives and hearts and it's an
[38:34] anointing it's not a pep rally it's not
[38:37] me trying to draw somebody to myself
[38:39] it's the releasing of the anointing of
[38:42] God and it's designed for the end time
[38:45] to strengthen this bride it's not for me
[38:48] it's not for the church it's for the
[38:50] people who's going their God to get
[38:52] strength out of that message until the
[38:55] power of God would fall into the room
[38:58] man heard me one time and they couldn't
[39:00] explain they couldn't explain away the
[39:02] spirit moving so they decided I had a
[39:04] familiar Spirit they they tried to make
[39:06] it something bad since they can't make
[39:08] since they can't say that something
[39:10] don't happen when I preach they try to
[39:12] make it something bad happening when I
[39:14] preach I bet I tell you what happens
[39:16] this is what happened I was a hilly amen
[39:19] without Education Without ability no
[39:22] social upbringing didn't know how to use
[39:24] my knife and my Fork Heen embarrassed in
[39:26] crowds with people with money cuz I
[39:28] didn't understand the social part of
[39:30] life don't know politics don't know how
[39:31] to get along with people amen but I met
[39:34] a god one night at an altar and with a
[39:36] burning light he came into my heart and
[39:39] identified me as a son of the Living God
[39:43] and before I knew what Matthew was or
[39:45] what Mark was or what the Book of
[39:47] Revelation was there was a gene ignited
[39:50] on the inside of me that identified me
[39:52] as a son of the Living God and nobody
[39:55] can take that away from me me and the
[39:58] God my father called me into the
[40:01] ministry to preach the word to his
[40:03] people and by that Commission of the
[40:06] spirit of God that's the reason he
[40:08] people are healed that's the reason
[40:10] people are saved that's the reason the
[40:12] anointing comes because if I had my way
[40:14] about it I would go hunting somewhere
[40:17] I'd go run a dozer somewhere but the god
[40:20] that birth me is the god that called me
[40:23] and I have no choice but to yield my
[40:25] spirit
[40:29] you said preacher what are you doing I'm
[40:31] telling you that's me that's me as a
[40:34] preacher but what about you as a
[40:35] Believer don't you have the same
[40:37] Authority as a Believer if you're in
[40:39] your position the same way I'm in my

[40:46] the atmosphere of a room you're at come
[40:49] on now talk to me had it right she
[40:52] changed everything in the room she
[40:54] changed the atmosphere in the room and
[40:57] because of one amen she was a woman in
[41:01] her position with God and she opened up
[41:03] the anointing in the room and you in
[41:06] your position have an ability to open up
[41:08] a channel an anointing to come in this
[41:11] building tonight you ain't got to be
[41:13] somebody special you are special before

[41:21] you may not be the boisterous type like
[41:23] we are jump up and holler amen and Shout
[41:25] amen I'm I I have to be honest
[41:27] I think we ought to have freedom to do
[41:29] it but I don't think you have to do it I
[41:31] think what you have to do is yield your
[41:33] spirit and let the Holy Ghost use you
[41:35] and if a Qui amen it means as much as my
[41:38] yelling in heaven because it's a pull of
[41:41] Faith it's a cry of faith it ain't how
[41:43] loud we are it's how powerful we are and
[41:47] you're the most powerful force on the
[41:49] face of the
[41:54] Earth glory to God somebody better open
[41:57] up the door let the devil out of this
[41:59] place tonight I don't think it's healthy
[42:01] for him to be in here amen there's a
[42:03] church that's on fire that come from the
[42:06] Bible we are not a bunch of crazy people
[42:09] we are a Bible believing Holy Ghost
[42:12] Field church I'm the Living God saying
[42:14] God if there ain't nobody left we're
[42:16] here tonight to yield to the
[42:20] anointing to yield to the spirit of God
[42:24] because the Bible prophesies Jesus
[42:27] the Bible says you'll do
[42:32] it I'm not I'm not
[42:36] insane this is the
[42:38] Bible the Bible said Abraham being not
[42:42] weak in faith there it is him not being
[42:46] weak in faith he considered not his own
[42:49] body at a 100 years old neither would he
[42:53] consider the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[42:56] wouldn't talk about none of
[42:58] it you know why that Abraham was not
[43:01] weak because he had met somebody that
[43:04] had given
[43:06] strength he didn't know if it was 25
[43:08] years or 50 years or however long he met
[43:11] somebody that had give him strength
[43:13] strength to believe the Bible said he
[43:15] did not stagger at the promise of God
[43:18] through unbelief now his promise was the
[43:20] changeing of his body you've got promise
[43:23] of the Holy Ghost you've got promise of
[43:25] every Covenant promise and benefit in
[43:27] the message look at this the Redemptive
[43:29] rights that God has given the church
[43:31] they're a promise to you it's not your
[43:34] wishful thinking it's not your hopeful
[43:36] thinking it is a promise of the God who
[43:38] can't lie who has made this Covenant to
[43:41] the church and I will not stagger at the
[43:44] promises of God through unbelief but the
[43:47] Bible said he was strong he was strong
[43:51] amen and giving glory to God and I
[43:53] believe tonight I'm preaching to a
[43:55] church that is not we in faith we are
[43:58] not a bunch of weak Believers that can't
[44:00] handle the message we can handle the son
[44:02] of man we can handle the Third Exodus
[44:05] you can handle Rapture and things that
[44:07] are to be because we are not a premature
[44:10] bride we are not a presuming bride we
[44:12] are not an infant bride we are a mature
[44:15] bride in the presence of An Almighty God
[44:18] we know who we are we know the position
[44:21] we hold and we know every promise that
[44:23] God has made to us and we're not backing
[44:25] up on one of them
[44:28] [Music]
[44:30] oh no sir she was strong Abraham was
[44:34] strong and you know what this church is
[44:36] it's strong amen amen to the Bible said
[44:40] he was not weak it actually means to be
[44:43] weak is to be feeble to be without
[44:45] strength to be
[44:48] powerless you're not feeble you're not
[44:51] without strength and you're certainly
[44:53] not
[44:55] powerless but on the opposite Amen to be
[44:59] strong is to be endured with strength is
[45:02] to be strengthened to receive strength
[45:05] to have an increase of strength to
[45:08] receive strength you're not going offer
[45:12] your strength we have received we have
[45:15] received strength you say where're in is
[45:17] we receive strength is amazine that
[45:20] almighty God appeared unto Abraham in
[45:22] Genesis the 17th chapter it was the
[45:25] almighty god brother bam said the breath
[45:26] Ed elhad appeared to Abraham and he said
[45:30] he was breasted showing that God was
[45:33] giving access to his life he was
[45:36] inviting Abraham to the life of Elohim
[45:39] but he was doing it through the breast
[45:41] of elhi he was allowing him the strength
[45:44] of God through the breast of promise and
[45:47] brother B is teaching the church at our
[45:50] Eli is Jesus Christ and when he give his
[45:53] word you see it's like a mother who who
[45:57] reveals her breast to her baby the life
[46:00] becomes accessible through the milk are
[46:02] you hearing me and the life of God
[46:05] becomes accessible by the message of the
[46:07] hour in your generation amen and God has
[46:10] made an appropriation or an
[46:13] accessibility to the life of God when
[46:16] when Abraham latched onto the breath of
[46:18] eladia he brought strength into his body
[46:21] and he was being strengthened for the
[46:24] promise that Elohim made so Elohim him
[46:27] uses El Shadi to bring strength to
[46:30] fulfill the promises that he has
[46:34] made the almighty god brother BR says
[46:37] the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost elhi
[46:41] is your Holy Ghost it brings the
[46:44] strength of the promises of God into
[46:46] your life that's the way that God gets
[46:48] strength into the church is through his
[46:50] life Source now it's amazing because
[46:52] somebody would say brother Wayne what's
[46:53] different today than used to be well in
[46:56] Revelations the chapter the Bible say in
[46:58] the same season that Daniel prophesies
[47:01] the church will be strong the Bible says
[47:04] in Revelations 10 that a mighty angel
[47:06] will descend Out of
[47:08] Heaven A Mighty Angel is a strong Angel
[47:13] a strong Angel shall come out of Heaven
[47:17] one who is clothed with a rainbow he has
[47:19] the Covenant it's not a covenant in his
[47:22] weakness it's a covenant in his strength
[47:25] he's bringing all of the Promises of God
[47:27] with him we don't have time to go
[47:29] through them but watch them seven Church
[47:31] ages watch how the rainbow lays over the
[47:34] pyramid and a color represents virtue
[47:36] and a color represents Temperance and a
[47:38] color represents godliness but when you
[47:40] come to the Capstone it's not one color
[47:43] of the rainbow it's the entire rainbow
[47:46] coming to the church a collection of
[47:49] everything that God has been in the days
[47:52] of the church ages he is coming now as a
[47:54] crown he's capping theur Church off in
[47:57] the person of the Holy Ghost the Lord
[48:01] himself shall be the crown of the Church
[48:03] of the Living God it'll be the very
[48:05] person the very Perfection of the word
[48:08] of God that will come and Crown I know
[48:10] it's been said in the book of Isaiah
[48:13] amen they that wait upon the
[48:15] Lord you know the rest of it they shall
[48:18] renew their
[48:22] strength sure they will renew their
[48:24] strength they'll Mount up with wings say
[48:27] Eagles and they shall run and not be
[48:29] weary they will walk and they will not
[48:32] faint look what they done they waited on
[48:35] the Lord those that wait on the Lord do
[48:38] you see they meant other ages have tried
[48:40] this but they were in front of God and
[48:44] they and as Moses went in head of God
[48:46] down in Egypt and killed one man trying
[48:49] to fulfill the exploits that Abraham had
[48:52] prophesied he failed in his commission
[48:55] and was sent to the back side of the
[48:57] desert wondering if the promises were
[48:59] even true because he didn't wait on the
[49:01] Lord he got ahead of God but when God
[49:05] met him in a pillar of fire the
[49:07] anointing of that fire gave to Moses
[49:09] what he lacked in the beginning he
[49:12] received the attributes of Elohim
[49:15] through the Vindicated word of his age
[49:18] and he saw God face to face and the
[49:21] minute he saw God he went he went into
[49:24] action he went to doing what God Said he
[49:26] was supposed to do and even argue with
[49:29] the Lord about the ability to do
[49:31] it I can't do it lord I can't do what
[49:34] you've called me to do I can't fulfill
[49:36] the commission that you gave 400 years
[49:39] ago I've tried it and I've tried it and
[49:41] I've tried it and amen oh God if you
[49:44] ever be a tri amen you'll begin to
[49:46] wonder if these promises are ever true
[49:48] but they that wait upon the
[49:52] Lord oh when that Holy Ghost strength
[49:55] comes it's a different kind of strength
[49:58] now some people amen they put the coming
[50:00] of the Lord off so far in the future I
[50:02] don't know if the church will ever get
[50:03] any
[50:06] strength come on Church they put all the
[50:09] healing in the Millennium they put all
[50:11] the Miracles in the Millennium they put
[50:13] the spoken word in the Millennium well
[50:15] let me ask you what are we going to need
[50:17] with miracles in the Millennium come on
[50:19] what are we going to need with the
[50:20] spoken word that can put a bone back in
[50:22] a woman's foot correctly what are we
[50:24] going to need with that in the in the
[50:26] millennium we need that now we need
[50:28] people of God engaged with the strength
[50:30] of the Holy Ghost now that's why I
[50:32] preach the promises of God that's how
[50:35] the strength comes into the
[50:39] church they that wait upon the Lord now
[50:41] I know they put this so far out in the
[50:44] future that we ain't never going to
[50:46] become a strong Church a mighty church
[50:49] amen I I keep asking the question if not
[50:52] now could you tell me
[50:54] when well brother wne they that waited
[50:56] upon the Lord I love that scripture
[50:58] they'll not faint in 2 Corinthians 4:1
[51:01] Paul said therefore see and we have this
[51:03] ministry we have receiv received mercy
[51:05] and we faint not we have received this
[51:08] ministry what Ministry has the church
[51:10] received in this hour they have received
[51:12] a a Ministry that Paul said that was
[51:15] manifestly declared Paul did not come
[51:18] with enticing words of man's wisdoms but
[51:21] Paul came amen and brought forth the
[51:24] church in power and demonstration we
[51:26] bram's Ministry amen is a repeat of
[51:29] Paul's Ministry amen bringing the church
[51:32] in the ministry of Declaration among the
[51:35] church if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[51:39] them that are lost William Brandon
[51:41] declared the presence of Jesus Christ in
[51:45] this age without one Shadow of Doubt
[51:48] there should be not one doubt in the
[51:50] church tonight you said brother Wayne
[51:52] someday our strength's going to come let
[51:54] me let me propose something to you in re
[51:56] aans the 12th chapter the Bible said I
[51:58] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying now is
[52:01] come salvation and strength and the
[52:04] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[52:06] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[52:09] has been cast down which accused them
[52:11] before God day and night and they the
[52:13] people overcame him by the blood of the
[52:16] lamb and the word of their testimony
[52:19] they loveed not their lives unto death I
[52:22] say to you now is come the strength of
[52:25] the Bride now is come the Salvation to
[52:28] the right you said brother Wayne how you
[52:29] placing it now cuz the strong one
[52:32] brought a book in his hand and he opened
[52:35] that book and revealed the names of the
[52:37] people who were to be in the Rapture in
[52:39] the last days your strength to survive
[52:42] the Antichrist is your name is in the
[52:44] Lamb's Book of Life your strength cannot
[52:47] be deceived as a genan seed of the
[52:50] inside of you that can only receive the
[52:52] Holy Ghost
[52:56] now there's some reason you couldn't
[52:58] swallow all that intellectual
[53:00] nonsense because the seed inside you
[53:03] couldn't be satisfied in that portion
[53:06] but something in you kept calling and
[53:09] and John said now is come strength and
[53:13] now is come salvation when the accuser
[53:16] has been cast out what of the place
[53:18] Satan has been in your place since the
[53:20] fall he stood in your position in a
[53:23] Heavenly place and has claimed you have
[53:26] no rights to it he has claimed you have
[53:29] no hold or no claim on the covenants of
[53:32] God but the message of the hour came the
[53:35] Bible said there is no more place found
[53:37] for that devil what happened God opened
[53:40] up the book and he showed that the devil
[53:42] had no place in your life whatever he's
[53:46] done he had to do because he cannot go
[53:49] into eternity with the Church of the
[53:51] Living God I love to tell the devil all
[53:53] the time you can't change in time what
[53:56] God God done in
[53:58] eternity he said I'll change your
[54:00] destination I'll do this and I'll do
[54:02] this he don't have the power to do it he
[54:04] don't have the power to change your life
[54:07] he don't have the power to defeat you he
[54:09] don't have the power to send you to Hell
[54:12] the first seal revealed it he's a BL
[54:15] he's a defeated being God gave him no
[54:18] strength but the strength tonight lays
[54:21] in the hand of every believer of God
[54:25] tonight my
[54:28] Lord me tell you where the devil hitting
[54:30] you at let me tell you where he's
[54:32] hitting you at he talks you into robing
[54:33] a bank then cause a law on you he he's
[54:36] he's I don't have a better way to say
[54:38] this but he's piling around in your
[54:40] thought life and he's getting you to
[54:42] think a wrong thought and then
[54:43] condemning you for that thought and
[54:45] saying to you there's no way to repent
[54:47] of something you never even did you only
[54:48] thought of and he was the one that gave
[54:50] you the thought so because you know the
[54:52] Lord he'll say to you you can't even
[54:54] repent now he says it's impossible to
[54:57] ever really make it right with God but
[54:59] do you know what impossible means it
[55:01] means there's no space impossible means
[55:03] there's no way to fit it in but
[55:05] something that's possible means there's
[55:07] a space or a place it's probable it's
[55:10] possible listen now what is impossible
[55:13] is that the devil in his time or in his
[55:16] attribute could add one sin to the name
[55:20] on the Lamb's Book of Life because there
[55:22] is no space in that book for a sin it is
[55:26] impossible to add sin to the name of a
[55:30] Believer I tell you what you ought to do
[55:31] tonight you ought to tell that devil I
[55:34] am a blood bought son of the Living God
[55:37] I'm an anointed child of God by the
[55:39] power of the Holy Ghost and you will not
[55:42] affect
[55:45] me my strength comes from the Lord my
[55:49] strength comes from Revelation my
[55:52] strength to
[55:54] stand come on Church
[55:57] I'm not a supernatural being how do I
[55:59] withstand demons in the prayer
[56:02] line tell you how you do it young man I
[56:04] don't care what devil he is he has to
[56:06] recognize the name of Jesus Christ every
[56:09] knee will bow at that name I don't care
[56:12] how big the devil I don't care the name
[56:14] of the devil my Bible said he's a name
[56:17] that is highly exalted he has been
[56:19] exalted above every name he has been
[56:21] exalted above every sickness every devil
[56:24] every disease every thought all you got
[56:26] to do is cry the name of Jesus Christ
[56:30] and stand behind the blood Covenant of
[56:32] the lamb and every demon will have to
[56:35] bow every Power will be
[56:37] broken see now has come salvation when
[56:41] that book is open you tells H the devil
[56:43] you ain't got no place for
[56:50] Satan there a song Somebody sent me some
[56:53] time ago I don't know if you don't like
[56:55] that style of music you might think of
[56:56] I'm a little odd but it's a black
[56:58] brother he's singing it's a real good
[56:59] tune he said don't you let that devil
[57:02] don't you let the devil ride in your
[57:05] car he's saying he said Don't Let The
[57:07] Devil Ride don't you let the devil ride
[57:10] and in a minute he'll say don't you let
[57:12] him ride cuz he'll want to
[57:14] drive don't you let him ride cuz he
[57:16] going to want to drive Satan going to
[57:18] want to drive the car but there's a
[57:20] church tonight says you're not in the
[57:21] driver's seat of this car matter of fact
[57:24] you ought to stop the car and let him
[57:25] out tonight you ought to stop the car
[57:28] right now open the door and say get out
[57:31] of here Satan you don't have a place in
[57:34] the church you don't have a place in the
[57:36] family you don't have a place in my car
[57:38] you don't have a place in my life it's
[57:41] time for the Church of the Living God to
[57:44] remember who they are in your thoughts
[57:47] and in your heart and in your prayer and
[57:49] in your church we are not begging
[57:51] something we are not backing up to
[57:53] something you are worthy by the blood of
[57:57] Jesus Christ Thou Art Worthy you're not
[58:00] a bunch of Orphans you're the sons and
[58:04] daughters I know they tried to make us a

[58:34] want you angels to come watch something
[58:36] this
[58:37] morning and they started emptying the
[58:39] corridors of Heaven and the angels of
[58:41] God started circling the building
[58:43] watching these young ladies dance in the
[58:45] spirit watching the spirit of God begin
[58:47] to move through the church on the
[58:49] atmosphere of faith and anointing and
[58:51] reality listen friends I believe this is
[58:54] the Church of the Living God that feels
[58:56] the attributes of the experience of God
[58:59] and and and and and we won't limit this
[59:02] we don't limit this to emotion and just
[59:04] a feeling but it's a change it's a
[59:08] change and it's moving over our lives
[59:11] it's moving over our hearts amen it's a
[59:15] change now has come strength now has
[59:19] come honor said preacher why would you
[59:21] say now cuz now the Messiah is
[59:24] here right now the Messiah is here he's

[59:31] you say that we have seen his son as our
[59:36] musicians would come
[59:38] tonight what an hour to
[59:41] live what a
[59:45] time never been no day like this
[59:49] one you flip through your pages of your
[59:51] Bible and wished you was in another day
[59:52] but you do me a favor when you're
[59:55] done you list all the Miracles done in
[59:57] the book of Acts and then you come talk
[1:00:00] to me about this ministry of William
[1:00:03] Bram in one meeting there was more done
[1:00:06] in that meeting than there was in the
[1:00:08] entire book of
[1:00:10] Acts why so you'd know him that's
[1:00:14] right God revealed it to strengthen
[1:00:19] you for them that stand in the
[1:00:24] gate I will be their
[1:00:28] strength I'm glad he is tonight I'm glad
[1:00:31] the promise is laying
[1:00:33] there I was listening to the Eagle St at
[1:00:35] this Nest I've been doing a little Dozer
[1:00:36] work and listening to a lot of a prophet
[1:00:41] and brother Bram said he seen that old
[1:00:44] Eagle down in the
[1:00:46] blowdown he said I looked over there he
[1:00:48] said he wasn't a bit a bit scared of
[1:00:52] me he said Lord what are you trying to
[1:00:54] show me in that eagle he said them Wings
[1:00:57] was his gifts they were god-given and he
[1:01:01] knew that he could trust them Wings to
[1:01:04] get him out of the the danger of that
[1:01:06] man he said see it's telling you should
[1:01:10] lose your fear if it's god-given
[1:01:13] I don't believe we had to fear a
[1:01:15] god-given
[1:01:17] gift if God's anointed a man to preach I
[1:01:20] believe you ought to just let the

[1:04:29] from the Bible said he was mending the
[1:04:32] breach and he was taking the the word up
[1:04:35] to Jerusalem the city of
[1:04:38] David they were killing an oxen every
[1:04:41] six
[1:04:44] steps
[1:04:45] blood killing an oxen every six
[1:04:48] steps now if you sometimes want to know
[1:04:50] about worship worship is always it's not
[1:04:53] always maybe a jump maybe not always
[1:04:57] just a a loud joyful
[1:05:00] feeling but in that moment
[1:05:03] David was both dancing and
[1:05:07] killing sometimes worship is killing
[1:05:13] something and sometimes that those
[1:05:16] things that are there in your
[1:05:18] life is preventing you from letting that
[1:05:22] word come rich and pure
[1:05:27] sometimes we need to kill some
