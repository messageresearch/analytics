[28:03] happening
[28:05] the transforming power of god

[28:10] that this is that
[28:12] which was prophesied of a bride that

[1:11:38] but lord your word said you're going to
[1:11:40] surround us with songs of deliverance
[1:11:43] let deliverance arise in our hearts
[1:11:45] today we pray
[1:11:47] commit this time into your hands
[1:11:50] in jesus name
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:54] amen how many can say praise the lord
[1:11:58] amen turn in your bibles to psalms
[1:12:01] chapter 40 and also isaiah 61.
[1:12:09] i'm actually
[1:12:11] sharing something with you that's very
[1:12:13] close to me this morning because
[1:12:15] as i was sitting in in the service for
[1:12:17] the memorial service of my mom
[1:12:20] the lord would drop this thought into my
[1:12:21] heart for this service
[1:12:24] amen and i just
[1:12:25] pray the lord to help me this morning to
[1:12:27] deliver
[1:12:28] psalms 40 and verse 1
[1:12:30] i waited patiently for the lord
[1:12:33] and he inclined unto me and heard my cry
[1:12:38] he brought me up out of a horrible pit
[1:12:41] out of the mirey clay and he set my feet
[1:12:44] upon a rock
[1:12:45] and established my goings
[1:12:48] and he hath put a new song in my mouth
[1:12:51] even praise unto our god
[1:12:53] many shall see it
[1:12:55] and fear
[1:12:56] and shall trust
[1:12:58] in the lord
[1:13:00] amen isaiah 61 and verse 1.
[1:13:04] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[1:13:07] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:13:09] preach good tidings unto the meek
[1:13:11] he has sent me to bind up the
[1:13:13] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[1:13:16] captives and the opening of the prisons
[1:13:19] of them that are bound
[1:13:21] them that are bound to proclaim the
[1:13:22] acceptable year of the lord or the
[1:13:25] jubilee
[1:13:26] and the day of vengeance of our god to
[1:13:29] comfort
[1:13:30] all that mourn to point unto them that
[1:13:33] mourn in zion to give unto them beauty
[1:13:36] for ashes
[1:13:37] the oil of joy for mourning the garment
[1:13:40] of praise for the spirit of heaviness
[1:13:43] that they might be called the trees of
[1:13:45] righteousness
[1:13:46] the planting of the lord
[1:13:49] that he might be glorified
[1:13:53] amen god bless you
[1:13:54] you can be seated this morning
[1:14:00] i'd like to speak to you on a new song
[1:14:02] to sing
[1:14:05] a new song to sing
[1:14:08] amen you know
[1:14:11] as we look in the scripture here david
[1:14:14] knew what it was like to be in some low
[1:14:16] places
[1:14:18] you could read as read as the history of
[1:14:20] him as he would go through life's
[1:14:22] journey he'd find himself in caves he
[1:14:24] would find himself in hiding he would
[1:14:26] find himself even after he became king
[1:14:28] to be a rejected king
[1:14:30] he knew what it's like to be in a
[1:14:32] horrible pit
[1:14:34] and mary clay you know there's something
[1:14:36] that he seemed like he couldn't get out
[1:14:37] of on his own
[1:14:39] and but god came on the scene many times
[1:14:42] for david and he would take him and take
[1:14:44] him out of those situations in the
[1:14:46] miraculous ways we could you know we
[1:14:48] could read about it and and it's been
[1:14:50] mentioned here this weekend already of
[1:14:52] zig lag where he would go and he would
[1:14:55] come back and he'd find us
[1:14:57] that ziglag was burned and women as
[1:14:59] women were taken captive and
[1:15:02] and david and his men
[1:15:04] you know came to the city and it was
[1:15:05] their wives were gone their sons and
[1:15:07] their daughters were gone and david and
[1:15:10] the people that were with with him
[1:15:11] lifted up their voices and wept until
[1:15:14] they had no power to weep
[1:15:16] so he knew what it was like to cry he
[1:15:18] knew what it was like to be in a
[1:15:19] depressed situation or or under a spirit
[1:15:23] of heaviness and that and to be honest
[1:15:25] with you that's a real prevalent spirit
[1:15:27] in the age that we live in it's a spirit
[1:15:29] of heaviness it's a spirit of it's also
[1:15:32] in that as a spirit of anxiety and fear
[1:15:35] i mean i these brothers up here could
[1:15:37] testify of how many that comes into up
[1:15:40] for prayer for anxiety and fear it's a
[1:15:42] prevalent a spirit in the age that we're
[1:15:44] living in but there's something that's
[1:15:46] greater than that spirit
[1:15:49] amen and david would find himself in
[1:15:52] this moment and even even where you know
[1:15:54] his own men would turn against him and
[1:15:56] think of stone in him and and here the
[1:15:58] scripture would say david was greatly
[1:16:00] distressed for the people spake of stone
[1:16:03] in him because the soul of all the
[1:16:05] people was so grieved every man for his
[1:16:08] sons and for his daughters but
[1:16:10] david encouraged himself in the lord his
[1:16:13] god
[1:16:15] amen i want you to understand there's
[1:16:16] only one place to find true
[1:16:18] encouragement it's not on facebook it's
[1:16:21] not on some social media you know
[1:16:23] somebody likes your pages enough or
[1:16:25] somebody that's not true encouragement
[1:16:27] but what's true encouragement is this
[1:16:29] word of god now we're not going to get
[1:16:31] up here and try to tell you that you're
[1:16:32] going to go home and there's not going
[1:16:33] to be no more devil there's not going to
[1:16:35] be no more mind battles there's not
[1:16:37] going to be any more spirits that comes
[1:16:39] against you amen they're going to be
[1:16:41] here until the end amen we're going to
[1:16:43] face these things you're going to go
[1:16:44] home and there's going to be that same
[1:16:46] devil there you're going to go home
[1:16:48] they're going to be that same spirit
[1:16:49] that tries to come you're going to go
[1:16:51] home and there's going to be those
[1:16:52] things around you but there's going to
[1:16:54] you're going to go home and there's a
[1:16:55] different spirit on the inside of you
[1:16:58] amen where you will not no longer look
[1:17:00] for temporary things to bring temporary
[1:17:03] pleasures or temporary happiness or
[1:17:05] temporary joy that's not what we're
[1:17:07] looking at we're looking for eternal
[1:17:09] happiness and eternal joy and that can
[1:17:11] only be found in something that is
[1:17:14] eternal amen and so david encouraged
[1:17:16] himself in the lord his god and you know
[1:17:19] what brother bannon would say even in 56
[1:17:22] he would say many are becoming
[1:17:24] discouraged he said you know when we
[1:17:26] become discouraged it takes our strength
[1:17:29] from us it takes our ability to fight
[1:17:31] you know we just want to give up we you
[1:17:33] know satan pulls you away and he'll try
[1:17:35] that when you get home and begin you
[1:17:37] begin to think that nobody cares and
[1:17:40] nobody understands and nobody's worried
[1:17:42] about your situation he said but what we
[1:17:44] need to do is take courage
[1:17:47] we need to be encouraged trials may come
[1:17:49] he said we've never ever promised to be
[1:17:52] immune from trials but he promised he
[1:17:54] would give you the grace to go through
[1:17:56] the trial amen if the mountain's too
[1:17:59] high if the door is too deep or too wide
[1:18:01] he will give you the grace to go through
[1:18:03] it don't worry keep your eyes on christ
[1:18:06] for he's the only one
[1:18:09] he's the only one that can take you
[1:18:11] through so when you're discouraged
[1:18:13] that's when the devil tries to really
[1:18:15] pour it upon you and when it's when he
[1:18:17] tries to get you if you can come to
[1:18:19] church and say well i don't know i don't
[1:18:21] know if i'll get any better i don't know
[1:18:23] if i i've been prayed for and i still
[1:18:25] got this issue he said don't be
[1:18:27] discouraged encourage yourself in the
[1:18:30] lord your god amen because god is there
[1:18:33] to fight your battles
[1:18:36] i want you to understand children of god
[1:18:38] you're not standing alone
[1:18:40] the devil may try to tell you you're
[1:18:42] standing alone until you're all by
[1:18:44] yourself but there's a greater host
[1:18:46] that's here among us than the number
[1:18:48] that are here with us that we can see
[1:18:50] with our visible eye there's angels of
[1:18:52] god chariots of fire the power of god
[1:18:55] the holy spirit that is moving in his
[1:18:57] people leading us on to the promised
[1:18:59] land we're not in this battle alone
[1:19:02] we're not fighting alone we're not by
[1:19:04] ourself it's not just me and somebody
[1:19:07] else but god is with me god is with you
[1:19:10] he'll go on the bus with you he'll get
[1:19:13] in the car with you he'll be in your
[1:19:15] room when you get home this god will
[1:19:17] never leave you this god will never
[1:19:19] forsake you amen this god is here for
[1:19:22] you in the worst trials of your life

[1:19:29] through with you through the darkest
[1:19:31] moments of your life
[1:19:34] and he will give you a song for the
[1:19:36] battle
[1:19:40] hallelujah he said god doesn't want you
[1:19:42] to be frowning
[1:19:48] amen you know it was something this
[1:19:49] young person always stuck with me
[1:19:51] brother john lafontaine would always say
[1:19:53] this he said are you happy
[1:19:56] and notify your face
[1:20:01] amen
[1:20:03] mean god wants you to be happy
[1:20:05] the human heart was made to be happy
[1:20:08] worry will cause cancer
[1:20:11] temper will cause cancer
[1:20:13] don't ever be upset just walk with god
[1:20:16] knowing that you're walking with him
[1:20:18] nothing can harm you
[1:20:21] as long as you're with him nothing can
[1:20:24] harm you
[1:20:25] hallelujah i'm glad i'm with him
[1:20:28] i'm not just with a preacher i'm not
[1:20:30] just here because i'm a preacher's son

[1:20:59] through every mind battle through every
[1:21:02] situation in your life there is a power

[1:24:55] discouraged we're living in a terrible
[1:24:58] hour
[1:25:00] that's enough to be discouraged about
[1:25:03] a terrible hour for the unbeliever
[1:25:07] but a wonderful hour for the believer
[1:25:12] because we are near the end
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:19] we're looking for the coming of our
[1:25:21] blessed lord jesus christ
[1:25:24] it's like i told my sisters or as we
[1:25:26] stood around the bedside of my mom i
[1:25:28] said we are the lucky ones because we
[1:25:31] don't have it just a few moments
[1:25:34] we ain't got 60 years i don't believe we
[1:25:36] ain't got 20 years 10 years five years i
[1:25:39] believe in just any moment
[1:25:42] we're the lucky ones we're right here at
[1:25:44] the last time i believe there's gonna be
[1:25:46] a funeral one day when they put that
[1:25:48] seed in the ground it's gonna pop right
[1:25:50] back up and say it's time to go home i
[1:25:54] believe that's how close we are
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:26:00] hallelujah but god will give you a soul
[1:26:04] god will give you a rejoicing in your
[1:26:07] heart that you can take back from this
[1:26:09] camp
[1:26:16] god gave me a song
[1:26:20] i'd be a brother ron spencer's
[1:26:24] and i would be ministering on a on god
[1:26:27] answer that god did answers
[1:26:30] you know my mom was
[1:26:31] had just come out of the hospital and
[1:26:33] she's having a hard time with things we
[1:26:36] didn't really let all out what was
[1:26:37] happening
[1:26:39] just asking for prayer
[1:26:42] and i'm ministering on the god that
[1:26:44] answers how he answers an unexpected
[1:26:46] time an unexpected place in an
[1:26:47] unexpected way and i get down to the end
[1:26:50] of it and i walk out in front of brother
[1:26:51] ron's pulpit
[1:26:52] and i walk away from my ipad that's
[1:26:54] laying there
[1:26:55] and i begin to talk about the three
[1:26:57] hubert children how they come down into
[1:26:58] the moment their last step into the fire
[1:27:02] brother brown said brother brown said
[1:27:03] when gabriel come to
[1:27:05] god said have you been watching down
[1:27:06] there he said yeah i've been watching
[1:27:09] he's i've been seeing what's going on
[1:27:12] he said i've been watching it all take
[1:27:14] place
[1:27:15] gabriel said well i got my sword drawn
[1:27:17] send me down there
[1:27:18] he said no no no
[1:27:19] you've been a good angel
[1:27:21] and wormwood come and he said i'm the
[1:27:23] i'm the angel over the floods i'll put
[1:27:25] the fire out and he said no no y'all
[1:27:27] been good angels he said but this ain't
[1:27:28] your job this is my
[1:27:30] job and he said he took off those robes
[1:27:33] and he laid him down and he grabbed the
[1:27:35] east and the west wind and he grabbed a
[1:27:37] zigzag of light and as they took their
[1:27:39] last step into the fire sometimes he'll
[1:27:41] let you get there
[1:27:44] they got to their last step in the fire
[1:27:47] and all of a sudden there was not three
[1:27:49] men in there there was four men in there
[1:27:54] and as i'm telling that my eye my ipad
[1:27:58] laying on the pulpit begins to switch
[1:28:00] over out of my notes onto an app onto
[1:28:03] the message and picks out a message and
[1:28:05] pushes play
[1:28:09] in the middle of 56 brother brad was
[1:28:11] preaching the sermon the worst center in
[1:28:12] the city and at the very beginning he
[1:28:14] begins to speak i'm standing here and i
[1:28:17] hear a voice and i'm like what's going
[1:28:18] on i'm looking around it was an
[1:28:20] unexpected place an unexpected time in
[1:28:22] an unexpected way
[1:28:25] and the voice begins to speak instead of
[1:28:27] something that is my favorite of the
[1:28:29] hymns
[1:28:31] he said because it expresses his extreme
[1:28:34] deity especially in the hour that we're
[1:28:37] living in he said people wants to make
[1:28:39] him just a prophet but he's more than a
[1:28:42] prophet he's god
[1:28:46] that him happened to be down from his
[1:28:48] glory
[1:28:51] now in my mind and my hope and my faith
[1:28:54] i'm believing and speaking about my mama
[1:28:57] that she's going to come out and without
[1:28:59] a smell of smoke on her and be healed
[1:29:01] she was
[1:29:03] she got the best healing she could ever
[1:29:05] get because she went to a place saying a
[1:29:07] devil in hell can touch her they ain't a
[1:29:08] brain bleed can touch her they ain't a
[1:29:10] devil that can torment her in her mind
[1:29:12] no more his power over her is finished

[1:36:46] you know and that's the truth brothers i
[1:36:48] can't get off of it we get we've been on
[1:36:50] our sisters for a long time do this do
[1:36:52] this
[1:36:53] to be honest with you let me just put it
[1:36:54] this way the message is not a bunch of
[1:36:56] rules and regulations
[1:36:59] the message is a life
[1:37:01] and if you got the life you won't have
[1:37:03] no problem with any kind of thing the
[1:37:05] word says
[1:37:08] but if you don't have the life you'll
[1:37:09] still have makeup if you don't have the
[1:37:11] life you'll still trim your hair if you
[1:37:14] don't have a life you'll still wear them
[1:37:16] tight pants if you don't have the life
[1:37:18] you'll still look like sodom
[1:37:22] if i was you i'd go take those clothes
[1:37:24] and i would burn them
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:30] cause that's not who you are
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:35] let me give you a new song to see i am
[1:37:38] redeemed bought with a price jesus gave
[1:37:42] his whole life for me that's who i am
[1:37:54] david had a decision
[1:37:56] would he go deeper
[1:37:58] worry would he worry more would he be
[1:38:00] distressed more depression more but
[1:38:02] david turns towards encouragement
[1:38:06] not only to be encouraged but there was
[1:38:07] no one around him who could
[1:38:09] or would or did that for him but to
[1:38:11] encourage himself
[1:38:14] hello somebody oh if i could just get a
[1:38:17] text
[1:38:18] if i could just get somebody to like my
[1:38:20] post i'd be encouraged
[1:38:27] who says that friend on facebook really
[1:38:29] is your friend
[1:38:32] the world wants to call them all friends
[1:38:34] they ain't all friends
[1:38:42] but what did david do he turned to the
[1:38:44] word
[1:38:46] he found his encouragement in the lord
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:51] for david had a covenant got with god
[1:38:54] and so david's situation made it god's
[1:38:56] situation
[1:38:59] david's trouble made it god's trouble
[1:39:01] because he had a covenant with god amen
[1:39:04] we'll never get to the solution of our
[1:39:06] problems and the solution of our
[1:39:07] situation until you get your focus off
[1:39:10] of your problem and get it back on your
[1:39:12] god
[1:39:15] too many people are trying to find a
[1:39:17] solution for the church problems and try
[1:39:19] to find a solution for this and they got
[1:39:21] this nag and that thing going over there
[1:39:23] and always got something going on why
[1:39:25] because their focus is not right if they
[1:39:27] would put it on the word of god they
[1:39:29] wouldn't see all the things that's going
[1:39:30] on around them
[1:39:32] and if they did they would pray about it
[1:39:41] the discouragement don't come from the
[1:39:42] lord it comes from my adversary the
[1:39:44] devil
[1:39:46] that's why david could encourage himself
[1:39:48] in the lord anxiety worry fretting
[1:39:50] discouragement indicates we're walking
[1:39:52] by sight and not by faith
[1:39:57] let me read you a couple of things
[1:39:59] brother branham and and discernment
[1:40:01] lines would say let's let us say praise
[1:40:03] be to god oh my that is what we need
[1:40:06] this is the time is this the patient how
[1:40:08] do you do sister you're an awful deep
[1:40:10] thinker got a weary spirit always
[1:40:13] worrying about things you got no
[1:40:15] business to worrying about
[1:40:18] you're nervous upset caused you to have
[1:40:20] acid in your blood which give you
[1:40:22] arthritis the devil did meant no you did
[1:40:25] it
[1:40:31] all right come lady you're a very deep
[1:40:32] thinker you're sincere with all your
[1:40:34] heart but it's caused you to be a
[1:40:35] nervous person you're very nervous
[1:40:37] you're always taking other people's
[1:40:39] problems and thinking about that and
[1:40:41] crossing bridges before you get to it
[1:40:42] building things that never happen
[1:40:45] and it's developed a stomach trouble for
[1:40:46] you
[1:40:49] there's hundreds of them go look them up
[1:40:51] not just women there's men too
[1:40:55] amen
[1:40:56] paul but paul said we walk by faith and
[1:40:58] not by sight so that was his source of
[1:41:01] stability and strength when we walk by
[1:41:03] faith we're putting confidence in our
[1:41:05] god
[1:41:07] not confidence in me but confidence in
[1:41:09] our god when we find ourselves in
[1:41:11] discouragement we need to find out where
[1:41:13] am i going to place my trust
[1:41:17] where am i going to rest at
[1:41:22] well when the circumstances of life
[1:41:24] pressed into david david would press
[1:41:26] into his benefits
[1:41:31] he knew he had some benefits laying in
[1:41:33] there bless the lord o my soul
[1:41:36] and forget not all his benefits who
[1:41:38] forgives all your iniquities who heals
[1:41:41] all your diseases who redeems your life
[1:41:44] from destruction who crowns you with
[1:41:46] loving kindness and tender mercies who
[1:41:48] satisfies your mouth with good things so
[1:41:51] that your youth is renewed like
[1:41:54] eagles so stop giving voice to your
[1:41:56] discouragement
[1:41:59] and start giving voice to the
[1:42:01] encouragement
[1:42:03] stop repeating the lies of the devil and
[1:42:05] start speaking the promises of god
[1:42:08] listen these promises are not for just
[1:42:10] preachers to speak it's for you to speak
[1:42:14] it's for you to put it in your mouth
[1:42:16] your mountain knows your voice
[1:42:28] well brother timothy i don't know about
[1:42:30] all this weekend of meetings and all
[1:42:31] this worked up emotion is that what you
[1:42:33] want to call it
[1:42:37] i'm not sick of that devil
[1:42:40] been hanging around the skirts of the
[1:42:42] message
[1:42:44] hanging around the outward looking
[1:42:46] around seeing if they can find fault and
[1:42:48] failure why don't you go back to your
[1:42:50] denomination
[1:42:52] because you ain't never left it
[1:43:00] amen we we want to this we want to try
[1:43:03] to make it where our kids can't have the
[1:43:05] same experiences
[1:43:07] the same moments with the lord and and
[1:43:10] pull out all of the moving of the spirit
[1:43:12] preach it right preach it right out of
[1:43:13] the pool right out of the church from
[1:43:15] the pulpit
[1:43:18] people today are still suffering from
[1:43:19] things that were said amen against the
[1:43:21] movement of the spirit i mean them
[1:43:23] against the movement of god and they
[1:43:25] don't even know how to react when the
[1:43:26] spirit of god moves to the building
[1:43:30] scared they might be out of order scared
[1:43:32] they might be doing something wrong
[1:43:33] scared scared scared worried word word
[1:43:40] i know there's a cloud that wants to
[1:43:41] hang around you and says you're getting
[1:43:43] a little emotional you're getting a
[1:43:44] little fanatical you're getting
[1:43:46] pentecost
[1:43:49] well i don't know who said this but i
[1:43:50] thought it was pretty good if i'm truly
[1:43:52] azusa street pentecost at least i'm a
[1:43:54] couple of church ages past where you're
[1:43:56] at
[1:43:58] [Applause]
[1:44:03] you want to be a lutheran go ahead and
[1:44:04] be a lutheran you know
[1:44:13] but i know that's not who we are
[1:44:16] because there's a word a revealed word
[1:44:18] in our hour there's a mighty angel in
[1:44:20] our midst
[1:44:22] god himself has come down from his glory
[1:44:25] and been revealed in the people and you
[1:44:27] mean to tell me when the king of kings
[1:44:30] comes in i can't act like they did when
[1:44:33] they were there in the streets of
[1:44:34] jerusalem shouting singing hosanna
[1:44:37] blessed it be the name of the lord
[1:44:39] hosanna
[1:44:43] but you know there were some lutherans
[1:44:44] there too they were called pharisees
[1:44:51] won't you make them shut up
[1:44:54] don't let them sing that song that song
[1:44:56] ain't right
[1:44:59] we've legit legislated the moving of the
[1:45:02] spirit right out of our churches
[1:45:04] and call it god that's not god that's
[1:45:07] the antichrist
[1:45:12] amen because i know
[1:45:13] what this god does
[1:45:15] i know how he changed my life i know
[1:45:18] what he did to that little redheaded boy
[1:45:20] standing a man standing over there when
[1:45:22] he was a redheaded boy and a rascal and
[1:45:24] god chased him forever and stood before
[1:45:26] you last night
[1:45:29] [Applause]
[1:45:31] i know what he did for brother way every
[1:45:33] one of these brothers god come down a
[1:45:35] miraculous way
[1:45:41] are we supposed to sit around and
[1:45:42] twiddle our thumbs
[1:45:45] act like nothing's going on act like the
[1:45:47] king of kings ain't in our midst
[1:45:53] you know we had a camp there for a few
[1:45:55] years a family camp in our our area of
[1:45:58] course we couldn't have meetings in our
[1:45:59] church because it's too small
[1:46:01] and this man is nazarene camp matter of
[1:46:03] fact and this man came and he sat in the
[1:46:05] back of our meetings they had a tomb not
[1:46:07] a tombstone but a marker
[1:46:09] said buddy robinson preached here
[1:46:12] go read buddy robinson's testimony of
[1:46:14] what the what they used to act like
[1:46:18] he said he came there hey i can't even
[1:46:20] remember it go read it
[1:46:23] he said by the time i do remember this
[1:46:25] he said by the time the preacher was
[1:46:26] done preaching and screaming he said i
[1:46:28] thought he was going to scream until the
[1:46:30] tent flaps blew out
[1:46:32] and the trees was going to be laid down
[1:46:34] around he said something got a hold of
[1:46:36] me and something got a hold of another
[1:46:38] man i can't remember buddy robinson or
[1:46:40] this other man one of them skimming up
[1:46:42] the tree that was holding up the tent
[1:46:43] and screaming to the light singing and
[1:46:45] shouting
[1:46:49] yeah because what was happening life was
[1:46:51] passing through the body
[1:47:05] and here this man walks in the back of
[1:47:06] our camp takes in a couple of services
[1:47:09] it's tears streaming down his eyes
[1:47:11] he walks up to brother daryl i believe
[1:47:12] it was one of our deacons
[1:47:14] and he said brother
[1:47:16] he said we used to have services just
[1:47:18] like that
[1:47:21] he said whatever you do
[1:47:23] don't lose that
[1:47:30] ain't that amazing
[1:47:32] a nazarene would say whatever you do
[1:47:34] don't lose that
[1:47:39] a nazarene would say it
[1:47:42] and we got preachers of the message that
[1:47:44] says it ain't right
[1:47:46] so-called preachers of the message
[1:47:50] well i can tell you what david did
[1:47:52] when david saw the word being restored
[1:47:56] coming back in this position and into
[1:47:58] his place
[1:48:00] oh that was that was a good service
[1:48:02] brother priest you preached a good one
[1:48:05] no david got excited
[1:48:08] he got to rejoicing he got to shouting
[1:48:10] he got to having a good time
[1:48:14] got to dancing around that ark because
[1:48:17] he saw it coming back because he knew
[1:48:18] what was with that heart was the
[1:48:19] blessings of god was with that ark
[1:48:23] where the word is the blessings are
[1:48:25] and he got to rejoicing but you do know
[1:48:27] do you realize there was somebody that
[1:48:28] was very close to david david's own wife
[1:48:31] that stood there and criticized
[1:48:34] somebody very close to david
[1:48:38] it wasn't it ain't been the pentecostals
[1:48:41] necessarily or even that nazarene's been
[1:48:43] encouraging us
[1:48:46] but it's those that are close to us
[1:48:48] wants to look in on cameras and and mock
[1:48:50] the very moving of the holy ghost and
[1:48:53] try to put a cloud on you and say it
[1:48:55] ain't so
[1:49:01] but what happened to that her wound was
[1:49:03] sealed
[1:49:06] and she never brought forth fruit
[1:49:11] those that want to criticize the
[1:49:12] movement of god and say it's a bunch of
[1:49:15] fanaticism and call it a dirty name
[1:49:17] pinnacle when when in the world is the
[1:49:19] word pentecost become a dirty word it's
[1:49:22] not a dirty word i it identifies me with
[1:49:25] men on the day of pentecost
[1:49:28] even those men in the zoo's tree was
[1:49:30] really wonderful god called me in
[1:49:32] [Applause]

[1:49:37] original vine the original seed

[1:49:52] their womb is being sealed
[1:49:57] they've taken on the creeds of man

[1:50:51] i know he's been through the fire with
[1:50:53] me i know he's been watching me he's
[1:50:55] been all over me he's been protecting me
[1:51:06] hallelujah
[1:51:08] you know even brother branham found
[1:51:10] himself in that seat there for a moment
[1:51:12] you know the story
[1:51:15] he found himself so i want to say this
[1:51:17] because i'm praying there's hope for
[1:51:18] those that are in this seat
[1:51:21] that they'll find themselves
[1:51:24] and realize what they've been doing
[1:51:26] brother brown said he was teaching on
[1:51:28] some things on the second coming of
[1:51:29] christ
[1:51:30] he said he had a pretty good long
[1:51:31] service about four hours four and a half
[1:51:33] hours
[1:51:34] and he's going to have a little halftime
[1:51:36] he said
[1:51:38] oh boy
[1:51:39] that gets some people nervous
[1:51:45] they were singing a special
[1:51:47] there's some people come from louisville
[1:51:48] and
[1:51:49] four gospel people said they had a
[1:51:51] special
[1:51:52] something some young young ladies wanted
[1:51:54] some little tin cans and things that had
[1:51:56] the washboard some thimbles on it the
[1:51:58] fingers they was playing in this
[1:51:59] washboard so i guess you've seen the
[1:52:01] hookup one was playing was going to play
[1:52:03] the piano and they started playing that
[1:52:05] song
[1:52:06] there is going to be
[1:52:08] a meeting in the air
[1:52:10] in the sweet sweet by and by
[1:52:15] well that's something to get excited
[1:52:16] about
[1:52:21] and this little lady turned real white
[1:52:22] around the mouth and began to beat that
[1:52:24] piano said i believe if they had three
[1:52:27] decks of keys should have played every
[1:52:28] one of them
[1:52:30] so i never seen such playing in my life
[1:52:32] and the lady on that watch board and
[1:52:34] hitting them thimbles little
[1:52:35] blond-headed sister about so high jumped
[1:52:37] out on the floor and started dancing and
[1:52:39] i was sitting there i said oh my here it
[1:52:42] is
[1:52:43] why'd they have to do that
[1:52:47] so i weighed and looked around the
[1:52:48] people and looked up to me and i looked
[1:52:50] around i thought well i'm a
[1:52:51] fundamentalist you couldn't show that to
[1:52:53] me in the bible
[1:52:56] he said there's a whole lot of things
[1:52:57] that us fundamentalists don't even know
[1:52:59] that's in there
[1:53:02] man if a prophet could have that honesty
[1:53:08] he said
[1:53:10] so i looked around i thought well my
[1:53:12] where did dancing ever come from i was
[1:53:14] sitting there in the seat of the
[1:53:15] scornful of course you know
[1:53:20] but listen to this statement not saying
[1:53:22] nothing
[1:53:24] i was afraid to say something because i
[1:53:27] was afraid they might be right and i
[1:53:30] might be wrong
[1:53:35] apparently there's some people that
[1:53:37] ain't afraid of being wrong
[1:53:41] amen but the prophet of god said i was
[1:53:43] afraid because they might be right
[1:53:49] he said now isn't that terrible i
[1:53:51] thought in the next thought though i
[1:53:52] thought well isn't that terrible right
[1:53:53] there in my tabernacle another place
[1:53:55] you'd say they're making my tabernacle
[1:53:56] or a tavern
[1:53:59] so there's a little lady out there just
[1:54:00] their eyes closed dancing around first
[1:54:02] thing you know what another one started
[1:54:04] i thought oh my
[1:54:06] so then i began to rehearse in my mind
[1:54:08] that in the bible they they did dance
[1:54:10] and i thought well when they dance what
[1:54:12] was it
[1:54:13] dancing spoke of when pharaoh was
[1:54:15] pursuing israel and all the enemy was
[1:54:17] drowned and marian picked up a
[1:54:18] tambourine and began to beat that
[1:54:20] tambourine and begin to dance and all
[1:54:22] the daughters of israel followed her
[1:54:24] dance and i thought well
[1:54:26] well they had the victory
[1:54:27] and i read what david when the ark was
[1:54:29] been coming along when he seen it
[1:54:31] returning back he got so happy he
[1:54:33] started dancing what was it he had
[1:54:35] victory
[1:54:36] his sweetheart made fun of him well you
[1:54:38] don't like that watch this and down
[1:54:39] around he went again
[1:54:41] i thought well she sat up there and
[1:54:42] laughed and god put a curse on her
[1:54:47] but he said david is a man after my own
[1:54:49] heart
[1:54:51] and i thought well that's the only thing
[1:54:53] that's the matter with me i just ain't
[1:54:55] got enough dancing or enough victory
[1:54:57] maybe
[1:54:59] he said a few minutes something happened
[1:55:01] he said my methodist foot got the patent
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:13] he said this might shock you but when i
[1:55:15] come to myself i was out there with that
[1:55:18] little girl dancing on the floor
[1:55:20] just the thing i thought i wouldn't do i
[1:55:23] did
[1:55:25] he said i never danced in my life i've
[1:55:28] never been on a dance floor in my life
[1:55:30] but i guess i did all right
[1:55:33] i sure felt awful good because i had a
[1:55:35] lot of victory after that
[1:55:39] you say what's all this dancing being
[1:55:41] around because there's some young people
[1:55:43] that saw depression laying on the floor
[1:55:46] anxiety laying on the floor fear laying
[1:55:48] on the floor every spirit of hell that
[1:55:50] they had been coming in here with
[1:55:53] [Applause]
[1:55:57] but they came into this camp and they
[1:55:58] put on the garment of praise
[1:56:00] [Applause]
[1:56:03] because i seen the king was here and
[1:56:06] they begin to praise the king of kings
[1:56:08] and the lord of lords
[1:56:10] [Applause]
[1:56:13] hallelujah
[1:56:14] there were some daughters of god that
[1:56:16] saw that devil that had tormented him in
[1:56:18] their night watches when he was down in
[1:56:21] the valley when he was all by themselves
[1:56:23] laying there dead
[1:56:30] oh hallelujah if some of you could ever
[1:56:32] see that critical spirit dead it'll put
[1:56:35] a dance in your feet if you could ever
[1:56:37] see that spirit of god moving upon your
[1:56:40] heart there'd be something moving you
[1:56:42] there'd be an amen that would be a shout
[1:56:44] of the king
[1:56:45] [Applause]
[1:56:58] put on the garment of praise
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:03] cast down that spirit of heaviness cast
[1:57:06] down that anxiety and fear and say devil

[1:57:12] mind battles i'm done with the spirits

[2:10:19] deliverance to the place of his death
[2:10:27] i saw demons that were chained they had
[2:10:29] changed themselves to young people but
[2:10:31] it wasn't for that young person
[2:10:32] destruction it was for their deliverance

[2:10:38] with sorrows they walked in with doubts
[2:10:41] they walked in with prayer but all kind
[2:10:43] of things of depression anxiety legalism

[2:11:45] i ain't never seen one
[2:11:49] the daughters of israel following her do

[2:11:58] it's like to live a victorious life
[2:11:59] he'll never know it until he completely
[2:12:01] overcomes who himself
[2:12:04] the biggest enemy you got is yourself
[2:12:07] that's the reason you can't rise up in

[2:12:13] amazing with last night he said the

[2:12:37] oh my we can read in revelations 5 and
[2:12:39] verse 1. i saw a right hand of him that
[2:12:41] sat on the throne a book written therein
[2:12:43] and on the backside seal with seven
[2:12:45] seals this is for you young people
[2:12:48] amen i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[2:12:51] with a loud voice who was worthy to open
[2:12:54] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[2:12:56] and no man in heaven nor earth neither
[2:12:58] under the earth was able to open the
[2:13:00] book neither to look they're wrong and i
[2:13:02] wept much
[2:13:05] because no man was found worthy to open
[2:13:08] and read the book neither looked their
[2:13:09] own but one of the elders said we've not
[2:13:12] john
[2:13:13] we've not behold the lion of the tribe
[2:13:16] of judah the root of david have prepared
[2:13:18] prevailed to open the book and the loose
[2:13:21] the seals thereof and i'll be held and
[2:13:24] though in the midst of the throne of
[2:13:25] four beasts in the midst of the elder
[2:13:27] stood a lamb
[2:13:32] it was time to quit looking upon their
[2:13:34] worthiness or their unworthiness it was
[2:13:37] time to start looking at the worthiness
[2:13:39] of the lamb
[2:13:43] hallelujah the lamb that had been slain
[2:13:46] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[2:13:48] are the seven spirits of god he came and
[2:13:51] took the book out of the right hand and
[2:13:53] sat on the throne and when he took the
[2:13:55] book the four beasts and four and twenty
[2:13:57] elders fell down before the lamb having
[2:13:59] won every one of harps and golden vials
[2:14:02] full of odors which are the prayers of
[2:14:04] the saints and they sung a new song
[2:14:09] saying thou art worthy
[2:14:12] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[2:14:16] open the seals for thou slain and has
[2:14:19] redeemed us unto god by thy blood out of
[2:14:22] every kindred tongue people and nation
[2:14:25] and hath made us unto our gods kings and
[2:14:27] priests and we shall reign upon the
[2:14:30] earth
[2:14:32] and i beheld and heard the voice of many
[2:14:35] angels round the throne and the beasts
[2:14:37] and the elders and the number of them
[2:14:38] were ten thousand times ten thousand and
[2:14:41] thousands of thousands saying with a
[2:14:43] quite timid voice
[2:14:45] a loud voice
[2:14:47] worthy is lamb

[2:21:28] some rocks cry out and as long as i'm
[2:21:30] alive
[2:21:32] i'm going to glorify the king of kings
[2:21:34] and the lord of the lord they ain't a
[2:21:36] rock there in a tree they ain't a hill

[2:23:02] that's what your praises does
[2:23:04] it binds your enemy
[2:23:08] and they're nobles with fetters of iron

[2:48:30] confirmed in my heart
[2:48:32] that young men got it
[2:48:47] as
[2:48:49] as the people kept on praying kept on
[2:48:51] praying i finally sat down over here
[2:48:54] and later on he came to me he said
[2:48:56] brother
[2:48:58] he said not only did i get the holy
[2:49:00] ghost my brother got the holy ghost and
[2:49:01] my cousin got the holy ghost

[2:49:31] what the prophet of elijah this last day
[2:49:33] said
[2:49:34] would happen
[2:49:36] and you and i are the fulfillment of it
[2:49:40] this day this scripture
[2:49:43] has been fulfilled this day this quote
[2:49:46] has been fulfilled
[2:49:51] don't you love him

[2:49:57] close in prayer i love him i love him
[2:50:05] let's just let's sing it in the
[2:50:06] prayerful way
[2:50:12] [Music]
[2:50:33] just
[2:50:34] [Music]
[2:50:43] oh
[2:50:46] [Music]

[2:50:54] [Music]
[2:51:24] just
[2:51:28] [Music]
[2:51:34] oh
[2:51:37] [Music]
[2:51:46] i believe it was last year nathan you
[2:51:48] wanted to have a camp meeting and then
[2:51:50] covet struck and they shut it down
[2:51:54] but i don't know when it was when
[2:51:57] we were at it at the service at home
[2:51:58] church and incidentally incidentally
[2:52:01] nathan is my grandson
[2:52:04] he came to the office before the service
[2:52:07] started and he said grandpa
[2:52:10] we can get the camp
[2:52:13] this year
[2:52:14] would it be all right to have a youth
[2:52:16] meeting
[2:52:18] and you know i wasn't even thinking you
[2:52:20] know how we're going to get all the help
[2:52:21] and everything i just said
[2:52:22] okay that'll be good
[2:52:24] that'll be fine
[2:52:27] but i stand amazed as a pastor
[2:52:32] how the church got behind him
[2:52:34] [Music]
[2:52:35] behind that desire and that burden
[2:52:39] and i know nathan has already thanked
[2:52:41] the people and
[2:52:43] and spoke about the people but i want to
[2:52:45] say that as a pastor i'm so proud of our
[2:52:48] local church
[2:52:50] people how they got behind this and put
[2:52:52] their hearts into it
[2:52:54] to make a success spiritually
[2:52:58] i say to god be the glory
[2:53:01] to god be their glory
[2:53:11] [Applause]
[2:53:23] i want to thank the ministers brother
[2:53:25] timothy
[2:53:26] brother andrew
[2:53:28] god bless you for your labors
[2:53:32] you know in the third exodus
[2:53:34] brotherhood said that pillar fire
[2:53:37] is with us to lead us onto the
[2:53:39] millennium
[2:53:41] you probably heard brother andrew and
[2:53:43] maybe you don't want me to say it but
[2:53:44] you probably heard brother andrew say
[2:53:46] last night the pillar of fire is here i
[2:53:48] was talking to him before service today
[2:53:50] he said i actually saw it he wasn't just
[2:53:52] saying that he saw it
[2:53:56] young people don't be afraid
[2:54:00] god is with you
[2:54:04] and he'll take you on
[2:54:07] you keep on praying for revelation
[2:54:11] because when that revelation that
[2:54:12] spiritual revelation hits you gates of
[2:54:14] hell can't prevail against it
[2:54:20] you know you can have this in your home
[2:54:22] church
