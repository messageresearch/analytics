know my son michael's story he was not born into his now physical condition but it was from a surgery that went terribly wrong the lord brought him back but he had suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen for so long what michael's life may have may had been taken away from him at that moment i was not serving the lord at this time but our lord and savior use michael's circumstance to bring me and eventually my children to him praise god all of us at that moment were given a new life amen i have had murdered have heard many times the encounter with a young man with a chain around his neck and being in an animal-like condition that brother josh bennett brought out on thursday night no doubt many people would look upon him and feel that there's no real humanness to him let alone feeling love and compassion for another but the lord jesus allowed our prophet to see into that man's heart and discounting all satan had done physically to him satan couldn't have his heart a heart that was capable of love and compassion not even of himself but for his brother amen praise god my heart was so full thinking about my own son and his heart we got home and i set michael up in his room he has a lazy boy chair a laptop which he watches and listens to services messages and singing about our savior and there are pictures of family sitting on the side i was looking at michael sitting there and i asked him michael what is in your heart [Music] he looked at me and smiled and held up two fingers i said you have two things in your heart he shook his head yes i said what is one thing in your heart and very directly he pointed to the laptop where he hears nothing except jesus i said jesus is in your heart and he shook his head yes yes i asked him what the second thing in his heart and again very directly he pointed to our family picture i said your i asked your family is in your heart shaking his head and smiling yes i was so full of love and compassion believing this conversation was from the lord satan may try to rob us here but oh are treasures that are waiting for us whether here or there michael has a new body waiting for him hallelujah [Applause] [Music] satan michael has a new body waiting for him then we will talk as long as we want enjoying our voices and many missed and new conversations i pray the lord blesses you and all who remember remember michael in your

and take out a part of his day and and be able to speak to you all and then uh that sister connie would be so kind to join us god bless you sister connie thank you amen for you and brother ron to be here amen we count them a great great privilege uh as you heard yesterday in the in the wedding ceremony again i think it's probably one of the best ceremonies i'd ever heard spoken personally but there's a lot of personal things that's went on in the family and brother ron has been such an encouragement to our family and especially to bethany herself and so you could you could hear that uh that there's been an influence there and we just thank the lord for the ministry and what we what we'd like to do this morning if we could just maybe uh turn the order of the service and let's just sing that little song this morning that he is here amen he is here and you know when jesus comes he makes all the difference we just just had a tremendous camp meeting and i know all of us was happy with it and we all said my that was a good meeting and we're happy but you know when jesus came by and he sanctioned with his presence that's the one we want to be happy and we want him to be happy with this gathering this morning i know there's mothers sitting here with needs i know there's fathers that are trying to make decisions and they struggling there's there's elders that are watching people they're been praying for for years and they want to see them forward moving me and you know in bible times when jesus was about to pass through the people would gather out in the streets and they would lay the lame in the halt and they would just pray that the lord might look their way and if he looked their way everything was about to change so this morning as jesus passed by as he passes through this room this morning why don't you with your hearts just begin to pull on him said lord come by my house today come by my family come by my knee and speak to it lord we're asking you for your mercy now let's just sing this together as we stand this morning oh he is here [Music] i will bless his name again [Music] hear him calling out your name is here you can touch it [Music] let's just sing it to him one more time ah [Music] i will [Music] is [Music] hear him [Music] is [Music] hallelujah he makes all the difference in our lives doesn't he just a moment with him and our lives has changed amen so good to see you so good to be with you i'm honored to be here again and and for those that know this is a miracle and we don't have to ask for any more today but we have need of them but today is a miracle for me in some respects i never thought i would be able to stand here again but god's great he's absolutely a sustainer sure miss brother ray this morning and i pray that god touches his body and raises him up our god is faithful he's absolutely faithful and and um thank you for your prayers for me over the last year and a half and and uh you know god's got in control he knows he knows our days he knows when he'll take us he knows when we'll be healed he knows everything and i just give him complete trust and and we are certainly thrilled this week to celebrate another birthday and and so we're just thrilled about that and uh probably for most part i wouldn't have been thrilled about celebrating 60 but i'm glad i lived to see it and so amen amen and he's just good to us he says good to us and thank you for your prayers for those that might not know we have been diagnosed with stage four cancer brain and lung and lymph nodes and and uh we take chemo twice a day and doctors have already given me up over and over again and told me to get my funeral plans ready but hey this is how stage four looks let's just keep going so hey man so i'm thankful to have my wife sister connie she's been my my steady rock beside of me and she's a soldier she's a great nurse and we we've had some really tough times and don't let what you see fool you we've had some really tough times and and one of my doctors he he's a very dear friend of mine as well and he always has two or three doctors with him because we're at a research hospital and and he tells every doctor that comes in the room with him he said now this is the sickest man that will be in our clinic he said but don't he look like a picture of health and he'll always say it's his god it's his god and so so we're thankful for that hallelujah so when you're going through your storms you don't have to go the why me or pity me or somebody feel sorry for me you can go through the storm with your shoulders rearing back and say god's on my side he's on my side and where i'm going to have victory every day is a victory amen amen i thought yesterday was one of the most beautiful weddings that that i've ever witnessed in my life i was thankful to be a part of it what wonderful royalty that the bride of jesus christ has and so amen and so we we're just honored to be a part of that wedding and uh we've had many supernatural events together and and god i'm sure that this morning will be no different and you say well brother ron i'm expecting a miracle today i am due and the jesus that's in the room he's not dead and the revival that you've been looking for and listening for many of us has got gray hair now and we knew that the bride's revival was coming but now we're witnessing it it's among us [Music] the world is falling apart and it's supposed to politics has falling apart morals are falling apart but the bride is having her revival and that only tells us that it is a sign we're getting ready to go and one morning this body will change and you'll see your loved ones walk down the walkway don't be scared let them in amen amen god bless you this morning

before god defying gravity raising their hands as a sign that i know my jesus can heal me deliver and come to my situation now father i ask you the day that you touch brother ray erickson i ask you to

in a storm father i i've been through a year and a half of a storm and there's been waves that seem like 150 foot high over top of me and say pass through lord you just took me by the hand and guided us through every situation i ask you today that you would anoint us give us strength to speak anoint our hearts and if there's any gift that we have let us get ourselves out of the way in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen amen god bless you thank you for being such a wonderful audience amen if you will turn with you into matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. this is very familiar portion of scripture and then we'll go to psalms chapter 46. jesus teaches us how to pray and so one of the greatest answers that we can have in life and the greatest connections is that we can talk to god amen and tell him very sincerely our deepest desires and we can do it in the privacy of our own lives and it doesn't go through a bishop or a cardinal yeah or a pope or even brother branham it goes directly into the hands of our god [Music] and the good news is he hears every prayer and he answers every one of them he answers every one of them and so the disciples that was the inner circle of believers knew that this was the communication with god and they had seen jesus go away to pray and draw strength they needed that because jesus would not always be with them in a fleshly form and they needed to have some key thoughts of how do we talk to god it still works today after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory amen psalms chapter 46 and verse 1. god is our refuge and strength and that's what i want to speak on our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof salah there is a river the streams whereof shall make the the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved he utterly he uttered his voice and the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge come behold the works of the lord and what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and he cut off the spear and asunder he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge let's read that last verse together the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is a refuge you may be seated hallelujah look at your neighbor and say let's have church you've been having church let's have it again what an incredible meeting that you guys had hallelujah i think you should do it again if time should last do it again and so i encourage you to do it again oh yeah you're going to have critics that said you make too much noise you shouted too much but hey we are just getting ready to shout on the streets of gold hallelujah brother branham said that he he took jesus upon a mountain and set him down and and jesus rebuked rebuked him again with the word he defeated satan with the word of god showing that the weakest of christians has the devil whispered in your ear this week the weakest of christians can defeat satan with thus saith the lord it is written it is written it is written psalms 23 says it like this and we knew it since a little child the lord is my shepherd so let's just lay some real foundations down the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside of the still waters he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil so he's given you the parameters of a trial of your life because every one of us are going to go through tests trials situations and when you go through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me when the preacher is not there your favorite person in the world is not there jesus has made a promise to you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you [Applause] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my minimus how that must shake the kingdom of hell christians don't run hallelujah we don't run glory lord thou anoint my head with all in my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever i'm not quitting church i'm not going back i won't quit worshiping the lord regardless of my trial regardless of my situation i have been built for this hour this is why i was born this is why he prepared me and built me like he built me god will have a testimony on the earth i'd like to declare this this this morning jesus is on his way and there's nothing that the satan can do to stop him and we say amen psalms 27 says it like this the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that that that of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore while i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord hear o lord when i cry my with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou i seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger david was just describing all of our feelings many times in our lives thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over into the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such breathe out cruelty i had fainted you said brother on what you read the first part of the scripture and we know that that's the text for the rapture but did you read the second part of it because in the time of trouble we're going to go through some things and i would have fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the livin wait on the lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord i feel like 10 000 volts of electricity is on this stage psalms 91 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide unto the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and the noise of pestilence and he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings thou shalt trust and he shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid of the tear by night or the arrow that flies by day neither the pestilence that walketh in the darkness nor the destruction that wastes at the noon day a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come not thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because now notice this are these words because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways let me just let's just stop just for a moment you are the most powerful people on the earth you are the most powerful people on the earth in geneva they will gather presidents and dictators from all over the world to the naked eye that looks like the most powerful men gathered for this moment but that's not how god looks at it god looks at it when you gather here in this room and bring your lips of fire from your homes and you make a vote that god's on my side are you with me brother brown called you a super race of people he said if he set a hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride bone of his bone life of his life power of his power the very same life that was in jesus christ he placed it on the inside of you all that god was he poured it into the church you're the attributes of his mind living let me just say this you don't let the devil whisper in your ear that you're nobody you're the most powerful people god the infinite god [Applause] didn't pick a weak bride to stand at this layout of cnh he picked the strongest of the strongest to live here [Applause] when hell would enlarge itself lay out a seal would pour all of its demons out there would be a bride on the earth that would have the greatest armor with the greatest message and would stand still and see the salvation of god you can't move them you can't shake them they're not turning and running they know who they are they know what they've been called for they know that what they've been elected for in this age this is our hour we don't have to apologize for being a noisy church we'll reflect in heaven we're reflecting our inheritance i do not have to wait just walk on streets of gold to worship the lord i don't have to wait to walk and dance over there i can do it right here regardless of our conditions [Applause] the scripture said who hath believed i report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall we are healed [Applause] not going to be we are healed and the same god that could forgive the most wicked person in the city and it did not diminish his power one little iota god don't have to recharge it doesn't diminish his power of the blood of jesus christ when he saves the worst sinner in the city neither does it diminish his power of the blood of jesus christ by his stripes we are healed you can line up every cancer devil in the world they are defeated [Applause] on the fly leaf of brother branham's bible he had the vision that two years before that he was going to pray for that little dead finland boy there in finland listen it didn't shock god that it happened time expiring does not shock god two years later they come up on the scene and brother branham is looking at the scene and feels something familiar asking even is this little boy been seen in the prayer line have i seen him in a service and then it hits him to go god speaks to him to go read the fly leaf and he looks around and everything's exactly just right that's why we as ministers can look at what's going on now and because we've seen it in the vision of the message you are what the message has produced brother branham standing there night after night things that are to be works as faith express the rapture all of those messages which is laying out maybe to unbelieving congregations but the word was going out knowing that you were coming [Music] he knew that you would arrive he knew you would arrive exactly on time when god comes to job job is a does not know that god's had a conversation with his enemy the enemy that he made always remember that the enemy that you're fighting is the enemy god made that's an important key god built his own enemy and he's only a tool in the hand of god and one day we'll look at him and go is that the man that troubled us [Applause] and remember he's a fallen angel and you're a risen one [Music] and remember this brother branham stood there and said that you have more authority than an angel in heaven and let that be very specific even in satan's highest order being the angel over top of worship as a son and daughter of god you still had more power than he did [Music] and definitely because he has fallen and he wrestles against you and he fights against you because he knows who you are when you take the word of god when you take the word of god and you begin to cut him apart listen he may come to your house but you don't have to give him a good day when he comes to talk to job about having to have a visitation with him job is sitting on an ash heap that's where he had worshiped it's a good spot to go where you worship regardless of your circumstances go where you worship now the enemy will tell you to stay home have a pity party nobody loves you but go to where you worship now when god comes to me notice in the scriptures maybe you're a better reader than i am but i don't notice anywhere in the scriptures where god has a pity party with him he doesn't talk about even his circumstances but he begins to ask him job where was you when i was molding the earth where was you when i was laying the foundations where was you when the morning stars sing together so god not always describing to job i saw you before the foundation of the world and i see you after amen what about you when he comes to you to remind you oh brother ron you guys i'll say the same thing get us to know who we are it's very important because god's not only saw you as an attribute in the lamb's book before the foundation of the world think about it he watched over you through every generation through every war through every turmoil and your family may have been some of the biggest wretches that ever been in the world but your seat think about it one in a million god watched over that seed of life not just with your mother and father but all the way back through he watched over you he knew what color hair you would have what your bill would be like what your personality would be like god's a great artist he watched over you to make you exactly how you would be don't you put yourself down you're god's canvas god's been working on you way more than just a few decades he's been walked away looking on you for 2 000 36 000 years all the way back when jesus was on the earth your attributes were walking in somebody's body somebody was carrying you and satan thinks he can destroy you now [Music] [Applause] let's just go to another realm when jesus was on the cross you was inside of him god sent him to hell so you wouldn't have to go david whom i've been reading from this morning said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption and you were on the inside of him are you with me if corruption could not touch you in jesus body 2 000 years ago satan don't have a chance to die [Music] hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah we are in our season blueberries have a season blackberries have a season we're in the bright season it's our season we're in the blending of dimensions we are the book of acts that brother adam talked about it's been written in our lives and i want to reiterate that statement and there's nothing that satan can do to stop it that stupid devil just over a year and a half i started getting some interesting presents i didn't know what i was getting but i was thankful for them brother tim pruitt would give me rocks from where the same valley that david picked up those stones actually those stones were placed by angels and they defeated giants those stones had laid there for thousands of years and they'd defeated giants before and so brother tim was having some stones picked up to bring me they'd been giant killers before when god rained rained those stones down on those armies and so now given to me before i would know anything because there was a goliath going to raise his head we had brother kelly hildebrandt that was going to come to speak for us in the november before we got our news and brother kelly was supposed to be there on friday and his flight was stopped saturday his flight was stopped even saturday evening flight was stopped so he was going to fly through the night and get there on sunday i actually changed the service to where i said satan's trying to stop a message he's trying to stop a message and that's the only thing he's trying to do is stop a message from coming god has got something to say to us i saw a coin on brother kelly's desk and i really liked it and brother kelly was going to bring this coin and he was going to preach a sermon from it and it was a storm it was a a commemorative coin remembering the normandy d-day of 1944 world war ii and a grain of sand on it it's actually it's actually embedded in the plastic of this coin a grain of sand if you remember those grains of sand that brother branham talks about with abraham he said he said abraham can you can you count the sand so shall thy seek be look at the stars can you count the stars so shall thy seed be that was more than just a saying i'll just give you a little background here is that okay anyway we had a brother in our church he had been a very kind of a rough individual i say rough very delicately in the latter years of his life he starts coming to church he said i would have never thought i'd ever sit in a church god knows his name was max max had ran the beach normandy and he said i watched as the thousands died he says i left the boat men were being killed and i was still alive he said i ran in those bloody waters expecting to die any second and i was still alive he said when i got on the sand there was just bodies laying everywhere and i was still alive he said i just kept running and he said when i got to the wall i was still alive one night i was preaching on the preservation of a seed how god watches over you in the midst of a storm in the midst of a war in the midst of illness god watches over you he preserves you when you can't preserve yourself and he said i sat there and i realized as i ran that beach that morning it was god so when i saw it at brother kelly's it meant absolutely incredible amount to me so brother kelly walks to the pulpit that night on a sunday evening and he describes how that satan had tried to keep him from getting there and he said i believe my message has been he's tried to stop the message and he said tonight i'm going to speak from the backside of this coin we will accept nothing less than full victory [Applause] we did not realize that in the coming days of what would be announced to us december the 22nd god spoke to me you say well brother ron i i don't know about these guys that see visions or hear voice of the lord let me just let me just tell you now i'm not expecting my critic to believe it but god spoke to me that morning and he used these words if you trust me i'll use you like never before i had no idea of what was getting ready to face me in the coming days but it did not surprise god i can stand here with courage and confidence and i want to echo this it may not be your testimony this morning but whatever trial that you're going through take courage god saw your trial before you ever got into it i would go to brother biscuits i would take the test i would take the scans and i would go to brother biscuits they'll let you just continue my my agenda and i would go to bed of the biscuits and i would preach three sermons one was courage the second was was take it back the third one was naaman was a leper and was totally cleansed i would get the message at at the hotel actually i would get the message as i'm going to speak on courage i get the message that i have cancer and it's not it's in my lungs they can see it in my lungs they had sent a i was going to travel alone and so because of the rates of the tickets and the doctor sent news to sister connie whatever you do you be with him because he's going to get some news while he's there sister connie called the airline thank you brother brian called the airline and she got a seat beside of me on every leg of that flight and you that fly you know what i'm talking about right there and they called us and told us that we're we're perfectly confident that you have cancer in your lungs and so we would go there is this okay to tell it and so we would go we would i would preach those three sermons and i thought it was no small coincidence that brother biskell had interviewed brother charlie mitchell who had cancer in his lung and i thought god you're so perfect in your timing i'm speaking for brother bischo and he's sitting right there and i'm standing here with the words that you've got cancer and we would go home and we would have one biopsy after another biopsy any of you that's ever been through biopsies they're very difficult and i had a tumor that was right beside of the heart and they were going to do a biopsy on it you have doctors here you they know what you're talking about and they're very they're very painful and so anyway they had put me there was about eight different doctors and then there was eight attendants that was with them and i was getting ready to and they were just rolling me every which away and trying to get me position right so they could put the needles in and uh taking the exam and before they did it finally one of the doctors came to me and he said ron i just want to tell you this i i know you're thinking that those they're gone because you're a preacher and i said yes sir he said well he said this is the deal he said you've got so many we just don't know which one to get and the one that we're after is in a very dangerous spot and so he rolled me over on my stomach and he finally come around and he said ron i want to pray with you and he said these words in my ear your god has got this [Applause] it would become back it was cancer and they would find out it's a melanoma cancer and it's a fast spreader it's a it's a lot of different things it's a devil brother wayne who i think is one of the most powerful preachers on the war in the world don't don't take that for granted don't take that gift for granted you know a lot of times we have a meeting and blind eyes come open and we all rejoice but brother wayne was scheduled i believe it was in march to come to my place to speak and said to bethany would come and she would sing in my house and we would have a wonderful time and we went to red lobster and and i went blind in my left side my vision was very distorted you know satan is stupid he's just stupid and so brother wayne prays for me that weekend and we have phenomenal services which is no surprise to anybody just phenomenal and i go to the eye doctor the next morning he sends me to uva and then they send me through all kinds of tests and tests and tests and it was a guy that worked in the eye clinic a technician that said hey he's got something going on in his brain they had just ran an mri just only weeks before and said there's nothing there and here we are just a few weeks later and they run an mri later that evening and i'll just have to tell you it was breathtaking when they walk in and say you have a tumor about that size on the back of your brain that's cutting your vision off and you've got two more that's there how long have you known you had brain cancer and we didn't know it now i have to tell you there are some storms you don't see coming but when i came to realize when i came to realize that brother wayne's coming satan made a bad move and had he just left it alone just a few days i would have never preached another sermon i'd have went to a premature grave remember the scripture all things work together for you're good so let me just say this now even as i'm preaching don't give up on your children don't give up on your loved ones it may look entrappily terrible right now but god's got a plan [Applause] because of you who you are every move that satan makes against you god has allowed him and give him permission because remember he can't touch a half your head until he gets permission from god and god's got confidence in you that you can make it through the trial these are more than quotes these are more than scriptures he is our refuge he is our strength [Music] hallelujah and i want to stand here my declaration is very clear we will accept nothing less then total victory [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we just have to make our stand let me just say this to you when it's happening at somebody else's house it's easy to make a stand what will you do under pressure because you are what you are under pressure are you with me when somebody in your family says they don't believe the message no longer and they question everything in the world around you you know who you are you know who you are just stand strong pressure is what you're built for man woman boy or girl we're built to stand the pressure god knows what you can handle what you can handle and he prevents the devil from coming at you he's watched over your trial he's actually the greatest strategist and the greatest general that's ever been so understand if you have came into a trial not of your own making but if you come into a trial and you see it satan has come against you to buff it and beat you i want to quote some scriptures to you be strong and good courage can we just say it we are sons and daughters of god we were built to fight and the greatest armor that you've got is his word and prayer before god are you with me take your sword out and never put it back i want to remind you is this okay we don't back up we don't back down we fight [Music] he shelters us under his wings he fights our battles he wins our wars we cast out satan with holy ghost boldness and he authors has authorized us and give us empowered us to use the name of jesus for every need at any time under any condition any place we have been declared an invincible army hallelujah i feel like joshua preaching the last sermon hallelujah if any bride is prepared to take the land we are we are i don't care what we face it may hurt and it may sting this ain't hollywood there's a lot of sickness that i've had to face in the last year and a half tuesday i was in the hospital getting a bump i knew i wanted to be here i don't want satan to steal one thing away from me i want to remind you if god be for me who can be against me george washington was persistent at valley forge all the odds was against him the enemy was across the river but after all night in prayer they are the american soldiers with no shoes on their feet about one-third of them had shoes and they crossed the the river at valley forge through the ice and three musket bullets went through george washington's coat but he had an answer from god and there was no need of him backing down nothing could stop him then he crossed the river because he was persistent he had heard from god i want to ask you have you heard from god when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord raises up a standard against him are you with me i want to preach to every individual here now refuse to retreat refuse to retreat never never never give up i want you to say that with me i'll never never never give up the most supernatural thing about you is your tongue it has the power of life and death in it satan may put negative thoughts in your mind don't let them go across your tongue you have the power to create an atmosphere around you that's the reason we come and shout and we sing is we're creating an atmosphere for god inhabits in the praises of his people you want to know where god's at he's with people that know how to praise him they praise him in a storm they praise him on the mountaintops they praise him in the violence [Applause] and if anything you get from this this morning you've heard me preach now 20 some 20 maybe 26 years and are in almost in a row i preach to you with all my strength but i can stand here in the midst of a storm and be just as positive [Applause] i'm not depending on my flesh i'm depending on the word of god are you with me now that's the same with the rapture i'm not depending on how i feel or what i see his word said that the resurrection is getting ready to happen and we're getting ready to get a change of our bodies it's not an if it's just a win and we are in the season for it [Applause] i'd like to say this to you when brother branham bowed on his knees with that little finland boy he knew what the vision said he knew what god said it didn't matter if he had a thousand critics around he told them he said if this little boy's not off of the ground in five minutes you call me a false prophet he knew where he stood listened to him he said you could have satan could have lined up every devil in hell and they couldn't have stopped it [Music] i don't care what the critics say that that didn't happen it happened just the way brother random said it did now i want to tell you this one morning when you look out and see your loved ones walk down the road standing in a brand new party they'll take a step this way and you'll take a step that way let the heathen rage and the critics scream i believe this word with all my heart [Music] [Applause] he's never lost a case he's never been in a crisis he has never lied he's never failed and he's always on time he's made a decision and he's never changed his mind about what he's going to do he has unlimited power brother braham said we must have trials intestines and times to prove our faith every son that cometh to god must first be tried and chastened of god you mustn't question anything to god for the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord every trial is put upon you to prove you and the bible said they're more precious to you than gold if god can let a few uh light afflictions happen to you remember it's correction for you every son that cometh to god must first be chastened of god tried child trained there's no exceptions every son that cometh these afflictions are done and brought about to see what your attitude you'll take it's god's proving ground that's all earth is is his proving ground where he's trying to prove you yesterday as i i stood here i believe it was here looks a lot different today doesn't it i wasn't just making up good words to to embellish or to make you feel good or even isaac and bethany but i was saying that from my heart isaac and bethany are what the message produces you are what the message produces so when you walk into this church and you take your position and you sit down the most powerful angels stand and watch you worship and you know what your situation is you know what the conditions are like around you and every one of you are going through different things every one of you are because in this life this mortal life there will be all kinds of things happen that will catch you off guard take your breath let's not be delicate it'll take your breath but when you catch your breath and you're looking square in the eyes and tell him boo [Music] hallelujah there'll be moments that you walk into this building where you feel so despondence and feel so depressed i'm talking to you now because he's an enemy and he's at war and he don't have long to work on you he knows rapture's happening listen he believed brother branham more than ever he believed it he stood there night after night after night after night and could not disprove it then he comes to this church trying to disprove you over and over and over again that's why he fights so hard against you he don't have long to work on you and he wars at you and he wars at you and he whispers in your ear but god is our refuge and our sins [Applause] and i want to tell you what an inspirational song this morning the liberator is in the house he's not somewhere else he's here and if i may stretch out just a little bit what was prophesied about the revival bride's revival was prophecy now's history [Applause] hallelujah where's the bride's revival act you have arrived [Applause] i'm him [Applause] he's living in me [Music] this is that this is that this is what you're seeing this is that it is your refuge it is your strength our god of the lord of hosts is among us give the lord a great big hand this morning hallelujah hallelujah i'm enjoying this this is our moment our absolute our abstract title deed everything that we have made up for the journey he's gave to us [Applause] we cannot be defeated hallelujah oh don't you just take your loved one by the hand just now i don't know what your trials are i don't know what your situations are but god does satan you better leave on the authority of the word of god heavenly father right now we have declared your word hallelujah and everything that we have need of is is in the book every promise it's a covenant with abraham's seed now satan's wanting to raise his ugly head he likes to make storms in individuals lives and he does it individually because the rapture is going to happen individually so he does it individually to attack but when that individual realizes who they are and what they are and what they've been called for they individually pull their sword out and they make their stand and they realize that god is their refuge and their strength and when they bring their lick of fire into the building like they've done this morning and they realize that the liberator is in the house the doctor is here hallelujah hallelujah satan i've told you a long time ago that this cancer is defeated in the name of jesus christ the same with all of the diseases across this building right now there's not a disease in the building that god can heal that individual that don't know you that's been running from the presence of the lord for for quite a long spell i pray that father that you'd inspire their heart right now this morning they don't have to leave this building the same that they walked in lord and those that are wanting a refilling of the holy ghost it's here for us today lord may we draw a circle around us father hallelujah how may the revival happen inside of that circle right here this morning we don't have to wait on it it's here [Music] won't you just lift your hands to him now and give him thanks in praise [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] brother ben could we sing that just now [Music] let's just worship the lord just now healing is here [Music] healing is here [Music] i receive it right now [Music] oh [Music] healing is here believing so i lift my [Music] where my help comes from i look to you my rock my healer i trusted oh sickness

[Applause] my goodness what an hour what a time to serve the lord amen it's for jesus it's all for jesus you might as well worship him this morning amen what a mighty god what a mighty god we serve amen amen what a what a what an hour amen i was sitting listening to our brother spencer preach and and sometimes people say to me brother wayne is he really that sick you wouldn't like like that like that brother said in the meeting dinner he said he don't look what he'd been through he don't look like what he's been through and he don't look like what he's going through but that's how a son of god goes through anything that's how he goes through anything and he's he's uh he you know i was sitting there watching brother ron preach and i thought my them devils are getting a whippen amen them devils are getting a whippet i've i've i've said in history class when i was a kid and i dreamed about setting in the camp around the fire when stonewall jackson come riding in and to hear him get off and address the troops and and talk to them about the about the faith and how they were going to press and you know this morning i was sitting there thought my i'm sitting i'm sitting and listening amen to something equivalent of a stonewall jackson talking to an army he said brother wayne is that really no no i would rather be sitting in this meeting this morning than i had at the campfires of stonewall jackson what about when winston churchill walked in and the nazi army was taking over the entire world and and it looked like everything was against them do you all know that they didn't have a fighting chance but winston churchill walked to the platform through the medium of radio and spread the word across the entire english continent and our country and he began to say to them we shall fight these nazis on the beaches he said we'll fight them in the streets we'll fight them and he named a bunch of places he said and we shall do it he said but one thing we shall not surrender and i thought this morning listening to a man preached like that and if you if you you you you're hearing the same courage not a natural but in a spiritual realm when this bride's being attacked from every corner she's being attacked by every unbelieving every spirit of infirmity every devil out of hell has raised itself up and and pushed against this church and here stands a man preaching with cancer in his body and and the spirits of discouragement saying you shouldn't get up there today you shouldn't go up there and preach those meetings you shouldn't do it the spirits of doubt saying it'll never make a difference it'll never be there and he silenced every voice of every critic every voice of every disturbance and stood right here and announced that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it don't matter if there's cancer in your body it doesn't matter if there's trouble in your life or there's a storm going our god is a mighty conqueror this morning and we have not been defeated and we will not be defeated because we are the church of the living god and invincible art let me ask you something if not now when will we be and if you're not the people who will be the people but i believe this is that that has been prophesied this is the hour amen of the presence of the almighty god and i believe we got a right to rejoice this morning i believe we i believe we can do it brother david i know we go through storms and trials amen it would be easier to say who hasn't been through something who hasn't been through something raise your hand every person in this building has been through something but let me let me tell you the designer of your life knew you were going to do that and if he wanted perfect people to praise him and worship him he had a heaven full of angels he had the moon and the stars and the sun and they never failed to praise him amen at any hour at any time amen but god set all of that aside amen and look down into this earth this morning to see you who are scarred who you are going through storms you're going through the trials of your life and he steps back and says see what they're going to do now well i'll tell you when when he pulled the angels from the heaven this morning and said let's go take a seed and true word tabernacle and let's see what a man who has stage four cancer has to say about me amen let's see let's see what it what the people have to think about me now covet is ramping the world is in laodicea trouble is everywhere and what's the bride going to say we are not defeated the bride's going to say look this kingdom is coming down but our kingdom is rising up and this is our generation this is our time amen i'll tell you amen we love the lord jesus and i i i want to give what honor is due this morning and i want to say this if i can amen i i want to say this just just for this moment this morning amen i want to thank brother ron spencer for his for taking his time and coming and sharing his gift with us would you this morning with me thank brother ron sister connie the saints of god god bless you brother ron god bless you and we are with you and we're standing with him amen now let's give a praise to our lord jesus christ who is the god of all heaven and mercy what a mighty god we serve this morning [Applause] brother mike he's our god he's our god and he is more than able this morning hallelujah hallelujah well there ain't nobody and do me like jesus ain't nobody do me like the lord where there ain't nobody can do me like jesus please my afraid with my body and
