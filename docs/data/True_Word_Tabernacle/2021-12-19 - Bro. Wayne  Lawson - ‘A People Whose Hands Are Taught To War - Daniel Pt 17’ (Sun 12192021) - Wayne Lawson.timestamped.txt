[8:03] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and
[8:08] amen and God bless you if you have your
[8:10] Bibles this morning we want to turn into
[8:12] the book of Ephesians the first chapter
[8:15] I want to read again from the 11th verse
[8:18] amen I uh if you've been following along
[8:20] a little bit in our studies I've I've
[8:23] been reading uh from Daniel the 11th
[8:25] chapter uh the people that know their
[8:27] God shall do great exploits and uh I
[8:30] just started from The Book of Daniel
[8:31] moving into a little bit of a thought on
[8:34] uh the exploits of faith and those have
[8:37] led me to the book of Ephesians the
[8:39] first chapter and I've been reading from
[8:41] here in my personal studies this just
[8:44] personal notes I've been studying on
[8:45] milk honey and Giants so it's kind of a
[8:48] subtopic for me uh but uh I know there's
[8:51] a lot of giants in the land of
[8:52] inheritance and I've been I've been
[8:54] studying a few of the Giants and
[8:56] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11
[9:00] in whom we have obtained an
[9:03] inheritance being predestinated
[9:06] according to the purpose of him who
[9:08] worketh all things after the counsel of
[9:12] his own will amen may the Lord bless the
[9:14] word this morning as you could be seated
[9:17] I want to continue uh on the exploits of
[9:20] faith and uh I I in in this portion of
[9:24] the word I want to uh just speak to you
[9:27] about this again uh the in inheritance
[9:30] amen that we have received of course I I
[9:32] would just maybe back up just for a
[9:33] moment to you and and uh bring you up to
[9:36] where I'm looking uh but if you remember
[9:39] when we switched to this Ephesians
[9:41] chapter one on the inheritance we went
[9:43] back and found that this word
[9:44] inheritance uh being translated a little
[9:47] different than all the other words uh
[9:49] inheritance in the New Testament and it
[9:51] was speaking more about the casting of
[9:53] lots like they divided the land in the
[9:56] days of Joshua when it was divided among
[9:58] the children of Israel given to each
[10:00] tribe and that they they was given that
[10:02] inheritance now uh The Inheritance that
[10:05] they were given matched exactly what
[10:08] they were told by their mothers in their
[10:10] birth when they in Genesis Chapter 30
[10:12] when the wives of Jacob had the children
[10:14] of Israel they called out their names
[10:17] and their birth now it took about 400
[10:19] years after they went into bondage
[10:22] before they were able to possess those
[10:23] names and those names beginning to move
[10:26] into the land and remember uh the tribe
[10:29] and the land match together and Joshua
[10:31] was giving them marching instructions to
[10:33] go take the land and what would belong
[10:35] to them now showing that their
[10:37] inheritance were predating their even
[10:40] their own existence their their names of
[10:42] their tribes were the name of the land
[10:44] they were inheriting showing that
[10:47] predestination had gave them the
[10:49] position they were going to that they
[10:50] wouldn't just going to take land didn't
[10:52] belong to them but the land they were
[10:54] taking they were taking what belonged to
[10:56] them but other people were living on it
[10:59] so just because there's something on the
[11:00] land that belongs to you doesn't mean it
[11:02] doesn't belong to you it just means that
[11:05] it was yours to begin with and then
[11:07] something has moved upon it and so the
[11:10] inheritance that we have brother Ram
[11:11] said somebody had to leave you something
[11:14] he said we've obtained an inheritance
[11:15] somebody left you something before the
[11:17] foundation of the world it was a name
[11:19] written on the book of life that the
[11:21] lamb would be slain and you'd be
[11:23] recognized with it so our inheritance
[11:25] was a name written on the Lamb's Book of
[11:28] Life before the foundation ations of the
[11:29] world and we know that the people who
[11:32] have their names on that book that is
[11:34] the title deed of redemption to the
[11:37] entire Earth so we're connected to the
[11:39] promises in the Book of Romans where
[11:41] Paul had spoke of of Abraham and how
[11:45] that Abraham had been made the heir of
[11:47] the world so all the promises that the
[11:50] church have is connected in a link to
[11:53] being the heir of the world so if we're
[11:55] going to have a redeemed Earth then to
[11:58] to live on a redeemed redeemed Earth
[11:59] you're going to have to have a redeemed
[12:01] body so we're going to live in a
[12:02] redeemed Earth on a redeemed body in a
[12:04] redeemed body so we're looking at the
[12:06] promises amen of that portion but yet we
[12:09] understand that in the age that we're
[12:11] living in this inheritance of course is
[12:14] by predestination uh if you like it in
[12:16] the Bible it's Romans chapter 8: 29 and
[12:19] 30 he also did predestinate to be
[12:21] conformed to the image of the son that
[12:24] he might be the firstborn among many
[12:26] Brethren moreover whom he did
[12:27] predestinate them he called and whom he
[12:30] called he justified and them he
[12:32] justified he has already already
[12:34] glorified according to Ephesians 1 and
[12:37] verse 5 amen we'll be reading from the
[12:39] New Testament book of Joshua having
[12:42] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[12:44] children by Jesus Christ according to
[12:46] the good pleasure of his own will amen
[12:49] isn't it amazing that we could got a new
[12:51] testament Joshua and he said that we
[12:53] were actually predestinated unto the
[12:55] adoption of children you can use the
[12:57] word the placing of children amen into
[13:01] the good into the good pleasures of his
[13:03] own will in other word The Mystery of
[13:05] the will of God concerning your position
[13:08] in the word that was written before you
[13:10] ever came according to the the the book
[13:13] of the adoption brother bam tells us
[13:15] that the land that we're moving into for
[13:18] possession is not a natural land but a
[13:21] spiritual land as the children of Israel
[13:23] under Joshua moved into the land of
[13:26] promise it was a natural land with
[13:28] natural Giant with natural walls amen it
[13:31] was a natural battle under natural
[13:33] circumstances but we as the gentile
[13:36] people are a spiritual seed we're
[13:38] inheriting a spiritual land we have
[13:40] spiritual promises we are fighting
[13:43] spiritual Giants there is spiritual
[13:45] walls there are spiritual problems amen
[13:48] but as they said in the days of the
[13:50] natural we are more than able to take
[13:52] the land then the spiritual Joshua of
[13:54] this age has said to us we are more than
[13:57] able to take the land and that was some
[13:59] calebs among them amen that have to had
[14:02] to wait for 40 years amen but they're
[14:04] still able to to take the land and and
[14:07] they're still ready Amen to take the
[14:09] mountains that God has given to them so
[14:11] the promises that God give to you he
[14:14] give to you emphatically and gave them
[14:16] to you as a designed will of God but
[14:19] you've got to be ready to throw the
[14:21] devil off of your property you've got to
[14:24] ready to fight for what God gave you if
[14:27] you're certain that God gave you I
[14:29] believe that this in the Paradox brother
[14:31] bam says it very clearly he said I I
[14:34] believe and understand there's going to
[14:35] be an Ephesians to this age and in
[14:38] Paradox he says it like this it's
[14:40] promised another Ephesians it's
[14:41] predicted in the scripture we're going
[14:43] to have an Ephesians again and he's
[14:45] causing and speaking of Joshua moving
[14:48] into the promised land as an Ephesian to
[14:51] the move amen they worked under the law
[14:53] of Moses but the law could never take
[14:55] them into the promises but under the
[14:58] grace of God which was Joshua he came
[15:01] and positioned them in that land and
[15:03] brother B is typing that to this age and
[15:05] he's showing you that when the Holy
[15:07] Ghost comes it will position you in the
[15:10] lands of promise and in that Land Of
[15:12] Promise there is to be an Ephesians to
[15:14] it if there's an Ephesians to of course
[15:17] this land that we're in he's showing us
[15:19] then that the Ephesians or the moving in
[15:22] to the land is not the going into the
[15:24] Millennium as many people would like to
[15:26] think amen we are going to be the sons
[15:28] of God in the Millennium I agree with
[15:30] that greatly but brethren we are now the
[15:33] sons of God Amen in 1 John chapter 3 it
[15:36] said we are now the sons of God isn't it
[15:38] and amen look what he says here in the
[15:40] adoption the Canaan does not represent
[15:43] the age of the Millennium it represents
[15:44] the age of the Overcomer the
[15:47] dispensation of overcoming because in
[15:49] Canaan they killed and burned and took
[15:51] cities and there will be no death in the
[15:53] Millennium so what what the Canaan land
[15:56] represented was not the Millennium to
[15:58] the bride it represented the age of
[16:00] overcoming in the land of adoption and
[16:04] here we are this morning amen treading
[16:06] out the land of adoption the positioning
[16:09] of the church where they belong and and
[16:11] and what God has given to the church
[16:13] it's an inheritance amen God left us an
[16:16] inheritance and our inheritance is
[16:18] sunship amen I I think it's powerful
[16:21] this morning to be a Son of God that's
[16:23] what God left you to be a Son of God
[16:26] Amen what is your inheritance it's
[16:28] sunship to be a the Son of God and if
[16:30] you're a Son of God according to
[16:31] adoption brother bandam said this may
[16:33] choke you to death but amen but the men
[16:36] that are sons of God are amateur Gods so
[16:39] when he uh uh gives us um Mark chap 11
[16:43] if you say un this mountain brother B
[16:44] said if the little Gods would say unto
[16:46] the mountain be thou moved and don't
[16:49] doubt in your heart that you can have
[16:51] what you believed it shall come to pass
[16:53] you can have what you have said when
[16:55] little Gods when you say when little
[16:57] Gods say unto the the mountain I believe
[17:00] that this is the hour for it I believe
[17:02] that this is the time of the
[17:05] manifestation of the sons of God I
[17:07] believe that the prophet announced it
[17:09] we're in the Ephesians now there was a
[17:12] time of the coming out of denomination
[17:14] there was a time when the Revival was to
[17:17] come out amen but the Revival of the
[17:20] hour is not the coming out of
[17:22] denomination the Revival of the hour is
[17:24] moving into the promises that God has
[17:27] anointed you to believe and stand on and
[17:30] I believe that's where God is leading
[17:32] the church today is into every Divine
[17:35] promise that he has made it's a praise
[17:37] of manifestation it's where amen I love
[17:40] how brother Ram says things he said
[17:42] we're true sons and born sons and filled
[17:45] Sons speak the word of God and it's
[17:48] backed that's right the only way you
[17:51] could move a mountain would be deity
[17:53] speaking and you're a Son of God and you
[17:56] can receive God which is Zoe's own life
[17:58] then you become a part of God Amen I I
[18:01] love some of these quotes I I want to
[18:03] maybe just lay them out here when a
[18:05] spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith
[18:07] takes the word into his heart places it
[18:09] upon his lips it's the same as deity
[18:12] speaking and every Mountain has to go
[18:16] Satan cannot stand before that man I
[18:19] love it don't you there is a people that
[18:22] Satan cannot stand before now why can't
[18:25] he stand in front of them because they
[18:26] know their position with God and they
[18:29] have been given the word to speak and
[18:32] that word spoken will defeat Satan
[18:35] anywhere any place anytime under any
[18:38] form amen I believe it I believe that we
[18:40] can cut loose of every every uh
[18:43] hindrance and every thing that says
[18:45] these things are not true I believe we
[18:47] got a write this morning and a prophet
[18:49] of God said this a man F fully
[18:51] surrendered to God is omnipotent amen
[18:55] and he uses Mark 11 to prove it I know
[18:57] you don't know that you're all powerful
[18:58] which are all powerful a Man was created
[19:01] with Dominion a believer in his contact
[19:04] with his maker amen is the greatest
[19:07] weapon in the world a believer in
[19:09] contact with God is the most powerful
[19:11] thing that there is this morning I know
[19:14] that the atomic weapon is powerful I
[19:16] know that many things are powerful I
[19:18] understand that but there is nothing of
[19:20] Greater prevailing power than a Believer
[19:23] with a divine revelation of who they are
[19:25] in contact with their God given the
[19:27] power of the spoken word they have the
[19:30] ability this morning to to Route out
[19:33] Satan wherever he is and whatever he's
[19:36] doing I think too many of us has
[19:37] forgotten what our origin is and what
[19:40] we' have been designed to do your origin
[19:42] is to master every circumstance perfect
[19:45] faith will Master every circumstance
[19:48] that the origin that you are of is to be
[19:50] a receiver of perfect faith is that
[19:53] right Faith cometh by the hearing and
[19:54] the hearing the word of God Amen and the
[19:57] age that we are living we have heard a
[19:59] perfect word to design a perfect faith
[20:02] into a perfect manifestation of God in
[20:04] the age we're living in I believe this I
[20:07] don't believe it's a time to forget in
[20:09] the in the in the battles of adversities
[20:11] and trials and troubles I don't believe
[20:13] it's a time to forget who we are I think
[20:15] it's a time to remember who we are let
[20:18] the word of God be our memory is that
[20:20] right I don't think I I don't think it's
[20:23] a time to forget in your heart who you
[20:25] are you are son and daughters of God
[20:27] Amen you the origin of God designed by
[20:31] God adopted by God to be and speak in
[20:34] his stad I love how brother Ram says it
[20:37] he says amen he's given you the legal
[20:39] right so he's given you the power of
[20:41] Eternity can you imagine you have God's
[20:44] power of Eternity amen it's pretty
[20:46] powerful amen when you have a power of
[20:48] Eternity you shouldn't forget it amen do
[20:51] you know that brother random says the
[20:52] spiritual Amnesia that we should be
[20:54] identified with John the 14th chapter
[20:56] and the 12th verse and he that believeth
[20:58] to me the works that I do shall he do
[21:00] also now don't you forget it if you do
[21:02] then you got spiritual Amnesia you've
[21:04] forgotten who you are you forgot what
[21:07] your testimony means how about when he
[21:09] said if you abide in me and my word
[21:11] abide in you ask what you will and it
[21:13] shall be done and you're identified
[21:16] there to believe that's the truth he
[21:18] said if you say to this mountain and be
[21:20] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[21:22] believe what you have said shall come to
[21:24] pass you shall have what you have said
[21:27] can you be identified there do you hear
[21:29] him he's saying is your name there is
[21:32] that your identification amen he's
[21:34] saying to you watch now identify there
[21:37] to believe that is the truth if it
[21:40] hasn't he said then you're getting
[21:42] spiritual Amnesia and you have forgot
[21:45] you have lost your Christian balance you
[21:48] have lost your Christian balance when
[21:49] you don't believe that John 14:12
[21:52] applies to the bride in this age you
[21:55] have lost Christian balance you have
[21:56] lost what the power of the blood has
[21:59] done we are not standing on these
[22:01] promises by our own ability we are
[22:03] standing here by the power of the blood
[22:06] that has cleansed us back to True Sons
[22:09] to field Sons you put us back on the
[22:12] other side with God Amen God ain't on
[22:14] one side the sun's on the other the
[22:16] blood has put us on the same side amen
[22:20] they amen I love how brother random says
[22:22] that he said the blood didn't just
[22:23] Bridge a gap he said it has removed the
[22:26] Gap and has put us back on the same side
[22:29] with God I don't believe we ought to
[22:31] lose who we are I believe we ought to
[22:33] believe who we are and stand on that
[22:36] word amen the everpresent water from the
[22:39] rock this is a a powerful quote I know
[22:41] brother Ray has spoke on this one
[22:43] several times and I'm going to hijack it
[22:45] just for a moment this morning amen but
[22:47] the everpresent water from the rock
[22:49] remember what brother Ram says he said
[22:51] there's a power remember you could speak
[22:53] a world into existence and go live on it
[22:56] he said Hallelujah that's what the power
[22:58] is in the church now so if you're
[23:00] wondering what power is in you here's
[23:02] brother bandam telling you you could
[23:04] create a world and go live on it he said
[23:06] but it's controlled by law remember the
[23:08] quote now it's controlled by law and the
[23:10] law is keeping a bunch of Commandments
[23:12] it's a law of Faith he said all things
[23:15] are possible to them that believe see
[23:17] the law behind it all things are
[23:19] possible to them that believe there's
[23:21] the law of faith and if you can believe
[23:23] it now watch the scripture amen how
[23:26] brother BR breaks into it whatever God
[23:29] will lead your soul to
[23:31] believe whatever God will lead your soul
[23:34] to believe I love that it's a it's a
[23:37] it's a it's a refrigerator quote
[23:39] whatever God will lead your soul to
[23:41] believe can I can I just say it to you
[23:42] like this whatever God would say this is
[23:45] your ground whatever Joshua would say to
[23:48] you this is your ground whatever he
[23:51] would lead your soul to believe amen now
[23:54] brother Ram would say it differently to
[23:55] to place it into this thought he he'll
[23:58] say every place of The Souls of your
[24:00] foot can set upon by faith God gives it
[24:03] to you so he's saying see whatsoever
[24:06] thing you believe amen it's possible if
[24:08] you believe it and then he turns to say
[24:10] God's got to lead you to believe it and
[24:13] the leading to believe something is the
[24:15] putting of your feet upon those promises
[24:18] so every place you put the soul of your
[24:21] feet belongs to you personally as a
[24:24] possession but if you're going to put
[24:25] your feet on it you're going to have to
[24:27] war to keep it whatever whatever Caleb
[24:29] that you decide that is yours you're
[24:32] going to have to keep it now now now
[24:34] Caleb didn't pick amen the worst ground
[24:36] in all of Israel he picked the choice
[24:38] ground in Israel he picked The High
[24:41] Ground of Hebron around the City of
[24:43] Refuge and he said that's where I'm
[24:45] going to live but because it was
[24:46] beautiful land that's all the Giants
[24:49] said that's where I'm going to live and
[24:51] the Giants was living in the land amen
[24:53] that he was choosing for his portion but
[24:55] God had led him to believe by a prophet
[24:58] that he could possess the land and he
[25:00] was more than willing to able to fight
[25:02] for the land that God said he could have
[25:04] I think this morning Mark 11 and John 14
[25:09] and the power of this Rapture scripture
[25:11] that's laying here in the Bible that God
[25:13] has led us to believe by an Angel of the
[25:16] Lord that we are the generation to see
[25:19] the changing of our body amen we have
[25:21] seen and Believe by Revelation amen that
[25:24] we are to possess the spoken word we are
[25:26] to possess the promises of God in the
[25:29] age that we're living in so when you
[25:31] believe it amen that is your foot
[25:33] landing on that promise and the moment
[25:36] your foot lands on it as a giant to
[25:38] challenge whether it belongs to you or
[25:41] not but brother I was predestinated to
[25:43] the hour I was predestinated to the time
[25:46] there is something in me that can
[25:48] believe when I cannot see when I cannot
[25:51] taste when I cannot hear I can't smell
[25:53] it I can't prove it but there's
[25:55] something in me that believes it anyhow
[25:57] that is faith and faith is at the Helm
[26:00] of the Church of the Living God to
[26:02] manifest it in this hour I don't know
[26:04] about you but I I don't have any backup
[26:06] in me I don't have any let's just let
[26:09] the Giants have it I don't believe in
[26:11] that kind of religion I believe we are
[26:13] more than able to take everything that
[26:15] God said that we were able to take I
[26:17] believe there's a spirit on the church
[26:20] amen that is the spirit of adoption and
[26:23] is crying Abby father and is causing the
[26:26] church to be about the father's business
[26:29] and Performing the will of God woo
[26:32] brother I believe our name is on it
[26:34] don't
[26:35] you I believe our names are on it amen I
[26:39] believe we're to have the faith to to
[26:40] move into it don't you amen I know it's
[26:42] going to be a war but we are to have
[26:44] faith our names have been
[26:46] called our names are on it I I just
[26:50] break into this little thought right
[26:51] here but I'll say it like this if you
[26:53] ever see it's the will of God for you to
[26:55] have it isn't it different when you see
[26:58] it's the will of God Amen by faith Moses
[27:01] by faith Abraham by faith Rahab by faith
[27:04] Sarah by faith how how did they do it
[27:07] they saw it was the will of God for them
[27:09] to do it when you really see that it's
[27:11] the will of God that your life is
[27:14] fulfilling the scriptures of the end
[27:15] time and you will have no more argument
[27:18] of whether or not you're able to do it
[27:20] you'll know God called you to do it God
[27:22] equipped you to go it God anointed you
[27:24] to do it and you're more than able to do
[27:26] whatever he said you're able to do I
[27:29] believe in a full surrender to the word
[27:31] in the age that we're living in and the
[27:34] word that we have been spoken over
[27:35] belongs to us I I picked up a little
[27:37] something in our conference here over
[27:39] the weekend I which I want to appreciate
[27:41] your prayers for thought it was very
[27:43] successful the devil come along in a a
[27:45] tornado warning Brother Richard right in
[27:47] the front of the meeting I mean I'm
[27:48] getting ready to walk up to the pulpit
[27:50] there in Branson and tornado sirens are
[27:52] going off and people's phones are going
[27:54] off amen the Tornado by grace of God
[27:57] split and went around us and you seen
[27:59] the devastation it caused but God
[28:01] actually spared us am mean the it was it
[28:04] was quite a it was quite a moment but
[28:06] God spared us amen finally I figured out
[28:09] brother Eric what was happening them
[28:10] them sirens amen that was Devils telling
[28:13] other Devils you better get out of town
[28:15] the children of God are gathered up in a
[28:16] conference the power of God is about to
[28:19] be released listen I'm not running from
[28:21] no devil I think it's time that you
[28:23] realize the devils are running from you
[28:25] amen every time you climb out of bed and
[28:27] put your foot foot upon the amen the
[28:29] Devils begin to scatter because they
[28:31] think what is he going to do today do
[28:34] you know that there's a place that you
[28:35] can live that the devil don't even know
[28:37] what to do with you that you're the
[28:39] children of God he's tried everything
[28:42] he's shot at you every way but you're
[28:44] still standing because you're the Church
[28:47] of the Living God it's it's the will of
[28:49] God that you make it through my is the
[28:52] will of God it's the mystery of his will
[28:54] do you see it when you see it by faith
[28:56] then you're ready to move in to it when
[28:59] you see it your nam's on it you're ready
[29:01] to possess it I'll say it to you like
[29:03] this if you ever had a a rich Uncle to
[29:05] pass away or somebody who has great
[29:08] wealth in a family amen one thing about
[29:10] it amen just toward the everybody gets
[29:12] around them everybody amen got a claim
[29:14] on the on the wealth you know amen amen
[29:17] uncles and distant uncles and three
[29:19] times removed cousins and everybody they
[29:21] going to they're going to claim that
[29:23] wealth you know well I knew I was so and
[29:25] so and so never met them in your life
[29:27] don't know who they are but there's a
[29:28] blood connection somewhere so they're
[29:30] going to lay a claim and and you know
[29:32] maybe at the time of the reading of the
[29:34] wheel amen the room could be full of
[29:36] people everybody's got a opinion about
[29:38] who and what belongs to who you know
[29:40] amen maybe maybe for the 30 days between
[29:43] the time of the death of the time the
[29:45] reading of the wheel there's a lot of
[29:47] different arguments about who what
[29:48] belongs where amen so nobody is taking
[29:51] no cars nobody's emptying bank accounts
[29:53] nobody's moving into houses that really
[29:56] amen saying it belongs to them but
[29:58] they're not sure enough they're not
[30:00] actually moving into things until they
[30:02] know for sure when the wheel is read and
[30:05] that's exactly what the church ages have
[30:07] been that after the death of Christ
[30:09] there was somebody on the wheel amen the
[30:12] inheritors of all things were on that
[30:14] wheel but throughout the church ages man
[30:17] has claimed this and this denomination
[30:19] claims this and they claim this and this
[30:21] part claims this and all of them are
[30:23] claiming things that's why when you come
[30:25] up to the end time everybody's under
[30:27] confusion uson and you got so many
[30:29] people claiming so many things it's
[30:31] right in the end time when these things
[30:33] are happening amen but if you ever
[30:35] noticed amen that under the under the
[30:37] seven seal there was a silence that fell
[30:40] over the Earth amen you think about this
[30:42] amen at the time of the reading of the
[30:44] wheel amen instead of the people saying
[30:47] what belongs to him amen God's going to
[30:50] talk about what belongs to them amen and
[30:52] an executive of the wheel comes in and
[30:55] under the breaking of that wheel he by
[30:58] Authority begins to say well this
[31:00] belongs to this person this belongs to
[31:02] that person and as he's reading the
[31:04] names of those Wheels he has identifying
[31:07] you with a portion of what belongs to
[31:09] you through the power of that death oh I
[31:13] tell you something this morning amen
[31:15] that we have had a real a real reading
[31:17] in the last days and when the book was
[31:20] opened up and a prophet was standing
[31:22] there and he identified irus and
[31:24] Columbus and he identified Paul in the
[31:27] Ephesians but then he come down to the
[31:29] last day and begin to prophesy over a
[31:32] bride that what belonged to the Church
[31:34] of the Living God is Not Just
[31:37] justification or sanctification or
[31:39] baptism of the spirit but we possess him
[31:42] our portion is the fullness of the word
[31:45] that is
[31:47] returned to the church in the last days
[31:50] do you see there's a a reading of the
[31:52] wheel to silence to silence all the
[31:55] voice now now if you heard the reading
[31:57] of the wheel you know your names on it
[31:58] you're ready to move into it and you're
[32:01] not ready to move in until you heard
[32:02] your
[32:03] name is that right when you heard your
[32:06] name then you can move in and I believe
[32:08] I've heard my name I have been
[32:12] identified with these things and God
[32:14] didn't just say it he recorded it put it
[32:16] on tape where I can sit down and remind
[32:19] myself on a constant basis where I
[32:22] belong in the scripture and what belongs
[32:25] to me as a Son of God Amen I many people
[32:28] has heard the word preached they've
[32:29] heard the message but they didn't enter
[32:31] in because of
[32:34] unbelief according to Hebrews chapter 4
[32:37] and verse 2 The Gospel was preached well
[32:39] unto them but they were the word preach
[32:41] did not profit them not being mixed with
[32:44] faith in them that heard it no
[32:47] Revelation in what they were hearing
[32:49] identified it to them do you know
[32:51] Revelation is what makes it your
[32:53] possession when you when it's a
[32:55] revelation to you it's it's yours your
[32:57] you're going to fight for it at that
[32:59] point amen do you see what it is now
[33:01] many people fail to see these things
[33:04] because of the human flesh because of
[33:07] humanity now the flesh is one of the
[33:09] greatest areas and trials of the church
[33:11] that I know of and identified of Christ
[33:14] brother bam said the Gentiles of that
[33:15] day failed to see it because it was in
[33:18] human flesh he said I wonder if we'll
[33:20] make that same mistake today if we'd
[33:23] failed to know him because he was the
[33:24] word for that age was identified in a
[33:26] human body now you think of this when
[33:29] God is doing something he does it in
[33:32] humanity in a human Veil and the people
[33:35] fail to enter in because of the veil
[33:37] that he uses now in identified of Christ
[33:40] brother bam said it like this he said
[33:42] how would you believe this now you that
[33:45] now you know that scripture is made
[33:47] plain he said don't let the veil of
[33:50] Flesh bother you now so if you're not
[33:54] careful because of the veil God uses you
[33:57] can't enter into the promise cuz you say
[33:59] now watch in this age that we're living
[34:01] oh that's just brother brandham that's
[34:02] just a prophet that them people are just
[34:05] manf followers amen but he's standing
[34:07] there manifesting the promises of God
[34:10] exactly to fulfill the scripture that
[34:13] Joshua would come among the church and
[34:16] identify them but if they can make the
[34:18] veil bother you then you'll not enter
[34:21] into the words because of the veil
[34:23] because you'll just well that's just a
[34:24] man that's just this and now that could
[34:26] translate real quick quick to the pull
[34:28] pit but we'll just leave it there amen
[34:30] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[34:32] brother random says it like this you
[34:33] think I'm beside myself but I'm not we
[34:36] have got the devil's
[34:39] answer who's this belong to we got the
[34:43] answer we answered it we've got the
[34:45] answer we don't have to answer it 42
[34:47] times we know who we are we know what
[34:49] belongs to us amen if you we got the
[34:52] answer to it amen now what he says
[34:54] Christ the word is living in me not my
[34:57] idea it's his power not my idea it's his
[35:00] word he promised it here it is he said
[35:02] it would be here and here it is we've
[35:04] got his answer Christ the Risen and paid
[35:07] the price for our Redemption what God in
[35:10] Christ manifested he gave that flesh
[35:14] that and blood that in the blood might
[35:17] come the life and the flesh be redeemed
[35:20] now watch what he says that God in this
[35:23] redeemed flesh could manifest his word
[35:27] for the day as he did in that day Oh
[35:31] Glory do you see what he's saying to you
[35:34] God came in that redeemed flesh to
[35:37] redeem this flesh to work in this flesh
[35:40] the way he did in that flesh to fulfill
[35:42] the word in this day amen I know that's
[35:45] a lot of different fleshes but I I tell
[35:47] you this when you see it you'll become
[35:49] his flesh and it'll be one flesh amen
[35:52] what is it it's Christ could manifest in
[35:54] his word and watch what a prophet says
[35:56] when a man is truly redeemed that
[35:59] predestinated seed sees it and accepts
[36:02] it hey and sins are demolished unbelief
[36:05] is demolished look what he says and when
[36:08] a man is redeemed the predestinated seed
[36:10] sees it accepts it his sins are
[36:11] demolished it's separated see it drops
[36:14] in the ink of the blood of Christ and
[36:16] it's never to be remembered God forgets
[36:18] it he stands up as a son and daughter of
[36:20] God in the presence of God now we are
[36:23] the sons of God not what we will be we
[36:26] are now we are now
[36:32] redeemed we are now
[36:36] redeemed Redeemed by the
[36:39] blood now watch this because when you
[36:42] look at the trial message brother R
[36:43] going tell you something he's telling
[36:45] you the world is looking for nail
[36:47] scars they're looking for the nail scars
[36:50] to see the word in this age brother ROM
[36:52] says but we're not looking for nail
[36:54] scars we're looking for the word
[36:56] manifest amen man God makes a promise of
[36:59] these things and he does it just as he
[37:01] says now when you see it in the Rapture
[37:03] book he said you see him come down and
[37:05] declare himself from the heavens stand
[37:08] before groups of men declare himself the
[37:11] same as he ever did that's the truth the
[37:13] Bible opens you see the opening of that
[37:15] word is not just a man opening scripture
[37:18] and speaking them but it's when a veil
[37:20] of Flesh has been redeemed by the blood
[37:24] that can so manifest the word that
[37:26] you're not seeing Nars but you're seeing
[37:30] Jesus now I don't I don't want to maybe
[37:32] stand up here and see tell you all the
[37:34] things I see but I could use some of the
[37:36] other men and I think some of the men
[37:38] who didn't come into the message saw
[37:40] more than some of the men who are in the
[37:41] message like Tommy Osborne when he stand
[37:44] there and say you know we've all
[37:45] preached Jesus but this man manifested
[37:48] Jesus when Tommy Osborne said I've seen
[37:51] Jesus in a vision then I've seen Jesus
[37:54] in this man well listen when the word is
[37:56] manifested your seen
[37:59] Jesus come on he's prophesied in this
[38:02] age to not be here with us but he's been
[38:05] prophesied to be in us and we are here
[38:09] this morning manifesting the promises of
[38:12] the age we're living in amen that is the
[38:14] promise over your life that is the
[38:17] predestination over your life to see his
[38:19] coming in your own flesh In the Flesh of
[38:22] the Church of the Living God and
[38:25] identification quickening power amen it
[38:28] did it to us and quickening power will
[38:31] let us see his
[38:34] coming take the Holy Ghost to see it now
[38:37] it'll help you see his coming now I want
[38:40] you to see something 1 Thessalonians
[38:41] chapter 4 did Paul preach this or not
[38:44] did he not say in the mystery of the
[38:46] Rapture for the Lord himself shall
[38:47] descend from heaven with a shout now we
[38:50] could preach all morning on the shout
[38:52] but I think we've got it the shout is
[38:54] the message is that right that is a
[38:57] sealed portion of fulfilled word Satan
[39:00] cannot fool with that it's already there
[39:03] whatever he does the message is already
[39:05] preached the message has already got
[39:07] into the church now think of this
[39:10] because if she if this is the shout then
[39:13] there is to be a voice of
[39:15] Resurrection now the Church of the
[39:17] Living God becomes the voice that they
[39:21] hear they become the voice of this
[39:24] message not just in the things they say
[39:27] but in the Declaration of the life that
[39:30] they live that the power that comes in
[39:33] the church amen I I I can I say simply
[39:35] what I'm saying to you that the son of
[39:38] man amen moves into the form of the
[39:41] Bride I challenge you to believe that
[39:44] the son of man is Manifest again today
[39:48] in the form of the Bride but we're so
[39:50] messed up with the veil that we want to
[39:52] keep it all in another age or another
[39:55] time under another Ministry but we're
[39:57] not ready to fight for the reality that
[40:01] God is revealing himself in the form of
[40:04] a bride by the people in the age of the
[40:07] people to the People by the people my
[40:11] goodness if God can manifest in you in
[40:13] the Church of the Living God in order to
[40:16] tear down every barrier if God can
[40:18] manifest in a Kentucky hillbilly in
[40:20] order to tear down every barrier and
[40:23] tell you that if God did it once he can
[40:25] do it again and the church is the place
[40:28] of his appointment this is where he
[40:30] chose a mighty Angel descends from
[40:33] heaven with a shout with a voice in
[40:36] Revelations 10 a mighty Angel comes down
[40:38] out of heaven with a book open a shout
[40:41] is a book
[40:43] open it's a declaration it's a command
[40:46] of an army officer it's a sword
[40:51] drawn and you know he knew the moment he
[40:54] brought that open Word Battle was on
[40:56] brother
[40:58] now I could I could stand here a few
[40:59] minutes but let me just let me just say
[41:01] this to you the moment that something is
[41:03] declared over your life that's when the
[41:05] battle is
[41:07] on you think you have a war let God call
[41:10] you into a Ministry it'll be 10 times
[41:12] worse amen I'm not saying that that you
[41:15] don't have a war I'm just saying that
[41:17] Satan is out to destroy by any means
[41:20] possible anybody who is willing to stand
[41:23] up and say God's promises are true if
[41:26] you'll do it in your home Satan will
[41:28] Target you if you do it in the church
[41:30] Satan will Target you if you do it in
[41:32] the world Satan will Target you are you
[41:34] hearing me amen the bride is the target
[41:38] of Satan the moment the book was open
[41:40] all hell was released against her but
[41:43] when all hell was released all of heaven
[41:46] was released at the same time because
[41:49] everything God has is behind the Church
[41:52] of the Living God taking the promises of
[41:55] this age now I tell you I believe this I
[41:57] believe Satan is trying to keep you from
[41:59] seeing it he don't care if you see God
[42:01] in brother ROM's age or God in Paul's
[42:04] age he cannot stand the fact that you
[42:07] could see that the Revelation has got to
[42:09] move into the church before there could
[42:11] be a change you see if he could keep it
[42:13] out of the church he could then disen
[42:15] the blood if he could keep it out of
[42:17] your life he can diseno the promises of
[42:20] God and the blood of God but I don't
[42:23] know about you but if God said we're
[42:25] able to do it I believe somebody will be
[42:28] past their abilities and the trials of
[42:30] their life and say it ain't nothing but
[42:32] the truth see Satan is trying to keep
[42:35] you from seeing
[42:37] it now watch what brother bam does he
[42:40] says he's trying to keep you from seeing
[42:42] it but as many as received him he gave
[42:45] power to become the sons of God so is it
[42:48] today when we see the great Holy Ghost
[42:51] move made manifest as we receive him to
[42:55] them he gave power to become Sons and
[42:58] Daughters of God that scripture isn't
[43:01] just for the days of Jesus but when you
[43:04] see Jesus in this hour it gives you a
[43:07] reception of something that can manifest
[43:10] now I know I know that you've heard the
[43:12] quote many times in Matthew 16 when he
[43:15] says the gates of hell are against it
[43:18] Peter I give you the keys of the kingdom
[43:20] and you will prevail against it in the
[43:22] gates of hell you will prevail against
[43:24] so the Gates of Hell brother Rand says
[43:26] he says see that's not what the gates of
[43:29] hell is against today he said it's
[43:31] against the spiritual revelation of
[43:33] Christ being here now the same yesterday
[43:37] today and forever the Gates of Hell
[43:39] shall be against it but it shall never
[43:43] Prevail my goodness it shall never
[43:46] Prevail now watch what happens when you
[43:49] take this word and put it in religion it
[43:53] kills it dead
[43:57] power of transformation paragraph 163
[44:00] when you try to take this word of God
[44:02] and put it in the religion of the world
[44:04] you bring death to
[44:06] yourself it kills the subject it kills
[44:08] the person you don't have to believe
[44:11] that see if you if you our church see if
[44:15] it's right then there's the boom that
[44:17] kills you that kills the subject in
[44:19] other words brother B said you take
[44:20] these promises going to a church they
[44:22] said well our church don't believe that
[44:23] he said boom there's what killed you the
[44:26] moment somebody says well we don't
[44:28] believe that and you join the
[44:31] we brother said somebody said to me
[44:34] brother BR we don't believe that who see
[44:36] he said you got a mouse in your pocket
[44:37] we and
[44:39] who he said it ain't you in the Bible he
[44:41] said it's you in that group you're
[44:44] with do you see it amen somebody said
[44:46] well that don't apply to this age Mark
[44:48] 11 ain't good for the church John 14
[44:50] ain't good for the church we're just
[44:52] going to teach a little and believe a
[44:54] little and we're going to go on a
[44:55] Rapture but prophet of God said the
[44:56] moment you do that boom you have died
[44:59] right there in that place that's where
[45:01] you die Amen brother bam says it very
[45:03] clearly he said listen you've got to let
[45:06] everything fall aside take the word only
[45:08] stay right with that word and don't
[45:10] leave when God said it amen I don't care
[45:13] what education can
[45:15] prove my isn't that something they can
[45:17] prove educationally that you shouldn't
[45:20] believe that by the man said don't die
[45:22] with them he said just believe don't
[45:24] care what education can prove amen
[45:27] listen amen I I I know this very for a
[45:29] very fact amen the power of reasoning is
[45:32] the power of
[45:34] death when Satan wanted to grip the
[45:37] entire world in his hand he done it
[45:38] through the power of
[45:40] reasoning is that right amen look at
[45:43] this Amen in paragraph 68 brother R said
[45:45] God by his mighty Prophet seen exactly
[45:48] Vindicated by God and because another
[45:50] Prophet come in with a teaching that is
[45:52] contrary and disputed with Moses and
[45:55] tried to prove to the people people that
[45:57] Moses was
[45:59] wrong isn't that something when when a
[46:02] prophet will preach something and
[46:04] another man anointed will preach
[46:06] something contrary to that amen the
[46:09] prophet of God said look there has to be
[46:11] something wrong with that because Moses
[46:14] was the anointed one to bring the word
[46:17] listen now amen now you can you can
[46:19] switch names all around but it's the
[46:21] same Spirit watch God does God ever
[46:23] change his mind balam a prophet of God
[46:25] he went to B for his information he said
[46:28] but Moses went to God for his
[46:30] information there's the
[46:33] difference B goes to a school to get
[46:36] information B goes to a commentary to
[46:38] get information Moses went to the logos
[46:42] the pillar of fire to get information
[46:45] amen I tell you what the information
[46:47] amen was brought through the logos went
[46:49] out of God the pillar of fire it was the
[46:51] angel of the Covenant Christ the
[46:53] anointed one where was Moses getting
[46:56] this anoint oting his thoughts his
[46:58] information he was getting it from
[47:00] Christ the pillar of fire now it would
[47:02] be one thing if that was just abstract
[47:05] and that was all in another age but in
[47:07] Revelations 10 the Bible said the mighty
[47:09] Angel descended in this age with an open
[47:12] book of information for the Church of
[47:15] the Living God what the prophet was
[47:17] saying about the church was not his
[47:20] intelligence it was a Divine
[47:22] intelligence and I believe it was a
[47:24] crowning Revelation to the Church of the
[47:26] Living God
[47:27] can I say it like this there's nothing
[47:29] going Beyond
[47:31] it I don't believe that you're going to
[47:33] go beyond what this Prophet taught now
[47:35] can we can we hit a giant right here
[47:37] y'all ready to kill a giant amen there
[47:39] are giants in the land of
[47:43] Revelation there's Giants in that land
[47:46] but it's the land the bride was promised
[47:48] she was promised a land of revelation of
[47:51] Truth and prosperity through Revelation
[47:54] that was the way the whole church was
[47:55] built was on Revelation
[47:57] but in the land of Revelation
[47:59] intellectual Giants have grew up and
[48:01] they have taken things and compared
[48:03] things intellectually and made a
[48:05] fanaticism and an education out of
[48:07] divine
[48:09] revelation it's a giant in this age
[48:11] friends and then because of it other
[48:14] people amen they say well just take play
[48:16] the tapes only we don't need any
[48:18] Revelation other people they get to
[48:20] teach in other directions and they say
[48:21] well I I think I think I I knew a group
[48:24] one time they said well we read the
[48:25] church AE book one time and we're
[48:27] finished with it and I thought well you
[48:29] can
[48:31] tell you can tell amen they let any old
[48:34] spirit in they have no barriers
[48:36] whatsoever amen if you read that church
[48:38] age book brother Bram trails that
[48:39] serpent through church ecclesiastical
[48:42] Spirits he outlines nickis he outlines
[48:45] the looseness and traditions of man he
[48:47] shows you how what pastors should be and
[48:49] how they should act and how churches
[48:51] should be set up but if you're not
[48:53] interested in a divine order amen just
[48:56] read it one time set it
[48:57] aside then you ain't got to be see then
[48:59] you're not responsible but I want you to
[49:01] see something they I I I grew up with
[49:03] this just say what the prophet said but
[49:05] I found out they didn't mean
[49:07] it cuz when I started preaching the
[49:09] revelation of the son of man they didn't
[49:11] know he said
[49:14] it because they had picked out what part
[49:16] we could
[49:18] say now I'm just a little bit odd I
[49:21] believe whatever God leads your soul to
[49:22] believe if you can see it in the message
[49:24] go ahead and possess it and it don't
[49:26] matter what anybody says we can or can't
[49:28] have it is a giant on that land mhm it's
[49:33] on the giant is on the land of
[49:34] Revelation so therefore because there is
[49:36] fanaticism in the land of Revelation
[49:38] there are many who don't enter in
[49:41] because of the
[49:42] giant you see it amen it's back in the
[49:45] Old Testament they didn't even go into
[49:47] the land at all because of the giant but
[49:50] because they didn't go into the land
[49:52] they didn't possess what belonged to
[49:53] them they should have killed the Giant
[49:57] and possess the
[49:59] land you said preacher what are you
[50:01] saying I'm saying that giant is there of
[50:03] intellectual and formalism and just
[50:05] studying and learning but you got other
[50:07] guys who won't even study the message
[50:09] and they oh God have mercy I'm going to
[50:11] get in trouble for sure they come the
[50:13] pull pit and they'll say well I hadn't
[50:14] studied any I'm just waiting on
[50:15] inspiration and I'm sitting on the front
[50:17] row going I can
[50:19] tell I couldn't tell I could tell there
[50:22] was nothing put in it there's no heart
[50:24] in it there's no study in it there's no
[50:25] word in it and brother random told us he
[50:27] said the first sermon I ever preached he
[50:29] said I had everybody shouting he said I
[50:31] was crying we were emotional mess walked
[50:33] out and looked at the old pastor and
[50:34] said how' that go he said the worst
[50:36] sermon I ever
[50:38] heard he said what are you talking about
[50:41] he said well you out everybody emotional
[50:42] he said but you didn't put down no word
[50:45] he said I don't care how much emotion
[50:46] you get if the word ain't behind it you
[50:48] got no case and your case has got to be
[50:50] built on the word really We Are
[50:53] Spiritual lawyers and there ought to be
[50:54] a case for what we're saying and there
[50:57] order to be a word-based case amen if
[50:59] you get the word in it's line and its
[51:01] order the devil has no legal right to
[51:05] remain on the property that God gave us
[51:07] because God is the way hey I I believe
[51:10] it I really do now I know we don't have
[51:12] that problem here but I'm just telling
[51:14] you it's a giant in the land now if you
[51:16] think about the giant if you think about
[51:18] the Giants of that land in that land it
[51:19] was called Giants but remember Caleb
[51:21] said it was bread remember that he said
[51:23] the giant is bread in other words it's
[51:26] not no wory to me well in the age we're
[51:29] living in we call them Giants but really
[51:31] they're
[51:33] scarecrows Giants have become scarecrows
[51:36] in my age oh don't you get around that
[51:39] seven Thunder teachings don't you get
[51:41] around what do y'all know something
[51:43] brother Randon was the originator of a
[51:45] seven Thunder
[51:46] message come on church amen I can't help
[51:49] what anybody done with a message after
[51:51] brother bam preached it but don't tell
[51:53] me not to preach the revelation of the
[51:55] seven Thunders because somebody else
[51:57] done something with it I don't know what
[51:59] they've done with the Revelation but
[52:01] it's the revelation of the hour it'll
[52:03] create perfect Faith it'll give you
[52:05] Grace for Rapture it'll create Revival
[52:08] in the bride and ain't nothing but a
[52:09] scarecrow trying to keep you off of some
[52:12] of the greatest
[52:14] word come on church I know how it is
[52:17] y'all stay away from that revelation of
[52:18] the son of man you're going to get
[52:19] messed up and people believe in that
[52:21] peria stuff and they get all messed up
[52:23] well let me tell you peria is only a
[52:25] Greek word for his presence
[52:27] and if you ain't figured out this is the
[52:29] presence of God you ain't you ain't been
[52:31] sincere yet because this is the divine
[52:34] presence of almighty God and is coming
[52:36] to this age we don't have to have the
[52:38] spirit of the Peruan teachers to believe
[52:41] perusia is the presence of God it is the
[52:45] dissension of a mighty Angel come on
[52:48] Church we're not just believing Christ
[52:50] is here this morning we believe he's
[52:52] here in the form of a bride manifesting
[52:55] every word
[52:58] I know those scarecrows are laying there
[53:00] that scarecrow is all over good
[53:02] teachings amen but I am not going to let
[53:04] a giant keep me out of the land of the
[53:07] promises of the word of God so amen one
[53:09] guy come up to me said brother Wayne you
[53:11] can't preach that Ancient of Days amen
[53:13] out of Daniel 7 is that cloud out there
[53:16] in sunset Mountain I said I
[53:18] can't he said no I don't see how that
[53:21] ties together at all I said well I don't
[53:23] need you to see it brother I see it just
[53:25] fine
[53:27] and just because somebody is blinded to
[53:29] what God has did don't mean God put
[53:31] Shackles on my eyes but when he gave it
[53:34] to me and let me see it in the word I've
[53:37] got to write by the grace of God to
[53:39] preach the message of the hour if I got
[53:41] to preach it on a rock on the side of a
[53:43] creek by myself but by the grace of God
[53:47] God has gave us a good church and a good
[53:49] pastor and a good congregation who's
[53:51] ready to take the lands of promise
[53:57] we ain't scared come on
[54:00] Church you might fool me but you can't
[54:02] deceive me you might take a quote and
[54:04] use it wrong but it won't hold me long
[54:06] Amen in Matthew 24:24 it said the
[54:08] deceive the elect if it were possible
[54:11] but it is not possible to deceive the
[54:13] elect of God we going to come out of
[54:21] it well glory to God
[54:26] you know what creation's waiting on
[54:29] you waiting on somebody that'll walk
[54:31] over the Giants to preach the promise
[54:34] waiting on somebody that will ignore
[54:36] every scarecrow and believe the word of
[54:38] God somebody will put a sword in their
[54:40] hand and fight for the land that God
[54:42] gave him this message is right the
[54:45] doctrines are true it's worth preaching
[54:48] it's worth believing it's the hour that
[54:50] we're living in I know I know what
[54:52] Satan's trying to do he's trying to
[54:54] reason you out of these things
[54:57] things isn't it reasonable that we
[55:01] should be preaching about the first
[55:02] coming instead of the
[55:04] second isn't it reasonable that we
[55:06] should preach more about the blood than
[55:08] we do about the things in this age
[55:10] and isn't it
[55:13] reasonable think about this isn't it
[55:15] reasonable that if we just left off
[55:17] serpent seed and and water baptism we
[55:20] just taught some some more fundamental
[55:22] things and and we didn't have to talk
[55:24] about brother you can say what brother R
[55:25] says but just don't quote him you
[55:34] know now I carrying the
[55:37] sword I seen brother R is okay if I
[55:40] preach I Brother s I've seen these bunch
[55:43] of cowards they can quote Charles
[55:46] Spurgeon oh Spurgeon said that all over
[55:48] the Facebook all over the Internet
[55:50] Charles Spurgeon this and Charles
[55:52] Spurgeon that well they ain't going to
[55:53] put the rest of what Charles Spurgeon
[55:55] said when he said I want to go home
[55:56] smoke a cigar it's incense them to God
[55:59] or in the days of Charles Spurgeon when
[56:00] they put out amen be like the be like
[56:03] your preacher your favorite preacher and
[56:04] trying to give the kids bubblegum cigars
[56:07] where you can be a theologian not have
[56:08] the
[56:10] cough yeah you're going to quote that
[56:15] guy but ain't got for sing to quote a
[56:17] prophet of God that lived an infallible
[56:20] life of Jesus Christ in the age we're
[56:22] living in but I don't know about you
[56:24] amen but the land I have is a current
[56:27] message in a current age and every devil
[56:30] of Hell might be against it but brother
[56:32] we'll fight through it we'll fight
[56:35] through every line of it until the
[56:37] promises of God are
[56:39] preached
[56:41] my Satan is reasoned with him he's
[56:43] reasoned against the word of God that's
[56:45] what he done he said that's the same
[56:47] thing the devil does
[56:50] today every heartache every sickness
[56:53] every death every little sick baby every
[56:55] grave only heals side was just believe
[56:58] disbelieve one little word not exactly
[57:01] throw it out just misquote it and reason
[57:05] it boy don't just throw it out just
[57:08] reason it a little bit now when someone
[57:12] says to you well I tell you I got a
[57:16] little reason you shouldn't believe what
[57:17] brother Ram said here well let let let
[57:20] me just read what he said separate
[57:22] yourself and come out of it one thing I
[57:24] want you to notice he he said he obeyed
[57:27] Abraham obey God's word to the letter
[57:29] always remember that's my message you
[57:32] must obey the word knowing anything
[57:35] contrary to it leave it alone it may
[57:38] look good but don't reason against God's
[57:40] word the first thing Satan did was
[57:43] reason against God's word and Eve she
[57:46] never doubted it she never she never
[57:48] doubted it she just reasoned it Satan
[57:52] reasoned it and that's the way he does
[57:54] today
[57:56] if isn't it reasonable that we should do
[57:59] this isn't it reasonable if it's against
[58:03] God's word leave it
[58:06] alone it's the voice of
[58:10] Satan Mercy people say they never
[58:12] haven't heard the Devil talk to them you
[58:14] haven't when that little girl standing
[58:16] there telling you it's okay to cut your
[58:17] hair isn't it reasonable that you could
[58:19] just put on a little bit of this makeup
[58:21] and cut your hair and look like the rest
[58:22] of every world isn't it reasonable it
[58:25] ain't nothing but the voice of the the
[58:27] devil come on you can identify it there
[58:29] easily but identify it over here where a
[58:32] prophet of God said that if you say unto
[58:34] this mountain greater is he that is in
[58:37] you and is he is in this world your
[58:39] deity standing in SHO leather that this
[58:42] is the age of the coming of the Lord in
[58:44] the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:47] any voice that will reason against that
[58:49] is the voice of Satan trying to distort
[58:53] and tear down the promises that God has
[58:55] anointed Ed you in this age let the word
[58:59] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[59:01] you listen get all these Creeds out get
[59:03] away from it and hold to the word of God
[59:05] because it's Christ and it will manifest
[59:10] itself now you said preacher who who
[59:13] would listen to reasoning people that's
[59:15] not born of God brother Bram said if a
[59:18] man is born to the spirit of God he
[59:20] doesn't listen to reason at
[59:23] all God cannot be reasoned with
[59:27] believed see not AB the shock he said
[59:29] therefore the word is to be fulfilled in
[59:31] this day it's the same part of the word
[59:34] that was fulfilled in that day then what
[59:35] is it this Bride is a word
[59:39] bride do you see that and something has
[59:41] been opened up to you it's a new land
[59:44] that's been opened to you what did he do
[59:46] he opened the Seven Seals and opened a
[59:48] new land for the church to come into as
[59:50] an inheritance the reason other
[59:53] Ministries didn't preach it in other
[59:55] ages because it wasn't
[59:59] opened it would be like asking why did
[1:00:02] the people not live in there in the time
[1:00:04] of pharaoh when he had them down in
[1:00:06] Egypt and they're and and and you're
[1:00:07] moving in the promises and Caleb is
[1:00:09] saying that's our land that's our
[1:00:10] mountain and somebody saying well yeah
[1:00:12] yeah but why didn't our forefathers live
[1:00:14] in
[1:00:15] here it's because it wasn't open to
[1:00:19] them but it's become open to the church
[1:00:21] in the last days it God opened the
[1:00:25] borders
[1:00:26] he opened the word that would release
[1:00:29] the church to move in and possess
[1:00:31] whatever that God would give to them
[1:00:33] they must be that word bride amen I love
[1:00:37] this they got to be that word bride so
[1:00:40] well I I believe all that word but a
[1:00:42] part of it now watch what he says Eve
[1:00:44] only failed on One
[1:00:47] Promise she only failed on One Promise
[1:00:49] the temptation of the enemy to face and
[1:00:51] now the people that's called for his
[1:00:53] name now the people that's called for
[1:00:55] his name name amen does that sound
[1:00:57] familiar the people that know God shall
[1:00:59] do great exploits the people that are
[1:01:02] called by his name look what he's saying
[1:01:04] of course it's his bride she has come
[1:01:07] into contact Again by the same thing not
[1:01:10] by denominational truth but by every
[1:01:13] word you see what it is we've come back
[1:01:15] in contact with every word now if God
[1:01:18] has gave to us every word and that is
[1:01:21] our possession every thing every promise
[1:01:24] is ours let's make it a land again
[1:01:26] it is a land you're going into and if
[1:01:28] God gave that to you you're going to
[1:01:30] have to hold that
[1:01:32] land you're going to have to hold it
[1:01:34] you're going to have to you're going to
[1:01:35] have to know how to possess that land I
[1:01:39] can tell you that it's yours but if you
[1:01:41] don't have a sword and an ability to
[1:01:43] fight a giant you ain't going to hold it
[1:01:46] Andy now watch brother randam says it
[1:01:47] like this he says you see you got to
[1:01:49] know it's a battle I believe we could
[1:01:52] say that this morning it's a battle and
[1:01:55] you got to know your enemy and you've
[1:01:57] got to know your armor your armor is the
[1:02:00] word and your enemy is anything that
[1:02:02] will reason against
[1:02:04] it now the voice of God watch the voice
[1:02:07] of God if any other voices are contrary
[1:02:10] to the voice of God it is the voice of
[1:02:12] the enemy to confuse us that we would
[1:02:15] not understand the voice of God when it
[1:02:17] spoke now many people don't think well
[1:02:18] if Satan would reason how successful
[1:02:20] would that be but he says the see listen
[1:02:23] he said remember Satan had a marvelous
[1:02:25] success
[1:02:26] and carrying out his threats of sitting
[1:02:28] on the throne but he did this amen by
[1:02:31] explaining away the word the value of
[1:02:34] the word in every
[1:02:35] age so what Satan's doing is trying to
[1:02:38] explain away the value of the word if
[1:02:40] God says something will be that way what
[1:02:43] value does that have to you what what is
[1:02:46] the value of that word that has been
[1:02:49] spoken over you if it was spoken by
[1:02:52] omnipotent it is omnipotent power to the
[1:02:54] person that it's been given given to you
[1:02:56] have received power of the spoken word
[1:02:59] over your life and then God fortifies
[1:03:01] that word by the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost causing you to believe that word
[1:03:06] and nothing can get in I know I know
[1:03:09] that it's an age of I know it's a great
[1:03:11] age and our our soul I mean how many how
[1:03:13] many people got born again in here this
[1:03:14] morning your soul you you're born
[1:03:16] again Amen Let me let me try to bring it
[1:03:19] to a connection here your soul has been
[1:03:22] born again but you're operating with 10
[1:03:25] senses that are are not
[1:03:27] saved right would that be would that be
[1:03:29] fair to say that you have 10 senses
[1:03:32] that's not saved so you got 10 Gates
[1:03:35] that the enemy would come into the
[1:03:37] possession of the Soul so the soul
[1:03:38] possesses something and there's 10 gates
[1:03:41] to war against that Soul so so even
[1:03:46] though you're saved Amen to think that
[1:03:48] there would be a day when you don't have
[1:03:50] to battle is a sad mistake to think that
[1:03:53] you don't need to teach our young people
[1:03:55] how to war against the enemy it's a sad
[1:03:57] mistake because they are constantly
[1:04:00] under a battle and because they're under
[1:04:03] a battle Satan tells them you're in the
[1:04:05] wrong place or you're not even a
[1:04:06] Christian yet or you must not believe or
[1:04:08] you wouldn't be having these battles but
[1:04:10] it's contrary to that the real truth of
[1:04:13] the matter is the soul is saved and
[1:04:16] Satan is attacking from every gate that
[1:04:18] he can get
[1:04:20] to to dispossess you of the promise that
[1:04:23] God has made to you listen to the
[1:04:25] prophet in the greatest battle ever
[1:04:27] fought he said that's what's matter with
[1:04:28] our Pentecostal faith today we've left
[1:04:30] too many things to hinder it the faith
[1:04:32] that has been taught by the Holy Spirit
[1:04:34] has been living in us we've let too many
[1:04:36] things looking at somebody else oh my
[1:04:40] the devil's always trying to point at
[1:04:42] somebody's
[1:04:44] failure now Satan is trying to hinder
[1:04:47] Faith by pointing to a failure that's
[1:04:50] his purpose amen but why won't he point
[1:04:52] at the real
[1:04:54] thing you point at the failures but I
[1:04:57] got another hundred to point out that
[1:04:59] are the real
[1:05:00] thing somebody come up to me here long
[1:05:02] night is a as a preacher actually and he
[1:05:05] was a little anti- emotional he said
[1:05:07] well there's a bunch of them went to a
[1:05:08] PO to an altar and they were praying
[1:05:10] through and he goes through all this
[1:05:11] thing that they were doing and he said
[1:05:13] now where all of them at now and he was
[1:05:14] making cuz two or three of them had lost
[1:05:16] and some of the kids went back to the
[1:05:17] world where they all at now like it do
[1:05:19] no good you know I said well I said the
[1:05:21] ones that got something still with
[1:05:24] us why you want to focus on the ones
[1:05:26] that left why not focus on the one that
[1:05:28] stayed why you got to focus on Amen well
[1:05:31] nobody got nothing yeah somebody got
[1:05:33] something amen it was just the others
[1:05:35] didn't get it but we're going to focus
[1:05:37] on the one that didn't come on Church
[1:05:39] why don't we focus on where it
[1:05:43] works if you want to point out something
[1:05:45] they want to point out brother randam
[1:05:46] miscounted the number of people that
[1:05:49] were standing in the congregation when
[1:05:51] the pillar of fire came why you want to
[1:05:53] point out the number of the people why
[1:05:54] not really point out the pillar of fire
[1:05:56] really
[1:05:57] came well you can't prove a bridge fail
[1:06:00] well amen let me tell you this why not
[1:06:02] point out things that can be proven to
[1:06:04] figure out whether or not it is God if
[1:06:06] you would if a person was sincere that's
[1:06:08] what they would do they would look for
[1:06:10] evidence that prove something rather
[1:06:12] than evidence that would disprove
[1:06:14] it now you know I'm telling you the
[1:06:16] truth amen if you stand here today and
[1:06:18] bring start bringing evidences of people
[1:06:20] genuine Holy Ghost Field people amen
[1:06:23] that survived years amen well holy ghost
[1:06:25] don't hold people well why don't we use
[1:06:27] brother Ericson as an example and then
[1:06:29] you tell me that it don't hold somebody
[1:06:31] why don't we use brother Dallas for an
[1:06:32] example and then tell me Oh Brother come
[1:06:34] on we could just keep going through here
[1:06:36] what about brother Roman over there amen
[1:06:38] why not an example why not take those
[1:06:40] examples instead of a I tell you why cuz
[1:06:43] Satan's Waring on you and he's trying to
[1:06:45] get you to leave the land of the baptism
[1:06:47] of the Holy Ghost as an
[1:06:52] answer amen the prophet of God watch
[1:06:54] what he said he said it must be accepted
[1:06:56] in the mind then believe with the heart
[1:06:58] then the word of God becomes a
[1:07:00] reality every sense of the soul and the
[1:07:03] body is scared out with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:05] he said then your sinense your
[1:07:07] conscience of God and everything that's
[1:07:09] Godly flows through you and there's no
[1:07:11] doubt nowhere there's nothing that can
[1:07:13] rise up now what what he's saying if you
[1:07:15] purge that life with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:17] there's nothing that can rise up he said
[1:07:19] but then there's nothing can come up in
[1:07:21] that memory well I remember Sister Jones
[1:07:23] tried to trust the Lord and she
[1:07:26] uh Mr doe uh Miss doe tried to trust God
[1:07:29] for healing one time she failed but if
[1:07:32] that channel has been cleared out and
[1:07:33] purged and been filled on the inside
[1:07:35] with the Holy Spirit see that don't even
[1:07:38] come in a memory no matter what Miss
[1:07:40] Jones did or didn't do it's you and God
[1:07:43] together and nobody else but you two
[1:07:45] there you are now watch there's the
[1:07:48] battle kill him at the
[1:07:51] beginning stop him dead in his tracks if
[1:07:55] it ain't it ain't how long you can make
[1:07:58] the war
[1:07:59] linger it stop it right
[1:08:02] now when you begin to believe for
[1:08:04] something and a devil starts speaking to
[1:08:07] you don't argue all day or all week with
[1:08:10] that devil take the word and cut his
[1:08:12] head
[1:08:13] off right then stop the battle right
[1:08:16] then the word said and then you'll find
[1:08:18] the value of the word you'll find the
[1:08:20] word has the power to blow the devil out
[1:08:22] wherever you can place his word listen
[1:08:25] you got to throw it aside brother man
[1:08:26] said see now watch if you come and you
[1:08:28] keep them memories and conscience and
[1:08:30] everything I might fail I might not be
[1:08:32] right he said don't you do
[1:08:34] that I might fail I might not be right
[1:08:37] do you see what he's saying you throw
[1:08:39] aside and open up the channel and say
[1:08:42] God your word is eternally true it's for
[1:08:45] me if the whole church fails if the
[1:08:48] whole world fails I can't fail because
[1:08:51] I'm taking your word that's the battle
[1:08:55] said preacher what are you saying I'm
[1:08:56] saying that a prophet is teaching you
[1:08:58] how to war he's teaching you as a son
[1:09:01] and a daughter of God that your soul has
[1:09:04] received Christ but the gates of your
[1:09:07] conscience and your spirit amen the
[1:09:09] enemy is constantly going to attack
[1:09:11] through those channels but you got to
[1:09:13] ride as a child of God to cut that devil
[1:09:15] off now now I I say this to you you got
[1:09:18] to learn to
[1:09:20] war now I know seems like in this age
[1:09:23] that we're in now that it it turn turns
[1:09:25] people's stomachs a little bit to war
[1:09:28] people don't really want to they don't
[1:09:29] really want the battle they don't want
[1:09:30] to fight they seem like they turn ya and
[1:09:32] walk away listen let me tell you if
[1:09:35] you're going to remain in this you're
[1:09:36] going to have to learn to war you're
[1:09:38] going to have to learn to pick up your
[1:09:39] sword and war against this enemy or you
[1:09:42] will be defeated in this time that we're
[1:09:44] living in there is no place where you
[1:09:47] are are put where you're not going to
[1:09:49] war there's a giant on every land
[1:09:51] there's a there's a scarecrow in every
[1:09:53] area there's something to come in every
[1:09:55] place you said well preacher I don't
[1:09:56] know can can can I take a few minutes in
[1:09:58] the scripture with you amen I want you
[1:10:00] to watch this because in the days of
[1:10:02] Joshua when he led the children of
[1:10:04] Israel over when he brought the children
[1:10:06] of Israel into their land and they
[1:10:08] possessed that land do you all realize
[1:10:10] that not every giant was killed do you
[1:10:13] know that not every bit of the people
[1:10:15] were moved out of that
[1:10:17] land it's the truth and after Joshua was
[1:10:21] dead and gone amen God did not push away
[1:10:25] all all of the Giants or all of the
[1:10:28] people that were living in the same land
[1:10:29] they were promising in so somebody said
[1:10:31] well God must not have loved them or or
[1:10:33] the land would have be completely
[1:10:34] cleared but do you know it says over
[1:10:36] here in judges the 2 chapter he said I
[1:10:38] did not drive out from before them the
[1:10:40] Nations that Joshua left when he died
[1:10:42] and though I may prove Israel whether
[1:10:44] they keep the way of the Lord to walk
[1:10:46] into him as the fathers did it or not
[1:10:48] therefore the Lord left these nations
[1:10:50] without driving them out neither he into
[1:10:53] the land of the hand of Joshua these are
[1:10:55] the nations in which the Lord left to
[1:10:57] prove Israel by them even as many of
[1:11:00] Israel had had not known all the wars of
[1:11:03] Canaan only the generations of the
[1:11:05] children of Israel might know to teach
[1:11:08] them War at least such as before knew
[1:11:11] nothing thereof and Joshua Judges the
[1:11:14] third chapter the 2 verse God says he
[1:11:17] left the Philistines in the land the
[1:11:19] promise to teach the generation after
[1:11:22] Joshua who wasn't in the first Wars of
[1:11:25] Canaan how to war now you ask yourself
[1:11:28] this question why after the baptism of
[1:11:31] the Holy Ghost would you still have to
[1:11:33] deal with reason and affection and
[1:11:35] conscience and feelings why would all
[1:11:37] these Gates still be why would all these
[1:11:39] enemies still be in this land god is
[1:11:42] teaching you to war he's teaching you
[1:11:44] how to pick up your sword and war
[1:11:48] against that devil listen you're not
[1:11:50] going into this land without knowing how
[1:11:52] to war
[1:11:56] I tell you I when I was sitting here
[1:11:58] reading that last night I hear that
[1:11:59] Prophet saying you got to pick up that
[1:12:01] sword and you got to cut that Spirit you
[1:12:04] got to do this what is it it's a it's a
[1:12:06] general of an army teaching a church how
[1:12:09] to war after he's long gone after he's
[1:12:13] off the scene he has left something to
[1:12:15] you to teach you to war you know what
[1:12:17] teach means it means to train right he's
[1:12:20] training the church and I'm sitting here
[1:12:22] listening to this tap greatest battle
[1:12:23] ever fought and brother man says in the
[1:12:25] middle of it he says see the reason I'm
[1:12:27] preaching this this morning is my dream
[1:12:29] with 6 second Smith my trainer y'all
[1:12:32] remember that he said look I'm preaching
[1:12:34] this for you because of that dream with
[1:12:37] my trainer here is a prophet training a
[1:12:40] church to be able to go to war with the
[1:12:43] devil long after he's off of the scene
[1:12:46] there's a church that still knows how to
[1:12:48] war they know how to defeat Satan
[1:12:51] anywhere any place anytime on any land
[1:12:54] because they know it belongs to
[1:12:57] them I know I know how the devil works I
[1:13:00] know how the devil worship will teach
[1:13:02] them how to War I don't want to fight
[1:13:04] well listen if you don't want to fight
[1:13:05] amen you can sit in the ring of
[1:13:07] observation and watch the war but men
[1:13:09] better than you are giving you the
[1:13:11] Liberty that you're experiencing amen
[1:13:13] men who are willing to put their their
[1:13:16] shoulder to the wheel and fight against
[1:13:18] this devil there's no place in this for
[1:13:20] a coward there's no place in this for
[1:13:22] somebody that won't pick up their sword
[1:13:25] and defeat this devil and stand against
[1:13:27] this devil I believe we've got young men
[1:13:30] and women here we've got young people
[1:13:32] that's willing to fight this fight of
[1:13:35] faith in this hour and they learned to
[1:13:37] war they've learned to go against this
[1:13:40] enemy in this age I know how the devil
[1:13:42] does it's a mind battle on every hand
[1:13:45] it's a trouble on every hand amen but we
[1:13:47] will not we will not let Satan move into
[1:13:50] our conscience or our memory or our
[1:13:52] reasing we will cut them off we will cut
[1:13:55] them off do you know that Joshua amen
[1:13:58] actually LED children of Israel into
[1:14:01] that
[1:14:02] land he led Children of Children of Men
[1:14:05] Who were called Old fighters who
[1:14:07] wouldn't fight isn't that the oddest
[1:14:10] thing the Bible called when the old
[1:14:11] Fighters died off he said then they went
[1:14:14] in the land I was thinking about it last
[1:14:15] night I thought old Fighters we're want
[1:14:17] people to fight and he's let old
[1:14:19] Fighters die off and I thought what's
[1:14:20] the difference I'll tell you the
[1:14:22] difference they fought one another they
[1:14:24] fought Israel they fought Moses they
[1:14:26] fought with God they didn't want to
[1:14:28] fight with their Giants they wanted to
[1:14:29] fight with the word they wanted to
[1:14:31] wrestle against the promises amen and
[1:14:33] when all of that was gone there was a
[1:14:35] children that didn't want to fight with
[1:14:37] God they wanted God on their side to
[1:14:39] fight with that enemy and I believe
[1:14:41] that's where we are in this age I
[1:14:43] believe the young people and the people
[1:14:45] of this age have come to a place they're
[1:14:47] tired of fighting with one another
[1:14:49] they're tired of fighting for position
[1:14:51] in the church and little jealous Spirits
[1:14:53] floating around and I won Fist and I
[1:14:55] won't fight and this is my land and this
[1:14:57] is come on church I think somebody's
[1:14:59] tired of fighting the quotes somebody's
[1:15:02] tired of hearing brother random say it
[1:15:04] one way and we got to explain it way I
[1:15:06] believe somebody somewhere is ready to
[1:15:09] believe every word of this message and
[1:15:12] move in by the promises of
[1:15:15] God I believe it I believe it I believe
[1:15:18] you said well preacher I want to move
[1:15:19] forward you know you can't go any
[1:15:21] forward to get Egypt off of you
[1:15:25] I was just studying I I I'm sorry if I
[1:15:27] got too much I'm going to preach instead
[1:15:29] of read it to you but I'll say it I'll
[1:15:30] say it to you like this amen those
[1:15:32] people came up to such a place that they
[1:15:35] had to change something to go any
[1:15:37] further if you read the Old Testament
[1:15:40] and see how in Joshua when they come up
[1:15:42] to the promises of God and they was
[1:15:44] getting ready to go in the generation
[1:15:46] that had grew up in the wilderness amen
[1:15:48] do you know that they had never been
[1:15:51] circumcised I thought about this the
[1:15:53] other day 40 years amen they had been in
[1:15:56] the wilderness under a covenant of God
[1:15:58] and had never even been circumcised I
[1:16:01] thought what exactly does that mean
[1:16:03] think about this that the the Covenant
[1:16:06] amen was no longer in their flesh amen
[1:16:09] the Covenant of God was not being with
[1:16:11] there was no difference in that
[1:16:13] generation than the others but the
[1:16:15] moment that God got ready to carry them
[1:16:17] in the land and Joshua the fifth chapter
[1:16:20] he lined them up on the banks of Jos of
[1:16:22] gilgal and he said to them joshu jhua
[1:16:25] you circumcised them all before this can
[1:16:28] go any further we've got to circumcise
[1:16:31] this generation now I want you to watch
[1:16:33] what happens the Bible said when he
[1:16:35] circumcised them that he rolled the
[1:16:38] reproach of Egypt off of
[1:16:41] them oh
[1:16:44] God I I I I don't want to get too
[1:16:46] physical here but I want you to
[1:16:48] understand that was in their flesh
[1:16:49] brother Tom the circumcised was in their
[1:16:52] flesh and as long as they wasn't
[1:16:54] circumcised they were constantly
[1:16:56] reminded of the failure of their fathers
[1:16:59] of the curse of not going over of
[1:17:01] leaving the land and inhabited because
[1:17:03] of giants but the moment God circumcised
[1:17:07] them he rolled away the reproach of the
[1:17:10] failure and the unbelief and the
[1:17:12] troubles and they position themselves
[1:17:15] aresh in the Holy Ghost oh God I thank
[1:17:18] God this morning there is a circumcised
[1:17:21] Church of the Living God that has come
[1:17:23] under the message of the hour and is
[1:17:26] ready to press in my
[1:17:32] Lord oh brother they're going to press
[1:17:34] in they're going to they're going to
[1:17:35] move in Heen let me tell you something
[1:17:38] God God done something for them brother
[1:17:40] Howard he didn't just lead them in the
[1:17:41] land he taught him to
[1:17:44] war he didn't lead him in the land and
[1:17:47] lead him harmless and and and and and
[1:17:49] result to every beast of the field he
[1:17:50] taught them to war so how do he teach
[1:17:53] them to war go to the book of I wish I
[1:17:55] had time to read this but if you go to
[1:17:56] the Book of Joshua and you read the
[1:17:58] fifth chapter and you see the
[1:18:00] circumcision of Israel the very next
[1:18:03] chapter in Joshua 6 you'll see that that
[1:18:06] Joshua comes to a possession of the land
[1:18:09] of Jericho and it's a walled City and he
[1:18:13] has no military knowledge to destroy
[1:18:16] that City he does not know how to bring
[1:18:19] that wall down he has no capacity to do
[1:18:23] it so he goes to the teacher he goes to
[1:18:27] the captain of the host and God descends
[1:18:30] like a mighty Angel and when he meets
[1:18:33] him in his presence he said I have come
[1:18:36] down as the captain of the host oh it
[1:18:39] was almighty God but he would coming as
[1:18:41] a
[1:18:44] captain Oh my he was coming as a captain
[1:18:48] to tell him how to deal with the battles
[1:18:50] that they were facing of Jericho now I
[1:18:52] want you to see something powerful right
[1:18:54] here he taught them to war but when God
[1:18:57] taught Israel to war he never separated
[1:19:00] warship from
[1:19:01] war god taught them war and warship move
[1:19:05] together with the Church of the Living
[1:19:07] God I know that you that went to the
[1:19:09] Army they never taught you trumpets or
[1:19:11] it never taught you to shout and rejoice
[1:19:14] when you're in the battle but when God
[1:19:15] came to Joshua he taught him that you
[1:19:18] can walk down the Walls is that right he
[1:19:21] taught him that you can take walls down
[1:19:24] if you You' do it 6 Ines at a time amen
[1:19:27] 6 Ines at a time he he would take a take
[1:19:30] off walking around the around the around
[1:19:32] those walls and by Vision now he's being
[1:19:34] taught by God to walk around these walls
[1:19:36] and he did it one time a day is that
[1:19:39] right and he did it under quietness amen
[1:19:42] which is I be honest with you as big a
[1:19:44] miracle as the walls coming down it was
[1:19:46] a miracle that he kept that bunch of
[1:19:47] Holy Ghost people quiet for six
[1:19:53] days he done sh with them these walls
[1:19:55] are coming down I know some of you
[1:19:57] sisters you'd have had a hard time doing
[1:20:01] it you'd
[1:20:07] been I know I know he's laughing but
[1:20:10] he's the biggest duck in the
[1:20:13] puddle you it'd be a miracle to keep
[1:20:15] y'all quiet for six days knowing that
[1:20:19] was but look he's teaching them to war
[1:20:21] in that land different than the other
[1:20:23] lands when they come over the Red Sea
[1:20:26] y'all know this when they come over the
[1:20:27] Red Sea it was after the Red Sea victory
[1:20:30] that they danced and rejoiced and had a
[1:20:32] wonderful time but in the land of
[1:20:35] promise he was teaching them to war and
[1:20:37] he was saying that before the walls ever
[1:20:40] fail you're going to be walking and in
[1:20:43] this walk it's going to develop into a
[1:20:45] worship and then trumpets are going to
[1:20:47] blow and then people are going to begin
[1:20:49] to Rejoice with one voice and when they
[1:20:52] begin to shout God God went to war with
[1:20:56] the church of Israel let me tell you
[1:20:58] this friends you don't have to have the
[1:21:00] greatest ability you don't have to be a
[1:21:02] great trained soldier amen you got to
[1:21:05] know how to worship the God of
[1:21:08] War yeah when they started worshiping
[1:21:11] brother Nathan the walls started
[1:21:13] crumbling around them because God was
[1:21:15] teaching them how to war let me tell you
[1:21:17] you as a Church of the Living God when
[1:21:20] Devils wore off and they wall off things
[1:21:22] that belong to you as a possession the
[1:21:25] way you bring them down brother is don't
[1:21:27] wait till after you get the victory you
[1:21:30] start shouting before you get the
[1:21:32] Victory and you'll bring victory in the
[1:21:34] camp of God well I don't know about you
[1:21:37] this morning but I think it's time amen
[1:21:39] the Church of God shout a little bit
[1:21:41] over what God is going to do in the
[1:21:43] Church of the Living God said I don't
[1:21:45] see nothing yet amen I don't believe we
[1:21:48] have to wait till we see it I think we
[1:21:50] can praise God before we ever see the
[1:21:53] victory we can begin
[1:21:56] it's our land it's a land of promise and
[1:21:58] a land of worship and a land of
[1:22:01] power say well brother Wayne you're
[1:22:04] going to have to go deeper than that all
[1:22:05] right second Chronicles chapter 2 of
[1:22:07] chapter 20 what about second Chronicles
[1:22:10] when Josiah y'all remember that sermon
[1:22:12] Against All Odds y'all remember that
[1:22:14] remember when Josiah seen a whole host
[1:22:17] coming against him and what he done he
[1:22:19] went to the house of God and began to
[1:22:20] pray and God told him amen the battle is
[1:22:23] not yours
[1:22:25] it belongs to the Lord he said well Lord
[1:22:27] what am I supposed to do he said then
[1:22:29] you appoint you some
[1:22:32] singers get brother Ben up and let him
[1:22:34] lead a few
[1:22:36] songs and when y'all begin to worship
[1:22:39] let the Warriors come behind the
[1:22:43] worshippers and I'm going to set up an
[1:22:45] ambush on them amen and you know the
[1:22:48] Bible tells us that by the time the
[1:22:50] Warriors got into the battle the battle
[1:22:53] was already finished because God had
[1:22:55] tore down the Devil by the power of
[1:22:58] worship let me tell you this morning I
[1:23:00] believe the devil amen knows he's in
[1:23:03] trouble when the Church of the Living
[1:23:05] God begins to Worship in the anointing
[1:23:07] and the power of God I think it's time
[1:23:10] to go to war and if it's a time to go to
[1:23:12] war it's a Time To Worship it's a time
[1:23:15] to shout it's a time to Rejoice it's a
[1:23:18] time to tell that devil I'm coming after
[1:23:21] what God
[1:23:25] devil you better pack up and move off
[1:23:28] I'm coming after what God has gave me by
[1:23:32] promise I know people think I'm crazy
[1:23:34] but I really don't
[1:23:39] care preacher I want another okay I'll
[1:23:42] give you one more what about
[1:23:46] David come on amen God in the Book of
[1:23:48] Judges said I left those in the land to
[1:23:51] teach my people war that had not being
[1:23:54] in the first Canaan somebody said why
[1:23:57] did he have to circumcise all them
[1:23:59] people amen before they went in the land
[1:24:00] you know why he circumcised them because
[1:24:03] without the circumcision there was no
[1:24:04] difference between Israel and the
[1:24:07] Nations they were Waring with but when
[1:24:09] they were circumcised in their flesh
[1:24:11] there was a visible difference between
[1:24:13] the men of God and the men of the world
[1:24:16] and when David had a circumcision he was
[1:24:18] not a warrior he was a Shepherd but he
[1:24:21] was circumcised on the eighth day he
[1:24:23] knew but he had come from the lineage of
[1:24:26] Jesse he had been anointed of God and
[1:24:29] when he started out into that battle
[1:24:31] what was one of the first things he said
[1:24:33] who is this uncircumcised
[1:24:38] Philistine he knew he could whip him he
[1:24:41] done been taught war god taught him how
[1:24:44] to whip a
[1:24:46] devil come on I'm not making it up the
[1:24:49] book of Psalms says he taught My Hands
[1:24:51] to War God taught His Hands to War God
[1:24:54] taught him how to sing God taught him
[1:24:57] how to play a harp God taught him how to
[1:24:59] worship out there on the side of the
[1:25:01] banks amen do you don't think you don't
[1:25:03] think that David had a funeral song
[1:25:04] going into the battle do you come on
[1:25:07] he's in the land where Joshua was
[1:25:09] shouted before the walls come down and
[1:25:11] David the Bible tells us he ran into the
[1:25:14] battle brother random helps us and says
[1:25:16] he danced himself into the battle
[1:25:19] because he knew the battle was already
[1:25:21] won he was fighting and uncircumcised
[1:25:25] Philistine let me tell you this morning
[1:25:27] I believe the Church of the Living God
[1:25:29] has been taught War by a
[1:25:33] prophet we've been taught War by a
[1:25:36] prophet amen how in the world will we
[1:25:38] ever move a devil get the Holy Ghost
[1:25:40] moving get the power of God the
[1:25:43] anointing will broke the Yoke the power
[1:25:45] of God will cast out demons Lay Your
[1:25:47] Hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:25:50] we don't have to lay down and cover up
[1:25:52] our heads and wish we had a God we
[1:25:55] represent the God of all the heavens and
[1:25:58] power we're not here this morning hoping
[1:26:00] and thinking and maybe we're here with a
[1:26:02] sword in our hand
