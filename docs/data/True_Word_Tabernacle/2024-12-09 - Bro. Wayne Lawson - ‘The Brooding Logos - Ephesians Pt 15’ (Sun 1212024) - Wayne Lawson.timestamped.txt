[5:43] real blessing I want to take just a
[5:45] moment uh just we go into prayer this
[5:47] morning I know that there's been special
[5:50] needs um brother brother Ron has uh
[5:54] brother Brian was telling me that they
[5:56] put it out a little bit last night on
[5:58] the line so I don't feel feel so odd
[6:00] talking about it but uh they last week
[6:04] brother brother Ron actually about a
[6:06] week ago had uh went for a bunch of
[6:08] different tests and things when I was
[6:10] down at your dad's down at Sean's and um
[6:15] we were talking I could tell he's down a
[6:17] little bit so I asked him what he'd like
[6:18] to do and he said brother Wayne he said
[6:21] in April I'd like to come up there and
[6:23] be at the greenhouse with brother Aiden
[6:25] and the family when it opens he said I'd
[6:27] like to come in that into that supper
[6:30] and I said well I bet you we could
[6:32] arrange that and so we we had that
[6:34] arranged and he was going to come here
[6:36] and speak of Sunday and then later the
[6:38] week he he text and called me and said
[6:40] hey he said they found new cancer in my
[6:43] eyes and he said which tells me that
[6:46] that the brain cancer is activated and
[6:48] it's growing he said so I I probably be
[6:51] doing some treatment during that time so
[6:54] we've not said anything cuz he was kind
[6:56] of holding it back but uh brother Tim
[6:59] text me this morning said he'd be
[7:00] speaking today and he asked if we as a
[7:04] church would pray for him personally uh
[7:07] he's there in support for brother Ron
[7:09] and he actually got there you look how
[7:12] the Lord works when brother uh Tim
[7:15] arrived with brother Ron he walked in
[7:18] the door and shook hands and his phone
[7:19] rang and it was
[7:22] UAV and they were actually making the
[7:25] announcement to him that this is for
[7:27] sure the spreading of cancer which is
[7:30] which is a big deal in this situation
[7:32] but you know brother brother Ron's a
[7:35] warrior and the angel of
[7:37] God is between him and that sickness and
[7:41] as long as the Lord has
[7:44] purpose the devil can't touch his
[7:47] life now and we we know that amen so but
[7:52] brother Tim ask us to have prayer for
[7:54] him this morning as well as he's
[7:55] speaking there and he said ask the Lord
[7:57] to give him wisdom and give him words
[8:00] and I I believe we could support him in
[8:02] that this morning he's probably just
[8:04] started speaking about right now we pray
[8:06] the Lord just give him an extra burden
[8:08] so if we would just just bow our hearts
[8:10] let's pray for them this morning as a
[8:12] church and and what they're going
[8:14] through father Lord we bow our heart
[8:17] this morning and Lord we know
[8:19] you Lord it was the angel that met this
[8:22] messenger in a cave and said not even
[8:25] cancer would stand in the way Lord
[8:28] father as long as you got a right
[8:30] purpose Lord there would be nothing that
[8:33] could stand between you and your purpose
[8:36] father you've taught us that there's
[8:37] nothing can destroy the purpose of God
[8:39] in a life and nothing can take a man
[8:42] before you're done with him and I pray
[8:45] Lord Jesus this morning that your great
[8:47] hand of Mercy would be upon that
[8:49] congregation you'll be upon brother Tim
[8:51] as he speaks the word this morning I'm
[8:54] asking you to fill him with
[8:56] inspiration may you give him the wisdom
[8:58] of God Lord may you give him the voice
[9:01] and words of the Angels May Authority
[9:03] come into him in such a way Lord that he
[9:06] could help that place the congregation
[9:08] our brother Ron Lord we thank you for
[9:11] that and we ask you this morning that
[9:13] Lord your great spirit would move for
[9:15] them now Lord here this morning we've
[9:18] gathered in these Gates and Lord you
[9:20] have made a promise that you would be
[9:22] here in the midst of us and I know
[9:23] there's many needs that's gathered in
[9:25] the building this morning Lord and I
[9:27] just pray that the Holy Spirit would
[9:29] begin to move over this sanctuary and I
[9:32] pray father that you would reach Lord
[9:34] into every heart into every home that
[9:37] Lord Jesus we humble our hearts this
[9:39] morning before you and we ask you to
[9:41] come Lord and take this meeting Lord and
[9:44] use it for your glory may you bless your
[9:46] children God may you give to them great
[9:49] strength Lord now we ask you as we
[9:53] commit this service into thy faithful
[9:55] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[9:58] pray amen amen and amen and God bless
[10:01] you this morning amen if you have your
[10:04] Bibles we would like to go into the word
[10:06] of the Lord and we'll look in the book
[10:08] of
[10:08] Ephesians again chapter 2 veres 4 down
[10:12] to 10 if you were with us on Thursday
[10:15] night we were here in this fourth verse
[10:17] for God who is rich in Mercy with his
[10:20] great love wherein he loved us and uh
[10:23] We've we've uh we dug quite deeply into
[10:26] that in our personal studies and I found
[10:29] that that's a very powerful scripture
[10:31] amen uh maybe beyond what we could even
[10:34] speak uh God who is rich in Mercy for
[10:37] his great love where he loved us the
[10:40] fifth ver verse even when we were dead
[10:43] in sins ha he quickened us together with
[10:47] Christ by Grace ye are saved and Heath
[10:52] raised us up together and made us sit
[10:54] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[10:56] Jesus that in the ages to come he might
[11:00] show the exceeding Riches of his grace
[11:03] and his kindness toward us through
[11:06] Christ Jesus now for by Grace ye are
[11:10] saved through faith and that not of
[11:15] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[11:19] Works lest any man should boast for we
[11:24] are his
[11:26] workmanship now that's a that's a great
[11:30] word we are his
[11:33] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[11:38] good works which God hath before
[11:43] ordained that we should walk in them we
[11:46] ask the Lord to bless his words you
[11:48] could be seated this morning amen I want
[11:50] to speak to you today if I would hear in
[11:53] this Ephesians series I'm taking
[11:55] specific titles as we go along so you
[11:57] can catch the context of what I'm what
[12:00] I'm speaking on Amen I want to speak to
[12:02] you today from this uh the brooding
[12:05] logos the brooding logos I want to look
[12:08] at at how God Broods over his children
[12:12] amen the brooding logos amen I believe
[12:15] uh I believe that here as we were
[12:17] speaking Thursday night we were speaking
[12:19] about the mercies of God and brother
[12:21] bradam quotes something that that just
[12:23] struck my heart so uh real from the book
[12:26] of Exodus brother Bram says as Moses was
[12:28] leading the children of Israel over he
[12:30] said and they didn't they didn't die in
[12:32] the Red Sea like the others he said but
[12:35] they made it through he said because God
[12:37] carried them on the wings of the eagle
[12:40] and brother BR said what they were doing
[12:42] is they were following the message so
[12:44] that message brought them through and it
[12:46] was the mercy of God to their lives so
[12:48] brother bam brings this from the
[12:50] scripture in Exodus 19 and verse 4 in
[12:54] this Exodus 19 and verse4 he says you
[12:56] have seen what I did unto the Egyptians
[12:59] and how I bear ye on Eagle wings and I
[13:02] brought you unto myself now that's
[13:05] powerful stuff amen I took you on Eagle
[13:08] wings from Egypt and I brought you unto
[13:12] myself amen now if um and when we're
[13:16] looking at that I want to also look at
[13:18] verse uh 32 or Deuteronomy 32 and verse
[13:22] 11 I'm going to read a couple of these
[13:23] scriptures to kind of get where I'm
[13:25] coming from and as an eagle stth up its
[13:28] nest
[13:29] and fluth over her young and spreadeth
[13:33] abroad her wings and taketh them and
[13:36] beareth them on her wings so the Lord
[13:40] alone did lead them and there was no
[13:43] strange god with them amen so the way
[13:46] God spoke the way he led his children
[13:49] the way he brought Jacob he said the way
[13:52] he led them along without any strange
[13:54] Gods that's it's comparable to how an
[13:58] Eagle deals with with her children and
[14:00] he says as he fluth over her young now
[14:03] that word fluth comes also the same
[14:06] Hebrew word is used in Genesis chapter 1
[14:09] when and the Earth was without former
[14:11] void and darkness was upon the face of
[14:14] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[14:18] upon the faces of the water Amen in
[14:20] other words the spirit of God fluttered
[14:23] amen it brooded over a dark empty space
[14:28] and made something happened when I look
[14:30] back at this I think it's a powerful
[14:32] reality uh from the exposition of the
[14:35] church ages and L out to see a church
[14:37] age brother adal say this he said the
[14:39] beginning of the creation of God that is
[14:42] who the Lord Jesus says he is but those
[14:45] words does not mean exactly as they
[14:47] sound just taking them the way they
[14:49] sound he said in fact multitudes of
[14:52] people get the idea that Jesus was the
[14:54] first creation of God making him lower
[14:57] than the godhead then this this first
[14:59] creation created all the rest of the
[15:01] universe whatsoever it contains but that
[15:04] is not right you know that doesn't line
[15:07] up with the rest of the Bible the words
[15:09] are he is the beginner or the author of
[15:13] the creation of God now we know for
[15:15] assurity that Jesus is God he is the
[15:18] very God he is a Creator in John 1 and3
[15:21] said all things were created by Him and
[15:24] without him was nothing made that is
[15:27] made he is uh anything that was made he
[15:31] is the one whom it is said in Genesis
[15:34] 1:1 in the beginning God created the
[15:37] Heaven and the Earth also in verses
[15:40] Exodus 20 and verse 11 for in 6 days the
[15:43] Lord hath made Heaven and Earth and all
[15:46] them and rested on the seventh day there
[15:49] is no doubt that he is the creator he
[15:52] was the creator of a finished physical
[15:56] creation amen here we sit here tonight
[15:59] realizing that we're sitting on a
[16:01] finished physical creation because Jesus
[16:05] Christ is a Creator amen when we uh
[16:08] examine this of course we're sitting
[16:09] here tonight on this Earth and we're
[16:11] living in this atmosphere and we're
[16:13] living on this Spar amen it's amazing to
[16:16] me always that it's perfectly the right
[16:18] distance from the Sun it has an exact
[16:21] need of oxygen and nitrogen and the
[16:23] waters and the trees and and and
[16:25] everything that is needed to maintain
[16:28] human life it's all just there amen and
[16:30] to think that we're sitting here on this
[16:32] Earth tonight or this morning and
[16:35] realizing that the God we're serving is
[16:37] the god that created the whole thing now
[16:41] I I know that that's a very challenging
[16:43] statement in this end time amen isn't it
[16:45] odd it's a lay out to see a church age
[16:47] where he declares he is the beginning of
[16:49] the creation of God because it's in this
[16:51] age that it probably that that has
[16:54] become more atheist and more agnostics
[16:56] than there's ever been in the history of
[16:58] the world but it's been produced
[17:00] according to Isaiah 60 there's a
[17:01] Darkness to come upon the Earth and
[17:03] brother B said education and
[17:05] intelligence has brought that Darkness
[17:07] upon the Earth because as man becomes
[17:10] more intelligent he actually sends the
[17:12] world into a deeper depths of Darkness
[17:15] amen listen going getting smarter does
[17:17] not put people closer to
[17:20] God now you know brother Bram said
[17:23] education actually was the greatest
[17:25] enemy The Gospel had he said I go over
[17:27] there in Africa where they don't know
[17:29] nothing and I do this miracle among them
[17:31] and they're ready to serve God he said I
[17:33] come over in the educated world he said
[17:35] and they try to reason it and figure it
[17:37] out and make it happen and reproduce it
[17:39] and he said they got all these things
[17:41] amen but what we realize is man has
[17:43] never now man has never had the answers
[17:46] that he's looking for in human intellect
[17:49] amen I'll say this whenever a person
[17:52] starts out on the trail to figure out
[17:54] God by human intellect you are on a
[17:57] trail that will never end end and it
[17:59] will leave you it will leave you empty
[18:01] it will leave you hungry it will leave
[18:04] you nasty to others it will put you in a
[18:06] place that you can never Ascend you can
[18:09] never get to where you're going it is a
[18:11] place it will never have an end of the
[18:13] road because man can never reach that
[18:16] amen let me say this there's been a lot
[18:18] of smart people Through the Ages but
[18:20] they've never had the answer if you went
[18:22] to Socrates or you went to Playdoh this
[18:24] morning of course their words are great
[18:27] and they're inspiring to me intellectual
[18:29] Minds amen but they come up to a spot
[18:32] that they couldn't climb over because
[18:34] human intellect cannot climb the summit
[18:37] to answer who is God you could study
[18:39] creation your whole life and you can
[18:41] look into creation and never ever see
[18:44] the Creator we see it in medical science
[18:46] we see it in physical science we see it
[18:49] in educational science and we see the
[18:51] smartest Minds that's ever been theyve
[18:53] went so far into the technology until
[18:56] they broke into an atom and they can
[18:57] destroy themselves
[18:59] but for some reason they cannot
[19:00] reproduce themselves nor can we maintain
[19:03] life because it is the tree of knowledge
[19:06] and man is dying by that tree of course
[19:08] we're building an Eden but it's an Eden
[19:10] of death and it's an Eden of sin and
[19:13] people are not better off today because
[19:15] of it matter of fact more people die
[19:17] today because of it amen but you see the
[19:20] entire thing is is that very Creator
[19:23] himself has been taken out of the
[19:25] picture amen therefore we've had to
[19:27] substitute for our mental States we've
[19:30] had to bring Darwin in and we've had to
[19:32] bring Socrates and Plato and we've had
[19:35] to bring all these great philosophers
[19:37] and I just have to be very clear there's
[19:39] probably nothing makes me any sicker is
[19:41] to hear a preacher leaning on darsm and
[19:44] Socrates and ploh and and all these
[19:48] educational come on it has nothing to do
[19:51] with the Gospel of Jesus
[19:53] Christ somebody asked me one time and
[19:56] they I might as well preach since I'm
[19:58] here huh somebody asked me one time they
[19:59] said brother Wayne are you just against
[20:01] uh any kind of a counselor any kind of
[20:04] help I said oh absolutely not amen do
[20:06] whatever you can do to help the world
[20:08] Amen and it has a place in medical
[20:10] science they study it like our hot
[20:12] doctors and like our uh neurologist and
[20:14] like our Euro all these things are
[20:16] studies and they're specialist and God
[20:17] God bless them for whatever they can do
[20:19] to help them amen only thing I've ever
[20:21] uh uh been in conflict with is it has no
[20:24] place in the pull
[20:26] pit if we're going to see a psych just
[20:28] go to see a licensed one not some
[20:31] half-baked guy that's mixing the gospel
[20:33] and psychology together to bring it to
[20:35] the Gospel of Jesus Christ so what you
[20:38] get into is you don't have a good
[20:39] psychologist or a good preacher you got
[20:42] some kind of hybrid nonsense and it'll
[20:44] never bring the Church of the Living God
[20:47] into a rapturing faith I'd rather you
[20:49] not know your ABCs amen amen that to not
[20:52] know the god of Heaven because one of
[20:55] these days this whole thing is going to
[20:57] burn to the ground but there'll be a
[20:59] bride standing left because God who is
[21:02] rich in Mercy has brought it and I don't
[21:04] care you can sit on that all you want to
[21:06] but let me tell you this there'll come a
[21:08] day when you'll understand there's one
[21:10] thing that'll help Mankind and it is God
[21:13] himself that comes in the midst of the
[21:16] children of God he is the author of a
[21:18] finished
[21:19] creation he is the author of this now
[21:23] you you think about this because Darwin
[21:26] is explaining Evolution because he don't
[21:29] want to admit God of
[21:32] creation right now now if you go back
[21:36] into into create I've actually been to
[21:38] gpus Islands I I was there right where
[21:40] it started it it it's wild I went on the
[21:43] very Island he started it on and you
[21:46] know what I found out that if you got
[21:48] God in your heart you would never find
[21:51] our wisom in the gpus islands I was on
[21:53] the same
[21:55] island but being a dumb hillbilly I
[21:57] never picked up one
[21:59] one thing I never saw one animal I never
[22:02] saw one tree to make me believe that one
[22:04] germ started the whole thing and some
[22:06] intelligence who we don't know or know
[22:08] about made this whole thing from nothing
[22:11] can you imagine how could all of this
[22:13] order come out of disorder without some
[22:16] creator making these things happen why
[22:18] people's got so smart that they got dumb
[22:21] they have forgotten what it is in
[22:23] reality listen Apostle Paul preached on
[22:26] Mars Hill folks he stood among the gods
[22:29] of the Romans there was probably no less
[22:31] than 3,000 of them amen gathered around
[22:34] on Mars Hill and and and then none of
[22:36] them had the answers and when when Paul
[22:39] preached there he found one of the great
[22:41] altars said unto the unto the unknown
[22:44] God because all of their 3,000 ideas of
[22:49] intelligence could not reveal the
[22:51] creator of the heavens and the Earth but
[22:53] Paul answered the whole thing in Hebrews
[22:56] the 11th chapter and said by fath we
[22:59] understand that God framed the heavens
[23:01] and the Earth by his own word and until
[23:04] a man is born again he cannot believe
[23:07] that amen and until God gets into the
[23:10] soul of a person there's not enough
[23:12] Faith to look at a situation and just
[23:14] believe that God did
[23:18] it my
[23:20] goodness so brother Wayne what did
[23:22] happen then well that's a good that's a
[23:23] good reality because if you go back in
[23:26] the Scriptures it said in the beginning
[23:28] God created the heavens and the Earth
[23:30] period so then we have a certain
[23:32] educational religious people who has
[23:35] started arguing of the archaeologists
[23:37] and say well you know the world's only
[23:39] 6,000 years old so they're trying to
[23:41] argue all these points with them well
[23:43] you don't argue with the science that
[23:45] the world is older than 6,000 years
[23:47] because brother Brown said God created
[23:48] heavens and earth period and he said
[23:51] there's a time space we don't know how
[23:53] long that period was is that right amen
[23:57] now watch with that time time space and
[23:59] period Then what we find is from that
[24:01] God himself now this is the way brother
[24:04] brandom set it up brother Roose John God
[24:06] himself amen had the end from the
[24:09] beginning isn't that beautiful wouldn't
[24:11] it be something if you could know the
[24:13] outcome before you ever started well
[24:15] when you're dealing with God he knows
[24:17] what's going to happen before he ever
[24:20] starts the happening and in the
[24:22] beginning God created so brother bam
[24:24] says in the power of transformation he
[24:25] says people think that God's repeating
[24:28] him self in the first couple chapters of
[24:30] Genesis he said but he's not he said
[24:32] what has happened is he spoke the word
[24:35] and then he goes and manifestes the word
[24:37] he speaks it and then he manifests it
[24:40] and that's God's way of doing things he
[24:42] said matter of fact when God created the
[24:44] heavens and the Earth he spoke what was
[24:46] going to be and he said those words
[24:49] became seeds and fell into the Earth
[24:52] beneath the Waters of the earth and they
[24:54] laid there in darkness now now if you're
[24:57] if you're if you're just coming into the
[24:59] message of the hour maybe some could be
[25:01] online this morning different ones are
[25:02] just studying these things so if you're
[25:04] just coming to what I'm talking about
[25:06] Amen brother bam is typing the water as
[25:09] the people that's Revelation 17 right
[25:12] the Bible said and the waters was the
[25:14] people so the symbology is in the
[25:16] beginning the world Amen had waters on
[25:19] it like today has peoples on it and God
[25:23] put beneath the waters the seeds of
[25:26] future civilization now what he did was
[25:29] brother random says it like this he said
[25:31] it come from a previous
[25:34] Civilization now now folks I I
[25:36] personally do not believe amen that God
[25:39] had two or three other the planets I I
[25:41] don't believe he done this two or three
[25:42] times he may have I don't know but one
[25:44] thing that I do know is his civilization
[25:47] was in his mind because before it ever
[25:50] happens he already had it in his mind
[25:52] and when he spoke it that's the way that
[25:55] God lays a civilization is in the seed
[25:58] so the seeds of the civilization of Eden
[26:01] was laying beneath the water amen but
[26:04] they were powerless under the water
[26:06] without any light they just laid in the
[26:08] darkness see it was a darkness that
[26:11] covered the seed so it couldn't be what
[26:13] it was supposed to be it couldn't become
[26:15] what it was supposed to become because
[26:17] it was lacking something though it was
[26:19] God's spoken word seed it needed
[26:22] something to come to manifest and the
[26:24] prophet of God said that's when God said
[26:26] let there be light and he said coming
[26:28] out of God was that great Halo which we
[26:31] call the logos that great logos he said
[26:34] begin to swirl down over the Earth and
[26:37] begin to move across the waters now let
[26:39] me tell you when God began to move
[26:41] across the waters the darknesses begin
[26:43] to go backwards amen and the waters
[26:46] begin to part and the seeds that was
[26:48] laying there was receiving what they
[26:51] needed to come to life because God who
[26:54] was rich in Mercy knew without this
[26:56] light they will never manifest what it
[26:58] is they're supposed to be but God rich
[27:01] in Mercy didn't leave them in the water
[27:03] he didn't leave them in the darkness he
[27:05] brought light to
[27:08] them
[27:10] hallelujah hallelujah that great logos
[27:13] begin to come over now the reason
[27:14] evolutionists can believe and prove to
[27:17] you in science that there is evolving
[27:20] truth in creation is because that's
[27:23] exactly the way God created
[27:25] creation he brooded over the Earth
[27:29] himself and as an eagle Broods over a
[27:33] nest God brooded over the Earth in this
[27:35] Halo of light and that light as it
[27:39] brooded it be to bring from the earth
[27:41] brother Adam told us this he said see
[27:43] first it begin to bring botney life he
[27:45] said then you had the little life and
[27:47] then you had the trees he said then here
[27:49] comes the animal life he said but watch
[27:51] now God is over the whole thing the
[27:55] Creator is over the whole thing so watch
[27:58] when creation come up to man it stopped
[28:02] at
[28:03] man now why did creation stop at men
[28:07] because God had reached perfection in
[28:10] creation oh my now that's pretty heavy
[28:14] because when God himself come to the
[28:16] Earth what did he come
[28:18] as so brother B said the very Creator
[28:21] himself was
[28:23] man that's why when Abraham anden Moses
[28:26] hid behind The Rock he seeing the back
[28:28] part of a man he the offing logos was
[28:32] the form of man brother said that's what
[28:34] he was brooding for was to bring
[28:36] something unto his own image can I say
[28:39] it for you he brought them unto himself
[28:43] God created until there was something in
[28:46] the earth that was like him isn't it
[28:48] powerful some thoughts require longer to
[28:51] express you know sometimes we break
[28:53] series up in two or three four parts and
[28:54] the reason we do it is because we have a
[28:56] thought but it can't be spoken one
[28:58] service it can't be placed in an hour or
[29:01] in a few stories but God had 6,000 years
[29:06] to express a thought and if you stopped
[29:09] him 2,000 years into it it looked a
[29:12] certain way and you'd have thought well
[29:14] if you were living in that generation
[29:15] you say well that's all of it but see it
[29:17] wasn't because God was brooding he was
[29:20] evolving something out of something
[29:23] until it come to its perfection in the
[29:25] sixth day and then God created himself
[29:27] he
[29:28] he said because Adam had been under a
[29:30] covenant they could fall he said but now
[29:32] we're hearing something different for I
[29:35] will put imity between God has already
[29:38] done something to fix it in the Covenant
[29:40] that he made with with Eve concerning
[29:42] the woman's seed and that's exactly what
[29:45] God Said to Abraham when he came to him
[29:48] he said Abraham I have already blessed
[29:50] thee brother man said I want you to
[29:52] notice the difference now in the
[29:53] covenants the Covenant to Adam was he
[29:56] could fall but the Covenant to Abraham
[29:58] as he couldn't fall Hallelujah brother B
[30:01] said because God had already did it he
[30:05] had already did it in his mind he had
[30:07] already made the woman seed when he
[30:10] spoke it amen Jesus Christ Genesis 15
[30:15] tells us that Jesus was the way God
[30:17] planned to bless Abraham is that right
[30:20] so before Abraham ever started folks the
[30:23] finished product of Jesus Christ has
[30:26] already been prophesied so that brooding
[30:29] logos comes over Abraham watch brother B
[30:32] said and he lays a foundation for his
[30:35] Masterpiece coming and he puts Abraham
[30:38] in one corner his faith he puts Isaac in
[30:41] another corner and then he puts he goes
[30:43] over and puts Jacob Grace in another
[30:45] Corner then he comes over and puts
[30:47] Joseph in another corner and he builds a
[30:50] foundation because he knows where he's
[30:53] going and God began to brood out of that
[30:56] Foundation of Israel
[30:58] prophets and Priests and Kings but none
[31:03] of them was Jesus
[31:05] Christ none of them was God himself so
[31:09] God the great brooding logos could not
[31:13] walk away from Israel amen he had to
[31:16] hold what kept Him in contact with David
[31:19] in the middle of his trouble what kept
[31:21] him with Abraham when he was lying what
[31:23] kept him with Moses when he came to his
[31:25] mistakes what what was it it was the
[31:28] Broody logos that was determined I will
[31:31] have a masterpiece I will bring back
[31:34] what I've lost in the Garden of Eden and
[31:36] God would not be detered by the works of
[31:39] man this is not your work this is the
[31:43] work of almighty God God himself is
[31:46] creating and he's bringing out of
[31:48] Abraham Isaac and Jacob a nation and
[31:51] anybody that studies the nation of
[31:52] Israel knows there was tons of trouble
[31:54] in Israel there was tons of Back Body
[31:57] there were tons of adultery it was all
[31:59] kinds of sins balam tried to point it
[32:01] out but God said you're looking at the
[32:03] wrong thing
[32:04] balum you're looking at the wrong thing
[32:07] you can't see the smitten Rock if he
[32:09] could he would have knew it was Jesus
[32:11] Christ in a prefigure if he couldn't see
[32:14] the Brazen altar if he knew it he would
[32:16] have knew them that was Jesus Christ he
[32:19] couldn't see the secret of Israel The
[32:21] Secret of Israel was that Pillar of Fire
[32:24] that was behind that Veil back there
[32:27] that brooding Loos that wouldn't let him
[32:29] stop it wouldn't let him
[32:32] quit it was coming to Jesus Christ every
[32:36] Old Testament Prophet every scripture
[32:38] prophesied of the coming of Jesus Christ
[32:41] and when Jesus came John answered the
[32:43] question that was asked to Abraham and
[32:46] to Isaac father here's the wood but
[32:49] where is the lamb and that answer came
[32:53] thousands of years later when John the
[32:55] Baptist pointed him out there is the
[32:58] Lamb of God the brooding locost had
[33:01] brooded until God was manifested in the
[33:05] flesh upon Earth in his son Christ
[33:09] Jesus that's the reason he wasn't the
[33:11] second person of the godhead he was God
[33:14] himself manifested in the flesh it was a
[33:17] new genesis folks in John chapter 1 John
[33:20] began like Moses in the beginning God
[33:23] created the heavens and the Earth and
[33:25] John said in the beginning was the word
[33:27] and the Word was with God and the Word
[33:30] was God oh but that 14th verse but the
[33:33] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[33:37] the brooding loost didn't leave it in
[33:40] the word he brought it to the flesh one
[33:42] who could
[33:44] redeem hallelujah thank God somebody
[33:48] stepped out of this Ivory palaces and
[33:50] the great logos of God came into the
[33:52] Earth in the midst of darkness and
[33:54] unbelief and Pharisee toal lady OA that
[33:58] was back in that
[34:02] day he
[34:04] brooded until even God himself looked at
[34:07] a woman and he said Thou shalt have a
[34:09] child and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[34:12] and the angel prophesied over her life
[34:14] if she had had found favor and she said
[34:16] a very powerful thing to
[34:18] him I have not known a
[34:22] man he said but the thing that shall be
[34:25] of you will be overshadowed
[34:28] of the Holy Ghost oh Church of the
[34:31] Living God it will not be touched by
[34:34] denominational hands the thing that
[34:36] shall be borned in you shall be the
[34:39] operation of the overshadowing of the
[34:41] Holy Ghost God himself overshadow the
[34:44] womb of a woman to bring Christ into
[34:47] this age and that same Christ has been
[34:50] prophesied to come through a bright
[34:53] church and that same light that was
[34:55] there with Mary has returned to you and
[34:58] I to manifest the power of God in this
[35:01] age Hallelujah man will never manifest
[35:05] what we're talking about intellect will
[35:07] never climb it amen psychology will
[35:09] never get there we're talking about God
[35:12] manifesting In the Flesh of
[35:15] humanity it's the only thing that will
[35:18] work look at brother bradam tell the
[35:21] story he tells the story it's a powerful
[35:23] story he said look how when he come back
[35:27] that same
[35:28] Jesus God himself said in the this is my
[35:32] beloved Son John says this is the lamb
[35:36] and God in a voice as a pillar of fire
[35:40] came down on the river that's right and
[35:43] said this is
[35:45] him it could have could have said this
[35:47] is him of who the prophet spoke
[35:49] of this is him that was prophesied in
[35:53] the Book of Genesis see that
[35:56] light had seen the Fulfillment of his
[35:59] prophecy and it was there to identify
[36:02] that's right this is my
[36:06] son Psalms 110 said it this day I've
[36:10] begotten thee amen it's a a meic
[36:15] order the king priest the lamb there he
[36:21] was God the fullness of God dwelling in
[36:25] a
[36:25] man Hallelujah Heaven and Earth met that
[36:29] day the brooding logos finally got born
[36:32] back into the image he was the second
[36:34] man Adam come on the first one was made
[36:37] a living soul but that second Man became
[36:40] a quickening
[36:42] spirit and to every one of us that's
[36:44] dead tonight at this morning we know him
[36:47] as the quickening
[36:48] [Applause]
[36:51] spirit now said preacher what do you say
[36:54] Let me let me just make it clear as I
[36:56] know how they took that man and he
[36:59] walked on Mount Transfiguration with
[37:01] Peter James and John and a and a cloud
[37:04] overshadowed it a brooding logos came
[37:07] now this is my beloved Son hear ye
[37:12] him then they took him to
[37:15] Calvary and the book of Isaiah said he
[37:18] was spitting of God he was he had no
[37:22] beauty that you could desire him he was
[37:24] not that beautiful tree of knowledge
[37:27] right
[37:28] he was that ugly Tree of
[37:31] Life come on Heen when they building the
[37:34] Tabernacle in the wilderness it was made
[37:36] of tent skins it was not something to
[37:38] look at but all the life was there come
[37:42] on church I don't believe in this cold
[37:44] form of worship in this end time it
[37:46] might be beautiful but it's dead and
[37:49] it's cold and there's no life in it but
[37:52] come to the tree of life it might have
[37:54] altars and snot and screaming and Shout
[37:57] and tongues but there's life in it
[38:01] there's life in it oh thank God this
[38:04] morning for True Word Tabernacle there's
[38:07] life there's
[38:10] life
[38:12] Hallelujah give me life don't give me
[38:15] education give me life give me life for
[38:17] our children give me life for our young
[38:20] people give me life for our elders give
[38:22] me the Holy
[38:25] Ghost Hallelujah
[38:28] thank you Jesus they took him at Calvary
[38:31] and they Smit Isaiah 53 STS the story
[38:33] sir now why did they Smite Him Sister
[38:36] Gail because he was the only perfect
[38:41] lamb Exodus said they had to put him up
[38:43] and examine them look at how much time
[38:47] they killed him in
[38:48] Passover the same as they did in the
[38:50] book of Exodus and they kept the lamb up
[38:53] 14 days and examined him and judged him
[38:55] until the time of the killing do you
[38:56] know Passover
[38:58] when Jesus was killed that they judged
[39:00] our
[39:03] Lord and pilate said those beautiful
[39:06] words I find no fault in
[39:09] him but like a lamb he was led to the
[39:13] slaughter and he opened not his mouth
[39:16] brother that is the greatest success of
[39:19] any conqueror I've ever knew he laid
[39:22] down his life and he never bit back he
[39:25] never let bitterness come from him he
[39:27] stood there and let it happen and he was
[39:30] a lamb led to the
[39:34] slaughter put him on calvary's tree and
[39:36] they plunged him in the side but brother
[39:38] I love that part brother Greg when the
[39:41] Lord when the Lord stood there and took
[39:43] it all and he looks up into the heaven
[39:46] and said it is finished it is finished
[39:49] there's never been greater words spok of
[39:51] that in the whole world the Eternal Loos
[39:53] wasn't finished until the blood come out
[39:56] of his side come on Adam was created in
[39:59] the garden and it finished the work but
[40:01] Eve was coming out of Adam and here at
[40:04] Calvary amen when he cried it is
[40:07] finished you and I were the blood and
[40:09] the water that was released from the
[40:11] sight of the Lord Jesus it was another
[40:14] Eden it was another Genesis and there
[40:16] was a bride coming out of his side oh
[40:19] hallelujah hallelujah to God as a power
[40:23] in this message it's not church it's not
[40:26] works it's not legalism it's the power
[40:30] of the blood of Jesus Christ oh
[40:34] hallelujah hallelujah the blood it's
[40:38] still got power this
[40:42] morning it is finished he
[40:46] cried amen
[40:49] hallelujah sister Lisa the
[40:51] scure would not be
[40:54] denied his great architect this great
[41:00] work so somebody says why he why he
[41:04] smack
[41:05] it when he Smite it brother Bram
[41:08] explains it through n naal art and said
[41:12] what happened when Michaelangelo and
[41:14] Moses he said Michelangelo had in his
[41:17] mind to Moses and he said there wasn't
[41:20] the negative but he picked a block and
[41:23] he started working on it see he was the
[41:26] rock that followed
[41:27] the children of
[41:28] Israel but through the evolution of the
[41:31] brooding logos he became the rock that
[41:35] the dying Thief looked at and it wasn't
[41:38] in it wasn't in the making anymore it
[41:40] was in the Perfection
[41:42] now oh it's the love of God it was
[41:46] capping the whole
[41:48] thing I wish I had better ability it was
[41:52] the love of God it was the love of God
[41:54] from Eden that had saw his children
[41:58] laying in sin now he's on calvary's
[42:01] cross and love is coming from him and
[42:03] they're smiting
[42:05] him
[42:07] life is being let
[42:10] go brother Bram said Michelangelo and
[42:12] Moses he said of course when
[42:13] Michelangelo finished Moses and he got
[42:15] him to the perfect part that's when he
[42:17] smacked his knee and he cried speak
[42:20] which brother bam said that was the
[42:22] Masterpiece was the Smite was the
[42:24] Masterpiece he said because my was so
[42:27] pleased with what he had built he felt
[42:29] like it ought to
[42:32] speak when Jesus is at Calvary they see
[42:35] that is a bad part of his life it's the
[42:40] Masterpiece because he so matches what
[42:43] the prophet said of
[42:44] him it was exactly brother Steven he was
[42:48] everything Moses said he was everything
[42:50] David said he was everything they
[42:52] prophesied he was he didn't miss one
[42:56] lick he was a match piece to the thought
[42:59] of God until God himself could smile him
[43:02] oh I hope you hear me and he brought
[43:05] from him water and Blood Brother BR said
[43:08] there it was just like in Eden Here
[43:11] Comes the Bride from him yeah and Bride
[43:15] come out there on the day of Pentecost
[43:16] he began to brood over him and brother
[43:18] BR said what's he doing he said he's
[43:20] bringing for
[43:22] seed he's bringing for seed it's another
[43:24] Eden now he's bringing for seed he said
[43:27] now he said many people wondered why God
[43:29] set by and let these seed be beat and
[43:33] eaten and strangled and bruised and cut
[43:37] he said because the seed had to be
[43:39] planted in the
[43:42] ground it had to be planted see Paul had
[43:45] to be planted John had to be planted
[43:48] Peter had to be their faith had to go in
[43:51] the ground and brother B said oh but God
[43:53] was determined to have
[43:56] one Hallelujah God was determined to
[43:59] have one look at what he did when God
[44:01] began Amen in the Nia Council they went
[44:03] in the ground brother said But Here
[44:05] Comes Martin
[44:06] Luther and he sprigs
[44:10] out and he comes out just shall live by
[44:13] faith you as a Believer probably
[44:15] couldn't tell the difference in Martin
[44:16] Luther and the Catholic Church it would
[44:19] have took Luther and the church because
[44:21] now his church is turned around and
[44:24] going back to
[44:26] Catholics because they really don't see
[44:28] the difference but Martin seen the
[44:31] difference Martin Luther seen the
[44:33] difference in the way they did communion
[44:37] right do you see but if you would have
[44:39] stopped right there that wasn't the book
[44:41] of Acts
[44:43] Church Martin Luther smoking a pot and
[44:45] drinking beer but the brooding
[44:48] logos the pillar of fire said it won't
[44:52] stop
[44:53] here because he had a vision Paul's
[44:56] already prophesied in Ephesians 5 I will
[44:59] have a church a glorious Church Without
[45:02] spot a wrinkle Jesus has already
[45:04] prophesied in Matthew the 16th chapter I
[45:07] will build my church come on it's
[45:09] prophesied in the Bible that there would
[45:11] come a glorious branch in the latter
[45:14] days there would come a super Church
[45:16] there will come a super race there will
[45:18] come a super seed and that wasn't
[45:22] it and Luther wasn't it and Wesley
[45:26] wasn't it right there was only the
[45:29] growing portion the evolution yes sir
[45:33] amen come on it wasn't happening without
[45:37] God it wasn't evolution by
[45:41] education come on education couldn't
[45:43] lift them out of the Catholic Church are
[45:46] you hearing me education couldn't lift
[45:48] them out of it but it took the Broody
[45:51] lost to make Martin Luther see the
[45:54] justly by faith that's how a man lives
[45:58] by what he
[45:59] believes and there he was under his
[46:02] great faith I've always been amazed the
[46:05] anointing that was on that man yes sir
[46:08] I'm not even going to number the thesis
[46:10] last time I got them way
[46:12] wrong Stephen how many was there 95 I
[46:16] called him
[46:18] 32 I was a third
[46:21] right
[46:24] paraphrasing they had a thesis that that
[46:27] was what I was
[46:31] meaning and they told him you can come
[46:33] back in church if you'll just deny this
[46:35] see but through education they couldn't
[46:37] get to where Martin Luther had
[46:40] went amen that's good and Martin Luther
[46:44] could not
[46:50] regress life doesn't
[46:55] regress life moves forward so once that
[47:00] had happened and Luther come out in life
[47:03] he couldn't regress to the Roman
[47:05] Church he couldn't he couldn't stay
[47:08] where he was but the brooding logos was
[47:11] saying come on and then all of a sudden
[47:14] Martin Luther amen his light starts
[47:16] dimming his age starts coming John
[47:18] Wesley Rises up and begins his whole
[47:20] movement of the just shall live by faith
[47:24] but God will sanctify You by his word
[47:28] yeah that wasn't it I've said it off and
[47:31] I'll say it again sanctification is a
[47:33] place you got to go a place you can't
[47:36] stay meanest people you know are
[47:39] sanctified people who never got the Holy
[47:41] Ghost meanest people you know are
[47:44] sanctified people that never got the
[47:46] Holy
[47:49] Ghost that's right if they can't wear a
[47:51] long sleeve they sure enough don't want
[47:53] you to yeah
[47:55] it
[47:57] amen sure if they're going to wear a
[47:59] long sleeve and you wear a short sleeve
[48:00] man they'll beat on you till you either
[48:02] get in line or get
[48:05] away ain't no way you're going to drive
[48:07] a car and me driving this
[48:10] buggy put it in something you
[48:13] get ain't no way I'm going to let you do
[48:16] that while I'm doing this nobody said
[48:17] you had to do
[48:19] that that was a god of your own
[48:23] making sanctification by the spirit no
[48:26] man shall see God without Holiness who's
[48:29] Holiness then come on Church be perfect
[48:33] even as our father in Heaven is perfect
[48:35] then who is perfect brother B said
[48:36] there's only one perfect one and that's
[48:39] God and without the Holy Ghost you'll
[48:41] never come to Perfection that's why Paul
[48:43] said don't lay again the foundations of
[48:46] dead works and repentance unto God we
[48:48] believe in those things but it's
[48:50] Perfection folks let's go let's go let's
[48:53] go to Perfection the evolving place of
[48:58] churches can I say it the brooding logos
[49:01] is saying keep
[49:08] moving you know what he began to do he
[49:10] began to spring up till we had the
[49:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost come in
[49:12] Reformation of gifts in 1906 they
[49:15] thought that was the original brother B
[49:17] said oh no he said there's a stage of
[49:19] the plant that you missed he said that's
[49:22] that
[49:24] shuck this is not the original Holy
[49:26] Ghost ghost He says you know why cuz
[49:30] there had been no restoration of the
[49:32] word and you can't have a restoration of
[49:35] the day of Pentecost without a
[49:37] restoration of Paul's
[49:39] teachings you can't have it without the
[49:42] original word so brother random says in
[49:44] the Masterpiece he said then Malachi 4
[49:47] said we would have a restoration of the
[49:50] church come on he said we'd have it he
[49:52] said Revelations 10 holds the word that
[49:55] would do the restoring
[49:57] you'll never have a perfect Church
[49:58] Without perfect
[50:01] word it'll take the opening to them
[50:03] seals to bring perfect word and the
[50:06] perfect word will bring a perfect
[50:09] Church perfect according to
[50:13] who now that's the real thing isn't
[50:17] it see my wife's perfect for me might
[50:21] not be perfect for you this reason you
[50:23] have to be careful even with other men's
[50:25] servants
[50:27] people judging one another in the
[50:28] ministry and things sometime maybe God
[50:29] told the brother to do it that way or he
[50:31] told a sister to do it that way so you
[50:33] respect one
[50:34] another
[50:36] right CU they belong to somebody else so
[50:40] maybe one wife is not perfect for one
[50:43] man right but his wife's perfect for
[50:47] him now if you were trying to align into
[50:51] the Perfection of the world to be a
[50:52] perfect bride you ain't getting there
[50:54] because there's science and civilization
[50:56] has a different idea of what a perfect
[50:58] Church exists as but to the bride it's a
[51:03] revelation that comes from
[51:06] God right it's a revelation that comes
[51:08] from God the brooding
[51:11] logos now when I say this when I say
[51:15] this uh brooding logos uh I wanted to
[51:18] maybe take a moment and bring that
[51:20] picture up again I know you all seen
[51:22] this picture if you hadn't seen this
[51:24] picture I want you to lift your hand
[51:25] when we bring it up is anybody never
[51:26] seen this everybody in the
[51:29] room okay we don't we don't really show
[51:33] this because of brother Bram which we do
[51:35] follow brother bram's teachings and and
[51:36] we're not ashamed of that at all
[51:38] somebody ashamed of that they ain't got
[51:40] on first base yet okay so we're not
[51:42] ashamed to brother Brandon more his
[51:43] teachings I can prove every one of them
[51:45] my scripture if you give me a few
[51:47] minutes but what was over his
[51:50] head is known as the angel of the lord
[51:53] it's known as the angel of his presence
[51:56] this is exactly what appeared on the
[51:58] river with John the
[52:00] Baptist this is what was brooding over
[52:04] the creation in the
[52:06] beginning it's the creative logos it's
[52:09] the brooding logos it's known as the
[52:12] pillar of Fire or the angel of the
[52:14] Covenant it is the headship to the
[52:17] church it's what led the children of
[52:19] Israel from Egypt all the way to the
[52:22] promised land and God said I bore them
[52:24] on Eagle wings amen so that light was
[52:29] coming for creation purposes now I just
[52:32] I just love this because this is taken
[52:34] in 1950 in SE Houston Coliseum now among
[52:38] us we recognize this and this is very be
[52:40] and you always want to remember this I
[52:42] didn't take that picture
[52:46] okay our church didn't take that
[52:49] picture brother brandom's campaign
[52:52] didn't take that
[52:55] picture
[52:57] you know it was this critic that took
[52:59] it brother Ray I guarantee you they wish
[53:03] they had that
[53:05] back I bet you they wish they had never
[53:08] built those
[53:13] Gallows I guarantee you they wish they
[53:15] had never built that Gallow I guarantee
[53:18] you Goliath wished he'd have left his
[53:20] sword at the tent that
[53:22] morning I bet you they wish they left
[53:25] their camera back at the house
[53:27] because this picture can't be undone
[53:29] folks you can criticize it but right now
[53:34] right now it's in the Hall of Arts in in
[53:37] Washington DC it's in the library I
[53:39] think it's Library of Congress uh uh
[53:41] Loretta and and Josh were just there I
[53:43] seen the picture with them amen you you
[53:45] see them they've identified this as a
[53:48] supernatural
[53:49] being brother BR said not just a
[53:52] supernatural being it's the supernatural
[53:54] body of our Lord Jesus Christ it's what
[53:56] Paul met on the road to
[53:59] Damascus and it's what you met when God
[54:02] is rich in Mercy Paul was on his way to
[54:06] kill
[54:07] Christians but God rich in Mercy
[54:10] wouldn't let him do it you say oh God
[54:13] help me do this and God help me do this
[54:15] but what did God help you not do
[54:18] that that's the real answer many of you
[54:21] were headed in a direction and you would
[54:23] have done this and you would have done
[54:24] that but God rich Mercy let the brooding
[54:28] logos come down in your
[54:31] path come on you're standing there with
[54:33] his hands up brother Steven amen had a
[54:35] whole church challenging him on this
[54:37] message but you know what he did he
[54:39] didn't cower he didn't Bend knees he
[54:42] stood on the message of the hour and God
[54:45] proved him to be an adopted son in this
[54:48] generation because he stands for the
[54:50] message of the
[54:53] hour let me say more and he stood with
[54:56] me
[54:56] and God will bless you brother he'll
[54:58] bless you standing with the anointing of
[55:00] this age I tell you what'll happen you
[55:03] get the right Spirit Upon A Ministry and
[55:05] God will begin to lift that because God
[55:08] is rich in
[55:12] Mercy
[55:15] Hallelujah sir the brooding logos thank
[55:18] you Lord oh everybody will be tested on
[55:20] it yes
[55:25] sir see see it's easy to play a
[55:28] tape but get up and preach what he
[55:36] said is okay if I preach a little
[55:39] while we got people today that claim
[55:42] their fallen brother brandham and
[55:44] they're hiding behind his
[55:47] tapes and instead of being real men and
[55:50] taking this Bible and standing against
[55:53] evil spirits that try to move in a
[55:55] church and they preach against women
[55:57] cutting hair and makeup and all the
[55:59] Fashions of the age the the men of God
[56:02] stand there and do that and they take
[56:03] the criticism themselves for standing
[56:06] with what a prophet said about it but it
[56:09] would be much easier just to play a tape
[56:11] and go over and hide somewhere and act
[56:13] like brother bandam didn't say it but he
[56:15] did say it and we're responsible in this
[56:17] generation amen as the ministry come on
[56:21] now there is a brooding logos in the
[56:24] Pulpit telling the bride amen you're not
[56:28] there in justification you're not there
[56:30] in sanctification you're not there in
[56:32] the Reformation of your gifts but the
[56:35] person of Christ has come down into this
[56:37] age to be manifested by the word in his
[56:46] church well I might as well I've went
[56:48] this far now let me tell you that's the
[56:50] truth brother Steven is it the truth a
[56:52] year ago I told you what God was going
[56:54] to do yes sir Ronnie said sitting there
[56:56] as a witness we left this room and we
[56:59] walked in the back and the Holy Spirit
[57:00] spoke through me and told me because of
[57:02] the spirit you have taken towards this
[57:03] transition God's going to bless you
[57:05] above measure
[57:06] amen your ministry has been blessed more
[57:09] a year this last year than it ever has
[57:10] been yes sir you say is that because of
[57:13] you brother wank no it's what God's
[57:15] doing it's the moving of the Holy Spirit
[57:19] if you resist that you find yourself
[57:21] resisting the brooding of the Holy
[57:25] Ghost amen now amen what the Holy Spirit
[57:29] brooding brooding over the church he's
[57:33] standing brother bam said in the midst
[57:34] of the church revealing who he is in the
[57:37] last age he calls himself the author of
[57:39] the creation and this is another
[57:41] creation this has to do with the church
[57:43] this has to do with a special
[57:45] designation of himself he is the creator
[57:48] of that church the Heavenly bridegroom
[57:51] created his own
[57:53] Bride As the spirit of God he came down
[57:55] and created in the Virgin Mary the cells
[57:58] which were in the body was born and I
[58:00] want to repeat he created the very cells
[58:02] in the womb of Mary for that body it was
[58:05] not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply
[58:07] give life to a human uh egg that's
[58:09] supplied by Mary that would have been a
[58:12] sinful mankind producing body they would
[58:15] not have produced the last
[58:16] Adam now watch brother brandom he'll say
[58:19] it like this he was the New Creation man
[58:21] and God met and joined he was the first
[58:23] of new race he was the head he was the
[58:26] head of the new race amen he was the
[58:28] head he was the beginning the first born
[58:31] from the dead and in 2 Corinthians 5 it
[58:33] said any man that's in Christ is a new
[58:38] creation is it brother man said New
[58:40] Birth means
[58:42] creation see it's a new creation there
[58:45] you can see it man was of the old order
[58:47] of creation Now in Union with Christ he
[58:50] has become the new creation of God in
[58:53] Ephesians 2 and: 10 for we have his
[58:56] workmanship created in Union with Christ
[58:59] Jesus Ephesians 2:10 so that you can see
[59:02] where I'm at Heath created us in Christ
[59:05] Jesus we are not our own
[59:10] work it is the work of the creative
[59:13] logos thank you Jesus look at this it's
[59:15] powerful amen see now what happens
[59:18] brother bam says it's an evolution first
[59:20] thing God created like he created botney
[59:22] life then he created animal life then he
[59:24] created human life kind of Evolution
[59:26] Rising higher and so as it been God in
[59:30] his church justification pulling the
[59:32] bride out now he's creating his bride
[59:35] justification sanctification under
[59:37] Wesley so forth you see the evolution of
[59:40] the spirit being given more and more cu
[59:43] the body is
[59:45] building coming to the head which is
[59:48] Christ now in 65 and see not AB the
[59:51] shook now that same
[59:54] logos has has a
[59:58] part are we
[1:00:00] together that same logos has a part he's
[1:00:04] got a
[1:00:06] bride and that same logos the word that
[1:00:10] cannot be tampered with is brooding over
[1:00:13] the churches today trying to bring back
[1:00:16] the word to full
[1:00:19] manifestation oh goodness amen do you
[1:00:23] see what it was God planted it on the
[1:00:26] day of
[1:00:27] Pentecost God planted it brother bam
[1:00:29] said a holy ghost seed on the day of
[1:00:31] Pentecost he said back to that real Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost back to the gospel message back to
[1:00:36] Acts 2 see to a formula to Where it All
[1:00:40] Began
[1:00:41] at now in the original see Jesus said it
[1:00:45] wasn't so from the
[1:00:48] beginning NOW Watch What Happens he said
[1:00:51] now how are you going to teach a man to
[1:00:53] speak in
[1:00:54] tongues how are you going to teach a man
[1:00:56] to cast out Devils with power how you
[1:00:59] going to teach a man to do these things
[1:01:00] Jesus said he would how you going to
[1:01:03] teach a man to be able to stand on the
[1:01:04] platform and for tell things coming and
[1:01:07] things as it will be how you going to
[1:01:08] teach him that you
[1:01:10] can't it's a gift of God when we get
[1:01:15] away from that we've got into a hybrid
[1:01:18] condition we're back just see we got to
[1:01:21] go back to the beginning now question
[1:01:24] brother bam ask us he said I'd like
[1:01:26] science to answer this one is there such
[1:01:29] a thing as Evolution as they
[1:01:31] claim he said then why don't something
[1:01:34] rise higher than a
[1:01:36] man sir now we're not just talking about
[1:01:39] 6,000 years now watch where he goes why
[1:01:42] don't something rise higher than a man a
[1:01:45] species higher than a man because he's
[1:01:47] in the image of God nothing can go
[1:01:50] beyond its
[1:01:54] creator why can't we produce something
[1:01:57] in our ethics or in our education in our
[1:02:00] seminaries that will beat what they had
[1:02:02] at
[1:02:07] Pentecost now look why can't we get a
[1:02:10] church better than the original
[1:02:13] Pentecost through educa if see if that's
[1:02:16] how it
[1:02:19] came but the prophet saying you can't
[1:02:22] get higher than the
[1:02:24] Creator
[1:02:26] the creator of Pentecost was God himself
[1:02:30] he split himself in the pillar of fire
[1:02:32] and came down in the upper room and
[1:02:35] you'll never get higher than God coming
[1:02:39] into the
[1:02:40] church it don't go higher than that
[1:02:43] there's no life higher than that there's
[1:02:45] no Society higher than that there's no
[1:02:47] tongue higher than that there's no gift
[1:02:49] higher than that when God comes down
[1:02:51] into a church and quickens what's going
[1:02:53] on in the inside of you amen there's
[1:02:56] nothing goes higher than that it's a
[1:02:58] Pentecost we need the Holy Ghost and the
[1:03:01] mythical body formed upon this Earth
[1:03:03] that's the way it was at the beginning
[1:03:04] it breeds itself back it breeds itself
[1:03:08] back oh God bred his church back to the
[1:03:12] Holy Ghost again see what it does it
[1:03:14] breeds out the unbelief it breeds out
[1:03:17] the nonsense it breeds out the darkness
[1:03:19] it breeds out the intellect it breeds
[1:03:21] out the education God's not bringing
[1:03:24] that in
[1:03:26] amen the brooding logos is breeding that
[1:03:30] out of you 40 years Moses spent with
[1:03:34] teachers but God had to bring him to the
[1:03:37] pillar of fire to need to know what he
[1:03:41] knew God's breeding that out of man see
[1:03:44] because there'll never be nothing
[1:03:46] greater than God in a man there'll be
[1:03:48] nothing greater than when a man comes to
[1:03:50] the Holy Ghost when you get the human
[1:03:52] element out of a man when you get the
[1:03:54] education of a man when you get the
[1:03:57] knowledge out of a man and he just
[1:03:59] becomes a channel for almighty God Jesus
[1:04:02] said say you un this mountain and it
[1:04:04] shall be moved burn out the human
[1:04:06] element and see God working you like
[1:04:09] you've never seen him before when the
[1:04:11] human element goes out now these direct
[1:04:13] quotes when you get the hybrid
[1:04:16] out amen isn't it odd brother B said
[1:04:19] you'll never breed hybrid back by
[1:04:23] hybrid you'll never to take too two
[1:04:25] hybrids and get original the only way to
[1:04:28] get it back to the original is the one
[1:04:30] that created it and the only way will'll
[1:04:33] ever have another book of Acts is the
[1:04:36] one that created the book of Acts has
[1:04:39] got to come back into the church amen
[1:04:41] and breath out every other opinion and
[1:04:44] when the Holy Ghost came and he took a
[1:04:46] hold of men and that's when God began to
[1:04:49] move like he moved in those days because
[1:04:51] it was bred out of them it just wasn't
[1:04:55] in them to
[1:04:58] disbelieve how's it going to happen they
[1:05:00] didn't
[1:05:02] know they didn't know how to make it
[1:05:05] happen they wasn't there to make it
[1:05:08] happen but they knew God had came into
[1:05:11] them look what the scripture says in
[1:05:14] Matthew 24 and 24 or Matthew 24 it says
[1:05:17] where the carcass is there the Eagles
[1:05:20] we'll be gathered together now watch
[1:05:22] very carefully how brother bradam places
[1:05:26] scripture it it's it's
[1:05:28] phenomenal as God rich in Mercy he says
[1:05:31] that he bore them On Eagle's
[1:05:35] Wings to
[1:05:37] himself so there's a destination where
[1:05:39] you're
[1:05:40] going you didn't you didn't just take
[1:05:43] off on an endless Journey
[1:05:45] here there's a destination okay now the
[1:05:49] way I'm preaching you think well he
[1:05:50] don't believe in education or for for
[1:05:53] your school and for your jobs and all
[1:05:54] that don't don't go there y'all know
[1:05:55] better than that I my son's in school
[1:05:57] and I encourage anybody to go to school
[1:05:59] these men has to make livings you go to
[1:06:01] school and enjoy yourself I I'm talking
[1:06:03] about the
[1:06:05] gospel okay now what we're looking at is
[1:06:09] the eagle it
[1:06:12] gathers unto
[1:06:14] himself now where the carcass is there
[1:06:16] the Eagles now that carcass in Matthew
[1:06:18] 24 they asked brother brand they said
[1:06:20] what is that carcass he said that's
[1:06:22] Christ yes sir that's the word
[1:06:26] of the
[1:06:30] season so the eagle carries them into
[1:06:34] the feeding of the season now it's it's
[1:06:37] amazing to me because we're talking
[1:06:39] about creation of
[1:06:40] bride we're talking about a bride who
[1:06:43] the Lost has a part in this age that
[1:06:46] God's moving the
[1:06:48] church towards that
[1:06:52] Perfection where the carcass is there
[1:06:54] are the Eagles now
[1:06:56] if you go down
[1:06:58] here and you look in Revelation chapter
[1:07:01] 4 there are four different creatures
[1:07:03] there's an ox there's a lion there's a
[1:07:08] man and all of them are Earthly
[1:07:11] creatures yes
[1:07:14] sir every one of those are bound in the
[1:07:19] Earth but that fourth one is a flying
[1:07:24] eagle so when you go to the Bible in
[1:07:27] second Peter it builds a statue of a
[1:07:30] perfect man it brings you into a pyramid
[1:07:34] which Christ himself's going to cap off
[1:07:37] now that capping of that pyramid is
[1:07:39] divine
[1:07:40] intelligence that's God
[1:07:42] himself the one who put the cactus you
[1:07:45] know you ever been out to Arizona and
[1:07:47] you've been down to Tucson I had to go
[1:07:48] there to see it because I didn't
[1:07:50] understand it brother Brown was talking
[1:07:51] about but you have down in Tucson you
[1:07:53] got these cactuses and you have all this
[1:07:54] heat and then you go on Mount Lemon
[1:07:57] which is just a drive it's literally you
[1:07:59] can stand in Tucson and look up I always
[1:08:00] thought when he said that in power
[1:08:02] transformation he was talking about
[1:08:03] Flagstaff way up the hill and I'm
[1:08:05] thinking man that's a long ways up there
[1:08:07] brother random boy he says it but he's
[1:08:09] talking about Mount Lemon and you
[1:08:11] standing in in Tucson and there's
[1:08:14] cactuses 30 minutes later you can be up
[1:08:17] on top of that mountain and there's
[1:08:19] Sherman Pines big old Tall Pine
[1:08:23] trees geography same
[1:08:27] location atmosphere
[1:08:31] changes same
[1:08:33] location come on on geography is
[1:08:37] different same same geography different
[1:08:40] atmosphere so watch a Divine
[1:08:42] intelligence knew this could grow here
[1:08:45] in this
[1:08:47] atmosphere but this one can grow up
[1:08:49] there in this
[1:08:51] atmosphere now as the Church of the
[1:08:53] Living God we're not living in the
[1:08:55] bottom of the
[1:08:57] pyramid with a lion with an ox with a
[1:09:02] man they're all Earthbound atmospheres
[1:09:06] right but the eagle was a flying eagle
[1:09:10] he's the one in the top of the
[1:09:13] mountain the eagle anointing is the move
[1:09:16] of God in this generation now watch the
[1:09:19] eagle himself is a revealer of the word
[1:09:21] so Revelation is the move of God in this
[1:09:24] generation that's why Paul said be you
[1:09:27] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:09:31] amen same geography but come up higher
[1:09:34] get in Divine intelligence climb out now
[1:09:37] the reason I hit education and I hit
[1:09:40] knowledge and I hit human knowledge and
[1:09:42] I hit psychology the reason I hit all
[1:09:43] these things so hard because most if any
[1:09:46] of you are trapped that's what's
[1:09:48] trapping you it's it's what you know
[1:09:51] about
[1:09:53] yourself it's what happened to you since
[1:09:56] you were a child and you become a you
[1:09:59] become a sum total of your experiences
[1:10:02] and your failures and your mistakes and
[1:10:05] your complexes and they become like like
[1:10:07] a sack on top of you and they're holding
[1:10:10] and you're leaning to that wondering why
[1:10:13] can't I climb higher because you're
[1:10:16] standing there under your own knowledge
[1:10:19] but you've reached a summit there but
[1:10:21] right beside you is an eagle revelation
[1:10:25] that you come from God you were a seed
[1:10:27] of God to begin with you were anointed
[1:10:30] to be the bride to begin with and the
[1:10:32] god the brooding logos never quit on you
[1:10:35] and I'll tell you why he never quits on
[1:10:37] you because he has a purpose he has an
[1:10:40] anointing he has something for your life
[1:10:43] and the eagle keeps brooding and
[1:10:44] brooding and brooding until he's coming
[1:10:47] coming coming come to yourself you ever
[1:10:50] wonder why Jesus said in John 14 yet a
[1:10:52] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:10:54] more but you said see me for I will be
[1:10:56] with you even in You Until the End of
[1:10:59] the Age and Paul said that you are
[1:11:01] sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:04] he said not from revival to Revival but
[1:11:07] unto the day of redemption in other
[1:11:09] words whoever got in your ship is going
[1:11:11] to take you to the other side and
[1:11:13] there's not enough Devils there's not
[1:11:15] enough hell there's not enough intellect
[1:11:17] there's not enough knowledge that could
[1:11:19] ever sink the boat that God has set upon
[1:11:22] the waters of Life the brooding logos
[1:11:25] it's saying come on Bride come on come
[1:11:29] on to
[1:11:32] Perfection see you got a thought about
[1:11:35] you but if you could come to God's
[1:11:37] thought about
[1:11:42] you have you ever wondered why Abraham
[1:11:46] had no mistakes in the New
[1:11:50] Testament it was after the
[1:11:52] blood
[1:11:54] right but you see there was no mistakes
[1:11:57] after that but watch in the New
[1:11:59] Testament your
[1:12:02] mistakes I tell you what I got shout a
[1:12:04] fit right
[1:12:07] now this was
[1:12:10] written before you were
[1:12:14] born this was
[1:12:16] written before the Book of
[1:12:18] Life this was written before your
[1:12:21] mistakes this was written before your
[1:12:23] troubles the prophecy your life didn't
[1:12:26] include the mistake he said just forget
[1:12:28] your knowledge forget your education
[1:12:31] forget your idea come to
[1:12:34] [Applause]
[1:12:35] me I I don't know any better way to
[1:12:37] explain it than the way brother Bram
[1:12:39] explains it in the eagle story and he
[1:12:40] says Mama eagle gets up off her nest
[1:12:42] knowing she had one remember that and he
[1:12:44] said it was down in the chicken yard
[1:12:46] amen that that baby was down in the
[1:12:47] chicken yard he said Mama Eagle comes
[1:12:49] after it and she begins to scream now
[1:12:53] watch this she never ever sounded like a
[1:12:57] chicken and Chloe when the eagle found
[1:13:00] baby eagle he had no record of what had
[1:13:03] happened from the time it left the nest
[1:13:06] to the time it heard the scream it
[1:13:08] completely was not involved in what God
[1:13:11] was doing and whatever has happened from
[1:13:14] the time of your birth amen till God
[1:13:16] finds you has nothing to do with what
[1:13:19] God can do with a man woman or child let
[1:13:22] me say this this morning get over
[1:13:24] yourself get up out of that bottle of
[1:13:27] pity and get back to serving God like
[1:13:30] You' never done it before may I say to
[1:13:32] you rise up like an eagle this morning
[1:13:35] and fly back in the presence of God lay
[1:13:38] your complexes aside lay the the hurts
[1:13:41] and the abuses and the troubles lay them
[1:13:46] aside oh
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:54] Hallelujah
[1:13:56] thank you Lord From The Garden of Eden
[1:13:57] David it was promised I'll have a
[1:14:00] son isn't it amazing that M Kan that
[1:14:02] come to Abraham's
[1:14:04] door isn't
[1:14:07] it when Abraham was to have a son it was
[1:14:11] mecdc that came to
[1:14:13] Abraham because that son wouldn't be a
[1:14:15] son of Abraham it would be a Son of God
[1:14:18] but it would be known through the Flesh
[1:14:19] of Abraham as Abraham's
[1:14:22] seed that's why Paul said as being
[1:14:25] according to the flesh he was the seed
[1:14:26] of David but according to Spirit he was
[1:14:28] the power of God he was the son of
[1:14:34] God that was not Jesus that spoke to
[1:14:40] Abraham but Johnny it's one of the most
[1:14:42] powerful Revelations sir that was the
[1:14:45] Eternal
[1:14:46] logos that had picked up a body there
[1:14:49] was dust on his
[1:14:52] shoes and there was dust on his clothes
[1:14:55] amen are you hearing me God the Eternal
[1:14:59] Loos come down yes sir to have his feet
[1:15:05] washed a
[1:15:08] man how do we know it was him Abraham
[1:15:11] called him Lord Paul called him a
[1:15:15] man without beginning of days or ending
[1:15:18] of life amen look and when he washed his
[1:15:21] feet he read his heart and told him now
[1:15:23] we know it's the word that's a discerner
[1:15:25] of the thought and tent of the heart the
[1:15:27] word in the flesh good good and shortly
[1:15:31] after this happened there come forth a
[1:15:34] son Isaac through the body change of
[1:15:36] Abraham and Sarah God in theophany
[1:15:39] visited Abraham to have a son yes
[1:15:43] sir now this that we have seen in the
[1:15:45] last day is not the man
[1:15:49] Jesus but that same
[1:15:52] mdic became Jesus Christ
[1:15:56] and Jesus Christ in a supernatural body
[1:15:58] stepped into this generation and
[1:16:00] borrowed a
[1:16:02] body he borrowed a sex born body who had
[1:16:08] complexes he was from a poor family he
[1:16:12] was unliked he had no good clothes lived
[1:16:16] in a poor house come on Church his his
[1:16:19] upbringing was so bad that he hated
[1:16:21] women because of the immorality he
[1:16:23] didn't come from a a clean church
[1:16:28] family but MDC had cleansed by the blood
[1:16:32] a way to take a hold of a man and to
[1:16:35] lift him back to the same place that
[1:16:38] through the message of the hour could
[1:16:40] come a Church of the Living God isn't it
[1:16:42] something that it was built all the way
[1:16:44] up through the Old Testament but here
[1:16:46] comes mdct in the end time that when the
[1:16:49] son who was being birthed back there
[1:16:51] under Abraham is supposed to be birthed
[1:16:53] in this hour a bride seed a queen seed a
[1:16:57] royal seed don't you put that in another
[1:17:00] age brother Jaden it's not a time that
[1:17:02] we can say well Paul can do it or Martin
[1:17:05] can do it or brother Brandon can do it
[1:17:06] or oh God's going to have some great
[1:17:08] somebody come someday this is our
[1:17:14] season amen Shelby it's our season it's

[1:18:04] myself my brother Seth that's a very
[1:18:08] high
[1:18:11] place that's why the that's why the
[1:18:13] brooding
[1:18:14] logos doesn't
[1:18:17] stop
[1:18:19] Hallelujah that's
[1:18:21] it brother Guth that's why
[1:18:26] he said I will bring

[1:20:02] feel like I feel like I'm out of time so
[1:20:04] I'm just going to close here it keeps
[1:20:08] brooding than you Lord
[1:20:11] see now it would be easier okay it would
[1:20:16] be easier at
[1:20:17] times just to wide somebody up and throw
[1:20:19] them away that that would be easier
[1:20:21] wouldn't it
[1:20:23] oh when you get that when you get that
[1:20:26] young man you know and they
[1:20:29] not brother brother David knows what I'm
[1:20:31] talking
[1:20:33] about it'd be
[1:20:35] easier just to say hey I can't deal with
[1:20:39] this but as a father we have
[1:20:41] responsibility to deal with it yes
[1:20:44] sir There's issues that comes in
[1:20:47] church so well I'd rather not deal with
[1:20:50] that but as
[1:20:52] responsibility is to hold the message
[1:20:54] over over the
[1:20:57] people as a mother it's a responsibility
[1:21:00] to hold it over your children do you see
[1:21:03] that you you you it's it's God
[1:21:06] bringing he just keeps bringing the
[1:21:10] church he just keeps bringing it to this
[1:21:13] point yes Lord so he keeps brooding over
[1:21:16] it and and I know we get to the point we
[1:21:19] honestly do where we would throw away
[1:21:23] ourselves
[1:21:25] we would we' just say hey look you know
[1:21:27] I messed this up or I've said this or
[1:21:28] I've did this and it would be easier to
[1:21:31] quit than fix
[1:21:35] it we're dealing with human
[1:21:38] beings Souls
[1:21:41] lives it's not easier to quit than
[1:21:44] fix and God has got a plan for every
[1:21:47] individual in this room and he's
[1:21:49] brooding over
[1:21:51] you because he didn't ask you when he
[1:21:54] wrote it in
[1:21:56] here that's
[1:22:00] true you don't have a list of excuses

[1:22:05] spot a wrinkle except if they amen it's
[1:22:09] not there

[1:22:14] he's a determined
[1:22:16] sculptor he knows what he can do he
[1:22:19] already done it in the earth and he's
[1:22:22] doing it in you this morning you said
[1:22:24] preacher what can I do yield your will
[1:22:26] to him yield your life to him and say

[1:22:32] myself Hallelujah I'm tired of feeling
[1:22:34] that way about my own calling I'm tired
[1:22:37] of feeling that way about my position in
[1:22:39] you Lord I'm ready to receive what you
[1:22:41] said about me you said I'm a word bride
[1:22:44] I'm a word
[1:22:46] bride now I I don't amen as our
[1:22:48] musicians come I'll say this to you
[1:22:50] right now you don't realize that God has
[1:22:52] been working on this single
[1:22:55] point for 6,000
[1:22:58] years but before Eden ever fa he already
[1:23:01] knew where he would be coming to in the
[1:23:02] last
[1:23:04] days
[1:23:05] right
[1:23:07] right can you imagine taking 6,000 years
[1:23:10] to preach a sermon for one
[1:23:12] point oh
[1:23:15] yeah and you
[1:23:18] use you know preachers are bad to use
[1:23:20] examples to get a different point we use
[1:23:23] different people and you know your after
[1:23:25] but God through the entire Testament of
[1:23:29] scripture he's been pulling Moses and
[1:23:34] Aaron
[1:23:35] Levi he pulled all these
[1:23:38] points to come to this climax
[1:23:42] thought that he wouldn't unveil until
[1:23:45] the very
[1:23:52] end sister Gail the reality of this is
[1:23:56] Brother Bram said what was in the back
[1:23:57] part of his mind is now in
