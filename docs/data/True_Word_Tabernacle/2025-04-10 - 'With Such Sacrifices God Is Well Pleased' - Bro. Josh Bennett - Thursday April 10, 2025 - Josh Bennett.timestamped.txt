[41:18] lift it up to the Lord tonight. Lord
[41:21] Jesus, we just come before you, Lord.
[41:23] And Lord, just thinking about your grace
[41:26] and mercy. And Lord, I I tell I I just
[41:30] thank God
[41:32] to Lord, how great it is
[41:35] to Lord to have that unmmerited favor.
[41:39] And Lord, your mercy that is new every
[41:42] morning. And Lord, I'm so thankful for
[41:45] that cuz I need it every day. And Lord,
[41:49] I I I stand in need of your grace even
[41:51] right now. Lord, because I realize that
[41:54] my ability I there's nothing I could do
[41:57] or say that would help your people. But
[42:00] Lord, the only thing that I have is
[42:03] something you gave me. And Lord, it's
[42:05] your gift. And Lord, I just yield it to
[42:07] you. And I I pray that you would just
[42:10] take it and use it what however you want
[42:13] to. And Lord, I pray that you just
[42:15] minister to your people tonight. Lord,
[42:17] we want to just invite you. Lord, I
[42:20] believe that many have already invited
[42:22] you to come. Yes. But Lord, we don't
[42:25] want to stop there. We want to invite
[42:27] you and then we want to welcome you.
[42:30] Lord, we don't want to even stop there.
[42:32] We want to welcome you and then we want
[42:33] to give you
[42:35] preeminence. Lord, I pray that you would
[42:38] be the one that would be lifted up among
[42:41] us. And Lord, may you do the ministering
[42:43] and we'll do the
[42:45] receiving. And Lord, when we leave,
[42:47] Lord, I pray that we could leave with
[42:49] this testimony. Did not our hearts burn
[42:51] within us as you spoke with us along the
[42:54] way. Lord, we're inviting you, as it
[42:57] were, to walk with us a little while
[42:59] this evening. And Lord, may you just
[43:01] take and break the scripture to us,
[43:04] Lord. Make your word real. And Lord, I
[43:07] pray, oh God, that the word would just
[43:09] go forth in power and reality. And Lord,
[43:12] that it would just drop down in the
[43:13] hearts of your believing children.
[43:16] Lord, that lives would be changed by it.
[43:18] Well, I believe there's a power in the
[43:20] word of God that Lord, that if the word
[43:22] would be preached tonight, Lord, that
[43:24] the sick could be healed and hearts
[43:27] could be touched and lives could be
[43:29] changed, the lost could be saved, oh
[43:31] God. Lord, I I pray that that would be
[43:35] done here tonight. Grant it, Lord, as we
[43:37] just commit ourselves, we give this
[43:39] service to you for your glory. We ask it
[43:41] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. In the
[43:45] book of Hebrews in the 13th chapter, if
[43:48] you turn with me there, I'd like to read
[43:49] a few verses out of uh Hebrews chapter
[43:52] 13 and be reading from the 10th
[43:55] verse. I've been studying the book of
[43:58] Hebrews at home with my church. And uh
[44:01] just to give y'all a little bit of idea
[44:03] of how that's going, back when we was
[44:06] here uh doing the youth camp, we was
[44:08] preaching out of I think about the sixth
[44:10] chapter and we've made it to the 13th
[44:13] chapter. So, amen. So, we're doing good.
[44:20] But one brother at home, he has had a
[44:24] little girl, little baby girl. He said,
[44:26] "I think my girl's going to be driving
[44:28] by the time you get done with
[44:29] [Laughter]
[44:32] this." Hebrews chapter 13, I'm reading
[44:36] from verse
[44:38] 10. And Paul writes and said, "We have
[44:40] an altar whereof they have no right to
[44:45] eat which serve the tabernacle. For the
[44:48] bodies of those beasts whose blood is
[44:50] brought into the sanctuary by the high
[44:52] priest for sin, are burned without the
[44:54] camp." Wherefore Jesus also that he
[44:57] might sanctify the people with his own
[44:59] blood, suffered without the gate.
[45:03] Let us go forth therefore unto him
[45:06] without the camp, bearing his
[45:09] reproach. For here we have no continuing
[45:12] city, but we seek one to come. How many
[45:15] means how many's seeking that place?
[45:18] By him. Therefore, let us offer the
[45:21] sacrifice of praise to God continually.
[45:25] That is the fruit of our lips, giving
[45:27] thanks to his name. But to do good and
[45:30] to communicate, forget not. For with
[45:34] such
[45:35] sacrifices, God is well pleased. Amen.
[45:39] Amen. May God just add his blessing as
[45:41] you're seated this
[45:43] evening. I want to uh speak just uh by
[45:47] God's help this evening. If I had a
[45:50] title, I'd title it with such
[45:52] sacrifices God is well pleased. And I
[45:56] don't know about y'all, but I I want to
[45:58] please the Lord. Amen. And I I I you
[46:00] know, I kind of feel like David tonight.
[46:02] If God wanted a a a lamb, that's what I
[46:05] would have brought. If God would want
[46:08] the the uh uh the fats of rams, and I
[46:10] that's what I would have brought
[46:11] tonight. But because I want to please
[46:13] him. Amen. And so, you know, as we look
[46:16] at this tonight, of course, Paul, as
[46:19] he's dealing with this, um he's uh
[46:21] dealing with the the the Hebrews, this
[46:24] Hebrew church, and and they were, you
[46:27] know, uh maybe um uh uh real um caught
[46:32] up in uh ceremonial and ritualistic type
[46:35] of worship and being Jews and, you know,
[46:38] a and and I believe that they were
[46:40] struggling a little bit with
[46:41] Christianity because when uh they come
[46:44] and they begin to uh uh see the
[46:46] Christians, they thought, "Well, you
[46:47] know, but I where's your altar at?
[46:50] Where's your you know, we know you're
[46:51] worshiping, but you don't where's your
[46:53] altar and where's your sacrifice and
[46:56] where's all your uh uh where's all the
[46:58] ceremonial, you know, uh uh sacrifices
[47:01] and things that they were accustomed
[47:03] to." Amen. But Paul just lets them know,
[47:06] we got an altar. Amen. You may not know
[47:08] nothing about it, but we got an altar.
[47:11] Amen. Maybe you have never seen it, but
[47:13] we got an altar. Amen. And I believe
[47:16] Paul was letting them know, we got a
[47:17] sacrifice. We got a lamb. You know,
[47:19] because maybe the question on their mind
[47:21] was, you know, uh, you know, you say
[47:23] you're worshiping God, but where's the
[47:25] priest at? And Amen. And I believe that
[47:28] Paul through the book of Hebrews, he was
[47:29] letting them know, we got a high priest.
[47:32] Amen. We we got a priest. And Amen.
[47:35] We've got a lamb. And Amen. And as a
[47:37] matter of fact, we got a better
[47:39] sacrifice. Hallelujah. Amen. We got a
[47:42] better priesthood.
[47:44] Amen. We have got a a a better covenant
[47:48] established upon better promises.
[47:51] Amen. I believe that. And so, as Paul is
[47:54] is letting them know, he says, "We have
[47:56] an altar." But the thing about an altar
[47:58] is an altar is a place of worship.
[48:01] That's right. Amen. It's a place of
[48:03] sacrifice. So, if you have an altar, you
[48:05] you ought to also have a sacrifice.
[48:08] Amen. You have to have the if if there's
[48:10] an altar, then you're going to there's
[48:12] going to be worship around that altar.
[48:14] Is that right? Amen. So, as as Paul is
[48:17] is unfolding these things, and I don't
[48:19] want to get carried away preaching on
[48:21] things I don't want to preach on
[48:22] tonight, so I just want to get to the
[48:23] point, but here in the 16th verse or in
[48:26] the 15th verse rather, he said, "By
[48:28] him," Amen. by him, in other words,
[48:30] through Christ, Amen, let us offer the
[48:34] sacrifice of praise to God continually.
[48:37] That is the fruit of our lips, giving
[48:40] thanks to his name. But to do good and
[48:43] to communicate, forget not. For with
[48:45] such sacrifices, God is well pleased.
[48:49] Amen. With such sacrifices. Now, Amen.
[48:51] You know, we know that God never
[48:53] desired, Amen. burnt offerings and
[48:56] sacrifices. Amen. But all those things
[48:59] were substitutes that God accepted, but
[49:01] yet God never was pleased. Even the
[49:05] Bible said he had no pleasure in them.
[49:08] Is that right? Amen. And we know that
[49:10] all the sacrifices of the Old Testament
[49:13] never uh uh you know could never uh it
[49:16] could be a covering for sin, but it
[49:18] never took care of the sin question. It
[49:21] amen. Because with those sacrifices, the
[49:23] lambs and the bulocks and and and and
[49:26] and all that they offered unto God in
[49:28] the Old Testament. See, the life of the
[49:31] of of that animal could not come back
[49:33] upon the
[49:34] worshipper. Amen. And so the worshipper
[49:36] could never be made perfect through
[49:39] those sacrifices. And therefore, there
[49:41] was a continual offering, amen, of those
[49:44] things. But God never did desire that.
[49:46] What God was looking for was a people
[49:49] that he could live in.
[49:52] Amen. God was looking for somebody that
[49:55] would believe his word and that would be
[49:58] obedient to his word, that could live
[50:00] his word. Amen. That's what God desired.
[50:02] And I mean, you can see all through the
[50:04] Old Testament that God had he he desired
[50:07] or he wanted obedience rather than
[50:10] sacrifice. remember when uh uh the the
[50:14] king Saul went out to battle and and you
[50:17] know the story very well and how that
[50:19] the that God had instructed him what to
[50:21] do and how he was supposed to utterly
[50:23] destroy the enemy and and they went out
[50:25] there and they you know in in that
[50:27] battle. Amen. They spared a few of the
[50:30] of the oxen and the sheep and some of
[50:32] the lambs and so forth and and even some
[50:34] of the people. And then the prophet
[50:36] Samuel comes down to the camp of of
[50:39] Israel and and when he does the king
[50:42] comes out to meet him and says now he
[50:44] said we done everything God asked us to
[50:46] do. And amen and Samuel said, "Well,
[50:48] what's the bleeding of them sheep?"
[50:50] Yeah.
[50:51] And and then amen the prophet Amen
[50:54] begins to tell Samuel because or or Saul
[50:58] rather and Saul you know he's trying to
[51:00] defend himself. He said well you know we
[51:02] just kept some of the best. See for the
[51:05] purpose of giving it to God as a
[51:08] sacrifice. Is that right? Amen. We just
[51:11] you know we just spare some of these
[51:12] things so that we could offer it to God
[51:14] as a sacrifice. But Samuel said, "Hath
[51:17] not the Lord so great delight in burnt
[51:19] offerings and sacrifices as in o obeying
[51:22] the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey
[51:26] is better than sacrifice
[51:29] and to hearken than the fat of rams."
[51:32] Amen. So go the prophet was telling
[51:35] Saul, "Amen, God didn't want them
[51:37] sacrifices. He wanted you to be
[51:39] obedient."
[51:41] Amen. Jeremiah said it this way in
[51:44] Jeremiah 7. And he said, "Thus sayith
[51:45] the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
[51:47] put your burnt offerings unto your
[51:49] sacrifices, and eat flesh. For I spake
[51:52] not unto your fathers, nor commanded
[51:54] them in the day that I brought them out
[51:55] of the land of Egypt concerning burnt
[51:57] offerings or sacrifices. But this thing
[52:00] command I them, saying, Obey my voice,
[52:03] and I will be your God, and you shall be
[52:05] my people, and walk ye in all the ways
[52:09] that I have commanded you, that it may
[52:10] be well unto you." The psalmist would
[52:13] write it this way in Psalms 40 and verse
[52:16] 6. It says, "Sacrifice and offering thou
[52:18] didest not desire. Mine ears hast thou
[52:21] opened burnt offering and sin offering
[52:24] hast thou not required. Then said I, lo,
[52:27] I come in the volume of the book that is
[52:30] written of me. I delight to do thy will,
[52:33] oh God. Yay, thy law is within my
[52:36] heart." Now, I know that this is a
[52:38] prophecy concerning Christ. But how many
[52:40] of of you realize tonight that there's
[52:42] things that's also written of you?
[52:45] Amen. There there's things that is also
[52:47] written of this bride. Amen. And the and
[52:50] the sacrifice that God is looking for is
[52:53] somebody that says, "God, I come to do
[52:56] thy will. Whatever is written of me,
[52:59] that's what I want to do." Amen. Amen.
[53:01] That's what God is really desiring
[53:03] tonight is somebody that would surrender
[53:06] their life so much to him that he could
[53:09] live in and through them to fulfill his
[53:11] word. The word for this day. Amen. Now,
[53:14] David would say again in Psalms 51, he
[53:16] said, "Deliver me from the uh from blood
[53:19] guiltiness. Oh God, thou God of my
[53:22] salvation, for my tongue shall sing
[53:24] aloud of thy righteousness, oh Lord,
[53:26] open thou my lips and my mouth shall
[53:29] show forth thy praise. For thou desire
[53:32] not sacrifice, else would I give it, and
[53:34] thou delightest not in burnt offering.
[53:37] The sacrifices of God are a broken
[53:40] spirit, and a broken and a contrite
[53:43] heart, oh God, thou will not despise. Do
[53:47] good in thy pleasure and design. Build
[53:49] the walls of Jerusalem, and then shalt
[53:52] thou be pleased with the sacrifice of
[53:54] righteousness, with burnt offering, and
[53:56] the a and whole burnt offering. Then
[53:59] shalt thou offer bulocks upon thine
[54:01] altar. Amen. What is what is the
[54:03] psalmist saying here? He's saying that
[54:05] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[54:07] spirit. In other words, Amen. It don't
[54:09] do you no good to come and just give God
[54:12] a lamb if there's no sincerity behind
[54:14] what you're
[54:16] doing. And God ain't looking just for
[54:18] people to come show up at church. God is
[54:21] looking for somebody that comes, amen,
[54:24] with a sincerity. Amen. Somebody that
[54:27] amen can be broken in spirit. Somebody
[54:30] that can be contrite in their heart.
[54:32] Amen. Somebody that amen could come with
[54:35] repentance. Even
[54:38] this is the sacrifices that pleases God.
[54:43] Isaiah would say it this way. He said,
[54:45] "To what purpose?" God is speaking now.
[54:48] He said, "To what purpose is the
[54:49] multitude of your sacrifices unto me,
[54:52] sayeth the Lord? I am full of the burnt
[54:55] offerings of rams and the fat of fed
[54:57] beast. And I delight not in the blood of
[55:00] bulocks or of lambs or of the goats.
[55:02] When you come to appear before me, who
[55:04] hath required this at your hand to tread
[55:07] my courts? Bring no more vain oblations.
[55:10] Incense is an incense is an abomination
[55:13] unto me. The new moons and the Sabbath,
[55:16] the calling of assemblies I cannot away
[55:19] with. It is iniquity. Even the solemn
[55:22] meeting, your new moons and your
[55:24] appointed feasts, my soul
[55:26] hateth. They are a trouble unto me. I am
[55:29] weary to bear them. And when you spread
[55:32] forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
[55:34] from you. Yay, when you make many
[55:36] prayers, I will not hear, for your hands
[55:38] are full of blood. Wash you and make you
[55:42] clean. Put away the evil of your doings
[55:44] from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil
[55:47] and learn to do well. Seek judgment.
[55:49] Amen. Uh Relieve the oppressed, judge
[55:52] the fatherless, plead for the widow.
[55:54] Come now and let us reason together,
[55:56] sayeth the Lord. And though your sins be
[55:58] as scarlet, they shall be white as
[56:02] snow, and though they be red like
[56:04] crimson, they shall be as wool. And if
[56:07] you be willing to and obedient, you
[56:09] shall eat the good of the land.
[56:13] Amen. What is God saying? And he's
[56:15] literally, listen friends, you got to
[56:16] understand, God is not saying these
[56:19] things to a bunch of heathens.
[56:22] God is not saying these things to a
[56:24] people that's worshiping idols, but God
[56:27] is actually looking down at his people
[56:29] that have been offering sacrifices to
[56:31] him and he's saying, "Listen, amen. Your
[56:34] incense, Amen, and your and your new
[56:37] moons and and your feast and all these
[56:39] things, I actually hate them."
[56:43] And the prophet said, "Why?" Because,
[56:45] Amen. He said they they they lost their
[56:47] sincerity
[56:50] and it become tradition.
[56:53] And somebody said around here and say,
[56:55] "Well, you know, that was for Israel in
[56:58] the Old Testament. Why are you talking
[56:59] about it tonight?" Listen, friends, I'm
[57:01] scared. I'm afraid that many times,
[57:03] Amen. We got just as many traditions and
[57:07] we've made this thing something that
[57:08] it's not. Amen. And the thing about it
[57:11] is is when we lose the sincerity of what
[57:13] we're doing, it becomes a stitch in the
[57:16] nostrils of God.
[57:20] I believe that God would look around in
[57:21] the world that we're living in today and
[57:23] this modern uh uh religion that we see.
[57:26] I believe that God would look around and
[57:27] say, "What meanth this?
[57:30] What means you're gathering together?
[57:32] What meanth this? What what is this all
[57:34] about?
[57:38] That's right.
[57:40] But Paul would say by him, by Christ.
[57:44] I'll tell you something. I'll just stop
[57:46] here and say something. I don't care
[57:48] what we're doing. If we ain't doing it
[57:50] through Christ.
[57:54] Listen, friends. You know why we didn't
[57:55] bring a a lamb in here and kill it and
[57:58] lay it on this altar tonight? Cuz we
[57:59] already got a lamb.
[58:01] The reason why we didn't have to bring
[58:03] blood is because we got blood.
[58:07] Amen. So therefore, amen. Everything we
[58:09] do, we got to do it through the blood of
[58:12] Jesus Christ. If we're going to pray, if
[58:15] we're going to approach the throne, we
[58:16] got to come through that blood. If we're
[58:18] going to sing, we're going to sing
[58:19] through that blood. If we're going to
[58:21] preach, we got to preach through that
[58:22] blood. Listen, whatever we offer God,
[58:25] it's got to be by through Jesus
[58:28] Christ. Hallelujah. And I'll tell you
[58:30] this, there is no other place of worship
[58:33] tonight outside of Christ.
[58:37] God will accept you. Amen. And neither
[58:40] will he accept your worship except in
[58:42] Christ.
[58:45] [Applause]
[58:47] Amen. You believe that?
[58:50] So he said, "By him, therefore, let us
[58:51] offer the sacrifice of praise unto God
[58:54] continually. That is the fruit of our
[58:56] lips, giving thanks to his name." Now, I
[58:58] believe that Paul is actually uh uh he's
[59:01] actually showing us, Amen, that what
[59:04] would be pleasing unto God. He's
[59:06] revealing to us a praise that would be
[59:09] pleasing unto God.
[59:12] Now, Amen. He starts out by saying, "Let
[59:14] us by him." Amen. Uh, in other words,
[59:18] since we have a an altar
[59:22] and we do have a high priest,
[59:25] we should always offer sacrifices.
[59:28] That's right. Amen. And listen, friends,
[59:30] how many know that Paul said it this
[59:32] way? He said that our that we have to
[59:34] offer unto God our bodies, we present
[59:37] them to him as a living sacrifice,
[59:41] which is a our reasonable service unto
[59:43] the Lord. Amen. And so, amen. But, but
[59:47] yet, as as we look at this, the writer,
[59:50] uh, Paul, as he's writing here to the
[59:52] Hebrews, he says that praise that
[59:54] pleases God is to be offered to him by
[59:58] Jesus Christ. Amen. And it should be
[1:00:01] continually.
[1:00:05] God desires worship continually.
[1:00:09] I'm gonna just say this. Amen. Because
[1:00:11] and and I you know back home I I say
[1:00:14] three times a week but you know but you
[1:00:16] know I'll just use it this way here
[1:00:18] because you got church on Sunday and
[1:00:19] Thursday. I want to tell you something.
[1:00:21] If the only time you praising God is
[1:00:23] when you're in church, you ain't
[1:00:26] praising God.
[1:00:28] [Applause]
[1:00:30] Amen. If the only time you worship is
[1:00:32] when you come to church couple times a
[1:00:35] week or one
[1:00:37] or we could keep on going, you know, but
[1:00:40] Amen. But if that's the only time that
[1:00:42] you're praising God, that's the only
[1:00:44] time you're worshiping God, you ain't
[1:00:46] worshiping God. You're putting on a
[1:00:48] show.
[1:00:52] Hello. Listen, friends, if the only time
[1:00:55] you're praising God is when somebody's
[1:00:57] watching, you're putting on a show. If
[1:00:59] the only time you worship is when
[1:01:01] somebody else is doing it, you're just
[1:01:03] putting on a show.
[1:01:05] But but Paul said the the worship that
[1:01:08] pleases God should be offered
[1:01:10] continually.
[1:01:11] [Applause]
[1:01:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. David
[1:01:17] would say it like this. I will bless the
[1:01:19] Lord at all times.
[1:01:21] I like David's revel. I will bless the
[1:01:24] Lord at all times. You say, "What are
[1:01:26] you talking about, preacher? I'm talking
[1:01:27] about good times. I'm talking about bad
[1:01:30] times. I'm talking about when you're
[1:01:31] sick and when you're well. when there's
[1:01:34] money in the bank and when there ain't
[1:01:35] no money in the bank. Hallelujah. I will
[1:01:39] bless the Lord at all times.
[1:01:43] His praise shall continually be in my
[1:01:46] mouth.
[1:01:48] Hallelujah.
[1:01:50] You know, you can't even preach about
[1:01:52] worship and praise without talking about
[1:01:53] David. That's right. Cuz I tell you
[1:01:55] what, David had a
[1:01:57] revelation. David knew how to praise
[1:01:59] God.
[1:02:01] Amen. And you know, when you think about
[1:02:02] continual worship, I think about the
[1:02:04] tabernacle of David. And you know, David
[1:02:07] uh uh uh uh when the ark was returning
[1:02:10] back and was coming back to Israel.
[1:02:12] Amen. David, and I don't want to get
[1:02:14] again, listen, don't judge this sermon.
[1:02:16] I ain't trying to teach. I'm just
[1:02:18] preaching. So, I know there's a lot of
[1:02:19] points I'm going to miss. Amen. But I'm
[1:02:21] trying to get somewhere. So, just bear
[1:02:23] with me. Amen. But as that word is
[1:02:25] coming back and David sees the word
[1:02:27] coming. Now you you understand by the
[1:02:29] scripture that David had prepared a
[1:02:32] place. He had prepared a tent. He had
[1:02:36] prepared a place for the word to
[1:02:38] come. But when David saw the word
[1:02:40] coming, Amen. If you go back in your
[1:02:42] Bible, you'll see that they were
[1:02:44] continually offering sacrifices as the
[1:02:47] word was coming. They was slaying
[1:02:48] bulocks and they was and they was uh
[1:02:50] pouring out the blood. And Amen. Brother
[1:02:53] Wayne talked about I I remember years
[1:02:54] ago him preaching on it. All the gallons
[1:02:56] of blood that was actually poured out to
[1:02:58] make a way for that word. Amen. And the
[1:03:00] whole point of it was is that word to
[1:03:03] get to its destination to the place that
[1:03:06] David had prepared for it. And the place
[1:03:08] that he prepared was a tent.
[1:03:12] I don't know if y'all know this or not,
[1:03:13] but you are the
[1:03:16] tent. The tabernacle of David. Amen. And
[1:03:19] there was a tent and it was a place
[1:03:21] prepared to receive the
[1:03:23] word. Oh my goodness. I feel like
[1:03:26] preaching right there because I tell you
[1:03:28] what, Revelations 10 said it this way.
[1:03:30] There was a mighty angel that came down
[1:03:32] from God out of heaven and he had a book
[1:03:34] hoping in his hand and he come down.
[1:03:37] Listen, I know the word always comes to
[1:03:40] a
[1:03:41] prophet. And that's why there was a
[1:03:43] seventh angel on the earth. Amen. At the
[1:03:46] time of that coming, that mighty angel
[1:03:48] come down to the seventh angel. But
[1:03:50] friends, amen, the word, Amen, was
[1:03:52] never, Amen. Listen, when that mighty
[1:03:54] angel brought that book down, Amen. and
[1:03:57] handed it down to the seventh angel, it
[1:03:59] was not for the purpose that a prophet
[1:04:01] could stand there with a word in his
[1:04:03] hand and just walk around on the earth
[1:04:05] with the word in his hand. But the word
[1:04:08] came to the prophet that the prophet
[1:04:10] might preach thy word
[1:04:14] that you and I might receive thy word.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. The
[1:04:21] whole point of the thing was that the
[1:04:24] word would be in the bride.
[1:04:30] Glory to God. And when David saw that
[1:04:33] word coming, you know what he done? He
[1:04:36] started dancing.
[1:04:39] He started dancing before the ark. And I
[1:04:42] know sometimes, you know, people have
[1:04:44] trouble with it. But I tell you what, I
[1:04:45] don't mind dancing. Amen. As long as
[1:04:47] you're dancing about the right thing.
[1:04:50] And David saw the word coming and he got
[1:04:52] so excited about the word being
[1:04:54] restored. You know why? Cuz David had a
[1:04:57] revelation. He said, "Amen. David knew
[1:04:59] if thy word ever gets back in its
[1:05:02] rightful place, victory will be back in
[1:05:06] the
[1:05:07] camp because with the restoration of the
[1:05:10] word will come a restoration of
[1:05:14] power. David knew if we get the word
[1:05:17] back in its place, amen, our enemies are
[1:05:20] defeated. If we get the word back in
[1:05:22] this place, sickness will be healed,
[1:05:26] lives will be changed.
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:30] That's what David was dancing about.
[1:05:33] Hallelujah.
[1:05:35] Had a cup running over. Brother said his
[1:05:38] cup got to running over.
[1:05:41] When he saw the word returning back.
[1:05:46] Hallelujah. Amen. His cut. And know you
[1:05:48] know his wife looked out the window and
[1:05:50] she was sure ashamed.
[1:05:53] She sure got ashamed. Amen. But I like
[1:05:56] David. David, you know, he didn't let
[1:05:59] Amen. his ashamed wife bother him. As a
[1:06:02] matter of fact, he told her, "If you
[1:06:03] think I was something, wait till next
[1:06:05] time."
[1:06:08] Come on, church. Amen. And and David,
[1:06:12] Amen, danced before the ark. But you
[1:06:14] know the thing about it is is when that
[1:06:16] ark begin to come the I think it's so
[1:06:18] beautiful because when that ark, Amen,
[1:06:21] found its resting place. Amen. David
[1:06:24] began to appoint singers and musicians
[1:06:27] and the Levites and Amen. And what did
[1:06:29] he appoint them for the purpose of doing
[1:06:31] to
[1:06:33] continually minister before the
[1:06:36] Lord? Because in the tabernacle of
[1:06:38] David, listen friends, the worshiper in
[1:06:40] David's tabernacle wasn't just a couple
[1:06:43] times a year.
[1:06:46] It wasn't just on the appointed Sabbath
[1:06:47] days and amen and the ceremonial ties.
[1:06:51] But David said, "I tell you what I want
[1:06:52] you to do from morning to evening, all
[1:06:55] the time, every day, I want you to
[1:06:57] continually offer sacrifice unto God and
[1:07:00] praise him." Listen, friends, and that's
[1:07:02] the sacrifices that pleases God.
[1:07:10] A continual worship.
[1:07:14] You know what? God loved David's
[1:07:16] tabernacle. And God even prophesied in
[1:07:19] the in the Old Testament and he said, "I
[1:07:22] will restore it.
[1:07:24] I I'll build it again and bind up the
[1:07:28] breaches of it." Amen. Amen. And and
[1:07:31] listen, it's got a connection with you.
[1:07:33] Oh, glory. It's tied to the
[1:07:36] Gentiles. Amen. And even Paul uses in
[1:07:39] Acts 15 and says that the residue of men
[1:07:42] might seek after the Lord and all
[1:07:43] Gentiles upon whom my name shall be
[1:07:46] called, sayith the Lord, who doeth all
[1:07:48] these things. That's right. Cuz God
[1:07:51] loved David's tabernacle.
[1:07:54] With such sacrifices, God is well
[1:07:56] pleased.
[1:07:59] A praise that is
[1:08:01] continually. And then Paul would go on
[1:08:04] to say he calls it a sacrifice of
[1:08:07] praise, right?
[1:08:11] Yeah. You know what that means? It may
[1:08:14] be costly, right?
[1:08:17] And inconvenient.
[1:08:20] That's right.
[1:08:22] True. You know, I think about David
[1:08:25] again. Remember when David in the
[1:08:27] scripture, he send numbering the people?
[1:08:29] Yeah. And and and
[1:08:32] And a prophet rose up and went down
[1:08:34] there and told David said, you know, he
[1:08:36] gave him a he actually gave David a
[1:08:39] choice. Yeah. He said, you know, he said
[1:08:41] pestilence could come in the land or you
[1:08:43] know, I'll deliver in your hand to your
[1:08:45] enemies. I don't remember all exactly
[1:08:46] how it was, but he gave David a choice
[1:08:48] of you, you know, of the penalty of the
[1:08:51] sin that he had that he had committed
[1:08:53] and number of people. And David, I love
[1:08:55] I love David's answer because, you know,
[1:08:57] David was in a in a bad spot. And David
[1:09:00] knew he was. Amen. But David had he had
[1:09:03] a a
[1:09:04] revelation. And he said, "I tell you
[1:09:06] what, I'll just put myself in the hands
[1:09:08] of a merciful God.
[1:09:11] Don't put me in the hands of men. I
[1:09:13] don't want to be under the judgment of
[1:09:15] men. I just put myself in the hands of a
[1:09:17] merciful God."
[1:09:19] I feel like David tonight. Listen, I
[1:09:21] made many mistakes and I'm still making
[1:09:23] them. And I'll probably make a lot more.
[1:09:24] But I'm glad I'm in the hands of a
[1:09:26] merciful God. Cuz I tell you this,
[1:09:28] there's a lot of men gave up on me. But
[1:09:31] God ain't never gave up on me. He ain't
[1:09:34] never let me get by with nothing. And
[1:09:36] I've had to pay for a lot of things. But
[1:09:38] I tell you this, everything I pay for I
[1:09:40] deserve. And it was all for the purpose.
[1:09:43] Amen. That God could get me in the
[1:09:46] position that he wanted me in. That's
[1:09:49] right. Amen. I just put myself in the
[1:09:51] hands of a merciful God. But the thing
[1:09:53] about it is is David come to a spot and
[1:09:56] he said he wanted to offer some
[1:09:57] sacrifice unto God. And there was a man
[1:10:00] out there had a field and David went up
[1:10:01] to the place and he and he wanted to
[1:10:03] build an altar and a and he wanted to
[1:10:06] offer God a sacrifice. Amen. And when he
[1:10:09] did, Amen. this man out there, he said,
[1:10:12] "Listen," he said, "if it's pleasing to
[1:10:14] the king." He said, "You ain't got to
[1:10:16] buy nothing from me. You You can have
[1:10:18] this. You can build your altar right
[1:10:20] here and and here's oxen and here's plow
[1:10:23] stalks and you can take the the
[1:10:25] instruments uh uh uh that I plow with
[1:10:28] and and make a fire out of and you can
[1:10:30] take my oxen and and make a sacrifice.
[1:10:33] And David refused it. He said, "Listen,"
[1:10:36] he said, "I'll buy." He said, "Because I
[1:10:38] refused to offer anything to God that
[1:10:41] didn't cost me something."
[1:10:45] David refused to offer God something
[1:10:48] that it didn't cost him anything. And I
[1:10:51] tell you what, church, when I look
[1:10:52] around today, I believe that we have
[1:10:54] cheapened.
[1:10:56] [Applause]
[1:10:58] And what we got, Amen, in this modern
[1:11:00] religious world that we live in, it's a
[1:11:02] bunch of cheap worship.
[1:11:08] And we got people that, amen, are
[1:11:10] Christians only when it's convenient.
[1:11:15] And they only go to church when it's
[1:11:16] convenient.
[1:11:18] And they serve God when it's convenient.
[1:11:22] And they worship when it's convenient.
[1:11:26] My question is is what did it cost you?
[1:11:31] What are you offering to God tonight?
[1:11:33] And what did it cost you?
[1:11:36] Some of y'all know what I'm talking
[1:11:37] about because there's people and I look
[1:11:39] around in this building tonight and I
[1:11:41] know and I see people sitting right here
[1:11:43] tonight. Amen. And it's cost you a lot
[1:11:45] to be here.
[1:11:48] Amen. And you see people in church
[1:11:50] sometimes and brother Wayne and brother
[1:11:52] Ray, you know what I'm talking about.
[1:11:53] And you look down, you look out at the
[1:11:55] congregation, you see tears flowing down
[1:11:57] a face and you see hands start lifting
[1:11:59] up. And you know the life of that
[1:12:01] person. You know what's behind that. And
[1:12:03] you know the cost of that praise and you
[1:12:06] know the things that they've been
[1:12:09] through. Amen. But that's a sacrifice
[1:12:12] that God is well
[1:12:15] pleased. Come on. God wants a people
[1:12:18] that's going to serve him
[1:12:22] regardless. God wants somebody like Job
[1:12:26] that can say the Lord giveth and the
[1:12:28] Lord taketh away. A blessing be the name
[1:12:32] of the Lord.
[1:12:36] Hallelujah. I tell you what, church, I
[1:12:38] feel like this tonight, I believe that
[1:12:40] God said sometimes God, Amen, is having
[1:12:43] a a a counsel in heaven like he did in
[1:12:45] the days of Job.
[1:12:47] I don't know about y'all, but I I think
[1:12:49] back home, I told my church one time, I
[1:12:51] said, I think God, Amen, was having a
[1:12:53] conversation with Satan, and he said,
[1:12:55] "Have you ever considered apostolic
[1:12:57] tabernacle?"
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:03] Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:13:04] about. Y'all ever think that God might
[1:13:07] have had a conversation with Satan and
[1:13:09] said, "You ever consider True
[1:13:11] Word? You ever consider True Word
[1:13:14] tabernacle?" And Satan said, "Yeah, I
[1:13:17] have." But the thing about it is is that
[1:13:19] ain't fair
[1:13:22] cuz you build a hedge around them and
[1:13:24] they're always in revival
[1:13:29] and come on. And and there's so much
[1:13:33] love in that church until I can't even
[1:13:35] hardly get in there. and and you know
[1:13:37] and you built such a hedge around them
[1:13:39] and and man they got such good song
[1:13:41] services and
[1:13:46] pre
[1:13:48] and God said okay go ahead
[1:13:51] go ahead and go in there and stir up
[1:13:52] some trouble I tell you what I'm even
[1:13:55] going to allow you to make a a cause
[1:13:57] problems between a couple families and
[1:14:00] stir up all kind of
[1:14:03] problems but you know I love some I love
[1:14:05] something about the Bible. Amen. That
[1:14:07] everything that God allowed Satan to do
[1:14:09] to Job, there was limitations.
[1:14:13] At first, he said, "Go take everything
[1:14:14] he's got, but don't you touch him."
[1:14:16] Satan comes back and he said, "Oh, but
[1:14:18] you see, if you just turn me loose and
[1:14:21] let me touch him, I'll make him curse
[1:14:22] you, too. Go ahead. Go ahead and touch
[1:14:24] him, but don't you take his life." He
[1:14:27] can only go as far as God would allow
[1:14:28] him to
[1:14:30] go. Come on, church. And I got a word
[1:14:32] for you tonight that the devil can cause
[1:14:35] all kind of problems in the church. And
[1:14:38] he can stir up all kind of strife and
[1:14:40] cause troubles between families and
[1:14:43] situations and all kind of things he can
[1:14:46] do. But there was a word in this Bible
[1:14:49] that he said, "Don't you touch the oil
[1:14:52] or the
[1:14:53] wine." Hallelujah. And brother, I tell
[1:14:56] you what, the devil can do all kind of
[1:14:58] things, but he can't take away the
[1:15:01] stimulation of the
[1:15:03] revelation. Hallelujah. He can't touch
[1:15:06] the oil of the Holy
[1:15:13] Ghost. Hallelujah. Oh, but he'll come
[1:15:15] and he'll he'll do all kind of things.
[1:15:17] But the thing about it is he ain't
[1:15:19] stopped you.
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:24] He stopped you.
[1:15:30] All kind of bad things happen and you
[1:15:32] just praise God anyhow. Amen.
[1:15:36] Because it's called a sacrifice
[1:15:39] of praise.
[1:15:41] You know Jesus come to the temple one
[1:15:43] day. I better check that.
[1:15:46] And and and
[1:15:48] and when he did, he found the money
[1:15:51] changers. You remember that?
[1:15:55] And he and and and they were out there,
[1:15:58] you know, ch exchanging money so they
[1:16:00] could pay their temple tax. and which
[1:16:03] I've done a lot of study on it years ago
[1:16:06] and found out
[1:16:07] that you know there was times that there
[1:16:11] could be close to 2 million Jews that
[1:16:13] were coming to the temple at that
[1:16:16] time and they all were required to pay a
[1:16:19] temple tax and they said that it was uh
[1:16:22] equivalent to like two days
[1:16:24] wages but they had to pay it in a
[1:16:27] certain
[1:16:28] um coin and that's why the money changed
[1:16:32] ers were there to exchange the money,
[1:16:34] you see.
[1:16:35] and and then they had also a market set
[1:16:39] up selling lambs and turtle doves
[1:16:44] and and and history says that they at
[1:16:47] first they had kept it
[1:16:49] separate maybe over by the pool of of
[1:16:52] you know whatever that pool I can't I
[1:16:55] can't remember the name of it right now
[1:16:56] but and they and they said in history
[1:16:58] but they said it began to move closer
[1:17:00] and closer until it was right in the
[1:17:02] temple it and Jesus come into the house
[1:17:05] of the temple and he finds in there the
[1:17:08] money changers and they're selling the
[1:17:11] the the the sacrifices.
[1:17:13] You know what they had done? They had
[1:17:15] made worship very convenient.
[1:17:20] So that the people that was coming, you
[1:17:22] know, God wanted a lamb. I got a quote
[1:17:25] for this, by the way.
[1:17:27] God wanted a lamb, but because you, you
[1:17:31] know, it was just too much trouble for
[1:17:32] them to keep a lamb in the in up all
[1:17:35] year and, you know, and they had to feed
[1:17:37] that thing and take care of it and keep
[1:17:39] it alive and and then they had to bring
[1:17:40] it with them to the temple and and they
[1:17:42] had to, you know, they'd had to drag
[1:17:44] that lamb to church. Amen. And it was a
[1:17:47] little bit of trouble, you know, and
[1:17:48] they didn't want to have to do all that.
[1:17:50] So, they made it more convenient. You
[1:17:51] can just come and buy a lamb.
[1:17:55] You see the attitude begin to change of
[1:17:58] how they come to worship
[1:18:03] and the sincerity begin to leave.
[1:18:07] And then they showed up at church.
[1:18:09] I mean right on time.
[1:18:13] I'm talking about like when it
[1:18:16] starts or or a few minutes
[1:18:20] after. Yeah. I I don't know. I didn't
[1:18:22] see y'all come.
[1:18:24] It's Thursday night and you know
[1:18:26] sometimes you know I
[1:18:28] understand I'm just talking about people
[1:18:30] in North Carolina not in
[1:18:34] Ohio. You know we sitting back in the
[1:18:36] back sometimes and you look out in the
[1:18:38] you know on the screen and look out the
[1:18:40] congregation they and one of the
[1:18:42] brothers say looks like it's going to be
[1:18:43] thin today. I say just give it some
[1:18:48] time. Just give it some time.
[1:18:53] You don't know who's gonna be there till
[1:18:54] about 15
[1:18:56] after, you
[1:18:57] know, but really, you know, you say that
[1:19:00] we, you know, I say that and and and but
[1:19:04] but there's a reality behind it.
[1:19:08] See, they had made the thing so
[1:19:10] convenient that they just got there,
[1:19:11] they just showed up, they just bought
[1:19:12] him a lamb. There was a priest right
[1:19:15] there that they could pay to examine it.
[1:19:19] And the whole thing had just become a a
[1:19:21] money-making
[1:19:25] And you know it's amazing that you'll
[1:19:26] never find in this Bible where Jesus
[1:19:28] took and drove anybody into the temple.
[1:19:32] He didn't beat nobody into into the
[1:19:34] temple, but he did beat some of them
[1:19:37] out.
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:41] Come on, church. The Holy Spirit's a
[1:19:43] gentleman.
[1:19:45] But the prophet of God said when it come
[1:19:47] to something that broke the harmony
[1:19:49] between the father.
[1:19:52] He said that's where Jesus drew the
[1:19:55] line. Hallelujah. Amen. And he didn't
[1:19:58] drive nobody in. But brother Amen. When
[1:20:01] they desecrated the house of God, he
[1:20:04] platted a whip.
[1:20:07] I show you something else about that.
[1:20:08] Jesus didn't do it just out of a rage of
[1:20:10] anger.
[1:20:13] Don't try to make God have a temper.
[1:20:16] He didn't just do it out of a, you know,
[1:20:17] he wasn't just a mad preacher got up
[1:20:19] and, you know, started preaching on
[1:20:21] everybody cuz he's upset. No, that's not
[1:20:23] what it was. He sat down and thought it
[1:20:26] through and literally took the time
[1:20:30] to to to weave the cords together.
[1:20:36] Come on, friends.
[1:20:38] He wasn't just mad in a fit of anger.
[1:20:40] Yeah. Right. I I was when I was
[1:20:43] studying, I I found also that that that
[1:20:45] he probably they said that those
[1:20:47] historians said he probably picked up
[1:20:49] the little cords that they had used to
[1:20:52] tie up the
[1:20:54] lambs that that they had had laying
[1:20:57] around because when they and they keep
[1:20:59] them little lambs and things tied up and
[1:21:01] then when they would give them to the
[1:21:02] worer, they release those things and lay
[1:21:04] throw them cords down and he just
[1:21:06] gathered them things up.
[1:21:10] and begin to weave them together. Amen.
[1:21:13] For the purpose of driving them out of
[1:21:16] the temple because he said, "You made
[1:21:18] the house of God a den of thieves." And
[1:21:21] this place is supposed to be the house
[1:21:23] of prayer. Come on, church. I tell you
[1:21:25] what, there's a lot of people today made
[1:21:26] it an entertainment house and a concert
[1:21:29] hall. But this is a house of
[1:21:32] prayer. The church is supposed to be a
[1:21:35] place of praise and worship.
[1:21:38] We are not here to be entertained.
[1:21:43] We are not here to entertain one
[1:21:45] another. We are here to worship Almighty
[1:21:48] God.
[1:21:50] Hallelujah. And I tell you what the
[1:21:52] question that was on the woman at the
[1:21:54] whale's heart was. Amen. And she come
[1:21:56] and she told Jesus, "Amen. We've
[1:21:58] worshiped God on this mountain. Y'all
[1:21:59] worship God over here. But the real
[1:22:01] question he asked is where do we worship
[1:22:04] God?" And Jesus said, "The hour is
[1:22:06] coming, and now is that they that
[1:22:09] worship God must worship him in spirit
[1:22:13] and in truth."
[1:22:17] That's right. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:20] Hallelujah.
[1:22:23] Come. You know, I tell you what,
[1:22:25] friends. I believe God deserves the
[1:22:26] best.
[1:22:29] God don't deserve what you got left.
[1:22:31] Amen.
[1:22:33] There's many times I believe that that's
[1:22:34] what we give to God. Whatever we got
[1:22:37] left over, you know, after we give to
[1:22:40] everything else and we give God, we
[1:22:43] give, you know, we give ourselves to our
[1:22:45] job, but we give oursel to and I
[1:22:47] understand those things. We got to, you
[1:22:48] know, you got to make a living. You got
[1:22:50] to be a provider. We got to do those
[1:22:51] things. Amen. That's admirable actually
[1:22:54] for you to do those things. Amen. But
[1:22:56] the thing about it is, amen, is God
[1:22:59] deserves the very best that you have to
[1:23:01] give.
[1:23:03] Amen. God deserves the best. Amen. Not
[1:23:07] some leftover something.
[1:23:10] Not some superficial put on.
[1:23:14] Come on, church. God deserves praise
[1:23:16] from the heart.
[1:23:18] God deserves a worship that that's
[1:23:20] coming out of a life that's been
[1:23:22] changed. That's right. Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:23:26] A sacrifice.
[1:23:31] Brother Brham said Jehovah required a
[1:23:34] lamb for your sins, but you didn't raise
[1:23:36] a lamb.
[1:23:38] So you have a kind old priest.
[1:23:41] See that your soul would not be lost.
[1:23:43] They had some sellers to go up there in
[1:23:45] the courts and make little cages and put
[1:23:47] lambs in
[1:23:49] there. So you could take your income
[1:23:51] that you have done made not of lambs but
[1:23:55] made of something else to keep our
[1:23:57] economy going. And when you got sin
[1:24:00] burdened and you want to get released
[1:24:02] from your sins, a kindo priest had a
[1:24:04] place you could go and buy a lamb. But
[1:24:06] God didn't want your money. Right.
[1:24:10] He said a lamb
[1:24:12] and you went and bought a lamb. But what
[1:24:14] did Jesus of Nazareth do? He come and
[1:24:16] kicked them things out and emptied them
[1:24:19] and told them you it's a den of thieves.
[1:24:24] Listen, Paul would go on to say the
[1:24:27] praise that pleases God, the sacrifices
[1:24:29] that please God is a is a worship
[1:24:31] offered to God continually. It's a
[1:24:34] sacrifice of praise. Yeah. Other words,
[1:24:38] something that's it may be inconvenient.
[1:24:41] Yeah. You may not feel like it, right?
[1:24:46] Yeah. Hey, man. I'll tell you what. I
[1:24:47] challenge you to do this next time you
[1:24:49] you come to church and you don't feel
[1:24:51] like it. Well, you know, hey, I'm going
[1:24:54] to just be honest with y'all. Uhoh.
[1:25:00] Thank you, brother.
[1:25:04] Maybe that was a warning to be careful
[1:25:06] how
[1:25:10] honest. You know what? You know what? Uh
[1:25:14] cuz I told the church back home, I said,
[1:25:17] you know, it really ain't much danger
[1:25:18] nobody making a god out of
[1:25:21] me. I'll make too many
[1:25:23] mistakes. And I tell to I tell on myself
[1:25:26] all the time, but you know, I'll be I'm
[1:25:30] going to be honest with you. There's
[1:25:31] times I don't want to come to church
[1:25:32] either,
[1:25:36] man. Is that Is that surprise you? Let
[1:25:40] me shock you. There's times I don't want
[1:25:42] to come to church.
[1:25:44] There's times I don't feel like it. And
[1:25:46] there's times I just absolutely don't
[1:25:48] want to.
[1:25:50] You know what? And even get the
[1:25:51] attitude. Sometimes you'll justify
[1:25:52] yourself.
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:56] I know I've done it cuz I thought, man,
[1:25:59] they come to church when they want to,
[1:26:01] and they don't when they don't.
[1:26:05] And if they can do it, shouldn't I be
[1:26:07] able
[1:26:10] to come on? Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:26:13] about.
[1:26:15] But that don't make it right.
[1:26:20] Amen. But I'll tell you something else.
[1:26:21] Amen. There's times that I've questioned
[1:26:23] myself, Brother Wayne. I've actually
[1:26:24] asked myself this question. I wonder how
[1:26:26] good a Christian I would be if I wasn't
[1:26:28] a preacher because I tell you what I'm
[1:26:31] talking about. There's times that I
[1:26:34] absolutely read my Bible cuz I have to.
[1:26:38] You understand what I'm saying? There's
[1:26:40] time, listen, I ain't got no choice. Cuz
[1:26:43] Sunday's coming around the corner and
[1:26:46] Wednesday night's going to show up again
[1:26:47] and I I ain't got no choice. I got to
[1:26:50] listen to tapes. I got to read this
[1:26:52] Bible. if I'm gonna have something to
[1:26:54] preach, brother. I got to study.
[1:26:57] But I wonder sometimes I wonder how much
[1:26:59] I would do that if I didn't have to.
[1:27:04] And church, I'm going to tell you, if
[1:27:06] you're just
[1:27:07] fulfilling a seat out of some uh
[1:27:10] religious duty,
[1:27:13] that is not what God's looking for.
[1:27:16] [Applause]
[1:27:18] God is looking for somebody that come to
[1:27:20] worship. Amen.
[1:27:23] That's coming to praise. That's coming
[1:27:25] to pull.
[1:27:28] That's coming. Amen. Because they got a
[1:27:29] need and they know there's a God that
[1:27:32] can meet my need.
[1:27:36] Hallelujah. Amen. And I tell you this,
[1:27:38] even though sometimes I ask myself that
[1:27:40] question, there's something on the
[1:27:41] inside of me that I know even if I did
[1:27:44] never preach another sermon, amen,
[1:27:46] there's a seat of God on the inside of
[1:27:48] my
[1:27:50] heart. I couldn't quit if I wanted to,
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:27:56] brother. You say, "What are you talking
[1:27:58] about, preacher?" Listen, I've tried
[1:28:00] many times. You don't even know the how
[1:28:02] many times I preached my last sermon.
[1:28:05] All right. You don't know the times I
[1:28:07] said, "I'm done. I quit. I ain't going
[1:28:09] back."
[1:28:12] Just like the prophet when the devil was
[1:28:14] sitting there on his shoulder and
[1:28:16] telling him, "Well, if he don't think no
[1:28:17] more of you than this and amen, of you
[1:28:19] and everything." Brother Bill said this,
[1:28:21] everything that Satan told him was true.
[1:28:26] And he was just getting ready to say,
[1:28:27] "Well, if that's the way it is or if
[1:28:29] that's the way God feels, if that's the
[1:28:31] but something on the inside of
[1:28:35] him." Glory to God. It was something on
[1:28:38] the inside of him. Brother, that's what
[1:28:40] God was looking for. And that's the pray
[1:28:43] and the sacrifice that pleases God.
[1:28:49] church. I want to just tell you tonight,
[1:28:51] quit worshiping God by a feeling.
[1:28:56] Ain't got nothing to do with
[1:29:00] feelings. True worship and a praise that
[1:29:04] comes from the heart, sacrifices that
[1:29:07] pleases God, is not
[1:29:09] emotional. It comes with emotion, but
[1:29:12] it's not emotion. Ain't got nothing to
[1:29:15] do with feeling. Because I tell you why.
[1:29:18] Because if there's a real worship in
[1:29:20] your heart, you're going to praise God
[1:29:21] when you feel it and when you don't.
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:27] Hallelujah. You're going to praise God.
[1:29:30] Amen. If there's somebody beside you, if
[1:29:32] there are, if you're the only one,
[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:41] it's a sacrifice. Right.
[1:29:44] And Paul says it's the fruit of your
[1:29:46] lips. Sometimes we get the idea, you
[1:29:49] know, well well God knows my
[1:29:53] heart and you know and
[1:29:56] and I'm not trying I'm not trying to
[1:30:00] beat you up church,
[1:30:02] but I just tell you what the Bible says
[1:30:04] in the book of Hosea. It says, "Oh
[1:30:06] Israel, return unto the Lord thy God,
[1:30:08] for thou has fallen by thine iniquity,
[1:30:10] and take with you words, right? And turn
[1:30:14] to the Lord, and say unto him, take away
[1:30:16] all iniquity, and receive us graciously,
[1:30:19] for we will render the calves of our
[1:30:22] lips."
[1:30:24] The prophet literally, Amen, identifies
[1:30:28] the praise that comes from the lips of a
[1:30:31] man as as a sacrifice like unto a
[1:30:35] calf offered unto God. Oh, I just think
[1:30:39] about David one time in the Bible. David
[1:30:41] said it this way. He said, "Let my
[1:30:43] prayer be as the incense and let the
[1:30:46] lifting of my hands be as the evening
[1:30:49] sacrifice." And I tell you what, church,
[1:30:52] we got an altar tonight. Amen. And we
[1:30:54] got an incense tonight that's rising up
[1:30:57] off that altar. You want to know what it
[1:30:59] is? It's the praise that is coming from
[1:31:01] the lips of God's believing children.
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. David said, "Let the lifting
[1:31:06] of my hands be like the evening
[1:31:08] sacrifice." Brother, you get a
[1:31:10] revelation of that. All the devils in
[1:31:12] hell wouldn't be able to keep your hands
[1:31:15] down. You say, "Well, I'm tired." I tell
[1:31:19] you what, make a sacrifice. I tell you
[1:31:21] what the prophet said. He said, "You
[1:31:23] say, "Well, I'd worship God if I felt
[1:31:25] like it." He said, "Do it
[1:31:32] anyhow." Glory to God. I might as well
[1:31:34] preach right here. Listen, friends. When
[1:31:36] they was under Moses and they were
[1:31:39] following Moses and they come down to
[1:31:40] the Red Sea, Amen. They had to wait
[1:31:43] until they saw their enemies dead,
[1:31:46] floating in the in the in the sea before
[1:31:48] they started worshiping God.
[1:31:51] Brother, when God killed their enemies
[1:31:53] and they looked and they saw all their
[1:31:54] enemies dead, they picked up tambourines
[1:31:56] and they danced up and down the
[1:31:58] seashores and Moses was singing in the
[1:32:00] spirit. And that's a wonderful thing.
[1:32:04] But brother, when they got under the
[1:32:06] ministry of Joshua
[1:32:09] and they started following that word,
[1:32:12] they didn't have to wait to see the
[1:32:13] enemy dead to praise God.
[1:32:16] They
[1:32:17] shouted while the walls were still
[1:32:22] standing. Glory to God. Listen, church,
[1:32:25] what ministry are you under? I tell you
[1:32:27] what, I ain't in the wilderness. I'm
[1:32:30] following Joshua. I'm following the
[1:32:33] word. Amen. There's something in my
[1:32:35] heart. If the walls are still standing,
[1:32:38] I'm going to shout
[1:32:39] anyhow. If I'm still sick, I'm going to
[1:32:42] shout anyhow. If the trouble's still
[1:32:45] there, I'm going to shout
[1:32:47] anyhow. I might not feel like it, but
[1:32:50] I'm going to shout anyhow.
[1:32:54] And while they were shouting, the walls
[1:32:56] came down.
[1:32:58] I'll tell you what, church. You start
[1:33:00] making a sacrifice of praise and you
[1:33:02] come to church when you don't feel like
[1:33:03] it. And you'll leave better than you
[1:33:06] came.
[1:33:08] Hallelujah. And you start praising God
[1:33:11] when you don't feel like it. and you'll
[1:33:14] feel better.
[1:33:16] Glory to God. Next thing you know, you
[1:33:19] start feeling better.
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:25] Tell you what, church,
[1:33:27] we ought to give him the sacrifice of
[1:33:29] our lips. That's right.
[1:33:32] You love God. Amen. Tell him.
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:39] Tell him I love you. Listen friends, you
[1:33:41] ain't got to do You ain't got to be like
[1:33:43] me. Let me make something really clear
[1:33:46] tonight. You ain't got to worship like
[1:33:48] me. You ain't got to worship like
[1:33:50] brother Wayne. You ain't got to worship
[1:33:52] like brother Jonathan. You do not have
[1:33:54] to run. You do not have to jump. You do
[1:33:57] not have to shout. You ain't got to do
[1:33:59] none of them things. Just whoever you
[1:34:01] are, however you do
[1:34:04] it. Maybe you just sit there and lift
[1:34:06] your hands and cry a little while. Amen.
[1:34:09] Maybe you just say an amen that nobody
[1:34:12] hears. But I tell you this. Amen. You
[1:34:15] are
[1:34:17] obligated because David said it this
[1:34:19] way. Give him the praise that is due
[1:34:23] unto his
[1:34:26] name. Church. It is a debt we
[1:34:31] owe. You ain't giving something to God
[1:34:34] that don't belong to him. You're giving
[1:34:36] something to God that he owns. It
[1:34:39] belongs to him. I tell you what,
[1:34:41] brother. All my life, all my strength,
[1:34:44] all that I am, I give unto him. It is
[1:34:47] due unto his name.
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:00] These are the sacrifices
[1:35:03] that God is well pleased. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:07] God, I tell you what, friends, and it
[1:35:08] don't stop there.
[1:35:11] Let me just say this because before I
[1:35:13] move on and I ain't going to be just a
[1:35:15] couple more minutes, but but
[1:35:17] listen, you giving God a, you know, come
[1:35:22] to him with words, right?
[1:35:27] I'll just say this. You're in a
[1:35:28] relationship, right? Right. He's a old
[1:35:31] brother back
[1:35:33] home. Brother Ray, you probably knew.
[1:35:35] You knew Brother Dan Daisy. And he
[1:35:38] always said something. It was real kind
[1:35:40] of comical, but he said he always said
[1:35:43] this. He said, "I told my wife when I
[1:35:46] married her that I loved
[1:35:48] her, and if anything ever changed, I'd
[1:35:51] let her know."
[1:35:56] That's kind of comical, but you know,
[1:35:57] really, that don't work too good.
[1:36:03] If you love your wife, you ought to tell
[1:36:04] her.
[1:36:07] If you love your husband, you ought to
[1:36:09] tell him. You appreciate him, you ought
[1:36:11] to tell him.
[1:36:14] If you love God, you ought to tell him.
[1:36:17] That's right. Cuz I tell you one thing,
[1:36:20] he's worthy.
[1:36:21] Yes, he is.
[1:36:24] Give him the fruit of your lips.
[1:36:27] A sacrifice of praise. Yes. Amen. And
[1:36:30] forget not to do good. Right. And
[1:36:35] communicate. Oh, mercy. Come on,
[1:36:37] brother. Cuz I want to tell you the
[1:36:38] responsibility of our praise unto God
[1:36:40] don't stop with us just lifting our
[1:36:43] hands and saying hallelujah in church.
[1:36:46] True. There's something that accompanies
[1:36:47] the praise that we have and it's called
[1:36:48] a life. That's right. And I believe what
[1:36:52] Paul is actually saying in that
[1:36:53] scripture there is he said as you're
[1:36:55] praising and worshiping God, don't get
[1:36:56] so caught up in all that that you forget
[1:36:58] to actually be a Christian
[1:37:01] [Applause]
[1:37:02] and do good to people. And I tell you
[1:37:05] what, friends, I I tell you what, I
[1:37:06] believe that pleases God. Amen. Maybe
[1:37:09] even more than looking down. And I tell
[1:37:10] you, church, I want to make this as
[1:37:12] clear as I can make it. And these
[1:37:13] brothers that know me, they know I love
[1:37:15] shouting and running and dancing and all
[1:37:17] that kind of stuff. I absolutely love
[1:37:19] it. I like the anointing to be moving in
[1:37:22] a church and I love people to Amen. I
[1:37:25] love people to find their liberty and
[1:37:27] and praise God. But I believe that when
[1:37:29] God looks down and he sees a person that
[1:37:33] forgives from their heart like he
[1:37:37] forgave.
[1:37:38] I believe that God says, "I'm well
[1:37:40] pleased with that sacrifice." I believe
[1:37:44] that when God looks down and sees
[1:37:45] somebody that loves like he loves, he
[1:37:49] says, "I'm well pleased with that
[1:37:51] sacrifice, when God looks down, come on
[1:37:53] church, when God looks at our sisters
[1:37:55] with their long hair," Amen. They're
[1:37:57] worshiping God in the beauty of holiness
[1:38:00] and their long dresses clothed in modest
[1:38:02] apparel. He looks at our young men,
[1:38:05] amen, with a clean haircut, actually
[1:38:07] look like men, dress like men. I believe
[1:38:10] God says, "I'm well pleased with that
[1:38:12] sacrifice."
[1:38:14] Brother, our worship goes far beyond a
[1:38:17] hallelujah on Sunday or an amen on a
[1:38:21] Thursday or a dance at a youth camp. Our
[1:38:24] worship is a living
[1:38:27] sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.
[1:38:33] Let your life accompany to your praise.
[1:38:38] Amen.
[1:38:41] That's why a prophet would come along
[1:38:42] and say, "Don't don't jump no higher
[1:38:43] than you live."
[1:38:46] A lot of preachers just use that quote
[1:38:47] to keep everybody from jumping. I don't
[1:38:50] use it that way.
[1:38:53] Come on, church. I don't use it that
[1:38:54] way. I do not preach that quote to kind
[1:38:57] to try to qu uh make people in my church
[1:38:59] quit jumping or quit worshiping or
[1:39:02] praising God. I use it to say, listen,
[1:39:04] jump all you want. Just make sure you
[1:39:07] live as high as you jump. And if you
[1:39:10] can't jump very high, start living high
[1:39:13] so you can jump high.
[1:39:17] Glory to God. Because I tell you, the
[1:39:19] thing that will stop praise in the house
[1:39:22] of God is condemnation.
[1:39:26] But brother, if you get a a group of
[1:39:28] people that are bloodbought, Holy Ghost
[1:39:31] filled, sanctified by the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:34] and they know I know what I was and I
[1:39:38] know what I
[1:39:39] am, brother. You can't stop a church
[1:39:43] like that from praising God.
[1:39:49] You cannot stop young people from
[1:39:52] praising God, but they know I was bound,
[1:39:56] but now I'm
[1:39:58] free. I was lost, but now I'm
[1:40:03] found. Glory to God. Brother, if you
[1:40:07] don't understand what this is all about,
[1:40:09] you just ain't never experienced it. You
[1:40:11] don't know what God done for me. You
[1:40:14] don't know where I come from.
[1:40:16] Amen.
[1:40:20] Hallelujah. Church, I want to tell you,
[1:40:23] Amen. What I'm I'm worshiping from a
[1:40:25] heart. I'm worshiping from a life, a
[1:40:28] broken family, a broken home, an
[1:40:31] alcoholic father. Amen. I'm talking
[1:40:33] about I come through church splits and
[1:40:35] every trouble you can think about and
[1:40:37] everything you could dream up around
[1:40:39] this message, I've seen it.
[1:40:42] But the grace of God
[1:40:47] Hallelujah. The grace of God, I
[1:40:51] shouldn't be here tonight, but the grace
[1:40:53] of God has kept
[1:40:56] me. Thank you,
[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:03] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Let me just tell
[1:41:06] you this tonight in closing as a
[1:41:07] musicians we
[1:41:08] come. I think about a man I think
[1:41:13] about it was at Simon's house one time.
[1:41:17] Yes, sir.
[1:41:20] And they invited Jesus to come.
[1:41:24] Yeah.
[1:41:26] Like we did here tonight.
[1:41:30] And as he
[1:41:33] came, there was nobody
[1:41:36] there to wash his feet or anoint him.
[1:41:40] You know the story. Well, there's a
[1:41:42] little woman.
[1:41:44] Yes, sir. Brother Nathan, she walked by
[1:41:46] there and she saw Jesus sitting in the
[1:41:48] corner and with dirty
[1:41:50] feet and there was something in her
[1:41:53] heart. She said, "I cannot leave him.
[1:41:57] in that condition.
[1:42:00] I tell you friends, you think about mind
[1:42:02] battles. I tell you what, that girl
[1:42:03] fought through some mind battles.
[1:42:07] Don't you know she thought, brother
[1:42:08] Zachary, don't you know she thought,
[1:42:10] "Well, I just ain't worthy. I I ain't
[1:42:13] worthy. I I got news for you, church.
[1:42:15] Neither are you. And I ain't either.
[1:42:19] But I ain't worshiping God cuz I'm
[1:42:20] worthy.
[1:42:22] Ain't got nothing to do with my
[1:42:24] worthiness. It's got everything to do
[1:42:25] with his worthiness.
[1:42:28] I ain't worthy. You ain't worthy, but he
[1:42:30] is worthy.
[1:42:31] [Applause]
[1:42:33] She had to fight through all that.
[1:42:36] She said, "I can't leave him like that."
[1:42:38] She went and she took everything she
[1:42:40] had.
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:45] Listen, friends, the cost was great.
[1:42:48] Yes.
[1:42:51] And she knew how she got it.
[1:42:56] She took it on. She went down there. And
[1:42:59] you know I what I'm amazed by this is
[1:43:02] when brother Ray when she went down
[1:43:04] there to the to the store, she was
[1:43:07] getting ready to buy the
[1:43:10] ointment. She said she just took
[1:43:12] everything she had. She said, "I want
[1:43:14] the best that this can buy.
[1:43:20] Oh, come on.
[1:43:23] Listen, you know, it might be different
[1:43:24] for for you than it is for me. Might be
[1:43:28] different,
[1:43:29] but I just want the best that I can
[1:43:32] give.
[1:43:35] Maybe you can give better and that's
[1:43:36] wonderful and you ought to give him
[1:43:38] whatever you can give.
[1:43:41] But I want to give him the best I can
[1:43:42] give.
[1:43:44] She just laid it out there and said, "I
[1:43:46] want the be. I want everything this can
[1:43:48] buy." That went the end of it. She paid
[1:43:52] a greater price than
[1:43:54] that. She had to walk in there.
[1:43:58] It cost her pride.
[1:44:02] She had to walk right by all them
[1:44:04] critics and scoffers and and they all
[1:44:07] looking down on her and and rightfully
[1:44:11] so. You know what I'm saying? I mean,
[1:44:14] there was a reason why they looked at
[1:44:16] her that way.
[1:44:18] She had to lay all that aside and walk
[1:44:20] right up through there and come right to
[1:44:22] the feet of Jesus.
[1:44:25] You know what she did? She took the very
[1:44:28] best thing she could afford and all that
[1:44:31] she
[1:44:33] had. And brother Jonathan, she didn't
[1:44:36] just take a little
[1:44:38] bit, pour a little bit, and
[1:44:40] think, "This cost me so much. I probably
[1:44:43] ought to save
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] it." He's all I got after all. Maybe I,
[1:44:49] you know, I may need to keep a little
[1:44:52] bit for Sunday.
[1:44:56] Okay, listen. Listen, friends. This may
[1:44:58] be the last opportunity you ever have.
[1:45:01] That's right.
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] And you ought to come every time when
[1:45:06] you come to God, you ought to empty
[1:45:09] everything.
[1:45:12] Don't go don't go trying to save things
[1:45:14] for camp meeting and Well, I'm going to
[1:45:17] say that. Well, next time my favorite
[1:45:19] preacher preaches out, you know, I'll
[1:45:21] just keep a little bit. Or, you know, I
[1:45:23] better wait till Sunday or I better wait
[1:45:25] to know. Friends, I tell you, every time
[1:45:27] you come, you ought to just take it all
[1:45:29] and everything you got, just pour it
[1:45:34] out. I tell you what I love about that
[1:45:36] story is a prophet of God said something
[1:45:38] along these lines. He said, and he's
[1:45:41] talking to a bunch of religious people.
[1:45:43] He said, "And if you won't worship God,
[1:45:46] He said, "God will bring somebody in
[1:45:48] like that."
[1:45:52] Listen, friends, I tell you what, if we
[1:45:54] don't worship God, if we hold our peace,
[1:45:56] the rocks would cry out.
[1:45:59] And if we get so pious around this
[1:46:01] message until we forget what God done
[1:46:03] for us, God will bring in drunkards and
[1:46:05] alcoholics and prostitutes off the
[1:46:08] street that'll know, Amen. the the power
[1:46:11] that he has to save. Hallelujah. I tell
[1:46:15] you, I believe sometimes there's many
[1:46:16] the one of the greatest things that
[1:46:19] that's hindered the church of the living
[1:46:20] God is they forgot.
[1:46:23] They
[1:46:24] forgot where they come from. And they
[1:46:27] forgot, amen, what God done for them.
[1:46:30] But I want to tell you friends, it's
[1:46:32] time for us to remember. And I love what
[1:46:34] the prophet of God said about the
[1:46:35] Ephesian church. He said they had to
[1:46:37] return in their mind and then in
[1:46:40] reality. And I believe it's time for us
[1:46:42] as a church of the living God to
[1:46:44] remember we was lost when he found us.
[1:46:48] Amen. We were sinners. Amen. When he
[1:46:50] picked us up. Hallelujah. We were
[1:46:53] nothing. Amen. But Christ, Amen. saved
[1:46:57] us. That's right. Thank you, Lord. And
[1:47:00] he suffered without the gate. Thank you,
[1:47:04] Jesus. Let us now go for unto him
[1:47:07] without the camp, bearing his reproach,
[1:47:10] giving praise unto his name. Let's stand
[1:47:13] our feet tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:35] Hallelujah. With such sacrifices, God is
[1:47:38] well
[1:47:39] pleased. Oh, I feel a praise rising up
[1:47:43] out of the hearts of believing
[1:47:44] Christians
[1:47:46] tonight. For it's just more than noise.
[1:47:49] It's more than
[1:47:50] emotion. It's a
[1:47:53] sacrifice lay on the altar. A sacrifice
[1:47:56] of praise, the fruit of our
[1:47:59] lips. And I say he's worthy tonight.
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:04] He's worthy. Thank you, Lord,
[1:48:08] Hallelujah.
[1:48:11] Hallelujah. Let's sing it. Oh, how I
[1:48:13] love Jesus.
[1:48:15] Amen. Let's just sing it to him tonight.
[1:48:20] [Music]

[1:52:49] for his mercy, for his
[1:52:52] grace. Amen. What a what a powerful
[1:52:56] word. Amen. You know, you pray about
[1:52:59] things and ask God to do things and then
[1:53:02] and then you see why. Amen. We
[1:53:05] certainly highly appreciate the labor of
[1:53:07] our brother tonight to come so far.
[1:53:10] Amen. To uh to come and and to deliver
[1:53:13] the word of life and and give his mercy
[1:53:15] and Amen. uh and and to put his labor
[1:53:18] here with us. And Amen. I I personally
[1:53:21] received a a real blessing. Amen. The
[1:53:24] word that was spoken, what a what a
[1:53:25] tremendous word that was given to our
[1:53:28] heart. Amen. And we're so honored. Amen.
[1:53:31] Um you know, there's a there's a little
[1:53:33] song we sing around here sometimes. And

[1:53:59] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hey, we used to
[1:54:03] sing that. You sing that song once in a
[1:54:05] while. I think I'll just throw up my
[1:54:06] hands and start praising the Lord. When
[1:54:09] he said that that the lifting of hands
[1:54:11] is as the evening sacrifice, I thought,
[1:54:14] Lord, I don't know how to bring an
[1:54:16] evening sacrifice, but I know how to
[1:54:18] throw up my hands. That's right. I know
[1:54:20] how to do it. And I know how to do it on
[1:54:22] rainy days. And I know how to do it on
[1:54:24] troubled days. And I can't do a lot, but
[1:54:27] I can lift my hands. And I when he was
[1:54:30] saying that, I said I said, "Lord, I
[1:54:33] just like to lift my hands. I just like
[1:54:35] you to know that I love you." Amen. In
[1:54:38] every which time. Amen.
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:46] When everything has gone
[1:54:50] wrong, I have my back to the
[1:54:55] wall. Satan's coming
[1:55:00] strong. He really wants me to fall.
[1:55:06] He say
[1:55:36] Oh, I won't give up cuz I
[1:56:06] I just my
[1:56:13] head
[1:56:19] crazy.
[1:56:22] Heat.
[1:56:32] Heat. Yeah. Heat.
[1:56:50] I
[1:56:53] try. There's only two ways I can
[1:56:59] go. Heat.
[1:57:09] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:57:25] Heat. Heat.
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:38] I
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:57:59] start my way
[1:58:07] I know what
[1:58:11] I
[1:58:15] got. There's no way I can go.
[1:58:22] I can still Heat.
[1:58:36] Heat. Heat.
[1:58:47] Heat.
[1:58:52] Heat.
[1:59:02] Heat.
[1:59:07] Yeah. Heat.
[1:59:26] Satan
[1:59:34] just
[1:59:37] hallelujah. Well, glory to God. Somebody
[1:59:40] love him tonight.
[1:59:43] Hallelujah.
[1:59:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I
[1:59:49] believe we've heard a word from the Lord
[1:59:51] tonight. Yes, sir. I certainly accept it
[1:59:53] as a word from Almighty God. If you're
[1:59:56] under a strong trial or a situation in
[1:59:59] your life, you heard a word tonight
[2:00:00] that'll bring you out of it. That's
[2:00:02] right. That's right. Young lady told me
[2:00:05] the other night, she said, "Brother
[2:00:06] Wayne, during those meetings and Amen,
[2:00:08] on that Saturday night, what a powerful
[2:00:11] meeting." How many enjoyed that annual
[2:00:12] meeting we done with the home folk here?
[2:00:14] And what a powerful meeting. And that
[2:00:17] Saturday night, Brother Ronnie just
[2:00:18] knocked it out of the park. God just
[2:00:20] used him so powerfully. And there was
[2:00:22] such a victory and a liberty in the in
[2:00:24] the church. And one of the young ladies
[2:00:26] came to me after the service. She said,
[2:00:27] "Well, you young, she's married and and
[2:00:30] moving on." And she said, "But Brother
[2:00:32] Wayne," she said, "I got out there." And
[2:00:34] she said, "I got to rejoicing in the
[2:00:35] spirit." And she said, "At some point, I
[2:00:37] started dancing." And she said, "Some
[2:00:39] people may wonder why I danced." She
[2:00:41] said, "But every demon that had
[2:00:43] tormented me that week was under my
[2:00:46] feet, and I was dancing on the head of
[2:00:47] the devil." And you know,
[2:00:51] sometimes you just need to remind the
[2:00:54] devil that if he's speaking to you in
[2:00:57] your ear, he's out of place. Cuz he
[2:01:00] don't belong on your shoulder. He
[2:01:01] belongs under your feet. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:05] Amen.
[2:01:09] Well, I've lost some good
[2:01:13] friends along life's
[2:01:17] way. Some loved ones
[2:01:21] departed in heaven to
[2:01:25] stay. But thank God I didn't lose
[2:01:30] everything.
[2:01:36] I lost faith in
[2:01:39] me who said they
[2:01:43] care. In the times of my
[2:01:48] crisis, they were never there.
[2:01:53] But in my
[2:01:56] disappointments and in my
[2:01:59] season of
[2:02:01] pain, you see one thing never
[2:02:05] weren't and one thing never
