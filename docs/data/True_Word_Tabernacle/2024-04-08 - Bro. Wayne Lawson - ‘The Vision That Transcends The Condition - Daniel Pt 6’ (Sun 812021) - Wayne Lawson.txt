of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and amen if you have your Bibles this morning we want to go into the word of the Lord amen we want to uh just take a few minutes in the scripture in the Book of Daniel again um I was going to be just continuing on through but I I'm not sure um how we're going to continue forward but just uh this morning it just I I just not able to leave this portion of the Scripture it just keeps speaking to me so I want to uh move back into Daniel chapter 3 uh the 14th verse down to the 18th verse we read the entire chapter uh on Thursday night so amen if you didn't get nothing out of church you got a whole chapter of the Bible to take home with you amen it's it's always a blessing amen and Daniel chapter 3 and verse 14 to verse 18 now Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and abedo do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet and the flute and the heart and the sack putut and the Sury and the dlim and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands my what a question who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands well for sure it wasn't the one he made amen this was a this was a God he didn't understand Shadrach Meshach and abedo and I just love this verse answered and said to the king old Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from this Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up God bless the reading of his words you could be seated this evening amen I I I want to speak to you a little bit further from this Daniel the third chapter and if I'm going to maybe uh uh speak to you a little bit from here I want to talk to you about the vision that transcends the condition and when I'm looking at this uh scripture here I guess uh it would be U it would be one of those situations where I believe that any of us could stand at the gates of a furnace this morning and we could put a number of situations uh instead of the Gate of a fiery furnace I I'm assuming there's a trial of every kind facing individuals this morning being uh that this this season that we are living in is a great type in that the scripture says uh that that Nebuchadnezzar heeded that furnace seven times hotter than any other time of course we know it's a reflection of the leysan age when if you look in the scripture the Bible talks about the enemy coming uh throughout the scriptures talks about the attack of the enemy but there is an actual compiling of spirits in the last age where as a prophet would say it like this he said where all the guns of hell has been trained upon the bride and and uh and there there's a pressure and I I don't have to preach to you on pressure because every one of you sitting here this morning understand the pressures of the ages that we we're that we're living in and the time and how that even the season that we live reflects this entire picture Amen in that everything around you is constantly working on your resolve to serve the Lord every situation seems like now and I I was just thinking about this after service the other day and I I think it's pretty amazing to me that when has there ever been in the age that we uh know in the world around that music has been played worldwide completely all the time in the malls and in the cars and in the homes and in the I I was in uh in India one time got an elevator and they were playing music from America and I looked over somebody I said you mean they pop the sewer from the states over here to India too you know uh this this this rock and roll stuff was playing on the on the elevator and I was thinking isn't it something the whole world is moving in the atmosphere they're moving under what the what the devil has set up an image for the whole world to worship and he's got his music and he got his advertisement he's got his entertainment everything is to break down the resolve of the Church of the Living God and and I found that it's a very powerful thing that as we are living in this season of time that God would choose you as an individual to place you in this time and and I I have to uh maybe reflect to think about how that God is a god of knowledge and I don't know of one mistake that he's ever made I I happen to be the one that believes that we serve a God who is omnipotent and he is infinite and he exactly knows and makes every decision with perfection and he don't have any better ideas than the ideas that he already has in other words I don't think God accidentally put you in this position or this place I think it's I think it's amazing to me if you could hear the discussion of God and Satan concerning you I think it would be a whole like like it was in the days of job when God and job were discussing job or God and Satan was discussing job and job had no idea what was being discussed but his integrity was what being discussed and God was saying this man is a man who walks before me with perfection and and I could either hold a a fence up or I can take take it down the man will not change and of course that was discussion of whether job would break down under pressure and God assured him this man right here will not break down under pressure and what kind of confidence did God have in an individual Amen to be able to say that and I I think of job's questions and how he asked of the Lord but in job the 38th chapter it tells us amen that God finally got tired of all the counselors talking to job so he literally come down and talked to himself said job gge yourself like a man we're going to talk about some things we're going to talk about the reason that you're going through the situations you are and they have nothing to do with whether you're sinning or not sinning it has everything to do with me and the devil has been discussing your integrity and I have put my entire reputation on you and the devil is said if I would just let you at him that he would break you down amen and you know what we found out we found out that God could put confidence in job because it wasn't job he was putting confidence in it was that job was the Seed of Abraham amen and God knew exactly the kind of seed he was now I happen to believe that God knows the type of you person you are and and that God would make a prediction concerning you before you ever got here amen that he would take a people out for his name's sake in the book of Acts these Gentile Church would become a bride a spotless bride and the prophet tells us that God chooses the age amen of Satan's eeden to call that bride now he did that for the purpose and the prophet tells us that he would be able to prove the bride in this generation now to some of us these things feel like a test but God's not testing you he's proving you amen and and and and to think amen that God would be uh uh be looking at you if you would you think well God's testing me well God's not really testing you he's proving you because he already knows the outcome amen it would only be a test if he didn't know what was going to happen but he already knows how you're going to respond so he's not testing he's proving that there is a seed that exists that will resist Satan in every Department in every area in other words there is something somewhere that will not be broke down under leot de see impression I happen to believe amen that there's a part of that bride setting right here this morning amen that has put up a resistance in the end time amen and and as I think about this I I look at these boys who are standing here in the face of this fiery furnace amen and they got a devil uh uh standing here in Nebuchadnezzar telling them if they won't bow they'll be thrown in the furnace and I and I thought about amen of what what would be running through the mind of an individual who is looking in the face of total Destruction how would the uh how would the spirit become uh unsettled or uncertain the future or how how things would begin to question of how is this going to go forward from this point amen but I I think of how amen that your current condition will only reflect what you believe the future conditions are going to be uh when you certainly know exactly what's about to happen amen it seems like people are a whole lot more settled in what is happening Amen in other words uh man can only predict his future by his past the the man can study the the current histories of of of the world and see what happened and and we thank God for memory we thank God for history amen otherwise some things would repeat but because we know history and we know what's going to happen then we can kind of guess what we think things are going to be and we decide now things of our future from the things that were past in the human realm but the beauty of God is God doesn't have to judge things from the history to try to understand what the future is going to be but God knows the future beforehand so amen if you if you would know the history of something if you know the history of an animal the history of some situation amen how helpful it would be to judge what's going to be because of the history you know about something you say well I know that individual I predict it'll be like this or I know that church I predict it'll be like this and how useful history is to predict the future amen but if history is useful in predicting the future how much greater is a vision of the future amen able to help you predict not only the future but to determine what to to do today based upon your vision of the future amen and I I say this because I believe that we're living in a leyan age but I do believe there's bride in this age that has been lifted above the conditions of this age amen by a vision of God and what he has for the church in this hour according to the Bible in Revelation chapter 3 it said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne in other words that you've been invited into Dominion amen as an overcomer now Jesus himself overcame now he overcame the cross he overcame the cross which was a terrible thing to face it was a a terrible situation but the devil offered him the same thing on the mountain in Temptation that these boys are being offered if you'll just Bow Down and Worship me I'll give you the kingdoms of the world but Jesus did not receive the kingdoms but rather he would accept the cross and he would die amen because he knew he had to pay the price now the Bible will tell us this that Jesus overcame and sat down with the father in his throne now in Hebrews chapter 12 and the second verse tells us exactly how Jesus overcame looking unto Jesus and the author the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross did despising the shame and to sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen look at what this we're looking to Jesus this morning amen of how he overcame if we would look to him he did it by the joy that was set before him he endured the cross knowing the joy that the cross was going to bring amen I think of that this morning that we are actually compelled to look to Jesus who is both the author and the finisher of our faith he is the beginning of our faith and he is the finish of our faith and if we could look to him this morning I believe that we could get a vision of Christ amen that would transcend any condition that you're facing this morning knowing that he is able and that God is already Chosen and that God has already made up his mind concerning the church and and I'll say this God knows something about you Jacob that you do not know about yourself he knows things concerning your ability to overcome you do not know about yourself and you'll only know them as God allows you to face a trial and then when you go through a test you find out I am able to do this then the next time that same trial will not have the same power as the other one did because you're able to know now this is the thing that they were able to do these boys were able to look into the fire and they was able to see the other side they were able to see see the other side now uh in Abraham's Covenant confirmed brother bam teaches us a powerful thing of how to get past this situation I don't know I just felt certain specifically led to something this morning I don't know who and what and how what's facing but I I specifically feel this morning Amen to talk about a situation amen that we face in our lives but but but things that become furnaces become mountains become amen uh uh uh situations where we're wondering amen how will we make it through this area now I I'll say it to you like this in Abraham's Covenant brother bam teaches us that uh uh that there was a a big competition going on in the bicycle world and they were going to put a prize of a swim bicycle and and somebody was going to ride that bicycle amen and they put up a 6-inch Plank and said anybody that can ride this plank across this area and not fall off amen the the the winter will get this swim bicycle and that was a lot of people uh uh come up and a prophet said there was a lot of good riters he said there was men who were were professional bike riders great bike riders they they all come and they wanted to enter the contest amen and they're they're riding this little 6inch Plank and they're going out across there and they just got to stay on if that's all they have to do is just stay on it because if you stay on this it'll come out where you're supposed to and and and according to the story there wasn't any of the boys able to do it but there was actually one boy who was a little boy who wasn't a very good bike rider but he wanted that swin bicycle so so he he was able to complete uh uh the contest to be able to win the bicycle and later uh some of the more professional guys begin to ask him said well what was the secret behind you being able to do what we couldn't do how how could you do this and and and of course the boy began to say well the problem is you were all trying to keep the bicycle on the board by looking right down at your bicycle he said but I it made you nervous and you got to wiggling and you fell off he said I se where you made your mistake he said so I never did look down to what was here I just watched the end and kept it steady and that's what it is if we will watch the end and keep it steady and just keep moving on do you see it I'd be discouraged tonight if it wasn't for that for watching the end see just keeping it steady move on no matter what takes place keep going don't look at that just keep looking at the End Amen now I I know that that's a very simple lesson but we can't forget that a prophet taught us how to ride through the middle of the situations of our life that looks like that other people were not able to get through the same kind of areas but you are getting through it and you may not feel like you are capable to do so but there is a secret to what we're doing is we're looking to the end and not look looking at the current situation yes it's there for everybody but there are some people who refuse to look at the situation but rather they're looking to the end and they're holding their eye and it's keeping them steady I think of the great world leaders that have done the same thing when they begin to announce Victory before the end of a war when they begin to say we're coming out of this we're going to take place that's in a natural realm but how much more the Church of the Living God this morning are we able to announce that there's a church that's going in a Rapture how much more can I announce this morning that there is a victory in the Church of the Living God by the power and by the blessing of the Holy Ghost and the situations that we Face amen they're actually not as as dangerous as you think they are only if you go to looking at them looking at the Unseen brother R will say it this he said if a man would ever catch the vision of an invisible God and know that he's always present there's something that'll stabilize that man's thinking it'll stabilize his actions now you want to know how to remain stable in turbulent times you want to know how to remain stable in Troublesome times to to keep your nerve when it's a nervous age amen a prophet is teaching us a lesson it'll be done from the invisible world Amen everything of stability only will be gotten from an invisible world when there is no no hope you can have hope but where you going to get hope you're not going to get it in this world Amen but you can have hope if you look at the word of God and believe what the word says it'll give you a vision of tomorrow that the enemy cannot destroy because you have put him out of your vision amen see a man catches that vision of the invisible God and knows that he's always present amen do you believe that this morning do you believe he's always present do you believe God is always present in every every situation do you know God is present right here in this building right now amen Jesus said where two or three of you are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them so it wasn't really matter the condition it would matter the promise that God said I will be in the midst amen I I think of God this morning that he would be right here really then doesn't matter what I see or what I think or what I feel amen it matters what I believe and what I believe is that the resurrected Jesus Christ is in the midst of the church this morning and if he is here then every demon has been conquered and if he is here there is no weapon that is formed that will be able to prosper against the church if he is here amen and he stands here this morning and if we can catch an Invision of an invisible God and know that he's present now there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes es his actions in a time of distress and trouble it'll make him look upward and above things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen but it's by promise see he's looking at the Unseen but by promise now I know the Bible said that Moses endured or overcome Egypt he did it by looking at the Unseen and now it's one thing to look at the Unseen it's another thing to see the unseen so it's not just that we must look at the Unseen we must see the Unseen and you said well how do we see the Unseen well if you want to have a an oak tree and I come to you and say and you you say to me brother r i want an oak tree and I give you an ACR you're going to see the Unseen the acrn is the seed of what you're hoping to see it's seeing the AC the Acron is the visible portion of an oak tree that's going to be in the future amen because that seed possesses everything it takes to make an oak tree so if you say I need healing in my body and I give you Isaiah 53 that is a seed to your healing amen and when you see Isaiah 53 it's the healing that you're looking for if you know that there's healing in the word of God now when you take this and you know the Unseen you see it by promise amen now you see this is how Abraham overcome now people say said well brother Wayne I want a vision and we think of Visions is only a supernatural like you're looking into another dimension or maybe that you're seeing a television screen somehow and you're viewing the future amen but according to the Bible in the days of Samuel the Bible said that the precious was the word of the Lord because there had been no open Vision in the days that had led up to Samuel being there but when Samuel came and heard a direct Revelation from God it became the vision of Israel now the church we know that the the Bible teaches us that a people without a vision is going to perish is that right without a vision we will perish now according to Malachi chapter 4 the Bible said unless Elijah would come the whole world would be Smitten by a curse everything will perish unless Elijah would come because he's going to bring a vision to the world in that generation not not that every person is going to see a supernatural screen that let you look into the future of time but rather a direct Revelation or a word from God Amen if you know you're hearing directly from God that becomes a vision to the church amen the first thing we have to do is realize we're not looking for a vision we have received a vision we're not praying for a vision we have received a vision we don't need to fast and pray to figure out what our future's going to be we have a Vindicated Prophet who has already given a vision to the church the only thing is is what are we going to do with the vision that he gave us amen are we going to question that Vision are we going to wonder what that Vision means or are we going to take the vision of God and Destroy every Spirit of nervousness and anxiety and every situation that's in our life look you got in your hands this morning young people a vision from God that get the the children of Hebrews through a fiery furnace it took Abraham through 25 years waiting on a baby and it'll take you through the situation you're facing this morning whether it's a mountain in front of you whether it's a Red Sea in front of you whether it's a crisis that you're facing there is a vision this morning that will stabilize you it will stabilize you you get a vision of an invisible God it'll bring stability it'll bring stability to your decisions it's an unstable time friends but stability comes from the vision that transcends the condition I I found a quote the other day I thought it's powerful I don't know who the origin of the quote but it was still a good quote it said don't do something permanently stupid because you're temporarily upset and how many decisions have been made like that permanently well I didn't get to saying or I didn't get to do this or somebody said that or somebody and make a decision on your whole life make a decision based upon something that is so temporary amen somebody said this to me or somebody did that now I'm going to do this making a decision based off of some situation but your decisions must come back to the vision of God's vision for your life what does God have for your life now that vision is a direct word from the Lord my if anybody ever had a direct word from the Lord this bride is in possession of a direct word from the Lord I've had people say to me brother Wayne come here let me prophesy over you I said that's all right I've already been prophesied over let me prophesy something over your life God's already prophesied over me he's already called me the bride he's already said I'm in a raptured condition he's already told me that I'll walk through every situation that comes to my life I don't need some Pentecostal trying to shake up something to be able to prophesy over me I have a dream over my life God has already prophesied over the Church of the Living God it doesn't matter what is coming it doesn't matter what we're looking at there is a stable life that a Believer lives we are resting behind the wings of Elohim this morning we are not in the reach of Satan and his devices my when I think about this morning at the at the reality of Nebuchadnezzar thinking that he could destroy God's children now if you read the next chapter we're going to probably get there maybe maybe not amen but I'll tell you this he found out he's not as in control as he thinks he is Nebuchadnezzar thought he ruled the world but he only did what God let him do and God proved to him you're not the one in control I'm the one in control and what NE Nezar didn't know the Hebrew children already did know they already knew Nebuchadnezzar you're not in control my God is in control the god that I'm worshiping is Moses's God the God I'm worshiping is Abraham's God and I will not bow to the god you set up my that isn't that something I'm going to preach to you a minute amen but I I want you to think about this amen the enemy was already setting up their gods isn't it something when the Bible records amen that they took the AR of the Lord and took it down into the Philistines and set it before Deon y'all remember the story they set the Ark of the Lord before Deon and after the time of Samuel amen and the scriptures tells us amen when they did this the next morning the Philistines come out and found that their God was laying prostrate in front of the Ark of the Covenant and you know what they had to do they had to set their God back up amen and they set it up and come back the next morning and their God was laying prostrate in front of the Ark of the Covenant and they set the thing back up up next time they come back and the thing had be to break apart the arms fell off and the head fell off they put it all together and set it back up well I'll tell you I don't want to serve any God that I got to get up every morning and set it back up and and and fix it back up and I'll tell you one thing the God that I serve I have never set it up I have never fixed my God but he's picked me up a many a morning there many morning than when I got up and I didn't know what would do and I got come down and and set me back up and put me back together I'm not going to worship any God I got to set up you got to repair your God you get the wrong God that's the truth I think of the I've been around a lot of idolatry so I'm sorry I've been over in the foreign worlds amen do you do you see amen what's going on here is these boys are aware that they have received a direct word from God do not bow do not Bend they've already received that word they have received a word amen that the seed that they are of will possess every gate that's in front of them amen now Christ identified in every iteration brother Ram said listen I want you to know this many times we get nervous and begin to think well it ought to be this way it ought to make it out this way we don't have nothing to do into it just play our part that he leads us to play remember there is nothing out of cater the great omnipotent God knows exactly before the foundation of the world that we would set right here tonight can you realize and really believe that God the infinite God knew you'd be sitting in that cheat this morning God knew you'd be sitting right here today can you imagine that the devil might have fought you all the way but God knew that you would press through you'd be sitting right here in this seat he knew every individual that would be right here today amen and if God is able to get you to this place don't you believe that God is able to speak a word to you that he knew that would change the situation that's into your life amen listen I believe amen that it's a direct Revelation from God there is nothing out of cater listen I don't know what you're going through but it's not out of cater my God is in complete control he knows exactly what's about to take place nothing out of cater now I know if you don't uh understand English that could be an odd word but we all understand Kentucky English nothing out of cater in other words amen there's nothing out of control here amen whatever's happening there's nothing out of cater I I think of this I think of of the situations that we get our lives into but there's nothing out of cater if God is infinite he's Almighty and he's all powerful he's omnipresent he's omnificent see he know all things from the beginning he knowed there is nothing out of cater it just it's just that that we think that it is it's everything is running look back in his word and see what he's doing and then you'll understand things that are to be he said your birth was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows your birth was pre-planned do you know that you're being here originated not just a myth or thought but everything was pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here can you imagine that you would be here in this season in this time you would be facing this test amen knowing that God already knew the outcome before you ever faced it God knows how this is going to end God knows the situation that you're going to face I think this morning that if we could just let this we know the word of God where we are living the hour we're living in we know what lays ahead look by the word we know the word of God we we know where we are living we know the hour we're living in and we know what lays ahead isn't that something we know what lays ahead you say preacher how in the world could we know what lays ahead because we know it by the word of God do you know God's already in your future do you know God's already out in your future amen I I love to take the the story of of of Congressman Upshaw who was in one brother Bam's meetings he was a congressman been there been been been crippled for years and years just listened to his testimony the other day it's actually on tape in one of brother Bam's meetings he gets up and and testifies about how God healed him amen I think 60 something years he was he was crippled amen he was sitting in a meeting and brother B begins to discern and he goes back how many times you ever hear Brother Bram say now it's not me that knows your past it's not me that knows your name amen he begins to tell you it's not me I don't know these things but then he looks at at this congressman and says to him now when you were a little boy I see you falling off of a hay wagon and I see you getting crippled up and you're laying on a bed and they're drilling holes in the floor because of the vibrations hurting your back I see you I see you crippled I see you in front of a of a great uh a great place you're you're in a great capital in the United States of America and he starts saying things like that now what's he doing he's letting Congressman up shall know whoever's talking knows where he come from he knows the the hurt he knows the problem in the life God is not doing this by not knowing he knows and he's letting Congressman upsh know I know what you've been through but then he turns and the congressman speaks up in the middle of the Mee and says says something and interrupts brother bradam so that he realizes that he's telling the man presently what's been going on but then he changes the vision and says but Congressman do you have a brown suit and the man says yes I have a brown suit he says I see you I'll meet you walking on the street wearing that suit that's thus sayith the Lord amen look what it was God was already in the future of that Congressman he knew what was he knew what is and he knew what was going to be let me tell you this morning you may think amen that God does not understand or know what it is but God has already been there before you ever get there and he's already prepared the way I think sometimes we have forgotten that we serve God we have forgotten that the god that we serve is the creator of the universe the god that we serve is the one that spun the heavens and put the stars in their place the God that I serve is the one that made the Seas and the water he made the animals he made everything he remains to be God now now there's nothing wrong now I think it's a powerful thing when your Visions amen start taking in now the seed that you of if you go back in the Bible the seed these boys were now they're standing in front of a furnace and they're being proven of what they're about to do what will they do and they have to make an answer without knowing what God's going to do but they're only answering what I'm going to do do you see what they did they made an answer now go back in the scripture and watch Abraham's seed when God tells Abraham you shall have a seed and that seed shall be as the stars of the the heaven is the Sands of the sea and when the seed or when the star when he talks about that seed when God is telling Abraham this there is no seed Abraham's not even a father but in the in the Bible about the 17th vers chapter God finally names Abraham a father and he has no children and and and Sarah don't even have a way to bring a child but he makes a promise concerning him so in Romans four the Bible said that he called things that were not as though they were and the things that were as they were not and so shall thy seed be see so shall the seed so shall the seed be just like Abraham see what he was doing was making a promise unto Abraham and his seed who was not yet it was a supernatural seed he was talking about oh my think about this before Abraham had a seed I want you to see this before he had a seed God was making promises about that seed he didn't even have a natural way to have a seed and God was making promises concerning that seed because God knew what he was going to do in those seeds now the scripture tells us in Genesis 22 when Abraham carries Isaac up on the mountain and he puts him on the Altar and ties his hand he's going to destroy him remember remember what Abraham said he said the boy and I go up and he said the boy and I will return turn now he's going up on the mountain to destroy his son by by the command of God but he's saying I'm going up and I'm coming down because the god that gave me this boy is able to raise this boy now look what he does when he gets up there amen he finds out that about the time he's going to take the life of that boy look what happens something stays his hand he was fully committed in doing everything that God had commissioned him to do and something stayed his hand an angel stayed his hand is that right and begin to say because thou H have not withheld thy son thine only son we don't even have time to preach do we come on he had ishel come on church he had ishel he had a son but not the son God was talking about he had a son but that wasn't the seed God was talking about he wasn't talking about the natural seed he's talking about a spiritual seed he's talking about a faith seed got not with held thy son th only son remember he said he began to prophesy over him and said thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemy immediately thy seed shall possess the gates of in other words this kind of faith will possess the Gate of an enemy this is what will possess every gate now it's a it's a powerful thing in Abraham in Genesis 22 concerning Isaac but then if you follow the verses of scripture it's just a few years later this is when the Bible records that Sarah dies and it's a time for Isaac to take a seed wife amen and and Abraham says you can't take a wife from just anywhere I've got to have a wife for my own seed amen now there was a lot of women down there but look look at that seed that existed in Rebecca when they offered her the choice of being the wife to Isaac y'all know what she did amen she literally heard the man out she possessed a revelation concerning amen what it took to be that bride amen that he did not give her it come from her own heart and then elaser be to say to them remember he be to say can the damsel go with me he ask her brother ask her mother and finally they said amen she's of age let her answer let the damel speak it with her own mouth elzar said well let her go ahead and say it and then she began to speak I will go with this man Remember When she gave the answer I I'm facing something that I don't understand but there's a seed in me saying to go with this man to to walk into the unknown because of the story that I've heard and believe I'm a part of that seed line now watch when she said that now now nobody told nobody told nobody what was prophesied over Abraham concerning Isaac but the minute that this was this was spoken out of her lips the minute the answer was given according to the Book of Genesis they begin to prophesy over her and they begin to say thou shall be the mother of thousands and as the Sands and as the stars and thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemy the very same thing that had been spoken on the mountain was now spoken over Rebecca concerning her seed because she was a part of the Seed of Abraham my when I think about that this morning it was a final test had to come out of her own lips think about it there they stand down there at a furnace a fiery furnace and they're being challenged and somebody is saying now tell us what you're going to do tell us what you're going to say tell us I'm challenging you what are you going to do the world is falling apart people are leaving the word people are falling away from the churches what are you going to do I know amen that that seed was challenged in that hour to make its own decision to answer for itself do you know that the prophets answers amen it's not going to satisfy God until you use the same answer you've got to pick up this word and answer the devil the same way he did the same way the pastor the same way every believer you know answers you've got to answer back to God my When I See This Be answer begin to come out of this out of these boys they begin to answer when they do amen that puts them in a position amen that they was it was out of their own lips you know sometimes it's got to come right out of your lips sometimes you got to speak it for yourself I've often said this if a man's flirting with a man's wife another man you you the husband can go over and say the guy don't you don't you flirt with my wife but if the wife's making eyes at the guy behind him you won't never stop that but if that woman don't want that all she has to do is say don't you do that no more and that'll settle that amen and if if the Old Devil is fting around behind the Lord the Lord's already said something but what are you going to say I mean what what are you going to say in the face of a situation or a trial of your life it's up to you are you going to Bow are you going to serve God are you going to bow to this it situation of your life and and just lay down and let the devil run over and do and now think about this because it puts the church in a position that these boys said nevertheless we will not bow to your Idols now that's a real Christian Courage God's able to deliver God's able to deliver live or die I'll stand here now that's now now that's that's real Christian Courage and everybody says well that's what I'll do but till you're faced with it you don't know what you'll do I always thought well I wonder what I'll do brother B I went over you used to preach in India a whole lot and I went over and I knew it was against the law to convert their Hindus to Christianity and some of the regions are a little more uh they're a little more um uh persecuting with that some of the regions are a little softer with it and we get into some of those regions well one I hadn't been going very many times me and Tony adma went into this region it was a backwoods region amen we was in there holding meetings next thing I know the police run into our meetings amen brought brother Tony out of the pull pit and put him in the back amen and there they were interrogating him and I'm sitting there going amen I'm looking around and I always wondered how I would react you know so I'm sitting right here in a minute something just come in me I just got up and started leading some songs told them let's go ahead and just Worship the Lord now that the police come got me too but but but I I wondered what I would do and it wasn't trying to be mean but there was there was nothing in me that was shaken by what was happening and I was just thinking the Lord because I would have been shooking I've been a I've been a good guy my whole life I don't want to go to jail amen but but but but what we're looking at is that in that moment I remember I remember sitting there one one morning we wake up about 3:00 or 4: in the morning I don't know what time it was exactly but we was living in a little Brick House Down In Black Rock Arkansas we woke up the whole thing was shaking the the bed was shaking it literally woke us up lived uh that's a there's a fault line down there near to where we was living and and the whole bedroom was just shaking it was shaking enough woke me up now that that takes some doing sometime at 3:00 or 4: in the morning and and when I woke up I felt the bed shaking and I knew we was in an earthquake and I always wondered you know cuz when I was a little boy I remember the the pastor that's about the only thing he preached on was Los Angeles is sinking there's an earthquake and we're going in a Rapture I remember those three things you know so we was always worried about that earthquake a little boy that in a boy's mind that sticks big you know so I always wondered what would I do in that moment if an earthquake begin to shake and I felt that shaking coming in the bed and I just lifted up from the bed and I remember I just begin to just begin to put my hands up and begin to Worship the Lord and I thought I didn't know where that come from it' just come out of me but but I had never been in a situation to find out what was going to happen in that moment and and God will allow situations to come into your life that you don't even understand how you're going to react but God knows how you were going to react God knows what's inside you God deposited something in you amen you're of a Heritage of a seed line come on that that seed of those Hebrew boys didn't die back there in the Bible it's still alive today the same kind of life that was in them that could look in the face of that fire is still on the inside of Believers in this hour yes that seed still lives now I'll tell you how they I'll tell you how they face the fire when they looked at the fire they didn't focus on the fire and you cannot focus on this fire you cannot focus your life on the situation and ever make it out of it let me let me just say this could I could I use a a term you understand it's time to look away to Jesus it's time to look into the Unseen it's time to put your focus on the word of God I don't know what the world's going to do I know it's going to fall apart but I don't want to fall apart with it I don't want to crumble with it come on church we met God put these boys on a rock set my feet on a rock put me on the kind of rock that Moses was standing on when the Red Seas couldn't stop him amen when the Red Seas couldn't keep him from passing he was set on a rock and God will set every believer on a rock come on you'll tie your own I don't know about you but I want to be tied to the absolute I don't want to be shaking and shivering I don't want to stand there in every uncertain situation and wonder what's going to happen God tied me to something that cannot be shaken well amen I believe it I believe it this morning the kingdoms of this world are shaken the Shook Up church amen the economy is shaking health systems are shaken amen the the military is shaken the Bible even says everything that can be shaken will be shaken but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken n it's falling apart but we are not falling apart because we have took a vision that transcends the problem that goes above the situation looking looking into the fire not looking at it amen I'm not going to stand there and look at that fire and wonder how hot it is and how much trouble I'm going to get and what kind of Situation's about to happen and how's this going to hurt me and what's this going to destroy me amen half the things you figure out's wrong anyhow come on church this anxiety and worry that's going on in this generation it's just horrible why worry about it pray about it what's worry going going to change you if you were dying in the morning if they were going to put you to death in the morning you could worry all night long and you're still going to die but if you begin to Pray by some have God might step in the way and change the situation wory will destroy you it'll give you a high blood pressure it'll make you Punchy it'll make you hard to get along with are you with me it'll put you in a nervous state but if you would begin to pray it'll put the spirit of Grace on you it'll put a kind word in your mouth and in a time of trouble there will be a stability in you you got to turn your focus from the fire to the man that's in the fire I love it brother Bram said they actually could see that they could actually see the man in the fire they could see the Fourth Man in the fire if you change your focus then you're going to have to ask who is that amen wouldn't it be something if we could see who it was in that fire amen turn your focus to the not the fire but but who's in that fire who is it in there what are we stepping into who is who is it in there the fourth man they said look like the Son of God somebody said brother brandom is said Daniel he said no it was Jesus it was not Jesus Amen in such as you know Jesus it was prefigure it was what Abraham met it was mdct it was Elohim it was God who was in that fire now the beauty of knowing who it is is because he was the god that made that promise to Abraham on that mountain the same one that had made the promise was the one standing in the fire to confirm the promise my lord it's one thing for God to promise something it's another to show up in the hour when the promise is needed and there God was standing in the flame of the fire showing them I'm not just a god when things are good I'm not just God when you're up here in the high places of your life but God is God when you're facing the fire when you're facing the trouble when the situations are there my God is still God he's not changing by the situation or this oh God he remains to be God I got to I got to reading on this last night got a little carried away myself I got to look at over in that fire and I started pulling back the flames and I got to hey you got to get a good clear look at him cuz he through Through the flames you might you might think he changed a little somehow a flame might be over you might think there's a little change to him but I promise the fire never changed him I promise you it may impede your vision but it'll never change him it may hinder the way you see him but it'll never change him the Fire doesn't have the power to do that are you hearing me and when they look through it just just pull back a couple Flames just pull back a couple and get a good look at him and I'll tell you what amen you'll hear Isaiah saying oh he's the Everlasting father you'll hear Isaiah say he's the prince of the peace you can hear Ezekiel say there's the wheel in the middle of the wheel amen there he is that's him that's the one that made the promise to Abraham if you pull it back a little more you can see what the Song of Solomon said about him when he said he's the rose of sharing oh I just like this one he's the lily of the valley I got to studying on that last night and my heart just carried away amen that that old Solomon would look in there and he would see Jesus and call him the lily of the valley can you imagine when oh when old meac pulled back the Flames a little looked there and said hey guys don't worry amen amen the Lily is already in the fire he's already in there the Lily is waiting on us now the prophet said why they called him the lily of the valley how many knows why they called Jesus the lily of the valley because it's a lily they make opium out out of right how how do they make opium they squeeze it down and they take the drug out and then men who get addicted or they're nervous or something they go to these opium houses and they smoke it and they get into a vision that transcends the conditions that they're in the situations you see they do it medically or they do it uh how could I say it now now you got to know that everything the devil has is only a perversion of what God has don't you ever think that some of you that done drugs out in the world don't you ever think that that wasn't a perverted desire it's not that God don't want you high he just don't want you hide on the devil's opium come on church it's not that God don't want you to get drunk he don't want you drunk on the devil's wine amen God does desire that a man how would you desire it if God didn't have something to fix it for you but Jesus is the fix to every opium addict he's the fix to every drug addict he's the fix to every alcoholic my Jesus is the fix to this entire world he's the fix to the flames of fire oh he is the lily of the valley my they pressed that down and took the Opium out of my Lord and brother B said you you can lay down in there and it'll bring peace to your life it'll bring it'll bring peace and Tranquility it'll carry you off as if you're in another dimension amen it can become hucog enic even people can do it and see visions and speak words that are not known to this world do you know that if a man would ever fall in love with Jesus long enough you'll see the world differently you see loved ones differently you see the church differently pull back them Flames you'll see he was a lily of the valley could I could I challenge you by saying this this was not a high point for the children of Hebrew for that for them three boys I would not think they thought they were on a mountain I would figure they thought they were in the greatest Valley of their life it was a valley of decision that become a Valley of Vision that's what happened they were in a valley do you know what you know what the devil thinks amen the devil thinks he can change your position and it'll cause you to react certain ways now is if where you are makes a difference of who God is but brother bam said the Lord Jesus is still the same God there's no difference in you you're God on the housetop you're God in the mountain you're God in the valley you're god of the sea you're god of the heavens you're God of creation you're the god of our life you're the god of everything he says there is your god he's the lily of the valley do y'all do y'all know the scripture teaches it it in First Kings chapter 20 that there was a group that believed that God was only the god of the mountain how many ever read that in First Kings chapter 20 the Bible records amen that there was a war going on and Ahab that Wicked King was leading Israel but God was fighting for Israel even though they had a wicked leader because he was their seed right and they went into a battle and they won a great battle on the mountain but when when Ahab began to relax God sent the prophet to tell him he said look don't don't you relax now don't relax because this same enemy that fought you on the mountain is going to regroup him with one time of one year he's going to return and he's going to attack you in the Valley now look what he's telling him he's telling him that this same enemy now that attack you on the mountain believes that he can return in the valley and get you now the Bible said amen that there was a counselor went to the king of the syrians there and actually told them that the god of Israel is only a god of the Mountaintop he's not a god of the Valley now you know why you do youall know why they believe that anybody ever studied to find out why they in the Book of Judges the Bible says that Judah ran the enemy off the mountain tops but when they went down into the valley that the the enemy had chariots that were banded with iron and they was not able to push the Chariots of the enemy out of the valley so the people in the regions begin to believe amen that Israel was Stronger on the mountain than they were in the valley the devil begin to believe that the God was confined to the mountain tops that's where his Temple was that's where everything was and in the mountain tops Israel is strong but if you can ever get them in the valley you can defeat them do you know that the devil believes that same thing this morning he believes you when you're here shouting in church he knows to leave you alone he takes his devils and goes and hides he said wait till tomorrow when they're weary with a bill wait till tomorrow till they got a flat on the car wait till tomorrow till there's a situation coming up in their life the devil believes that if he can get you in a valley he can destroy you in the valley that's what he believes anyhow but he's a dumb Devil he's a dumb devil because one thing he hasn't read about the Church of the Living God is we're not going to surrender to the devil whether we're on the mountain or we're in the valley whether we are victorious or whether we are destroyed it does not matter to us we will not bow our knee we will not Bend Our Lives Amen to this demon in this age you know what the Bible said amen the Bible actually said that because they had said this I love the scripture how it says it he said the children of n were of Israel were numbered in the 27 chap verse before them like two little flocks of kids and the syrians filled the country and there came a man of God and spake unto Israel and said thus saith the Lord I love a vision don't you amen a couple little kid are f a great Army and the word comes thus saith the Lord amen spake unto the king of Israel the syrians have said that the Lord is the god of the hill and he's not the god of the valley therefore will I deliver thee out of this great multitude and you shall know that I am the Lord isn't that powerful amen you're going to know that I'm the Lord You're Going to know that when you get in the valley is where the real Revelation is going to strike you when you're in the face of the fiery furnace that that's when the real Revelation is going to strike you you are not in control God is in control you're not in control of your life you're not in control of the world you cannot control things quit trying come on Church you cannot control world events you can't stay up all night and shoot your nails and control what the world's going to do and how the how the world's going to react and what kind of viruses are going to strike you cannot control the world we are not of this world we come from another place and God has sent a word into the church that even when you're in the valley I am still the Lord and you're going to know that I am the Lord are you hearing me this morning he is the lily of your Valley you said my goodness brother Wayne what are you saying I'm saying that God does miraculous things when you're in the valley He Still Remains to be God and he does it to prove to the devil that he is God whether a child is on the mountain or whether he's in the valley whether he's in a Red Sea whether he's standing at the Jordan oh come on church I love to read my Bible I just love it I just love it because you know what I found out I found out when David come to the children of Israel and was bringing food and Goliath was down there do you know where Goliath was standing he was standing in the valley he was challenging the children of God who was on the mountain to come in the valley and meet him and there wasn't anybody there that really belied that God was a god of the valley but David amen assumptious believe that he is God though he hide my soul in hell my God will find me he knew the God that he was serving let me tell you something you cannot put a child of God anywhere that God cannot show up on the scene yes sir it's where Goliath was he was in a Valley come on I love to see it it's that's right there was a valley when Moses was leading the children of Israel and they were fighting amalekites you know where the amalekites caught them caught them in the valley do you know how God defeated them took Moses to the mountain put a two men to hold up his arms and as long as his arms were lifted the children of Israel could look out of the valley and see a vision of victory in the middle of the valley of division of division and and defeat now now you you've heard it told that in that Valley you've heard it told in that Valley uh that that aren't hand toand combat it can get personal right and you can get caught up in your own little world your own little battle and forget about the full battle but if there was somebody on the hill you could look away from the battle right in front of you and you could see how the battle was going in general you might be losing a battle but see look up to Moses and see how the war is going and as long as Moses's hands was up the individuals in the valley believe we're going to have a victory and as long as you believe there's a victory there's going to be a victory and as long as they were fighting under the banner of Victory there was a victory going on in those valleys amen now think about it because the devil was trying to destroy them in a valley but God put somebody on a mountain that could give a Vision to somebody in the valley in other words when you get in the lowest parts of your Valley then it's time to look up now y'all know that when God got ready he prepared us a greater than Moses and he took our lord Jesus and he put him on the cross on a hill of gtha and he stretched his hands and nailed them to the cross that they could never come down so anytime a Believer from the Val looks to Calvary they will see the raised hands of Jesus Christ they will see a sign of Victory no matter where they're standing if you can part the Flames look to Calvary if you can look past the gate see the Promise God has already put a vision in there that would be able to defeat now I could keep going on this Valley a while because I found out this is exactly where Elisha met them remember the other night we preaching on worship and he told him to bring a and let a vision come y'all remember that that happened in the valley you know what you know what Elisha said to them when they got in the valley and couldn't get out he said dig your Valley full of ditches and God will fill it with water you're not going to hear any rain you're not going to see any du but God will fill it with water brother man said where was it he said the water was in the rock that was below them and if they would just keep digging they would break into the spirit of God listen to me Church God's above you God's under you God's in you God's all around you you can't go anywhere and not find God my God is Not depending upon the condition whether you're on the mountain or in the valley he is still godo my I don't know if God still fights in The Valleys oh yeah y'all know that one of the famous Wars of Yong kapor that was fun I'm probably not pronouncing that right sister sister GRS are here she probably get me but anyhow I I try my best but she's not here okay I'm okay then but y'all remember when Israel was worshiping in October and they was under the the Feast of atonement they was all worshiping God that's when the enemy decided to attack because they had their attention they thought well they're not paying attention so we'll get them but they was focusing on the right thing they focusing on the Lord and you know what happened if you read the Golden Heights battle they call it now the Valley of Tears go read it go read about the valley of it's a powerful it's a powerful lesson but in the Valley of Tears that's when the Syrian Army attacked Israel unbeknown and they had like 1,200 tanks to 300 is that the right number it's very close it's about 1,00 takes to 300 and by the time that the assault was coming to an end Israel only had a couple tanks left and was almost out of bullets and here come about 350 Syrian tanks Over the Horizon and all of the sudden out of nowhere the syrians turn around and run and later amen they was some of the some of the war strategist people today they were studying the the the battle scene and they were saying well they they were seeing the tanks moving and they thought there was a lot more tanks than there was but they asked the Mad interrogated one of the Syrian generals that was leading the attack and he said he said y'all believe what you want to but I'll tell you what happened he said was a host of Angels standing at the border of Israel and a white hand come out of heaven and said stop and go no further he said now wouldn't you have stopped and turn around and left you can believe what you want to but a hand come out of heaven and says stop and go no further do you know God still has his hand that will stop the enemy in his tracks I know there's a lot of Devils coming against the church but church we will not surrender we'll fight this devil we'll fight him in the fire we'll fight him in the water we'll fight him oh come on church we'll fight him in our praise we'll fight this devil wherever he shows up but we will not surrender we will not turn around we will not go back I think it's time for the church to remember you're the Seed of Abraham brother Wayne I can't I can't worship from this place musicians would come tell me about Jonah go ahead and tell me go ahead Jonah tell me tell me how deep the ocean is tell me how deep you are in that in the belly of that well said brother you just don't understand you tell me one person in this building this morning's worse off and Jonah was Jonah was swallowed by a well in the bottom of an ocean and the Bible said he turned and looked he transcended the condition and caught a vision that Solomon said in a prayer If any man would turn and look to the temple I will deliver him well I tell you this morning we are not looking to the East and we are not looking to any natural Temple but we are putting our Eyes Upon Jesus Christ and the deliverer that was in a fire the deliverer that was in the belly of a whale is the deliverer of the Church of the Living God this morning and I believe it I believe it with all of my heart I believe you can begin to be turned into Judah in the middle of the valley come on y'all know who Judah was judah's the fourth son of Leah isn't you by the time four Sons come along she had already got upset because seemed like that Isaac wasn't going to love her or Jacob but it it seemed like it wasn't going to happen Isaac uh Jacob yeah seemed like Jacob was I'm sorry names are flipping around on me you ought to be up here where I'm at all kinds of things flipping around on me but the time they got to the four son you know what J you know what Le said I will praise the Lord and she named Judah the name because of the praise and do you know who went first in the battles do you know who went the first in the battles of Israel it was Judah because Judah was the praise and whenever God has children that will praise him he will come down and prove to the world that he remains to be God come on Church you're you're that Rahab in the Bible who married a general from the tribe of Judah you have married the chief of Praise You have married the high priest of Praise Jesus Christ the son of God look here you look up at him tonight and if you can't find a reason to worship him look again if you can't pull back some fire and find a reason to worship God you said brother Wayne I'm in the Valley look up to the mountain then I'm in the fire pull back the fire and see the lily of the valley is standing there I don't know what you're going through I just know sitting in my room the Lord just kept bringing this again and again and again he is God anywhere he is God and there is no other so brother Wayne you mean you mean even in hell oh oh I'm glad you ask cuz according to my Bible when them Hebrew children were in that kind of trouble somebody come in fire with them but when the entire world fell under sin the Devil Couldn't whip us up in heaven so we F in the valley of humanity and here he come chasing and the same one that was in heaven descended right into the Earth and stood on the earth and defeated sicknesses he defeated situations he raised the dead he conquered everything that could be conquered and cast the enemy out and the enemy run to the deepest valley into the inner Chambers he run into hell but our Lord took death into his bosom and chased him into the regions of Hell Hallelujah he said to him you're not getting away from me anywhere you're not going to pull back and say to my children that that you whip me anywhere any place any time and he knocked on the door of the gates of hell and took from the Devil the keys to his own house and ascended under Glory with the keys of death hell and the grave whether you're in the grave he's God amen amen when Abraham was stuck in hell God come and got him out brother Wayne what are you what are you trying to say I'm trying to say there's a vision this morning that will transcend the condition that you're
