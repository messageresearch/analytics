I I I tell you I like to see that I like to see that word tested in humanity and then see it prevail. And then when it prevails, then we know the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a it's such a blessing to it. Amen. And uh we got a few things on our heart tonight. And and just before we go into the word of the Lord, maybe we just have a word of prayer tonight. And Amen. Let's just bow our hearts together. Father, we thank you tonight for your grace that you have given us. I thank you for this song service, Lord, for the blessing that it's been to our spirits, Lord. Father, to see your children entering in the gates with thanksgiving in their heart. Lord, we just ask you tonight that you would come on the scene, that you [music] would touch these needs. Father, Lord, we have gathered in this place tonight to worship you. We've gathered here tonight to come around your word, Lord. The highest order of worship is the preaching of your gospel. And we ask tonight that you would take your word, Lord, and that you would speak to the need of your children. We invite you to the platform, [music] Lord, that you would lead us down these paths, Father. And Lord, that you would make clear and the revelation, Lord, would be so plain in our hearts tonight, Lord. Now, Father, we commit this service and the needs of your people into thy faithful hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. Excuse me. If you have your Bibles, let's go to the book of Hebrews, the first chapter. Can you give me a little bit in the ear monitor itself? Amen. Hebrews chapter 1 and we'll go into the first chapter uh and again the first two verses. I've got some things here uh that I'd like to continue this um I've been building it just a little bit and amen in Hebrews chapter 1 1 and two just a little more in the actual ear monitor. Amen. Hebrews 1 and 1 and two for God who at sunundra times and divers manners and brother random it it points out that the Bible was written by man but the author of scripture is God and it and Paul says it here God who at 100 times and in diverse manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets in various times in various ways to various people. [clears throat] But he hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. May the Lord bless his words. You could be seated tonight. I'm just going to be continuing this if I can speaking to you from this Hebrews chapter 1. And I want I want to if we would take a a subtopic. We're going to be looking tonight at dispensations. Amen. dispensations and as you can see it here in Hebrews 1:es 1 and two uh you know by this time Paul is writing this book of Hebrews he's actually uh approaching the Jews he's speaking to the people uh of the law the beautiful thing about the Bible is one of the part of the Bible doesn't have to disallow another part of the Bible but if it's a Bible revelation it can include what is former and show you the truth uh that exists upon Uh when when Paul speaks here in the book of Hebrews, uh some people think like you take the Old Testament, they think, well, see, when you got the New Testament, the Old Testament's not in good anymore. But really, what good would the book of Hebrews really be to us without the book of Leviticus? &gt;&gt; But because there is a book of Leviticus, then we understand the the laws, we understand the priesthoods, we understand uh what God would do through the through the sacrifices. And because you have those laws and those sacrifices and those people that were trained in that over hundreds of years, then when they hear the book of Hebrews coming from Apostle Paul, now he's explaining to them what Jesus Christ is by what the Old Testament was. So the Old Testament is actually unfolded by the book of Hebrews rather than done away with. He's just showing them what it is happening. So as Paul begins by saying this God in sunundra times and diverse manners and he's talking about God and he's talking about him doing the speaking now he's trans transferring to the idea amen that it's now his son it's not just prophets it's not just law but now we're dealing with the son himself and and by the time that Paul is speaking these things unto the Jews now now Christ has already been crucified it's he's already been resurrected uh the the atonements have already been made and now Paul is only telling them by the word what has already happened. And I think this is amazing because it's the greatest proof to us that salvation is by faith because they couldn't be a part of the cross. See, they couldn't they couldn't be with them and part of the disciples and they couldn't had been a part of the happenings around Calvary and the resurrection. That was all passed at this point. But what Paul is doing is he's now bringing them in to what has happened by the preaching of it. And when they heard that word according to the fourth chapter, you could enter into it by your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now there's an undercurrent or an underlay. I hope you're hearing what what what happened for them. Turn around and look at us today. And we can't go back in the 60s. We we're not able to go back in the time when brother Brand was opening those seals and and those things were happening. But we can preach it about it today and then we can we can enter into it by our faith in what has happened because those things have already been done. Amen. One more time. I'm sorry. Can you EQ that a little bit? Maybe take out some of the base of that. Amen. I'm I'm switched ears on you to the right tonight. Amen. I'm not working for the uh secret service. I This is just my own little monitor in my ear. Amen. Amen. So being this this way this room is set up, it it actually helps it so these ain't so loud and it helps it uh fix it the the equalizes it. But what you seeing is is Paul is trying to uh speak to them about Christ in the last days. And I love how this says it. For he hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he've appointed heir of all things. So spoken to us by his son. Now, in Matthew the 17th chapter, let's turn there and and these things will come up later in in the book of Hebrews. And I'll get deeper into them, but I want to just set this in your mind a moment. In Matthew chapter 17, let's read these first five verses. And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up on a high mountain apart. Now, there's a lot of good preaching right there, isn't it? He he he took him in a special experience and and he he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto him Moses and Elias talking with him. Now there now Peter seeing something and then watch how Peter interprets. He said then answered Peter and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make three tabernacles. One for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. Now, isn't it amazing how Peter when he sees something, this is how he interprets. This is what he thinks. This is what should be done because of what we're seeing. And the Bible says, "And while he yet spake, while he was given his interpretation, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them and said, Behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him." Now, Brother Bam, an identified masterpiece, will say this. While he spake, there came a voice out of the cloud, and it said, "This is my beloved son, and I'm pleased with him. I'm going to smite him for you. Hear ye him. He's going to speak. &gt;&gt; Now, when the scripture says, "Hear ye him." That's a prophecy that he's going to speak. How can you hear him unless he speaks? Now, again, in Mark chapter nine, and there was a cloud that overshadowed them, seventh verse, and a cloud came out, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." And suddenly when they had looked around about they saw no man anymore save Jesus only with themselves. Now here we find he says to him this is my beloved son. Hear ye him. Brother man says it in the masterpiece again. He says it like this. We found him on transfiguration and there stood Moses the law. There stood Elijah the prophet. See the law and prophets are until. See there stood the law and there stood the prophets. He says, "And then all the way back from the patriarchs and the fathers, the law and prophets, and all of them are standing there, and we hear a voice coming down from the heavens and saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." See, there's Moses. There's Elias. There's laws and prophets. But now God is saying, "Hear my son." Amen. See, this is him. And if we're going to hear him, he's going to have to speak. And it was just a few days before he was smitten. Now see what it was. He says, "I'm pleased to dwell in. I've been 4,000 years bringing whom to this. He is so perfect. I'll have to smite him so he can speak. Hear ye him. He is the perfected one. He is the masterpiece." SO WHAT GOD IS SAYING IS is what all the law and prophets were looking at. This is actually what they were trying to say. This is a a more clear uh uh word than than what you've heard of all of the prophets and what they had to say. Jesus was the fulfillment of the perfection of the words of all those prophets. And now God was saying, "Hear ye him." How many knows that was his adoption ceremony. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said from that time on, whatever you needed, you would have to hear him. If you needed life, he you'll have to hear him. If you need healing, you'll have to hear him. Amen. So the scriptures are showing us now that you have to hear him, but to hear him, he has to speak. And this is THIS IS WHAT PAUL IS SAYING. The law and the prophets have been speaking, but now it's the son that's going to speak. And and and we find quickly that he that he dies and he is buried and he's resurrected. Amen. But did his voice stop when he left the earth? but rather the Bible said, "He that heareth my voice and believeth upon him that has sent me hath EVERLASTING LIFE." NOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO put it upon the voice of hearing the voice of God is how you're going to have life, then you're going to have to know the voice you're hearing is THE VOICE OF GOD. SEE, YOU CAN'T JUST HEAR THE voice of anything. ANYBODY CAN SAY THAT THEY HAVE AUTHORITY, BUT THE ONLY TRUE AUTHORITY is the authority that you can take back to Jesus Christ. Now uh uh you if you look at this in in a very clear language and and you see then that a voice has got to be identified then the only way you can do that is you have to trace it right. Where did that voice leave? Amen. When it left Jesus where did it go? Where did that voice go? And you know you you can trace it quickly to his disciples. Whosoever you receive receiveth him that sent me. We see it go into Apostle Paul and we see the first church age message. And Paul is saying to the people, IF ANYBODY SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT than I'm saying, let him be accur. Because see, I'm God's voice to this generation. To this age, I'm the voice. He sent to the to is to THIS AGE. NOW, NOW WATCH UP THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES after the ending of scripture and the apostles that became a mucky and miry and a dark saying of who really spoke for God. That's when the Catholics begin to rise up. And then and then soon thereafter about the time America was bored, here come the denominations and Luther's and Baptists and all these things and everybody is saying they speak for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But unless you can tell me where the voice went from Apostle Paul all the way to the day, how would you know what voice you're hearing? BUT SEE, GOD PROMISED IN THE LAST DAYS to bring a clarity when he said in the evening time there shall come light and the confusion's going to leave and we're going to know exactly who we're hearing and what we're hearing from because God made a promise to the church. &gt;&gt; He realizes Brother Bram said the message of the hour is a mount transfiguration experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a mount transfiguration experience. In other words, when every voice is speaking, Amen. We have heard a voice out of a cloud saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." Amen. A voice of authority. In John chapter 16, it's Jesus that prophesies when he says to his disciples in the 12th verse, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when the Spirit of truth has come, he will guide you into all truth, and he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and will show you things to come." SO JESUS IS SAYING I got things to say but when the spirit of truth comes he'll say them to you. Right. &gt;&gt; How many knows that in the message spirit of truth, brother Bam reads the scripture John 16 and in the end of that in the end of spirit of truth he will say the scripture I read this morning this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears that he was fulfilling that John 16 the spirit of truth was using the message of the hour to fulfill prophecy when he said I got things to say but you cannot hear them now do you know that's a direct prophecy of the opening of the seals. How many knows brother Bam taught that? That's a direct prophecy that the seals Jesus was going to speak them himself. The the ideas that brother Brandham gives on the seals is not William Brandham's ideas. Amen. It's the prophecy that Christ was supposed to speak in THE LAST DAYS. AMEN. AND THERE WILL BE A PEOPLE TO HEAR him when he speaks. I'm so glad. Amen. In John 16, look what he says. Now, if you continue reading John 16, and I'll throw this in because we're in the middle of it, but John 16, you watch. If you continue on just a little bit later, Jesus is continuing prophesying, and he said that there'll come a little time, Amen. Uh there'll come a little time of sadness, but then your sorrow is going to be turned to joy. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He's telling them disciples that you're going to be sad when I'm crucified, but if you'll hang on, your sorrow will be turned to joy. Just a few days later, he appears to two of these on the road to Emmas. AND HOW ARE THEY WALKING? THEY are walking saddened and d downtrodden. And when Jesus comes up to them, he says, "Oh, you slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoke unto you." And then he begin to take the scriptures that spoke of himself, laid out an entire revelation, and then comes right down to the end of the day's journey. They had journeyied about six ages. And at the end of the day's journey, seventh hour, they went into a little room and there he broke open the word to them and they left there with the joy of knowing he was alive. Amen. Their sorrow was turned to joy. That's right. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW BROTHER RANDOM USES THAT SAME prophecy in a in a sermon called a man running from the presence of God? You ever hear the sermon man running from the presence of God? Remember he told the bride, "You lay in the presence. Don't run from the presence." He's showing you that the message is the presence of God in this age. And it's not something to run from. It's our obligation to lay in it. Amen. AND LET IT BAKE THE GREENNESS OUT OF OUR LIVES. And in the middle of man running from his presence now, the next services, he's fisting to preach. He's fisting to teach who's this Melazdc this day, the scripture. And he's going to teach marriage and divorce. Amen. Amen. And I think also what the attraction same same set of sermons. Amen. And and he says this. He says in the end of man running from the presence they're having a wonderful uh altar meeting. The spirit is moving and brother Bam just starts screaming out. HE SAID AND MANY OF YOUR SORROWS shall be turned to joy. He said that's prophecy now. Amen. And you know the very next services he stands there in marriage and divorce and looks out across that crowd and he says what you have done is wrong. He said, "But as the son of man on the earth," remember he says, "I forgive you in the name of the Lord, GO DON'T DO IT ANYMORE." LISTEN, WILLIAM BRANDHAM didn't have the power to FORGIVE SINS. FOLKS, THAT WASN'T WILLIAM BRANDOM EXCUSING THEIR MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE PROBLEMS. THAT WAS THE VOICE. THAT WAS THE VOICE OF HIM THAT MADE THE PROMISE, "YOUR SORROW SHALL BE TURNED into joy." I'LL TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL REALLY have a revelation at times or an understanding of the reality OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING when this message is coming TO US. IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER CHURCH AGE. IT'S NOT A LAW OR A PROPHET. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTED son of God. No wonder Brother BRANDON WILL SCREAM OUT, "AMEN. I AM GOD'S VOICE TO YOU." &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, AMEN. The sorrows will be turned to joy. The seals breaks the answers. Now, Brother Brandham, how many realize this he was fulfilling more than one commission when he was in the earth? He was the spirit of Moses. He was the spirit of Elijah. And he also was the spirit of Joshua. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He was also the spirit of Joshua. God bless you, Sister Darlene. Good to have you home. Amen. Canada couldn't keep you. Amen. Amen. You know, it it's a uh it's a beautiful thing when you WHEN YOU START SEEING HOW THE the scriptures will open these areas to to OUR HEARTS. WHEN BROTHER BRANDON WOULD STAND THERE AND SAY, "WHAT'S my commission? Drop a Bible. It opens to the book of Joshua." He he said, "I was praying one day and out of the heavens come the book of THE BIBLE AND IT opened to the first chapters of Joshua and a finger just started reading the book of Joshua and that was his commission." Now the THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN this generation is that we can look back at the dispensations and we know dispensation is true and we can see two men. We can see Moses and we can see Joshua and we can mark the change of that dispensation. We can see John the Baptist and we can see Jesus and we can mark the changes of that dispensation. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BROTHER BRANDHAM, AMEN, he's introducing one who is invisible and is LITERALLY USING HIS BODY. AMEN. AND PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS THAT THE THAT THE PROPHET IS SAYING, "I'M NOT HIM, BUT HE'S HERE." SO, IT'S A SON OF MAN REVEALING THE SON OF MAN. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A SON OF MAN, DON'T MEAN THE SON OF MAN WASN'T DOING THE TALKING. AMEN. AND IF YOU CAN EVER SEE THAT, THAT WAS A JOSHUA MINISTRY. JOSHUA WAS THERE TO DIVIDE THE INHERITANCE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. HE TOOK THEM BY NAME AND UNDER INSPIRATION, PLACED THEM BY INSPIRATION. Oh my goodness. He took the word and applied it to the individual. And that's exactly the ministry of William Brham was TO TAKE THE BIBLE IN THE END TIME SCRIPTURES AND SEPARATE IT TO THE BRIDE OF CHRIST AND SAY THIS BELONGS to you. This belongs to you. This belongs to you. No, you can't have that. That's the Jews and and that belongs to to the foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; Do you see HE HE WAS ABLE to tell you who YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH HIM. THAT SECOND PULL, your name is your address is what's ON YOUR HEART. THIS HE COULD HE COULD HE COULD PLACE THAT PERSON EVERY TIME. BUT THAT THIRD PULL WAS SAYING WHAT YOUR NAME WAS BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN. HE WAS CALLING THE MYSTERY OF YOUR NAME. PLACING YOU IN A BRIDE AGE TELLING YOU EVERY PROMISE IN THE BOOK IS YOURS. YOU'RE NOT AN ANGEL. Never will be. &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU'RE NOT A SERVANT. YOU NEVER WILL BE. YOU'RE SONS. YOU ALWAYS WERE SONS. I'M IDENTIFYING YOU AS SONS. THIS IS YOUR INHERITANCE AND THIS IS WHAT GOD has done for you. &gt;&gt; Do you see what it was? It was a it was a dividing of it. Now, now, now if you if you watch the Bible, it's it's you got to be so careful to not become your own absolute. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's one of the biggest arguments in in the world that I know of right now. And some of the message ranks even and I I don't think it should be an argument anymore, but the absolute people say, "Well, the Bible's my absolute." And you know I I agree that's a very good statement. The Bible is an absolute &gt;&gt; but you know every good Baptist has got a Bible &gt;&gt; and most good Lutheran and most good Wesleans and and a lot of good Christian nominal Christian people has got a Bible and and they would die to prove to you that this is the inherent word of God. But they use that same Bible &gt;&gt; and they'll tell you that you're supposed to be baptized in a trinitarian doctrine. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Come on now. The women will cut their hair and you can take the Bible THEY SAY HAS NO error in it &gt;&gt; and turn to first Corinthians and read out of the Bible where the hair is a covering to a woman and she shouldn't pray without her hair covered, &gt;&gt; her head covered. You can read it right OUT OF THE BIBLE. AMEN. But they have a different interpretation of it. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE INTERPRETATIONS OF all the denominations is wrong. AMEN. BUT WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL to not have our own absolute. &gt;&gt; And become our own absolute. See, and let THE WORD OF GOD SAY WHAT IT SAYS AND BE WHAT IT IS WITHOUT US GETTING IN THE WAY. YOU KNOW, usually when usually when someone doesn't when they really have a problem with you saying, "Brother Bam's an an absolute authority on it." When usually what they're really saying is, "I have some scripture. I don't agree with Brother Brandham's interpretation." Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's usually really what's being said. It's kind of hid back there, but you know, we got we got preachers today and I I I don't I don't mean to be mean, but we got people that don't have a congregation. They just got a YouTube channel or something. They don't have no miracles. They don't have no signs. They don't have nothing. There's nothing that God has done to confirm them. Amen. But yet they take brother Bam's sermons and try to tell people why they shouldn't believe him or where he was wrong on this or where he was wrong on this or brother Bam, you know, he he should have did this and he should have said IT LIKE THIS. LET ME TELL YOU, THAT'S THE VOICE OF THE SERPENT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SAME VOICE THAT SPOKE TO EVE in the Garden of Eden. Amen. Because he became an interpreter OF WHAT GOD SPOKE TO HER. WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS JUST TOOK THE WORD OF GOD AND SAID AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD AND THEN SHE COULD HAVE LIVED IN FAITH AND SHE COULD HAVE LIVED IN HAPPINESS. AMEN. AMEN. LISTEN. AMEN. YOU YOU WE GET SO AFRAID SOMEBODY'S GOING TO THINK WE'RE dumb or that we DON'T HAVE THE GREATEST INTELLIGENCE. LISTEN, YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT WAYNE LAWSON, BUT I'M DUMB ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. I'M DUMB AND I'M NOT SO SMART THAT I HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER FOR EVERY LITTLE PERSON AND EVERYTHING. I'VE GOT AN ANSWER FROM GOD. JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND SENT THIS MESSAGE AMONG US. AND IT'S A VINDICATED TRUTH. IT'S A VINDICATED WORD OF GOD. AND THE VOICES THAT AGREE WITH IT, AMEN. I CAN TRUST THAT VOICE. And the VOICE THAT DISAGREES WITH IT, THANK YOU. You told me who you are. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't have to ask. If you'll listen, they'll tell you who they are. When they say, "Well, Brother Ram said this and this and this, but &gt;&gt; I think it's like this and this." And and I say thank you. Thank you for explaining to me your view so as I know not to listen to you. &gt;&gt; There will come a time in THIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; WHERE PEOPLE WILL GET ENOUGH STRENGTH AND courage to tell these men, you're not saying WHAT PAUL SAID. NOW SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT'S UNINSPIRED LEADERSHIP THAT'S TRYING TO BUILD THEIR OWN KINGDOMS AMONG GOD'S PEOPLE. AMEN. AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH KINGDOMS. AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH EIGHTH DAY MESSENGERS AND AND AND AND MESSAGE FIXERS. WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE MESSAGE FIXERS. WE NEED SOME MESSAGE BELIEVERS. WE NEED SOME SONS OF GOD THAT HAVE DECIDED THIS MESSAGE IS TRUE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE IT. I THINK IT'S TIME. AMEN. THAT WE STAND IN OUR IN OUR GOD-GIVEN INHERITANCE AND TELL THE DEVIL, "GET OUT OF IT." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. That's right. That's right. Well, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Do you see what it is? You got to be careful because when you start letting spirits interpret it, you're going to end up the antichrist in a minute if you're not careful. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Y'all know, y'all know Peter tried to do that, don't you? &gt;&gt; When the Lord said, "Somebody's going to betray me," the Bible said Peter said, "Lord, is it me?" Where in the world, and how in the world could Peter ever arrive at the idea HE'S THE ANTICHRIST? JUDAS HAD THAT POSITION from before the world began. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But Peter becoming his own absolute &gt;&gt; is now trying to apply Hebrews 6 to himself. &gt;&gt; Let me let me just tell you right quick. When when you're a believer and the devil's trying to apply Hebrews 10 to you, let me tell you, you're out of place. &gt;&gt; That is that that scripture has nothing to do with a message believer at all. That's right. &gt;&gt; It is completely to unbelievers that have heard of the death, burial, and resurrection and but don't believe it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not talking about you made a failure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; now there was an antichrist. There was one. Right. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus talks to Peter, remember what he said to him? He said, "Now Peter, Satan would desire to sift thee a sin, &gt;&gt; but I have prayed for thee. Why not just let the security of the prayer of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; become the arms of comfort OVER EVERY LISTEN, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DEVIL THROWS AT ME. JESUS PRAYED A THANKSGIVING PRAYER FOR ME AND SAID, "FATHER, I THANK THEE THAT THOU HAST GIVEN THESE UNTO ME WHICH YOU GAVE ME BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN." WELL, I TELL YOU, IF I'M GOING TO PUT MY name somewhere, I'm going to PUT IT RIGHT THERE. I'M GOING TO TELL THE DEVIL, "HEY, HEY, I ALREADY KNOW WHO I AM. I ALREADY know where I belong." DO YOU SEE THIS? AMEN. JUDAS WAS JUDAS'S position couldn't BE TOOK BY PETER because Peter HAD A COMPLETE DIFFERENT PLACE. &gt;&gt; But the minute you start trying to self- interpret, you'll get yourself over there in that place. it. I I don't know if you I I wished I had the ability to to to to to show you the real meaning behind letting someone alter &gt;&gt; because what it's doing is if you see if you can't believe brother Bam on this point &gt;&gt; when it comes to committing blasphemy because you failed you you you're already undermined. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do do you see what the devil's doing? He undermines you over here on something small. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother man, maybe he didn't know what he's talking about. Well, when it comes to something important, how are you going to automatically have a perfect faith again? &gt;&gt; So, Satan undermines you on the small thing. Amen. So, then people say, "Well, I think brother Wayne's nearly idolatrous about not arguing with a prophet." Well, let me tell you why I don't argue with A PROPHET. CUZ WHEN GOD GOT ME, I WAS JUST A HILLBILLY. AMEN. OUT THERE IN THE MUCK AND MIRE. I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I WASN'T TRYING TO BE A CHRISTIAN. GOD COME AND GUIDE ME AND CALLED ME AND SHOWED ME THIS MESSAGE AND EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE. EVERY BIT OF GIFT, EVERY BIT OF MINISTRY, EVERY BIT OF BLESSING IN MY LIFE HAS COME BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD HAD TO SAY. I REFUSE TO LET SOMEBODY RIP that away from me. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; By the way, it goes too far. Well, I I tell you why. I'm too far to help. So, leave me alone. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'M HAPPY JUST LIKE I am. &gt;&gt; I I sleep at night. I don't worry about my predestination. I don't worry about baptism. I don't worry about marriage and divorce. I don't WORRY ABOUT THE TRINITY. I don't worry ABOUT THE GODHEAD. I DON'T WORRY ABOUT NONE OF IT CUZ I'VE GOT A A VOICE THAT HAS ANSWERED IT IN AND SAID, "AMEN. JUST REST. JUST REST. THIS YOUR MARCH. IT'S A RESTING TIME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEARY NO MORE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE NO MORE. DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ANY VOICE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REST, young people. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You can rest with this message. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU SEE NOW WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING. You must not become your own private interpreter of scripture. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Watch this. IN SECOND PETER. NOW PETER Peter's the one he was up on the mountain. See, and he had his interpretation and that voice said, "Now hush up, Peter. Hear you him." Peter self interprets and had himself as the antichrist. &gt;&gt; And now watch in second Peter 1, he's telling about that holy mountain. He said, "We have a more sure word of prophecy and we do that we take heed as a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in our hearts." Y'all know that day star is vindicated word, right? &gt;&gt; It's the message coming. KNOWING THIS FIRST, you got to know this one. &gt;&gt; No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. &gt;&gt; FOR THE PROPHECY CAME not in old time by the will of man, BUT BY HOLY MEN OF God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. It is of no private interpretation. &gt;&gt; The prophet said there, see the scripture is of no private interpretation. And it was wrote by the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is the only one who can reveal it. For it is hid from the eyes of wise and prudent, revealed unto babes. Y'all know that's the Bible. So if you don't watch it, if you don't use the mind of the Holy Spirit to put it together, you'll have a scene that's all mixed up. For instance, like a cow picking grass in the top of a tree. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, people say, "Well, brother, that's a crazy thought." Now, here's the same thing. Brother Bam likens some of the thinking of the church to that that amazingly out of place. He said it's about some of the way things look when they think that we could go to heaven by shaking the hands of a preacher &gt;&gt; or being baptized in water or some little creed that we repeat. How ridiculous is that? &gt;&gt; Right. right &gt;&gt; now. I I I um I I I should have got with Abby before the service and had her make me a draw and I I was thinking about it. I I was thinking about I I had AI to generate me one, but they couldn't get the picture. You know, they they they didn't get what Brother Bam was saying. He said, I expressed a few moments ago, Brother Bam was talking about reading between the lines. How many of you got to read between the lines? &gt;&gt; Sure. Read between the lines. Say something between the lines. See, the Bible is like a jigsaw puzzle. Now, here comes another another area of this. It It's like a jigsaw's buzz. If you'll excuse the expression, it's put together the way you look at. You got to have something over here to look at, and if you don't, you'll ruin the scene. See, you'll have a cow picking grass top of the tree, so it won't be right. See, that's the way it is. When you try to put the Bible together with intellectual understanding, you can't do it. It's a spirit written word. It takes the Holy Spirit to put it together. See, the Bible is not a Lego block. It's a jigsaw puzzle. &gt;&gt; Now, Legos will go together as you're imagining can put it together. You you can build about anything you want out of Legos. They go together so many ways, but a jigsaw puzzle, it already has a picture before you start putting it together. You're trying to match something that's already there. So, when God wrote the Bible, there was an intention he had. Then he put the pieces in the Bible and maybe there's a piece in John and there's a piece in James and there's a piece in Revelations and there's a piece over here IN GENESIS AND HE'LL HAVE PUZZLE PIECES ALL OVER THE BIBLE. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE YOU CAN'T JUST START reading and say, "Well, this is this and this is this and this is this and this." BECAUSE YOU'LL MISS things &gt;&gt; because God MAY PUT A PIECE of the end time in THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER SCRIPTURE. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE AUTHOR, you'll think it applies to a different age. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; NOW, I'LL JUST PROVE IT to you in Isaiah 61. You heard it. And when Jesus picks up Isaiah 61 and begins to read, he only reads half of the of the first verse of Isaiah 61. And he said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord." and stopped and said this DAY THIS SCRIPTURE. THAT'S ONLY HALF OF that scripture. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ISAIAH SPOKE IT, HE SAID IT IN ONE HE SAID IT IN ONE VERSE. HE DIDN'T HE didn't break it. He put a period in there. AND HOW WAS WE SUPPOSED to know that that would be a 20 a 2,000 year space at one period in the Bible. BUT SEE, WHEN A PROPHET COMES ALONG, THE AUTHOR, JESUS, KNEW NOT TO READ ANYMORE THAT BECAUSE THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AIN'T put in the puzzle to 2,000 years later. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But but a theologian couldn't catch that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz literary sciences don't write things like that. &gt;&gt; Right. Now, now if you if you could I wish I had the ability to have a picture to show you, but if you took a jigsaw puzzle and you had a cow eating grass and you had a big tree and it was all right there in the puzzle, but then you start putting it together and you know with uh with uh how could I say with perceptions, you could have a cow eating grass, but if you don't put the borders of the puzzle on, you don't finish the puzzle. You could by perception you could make it look like that THAT THAT THAT TREE IS THE ground and you'd have that cow eaten right out of that tree. SEE, BROTHER RAMA IS TRYING TO SHOW YOU until the whole puzzle is put together correctly, you'll never really understand what those things are. It has to wait till the end time. That's why THAT THIS MESSAGE COULDN'T COME IN THE THIRD AGE OF THE FOURTH AGE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WHOLE PICTURE. But in the last age, here comes a prophet along and he's explaining the puzzle. It's a jigsaw puzzle. It already has a picture. So when you're preaching the message, it must match &gt;&gt; what's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; See, when you try to put it together, Brother Brandham says it'll take a spiritual revelation. See, the Holy Spirit will reveal it or we'll fail to get it. And somebody says, "Well, Brother Wayne, I know the word." And brother Brandham says, "Yep, Satan does, too. &gt;&gt; And Satan argued scripture with Jesus himself in Matthew the 4th chapter." &gt;&gt; He argued scripture with Jesus. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK PIECES OF THE PUZZLE. AMEN. In the book of Psalms and quoted them back TO JESUS AND TRIED TO GET THE DISLOCATION of the word by his interpreting like he did to Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "Satan knows scriptures, too." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But he don't know how to rightly divide them. &gt;&gt; That's pretty awesome, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Now, when Jesus heard the wrong the scriptures being preached wrong, when Jesus heard that, now Jesus didn't disagree with David because David said, "The angel shall bear thee up." You don't catch Jesus looking at the devil because the devil's putting the word on him. David was just wrong. You know that that that quote's wrong. That it's just &gt;&gt; he he didn't [clears throat] disallow what Satan was saying. &gt;&gt; He just showed him it was put in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; He didn't say it wasn't a puzzle piece or it didn't belong or that this is not good. HE JUST SHOWED HIM YOU'RE MISAPPLYING IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND AND he didn't know how TO PUT IT TOGETHER. WATCH the scripture. 2 Timothy 3 and verse 16. I love this scripture and and it gets more brilliant to me w with every sermon or with every day I live ON THE EARTH. ALL SCRIPTURE, &gt;&gt; SAY IT WITH ME. ALL SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; IS GIVEN by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reprove, for correction, FOR INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOT SOME OF THE SCRIPTURE, ALL THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; My when you think about IT LIKE THAT, ALL THE SCRIPTURE is the truth. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; BUT WATCH IN 2 Timothy 2 and 15, Paul instructing a YOUNG MAN AS HE'S going to go into the world and preach THE GOSPEL. AND HE SAID, "STUDY TO show thyself approved of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A workman, &gt;&gt; he needeth not to be shamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. Now look at Paul telling Timothy, Timothy, not every word that you read is in season. NOT EVERY WORD, IT'S ALL GOOD FOR DOCTRINE. It's all true, but you have to divide it in the put it in the right places. &gt;&gt; It has to be rightly divided. See, a workman, and I don't have time to preach this, but I I'll just let it let it put in your mind here. Amen. A workman, brother Bram says it. the a workman. See, a workman has to know what day of the week it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said you can't do this is a future home. He says you can't do uh uh Tuesday's work. Can't be done on Wednesday. And he said Wednesdays can't be done on uh uh uh uh it's got to be done on Wednesday and Saturdays has to be Saturday's work. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; What the world? Hey man, what he's telling you is this is not Saturday. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. This is Sunday. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE WEEK. THIS IS THE FIRST DAY AGAIN. AND BROTHER BAM IS TELLING YOU RIGHT HERE. HE'S SAYING A WORKMAN MUST RIGHTLY divide and know what day he's WORKING ON. THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER PENTECOSTAL AGE. THIS IS THE AGE OF THE BRIDE. IT'S IT'S WHEN GOD IS BRINGING THE RESURRECTION OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; NOW, watch what he's doing. He's saying it's not Saturday. It's Sunday. If you like to see that in the rising of the sun, brother Bram says it very clearly. He said, "This is the sheath to be waved and the Sabbath, the seventh day, but on the first day called Sunday." Of course, that's a Roman word how it's changed. But it's not su n anymore. It's s y it's Sunday that the corn, God's first one is up, waved over the congregation. See, the first seed of those that slept has been waved. Amen. Now, you you say, "Preacher, what the world are you talking about?" I'm talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In its season, the work that is to be done, God is working in this season. And this is a predestinated season. &gt;&gt; And God can only reveal the word in its season. &gt;&gt; Do you see? Uh right now we're coming into August and you know uh we're coming in very very strongly right here to August. But you know, Amen. It ain't going to be long and it's going to be December. &gt;&gt; See, but you see so you wouldn't start, Amen, a May crop in the middle of August cuz it's the wrong season. &gt;&gt; It's just like somebody go out and plant seed in February and get mad at the seed company cuz they don't GET A CROP. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU YOU CAN'T get mad at the Lord that you don't get what you want when you don't plant according to the season. You can't take the word of the wrong age and then expect to get the same thing you would if you operated according to the season. Now, amen. There's a there's a lot in this and I I'm going to continue here to just in the scripture in Matthew 24. Watch the 45th and 46th verse where Jesus said, "What is the faithful and wise servant? He see the Lord made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so the message there, there's a season for the word of God, &gt;&gt; and the word has to come into that season. And brother Bandam talks to us about spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Now, we're we're we're discussing Hebrews 1 and two. Don't don't lose where we are. We're discussing Hebrews and we're discussing Paul saying that God in various times and various ways, HE'S DEALT WITH PEOPLE, BUT IN THE LAST DAYS, he'll speak through his son. So he's telling you there is dispensations. How many believes in dispensations? &gt;&gt; Sure. Brother Ba says in questions and answers he said now you people that don't believe in gentile dis and dispensations. What about that? See Jesus said Jerusalem would be trod down until the times of the Gentiles. Uh Luke 21:24. Jesus using until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So there's a gentile age and there's a Jewish age. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Dispensations. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter one, we find out that the Bible said that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, &gt;&gt; kind of like I was talking to a guy one time on a job and I was I was running a doer and he was out there with me and we got to talking one day and he was a he was a Pentecostal fellow, good guy. He says to me, we got to talking, I said something about predestination. He said, "I don't believe that." I said, "You don't believe in that?" He said, "No, I don't believe in that." I said, "You got a you got a Bible?" He carried a New Testament right in his front pocket all the time. &gt;&gt; So, he pulled that New Testament out out there on the road job, you know, rough rough neck bunch of guys. And this guy's got a Bible. He pulls out his Bible. I said, "Turn to Ephesians chapter 1." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he began to read and when he got down about, I think it's the fifth verse, isn't it? And therefore, being predestinated under the adoption, he said, "Oh my goodness." [laughter] I SAID, "TURN THAT Bible right over to Romans the 8th chapter and let's go down there around the 25th to the 29th verse and let's read that." And he got to reading there in two places just in a moment. I showed him with the word predestination was in the Bible. And I said, "You don't believe in predestination?" He said, "Well, I do now." He said, "I just read IT RIGHT OUT OF THE BIBLE." [laughter] I said, "Yeah." You see, people say they don't believe in dispensations. Well, they just never read the Bible &gt;&gt; because the Bible is clear in saying like 2 Timothy 2, it says rightly dividing the word of truth. 1 Corinthians 9:17, the Bible says, "For this the thing willfully I have reward, but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me." &gt;&gt; Watch Ephesians 3 and2. If you heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me, you were. So God gave Paul something for the people and that was the dispensation. And Colossians 1:25, WHEREFORE I AM MADE A MINISTER ACCORDING TO THE dispensation of God WHICH IS GIVEN TO me for you. &gt;&gt; Do you SEE DISPENSATION? IT ACTUALLY means a stewardship. It means a management of a household or household affairs. a property, a manager, overseer, an administrator. It's a dispensation. In other words, IT'S THAT GOD IS GIVING SOMETHING to you at a certain time and he's dispensing it through this area. Of course, Paul, amen, is showing them the dispensation that's given him is is not the dispensation of law and prophets. He's saying, "I have the gospel of God." Amen. THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST HAS COME TO ME AND I KNOW NOTHING but Jesus buried and resurrected and I KNOW HIM IN THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; Look at look at this. LOOK AT THE REALITY OF HIS DISPENSATIONAL TEACHING. NOW, IF YOU'RE a dispensation, Amen. It's pretty pretty good study. The biggest and most obvious dispensations are the Old Testament, New Testament. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; That's the biggest and the most obvious that you could see. Uh you could you can take it all the way back into the undeliv world and you can see in the book of Peter the Bible said and they perished. The old world perished but man used the future home right and he says it didn't it didn't annihilate. He said it ended and he called the world a cosmos. &gt;&gt; See then there is ends of worlds. The book of Isaiah look unto me all ye ends of the earth. Brother said see there's been many ends. It's just like it ended. It perished in the days of Noah. But what happened at that change of dispensation? God sent a prophet among them. &gt;&gt; And when it changed, AND THE BIBLE GOES ON TO SAY IN PETER, and he said, "YOU'RE WILLFULLY IGNORANT THAT THE WATERS WOULD OVERFLOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE saying that things continue as they were from our fathers." Y'all know the scripture &gt;&gt; that that he say that THAT PETER IS SAYING to them, scoffers will come in the last day and say, "Where is the promise of his coming?" AND THEY'LL SAY, "THINGS CONTINUE AS THEY WERE FROM THE OLD." He said, "You're willfully ignorant." &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING the whole world was destroyed in the days of Noah and it perished in the floods. And he was TELLING THEM RIGHT THERE, THERE WAS A dispensation of Noah and he had to get on an ark. But listen, if you preach build AN ARK TODAY, HOW SILLY WOULD THAT SOUND? &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS EXACTLY true and salvational AT ITS TIME. &gt;&gt; JUST AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF MOSES WHEN HE WAS TELLING THEM, "PUT BLOOD OVER THEIR DOOR." AMEN. TRY THAT FOR SALVATION TODAY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SALVATION under the blood over a door. &gt;&gt; It's it's dispensational. It was for that moment AND FOR THAT TIME AND SO IS IT with Abraham and Moses. Amen. And there were ends of them. So was IT WITH JOHN. AMEN. BUT THERE WAS AN end to that. Amen. We look at that today and see that we are living in a dispensation. Amen. Of of of God that has been given to this age. a dense dispensation that we call the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Huh? &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you're studying the godhead and you you have the father and you have the son and you have the holy ghost, there's dispensations for each, right? &gt;&gt; Fatherhood, the pillar of fire was above us. And all those years he dwelt above us. But then we see the son Emmanuel come to the earth and God dwelt with us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. AMEN. BUT THE FULLNESS OF BOTH of those offices came when Melazdc matured himself and made himself known in those offices. &gt;&gt; So it WASN'T SEE IT WASN'T JUST THE OFFICE OF FATHERHOOD BUT WATCH GOD BROUGHT THAT OFFICE to completion BY IDENTIFYING AMEN WHO IT WAS. IT WAS GOD that talked to Abraham &gt;&gt; and brought a fullness of that office in so much that Jesus standing looked back in that dispensation and he said there's coming another day like it when it was when everything is set like it was then. He said I'm going to revisit the earth like that in that generation. AMEN. AND WATCH WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S pointing to a DISPENSATION THAT HE WILL MANIFEST LIKE HE DID THEN. BUT IT WON'T BE UNDER FATHERHOOD. &gt;&gt; God above us. It won't be Emmanuel, GOD WITH US. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS TIME THE MANIFESTATION WOULD BE GOD IN US &gt;&gt; SHOWING US that there are three dispensations of the fatherhood, son, and the Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost is not FULL UNDER A BAPTISM. &gt;&gt; LOOK, AMEN. I know the Holy Ghost fell back there in 1906 and the rain fell and and the and the and THE HUS FORMED UPON THE SEED. THERE WAS A BAPTISM AND THERE'S REFORMATION OF GIFTS and there's a zoo and there's development OF ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. BUT GOD WASN'T FINISHED RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T THE FINISHING OF IT BECAUSE THAT WAS UNDER THE DISPENSATION OF THE SON of God in a HOLY GHOST AGE. BUT THERE WAS COMING THE MANIFESTATION OF A SON OF MAN. IN OTHER WORDS, THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD HAVE TO MANIFEST THAT SAME ELOHIM. THAT SAME MAZDC WOULD HAVE TO come and manifest himself in the last day. I hope it ain't over your head. &gt;&gt; THEN SOMEBODY SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, IT'S GOT TO COME AND MANIFEST ITSELF THE SAME TODAY AS IT DID BACK THEN BECAUSE IT IS A DISPENSATION OF THE FULLNESS OF GOD IN THE AGE OF the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; My goodness, when I THINK ABOUT THAT, SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, Brother Wayne, we don't have to know these things." Brother Bam said, "YOU MUST KNOW HOW to approach God. Right. &gt;&gt; For healing and salvation, &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO APPROACH GOD. YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW. Come on now. Anointing is not just emotion, folks. &gt;&gt; COME ON. AMEN. BROTHER SAID, "WHAT is emotion?" He said, "Supreme power under control. KNOWING THE HOW and the why." &gt;&gt; KNOWING THE HOW AND THE WHY. HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW OR WHY? IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE AGE AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE INSPIRATION AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S SPEAKING. OH, BUT IF YOU EVER GET THE ANOINTING OF GOD, YOU KNOW HOW AND YOU KNOW WHY AND YOU KNOW RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING. &gt;&gt; My goodness, you must know what you're doing and how to do it. &gt;&gt; In Acts CHAPTER 10, WATCH APOSTLE PETER. HE WENT DOWN to the house of Cornelius. And when he comes to the house of Cornelius, listen folks, Peter is a Jew, &gt;&gt; he's on a housetop and dispensations have changed and he's aware to some of the change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he is not aware that God has made such a change. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, now think about this because if you go to your Bible, now this could get a little sticky here to some of the vegetarians. But there was a time that you were vegetarian by God's word. How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Any vegetarian knows it because they've tried to use the scripture on some meditarian. [laughter] That's me. Meditarian. &gt;&gt; That's not proper English, is it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said God, [laughter] we understand it though. But brother the Bible said God gave them herb to eat &gt;&gt; right in in the garden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But after the fall of the garden &gt;&gt; right then then they were expression they could have things &gt;&gt; but then when it come to Noah's day &gt;&gt; after the flood God said to them specifically you can eat anything out here. &gt;&gt; And then meat began to come in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, there's them places in the Bible, you know, like when God came in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abraham fed him calf. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to be real careful with your doctrines. [laughter] &gt;&gt; He isn't that veil. Ain't that what that is? He He soaked ve and milk, &gt;&gt; fed it. One time, Ronnie Molo, man, he put it on one of them one of them guys over there in in Israel. man, they were they were holding to that law and the the the milk and the the cow and the mother. It's a law. It's and it is God's law. But but brother brother Ronnie said to him, he said, you know, he said, "Y'all's holding that pretty tight." He said, "But what what about Melazdc when he came and they gave him milk and calf at the same time." [laughter] Man, that wasn't funny. He he didn't like that at all. [laughter] But you know, see, so whenever the law came, what they was divided, then we got what we call kosher, right? That's why the Jews, if you ever eat in Israel or around someone that's Jewish, they bleed everything a certain way. And it it's called kosher. It's kosher. The the pans had to be a certain way. This had to be a certain way. And you know, the man that can't eat bacon and everything. What a terrible life. [laughter] That's just horrible, man. No bacon. That was where that was where Peter was sitting, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When the angel come to him &gt;&gt; and he seen a vision of them unclean foods &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "LORD, I AIN'T EAT NOTHING UNCLEAN." &gt;&gt; And God rebuked him and said, "Don't you call unclean &gt;&gt; that what I've cleansed." Now God was speaking of the Gentiles &gt;&gt; because the dispensation had changed and EVEN THE FOOD THAT they were eating HAD BECOME SO DIFFERENT NOW that even Paul BEGAN TO SAY LATER, AMEN, THAT THAT ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL. Not all things are expedient unto you, but all things are lawful. SO HE WAS TELLING THEM, DON'T YOU SET YOURSELF UP THINKING, WELL, I don't eat this meat, so I'm better than this guy, and I don't eat this meat. But then he turned around and said, if eating meat offends your brother, THEN DON'T EAT THE MEAT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. SO WHAT HE'S DOING IS IS HE'S SHOWING YOU IT WAS SUCH A CHANGE IN DISPENSATION, BUT YET PETER HAD NO REVELATION OF IT. BUT ALL THE SUDDEN ON A HOUSETOP HERE COMES AN ANGEL AND PETER CATCHES THE REVELATION. AMEN. THE GENTILES are accepted. Them pig eating Gentiles. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEM THEM THEM IDLE PACKING PIG EATING GENTILES THAT SERVE ALL THOSE GODS. THERE IS A DISPENSATION OF THE GRACE OF GOD THAT JUST BY ME GOING DOWN TO THEIR HOUSE, GLORY BE TO GOD, AND BEGAN TO SPEAK THESE WORDS. THE BIBLE SAID HE SPAKE THESE WORDS. THERE WERE WORDS THAT WERE BEING SPOKEN OVER THEM THAT THEY RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST WHILE HE YET SPAKE BECAUSE GOD WAS DISPENSING GRACE UNTO THE GENTILES BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. OH, THAT APOSTOLIC DOCTRINE OF THE PREACHING OF JESUS CHRIST UNDER THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. LISTEN TO ME SAY THIS. WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT DISPENSATION, BUT THAT APOSTOLIC GOSPEL HAS NEVER CHANGED AND IT'LL NEVER CHANGE. BUT MAN SAID, "IT'S AN ETERNAL PRESCRIPTION UNTO THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD." OH, I LOVE HOW HE SAID IT. THEY SAID TO THEM, "BRETHREN, WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE SAVED?" AND OH, APOSTLE PETER PUT IT IN THE BOOK OF ACTS AND SAID, "REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST." AND THIS IS UNTO YOU JEWS, &gt;&gt; AND TO YOUR CHILDREN JEWS, AND AS TO MANY THAT ARE AS A FAR OFF, EVEN AS MANY GOD SHALL CALL. AND THAT'S YOU, GENTILES. AS LONG AS GOD IS CALLING, HE'S STILL GIVEN THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. WE'RE IN A DISPENSATION OF THE SON OF MAN. BUT THE WORD HAS NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT CONCERNING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO THE CHURCH. LISTEN, YOU CAN'T GET IN HEAVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm going to say Holy Ghost. I'm not ashamed of Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And people have said Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; cuz they're ashamed of them Pentecostal tongue talking word children. Brother Bam SAID ACTS 2:38 TONGUE- TALKING BABIES. LISTEN. AMEN. TONGUE TALKING, HOLY GHOST FILING SHOUTING. AMEN. THE POWER OF GOD MANIFESTING. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, BROTHER WAYNE, EMOTION'S NOT JUST A ANOINTING." I ALREADY TOLD YOU I KNOW that one. I KNOW IT'S NOT. BUT I HAVE THE ANOINTING. I KNOW THE HOW. I KNOW THE WHY. I KNOW THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. SO I KNOW I CAN SHOUT JUST LIKE JOB SHOUTING BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE I WAS BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. IF SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU AND SAYS, "GOD, DON'T GIVE THE HOLY GHOST LIKE HE DID ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST." THEY ARE A LIAR AND OUGHT TO BE THROWN OUT OF THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD AS A &gt;&gt; AS A SERPENT OF OF SATAN HIMSELF. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GET TO HEAVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU CAN'T GET TO HEAVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. AND UNLESS GOD GIVES THE HOLY GHOST, YOU'LL GO IN THE TRIBULATION. SO ANY PREACHER SAYING WE DON'T NEED THE HOLY GHOST. HE IS A TRIBULATION MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; So Brother Wayne, that's Pentecostal. No, that's that's the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that's awful strong language." It's brother Brandham's language. &gt;&gt; Anything contrary to what he preached, he said it is the seed of discrepancy. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; brother. That's what he called it in the Bible. Amen. That's what you got to call it today, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The idea that God has changed because dispensations have changed. Do you see how wrong that thought is? &gt;&gt; Paul's whole concept is that God, the same God &gt;&gt; that was with the law and the prophets &gt;&gt; has advanced his grace &gt;&gt; into these Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; 120 of them received the Holy Ghost, which was the dividing of that great logos. &gt;&gt; The very God of heaven came into them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And days later, Peter went down to Cornelius's house and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ. And the Bible said, "And they received the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And they spake with tongues like they did at the beginning. And then THEY WERE BAPTIZED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET BAPTIZED AFTER THEY GOT THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Good stuff. You said, "Preacher, what are you talking about?" Dispensations. &gt;&gt; God ain't changed nothing, young people. I want to tell you something right now. The experience that he gave Ray Ericson and he gave Wayne Lawson, the experience that he gave these elders in this church, he'll give you the same experience today. &gt;&gt; You do not have to think, well, we've come in the son of man. We we've come to this great intellectual age, and now God ain't doing these things no more. LISTEN, I'D RATHER HAVE THE POWER OF THIS GOSPEL THAN TO BE ABLE TO READ. I don't CARE IF I PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER. I WANT TO SEE GOD COME DOWN IN THE CHURCH AND FILL HEARTS AND LIVES. AMEN. AND AND AND CLENCH LIES WITH HIS POWER. LISTEN, FOLKS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAVEN TO READ QUOTES. WE'RE GOING TO HEAVEN TO WORSHIP A GOD, THE REAL JESUS CHRIST. AND WE'RE GOING TO WORSHIP HIM IN POWER AND IN DEMONSTRATION. WORSHIPING GOD BECAUSE HE IS GOD. THIS IS THIS IS DISPENSATIONAL. &gt;&gt; I know we're out of time. That's good. &gt;&gt; Do do you see he didn't change his power? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Change it. &gt;&gt; The one of the greatest sections of scripture that that that proves this to me. Well, Jonathan, when our Lord Jesus was on the earth, the Bible introduces him as the as the son of Abraham, the son of David, the son of God, the son of man. He was all those, &gt;&gt; wasn't he? &gt;&gt; According to scripture. And he's walking one day and blind Barameus wants something from him and he cries, "Thou son of David, have mercy." And the man found mercy for the healing of his eyes. &gt;&gt; That same Jesus was walking and a young woman comes and the Bible said that she was a Sarapheneician &gt;&gt; gentile. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us that Jesus had went there to hide. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now that's something, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He had went there to hide. But do you know what my Bible says? &gt;&gt; He couldn't be hid from her. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be hid from her. You talking I'm talking about Gentiles. Yeah. A little while the world seeth no more, but you see me, for I will be with you, even in you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, I remember I I remember speaking to brother Tim Puit one time and I I actually hit that point right there and that Mariah Puit's mother was sitting in the congregation and brought Mariah up for prayer when that alipcia was on her so bad and she come up and said, "Brother Wayne, I certainly believe I'm the woman that you just talked about &gt;&gt; that I need God for my baby." &gt;&gt; Do you do you see she couldn't be hid? And when that Sarapheneician woman when Jesus comes to speak to her, she's trying to get his attention and she calls him thou son of David. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And all that power and everything, he never even the Bible said he opened not his mouth. He didn't speak one word to her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. That's right. And brother Brandon said, "See, it's because she had no claim to him at all under thou son of David." &gt;&gt; It would be no different in this case. It wouldn't be any different than a man's daughter coming to him and saying, "Thou husband." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, you my daughters can get they can get things from their dad, &gt;&gt; but not as my wife. The dispensation was that he was her Lord. He was the son of man. &gt;&gt; And when she changed her when she changed when she changed, &gt;&gt; she found the every bit of the power &gt;&gt; that he had showed to them Israelites and them Jews was that was still there, &gt;&gt; but it had to be approached &gt;&gt; in the right way. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says, "Do you see that?" That's what happened with Hattie. Wright. &gt;&gt; He says, "You have to know these words." Look at Hattie that time, that third pull. You remember it? You remember that? Everything that woman said the right thing. &gt;&gt; You've got to say the right thing to God. &gt;&gt; Do you see that tonight? It's a dispensation. It's not that he changed. It's the approach to him. &gt;&gt; Right? If our musicians could come tonight, it's not that he changes. &gt;&gt; I I'm not even close to &gt;&gt; It's not that he It's not that he changes, it's our approach to him. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; If you approach God in this age, you will have to do it through the message. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not because you got to come to William Brandom. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's because the message is the fulfillment of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter what his name was. Wouldn't matter what brother Bram's name was. That that that that is the &gt;&gt; that's not the important thing. &gt;&gt; It was the vessel. He chose a vessel. &gt;&gt; And he manifested what he said. He said Luke 17:30 that he would return as the son of man. And he did it. And he said that Elijah would come and he did it. &gt;&gt; And he said that the evening time and he did it. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And notice what he said this day, this scripture. So he's showing you the seasons. And when you catch that season, listen, I want to tell you this. When you catch the season of the son of man, you won't have to guess if that Holy Spirit does the same thing in the church that it did on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you will find a power. You'll find the grace of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You'll find that anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's uh you know it it's it's in a sometimes in a very strong way I guess that you know that you say things but when you catch the reality of what you're really talking about. &gt;&gt; One time brother Brandham has got a a questions and answers and a man a man asked brother Brandham. They said, "Brother Bam, you were preaching the other day and you said that a man can live so far above sin &gt;&gt; that the devil wouldn't know what to do with it." Y'all remember that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "But brother Brandham," he said, "I got a little problem. You saying a man don't have sin because a Christian don't have sin." Brother Brandham said it. And that guy had a problem. And brother Brandham said, "You're reading it out of first John." &gt;&gt; He said, "But if you would just read over a couple more chapters, &gt;&gt; page," &gt;&gt; he said, "you'd see the next page." He said, "You would see that John 3 says that he that is born of God doeth not commit sin." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he says, "See, brother, what it's like." He said, "See, you can't disbelieve." He said, "See, he that's born of God." He said, "Now, you take a man, no matter how religious he is," he said, "but maybe he don't believe that the Holy Ghost falls the same today as it did on the day of Pentecost." He said, "See, he's he don't even believe God." &gt;&gt; See, see you you when when you think that God has changed in a way that he can't do it because he changed dispensations. But oh, if you stay in that dispensation, if it's the dispensation of the son of man, and it is, and it's the dispensation of a prophetic word interpreting the scripture, then if you want to know how God acts, go right in the message. &gt;&gt; Go right in the message and ask, "What does God do in the generation I'm living in?" And you'll find out he raised the dead. &gt;&gt; You'll find he heals the sick. &gt;&gt; You'll find that he knows your name. He knows your situations. He knows because he remains to be a living God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad tonight to know, aren't you? Won't you stand to your feet with us? He remains to be a living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This this this apostolic age, it has [clears throat] never ceased. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brian, you got something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I look back on history, see [singing] the mighty God unveiled. [music] He's proving [singing] over and over that his word can never [music] fail. [singing] But I can't keep [music] on dwelling on some past [singing] memorories. [music] Cuz he's the same God [singing] [music] who's living in me. [singing] [music] Oh, the same God who spoke to the woman at [music] the well. [singing] The same [music] God whose wonders are too many to tell. The same God [singing] who parted the raging red. [music] [singing] He's the [music] same God [singing] who's living in me. The same God who created all the heavens [music and singing] and all the earth. He came [singing] back living in Jesus. There was [singing] power in his word. But now in these [singing] last days, I'm beginning to [singing] see. It's the [music and singing] same God who's living in me. [music] Oh, the same [singing] God. Oh, human beings wave your hands. [music and singing] He sp the web. The same God [music] whose wonders [singing] are too many to tell. [singing] The same God who pardoned [singing and music] the raing sea. [singing] [music] He's the same God [music] who's living in &gt;&gt; [music]
