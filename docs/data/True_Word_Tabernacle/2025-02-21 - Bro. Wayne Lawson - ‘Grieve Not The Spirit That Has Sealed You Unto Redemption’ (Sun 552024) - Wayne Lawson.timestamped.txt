[8:44] certainly make them welcome this morning
[8:46] our brother Nate Moore is with us I know
[8:48] I know brother Ben's already made him
[8:50] welcome but I just want to say God bless
[8:52] you welcome in the congregation this
[8:54] morning we pray the Lord would greatly
[8:56] bless you and I pray that as you have
[8:59] stepped forth in here that you would
[9:01] feel the welcomeness of the Holy Spirit
[9:04] and of our hearts and and you're just so
[9:06] welcome to be here and I pray the Holy
[9:09] Ghost would just come down this morning
[9:11] and he would speak so personally to
[9:13] every person in this building and we
[9:15] could leave this morning and say did not
[9:17] our hearts burn within us as we amen
[9:20] went along the way amen it's certainly
[9:22] good to have all of our visitors today
[9:24] and amen and so we just want to take a
[9:27] few minutes in the word but just before
[9:29] we go I'd like to just have a word of
[9:31] prayer before we approach this word and
[9:34] just a little something maybe if on your
[9:37] heart this morning there's maybe a
[9:38] special need or something you've come to
[9:40] the house of God with I just pray that
[9:42] God would just move so miraculously and
[9:45] I'm going to ask you to do something
[9:46] with me this morning maybe you just
[9:47] might reach over and lay your hand on
[9:49] someone today and I'm going to ask you
[9:52] that you would pray that God would touch
[9:53] that person next to you that the
[9:56] anointing of the Holy Spirit would speak
[9:58] to them father as we come together it is
[10:01] written in the Book of Mark the 16th
[10:03] chapter that in my name they should lay
[10:06] hands upon the sick now father some are
[10:08] not sick this morning some are weary
[10:11] some are afflicted with different things
[10:13] in their lives and many needs and
[10:15] answers and questions that are needed
[10:18] but almighty God we know that you are
[10:20] the answer to every situation and just
[10:23] by one move of your spirit Lord you
[10:26] answer questions you change
[10:28] circumstances you save lives Lord
[10:31] healings take place in just one breath
[10:34] of your anointing and we ask you this
[10:36] morning as a congregation we come
[10:38] together today and we ask you that the
[10:41] Holy Spirit Lord would take a
[10:42] preeminence in this building father I
[10:45] claim every inch of this room for your
[10:48] glory I pray every heart and every life
[10:52] Lord would be so filled with the fibers
[10:54] of almighty God that there would be no
[10:57] place for the devil there'd be no room
[10:59] for unbelief or doubt or confusion but
[11:02] may your great Holy Spirit take complete
[11:04] control of this meeting this morning
[11:07] Father now we welcome you today we ask
[11:10] you to anoint touch and bless these
[11:12] people of God help the speaker Lord as
[11:14] we would speak your word may you make it
[11:17] Lord the word of life we ask you for
[11:20] these things in the mighty name of Jesus
[11:22] Christ we pray amen and amen and God
[11:26] bless you this morning as you have your
[11:28] Bibles I want to look in the book of
[11:30] Ephesians the 4th chapter the 27th to
[11:33] the 32nd verse now uh you that are
[11:36] visiting this morning you've come in the
[11:37] middle of a of an Ephesian series but we
[11:40] kind of have been speaking on them uh in
[11:42] context so uh each sermon kind of would
[11:45] stand by itself so if I refer back to
[11:47] something you forgive me some of the
[11:49] people around you'll kind of know what
[11:51] I'm talking about but we've been in the
[11:52] book of Ephesians for a while and um so
[11:55] that you kind of understand our thought
[11:57] is the book of Ephesians is is a New
[11:59] Testament of uh the Book of Joshua of
[12:02] the Old Testament so when Moses uh
[12:04] brought the children of out and then
[12:06] Joshua took them in the land and then we
[12:09] see that when the Holy Ghost fell in the
[12:10] New Testament Paul in the book of
[12:12] Ephesians placed the New Testament
[12:14] Believers in the promises uh that he had
[12:17] got so I I want to just read from here
[12:20] this morning the book of Ephesians we're
[12:21] going to read uh in the 4th chapter 27th
[12:24] verse and I going read down to the 32nd
[12:27] now neither give place to the devil we
[12:30] just spoke Thursday night on this
[12:32] neither give place to the devil see he
[12:35] don't have a place unless you give him
[12:37] one and so don't give a place to the
[12:39] devil now we're talking to real
[12:40] Believers and Christians don't give no
[12:42] place to the devil let him that steal
[12:45] stole steal no more but rather let him
[12:47] labor working with his hands the things
[12:50] which is good that he may have to give
[12:52] to him that needeth and let no corrupt
[12:55] uh communication proceed from your mouth
[12:58] but that which is good to use of the
[13:01] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[13:03] the hearer and grieve not the holy
[13:07] spirit of
[13:09] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[13:13] of redemption now let all bitterness and
[13:16] all wrath now he's going to list some
[13:18] things that Grieves the spirit of God
[13:21] let all bitterness how many knows
[13:22] brother B said the bitterness will eat
[13:24] Christ right out of your life now let
[13:26] all bitterness and all wrath and all all
[13:29] anger and all clamor and all evil
[13:31] speaking be put away from you these are
[13:34] things that grieve God now with all
[13:37] malice now you be kind one to the other
[13:40] and tenderhearted forgiving one another
[13:43] even as God for Christ's sake ha
[13:46] forgiven you we ask the Lord to bless
[13:49] his word as you could be seated this
[13:50] morning and I want to speak to you if I
[13:52] took it a context this morning for a a
[13:54] title to kind of get our minds in this
[13:57] place is grieve not the spirit of of God
[14:00] that ha sealed you unto
[14:02] Redemption now when I uh look at this
[14:05] here I'm going to read from the 30th
[14:07] verse again grieve not the holy spirit
[14:10] of God whereby you are sealed unto the
[14:13] day of redemption now amen when we say
[14:16] the holy spirit of God now that's not a
[14:18] different uh that's not a different one
[14:20] than the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost
[14:22] the holy spirit it's the same thing
[14:25] you're just saying it a little different
[14:26] amen but the holy spirit of God now the
[14:29] first thing I I think is that sometimes
[14:32] we've got to maybe Define what we
[14:34] believe that the Holy Ghost is and I
[14:37] think that's a good place Amen to to
[14:39] begin any conversation if you're going
[14:41] to talk about something I believe that
[14:43] you have to uh decide what we're talking
[14:45] about and and the scripture tells us
[14:48] this amen that in the in the uh grieve
[14:50] not the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost
[14:52] brother Ram will say this and what is
[14:54] the Holy Ghost he says now if we wish to
[14:56] approach the subject I think it's an
[14:58] outst standing subject he said of what
[15:01] is the holy spirit so there's an entire
[15:03] sermon preached what is the Holy Ghost
[15:05] he says and now the reason I have taken
[15:08] the subject in line is you cannot come
[15:10] and receive the Holy Spirit unless you
[15:13] know what it
[15:14] is and you cannot receive it if you and
[15:18] you cannot receive it see if you know
[15:20] what it is unless you believe it's given
[15:23] to you and is for you so you can know
[15:26] what it is but you don't believe that
[15:28] it's possible for you to get it and it's
[15:29] not for you then you still don't get it
[15:32] amen but you cannot know whether you got
[15:34] it or not unless you know the results it
[15:36] brings so then after you get it you got
[15:38] to know what kind of results it brings
[15:40] in your life so other one what is it and
[15:42] number two is it for me and is it
[15:44] available today and then what kind of
[15:46] results would it bring in our lives so
[15:49] the Holy Ghost amen amen the prophet was
[15:51] teaching us amen that number one what is
[15:54] it now number one the Holy Ghost is a
[15:57] person all right now the Holy Ghost is
[16:00] not a emotion and the Holy Ghost is not
[16:03] a Theology and it's not a Doctrine it's
[16:06] actually a person amen amen our lord
[16:09] Jesus said in John 14 that the father
[16:11] would not leave us comfortless but he
[16:13] would send a comforter under us such and
[16:15] you made you think that it was somebody
[16:17] else amen but then he said yet a little
[16:19] while the world seeth me no more but she
[16:22] will see me for I will be with you even
[16:25] in you amen Until the End of the Age so
[16:27] that Holy Ghost is is the spirit of
[16:30] Jesus Christ in the church it is the
[16:33] comforter the Assurance it's the Seal of
[16:36] God Amen it is the promise that has been
[16:38] given to you in Luke chap 24 and: 49
[16:42] Jesus told him to go be indued with the
[16:44] power on high right and that you might
[16:46] receive the promise of My Father which
[16:49] is none other than Isaiah the 28th
[16:52] chapter amen that there would be a rest
[16:54] that would come to the church a
[16:55] refreshing so Isaiah 28 promised it
[16:59] Jesus uses Isaiah to tell his disciples
[17:02] that now the time has come that the Holy
[17:05] Ghost would be poured out amen and it
[17:07] would be the spirit of Promise according
[17:09] to Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 13 have
[17:12] you received the spirit amen amen after
[17:15] that you've heard the word of Truth have
[17:17] you received the spirit now that's a big
[17:19] thing there because of course there are
[17:21] many uh uh many teachings in this last
[17:23] uh generation amen that the Holy Ghost
[17:26] just not available anymore amen and it's
[17:28] not like an experience that you receive
[17:30] or it's not like a a real kind of
[17:33] accepting of the Holy Ghost it's more
[17:34] like I just believe it and I lift my
[17:36] hand or I shake some preacher's hand or
[17:39] I go to a certain church and that is the
[17:41] Holy Ghost well let me let me just say
[17:42] very clearly that is not the Holy Ghost
[17:45] amen I I don't care what kind of
[17:47] preacher you got there's not a preacher
[17:49] in this world can shake your hand and
[17:51] change your Eternal destination there
[17:54] ain't no preacher in this universe that
[17:56] can shake your hand and change your
[17:58] Eternal destination come on there ain't
[18:01] a church in the world that you could put
[18:03] your name on and it decide whether you
[18:06] go to heaven or hell amen it takes a
[18:09] definite experience with the baptism of
[18:12] the Holy Ghost a god that is alive and
[18:15] real we don't serve amen a dead Idol
[18:17] somewhere we are not a bunch of Buddhist
[18:20] or Hindus and have to pray to some Idol
[18:23] somewhere they can't talk back but the
[18:25] god that we serve the Bible said on the
[18:28] third day he rose up from the dead and
[18:30] our lord Jesus is just alive this
[18:33] morning as he was 2,000 years ago and he
[18:37] is available to every believer to every
[18:39] person in this building to every young
[18:42] person to every old person I don't care
[18:44] your race I don't care your Society I
[18:47] don't care your education it does not
[18:49] matter to God Amen if a man can believe
[18:53] God he can receive of the Holy Ghost is
[18:57] that right amen now somebody said well
[19:01] brother Wayne Amen I tell you what I
[19:02] believed I had it amen I confessed I had
[19:05] it well listen let me tell you you can
[19:06] get a confirmation from God that you
[19:09] have it and if you don't know you can
[19:11] reconfirm that to be sure because it
[19:14] would be better to be sure than to not
[19:17] know somebody said well I don't know
[19:19] that you could know well Jesus said you
[19:21] could he said in that day now there
[19:23] might be a day you didn't know but in
[19:26] that day ye shall know that I am the the
[19:28] Father the father me and I and you we
[19:30] have come to an age of knowing and God
[19:33] wants you to know he don't want you
[19:35] guessing or wondering or maybe I could
[19:37] have it maybe I don't have it there is a
[19:40] definite experience with God that you
[19:43] can know you've been saved Sanctified
[19:46] and filled with the Holy
[19:49] Ghost Hallelujah I think it's time amen
[19:51] just to have a little church this
[19:53] morning didn't it amen Blessed Be to the
[19:55] Lord what a time to love the Lord now
[19:58] somebody said well brother Wayne heyen
[20:00] what about that Holy Ghost brother BR
[20:01] tells us and what's the holy ghost that
[20:03] there is a vast
[20:05] difference between a Christian and a
[20:07] Holy Ghost Field Christian now there's a
[20:10] real difference between a Christian and
[20:12] a Holy Ghost Field Christian now that is
[20:15] a real difference and if you go back
[20:17] Amen to the Token message you'll find
[20:18] out in the one in Dallas brother bamos
[20:20] say it like this you see that in the
[20:22] Exodus back there when the Israel was
[20:25] leaving Egypt he said which is a type
[20:28] today of the Bride coming out of the
[20:30] church he said listen there was a
[20:32] difference between Israel and the rest
[20:34] of them Nations and that was God Amen he
[20:37] put to one side Israel was like any
[20:39] other nation and when Samson cut off his
[20:41] hair he was just like any other man now
[20:44] put leadership of the Holy Ghost aside
[20:47] and the church is nothing but the world
[20:49] with God's name attached to it the world
[20:51] and the church are the same lump just
[20:54] like Jacob and Esau were the same
[20:56] parents but the spirit of God makes the
[21:00] difference amen it don't make the
[21:02] difference of what church you go to it
[21:04] makes the difference whether you got the
[21:05] holy ghost or not amen you can go to the
[21:08] best church and not have the Holy Ghost
[21:10] you can amen now watch what he's saying
[21:12] amen the token is the thing that makes
[21:15] the difference between Egypt and Israel
[21:18] they were two Nations amen they were all
[21:20] human beings but all God created it was
[21:23] all the handiwork of God but the
[21:25] difference between the death penalty
[21:27] that was passed of life and death was
[21:30] the
[21:31] token that was the difference that we'll
[21:33] be the coming of the Son of God brings
[21:35] the bride out of the church the
[21:37] difference will be the token Now you
[21:39] listen this afternoon and see the token
[21:41] will be the difference and see the Holy
[21:44] Ghost is the difference between a
[21:46] Christian and a holy ghost filled
[21:49] Christian it is the token now I know
[21:51] that a lot of people's tried a lot of
[21:53] things but let me say something very
[21:54] clearly nothing else is going to
[21:57] work listen you can try anything you
[22:00] want to try but let's just cut to the
[22:02] chase nothing else will work amen the
[22:05] difference is the Holy Ghost no matter
[22:08] what system you're in it still requires
[22:11] the token no matter what church you have
[22:13] joined God still will require the token
[22:16] no matter how many sermons you have
[22:18] heard or how many message you have read
[22:21] God requires the token amen unless the
[22:24] token is there death will strike your
[22:27] home the only hope we have is the token
[22:30] every man no matter if he was a loyal
[22:33] man might have been a pharaoh of Egypt
[22:34] but he was the most important man of
[22:36] that day but the token had to be applied
[22:38] to him he could have said look look I'm
[22:40] the Pharaoh here I'm the king here I
[22:42] don't have to humble myself to y'all's
[22:44] religion amen but unless you have the
[22:47] token amen there was death waiting on
[22:49] you it don't matter if you're a king or
[22:51] what your race or nationality amen of
[22:55] what what what position you hold among
[22:57] your people or who you are listen you
[22:59] must have that token it must be applied
[23:02] no matter how important he was whether
[23:05] he was a bishop or a priest or a
[23:08] president or a king or a potentate or a
[23:11] monarch this is a prophet now God only
[23:13] recognized to token Covenant people the
[23:16] same thing today the holy spirit will
[23:19] only recognize a covenant people isn't
[23:22] it isn't it a beautiful thing amen that
[23:24] the Holy Spirit would only recognize
[23:26] because if you have the Holy Ghost
[23:29] then God has recognized you as a
[23:31] believer in Exodus 4 we find amen that
[23:35] when the Moses had come in contact with
[23:37] a pillar of fire amen and he had been
[23:40] about 40 years on the back side of the
[23:42] desert and he'd been tend and sheep now
[23:43] you all know that Moses had got a bit
[23:45] offended at the Lord amen because he
[23:47] found out he was a deliverer and he went
[23:49] out to deliver the children of Israel
[23:51] and guess what come to find out even if
[23:54] you're a prophet an intellectual
[23:56] conception won't deliver the children of
[23:58] God God now Moses was born the prophet
[24:01] he was a a a proper man 400 years uh
[24:05] promised from Abraham that he would come
[24:07] and when he was born his mama told him
[24:09] who he was amen and how he was born and
[24:12] what he was born for and he thought that
[24:14] the education of who he was and what he
[24:16] was to do would be enough to deliver
[24:18] Israel out of Egypt but he found out all
[24:21] he did was killed one man amen and got
[24:24] through out of the whole the whole
[24:26] country because he found out in
[24:28] intellectual Powers no matter who you
[24:30] are is not going to deliver the Church
[24:33] of the Living God so he got uninterested
[24:35] now for 40 years he lost the interest in
[24:38] delivering them because he had already
[24:40] gave up in the weakness of man he gave
[24:42] up on the Promises amen and had even
[24:45] forgotten about it but the prophet of
[24:46] God said but somebody hadn't forgotten
[24:49] he said God hadn't forgotten that he
[24:50] would deliver his children so he sent a
[24:53] pillar of fire into a bush and Called
[24:55] Moses out to talk to that bush amen and
[24:58] when he stood there talking to it the
[25:00] prophet of God said he got more in five
[25:03] minutes in the presence of that fire
[25:05] than he did in all the years that he was
[25:07] in Egypt at 80 years old he learned more
[25:10] in five minutes in the presence of God
[25:13] I'll tell you this this morning this
[25:15] Pillar of Fire has what we need it's got
[25:18] everything we lack amen somebody said
[25:20] well brother I I lack this and I have I
[25:22] I need this and I need amen where do I
[25:24] go to get this and where do I go to get
[25:26] this amen I tell you God got a burning
[25:29] bush this morning for every believer and
[25:32] if you come to that burning bush it has
[25:34] everything you have need
[25:37] of yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah when Moses
[25:41] got down there after being so busy with
[25:43] his sheep and doing all these things and
[25:45] he got in the presence of God and he
[25:47] come down there and said hey man load
[25:49] the kids up honey we're going to go down
[25:50] and deliver the children of Israel amen
[25:53] and can you imagine amen this fell amen
[25:56] now look nothing has changed amen
[25:59] Pharaoh is still Pharaoh amen Egypt is
[26:02] still Egypt he's still Moses the stick
[26:05] he's carrying is still his stick that's
[26:07] still his wife and matter of fact
[26:08] nothing had changed in the world but
[26:11] Moses amen nothing had changed but Moses
[26:15] and sometimes that's all that really
[26:17] needs changing you don't really need to
[26:20] change Church you really don't need to
[26:22] change the town you live in amen you
[26:25] need to get the Holy Ghost and let God
[26:28] fixed life on the inside it changed that
[26:32] man and the whole world changed the day
[26:34] Moses got
[26:36] changed you know what he did he went
[26:38] down and told his wife said we're going
[26:39] to go deliver this now that what what he
[26:41] did though brother bam says it like this
[26:43] he got neglectful amen and watch even
[26:46] Moses the man of God now met the pillar
[26:49] of fire it came to pass that the Lord
[26:52] sought to kill him can you imagine God
[26:56] seeking to kill his own man man the
[26:59] Bible said the Lord sought to kill Moses
[27:02] God was hunting him to kill him now why
[27:04] was God hunting his man to kill him
[27:06] brother brandom says it very clearly he
[27:08] had got neglectful to the thing he was
[27:11] supposed to do for his children do you
[27:13] see Sephora his wife actually took a
[27:16] sharp Stone and took his son out amen
[27:18] and cut the foreskin of the son and
[27:20] threw it at her husband and said thou
[27:22] art a bloody husband unto me because of
[27:25] this circumcision now brother R said God
[27:28] would have killed Moses and his son had
[27:31] this woman not intervened amen and
[27:34] circumcised that child of God now you
[27:36] say preacher what are you talking about
[27:38] I'm talking about thank God there's
[27:40] still some Sephoras among us today and
[27:43] you say preacher Sephora what do you
[27:44] mean I mean there's still some churches
[27:47] that are reminding people you've got to
[27:49] have a circumcision from God Amen I
[27:52] don't care how well you're taught it
[27:54] don't matter how long you've been in the
[27:56] message it doesn't matter how many
[27:58] church services are you hearing me
[28:01] you've got to circumcise your children
[28:05] you've got to circumcise your lives God
[28:08] was killing God was in a killing mood
[28:10] can you imagine God in a killing mood
[28:13] because somebody didn't circumcise a
[28:15] child and look at this brother bam says
[28:18] to Israel and the church and watch how
[28:19] now neglectful a man can get God met him
[28:22] down here in the end and would have
[28:24] slayed him but Sephora took a sharp Rock
[28:27] circumcised her children and throw the
[28:29] foreskin before Moses and said you're a
[28:32] bloody husband saved Moses's life oh
[28:37] what was Moses doing Moses had got in a
[28:39] hustle and a bustle of the day until he
[28:42] was such a place to go down there he
[28:44] forgot the Seal of circumcision now
[28:47] until we forget the Seal of God which is
[28:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now watch
[28:53] this friends we know this message since
[28:55] uh the prophet brought it in 1960s and
[28:58] 65 there has been a generation of people
[29:01] and we have been busy building churches
[29:03] and we have been busy doing Mission work
[29:05] and we have been busy printing books and
[29:08] translations and we've been busy
[29:10] teaching and we've been busy making
[29:12] churches amen but I pray to God we've
[29:14] not been neglectful in the circumcision
[29:17] of our new generation I believe this
[29:20] morning if there is anything needed
[29:22] among the message of the hour is a
[29:25] circumcision of the flesh that people
[29:27] can live again before God with Holiness
[29:30] and purity of our almighty God now watch
[29:33] this I want you to watch this now in
[29:35] Joshua chapter 5 we see that Spirit
[29:37] revisits them the same way it did to
[29:40] Moses because just before the journey
[29:42] Moses had a circumcision in Joshua
[29:45] chapter 5 just after the death of Moses
[29:48] and the children of Israel are going to
[29:50] go into the new land but watch now they
[29:52] are carrying a reproach of the 40 years
[29:56] they've spilled in the wilderness the
[29:58] the Bible tells us that none of the
[29:59] children which had been born in that
[30:01] 40-year period had been circumcised amen
[30:05] and there was a reproach They Carried
[30:07] upon them amen because of the lack of
[30:10] the circumcision in their lives now they
[30:12] were Israelites and oh yeah they were
[30:14] born to cross that land but they were
[30:17] uncircumcised in their bodies in their
[30:19] flesh they were carried I reproach to it
[30:22] now listen if I ever seen a type in my
[30:24] life look at some of the generation
[30:26] that's been born since this messages
[30:28] here I remember back in the late ' 80s
[30:30] and early '90s when I was just a kid I
[30:33] remember hearing preachers man they were
[30:35] preaching against television and rock
[30:36] and roll dope smoking and cigarettes and
[30:39] it was almost a place of legalism how
[30:42] many remembers that you remember that
[30:45] amen amen was no Spirit got by man amen
[30:48] it was a stomping and a cutting and a
[30:50] hurting and amen it was almost a stage
[30:52] of legalism and we moved on from that
[30:55] and and we started and watch but all of
[30:57] the sudden we found out this one started
[30:59] fighting this direction and that one
[31:01] fighting this and this leader rose up
[31:03] among us and this leader this way and
[31:05] people got awful busy people got awful
[31:08] busy and we had a generation grow up
[31:11] Among Us that have never realized the
[31:14] power of the circumcision of the Holy
[31:17] Ghost I'm talking about something this
[31:20] morning that can cut the flesh away from
[31:22] a young man or a young woman the Bible
[31:25] tells us that they were born out in the
[31:27] wilderness were uncircumcised but before
[31:30] God would let them go into that land
[31:32] they had to take a knife and begin to
[31:34] circumcise their flesh now y'all know
[31:36] what that means it means they cut away
[31:39] the unnecessary things they cut away the
[31:41] unnecessary flesh and it separated them
[31:45] from the other people that were around
[31:47] them I tell you this morning I thank God
[31:50] that they still a baptism of the Holy
[31:52] Ghost it carries the sharp nth of the
[31:54] circumcision of the twoed sword of the
[31:57] word of God brother amen there's nothing
[31:59] worse amen than a flesh getting in the
[32:01] way of a promise amen y y'all y'all
[32:04] preach with me now I'm not after anybody
[32:06] I want you to watch something amen many
[32:08] people they'd really like to get
[32:09] something from God but the devil's
[32:11] sitting on their shoulder telling them
[32:12] but you watch certain sir last week and
[32:15] you done certain certain thing last
[32:16] month and this happened here and this
[32:18] happened there you know what it is it's
[32:20] flesh and it's keeping you out of the
[32:23] real Covenant Promises of God but by the
[32:26] grace of God is a word this morning that
[32:29] is sharper than any two-edged sword and
[32:32] it'll cut away the flesh that is keeping
[32:35] you out of the promises of God thank God
[32:38] this morning there's something amen
[32:40] listen I know in that day they had a
[32:42] high priest amen and he was a high
[32:44] priest that would circumcise him
[32:46] children on the eighth day but we have
[32:48] another high priest of our circumcision
[32:51] this morning it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:55] and he comes right to our heart
[32:58] and circumcises the way the things that
[33:01] are wrong
[33:03] and I could spend some time there and
[33:05] you all know I could amen but think of
[33:08] this it rolled the reproach away from
[33:11] the people of God that they didn't have
[33:14] to carry it with them anymore amen can
[33:17] you imagine when they got up from them
[33:19] Banks they were different than they were
[33:21] the day before I pray God bring back the
[33:23] banks of the Jordan amen bring back the
[33:26] sharp knives of the men of God Amen that
[33:29] could cut away the Flesh and give people
[33:31] an opportunity to go to the promises
[33:34] that have been made for this generation
[33:36] I believe there's a lot of generation
[33:38] lot of it now you say preacher amen how
[33:41] do you think things get in this shape
[33:42] well we might as well pre is it okay you
[33:44] visitors can I go ahead and preach y'all
[33:46] y'all with me you okay amen I I'm just
[33:48] going to go ahead and preach like I'm at
[33:49] home okay amen now what happens is is
[33:53] what takes place is that they're
[33:55] actually becomes workers of iniquity
[33:57] among among us as a
[33:59] people now watch amen now the Bible says
[34:03] amen that not everyone that saith unto
[34:04] me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom but
[34:07] he that doeth the will of My Father
[34:09] which is in heaven now many will say to
[34:11] that day Lord have not we prophesied in
[34:13] thy name now there's a preacher and in
[34:15] thy name we cast out Devils workers of
[34:18] Miracles and they've done many wonderful
[34:20] things and I profess unto them depart
[34:23] from me I never knew you now watch this
[34:28] amen they done the things amen of the
[34:31] Gospel but they never knew
[34:33] God come on now why does it call them a
[34:37] worker of iniquity because they preach
[34:39] the gospel without the Holy
[34:41] Ghost they they prophesied but never
[34:45] received the Holy Ghost listen let me
[34:47] say something to you this morning amen
[34:49] that's the reason a lot of people are
[34:51] not preaching the baptism of the Holy
[34:53] Ghost as an experience to the people
[34:55] because they've never had it themselves
[34:58] and how can you preach to somebody
[35:00] something that you've never experienced
[35:02] yourself listen I am not just reading to
[35:05] you something out of a book but I've
[35:08] been there in the presence of that Holy
[35:11] Fire amen it'll change your life it'll
[35:14] change who you are it'll change how you
[35:17] think it'll change how you think it's
[35:20] God and a man can walk in the presence
[35:23] of
[35:24] God you can walk in there and come back
[35:26] and any man that ever been there can
[35:28] never talk the same think the same walk
[35:30] the same act the same because God
[35:35] changes there's got to be a from that
[35:38] time moment in your
[35:40] life nobody ever met God and stayed the
[35:43] [Applause]
[35:46] same nobody ever met God and stayed the
[35:49] same even the devil was changed when he
[35:53] met God even death was changed when it
[35:56] met God even death itself was changed
[36:00] when God met it amen and Paul stood
[36:02] there in the face of death and said you
[36:04] can take off my head amen but death
[36:07] where is your Victory amen the victory
[36:10] has been taken away from
[36:12] you let me tell you death was left
[36:14] shameful in the presence of Jesus
[36:18] Christ now listen listen that's that's
[36:21] what happens is because men without the
[36:24] Holy Ghost are preaching the gospel and
[36:27] they can't preach the gospel with an
[36:29] experience so they're only preaching it
[36:32] from an intellectual level that's how
[36:35] that's how that psychology got a place
[36:37] in our pull
[36:40] pits that's how it come in don't give no
[36:43] place to the devil Paul says and grieve
[36:46] not the spirit of God in other words if
[36:49] you want to fix marriages let me tell
[36:51] you how you do it you get God in the
[36:53] room and he burns out the selfishness
[36:56] and the pride and The Unforgiven Spirits
[36:59] he burns out the lust and and the
[37:01] pornography and he burns out the
[37:04] adultery and the fornications until man
[37:07] can live with a woman and a woman can
[37:09] live with a man I really believe with
[37:11] all of my heart what we really need in
[37:14] the Church of the Living hour is God
[37:17] manifesting in the power of the Holy
[37:21] Ghost well I tell you it's the truth
[37:27] that's how that's how the devil got a
[37:29] place that's how psychology got in men
[37:32] without the Holy Ghost had no power to
[37:34] move Spirits so they try to talk people
[37:36] out of
[37:39] it come
[37:40] on men not called to preach the message
[37:43] wants to Pastor churches and wants to do
[37:46] many times their marriages are not right
[37:48] their lives are not right but they want
[37:50] they want a possession they want a
[37:52] position so the people themselves suffer
[37:55] because they cannot produce the
[37:57] manifestation of the word so they
[37:59] replace it with intellectualism they
[38:01] replace it with psychology they replace
[38:04] god with emotionalism and pep and high
[38:07] but God cannot be replaced and the new
[38:09] bear cannot be replaced amen there is a
[38:12] God and his name is Jesus and he comes
[38:16] in Your Heart by the baptism of the Holy
[38:19] Ghost you can't claim manifestation is
[38:21] the evidence of being Spirit born or
[38:23] spirit
[38:24] filled brother I cast out a devil I got
[38:27] the whole ghost you can't claim
[38:29] that no sir I I spoke in tongue sorry
[38:33] you can't claim that no evidence of the
[38:35] Holy Ghost brother Bram said I've seen
[38:37] Devils speak with
[38:39] tongues I've been overseas I've seen it
[38:41] myself I've seen Devils speaking tongues
[38:44] and manifesting that and deny the name
[38:46] of Jesus Christ amen we have seen people
[38:48] walk on the coals and fires and y'all
[38:51] seen the Hinduism and the there's young
[38:53] man sitting there probably saw it
[38:54] firsthand I preached to him in his
[38:56] village all the way over in India he
[38:58] knows what I'm saying is the truth
[38:59] listen some of this black magic and
[39:01] Witchcraft we have in America it's a
[39:03] joke he comes for where it's real where
[39:07] people really do these kind of things so
[39:09] manifestation does not mean
[39:13] God come on Amen now what watch brother
[39:16] B you say what does it mean it means God
[39:18] still does those things it means God
[39:21] still alive but it's not an Evidence of
[39:24] the individual that is spirit filled
[39:27] yeah now you said well then there's got
[39:29] to be an Evidence somewhere yes there is
[39:32] the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[39:34] is today is the same as it was back in
[39:35] the days of our Lord amen it is the
[39:38] receiving of the word of Truth for the
[39:40] day which you live
[39:42] hallelujah thank God he didn't put it on
[39:45] emotion thank God he didn't put it on
[39:47] manifestation he put it on the solid
[39:50] rock of the word of God Jesus said on
[39:53] this rock I will build my church and the
[39:56] gates of hell never Prevail against it
[39:58] when you have a Vindicated word you've
[40:01] got an answer from God and that answer
[40:03] from God can qualify you for the
[40:05] resurrection woo glory to
[40:09] God I'm so glad to know this morning

[40:48] Holy Ghost
[40:51] Hallelujah many of them can say Lord
[40:53] Lord but it's an unbiblical answer we
[40:56] get results it's an unbiblical answer
[40:59] somebody said well our church is growing
[41:01] we must be serving the lord that's not a
[41:02] Biblical answer at
[41:04] all brother brandham actually answered
[41:06] that cuz somebody told him their
[41:07] denomination was growing he said well I
[41:09] heard prostitution was up by 60% in

[41:42] into the church with the power of the
[41:44] Holy Ghost yes sir amen this amen what
[41:48] we find amen is that the prophet of God

[42:41] raining now you say
[42:43] preacher now that's why see some say
[42:46] some think well I'll tell you what man
[42:48] after the seals the Holy Ghost ceased
[42:50] well that's not true it was in the
[42:52] second seal brother Bram said I command
[42:54] you in the name of the Lord Jesus that
[42:56] you kneel down here and stay till you're
[42:58] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[43:01] Ghost now somebody said well do I have
[43:04] to really have to do that I really have
[43:05] to get the Holy Ghost did non really
[43:07] have to dip seven
[43:11] times no he didn't have to dip seven
[43:14] times but he could stay with Leprosy
[43:16] too no you don't have to receive the
[43:19] Holy Ghost but you can keep leprosy too
[43:22] but if you want the Holy Ghost you got
[43:23] to get it the same way they did in the
[43:26] book of Acts somebody said well Mary
[43:28] just believed and got it well she did
[43:30] when she received the word for the birth
[43:32] of Jesus but when it talks about her
[43:34] going to heaven the prophet of God said
[43:36] 120 went in the upper room and Mary got
[43:39] just as drunk as any of the others and
[43:42] if Mary had to get drunk in the Holy
[43:44] Ghost to get into heaven brother you
[43:46] will not get into heaven without the
[43:48] Holy Ghost either Hallelujah I believe
[43:51] it I believe there's a God this morning
[43:53] walking the aisles of this building and
[43:55] every man or woman or child that wants
[43:57] Holy Ghost it is available to you
[44:02] today thank God it ain't a certificate
[44:04] that I got to pass out you can receive
[44:06] it right
[44:07] now that's the thing I like about the
[44:09] message you don't have to hold the
[44:11] Pentecostals come to the altar come to
[44:13] the altar come to the altar come to the
[44:14] altar the Baptist just lift your hand
[44:16] just lift your hand but a Prophet come
[44:18] along and he said people got the Holy
[44:20] Ghost the first time in the Gentile age
[44:22] they were hearing the preaching of the
[44:24] word and they just begin to believe and
[44:27] the Holy Ghost fell on them I don't care
[44:29] if you get the Holy Ghost in your chair
[44:31] I don't care if you get it at the altar
[44:34] amen I just want to see you get the Holy
[44:36] Ghost God that can change your life the
[44:40] holy ghost that can give you an
[44:41] experience with
[44:44] god well somebody say hallelujah I
[44:47] believe the Holy Ghost is available this
[44:49] morning to every
[44:54] person well look if it was just a ritual
[44:58] if it's just a church going didn't Moab
[45:01] have
[45:02] that didn't Moab have seven alars and
[45:05] seven Rams if that's all it is Moab and
[45:08] balam is just as good as anybody else
[45:10] but God showed the difference he said
[45:13] down there in Israel there was a brass
[45:15] Serpent and a brozen and a and a smitten
[45:18] Rock and he said back there behind the
[45:20] veil was that Pillar of Fire that was
[45:22] the difference between Moab and Israel
[45:25] it wasn't their teaching brother it was
[45:27] the Dynamics of the power of God that
[45:30] came behind the
[45:33] [Applause]
[45:35] teaching I know where we are in this age
[45:37] everybody's about teaching and teaching
[45:39] and you know me I'm this is a teaching
[45:41] Church actually we love teaching
[45:44] here but you know what the prophet said
[45:47] he said Dynamics and mechanics come
[45:49] together and he said now the Dynamics is
[45:51] the
[45:51] fire and the mechanics is the word right
[45:55] is that right he said said but if you
[45:57] put the word he said if you put the
[45:59] Dynamics in on some mechanics he said
[46:02] that's a little water down like gasoline
[46:04] little water down he said it'll sputter
[46:07] out so I'm afraid that a lot of the
[46:10] teaching had been watered
[46:13] down so a lot of us been watered down
[46:15] can I say can I say from my heart we
[46:17] need to quit watering down this
[46:20] message well I'm afraid the people's
[46:23] going to shout it ain't going to hurt
[46:24] them amen if you preach this message
[46:26] with power yes people are going to shout
[46:29] if you preach this message with power
[46:32] yeah somebody's going to dance because
[46:33] somebody is going to get Victory but I'm
[46:36] tired of this watered down bunch of
[46:38] theology that's took the power of God
[46:41] out of the church I say God said we
[46:43] could have it I say I want it with
[46:45] everything that's in me give me the Holy
[46:48] Ghost with power and manifestation I
[46:51] don't want to water down church I don't
[46:53] want to water down gospel I want to see
[46:56] the the power of God strike the word
[46:59] brother Dallas I still want the fire of
[47:01] God in my
[47:04] heart if it's just ritual if that's all
[47:08] it is then Moab had it let me take you a
[47:11] step further than that brother Bram said
[47:13] Cain had
[47:16] it if that's all that matters cuz y'all
[47:18] you that know the you that know the you
[47:21] that know the outlay of the feast knows
[47:23] that Cain did offer one of the feast how
[47:25] many knows that he offered the first
[47:27] fruits he bought the first fruits of the
[47:30] field he brought a resurrection and he
[47:34] brought a resurrection altar but he
[47:37] bypassed the atonement to have
[47:39] it that's why the Bible said that Abel's
[47:42] sacrifice was more excellent didn't say
[47:45] can's wasn't excellent it said abeles
[47:47] were more excellent because he knew by
[47:50] Revelation it has to be the blood before
[47:53] it's a resurrection you got to have the
[47:55] Holy Ghost before there's a resurrection
[47:58] you can't bypass the Holy
[48:00] Ghost and have a
[48:04] resurrection if it's just fundamental
[48:07] then Cain had it then Moab had it if
[48:10] it's just look look if it's just C
[48:12] theology then what's your problem with
[48:14] the five foolish
[48:17] virgins come on now the Bible said they
[48:20] all were
[48:22] virgins and brother B said they all have
[48:24] was made out of the same material and
[48:26] lived holy and clean
[48:29] lives and they had good theology he said
[48:33] but the difference between the two was
[48:34] the fire of
[48:36] God and the reason they didn't have any
[48:39] fire is because they didn't have any
[48:42] oil how is it how is it they run out of
[48:45] oil the Bible said they all took off and
[48:47] had fire didn't it didn't it the Bible
[48:49] say they all went out 10 of them went
[48:50] out they all had lamps that was on fire
[48:52] you mean if you study the message
[48:54] brother Ram said them sanctified people
[48:56] had a tough
[48:57] or they had a dip in the Holy Ghost and
[48:59] they had the fire of
[49:01] sanctification but when the ages started
[49:04] changing it began to run out and they
[49:07] thought just the restoration of
[49:10] Pentecost would keep that fire burning
[49:12] but where is Pentecost now come on
[49:15] where's theza Street at now it's
[49:17] slumbering and sleeping with the others
[49:20] and they're all fall under the foolish
[49:22] virgin but there was five of them wise
[49:24] virgins that carried their vessels with
[49:26] them
[49:27] Hallelujah I thank God for the opening
[49:29] of the word I think we've been given a
[49:31] word that'll take us all the way to the
[49:35] Rapture I don't have time to preach on
[49:37] it but can I say it to you it's an
[49:39] unending Revival Amen in other words
[49:42] it's the same kind of vessel amen that
[49:44] the woman was given when she met Elijah
[49:47] and was about to run out of meal and he
[49:49] said give to me first and your mealb
[49:52] will never run dry neither your curse of
[49:54] oil I tell you this morning we've had an
[49:57] Elijah among us and we give him all of
[50:00] our Pentecostal traditions and when we
[50:03] did we received thus sayith the Lord
[50:06] your curse of old will
[50:09] never it will never somebody say it it
[50:12] will never it will never run
[50:16] dry it's an unending Revival it's an
[50:18] unting time when God pours the holy
[50:21] ghost out upon this word can I can I
[50:23] give yall a little cue here amen it was
[50:26] the re filling of the Holy Ghost the
[50:28] wise virgins got
[50:30] under the Dynamics of this church will
[50:36] be a refilling of the Holy
[50:40] Ghost somebody said brother Wayne I tell
[50:42] you what I got the Holy Ghost when I
[50:44] come and first got in the message but
[50:45] this happened and this happened and this
[50:48] happened and I got grieved about this
[50:50] and I got grieved and it's funny some of
[50:52] the things people get grieved about they
[50:54] get offended about all kinds of things
[50:56] but it really don't matter the thing
[50:57] that you got grieved about the thing is
[50:59] is that it suffered you amen but listen
[51:03] grieve not the spirit of God whereby you
[51:05] are sealed until the day of redemption
[51:08] you never lost your salvation you lost
[51:11] the joy of your salvation what you need
[51:14] is a refilling of the Holy Ghost and let
[51:17] the power of God come back in the
[51:22] church I say pour it out Lord
[51:27] pour it out
[51:28] [Applause]
[51:30] Lord I'm reading it y'all know I'm in
[51:33] the middle of it you know you know I'm
[51:34] in in Matthew 25 and that five wise
[51:37] virgins that had a refilling of the oil
[51:39] you won't get it any other way in this
[51:41] message you're not going to get any oil
[51:43] out of that Pentecostal system you're
[51:45] not going to get any oil out of the Bas
[51:47] Baptist system the day is
[51:50] finished can I just say it there's no
[51:52] mercy left under that
[51:54] message there's no light left under that
[51:57] message but if you walk in the light as
[52:00] he is in the light you can have
[52:01] Fellowship can you can have oil you can
[52:04] have oil for your lamp and you won't
[52:06] never run dry brother gersam thanks be
[52:09] to God that there's something that can
[52:11] keep the oil in a
[52:13] [Music]
[52:15] vessel amen I'm glad I'm glad about it
[52:19] you see Israel when they coming out of
[52:20] Egypt now the thing about scripture is
[52:22] scripture repeats itself y'all remember
[52:24] I've called my son out of Egypt how many
[52:26] Book of Matthew you remember that when
[52:28] Jesus went down and he went into Egypt
[52:30] for a time and he said I called my son
[52:31] out of Egypt but really that was also
[52:34] talking about when God called Jacob out
[52:37] of of Egypt so it was a double meaning
[52:41] on the same scripture that's why brother
[52:42] B said scripture has compound meaning
[52:45] right so it has a compound meaning so
[52:48] the scripture is not like a letter you
[52:50] write to someone like if you write me a
[52:53] letter okay and if Paul was just writing
[52:55] to theh Visions then that letter was
[52:58] good for one time for one reading for
[53:01] One's group of people but the word of
[53:03] God is compound and it is a Living Word
[53:07] and it's written to all people at all
[53:09] times for all good for inspiration for
[53:13] Doctrine and exhortation and correction
[53:15] right so it's not just like a letter so
[53:18] you see that the the prophecy repeats
[53:21] itself and so is it when Exodus when
[53:24] they're coming out under the token
[53:26] message m in Exodus 12 now I know you
[53:27] all Bible readers so I won't turn there
[53:29] but in Exodus 12 when God got ready to
[53:32] deliver them he had to do it through
[53:34] judgment and
[53:35] wrath amen the Bible says that he would
[53:38] pass through Egypt and he would pass
[53:40] over Israel I like that don't you he
[53:43] went through one over the other he went
[53:45] through Egypt passed through Egypt and
[53:47] the Bible said he executed judgment upon
[53:51] the gods of Egypt now I'm I'm not I need
[53:54] to do it someday cuz I keep telling
[53:55] people someday day I'm going to do it I
[53:57] guess someday I will amen but but
[53:59] someday I'm going to do it actually
[54:00] there's 10 plagues right Moses brings
[54:03] and there's 10 major deities of Egypt
[54:06] that's why God exercised power over
[54:09] every one of their
[54:12] deities can you imagine the the deities
[54:15] how they worshiped him and all of a
[54:16] sudden the God of this bunch of slaves
[54:19] the God of this bunch of mud this low
[54:21] class muddobbers these slaves down here
[54:24] their God is dominating our God
[54:27] God Amen he was executing judgment but
[54:30] before he executed judgment he gave
[54:33] Grace oh I'll tell you God gives Grace
[54:35] in the middle of judgment isn't that
[54:37] powerful only God can do that but how is
[54:40] it that God how is it really that God
[54:44] could send judgment and hit an entire
[54:46] nation and miss a certain group of
[54:48] people how is it that God could could
[54:52] put Darkness over a whole nation but one
[54:55] little city was going to have some
[54:57] light how is it that God could determine
[55:00] the difference between the cattle in the
[55:03] field how could he determine the
[55:05] difference in this house and this house
[55:08] there was a token
[55:10] involved and when God got ready to
[55:12] prepare the people for Exodus he sent a
[55:14] prophet and a pillar of fire and a
[55:18] message now you could have received him
[55:20] prophet and Pillar of Fire and believe
[55:22] he was from God and turned down his
[55:24] message and you still were in Egypt
[55:28] you could say you're a Pentecostal all
[55:29] you want to you're still in
[55:32] Egypt you see that you're either in the
[55:35] bride or you're
[55:37] not I don't mean that in seclusion I
[55:40] mean that in the token so watch what
[55:42] he's doing he had a message the message
[55:44] was to apply the blood now the
[55:45] Simplicity of that message could be
[55:47] understood by anybody is apply the blood
[55:50] now I I don't want to get into the deep
[55:52] processes of this so just for a sake
[55:54] let's just say it like this amen the
[55:56] blood of the Lamb was what God chose in
[55:58] his mind before the world
[56:00] began and when God said he slay the lamb
[56:03] before the foundation of the world he's
[56:05] actually talking about Jesus but he's
[56:08] not revealed it yet right it's only as a
[56:11] lamb to the slaughter the book of Isaiah
[56:13] Moses is revealing God has an atonement
[56:15] but hasn't yet expressed exactly to the
[56:18] Fulfillment of what that atonement would
[56:20] be but watch he takes the blood of a
[56:22] lamb which means death for death in the
[56:25] Garden of Eden there must be something
[56:27] die but since there is no man born of a
[56:31] woman without sex there's no blood of a
[56:33] man that can attone for the sex birth of
[56:36] the twins back there in that Garden
[56:38] there's nothing that could do away with
[56:39] the sin that had been done so what they
[56:42] did is they could only apply blood amen
[56:44] as an atonement which was only temporary
[56:47] until the time that God did something
[56:49] greater now he considered Israel his
[56:52] firstborn
[56:54] child so he was protecting his own son
[56:58] through the blood speaking of you and I
[57:02] being protected but the thing is is that
[57:04] the blood of a lamb had no soul now
[57:07] y'all know as long as it was a perfect
[57:09] lamb it really didn't matter what his
[57:11] name was right it didn't matter what
[57:13] family it was born out of it just had to
[57:14] be a perfect you and of so many days and
[57:17] had to be kept up 14 days and studied
[57:19] and when it was determined to be perfect
[57:21] then they could kill it had no soul
[57:23] right amen so not having a soul every
[57:26] lamb is of a lamb nature now the thing
[57:29] about a lamb nature is it's a beast and
[57:31] that nature of a beast could not come
[57:34] back upon man matter of fact God
[57:36] wouldn't permit it because it was a
[57:38] beast with a woman that brought the
[57:40] problem to begin with and God Is Now
[57:43] using the blood of a beast and he's only
[57:46] atoning something for God to look
[57:49] at he can't look at the at the natural
[57:53] person he's looking at that blood but
[57:55] he's not looking at the blood of a
[57:57] woolly lamb he's thinking of the blood
[58:00] of his son and that's why when he put
[58:03] that blood up here it was so important
[58:04] that the angel could see that blood now
[58:06] now you say brother Wayne why in the
[58:08] world would they put that old nasty
[58:09] stinky Blood on the door of their houses
[58:13] cuz the prophet said
[58:16] so now that'll solve a lot of problems
[58:19] in your
[58:20] life young mans one time they said to me
[58:23] brother Wayne why can't we wear shorts
[58:24] and I didn't give him the hundred reason
[58:26] answer I said the prophet said
[58:29] so you don't need more answers than
[58:33] that now watch what he did well I
[58:36] bounced around the room amen but you
[58:38] don't need more answers than that amen
[58:40] now now watch what happened that that
[58:42] blood was placed across the L the door
[58:45] and there's a lot of types I don't have
[58:46] time for them but look that they they
[58:48] brought that across that now it was
[58:50] visible to God because God had to see
[58:53] something had died now if you take the
[58:55] blood out of a lamb it speaks of the
[58:58] death of the Lamb right because when you
[59:00] see blood what died now the blood was
[59:03] required because it had to prove the
[59:05] death but the death of that lamb could
[59:06] not atone you in other words you
[59:08] couldn't put it on the person you had to
[59:10] put it on the door you couldn't put it
[59:12] now now what's it speaking of it's
[59:14] speaking that there was not an approach
[59:17] that God could take Sin from the
[59:20] individual but what he put the blood
[59:22] over the door that it was a visible sign
[59:24] but now Jacob what you do with that lamb
[59:27] itself he took that lamb and put it in
[59:29] the house and they eat that roasted lamb
[59:33] right and when they eat it with B with
[59:34] bitter weeds and watch what they done
[59:36] they roasted it with fire but they
[59:38] couldn't see it now you say preacher
[59:39] what are we talking about we're talking
[59:41] about an in time manifestation of God
[59:44] where you're going to see a display of
[59:48] the literal life of Jesus but you're not
[59:51] going to see his Corporal body it's
[59:53] going to be hid from you but the life is
[59:56] going to be visible to you amen the
[59:59] token is what is required listen to save
[1:00:03] this generation we wasn't looking for
[1:00:05] the Corporal body we were looking for
[1:00:07] the literal life Hallelujah come on
[1:00:11] Church look you can't take the literal
[1:00:13] body in you the Corporal body could not
[1:00:16] come into you but the life that was in
[1:00:19] that body the life that was in that
[1:00:21] blood was God
[1:00:24] himself Hallelujah Hallelujah I don't
[1:00:27] have time to preach on the Virgin birth
[1:00:28] but let me tell you this Mary didn't
[1:00:30] have nothing to do with it and Joseph
[1:00:33] didn't have nothing to do with it amen
[1:00:35] it was both male and female how many
[1:00:36] knows what I'm talking about both blood
[1:00:38] and the egg come from God just like in
[1:00:41] the beginning when God created both male
[1:00:44] and female and called their name Adam
[1:00:47] come on Amen and God took a name change
[1:00:50] when he created them and so did he when
[1:00:52] he created amen Jesus in the womb of of
[1:00:56] if Mary what did he do he put male and
[1:00:59] female and changed the name from Jehovah
[1:01:02] to Jesus because Jesus was Jehovah now
[1:01:06] salvation saving the people and the
[1:01:08] people he was going to save was in him
[1:01:11] can you imagine
[1:01:13] this I know it gets too deep to preach
[1:01:15] one morning but but but but but look at
[1:01:17] the power of this that that token was
[1:01:20] representing that the animal life could
[1:01:22] not come in now now look when this can
[1:01:25] you imagine brother Bram does a good job
[1:01:27] at drama I'm not much of a drama guy but

[1:03:12] word made up by William tendale in the
[1:03:14] 1500s atonement it means to cover or to
[1:03:18] propitiate but you see that word
[1:03:20] atonement in the Hebrew is coford I

[1:03:40] to you out of the Hebrew it's beautiful
[1:03:42] but the word c man in other words th
[1:03:45] this son this this what we're doing is
[1:03:48] what God's way of sealing our home how
[1:03:52] do we know it work you you remember this
[1:03:54] deliver Moses you remember how we told
[1:03:56] you he come down the Jordan amen and the
[1:03:59] alligators didn't eat him yeah Daddy I
[1:04:02] remember that do you know what kept Him
[1:04:04] no dad what was it it was a special
[1:04:06] stuff that his mama under the
[1:04:09] instruction of the Angel put a tire
[1:04:11] around the basket and sealed it off and
[1:04:14] when she put that baby in it God seen
[1:04:16] that as his own seal and he put angels
[1:04:19] around that basket son and I'll tell you
[1:04:22] there wasn't an alligator that could
[1:04:23] touch it sure God didn't take all the
[1:04:26] Alligators out of the river no God
[1:04:28] didn't take all the Egyptians out of the
[1:04:30] country he put a seal on that Ark and he
[1:04:34] put his son in and he told the devil
[1:04:36] don't you touch this this is my seal
[1:04:39] this is my Ark this is my
[1:04:42] child come on Amen well Daddy these are
[1:04:44] more than crocodiles judgment angels are
[1:04:46] coming say son I tell you there was a
[1:04:48] time that when judgment struck the whole
[1:04:50] earth matter of fact in the days of Noah
[1:04:52] remember back Dad told you years ago
[1:04:54] about when the whole Earth was scattered
[1:04:56] and it was flooded how Noah our
[1:04:58] forefather got across that flood had to
[1:05:00] get across dadd he said yeah he got on
[1:05:02] the boat son don't you know there were
[1:05:04] other boats in that time don't you
[1:05:07] realize folks there were other messages
[1:05:09] and other preachers and other people
[1:05:11] amen the Bible tells us that there was
[1:05:12] nothing new Under the Sun amen there was
[1:05:16] there was other people but this one God
[1:05:18] was constructing and you know son God
[1:05:21] told Noah by vision of how to do it and
[1:05:23] he took a wood and the boat Builders
[1:05:25] looked said you building different than
[1:05:27] everybody else builds what are you
[1:05:28] building that gopher wood
[1:05:31] for but see there was a revelation
[1:05:33] behind it JP goer wood was a
[1:05:36] sponge amen and it was open the pores
[1:05:39] were open now look at the beauty of this
[1:05:42] because if you get a pore that can be
[1:05:43] opened it can be closed amen because it
[1:05:46] can be sealed and and he had that gopher
[1:05:48] wood now the beauty of it is is when the
[1:05:50] Bible says that Noah was to pitch the
[1:05:52] ark y'all know that word pitch p i t c
[1:05:55] he was to to pitch the ark inside and
[1:05:57] outside how many knows that word pitch
[1:05:59] is the same word as
[1:06:03] atonement he was to put an atonement on
[1:06:06] the ark that would protect the people on
[1:06:09] the inside from the Judgment that was on
[1:06:12] the outside amen that pitch that was on
[1:06:15] there y'all y'all y'all I know y'all
[1:06:17] know this but I got to say it to get
[1:06:18] where I'm going do you know where they
[1:06:20] got the pitch amen it it if you study it
[1:06:23] it come it's the resin out of a certain
[1:06:25] kind of pine tree we call it pine tree
[1:06:28] it was an evergreen
[1:06:31] tree It Never Dies you know it's an
[1:06:34] evergreen tree it's an everlasting tree
[1:06:38] now when they picked the tree for the
[1:06:39] pitch they didn't pick it for its beauty
[1:06:42] they picked it because of the kind of
[1:06:44] life that was in it and that's why
[1:06:46] Isaiah 53 said amen that he was not
[1:06:49] beautiful that we could look at him but
[1:06:52] he made a perfect offering because of
[1:06:55] the life that was in him and they took
[1:06:57] the life out of a living tree melted it
[1:07:00] down and put it on the ark to protect
[1:07:03] the people and that's exactly son what
[1:07:05] God is doing when we put the life out of
[1:07:08] this lamb and we put it up here we put
[1:07:10] it on the door that's exactly what we're
[1:07:12] doing we're applying the life of a lamb
[1:07:15] to protect our lives oh Church of the
[1:07:18] Living God what a beautiful type that in
[1:07:21] the days when judgment has striken
[1:07:24] leosia and judgment is everywhere upon
[1:07:27] every house upon every nation upon every
[1:07:31] city but there is a people of God this
[1:07:33] morning sitting in the house of God with
[1:07:37] a token over their
[1:07:39] lives God himself put that token on this
[1:07:44] church say preacher why do you say we
[1:07:46] need the Holy Ghost cuz God's word said
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:51] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that
[1:07:54] seal
[1:07:56] right the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:58] that token of Exodus 12 it is the seal
[1:08:02] it is the pitch that was on the Ark of
[1:08:05] Noah amen you are sealed unto the day of
[1:08:08] your Redemption let me say it to you the
[1:08:10] Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:13] Ghost how long does this seal last I
[1:08:18] tell you what I know we don't have
[1:08:19] enough time to preach how powerful this
[1:08:21] is but let me say this it last a long
[1:08:23] time
[1:08:26] it last until the day of redemption I
[1:08:27] don't care how young you are poor
[1:08:29] brother poor Brother Ray I use him all
[1:08:31] the time but how long you had the Holy
[1:08:33] Ghost Brother
[1:08:35] Ray since
[1:08:38] 1969 now I was born 73 and I'm 51 so
[1:08:42] that's about 55
[1:08:44] years that he's had the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:47] it has kept him 55 years
[1:08:53] amen the seal is good
[1:08:56] this is the kind of seal that'll last a
[1:08:58] lifetime this is a money back guarantee
[1:09:02] from almighty God Amen you can buy it
[1:09:05] anywhere and he'll stand behind it you
[1:09:08] can get it in any church and God will
[1:09:10] stand behind it is't that something I
[1:09:13] don't care you you buy some things
[1:09:14] that's got guarantees and you get them
[1:09:16] at Walmart they don't want to back it up
[1:09:18] oh you bought that at Lowe's and all we
[1:09:19] can't back it up let me tell you this
[1:09:21] you get the Holy Ghost I don't care if
[1:09:23] you get in the street if you get in the
[1:09:25] car if you get it in the Catholic Church
[1:09:27] you get it in the Baptist Church I don't
[1:09:29] care where you get it God will back up
[1:09:32] his
[1:09:36] Spirit yes sir there's a guarantee
[1:09:40] guaranteed secure to eternal life
[1:09:43] guaranteed assurance that you'll come
[1:09:45] out of the Grave amen how do you know
[1:09:47] you're coming up I got my
[1:09:50] papers now the powerful thing about this
[1:09:53] is when a seal comes upon something it
[1:09:55] actually tells you of an
[1:09:58] ownership now there's nothing greater
[1:10:00] about the Holy Ghost than this point
[1:10:01] right here it means you belong to
[1:10:04] God it means you are God's anointed it
[1:10:08] means you are God's Property when a man
[1:10:12] receives the Holy Ghost God sets a seal
[1:10:15] upon that person and the Bible said God
[1:10:18] told the devil touch not my anointed and
[1:10:22] do my prophets no harm let me tell tell
[1:10:25] you the god of Abraham stands behind
[1:10:27] this seal this morning amen and if a
[1:10:29] devil comes near you do you know you got
[1:10:31] a right to hold up your token and say
[1:10:34] Satan I refuse you in the name of Jesus
[1:10:37] Christ when Satan comes to hand you some
[1:10:39] awful Spirit you can look right in his
[1:10:41] face and say not in this house Satan
[1:10:44] this is a house of God I've got a sealed
[1:10:47] product here God has sealed me to the
[1:10:50] day of redemption get off of my property
[1:10:55] get off of my property I say Satan get
[1:10:58] off of my property I'm a Son of God I've
[1:11:01] been bought and paid for by the blood of
[1:11:04] the Lamb sealed by the Holy
[1:11:07] Ghost oh you don't like that well then
[1:11:09] watch this Hallelujah I believe in the
[1:11:12] power of God I believe in a God that can
[1:11:15] deliver I believe in a God that can save
[1:11:17] I believe in a God that can fill you
[1:11:20] with the Holy Ghost why can't we praise
[1:11:22] him why can't we shout a
[1:11:27] why can't we tell the
[1:11:29] devil you can't touch this it's sealed
[1:11:32] by
[1:11:34] God oh judgments are falling but we're
[1:11:38] rejoicing judgments are falling but
[1:11:41] we're having the power of
[1:11:46] God death is striking
[1:11:49] everywhere but not where that seal
[1:11:52] is death is striking homes but but not
[1:11:55] where that seal is death is striking
[1:11:57] churches but not where that seal
[1:12:02] is God forbids the
[1:12:06] devil W
[1:12:11] brother now you may think the devil is
[1:12:13] an all powerful
[1:12:15] one well you ain't met my Jesus
[1:12:20] yet that devil may have claws and you
[1:12:22] may have him imagined as being the Great
[1:12:25] and Powerful one that he is but my Bible
[1:12:28] said Jesus spoiled him at Calvary and he
[1:12:31] ripped him of his Armen it amen he took
[1:12:34] everything and even all the way 2,000
[1:12:37] years later when the seals were opened
[1:12:39] on the first seal the first night the
[1:12:43] prophet said there it is he's got a bow
[1:12:46] and no arrows amen 2,000 years later and
[1:12:50] he still doesn't have a weapon listen to
[1:12:53] me if you got the Seal of God God there
[1:12:56] is no weapon that is formed against you
[1:12:59] that shall prosper A thousand shall fall
[1:13:02] at one side and 10,000 the other but the
[1:13:05] plague shall not come n thy dwelling I
[1:13:08] say God give us the Holy Ghost pour it
[1:13:11] out with power upon the church seal it
[1:13:15] in Lord seal in every life seal in every
[1:13:19] heart I know I know you had tie-ins with
[1:13:22] the devil and I know you know how
[1:13:24] powerful he is and that's why I'm
[1:13:25] telling you get sealed
[1:13:27] in youve seen what he done to other
[1:13:29] lives but not the lives of a sealed in
[1:13:32] one he said preacher I tell you I think
[1:13:36] Satan can do anything he wants he
[1:13:39] can't he can only do what God allows him
[1:13:42] to
[1:13:43] do from the very beginning in Genesis
[1:13:46] the thir chapter Jesus told him there
[1:13:47] was a war between the woman seed in the
[1:13:49] serpent seed didn't he and he said You
[1:13:52] shall bruise his heel
[1:13:55] that speaks of the body but it's only
[1:13:58] the heel folks come on the devil can
[1:14:01] only bruise the heel you know what he's
[1:14:03] going to bruise the heel when you
[1:14:04] stepping on his head amen when you step
[1:14:07] oh he may he may bruise your heel but
[1:14:10] you're going to bruise his head he there
[1:14:13] may be a battle but it's just the heel
[1:14:16] that's all he can get the
[1:14:20] heel oh well I tell you he can do this
[1:14:22] and he can do that really look at the
[1:14:24] book of Jo
[1:14:26] before that devil could ever touch job
[1:14:30] couldn't touch him till he asked
[1:14:32] permission he said you got a you got a
[1:14:35] hedge build up around him do you see the
[1:14:38] secret of your life now even the devil
[1:14:41] knows you got a hedge and the devil
[1:14:44] would sift you with sand but he can't
[1:14:48] because Jesus prayed for you and he
[1:14:50] thank God for you
[1:14:55] in the Bible when the devil wanted to
[1:14:57] touch Joe Jo God fin said well go ahead
[1:14:59] and get after him if you want to but
[1:15:01] don't take his life amen even when he
[1:15:04] set the devil loose he still limited him
[1:15:07] the devil's on a chain brother he can
[1:15:09] only do what God lets him do before he
[1:15:12] ever touches a hair on your head he's
[1:15:15] got to get permission from God listen
[1:15:17] amen there's a Bible lay here there's a
[1:15:19] word laid here there's a seal Upon Our
[1:15:22] Lives we're not just open for the devil

[1:15:35] like to he would like to take everything
[1:15:37] you got he'd like to take all your joy
[1:15:39] he'd like to take all the grace out of
[1:15:41] your life amen but God has always
[1:15:44] remained true to his seal and his sign
[1:15:47] you are under the
[1:15:49] token it's just time to tell the devil I
[1:15:53] am under the token
[1:15:56] brother gersam it's time to sing Our
[1:15:58] Song The Blood
