amen I guess sister NE is with you there and God bless you all amen they come up for a very special day today amen um now youall know why I use a handheld mic amen so um these uh but uh it's a very special occasion today uh for the for the family amen of course we have uh a special baby dedication today Lucas and Molly they're going to be dedicating Co Cyrus uh boo I was uh just looking a little bit this morning or yesterday uh looking into the name of the baby and I thought it was so tremendous Amy man maybe just give me this M for now can't teach an old dog new tricks sorry amen um tell me it don't sound better brother Howard so um uh I was looking into this and uh the name cole actually means Victory um and I I thought wow that that's tremendous but the middle name of this baby uh Cyrus is a one of my old testament uh favorites he's a Persian king and he was one that led the Army uh that overthrew Babylon that released the children of Israel and um all the way in Isaiah 45 uh Isaiah was prophesying of him and calling the anointing and he was calling him Sirus Cyrus whose name have I Holden and even before he was born God was telling that he would make crooked places straight and that he would cut bars of iron asunder and uh one of the most beautiful Parts is is he said for Jacob my servant's sake and Israel mine elect he said I've called thee by name I have surnamed thee though thou Hast not known me and I am the Lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I GED thee that thou Hast not known me and God God named this Persian king hundreds of years before he was ever used and I was always amazed that when Babylon fell that this king would have rode into town somebody had ask him what your name is they'd have took the Scrolls out and they said yeah here he is in Prophecy right here that God knew his name a long time before he did and you know brother brandham actually told us that God knew these babies before the foundation of the world Amen and we're so thankful today Amen to be able to dedicate them back to the Lord as amen and uh so if we could this morning we want to invite Amen brother Ken and and uh sister Nita and brother Greg sister kimbley and Luke and Molly and Lucas and Molly and bring up that little baby and amen um we we like to make it a family affair because raising a baby is a family affair amen amen and uh it's such a blessing to have them here today amen just a moment here thank you amen God bless you guys certainly in honor do we get to be a part of this amen and we just bow our hearts together if we could this morning Heavenly Father father we're so blessed to be able to hold little Cole in our hands Lord and father that you've put your name upon him Lord and even you knew him before he knew you Lord and father you ordained him Lord for this life and we ask you as we hold him now that we bring him back to you this morning we dedicate him to you father you said suffer not the little children that they would be brought unto you and we bring them to you this morning to dedicate them Lord that that may you set your angels about him Lord may you bless him oh God may you bless his comings and his goings and father may you anoint him Lord to be a man's servant of yours God if it be in your plan it'd be wonderful for him to raise up to preach this wonderful gospel we ask you for your mercy upon his life and upon these families Lord that come this morning we commit him and dedicate him to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you King he's already a king isn't he he's already speaking amen God bless you God bless you all amen amen amen what a tremendous thing to see God raise children up among Believers amen amen do we have brother will here this morning we want to uh just take a moment and welcome our brother will Davis Amen to be a part of the assembly God bless you brother will we'd like to welcome him God bless you brother brother Will's been coming a little while and he talked to us Thursday and said brother Wayne we're we're going to make this our home for sure so amen I'm so thankful amen that uh we pray God would be a a blessing to you and through this sanctuary and through these people amen you're very welcome amen and uh it's a it's a great honor this morning of course to be able to uh say that brother Donnie Reagan and sister Carol Reagan are with us amen it's a it was a great honor I I didn't say much about it in the Youth Camp of course but um brother uh brother Donnie and I had spoke a little bit In the Heat of what Bethany was going through um she was having some pretty severe um effects of kind of like a a non-epileptic seizure and she was having some very very strong seizures and I would speak to brother R brother Donnie and and ask him if he had some time to come and pray for her and U he said brother Wayne I don't have time he said but I'm going to make time and so we certainly appreciate this man of God just dropping what he was doing and making a moment to come and amen I know the Holy Spirit was moved so powerfully yesterday and and we're so thankful for them to come amen and it's such a blessing you know uh when God sends a man of God among you you all know amen that we're about to hear from Heaven amen we're about to hear from Heaven uh you know the prophet said this he said the greatest and highest form there is for God to give a message to his people is to believe the word and that's the highest form preaching is the highest form and when a minister walks into this congregation and the people are praying and the anointing of the spirit he said you are bound to hear from Heaven amen how many you'd like to hear from Heaven this morning do you know God chose men to do that he didn't choose the stars or the Suns and it would be more advantageous if he did because they would be without failures without the human Veil but God chose men to preach the gospel and brother Bram went so far to say that he chose man to preach and that's where his voice will come from he went on to say that this is a man is a transmitter of the voice of God and that's the agency he chooses that's why all the preaching and the teaching that happens brother Bram says so the sheep can hear the voice of God and follow him this is a channel God consecrates a channel to speak to a congregation he'll use a channel you use a man and brother brand actually says this is the apostolic way of holding a meeting is to preach the gospel and the people that believe that are touched and healed and moved upon and this morning we we want to take a few moments here as we invite our brother we want to ask the Lord just to use him in a mighty way amen we all respect brother Donnie's he's been a committed channel to this message for years and years but we what we really want to do is activate the gift of God you know some said I have a need this morning but brother Donnie didn't hear my need but you know there's the Bible said that the word of God God is a discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart and he might not personally know but that gift in him does and the word of God can cross right across your path and when it does don't you Hold Your amen you reach out and say Lord thank you for that thank you for touching my life I appreciate you speaking to me amen we need to hear God speak those Supernatural words that changes our existence in our life won you stand with us this morning as we welcome brother Donnie to come amen we want to we want to ask him to come and take his Liberty amazing great How Sweet the Sound let [Music] sing like me I once was lost but now I'm was blind but now I [Applause] see through many dangers oh through many the ders for and s i oh his grace and we sa the star and Grace oh praise God praise God oh praise God let's praise him together PR God oh praise God [Music] praise God thank you Lord Jesus praise God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God oh praise God praise God praise the Lord want to be awesome When We Gather that day with the saints of God that have lived down Through the Ages and we all begin to sing those songs of redemption the prophet tells us that actually whenever that happens that the angels will encircle the Earth and they will have to bow their heads because they don't understand that Peter said it was so great that it was something that the angels of God desired to look into and that word means to stoop down and to look in intently they look at you every day and they Ponder and wonder about the Holy Ghost in you and how God leads your life and molds you and shapes you can you imagine we are the Marvel of angels amen God bless you so nice to be with you today I've preached in a lot of different places all over the world but for my own feeling um this has always been one of my favorite places to come and preach up in this part of the country been friends with brother Ericson and his family for many many years and then brother Wayne as well and just so happy to see what God is doing doing in your midst can we just bow our heads together and [Music] pray Lord Jesus we can't speak about that great day without about it moving our hearts thinking about what a time it's going to be when there'll be no more sorrow no more sickness no more pain no more suffering father until that time we need your strength to help us each day you know the needs of all these people that are represented here today Father and only you could custom fit a sermon that would' be able to meet the needs of every one of them I pray that you'd shut my mouth to anything that would displease you make me sensitive Lord that I could follow you if if someone would have a need and maybe it would feel to me I'm going out of lines or off the topic Lord God sometimes it only takes a word or two or three and their life can be changed so help me to be sensitive to you father we thank you for the opportunity once again to stand before your people ask your blessings on the assembly here the pastor the deacons trustees all the board Lord the leoty bless them Father keep them for this hour we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you I'm still a baby you see have not been saved that long uh Carolyn I turned 68 a few weeks ago and I gave my heart to the Lord whenever I was 12 so I've not been saved that long really I started preaching whenever I was 18 so I've been preaching 50 years now I ain't really been preaching that long either now I say all that so that whenever I make mistakes you'll understand I'm just a kid in reality it's something about preaching you know that you realize I preached thousands of sermons around the world brother Wayne has brother Ericson has and neither one of us have ever preached a perfect one because it's the human element but I always Marvel that God could take something so frail as as humans and be able to speak to others and one day we'll look around and we'll see them there in eternity won't that be an awesome time I'd also like to say my wife Carol's with me today and we want to thank you for praying for our our daughter Erica I know that y'all did many many times and we're so grateful for that we thank you for praying for us after the Lord and his wisdom he it was his plan to take her home and um we thank you for remembering us we're still dealing with all that of course Erica left behind her husband and two sets of twin girls they were up here for the Youth Camp that y'all just had and U we certainly appreciate your continued praise for that and if anybody tells you that she's dead you tell them that ain't the truth she's very alive today amen let's turn to the Song of Solomon if you would this morning chapter 3 verse 6 song Solomon 3: 6 I don't know if you're aware of this or not but the Song of Solomon by the Hebrews is called the holy of holies and they actually will not let their children read The Song of Solomon until they become adults because it can seem to be very intimate and very open and forward but we believe that there's spiritual truth that lays in God's word aren't we glad for that where a person could read the Bible every day of their life and no doubt there's theologians in the world that know the Bible probably better than we do U as far as that sort of thinking but our main focus is we know the author will well so that gives us a special understanding let's read together down to um verse n if you would Song of Solomon chapter 3 verse 6 who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrr and frankincense was all powders of the merchant behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men are about it of the Valiant of Israel they all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh now listen to reason why because of fear in the night King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of of Lebanon may the Lord bless his words you may be seated I'd like to speak to you for a while this morning on bring her home safely bring her home safely we are told that Solomon was out when he became king taking a tour of this land of Israel he begins of course in Jerusalem and goes to the north it goes to the East toward the Mediterranean goes to the West toward the Great River and South toward Egypt remember this man was granted wisdom like no other the man on the earth had ever been given but he had also been given a charge to build a house for God but it also been given a special name by God himself now Solomon of course we know was born between David and bath Sheba and he was given quite a charge even by his father his father could not build the temple of God because he had blood on his hands but David was called to get gather all the material together so much of the material before his passing David had gathered so that the house of God could be built and he was many years in building the house of God and then also his own house but we know that Solomon being a king he had many marriages and those marriages many times were not based on love but they were based on politics so if he needed an alliance with the king from Lebanon he might Marry The King's Daughter if he needed an alliance from another country where they had the gold of oor as it's called or if they needed Cedars from Lebanon then they would make a marriage and that marriage stood as an alliance so it was a political stronghold in the Kingdom but then we realize that in the song of that it was a marriage about another woman it was not a political union it was not one that would benefit him politically as a matter of fact it was it would be identified through the people of that day as a marriage of humility because he's out riding in his Chariot and his great men were with him beside him watching over him of course his bodyguards and he happened to see her she was dark but comely to the women of that day to be dark skinned meant you were out in the sun so the the fair women the lighter skinned women they were the ones that a lot of Kings would want it was a sign they didn't have to tall in the fields and tend the flocks and the Sheep but when he saw her his heart was smitten with her but she was a poor girl and didn't have much that she could be able to give him so when Solomon saw her and was Smitten by her in so much that as we read in the song of Solomon he says turn your eyes away from me for one of your eyes one of your eyes has taken me and that word taken is to be held a captive when we look at ourselves this morning and realize that in number we are very small in comparison to the world comparison to the World Church but you see there's something about his elect lady that caught his attention and she actually did it before the foundation of the world Solomon had been given great wisdom as far as building and being able to devise and he was u a a Creator an artisan also Specialties in wood and in metals and things like that so the verse seven here says that behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men are about it now this bed is not what you would think it was not so much a place to sleep but the Hebrew word there is metall so it was a couch or a buyer or it was a also called a litter so it comes from the word to stretch out so it would have been for a one individual only and he builds this this is his transport his means they didn't have Tesla or Chevrolet or Ford or any of that in that day so it would have been his bodyguards and they would have carried him from one place to another so it just so happens that he on his metall in the Indians the East Indians it would have been called a Peloquin so on this Peloquin there would have been several different types of material that would have been used to build it there would have been several colors that would have reflected what the king saw so he was quite an artisan himself so he actually builds this himself so behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men are about it the Valiant of Israel so it being a matal a l of pacquin it was a covered couch and it had little tiny columns which would have been fluted and it had all these beautiful colors that would have been on it so the idea is that it is a comfortable means of Transport for the king to be out while he's surveying his kingdom no doubt he got weary and tired of of of so much building and so much improvising and so much things that he had to do being King I'm sure it was a difficult job and one way that he would want to do it was that he loved nature and he loved Gardens so whenever he would be out and about and I've been in in Israel maybe many of you have as well and on some of the places it's it's very Barren hardly any trees hardly any plants at all and there was other parts the Galilee and the northern part uh very beautiful trees grass so he would take this journey and take a few days off is would say to go to the mountains of course in the north part is Mount Hermon action they get snow there because of the elevation so it would have been quite a reprieve from the land where he was at and where his labor and all of his thoughts was totally consumed so let's just say that it must have been on one of those trips that he saw her and when he did now remember he was used to having Queens in his court every day it was the princes of the known civilization the monarchs the ambassadors of Kingdoms he was used to being catered to used to being all Royal Highness your majesty and maybe she was out in the field tending the Sheep trestles of hair hanging down her back and it was hot maybe that day and she reached up to wipe the her face and remove the sweat but there was an all about her a beauty that when he saw her it put a mark on him that he would never get over so she realizes who this is and he tells his men to take him over to where she's at she's probably never even been in the presence of a king before all she knew was common folk Farmers ranchers sheep herders people like that but could you imagine whenever the the men they watch his mannerisms and they know it's time to stop the Peloquin so he bids them to Halt and he steps down now they're going to lower it down so that he can be able to step out and her heart starts racing her face flushing cuz her clothes she looks so pitiful and by now she is she is so nervous and so anxious but he comes up to her and said how are you she say my king my great king she's ashamed to look at him she don't know how to talk to again kind of reminds me of our Prophet before he got saved that he wanted to get right with God but he didn't know how so he wrote God a letter and put it out on a tree that might have been some of you some of us I wasn't raised in church and I didn't know how to get saved so before I went to my uncle's church and give my heart to God I had asked my mom mama how do you get saved she had just given her heart to the Lord a couple of weeks before that and I saw a change in her but I'd never talked to him before my wife sitting here today was 16 years old before she ever heard the story of Daniel and the Lions did she had never heard the story of Noah in the ark you see how fortunate some of you young people are to be raised in a message Church you cut your teeth on message pews but if you're here today a heathen from one Heathen to another don't worry there's Hope For You [Applause] Hallelujah so there must have been an agreement made and he tells her I'll send my Chariot back for you at the appointed time so we'll move we'll move up in in time now Solomon sends her word she still can't believe that it's true she's going to be married to the king now we don't know her Hebrew name but what we know that she's a dentified by is shulamite now I find this very interesting that the word shulamite is the feminist form of Solomon somebody ought to be shouting about right [Laughter] now so he renames her and gives her the feminist form of his name you see it wasn't just by chance that you happened to be here today it wasn't just by Chance the day the night the morning that you gave your heart to God and maybe you had no plans on even going to church but God had plans on you going our life friends is in his hands and you may be going through some of the greatest trials you've ever been through in your life today but let me remind you almighty God knows your name he knows your address he knows what you're going through and you let that devil know he has not forgotten you you may be praying and you don't feel him you may be going to church and it doesn't seem like it does you any good but he knows who you are he knows what you're going through he has not forgotten you so according to their custom and the protocol of this time it would have been Unbecoming to a Middle East Eastern King to have actually went down and got her and brought her back home and remember my title bring her safely home so when we pick up on the Song of Solomon in this chapter actually what's going on is that Solomon is sending men Amen to bring the shulamite home I'd like to speak to every godall preacher in this building today and say Brothers I'm the very least to tell you but we have been given one of the greatest charges that any mortal could ever be given to bring God's bride safely home it's not about me it's not about any other preacher how great we can preach how big our ministry is it's not about that it's about trying to find her trying to encourage her trying to get her saved if she ain't saved trying to get her filled with the Holy Ghost if she don't have the Holy Ghost trying to preach the word to her that'll help her grow and become what God wants her to be we are facing the greatest challenge of any generation that's ever lived on the the face of the Earth what is that the body change can you imagine we are looking for something and expecting it are we not the greatest event after the resurrection of our Lord Jesus that has ever hit the earth in a moment and a twinkling of an eye thousands or hundreds of thousands or how many ever that it will be that the power of God will sweep over the Earth and we shall be changed [Applause] oh Hallelujah now I'm trying to be nice and behave myself till at least I get the foundation laid and then after that I'm not responsible for my [Applause] actions so Solomon tells these men I want you to take my personal Peloquin and go bring her back you see we are not we are not just church members and don't misunderstand me when I say it this way we're not just following a prophet and we're not just people say well I I believe the message all kinds of people will believe the message that will not be there every devil in hell believes God sent a prophet he whooped the tar out of them they ought to know amen ain't that right he'll talk these people into leaving the message but the devil knows better that's exactly right amen you can imagine now that they make the agreement and a betroll the one it was made in in among the Jews it lasted anywhere from 9 months to a year to make sure sure she was not with seed of another man when a boy was born they would plant a tree in memory of him when a girl was born they'd plant a tree in memory of her then they would grow and grow those trees would when they would get old enough to become at the marriage age they would cut that tree down his tree and her tree and then they would make four posts out of those trees and they would stretch a canopy over that over that so they could the bride and the groom could walk in and they would finish their vows they would actually enter into an betral and they would signed it both of them signed it they would take a cup of wine and drink that wine and they were bound and they would wait until Matthew chapter 25 if you know the marriage ceremony the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened under 10 virgins five were wives fire were foolish and then we know that story and whenever he's giving us the exact thing of what it would be so the bridegroom would send a messenger to the bride's house she didn't even know what day it was but he'd tell her be ready in this certain week so he would send a messenger a prophet would call it he would send a messenger to let her know today is the day get ready so you know what the bride would be ready the bridegroom would send a message and go get her and bring her back where to his house take her from her house to to his house now you realize that the devil is going to do everything he can after we believe the revealed word of this hour to get us to question it to get us so busy with the things of life that we get so busy not horrible sinful things just so busy with life itself how many knows that the truth we've only got 24 hours in the day and yet it seems like there's more things to occupy our time than probably any generation that has ever been on the Earth but I want to let the devil know and I want to let hell know he's not going to stop this bride from being ready because there's something inside of us that's been gerti by the spirit of God it will not hinder the bride of Christ so Solomon sends his own means of transport this is the people that's going to leave this world in the Rapture you got to be riding the same power that Jesus wrote it ain't enough to say I go to church I believe this I believe that you got to have power to get out of here how did he come to the Earth by his own life his own power remember Rebecca whenever Rebecca went down unwatered the camels oh my and one of them camels could drink multiple gallons of water at one time I I calculated him in a while back it was unbelievable the trips that she had to go back and forth back and forth giving praise or water to that Camel that's right the prophet said ler did she know that very camel that she was watering was the same one that was going to pack her to her bridegroom you see God wants us to praise him and he don't want us just to do it in church he wants you to do it on the job he wants you to do it when you're driving down the road when you're going to school he loves to be praised if you could only realize today one of these days that same holy ghost that we're giving praise to is going to send a sweep over our bodies and we're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye oh Hallelujah it makes me want to praise him it makes me want to worship him and bless his name because I'm going to be riding the same power that Jesus [Applause] wrote so the king sends his own means of transportation so how did Jesus rais from the dead the Holy Ghost how did Jesus rise up on the mount and be changed Jesus had a body change remember whenever they laid that body in the Tomb raising him from the dead was not enough right cuz remember the prophet said he looked like he was about 50 years old so you understand you understand the Lord Jesus also had to have a body change because he does not look like a 50 year old man now that's he had scars he had this and that and the other so oh Hallelujah he had to experience a body change that not only would raise him from the dead but would remove him his human aging and the scars that was placed there by bearing our lo oh I wish some somebody would preach with me this morning the Lord Jesus experienced a body change and what was it that changed it the power of God and the same power of God one of these days hallelujah in a moment in the twinkling of an ey will Sweep All Over the Earth and every child of God that has the token every child of God that has the true baptism of the Holy Ghost will move into the power Quin of the Lord [Music] Jesus I love emotion but emotion ain't enough I love shouting but shouting ain't enough even Miracles ain't enough we've got to have the personal life Oh Glory to God glory to God so theing King sends his own means of Transport so it is his will then that his chosen would be with him where he is now it's actually a several day Journey from where she lives to where Jerusalem was now I want you to notice who he sends to bring her back home it was not MP3 players right it was not tap players that's right come [Applause] on hey I believe in MP3s I play them I've got them on my phone I've got this I've got you know I've got all that and I believe in listening to the message of the hour and I believe in pressing play but when I press play I hear quotes like this you know I see myself here as an old man he said I see my end out yonder and he said I know that these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus also hear him say what we need in this hour is Men Of God filled with the Holy Ghost that'll get in the pull pit and preach the word come on somebody now when I was a young man I fulfilled that other quote but I'm still fulfilling this one I'm still preaching ain't a young man no longer I'm an old man but I'm looking any day to be changed back to a young man praise the Lord how is it going to be the same power of God that raised our lord Jesus from the dead the same power of God that come over that human body and change him from a 50-year looking old man to a young man the King of Kings the Lord of lords Hallelujah so the couch of Solomon will bear the the bride to Jerusalem the cross of our Lord Jesus the power of the Cross will carry you over let me tell you we don't just stop at the cross come on now we believe in the cross thank God for the cross but preaching the cross alone is not enough well come on somebody them 12 Apostles they believed in the cross and they preached the cross but they did not stop at the cross but they preached what the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh what a thing it must have been when those men show up at her door and she looks out there and there is some of the greatest men of the Kingdom 60 of them that Valiant swords on their thighs scars oh my you imagine her trying to learn now having an idea of when it was going to be and she's just a country girl so down in my part of the country we say hit and ha and tote and fetch and bat now I know you Northerners bless your heart you all don't talk like that but can you imagine how difficult it must have been for her to start talking the king's language you see some of us are still talking slave language I'm not worthy I'm not good enough I can never be good enough why would God love me I've I've made so many mistakes I've fallen so short of the glory of God come on somebody your confession in Christ Jesus should not be you're not good enough you're not rich enough you're ugly you're whatever more your confession should be not what you are in the flesh but what he has done for you that's right the human part I'm not worthy but he made me worthy he offered you Grace he offered you Mercy he offered you forgiveness but I made so many mistakes so have I but he offers me pardon for my mistakes and I'm going to take it if he offers me eternal life I'm going to take [Applause] it so this little lady from this area where she was from going to be called to the court of the king and his magnificence I found it amazing when you look at the number here that there was actually 60 Warriors that would come to get her and there was 600,000 that encamped about the ark protecting the way to life and what does Solomon do you imagine him going after and say hey uh Eeny Mo which one of you wants to go I mean that kind of make you feel a little bit funny wouldn't it girls you know about the husband sends a guy that don't even know which end of a sword to use Hallelujah you don't even what a sword is no oh he picking men Oh my he picked men that were valant the most Valiant in Israel now we know the Lord does not want us to make ey out of preachers but I thank God for every true God call man in this message that labors to bring the word what they go through what their families go through what their wives go through don't you how I appreciate them oh I want to be standing there that day when the Lord Jesus when we walk before him and the prophet of God stands there and presents the age and then it'll be broken down into you know the different churches and the different groups and the minist Min I want to be standing near when the men of God in this age that I have been privileged to preach with and preach for when they walk up there you're going to hear me you're going to hear me I guarantee you I'm going to be screaming hard glory to God there goes brother Wayne Hallelujah there goes brother Tim there goes brother brother Nathan there goes Brother s Ando there goes brother Joe there goes brother Jim whoever they are and they will walk up there and the Lord Jesus look at them and say my brothers you brought her safely home I see what it cost you lonely nights as a preacher I can tell you the majority of my burdens in life have been because of God's people the majority of what I've went through for decades in my life all the takes us one phone call or a text and everything changes I got one of those last night and then I got one yesterday because your your heart is part of your people I'm talking about when you're a pastor even when you're an evangelist you may not know them individually but there's something God gives you you imagine he handpicked all these 60 behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men about it of the Valiant of Israel so it was common practice for the Grooms friends friends what an honor the groom's friends to go bring the bride back but they were also the most noble trustworthy this girl is a virgin they do not desire for her to bring forth their image that's right I hate to say it but let me just say it for a few minutes and then we'll go on we've had too many preachers around this message that have wanted to message people to be like them well come on somebody you don't want to be a reaganite you don't want to be a lonite you want to be a Christian son or daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost is that right that's exactly what God wants and he's trusting his his wife's very virtue one woman with 60 men one woman I tell you one thing I've met some men in this message I wouldn't want to be around my wife well praise the Lord Lord come on now don't sit there and look at me funny but you imagine Solomon scream these guys he knew them in battle he knew them as far as all that goes I remember this man was going to trust her protocol would not let his feet touch the Earth Hallelujah now I'm talking about the Lord Jesus right amen so he will not come in the Rapture and stand on this Earth but by ranks we will join together when the dead are raised and we'll start getting together and the prophet said all of a sudden a sweeper come over you you see the bride's used to sweeping she fulfills one of those Parables that Jesus gave whenever the bride had lost part of her coins in the tablet so the bride is used to sweeping so she got down on her knees and she's sweeping here and sweeping there Hallelujah you see people around the message who don't like sweeping won't be swept away but it's those that well Hallelujah it's those that are used to sweep sweeping you ever lost a little bit of your joy and a little bit of your peace and a little bit of this and that you have to go to sweep and Lord where's it at where's my joy where's my happiness Lord what's wrong with me Lord what are you doing your sweeping Saints well maybe if you're here and you're like that today and the joy that you had 5 years ago a year ago it just ain't there maybe it's time for you to get your broom out of the closet and say all right devil I'm sick and tired of you stealing my joy I'm sick and tired of you stealing my healing I'm tired of you stealing my family you're not getting my son you're not getting my daughter Hallelujah you're not getting my wife or my husband I'm going after him in the name of Jesus what with this broom this broom right here that's what I'm going after hallelujah oh you just imagine her she finally gets the courage and she say that's for that's for me wow oh I don't know if I can I'm not worthy I'm not good enough now there's no way now she's going to have to believe what she believes about herself or she's going to have to believe the evidence that he sent for her this is for you sweetheart this is for you oh my goodness but what if I get it dirty I so you tell me this is his no one else has has said on this but him no one my lady he sent this back for you and you shall receive power yes sir after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you I just like to send hell another notification this morning you guys are losing in case you don't know it we are the winners We Are The [Applause] Victors so after a youth camp they find a convinc her to get in so here they go and maybe she's kind of nervous you know thinking I'm just asking that he says uh excuse me excuse me I I hate to bother you all but could could you all could you all tell me what's it like to be in his presence I'm not just talking about coming and going like a church member of not I'm talking about what what's it like to live around him every day and live in his court and eat that seven course meal CU you see I I was I was raised at Pentecostal so I ate Shucks I Chucks everywh you could fix them fried refried cooked boiled microwaved Zapped air fry but when the Lord Jesus called me to this great message in the last days I've been sitting at a feast every day of my life aren't you grateful to be sitting at the table with the King [Applause] himself you imagine one of me spoke up and said oh my lady he said you have to call me that I I'm I'm just no we were instructed by the king to call you after royalty I wonder if that's why the prophet in the seal said I no longer call you church but I call you bride oh my lady have you ever been to Jerusalem oh no i' no we're we're poor I've never I've never been there maybe by now she's kind of feeling a little bit I kind of like this pacquin thing or whatever it was he said matar or maton or Melvin or something that I mean boy Excuse me yes my lady do y'all have anything to eat eat we sure do and we have something to drink too water from the rock so y y'all this this is this is going to be a several day Journey y'all knew that right oh yes the king is aware of that my lady so you did fix me something to eat yeah faith is the substance 1947 at Thy word 1948 deity of Jesus Christ 1949 God in his people 1950 Jas the secret believer 1951 believe in God 1952 question answers on Genesis 1954 the unpardonable sin which helped you to realize you didn't commit it in 195 4 1955 who is this mezic mezic King and priest 1956 Perfection 1957 the Hebrew series 1958 oh I wish somebody would preach with me this morning the serpent SE 1959 the Holy Ghost series 1960 The patmas Vision 1961 Hallelujah Revelation chapter 5 part 2 1962 take inze with Jesus 1963 the breach 1963 God in Simplicity the Seven Seals Victory Day hallelujah hallelujah what's it for to feed the bride to get her ready Hallelujah but let me say to you today little bride you not only have pastors evangelists and teachers and all that but you have other guards whenever Jacob had had his great Supernatural experience and he called the name of that place May anim May anim and the meaning is the place of two camps Jacob's camp and the Angelic Camp can you imagine after that experience that he goes and he makes an altar and he prays and he calls the name of that place L eloh is Israel L Elohim Israel what in the world got a hold to that man that he would name the altar of the merging together of God's name and his L elohi Israel God the god of Israel I'll tell you friends we've said it long enough where is the Lord God of Elijah we need to start saying where's my God where's your God where's your God where's your God oh God don't want us to live in history yes God moved for brother brandom thank God that he did and God moved for Paul but it's time that you and I realize he's not just the god of brother brandom he's not just the god of Elijah he is your god he is your here hallelujah he is your deliverer he is your salvation he is your king God did not send us for brother brandham God sent brother brandham for us there's three categories in Malachi 4:5 and a lot of folks leave out two of them but God anointed Malachi to say that behold I God send unto Elijah the prophet so God the people and Elijah must fil fulfill Malachi 4:5 I am the reason the seals needed to be opened I am the reason the Rapture message Hallelujah needed to be preached you are the reason of all the burdens that the prophet bore aren't you glad we had a prophet of God that was willing to stand up in this day in spite of all of the unbelief and all that was there and preach the word Why Oh my he was the one in charge of the Guard he was the one in charge of the Guard what's he going to do he's going to prepare by Revelation what the Guardsmen are going to need to feed the [Applause] bride notice this in Psalms 34:7 the angel of the Lord Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivers him Matthew 18:10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that In Heaven There Angels do behold the face of My Father which is in heaven and Jacob Genesis 32:1 went his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place may I name him notice this in Song of Solomon again verse 7 behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men are about it of the Valiant of Israel but it speaks of a perilous Journey their swords are on their thighs which means it's hanging here and the Bible tells us why because of the night the darkness it's around us everywhere you know it yeah anybody here be honest with me today and say you've never had such a time in your life as far as hardships and troubles and difficulty look friends I'm I'm in contact with people around the world it's unbelievable the things that people are going through in the age we get in remember how it was years ago oh my you go through a a valley in a low place and you get up on the mountain top man aive that mountain top I mean it just seemed like it went on and on and on and then you go down to the valley woo there you was back up again on that mountain top oh you're just up there oh glory to God everything was so beautiful there you go but it seems like something has happened it seems like it's like this and oh oh oh oh Lord have mercy Lord have mercy woo I bad in my and I missed the mountain oh my goodness oh no and then you go and go and go and go who you bat your eyes again I'm telling you better keep your eyes open you know what I'm talking about what is it it's the powers of Darkness that's pressing against this brde like never before Oh but I'll tell you we can read the back of the book and we found out we win this thing Hallelujah we win it's not probably it's not maybe you are going to win and the life enemy that shall be destroyed is death Lord God put on the whole armor of God 1962 this is one of them quotes whenever I press play that I hear God fortified his army with what himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think of what God's offices in the church is it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet Seer foresee before Satan ever gets to it what is it God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress one we when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelist what is that that's God's dress wear God's presence right oh my I just imagine that Satan and all of his army the prophet said the only weapon that he has is to try to get you to doubt your weapon that's right that's right we believe his word do we not and yet Sometimes When We Get Low and we do everything we know to do have you ever been to that spot where it seemed like God was a million miles away he wouldn't hear your prayer and maybe somebody you work with is as world is all get out and maybe they're religious and they say well God answer my prayer God answered my prayer praise the Lord God heal me God done this and that ain't it amazing how testimonies can be discouraging is that right sis cuz you saying Lord have you forgot where I live if you forgot hey I've been slow at times I've been I've been glad I've been glad and happy just to hear rebuke from him to to just let me know he still knows I'm alive oh I see right now I ain't the only one that's felt well y'all felt the same way haven't you but then what do we do we serve him anyhow because we're not serving him for the fishes and the loaves we're not serving him for the Mana we're serving him because we love him and if he wants to try me let him try me but job said when I am tried I shall come forth like [Applause] gold listen to this in verse eight they all hold swords being expert in War I don't mind telling you I have been one blessed man when I went to school I was so laughed at and ridiculed and made fun of because I was a Christian I never had any friends I still I had a flashback here just a week or so ago I was in the second grade and I was standing out on the playground at school wishing I had a friend well that didn't just happen in second grade that was in third fourth fifth 6th 7th 8th n9th 10th then there some boys said they like me and I thought wow I've got I got some friends cuz we was raised poor you say I wore britches to school that looked like a dog had a hold of them when they wasn't in style [Applause] I used to wear them red Dollar Store tennis shoes that cost a dollar a pair when they wasn't in style so I was the laughing stock ridicule laughed at made fun of and then a few boys said they like me but let me just give you an idea what my friends were like they would bring Playboy magazines to school and try to get me to look at them and I'd close my eyes and then they jump on top of me lay me down in the floor and take their fingers and try to pull my eyes open like this and they were my friends you can imagine how my enemies treated me so I've always wanted friends I have I've always wanted friends and God has let me be friends with some of the greatest men of God of this age I am so blessed thank you for being my friend I'm sure I'm not the only one there's probably people sting here today that you were the outcast and rejected and nobody liked you because of your looks or your wealth or your family status or whatever more but Jesus found you one day and he sent his pacquin the baptism of the Holy Ghost your way every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night but the Donnie do you get afraid humanly I do I do CU we've never been this way before we've never seen things we're going through now before but I've learned a way to calm my fears feed on the word and quote that devil God's word cuz he can't stand it amen so now remember they're going there's not an interstate 75 and they not an Interstate 71 and you know state troopers going up and down the thorough fire you know to keep an eye on everybody there's Bandits there's thieves there's robbers there's all kinds of things you imagine when they saw that cuz remember the elements that was on this Peloquin gold deity silver Redemption brass judgment being judged the colors of purple blue royalty Heavenly oh my Scarlet which was made from a little insect which of what they made the The Veil The Temple out of a Ilia cus a little bitty tiny tiny insect and they could get one drop one drop of dye out of the female's body not the male one tiny drop you imagine how many that it took to make all them curtains and Dy them all red Hallelujah the blue come from a mollusk out of the Mediterranean don't you from the Animal Kingdom from the kingdom of botney life from the kingdom of the Stars the kingdom of the Dust God is drawing all of that together into the bride's Journey back home even the Tabernacle was made of some of those same things and God picked you talking about the mystery of God that God picked the Batcher you talking about a mean little fella some of you ought to say Amen cuz you were hopefully you still ain't oh my can you imagine imagine taking two live Badgers and sewing their skins together to make a covering for god well you see that's what the denominations are trying to do by making members out of a church but we don't do it that way this is the way we preach it you got to die well Glory I said you got to die and whenever you die to yourself then a man of God can take you and your hide and sew you right next to somebody else in the same church if it wasn't for this message some of us wouldn't even speak to one another we don't even belong in the same class sometime but this word has the ability of reaching out and getting the fancy and the rich and the Knuckleheads and the knads and save them all and sanctify them all and fill them with the Holy Ghost and what will it make up the mystical body of Jesus Christ they must have had to take it in shifts cuz it's several days journey so there's going to be some lean nights you see there's one thing that we have to watch about the lean nights I call it the leodan flu you read the message to the church age and you know that's what it was they had a flu it was a lay of the sea and flu so they're not at theirself they don't know who they are and they don't know this and that and the other so we're living in a day when a man don't know if he's a man or a woman don't know if she's a woman and today they're a dog and tomorrow they're a cat and you know the next thing say oh Lord come on somebody don't sit there and look at me true so there was perils everywhere you imagine at the Knights y'all know how the nights SS are right I was in zimb several years ago on a on a hunt some of the brothers out wanted to take me on a hunt and I was living saying in this little cabin by myself and the guy told me and there said now don't go out at night I said why he said cuz there's a leopard that roams around here I said you don't have to worry about me going out brother don't you lack en courage well I might like a little bit of Courage but I have got some common sense so about 3: in the morning I hear this noise I sat straight up in the bed my hair is kind of wild anyway so I'm just standing up on the back of my neck I'm thinking oh Lord have mercy what in the world and there was no locks on the doors so it went around and around it's kind of a round shaped building so the next morning I couldn't wait to see that guy and I said man I think I heard that leopard he said what kind of noise was he making I just made that same sound for you he said it was an [Applause] anater but you know what I thought that's the way the devil wants to do you and I oh I'm G to get you this time I'm G to get you you're down you ain't getting back up remember it ain't nothing but a yellow belly coward devil come on somebody he's got a bow but he ain't got no Iris he ain't got no power over you as a child of God for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the [Applause] world let me hurry let's speed this up a little bit I can see them as there coming in on the last day along this journey she's learned many things no doubt the first day she kind of got in that thing know she just got a worm but they noticed her the last day and they said wow she's getting ready for him you see as pastors that's what we watch your walk your everyday walk they don't ready impress pastors not not real ones how much you can quote the message or quote the Bible or taugh the great deep things of God it's the way you love your wife way you love your husband the way you love the house of God you love to come to church and you can't wait to come to the house of God so that's what impresses Real Men of God is your is your walk and in that short Journey no doubt they noticed an air about her y'all have heard the story I'm sure brother bisco told it many years ago about the the bride that was worth nothing until the man paid all those cows for her let me tell you how much you're worth if I this morning had this bottle right here full of the literal blood of the Lord Jesus well no doubt each one of you'd want to come up here and touch it and you just say oh my oh my so if this young brother here wanted to touch it and I started to hand it to him and I whenever I do it slips out of my hand I said oh no oh no but you are actually worth more than the blood of Jesus I know it's mindboggling because that's what he was willing to pay to get you so after church you go to restaurant sit down you look at the menu value versus cost cost is really high anymore a so you'll sit there and look at you think do I want us to pay that much for that chicken sandwich do I want to pay that much for f steak do I want to pay that much so it's all about value what you'll get out of it and then some of you say I ain't paying that much for that I'm going to go second down on the list and get this but Jesus looked at it and said it's worth every pain hallu Hallelujah and the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews that he feared the Lord Jesus experienced fear I'm glad so when I get afraid I can go to a high priest Hall and he won't berate me he won't you know just blast me but he can say I understand on I understand but I died alone so you don't have toly I died a curse out of the presence of spirit God so that when you die y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou W with me thy rod and thy sta they comfort me she's now meditating and thinking oh my so it's about 50 miles from shunum to Jerusalem 50 miles five of course number of CRA the Church of the Living God is called often pass through Dark starless Nights weary times of loneliness you see it doesn't take a person with very great faiths to be able to come up and receive healing and Oh Glory to God every time I pray God answer my prayer and people think that's great faith but actually I use this example over and over again of sister sasc who prayed that God would restore her baby back to life God told the prophet you leave it alone don't touch it she saw him later and asked brother Brenham the question brother Brenham did I not have faith he said sister you had great faith for when God said no you still believed him he say man my wife stood there October the day Erica's youngest twins their birthday was that day and she passed that night it was so unexpected the doctors was not believing that she would nobody did and we prayed and we cried and we prayed I called brother Daryl ward he come sit with us in the hospital she got to where she couldn't hear us no more we kept talking we kept telling her we loved her I had my phone in my pocket I reached down on my phone and got my opened my Bible app and I turned to this the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want when I started reading those words everybody in the room just started crying cuz it's like we realized he was going to take her how many love Psalms 23 how many of you know very much about Psalm 22 my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me you see before there could be a Psalm 23 there had to be a Psalm 22 so little bride only God knows what it'll be on your journey some of you may have been tried and you thought you'd never be able to do it but God is looking for people that he can try brother Wayne and I was talking about the brothers last night we had a little meal together and I told him said I thought about that man in John nine that was blind and the disciples said who saying him or his parents that he was born this way Jesus said neither one but that the glory of God might be made manifest amen but I wonder how many Summers that man missed yeah being blind wonder how much he was ridiculed and made fun of and laughed at maybe missed a family wife children the price of God's glory wow amen any of us willing for that too or do we just want shouting and all Victory and all healing and I don't myself I'm not standing in line and say God I I'll take a trial over blessing come on you don't think I'm that dumb do you I was born in the morning but not yesterday morning come on no my first choice would be blessing but if God needs a preacher in this message that can go through hard times and God will refuse to seemingly answer his prayers in the way he wants it if God I heard it years ago brother Wayne and it pued me hearing brother R said father you have broken my heart over and over again amen and I thank you for it hallelujah hallelujah what a blessing it is oh let me close here the prophet said the same elements used Cedar Wood not dog wood but the cross was Cedar speaking of redemption the Cedar and the hisop spoke of Christ and the cross so here she comes her matah silver gold overlaying Cedar the cross between the Divine and the human she rode that right into the presence of her husband verse 10 and he made pillars thereof silver the bottom thereof gold the covering of purple the midst thereof being paved listen this paved with love paved with love so here they come now he would send the trumpeters he would send the harpst he would send the musicians he would send the incense because a Runner comes and says it's almost time she's coming so Solomon was ready and the bride is ready and they're going to meet in between her home and his home so he leaves the palace and goes outside now this is where we pick it up where the incense and all that was going this is where this was written from that she's actually coming up and what do they do they precede her with songs of Zion music and incense so here's the sandalwood the myrrh all those fragrances of the Far East and this is preceding her coming let me reminds you of this and going beyond the camp in 1964 think of it missing people they can't see you anymore but you're getting together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth amen so one minute the devil's looking at you and you disappear and he said where'd he go where'd she go right and we're actually missing on the earth you know why right streetport 1963 he tells us that whenever we we are raised that he knows we're we'll be so much human that we'd be looking around to see if this one made it that one made it that one made it so he allows us some time to get together praise God so you're getting together with the rest of the group that's right I'll tell you since I've been to Johnson City a couple of months ago I preached Carol was it 149 149th funeral that I've preached since I've been there I said God why why have I had so Much Death to deal with why but then I look at it in another way on that Resurrection morning you talking about a bunch of folks showing up at my house who is mdic February 1965 therefore if you have died and entered into the theophany you bring the theophany to meet the redeemed body and if you are here you take your body to meet the theophany notice the center and the focus point of that quote it's you glory to God you understand I know Peter has not yet seen him nor has Paul nor has James nor Thaddius nor any of the rest of the brothers they entered into another phase of the sixth Dimension remember brother rson the sixth Dimension he saw nobody's people but but his own he did not see Paul he did not see Luther he did not see Wesley it would be Unbecoming for the bride to see him with those dyed garments on who is this that Cometh From The Wilderness with dyed garments on from boero that's what the prophet said in the Old Testament so they're in the throne room on the resurrection morning the Lord Jesus will stand and go behind the curtain as it were and when he comes out he's changed clothes and he doesn't have on high priest garments anymore but it's a bridegroom garment you see it was Naomi that told Ruth to go lay at the feet of Boaz her kinsman redeemer but she had to change clothes before she would go because she had been wearing clothing of widowhood Glory to God your old husband is dead Glory it's time for you to put off your G of widowhood and go lay at the feet of your boys friends can you imagine when he steps out as it were and the angels see him and today is the day it's today can you imagine how long he has been waiting for that day I've been longing since I've been a Christian many of you have been saved longer than I have you've been longing since you've been a Christian to see him he's been longing to see you in a glorified body since before the foundation of the world and the dead Christ rise first he will loose them from the sixth Dimension after my daughter stops down at 101 qu run and sees her husband and her four little girls I figure she'll be making a stop up to me and her mama's house maybe I'll be standing out in front of the mirror combing my hair and no I don't have on a tpay it's all mine I'm not against you Brothers if you need one but people thought for years I had one thought Lord have mercy why do I have to get this thing cut as often as I do this is all mine but it's change colors yeah amen I said it's changed colors but I'm waiting any day now for it to change back and oh yeah before I close I want to make this personal invite to each of you it is the largest youth rally that has ever been known in history no old people invited no old people welcome for every one of us are going to be young Hallelujah we will be young there will be no 50 years old or no 60 years old why we are riding on the pin of eternal [Music] life list stand glory and let me just let you know where you're going to move to a gated community and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband oh children be encouraged the Lord's mindful of what you're going through what you've been through no doubt many of you bear many scars in your life of the way you've been treated sometimes by preachers my greatest scars I don't mind telling you has been from Christians I don't have to deal with worldly people that much my greatest scars a lot of them are from preachers message preachers I thought when I come to this message I'd find a quality of people like the world had never known I have but I've also found some others in there too you know I never was hurt by Pentecostal preachers the way I've been hurt by message preachers but I'm so glad that God helps us that we don't let our scars dictate who we are and keep this in mind God will never hold you accountable for the way that people treat you but it will hold you accountable for the way you treat people amen would you love him today if I never see you again I want to meet you on that morning praise God when we all get together in that realm thank you Lord Jesus won't that be awesome amen we'll look around and none of us be old none of us have glasses contacts or anything like that brother Ron Peterson had a dream he may have told you about it brother Wayne years and years ago he shared it with me and it's just a dream so I'll tell it it's a dream but it just always has blessed my heart and it was like he was dreaming about the Resurrection The Rapture and he said we was all just getting together and the Lord Jesus was in the midst of us just kind of suspended above us and we all started looking toward him and praising him and worshiping him and the more we worshiped the higher he raised and the higher he raised the more we worshiped and the more we worshiped the higher he raised until he just got way up above us and this Splendor was coming from his garments and he's just looking down on us with his hand stretched out and there we were by the millions Oh Glory to God won't that be worth all that we've been through in love all the ridicule that you've been put up with because of his gospel it'll be worth it all one day can we bow our heads please if there's anyone here today who would like to be remembered in prayer maybe you're sick maybe you've been going through a real difficult time maybe you're not even saved today maybe you're a backslider whatever your need is would you just raise your hand to the Lord God bless you I'd like for you to remember me if you would Lord we I'll be going out to brother pause this evening to speak up there heavenly father as we come to the close of this part of the service thank you for your word thank you for the cross thank you for the holy ghost that gives us power thank you for the prophet in the last day that you sent us for the message of the hour he didn't leave us a bridge a road named after him a Bible School a college but he left us a message a message which would turn our hearts back to the original Apostolic fathers Lord you saw the hands that we lifted in this place today I pray for each one of them maybe some sick some weary father in the name of Jesus would you go and minister to them Lord Lord we believe like Jacob of old we also today are may andam we have the physical Camp here and we can see one another and shake hands with one another but we believe there's another Camp Among Us the angel of God I pray father maybe there's some that's weary in this journey on the Peloquin and they feel like why should I even try they don't seem like God even loves me no more they might even talk to the guards and the soldiers that's trying trying to protect him and say I ain't coming back no more I ain't coming back to church no more as a sister in our church Lord going through a hard time just a few weeks ago and she was just hit by a very hard thing on Wednesday night before service she just got in her vehicled and left she said I ain't coming back again I'm just so discouraged and so weary I just didn't come it back no more but when she got home something started pulling on her and pulling in honor she just couldn't stay away so she got back in her car and come back to church again little did she know that I was going to be preaching that night on you putting a bit in trouble's mouth and you would lead it around to bring us to a state of completion and Perfection she come up at the end of the service and said that was just for me well little did she know that hundreds of people was thinking the same thing because it's you Lord that does it help
