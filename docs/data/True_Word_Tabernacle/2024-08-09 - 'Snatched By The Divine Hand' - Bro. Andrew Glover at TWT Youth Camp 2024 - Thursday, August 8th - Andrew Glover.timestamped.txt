[21:00] meeting this weekend Amen Let the spirit
[21:03] of the Lord move amen enjoy the enjoy
[21:06] the whole experience from start to
[21:08] finish amen the great thing about a camp
[21:10] meeting you know is that it brings
[21:11] people together we want to recognize the
[21:13] last time I counted I believe there's at
[21:15] least 56 churches represented here in
[21:18] this group tonight and so what a
[21:19] wonderful thing it is to bring people
[21:21] together amen we we're all about that we
[21:24] want to we want to build Bridges amen uh
[21:27] and so we just thank the Lord for for

[21:31] of different people coming from
[21:32] different places you know we all come
[21:34] from different backgrounds different
[21:36] ideas and so why don't it just get in
[21:37] your mind right now you know that uh
[21:40] maybe this weekend somebody maybe will
[21:42] sing a song that you don't like or the
[21:45] preacher will he'll preach it a little
[21:47] different in a way you do it at home or
[21:49] you know maybe things something will be
[21:50] handled a little different than you're
[21:52] used to that's called the cost of
[21:53] Fellowship amen how many are willing to
[21:56] look over that and get into the unity of
[21:57] the spirit
[21:59] amen and and pay the cost for
[22:03] Fellowship amen that's what we're all
[22:05] about you know we want to come together
[22:07] we want to be in agreement amen uh
[22:09] brother brandom talked one time about
[22:10] how great evangelists would come to town

[22:16] big group of people together you know
[22:18] and and and bring people just bring
[22:20] bring a great audience together but

[22:26] you know quoting the Trinity and another
[22:28] one praying to the you know to Catholic
[22:30] saints and you know one Protestant one
[22:32] Catholic all that kind of St he said

[55:59] devil's in trouble amen the devil's in
[56:01] trouble Isaiah chapter
[56:03] 59 in verse number one the Bible says
[56:08] behold the Lord's hand is not shortened
[56:11] that it cannot save and neither is his
[56:15] ear heavy that it cannot hear I love
[56:19] that the Lord's hand is not shortened
[56:22] that it cannot save and neither is his
[56:24] ear heavy that it cannot hear now if you
[56:28] want to see a direct manifestation of
[56:30] that let's turn to the book of St
[56:31] Matthew the 14th chapter St Matthew
[56:36] chapter 14 and I want to read in the
[56:38] beginning in the 25th verse of St
[56:40] Matthew
[56:41] 14 in verse number
[56:46] 25 Jesus has just calmed the storm and
[56:50] in the 25th verse it says and in the
[56:52] Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went
[56:54] unto them walking on the sea and when
[56:57] the disciples saw him walking on the sea
[56:59] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[57:03] and they cried out for fear brother BR
[57:05] said the devil tried to make him afraid
[57:07] of the only thing that could help him
[57:09] they cried out and said it is a spirit
[57:11] and they cried out for fear but Jesus
[57:14] straightway spake unto them saying be of
[57:16] good cheer it is I Be not Afraid so he
[57:21] rebuked the fear by identifying who he
[57:24] was in other words he said I'm here it
[57:28] is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered
[57:30] and said unto him Lord if it be thou bid
[57:33] me come unto thee on the water and he
[57:35] said come and when Peter was come down
[57:38] out of the ship he walked on the water
[57:40] to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind
[57:43] boisterous he was afraid and beginning
[57:45] to sink now watch he cried saying Lord
[57:48] save me and immediately Jesus stretched
[57:52] forth his hand because his hand is not
[57:54] shortened and called him and said unto
[57:58] him oh thou of little faith wherefore
[58:01] did not didst thou doubt and when they
[58:03] were coming into the ship the wind
[58:05] ceased then they that were in the ship
[58:07] came and worshiped him saying of a truth
[58:10] Thou Art the Son of God Amen I believe
[58:13] we can say tonight of a truth he is the
[58:16] Son of God and he is here in our midst
[58:19] tonight we ask the Lord this evening to
[58:21] add the blessing to the reading of his
[58:22] word as you can have your seats um from
[58:24] those scriptures tonight for just a few
[58:27] moments I want to speak to you here if I
[58:29] would title this tonight I want to speak
[58:30] to you on snatched by the Divine hand
[58:34] amen snatched by the Divine hand and you
[58:36] know as We Gather here tonight I know
[58:38] we're all coming from different walks of
[58:40] life different backgrounds amen
[58:42] different situations different problems
[58:44] different circumstances each one of us
[58:46] are facing different mountains different
[58:48] obstacles but I want to say tonight that
[58:50] no matter what you're going through amen
[58:53] that God is not interested in replacing
[58:55] you amen but God is interested in
[58:58] rescuing you he's not interested in
[59:00] finding someone else to do what he's
[59:02] called you to do but rather he has
[59:04] chosen you elected you ordained you
[59:07] anointed you and positionally placed you
[59:09] and therefore God is more interested in
[59:12] rescuing you than he is replacing you
[59:14] because you see amen there's actually
[59:16] more Victory Amen in a testimony of
[59:19] God's rescuing you amen then God
[59:22] replacing you now when you look here at
[59:24] this word snatch it has a very very
[59:26] powerful definition it means to quickly
[59:28] see something Amen in a rude or eager
[59:31] way it means to quickly secure or obtain
[59:34] something amen when a when a chance
[59:36] presents itself it means to eagerly take
[59:39] or accept an offer amen or an
[59:41] opportunity now I'll say this anytime
[59:44] that the Lord snatches one of his own or
[59:46] eagerly catches one of his own amen the
[59:49] devil always considers it rude you know
[59:52] the devil has plans the devil has ideas
[59:54] the devil has a Direction amen but then
[59:57] all of a sudden the anointing comes in
[59:59] and the anointing destroys the Yoke of
[1:00:01] the enemy and snatches you amen and all
[1:00:04] of a sudden the devil's plans that he
[1:00:05] had for you have just been interrupted
[1:00:08] amen because the hand of God is more
[1:00:10] mightier amen than the mountain or the
[1:00:12] obstacle that's in front of you amen and
[1:00:15] God is more interested in rescuing you
[1:00:17] than he is replacing you now amen in St
[1:00:19] Matthew 14 and: 31 amen the Bible says
[1:00:23] that Jesus stretched forth his hand amen
[1:00:25] and he caught Peter and he said unto him
[1:00:27] oh thou of little faith wherefore didst
[1:00:29] thou doubt now when you look at this
[1:00:31] word cult it means to lay hold of it
[1:00:34] means to take possession of Amen it
[1:00:36] means to overtake or to lay hold of or
[1:00:39] to seize amen upon anything with the
[1:00:42] hands it means to to rescue one from
[1:00:44] Peril it means to help or to secure amen
[1:00:48] so when Jesus when he caught Peter amen
[1:00:51] what he done was he overtook him amen
[1:00:53] see there were things that was trying to
[1:00:55] overtake him
[1:00:56] amen but God was not interested in
[1:00:58] allowing the things that was trying to
[1:01:00] overtake him Amen to overtake him but
[1:01:02] God was interested in delivering him
[1:01:05] amen and the hand of God was greater
[1:01:07] than the water amen than the fear than
[1:01:09] the situation and I'll say tonight we've
[1:01:12] gathered here and there's a lot of
[1:01:13] devils amen they're trying to overtake
[1:01:15] minds or trying to overtake futures or
[1:01:17] trying to overtake homes and churches
[1:01:20] amen but I stand here on the first night
[1:01:22] and say this devil you don't have enough
[1:01:24] amen you don't have enough pressure you
[1:01:26] don't have enough scare you don't have
[1:01:28] enough fear amen because there is one in
[1:01:30] our midst amen who is mightier than the
[1:01:33] fear he's mightier than the water he's
[1:01:35] mightier than the sickness he's mightier
[1:01:38] than the depression he's mightier than
[1:01:40] the sin he's mightier than the Habit
[1:01:42] he's mightier than the besetting sin
[1:01:44] there is nothing the devil can throw
[1:01:46] against you that is more powerful than
[1:01:48] the hand of God that is in our midst to
[1:01:50] overtake you brother said when Peter
[1:01:53] started walking on the water he thought
[1:01:55] he was getting along all right see how
[1:01:56] big I'm doing he started sinking he
[1:01:59] didn't say well I guess it failed Heen
[1:02:01] on down to the bottom a few bubbles come
[1:02:03] up and that was all of it see no I love
[1:02:06] that Peter did not accept amen that he
[1:02:08] belonged at the bottom he did not accept
[1:02:11] that he belonged underneath a situation
[1:02:13] he didn't just give into the water and
[1:02:16] say well let's just sink and let's just
[1:02:17] sink let's just go on down in depression
[1:02:20] let's just go on down and sin no but
[1:02:22] there was a hand there and that hand was
[1:02:24] a mighty hand and Peter judged that hand
[1:02:27] more faithful amen than the trouble that
[1:02:30] was in front of him he be to cry out
[1:02:33] amen he began to cry out these words
[1:02:35] Lord save me brother B said amen and
[1:02:37] that Eternal hand I love that that
[1:02:40] Eternal hand reached down amen and
[1:02:42] picked him up again amen when he cried

[1:02:48] shortened and neither is his ear heavy
[1:02:51] amen and his hand is not temporary amen
[1:02:54] but his hand is eternal so that tells me
[1:02:57] amen that if it reached to Peter amen it
[1:03:00] also reached to Paul it also reached to
[1:03:02] James it also reached to Moses and David

[1:03:15] you ain't got to get a plan together to
[1:03:17] approach God you just got to recognize
[1:03:20] I'm on my way down but there's a hand
[1:03:22] that can reach down and can snatch me of
[1:03:26] the situation and can put me back on top
[1:03:29] listen we don't belong on the bottom we
[1:03:31] belong on the top We Don't Belong under
[1:03:33] the water We Don't Belong under the
[1:03:35] pressure We Don't Belong under the
[1:03:37] situation we belong above it as Sons and
[1:03:39] Daughters of God so we're going to cry
[1:03:41] out and we're going to pull on God until
[1:03:44] he comes into our midst and reaches down
[1:03:46] his hand and saves us we're not playing
[1:03:50] games we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:52] and just as Peter was so are we we are
[1:03:55] in the line of duty brother B said
[1:03:58] Christian tonight you're in the line of
[1:04:00] duty see you're trying to follow the

[1:13:33] couple black eyes in Deuteronomy 5:15 it

[1:13:39] the land of Egypt so one time you was
[1:13:41] under Egypt amen and that the Lord thy
[1:13:44] God brought thee out amen fence through
[1:13:46] a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm
[1:13:50] therefore the Lord thy God commanded
[1:13:52] thee Amen to keep the Sabbath day in 424
[1:13:56] that all the people of the earth amen
[1:13:58] might know the hand of the Lord that it
[1:14:01] is mighty that you might fear the lord
[1:14:03] your God forever amen I love Psalms 98
[1:14:06] verse1 oh sing unto the Lord a new song
[1:14:10] Amen for he hath done marvelous things
[1:14:12] his right hand and His holy arm hath
[1:14:16] gotten him the victory let me say this
[1:14:19] sometimes we allow the waters we allow
[1:14:22] the pressures Amen to cause us to for
[1:14:25] get how powerful the hand of God is in
[1:14:28] Revelation chap 1 John was on the aisle
[1:14:31] of patmas and there on the aisle of
[1:14:33] patmas he breaks out into a vision and
[1:14:35] he sees the Sevenfold personage of Jesus
[1:14:37] Christ which then he sees the fifth fold
[1:14:40] amen of the revealing and here's what it
[1:14:42] was there were seven stars that was
[1:14:45] where in his right hand brother said see
[1:14:47] those Seven Stars amen they are the
[1:14:50] Angels which are the messengers and John
[1:14:53] said that he laid his right hand amen
[1:14:56] Seven Stars out of his mouth when a
[1:14:58] sharp two-edged sword his countenance
[1:15:00] was as the sun shineth in his strength
[1:15:02] now watch and when I saw him I fell at
[1:15:05] his feet as dead but he laid his right
[1:15:08] hand upon me and said fear not oh my
[1:15:11] fear not I am the first amen and I am
[1:15:14] the last I am he that liveth and was
[1:15:17] dead and behold I am alive forever more
[1:15:20] and have the keys of death amen and of
[1:15:24] hell now watch he lays his hand over on
[1:15:27] John in other words amen he's laying his
[1:15:30] strength and his power over on John
[1:15:33] brother said see their strength amen was
[1:15:35] from the Lord or they could have never
[1:15:37] stemmed the tide they were safe in his
[1:15:40] care for nothing somebody shout back at
[1:15:42] me nothing nothing for nothing could
[1:15:45] pluck them out of his hand and neither
[1:15:48] could anything separate them from the
[1:15:51] love of God let it be sickness Let It Be
[1:15:53] Peril nakedness famine sword life or
[1:15:56] death they were truly yielded to him and
[1:15:59] they were kept by his omnipotence let me
[1:16:02] say when God puts his hand on something
[1:16:05] he puts his strength on it and he puts
[1:16:07] his power on it and he dares any devil
[1:16:09] to try to stop it he dares any devil to
[1:16:12] try to defeat what his hand has come up
[1:16:15] on that purpose for oh my goodness well
[1:16:18] I'll say this he's put his hand on every
[1:16:20] one of you young people he's laid his
[1:16:22] hand on you and he's dared lay out of SE
[1:16:24] it to take you he said go ahead devil
[1:16:27] and try it amen but they're not under
[1:16:29] their own strength they're not under
[1:16:31] their own power they're not under a
[1:16:32] Church's power or a preacher's power
[1:16:35] there is a hand upon them and it's the
[1:16:38] same hand that created the heavens and
[1:16:40] the Earth is resting upon this young
[1:16:43] person yes sir that's why Jesus come
[1:16:46] along and said My Father which gave me
[1:16:48] them is greater than all and no man
[1:16:51] somebody shout no man is able to pluck
[1:16:54] them amen out of my father's hand
[1:16:57] brother comes along in Investments and
[1:16:59] says heavenly father they are yours they
[1:17:02] are trophies of the
[1:17:03] message you didn't know it but you're a
[1:17:06] trophy they're trophies of the word
[1:17:09] they're trophies of Jesus Christ because
[1:17:12] you said that no man can pluck them out
[1:17:15] of my father's hand he gave them to me
[1:17:19] and no man is great enough to do
[1:17:21] that no man is great enough
[1:17:25] to pluck them out of my hand so keep
[1:17:27] them Father and send them forth as fire
[1:17:31] brands that have been snatched from the
[1:17:34] fire and make them Burning Lights for
[1:17:36] your kingdom I commit them to you in

[1:18:01] got out of it some hand caught him or
[1:18:03] snatched him and got him out of the
[1:18:04] house that was on fire and then later he
[1:18:07] comes up with the second part of it and
[1:18:09] he says this amen it's the same way I
[1:18:11] view the circumstances of my eternal

[1:19:37] Believers listen and if his hand is upon
[1:19:40] you then everything his hand is is
[1:19:43] accessible to
[1:19:45] you brother R said every True Believer
[1:19:47] how many True Believers we have is in
[1:19:50] the hand of God and they can draw from
[1:19:52] his love and his power and they can
[1:19:55] receive the full benefit of all that God
[1:19:58] is to the believer now not a partial
[1:20:01] benefit but you can receive the full
[1:20:04] benefits of all that God is to the
[1:20:06] believer in other words what he did amen
[1:20:10] for The Messengers is what he does for
[1:20:12] every believer who comes underneath her
[1:20:14] message because the hand snatches the
[1:20:17] elect out of the age let me say this
[1:20:20] we're not just church members and we're
[1:20:21] not just young people but we are a
[1:20:23] chosen generation ation according to
[1:20:26] Peter we are a chosen generation we are
[1:20:28] a royal priesthood we are a holy nation
[1:20:31] A peculiar people that you should show
[1:20:34] forth the Praises of him who have called
[1:20:37] you out of Darkness amen Into His
[1:20:41] Marvelous Light see a chosen generation
[1:20:44] is a blessed generation can I say that
[1:20:46] to you you are a blessed generation you
[1:20:49] say why am I blessed because of the
[1:20:51] church I go to because of the ministry I
[1:20:53] sit under because of the type of clothes
[1:20:55] I wear the amount of money in my parents
[1:20:58] bank account the amount of house I live
[1:21:00] in no the reason you are blessed is
[1:21:03] simply because of these words the cross
[1:21:06] of
[1:21:07] Calvary that's the whole reason we're
[1:21:09] blessed because listen whether we forgot
[1:21:11] it or not we are not Jews we are
[1:21:14] Gentiles and the Bible says that the
[1:21:16] Jews amen were the ones that should have
[1:21:18] received the hand upon them but remember
[1:21:21] when Joseph amen went there to Jacob was
[1:21:24] about to bless the two boys what
[1:21:25] happened he crossed his hand Oh my he
[1:21:29] crossed his hand and the blessing fell
[1:21:32] upon the younger the blessing fell upon
[1:21:35] the
[1:21:37] younger the blessing fell upon the the
[1:21:41] younger so you mean this is not just an
[1:21:43] Elder's message but it's also a young
[1:21:46] people's message yes sir see and Joseph
[1:21:49] cried out not so my father this is the
[1:21:52] firstborn to your arve but I love what
[1:21:54] Jacob said he said but God has crossed
[1:21:57] my hands in other words we see the
[1:21:59] blessing which belonged to the firstborn
[1:22:02] the Jew was given over to the younger
[1:22:04] the Gentile which was through the cross
[1:22:07] or the crossed hands of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:10] Christ because according to Galatians 3
[1:22:13] The Blessing of Abraham comes through
[1:22:15] the cross he said see so The Blessing of
[1:22:17] Abraham came to the Cross to the
[1:22:20] Gentiles amen the Jews rejected the
[1:22:22] cross here it is and therefore Jesus got
[1:22:26] the Gentile bride so because his hands
[1:22:29] were crossed amen the Jews rejected him
[1:22:32] but Jesus got the Gentile bride brother
[1:22:35] says it very beautiful he said this
[1:22:37] transpired in order that the spirit
[1:22:40] might become available to the Gentiles
[1:22:42] without the crossing of the hands The
[1:22:45] Blessing of Abraham the baptism of the
[1:22:47] Holy Ghost the blessing of justification
[1:22:50] the spirit of Grace and wisdom and God
[1:22:52] could never come to this young people
[1:22:54] could never come to this generation he
[1:22:56] said but when Jesus crossed his hands he
[1:22:59] called out a people of the Gentiles for
[1:23:01] his name's sake he said in the Bride of
[1:23:03] Jesus Christ she will be mes Jesus
[1:23:07] Christ she will be baptized in his
[1:23:09] Spirit she will in his name and she will
[1:23:12] be filled with his power oh I feel like
[1:23:16] giving the devil a black eye right there
[1:23:18] he said see it very beautiful robed in
[1:23:19] his righteousness there she is he said
[1:23:23] that same power that spoke the world
[1:23:26] into existence amen is in those people
[1:23:29] that's got the Holy Ghost oh not only do
[1:23:32] you have his hand upon you brother ra
[1:23:35] the same hand that created the heavens
[1:23:37] and the Earth has now a prophet said if
[1:23:39] you got the Holy Ghost inside of you you
[1:23:43] don't just have the hand upon you but
[1:23:45] you have the life of the hand on the
[1:23:48] inside of you and you're not full of
[1:23:50] complexes and you're oh I might as well
[1:23:52] preach I feel that devil amen we've just
[1:23:54] settle down and let our lives become
[1:23:56] full of complexes and full of questions
[1:23:58] and full of doubts and full of this
[1:24:00] issue amen but I want to say Satan on
[1:24:02] the first night if you're living in one
[1:24:04] of these temples you are living
[1:24:07] trespassing you are a trespasser
[1:24:10] complexes don't belong in you unbelief
[1:24:13] don't belong in you bitterness don't
[1:24:15] belong in you Jesus didn't get a gentile
[1:24:18] bride to be full of Confusion And to be
[1:24:20] full of doubt he got a gentile bride to
[1:24:24] be full of his power and his authority
[1:24:27] and his anointing yes sir so I say to
[1:24:30] the devil this is bride time devil this
[1:24:34] is bride time this ain't Church time
[1:24:36] this ain't denomination time this is
[1:24:39] bride time because we have recognized
[1:24:42] that we are that Gentile bride we have
[1:24:44] recognized that we are the
[1:24:46] ones that the hand was crossed and the
[1:24:50] blessing has come upon see brother said
[1:24:52] very beautiful the time has come for god
[1:24:55] Jehovah to rise on the scene and show
[1:24:58] himself he always does it just at the
[1:25:02] Junctions of time and that time is now
[1:25:07] brother Caleb it's not in the future
[1:25:09] it's right now I love this light
[1:25:11] somebody say light light has brought a
[1:25:14] glorious Revelation amen and here's that
[1:25:17] Revelation that the Jehovah of the
[1:25:20] old is the Jesus of the new are you with
[1:25:24] me and listen he's manifesting himself
[1:25:28] in
[1:25:30] you now let that settle on your heart
[1:25:33] for a second the Jehovah of the old is
[1:25:37] the Jesus of the new and it's the same
[1:25:40] God manifesting himself in you and me
[1:25:43] said the Holy Spirit must be alive in
[1:25:45] the church always see the Holy Spirit
[1:25:48] must be alive in the church and live its
[1:25:51] day so the spirit of God coming in the
[1:25:53] church it's not coming to make us live
[1:25:55] another day but it's coming to make us
[1:25:58] live in this day which means there was a
[1:26:00] message for Luther's day and there was a
[1:26:03] message for Wesley's day and there was a
[1:26:05] message for Pentecost amen but let's not
[1:26:07] stop short amen let's go all the way
[1:26:10] there was an adoption promised to the
[1:26:12] church underneath a messiah sign there
[1:26:15] would come a third pull which would be
[1:26:17] the reintroducing of not a man's hand
[1:26:20] but of God's hand to the church brother
[1:26:22] B said see these Revel
[1:26:24] they're going to be brought to us in
[1:26:27] Revelations are you ready for this and
[1:26:30] from the hand of God by Vindication
[1:26:33] listen friends the message of the hour
[1:26:36] has come to you by the hand of
[1:26:39] God can I say it like this you're
[1:26:42] literally eating out of the hand of God
[1:26:45] as you're feeding upon this message you
[1:26:48] are feeding from the hand of
[1:26:51] God can I say what else the prophet said
[1:26:54] he he said it's pure and it's clean it's
[1:26:57] unadulterated word of God coming from
[1:27:01] the hand of God I love this one Easter
[1:27:03] 65 you who were once dead in sin and
[1:27:07] trespasses has
[1:27:10] now has now been quickened together to
[1:27:14] sit in Heavenly places with Christ
[1:27:18] Jesus oh I love this feasting on Mana
[1:27:21] from above and seeing the hand of God
[1:27:25] made manifest proven the promise of this
[1:27:29] day so we've been snatched by the hand
[1:27:33] of God we've been lifted to Heavenly
[1:27:35] places we're seated in Christ Jesus and
[1:27:39] we're not feeding on a man's idea but
[1:27:41] we're feeding on Mana from above and as
[1:27:44] we're feeding on Mana from above we're
[1:27:46] literally watching the hand of
[1:27:49] God manifested Among Us now I know what
[1:27:53] somebody says somebody says well if
[1:27:54] we're going to see the hand of God
[1:27:56] manifested then what we got to see is
[1:27:57] like they did in the brandom Tabernacle
[1:27:59] when the hand come down and wrote out
[1:28:01] the seven Church ages and the
[1:28:03] handwriting was on the wall listen
[1:28:04] that's one way that God Vindicated his
[1:28:07] hand in the midst of the meeting but let
[1:28:09] me say this uh and this is real simple
[1:28:12] okay but if you want to know if it's
[1:28:13] rained outside tell me the best way to
[1:28:16] find
[1:28:17] out go get your phone and check the
[1:28:19] radar and see if it says it's rained go
[1:28:22] get your newspaper and see if they
[1:28:24] predicted rain no the best way is to go
[1:28:28] outside and look at the grass and look
[1:28:30] at the trees and look at the pavement
[1:28:33] and if it's wet I'm not very smart but
[1:28:36] that means it's rained see the evidence
[1:28:38] that's on the thing is a proof of the
[1:28:41] rain that's come upon the Earth somebody
[1:28:44] says how do you know that the hand of
[1:28:46] God is upon this generation listen I
[1:28:49] don't see the physical hand of God
[1:28:51] tonight but I see the evidence of it I
[1:28:54] see the evidence of a hand that reached
[1:28:57] Into the Fire and snatched young people
[1:29:00] I see the hand of God that saved you
[1:29:02] from sin it saved you from perversion
[1:29:05] some of you all was oh God you was ready
[1:29:08] to be the next statistic but the hand of
[1:29:11] God reached down and snatched you away
[1:29:14] from the hand of the enemy listen don't
[1:29:16] tell me the hand of God ain't Among Us I
[1:29:18] see the evidence of it I see the
[1:29:21] evidence of the hand of God all across
[1:29:23] this building
[1:29:25] tonight I see his hand there I see his
[1:29:29] hand there I see his hand there I see it
[1:29:32] in the middle I see it back there amen
[1:29:34] Xavier go ahead and raise your hand I
[1:29:36] see the hand of God Amen just a few
[1:29:39] years ago wasn't serving God but the
[1:29:41] hand of God got a hold of him and saved
[1:29:44] him and he's not just a church member
[1:29:46] under some watered down idea he's a end
[1:29:49] time message believer I see the hand of
[1:29:52] God in this play in
[1:29:57] manifestation I see his hand I can't not
[1:30:00] believe it I see the
[1:30:03] evidence I see it I see the hand of God
[1:30:07] which also is associated with the favor
[1:30:09] of God so if the hand of God is on you
[1:30:13] then the favor of God is on you the
[1:30:16] Bible says that thou shalt arise and
[1:30:19] have mercy upon Zion for the time to
[1:30:23] favor her all right yay the due
[1:30:27] time the right
[1:30:30] time the opportune time is come now you
[1:30:34] all know that Zion is the type of the
[1:30:36] Bride right so we can very well say that
[1:30:39] God is favoring his bride with
[1:30:44] signs
[1:30:45] wonders
[1:30:47] Miracles
[1:30:48] Revelation healing
[1:30:52] Deliverance Second Chances
[1:30:54] third chances first
[1:30:57] chances eighth chances come on we can
[1:31:00] very well say that God is favoring this
[1:31:03] bride because the prophets of the old
[1:31:05] formal Church age is gone and the time
[1:31:08] that God is doing a new thing he's not
[1:31:11] only doing it here but he swept it
[1:31:13] around the world see the message of the
[1:31:15] hour has swept around the world now let
[1:31:18] me ask you something what is the message
[1:31:20] of the hour that swept around the world
[1:31:22] it is a witness of the resurrection of
[1:31:25] Jesus Christ can I say something to you
[1:31:27] young people God doesn't do anything
[1:31:30] without raising up a witness of what he
[1:31:33] has done the Bible says in Isaiah 43
[1:31:36] remember ye not the former things
[1:31:38] neither consider the things of old for
[1:31:40] behold I somebody say I will do a new
[1:31:43] thing now it shall spring forth and
[1:31:46] shall ye not know it in other words God
[1:31:49] is going to do a new thing but shall ye
[1:31:52] not know it now listen I will even make
[1:31:54] a way in the
[1:31:57] wilderness and rivers in the desert can

[1:37:42] you better believe I'm going to accept
[1:37:44] it in the Purity and the
[1:37:47] form that it was brought to me by from
[1:37:51] the hand of God
[1:37:54] see God has always had a witness on the
[1:37:56] earth that will be a testimony to what
[1:37:58] he has done in the middle of the age
[1:38:00] they're living see although it got down
[1:38:02] to one person sometimes God always and
[1:38:05] always will have a
[1:38:08] witness brother
[1:38:10] somebody somebody he can lay his hand on
[1:38:14] now let me say this Noah was a witness
[1:38:18] in his generation
[1:38:19] right because God by a vision revealed
[1:38:23] Noah how to build the ark and what to
[1:38:26] use to build it brother said God told no
[1:38:28] said told Noah said I want you to make
[1:38:30] this out of a specific type of wood now
[1:38:33] just any wood won't work we got to have
[1:38:35] a certain type and it must be go for
[1:38:38] wood he said now goph for wood was soft
[1:38:40] wood and it was pliable and that's what
[1:38:43] makes up the ark was a wood that could
[1:38:46] be easily applied a pliable wood now
[1:38:50] watch brother turn that and say now
[1:38:52] that's the believer he said once in the
[1:38:55] hands of God is cut down from his own
[1:38:59] self-righteousness of the tree he
[1:39:01] becomes pliable in the hands of the
[1:39:03] Builder he's not tossed about with every
[1:39:06] wind of Doctrine but a pliable that fits
[1:39:09] amen right into the word of God to be
[1:39:11] used easily now just as Noah was given a
[1:39:15] vision I believe young people that we
[1:39:17] are given a vision I believe what the
[1:39:20] Bible says that where there is no vision
[1:39:22] the people perish oh thank you Lord
[1:39:25] where there is no vision the people
[1:39:28] begin to go underneath what they're
[1:39:30] under but where there is a vision that
[1:39:33] word vision is a prophetic
[1:39:36] insight and it's also Divine
[1:39:38] communication brother B said we must
[1:39:41] have a vision a vision comes to the
[1:39:44] prophet it's the word of the Lord spoken
[1:39:46] to him now what something breaks into
[1:39:49] this and says Christopher Columbus he
[1:39:52] was a man of vision he said what he
[1:39:54] believed was that the world was round he
[1:39:56] said now watch and he could see the mass
[1:39:59] amen way before he could see the ship so
[1:40:01] it proved him that the world was round
[1:40:04] and people didn't believe it in that day
[1:40:06] but he was a man of vision so it didn't
[1:40:10] matter what somebody else believed about
[1:40:11] the
[1:40:13] message he was a man of vision he set
[1:40:17] out to prove exactly what he have a
[1:40:20] vision of that it was the truth amen can
[1:40:22] I say in these meeting ings amen Lord
[1:40:25] refresh our vision of the message of the
[1:40:30] hour if quotes are becom un common I say
[1:40:33] God refresh refresh the freshness of
[1:40:36] them if if sermons and tapes have become
[1:40:40] stale I say God refresh refresh our
[1:40:43] hearts listen the tape don't need to be
[1:40:45] refreshed and the book don't need to be
[1:40:47] refreshed refreshed but the person
[1:40:51] does because some times we get a little
[1:40:54] self-righteous and we think we know a
[1:40:56] better way than brother bam
[1:40:59] taught and so we step aside from the
[1:41:01] vision but if we're going to be a part
[1:41:03] of the vision we've got to be pliable in
[1:41:06] the hands of God he said if anything the
[1:41:09] church needs tonight what we're trying
[1:41:10] to do friends is to bring a fresh vision
[1:41:13] from the presence of God to let the
[1:41:15] people see that God still lives and
[1:41:17] Reigns and is moving with his church and
[1:41:20] he will until Jesus comes to receive it
[1:41:23] and he will until Jesus comes to receive
[1:41:27] it see then what is a vision it's the
[1:41:30] direct word of the lord it's not an
[1:41:34] impression a vision is not I think I
[1:41:37] feel I thought I saw I felt like I heard
[1:41:41] a vision is the direct word of the Lord
[1:41:44] can I say this we cannot afford to lose
[1:41:48] our vision the vision is what takes us
[1:41:51] Beyond amen I'm going somewhere it's
[1:41:53] what takes us beyond the scene into the
[1:41:56] Unseen to be able to have a youth camp
[1:41:58] in the middle of age of confusion
[1:42:01] because watch said what is a vision it's
[1:42:04] another dimension it's outside of the
[1:42:07] five it's a six sense amen I remember I
[1:42:10] remember one time I was preaching down
[1:42:11] in Florida in a convention down at
[1:42:13] brother West Coast and there was a
[1:42:14] brother come in there and brother sister
[1:42:16] I'll just say this while we were
[1:42:18] preaching I was preaching on communion
[1:42:19] with mzc and it literally am me it
[1:42:22] literally felt like that MDC was
[1:42:25] standing right there in the build I mean
[1:42:26] the anointing the people's Faith was so
[1:42:28] buil and we walked out of there and a
[1:42:30] brother come up to some of those
[1:42:31] Brothers talking and he said you know
[1:42:33] what he said that was just a bunch of
[1:42:34] workup he said there was nothing to that
[1:42:37] he said there ain't nothing to all that
[1:42:39] screaming and hollering amen and I never
[1:42:41] will forget an old brother down there he
[1:42:42] looked over and he said well maybe not
[1:42:44] in the dimension you was
[1:42:46] in but the one we was
[1:42:49] in I thought there it is the message of
[1:42:52] the power will take you out of this
[1:42:55] sense bound Dimension that keeps you
[1:42:58] from being impliable with the anointing
[1:43:01] and the hand of God when it comes in the
[1:43:02] building and will take you into another
[1:43:04] dimension see what it is amen it's faith
[1:43:07] that is sitting your destination faith
[1:43:10] is the substance of what things hoped
[1:43:12] for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:43:15] taste felt smell or hurt but by faith
[1:43:18] when he catches the word it sends him
[1:43:21] into another dimension see that makes it
[1:43:24] so real to him till he's just as good as
[1:43:27] if he's got it in his hand he
[1:43:31] knows he guesses he hopes he thinks he
[1:43:36] feels he
[1:43:38] knows I said he knows he knows it's
[1:43:42] going to happen listen I don't think
[1:43:44] somebody's going to get saved here this
[1:43:45] weekend I know somebody's going to get
[1:43:48] saved I don't feel like somebody is
[1:43:51] going to get the Deliverance I know
[1:43:53] somebody's going to get the Deliverance
[1:43:56] I don't feel like somebody's going to
[1:43:57] get a breakthrough I know somebody is
[1:44:00] going to get a breakthrough because my
[1:44:02] soul has already caught the word of God
[1:44:05] and it has shot me into another
[1:44:07] dimension to believe things that My Five
[1:44:10] Senses will not
[1:44:11] declare you know what I say I don't feel
[1:44:14] like somebody's going to dance on the
[1:44:16] devil I know somebody is going to dance
[1:44:18] on the devil I don't feel like
[1:44:20] somebody's going to go here and just get
[1:44:22] a little touched I know somebody is
[1:44:24] going to get an eternal touch of the
[1:44:27] almighty God and they'll
[1:44:30] never they'll never brother Josh be the
[1:44:33] same again can I say this to you a
[1:44:36] vision is a
[1:44:39] forecast I'm going somewhere a vision is
[1:44:43] the forecast of future events it for
[1:44:47] tells the
[1:44:49] thing
[1:44:51] before it it happens a vision is seeing
[1:44:55] something that is
[1:44:58] not as though it
[1:45:01] was until it
[1:45:04] materializes can I give the devil
[1:45:06] another black eye a vision is not
[1:45:09] looking at what
[1:45:12] is a vision is not looking at what is a
[1:45:18] vision is looking at what will be so
[1:45:23] then it takes Faith to catch the vision
[1:45:26] because the things which are seen are
[1:45:27] temporal but the things which are unseen
[1:45:30] amen they are Eternal now watch when a
[1:45:32] man once catches the vision of the
[1:45:35] invisible God and knows somebody say
[1:45:38] knows that he's always present then
[1:45:41] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:45:43] man's thinking it stabilizes his actions
[1:45:47] and in the time of distress and trouble
[1:45:49] it'll still make him look upward and
[1:45:52] above of the things that are happening
[1:45:55] around him because he's looking at the
[1:45:58] Unseen yet by promise listen if you
[1:46:01] catch the vision you're going to catch
[1:46:03] on fire if you catch a vision of your
[1:46:07] salvation if you catch a vision of your
[1:46:10] healing if you catch a vision of your
[1:46:13] deliverance if you catch a vision of
[1:46:15] your Miracle listen the biggest threat
[1:46:18] to Satan's kingdom is a Believer who has
[1:46:21] called a vision Vision because a vision
[1:46:25] will declare things when feelings won't
[1:46:28] can I say this amen and and I'm not
[1:46:30] going to read the whole story to you I'm
[1:46:31] going to preach it to you real quick
[1:46:33] Michelangelo had a vision right he had a
[1:46:36] vision of what Moses looked like brother
[1:46:38] B said he took some clay and he said
[1:46:40] with his hand he chipped away he cut he
[1:46:44] honed he rubbed it down rubbed it over
[1:46:46] he said he worked until he saw in the
[1:46:48] clay what was in the vision in his mind
[1:46:53] can I say you like this Michelangelo
[1:46:56] with his hand by a vision produced a
[1:46:59] masterpiece well in Mark 16 the Bible
[1:47:02] says that there is a
[1:47:05] connection there is a connection between
[1:47:08] the hand of God and the clay oh God
[1:47:12] there is a connection because it said
[1:47:14] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:47:16] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:47:19] them here it is they shall lay hands
[1:47:24] I'm turning the corner they shall lay
[1:47:26] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:47:31] look at this word lay I I found this
[1:47:32] thing about shouted it means to attack
[1:47:37] one it means to make an assault on one
[1:47:42] brother B says it like this amen let me
[1:47:44] ask you this question how does an evil
[1:47:45] spirit take control of one human vessel
[1:47:49] and then another human vessel lay hands
[1:47:51] upon that vessel and cast that Spirit
[1:47:54] out well readers not just picked it up
[1:47:57] they took a man that was sick and a man
[1:47:59] that prayed for the sick and he said
[1:48:00] they put an x-ray over it and from the
[1:48:02] man's hand it showed a visible
[1:48:05] reflection of a ray coming out of his
[1:48:07] hand and going to the other man see God
[1:48:10] knew what he meant when he said they
[1:48:13] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:48:16] shall recover the laying on of hands of
[1:48:18] this man upon a sick man and the
[1:48:21] mechanical x-ray oh God he said showing
[1:48:24] him the light that was coming from the
[1:48:27] man's hand can I say why the devil
[1:48:29] attacks Mark 16 is because when a Son of
[1:48:32] God lays his hand upon the believer it
[1:48:35] is an attack from
[1:48:37] God you say who's he attacking is he
[1:48:40] attacking the individual no he's
[1:48:42] attacking the spirit that's trying to
[1:48:46] pull the individual underneath the water
[1:48:49] listen friends I said it as plain as I
[1:48:51] know how when we are not here to lay
[1:48:53] down we are not here to back up to the
[1:48:56] devil you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:48:58] and deity is not in heaven deity is in
[1:49:02] you the prophet of God said oh church he
[1:49:05] said we must recognize now that we have
[1:49:07] come to a place that people are
[1:49:09] realizing that the deity and the power
[1:49:12] of almighty God is living in the human
[1:49:17] being deity is not in heaven
[1:49:21] [Applause]
[1:49:23] deity is on the earth in this building
[1:49:27] tonight can I say this the Divine hand
[1:49:30] I'm I'm I'm coming out I'm coming to my
[1:49:32] point here the Divine hand is now veiled
[1:49:36] in human
[1:49:37] hands the Divine hand is now veiled in
[1:49:42] song
[1:49:43] leaders the Divine hand is now veiled in
[1:49:47] counselors in your dorms and what is he
[1:49:49] doing he's snatching you
[1:49:53] come on somebody amen the devil don't
[1:49:55] like it but it's the truth he's
[1:49:57] snatching you see right now the devil's
[1:49:59] holding you and holding you and holding
[1:50:02] you and trying to convince you and say
[1:50:04] you're going down you're going down but
[1:50:06] when you say Lord save
[1:50:07] me when you open up and say Lord save me
[1:50:12] the Divine hand it comes into action and
[1:50:15] it reaches
[1:50:17] down you know what the part of God said
[1:50:20] he said he has no hands but your hands
[1:50:22] what is it it's the mystery of human
[1:50:26] instrumentality God doesn't come down
[1:50:28] and speak it literally with his voice
[1:50:30] out of the heavens he wrote it on paper
[1:50:32] and is expecting me and you to receive
[1:50:36] the Holy Spirit to believe that word and
[1:50:39] then when we speak that word if it's
[1:50:41] God's true word god stands behind
[1:50:46] [Applause]
[1:50:47] it well I'm going to speak it you're
[1:50:50] healed
[1:50:52] I'm going to speak it you're delivered
[1:50:55] I'm going to speak it you're the Bride
[1:50:58] of Jesus Christ I'm just going to go
[1:51:00] ahead and speak it I'm going to speak
[1:51:02] Miracles I'm going to speak
[1:51:08] deles go ahead use your voice right now
[1:51:12] speak it speak your need speak your
[1:51:16] petition speak your request he's in the
[1:51:19] building
[1:51:23] Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:51:26] and are you ready for this and God
[1:51:28] performs The
[1:51:32] Miracles through the
[1:51:37] hands of his children see he's the vine
[1:51:41] and we are the branches the vine doesn't
[1:51:44] bear the fruit it Bears the branches but
[1:51:45] it gets energy from the vine and Jesus
[1:51:48] Christ the Holy Spirit comes into the
[1:51:50] human body and takes a hold of his own
[1:51:54] word it's his word through human
[1:51:59] instrumentality you know what an
[1:52:01] instrument is it's a tool or it is an
[1:52:04] Implement especially one for a delicate
[1:52:08] work so this is not any kind of work but
[1:52:12] it's a delicate work see it's a person
[1:52:16] who is made use of now watch this bam
[1:52:18] said Moses was an instrument he was
[1:52:20] elected of God he said Daniel become an
[1:52:22] instrument but can I can I bring it
[1:52:24] right here to our day and say in this
[1:52:26] age God sent a Vindicated
[1:52:30] prophet and he didn't do any kind of
[1:52:33] work he did very delicate
[1:52:36] work in other words under the angel now
[1:52:39] let's just put a name to it can we
[1:52:41] Willam Mary and brandom of the Church of
[1:52:44] the leans write these things say the
[1:52:46] amen the faithful the true witness the
[1:52:49] beginning of the creation of God now
[1:52:50] watch what brother says he said notice
[1:52:52] how God chose to use Moses to deliver
[1:52:55] Israel God told him before he went he
[1:52:58] said I'll send my angel before thee now
[1:53:01] God could have sent the angel down
[1:53:03] couldn't he he could have let the angel
[1:53:05] come himself but instead of that he sent
[1:53:07] the angel to speak to the voice of a man
[1:53:11] God always used man for his work another
[1:53:13] place he said now he is the Son of God
[1:53:17] I'm just a
[1:53:19] man I'm coming to my appoint with the
[1:53:21] devil right now
[1:53:23] he is the Son of God I'm just a man this
[1:53:26] here is a perfect mute it cannot speak
[1:53:29] until something speaks through it and so
[1:53:31] is a man just an instrument just a clay
[1:53:35] but if Jesus Christ can take that person
[1:53:38] in full control and if you'll obey his
[1:53:41] calls he can preach the gospel through
[1:53:44] him he can speak with tongues through
[1:53:46] him he can show Visions through him
[1:53:48] because he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:53:51] yesterday today and forever can I say
[1:53:54] what a prophet said he said I'm just an
[1:53:57] instrument in his hand I've never seen
[1:53:59] you I know nothing about you but God
[1:54:02] knows
[1:54:04] you do you see what was happening he was
[1:54:07] standing oh
[1:54:09] God a man was standing as an instrument
[1:54:13] in the hands of God carrying God's
[1:54:16] children from sickness under
[1:54:20] Health from bondage
[1:54:22] deliverance from sin under salvation
[1:54:26] from doubt under Faith amen now I found
[1:54:29] this very amazing and Ezra chapter 8 it
[1:54:31] begins with an outlining of the heads of
[1:54:33] the families and the genealogy of those
[1:54:35] returning with Ezra from Babylon to
[1:54:37] Jerusalem listen there was a total of
[1:54:42] 1,496 men listed that are all
[1:54:44] descendants of prominent Israelite
[1:54:47] families now listen in Ezra 8 they were
[1:54:50] guided and protected by God the group
[1:54:54] successfully completes their Journey oh
[1:54:57] God from Babylon to Jerusalem so it
[1:55:02] don't say young people that they started
[1:55:05] their Journey but Brother Joseph it says
[1:55:08] they successfully completed their
[1:55:11] journey and notice where it was from it
[1:55:13] was from Babylon which is confusion unto
[1:55:18] Jerusalem which is the city of Peace the
[1:55:21] oh the Bible ible says in Ezra 831 and
[1:55:24] the hand of God was upon us and he
[1:55:26] delivered us from the hand of the enemy
[1:55:28] of such as lay in weight by the way and
[1:55:31] we came to
[1:55:33] healing and we came to Jerusalem and we
[1:55:37] came to Miracles listen friends the
[1:55:39] Divine hand come down and B said God
[1:55:42] loves to take his children out of the
[1:55:45] hands of the enemy he loves by a
[1:55:48] delivering Angel to take his children
[1:55:51] out of the hands of enemy can I say this
[1:55:55] the devil has a
[1:55:58] grip and the devil gets grips in places
[1:56:02] he should never have them in he gets
[1:56:05] grips in Fellowship he gets grips in
[1:56:08] peace he gets grips in marriages he gets
[1:56:12] grips in young people come on Church you
[1:56:14] know I'm talking to you the devil gets
[1:56:16] grips in places that he should never put
[1:56:19] his hands listen what this word grip
[1:56:21] means it means to take a firm hold of it
[1:56:23] means an effective form of control over
[1:56:27] something so the Devil by fear gets a
[1:56:30] hold of a life and begins to effectively
[1:56:32] control that life by something but the
[1:56:35] pr of God says it like this he said the
[1:56:37] world is G by these two things right now
[1:56:39] the mark of the beast or the Seal of God
[1:56:42] he said now you say I got one Mark
[1:56:44] against me well that's just a mark but
[1:56:46] you never said you had one seal against
[1:56:50] you
[1:56:52] well I got a mark against me I got a
[1:56:54] mark against me a amen come on there any
[1:56:57] one of us can't raise our hands here and
[1:56:59] say we've got a mark against us
[1:57:00] somewhere but listen it never said a
[1:57:04] mark it never said a seal against you
[1:57:06] because a seal is a sign of
[1:57:11] ownership can I say this the mark
[1:57:14] against you don't own
[1:57:16] you Hallelujah the mark against you it
[1:57:20] don't own you the devil marked you he
[1:57:23] marked your spirit he might have marked
[1:57:25] your flesh he might have marked
[1:57:27] something in your spirit and got down
[1:57:29] into some secret areas but I come by
[1:57:31] here tonight to say devil you might have
[1:57:34] marked us but you don't own us you might
[1:57:37] have marked us but the Holy Ghost is the
[1:57:39] Seal of God and we are owned by the
[1:57:42] Divine hand so I'm going to stand here
[1:57:44] and say what a prophet said he said
[1:57:46] right now he said I snatch you I snatch
[1:57:50] you from the hand of the Christ I snatch
[1:57:53] you listen I'm going to do hand to hand
[1:57:55] combat right now Satan I snatch him I
[1:57:58] snatch him from Fear I snatch him from
[1:58:01] doubt I snatch him from nervousness I
[1:58:04] snatch him from condemnation I snatch
[1:58:06] him from unbelief I snatch them from
[1:58:09] questions about this
[1:58:12] message oh yeah oh yeah that devil

[2:02:05] said you got marks against
[2:02:08] you but the Lord reached down and got
[2:02:11] him you know why because Peter belonged
[2:02:15] to the
[2:02:19] Lord he's more interested in rescu in
[2:02:23] you oh

[2:03:01] remember where you went what you looked
[2:03:02] at what you talked about what you did
[2:03:03] who
[2:03:04] you the devil just starts piling all
[2:03:07] these
[2:03:08] up but a prophet said oh brother stop
[2:03:11] looking at
[2:03:13] yourself and look at your
[2:03:16] sacrifice if you can find any fault in
[2:03:18] that then all right but if you find no
[2:03:21] fault in
[2:03:24] that if you can find some fault in
[2:03:27] yourself if you can find some fault in
[2:03:30] your sacrifice then all right but if you
[2:03:32] find no fault in that then you're
[2:03:41] perfect you're
[2:03:46] perfect you know why cuz it's not you
[2:03:49] that God's accepted he accepted aced
[2:03:52] Christ and Christ accepted you and you
[2:03:55] are dead and your life is hid in God
[2:03:58] through Christ and you are sealed by the
[2:04:01] Holy Ghost are you ready for this and
[2:04:03] all the devils in hell can't turn you
[2:04:06] out of
[2:04:10] there you are God's
[2:04:14] Property God never looks at you
[2:04:19] Hallelujah he looks at
[2:04:23] Christ have you often heard me say in
[2:04:26] prayer take your hands off of God's
[2:04:29] Property have faith to claim your own
[2:04:32] that's right take your hands off of her
[2:04:35] take your hands off of him see
[2:04:39] faith
[2:04:42] faith faith will do
[2:04:45] it somebody say I belong to him I belong
[2:04:49] to him
[2:04:52] you know tonight I stand here as a
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:56] witness the devil can put his hands on
[2:05:01] you brother Austin he can't keep
[2:05:05] you hallu he can't keep
[2:05:08] you you know sometimes and I look across
[2:05:11] the building and the majority of the
[2:05:13] young people here probably been born and
[2:05:15] raised in the message give that
[2:05:17] privilege that Grace that God's given
[2:05:19] you but can I tell you sometimes you go
[2:05:21] go through
[2:05:23] things sometimes Believers go through
[2:05:29] things anybody been through
[2:05:31] anything and the things you go through
[2:05:34] the devil can get his hand in there and
[2:05:37] he can get a little grip in your
[2:05:40] life and he can start controlling you
[2:05:43] here and and and and oh
[2:05:46] mercy he'll get a little grip here and
[2:05:49] when the service gets to going real good
[2:05:50] and the anointings move moving and you
[2:05:52] want to raise your hands the devil's got
[2:05:53] a little grip right
[2:05:55] there and so you go to raise your hands
[2:05:57] when you go to raise it he
[2:05:59] grips or you really want to stand up and
[2:06:02] say Amen the word's really catching you
[2:06:04] and carrying you out in that Dimension
[2:06:06] and you go to stand up and just when you
[2:06:07] do all of a sudden here comes that
[2:06:09] little
[2:06:11] grip and he pulls you back down in your
[2:06:13] seat and then he starts talking to about
[2:06:16] all the marks against you and about all
[2:06:18] the mistakes and he starts talking about
[2:06:19] all them little things and so you just
[2:06:21] keep that little grip and then all of a
[2:06:23] sudden you say Okay devil I'm going to
[2:06:25] do a deal with you now here's what we're
[2:06:26] going to
[2:06:27] do they say this deals don't
[2:06:30] work somewhere or another you got to be
[2:06:34] snatched you got to be taken out of the
[2:06:37] devil's
[2:06:38] grip or can I say it like this the
[2:06:41] devil's grip has got to be taken off of
[2:06:45] you so as
[2:06:48] Believers as Believers we go through
[2:06:50] things some of you probably heard me
[2:06:52] testify this before but I just feel to
[2:06:54] share it right now several years ago
[2:06:56] brother Isaac Hatfield now he was with
[2:06:58] me there when we went to to New Zealand
[2:07:00] for the first time the week before the
[2:07:02] youth camp we had a camp an Outreach
[2:07:05] there and while we were having that
[2:07:06] Outreach there was a young lady stood up
[2:07:09] and she said these words she raised her
[2:07:11] hand they couldn't preach all they could
[2:07:12] do was just testify she said I want to
[2:07:15] just tell you about this God we're
[2:07:16] singing about to everybody walking by
[2:07:18] the market she says I was a born and
[2:07:20] raised in church church and she gives
[2:07:22] her testimony and she says but my family
[2:07:24] went through this and went through that
[2:07:26] she said but the God I'm singing about
[2:07:27] this way maker he's my God he's my
[2:07:30] savior he's always been my savior and I
[2:07:33] want you to know he can do anything for
[2:07:35] you she says I'm i' I'm in his hands
[2:07:37] basically what she was saying so we
[2:07:40] leave that and we go all the way to the
[2:07:41] youth camp and the first night of the
[2:07:43] youth camp now this is just watch how
[2:07:45] things work the first night of the Youth
[2:07:47] Camp we're on our way to church and I'm
[2:07:49] listening to brother brother W Martin
[2:07:51] sing this song devil we through you all
[2:07:52] know that song brother window song devil
[2:07:54] we through right I'm listening to that
[2:07:56] and just something come in my heart
[2:07:58] that's got to be played
[2:08:00] tonight that's got to be played in this
[2:08:02] meeting I said how am I going to play it
[2:08:04] I don't have the chord they don't have
[2:08:05] the internet the camp how are we going
[2:08:07] to play it so they start sending they
[2:08:09] start sending kids to their dorms to
[2:08:11] find cords and they finally found this
[2:08:13] right before I went up to pull pit this
[2:08:14] one girl come running with the cord she
[2:08:16] said here it is we pluged it up we
[2:08:17] played it devil we're through I went up
[2:08:19] and preached on face and reality when
[2:08:21] you come between God and Baal there's a
[2:08:23] showdown who's right and when I said the
[2:08:25] devil and God is in a showdown the the
[2:08:28] power just goes out in that building
[2:08:30] just just pitch black goes out and that
[2:08:32] girl that there's a girl falls over and
[2:08:35] she's laying there screaming holling and
[2:08:37] kicking we go down and we begin to pray
[2:08:39] and really quick we realize it's a
[2:08:41] demonic manifestation and we begin to
[2:08:43] pray and young people as I laid my hand
[2:08:45] on her and begin to pray that devil
[2:08:48] spoke up out of her and said these words
[2:08:49] you know what he said I I said in the
[2:08:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the
[2:08:53] word of God I cast you out and when I
[2:08:55] said that that devil spoke out and said
[2:08:58] what word just like that what word and I
[2:09:01] looked over brother Nathan there was a
[2:09:03] Bible and I said take this Bible sis and
[2:09:06] lay it on that girl's body and when they
[2:09:08] laid that Bible on her I said in the
[2:09:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ who wrote
[2:09:12] this word he is the God of this word he
[2:09:15] said we will cast out devils and in the
[2:09:17] name of Jesus Christ Satan take your
[2:09:19] hands off
[2:09:21] brother
[2:09:22] instantly instantly with these eyes I
[2:09:25] watched that girl sit up and start
[2:09:28] looking around and say I'm free I'm free
[2:09:32] I'm free I'm free you know what she said
[2:09:37] she she kicked her shoes off and said I
[2:09:39] want to praise God in the dance I'm free
[2:09:42] when the lights come on I realized that
[2:09:45] was the girl that had the chord to play
[2:09:48] that song but it was also the girl who
[2:09:50] testified the meeting about what God had
[2:09:53] done for her so I left there with this
[2:09:54] question how could she Testify the week
[2:09:58] before and that kind of manifestation
[2:10:00] the very next week and brother Ben I
[2:10:02] studied and studied and read and read
[2:10:04] and prayed and one day listening to a
[2:10:05] tape brother B says these words he says
