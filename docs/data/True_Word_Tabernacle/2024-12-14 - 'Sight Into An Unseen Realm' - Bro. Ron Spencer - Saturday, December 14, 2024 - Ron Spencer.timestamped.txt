[40:39] just seeing a cloud the size of a man's
[40:41] hand got so
[40:43] invigorated he got so revived and so
[40:46] renewed that he stood up and outran
[40:49] horses to the city of jezel and said
[40:52] cried out get out the
[40:54] buckets the rain is on the way I tell
[40:57] you I hope you brought a bucket with you
[40:59] tonight I hope you brought your barrel
[41:01] with you tonight I believe there's rain
[41:04] amen I believe it's time amen you know
[41:07] the prophet of God took that story and
[41:09] he said what happened there he said is
[41:11] that the prophet took the first move of
[41:13] it he took the first move of it and made
[41:16] the announcement no different than the
[41:18] man saw the water in the pool of
[41:19] Bethesda when he saw the movement the
[41:22] prophet said the first move of it he got
[41:25] in now if you come here tonight and you
[41:27] have a need your healing may be that
[41:30] first move of your healing may be just a
[41:33] whisper of of of something coming from
[41:35] that preacher when he says God can do
[41:38] certain certain thing and you feel that
[41:39] little thing flip over in you and say
[41:41] that's the truth that's the first move
[41:43] of it and what you are to do right then
[41:45] is begin to thank the Lord for the
[41:47] healing and you are to begin to say God
[41:49] I believe that I believe that's true you
[41:52] don't have to wait till the spirit
[41:53] sweeps you Plum off of your Pew to get
[41:56] started somebody say well I I'd like to
[41:57] have a blessing tonight you don't have
[41:59] to wait until the spirit takes you over

[42:09] and say God don't leave me here amen I
[42:12] want to hold on till he holds on don't

[52:25] earth now Lord we ask you to pass by our
[52:29] way Lord if we can get our minds off of
[52:32] what's going on today or tomorrow or

[53:35] Hebrews chapter
[53:37] [Music]
[53:44] 11 I'd like to speak to you for just a
[53:47] bit on
[53:49] sight into an unseen Realm
[53:57] Hebrews chap 11 and verse
[54:02] 1 maybe somebody will come to me
[54:05] tomorrow and say well brother Wayne just
[54:06] spoke on that a couple of weeks ago and
[54:09] so amen so I'm sure he did a better job
[54:13] I would but I'm really pleased to be
[54:16] here Hebrews chap 11 and verse one now
[54:20] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[54:23] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[54:27] for by it the elders obtained a good
[54:30] report and through faith we understand
[54:33] that the worlds were framed by the word
[54:36] of God so that things which are seen
[54:40] were not made of things which do do
[54:43] appear Einstein was asked about how
[54:46] things were created and he quoted that
[54:49] scripture right
[54:51] there now Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse
[54:54] 6 you don't have to turn there and then
[54:56] he answered and spake unto me saying
[54:59] this is the word of the Lord unto
[55:02] zerubabel saying it's not by might and
[55:05] it's not by power but by my spirit saith
[55:09] the Lord of hosts you can be seated this
[55:18] evening we serve a special
[55:21] God I think we all know that by now we
[55:24] serve a very special God now he's the
[55:27] kind of God that this might might may
[55:29] not blow your away but he's the kind of
[55:31] God that that can take nothing and make
[55:36] something out of
[55:38] it he takes absolutely nothing right and
[55:42] make something out of it for proof look
[55:46] in the
[55:52] mirror
[55:54] Amen in Luke chapter 1 in verse
[55:58] 26 and in the sixth month the angel
[56:01] Gabriel was sent from God unto the city
[56:05] of
[56:06] Galilee named nazarus and to a virgin
[56:10] espoused to a man whose name was Joseph
[56:13] of the House of David and the virgin's
[56:15] name was Mary and the angel came into
[56:19] her and said and hail Thou Art highly
[56:23] favored and the Lord is with thee
[56:25] blessed are thou among
[56:27] women and when she saw him she was
[56:30] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[56:32] mind what manner of salutation this
[56:35] should be and the angel said unto her
[56:38] fear not Mary for thou H has found favor
[56:43] with
[56:44] God I want that to be our
[56:47] testimony and behold Thou shalt conceive
[56:50] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[56:53] and shall call his name Jesus
[56:57] amen now
[56:59] notice notice these next words and he
[57:02] shall be great and shall be called the
[57:05] son of the highest and the Lord God
[57:08] shall give unto him the
[57:11] Throne of his of his father David and he
[57:15] shall reign over the house of Jacob
[57:18] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[57:21] be no
[57:22] end and then said Mary unto the angels
[57:26] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[57:29] man and the angel answered and said unto
[57:32] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[57:36] and the power of the highest shall
[57:39] overshadow thee therefore also the holy
[57:43] thing shall be born of thee shall be
[57:46] called The Son of
[57:50] God now I I just want to say this to
[57:53] you all of us as Christians
[57:57] message Believers Christians around the
[58:01] world hinge our
[58:04] belief on a teenager's
[58:13] witness there was not a thousand people
[58:16] to Echo the
[58:19] story so you can imagine the bloggers of
[58:22] that day
[58:28] right let me just go another step Isaiah
[58:32] 7 and verse1
[58:33] 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give
[58:36] you a
[58:38] sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and
[58:41] bear a
[58:42] son and shall call his name
[58:47] Emmanuel amen now no doubt Isaiah was
[58:52] preaching and as he's preaching he's
[58:54] exhorting the word
[58:57] and this quote drops
[59:02] out he's a
[59:05] man can you imagine the enemy fighting
[59:08] with
[59:11] him he has just spoken something
[59:17] impossible let me just say
[59:20] impossible he has just spoken something
[59:23] that is not
[59:25] natural to
[59:27] humanity and now he's spoken a prophetic
[59:31] word that will now circle the
[59:34] Earth for hundreds of years he'll never
[59:37] sit
[59:39] it right he'll never sit it but he will
[59:43] believe that that was not me
[59:48] speaking that was not me speaking or
[59:51] some school's thought
[59:53] speaking that was God spoke Through
[1:00:00] Me Genesis 3 and verse1
[1:00:04] 15 now God is speaking I will put
[1:00:08] enmity between thee and the woman and
[1:00:12] between thy seed and her seed and it
[1:00:16] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:00:20] bruise his
[1:00:21] heel let me just give you another
[1:00:24] scripture while we're here Revel S 5 and
[1:00:27] verse one and I saw in the right hand of
[1:00:30] him that sat on the throne a a book
[1:00:32] written within and on the backside seal
[1:00:35] with Seven Seals and I saw a strong
[1:00:38] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:00:41] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[1:00:43] the seals thereof it no man in heaven or
[1:00:46] nor in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:00:49] able to open the book and neither to
[1:00:51] look there on and I wept much because no
[1:00:55] man was found worthy to open and read
[1:00:57] the book neither to look there on and
[1:01:01] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[1:01:05] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:01:07] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:01:11] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[1:01:17] thereof I've taken just a couple of
[1:01:20] moments of your time to to take some
[1:01:24] scriptures and place them together of
[1:01:26] course I didn't do it the boss did put
[1:01:29] them together they would not mean much
[1:01:31] in a Baptist
[1:01:34] Church they would not mean much at any
[1:01:38] ecumenical
[1:01:40] school but to the people of the open
[1:01:48] book because of your sight yeah has been
[1:01:53] opened
[1:01:55] listen and don't never take that for
[1:01:58] granted your sight was open to where
[1:02:02] that not a another school throughout the
[1:02:05] ages was to able to open the book and
[1:02:09] figure to decode the scriptures and
[1:02:12] what's placed here and what's placed
[1:02:14] there it's always a
[1:02:16] puzzle and they did their very level
[1:02:19] best especially during the the man age
[1:02:22] to try to open the book
[1:02:26] but only the
[1:02:30] author and he couldn't open the book to
[1:02:33] people 400 years ago because you wasn't
[1:02:38] here so never allow the enemy to tell
[1:02:42] you that you're a
[1:02:45] nobody because you're a people of a
[1:02:47] special class a special
[1:02:52] designation Brother David read portion
[1:02:54] of this last night night
[1:02:57] and and he and I just would like to go
[1:03:00] back and read it again he says and he
[1:03:02] commanded his church to lift up their
[1:03:04] heads and end that day and and to look
[1:03:06] up for the Unseen Christ will be
[1:03:10] appearing pretty soon if we only walk by
[1:03:14] sight we would be children of darkness
[1:03:17] and sure enough now he said I'm glad so
[1:03:21] glad to know that there is a light that
[1:03:23] shines in every believer's heart until
[1:03:26] the Eternal day when Jesus shall come
[1:03:29] now it is a lesson to us to look at what
[1:03:33] Abraham did then not only to did did he
[1:03:37] believe it but he made ready for it he
[1:03:40] made preparations for this child that he
[1:03:43] saw by faith 25 years before the child
[1:03:47] ever came because he had considered that
[1:03:50] he he who told him was able to keep the
[1:03:55] promise
[1:03:57] that he had told him he didn't consider
[1:03:59] his own nature being a hundred years old
[1:04:02] his physical being or he did not
[1:04:05] consider at all the deadness of Sarah's
[1:04:07] womb of his wife Sarah and the writer of
[1:04:10] the Divine commentary tells us he
[1:04:12] staggered
[1:04:14] not at the the promise of God through
[1:04:17] unbelief but was strong giving glory to
[1:04:22] God what a person and what a place for
[1:04:26] brother brandom to say this in the book
[1:04:28] called looking at the
[1:04:37] Unseen I
[1:04:39] think I think when it comes to this
[1:04:42] season people get all
[1:04:46] religious they put a lot of different
[1:04:48] things together where you love it or
[1:04:51] whether you hate it that I'm not here to
[1:04:53] settle that for you but
[1:04:56] I I just presented something to you a
[1:04:58] little while ago that we are all hinging
[1:05:01] on the testimony of
[1:05:05] one now we're a people that have been
[1:05:08] gathered and this message is what
[1:05:10] brought us all
[1:05:12] together and we believe that a messenger
[1:05:15] met an angel in a
[1:05:18] cave and it's a testimony of
[1:05:22] one and then we believe that he that he
[1:05:25] met seven
[1:05:26] angels and it's the testimony of one but
[1:05:30] always remember it's more than just a
[1:05:32] testimony but there's results that comes
[1:05:35] with
[1:05:37] it are you with me the reason that we
[1:05:40] can believe that it was not just Mary
[1:05:43] but Mary believed
[1:05:46] it and then by believing it it be to
[1:05:49] manifest in her
[1:05:51] body and listen the birth of this child
[1:05:55] shook the
[1:05:57] earth a lot of babies are born every day
[1:05:59] but the birth of this child shook the
[1:06:02] Earth because in another realm that Dark
[1:06:06] Realm was watching for that light to be
[1:06:09] born cuz he had heard Isaiah 7 he had
[1:06:14] watched through Abraham and he stood
[1:06:16] there in the Garden of Eden and judged
[1:06:19] so he watched for that one to
[1:06:22] come so he knew when this girl begins to
[1:06:25] testify
[1:06:26] and a baby comes to life at his name
[1:06:30] that he knew that he was in
[1:06:32] trouble and he also knew that if this
[1:06:35] child being virgin he was going to
[1:06:38] cleanse God's mankind all the way back
[1:06:42] to the Garden not just all the way back
[1:06:45] to the Garden but all the way to
[1:06:51] here you know when we begin to think of
[1:06:54] the S things of
[1:06:56] sight some of us wear
[1:06:59] glasses some of us are nearsighted some
[1:07:02] of us are farsighted some of you got
[1:07:05] perfect eyes and until you get 40 to 50
[1:07:08] years old
[1:07:11] and every one of us see
[1:07:14] differently we all see
[1:07:19] differently if you don't believe that
[1:07:20] look who you married
[1:07:27] and I hope you get up every day and say
[1:07:29] you are the most beautiful woman in the
[1:07:35] world you didn't do that today do it
[1:07:44] now are you with me are you with
[1:07:49] me every day you tell her I love
[1:07:52] you you're special amen
[1:07:57] you you stepped out of Eternity into
[1:07:59] time and you spend this little hickey of
[1:08:02] time together one day you'll step back
[1:08:05] into eternity again and share
[1:08:08] eternity
[1:08:11] together brother R have had a bad
[1:08:13] marriage it was your
[1:08:19] choice I'm not here to fix that for you
[1:08:22] it's your choice
[1:08:32] you fix that next week you fix that next
[1:08:38] week now we're taught that this message
[1:08:41] is an eagle
[1:08:43] message and an eagle has an eye like no
[1:08:47] other
[1:08:48] bird as a as an incredible eye I'm not
[1:08:51] going to spend long on it but an eagle
[1:08:54] can see its prey
[1:08:56] three miles away yeah in exact detail
[1:09:00] yeah knows
[1:09:02] exactly where it's at what's going on
[1:09:05] with its
[1:09:08] surroundings that's a phenomenal
[1:09:10] thing as Believers your eyes have come
[1:09:13] open with isap that you're able to see
[1:09:18] things and we were trained and and you
[1:09:22] you guys are almost Bible scholars
[1:09:24] because of the message
[1:09:26] you were given a
[1:09:28] prophet that is a
[1:09:32] Seer and not just a Seer but he was
[1:09:35] allowed to look into things that no
[1:09:38] other messenger was ever allowed to look
[1:09:41] into and it wasn't just for his benefit
[1:09:45] it was for your
[1:09:47] benefit it allows the ministry in this
[1:09:51] age we've got young ministers sitting
[1:09:53] here listen you don't have to take your
[1:09:55] entire lifetime to figure things out in
[1:09:58] just a matter of a just short time
[1:10:01] you're preaching things that men spent
[1:10:04] their entire life trying to figure out
[1:10:06] because of the sight that you have been
[1:10:13] given now let's not discredit anything
[1:10:17] to someone that's blind right I just
[1:10:20] want to give you an example God fixes
[1:10:23] that as well and the best example I
[1:10:25] could give you is a lady named Fanny
[1:10:29] Crosby now listen she she lived in a
[1:10:32] realm towar that she was poverty
[1:10:35] stricken she was extremely poor but she
[1:10:40] was extremely
[1:10:43] anointed can we say that she was one of
[1:10:46] the best songwriters that ever
[1:10:50] lived and she refused to sell her gift
[1:10:55] to to the
[1:10:56] world she would go to a single prison
[1:10:59] meeting and someone would scream out
[1:11:02] Don't Pass Me By and she would write a
[1:11:06] song that when many of us came to the
[1:11:09] altar savior
[1:11:11] savior but she would also be be made fun
[1:11:16] of to where that they would say how will
[1:11:18] you know him you've been blind all your
[1:11:21] life how will you know it and As She's
[1:11:24] Walking Away she said I shall know him I
[1:11:27] shall know him by the nail prints in his
[1:11:32] hands one of her testimonies is is is
[1:11:36] I'm thankful that I didn't see the light
[1:11:38] of day so my my eyes come open the first
[1:11:43] thing that I see will be my
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:47] Jesus I would say that sight Way Beyond
[1:11:52] Humanity sight
[1:11:55] am
[1:11:57] amen would you agree with
[1:12:00] that
[1:12:02] now let me just let me just touch into
[1:12:07] something right here you are you are a
[1:12:13] vision of
[1:12:14] God and being a vision of God God
[1:12:17] thought of you I couldn't put it any
[1:12:20] better than last night but God thought
[1:12:22] of you before the foundation of the
[1:12:24] world yeah and you realize that when God
[1:12:27] thought of you he will never unthink of
[1:12:31] you I want you to think about that in
[1:12:34] your darkest season God never
[1:12:42] unthink God never gets in a
[1:12:46] crisis God never gives up on
[1:12:49] you he doesn't allow the temporary
[1:12:53] condition that you're in
[1:12:57] so quit beating yourself up on the the
[1:12:59] temporary Horrors that you're going
[1:13:04] through God saw way past the horrors of
[1:13:08] this
[1:13:08] moment let me just drop something cuz I
[1:13:11] just felt something let me just say your
[1:13:14] dark storm that you're going through
[1:13:16] right
[1:13:17] now if you could only see the Rainbow on
[1:13:22] the other side
[1:13:26] God is allowing you to go through
[1:13:29] incredible
[1:13:31] storms
[1:13:34] to to give you Victory when you get
[1:13:38] through the other
[1:13:42] side there has never been a miracle
[1:13:45] without a
[1:13:49] mess are you with me there's always a
[1:13:53] reason for the storm that you're going
[1:13:59] through are you with me now Isaac was
[1:14:03] blind and no doubt wondered why I'm
[1:14:06] blind but he had to be
[1:14:09] blind to bless
[1:14:13] Jacob he staggered he no doubt fell many
[1:14:17] times as an old blind
[1:14:20] man but he would have never in his
[1:14:23] Humanity
[1:14:25] ever blessed
[1:14:28] Jacob are you getting it now he was a
[1:14:31] stinker he was a rascal he was a
[1:14:36] booger are you with me no doubt Satan
[1:14:39] looks at some of the people that sitting
[1:14:41] in this building say God is this your
[1:14:44] best
[1:14:46] yes yes this is my
[1:14:52] best cuz God sees something that the
[1:14:54] devil devil can't
[1:14:56] see it's a predestinated
[1:14:59] seed that he put
[1:15:09] there God takes nothing and make
[1:15:11] something out of it
[1:15:14] right you know I don't know particularly
[1:15:17] how many times Mary told the story that
[1:15:20] she met an
[1:15:22] angel but we have no recording
[1:15:25] of anybody else walking the same path
[1:15:28] saw the same
[1:15:32] Angel we have we have no recordings oh
[1:15:35] yeah he was six foot tall he was dark
[1:15:37] complected hair down to his shoulders he
[1:15:40] was standing there had a Radiance about
[1:15:41] him had a certain way that he
[1:15:43] spoke
[1:15:45] no the only person that said that was a
[1:15:49] was a girl
[1:15:50] yeah and and let me just say we have
[1:15:54] nowhere in thist scriptures that said
[1:15:55] that he went to a thousand women before
[1:15:58] he picked
[1:16:03] Mary are you with me so he bypassed a
[1:16:08] million to get to where you
[1:16:13] are and you're sitting in a meeting
[1:16:16] maybe you're sitting here tonight for
[1:16:17] your first night and you go well it's an
[1:16:19] accident I just told my family I would
[1:16:21] go and and I'm there and I'm here now
[1:16:24] and and that pull that's on your heart
[1:16:27] it's not the
[1:16:29] humanity God watched over you way before
[1:16:32] you was ever
[1:16:36] born so we're here to declare the vision
[1:16:41] of God brother Brandon would use a
[1:16:43] statement he said you're the living
[1:16:45] physical attributes of God that God
[1:16:49] thought of before the foundation of the
[1:16:52] world so God literally brings you out of
[1:16:55] total chaos and darkness and illuminates
[1:16:58] the light to live on the inside of you
[1:17:01] and you know when you was in control of
[1:17:03] your life you were just constantly in a
[1:17:11] mess and the enemy will tell you back in
[1:17:13] the good old days there was nothing
[1:17:18] good don't buy that load of
[1:17:21] nonsense they was not good old days
[1:17:25] am well back when I was in charge of
[1:17:27] this body yeah you was a
[1:17:30] mess you couldn't keep your story
[1:17:32] straight you were constantly into
[1:17:35] trouble you were doing things you was
[1:17:38] one choice to another choice and but
[1:17:41] when God begin to get a hold to your
[1:17:43] life and begin to straighten you up sure
[1:17:45] it's a
[1:17:47] process he took a long time to get you
[1:17:50] here he just don't go poof and you're on
[1:17:54] that's right it's a process it's a birth
[1:17:57] it's a
[1:17:59] mess and some of you still at work in
[1:18:07] it and remember God can only use what
[1:18:09] you
[1:18:10] surrender some of you can only surrender
[1:18:13] 10% of your life or 20% of your life
[1:18:16] some
[1:18:17] 100 but the more you surrender to your
[1:18:20] life the more he can use
[1:18:24] yeah are you with me
[1:18:28] now a't it
[1:18:31] wonderful
[1:18:32] now I know all of you know the squirrel
[1:18:37] story and so brother brandham tells it
[1:18:41] over and over again doesn't change the
[1:18:44] details of it and it's almost like you
[1:18:48] you've heard this you were there you
[1:18:51] know go to the place that you call
[1:18:53] Sportsman holler you call
[1:18:55] Sportsman and he goes
[1:18:58] there and begins to talk to him how many
[1:19:01] what are you hunting for squirrels how
[1:19:04] many would you like to have and he said
[1:19:06] three and I'm just going real quickly
[1:19:09] here and he and he begin to where would
[1:19:13] you like it at and he begin to speak
[1:19:17] something out of
[1:19:21] nothing are you with me he began to
[1:19:24] speak something out of nothing this was
[1:19:27] another
[1:19:28] level that's right this was another
[1:19:32] level and he begins to speak
[1:19:37] creation and he's speaking it's not 100
[1:19:40] people
[1:19:41] watching it's a prophet and God and he's
[1:19:46] showing how it operates now he's not
[1:19:48] doing this just for brother
[1:19:51] Brandon he's doing this for you
[1:19:55] and he shoots the first
[1:19:58] one and then he shoots the second
[1:20:01] one and and he said I thought you said
[1:20:05] three has to remind him you said
[1:20:08] three and he said I thought I would I
[1:20:11] thought I would pick a place to where
[1:20:13] that would be impossible where a
[1:20:14] squirrel wouldn't be have him to come
[1:20:17] down this way and he was picking an
[1:20:20] impossible situation have you come down
[1:20:22] this way and be there and be in that
[1:20:26] spot and he shot him are you with me
[1:20:32] now here we are operating in the third
[1:20:36] pull this is a level Way Beyond anything
[1:20:40] that anybody else has been a a part of
[1:20:43] and notice who's with
[1:20:45] him the
[1:20:49] enemy and the enemy begins to tell him
[1:20:53] why the woods are full of
[1:20:59] squirrels the woods are full of
[1:21:01] squirrels he tries to get rid of the
[1:21:05] supernatural
[1:21:08] immediately because if this story gets
[1:21:10] out it can create spontaneous
[1:21:15] combustion there will be a people that
[1:21:17] actually believe that they can step into
[1:21:20] that and live an overcoming life now we
[1:21:24] don't need squirrels we just need to
[1:21:30] [Applause]
[1:21:32] overcome so the enemy's there with him
[1:21:35] and I it hit me not long ago it hit me
[1:21:40] that brother brandham hunted till
[1:21:45] 12:00 just to prove the enemy
[1:21:48] wrong but remember he asked for three
[1:21:51] not a dozen and so he sits there
[1:21:55] you know in the prophet's time is
[1:21:57] important too and he sits
[1:22:00] there just to prove to the enemy you're
[1:22:06] wrong there's going to be some quiet
[1:22:08] times that the enem is whispering in
[1:22:10] your ear just sit there and prove to the
[1:22:16] enemy the enemy say in the woods full of
[1:22:18] squirrels did another one show up
[1:22:28] brother biscos and we just shared this
[1:22:30] earlier they didn't know it was in my
[1:22:31] notes brother bisc said that
[1:22:36] had those horns been 42 in and a
[1:22:41] quarter a quarter I wouldn't have he
[1:22:44] said I wouldn't even be
[1:22:46] here but they was
[1:22:50] exactly 42 in
[1:22:54] that's right listen there's not another
[1:22:57] Ministry on the earth that has these
[1:22:59] kind of
[1:23:02] indications now if you remember when
[1:23:04] that that animal's
[1:23:08] killed the vision is only half
[1:23:12] complete and they're going down off of
[1:23:14] the mountain and brother brandham asked
[1:23:16] do you see that grizzly bear and and and
[1:23:19] you know the story that I don't brother
[1:23:21] Bud says I don't see him I I can look
[1:23:23] for miles and I see him nowhere and
[1:23:25] brother brand I'm actually ask him are
[1:23:27] you doubting the
[1:23:30] vision I so I wonder sometimes do we sit
[1:23:33] in church and doubt the
[1:23:39] supernatural oh we can get the intellect
[1:23:41] and the A's and the B's and the pluses
[1:23:43] and the we can get the mechanics all
[1:23:46] worked out we can be as legalist as we
[1:23:50] can possibly
[1:23:52] be we can be as hard knock as we can be
[1:23:55] I'm here it's me and my four and no more
[1:23:58] but listen you are the people that are
[1:24:03] designed not just for miracle over
[1:24:05] cancer but your body is going to be
[1:24:09] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[1:24:12] of an
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:18] eye so we are in the season of
[1:24:22] Supernatural That's Right
[1:24:25] amen are you with me don't get caught in
[1:24:28] the season of
[1:24:30] manage to where everything has to be
[1:24:32] dotted eyes and crossed te cuz Faith is
[1:24:36] another
[1:24:38] real this is for a faith Way Beyond the
[1:24:41] common cold or Way Beyond cancer Way
[1:24:45] Beyond the demon spirit that you're
[1:24:47] fighting with Way Beyond that because
[1:24:51] your promise is you get a body
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:00] change and yes your enemy is at the same
[1:25:03] point like he was with brother Brandon
[1:25:05] with three squirrels ah you know
[1:25:07] everybody believes in a Rapture
[1:25:08] everybody but somebody's going to take
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:14] it somebody's going to step into
[1:25:18] it somebody's going to look in the
[1:25:20] mirror and they're not gray-headed
[1:25:23] anymore and they won't need glasses and
[1:25:26] they won't be stoop
[1:25:34] shouldered how would you like to been

[1:27:55] time and I tried not to show it much but
[1:28:00] as brother Wayne would take me to their
[1:28:02] greenhouse and I would see that for the
[1:28:04] first time I would walk in and the boys

[1:36:19] the roof and and I just tell him brother
[1:36:22] Jim's been going on now a few years and
[1:36:25] and I'm slipping down the roofs and he's
[1:36:26] telling me he said you got to hang on
[1:36:28] you got to put pressure on I said listen
[1:36:31] back in my normal life I didn't wear

[1:36:41] them well I'm slipping and I'm going
[1:36:43] down and I'm going down and I'm I I keep
[1:36:45] going down he said you're such a
[1:36:51] rookie listen I woke up
[1:36:55] trying to keep my food on that
[1:36:59] roof and Connie asked me said what you
[1:37:01] doing I said I'm cleaning a
[1:37:14] roof can I tell a couple
[1:37:18] more I'm not trying to make myself
[1:37:20] anything but I want to tell you how big
[1:37:21] is our God
[1:37:24] how big is our God we're after the
[1:37:27] meeting at brother viscos at brother Tom
[1:37:29] rays and we're standing at brother Tom
[1:37:32] Ray's living room and we're backed up
[1:37:35] beside of a of a fireplace and brother
[1:37:38] Murphy Wong is standing with me and and
[1:37:41] we're just standing there we we're not
[1:37:44] we're just talking life and I said
[1:37:47] brother Murphy I see a vision of a
[1:37:49] baby and he's thinking not me
[1:37:56] he's thinking not
[1:37:58] me but what he didn't realize is his
[1:38:01] daughter they would come to find out
[1:38:03] that she was impossible for her to have
[1:38:05] a
[1:38:07] child but God was showing
[1:38:10] them I see
[1:38:14] past now I'm going to preach to you I
[1:38:17] see past your impossibilities
[1:38:26] are you with me so somewhere in British
[1:38:29] Columbia tonight there's a
[1:38:31] baby that was an
[1:38:34] impossibility Zach has a baby in his
[1:38:36] hand that was an impossibility I have a
[1:38:39] grand child that was an
[1:38:42] impossibility that's
[1:38:45] right are you with me
[1:38:48] now is't he
[1:38:50] wonderful I mean isn't he wonderful
[1:39:00] so it's not enough just for the prophet
[1:39:02] to see
[1:39:03] it but do you see
[1:39:05] it it just wasn't enough for the word to
[1:39:08] come
[1:39:10] open but can you see
[1:39:13] it
[1:39:15] now I would assume that all of you have
[1:39:18] keys to your
[1:39:21] house amen amen
[1:39:24] I would assume or you have a little
[1:39:25] button that you
[1:39:28] push you have a little button that you
[1:39:31] push
[1:39:32] it and so the other day I was at at the
[1:39:36] Ford dealership for my daughter to pick
[1:39:39] up their Ford
[1:39:40] truck and they had never accessed that
[1:39:43] little panel of buttons on there of
[1:39:47] numbers and they had locked the keys in
[1:39:49] the
[1:39:50] truck and I had went there I drove 30
[1:39:52] minutes to Pi pick it up I would I
[1:39:54] wouldn't if this if this didn't work out
[1:39:56] I was going to have to drive 30 minutes
[1:39:57] home and then 30 minutes back
[1:40:00] and so I walk into the to the guy I said
[1:40:03] Hey listen I'm in a situation I really
[1:40:05] don't want to drive home and drive back
[1:40:07] here and there's a there's a numbers
[1:40:09] panel on the on the door and I said they
[1:40:12] didn't set that up and he said well I
[1:40:15] can't do anything for you and I said
[1:40:17] well get me somebody else
[1:40:25] so an old fellow came over and I said
[1:40:26] listen I know when it came from the
[1:40:28] company when it came from the company
[1:40:31] there's got to be numbers that were
[1:40:32] punched into that to see if it would
[1:40:38] work and he said well let me search the
[1:40:41] history of that truck when it was built
[1:40:43] and he said maybe in the identification
[1:40:45] they've got the numbers there and he was
[1:40:47] there about 30 seconds he said here's
[1:40:49] your
[1:40:51] number that's right I walked out and
[1:40:54] punched the numbers in there took a
[1:40:55] picture of it made sure that I wouldn't
[1:40:57] forget it I punched the numbers in there
[1:40:59] and got in started the truck and drove
[1:41:01] it
[1:41:05] home listen many of you said in Baptist
[1:41:07] churches and all different kind of
[1:41:09] churches and you had numbers in
[1:41:12] there there was a seed that was inside
[1:41:15] of there and you thought you were in the
[1:41:18] right spot you thought everything was
[1:41:20] okay until the light shined in the
[1:41:23] darkest of
[1:41:26] places and you realize you was a diamond
[1:41:29] in the chaos of
[1:41:31] night and you couldn't see past the
[1:41:34] storms or the chaos or the religion that
[1:41:37] you was in but one day God gave you
[1:41:42] access to see yourself in the
[1:41:47] vision listen folks is all you saw was
[1:41:50] William brandom you missed the picture
[1:41:53] if all you saw was Revelations 10:1 you
[1:41:56] missed the picture you've got to see
[1:42:03] yourself you got to see yourself in
[1:42:08] it and God sent you here with
[1:42:12] purpose not just to see if he could do
[1:42:15] it he sent you here with
[1:42:20] purpose he came 2,000 years ago with
[1:42:32] purpose brother Ron I I sometimes can't
[1:42:35] figure it out the scripture specifically
[1:42:39] says that Mary
[1:42:43] pondered these things in her
[1:42:50] heart I'm going to take you over
[1:42:52] something and that just a few things
[1:42:55] that listen God gave me this in
[1:42:57] September so don't think this is a
[1:42:59] Christmas

[1:43:08] booger besides that how many Christmas

[1:54:58] people some of the most phenomenal
[1:55:00] Miracles ever happened in humanity he's

[1:55:26] changed but he stepped into another
[1:55:30] realm are you with me and he began to
[1:55:33] see things that you and I can't see but
[1:55:37] because he was a prophet Seer he allowed
[1:55:40] us to look with
[1:55:43] him and we heard him
[1:55:46] say
[1:55:48] converts they're your converts are they
[1:55:51] all brand no they're your
[1:55:54] converts and a 95y old woman walks up
[1:55:57] and she's in the flower of her
[1:56:00] youth others come up and hug him and
[1:56:04] women came and hug him
[1:56:05] and why you know by Brother brand he
[1:56:08] never let women hug
[1:56:10] him but there was no sensation there I
[1:56:14] talked to you about a dream a little
[1:56:15] while ago and you get the emotions of a
[1:56:17] dream you get emotions cuz it takes you
[1:56:20] somewhere
[1:56:22] but brother brandom was in a realm that
[1:56:24] was more real than this
[1:56:28] realm we talk about future home listen
[1:56:31] it's already in the
[1:56:34] preparation because we heard the author
[1:56:36] of the book said let not your heart be
[1:56:39] troubled you believe in God believe also
[1:56:41] in me in my father's house are many
[1:56:44] mansions brother man said that wasn't
[1:56:46] brick and stone and
[1:56:48] mortar he's prepared you a body right
[1:56:54] are you with me you'll never need that
[1:56:56] chair Charlie
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:01] anymore you don't need those glasses
[1:57:09] anymore brother brandom Harley wanted to
[1:57:11] come back to this
[1:57:17] realm we were at a funeral my father's
[1:57:20] funeral
[1:57:23] and the man that was taking care of my
[1:57:25] father's funeral told me and my my boys
[1:57:29] and brother Tim PR we all could take 10
[1:57:32] minutes a
[1:57:37] piece I know what you're
[1:57:44] thinking brother Tim was sitting beside
[1:57:47] of me and he punched in his clock on his
[1:57:50] iPad 10 minutes
[1:57:53] minutes and he got up and he began to
[1:57:56] speak about when Jesus called Lazarus
[1:57:59] back from the
[1:58:05] tomb and he said Jesus
[1:58:10] wept he began to talk about more than
[1:58:13] just it was more than just their
[1:58:16] unbelief but he said Jesus knew that he
[1:58:19] was calling him back to this world
[1:58:24] yeah and the world that he was in what
[1:58:28] it was like but calling him back to this
[1:58:33] world
[1:58:35] heartache
[1:58:37] politics
[1:58:39] sickness and he said Jesus
[1:58:43] wept that he had to call him back
[1:58:46] here and brother Jonathan as he be to
[1:58:49] say that as he said I didn't want to
[1:58:51] call him back and that clock went
[1:58:55] 9:57
[1:58:57] 9:58 and he just closed his iPad and
[1:59:00] stepped over and he looked over at me
[1:59:01] and said I
[1:59:09] didn't I have to be honest with you I
[1:59:12] had never saw it like
[1:59:13] that I be honest I had never saw the
[1:59:17] scriptures quite like that but a
[1:59:19] minister of God had been allowed to see
[1:59:24] something when brother Wayne steps to
[1:59:27] the pull pit and he just takes things
[1:59:29] that you've heard for decades and all of
[1:59:32] a sudden you go I never saw it like
[1:59:37] that I never saw it like that cuz God
[1:59:40] wants to increase your
[1:59:51] vision we're preparing to have a prayer
[1:59:53] line so I'd like to just turn our
[1:59:56] thoughts just for a
[2:00:01] moment there was a
[2:00:03] congressman went to a
[2:00:07] meeting and he had been in a spot to
[2:00:09] where that he needed help
[2:00:12] walking for decades
[2:00:17] decades
[2:00:19] now maybe just because of other hundreds
[2:00:22] of people wor going he was influenced to
[2:00:26] come but something caused him to be
[2:00:32] there something moved him to be there
[2:00:41] now he wasn't there when the angel told
[2:00:44] Brother brandham you'll pray for
[2:00:46] potentates and Kings ambassadors
[2:00:52] when the angel was in the cave he didn't
[2:00:54] call Congressman upshaw's
[2:00:58] name but he knew that prophecy would
[2:01:01] intercept with
[2:01:04] time and so brother brandom's preaching
[2:01:07] the meeting he's been called to preach
[2:01:08] the meeting and he's standing there and
[2:01:11] he comes to a certain place and I see a
[2:01:14] man and he begins to give him
[2:01:18] descriptions I I don't need to tell you
[2:01:20] the story but a man begins to read
[2:01:22] respond it's like an inspired word to an
[2:01:25] inspired
[2:01:27] seed and as the word Goes Forth all of a
[2:01:30] sudden you begin to go that's the
[2:01:35] truth and you begin to realize I am the
[2:01:38] man that's in the
[2:01:41] vision I'm not going to be in a
[2:01:43] wheelchair no longer I'm not going to be
[2:01:45] handicapped
[2:01:52] now let me just take you back to another
[2:01:53] part of the
[2:01:54] sermon brother brandom leaves
[2:01:58] honey and he goes to the poorest person
[2:02:00] in his
[2:02:03] church and she doesn't realize that
[2:02:06] she's going to step into an eternal
[2:02:11] situation and he's telling her about
[2:02:14] hunting and what the angel told and
[2:02:16] those three squirrels and how it all
[2:02:18] happened and she just responds
[2:02:22] and in her
[2:02:26] response something came out of
[2:02:33] nothing now you can argue all you want
[2:02:36] to of how those boys what they did I
[2:02:39] don't know their history but let me just
[2:02:41] say this to you if two boys ever is in
[2:02:43] heaven those two boys will be
[2:02:52] she stepped into a
[2:02:55] realm a supernatural anointing hit
[2:03:05] her a PL is
[2:03:09] delay brother brandham starts
[2:03:13] walking looks in the window which way
[2:03:16] should I
[2:03:17] go sees a police officer just starts
[2:03:23] walking and he walks by a
[2:03:25] woman good morning good morning ay good
[2:03:29] morning Parson how'd you know I was a
[2:03:33] paron early this morning I was
[2:03:39] praying now she sees herself in the
[2:03:42] vision and she likened herself to a
[2:03:45] character in the scriptures I be like
[2:03:47] the sudoite woman where is my Elijah
[2:03:53] you can take this and preach
[2:04:00] months brother random will tell brother
[2:04:02] bisc that that woman used the same power
[2:04:06] that he used to speak the storm out of
[2:04:10] existence she used that power to speak a
[2:04:13] storm into existence
[2:04:23] you think your need's not
[2:04:30] important the enem is whispering in your
[2:04:32] ear there's squirrels
[2:04:34] everywhere can you imagine Mary The
[2:04:38] Whispers in her
[2:04:42] ear and she held the testimony strong
[2:04:46] when there was rumors going
[2:04:49] around and they were wanting to rock her
[2:04:51] and kill her and Joseph has to protect
[2:04:55] her that's an illegitimate baby that
[2:04:57] you're carrying around and Simeon and
[2:05:00] Anna comes rejoicing and everybody else
[2:05:03] is throwing a
[2:05:05] fit it depends on what you
[2:05:16] see you took a picture of us before
[2:05:19] service

[2:05:24] that
[2:05:27] story won't you

[2:05:38] I'm I'm
[2:05:41] overtime but you get you get paid more
[2:05:43] for overtime

[2:05:50] morning
[2:05:52] and I didn't even know this man was in
[2:05:54] the building and I was preaching on how
[2:05:57] that God uses
[2:05:59] men and brother bcll called my wife when
[2:06:03] I was in one hospital and my son was in

[2:06:12] fire my lungs were burned up and brother

[2:06:32] standing there telling him that that I
[2:06:34] wouldn't live through the day and she
[2:06:37] has heard a preacher that has talked to
[2:06:40] a higher
[2:06:43] source and she would go three weeks
[2:06:47] holding the testimony
[2:06:52] she was looking at a man on a on a
[2:06:55] respirator and they it was at 100% and
[2:06:58] it wasn't keeping up but God was saying

[2:12:04] me all kind of nonsense all I know was
[2:12:08] if God saw
[2:12:10] it who am I to unsee
[2:12:17] it I don't care H I don't care where
[2:12:20] this goes either I don't care how many

[2:12:29] preach I was only
[2:12:35] there and listen the god that called you
[2:12:40] will be there under every
[2:12:43] pressure under every situation
[2:12:59] I'll finish with
[2:13:01] this I saw brother Wayne
[2:13:03] here and I saw it
[2:13:08] blessed now when God shows you something
[2:13:11] he don't say you know I I I maybe
[2:13:15] shouldn't have said it like quite like
[2:13:18] that listen
[2:13:21] when God sees something and shows you
[2:13:24] something you can't unsee
[2:13:27] it now I'm coming to
[2:13:30] you when God begins to deal with your
[2:13:33] heart and begins to lead you into the
[2:13:36] way of Salvation then the Satan begins
[2:13:39] to battle against you don't let your
[2:13:42] Humanity unsee what God had showed you
[2:13:51] I don't care what trial you're going
[2:13:53] through God's got the
[2:14:02] answer the house was destroyed it's only
[2:14:05] a temporary place if you could see the
[2:14:08] house that he's got for
[2:14:11] you a matter of fact you can't buy one
[2:14:14] in this County or in this area like what
[2:14:17] God's prepared for you
[2:14:24] Ron and fighting disease I don't know
[2:14:25] how I'm going to get out of
[2:14:27] it let let me just say this to you if
[2:14:30] you could just see past what you're
[2:14:40] fighting listen I I want to I want to
[2:14:43] just caution you here this is not a
[2:14:48] motion this is not a tech talk
[2:14:52] right this is not this is not just
[2:14:54] somebody coming putting some as's and
[2:14:55] B's together for you a service can
[2:14:59] change your life and you're never the
[2:15:02] same the rest of your
[2:15:07] lives are you with me
[2:15:09] now what makes these men so
[2:15:13] special is because they see you as a
[2:15:17] diamond because God shows them that yeah
[2:15:20] and you yet you're the woman at the
[2:15:25] well and the devil's whispered in their
[2:15:28] ear you'll never do nothing with them
[2:15:29] you'll never do nothing with them and
[2:15:32] they're going by the word of God and
[2:15:34] they see you
[2:15:37] mature and you begin to see what they
[2:15:41] see and then they hear Echoes of rumors
[2:15:44] of other people well I don't even like
[2:15:45] her being in the church I don't like him
[2:15:47] being in the church
[2:15:51] can we take a moment to see what God
[2:15:58] sees can we take a moment to see what
[2:16:02] God
[2:16:10] sees because if we can see what God sees
[2:16:14] we're
[2:16:18] undefeatable what a thought what a
[2:16:20] thought thought hallelujah what I
[2:16:22] thought
[2:16:24] amen beautiful
[2:16:31] picture I put this note on the very
[2:16:36] end I find it absolutely
[2:16:39] amazing that brother
[2:16:42] Ray has been given the length of Life
[2:16:48] yeah and the powerful preacher that he
[2:16:51] is and I'm talking about
[2:16:54] powerful but no doubt he preached to 10
[2:16:57] and 20 people and
[2:16:59] struggled and
[2:17:02] struggled and go from service to service
[2:17:04] to
[2:17:06] service he couldn't see a
[2:17:10] Wayne on on he was just trying to find
[2:17:14] his own children in the
[2:17:19] picture but if he could look back to
[2:17:22] where he was and to look to where he
[2:17:25] is stupid
[2:17:44] devil it call guys like you
[2:17:48] Legends no matter what the devil
[2:17:50] whispering in your ear at this
[2:17:56] point you're in a you're in a dangerous
[2:17:59] spot Brother
[2:18:00] Ray I'm just going to put you right on
[2:18:02] notice Brother Ray is in a dangerous
[2:18:05] spot for the Devil he's in a really
[2:18:07] dangerous spot money won't buy him women
[2:18:11] won't buy him a bigger house won't buy
[2:18:15] him religion won't buy him he has sold
[2:18:19] out he has run
[2:18:22] race we expected you to see the Rapture
[2:18:25] brother race so don't get in a hurry to
[2:18:26] go
[2:18:40] anywhere why'd you do that brother Ron
[2:18:43] there's young people here don't know
[2:18:44] what the cost that he had to go through
[2:18:46] the cost of what these guys have had to
[2:18:48] go through to be
[2:18:52] you're only looking with naked eyes if
[2:18:54] you could really see the victories
[2:19:00] and why'd you do all that brother Ron
[2:19:03] because I think sometimes we walk into a
[2:19:05] service at Saturday night you look at
[2:19:06] your clock and go he's preached he's
[2:19:09] preached an hour and a
[2:19:12] half I want to ask you did you get
[2:19:17] it did you get it
[2:19:21] you with the pink tie right there little
[2:19:23] guy yeah come
[2:19:27] here
[2:19:32] yeah come on up here with me I like to
[2:19:35] talk to people shorter than
[2:19:46] me I don't know what you
[2:19:48] see but this is Satan's worst
[2:19:55] nightmare what's your name
[2:19:58] Gabriel named after an
[2:20:01] Angel that's why you'll be tall dark
[2:20:04] complected
[2:20:10] handsome you were named after Angel so
[2:20:13] it's fitting that you will look like
[2:20:19] one who your
[2:20:23] parents
[2:20:29] whoa I come to a meeting I don't know
[2:20:33] anybody sister Connie comes to a meeting
[2:20:36] she knows whose cousins
[2:20:40] who's so maybe I should have consulted
[2:20:42] Connie before this
[2:20:47] exercise so what happens as you grow up
[2:20:49] in a preacher's home
[2:20:54] there's something that Satan knows if
[2:20:57] you really get
[2:20:59] this you will be a
[2:21:02] nightmare to the to the kingdom of hell
[2:21:06] you will be an absolute
[2:21:08] Nightmare and you roll out of their bed
[2:21:12] and you go on your knees how old are
[2:21:15] you 15

[2:21:24] years old you go I don't know if I'm
[2:21:26] doing it for the kingdom of God but you
[2:21:28] begin to pray and you pray for peace and
[2:21:30] you pray that God strengthens you and
[2:21:32] you pray for more of the Holy
[2:21:36] Ghost you're not gaming you're not
[2:21:38] looking at bad things and you're shaking
[2:21:40] the kingdom of hell and Sodom is nowhere
[2:21:42] getting close to you and you're shaking
[2:21:45] the kingdom of Hell at 13 years old

[2:22:41] brother Ron I don't believe in prayer
[2:22:43] lines I I don't think they're needed let
[2:22:46] me explain to you I could spend the next
[2:22:48] week telling you the mirac that I've
[2:22:54] saw walking through prayer lines cancer
[2:22:59] going to die in the next couple of days
[2:23:01] right and living today Living Well
[2:23:05] cancer
[2:23:06] free a lady carrying a dead baby going
[2:23:09] to take the baby on Tuesday and listen
[2:23:12] comes through the prayer line and a
[2:23:14] healthy baby is
[2:23:17] born listen don't let your unbelief
[2:23:21] block your
[2:23:24] vision the scripture said that these
[2:23:26] signs shall follow them that
[2:23:30] believe I don't know how many ministers
[2:23:32] that we have here but listen we are told
[2:23:35] that when we lay hands on the sick that
[2:23:37] there is a light between these hands and
[2:23:41] your
[2:23:42] body it isn't because of the man it's
[2:23:46] because of the word of God and the
[2:23:48] promise of God
[2:23:51] we can't heal
[2:23:53] you but the healer's in the
[2:23:57] house I can't have the vision for you
[2:24:00] but if you can see past your
[2:24:08] trial with me let's bow our heads now
[2:24:11] Heavenly Father
[2:24:25] what an
[2:24:26] anointing is in this
[2:24:29] room what an atmosphere is
[2:24:34] here we tell these stories and not to
[2:24:37] embellish any of them but to show how
[2:24:40] bigger God
[2:24:46] is you have proved yourself faithful
[2:24:50] and
[2:24:52] Lord you gave me these
[2:25:00] words instructions to
[2:25:07] preach I don't know who's sick and who's
[2:25:10] not but all I know
[2:25:14] is for myself I believe I can see past
[2:25:17] cancer
[2:25:20] see past organs that are not functioning
[2:25:29] well I'm accepting meetings for next
[2:25:32] year because I believe I I'll be here to
[2:25:36] preach
[2:25:38] them I'm not looking at what doctors
[2:25:40] tell me I'm looking at what your word
[2:25:44] says now father I've did everything that
[2:25:48] I know possible
[2:25:50] to speak to your children that have
[2:25:52] needs to increase their
[2:25:56] faith not in a man but in our Lord Jesus
[2:26:03] Christ now
[2:26:05] father we ask you that you touch them
[2:26:08] tonight as ministers I ask you that you
[2:26:11] would anoint
[2:26:14] us we've laid aside time to
[2:26:17] pray because we know these services are
[2:26:20] specially incredibly
[2:26:23] important and all we ask Lord
[2:26:26] Jesus is to confirm your
[2:26:30] word Lord we have faith in you to
[2:26:33] believe your scripture says if you abide
[2:26:36] in me and my words abide in you ask what
[2:26:39] you will and it shall be done unto
[2:26:42] you now father we
[2:26:46] ask We Believe
[2:26:51] we believe it with all of our
[2:26:53] hearts many hands have been raised up
[2:26:56] because of the needs and their body
[2:26:59] needs in their homes prodal that they
[2:27:02] want to see come
[2:27:03] home now father we know there's not much
[2:27:06] time left to
[2:27:07] work but Lord we're going to see past
[2:27:10] this service and see well
[2:27:12] bodies see our s
[2:27:16] well

[2:27:59] to get long in a prayer
[2:28:03] line let me just share something with
[2:28:06] you on Thursday morning I I arrived in
[2:28:10] the cancer
[2:28:13] center I arrived there at 9:00 is it
[2:28:16] 9:00 sister Connie 10 10:00
[2:28:22] and I sat there 9 to
[2:28:24] 10: I got shots in my
[2:28:29] back big old needles
[2:28:32] and and then I went from that doctor and
[2:28:35] I set two more hours to see another
[2:28:39] doctor and then I was with him for about
[2:28:42] an
[2:28:45] hour then I sat at another place for
[2:28:48] about an hour
[2:28:51] so I'd say collectively I sat there
[2:28:52] about 4 hours in practicing Physicians
[2:28:57] they're practicing they're doing the
[2:28:58] best that they
[2:29:01] can but if this service would go three
[2:29:04] four
[2:29:12] hours and you could be totally healed in
[2:29:15] a
[2:29:16] second in a second would it be worth it

[2:29:25] way thou son of David have mercy on
[2:29:32] me from that day forward he didn't need
[2:29:34] a leading dog or lamb or somebody to
