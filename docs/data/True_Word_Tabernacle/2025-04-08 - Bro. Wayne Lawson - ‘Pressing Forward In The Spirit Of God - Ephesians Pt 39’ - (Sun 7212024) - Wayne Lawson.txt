and God bless you if you have your Bibles this morning we'd like to turn into the scripture amen uh we want to thank you for the song service and those songs amen appreciate them greatly in Ephesians chapter 6 I want to take uh a reading here if I can uh from the uh from the 17th verse Ephesians 6 and verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God we ask the Lord to bless his word you could be seated this morning amen we're wanting to uh speak to you a few minutes today on pressing forward in the spirit of God pressing forward in the spirit of God Amen uh I I thank the Lord amen for his grace Amen to be able to press forward and and to move forward I believe that it's I believe it's a special time to do so Amen in this in the age that we're living in amen I I wanted to I was hearing brother Ben talking in the back and he was just saying there how the Lord had touched him amen we we really don't know yet what happened to that uh to that but we're just going to believe it was prayer that changed the situation you know amen uh I I believe that amen uh we were uh we were discussing that with Brother Andy Thompson how that Legion it just it turns out to be infection amen and you know somebody said well maybe it was all the time I don't know but I'm going to thank the Lord and just believe it was prayer that made the change amen I I I I I I I want to I want to thank God for what he does and brother uh brother Ben said something there about thanking the lord for pain medication you know uh there's years ago people didn't have that stuff you know can you imagine getting a tooth pull with no P pain medication or no my surgeries and all of that thing but but but we thank the Lord for it and you know I I know uh some he said it was controversy in it I know it is sometimes uh the idea of medicines and things like that but you know uh but but real uh but real medical people are uh are different Amen in that they're uh very Christian medical people and we thank God for them amen we we thank the Lord when you're hurting or when you need help amen that God's got somebody there that's uh trained in those areas and amen God has done I God has done a tremendous thing here in this assembly he has said among us many uh many people that have studied Medical Science and went right in that way and amen and uh I know through some of the difficulties each of you uh God sure has anointed our sister Lily to help this assembly and amen and um you know uh she's just God God's gift here to us and amen she's been a blessing to many of you to our young people and amen and um and by the way brother Jeremy he ain't too bad either amen I thanked him one day for them being here and he said brother Wayne Lily does it he said he said I'll just push a button in the back but we certainly glad you pushed that button back there amen amen we certainly love this family and we love all these uh these medical people that God's put Among Us and I just wonder could we show them some appreciation this morning our doctors and nurses amen uh I appreciate these people I know brother Ashton I know he goes up through a lot to help people and and they're not just doing these things for jobs but they're calling on their lives and there's a lot of study and work and and goes into these things and we certainly appreciate all they do and amen it's it's such a blessing amen when you're going through things you appreciate God for the people that he puts around you amen and so I just was thinking this morning I was I was just dwelling on some of the things the Holy Spirit has done in the assembly and how that uh that you know you you see an assembly grow and then you see there's been things that we've come through as an assembly throughout the years and and uh now um I think it's marking close to 11 years we've been here this fall uh but you know there's there's things even that amount of time some of you've been here a lot longer and you've seen things come and you've seen things go um but you know there are things uh in your in your existence as a Christian uh that you have to be able to uh how could I say it you have to be able to divide the things that you should carry with you and the things that you should not uh I I found that we usually forget what we ought to remember and remember what we ought to forget I I I found that to be mostly true uh that uh that you know if we're not careful sometimes we carry things we should have left and and uh but I think that the Bible uh is strict here is in that if we're going to be uh if we're going to make it forward in a in a battle if we're going to move forward as a church as a people then there is a there's a a the Apostle Paul gives us a powerful writing and brother brandom said says when uh in greatest battle he's talking about how that he was talking about being soldiers and he said but yet sometimes it types in in running and so if you think about uh pressing forward in something that there is a there's going to be things when you move there's going to be things that you have to leave and then there's things that you have to take and you have to start Discerning the difference between the two you know if you're going to go on a trip and I know you sisters uh uh you got to just pack one bag there's a lot of decisions to make about that one bag you know uh you know what am I going to need and and how many pair of shoes and and what's the dress wear and what's we going to have dinner how many services are there there's there's decisions to make because you can't take everything you own on every trip you go on so there is times that we have to we have to make up our minds some things that have to go with us and some things uh they must stay and uh and and and in Philippians chapter 3 amen Paul says something very powerful in 12 verse down to the 16th and we'll read this and he said though as though I have already obtained uh we are already perfect he said but I follow after if that I may apprehend that from which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus now Brethren I I count not myself to have apprehended and I just love the humility of this apostle that he just says it out straight now I don't really think that I'm perfect he said but now I'm going to teach you something that I do he said I count not myself as apprehend ended but this one thing I do I'm forgetting the things which are behind and reaching forth unto things which are before now forgetting those things which are behind now uh some time ago I did a a big portion of a subject on things you know uh because things is pretty uh pretty General so uh I think it says it that we for you as an individual that you might be able to divide what things mean cuz things to me means one thing things to you May mean a different thing you remember on the road to EMAs when Jesus met them after the resurrection and they were saddened in heart and they had conversation and he said he said what's the matter they said have you not heard about things and he said what things uh so there were things that were happening in that season there's things that happen uh in the day we're living but one thing I do know that all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose so all things work amen but there are some of these things that happen that we must be able to uh uh to to leave behind as we reach forth under things which are before he said now see I press toward the Mark I like that word press just Thursday we spent some time on pressing the battle I press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of of God in Christ Jesus now let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded isn't that powerful he amen he he he says now this is the thing that I do and that any that are uh perfect now this has got to go into the Greek to understand this this is teos this is not noos or nepos you know that Greek Spanish that we speak uh it it's not that word is tellos which means of full maturity amen so in other words them that are of full maturity be thus minded that if anything you be otherwise minded that God shall reveal this even unto you now what's he saying nevertheless where we should already obtain let us walk by the same Rule and let us mind the same thing so Paul is saying that he had a great aim or a great purpose in life and I believe that's one of the great things that we've got to realize is we got to ask ourselves what is the real goal of our life what is the real goal as a person as a Christian what is the top goal of your life because some goals are going to have to have priority over others you know and you get goals and you say to yourself I'd like to do this well I tell you what you can't do you you can't lose weight and eat cake at the same time and you know mean you got to make a decision what's your goal I want this cake or I want this weight off you know and and you can tell sometimes the cake wins but but you got to make a decision on what your real goal is you see there are some things that if you're going to have this goal then it's going to cost you some things and and what Paul is saying that he had to forget some things to perform the goal that he had and he was saying if I could get everybody in this mind and he was saying look if if if you're not actually in this mind I pray God reveal this to you that that there is a power in this there's a single-minded in this this one thing that I do in other words he has a he has a purpose and his purpose is actually single-minded in Psalms 27 it was David the king Amen in the 20 in the verse he said one thing that I have desired of the Lord so single-mindedness is something the way a king thinks now now I I I mean we're Pastor Here Am me the church is is a nice siiz Church in the message but as far as people goes it's a it's a it's not a very big church as far as people go when you're thinking about a king over Israel amen that was a vast Kingdom and there were vast problems and there were every kind of level of situation coming to him on a daily basis and David this man over this whole political world Amen could say one thing have I desired of the Lord now think about a single-mindedness of that man that whatever else was happening his desire was not leaving that he would dwell in the house of the Lord and I believe this morning that Amen to to keep our goal to keep our perspective in mind is what keeps us pressing into the promises of God it's a single purpose and and I believe this is what is owed to the extraordinary Ministry of Paul and if you want to be an extraordinary Christian an extraordinary person that lives with happiness and joy amen and you have a great victory in your life then this is a rule you're going to have to live that some things go with you and some things stay behind you some things are not worth letting something control your life I say this often I cannot help what someone does to me I only can help how I respond to what someone does to me I can't I can't control everything and everybody I can't control that guy at the red light that won't get off of his phone and move but I can control how I respond to the guy at the are you hearing me here I I I can't I can't control amen amen how long the guy in front of me takes at the cast Regester but I can control how I react to that you you see if it's somebody got your seat this morning now you can't control that they said mostly you can't control that they sit there but you can control how you respond to the person that's set there you see because the control part when you start reacting to what is done then you start getting under the control of whatever is trying to control you amen other words if you got your buttons on the outside then there is people that can completely control your life but I say this this morning amen I I'm not going to let the devil control me by someone's bad attitude or by somebody's impatience or some situation I'm not going to give that kind of control of my life to another person amen do you see then then God gave unto me the ability of forgiveness and he gave to me the ability to set aside things that are troubling and problems amen can I I'll say this as my mama used to say it's a good saying amen she said holding a grudge against somebody he said it's like drinking poison and and wishing it killed them amen because it doesn't affect the other person it affects you as an individual amen now watch the amen here amen when you're looking at this he said now let us let us let us be able Amen to forget some things that we might be able to press on now I I don't believe Paul was speaking completely forgetting everything because uh because that was uh Ephesians chapter 2 remember he starts talking about memories remember these things and and the Bible talks about memorials that were built for remembrance so God does use your memory to to remind you of great victories of joy and what would put Worship in your heart and and what God has done to you good so those areas of your memory are are memories that you should memorialize and you should keep them places but there are other things that the devil are using to destroy and control and to manipulate your life and those areas are the on Amen that you take them out and you say well you can't ride with me no more I I'm going to go but I got no place in my bags I I'm going to travel on I'm going to move on from this place anybody ever feel like moving on you ever just get it in your mind I've been around this mountain long enough I'm ready to move on have you ever have you ever years ago now I'm not going to tell it amen but I'll say Amen they're going to have more memes if I do amen but I'll say this amen there are just times that you just got to move on you know you've been standing there long enough you've been dealing with this long enough so you want Tove move on well amen I believe this morning that it's moving on time they sang the song Moving on let's move on there's some situations that it's time to move on now I know sometimes you have to deal with it in your mind of how can I move on you know uh some may maybe you have been uh involved in a church or maybe sometimes most everybody in here has been to church and this one or that one or somewhere else or amen some people's been involved in things that were wrong they they they followed after maybe some kind of a te or they got under an influence or maybe they felt like they'd been too long in a certain spot and when they move on Amen the confusion is is how much of what I was in was good and how much of it was bad is that right amen now I I know from experience that there are places in my life amen that I was under a wrong influence I was under a wrong idea about scripture or I was something like that but you can't throw away your entire experience with God you get rid of the part that was wrong and know that God was dealing with you now the only way I know to explain this to you is life is life itself and you go to maybe a tree or you go to the best way to explain it brother Kyle is like with a corn you go to a corn plant and him and I were discussing this the other day you go to a corn plant and you look at a corn plant amen and right now the stocks are big the fields are full but come back in February there won't be nothing of that corn plant left but there's a seed somewhere amen now that seed could look back on that on that field and say well amen was I right was I wrong I I come through that field should I should is there something wrong with me because I was there or because some situation was there amen but see the moment that corn comes up out of the ground the life is right the life is right now maybe the situation where the life is ain't right and it's passing through a stage of corn amen but it's gone its way somewhere so the the life decides as it moves to the Shu amen as it moves to the stock what part stays and what part goes on but see when life moves it's constantly moving toward seed life so some of you sitting here this morning I I would say it probably goes with all of us that there has been places in your life that your that your life moves on your life moves on into Christianity it moves on into the message but the ideas you were told about that text didn't move on with you you or that that scripture that was twisted to you amen you started trying to grow and you found that that couldn't come with you that quote that was being misused on you you found out it couldn't come with you but the life was right the minute that you come to God and that seed in you begin to spring up but to to think because a seed has been in a shook of something wrong with the seed no that's the developmental pattern of a seed but amen after the shook begins to spit out the seed I know some of you get to feeling bad cuz you get amen some some people leave situations and the moment that you get out of the situation amen people turn on you people you think sometimes has been your friends your whole life and you come to a difference in scripture or you come to a difference and and maybe leadership something leads you to do something different or you go somewhere and that the individual just can't let you go they can't let you do what you feel led so all of a sudden you're you're you're uh well might as well say it you know all of a sudden amen because you leave a church all of a sudden you're going to go to hell well I think if you're a Christian you're a Christian if you're in this church or another way I don't think you got to go to True Word Tabernacle to go in the Rapture I don't think you have to be under our ministry Amen to be a part of the bride of Christ if you're a Christian the Bible said the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty liberty to follow God Liberty to believe God Liberty to love God now now but yet you come into them situations amen and then because you made a choice or a decision to follow the lord then pressure is put on you and he said well you must been wrong you must be wrong you must be wrong but there are places in your life that God calls you to a separation because it's time to move on it's time to move on and when you move on the devil don't want you to move on you can move on physically but he wants to keep a mind battle he wants to stay in your mind like people will get out of relationships but years later they're still emotionally involved in their mind they ain't seen them in years but they say there's an old flame burning you know there's an emotional connection even when there's not a physical connection but there are some things you just burn the bridge there are some things you got to leave behind you that you go on with God and I'm talking about something that whenever you gather yourself and say look amen I belong to the Lord I'm running a race of God I've got a purpose and mind amen then that motive is Hebrews chapter 12 the Bible said wherefore and we're comp passed about with a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and every sin which do so easily beset us and let us run let us run the patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus who is the author author and the finisher of our faith for the joy that was set before him there it is folks the joy that was set before him he couldn't have you and have his life he couldn't have you and have amen he couldn't have you and have a family he couldn't have you and have children and a home and a job and he couldn't live a normal life because he had a joy that was set before him some things had to stay and some things had to go I thank God he chose me and because he chose me I choose him I choose to serve him and there's areas of Our Lives where the Bible says it like this lay aside every weight and every sin that so do easily beset us I think we could sometimes maybe we could just come and have a laying aside service amen would y'all enjoy that a laying aside service laying aside laying aside situations laying aside discouragements laying aside problems laying aside arguments laying aside amen amen things that have happened in the past of Our Lives amen isn't it odd even young people suffer with these things amen just lay it aside amen there are times in your life you just got to let go you got to let go of all of it amen and go on with God hallelujah lay aside every weight and every sin that so dis easily beset you I I I don't mean to stay here and preach on this I don't have time but I I feel it amen I feel it in every sin that so easily beset you do you know what the devil's trying to do look he can't stop you you all you all understand there's a predestination on your life that I don't care how many Devils pile up against you he's never going to stop you so what he's trying to do is beset you he's trying to beset you to try to make your action Slumber he tries to make you tired and weary so you can't travel on Amen and if you're going to travel he wants you to travel nervous and discouraged he wants to be sure that you don't encourage a friend or a brother he wants to keep you beat down and helpless amen and barely travel along but brother I say that we ought to lay aside whatever sin it is that's besetting just lay the thing aside and say Satan I spent enough time with you on this I spent enough hours on this I am ready to move on with God I might have clear mind and understanding hallelujah hallelujah I believe it I believe a time for moving on we used to sing an old song I don't know if Ben sings it but amen we used to sing an old song when I was a kid down there in Arkansa I got on my traveling shoes I got on my traveling shoes anybody know that well I got on my traveling Sho he knows it well I got on my my traveling shoes he got them on he man you know how many heard Thursday night Heen amen I got up Friday morning with a beautiful meme with a with a caterpillar putting his shoes on said what are you doing he said I'm putting on my shoes I tell you what I put my shoes on this morning I thought that's right them's traveling shoes I got on right there them's traveling that what that's what'll carry me away from my problems that's what'll Carry Me Away from the weights of the world that's what'll carry you listen to me you got some shoes on Amen your feet has been shed by the preparation of the gospel and Paul said this is how you do it this is how you walk with God you got to forget some things and you got to walk on and you got shoes like if you're standing in a situation you don't like walk out of the room you got shoes on you can walk out of the room if somebody's Bing you out and they're just driving you down walk out of the room you're wearing shoes sir you see that you got your shoes on somebody said well I tell you what you got shoes on yep yep my traveling shoes and they're also my dancing shoes and sometimes you know you just need to dance y'all say what's wrong with that preacher I tell you what's wrong with him he put his shoes on and he walks out of situations and and sometimes you just need to dance you know the beauty of it is I you can't stop it from raining folks rain comes and Rain goes Storms Come and storms go it's how you deal with the storms you can cover your head up and think it's the end of the world but it ain't it's going to come and it's going to go so you say preacher what do you do I learned to dance in the rain I learned to ignore it I remember as a kid but Grace and him and the little kids back in Arkansas one day I walked out and she they're out there in the middle of rain I think we got video of it somewhere and they're out there in the rain they're just dancing and they're just enjoying it what is it because the rain was coming it wasn't something to it wasn't something to look bad at amen and we sometimes have to learn how to have joy in the midst of suffering we got to learn how to have joy in the middle of our trials I don't know about you but it's pressing on time it's time to press the battle it's time to take a step God Amen tell that devil I got my shoes on I won't stay another day in the Despair and depression that you try to put on my mind I can walk right out of here brother I'm walking with God I'm talking with God and when a man begins to walk and talk with God all kinds of things happen hey there was a woman in the Bible that believed Elijah amen and God raised her baby from the dead and years later they're telling the story story to the king amen and the King's wondering whether he could believe it or not amen and somebody looked over and said well here comes the here comes the boy the woman now here comes the woman now amen or was it the boy it was the woman wasn't it here comes the woman now walked right in the presence of the king while the story was being told of her Resurrection come on Sunday school teacher it was the it was the woman it was both here come the woman thank you amen here come the woman and the boy and they walked right in the presence of it and when they got right in there the king amen he took an officer of his court and said go with this woman and restore her everything that she lost during this famine you give her all of it back so when she went to walk in the land brother she wasn't walking by herself she went with an authority that when she said this belongs to me and this belongs to me and this belongs to me the king's court was there to give back to her whatever it was and listen I know you walk through the Bible this morning some of you walk through the message today don't you walk by yourself get with a get with a chief sheriff of God's court and let him let him as you say this belongs to me this belongs to me just start walking that out I don't know what kind of shoes you wore but mine's devil stomping shoes you ever wear devil stomping shoes you ever just have a devil stomping service you ever have one of them will you just come on young people you ever get a devil stomping service where you just feel like stomping on the head of the enemy he's been hissing all week long oh serpent just hissing and biting at your heels all we brother Aaron put your shoes on now I I'll tell you this it ain't good to stomp on a copper head with bare feet that's right but if you put your shoes on you got to ride see this doesn't mean that everything that's behind you is bad not everything that you've come through needs to be left behind you but life will make the choice if you can live for God with it if you can serve god with joy if it ushers you into the presence of God remember that but when it besets you when it destroys your confidence in God then that's when you begin to leave it behind do you know what Moses did it's scriptural now Exodus 14:15 the Lord said unto Moses why cry thou to me speak unto this children of Israel that they may go forward well I don't know if you read the scripture where this happens Moses is standing at the Red Sea now he's he amen he he this is not a simple matter he's dealing with he's standing at the Red Sea and he's got an army behind him he's got a sea in front of him and he goes to God with great care and concern for his people and he gets down and starts crying to the Lord Lord help us out of this and God says Don't Cry To Me Speak the word right and go forward have not I sent thee now in Exodus if you read back in Exodus 3 the Bible said that the pillar of fire appeared to him on Mount Horeb and that Pillar of Fire gave him a direct Revelation and said go down unto Egypt and I'm going to deliver the children of Israel by thee amen the Bible said I will go down he said but he was the one Moses is the one who went down amen and he called them people out of Egypt by the pillar of Fire but that's not the whole story there he said and I will deliver them into a land but you find out the scripture actually says that God told Moses go get him and come back on this mountain and worship me I think now now that's one thing okay okay you uh uh go get the people and meet me on the mountain and you can worship there on that mountain God didn't tell him there was a Red Sea in the way God did not tell tell him look Moses didn't Moses wasn't out in the wilderness just walking around by his own accord he was under a direct leadership of the pillar of fire and it led him right to the place he was so he couldn't argue with the leadership he could see the pillar of fire and and watch if God leads you to a place that seems like it cannot be done it cannot be passed it's a situation it's too high it's too wide it's too terrible there too much trouble but God LED you to that place then God has a way across that place for you and brother Ram actually said it he said Moses was led to that place so God could teach us that when there is no way God Will Make A Way and I say this morning he's still a way maker he's still the god that can make way where there is no way he's a God that can perform his word no matter what our thoughts of it is he cannot lie folks we've got to get it in our heart God cannot lie if God said we're going to that mountain brother we're going to the mountain it doesn't make a difference if there's a sea in the way if there's an Army in the way God will move the sea and he will drown the Army but we're going to go to the mountain that he said we're going to go to and if your mountain is healing this morning I say if there's a red sea between you and you're healing Mount up with Eagle's Wings and God will carry us or we'll walk through the trouble of it but we're going to this mountain we're going to take this mountain God didn't tell him he was going to run into that so when he ran into it he of course he said to God how we supposed to get across this he said don't cry to me you speak the word and go forward brother Bram said what word he said the word of God you speak it don't you cry you speak it and go forward now here's the thing the people the people got in a spirit of discouragement at that and y'all remember what they wanted to do they wanted to go back right so that part of their memory should have been left in Egypt right but they wanted to return to the garlic pots they wanted to go back to bondage prac to slavery see the difficulty because they were carrying that in their mind the difficulty brought out what they had in their mind but God wanted to show them that's never been for you it's not for you so he opened up and parted the Red Sea and I know you all know the story of the Red Sea so we're not really preaching on the Red Sea we're preaching on your Red Sea we're preaching about your situation we're talking about your Red Sea the place that you have come to and you know God said you're going to go to a certain place but there's something between you and that it's called opposition well let me ask you do you lay down and die on the bank or do you say God sent me to this so I'm more than able to conquer this and this Devil's got to get out of my way because God is here to do it and the fire that they have been following now went in behind them listen brother there's something that back this message up God went behind them and turned Darkness into Egypt and lied into Israel and opened the way and they went across on dry triod I've always loved that I've always loved it God said they stomped it enough they stomped enough mud you just take them through and they're not going to stomp any mud you just take them on through and they walked across on dry trod amen sister Robson I imagine amen a little while into the journey some of them weigh in the back you know amen they were they were they were following they were in the same journey together amen but they got to hear a noise and they couldn't figure out what the noise was was there was there Egyptians on the other bank was there destruction and War on the other bank amen but I imagine when somebody Whispers say hey but what's going on up there the word traveled no cell phones you know the word traveled up the line what's it happening and here comes the word back down the line well somebody broke through to the other side and those are sounds of Victory not sounds of War it sounds of someone has broke out on the other side and they're saying that there's peace on the other side the let me say this that that the Egypt is not on the other side Egypt died in that in that sea which tied the red blood of Jesus Amen and when they turned and looked I I can't preach for preaching I'm sorry amen but when they turned to look amen I thought it was powerful that God just took the wheels off their chariots and and and they and they were just stuck in the mud out in the middle of a sea and then God turns the water loose and drowns them and the Bible lets us know that when they got on the other side that they could look back and see that their enemy was dead now now they seen their enemy was dead that was the cause of the Great Victory on the battle or in the Realms of the Red Sea the great cause of it is we are on the other side of this but our enemy is dead brother you talk about dancing time we are on the other side of this and our Devil Is Dead the thing that has oppressed you died in the journey the thing that was behind you that haunted you that tried to destroy you it died behind you it died in the blood of Jesus Christ oh I tell you this morning I say death to every Spirit of Oppression every Spirit of anxiety and neurotics that's in this age amen put it in the blood of Jesus and let it die in your journey this morning I I just I can't help it I just got to preach folks when they got on the other side of that they picked up a tambourine and begin to play amen and I I know seems like that's controversial these days but but but but anyhow amen they picked up a tambourine and played and when they got to play in that tambourine amen the spirit of Victory got to coming down in that in that assembly amen I mean on that bank and when they got to playing amen the Bible tells us that all the women join Miriam I've done a study one time on demographics of males and females of two million people and I think they said it was much over 200,000 women would have been a part of that shouting meeting wow now I don't know I was in a meeting in Africa with about 5,000 there in the Ivory Coast and the biggest one ever was about 25,000 there in Zimbabwe and it was loud brother I mean it was roaring loud it was shaking the stadium the soccer stadium just shook amen under the rejoicing but 200,000 200,000 sisters amen that didn't have to make another brick 200,000 women I don't know if you understand what they were out of 200,000 women amen that had their babies fed to alligators and had Egyptian soldiers knocking their babies in their head so they couldn't even have their children they couldn't raise their son amen Egypt was taking every bit of their offspring but now they had put on their shoes and they had come out of Egypt and they had crossed the river and they had went to a place where Egypt can't bother our children anymore hallelujah hallelujah to God think about it this morning there a place there's a place I know Egypt would like to get every newborn child every new birth every child coming forth out of the Church he'd like to tackle them and take them down listen we're in a place this morning where Satan cannot touch them we have come to The Place Beyond The Riven Veil where the power of God drops in upon the church brother they got to shouting and rejoicing hallelujah what a what a beautiful thing well I know there's a lot of discussion about these things about these holy ghost meetings and things brother Bram said but we can't have a healing service till we get the people in the spirit of healing and we cannot have a holy ghost have a feeling of the Holy Ghost until people gets in that kind of atmosphere people was in atmosphere in the day that brings judgment on this Earth we can't have judgment on this America till they get in the spirit of judgment you can't have a holy ghost meeting till you get in the spirit of the Holy Ghost meeting yeah yeah it's a it's a pretty powerful thing I know sometimes that atmosphere scares things but mostly what it scares is the devil cuz that's the kind of atmosphere Devils die in that's kind of atmosphere where births happen in do you see what it is you can't have it till you get in the spirit of it my God I want to get in the spirit of it do you see in the power of decision brother brandham says it he said one time an old prophet got all stared up because somebody come to see him you remember back in the scripture when Jehoshaphat came and got Elisha because he had poured water on the hands of Elijah and the the Army got in real trouble and they had got dry and the Bible said they've been seven days out in the desert and it took to a real dryness there and they didn't have any water so they went and got Elisha and they brought him out there Elisha was in a bad mood about it he didn't want to answer no questions he didn't want to answer no questions of why things were the way they were you so he he was in a bad mood about it brother Braham had some things say about where Elisha was he said he wouldn't even look at them had they not been the presence of Jehoshaphat now look what they did to change him he said they brought him a Minstrel 2 Kings 3 if you'd like to read it and they brought him a Minstrel and it came to pass that that when the menstral played the hand of the Lord came upon him now watch some people don't like music and worship yeah true but it changed the attitude of a prophet you don't think it won't change your attitude sure it will it'll change the way you feel sitting even in a service under the worship and the spirit moving it'll change the way you feel now Watch What Happens that music comes and bring a minstral and when they begin to play the hand of the Lord come upon him and he said thus saith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches and brother B draws from that he says watch now he said it was a supernatural he said where man's senses are limited but a man in his spirit is unlimited now the tree of knowledge can take a man so far and then knowledge breaks back but the Tree of Life Goes On see how science has taken man farther with five senses than we have with his soul now watch this we'll have got untapped resources all things are possible now don't let this fall simply on your heart when he got in the spirit he saw the possibility of water in a dry place isn't that amazing that the desert didn't change none of the armies were any different that was nothing different but they got to play in some music and the prophet drifted in the spirit and he looked at the same dry place and saw water but in the spirit you see things that are not there yet when a man gets in the spirit he looks at things differently amen I know sometimes we seem like Fanatics when we start saying a thing a certain way and you're thinking my goodness it ain't that way at all but if you get in the spirit it changes when you get in the spirit things look different watch amen uh the tree of knowledge can change your mind on things they can they can they can take you up that tree and make you look different at atoms they can make you look different at genetics they can make you look different at physical things and sicknesses and that kind you can get on their tree and they can change your view of things but there's a tree of of life and the spirit from that tree of life has come and it can pack you up it can pick you up and pack you into places where you believe things are possible that you can't see you can't taste them you can't feel them you can't hear them they're not even there but you can move forward into them what is it amen there's a place of untapped resources when you get into the spirit of it now the Bible says in Revelation chap 4 amen that when John was standing in the age of leoda and he was describing a very horrible scene he was describing but the Bible says after this I looked and behold a door was opened up in heaven and the voice which I heard was a trumpet talking we said come up hither John isn't that something amen that God wanted to change the direction and the view of this man of God but he had to call him up to do it and the Bible said and immediately I was in the spirit and I beheld the throne that was in heaven amen he went from looking at leosia to looking to the throne of God when a man gets in the spirit you go to from seeing the carnal natural things that are around you and you start seeing the Throne of God immediately I was in the spirit come up here and I will show you things in the future you want to talk about memory amen isn't it odd how we remember things but you know what we ought to be able to remember the past but we ought to be able to remember the future I don't have time preach on it all this morning but I want to just lay it out there to you a little bit amen do you ever think about remembering the future amen you you say well I remember the past and you remembered as if if you were there and and it went on so far here while back I preached on word memory anybody remember that trading the finite for the infinite the word memory uh let me put it like this your mom told you what day you were born told you what the hospital was like she told you they took you home in a certain C and after a little while that becomes your memory because you receive your Mom's memory as your memory well the word of God is God's memory and it restores your memory to who you are if you listen to brother Ram a lot of times when he starts talking about amen the past life the the the seed he'll say now remember yeah he'll start by saying now remember before you were here you had to be somewhere else I don't remember brother brandom let me remind you you were in the mind of God you were an attribute of God when job said to Job where were the sons of God when you were sh let me remind you that that's where you were you see now there's the thing about it right Adam forgot didn't Adam forget isn't that really what happened Adam forgot how to create and Adam forgot how to speak the word and Adam forgot how to recreate himself in that spiritual world Amen but here we are in the last day and we're going to be reminded of the thing that Adam forgot but we're not just reminded of the past we are reminded of the future God God's word has just as good in the future as it is in the past it's just as much memory of what was and what is brother Ram stands and talks to a woman said now I'll just say this you're going to be healed he said well then you have a right to doubt that because you don't know what your future holds but he says but if you know what it's being you know whether it's true or not and that's right Jesus Christ brother R said this so if he knows what has been certainly he would know if he could tell you what was you would have confidence to know what he says will be correct because it would be good see it would be God would you believe it would you Jesus would believe it see now what is it amen there is a memory of past and there's a memory of future I was just reading this yesterday and I was just reminding the devil of his future did you ever remind people of what's coming you ever just remind them this is coming well this is coming and I was reading how the four seal brother Bram says it like this he said listen goats didn't cover it but did not remit it until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces to send it back upon the original perverter that was Satan when it got back to Satan he waits until the time of Eternal Annihilation somebody help me say it Annihilation Anil Eternal Annihilation now that shows What We believe We believe that he will be absolutely completely done away away and annihilated I'm just reminding Satan here I just want Satan to be reminded watch this in that day on Calvary I believe a man that has eternal life can never die and I believe there is a complete annihilation of a soul that sins for the Bible said the soul that sins shall surely die not the man the soul that sinth so Satan must surely die to be compl completely destroyed how I disagree with the Universalist that say Satan will be saved he sinned and he's the originator of sin his soul sinned and he was a spirit and that Spirit shall be totally annihilated nothing will be left of it in questions and answers in 59 brother B said remember I love the way he starts that remember Devils never die Devils always live but there will be a time where Devils have to die because they become totally annihilated what is he talking about he meant that when you get in the spirit you can see it don't cry speak the word and go forward what is it it takes the spirit of God to give you Vision do you see John says here I was in the spirit on the Lord's day isn't that beautiful I love that the whole Christian Life if we're going to ever live as Christians we have to be his sons it had to be his Spirit now John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would have not brought Visions it had to be the spirit of God it has to be the spirit of God with us too all of our efforts are in vain now he says Paul said I pray in the spirit I sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest in the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit amen the spirit that John got in that saw those Revelations Are The Same Spirit that you're invited into in the church look what he says see now in Acts 2 the Bible said repent everyone and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and be Duty bound God would be to fulfill the fill filling them with the Holy Ghost now they never get in the spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for Revelation by the spirit see that is the first step get in the spirit now if you put on your traveling shoes and you're trying to get out of something amen what is the first step get in the spirit your first step is get in the spirit so the Revelation can come to you of what God has in mind brother bandam says it like this he said it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over how many ever had that happen to you you have that happen where you're praying about something amen and all of a sudden it comes into your spirit that is finished brother it's just as done it's just as done as if you hey you I'll tell you right then you could just rejoice and praise God because it's just as done as anything is done now because you got it in the spirit now when you get it in the spirit it's all over there is no other court of appeal watch he says we need to get in the spirit and then things get done don't go through the ACT first get in the spirit and then go through the act and watch what God will do have you ever noticed how the world gets in the spirit things of the world they go to ball games and sporting events and dances and they enter into the spirit of it now brother Bram said they don't just set like wallf fires old dried up sticks they enter right into the FI of things and become a part of things now let me tell you what would the devil would like to do he' just like to keep you in a place where you just well I you know what I'll go but I won't get in that's what he would like you know what I mean I mean he'd like you set through a whole service and never just open up and say that's right amen he he he don't want you to get into it he don't want you to feel the spirit of it because see if you're going to go somewhere your first step is getting in the spirit of it intellectually it's not going to change you but as you step in the spirit you will catch it and they enter the spirit they don't set like wallf fires or all dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things and become a part of things oh how they hate the Christians for getting in the spirit of God's word they'll call us Fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show hatred and disapproval but ignore it ignore it ignore it you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on worshiping in the spirit just go on in the spirit of worship just go on and get in the spirit of worship you know what I mean when you just don't care no more and you get in the spirit he got in the spirit brother BR said before anything took place he got in the spirit and before anything can take place it was in the spirit and if you'll notice in your Bible it was the Holy Spirit it was the holy spirit because there's a lot of spirits right isn't it isn't it true there's a lot of spirits now now brother random talks about it from The Invasion uned States and he tells us that the devil landed in Hollywood and is invading the United States of America I me I've got tons of quotes he said it's invaded the United States with demon powers Satan left France and came to our borders landed in Hollywood amen and has filled America with demon powers those demons are spirits that's why women cut their hair you you L do your history lessons that's when women started wearing pants that's when homosexuality got its beginning that's when all of these great changes begin to hit America was when Hollywood begin to evangelize America used to be you had to go somewhere to get into these things but all of the sudden it got to be in a 24-hour sermon in people's homes and and demons begin to come in demon powers begin to come in why because you got to get in the spirit before you can do it you got to get in the spirit of adultery before you can commit it you got to get in the spirit of forn ation before you commit it you got to get in the spirit of drinking before you can get drunk come on Church well if that be true in the negative what about the positive if you're going to have a Rapture you got to get in the spirit of rapture if you're going to be worshiped you got to get in the spirit of worship I believe it amen I believe that Hollywood invaded America with a vision amen from a television but I believe God invaded America by the message of the hour and gave a vision to the Church a vision of body change a vision of rapture brother that's the spirit I want to get into the spirit that makes me lift up my head oh my you see what it is Satan sets these powers and it's an invasion brother Bram said it's an invasion of unclean spirits where people are driving them right in it's an invasion of the United States of America I I I'll read this part perfect strength perfect witness brother Bram said the lids come off of hell right well that's true ain't it the lid has come off of hell and streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere now these demon powers this Invasion brother brandom calls them enticing Spirits now an enticing spirit is something that tries to lead you out of the word of God it's enticing uh brother Bram when ever he tries to deal with enticing Spirits he always brings up the story of how that Micah with stood 400 prophets when there was a great battle of Ahab at hand have remember that and and there was there was a great battle and Ahab was wondered whether or not to re to to reclaim rth Gilead which was a part of their promise but there was a curse on Ahab and God had already by Elijah said he was going to die and and but they wanted to invade this land and so they wanted a spiritual instruction so they went to 400 prophets and all of them says yes you you go right up and then Jehoshaphat you know he had he had there was two men there right brother B was showing us by that story there's two of you there's an outward man inner man and he said the outward man can hear all the voices but the inner man still says I want to hear another is there one more because the inner man's not satisfied with the voice of enticement so the inner man is saying there's got to be a true one somewhere and they said well there is one more but but but he hates us he hates us and so then they brought so then they brought Micah in and then Micah un uncovers the whole thing right he says well what's going on here is up in heaven there's a meeting of how to fulfill Elijah's prophecies on the earth about Ahab and the Bible says a Spirit came up into the Throne of God and said let me go down and be a lion spirit in the the mouth of those prophets and God said go ahead and go and brother Braham said The Spirit Well the Bible says it he says go and you will prevail now brother B said the reason that that Spirit would Prevail in those prophets is because they wasn't on the word he said so what difference does it make what they said because they wasn't on the word anyhow so all so they had an open door to just prophesy whatever came to them and they prophesied a lot and told Ahab yeah go into the battle you just go right on into the battle and M and Micah standing there and he's saiding you going to go on the battle but you ain't coming home that's right see because the spirit of Truth was there the same as this lion Spirit was there now uh uh I know some of you do a lot of studying in the message and I'll give you this from the foreal brother brandom says when this Pale Horse comes he said there's three different powers there's a political power there's a spiritual power yeah and there's a religious power three powers okay that make up that Pale Horse those three powers are spiritual power religious power and Demon power or civil see we got civil we got demon we got religious if you take this story of Micah and Ahab you have a king Ahab which is the Civil power the political and the demon is resting in political you you have a lion Spirit which is demonology and he's coming to get into that political power The Same Spirit is also in them false prophets which is the religious power so religion politics and Demon power came together to lead them to the battle of Armageddon brother BR said this is the Pale Horse this is riding now watch what he saying we've got to get in the spirit first we got to get in the spirit of if we're going to have an Armageddon there's got to be a spirit for Armageddon where is that Spirit coming from God didn't lead us to this Armageddon man is going into this Armageddon and they're following enticing Spirits now the Bible calls them unclean spirits from Revelations the 16th chapter the three frogs they're three frogs of unclean spirits and the Bible said they're always looking back now watch the principle we started with with amen if you're going to move forward amen you've got to forget the things behind you when the Pentecostal world begin to receive the message of the hour they couldn't get in the spirit of Revelation they couldn't get in the spirit of Eagle anointing they couldn't get in the spirit so all they had was their memory of what the word was so the minute the trinitarian doctrine begin to be attacked by a prophet with a with a stick and he begin to push him back by the sword when the word begin to come against the trinitarian doctrine they all went to the fathers of NAA and they started looking back they started looking back to what so and so said what so and so said but they should have went back to the word they should have went back to the word I hope you're hearing me this morning amen forgetting the things that are behind you when you hear the message and it starts giving you something say I don't understand that that way I wasn't taught that that way listen don't go back to what you were taught go back to what the message says because there's places in your life where someone has taught you something they have said something for their own control of [Music] you now what is it any spirit that speaks contrary to this word's a lie what was it it was a trinity of frogs that was looking back that's why Paul said this one thing that I do this man just come out of being a Hebrew of Hebrews he' just come out of laws he'd just come out of systems and organizations and Paul was saying I cannot carry over what I was into what God is making me he had to find a place of Separation in his mind he how how could this man separate the walk he had from the walk amen that he experienced from behind him because he knew God was in his law but the great Pillar of Fire came down and the pillar of fire could separate the old from the new amen what is it the pillar of fire was the one he had to get in the spirit and the spirit done the separating of what he could keep and what he had to throw away I'll tell you this morning you get in the spirit of the spirit of Truth and it begins to discern it begins to pull together now I know there's a lot of voices and and there's an invasion of spirits there is an invasion of spirits upon the Earth and I love how brother brandom says this and we can identify something very quickly there are prophets and there are false prophets right there are both right now but brother random identify something the first key that we have received the Lord comes another slightly less wonderful truth the TR of the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts but we have discovered that the word teaches us an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of Truth in the last day when the Lord is about to appear the question now arises in our minds does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception oh no no account for the scripture says very clearly that the elect cannot be deceived for there shall arise false cross and false prophets and they will show signs and wonders in so much yeah that if it were possible if it was at all possible it would deceive the very L and because it didn't deceive you because that spirit that spoke to you didn't deceive you now you're wondering if You' done something wrong well we might as well preach the seed didn't get kicked out of the shut till it got perfect Jesus didn't get crucified till it got perfect do you see there's other reasons for persecution besides do you see what happens brother bam tells us this that the spirit that comes upon the church in the last days the spirit is not the spirit of fear let me say this very clearly God did not send the spirit of fear to this church God did not spend send the spirit of fear to your life amen the prophet is clear now let's say this very clearly there's two elements that control your life and this morning either fear or faith is controlling you fear or faith is causing you to do what you do and brother brandom says it like this now false prophets come right brother brandom said it like this now just as we have showed the Antichrist is and a word so are false prophets coming to pervert the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how people who lead others astray bind themselves closely to themselves by fear brother they say that if people don't do what they say or they leave destruction is going to follow oh my goodness see God never sent fear to lead you God never sent fear to bind you God sent Faith to deliver you God sent Faith to lead you amen When Faith Comes Into the Heart fear has to leave the heart one of them is fear the other is Faith and fear of Faith controls every denomination every individual everything is controlled by fear or by faith and somebody said well fear ain't that bad brother Bram says the worst thing can be put on you it's the worst thing that can be put on you now I'm going to say what a prophet said here he said it's the greatest of curses fear is the greatest of curses that's in the church today because people are afraid to lay hold of the word of God Amen somebody says well it's like this and you know the word says different but you won't take the word because you got fear on you come on church God didn't birth a bunch of sons and daughters to car into the fear of man he birth Sons and Daughters of God to rise up in this age take the sword of the spirit of God and say get out of my way devil I'm going to the resurrection I'm going to the Rapture hey amen yes sir amen I I tell you what it is amen it's the greatest curse there is I know the devil hates this kind of preaching amen but I tell you what I am so sick of that devil of fear has tried to bind people and keep people listen don't you fear this church or this man or this pull pit amen if something's in your heart you want to do something different you got Liberty go where you want do what you want if God sent you here amen then tell the devil get out of my way I'm going to enjoy amen what God has put me in in this age that I'm living in I tell you what we need to do is get in the spirit of Liberty and the spirit of faith and tell that [Applause] devil but I'm going to tell you what a prophet calls it he calls it a curse and then he says it's the greatest plague that there is in the Christian church today he said the problem is we're afraid to get out of the cage there ain't nothing wrong with you it's a cage the devil's got you in that Canary can fly fine the food it's eating is fine but there's a cage called fear that has brought a cage around you and you can't get to the limits that God anointed you to get to you can't rise to the place that God C you to rise to but I say this morning you ought to tell fear I'm walking on and leaving you today I'm going to walk right out of a place that you cannot come a place you cannot go listen there is places a Believer can go the devil can't go with them I believe there's Heights that you can climb into there's no devil can rise up with you you're brother B said but you're afraid to get out of the cage but let me say this very clearly God didn't give you that Spirit God didn't give you that spirit that is not the spirit of God brother random said the Bible Paul said it like this we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear come on there they were in the Red Sea was in worse bondage than they were when they were in Egypt because this time there was no egyptian beating them it was their own minds it was their own fear that had gried them to keep them from pressing forward but I say this morning amen that there is an escape to every fear there is a way out of the fear of your mind the cage I say let it swing wide open this morning and step right out of it put on your traveling shoes he glory be to God Amen amen how many of you ever read how many how many of y'all ever read a Pilgrim's Progress me see your hand like if you read it or very aware of it if you hadn't it's a it can be a slow read but I think they have it in audio books and maybe layman terms Now new and old king English is pretty rough at times it's just a story of a pilgrim and they call his name Christian and traveling made of Hope and and they're going to a Celestial City and they're escaping sudden destruction behind them and they're on the journey and then the journey gets hard and in one of the scenes they come up to this place it's just the way is hard and they look over and there's an easier way and Christian says hey let's go over here and take this way I think it was hopeit was with him and he says but that's out of the way says yeah but look man there's no rough plot and there's no it's just Green Pastures it's just nice let's just and so they jump the fence they take out through the field well ain't long it just starts getting dark lightning starts flashing thundering and lightning it's Wednesday in your case it's Thursday because in the story he's there from Wednesday to Saturday night right the dates are important Wednesday to Saturday night that's between the service so it's Thursday night I'll take this way it's easier so they get over there and they lay down and they go to sleep and this is where this is where the king despair finds them in his realm see a Christian has no business in the realm of Despair it's out of the way that's right and the king of despair found them trespassing on his property and he took them down to doubtful castle that's the name of it isn't it doubtful huh doubting doubting yeah not doubtful doubting doubting Castle so he has a house stronghold his wife's name is diffidence meaning like low self-confidence so Despair and no confidence takes them to a castle puts them in there and they beat them they beat them till they can't move and then dissidence and despair discuss what they'll do with them tomorrow and they go in and beat him again they beat him again then short story they beat him again and then they they beat them where they can't even get off the ground and then they tell them they give them some supplies and put some Weaponry around them if you don't want another beaten just take your life yeah wow wow so they show up the next morning and despair see they're still living so despair looks over at him says why didn't you do it I gave you everything you needed why didn't you take your own life I'm going to have to beat you again so they set in and beat him again he comes back the next morning there they are they're still living he beats them again why didn't you take your life so after a little while hope says something to Christian and he says have you noticed that all of this Weaponry is here but for some reason they're not killing us oh it can't kill me the giant of Despair can't kill me he can only convince me to take my own life so despair has no power over me and this doubting Castle is not a hold for me but it begin to revive hope and Hope begin to rise up and say we got to find a way out we got to find a way out there's got to be a key somewhere got to be a key got to be a way out you know what he found he remembered some things you need to remember he remembered if I'm going to go forward there is something in my memory I was given a key early in this journey and through this despair I had forgotten in his bosom he wore a key that was told him it would unlock every every every every door that was in this land and he took that key of Promise out of his bosom and just begin to open the door and they begin to break out listen and the king of Despair and his his wife a Defence they could only follow them so far because they had on their traveling shoes they just kept walking and kept walking and kept walking until they walked out of the realm of Despair listen there ain't nobody can keep you from moving this morning you're not blocked up in a place you can't get out of there's a key in your bosom it's a key of promise and that promise said with every Temptation there is a way of escaped take your key this morning morning open the door of despondency and despair and take off walking heyen I know what it's going to say it's going to say come on back here I ain't going back brother I ain't going back to despondency I'm not returning to discouragement hey man I believe it this morning I believe you can walk right out of here come musicians come today I believe you can walk right out of here I believe you can walk amen I ain't got I ain't got time amen I preach to along on the front I believe you can walk right out of here today I believe you can take that key of Promise out of your bosom right now and unlock a door and walk right out of the king's [Music] castles brother Josh he he was sharing some medical advice with me the other day we were discussing some of his some of his Battles Through The Years and he he told me he said Dr Lily shared something beautiful with him he okay for me to share it said B said something beautiful he'd had a panic attack she said you notice it can't kill you there's actually not a record of anybody dying from a panic attack but you think you're going to it works on your mind listen the devil would like to keep your mind even when he can't keep you you've left it then leave it you've moved on move on so brother way you don't know what kind of situation I was in and and I've done this and I had this and I did this you have ever right to stand on the Promises of God brother Levi when a man confesses sin yes puts it under the blood he has every right to stand on that promise just as though he never did it in the first place Hallelujah no matter no matter you say you see someone standing in a certain spot on the stage and you go I don't know if I got a right to stand with them if you've confessed your blood your sins under the of the blood you got the same right to the presence of God that any person in here does I believe this morning I believe I believe that we we we have to discern by the spirit that there are some things we need to leave behind when the spirit comes the spirit of God it separated for Paul the old and the New Testament let the spirit of God separate for you in your own life some of the things that we're confused about you know should I carry this with me or should this experience and what but there there there are things that you can't I I've often said it like this there are things you can't go on with and those are the things you got to deal with with I remember years ago I went and uh I went and had some welding done brother Brian there was old boy that lived back out in the Hills there in Arkansas and had driveway back out there and I had to get some welding done on this boat I started doing this welding yeah man it's an niest old boy he's a good old boy he's a little bit older probably would have been my dad's dad's age close Grandpa age but it's a nicest guy I get back home and I'm telling my dad about finding this welder and telling his name name and all this and dad says you know what son he said that guy was a Mason with your grandpa and he said he done him wrong on a car deal and Masons ain't supposed to do masons wrong on car deals I said man you got to be kidding me I was about 20 or something like that I just I was young I just turned a Christian actually you know what I didn't even go back out there that God done my grandpa my Grandpa died when I was three I never even knew my grandpa but he done my grandpa wrong so couple months Rock throng one day I went down to Dad's and we just sitting there discussing something come up about my boat and getting that welding done he said something what' you say that boy's name was I told him he said no that's not the guy that did that to your grandpa I've been mad at this guy for a month he didn't even know I'd been mad at him I didn't tell him I just let it go there are things that you approach as a Believer now I'm I'm saying that lightly but there's things you approach as a believer that you've went through in your life's course some of that's good for your experience some of that's good for where you're going but some of that is impeding the part that's impeding Paul said just lay it aside just lay it aside do you love him this morning could you stand your feet with us just lay it aside I like that I got about three more spirits to work through there and I didn't get to them it's bothered me real bad you can study them the spirit of Revival the spirit of the Bride it's a bride Spirit bride people it's the Lord himself do you love him this morning amen Amen brother Brian you got something you unravel me with a mellow you surround me with a song of deliverance from my [Music] enemies till all my fears are godone I'm no longer [Applause] for I I am a child of God I'm no [Music] [Applause] longer oh I am a child of God [Music]
