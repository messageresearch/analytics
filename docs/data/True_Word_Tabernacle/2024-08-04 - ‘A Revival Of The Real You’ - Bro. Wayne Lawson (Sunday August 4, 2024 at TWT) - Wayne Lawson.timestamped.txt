[12:13] we're going to uh ask the Lord and just
[12:16] if we bow our hearts
[12:18] together amen we'll come together for
[12:20] just a moment here in prayer amen I'm
[12:25] I'm trying to gather myself so I can

[12:28] any breath the anointing appear and amen
[12:31] so let's just pray father we ask you for
[12:34] your mercy Lord that your strength would
[12:37] just come here Lord upon every heart and
[12:40] every Life as we feel that great
[12:42] sweeping presence of you as you move
[12:44] through the building Lord the Mortal
[12:47] body almost don't know what to do but
[12:50] Lord one of these mornings you're going
[12:52] to give us a new body where we can sit
[12:55] around your throne Lord and fellowship
[12:57] under the atmosphere throughout eternity
[13:00] father now this morning as we come
[13:03] together to to look into your word I
[13:05] pray Lord that you would Quicken our
[13:07] minds you would Quicken our
[13:09] understandings Lord that you would give
[13:12] us mercy and peace in our heart and I
[13:15] just ask you now that you would take
[13:16] this word that you would speak to the
[13:18] need of your people we ask it in Jesus
[13:21] name amen amen and amen if you have your
[13:25] Bibles I'd like to go into the scripture
[13:27] in the book of Ephesians the sixth
[13:29] chapter and I'm going to read here uh
[13:32] from the 6th verse and the 17th verse
[13:36] sixth verse and S uh 6 and
[13:39] 17 I'm just going to read the one
[13:41] scripture and let you be
[13:43] seated and take the helmet of
[13:47] salvation and the sword of the
[13:51] spirit which is the word of God you may
[13:56] be seated this morning I want to uh
[13:59] speak from here again if you were with
[14:01] us Thursday night uh we took from here
[14:04] from the Ephesians 6 for the dividing of
[14:07] the soul and the spirit and we were
[14:10] looking uh at this uh from this area
[14:13] because the word of God of course the
[14:15] word is the sword of the spirit and of
[14:18] course Hebrews the 4:12 uh Hebrews 4:12
[14:21] said that it is a deser between the
[14:24] thought and the intent and between the
[14:27] spirit and the soul which teaches us
[14:30] that there then is a difference between
[14:32] the spirit and the soul and then if you
[14:35] can begin to understand the difference
[14:37] between the two it takes you into
[14:39] another level of Faith or another realm
[14:42] of faith and brings you into this now I
[14:44] I would like to take this for a context
[14:47] thought if I would just for a title I
[14:49] want to speak to you on a Revival of the
[14:52] real you a Revival of the real you now
[14:56] brother Brandon was saying things that
[14:58] are to be that this old Tabernacle here
[15:01] this body is like an old coat that you
[15:03] wear that you once wear now but
[15:07] inside of there it see you are inside
[15:13] there so it's like a wearing a coat but
[15:15] the coat ain't you you're on the inside
[15:17] there so this human body is like a coat
[15:20] that you wear and he said see it's not
[15:23] you you are on the inside of that body
[15:27] you the spirit
[15:29] of God is on the inside of that body did
[15:32] you hear how he identified you you the
[15:35] spirit of God are on the inside of that
[15:39] body see your body see your real self is
[15:43] on the inside of this old coat that you
[15:46] call like William brandom or Susie Jones
[15:48] or whoever it is see it's on the inside
[15:52] of that now now the people they've seen
[15:55] you but all they've seen is this and
[15:58] what what what you was your real you is
[16:01] on the inside of that amen but the old
[16:04] Cod itself is just bore the image so the
[16:07] real you is on the inside of that so
[16:10] here here's from the message of the
[16:11] Inside Man 1953 if you haven't heard it
[16:14] you'd love to hear it amen the Inside
[16:16] Man and brother B said do you ever think
[16:18] inside of your body is another man
[16:20] there's another man inside the body it's
[16:23] the spirit man amen now uh just a couple
[16:26] of these quotes you heard Thursday and
[16:28] the prophet of God God will say see the
[16:30] the scientific part of a man the see The
[16:33] Taste the feel the smell the hear is
[16:35] only to contct this Earthly home but
[16:39] it's the Inside Man which is the spirit
[16:42] that contacts God Amen that's the part
[16:45] that contacts God now this is the Inside
[16:49] Man see if that Inside Man is of God it
[16:53] is the spirit of God if the Inside Man
[16:57] is of god it's the spirit of God that's
[17:00] inside the man amen here it is brother
[17:03] Ram tells us this he tells us about
[17:05] Apostle Paul when he was in the
[17:07] Shipwreck and he was warming his fire
[17:10] hands over the fire and the serpent
[17:11] reached out and bit him now that bit the
[17:13] man the serpent bit the man it built the
[17:16] outside man but brother Ram said but
[17:19] inside of him every little cell of blood
[17:22] is aive and there you all he said they
[17:24] were charged full of the Holy Ghost
[17:27] certainly amen that's how they walked on
[17:30] water that's how they done great
[17:31] Miracles because they were perfectly in
[17:33] harmony with God see the very holy
[17:36] spirit that made the heavens and the
[17:38] Earth had so charged this man with power
[17:42] he says till death amen the thing of the
[17:45] serpent wouldn't even go into his body
[17:48] because he was full of the spirit the
[17:50] same as he was full of blood that that
[17:52] is a refrigerator quote he was as full
[17:55] of spirit as he was full of blood amen
[17:58] and every every part of him was charged
[18:01] with that Holy Ghost and brother B tells
[18:03] us the secret that he was ordained to be
[18:06] somewhere so the serpent couldn't kill
[18:08] him because Paul was supposed to go
[18:10] somewhere so God had a purpose for his
[18:12] life and God has a purpose for your life
[18:15] how many knows things are to be what
[18:17] brother ramam said your purpose is he
[18:19] says your purpose is your duty is to
[18:22] express God to this nation that you're
[18:24] supposed to express the gene of God to
[18:27] this nation that is your purpose now of
[18:30] course that this man now is going to
[18:32] feed on psychology and he he will feed
[18:35] on something intellectual but the inside
[18:38] man he feeds on the word of God he feeds
[18:42] on the word of God Amen and that's where
[18:45] the real Great fight is tonight amen or
[18:48] this morning for us is is that man of
[18:51] course amen God took his heart but the
[18:54] devil took his mind and he looks at
[18:57] things with his eye through is human
[18:59] things but the heart is on the inside
[19:02] and God gave eyes to that heart that
[19:05] they might be able to see now we're
[19:06] living in a blind age we're living in a
[19:08] blind leosia amen but God on the inside
[19:12] of a Believer there's a door in your
[19:14] heart called the door of sight and when
[19:17] God gets in that door he opens the door
[19:19] of sight that you might be able to see
[19:22] amen so that's exactly why the Bible
[19:25] says that you should pray that you're
[19:27] that you have the anointing in of your
[19:29] eyes that you might be able to see that
[19:32] it takes anointing to see amen because
[19:34] it's the inside now when the Holy Spirit
[19:37] begins to fall it falls on All Flesh
[19:40] according to Joel chapter 2 that God
[19:42] would pour out his Spirit on All Flesh
[19:44] but not all flesh is saved but the
[19:47] spirit pours out on All Flesh and some
[19:49] people get the rain and they get it
[19:51] right on their flesh and that's as deep
[19:53] as it goes and some people go a little
[19:55] deeper even into gifts and things and it
[19:58] falls into their Spirit which is the
[20:00] second realm but there's a Third Realm
[20:02] of man called The Soul amen and if the
[20:06] spirit ever gets down in that Soul
[20:09] that's where the real germ lays is in
[20:12] the soul of man and if that Gene amen is
[20:16] inside of you that come from God and you
[20:18] get that spirit in that third real
[20:21] there's an eternal life that is
[20:22] quickened on the inside of that believer
[20:25] brother B said the physical will contact
[20:27] the physical and the spirit spiritual
[20:29] will contact the spiritual but inside of
[20:31] that you got a soul and that soul is a
[20:35] gene that come from God that's pretty
[20:38] powerful brother Isaiah that's pretty
[20:40] powerful amen if you got a gene that
[20:42] come from God it's no different than
[20:44] your heavenly father giving you a gan
[20:47] than your Earthly father giving you a
[20:49] Ginge then out of that Gan comes a life
[20:52] and out of that life comes character and
[20:54] virtue and potential and ability and it
[20:57] matters what seedline you are concerning
[21:01] what kind of character or what kind of
[21:03] virtue is there listen you're not going
[21:05] to add amen p uh Dove feathers to a crow
[21:09] amen you you can't stick them in you can
[21:11] stick them in but they won't last amen a
[21:14] and but it's got to grow and so is it
[21:16] with the seed Gene of life it has the
[21:19] potential of God on the inside of that
[21:22] seed and if you put the life on the seed
[21:25] it begins to manifest every virtue that
[21:28] is is in God you don't have to work it
[21:30] up or pump it up you got to just let it
[21:33] grow amen and it'll grow because it's in
[21:36] there it comes from the soul and things
[21:38] are to be brother BR says it this he
[21:40] said if you don't line up with the word
[21:42] there's something wrong you see then
[21:44] your real father ain't God because the
[21:46] real start is in your soul amen and
[21:50] before there was even a spirit there is
[21:53] your soul and if that Soul didn't come
[21:55] from God then it's not a germ of God to
[21:57] begin with and you're received you're
[21:59] just in a patch of weeds bearing the
[22:01] world's records amen now he's being
[22:03] pretty straight here amen if you can't
[22:06] if if the word don't mean nothing to you
[22:08] he's saying the soul didn't come from
[22:10] God because the soul that come from God
[22:13] has the life of God on the inside of it
[22:16] it doesn't mean that you're perfect or
[22:18] you're free from mistakes but it means
[22:20] there's a desire in you to do the will
[22:23] of God in this generation now because
[22:26] that real start is in your soul now I I
[22:29] I tell you the the there a significance
[22:31] of that I cannot
[22:33] overemphasize that the start is in the
[22:35] soul that's why brother B said the Holy
[22:37] Ghost is a gift he says but it's a
[22:40] temporal gift but the real gift is that
[22:43] Soul it's that Gene that come from God
[22:46] do you see if it come from God it can't
[22:48] be lost amen that's why the Bible said
[22:50] that there should come in the last days
[22:52] Christ and false Christ that would
[22:54] deceive the very elected if it were
[22:58] possible other words everybody could get
[23:00] under the anointing but there's going to
[23:02] be some people with a gene seed of life
[23:05] inside of them you you can no more
[23:07] deceive them than you can deceive God
[23:10] because the very life in them in other
[23:13] words they're not acting like Christians
[23:15] they are Christians they're not acting
[23:17] like message believers they are message
[23:19] Believers they're they're not acting
[23:21] like children of God they are the
[23:23] children of God Amen it's not an
[23:25] impersonation it is a reality
[23:29] amen that's where the real start comes
[23:31] from now if you watch and and when their
[23:33] eyes were open brother Bram talks about
[23:35] the little woman at the well he loves
[23:37] this he loves this story he tells it so
[23:39] many times amen he tells the woman at
[23:42] the well you know why he tells it don't
[23:43] you because it represents his own
[23:46] Ministry because the Messiah sign that
[23:48] was given to the woman at the well was
[23:51] given to a woman because it would be
[23:53] given to the church in the end time see
[23:56] Jesus had a wicked and adulterous
[23:58] generation shall seek after a sign but
[24:00] there will be no sign given except the
[24:02] sign of Jonas remember the sign of the
[24:05] Resurrection The Sign of the
[24:07] Resurrection would be that when Jesus
[24:09] did the same things in our generation
[24:11] that he did in that generation but
[24:13] because he was the Messiah he was only
[24:15] going to people who were looking for him
[24:18] so the Samaritan was looking for him the
[24:20] Jew was looking for him the Gentile was
[24:23] not expecting a messiah they were idop
[24:26] pacing heathens they had no prophecy of
[24:28] a messiah coming but the Samaritan
[24:31] understood that the Messiah was coming
[24:33] and the Jew understood the Sam the
[24:35] Messiah was coming so he gave his sign
[24:38] to the Jew and the Samaritan but because
[24:41] there was no Gentiles to give it to he
[24:43] took a woman who was a Samaritan amen
[24:46] who was a harlot representing what the
[24:49] church would be when God found them in
[24:51] the end time and when he walked up to
[24:54] the whale he looked right down and
[24:56] brother Bram said it like this that
[24:57] little arrogant ill-famed woman probably
[25:00] poor kid had been turned out in the
[25:02] street he said but right down in her
[25:05] heart she was predestinated it was a
[25:08] predestinated seed laying there see she
[25:10] was a seed to start with before she was
[25:13] an arrogant little girl in the street
[25:15] she was a seed to start with before her
[25:18] life amen a a prostitution she was a
[25:21] seed to start with amen and you can't
[25:24] put enough trouble on that seed Amen to
[25:27] cover up what God can't redeem it out of
[25:31] the midle it really doesn't matter where
[25:33] he finds that seed it's his seed and it
[25:36] belongs to him and he can get it out
[25:39] because he Bel is still God look at what
[25:41] he done look how he found her brother BR
[25:43] said that little seed was laying in
[25:45] there amen skip to the bottom of the
[25:47] paragraph but this little woman her life
[25:50] was all marred up see that outward
[25:52] person the life was all marred up but
[25:55] down in there was a little bit of light
[25:58] way down in there was a seed waiting and
[26:01] as sure as a light can strike a seed
[26:04] it's gerti and it's going to live and
[26:07] the identification brother Bram says
[26:09] something about her he says the word
[26:11] found her I love that don't you in the
[26:14] beginning was the word and the Word was
[26:16] with God and the word became flesh and
[26:19] the word flesh found her and when the
[26:23] word found her he was sharper and
[26:26] quicker than any two red sword and
[26:29] Discerning of the thought and the intent
[26:31] of the heart he pierced past the
[26:34] darkness of prostitution he pierced past
[26:37] the darkness of her of her religious
[26:40] upbringing come on church amen religion
[26:43] had left her in a mess the Pharisees had
[26:46] left her in a mess and she was as done
[26:49] with religion as I'm done with religion
[26:51] I don't know about you all but I don't
[26:53] want religion I want Jesus I want the
[26:57] power of the Holy Ghost to come down in
[26:59] the church with Revival and reality do
[27:02] you see what it was the word found her
[27:05] and when the word found her look at the
[27:07] condition she was in but it's sharp and
[27:09] powerful and it's piercing and it's
[27:12] dividing of the spirit and the Soul her
[27:14] spirit was a prostitute that was the
[27:16] spirit but the Jean seed that was on the
[27:19] inside of her belonged to God brother
[27:21] bam says it like that she was one of
[27:23] those thoughts of God that was
[27:26] manifested woo
[27:29] she was one of those thoughts of God
[27:31] somebody say it thoughts of God thoughts
[27:33] of God she was one of those thoughts of
[27:35] God that was manifested and brother bam
[27:37] in later in identification he said and
[27:39] there were others and there were others
[27:42] that had them thoughts in God's mind he
[27:44] said like Peter and Nathaniel and all of
[27:48] those that was in God's thinking but as
[27:50] soon as that light flashed they
[27:53] recognized it Hallelujah you know what
[27:55] he said you know what brother Ram went
[27:56] on to say he said you didn't have to go
[27:58] down and get them and bring them up to
[27:59] an altar you didn't have to go and drag
[28:02] them to the things of God he said
[28:04] because there was a seed in them and a
[28:06] moment the light went over them they was
[28:08] ready to follow the word of God and I
[28:10] believe this morning there's something
[28:12] on the inside of a Believer amen you
[28:14] don't have to pump them up and make them
[28:16] do it you don't have to talk them into
[28:18] it amen just let the Holy Spirit start
[28:21] going over that seed and something on
[28:24] the inside will break out of them and
[28:26] they begin to follow God you see she was
[28:29] an actual type of the
[28:31] Bride she was a type of the Bride she
[28:33] was a woman a harlot and she had a seed
[28:36] and the messic sign came to her took
[28:39] 2,000 years for that type to
[28:42] mature and brother Ram uses this more
[28:44] than any other thing that he does
[28:46] concerning his ministry over and over
[28:48] and over and over and over and over
[28:49] again because watch He's
[28:53] reflecting somebody from the scripture
[28:56] and brother mam never stood there and
[28:58] said now I'm going to do what Paul did
[29:00] he didn't do that but he said has this
[29:03] been done since Jesus was on the earth
[29:07] and after 2,000 years the Messi sign was
[29:09] done and there was a woman so if there
[29:11] was a messiah sign we know where that
[29:13] fits that was brother brandom but where
[29:16] does the woman
[29:17] fit somebody's life right here this
[29:20] morning reflects the character of that
[29:23] woman that said Amen to that word and it
[29:26] quickened the seed that was on the
[29:28] inside of her that's right it was now
[29:31] brother Bram says it like that that's
[29:33] why in The Rapture brother Bram could
[29:34] come along and say she's Justified now
[29:37] she never done it in the first place now
[29:41] there should be a whole sermon preached
[29:43] on in the first place but I but to save
[29:46] time I'll just say this the first place
[29:49] was in God but before he was God because
[29:54] God's an object of worship right but
[29:57] Elohim is a self-existent one and that's
[30:00] where you were you were in Elohim before
[30:04] there was any physical manifestation you
[30:06] were a part of his thinking of this end
[30:10] time and you were in him then that's why
[30:13] brother B said see then the bride is
[30:15] Justified now now there's a big
[30:17] difference in Justified and forgiven big
[30:19] difference brother man said forgiven
[30:21] means you did it and then I forgave you
[30:23] for it he said but Justified means that
[30:26] you never did it actually never did it
[30:29] in other words if I came to you and I
[30:31] said to you hey I forgive you for being
[30:33] out last night drinking driving around
[30:34] in the car and you said but brother
[30:36] Wayne I wasn't out last night drinking
[30:38] driving in the car amen now I can't
[30:40] forgive you because amen you didn't do
[30:43] it then you're just not you're justified
[30:45] in other words you never did it in the
[30:47] first place now the word Justified means
[30:49] just and I I it's a play on words but
[30:52] just if
[30:54] I'd never done it just if I'd never done
[31:00] it so Justified takes a new meaning it's
[31:04] not justified for you it's
[31:07] Justified never did it amen and that
[31:10] justification brother B says she never
[31:12] done it in the first place now here's
[31:13] the word prophet and he's looking at you
[31:16] but he's not looking at you here he's
[31:18] looking at the Inner Man and he's
[31:21] identifying the Inner Man Came From
[31:23] eternity the Jean seed on the inside of
[31:26] you he is saying it never did it to
[31:29] begin with the real start is the soul
[31:32] the soul didn't start in your body it
[31:35] began in God and it's come and deposited
[31:39] in a body but you were a seed to begin
[31:42] with when you were a little bitty baby
[31:44] coming from this earth into the Earth
[31:46] God had a seed in you already come on
[31:49] Church don't tell me that you had the
[31:52] power to go into a bar when you was born
[31:54] you had the power to tell a lie Amen to
[31:57] cheat commit adultery in this first
[32:00] birth everything when you were born in
[32:02] the earth everything that would ever
[32:04] cause you to sin was in you right then
[32:07] then you got to believe like you got to
[32:09] believe like the Bible says that there
[32:11] was a seed in you also as a son or
[32:14] daughter of a God that when you came up
[32:16] to an altar you were born with the power
[32:19] to do that and no matter how many years
[32:22] you spent in the world that seed was
[32:24] there when God put you on this Earth and
[32:27] this world word has come to redeem that
[32:29] which God had already had in his Earth
[32:32] amen now it's the first place therefore
[32:35] being marred he said but now be being
[32:38] married to The Virtuous Son of God never
[32:40] Sinn she was
[32:42] foreordained now usually I put this in
[32:44] the end of my notes and I never get to
[32:45] it so I'm going to start with it this
[32:51] morning it's in the end of 14 different
[32:53] notes I've had throughout this Ephesian
[32:55] series and I never get to it come on
[32:58] we're just going to start with it if we
[33:00] run out of time glory to
[33:02] God she was for ordained see she was
[33:06] trapped and now she heard the truth and
[33:10] came forth the blood cleansed her what
[33:12] happened she heard the truth she heard
[33:15] the real truth amen she heard the truth
[33:19] for the first time in her life and it
[33:21] took the word to identify her as a
[33:24] thought of God nothing else can do it
[33:27] folks nobody else can identify you but
[33:30] this message has identified this bride
[33:33] not as a Pentecostal not as a Lutheran
[33:36] not as a Baptist but as the bride the
[33:39] literal out ring part of almighty God
[33:43] she never sinned in the first place I
[33:45] love it things that are to be brother B
[33:47] said the word of God bleeding to wash
[33:48] the bride she stands perfect virgin
[33:54] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[33:56] first place she was trapped into it now
[33:58] when I'm reading this I'm not talking
[34:00] about your human
[34:01] body there's two of you and I'm talking
[34:05] about that germ that come from God that
[34:08] is taking over this human body and this
[34:10] human body is saying you're human but
[34:13] the other part is saying your deity and
[34:16] we have focused so long on the human
[34:18] part that the deity part has been
[34:20] suppressed and oppressed amen and it
[34:23] never gets its way well I think it's
[34:25] time to turn loose of the deity partk
[34:28] and you tell this human partk I'm taking
[34:30] over this body
[34:34] Hallelujah I I believe that it's high
[34:36] time that the word of God is bled that
[34:39] it might release you you you say well
[34:42] somebody brother B said here it is you
[34:44] was trapped into it you want to deal
[34:46] with a human side you were
[34:48] trapped you were trapped into it now
[34:50] let's go in visible Union the brides
[34:52] powerful sermon brother B said you're
[34:54] standing completely Justified you never
[34:56] sined it the first place
[34:58] God don't even know
[35:01] nothing now you're sitting there trying
[35:04] to discuss this with God and God don't
[35:07] know what you're talking
[35:11] about that's the
[35:14] truth amen God don't know what you're
[35:17] talking about brother B said God don't
[35:19] even know nothing it's in the sea of
[35:22] forgetfulness now y'all know brother
[35:24] Bram uh told about it uh brother brother
[35:27] Tim PR I talked it over one time the
[35:28] lady actually was in his church came
[35:30] through a prayer line down in Louisiana
[35:32] she was a smoker came through the prayer
[35:34] line and brother Bram was telling him
[35:36] confess your sins before you get here
[35:38] and there was some people come in front
[35:39] of her and brother Bram called him out
[35:41] smoking and said you need to repent of
[35:43] that smoking then God will heal you and
[35:45] this girl sitting back here grazed a
[35:46] Methodist she got scared she said well I
[35:48] didn't know it was that big a deal but
[35:51] she got she got under conviction and she
[35:52] didn't want her mama know one she didn't
[35:54] want the whole church no one so she got
[35:56] to repentant
[35:58] and when she got in front of the brother
[35:59] bam he never called her out now there
[36:02] happened I think a couple different
[36:04] times and somebody asked brother bradam
[36:06] about it and brother Bram simply said
[36:08] look that if God don't see it how could
[36:11] his
[36:12] profit see when it's put under the blood
[36:15] that is God's created way to destroy sin
[36:20] otherwise you would have to live with
[36:22] the accumulation of your sin your whole
[36:24] life that's an Old Testament law
[36:28] the the blood of the Old Testament
[36:30] pushed it and pushed it and pushed it
[36:31] and pushed it and it accumulated but
[36:34] that day on Calvary that was a sacrifice
[36:36] made that one drop of the blood of Jesus
[36:40] Christ eradicated every sin that was
[36:43] ever committed from Adam all the way to
[36:45] the end of the world not just the not
[36:48] just sin that was amen but sin that was
[36:51] going to happen God's blood is so
[36:53] powerful he has already destroyed sin
[36:55] you ain't even committed yet he's
[36:57] already destroyed sicknesses that ain't
[37:00] even come up in your body yet because by
[37:03] his strrip you are healed by the blood
[37:06] you are saved do you see the power of
[37:08] that blood this morning amen now I know
[37:11] it's in the sea of forgetfulness now
[37:12] here's the thing you never did it that's
[37:15] a prophet now you were accused of it by
[37:18] the
[37:20] accuser but
[37:22] really I love how he says that get real
[37:26] yeah but
[37:29] really now you're accused of it get real
[37:32] man are you hearing the prophet you're
[37:35] accused of it but really from the
[37:39] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[37:41] son and daughter of God and you're
[37:44] standing here washed and your old book
[37:46] of divorcement is put away and it's dead
[37:48] and absolutely out of
[37:51] existence in the mind of
[37:54] God well glory be to God he said you're
[37:57] accused of it but
[37:59] really you're really a predestinated son
[38:02] to begin
[38:03] with now here brother B was say it like
[38:06] this you were deceived into it by your
[38:07] first marriage and it's no fault of your
[38:11] own but by your natural birth you come
[38:15] after Eve who committed adultery and
[38:17] that's the reason you was born in
[38:19] adulterous you were a sinner to begin
[38:21] with that's right you was deceived into
[38:23] it but it ain't your
[38:26] fault you
[38:28] never did it because that little germ
[38:31] that was in
[38:33] you was to be you before the foundation
[38:38] of the world now if if we could we don't
[38:40] have time to get in deep in Doctrine
[38:42] this morning in this area but y'all know
[38:44] if you if Adam hadn't to fail you would
[38:46] have been spoken word children in the in
[38:47] the garden right there would have never
[38:50] been no sin in the first place because
[38:52] you were in that the real you was in
[38:56] that Lamb's Book of Life
[38:57] that would have come out in that Garden
[38:59] under the manifested word you would have
[39:01] been a part of that word that would have
[39:03] come out in Perfection amen but because
[39:06] of the failure of Eve you came into the
[39:08] Earth and a perverted birth with
[39:10] spiritual Amnesia amen and therefore
[39:12] brother R is saying it's not your own
[39:14] fault you were born here but really
[39:17] there's a germ that was in you was to be
[39:19] you the real
[39:21] you before the foundation of the world
[39:25] now Jesus himself and redeemed brother
[39:27] Ram said what did he redeem he redeemed
[39:29] your soul from hell that's what he is
[39:31] he's a redeemer of the Soul Jesus is a
[39:34] redeemer he redeems by process 1964
[39:37] future home brother brandham tears apart
[39:40] the idea there's two Souls of course
[39:42] some people don't read all the message
[39:45] they read one part of it and they run
[39:47] off with something and then they cause a
[39:48] lot of confusion usually it's excuse for
[39:51] sin usually usually uh the Mis the
[39:54] mishandling of the word is done to make
[39:55] a hole that some man wants to fulfill
[39:58] some perversion just to be honest amen
[40:02] and they then therefore by doing this
[40:04] amen they they they uh make two
[40:07] different Souls now now if you want to
[40:10] understand the Redemption of the soul
[40:12] and understand how there's an old soul
[40:14] and a New Soul you got to go to Future
[40:16] home and you look at the Earth itself
[40:19] and brother B said watch there's three
[40:21] different Earths there's an old world
[40:24] there's a present world and there's a
[40:26] world to come but it's all the same
[40:29] Earth and the soul is just one soul but
[40:34] it's now a redeemed soul and that
[40:37] redeemed soul is through a process that
[40:39] God came down through justification
[40:41] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:44] and redeemed you now that Redemption of
[40:46] you is the real you is that right to
[40:51] show you now brother Brown the message
[40:53] identification is powerful paragraph 77
[40:55] he said to show you is the ones that he
[40:58] thought of his thoughts is the Christian
[41:02] of
[41:03] today how many Christians I got in here
[41:06] today his thought is the Christian today
[41:11] do you see you were actually his
[41:14] thoughts before the world began see man
[41:18] was born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[41:20] to the Earth speaking lies and there is
[41:22] nothing in him at all see but if he was
[41:25] God's thought when he come to the world
[41:28] he's God's thought to the beginning to
[41:30] display an
[41:32] attribute do you follow me then Jesus
[41:34] came to break the clouds back so that an
[41:38] attribute could display itself he is
[41:41] God's expressed word nothing else could
[41:44] be manifesting other characters had
[41:47] already fallen see Jesus came to redeem
[41:51] now now uh this is very uh I would need
[41:55] to really slow down to get this area but
[41:57] y'all's quick so I'll just say it fast
[41:59] but Jesus was a
[42:01] redeemer right he was a redeemer but job
[42:05] said my redeemer
[42:08] lives so the life is the
[42:12] Redeemer see now there's no life in the
[42:16] Bible that could redeem Fallen man see
[42:19] every thought that fell from heaven
[42:20] would have had to go
[42:22] unfulfilled except that the life of God
[42:26] could get into the thought and then
[42:29] Resurrect The thought now that life had
[42:32] no way to get to man unless it come
[42:34] through Calvary and was released as a
[42:37] spirit upon man so the so the Holy
[42:40] Spirit redeems the Fallen thought of God
[42:43] and makes you a Christian today so there
[42:45] it is brother B says see anything is to
[42:47] bring it back it's God's thought see
[42:50] that that think that little you that
[42:52] little me no one the world could take
[42:55] our place see it was God thought now
[42:57] Jesus says this in John 17:5 he said
[43:00] father glorify me with the glory I had
[43:03] before the world was the glory before
[43:06] the world was brother Ram said then
[43:08] Jesus was the only man that had
[43:10] pre-incarnate knowledge that's odd to me
[43:13] that William brandom then comes along
[43:16] and he starts talking about in the
[43:17] beginning God and then he said now
[43:19] before that so whatever knowledge it was
[43:23] that wrote the Bible and had existence
[43:26] before the Bible has spoke to us in this
[43:30] generation through an Elijah Prophet to
[43:33] make known and identify what it was even
[43:37] before and what it was in the Bible and
[43:40] what it is now do you see what he's
[43:42] doing he's showing you an identification
[43:45] in God he's identifying you in the Bible
[43:48] and now he's identifying you today
[43:51] what's he doing he's bringing a perfect
[43:53] faith that we were chosen in God before
[43:56] the found nations of the world brother
[43:58] Brandon brings us this in in questions
[44:00] and answers in 1953 and he said the
[44:03] first man he made was In His Image
[44:05] returning back to the image to our first
[44:07] created image when God created me
[44:09] William brandom I was before the
[44:11] foundation of the world he made my being
[44:14] my spirit I wasn't conscious as far as I
[44:16] know of he says but I don't believe
[44:18] you're getting it but Jesus told the
[44:21] disciples that he knew them before the
[44:23] foundation of the world and Paul said
[44:26] that he chose us before the foundation
[44:28] of the world that for some part of me
[44:30] Arman Neville all of the rest of you
[44:33] here that is in Christ was there before
[44:36] the world
[44:37] began and this is my analysis of this I
[44:41] think the people today are possessed
[44:44] with the spirit or the spirit a part of
[44:47] the Angelic Spirits which rotated off of
[44:50] God and never fell in the beginning and
[44:54] resisted the LIE of the devil in heaven
[44:57] then when that great theophany be to
[45:00] spin in heaven brother BR said off of
[45:02] that rotated spirits and he said those
[45:05] Spirits have anointed people in this
[45:07] generation that they wouldn't believe
[45:09] the lie of the devil in this that's why
[45:12] the Bible could say that in the end time
[45:15] there will be false Christ but you won't
[45:17] deceive the
[45:19] elected because somebody's character
[45:22] will reflect that
[45:24] scripture because they were there in in
[45:27] the beginning they were there when Jesus
[45:29] prophesied and now they're setting right
[45:32] here this morning this is not just an
[45:34] abstract bride you're not just a bride
[45:36] of his imagination this Bride is a
[45:39] reality of the Fulfillment of the
[45:41] thought of allmighty God listen this is
[45:44] a real bride she's a true bride there's
[45:47] been churches and churches and brides
[45:49] and Brides but there's got to come one
[45:52] that is the Fulfillment of the vision
[45:55] we're not here just to talk about it you
[45:57] are that hallelujah what is it now
[46:01] brother Ram has some powerful things to
[46:03] say you would think he was educated in
[46:05] the idea he said when his program was
[46:07] laid out the whole thing you were
[46:10] recognized in the program because you
[46:12] got eternal life now that word Eternal
[46:15] means it never did begin and neither can
[46:17] it end how many's got eternal
[46:20] life now come on raise it up high let's
[46:22] get some faith that life never
[46:25] began now I know you think it started on
[46:28] some day that's not true that life never
[46:31] began because it's Eternal neither can
[46:34] it end that's why we don't believe in
[46:35] pre-existence of souls you're not
[46:38] pre-existence you're Eternal you're
[46:41] you're you're a part of God do you see
[46:43] you you you're a part of his attribute
[46:46] now when brother B says this he says see
[46:48] it came in you an attribute of God's
[46:52] thinking before the world was ever
[46:55] created now that's the only way you can
[46:58] have eternal life and that life he was
[47:01] thinking of you is in you
[47:09] now that life that was before the world
[47:14] that was thinking of you is in you now
[47:19] right my
[47:23] goodness that that life yeah that was
[47:27] thinking of
[47:29] you is in you now see there's no way to
[47:34] separate that hallelujah what is it
[47:37] brother B said it's
[47:38] Elohim
[47:41] materializing right it's just Elohim
[47:44] materializing what is it that life has
[47:48] already come into the church brother
[47:50] brandom says it like this he said a real
[47:52] believer no matter what they are the
[47:54] thoroughly satisfied the thoroughly
[47:56] convinced because the life that is in
[47:58] them has already become
[48:03] Christ the life that is in you has
[48:06] already become Christ now if you take
[48:08] that quote and amen it comes and go wait
[48:10] Jesus amen let me ask you where's he at
[48:13] today you want to talk about the bride
[48:16] coming of Christ amen open up your eyes
[48:18] folks has she been so long with you that
[48:21] you have not known who she was listen
[48:24] Jesus was with Peter and he was on a
[48:26] wood boat and brother R said it was made
[48:28] of common wood and the creator of the
[48:31] wood slept in the boat and he was asleep
[48:34] he said but here we are he said made of
[48:36] Texas mud and Indiana mud and Ohio mud
[48:40] and the same one that was in that boat
[48:42] is in this boat it's the same life
[48:46] Hallelujah the same life and the life
[48:49] that is in you has become Christ amen
[48:52] that's why you can look at her and say
[48:54] she is him
[48:56] because it's the same life now here's
[48:59] the thing there has never come a message
[49:02] that could reflect the exact character
[49:04] of Jesus to identify himself on the
[49:08] earth now now um brother Brandon will
[49:11] say it very clearly in adoption he said
[49:12] you're actually never able to have the
[49:14] right kind of Faith until positionally
[49:17] you
[49:17] know right do you see faith is not just
[49:21] a a quickening it's a
[49:24] positioning because look let's get real
[49:27] okay you you when you get married let's
[49:29] just put it that way when you get
[49:30] married and you're living with one
[49:32] another and you got the marriage
[49:33] certificate and you had the wedding
[49:35] video and you got rings and you share a
[49:37] home together does that mean every day
[49:40] is going to be the best
[49:43] day but your
[49:46] position you got to know that that's
[49:48] your
[49:50] position and the bride is married in
[49:53] this age it's the marriage of the Lamb
[49:55] that's your position
[49:58] and you know really you have a you have
[50:00] a checkbook this is checkbook time you
[50:03] see what it is now you'll never really
[50:05] have the right kind of Faith until
[50:08] positionally you know that now here's
[50:11] the here's the thought his brother Brown
[50:13] will say this it's pretty amazing how he
[50:15] does say it he says down there in
[50:16] Kentucky and he said we lived in a a log
[50:19] house he said no clapboard shingles and
[50:21] things and he said there was a mirror at
[50:23] our home he said but it was just a
[50:25] mirror piece of it tacked up on a tree
[50:28] and there was a little warh bench out
[50:30] there and it was a picture pump and he
[50:32] said dad would Pump It Mor's hands and
[50:33] looked in the mirror and he said I see
[50:35] Mama stand out there and try to comb her
[50:37] hair CU there was no mirror in the house
[50:39] now now how many ever uh when you a kid
[50:43] how many ever found a little piece of
[50:44] mirror you just found a little piece of
[50:46] it you know and you tack it up on a tree
[50:49] or you put it up on a little piece and
[50:51] you know you have a hard time reflecting
[50:54] more than just a portion that's right
[50:57] yeah you know and usually usually
[50:59] they're foggy or dirty or half broke and
[51:02] you know you know and it don't do a real
[51:04] good job of reflecting the whole
[51:07] image and brother R said that that there
[51:10] was a little boy he said he was raised
[51:12] in a home much like ours and one day he
[51:15] went down to his grandma's y'all y'all
[51:17] remember the story and and they were a
[51:19] little better off down there and they
[51:21] went down to the town and he said
[51:23] upstairs there they had a a mirror that
[51:26] was on the back side of the door and he
[51:29] said he stood there and the little lab
[51:30] was lonesome he was looking around and
[51:32] he said he happened to look at that door
[51:34] that had been closed he said but then
[51:37] somebody must have opened it and he saw
[51:40] the back of that door he saw a mirror on
[51:42] it now now this Prophet is not just
[51:44] telling the story
[51:46] folks he's telling you that up to the
[51:49] opening of the word there's just been a
[51:53] little mirror tacked on the wall that we
[51:56] could get glimpses of what that real
[51:58] bride looks like but when that door
[52:01] opens up there is a is anybody ever seen
[52:05] one of them full length mirrors we got
[52:07] one of them in our bedroom I I skipped
[52:09] past that
[52:13] thing but it reflects the full image to
[52:15] you you can literally there's there's
[52:17] mirrors that can tell you what you look
[52:19] like there's mirrors that can tell you
[52:22] exactly who you are exactly what you're
[52:25] looking like and the message of the hour
[52:28] is not a partial look at the bride it's
[52:31] not just a little piece or a little
[52:33] Glimpse or a little part but it's a real
[52:36] face to face complete view of what she
[52:39] looks like from the body of the feet all
[52:42] the way to the Head I'll tell you this
[52:44] the prophet of God said that great
[52:46] mirror this morning is his word and we
[52:49] ought to be able to identify ourselves
[52:51] he says with something we're going to
[52:53] speak about now we were talking about in
[52:55] the Bible study on Friday it was it was
[52:57] it I used it kind of as a as a humor but
[52:59] but it's really true amen most of you
[53:02] got mirrors in your house and and you
[53:04] know they're they're usually personal
[53:05] they're for every you know you usually
[53:07] got a mirror for you you know and we
[53:10] were laughing about it and I was talking
[53:12] about brother Seth I know he's a NIC
[53:14] looking guy but I said Seth when did you
[53:16] ever get up in the morning and go look
[53:18] in the
[53:19] mirror and just look for a minute and go
[53:22] there stands a messiah
[53:28] can you can you just see him standing in
[53:30] the mirror
[53:32] looking Mariah come
[53:35] here you got to see this guy that's a
[53:39] messiah standing looking right here
[53:41] brother Isaiah you surely you ain't
[53:43] never done
[53:46] that but see the reason he don't do that
[53:50] is because in that mirror is a human a
[53:53] human man looking and he sees all the
[53:55] imperfection
[53:56] and he sees All the Troubles of the
[53:58] years he sees all the problems and
[54:00] they're all collected in the image that
[54:02] he's looking at it identifies all the
[54:05] years and the struggles and the problems
[54:06] and the issues and it's all looking back
[54:09] at him right there in that mirror amen
[54:11] but there's another
[54:13] mirror come on Church there's another
[54:15] mirror called the word of God and
[54:17] there's something about it when you
[54:19] start looking in this one that you'll
[54:21] holler for somebody to come here and see
[54:23] what the prophet said about me come here
[54:25] look here here's the Messiah right here
[54:28] here it is I was in him before the
[54:30] foundation of the world Carissa come and
[54:35] look it's a
[54:37] messiah do you see Church of the Living
[54:39] God Amen there is a reflection out of
[54:42] the mirror this morning of the real you
[54:44] that mirror at home is not the real you
[54:47] it's just bearing what's on the inside
[54:49] but on the inside of you is royalty you
[54:52] are looking at the Queen of Heaven you
[54:55] are looking at God God's attributes you
[54:57] are looking at the reason and the
[54:59] purpose of his being everything that God
[55:02] is is in this church everything every
[55:05] bit of his reputation all that was in
[55:08] God was poured into his son and all that
[55:12] was in Christ has been poured into this
[55:14] bride now I know we sit here this
[55:16] morning we look at the Bible and but for
[55:18] the first time we can see ourselves
[55:20] across the pages of the Bible we're not
[55:23] just a one scripture Church we're not
[55:25] just a one one one little Creed or one
[55:28] little Doctrine or one little piece we
[55:30] we have not taken one little area of the
[55:32] message and seated it down and said this
[55:35] is all there is to it brother it's an
[55:37] open book it's a whole book and the
[55:39] Bible said to eat the whole lamb and
[55:41] don't eat it Soden with water and don't
[55:44] water the thing down but put some fire
[55:46] under it and roast it and make it
[55:49] tasty ah I believe it this morning do
[55:52] you see what it is amen that the when
[55:55] the when the Bible starts opening up
[55:57] brother BR said it become a new book
[55:58] right right it become a new mirror let's
[56:01] just put it that way and brother Bram
[56:03] says it like this he said see every
[56:06] Parable in the Bible and every type of
[56:08] the Bible is made manifest right before
[56:11] us the same God in the pillar of fire
[56:13] that wrote it he came and make it
[56:15] manifest now watch him in Christ
[56:17] revealed in his own word and evening
[56:19] light says come on in every Parable
[56:23] everywhere we go nature Bible he said
[56:26] whatever it was Daniel Kings of those
[56:29] days everybody every form every move
[56:31] every place positionally shows the hour
[56:34] we're living in this entire Bible speaks
[56:37] of This Moment In Christ The Mystery of
[56:40] God revealed brother B said he had a
[56:42] goal in his mind and he said it's put in
[56:45] every type that's in the Bible the seven
[56:48] seal when it opened up we found out it
[56:50] was in every type that was in scripture
[56:52] because the seven seal is Christ it is
[56:55] life life and it's coming to the church
[56:58] do you see the third pole is not
[57:00] something for somebody else it's not
[57:02] just something for brother brandom the
[57:04] third pole we are a part of that by
[57:07] predestination that is our part of that
[57:10] word life is coming in so when you start
[57:13] reading the Bible do you see what the
[57:15] message does it redeems your life and it
[57:18] lets you look in the scripture when that
[57:21] life was represented as David when that
[57:24] same life that's in you was presented in
[57:26] scripture you can see yourself as David
[57:28] one morning you know you you fight your
[57:30] Goliath but but but that's not your only
[57:33] type that's only a portion of your
[57:36] character but you can see another
[57:38] character in shamgar when you pick up
[57:40] your ox nood and you go to whipping and
[57:42] you can see another portion of your
[57:44] character when you see Samson pick up
[57:46] the Jawbone or when you see Gideon
[57:48] coming under the inspiration and
[57:50] destroying his enemy you can see other
[57:53] parts of your body other than just that
[57:56] one part come on Tamar can't you see
[57:58] yourself when you were in desperation
[58:01] that part of you is a life that was
[58:04] causing Tamar to do what she done you
[58:06] don't know it but that was in God's mind
[58:09] when Tamar was preserving the seed line
[58:12] of Judah she was becoming a part of the
[58:16] coming of the Lord look that life was
[58:19] descending to Earth wasn't it and it was
[58:21] coming right through judah's line so
[58:24] Tamar had to do her part come on Rahab
[58:27] you had to do your part and I can show
[58:29] you in the Bible who you are in the
[58:31] Bible I can show you Rahab and I can
[58:34] show you the part she played and it only
[58:36] mirrors the life that you live and here
[58:39] you can identify yourself with it what
[58:42] was it they was a part of the
[58:45] descension he descended through 42
[58:47] Generations yeah that's right go read
[58:50] them it's 41 actually but the 42nd
[58:53] generation was yet to come in Isaiah 53
[58:55] from the cross he cried and that who
[58:57] shall declare his generation there shall
[58:59] be forth a seed and a generation shall
[59:01] be counted as the seed and who is that
[59:04] seed this morning but the Royal Seed of
[59:06] Abraham who then can look back in
[59:09] scripture and show their identification
[59:12] in every type that's in the Bible you
[59:15] are Sarah and you're Abraham you're
[59:17] David amen and your Samson see you see
[59:20] every one of those types are reflecting
[59:22] because it was a life that was in them
[59:25] that caused them to do what they were
[59:27] doing amen I'll tell you there was a
[59:29] time when Paul was here and Paul said in
[59:31] First Corinthians he said we look in a
[59:33] mirror dimly but one day face to face
[59:36] one day we're going to know as we are
[59:38] known there's the life that newest is
[59:41] going to be revealed and when this thing
[59:43] begins to open we begin to see him face
[59:46] to face and we are changed into the same
[59:50] image so something has been molding you
[59:53] throughout your life some some life has
[59:56] molded the character of your human life
[1:00:00] but this life that comes from Christ
[1:00:02] will mold you into the character of
[1:00:04] Christ see there's a real you there's a
[1:00:07] real Church somebody said which is the
[1:00:09] real church I'll tell you what a prophet
[1:00:11] said he said even Satan knows that God
[1:00:13] is immutable in his ways and even Satan
[1:00:16] can assuredly know the church at
[1:00:18] Pentecost with the power of God is Mark
[1:00:20] 16 in action and the true church that
[1:00:23] Jesus claims as his own amen Mark 16 in
[1:00:28] action is the true church Jesus claims
[1:00:30] as his
[1:00:31] own now Christ in this true church will
[1:00:34] be a continuation of the book of
[1:00:37] Acts Christ in this true church will be
[1:00:40] a continuation of the book of Acts and
[1:00:42] in this bride Greater Works will be done
[1:00:46] this bride will be Greater Works will be
[1:00:48] there and listen here is where the
[1:00:50] weakest Christian can stand this is
[1:00:53] where I take my stand that re Revelation
[1:00:56] is the greatest prevailing power that is
[1:00:59] known to man Revelation is a prevailing
[1:01:02] power and brother brandom says it is the
[1:01:05] thing that gives you authority over the
[1:01:07] Devil Revelation is what causes you to
[1:01:11] understand who you are it identifies you
[1:01:14] but that Revelation cannot come from
[1:01:16] just a school like a teacher putting two
[1:01:19] scriptures together brother ROM said
[1:01:21] it'll take Supernatural instruction for
[1:01:24] the church to understand who they are by
[1:01:26] scripture there's nobody can take you
[1:01:29] through this Bible and show you yourself
[1:01:31] except the life that wrote the Bible
[1:01:34] gets inside of you and then you can see
[1:01:37] the mirror and understand my life is his
[1:01:40] life and he I'm just as much a part of
[1:01:43] that word as he is a part of that word
[1:01:45] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:01:47] power as the power of Revelation brother
[1:01:50] BR said one of these days now I I know I
[1:01:53] don't know about you all but Rapture is
[1:01:55] my goal
[1:01:57] Rapture is my goal so the Revelation I
[1:02:01] really desire is the one that raptures
[1:02:04] you that's the one that really goes and
[1:02:07] a lot of people has that out in the
[1:02:09] distance but brother brandom didn't put
[1:02:11] it in the distance in the Rapture book
[1:02:13] he said look he said she's waiting for
[1:02:15] that Revelation and a couple verses
[1:02:17] later a couple of pages later he begins
[1:02:20] to say that first Thessalonians 4 is a
[1:02:22] revelation of a three-fold purpose of
[1:02:24] God and the out is a message the voice
[1:02:27] is when the bride begins to believe it
[1:02:29] and the trumpet is the changing of the
[1:02:31] body the revelation of the Rapture is it
[1:02:34] comes in a progression of threefold and
[1:02:37] it begins with the
[1:02:39] word and when the word takes preeminence
[1:02:42] in your life it molds the character of
[1:02:45] Jesus Christ that's why brother brandom
[1:02:47] said the new birth is a
[1:02:50] revelation glory to God it's a
[1:02:52] revelation it gives you Authority that
[1:02:55] God is revealed revealed to you this
[1:02:56] great mystery that's your new birth amen
[1:03:00] oh if the church only knew its
[1:03:02] position it will one day and the Rapture
[1:03:06] is going to go when it knows what it is
[1:03:09] hallelujah you say preacher I want a
[1:03:11] Rapture Revelation your position in
[1:03:14] Christ is the revelation of the Rapture
[1:03:17] in this last day we are not just a
[1:03:19] layout to see in church we have been
[1:03:21] positioned in first Thessalonians 4
[1:03:25] there has has been a change from a death
[1:03:27] cycle to a Rapture cycle and the church
[1:03:30] is on their way to a change of the body
[1:03:33] do you see what it is what happened what
[1:03:35] happened to Adam and Eve disbelieve the
[1:03:37] word and they fa but God has sent a
[1:03:40] message to speak another word and it's a
[1:03:44] word of incorruptibility that will
[1:03:46] resurrect the church and will change
[1:03:48] them in the moment in the twinkling of
[1:03:50] an eye if the church only knew its
[1:03:53] position and let me ask you this how are
[1:03:56] you going to identify yourself in this
[1:03:58] word without this
[1:04:00] life the life that was in him from the
[1:04:03] beginning that's why I took so much time
[1:04:06] to tell you the life in you is the
[1:04:09] thought he had then and that thought has
[1:04:12] been reflected through every scripture
[1:04:14] that's ever been written you can go to
[1:04:17] every type and find Christ so brother B
[1:04:20] said Jesus was the Fulfillment of the
[1:04:22] Old Testament but this Bride is a
[1:04:24] fulfillment of the new New Testament you
[1:04:27] have the interpretation of that word you
[1:04:29] see what it is it's not identified us in
[1:04:32] a morg it did identify us as a dead
[1:04:35] Church it identified us as the living
[1:04:38] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:04:41] God come on church this bride will not
[1:04:44] fail she can't fail because she's the
[1:04:46] word to begin
[1:04:49] with my goodness when you think of
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:04:53] it now true
[1:04:56] identification we know that Jesus was
[1:04:59] the Messiah we know he was the son of
[1:05:02] God we know he was the bridegroom he was
[1:05:04] God's Tabernacle yeah God said so he
[1:05:08] said so at the River Jordan and he said
[1:05:12] so on Mount
[1:05:13] Transfiguration but where it really
[1:05:15] spoke was in a tomb on a Sunday morning
[1:05:19] but where it really spoke was in a tomb
[1:05:21] on a Sunday morning and brother Bram
[1:05:23] said there his cold body laid dead in
[1:05:26] that
[1:05:27] tomb it laid there dead in that tomb but
[1:05:30] it wasn't to that life came back in that
[1:05:33] body that it was identified as God you
[1:05:36] see it wasn't the death that identified
[1:05:39] him as the resurrected one it wasn't the
[1:05:41] death that identified him as Isaiah but
[1:05:44] it was the resurrection that identified
[1:05:47] him and when the life come into the body
[1:05:49] that was God saying this is my
[1:05:52] body and then that body was reflected
[1:05:55] throughout the scriptures down Through
[1:05:56] the Ages do you see then the life
[1:05:58] brother brah said his body was not held
[1:06:00] in the grave it was res recognized with
[1:06:02] him in Resurrection the same as he is
[1:06:05] now listen which means this the word
[1:06:09] which he is has beg to rise the word
[1:06:14] went from Luther and Wesley and began to
[1:06:16] raise in power and begin to move and
[1:06:18] then it loved a little more but now it's
[1:06:22] coming up to
[1:06:24] identification wooo
[1:06:26] Glory it's coming up to identification
[1:06:28] do you see what he's saying when the
[1:06:29] bride knows who she is that's when the
[1:06:32] Rapture is going to go when you get your
[1:06:35] position when you know who you are by
[1:06:38] the word that's when the Rapture will go
[1:06:41] and brother B says it's coming up time
[1:06:43] now to identification see watch to the
[1:06:48] life in the
[1:06:49] body true identification is the life in
[1:06:53] the body that's what it is is brother
[1:06:55] Ram says it like that the life in the
[1:06:57] body is a Vindication the Rapture is at
[1:07:01] hand there's nothing else to happen see
[1:07:03] just the
[1:07:05] Harvest that's just the Harvest then see
[1:07:07] see what what's watch Jesus uh watch God
[1:07:10] quit his creation What What In the
[1:07:11] Garden of Eden why did he quit creating
[1:07:13] he quit creating because he reached
[1:07:16] Perfection
[1:07:17] right why does the Farmer harvest the
[1:07:21] field because the seed has reached back
[1:07:23] to seed again life has moved to its
[1:07:27] fullness to identify what the plan is
[1:07:30] and why would God continue the church
[1:07:33] age when life is now coming up to
[1:07:37] identification that this is the bride
[1:07:39] that was in his mind before the world
[1:07:42] began and who could tell you that unless
[1:07:45] it was the life that thought of you that
[1:07:47] came to you come on church this message
[1:07:50] is more than just a bunch of teaching it
[1:07:53] is the return of the pillar fire which
[1:07:56] you were a part of to begin with has
[1:07:59] come here to redeem you and identify you
[1:08:02] and say this is my people I can't call
[1:08:05] you Church no more I'm going to have to
[1:08:07] call you bride and when the bride
[1:08:09] recognizes mama that's
[1:08:12] me then she's going to go you you you
[1:08:15] you you see the correlation when she
[1:08:17] starts recognizing and seeing I know
[1:08:19] some of this is real Elementary to you
[1:08:20] but you forgive me for my elementary
[1:08:22] thoughts but I'll say this but up there
[1:08:24] in those Stars you were recognized in
[1:08:27] that pyramid you were recognized in this
[1:08:30] scripture you're recognized in the
[1:08:31] message you're recognized you just had
[1:08:34] to recognize that's you somebody's in
[1:08:37] the pyramid somebody's in the Stars
[1:08:39] somebody's in the pillar of fire mama
[1:08:42] that's me that's in there I know they've
[1:08:44] talked about it amen but there is a real
[1:08:48] you there's a real you and it's
[1:08:51] reflected in the scripture now you say
[1:08:54] preacher why in the world is it so
[1:08:56] important to see me because if you know
[1:08:58] who you are you know what belongs to
[1:09:01] you watch Abraham walking out in the out
[1:09:04] out in the promised land and when he
[1:09:06] meets mecdc out there he's just
[1:09:08] separated from lot and his Brethren and
[1:09:11] he gets out there and he's not got
[1:09:12] anything over
[1:09:14] him the Lord looks at him and says hey
[1:09:17] look to the north you look to the South
[1:09:20] and you look to the east you look to the
[1:09:23] west and everything you see belongs to
[1:09:26] you and the Church of the Living God if
[1:09:29] you get all of the unbelief beat off of
[1:09:32] you and you get all of the traditional
[1:09:35] ideas beat off of you everywhere you
[1:09:38] look in the Bible you can say that's me
[1:09:41] that's me mama that's me that belongs to
[1:09:43] me joy belongs to me peace belongs to me
[1:09:46] the Holy Ghost belongs to me life
[1:09:49] belongs to me do you see I just heard
[1:09:52] brother bam on tape this morning he's
[1:09:53] Discerning person after person he said
[1:09:55] that ought to beat the dross of unbelief
[1:09:57] off of you I said it did Brother random
[1:09:59] I believe you it beat the dross of
[1:10:01] unbelief off of my eyes and not I'm not
[1:10:04] just reading a couple Pages I'm seeing
[1:10:07] Eternal thoughts manifested in the age
[1:10:09] where we're living in every promise in
[1:10:12] This Book Is Ours no man come to the
[1:10:15] father except by
[1:10:16] me see you got to come through that life
[1:10:19] to be recognized as a part in John 6:44
[1:10:23] Jesus tells the truth that's why brother
[1:10:25] Braham says he would get on election and
[1:10:27] he' get on it real
[1:10:30] strong well I guess I picked up his
[1:10:34] habit election and election real
[1:10:39] strong now there might be brothers that
[1:10:44] feel more qualified to beat the church
[1:10:45] into
[1:10:47] position but that ain't
[1:10:50] me I read where the prophet of God said
[1:10:53] that Israel was putting in their Nation
[1:10:56] by
[1:10:57] persecution but the church would be put
[1:10:59] in its position by the power of
[1:11:01] God so I say open up the
[1:11:04] channels and let the power of God come
[1:11:07] until we find our position in that word
[1:11:10] brother you don't have to brother said
[1:11:12] it in the spring of the year you never
[1:11:14] seen angels with with uh uh with ladders
[1:11:17] up and down the road on the on the oak
[1:11:19] trees you never seen a bunch of angels
[1:11:21] God ain't got a ain't got a lick a leaf
[1:11:23] picking poliy that comes in the spring
[1:11:26] of the year to get the old last year's
[1:11:28] leaves off but man said they nobody has
[1:11:30] to do that he said they may hang on
[1:11:32] their all winter but when the New Life
[1:11:34] Starts coming he said when the New Life
[1:11:37] Starts coming it just pushes off the old
[1:11:39] and it brings on the new brother let the
[1:11:42] new life get in that inner man and it'll
[1:11:45] push off the old habits it'll push off
[1:11:47] the old ideas it'll push them off we
[1:11:50] don't have to compromise we don't have
[1:11:52] to beat somebody into form just get life
[1:11:55] in them and Watch The Life begin to
[1:11:57] bring changes that's right amen because
[1:12:01] these people are ordained to believe
[1:12:03] there are three classes of people and I
[1:12:05] really believe these are genuine
[1:12:07] Believers I say that because somebody
[1:12:09] who had their names written in the
[1:12:11] Lamb's Book of Life was before the
[1:12:12] foundation of the world I happen to
[1:12:14] believe I was on that
[1:12:17] book you say how do you know you're on
[1:12:19] that book well how' Peter know
[1:12:21] it how did Peter know to reflect his
[1:12:25] self in that book how did he get from
[1:12:28] from a ignorant fisherman to recognizing
[1:12:31] he was in that book brother Bram said
[1:12:32] I'll tell you how he did it he said when
[1:12:34] that Messiah sign strick over that seed
[1:12:36] he said he knew his name was in the book
[1:12:38] because the light struck the seed that's
[1:12:41] exactly what happened that woman the wh
[1:12:43] That's exactly what happened to people
[1:12:45] throughout the nation and that's exactly
[1:12:47] what happened to
[1:12:48] me do you see what it is you identify
[1:12:52] yourself as having your name in that
[1:12:55] book brother Bram said God never came
[1:12:57] goth it not he said he never came to
[1:12:59] redeem the devil's
[1:13:01] children he came to redeem his
[1:13:04] own that's what it was he come to redeem
[1:13:06] his own his own children now as sure as
[1:13:09] there's a natural seed there's a
[1:13:10] spiritual genan seed and in that genan
[1:13:13] seed brother Bram said that Gene is in
[1:13:16] us and we were Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:18] to begin with when God called you he had
[1:13:21] already for ordained you for when God
[1:13:25] called Romans 8:29 and 30 to the to them
[1:13:28] that he called he's already
[1:13:31] Justified and them that he justified
[1:13:33] he's already glorified I love how
[1:13:36] brother Brown reads it and says let the
[1:13:38] devil have all the temper tantrum he
[1:13:39] wants to have they're already
[1:13:43] glorified not in this
[1:13:46] body but in the presence of
[1:13:49] God now I know some people maybe don't
[1:13:52] agree with this but I'm preaching and I
[1:13:55] know brother Ray believes it and I
[1:13:56] believe it so we're going to preach it
[1:13:58] anyhow but do you know in Matthew 18th
[1:14:00] chapter that Jesus said that all
[1:14:02] children die goes to
[1:14:05] heaven and he said the reason being is
[1:14:07] their Angels behold the father's face
[1:14:10] and when he picked that up brother
[1:14:11] brandham was asked about that question
[1:14:13] and brother brandham said that's the
[1:14:15] aanes that's your angelic
[1:14:18] body amen not that you're an angel we're
[1:14:21] talking about Celestial and he said that
[1:14:24] body is in the presence of the father no
[1:14:27] wonder he could say you're already
[1:14:29] glorified somebody said well you don't
[1:14:31] even have a theophany really brother bam
[1:14:33] said when you recognize this message is
[1:14:35] Eagle food you heard from it well I
[1:14:38] don't know about you but I heard from my
[1:14:41] fony and my I didn't just hear it I
[1:14:44] heard a call from it and that call come
[1:14:47] right out of this message that that that
[1:14:49] was the very thing that brother bam said
[1:14:51] was that was that theophany standing
[1:14:53] there that's why he could therefore say
[1:14:57] they're already
[1:14:58] glorified now brother brandham actually
[1:15:02] seeing those bodies within 20 ft of his
[1:15:07] bedroom I don't know how long this
[1:15:09] building is but it's a lot longer than
[1:15:11] any 20
[1:15:12] ft so I'd say a person sitting in the
[1:15:14] middle of this building strikes a very
[1:15:17] good chance of being within the reach of
[1:15:20] the theophanies that's beyond the
[1:15:21] curtain of
[1:15:22] Time come on church it's not a million
[1:15:25] miles away it's just in a dimension
[1:15:29] that's a little faster than this one and
[1:15:32] the prophet of God is telling us one of
[1:15:33] these days we're going to speed
[1:15:36] up oh that's why this anointing that
[1:15:39] came is not an ox anointing it's not
[1:15:41] laying bound and slow it's an eagle
[1:15:43] anointing and they catch the Revelation
[1:15:46] amen it's a quicking in the end time
[1:15:49] it's a spirit of God that comes upon the
[1:15:50] church it's the real you now now I'm
[1:15:54] going to say this amen uh uh Revival uh
[1:15:57] brother Seth but where of you brother
[1:15:59] that's a that's a good quote you sent me
[1:16:00] this week Amen on Revival I think you
[1:16:03] come out of recognizing your presence
[1:16:05] Topeka if you hadn't heard the Topeka
[1:16:07] series go listen to the Topeka series
[1:16:09] it's amazing son of man's all through
[1:16:11] there but in that brother Bram describes
[1:16:13] what a real Revival is now what a real
[1:16:16] one is and he says really he says what a
[1:16:20] real Reviving is a real Revival is not
[1:16:23] an adding
[1:16:25] right it's not an adding he said what
[1:16:28] that is is it's a cleaning up of what
[1:16:29] you
[1:16:30] got it's a it's a it's a refreshing of
[1:16:33] what you got now I I know the church is
[1:16:35] growing and I appreciate the Lord for
[1:16:37] letting it grow but I don't want just
[1:16:39] see the church grow I want to see
[1:16:41] predestinated
[1:16:42] seed that's why we're not backing off of
[1:16:45] the message we're not going to we're not
[1:16:46] going to water the message down to
[1:16:48] incorporate all the world come on Church
[1:16:51] we're going to preach the message and
[1:16:53] bring the genuine Fe and feed the word
[1:16:56] of God this is the theophany calling
[1:16:59] back we're not interested in building
[1:17:01] the biggest church we're interested in
[1:17:03] preaching the message of the hour to the
[1:17:06] elect seed we're going to leave here one
[1:17:09] of these
[1:17:10] mornings are you reading the news
[1:17:13] Israel's in a great mess it may be in
[1:17:15] the morning this bride may be finding
[1:17:19] her position this morning the last one
[1:17:22] might be setting hearing me preach this
[1:17:24] morning then why could I preach a
[1:17:26] Baptist sermon or why could I preach a
[1:17:28] Lutheran sermon worried about somebody's
[1:17:30] feelings getting hurt brother you can't
[1:17:32] hurt the bride's feelings with this
[1:17:35] message you can't hurt the bride's
[1:17:37] feelings with this message they're not
[1:17:40] scared of the name William brandom
[1:17:42] they're not scared of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:44] they're not scared of shouting and
[1:17:46] rejoicing and praising because they were
[1:17:49] there when the Bible said job
[1:17:53] shouted woo
[1:17:57] somebody's shouting right here this
[1:17:58] morning somebody said well that's just
[1:17:59] too far but here's the problem is
[1:18:01] brother bam said last one's going to
[1:18:03] come in
[1:18:04] somewhere it might not be a churchwide
[1:18:07] Revival it might not be a World Revival
[1:18:09] it may be one
[1:18:10] person one person when God went to
[1:18:13] Lazarus in the Tomb it was one man
[1:18:16] coming out which represents this bride's
[1:18:19] Revival it may be one person at a time
[1:18:22] it may be in one person and not another
[1:18:25] but he called Lazarus by name and so has
[1:18:29] this message called you by
[1:18:32] name brother what was it when that
[1:18:35] Revival began it was a hearing of the
[1:18:37] name brother B said this book holds the
[1:18:39] mystery and the unfolding of it now the
[1:18:43] mystery of this book is calling names
[1:18:45] the opening of the word the opening of
[1:18:48] the door put a mirror before the church
[1:18:52] told you who you was called your name
[1:18:54] said come on your rewards what is it
[1:18:56] amen the same one that woke up ji's
[1:19:00] daughter with not a general Resurrection
[1:19:02] but he said the woman sleepeth she don't
[1:19:04] she didn't die she sleeps and brother B
[1:19:07] said what was it her name was on the
[1:19:08] Lamb's Book and there might have been
[1:19:11] many maidens that morning that had went
[1:19:13] to sleep or died he said but not that
[1:19:16] one and when he went down to the house
[1:19:19] he proved brother B said he proved his
[1:19:21] word was right when he spoke her name
[1:19:23] and she come alive he said but he proved
[1:19:26] something else too he said he also
[1:19:28] proved that he was all knowing he had
[1:19:30] four knowledge and he knew her name
[1:19:33] before he called her and God knew your
[1:19:37] you see this message has four knowledge
[1:19:39] it knew about you before you got
[1:19:43] here you don't think brother Ram just
[1:19:45] preaching to the people in the 60s do
[1:19:48] you man he was calling it an infant
[1:19:51] bride Church in the 60s
[1:19:55] you see what it is he proved he was God
[1:19:56] and he proved what he knew was there now
[1:19:59] it looks dark for Revival and I
[1:20:01] understand there's a lot of darkness in
[1:20:02] the world we're living in it looks dark
[1:20:04] but it's no darker than it was the night
[1:20:07] that the disciples were on the sea and
[1:20:10] brother said a devil got on every wave
[1:20:12] and said I'll sink this ship the problem
[1:20:14] with that ship is Jesus wasn't on
[1:20:17] it oh but brother Bram said oh he said
[1:20:20] there it is but when all the Hope was
[1:20:22] gone for Revival they saw him walking on
[1:20:25] that
[1:20:26] sea they saw him walking on that sea how
[1:20:29] many knows what that actually
[1:20:32] represents now when brother Bram says it
[1:20:34] brother brother Bram says one place he
[1:20:36] says brother Bram are you saying the
[1:20:38] spirit of God will be on the church and
[1:20:41] brother man said yes he said that's
[1:20:43] exactly what the book of Isaiah says the
[1:20:46] government shall be on their
[1:20:48] shoulders and then he goes over to the
[1:20:51] Book of Daniel the 12th chapter and he
[1:20:52] opens it and Daniel said he seen times
[1:20:55] and times and half a time and then the
[1:20:57] book would be opened and he said there
[1:20:58] was a man in the water standing there
[1:21:02] with a Wi on and brother Braham said
[1:21:05] there it was it was the Holy Ghost on
[1:21:07] the water he said what did the water
[1:21:10] represent in Revelation 17 it was the
[1:21:12] people so when you see the Holy Ghost on
[1:21:15] the people it will be a sign of the end
[1:21:18] time when Jesus come walking on the
[1:21:20] water brother Bram said it
[1:21:23] represented the Resurrection Ministry of
[1:21:26] Christ would come to the people on the
[1:21:29] water in other words it would come
[1:21:32] through the people and the people when
[1:21:34] they when they when they when they were
[1:21:36] without
[1:21:37] hope when it was dark when they were
[1:21:40] only worried about survival he said here
[1:21:42] he come walking and if that hasn't
[1:21:45] happened
[1:21:48] again and if that hasn't happened again
[1:21:52] he said but the people are afraid of it
[1:21:56] now watch the only hope to survive and
[1:21:58] the people are afraid of it the only way
[1:22:01] to get into the Revival that people are
[1:22:04] afraid of and the prophet of God goes on
[1:22:07] to say this he says see but here he says
[1:22:10] what it is he said when when that little
[1:22:11] boy died back there in the scripture and
[1:22:13] he said the the woman sent after Elijah
[1:22:16] he G she gave a she gave a stick to her
[1:22:17] servant said go get go go run or Elijah
[1:22:20] did actually told his servant said go
[1:22:22] run lay the stick on the boy and he said
[1:22:24] don't you stop for nothing and brother
[1:22:26] Ram said that's the same way with our
[1:22:28] commission that's the way Miracles are
[1:22:31] done is that we go without stopping for
[1:22:35] soup
[1:22:36] suppers Bunko games worldly events and
[1:22:39] then he says what you have to do is you
[1:22:41] got to lay aside all of those things of
[1:22:43] the world he said we're stopping too
[1:22:46] much he says and then we're because
[1:22:48] watch what listen what he's doing he's
[1:22:50] laying out what's stopping the church
[1:22:52] he's saying you've been commissioned to
[1:22:53] go do this but you you stop for mle
[1:22:56] games you stop for card parties you stop
[1:22:59] for denominations and then he stops IT
[1:23:01] and throws it in here he says and then
[1:23:03] we're stopping because if we're afraid
[1:23:05] we're going to get too
[1:23:08] fanatical is't that something brother
[1:23:11] bram's being afraid of the moving of the
[1:23:14] spirit right in with Bunko games and
[1:23:15] card
[1:23:16] parties we're afraid we're going to get
[1:23:18] too fanatical and brother B said I'm
[1:23:20] more scared of the person that's afraid
[1:23:23] of it than I am the person that's the
[1:23:26] fanatic I'm more afraid of the person
[1:23:29] that's afraid of the Holy Ghost than I
[1:23:30] am the Holy Ghost getting out of line
[1:23:33] now somebody said well brother Wayne hey
[1:23:35] man I've just been in some meetings and
[1:23:36] they just get so rough well I'll tell
[1:23:38] you what brother Ram says he said
[1:23:40] somebody said today I've seen
[1:23:41] Pentecostals kick the seats over in the
[1:23:43] floor yeah and break up the furniture
[1:23:47] yeah and he said have they got anything
[1:23:51] and brother bam said oh yeah he says
[1:23:54] they have the Holy Ghost he said yes sir
[1:23:57] he says well we Baptist have it too he
[1:24:00] said if you did you got it after you
[1:24:02] believed when you believed they believe
[1:24:04] you get it when you believe but Acts 19
[1:24:06] says have you received it since you
[1:24:08] believed and he said I can stand a
[1:24:10] little wildfire and a kicking over the
[1:24:13] furniture before I could set in an old
[1:24:16] church so cold the spiritual thermometer
[1:24:18] goes below zero brother R said I'd
[1:24:20] rather you kick the pews over as turn
[1:24:23] the heat off
[1:24:25] off amen now now what's he talking about
[1:24:28] see brother B says but what's really
[1:24:30] happening is people's only painting a
[1:24:32] fire to the church he said that's what
[1:24:35] these Baptists are doing thank God we're
[1:24:37] not Baptist this morning he said that's
[1:24:39] what their Baptist is doing amen he says
[1:24:41] there he says what good does a freezing
[1:24:44] man do with a beautiful picture as a
[1:24:47] great fire but it burnt 2,000 years
[1:24:51] ago how you going to warn by that it'd
[1:24:54] be like me coming up here and putting a
[1:24:57] big old backdrop of a nice pretty fire
[1:25:00] with a bunch of people and you can even
[1:25:02] put the 12 apostles around the fire
[1:25:04] warming their hands but how you going to
[1:25:06] get warmed of
[1:25:07] that that's 2,000 years ago now Church
[1:25:11] these meetings that brother random had
[1:25:13] were 50s and 60s and some of you heard
[1:25:17] about the revivals of the 80s and you've
[1:25:19] heard about the '90s this is
[1:25:21] 2024 how you going to re how you going
[1:25:24] to warm this new generation by the fires
[1:25:27] that happened 50 years ago we can tell
[1:25:30] them how God came and how God did and
[1:25:32] what God did but I say what we ought to
[1:25:35] do is we ought to build a fire just like
[1:25:38] the one that saved me and just like the
[1:25:41] one that saved
[1:25:43] you hallelujah hallelujah I don't want
[1:25:46] to paint no fire I want to build one I
[1:25:49] want to build a fire that's so hot it'll
[1:25:52] burn out every disease it'll burn burn
[1:25:54] out every sin it'll burn out every
[1:25:57] formalism I say build a fire and throw
[1:26:00] some gasoline on it while you're busy
[1:26:03] and let the Holy Ghost Flames Begin to
[1:26:05] burn across the Church of the Living God
[1:26:08] I'll tell you what brother Ram says it
[1:26:09] like this he says he we don't need this
[1:26:12] in the
[1:26:14] Millennium we're not going to need this
[1:26:16] in the Millennium we need it right now
[1:26:18] we don't need a miracle in the
[1:26:20] Millennium we'll have a glorified body
[1:26:22] in the Millennium we don't need a praise
[1:26:24] service in the Millennium we need it
[1:26:26] right now we need these old bodies that
[1:26:29] are arguing with the inner man these old
[1:26:32] clumps of clay that are formal and
[1:26:34] they're tired and they're weary and
[1:26:36] they're upset we need them to get under
[1:26:39] the submission of the inner man until
[1:26:42] they begin to worship God and the fear
[1:26:44] leaves and the trouble leaves that the
[1:26:47] power of God can sweep through the
[1:26:49] church like never before I say every
[1:26:52] generation has a chance I say every
[1:26:55] young person ought to know what it's
[1:26:57] like brother Dallas I don't believe we
[1:26:59] ought to have to take our kids to no
[1:27:01] dance before they can dance I don't
[1:27:03] believe our children ought to have to
[1:27:05] learn how to dance under rock and roll
[1:27:07] parties down at the bar I think they
[1:27:09] ought to be a holy ghost moving in the
[1:27:11] church where the victory songs can be
[1:27:13] sang where we can clap our hands and
[1:27:15] move under the spirit of God and not
[1:27:17] feel bad about it
[1:27:20] tomorrow well somebody help me this
[1:27:23] morning I don't believe we ought to have
[1:27:25] to feel bad tomorrow because we worship
[1:27:27] God
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:31] today I'm I I'm serious I don't believe
[1:27:34] that these young people are to have to
[1:27:36] drink whiskey to experience being
[1:27:38] drunk I know what a prophet said he said
[1:27:41] we ought to get so drunk that we forget
[1:27:43] our names brother that's pretty drunk we
[1:27:47] ought to get so drunk in the spirit till
[1:27:49] we forget what our name is and remember
[1:27:52] who we really are remember we really are
[1:27:55] the children of God we really are the
[1:27:57] presence of God in the age we're living
[1:28:00] in my goodness to think of it today
[1:28:02] somebody said well I'll tell you what
[1:28:04] brother Wayne you know it's just that
[1:28:06] old it's just that old Wildfire well
[1:28:08] brother B said I'd rather have a fire
[1:28:09] it's popping and you have to throw coals
[1:28:11] back in it it's not have one at
[1:28:13] all if you're cold and this is a cold
[1:28:17] age this is a dark time and the only
[1:28:20] hope is to get the life in you that's in
[1:28:23] that fire and that fire created you it
[1:28:26] can identify
[1:28:28] you it's a painted fire brother R said
[1:28:31] he said now what good would it do to
[1:28:33] feed a canary and keep it in a cage amen
[1:28:38] let me ask you what good would it do for
[1:28:40] me to preach the greatest message that's
[1:28:44] ever hit the planet astronaut fuel that
[1:28:48] would break every barrier it'll tear
[1:28:50] down every Power it'll destroy every
[1:28:53] unbelief it'll put a gust of wind under
[1:28:56] the wings of the church it'll bring
[1:28:58] inspiration and powers and fellowship of
[1:29:01] Truth amen what good is it to preach a
[1:29:03] message like the message we have been
[1:29:05] given amen and not let the church enjoy
[1:29:08] it come on church what good would it do
[1:29:11] to feed them the word and then tell them
[1:29:13] they can't be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:15] with freedom well I tell you what if
[1:29:17] they can be sons of God in heaven I
[1:29:19] think they ought to be here and if
[1:29:21] they're Daughters of God in heaven they
[1:29:22] ought to be here and if they shouting in
[1:29:24] heaven they already to be able to shout
[1:29:25] here if they have joy in heaven I say
[1:29:28] have joy in here and there ain't no
[1:29:30] devil going to take my
[1:29:32] joy I ain't going to allow it
[1:29:38] brother now sorry too
[1:29:42] late somebody say well I can't believe
[1:29:44] our pastors acting like that hey look if
[1:29:46] I can't do this and be a pastor I don't
[1:29:48] need to be a pastor
[1:29:49] then if if David if David as a king
[1:29:52] could dance before the the Lord in front
[1:29:55] of his whole country I believe a pastor
[1:29:57] hard to be able to dance in the spirit
[1:29:59] and say God is my Creator and God filled
[1:30:02] me with the Holy Ghost yes he did and
[1:30:05] I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed to
[1:30:07] worship him I'm not ashamed to give
[1:30:10] voice to him I'm not ashamed of the
[1:30:12] power of God I say Bring it on I say
[1:30:15] young people Bring it on Bring the fire
[1:30:19] bring the fire of
[1:30:22] God we're going in a camp meeting it

[1:33:37] that Jordan or that Red Sea if you're a
[1:33:41] Christian you were there you were there
[1:33:43] when the pillar of fire came down and
[1:33:44] wroe out the Commandments you were there
[1:33:46] you were there when they crossed the
[1:33:47] Jordan and they marched Down the Walls
[1:33:49] of Jericho you were there when these
[1:33:51] things happened you was always in there
[1:33:54] in every type you was there but you
[1:33:56] think you were less there when John
[1:33:58] baptized Jesus and a pillar of Fire come
[1:34:00] out of the heavens and got into him do
[1:34:02] you think you were less there when he
[1:34:04] cried from the cross my God my god
[1:34:07] father forid them they don't know what
[1:34:09] they do brother BR said you were there
[1:34:11] he said you were there in him and you
[1:34:14] paid for your sins in him and you paid
[1:34:16] for your deaths in him and you died in
[1:34:19] him but brother three days later he come
[1:34:22] out of the Tomb and and we rose with him
[1:34:25] on that Easter morning we rose from the
[1:34:28] dead out of that out of that grave and I
[1:34:30] was there and I was there when he came
[1:34:32] out of the grave and I was there when
[1:34:34] 120 somebody said well brother Wayne how
[1:34:36] do you know that you would have been
[1:34:37] there cuz I'm here
[1:34:39] now I know I'd have been there cuz I'm
[1:34:42] here brother BR said that's the way you
[1:34:44] do it look at the character you are now
[1:34:46] and you'll know what you would have
[1:34:48] [Applause]
[1:34:49] been I was there oh yeah
[1:34:53] I don't remember how many thesis Martin
[1:34:55] Luther tacked up how many was that I say
[1:34:57] it wrong every time 90
[1:35:01] something huh 95 95 of them I was there
[1:35:05] for all
[1:35:08] 95 and I was
[1:35:11] there when that man had something on the
[1:35:13] inside of him and says I will not bow to
[1:35:16] this
[1:35:18] system I don't regret what I have said
[1:35:21] and I will not bow to the system it says
[1:35:23] I can't say it I was
[1:35:27] there that's right I was there when when
[1:35:30] the Holy Ghost fell up there oh yeah but
[1:35:33] brother you see that's where most people
[1:35:35] quit their identification stops right
[1:35:38] there with a partial image of the church
[1:35:40] that the tongues come on the day of
[1:35:42] Pentecost there in isua 1906 when the
[1:35:45] spirit of God begin to fall and that's
[1:35:47] where a lot of people start identifying
[1:35:48] the world over in the charismatic Realms
[1:35:50] that's as far as God wi as far as they
[1:35:52] could concern but brother in
[1:35:55] 1933 there was a light come down out of
[1:35:58] that Jord over that Ohio River just like
[1:36:00] it did the Jordan amen and that star
[1:36:02] that come down and brightened our Trail
[1:36:04] I was there somebody said well it didn't
[1:36:06] happen it did happen I was there when it
[1:36:08] happened I was there when it happened I
[1:36:12] saw it with my own
[1:36:14] eyes now you think I'm crazy don't you
[1:36:16] well let me tell you I am not in the
[1:36:19] feet of the church I looked in the
[1:36:21] mirror I'm not in the shoulders of this
[1:36:23] church I'm not even in the mouth of this
[1:36:25] church I went into the eye of the church
[1:36:28] and Malachi 4 gave us eyes and we got
[1:36:31] eyes to see what happened in 1933 and I
[1:36:35] got eyes I could see what happened when
[1:36:37] God visited that man in 1947 in a pillar
[1:36:40] of fire it turned into a bean just like
[1:36:42] it did with Joshua at the walls of
[1:36:44] Jericho do you see what it is I I was
[1:36:47] there and some people now try to say
[1:36:49] these things didn't happen
[1:36:53] but I was
[1:36:55] there do you see when that when that
[1:36:58] cloud appeared out there on Mount Sunset
[1:37:00] brother B said it's our Lord up there
[1:37:03] what was it it was headship oh he
[1:37:05] thought about you and me was being
[1:37:08] revealed in that headship which became
[1:37:10] this message I was
[1:37:13] there brother I didn't stop in
[1:37:16] 1963 and I didn't stop in the Easter of
[1:37:18] 1965 when they put our profit in the
[1:37:20] ground but I was there when these little
[1:37:23] church churches started forming all over
[1:37:25] the country and Men of God begin to bust
[1:37:27] and and plane out and make trails and
[1:37:29] inner roads for the teaching of this
[1:37:31] world I was there amen 40 years ago when
[1:37:34] Ray Ericson founded this church of True
[1:37:36] Word Tabernacle I was there but brother
[1:37:39] I wasn't just there then I'm here this
[1:37:42] morning to confess that the same
[1:37:45] God the same God that done that is doing
[1:37:50] this and this generation has a chance at
[1:37:53] the
[1:37:54] Revival how do I know I was
[1:37:58] there and I'm right here this
[1:38:01] morning stand to your feet with me this
[1:38:03] morning hallelujah hallelujah and I'm
[1:38:05] right here this
[1:38:07] morning we got a chance at this
[1:38:13] revival but ain't I stand in the prayer
[1:38:15] line with you when God blessed
[1:38:18] you and I wasn't only there when that
[1:38:21] happened I stood in the blessing
[1:38:28] see if you were there you're
[1:38:33] here if you were there you're
[1:38:36] here somebody said well there ain't no
[1:38:38] such a thing as the aony then why am I
[1:38:41] here because I was
[1:38:44] there this man wasn't
[1:38:47] there but that inner man was there
[1:38:54] he was
[1:39:01] there you know you were
[1:39:05] too there was a time I didn't know
[1:39:10] that but when that great
[1:39:13] light the one I was a part
[1:39:17] of came and began to open the scriptures
[1:39:20] I began to see myself in that scripture
[1:39:23] that's when I realized I was
[1:39:26] there I can see my
[1:39:28] reactions literally I can see some of my
[1:39:31] own reactions reflected in some of those
[1:39:34] men you know you you're sitting there
[1:39:36] shaking your head you know exactly what
[1:39:37] I'm talking about you go my goodness
[1:39:39] that's exactly what happened to
[1:39:44] me because the same life that's in you
[1:39:48] was right in that then to build you a
[1:39:51] mirror that way you're not identified by
[1:39:54] a
[1:39:55] church you're not identified by a
[1:39:57] teaching right you're identified by
[1:40:00] Christ am I am a
[1:40:04] Christian and in the truest sense of the
[1:40:07] word
[1:40:08] Levi you are a Christian amen because
