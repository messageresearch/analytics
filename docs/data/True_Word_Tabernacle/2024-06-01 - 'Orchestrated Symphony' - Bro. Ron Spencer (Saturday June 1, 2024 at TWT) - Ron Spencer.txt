that's what we believe isn't it amen I never uh was always amazed with the story of of Georgie Carter I believe she was nine years and something in a bed and she couldn't she couldn't get up and walk come on and you know that many years in bed she'd even lost the power to walk right even if she wanted to she couldn't have got up and mov cuz there's no there's no muscle memory left and the muscles have all gone by that time but you know brother Brown was out in the woods praying and that great Angel of the Lord came by he said you go by the way of Carter she's going to raise up from that bed today and the prophet said I walked in that house and when I walked in I looked down on the bed and he said Georgie in the name of the Lord Jesus rise up and walk amen and he said as I heard myself say that I said how in the world will that girl ever walk come on but brother Bram said but see there's a hidden power right and that power in the word she was going to walk that day it wasn't by the strength of her legs but it was the power of the word of God that was going to cause her to rise up and you know when I think about it today I tell you I believe it's time to throw away the crutches on Amen the little feelings and situations maybe you ain't been walking by faith and there's something happened in your life throw down your crutches get out of your wheelchair get off of the bed of Affliction and say I'm going to walk in the name of Jesus I believe you you can do it tonight because greater is he that is in me than he that is in this world and no matter the trial tribulation the struggles whatever you're going through believe me tonight you can walk amen and if you give us a little time this little bride's going to walk right on out of here she's going to just keep walking that Enoch walk Till There ain't going to be no more of her amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it it's good to feel the faith of the holy spirit in the building tonight and amen I don't know about you but I believe Miracles are in the building I believe somebody's going to go away from here tonight with a testimony and they're going to say it was that Saturday night the Holy Ghost come by he spoke to my need and it's never been the same from that moment forward listen folks I believe it many testimonies you hear and the great testimonies you read about was on a night just like tonight right it was in an atmosphere just like you're in now except it was somebody else's story somebody else's problem but it was the same God and that same Jesus is in this building tonight and whatsoever thing you can believe it is possible all things are possible Amen to them that have faith you know it's amazing the prophet said it like this there is nothing too hard for the Lord so whatever situation you have tonight I believe that you have come to a place that that can change amen amen if you could just receive it in your heart it can change we want to believe it tonight amen

the Lord and the lord gave him a a little grandbaby and I said Eve that's that's you you're a miracle and of course all my grandbabies are a miracle and uh so a little later that day she was saying something about being a miracle and said Papa I'm a miracle I said that's right honey amen so the other day she got in trouble she was in timeout and she was crying she looked up at Mama and she said Mama but I Miracle mama I thought that's right we're all God's Miracles but sometimes we get in trouble but that's a time to plead to plead our promises amen God is so used God is so used brother Ron

that's the way it is amen if you will turn with me to Revelations chapter 21 and then the Revelation chapter 19 I'd like to speak to you on God's orchestrated Symphony and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and if he saw that Vision it will take place and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God yeah I love that portion yeah and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death let's just shout neither sorrow nor crying and neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful amen Revelations 19 and verse one and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power un the the Lord Our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with fornication and hath Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said Hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the 4 and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen Allelujah and a voice came from the throne saying praise our God all ye his his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as if it were a voice of a great multitude is a a voice of many Waters and and a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth Amen Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and her was granted that she should be ar raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called to the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God you may be seated brother Brandon praise a prayer I'd like to share with you he said May Our Lives be so submitted to thee that the holy spirit will live itself through us and speak through US Lord may we remember in our minds as we walk upon the street and rub our arms with the world that we're not supposed to be like those and we step aside and give them Place Lord in their rightful position here on Earth we'll take the backseat knowing that we are delegates from another world yeah I think that's so powerful we have a kingdom that's coming into Power Lord and our great king will soon arrive and and take over all the kingdoms that's in his domain and he shall Rule and Reign and with him here on the earth a thousand years and be with him forever amen amen Jesus says in the scriptures in St John chapter 14 says let not your heart be troubled yeah you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you amen and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto my myself that where I am you believe that and whether I go you know and and the way that you know and Thomas saith unto him Lord uh we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the wayen the truth and the life amen what a way to put it I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me and if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it that's pretty simple isn't it I will do it now the scripture says and brother Brandon would teach us that in a symphony there's always Junctions I've just read to you a few Junctions yeah your future home yeah wedding supper right now Jesus is promise I just did it in a backwards way cuz I want to catch you he's told you I'm going to build a place for you right now watch another Junction a prophet stands and says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen that's a powerful statement in it in Isaiah chapter 60 in verse one arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee second Peter would say it like this in verse one and verse 16 for we have not followed cunningly devis fables we were made known unto you by the power of the coming of the Lord Jesus but were eyewitnesses [Applause] eyewitnesses your eyewitnesses to what's going on right now of his majesty for he received from God the father and the glory and the honor when when there was such a voice to him that was from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased amen and this voice which came from heaven we heard and we were with him in the Holy Mountain and we have a more sure word of Prophecy and a We believe We Do where unto you do well when you take heed as a light that shineth in a dark place under the day Dawn and that day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God wrote the Sheep music holy men of God wrote the Sheep music and spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost now I want to catch you again Revelation 5 and verse 9 and they sung a new song we got you now back into it and they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed named us to God by our blood of out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and it's made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and if that's the Sheep music that's what we'll play brother brandom says this and this is very pertinent to the hour and brother Tim even mentioned it last night like is back in her Promised Land she don't even know how she got back there yeah she was just automatically put back there why National Force put her in her place he says now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland and National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people and the bride the world faces forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward only a prophet could put it like this not a politician but a prophet could put it like this and he says the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize her position in the word and then she's in Christ and and will put her in her place no National Force we'll do it but the National Force will drive Israel to her the Homeland National forces will will to the church to the the Council of churches will drive every organization but the power of God that's right will raise the bride into Glory I like that it's not up to a man it's not up to governments God's in control of this whole thing now when we think of that 40 different writers under the same inspiration come on of God himself writing his word yeah not one word will f to the ground heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away then he would say it over and over again these are the true sayings of God now if we can just say this tonight Moses played his part John played his part sometimes in these writers as they begin to write the word they're in strange conditions yeah you you would think that he's going to write the Book of Revelations might be in a posh office or somewhere another but let's pick a different place I'm going to put him in the worst prison that there is on an island right and I'm going to put him to where that none of the other prisoners are going to know what's going on they're going to try to ball him with a but I'm going to I'm going to allow him to write the most powerful scriptures cuz there's a bride that's going to come and play the music out amen I as I think about these things I I kind of amused when I was a young man they they sent me I was one of two in the state of Virginia and then about a hundred students from all over the United States were gathered and we were gathered and we were part of a special class and and they they took us to two different Symphonies well I'm a country boy putting up py cows pigs and and I find myself in a in a symphony all right blue jeans button-up shirt it was requirement button-up shirt and so I I wore that I didn't understand why I was there and musicians it was a national National Orchestra and so musicians are brought from all over the world and and there's a guy comes out with a stick and each one comes to their place and each one does what they're supposed to do and everything's brought to order I'm sitting in an audience of maybe 10,000 people and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking why am I here well you're going to be the benefit bit of why I was there all right and to get the point I had to go to two of those and then I went to a a a play there in Washington and I can remember the name of the play much a do about nothing and that's what it was much ad do about nothing you know I was raised in the message but you know I didn't catch it much just being raised in the message I I knew God sent a prophet and and uh one of the worst fights I was in in a bar was somebody told me brother Brandon wasn't a prophet it wasn't a good day for that guy just wasn't a good day I wasn't converted but you remember those days brother Wayne brother Tim escaped it but I won you know if you're going to fight win amen I'm sorry sister Connie and then as I begin to study the message you know brother randam has preached the message the book has become open the most important word that's ever been delivered to a body of Believers and then he becomes down in in Shalom and and he and he and he makes mention of it in many other places but especially in Shalom because the message is more than just to be in tape form and more than just to be in book form but it's to be living in flesh and we're more than just a group of Believers that have gathered and and we sit and say amen and and worship the word but this word's got to come to life so brother R begins to say he said his word is like a great Symphony and he said how many of you ever heard of syph and he said well everybody has has everybody had and he says now remember a symphony is when music is played in a drama he said I think of that Symphony of Peter the wolf and you remember that old Story how they used to and I've heard that how they take the drums and a little woodpecker pecking and Peter going out and growling of the wolf and and a and a toting of horns a symphony so so you begin to look at what a symphony is made up of and it's more than just one piece of music or small pieces of music but sometimes there's as many as 300 different pieces of music that has been gathered they'll have blind auditions and if you can just let me bore you for a moment but they'll have blind auditions for for a certain part when there's availability and and they'll send out not just to the local community but all over the world because we've got to have the best of the best yeah and there'll be flute players and trombones and there'll be drums and there'll there'll be all different kinds of instruments and you got to remember that there's got to be practice involved and and you got to have just lay down everything of your background and now when you begin to come together you've got to know what your music says right right and you got to study that music and to study the music you've got to go back can study maybe Beethoven or Bach or or the son of man Ministry you've got to know it you've got to believe it it's got to become a part of you and you got to you got to play a certain instrument that reflects you and because everybody's got a part every one of you's got a part all over the world we got a part from the littlest to the greatest every one of us has got a part to play and actually your body is an instrument through which God wants to breathe [Applause] through he wants to take your life and and sound the music of the message now you got to understand just a little bit in it you got to understand that you know there's certain there's certain portions of the Sheep music that that you've got to play exactly right now you can't give it personal interpretation now you can't come along and say well I don't agree with this part of it now no the music's got to be played all the way through and on and you've got to you've got to come to a place that that you realize that this is a masterpiece somebody much greater put it together so let me just say it like this if you were in the days of Beethoven you wasn't looking for his imperfections but he is known as the greatest writer that there's ever been as a matter of fact in those days if you read it much they actually even forgot some of the old they just had to let it go past because they had moved and I'm quoting words into a new dispensation of a greater writer Luther was great and Wesley was great and isua was great but we moved past we have much Advanced now we don't do away with that but we much [Applause] Advanced Now understand it quickly you you you you got to get it it's got to become part of you and there's certain quotes or certain scripts or certain pieces of the Sheep music that's difficult when you first start out come on but you just keep playing through it cuz you know when you arrive for the symphony you got to be able to play your part are you with me now whether you play the the little the little uh triangle whatever you do every part is a part that is so important everything's got to be right on tune now remember the director brother Brandon said has to get in the spirit of the composer now you know sometimes you come to church you come to a meeting and you maybe be expecting something much different than what you get but the Holy Ghost right is anointing your pastor and all of a sudden he's in your kitchen come on and maybe he's examining the fluk planing come on and he's trying to help you with the little beats of the music because this isn't a Sprint this is a journey life is not a steady picture it's a moving right and you're going to you're going to go from growth to maturity and there's things that you're going to catch as you go along are you with me now now remember there are some principles you got to understand nobody can take your place and you can't take nobody else's [Applause] place are you with me now so we would understand that in a symphony there's four major movements there's a movement of that's at first it's it's a quick movement and it's quick and it catches the audience and and it's just bouncy and it's just shouting and it's just praising the Lord and then it'll come to a different movement in the second movement to where it become more quiet and it'll begin to steady you and it'll it'll begin to tell a story and then it'll go in another movement and then other people of the orchestra will begin to play now at first everybody's playing but now maybe just half of them's playing and that guy with that stick yeah yeah he is standing there and he's so excited yeah as he so excited he's watching over this this group of people that have been gathered from all over the world they have been gathered there maybe they've had some auditions and maybe they've went through some practice but today they've got 10,000 people watching they pay good money The Whole World's watching this bride com to formation as a matter of fact Heaven is expecting you oh what a day it will be when you march into that land it'll be more than the vision of a bride marching all in her National Guard but we'll be marching in our new bodies singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wret like me angels will stand and watch you as you begin to walk in because you played the music well now let me just give you some principles there's a dress code for the men we're going to wear tuxi edos for the ladies were going to wear a very nice dress and look like ladies yeah Hey listen this is National this is what they if listen if they people fuss about a dress code come on they're going to have wonderful attire everybody's going to have the same color everybody's going to look right yeah everybody's going to be very attentive yeah the decisions are final now we've got our we've got our group together it's not going to be somebody walking in off the street playing a banjo come on driving a point right there nobody accidentally is going to be in the [Applause] bride and we come prepared we come whether it's Washington DC or llama or bluon we've come to this meeting prepared and we come prepared we're responsible for the music that we're sitting here to listen to we're ready to play our part we'll be courteous to our colleagues sitting beside of us don't tune up too loudly there not a place to chat I'm actually reading the rules here don't have too many comments to your neighbors remember there's a leader yeah and there's first chairs and the first chair has been chosen and everybody else down the line is complimentary yeah they're complimentary to the first chair yeah we're all one great big unit I love this next one leave your arrogance and attitude at [Applause] home it says it I could blow it up for you it says it leave your arrogance and attitude at home this is not the place for your personal [Applause] story our mission is to make the music come to life sir feel like you're going to have a good time amen so here we've come and we've we've got our we've got our music setting before us every one of us has got a backstory every one of us has got a backstory that's maybe yours is not cancer or heart attacks or sugar diabetes that you're fighting but that's not the important part of your story I'm in debt brother onon it's not the important part of your story all the fluff of my life is not the important part of the story All the Troubles that you've went through listen when you come to play the orchestra we don't know nothing about that come on come on I hope you get that just now brother Ron but this is blindsided me and this has happened in my life and this has happened in my life that's not the important part here this is only temporary you're passing through you're just passing through get up off of the canvas if you fell down get up don't lay there get up I heard him say last night God's a god of Second Chances and third chances and fourth chances and fifth chances and sixth chances seventh chances that's the god that we serve he saw you before the foundational world it's not what you're looking at it's what he's looking [Applause] at but that one fell and that one fell and that one walked away listen that's not the important part I'm sorry people has has done wrong by you I'm sorry that you've you've been hurt get up God will never fail you when seated the orchestra is full of people that have problems it's full of people that have egos and want to be and want to be that but God brings us together and puts us in a certain [Applause] order our responsibility just just play the music prise God I'd like to say that this is a place that we could have a rock dropping party right you know Jesus had one yeah come on Jesus had a rock dropping party yeah and they brought a woman yeah to him that was caught in idolatry yeah because they were following Sheep music of another day and this woman should be stoned because she's been caught in a adultery right well they brought her they brought her to the right man yeah and he and he simply said that he that's without sin right cast the first stone and he began to ride on the ground and the woman was looking down and when Jesus was finished after a bit he could hear the Rocks dropping It's a Wonderful [Applause] sound could hear the Rocks dropping and they were dropping because no one was worthy to throw a stone now every one of us are guilty we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God none of us we hang our wings up in the back and we come into church all of us need more of God I think we could all say that all of us need more than God now sure we've probably got some pretend Angels or self-righteous people that's in the building but you just keep playing the music you're going to come to a rough spot it's called humble thyself short message but you just you just read it eat it and and it'll help you it'll bring the you into it that's it'll take your ego and crush it for a little [Music] bit Hallelujah so so what we do is we come to church and you know the devil the devil can lock Donald Trump up and he can have all kind of Gossip magazines yeah and he can have all kind of targets beer joints and all kind of brothel and all kind of false churches but isn't an amazing one of his greatest tactics is to get people to fight one another that's that's because because that hurts when it comes from a brother or sister yeah I find it amazing that people can come and listen to an hour and a half sermon and not remember anything that was strategically important but they remember a blooper I spoke a sermon the other day at home and I used one of brother Tim's quotes I I thought it was incredible and I heard brother Tim say it a lot of times but maybe not from the pull pit but he would say sister Karen he said I wouldn't take a million dollars for her but I I wouldn't give you a nickel for another one just like her I made that statement about sister kany work good for brother Tim and before I got home nobody said what a good quote that you made and you was really in this portion but brother Ron would you call Sister Connie a nickel come on by back on back on Focus we hear Beethoven his music you might find it odd that I really do enjoy that kind of music I enjoy it kind of relaxing amen when I'm going through a a test on my brain or test on my lungs or whatever and I'm in those tubes for two and three hours I I enjoy those I enjoy music in my ears all right I don't want rock music in my ears but everybody can appreciate the masterpieces of his music yeah but they can't they have a lot of trouble looking at his life because his gift drove him crazy right and as it got further along the way he became he became a man so isolated and he became came deaf to where he couldn't hear his own music and that was his life being able to write music and and so instead of allowing the flaw to destroy him and never being able to write again he cut the piano legs off and he would play with his ear on the floor used to be he was able to go to the parties and enjoy company and hear the people tell him what a great music that you've done and here all of the musicians play their part and you're talking about a an individual that that listen to the key notes of when this one's supposed to play and when that one's supposed to play and when this one is supposed to did it come in just right and he enjoyed hearing his music come coming to life but it drove him into an isolated spot to where that now he couldn't sit in the auditorium but he would go behind the scenes and put his ear against the wood so he could feel the vibrations and hear the music being played and only then could he get proper satisfaction that his music was was coming to life scars difficulties he would never know how great of of a writer or composer that he was but it takes the right kind of a director that will catch that inspiration and not interpret it to make his own kingdom or yeah his own churchianity are you with me we've had another Master coming this age and we were told you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of [Applause] man are you with me that man wasn't to be worshiped like God but God lived on the inside of him and listen we as ministers and we as people we want to bring this message to [Applause] life and maybe it was just another song for a lot of places where he was preaching in Street Porter or in in Yuma Arizona or in Jeffersonville but it's our sheet music and maybe there's hundreds of thousands that listen to it and walked away and said it's nothing for me but we heard the word yeah we heard the word and it was our life this is more than just coming to church this is more than just sitting in a Pew this is more than just dressing the right way it's life pulsating through us and we're more than passionate about this [Applause] word amen amen amen it is said that Charleston hon when he played Moses he so studied the character of Moses until he began to become lost he lost his own identity yeah and after the Ten Commandments was played and now months after Charleston hon is off of the seen and nobody knows where he's at but he spend some time in a sanatorium wow to try to figure out who he was I pray tonight that we can so lose [Applause] ourselves yes sir amen it's not the great preacher not the great man it's the great God right amen and he spent time with the word to the point to like Paul could say I'm a prisoner you're talking about a compliment that he could say I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ if you're looking hard enough you'll see the backdrop of a man I thank God that brother br told us about his shortcomings had it not been for the grace of God he would have killed five boys he'd have been a boxer he'd have been a bootlegger that's he may have taken a million dollars but God rich in Mercy why' you say that brother Ron because many of you have been offered different things in your life young people you'll be offered many things in your life to pull you off course but you keep your eyes on the sheet music You Keep Your Eyes On Jesus Christ that's right Humanity may let you down but you keep your eyes on Jesus he will never never never never never never never fail [Applause] you amen brother Tim and you as a boy sitting and on the wings of a snow white dove sitting watching brother brandom operate no doubt not understanding everything that's going on there going to be raised up in a home to which it'll be one of the first homes of royalty to where that the message would be read and and played there in your home you know there's no way that you're ad adversary could see where you'd be today that's right no way but there was places along the road he would have liked to made you offers he would have liked to made you offers Timothy the same thing brother Timothy the same thing made you offers brother Wayne he'd like to made you offers he'll make all of us offers that try to pull us off of course but we found ourself in Jesus there's a lot of things that we could have been but we surrendered oursel to God now God's no debor to no man sir he's no debtor to no man are you with me now he's the best Banker he's the best lawyer if you put him first he'll help you find your mate right he help you find your mate he'll watch over your children when you can't watch over your children if your home's in proper order playing the Sheep music come on your home will be blessed because of the presence of God that will be in it now you know if you're many times we have visitors come in maybe we have some today and when the symphony is playing it's if you don't understand the Junctions or the story that's going to be told it just sounds like a bunch of Racket yeah but for those that are interested that's right those that are playing and they come to their part and now they do their best at their part it's my time to say amen amen It's My Time to Say Amen it's my time to surrender my life it's my time this is what I'm living [Applause] for my cousin played in the National Symphony so I have some insight she played the flute about that instrument about that long and she played well that's about all the size instruments she could handle cuz she was 4 fo8 our family had a lot of height in it bless her heart she was a beautiful young girl and I had a difficult life and cancer took her and took her away and she was just incredible and I asked her one day we were we were together and I asked her I said what's the greatest moment of a symphony can I just talk to you just a moment she said you know we would get the the music that we're going to play at the next Arrangement and I would play it and I would play it and I would play it and I would play it I would play it until I could find no imperfection in it cuz I wanted to be exactly right she said but the greatest thing was once we were assembled and we took our spot we didn't know who was sitting beside of us all that was elected all that was elected they had gathered us we didn't gather them they had gathered us and and we had studied the music until it was just right right and you know it would come our time to play and we would play but as it gets toward the the end of it to where everything is just blowing up she said we could hear all of us playing at the same time and the atmosphere was so elevated on all of our hard work all the tolls we forgot all about the difficulty of life she she would stand there and she would just kind of go into another realm she said forget about my divorce and forget about the difficulties of things that I have to face on dayto day I just forget about fighting dancer when the music was playing and I could hear the music playing and I became absorbed in the music amen could we lose oursel now now remember you got to stay with the sheet music one day I was working and I was a chimney sweep long ago I don't know if you remember that but when I first came here in '94 before I was a chimney sweep yeah I went to a lot of homes I went to I went to Little Homes I went to mansions and sometimes I would I would kind of I'd kind of be a little bit judgmental about who I was working with and could they afford to pay me or not and I went to a home that was built in the 1700s the old guy was he had real straggly long hair had a dirty t-shirt on and had pants that was seemed to be falling off and they were just raggedy and and he had a lot of work to do and he's telling me what he wanted to do to restore restore the chimney and and to cover it and making it good and you know he said I want you to give me a bid on doing all of that I said okay but as as I was putting the bid together I I thought you know I don't know if this guy can afford it yeah and so you know I'm being honest not trying to be judgmental but at the end of the day I want to get paid right yeah yeah Mark you know how that is you work a week you want to get paid for a week and right and so I I asked him questions you know he began to talk to me how he was going to do the plaster and he was going to do all the work on the ceiling and how he was going to redo the lights and how he's going to do the brick work out front and he told me he said uh there's a walkway that's supposed to be here I'm going to put that walkway back and and uh I'm going to properly restore it like he said when you're done he said going grab all the contractors and bring them together and we're going to have a party on a certain day and show you what it looks like once it's fully restored and I said well I I'll be honest with you I got quite a bid here I said uh I I want I want to make sure to be paid for I said what do you do he said well I'm a restorer I said really he said yeah I'm a restorer I restore art he said you like to see it I said yeah he pulled an old curtain back and we walked into his Studio there and he had a piece of work that was sitting in front of me and I recognized the name at the bottom of it van go wow I couldn't say it well but there it was now he said this is what I do you do what you do and I do what I do and he said so I will study the artist and I will study the paint and I will study the canvas and I'll study everything and and I have to make sure that the brush is exactly right yeah and then I have to study the artist of how he would do The Strokes right right and so I ask him I said well why is that important he said you see if I would make the wrong stroke I'd Mar the Masterpiece right I said what's that one worth He said oh it's worth millions he said really it's not a price that you can put on this piece of work and I said so what does a fellow like you get for touching up and he said for this piece I get a million dollars wow yeah I'll do the work [Applause] brother Ron you've took us down a journey listen even as directors we got to make sure that we're in the same attitude just because it's a quote we got to make sure that we bring it to life and it produces the right [Applause] thing because there's going to be thousands of lived voices and they're going to be in Jeffersonville and they're going to be in Lia and and the same Holy Ghost is going to be in Lima as it is in Jeffersonville and in Virginia and in [Applause] Louisiana it it can't be pastors with their brushes go just anyway we got to make sure help me now we got to make sure that we're catching the inspiration of it that it's the same life that is living how important how important is one service come on yes how important is one service for you one service was a nice Greenhouse a brother at my church wonderful man been in our church since in the 70s and he sits and he passes away that service wow passes away we St step down to him and we just simply call him by name and pray for him he comes back to life and here's what his statement was three days later what if IID have missed service wow wow what if I have stayed home and he loves to mow grass listen loving to mow grass is a wonderful thing yeah right how many lovers that we have to mow grass here amen well somebody go Mo mow his grass I was away preaching at a meeting and I came from downstairs to upstairs and the lovely couple was sitting there and you know I could tell that there was a tiff in the room you know you know when there's a tiff yeah listen these people fell right out of Heaven it must have hurt when they landed but they're having a tiff and I were eating cereal and finally I look across at him and I said well had a nice night I did I said what in the world is such nice people arguing about today what could be so important we're getting ready to go to church I'm going to preach they have spent a week fussing about how the grass was mowed it should have been in diagonals and B backwards and forwards and and look like a golf course on come on you look like you're guilty sister Faith let him off just let him off a little bit it it'll be all right hire somebody hire somebody to get it [Laughter] done now think about this here's two people that are going to step they stepped out of Heaven into time I haven't left my subject I'm just catching you they've stepped out of Heaven into time they spent their life together probably at that time about 45 years together they're our buddies they're a Heavenly couple but they've spent a week wow give it another week and you can Remo it [Applause] it's like a bad haircut don't fou too bad about it you'll get another one in two weeks now in the new world in the new world you get one did I just catch you sometimes it's absolutely much a do about nothing drop your rock yeah drop your rock but brother Ron I I you know I wish I was different I I I wish I could sing different I wish I could clap my hands different I I I wish I was more gentle I listen God made you when he was molding the Bell come on he put certain certain elements together to make you like he wanted you to be and he knew in your grab bag of Life there was going to be certain things that you were going to have to overcome he didn't pick it out for you now he left it there for you to [Applause] overcome he left it there I wish I could lose I wish I could lose weight I wish I could do this I wish I was listen I'm the perfect weight amen I'm just a foot and a half short brother but brother Ron that's listen I want you to preach me something spiritual I am come on right I don't know if you're getting it or not all we want to hear Seven Seals and seven Thunders I'm talking about you Amen Brother David iers came to our place and preach for us he's from Belgium and I get brain fog and so I have a lot of help so anyway I uh he had preached preached a masterpiece you know and after service we came home on a Sunday and and he was talking about he loved the saxophone I told him I was working working in this this thought vein and he says you know I've always played the saxophone he said but there's one saxophone I want to get it's a master builder in Belgium and what he's did is he's took from the scripture were that they took things of war and they made it for instruments of praise and worship and they melt down the brass and they take the wood and they take all of the pieces and now instead of being articles of War it becomes worship unto God and he said probably in my lifetime I'll never be able to afford such an instrument but he said it's a dream of mine well he told that to the right people because when he went home we gave him money to the dollar of what that thing was worth wow we had no idea but now that's not sitting in a shop and it's not a dream anymore or it's not a one day I want to be or if I can only hang to it but now he can play Amazing Grace how sweet the Sounder down from his glory ever living story and the music fills the room now no doubt the average person sitting in the building has no idea of the dream and the impossibility of that ever coming to past but they're sitting listen to the music the world don't know where you're at they don't hear the message like you hear it they don't set in Heavenly places like you said in Heavenly places but they just know that you don't cuss you don't tell dirty jokes on if there ever was a Christian you're the one maybe the only one in the school the only one on your job brother Ron sometimes I don't feel like my life is important really there was a girl that was talked about earlier and it's in my notes she laid nine years thought her life was hopeless but she didn't realize that her name would be synomous with some of the greatest Miracles that there would ever be and if you'll notice she was on her way when she was molested to piano lessons but when the miracle happened she didn't have to go to lessons she had laid there nine years and she' got a hold to some Sheep music and that Sheep music wasn't in inspired word to an inspired seat and it was what she was looking on it didn't matter all the unbelief that was around her that was trying to crush her dreams trying to crush her vision but that word was bringing it to life how could she ever get a prophet to come and pray for her let me just say this your impossibilities are very real with God I'm going home next week to baptize a man three months ago he was sitting in church as a matter of fact he had argued with his wife that was now coming to our church they would never want me tattoos have been a drunk since he was a boy wow had a very scarred life somewhere in that hotel room he decided Well I'll go with you and that night he found himself so inspired by what was being said it was more than a story it had more than historical value amen but he couldn't believe it as he was running to the Altar and the drugs was smelt on him and brothers that were praying for him felt like that they were getting high but God rich in [Applause] mercy God rich in Mercy let me just say this to you young people maybe you haven't had a birth it hasn't become real to you yet if you ever meet him one time if he ever walks to your Pew one time and you invite him and say come to where I'm sitting at I'm not worthy for you to come to this place he'll do what he did for blind Bard and mes you'll never need another cni lamb you'll never need another alcoholic beverage you'll never need your smokes anymore you'll never need the drugs to make you high and all that has crinkled up in your life all that has been so destroyed thank you let me just say this to you I'm not even interested in your history I don't need to hear two hours of your going through the good old times because they wasn't good right but I'll tell you if you can get in these prets in 5 minutes time amen but brother Ron they would never have me in the orchestra why are you here W don't you ask yourself why are you here who gathered you the devil sure didn't bring you to church brother Ron but you'd never have me in church okay can I can I have just a couple more ones there was a woman that Jesus went and visited and she had five husbands no Church would have her but you see once in Jesus's presence she'll no never go back there again the woman that was washing his feet and they said if he knew if he only knew who she was if he only knew and in just a moment he forgave her brother Ron I knew my past well let me just give you a real good example Rahab Amen brother a I've thought about this over and over again yeah I will guarantee you one thing once she marries salmone yeah he didn't let nobody call her the Harlot hallah Hallelujah nobody had a license to call her the [Applause] Harlot she was now Queen she was now his wife and our accuser that comes before God and says if you only knew them if you could remember them and God says that's my wife I have redeemed her I have paid for her the blood has been applied the token is over their life even being God I don't see any FAL or [Applause] failures thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord you probably have heard this story but there was a great search in the early 1900s of who was the greatest singer on the earth and they came to the point to where that they didn't choose anybody in New York or in California but there was a man in Chicago there's a black man and nobody would want him in their Halls to sing so he felt rejected and he would walk miles to the Deep trash pits and he would go down in the trash pits and when he got to the bottom of it he would start opening up and he would sing and let his gift live and he would in those trash pits he could hear his voice echoing back to him and he was releasing his gift and he thought no body could hear him but you can't keep a secret and they knew if people knew that if he knew they were there he wouldn't sing right and as it would be there would be up to 10,000 people would gather on the other mounds of those trash pits to listen to the greatest voice and he didn't even know they were there wow as a matter of fact the story has said that to where that he went to his grave not knowing he had such a phenomenal audience I've just told a story about you that's right I just told a story about you am you think you're singing in trash pits and all of Heaven has gathered amen amen amen can I give you one more story if that one didn't get to you and I promise you I'll quit David David had an incredible friend his name was Jonathan and he loved Jonathan they made bonds together it greatly grieved David that the family was destroyed yeah David became a king to where that it was the richest king in history go was a standard everything was just wonderful he was now not a Shepherd boy but he was King yeah and he had a palace like no other Palace but there's something that was missing yeah he thought it if I can search out if one of Jonathan's family is still alive I'd like to bring them to my Palace I'd like for them to live not as a poper but as a king's child but he too had a story when the invasion was taking place the nurse that was taking care of him yeah fell out of the window broke and crippled this boy I'm being a boy he would live with that scar all of his life right literally in Exile yeah because he thought the world was against him yeah right I'm finding you now if you're living in Exile come on a king's table's waiting on you amen I have to say it must have been some sort of a day when David's Chariot showed up come on Amen the most beautiful horses men of great Renown stood there and for a moment he thought this is my last day on Earth they finally found me come on yeah but instead of death I want to tell you instead of death there was commission to bring you you may be living in an exile you may be living in poverty you may have very handicapped in your life and you may have a lot of excuses but the king wants you at his table amen I can imagine as David's children would gather at that long table where he would sit at the top of it and sit there they would come in and all their Shields and armor the best clothes that you could have and they would come in but today there a new guest yeah it's a different sort of sound yeah clo feet is walking down the hall yeah yeah this is his first day it's his first day and he's walking but this is not going to be the end this is the rest of his life and he's stumbling down the hall and there's a place for him at the table amen now you know there's something about the king's table yeah yeah you may be handicap down here come on but when you slip your feet Yes amen up under the table Yeah your imperfections came can't be seen no [Applause] more you came to the building and you may be sick there's a Healer in the house you came to the building and you're lost there's a Healer in the house he's just waiting for your music to play on the music of your life amen it'll be wonderful when you're sitting there and you hear all over this building Echo and your voice is with them and your voice is blending in with hundreds of others and you realize I'm home amen amen but this is only the beginning from all over the world we're going to gather and oh what a masterpiece of an orchestra that God has gathered all the way back through the ages he's gathered musicians amen I'm just glad I can say I'm one of them amen we heard him say last night that we need Divine Healing you know sometimes when you're 21 years old may not be as important to you but when they tell you you've got brain cancer you know those lungs that got healed in that meeting many years ago yeah even the doctors testified today if your lungs wasn't so strong the cancer would have done eat them up wow isn't God good isn't God so good I want you to think about the what ifs fell off of a house and they told me I'd never walk again come on burned and they said I wouldn't live right they told me just a few years ago and the doctor walked in and sat down about 11 o'clock at night and I listen I love doctors I really do if you think that if you got something against a doctor you you're not reading the right Quotes come on now you don't need them if you're a racehorse but if you're sick you need a physician Jes Jesus taught you that am my wife was asleep laying on the bed just across the way the doctor walked in sat down on my bed and she began to talk to me about what was my mission in life and I begin to talk to her about Jesus she had came to tell me that I had four months to live and you know what happened I wound up praying for her [Applause] all the doctors that I see they say you're a miracle thank you Lord one doctor sat with me the other day and he said brother Ron do you ever have anybody tell you because you're taking chemo that you're not a miracle I said you know I do I do that makes an excuse for people with unbelief he said now Ron I want to tell you you've lasted longer than anybody else that we've ever had with brain cancer and lung cancer on the kind of chemo that we're giving you and after a year you're supposed to be in a wheelchair wow and and he said most people in here don't know who sick you or your [Applause] wife isn't that a [Applause] compliment now I want to check your unbelief do I look like I've got cancer do I look like I had a massive heart attack only a few weeks ago do I look like that sugar diabetes is trying to eat me up then God say healer he's a Healer he's a Healer I don't care what you're going through if you haven't seen a miracle lately look here right amen amen look here I didn't ask for none of these things right but I just choose whenever the next obstacle come I keep getting [Applause] up that guy is in my ear encouraging me almost every day keep going brother Ron amen amen praise be to God we need one another now that doesn't sound like too much of a a prayer line service but it really was amen because we've got ministers here that play a part of the sheet music and it says to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and all we know is we do what he says and it really doesn't matter the condition because the background music don't matter Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for our transgressions yeah amen every service has a miracle in it everyone everyone now if you fall under the attitude that tonight's my night you see I I went to North Carolina last year and I walked into the service yes discouraged and I'm going to preach tomorrow night but I'm discouraged I you know when you're fighting what I fight you sometimes get tired yeah and your pastor was preaching and he waited till the last paragraph of the service to say brother Ron come stand up here on the stage and when you did you started preaching on though you're Afflicted you're not defeated amen he couldn't dare know what my inner thoughts were just like I don't know what your inner thoughts are right but I know a God that's a Healer I know how God that takes our questions and answers them in a moment you heard brother Tim say that about speak the word I had a call to come to UVA to pray for a girl that was going to die in just a couple of hours and I arrived as hour hour and 10 minutes drive and I arrived and she weighed 85 lbs and she was green to some of your shirts Wow 85 pounds she had been one of my biggest critics she had said awful things about me and her husband talked to me about preaching her funeral and I said you know I don't believe God spoke to me to come tonight if she's got a funeral right come on and I took her head and her eyes were rolled back brother Tom I I just spoke her name and her eyes rolled down look right straight at me and I heard her husband say she hasn't done that for days wow and I began to talk to her her name was Tabitha and I said Tabitha you've you've been against me for a long time but Jesus sent me here to pray pray for you weighing 85 lbs I begin to pray for our nurses were steuding at the end of her bed and her family was gathered and I prayed for her when I got finished it just came out tomorrow you'll walk down the hall tomorrow you'll walk down the hall it doesn't matter what the impossibilities look like come on Amen and the nurse said I I think you're I think you're confused she's going to die in a couple hours I said I didn't say it come on I didn't say it I can't make it happen are you getting me now I can't make it happen I didn't say it he said it they sent me pictures of her walking down the hall the next day prise God she got totally better she's totally was healed she went back to school for 4 years and became a nurse thank you Jesus thank you Lord and she's actually helped take care of me thank how you like those odds I'd like to say this to you he's all we need he's absolutely all we am I hope you've enjoyed the symphony amen thank you Lord hope you've enjoyed it how many has a need here tonight you just like to say brother Ron I'm honest before God I need a touch amen I specifically need a touch I need a touch sometimes it's life and death sometimes just marriage situations financial matters he knows how to touch Our Lives amen he knows how to minister to us if you got confidence in men of God God can use those men to play the music yeah to take Isaiah 53 and lay their hands on you and James lay their hands on you and you'll recover it's not a man it's God this can be your meeting tonight could be your Miracle amen you heard him say it maybe for another service it was somebody else's Miracle but tonight's yours amen could we bow our heads just a moment Heavenly Father we bow our heads to you now you've taken our thoughts lord it's you
