want to be remember them in prayer amen and um but we're we're thankful today for his grace and what he's give us and amen I have a a few things here from the book of Ephesians that we'd like to get into but just before we go to the word maybe we just bow our hearts with a word of prayer amen and I know you I know you have special needs today and I know he's a God that answers needs if we just bow our hearts let's just go to Him Father we're certainly honored to be here with your children and Lord the precious the precious blood that has purchased your children Lord and as we stand here to address them this morning I ask you for your mercy upon us Lord as we just Lord feels almost like a vibration just moving through the building Lord father just an anointing Lord where your children are gathered together and and Lord the power of your majesty is being honored Among Us and and Lord we just want to take a moment to thank you and to praise you for your goodness and Lord for all that you do for the breath in our bodies Lord for the ability to be here for this beautiful place Lord for all the provisions you've made Lord we give you thanks and honor this morning morning and Lord Jesus but of all of that together without you would mean nothing and Lord we invite you into your word now as we would open that door we ask you that you would move into this sanctuary in the word oh God and may Revelation strike hearts and lives and Lord may you minister to the needs but father as you walk through the building Lord there's special circumstances that need attention Lord and we're inviting you now Lord to come and take a hold of those things and move on the behalf of your children and Lord we ask you now in the name of our Lord Jesus we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles today we'd like to go to the book of Ephesians the first chapter amen and uh we're going to be looking here today in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 19 down to verse 23 amen um it's certainly good to see all of our visitors today and amen and uh we just want to uh take a moment here in the word uh we've been in this book of Ephesians for a few services and I'm I'm looking here at the end of this uh end of these verses and amen uh Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ or which he showed in Christ or he exemplified in Christ when he raised him from the dead and he set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places now brother Bram said when Jesus was on the earth they gave him the lowest name that could be given a man he said his name was the lowest it was mud he said it was he was a he was an outcast but when God set him he set him far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named now not only in this world but also in that which is to come and he hath put all things somebody say all things all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all God bless you as you could be seated this morning I want to continue uh this today on the book of Ephesians but if I would take a a subtitle so that you might uh hear my context today I want to talk to you a little bit about Satan under your feet Satan under your feet now we know here that the scriptures is is plainly telling us and I I want to make uh maybe just a couple of St statements here and not you you've heard them proved over and over but I just want to make a few statements to put them in your heart amen is that this Ephesians chapter 1 verses 19 down to 23 here what we're reading about and you could include of course 17 here but what we're reading about is you're reading about Revelation chapter 3 and you're reading about the the leoty and age and you're looking at the age when the church is exalted to the throne that's what you're looking at but to get into the throne you have to open your heart so he said behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man come unto me I will Su or reveal unto him and then the Overcomer shall share in the throne now amen now we know that that that God allowed Paul to tell us where we're going to be but sometime or another there has to be a people who actually move into those positions and I believe that that this generation I believe this is end time scriptures speaking to the church amen in the day we're living so when you look at the scripture here and it's saying amen that that they have set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places and put all things beneath his feet and we're looking at an age of authority when you uh read here with David uh with Paul and you see him talking about Jesus being at the right hand now these are powerful scriptures because if you were in the days of the Hebrews they were knowing these were Messianic prophecies concerning amen the son of David and David amen speaking of it in Psalms 110 uh they all knew that mezc was to be a son and he was to be up on the throne now according to scripture Psalms 110 verse1 the the psalm of David the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stols now y'all know uh some people took that out there and made two Lords out of it amen but if you if you want to just get a simple answer to that just go over to the prophet and he'll tell you the answer and he said what the answer to this is he said that Jesus was both the root and The Offspring of David he was both his root and his offspring that's so simple amen do you see then the Lord send the rod of thy strength out of Zion and thou shal rule in the midst of thine enemies and the people shall be willing in the day of thy power and in the beauty of Holiness the womb of the morning thou Hast the do of you for the Lord has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of melaz now now Paul is placing Jesus as this one sitting at the right hand of God now when you go to Psalm 16 there's another great Messianic prophecy here he said I have set the lord always before me in the eth verse because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh shall Rest In Hope for thou will not suffer leave thy soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption thou will show me the path of life and in the presence of Joy at thy right hand are Pleasures forever more now when you when you look at this and you see that these men are taking Messianic prophecies from the days of the Jew and placing them Upon Jesus amen excuse me I know none of y'all have been coughing so it'll be okay Amen in Mark chapter 16 you'll see that the Bible says here in the 19th verse so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and he went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs and wonders now when Peter in the book of Acts is preaching it's it's him that takes the book of Psalms and begins to apply this to Jesus many and brother let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David it wouldn't have been good to hear d uh Peter's sermon can you imagine a bunch of Jews who didn't believe that Jesus was the Messiah they just crucified him and here's a man he says see he's both dead and buried and his supper is with us this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up for Christ to sit on his throne and seeing this before spake of the Resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption now this Jesus hath God raised up wherefore we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and have received the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which you know now see and hear for David is not ascended under the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord set thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy foot stol therefore let all of the House of Israel assuredly no assuredly that God hath made this same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ my that was a powerful moment in life he's made this one you crucified both the Lord and Christ amen you see that's where where Thomas remember when he put his hands on him remember what Thomas said my Lord and my God amen he is both Lord and Christ and now in Ephesians chapter 1 amen it tells us Paul now is saying that he is set him at his right hand in Heavenly places Paul again in Hebrews 12 and verse 2 he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God in Romans chapter 8 Paul says it in the 34th verse he said it is Christ that died rather is risen again who is even at the right hand of God in Colossians chapter 3 and verse one Christ sth on the right hand of God Hebrews chapter 1 amen and verse three and he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high in Hebrews chapter 10 watch in the 12th verse but this man after he had offered the sacrifice of sins forever sat down on the right hand of God now isn't that powerful that Paul points out this man did this this man after that he had offered sat down at the right hand of God now why would Paul say this man because he's letting us know that there is now a man on the throne of God it's good to just say well he's on the right hand of God but if you continue to read you see that the scriptures tells us he is on the right hand but the right hand is only speaking of the authority brother bam said God's a spirit and he has no right hand amen but Jesus is the supreme authority of almighty God in Revelation Chapter 3 The Bible will de Clare to us that he has overcame and sat down on his father's throne and he is ensuing to the church that you do the same as I overcome so should you overcome and sit down with me in my Throne as I have set in my father in his throne so not only is he at the right hand he sits on the throne of God which makes him the supreme power and the Supreme deity of not just heaven but of Earth and of all things our lord Jesus has conquered death hell and the grave and there is nothing that he has not conquered he is the mighty conqueror he is the king of all Kings he is the Lord of all Lords he is supreme Majesty in the heavens in the Earth above all disciplines and dominions and Powers all things are subject unto our Lord Jesus Christ my When I See This knowing that God has done such things in our hour Amen to know that not only is see that but he wants to express that in Psalms 110 in the third verse it said the people shall be willing in the day of thy power I wonder how many of the people are here this morning the people of God are we the people of God come on I know I know it's hard people say well I tell you what that message Bunch they make their themselves the elite no that's where you're wrong we didn't do it God did it it's not the elite above somebody it's the class that God requires to put them in the top shelf somebody say well we should get among a better class of people there's not a better class of people the greatest class of the people in the world is the people that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's called a ye class of people yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me for I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age then God has a people on the Earth today that people was predestinated before the foundations of the world when we might as well go ahead and put it right in the face of the devil we did not save ourselves amen we did not asked to be saved but God who is rich in Mercy looked Upon Our Lives and he appointed unto us salvation by the grace of God because he loved us and we were his people Paul said in the book of Acts that he had God had people in the city before Paul ever got to the city so the reason Paul went to the city was to get to the people of God the same reason Jesus went to The Well of Samaria was because he had a child there and the same reason he will appear in the last days is because there is a people there is a bride that belongs to almighty God and he comes for those people I believe we are those people and I believe that's why the prophet said come out of her my people and I believe that this morning that that people is represented here and those people will be willing in the day of his power they will be willing for God to move they will be willing to allow him to use their lives to use their voices to use their gifts to use their bodies amen you can have a gift but if you're not willing I thank God this morning we had some singers willing amen I pray I thank the lord we had some worshippers willing amen willing to let God begin to move now the scriptures tells us amen that all power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him right then he says go ye therefore into all nations amen teach uh teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things what I have commanded unto you I am with you even unto the end of the world now we recognize amen that Jesus according to prophecy is to make a great Display of Power in the end time now I I could take scripture and prove it but I think you all been there amen there's a there's Prophecy in the Bible that tells us that there would be a great exhibition of power in the end time it would be a revealing of the son of man in his power is that right resurrection power is to be made manifest in the last days and there must be a body now when brother Ram done all of these Mighty things and and his his ministry Rose above all the Ministries in the planet when he was here amen when we seen all that thing here's brother Bam's answer to it it was not me I didn't do it I was only there when he did it and I love how he says it it was what I surrendered myself to amen it's what I yielded my life to amen what he says is he took a temporary resurrection and God borrowed his body you've heard him say it I'm so glad to loan him my body do you see something was happening but there had to be a will invest on the earth same ways if there's a television uh program playing and it's running in here you only know it's playing if you have a television playing the program otherwise the program could go right by and you never knew it happened the sending station sent it but the people never saw it because there was nothing to display it to them but in the hour when the son of man revealed himself from Heaven he didn't just send a signal into the Earth he had a prophet to catch the signal and display it by to the church and say to them that the Jesus who you buried in the Tomb 2,000 years ago is not dead he is alive and he sent a message to prove the power of the Resurrection in the end time it is a supernatural message to a supernatural people and I believe it I believe that that same logos amen that led the children of Israel is the same logos that embodied itself in the person Jesus Christ amen and that same logos has got a part here today that same logos the spirit of God the anointing the sanctifying grace of the blood he says he would brought many sons unto God which is Anointed by that same logos brother on the day of Pentecost it came down as a pillar of fire and broke apart and the tongues of fire set upon them not tongues but tongues of fire set upon each of them an elected selected group identified by this Pillar of Fire sh that God had separated into man do you get it the logos separating himself into man not God not in one person he said but he's in the church Universal the same logos isn't that powerful the same logos the same anointing the same Pillar of Fire now watch from Jesus the same yesterday today and forever brother bam says oh he has to be the same same attitude the same in power the same in everything but the physical body see that sets at the right hand of God but his spirit is here in us to manifest himself to take our lives and make it exactly what he said it was that's what he promised the Holy Ghost when he has come will testify me and show you things that are to come Amen brother B says see it's the same in every aspect except the Corporal body amen the promise of the end time now now watch in the day of his power the promise of the end time is not intellectual power it's not educational power it's not theological power the promise is holy ghost power come on Friends amen you know that the prophet said that it would be National Force that would put Israel in its Homeland it's there isn't it amen but what puts the bride in the body what puts the people in The Bride is the power of God it's the power of the Holy Ghost that's what puts the church in the Rapture put which are in the body it is a display not of Education it's not a display of formality it is a display of the literal life of Jesus Christ that he is not dead he is alive oh my Christianity in its rarest form Christianity is not a base of principles and and ideas and governments and religiosity it is a living being a personal experience with the god of the Old Testament that was known as Jesus Christ but the same spirit that raised him from the dead promised to come on the church and raise us out of every dead educational and Theological Seminary that they have buried the Lord in I think it's a return of power the power of the Holy Ghost that lives in the Church of the Living God hallelujah we're not dead but we are alive ready and willing now brother man said how can you say the apostolic age ceased see where do you get that how can a Vine come out of here and bear today and go out and bear an orange and then bear a pumpkin it would have to change its life and Malachi 3 said God changes not now if this Vine ever gives forth another Branch y'all know I'm in the message it'll have to continue the book book of Acts that was not the Acts of the Apostles friends it was the acts of God in the apostles and that same God is performing action in the church today to those who are willing to submit their lives to it I I I look at this and see brother Ram says it now now now now you you you have to see brother Adam he he brings things so beautifully sign of his coming 1962 brother Ram said what is it he said it's a body growing from the feet coming up most important parts of the body from the feet lungs heart on into the head who is the head Christ the intelligence how does a body move by the head and the government shall be upon what on his shoulders Isaiah 9 and6 right there's where the real true church speaks in power there's where Apostolic power returns to the church when the government shall be upon his shoulders how many knows what that means it means that the seals became open and released the headship of the word over the church which opened Apostolic power to return amen without denominational growth in it look at this amen the the brother Bram explains this now in the in the church age he said already visible manifestations of what I've been and telling you are seen all around this ecumenical move the tears is factual but also in fact the prophet of the last age must be bringing a message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord for by his message will his heart of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come a restoration of power isn't that beautiful a restoration of word means a restoration of power you cannot have the word of God and it not bring the power of God if it don't have the power of God it's not the word of God it's the word of some Seminary it's the word of some teacher it's the word of some idea but if it's the word of God the word has power in it power to manifest power to bring reality the word is a powerful thing the Holy Ghost you see do you know that the Holy Ghost was released 2,000 years ago but why didn't we see it manifest so openly up Through the Ages I'll tell you what a prophet said he said it's been bound for 2,000 years the Holy Ghost has been now nearly for 2,000 years under marm back there under the church ages it's not been at the river of Euphrates it's been bound at the door of Creeds and dogmas and the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said amen look now watch amen you bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas do you realize doctrines that prevent the moving of the spirit are actually a Creed or a Dogma binding the Holy Spirit from moving now I I don't want to take too long in teaching just a moment but let let's just let's just watch this family traditions bind the moving of the spirit personal conflicts bind the moving of the spirit y'all know what brother Bram said you remember he said let somebody even move a pinky in the wrong attitude and it could G away the Holy Ghost y'all seen it where you sit in church and you know there's something wrong and you can feel it and that's not here I just God bless you it's not here this morning am hallelujah amen I love the Liberty I feel right now so don't think I'm amen but but but y y'all been there where there was a little snag in the spirit and it you it's it it would get up and then it'll do and you'll bring it up and then you'll bring it up and then and what that is is somebody's resisting they're UPS said at something they're resisting they're resisting in their spirit and what it is is like a binding of the spirit in the local church right so what so so the spirit's here the power of God's here same as it was last week are they going to be next week but the difference is it's bound from moving so what we see in a small measure in a church service was what was happening through the church ages when the denominations got together and offended the spirit of God by their doctrines and teachings and he was the only one not welcome in the church right so they bound him by Creeds and dogmas now brother BR says see the Holy Spirit has been bound by the denominations for 2,000 years notice we found out but there will be a day but there will be a day neither night nor day but he's talking about Zachariah the evening light shall come right now watch you again amen Feast of the trumpets the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message isn't that powerful with the restoration of word comes restoration of power amen doctrines bind the moving of the spirit but the prophet of God said but the end time message would loose the moving of the spirit watch what he said the the holy spirit is back in the church again Christ himself revealed in the human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it now what what are we dealing with amen what is it it's it's God bringing the word to releas the person of the word the end time evangelism we've had enough to join church and put our names on the book but in the evening time there shall come a great power of Christ would come upon his church just like it did there on the Eastern it is to be in the western the same that's why I want to speak on evening evangelism Queen of Sheba brother Bram said the Holy Ghost comes with power and manifestations and demonstrations of his presence then there would not be one cruel word spoke against any move of God we'd all be one in one Great Bend of Godly love that's what's going to take it for the church to go in the Rapture look what he said there'd be a there be a a gathering around the moving of the power of God watch this in great coming revival brother R said the sun done crossed over now of human theology by Church organization and domination he said it darkened things from the Christian's eyes see that's right it's darkened Divine Healing it darkened the power of God it darkened the gifts they've all applied it back there to where the Sun was shining see any any denominational teachings will always take you to the book of Acts for the Miracles and manifestations of God and they'll say see it happened back there and they'll prove to you it happened back there but the problem is is they want to leave it all back there or they want to say there's coming a millennium and then we'll have these things in the Millennium but the prophet of God said but watch the scripture see amen the same son that Shone in the morning is supposed to shine in the evening the same Sun that did it there is the same son is supposed to shine here he will not be shining in just immaturity but it'll be a shining strength of the power of God Amen what is it it's God returning back the power of God to the church the power of healing will return to the church the power of Deliverance returns to the church amen you know sometimes I I know even even people who are good people sometimes you know good good solid Christians are not getting their healing and I I was listening to a tape just the other day and I thought it was something cuz brother Ram's talking about it and I'm saying Lord I know the healing powers that why ain't some people getting the healing that they need and brother Bram said on and it's powerful because he's talking about predestination in Matthew 24 and he said Jesus spoke of the elect I said Jesus spoke of the elect he and brother man says yeah he spoke of them he said he said the the the Antichrist would be so deceptive it would deceive the very elect if possible brother said see he's saying the elect was there right the elect was there then brother Bram changed his tunes and he said but see amen there's the reason some people he says it's harder to receive healing than salvation he said because there was an election on your life and a strain of God that made you a Son of God isn't it something he said to the believer sometimes salvation is easier than it's healing amen and it doesn't mean you're not a son or daughter of God it's just your salvation was easier because it was a strain that come from almighty God I thought my goodness we already post that one on on the on the church chat or something I don't know I don't think we have one but but but you know it it should be got out amen amen to to let people know amen that God does still [Music] heal the church World clouds the the the power of God with her doubt it's still there but they hold a cloud of Doubt over the power of God can I just say this but the scripture says that in the evening time there shall come light watch how Jesus prophesies when he speaks of it in Mark amen the Bible said Jesus said I am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven look at the beauty of this amen and coming in the Clouds of of Heaven do you know he's prophesying of our day Jesus is talking about our day coming in the Clouds Of Heaven amen let's let's just look at Luke 22 and verse 69 Hereafter you shall see the son of man set on the right hand of the power of God in Luke 21:25 look at the beauty of scripture and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon this Earth and distress of Nations and perplexity of the seas and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing for fear and looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven to be shaken amen now the signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and distressed Nations do y'all realize amen that the signs they're talking about amen has been happening for years with eclipses and and with moon eclipse and Sun eclipses and and then that that's a yearly occurrence or every every few years we have these things over and over so he's not just speaking about natural eclipses this is not just dealing with the moon and with the sun we're dealing with church and power we're dealing with we're dealing with something it's it's it's a little bit different than maybe what the world would oppress it to but then the Bible said in the stars and upon the stress of the Nations now you're in the natural with perplexity and the seeds and ways roaring now watch this but the Bible said and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh Now isn't this beautiful cuz I I'm going to ask you where would you verse verse 27 where would we place that as a church all right because we know that over in the Book of Revelations it says that he's coming with a cloud and every eyes shall see him every tongue shall confess and they'll bow brother B said that's not the Rapture that's when he's coming to Israel right amen but do you recognize what happens in Revelation which is the coming to Israel every eye sees him is right here in Luke 21:27 but there's also something else in Luke 21:27 which is hid from you until you take it to other scriptures it's beautiful when you see that the Bible don't miss nothing when you look in the Book of Matthew 24 verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory look in Luke 21 it just says one thing but there's more things in that than what you read when you come to Matthew 24 you see there's two events wrapped up in one scripture you see that there is a cloud that appears to the Gentile house which is the sign of the son of man in heaven but after that then he'll go to the Jews and appear unto them just like he did for the church he will go to those Jews amen but listen here's what's happened people have looked at what's going to happen to the Jews and they have dismissed the power that has been given in the Gentile Church listen friends don't look for his coming his coming is upon us amen we are the manifestation of the power power of His coming and the age we're living in amen you preacher don't you believe we're going to go away absolutely but this world will never see it these people you're living with will never know it if you're going to display the power of God Amen it's got to be now then shall appearer the sign of the son of man in heaven now now if you go to Matthew 24 and 29 you can pick this up out of The Sixth Seal you you people that like to study these things are powerful it immediately after the tribulation of those days immediately after the tribulation of those days do y'all know what brother Bram says that is he says that's a pre-tribulation period under ikan it's not the tribulation the three and a half years this is happening in the 40s right this is World War II but look at this and the Sun be darken to the Moon not give her light do you all recognize there's two different times of eclipses there's the eclipse of the Sun but there's eclipse of the moon and and and I don't have time to get into all this but L just real real quickly amen if you have if you have the sun here and you have the Earth here if the moon gets between the two that's the eclipse of the sun right so you can't get the light of the sun you actually from the earth you see the Moon it got between you and God there's the church right it got between the church the people of God and the Son of God and the church got in the way Roman Catholic Church did that so what do you see if you see an eclipse what what what would you see in the moon do you know the moon actually turns red they call it a blood moon so when the Bible says and the moon shall turn with blood with red it's speaking of it's in the time of that Eclipse they're looking at the church look and it's in the it's in the way but if you're looking at the other direction amen the Earth gets between the Sun and the church which is what happened to the Catholic Church and it darkened them now I'm in Isaiah 60 darkness is upon the Earth and gross darkness is upon the people because the church was supposed to give light but instead of giving light what they did is they let the world and their technology and theology get between them and the power source and now the whole earth amen the Earth itself amen can't see the light of the Moon it can't see the light's not reflecting so the Moon is darkened and the Sun doesn't give its light what is it talking about it's talking about different events now there's been eclipses of suns and moons for years amen but it's not till a prophet gets on the scene that he says the pope just went to Jerusalem natural Church what's he doing he's putting the lights out amen what's he doing he's darkening the Earth amen for Satan's eeden he's putting out what little light was left in the church he's going to make an ecumenical council and push out the manifestation of the son of man so as it cannot ignite the church in the end time oh but to you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and there shall be light in the evening time there'll be a sunrise to the church amen they'll be able to say good morning Shalom and in the darkest time of all the ages they will have a light because there's a man here that can turn on the light he's returning in clouds of glory and in power it's not a cloud to darken it's not a cloud to place light or or or doubt upon the church we're not supposed to take the message and put a cloud over you amen we're not supposed to hide the resurrection power and the delivering power with our Theology and formality what we are ignited to do is to lift the clouds of doubt and to be manifest in the power of the word of God in this age the power of the son of man the word has [Music] returned the word see and then shall appear the sign of son of man in heaven do you know what happens in heaven before it happens on Earth so we've seen it now you said brother Wayne what about them Stars falling from Heaven questions and answers brother Brandon says actually he says that or he tells us this he tells us uh I'm in the wrong sermon there amen he tells us that over in the Christ the mystery he actually calls the fallen stars Fallen Angels Luthers Wesley said they didn't keep their first estate and when the stars fall from Heaven the moon don't give her light and the Sun is darkened but he cometh with power to see the sign of the son of man in heaven and why are we seeing the sign of the son of man in heaven because the sign of the son of man's coming to the Earth it's not just going to stay in the heavens the scripture says it won't for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and a voice and a trump of the Archangel this will not be something that happens outside of this Earthly bride brother if you could just put it off somewhere see if you could just put it off somewhere it'd be easier on us but this is coming to the church now brother bam actually ties directly great Pon of Revival 1954 he said You shall see the son of man coming in the cloud with a power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads your Redemption draweth nigh and over in the book of Zechariah the 14th chapter and the seventh verse it shall be known not day or the night but it shall come to pass in the evening time there shall be light so brother ties together Luke and Zechariah 14 for evening light now watch this brother bramman trying to do God a service he says see here it is there should be signs in the heavens above now he's talking about the cloud we got a picture of that cloud amen he's talking about the cloud they took the picture of there in Tucson Arizona amen now this this has actually been in scripture now if if you're a Bible student you know this this is Daniel the 7th chapter this is the Ancient of Days right if you're studying now you go to Daniel 2 and remember Daniel 2 there's a rock coming out of the mountain what's it doing coming against the kingdoms of the earth now in in Daniel 2 the headship Jesus is a rock coming out of a mountain in Daniel 7 the same kingdoms of the earth represented by different creatures but this time instead of seeing a rock out of a mountain he sees a cloud in the heavens yeah so the rock out the mountain the cloud and the heavens both are speaking of supreme authority over the kingdoms of the earth now watch this because the sign shall be in heaven above earthquakes in diverse places now he's placing it right there go back to the cloud picture there he says now the son of man the day in Luke the son of man will reveal himself again reveal himself and the world will look on Sodom and Gomorrah brotherr don't even be ignorant of spiritual things scay search these scriptures and then you think you have eternal life they are they which testify now what's what he's doing he's tying two scriptures in Luke directly together In This Cloud he shall a sign a son of man shall appear in heaven and at that day shall the son of man be revealed he's showing you the signs in heaven and the manifestation is going on on the earth what he showed in heaven was happening on the earth and it it was from this place that he goes back and says I am to return and preach the Seven Seals which restores the word to give the church full Authority and power it's the son of man in heaven now you say preacher what does this have to do anything it's because that the resurrection power of Jesus has been held in Gloom and in darkness but in the evening time he's promised there would come a light that these Seven Seals would re reveal the mysterious thing that was showed up in heaven Amen brother bam tells us of course immediately that this cloud is tied to Revelations the 10th chapter now if we just go over there some of you this very very um very common to you so a amen should be easy to you amen but this Cloud now to people that don't understand this your amen matters Right This Cloud was Revelations 10 in picture form you're seeing Luke the sign of the son of man in heaven brother Ram is telling us it's also Revelations 10 and he tells us that Revelations 10 fulfills Luke 17:30 is that right now watch what this day they took this picture across Southern United States and hangs in laugh Magazine see he declares it in the heaven before he does it on the earth now what happened on Sunset Mountain what happened up there of course the this is the Fulfillment of Revelations 10 it's the message fulfilling Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed now Revelations the 10th chapter watch the scripture in the first verse and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his face and as it were the Sun and his feet were as pillars of Fire the beautiful thing in Revelation 10 you said brother Wayne what does it mean I love how brother Ram says it this day this scripture is fulfilled we don't have to ask what it means anymore we have perfect interpretation to the word of God it already happened Hallelujah brother Roy Shrewsberry used to have a paper did you ever see it brother Roy they actually wrote brother brandom questions and answers and somebody sent it in to him and ask him brother brandham what about Revelations 10 when is this to take place D he flipped it over on the back side of the letter I read it myself on the back side of the letter it said it was already fulfilled when I was out there in tucon amen you see what he's saying is the Fulfillment you can read it and say well what does it mean but when brother bam says but it's fulfilled that's the answer to the question so what it was to bring was it was to open up the Fulfillment of Revelations 10 to fulfill scriptures before our eyes amen it was the mighty Angel descending upon the church amen in the day of his power he will have a body can I just say it like that amen the day when the headship comes he will have a body upon the Earth that will be willing to receive the headship of Jesus Christ when I look at this this Mighty angel coming down amen we can we can we can look at this a lot of ways but but can I can I just can I just say this very clearly without proving it to you but I think you know it's so good amen would help me amen that we are the body of Jesus Christ we we we are the body of Jesus Christ amen and we see here that his feet as are pillars of fire the feet is the body of Jesus Christ the body is in Revelations 10 it's not just the headship in Revelations 10 the body body is in Revelations 10 the seventh seal brought him back to the Earth can I say it she is him she is his feet she is his legs she is his arms come on Church we've read 100 scriptures he's got a body in the heavens but because he's there he has a body on the earth that is operating by The Same Spirit he's the bride he's a Heavenly bridegroom she is an Earthly bride and the headship was appearing there which showed the amen I I always love it when I show that I always love can you show that again that cloud picture because I I always love this part I I like to think about this that cloud setting there now I've always thought of this is wonderful that's the head it's a picture of the head where is the body see the body was already on Earth and this is only a sign that they're receiving headship amen the word was coming the word is in the church the secret is the word is in the bride look at this when you see this Acts chapter 2 now when you go back to the Bible this is this is and you you have to you have to I know that some people really know this and some people don't understand this so it's okay I'll just want to cover a couple things here some people thinks the Holy Ghost is a motion it's not some people thinks well the Holy Ghost is shouting or dancing it's some type of motion it's it's not now those things are effects of his coming by but the Holy Ghost is a person he's not the third person he is the person of Jesus Christ is that right and when Paul met him on the road to Damascus after his resurrection he met him in a pillar of Fire now let's see that light amen he met him in a pillar of fire and when he saw that mysterious light he looked at it and said Lord who art thou amen Lord the the fire above brother bram's head there he said Lord who art thou and the Bible said it spoke back and said I am Jesus in whom thou crucified I he says come from God and I have returned to God and Paul met him after his resurrection in a spiritual body now listen this is the Declaration of this age is that same Pillar of Fire that was in the days of apostle Paul is in the last days in The Bride of Jesus Christ listen I'm not making this up we have a picture Paul don't even have a picture of it but you believe it without a picture but God was so M man wanting you to see it so wanting you to believe it my critic took that picture I didn't take it brother Ray didn't take it our friends didn't take it the devil had somebody take it oh I wish I bet he wished he could take it back but they took it and that same Pillar of Fire that was over with Paul that was in the book of Acts has returned in this day and has been identified not as a ghost but it's been identified as the literal life of Jesus Christ unconquered by traditions and unconquered by man made theology he Remains the Same after 2,000 [Applause] years woo brother so preacher what does that have to do with me how many here's got the Holy Ghost this morning lift him up high now how many got the Holy Ghost in here this morning do you know what you received when you received the Holy Ghost you received amen this light brother Bram said a lick of this light came into you in Acts chapter 2 the Bible said that clothing tongues of Fire fill them where they were setting it wasn't that they spoke in tongues it was fire came in them where they were setting and when God got in them they had the same God in them that created the heavens and the Earth and we receive not another Holy Ghost we got the same Holy Ghost this morning that created the heavens and the Earth has come into our lives as a Creator and the power of God listen when I when I look back here brother Bram said that Pillar of Fire broke itself up and in blaz as clums went upon them and fire set upon them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost 120 of them I I don't mean to call people teach things so I don't think you're embarrassing but the Church of Christ actually teaches there was only 12 that could give the Holy Ghost I I had Aunt Church of Christ we had a lot of good discussions and I told her what you going to do with the Bible it said 120 got the Holy Ghost she said it don't say that I said yes it does and we sat down and took the Bible and we begin to read read the Bible I found out that some Churches don't teach the Bible they teach the people without reading the Bible and then the people walk away with an idea about scripture they've actually never even read but the Bible said 120 of them were filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke with tongues and gave utterance and they was so unseenly that they thought that they were drunk come on church but they had a new wine and you can't put new wine in an old bottle amen but God has sent some new bottles in this generation that is rering for the holy ghost power of almighty God y'all y'all know the scripture somebody my good well I'm going to preach y'all's okay I'm preaching look look somebody says to me well brother Wayne the new birth is without sensation look when Mary received but you but you're only taking part of the word you have a thought and you want to make that thought stick but but go to the Bible Bible the Bible said she said be it unto me according to Thy word but after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus she went to the upper room for herself and she got drunk and staggered in the spirit of God and brother BR said if Mary had to get drunk to get into heaven the Church of the Living God has got to get the same experience come on we're not going in on just a couple Creeds it's the power of the Resurrection that is coming to the church with the Holy Ghost and Power amen the pillar of fire has returned I salute the return of the pillar of Fire in My Generation I say open up the doors of True Word Tabernacle and let him come in open the doors of our heart let him come in he's welcome in the house of God and the absolute brother randam tells us this he says see we come together because each one of us is holding a part of God I'm about to get a shouting spell each one of us is holding a part of God you thought you was nothing every one of you is holding a part of God that's got the Holy Ghost and look at what brother bandam said and when we come together the pillar of fire is manifested in its wholeness no wonder coming to church feels so good when Church sets together in heavenly plac places then the fullness of the power of God is in the church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices brings the pillar of fire back again W brother brother randam says he separated himself in the pillar of fire divided himself among the People clothing tongues I'm just giving you a couple things to nail this down the pillar of fire again that God in Christ was the same person and here it is back as the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire has returned as the Holy Spirit ain't that powerful that's why I'm not scared of the Holy Ghost I know who he is the pillar of fire God in Christ the same person and here he is as the holy spirit in countdown brother Bram said the anointing is here with me now the angel the Lord the pillar of fire do you see he says now I I love this in Revelation chapter 4 he said whosoever will can have the same anointing of the shakana glory said preacher that's just for the preachers brother man said whoever whichever of you want it yeah can have the same anointing of the Shak Glory you preacher why because you have a strain in you as a child of God look at this the pillar of fire is brother bam said the logos the spirit of God he says brought many sons of God which is Anointed with the same logos the pillar of fire is not he it is his Spirit form and the son of man has now come to anoint sons of men to bring back the ministry look in the pillar of fire you say preacher where's it at I love it everybody looking for the pillar of fire where's that Pillar of Fire at you know what's beautiful and now y'all got to forgive me I'm just going to stay with the word okay I'm not looking for it I'm looking at [Applause] it you might be looking for it I'm looking at it said preacher what do you mean you're looking at it well uh it Happ it's beautiful we didn't always studying this but Brother Ray was just a hair uh late coming out I'm coming in the officer a couple of us is in front of him and brother Nathan text and said he was sick wasn't able to come and brother Steven said they felt bad and so Ronnie looked over at me he says well he said I know Steven and Nathan's out he said have you heard from Brother Ray and I said no I hadn't heard from him he said I wonder where he is and at that moment Brother Ray stepped in the room and I said there's your answer I don't have to tell you anything the man's here but what if Brother Ray hadn't stepped in the room and Ronnie would have opened the door and saw him in the hall and said to me he's here would I had personally had to saw him to identify him or if I trust the man that told me he was here then I would know he was here William brandom who fellowshipped with that angel said he's here and he's here in the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ I only see the veil you only see the veil but behind the veil is the same pillar of light that was in this picture Hallelujah the bride of Christ is the dwelling place of the almighty God the Tabernacle of Shak she is Tabernacle in deity don't you sell yourself off as some some little Backwater Bunch or some little sideways group you are the picture of the people that God has anointed of this age to carry Shak light into this age I say let your light shine before men that they may see the goodness of your father wow this Pillar of Fire this Pillar of Fire has anointed you until the prophet of God ties this to John in that day you shall know brother BR said in that day you shall know he said then this Church of the Living God is the anointed body of the Lord Jesus Christ so preacher why why then do we put all of the emphasis on Jesus being lifted to the right hand y'all y'all get done yall going to think I'm a Jesus only why you put all the emphasis because if it was for by one man we all fail Adam caused that fall but the last man Adam fixed it all one man explained it I thought it was powerful he said you got a bunch of guys on ski rope and you got seven of them or how many ever of them and he said a guy names Adams on the front and a guy named Adams on the back and he said the first Adam slips and all of them's connected to the Rope so they're all going down the slope but that last Adam gets a foothold and one man caused the fall and the other man stopped the fall well I tell you what that last man that Adam he stopped all the foolish he stopped all the things the devil did my Bible said he was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and one man destroyed everything the devil ever did against the church and Adam sold us out but Jesus Christ paid the debt that we might come back to Sons now C can I take this just for a moment just for a type you know your Bibles the Book of Joshua we're generation Joshua right the Book of Joshua do y'all remember the great Joshua chapter 10 when he spoke the word and it was in a great battle and it happened in the evening time do you see the correlation greatest battle ever fought in the evening time amen and darkness was settling in brother Bram said had Darkness settled in the enemy would reunite and they would have lost the battle he said but Joshua did something he used the power of the spoken word and made the sun stand still right and there were five major Kings in that battle that had come against Joshua and the Bible tells us they whipped them they whipped all those armies but God had them do something special with them five Kings he had them put them in a cave until all their abilities were destroyed and they were still Kings but they were powerless Kings they were still Kings but they were defeated Kings they were Kings but powerless and defeated and after the battle was settled after Joshua one and everybody who raying Joshua God told Joshua said you go back and get him out of that cave now and they brought five Kings out of the cave and laid them down before the men and the Bible said the captains of Joshua's Army was instructed to come and put their foot on the neck of those kings now watch something that's already defeated but God wouldn't leave it there you see God could have just said cut their head off and let's go but he didn't do that because God was laying a type in the scriptures that God God would defeat this Army through our Lord Jesus Christ and he would take their Chief Captain Lucifer and he would so whip him that he would destroy every ounce of power that he had but in the end time he's going to let the devil out of the cave but there's going to be a bride on the earth that'll put that devil under her foot amen every devil will become subject to the Bride of Jesus Christ I say it's time to possess our land and bring Satan under the feet of the church in the last days I don't believe God put you here Amen to be to be subject to no devil you say preacher what are you talking about can I tell you the Bible said he put all things under his feet I ain't got time to teach no more I got to preach now amen he put all things under his feet but that was the prophecy brother brother Howard Genesis chap 3:1 15 come at an appropriate time when everything was lost but God raised up and prophesied and remember what he said he said there shall be enity between thy seed and the woman's seed and he said the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent and that was a Messianic prophecy of Jesus Christ that he would destroy the devil and his seed now listen that laid in the scripture and even when Abraham heard the prophecy that thy seed shall possess the Gates of its enemy that Prophecy of the seed possessing the gates was the prophecy of the seed of the woman but now it had laid upon Abraham and his children because Jesus would be the real Seed of Abraham the super Seed of Abraham to possess every gate well when he was born to the Earth he wasn't born through Sarah or through Hagar he was brought through Mary by the spoken word right and in him was the life of almighty God now watch this because he lived upon the Earth amen and he was progressing in power and Revelation and authority and look he conquered over the grave amen when he raid Lazarus and he conquered over sickness when he healed the sick among them he told the DEA to hear he told the dumb to speak he told the winds to shut up and the waves to be still showing power over nature and creation right but sin nature itself still existed so it wasn't until we go to the cross that we see that Genesis 3:15 would be fulfilled and through the cross of Calvary Jesus would deliver a fatal Blow To The Head of Satan oh Church of the Living God there never was a day like that day I love how brother randam said he said that was the day Satan got his backbone broke that broke the backbone of hell when Jesus died at Calvary had he knew who he was had he knew what he was doing he would have left him alone but when he killed him upon Mount calvary's cross the prophet said Jesus reached out and got a hold of Man's enemy of death and pulled it into his bosom and he took the Stinger of death but brother when they put him in the grave it wasn't over when they put his body in the Tomb it wasn't over amen but while he was in hell he was fulfilling the scriptures that all things should come under the feet of Jesus Christ and the prophet of God said in the mighty conqueror that he went straight down to the devil's hell and he knocked on the door and he wanted the keys of death Hell In The Grave is that right so what did he do he reached in and took the key out of the hand of the devil that held every believer in this church oh Church of the Living God I love how brother Brown he's a Storyteller you know he said he wrapped on the door and Satan come to the door he said we f fin got the seed we finally got him but brother man said but here's the problem amen amen they thought they had him in Jacob and they thought they had him in Moses but they had the real one now and this real one had Authority he had never seen before and he reached out brother B said he took that Old Devil by the neck I'd like to been there wouldn't you sister you know what happened when he took that Devil by the neck he took your depression in a stronghold of his own hand and you know what what he said he said the cross of Calvary has paid the sin debt and every claim against you as a child of God has been strucken down in this moment then that's why this morning I believe that the answer to depression is not psychology it's not pills it is the power of God that delivers the church in the last days I believe it's real I believe it's still true and when Jesus took that devil you know what he done he took the keys off off his side brother Samuel and you know what when you take a man's keys to his own house that's embarrassment and the prophet of God said he slapped that devil and kicked him back into hell and Slamm the door on him and he left there with death hell and the grave and he took the keys of the whole thing with him you say preacher what would he do with them keys well I tell you what he did he went back on the day of Pentecost and he gave them keys to the Church of the Living God and the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the same conquering power that conquer death hell and the grave is in every believer in this building this morning and you got a right to step on every devil upon every situation it's all under your feet every devil of depression is under your feet every sickness is under your feet every disease is under your feet you said preacher I'm going to try to conquer that devil let me give you good news he's already conquered Jesus conquered him at Calvary he is a conquered enemy amen he is a king of a conquered Army he is a defeated giant he is a defeated enemy and you hold the keys of his defeat in your hands when you receive the Holy Ghost no wonder he don't want that Holy Ghost religion you know what Adam lost when he sinned he lost his godship you know what you get when you get the Holy Ghost you're godship you return back to your original creation as a son or a daughter of God with authority and with power listen you are not a weak trotten down bunch of nobodies that has no Authority or no power we are the daughters and sons of the most high God hallelujah I believe God is given Liberty in this age for a reason sure Satan's loosed out of the cage sure them Kings were loosed out of the caves but it was so God could show his exemplify power over them through his children Lord and a might Angel come down out of the heavens it was clothed with a cloud seven wigs seven angels made his wig which made it Daniel the seventh chapter this Ancient of Days supreme authority Supreme wisdom dominion and power amen Supreme sacrifice supreme power Supreme anointing Supreme Church Supreme signs what does it speak of everything is underneath them everything that can be named is under the name of Jesus Christ come on Lutheran Catholic Church of Christ Baptist whatever denomination you can name the message of the hour is supreme to it not because I believe it it's his message that's right that's right a mighty Angel descends out of heaven and look at him clo with a cloud and his feet Hallelujah and his feet yes come on Brother David and his feet pillars fire Hallelujah you know when I see Sister Christine when I look Hallelujah you know what I see when I look I see pillars fire prise the Lord not male not female not Greek not bond No free thank pillars pillars of fire prise lord now how many Bible readers we got in here I don't have to read it to you then and he set one of them foot on the land and he set the other one on the sea now lift up that foot that's on the land say what's under there every denomination all of Rome in Daniel the 7th chapter you can read you can read about all of the creatures you can read about all the kingdoms in Revelations 13 you see four Kingdoms in one and it's coming out of the sea yeah and 131 I got them backwards sorry 131 comes out of the sea Rome so what what's that mean to the church that denominational Spirit they'll put their foot on it that's right that Catholicism that romanism that that that that says see it's just a holy man in the pulpit and the body is just a group of people trying to endure now that's a lie this is not a Pulpit Ministry this is the body movement of the baptism of the Holy Ghost where he's taking a hold of every life placing a foot putting putting his foot on it and I'm out of time I know he puts his foot on it go ahead he puts his foot on the on the waters what's he doing all the creatures of Rome now that's powerful because brother Jaden if you're a Bible reader you know this Rome is going to rule the world that's right right she's the mystery Kingdom of that fourth Kingdom which shows up in Revelation 17 but this bride has dominion over it how did we get our Dominion the revelation of the word revealed to us that that was the mark of the beast oh then you put your foot on it and you walked out of that denomination you put your foot on it and you threw away that trinitarian baptism you put your foot on it and you threw away those tracks of of Jehovah Witness well glory to God I don't know anyhow I'm G to step on somebody ain't I sorry it ain't you I'm after come on brother put your foot on it yeah brother I I think it was Nathan was at the house the other night we we got a we got Grand kid Now everywhere thank God we got our Miracle Eevee 3 years February brother Ron saw that Vision remember back four or five years ago three years almost in February almost three years that we've held the miracle of God we've got Rosie miracle of God then we got a boy baby coming just like the Lord told him amen miracles of god I got all the Miracles but all those Miracles come to the house sometimes and they bring other Miracles with them and they like to play and brother knowah I just got one room so all the toys end up on the floor and you know poor brother Nathan he's in there the other night he's and then he starts hollering he gets on the gets on the couch and he turns around look one the toys is there man it's it's just poke the snot out of him you know and and I said Nathan I said just some things you got to step over man it's just some things you got to step over and as long as you got miracles in the church yeah come on long as you got the holy ghost moving in the church something can happen that you SW I don't really think that listen that's the thing just step over that one let step over that somebody gets to holling out in tongues and they're enjoying themselves don't get all wed up just step over that one amen that's the miracles of god coming up out of the church come on Church somebody gets to shouting and they get to dancing don't get all in a tangle about that but put your foot on that denomination of spirits put your foot on that false Doctrine put your foot on the things the devil has done against you as a Church of the Living God put your foot on that one come on Church put your foot on that Old Devil put him back in the hell he came out of but you know brother Richard the beautiful thing is he had two feet and the other one come up y'all know that was land right and that was America itself I'm leaving my notes and I'm preaching now but but that was America and that America y oh God bless her we love her I'm a patriot to my bones but she sold out she sold out folks she sold out brother Bram said the seed of Satan itself's in Hollywood right now come on and because of mar and Rose and I Love Lucy we never we never could have dreamed the influence it would have had on our society we could have never dreamed the marriage and divorce and the immoralities and the drunks and the cigarette smokers and the we we could have never dreamed it would had this kind of influence but before it ever got on the earth in Revelations the Bible said you put your foot on it you put your foot on that Hollywood thing do you know the scripture says in the last day the son of man said will come it'll be in like it was in the days of lot y'all know Sodom and Gomorrah what it was like and ask yourself is it not here and then ask yourself what channel does Sodom and Gomorrah really use to get into the homes you got Country Bumpkin kids sitting somewhere they ain't never been in no City and they're trying to dress like a girl or like a boy because of something they saw on the television come on nobody they don't have to you don't have to take them to the city or some library or something they got a cell phone they got a television they got and it's just pumping right into their hearts pumping right into their lives so after a little while amen men they start don't even look like men no more right and women start they don't even look like women no more and it starts mingling you say preacher amen what do you watch this they're mingling because amen the spirit that they're feeding on is the one that takes out the Divide look look the spirit of male and female was divided in the Garden of Eden right by God you get rid of the spirit of God and the next thing you know those two Spirits begin to pervert and come back together now you watch brother Brandon back in the ' 50s he's calling out this perversion with a woman wearing pants which would be almost an innocent thing now and the and the denominations wouldn't stand against it but now when people are crossdressing and they're wanting to get married and they're trying you can't even I'm I'm from Old School Brother Ray you got to forgive me but I still say thank you sir and ma'am and I'm at a hotel and I say thank you ma'am thank you sir I'm at the was and I have man I lately I've been saying I got to lose my manners I just got to lose my manners and just start going cuz I sometimes honestly do not know I'm not trying to be rude it's just the truth but it could have been stopped If the message of the hour would have been listened to in the 50s this whole country could the country would have never got into it now I'm coming on to you amen now watch this as long as the message has ruled in your home then your sons will look like men and your daughters will look like daughters but if you start taking out the message and the next thing you know you don't read your Bibles you don't play the tapes you don't get them into church amen you'll start seeing that Spirit drift on them come on and you can't blame the child it's the age we're living in amen but there's somebody going to get the Holy Ghost and that homosexual spirit is going to be put under the foot of the Church of the Living God there will be a group of young men in this age that look like young men there'll be a group of young women that look like young women because the message of the hour has divided it and brought it back to a reality in this hour church I say this our young people I want to congratulate you fathers I want to thank you mothers we don't have to preach on these things every
