Bibles we just like to go into the book of Ephesians I've been on a bit of a series here and um I uh I I don't know for sure how how we will handle this in the future not just maybe every service on it but I'm intending to go through the book If God would continue to give us Mercy uh I want to read Ephesians chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 um now being that I'm not a systematic preacher I or a teacher I I have to kind of preach the revelation of it so you you have to forgive me for my approach to it but uh the subject matter is here and if I took time we could tie a lot of it together but it it I I don't want it to get lost in the the tying together in CH 1 verse 9 and verse 10 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation and you could switch this word with a couple different ones but Administration is also a good one of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him we ask the Lord to bless his word this morning and this part um you could be seated yeah and uh we want to take this in this book of Ephesians uh in this part of the the series and I I want to title this uh uh for Content the mystery of his will the mystery of his will um having having looked at this I want to read something from the Amplified for you Amen in verses 9 and verses 10 making known to us the mystery secret of his will and I like this part of his plan of his purpose and that is in accordance with his good pleasure or his merciful intention which he had previously purposed and set forth in him having planned for the maturity of times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up and consummate them in Christ both things in heaven and in the Earth Earth now when we speak here this morning about the mystery of his will now I'll just say just say real quickly and openly brother Bram says the mystery of his will to adopt us that this was his purpose or the intent of this great plan of God was to bring the church into maturity or the fullness of times or the climax of the ages whereas that it would all end up in the manifestation of the sons of God now whether you want to uh uh maybe uh to embrace this or or feel Unworthy of it however you feel about it but it was all about you uh I hate to say it this plain but it's always been about you uh and it's one goal and one purpose that God has had in his mind from the beginning and that God has redeemed a lot there's been a lot happened but the entire thing has been pointing to the manifestation of the sons of God who are in the end time now in in looking at this I want to look at this word word having made known unto us the mystery of his will now this word here uh I just want to read a little portion here about Mysterion it means literally something into which one must be initiated before it is fully known uh it means to initiate or to instruct and that anything which is concealed or hidden now we commonly use the word to denote that which is above our comprehension or unintelligible but it this is neither the meaning of the word in the New Testament it means that there is some Doctrine or fact which has been concealed or which has not been fully revealed or which has been set forth only by figures and symbols and when the doctrine is made known it may be as clear as plain as any other such was the doctrine that God meant to call see the Gentiles when God meant to call the Gentiles which was long concealed at least in part and was not fully made known until the Savior came which had been until that time see a mystery a concealed truth though when it is revealed there was nothing incomprehensible in it and we'll take it in Colossians 1:26 the mystery which ha been hid from the ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints so it was in regard to the doctrine of election it was a mystery until it was made known by the actual conversation of them that God had chosen so in regard to the Incarnation of the Redeemer the atonement the whole Plan of Salvation over all the great points there was a veil thrown and the people did not understand them until God revealed them and when they were revealed the mystery was removed and men were able to see it clearly the manifestations of the will of God so in all of these manners and all of these different things uh they've been called Mysteries and as if something would be completely incomprehensible but it's really not incomprehensible it was just not revealed but when it becomes revealed it's just as comprehensible as any other Doctrine in the scripture because it becomes manifest it is a uh if you would look and think of a son and you would think of the mystery son but then there becomes manifest son so then you start understanding what sunship is you could think of mystery attribute God has attributes it was a mystery attribute until it's manifested and it's no longer mystery now it's a revealed attribute see amen you were a mystery in God's mind but now you're not a mystery any longer you are the revelation of what God had in his mind to begin with and see not known by man but known by God has now been revealed and some people can accept the Revelation others cannot accept the Revelation but it still remains to be what God had on his mind amen and we can prove it by Vindication and that's the powerful part of of having the message of the hour is that we've been we've been packed into reality by the Vindicated word not just guessing about it but knowing the truth of it amen now in the message of adoption paragraph 18 adoption four brother B will say this now the mystery he said the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament then back over there in the New Testament and tied something together for me and I love when the brother Bram gets something tied together because it sure ties it together for us he says it tied together for me see now the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will and the Mystery of us setting together so brother B is tying the mystery of his will he's going to tie into that the mystery of his coming and the Mystery of us sitting together now all of these have been Mysteries but when the time comes it will not be a mystery to the people it's happening to it'll be just so comprehensible it'll be so real and they're included in it but someone still tries to make it mysterious or they try to make it something that's coming or they try to make it something down the road so the people who are actually involved usually don't get to enjoy it to the level it's meant to be enjoyed because they're trying to put it into another age whether it be a future age or whether it be a past age that that is so hard to catch the reality that this is exactly what the scriptures were speaking about and when the Thunders are revealed what does it do it removes the symbol from the scripture and now you have moved to the reality of scripture and may I say brother I believe the hour has come I I really believe in this generation the hour has come I don't believe amen this is somebody else's day I believe you're alive and you're here because this is your day and I think it's time to recognize our day and our message and to fully involve ourselves in the message of the hour you know amen I I don't want to get sidetracked but I think it's powerful when you think about fully involved there's a firemen's term uh when they talk about houses you know amen amen it must be you pulling amen when they talk about houses amen and uh they talked about when they get firemen calls sometimes you know they don't want to go but if they ever hear the term the fire is fully involved it means the house is on fire and it's fully involved so all the firemen want to go to that house fire cuz it's fully involved you know amen and I'll be I I don't know amen what other people are doing other places amen but I I believe we got a Church of the Living God that's fully involved amen amen and and it and when you set the church on fire amen amen it it it brings life and truth and it brings reality to the Church of the Living God Amen and I believe there a fire burning this morning in the house of God Amen to to recognize that the prophet would teach us amen that these things three things tied together very closely the mystery of his coming to the mystery of his will to the mystery of us sitting together amen so immediately we're we're realizing brother bam is trying to show us that we can't understand the mystery of his will till we see the mystery of his coming because it would take God to tell us himself what his real will is amen it would take the perfect will of God when you go to the scriptures in Romans chapter 12th chapter the Bible says amen that that this is the season that we should be transformed by the renew of the Mind Amen to prove what is the perfect and acceptable will of God this is the season of presentment this is when God will present to himself a church without spot or wrinkle amen now how would it ever be a perfect Church unless there would be a perfect word and how would a word be perfect unless it come from God it would be the only way Amen to have a perfect church is a perfect word it would have to be a perfect God that would speak it now according to our Bible amen that there would be the revealing of the mysteries of God now you know me I I I have to I have to base it somewhere I can't just say something it has to have a it has to have a basis for me to personally have enough Faith to preach it to be true and in Revelations the 10th chapter my Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he's declared unto his servants the prophets now that that Revelations the 10th chapter is discussing John writing the seven Thunders and the Bible said he said seal it up until the seventh angel sound so in the days of the seventh angel the mystery would be removed it would be sound in other words what was mystery would become comprehensible what was mystery would be spoken plainly in the hillbilly English for us to catch it and understand it simple like amen now here here the scripture says that the mystery would be finished in Daniel the 11th chapter 32nd verse it's a powerful verse I've used it many times and has become rapidly one of my favorite ones he said and and and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do great exploits now the people that know their God now that don't have as much meaning until you hear what the prophet says about it in the Fe to the trumpets he says now he says see the Messiah people that's believing how will they know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is see Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish and the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God and how he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word so the bride will know her husband now if you've never read it the way brother bram's reading it listen to the way he reads it the people that know their God shall be strong the brother Bram says the bride would know her mate he switches those words people know God bride will know mate amen and he's showing us that he's bringing it right down to his own Ministry in that he was to introduce the mate of the church which he identifies as the revealed word of the hour amen we come on now folks the marriage has already come and if the marriage has already come what have we married we have married the revealed word of the hour so then the bride does have a headship she is one unit with God because she's received the word of God Amen as a hearer and become one now he shall appear in the last days that's why this has to happen amen it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in Luther it wasn't in westle that's why it was a mystery in those days and they taught the Traditions they taught about the marriage of of the lamb and about the coming of the Lord that's why books were written amen but they were being written under a veil amen and and and it's funny we were just talking the other day brother Carrie and I and brother Nathan and we were talking about brother brandom uh some of the things he taught early on let's just take uh the white horse rider in 1960 and he calls the white horse rider Jesus Christ he 180 de changes that in the first seal and says that it's the Antichrist and and some of our critics want to come along and say well brother BR was wrong but but no really he wasn't wrong because in 1960 it had never yet been revealed who that white horse rider was it he was no he was no more wrong let me just put it in phrases for you Martin Luther smoked a pot and drank beer baptizing trinitarian Doctrine and was the reformer the messenger of God for that age was he wrong see if you judging by the real truth we know today sure he's wrong amen but if Martin Luther would have lived longer enough he would have been Sanctified he would have been baptized with the Holy Ghost he would have taught amen the same thing we're teaching here today the thing brother random did is he lived Spann two ages he spanned from the Pentecostal dispensation and moved over into the word age and you can see the development in his teaching that when God opens the seals the dispensations change and because he's a word prophet he follows the inspiration he don't worry about what denomination has said he don't matter what other people have said or taught or thought the seals have opened the mystery and the prophet is leading the bride from misunderstandings to realities We are following the pillar of fire amen we didn't come to to make camp on any ground we didn't come to build a fire in the same place every service come on church amen we have come to follow the message of the hour into truth into every Divine truth and every word that this Bible has taught us I believe this morning that there is a promise for the Church of the Living God Amen what we said he shall appear in the last day and this is the promise of this age so let me just let me just complete that by saying before the first seal was open God winked at the ignorance of the teaching of men on that [Music] subject after that opened now we're back to the original thought of God God Amen so brother Ram didn't bring a new teaching he brought the original teaching Hallelujah so now the only thing you have to do is let go of all the other teaching and just follow the message and you'll be with the original doctrine that Paul taught in the beginning somebody said well I think brother Bram taught something different no he didn't beyond the curtain of time they asked and he said brother R you have to stand for everything you taught he said will Paul have to he said yeah Paul have to and there was a bunch of people out there that wasn't brandom's they were converts of this message and they scream back we are resting on that and we are still believing that this morning our Doctrine rests soly upon the scriptures the holy scriptures let me say it I believe this Bible from cover to cover in the cover that's on it because this is not amen just good ideology it's not just a book of history or a book book of Prophecy it is the word of God giving to this generation but there's a message that have come to bring us back out of denomination Creeds and ideas and traditions and places back into the atonement of the word of God the genuine atonement is the word folks come on come out of the tradition come out of the denomination come out of the ideology come out of all of it and come under the blood the blood amen my goodness I believe in it I believe the blood is preached in this hour ain't going to be no more blood shed so the only way we're going to get it now is through the word the word has to bring the blood to the church that's why it says dispensation do you see now this is the promise that was for this age now watch brother bam and I'm just going to show you a little comparison here if you like to study you'll pick up a couple of these things in Feast the trumpets paragraph 113 and he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word that's Daniel 11 so the bride will know her mate now watch he uses the word he shall appear in the last days now watch this next thing it wasn't reformers this paragraph 114 right below it it l was Wesley or Pentecostals the scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is the promise for this age we are living in the age is coming will be in now some people take an extreme amount of time to separate coming and appearing and I I certainly agree at times it is appropriate because we got to remember there's a Corporal body and we got to remember there's a leaving of the church but in many cases brother bam uses the word coming and appearing synonymously he literally just interchanged the two words here without switching without hitting the beat he just interchanged the two words and moved right on there he appear in the last day cuz this is the age his coming will be in she must be identified in him do you see he's talking about the word coming to the church he's talking about the revealed word now according to the leosan church age this Messenger will have the power of infallibility Revelations 10 and brother Ram said by by by necessity he will have the Capstone prophetic message and God will show him he won't need to speak for himself because God will speak for him by the voice of the sign now in Look Away to Jesus powerful sermon is it you would think brother brandom is getting you to look away Amen to Jesus coming in the Eastern Skies that's not what he's doing at all because he tells us the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God is that right and then he says he says everybody's speaking the name Jesus but they're not getting anything because they miss the interpretation of the name go ahead is that right so the the word interpreted word manifested is what we were looking for brother man he then gives you five manifestations of the third poll and I'll not go through all of them but you remember the speaking of the squirrels the speaking of the storms the the the speaking the raising of the Dead Fish and you got to ask yourself why he raised a dead fish when all the needs were out there brother Bram said this he was interested in the little things to show you he's interested in the small things in your life because God is interested so the third pull amen was was brought down to the smallest part of your life because God is interested in the whole thing and because of his interest look what he said he gives five manifestations and then he says Look Away to Jesus look away from what denomination schooling theology tradition amen all these things that man has said is Jesus brother R said they ain't right none of them he said because When They Crucified now you know these quotes When They Crucified him in Jerusalem it moved from the Pascal lamb to the Lamb of God and the veil was written open and mercy was shown in full View and that's exactly what's happened in this age church amen Mercy isn't over mercy no mercy is in full view in this age this is the greatest Mercy ever shown to any generation in the history of the world Hallelujah when we have mercy and partiality but at this time Mercy has become full thank you Jesus the mercy beautiful hand of God the third pul see was the interpretation of the word amen first pull was of course his hand second pole was the discernment the third pole was when a prophet took the scriptures and said this is what this means amen and this is what this means and this is what this means and this is what that me that's why the Revival in this hour will never be under the first pool it'll never happen under the second pool but the Revival is under the third pool which is the opening of the word and when the word become open now we know who it is standing Among Us now watch what we find the third pull has now been Vindicated brother bam says in 1963 now look what he says Look Away to Jesus this is his title and he says now this third pole that we've looked for so many years isn't that amazing we've looked for it so many years he says now it's been Vindicated and I'm sure you know what it is now some ain't figured it out now and it's been 50 years cuz it's hid yeah in 1963 Look Away to Jesus but here is him to has wisdom the third poll is properly identified the third pull is here now let's go Christ the mystery 1963 how do you know it's right he is the word the word is Vindicated and when the word properly Vindicated is the headship it's the head of the church he is the word the headship and he properly identified Vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person now what we're what we're seeing then is proper identification that's what happened with John and Jesus all right that's exactly what happened Jesus identified John and John identified Jesus amen that's actually what's happened in this age God has identified his prophet and his Prophet has identified God now what we then see is that we need to look to a the the teaching of a prophet to understand what it is that's here and what it is that we have received right now watch brother Ram will tell us this that this is to make known the mystery of his will to adopt us according to the pleasure that he has purposed within himself now three things watch mystery of his coming mystery of his will mystery of his sitting together so we want to look just a moment at the mystery of his coming now there's a there's a powerful thing setting here this morning because that we have been given a a a revelation in this age and some of you are even in possession and maybe not even aware of what all you're in possession of okay and I'll say this to you because when you hear the word Elohim the self-existent one Elohim there is a revelation with the name of Elohim in this age that has not been released in other ages now it was partially and it was hid but now it's been Vindicated because see we recognize that immediately medely when Jesus himself speaking and says as it was in the days of lot and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man two things he left out brother Mike he left out Enoch and he left out Abraham he left out the mystery of what happened in them days was Enoch translated Before the Flood and Abraham never was in Sodom to come out amen but we see that Elohim visited Abraham up there at the tent door and Genesis the 8 18th chapter we seen Elohim when he came to the tent door and Abraham called him Lord capital l r d brother brandham says that it was a Vindicated thing when Elohim looked at him and said bring me thy wife Sarah yeah and Sarah was laughing in the tent behind him and he said why does Sarah laugh within her heart she was behind him in her heart thinking something and he was standing at the tent door telling her what she had in her heart now I it's it's it's amazing when you get into who's this mdic and brother Bron brings it up and said no who was that but MDC amen he says now watch in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God there is MDC right there he's the word before that there was nothing God created it then mcedc who had no beginning of days no ending of life amen David talked about him Abraham talked about him but it was El cdct it was the theophany of God that came down in Abraham's tent and discerned him and Paul called it the word I don't want to put you to sleep but hang on let's let's walk Elohim then was at the tent door laying the framework of future generations of how Jesus himself when he came to the Earth the Son of God would use this to identify himself Jesus would pull out the same credentials that was used at the tent door of Abraham to Abraham's seed and he would discern their hearts and he would give to them and you know just for teaching sake he taught this to the Samaritans and he taught this to the to the Jew he did it at the woman at the well the Samaritan he did it to Philip and Nathaniel the Jew he did it to Peter he discerned the hearts of the Pharisees but he never did that to the Gentile church because the Gentiles were not looking for a messiah but the Bible records to us that after the death burial in Jesus that Paul took the Revelation to the Gentiles and had them looking for the coming or the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ in the last days now H you can get all tore up at me if you want to people say well brother Wayne you don't have scripture to preach the message of the hour no I got a lot of scripture most people just can't receive that the scripture in the Bible is literally talking about this age come on church if this is not the appearing that Paul was talking about what is if this is not the appearing that John was talking about what is if this is not what James and John and Peter was talking about then pray tell me what is when the Bible said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the shout is the message of the hour it is the Divine will instructions of almighty God coming to the church the general orders coming from Divine will in the Church of the Living God it's the captain of the host that has settled among the church it is the mystery of his coming is the revelation of Elohim brother now can we just say it there's just one God y'all know I'm telling you truth there just one God but that one God never changes his nature scripture on scripture I am God and I change not when he took the name Jesus that's why Paul said he's the same yesterday today and forever he's never changed his nature he's never changed his attitude whatever his attitude was at the tent door of Abraham is the same attitude this morning however he dealt with them in the Old Testament he's still the same God this morning his hand is not shorten his ear is not heavy if he healed them he heals now if he save then he saves now if he discern then he discerns now because he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm talking about God who does not change in Joel the second chapter he said I pour out my spirit sayith the Lord didn't he say it the word pour out brother random taught us is not like pouring water out of a glass he said it's the changing of a mask he's moving from one thing to another and brother Bram said see he wore a certain mask in Abraham's Day He Wore a pillar of fire in Paul's day he was behind the skin of Jesus Christ in that day but in the last days he'll put on another mask he'll come in the form of the Bride the redeemed Church of the Living God he will return as Abraham's seed Abraham's Royal seed of course he was the father of course he's the son but he's also the Holy Ghost [Applause] and where is that Holy Ghost yet a little while and the world see me no more but ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you until the end of the age that is not up for discussion Christ is here he's here in power he's here in anointing he just wears a different [Applause] masku he's the same Jesus in Bride form yes Luke 24 said their eyes were holding another places said he appeared unto them in a different form after his resurrection he still had a Ministry in John 16 he said I got things to say can't say them now but there's coming a time brother Ram said there's the prophecy of the opening of Seven Seals couldn't be done when Jesus was on Earth but in the last days there's coming a message it won't be William brandom speaking amen it'll be Christ himself in Philippians the Bible speaks of form Joel 2 it speaks of form Luke 24 it speaks of form yes sir the bride coming of the son of man amen fatherhood fatherhood matured in the son of man amen mecdc sunship matured in Son of Man Jesus Christ Holy Ghost most matures as son of man in Bride now watch what we're looking we're talking about him coming down now brother Bram brother Bram is explicit in this point he carries three names but he's the same God when Jesus was on Earth he never changed he was Jesus one man called him son of David yeah and his eyes was healed and a woman saw the same one and called him son of David he wouldn't even look at her he never changed anything but she said Lord right and everything changed because she approached him in another name but he was the same God so when Christ descends in the last day he didn't promise you son of David okay he didn't promise you just Son of God he promised son of man that's now this is packing prophecy come down now you've seen it in and and I'll just put it together since I'm here but you've seen it there in first in John 6 when Jesus said I'm the bread of life that come down out of heaven now nobody saw Jesus step out of a cloud and descend into their midst on the contrary some of them knew his birth mother some of them knew him as a young child child growing up they you didn't come out of heaven right but he was out of Heaven because the words of Isaiah and Malachi and the words of Ezekiel were being fulfilled so he as he was saying I am the Fulfillment of Prophecy he was saying I'm the bread out of heaven and all that they seen the growth you know they seen him from a young child they seen the growth they seen him grow up they seen the whole thing what do you mean you descended Out of Heaven see in 1 Thessalonians 4 he shall descend he shall come down but in Revelations 10 it says the same thing a mighty Angel shall come down out of it descend Out of Heaven brother B said who is that angel only Christ it could be the Covenant angel now watch what we're seeing is this is coming down bringing the Dynamics to the church now it's powerful to me can we can we look at promises y'all know how picky I am about scripture I have to make sure it's scripture in PSAL in Matthew 24 and 27 my Bible says for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth under the West so shall the coming of the son of man be now that's a very good English word coming so so you can't get so picky on a period in coming that you quit calling it coming cuz the Bible called it coming right now watch this Luke 17:24 for as the lightning the light now now let me explain that point to you years ago there was some teachings that went around that the Lord had come and they really meant it like the Rapture was over right right and if you were preaching and you said we're looking for the coming of the Lord half of them get up and walk out on you because that's already happened so so what it was is it's critical spirits right that pick certain spots to label or disagree so what I'm trying to show you is brother bram's Revelation it contained both words it wasn't he wasn't as picky as some people get right now watch what he's doing he's saying the coming of the son of man now again in Luke 17 he said as the lightning that lith out of one part of the heaven and shineth under the other part of the heaven so also shall the son of man be in that day for there first suffer many things and be rejected to this generation as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married the wives they given him marriage until the day Noah went into the ark now now I not going to preach a sermon on it you all could amen it is the days of Noah here it's it's there okay now watch likewise also as in the days of lot he's talking about sodomy let me ask you without preaching the sermon is it there so both of those things are in place but in the same day that lot when out of Sodom it rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now in Luke they're using the word revealed in Matthew they're using the word coming isn't it amazing that Revelation brings you in the presence of God in other words you don't think anything's happening but let a revelation strike you and you can see you're standing listen he's an all presentent God God is here right now the power of God is in this room right now healing is in this room salvation is in this room you're one Revelation away from the change of your body right now in this room something can take place and you can step from one dimension to another we don't have to leave church we didn't have to go somewhere nothing spectacular had to happen we just need to recognize come on church when Israel sees their great Revival y'all know what happens they only recognize the atoning blood that's why it says a nation could be born in an hour or a day cuz it they just recognize it and the same thing for you the moment you recognize it the blood's already there for you now watch this brother bam was saying and then Jesus came he said the promise of this age he promised he would be here that's enough for me the promise of this age he promised he would be here identified Christ in 1964 but if you'll just bear with me a few minutes I believe that I by God's help with his word according to his word can bring him right before you that's that Topeka Kansas series if you've never listened to it brother you need to brother Bram is telling them you don't know he's here give me a couple minutes with the word and this gift and you'll see his presence now watch what he was doing he was only opening their eyes to to what was in the midst trial I mean this is a powerful 1964 in April brother BR preaches on Green's meal and he's talking about he's talking about all the supernatural that's happening and all the powerful things that's in his life and his friends his Baptist pastor even is telling him you're having nightmares you you're you're you're what you're dealing with is the devil this gift and all do you know brother brandom literally went to Green Mill to pray that Supernatural away out of his life y isn't that amazing the pressure people can put on you isn't that isn't that wild man because they couldn't see what he saw they wanted to put pressure on him to get away from it and brother bam says but watch when that angel come he said he let me know he let me know he says that man told me not to ask to get rid of this isn't that amazing don't get rid of this but it was a gift sent from God and it was to be taken to the peoples of the world to let me know by scripture that all these things that had been promised according to the Bible must be fulfilled and the time was at hand amen I went back and told my pastor he said and went down and told him and he said Billy what have you eaten he said did you have a dream is it a nightmare but to me he said it was Malachi 4 amen it was to me Luke 17:30 it was Revelations 10 it was the scriptures promised in the last days now watch brother Bram goes into the Ohio River and the pillar of fire comes down and out of its a voice as John the Baptist was F to forun the first coming of Christ you've been sent with a message Amen to forerun his second coming is that right now watch this 1933 forerunning he said your ministry will forerun for the second coming of Christ thousand times thousand thousands of people heard it newspapers carried it and I want to call this to your attention now he's talking to Blind prosecutors that are saying brother Brandon where's the evidence of your ministry he says I want to call your attention to this that's looking around for some man to have thorns and prints and nails and everything like that it doesn't say it it doesn't give such a promise woo brother B said I'm going to have a message at runs his second coming and they're watching brother Bam's Ministry and they keep looking for this man to follow him around with nail prints oh now church I'm not I'm not I mean y y'all know me I'm not doing away with the Corporal body CU that's going to that's going to come I'll show you where it's at in just a moment so bear with me a moment now now watch this remember when that body appeared under Martin Luther and he stood there with a crown and said worship me Martin and Martin took an ink well and threw at him he said because he's not crowned until the Millennium and we'll put a crown you're an impostor he says he looked just like Jesus Christ but the postor was standing there because it wasn't the promise of the hour and by the word he knew it was wrong come on Church somebody come in here this morning dressed up like Jesus yeah amen Brian probably pack him out before he got in the back door you say why is that because that's not the promise the promise is we'll meet him in the air that we'll have a changed body when we see Jesus now the Bible said every eye shall see him every tongue shall confess but that's for a millennial not the Rapture of the church now watch this get it because I want to show you something here which is brother Ram says to reveal the secret see it's nothing but God's word being made manifest back to the son of man we don't look for nail scars we look for the word to be manifest we look for the word to be manifest if you're looking for the Bible to be manifested you don't have to look any further come on the message of William brandom has thoroughly Vindicated the resurrection of Jesus Christ if you were going to prove Jesus is Alive you tell me where you could get more evidence than the message of the Hour come on church and I say this brother random wasn't Jesus but he introduced us to Jesus and that same Jesus is still alive I say he's not in a tomb in Jerusalem I say he's not in the Tomb in Jeffersonville I say he's alive and he's still just as real as he ever was he's alive he's well he's in the Church of the Living God his name is Jesus lord now brother Ram says he appeared to Abraham as the son of man being revealed in the days of Sodom he was revealed in human flesh which was one called called mecdc or father see what it is brother baham says it like this he says he appeared to Abraham in the form of a man Elohim Jehovah it wasn't come on y'all know that wasn't just a spiritual body cuz he ate and he drank and he got his feet worst right but he told them what they were thinking in their heart now Malachi and the rest of the scriptures in the last days before the son of man himself as son of man will be like it in the days blind prosecutor can't you see this his words are true not Nails scars and prints and Thorns isn't that amazing brother trying to lay that down so strong yes sir look what he's saying he says look look at it real good now it's the Son of God impersonated in church as the son of man fulfilling Malachi 4 how many believes brother Ram fulfilled Malachi 4 do you see what fulfilled that scripture it wasn't the phys physical man it was the spirit of God confirming his promise now look what it is brother B said blind prosecutor do you get it I want you to know blind prosecutor we see it we believe it these words are beill before us and we know they are true isn't that powerful Amen in the trial brother B says I'll call your attention to this your scriptural blind prosecutor he he was really putting it on him was he he says he's going to sound ridiculous there's spiritually blind the prosecutor is see what it is they're not recognizing it it's happening just the same but they're not seeing it Christ is here but or not seen it the son of man has revealed himself in every manner promised in Bible but they haven't saw it but then the other ra said but we have seen it and we believe it and we know it's true then look what he's doing he's telling us what he promised to do in the trial brother bam said he promised to turn turn the spirit into power and vindicate his word it would be Christ it would be Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings showing the signs that was promised he promised that he would do now you you got to hold on to your seat Bel for this one he said Jesus was God In the Flesh and if Jesus is in you it's still God manifest in himself in the last days on the son of man revealing himself in the church the human flesh making himself known proving his word do you see what I mean the son of man Jesus Christ will come down into human flesh amen here it is brother Ram said a dozen more evidences by scripture this day this scripture is fulfilled I challenge you as Believers to believe it on now I challenge you to believe that the son of man is revealed in the form of the Bride in the the last days come on church not every one of us is going to carry a prophetic word that's not what he's talking about William brandom is not uh he's not our bridegroom he was a part of the Bride yeah so he was a sheath that was to be waved over the church the first one that come to maturity to prove now that's of course the secret food that he will embody himself brother Bam's Ministry I got just a couple more and we're going to move on brother Bam's Ministry is is powerful in that watch brother badam he'll say it like this it's a different Ministry from a pastor or teacher he said and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me well now that would be hard for some theological discussions but he said if I say something wrong forgive me brother randam was not trying to say everything exactly to the place to dictate it like he was writing the Bible he wasn't doing that yeah but what he was doing was vindicating the resurrection of Jesus Christ now look at this he says this is my Ministry to declare him he is here headship is here now what's he doing he's identifying that now therefore we're not looking for nail scars we're looking for the word manifest he comes to those who look for him I used to know a fell he said he got up every morning at 6 o00 and looked to the Eastern skies and I thought what for no no really I mean look look at this they brother Brandon was not talking about them that's looking in the sky for him he was talking about about them that look for the word to be manifested why did Brother Bron preach Look Away to Jesus why did he preach look yeah amen look come on Behold the Lamb of God brother said here's the thing he said you know what you know he said but when you see what you see he said but when someone screams to you look he said they're seeing something you haven't saw and they're trying to draw your attention to it and here's a prophet saying of the church look look to Jesus where's he at brother brandom I don't see his Thorns I don't see his nail prints he's fulfilling Malachi 4 he's fulfilling Revelations 10 he's fulfilling Luke 17:30 our bridegroom has come Among Us listen Church we're not looking for his coming he's here he's here he's here in power he has descended into the church amen speak well the Lord himself shall descend from heaven well I my question brother Zion is how far did he come down did he come down just to a prophet did he come down just to Ohio River did he come down just to the meetings in Tucson I believe he come all the way down to my house I believe he come to your house I believe he come to True Earth Tabernacle I come I believe it came right here in November of [Applause] 2023 I believe he's come down I believe he's here you said brother Wayne how do you see him the Bible tells us amen they would see him Jesus brother bam says it like here quickening power let us see his coming so brother Wayne what are you talking about let me just say it like this blessed is he amen that cometh in the name of the Lord in the book of Zechariah we'll just teach it real quickly the book of Zechariah remember behold thy King cometh amen and here he come off of a mountain Mountain on that little white donkey riding down by the way I think that must have been the donkey that had a scriptural mother just say it you know he had knocked knees and bold legs and may be the reason he had never been rode cuz he wasn't ridable by anybody else but when they turned him loose the master was going to get on him amen and everything changes when the master gets on a man Hallelujah can you imagine when he's riding when he's riding down the middle of of the streets and they're saying Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna one of his little one of his little mule buddies looked over and said hey I think they're worshiping you they're really proud of you he said no mama done taught me they're not looking at me they're looking at the lamb they're not looking at me they're looking at the one I'm packing and let me say this amen I don't believe we're looking at one another this morning we could find all kinds of problems but we're packing a message we're packing in the message of the coming of the Lord this is not just a come on it's not just a sermon or a little bible school amen it's the ministry of the son of man that's coming to the church with the rapturing of the church I don't know today tomorrow the next day but I do know this he is here for a [Applause] bride Hallelujah see the answer to the prophet's prophecy Zachariah is being answered in Matthew and some was looking for him but they did not know who he was because of them of course he was just that that drunken Soldier son that Mary lied about their relationship and had to hide and you know why they did that brother Greg it wasn't the first time that had been told about Virgin birth and all if you go all the way back to Babylon back to the building of of chrisan emrod building the tower the mother child remember the mother was a promiscuous woman and she had all kinds of promiscuous relationships in their Temple because it was an adulterous religion and when she become expecting a child amen they had to tell the people something okay so they gave them the idea of a virgin birth and they sold it off as a lie so people later with thinking I don't know about this virgin birth stuff and if God had to revealed it to you you wouldn't believe it either lots of Christians don't believe in the Virgin birth but we do because we are involved in the relationship with him who was virgin born and come back into the world as a manifesting presence in our lives do you see when when he when he came there of course he's writing and they're they're looking they're looking they're looking at the biblical promise now now y'all know y'all know oh what's amazing to me is the people that did get it because there was no holding them people back and they was screaming and shouting rejoicing and brother Bram said that's what was causing the stir you remember people talk about emotion brother Braham said it like this he said sir he said it's not fake he said emotion is stirred by something he said if somebody's scared in the alley it's emotion they scream out he said I want to know what was behind the screen if you hear somebody screaming out in a hall you won't you won't just think oh that's somebody screaming no you want to know what's behind it somebody died somebody get hurt was there an accident what happened something's behind it and when you hear a church going off and standing Hallelujah glory to God Amen and you see them church and moving in the spirit of God listen I don't want to call that emotionalism I want know what's behind it and if you're wondering what's behind it let me tell you what's behind it it is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and Luke 17:3 and John 14 and Revelations the 10th chapter and we see it and we know we're in the presence of a messiah amen so I don't know about you but if you don't want to worship scoot over why I do and give me some Elbow Room because he's worthy he's worthy of Our Praise that our God would come down in a little church like this a bunch of simple and humble people but he'll break out into the room and make himself known Among Us I believe he's worthy of Our Praise I believe he's worthy amen of somebody letting somebody know he's here in the midst of the room thank you Lord hosan go ahead to the king and when they didn't have nothing to worship with him they took their coats off and threw them in the floor and they took Palm leaves and threw it in front of him because the King was passing by well I tell you the same King's here this morning he didn't change none did he Hallelujah when he come right down they worshiped him coming right down that street death burial and Resurrection he raised up out of the Grave he went to souls in prison delivered the Church of the Living God and turned Heavenly and as he's going into the Gates of Heaven he starts singing the Psalms brother BR said he did he said lift up oh ye gates of everlasting life and let the king of glory come in and they said who is the king of glory he said he's the one one that is mighty in the battle and they swung the doors open and there the king of the city of Jerusalem come marching in with resurrected Saints now that same King has descended into this age as the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come into the person flesh of the Church of the Living God that's why in Revelations 3 it said behold I stand at the door and knock and if many man will open up ah we'll come under to him who's coming in the king of Glory Hallelujah the one that can conquer every problem he can conquer every Temptation he's the one that conquered at Calvary he's the one that conquers here this morning if we would open up our heart the Conqueror is here the power of the son of man has descended into the age Amen to bring the church to Revival the Revival of the rapturing of the church not a five week five minute not a 10-hour Revival Revival that will change our body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye hall hallelujah I need three languages right now glory to God he's the king and he's here he's here in our midst brother Wayne I don't like worship we scoot over and I'll worship go ahead and hold your peace and I'll worship for both of us yeah amen [Applause] said brother Wayne why would you act like that well you didn't know me no you didn't know me you didn't know me you didn't know yeah amen you don't know what he done for me brother Wayne I tell you what are you perfect no I'm not and unjoko be perfect Lord but I say this I ain't what I used to be hallelujah thank you Lord look at this hosana to him that cometh in the name of the Lord who is this they say who is this among you you who is this in the worship who is this I say it's the king who it's not really who they say what do you say who do you say I the son of man am who is that's the question who do you say it is that's circling this room cuz if it's just emotion go ahead and let it go by you but if it's the pillar of fire you ought to embrace [Applause] iten Hallelujah I got a lot of questions to ask about it but I don't have time to do it so I'll just say this behold I stand at the door knock that's a relevant scripture to our age Amen brother B said the only age he promised to be in and they kicked him out if you watch it every scripture says behold I come quickly but in Revelations three said I stand at the door brother bam is teaching us that he would stand at the door knocking If any man hear my voice now what's that voice it's the word any man hear the voice my sheep know my voice now watch whatever he says here brother BR ask the question now I'm just going to illustrating saying this you're sitting in your living room knock comes at the door but this knock comes at midnight this ain't one of them middle of day visits that just anybody might drop by some people even in bed at that time honey who's at the door it's midnight Matthew 25 says it is yes sir yes sir science just mov the clock the knock is at the door who is it now this is this is a question I think is powerfully answered this way only Christ it could be do you see in the days of Jesus had they only knew the hour of their visitation they wouldn't have crucified him had they only knew the day of their visitation now watch brother bam he'll he'll help us clearly he says and may they realize this is the day of visitation you're here and you're trying to get the people to look to you so many missed it Jehovah JRA don't miss it it's your day it's your visitation could could I just bring that home don't miss it it's not an accident the your true word Tabernacle this morning it's not an accident that I'm going down this Trail it's not an accident that I'm knocking on a wooden door this morning which is a symbol of humanity knocking on it heyen who is it it's Christ the King and he's here and he's at your door and he's at your heart and he's asking who do you say that I am and look what he's doing he's asking to come in brother Ram said he made a promise he would be here before judgment and right here in the Midnight Hour he's knocking on the door he's telling you judgment is coming we see the Judgment signs but I hear a knock at midnight saying amen won't you let me in now won't you let me in before it's too late won't you let me in this morning he's knocking at the door trying to get into the church brother said he's knocking what's he trying to do he's trying to gain entrance I believe we're getting our visitation brother bam says now he Ties That to Luke 19 and 44 because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation hey man now here's the thing any man visiting your home at such an hour must have important certain things to do he wouldn't be coming right and brother B says you see what he's doing it is Jesus and he's bringing something to you he is bringing your pardon here it is midnight here judgment is at the door here Israel is getting ready to enter a third world war Russia's getting ready Ukraine's getting ready you sat there with needs in your life and I'm hearing a knock at midnight and he's saying I'm at the door I got you your pardon in hand woo he's here this morning you don't have to go down to the courthouse tomorrow you don't have to go sit in front of a jury or a counselor you don't have to listen he's here and he's got your pardon and all you got to do is open up and let him come in y'all know only a judge can get pardons in Revelation the 10th chapter we seen the white wigin come down as judge he said brother Wayne how could he be judge and prophet in the Bible Abraham's time how shall the judge of all of the earth Abraham called Elohim In the Flesh the judge of all of the earth am and he turned and looked at Abraham and said I'll not hide nothing from you being that thou art the heir of the earth I'm not going to hide nothing from you he was coming with pardon listen J James chapter 5 this is a powerful scripture if you've never seen it James chapter 5 and: 8 be patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh Grudge not one another against one another Brethren Les you be condemned the judge standeth at the door who is it it's the judg but he's not here to condemn you he's here for your pardon he's come to deliver it himself he came down that he might bring it he's not what's he doing he's receiving a bride he's erasing the problems he's settling the issues now you say brother Wayne why don't he just come in then cuz the latch is on the inside you have to open the door and here's amazing thing to me I was studying this some time ago and I was just thinking about the carnality of knocking doors and things you know how it is and man maybe you hit midnight some of you probably in bed and if you ain't you're wondering who's at the door anyhow yeah you lay around a little while if you set there too long when you get up and go to the window all you see is tail lights and then comes that question who was that okay see it goes from who is it who was it the judge was at the door now you you hear Brother Bram tell this in a story he tells it a couple different ways but in a couple different times but he tells it the the the center point is the same and a young man got in real trouble remember and he was on death roll and he was fising to die and he needed to stay from execution the mother got a hold of the governor of the state and brother Bram said she knew he was the only one between the boy and capital punishment so when she got to his office she got on her hands and knees and she crawled to the desk of the governor look at that approach Governor please sir my baby that he might be old he might have done horrible things but he's still mama's baby I'm going to tell you something about a mama Mama's love is a special kind of love folks it is the only thing that's the closest to the love of God there is and that Mama So entered in and so humbled herself that a governor became interested in a case like this yeah he left he left his mansion and the governor himself went down to the C s they took let him in brother Ram said he said they let him in and set him on the bed next to the fell and he and this this in the message look he he draws it like this he said but the boy refused to even look at the governor now now what brother BR is telling you he's trying to get you to look at his message as the Fulfillment of scripture amen and he said the the boy refused to even look at it he said he had a complex with religions so he thought surely it's only here to do something wrong or and and you come on many of you folks know what I'm talking about here sure you know some of you a refugee nearly from situations and spiritual takes us sometimes years to get trusting again because of spiritual manipulations and hurts and y y'all know what I'm talking about the boy was so complexed had his guard up so much that he wouldn't even look at the man he was trying to talk to him and he was trying to get his attention son could we just talk I don't want to talk to you could you could you could you just look at me a moment I I don't want to look at you I want to talk to you brother Bram says in a moment he said the governor got up having fulfilled what he told the mother he would do he got up he stepped out of the cell and he starts walking down the hall and the boy just gets curious he steps over to the jail bar and he looks and he looks and sees and oh is look like an important man wearing the Su hey guard who was that he said that was the governor of the state son he said you mean the man that could save my life was in my cell and I wouldn't even look at him he should have said who are you he shouldn't have said who was that now this morning you're sitting here and I know many of you are very devout Christians fire musicians could come I know many of you very very given to the Lord You've accepted the message but if you feel a knock this morning at your heart if this sermon speaking into your heart this maybe you got yourself in a situation you don't know how to get out of King is here he's here he's here to deal with hearts yes some of you was in our Bible study the other night wasn't it amazing we had a little bible study and it was just maybe 20 30 40 minutes of Bible study and questions and conversation about the word among their young couples and we start singing just a couple real soft songs Just In Worship no push just want to say a dismissal prayer and you that was there Master just stepped in the room and he started walking right by each chair and he was just dealing with heart after heart brother Levi your living room will never be the same again the presence of God just will come right in that room and deal with hearts listen this morning if he's knocking at your heart let me say it the way brother brandom said it he said the door he's wanting in your heart and brother Bram helped us he really brought an understanding to us he said now some people let him in but they told him to stay in the forer but if you want him in every room yes Jesus he's willing this morning to gain entrance sometimes you got to go back and you just got to get in a place and say Lord I need a pardon yes sometimes you get yourself in situations where you just need to give your life to the Lord maybe somebody here this morning that holy spirit's knocking at your heart is somebody here this morning you've give your life to the Lord but you've been closing doors lately and you you've been beginning to push him out of certain areas I believe this morning he's calling I believe the holy spirit is here visiting if you feel that pulling at your heart it's him it's him yes the devil would never never ask you to open your heart to the Lord you know one time brother Bram said I don't like them prayer them prayer uh pools in the altar he said where people come up and he says now just empty yourself just blank your mind brother said I don't like that but when we ask someone to open their heart this is not the unknown we know who he is and it's him yes Lord and he's here this morning yes I wonder if you stand to your feet with us I [Music] wonder [Music] is he is here ohly will [Music] bless now if he's working at your heart won't you just come maybe a long time since you've been in an oldfashioned alter call but the Lord put it on my heart this morning if he's knocking won't you answer the call this morning won't you just come kneel here and say Lord I want to open my heart to you today I need you Lord you're welcome now can touch you will never be the same
