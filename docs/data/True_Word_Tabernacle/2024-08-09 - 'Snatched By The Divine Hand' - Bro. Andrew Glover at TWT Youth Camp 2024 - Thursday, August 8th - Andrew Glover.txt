been stirred up like it is every Camp year this is second year in a row one of our young men's been in a in a terrible car accident right before Camp brother Aaron Thompson was in a car accident today I believe he was actually on his way to the campground thank God uh he he's all right just a little just a little banged up could have been so much [Music] worse so we give God the glory amen they actually had to cut him out of the car but he walked away with minor injuries so amen you know the devil will fight but he will not Prosper amen he doesn't have one weapon Amen in his tool belt which will prosper against the Bride of Jesus Christ so we're we uh we don't worry when the devil's on the Rampage amen we know that's a sign it's going to be a wonderful weekend amen a lifechanging amen life changing Spirit moving weekend to worship God Amen enjoy the presence of the Lord the preaching of the word and so we're just in great anticipation great anticipation how many came expecting

of God uh uh amazing testimonies that have come out of this Camp wonderful freedom of worship amen singing shouting dancing all those kind of things somebody said one time well you're one of those

amen I believe we ought to go ahead and have a camp meeting this weekend Amen Let the spirit of the Lord move amen enjoy the enjoy the whole experience from start to finish amen the great thing about

wonderful thing it is to bring people together amen we we're all about that we want to we want to build Bridges amen uh and so we just thank the Lord for for the support you know and so it's a lot of different people coming from different places you know we all come from different backgrounds different ideas and so why don't it just get in your mind right now you know that uh maybe this weekend somebody maybe will sing a song that you don't like or the preacher will he'll preach it a little different in a way you do it at home or you know maybe things something will be handled a little different than you're used to that's called the cost of Fellowship amen how many are willing to look over that and get into the unity of the spirit amen and and pay the cost for Fellowship amen that's what we're all about you know we want to come together we want to be in agreement amen uh brother brandom talked one time about how great evangelists would come to town like Billy Graham and you know everybody be so excited because they got a great big group of people together you know and and and bring people just bring bring a great audience together but brother BR said in that audience you know you'd have one baptizing in in the you know quoting the Trinity and another one praying to the you know to Catholic saints and you know one Protestant one Catholic all that kind of St he said that's not Unity amen he said we don't need evangelists of that sort we need salvationists amen that's what we're all about not just to bring you together to get a big group together but we're here to see

underneath the blood of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord as we come to you on this first night of this meeting Lord gathering together in this building father a place Lord that no doubt has been used for many different activities between the last year and this year's twt camp but Lord as we come here tonight on this first night we come to claim it oh God lord we drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord father we're asking the angels of God to come out of the out of Heaven Lord as your Prophet said out of the bleachers and Lord may they come into this building tonight and may they take their positions among the Believers father We Gather here tonight Lord as a Victorious People Lord we are needy people but Lord we're a Victorious people because before we had the need Lord you provided the Victory and Lord we know the devil would love to do everything he can he's done everything he can to stop the meetings and to stop the young people from getting here but Lord we're here and the devil is defeated tonight so Lord as we come into one mind and one Accord we're asking the anointing that destroys the Yoke of the enemies oh God may it come among your church tonight in a powerful way Lord from the very first service to the last service oh God lord May Hearts be changed Lord father may may spirits that are binding and tormenting your children Lord may they be broken dear God lord may this be a Victory Day father Lord I pray for those that maybe are here tonight sick in their body and Lord there suffering I pray oh God the Healer would come through this

and can move forward in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight how many's happy to be at Camp again amen it is a real honor to amen that's right give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen it's an honor to be among Believers and to be amen here tonight we say God bless you we thank you brother Wayne brother Nathan Brother Ray brother Ronnie the ministry team here we thank you for the invitation to come and to be here to speak to you and we just pray that we can say something that'll be a blessing to you and an encouragement and we do want to say God bless you to all the ministers here tonight and amen if you have your Bibles we want to go straight to the word of the lord we want to turn to the book of Isaiah the 59th chapter the book of Isaiah chapter 59 and then also we're going to read in the New Testament in St Matthew chapter 14 and verse 25 amen I believe the spirit of the Lord is Among Us amen amen this is one of those places you just stand and brother BR said the atmosphere you can feel the charge of it in the air and I I can feel that expectation charge in the atmosphere tonight amen I'll just say this the devil's in trouble amen the devil's in trouble Isaiah chapter 59 in verse number one the Bible says behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save and neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear I love that the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save and neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear now if you want to see a direct manifestation of that let's turn to the book of St Matthew the 14th chapter St Matthew chapter 14 and I want to read in the beginning in the 25th verse of St Matthew 14 in verse number 25 Jesus has just calmed the storm and in the 25th verse it says and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear brother BR said the devil tried to make him afraid of the only thing that could help him they cried out and said it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but Jesus straightway spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid so he rebuked the fear by identifying who he was in other words he said I'm here it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered and said unto him Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink now watch he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand because his hand is not shortened and called him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did not didst thou doubt and when they were coming into the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God Amen I believe we can say tonight of a truth he is the Son of God and he is here in our midst tonight we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats um from those scriptures tonight for just a few moments I want to speak to you here if I would title this tonight I want to speak to you on snatched by the Divine hand amen snatched by the Divine hand and you know as We Gather here tonight I know we're all coming from different walks of life different backgrounds amen different situations different problems different circumstances each one of us are facing different mountains different obstacles but I want to say tonight that no matter what you're going through amen that God is not interested in replacing you amen but God is interested in rescuing you he's not interested in finding someone else to do what he's called you to do but rather he has chosen you elected you ordained you anointed you and positionally placed you and therefore God is more interested in rescuing you than he is replacing you because you see amen there's actually more Victory Amen in a testimony of God's rescuing you amen then God replacing you now when you look here at this word snatch it has a very very powerful definition it means to quickly see something Amen in a rude or eager way it means to quickly secure or obtain something amen when a when a chance presents itself it means to eagerly take or accept an offer amen or an opportunity now I'll say this anytime that the Lord snatches one of his own or eagerly catches one of his own amen the devil always considers it rude you know the devil has plans the devil has ideas the devil has a Direction amen but then all of a sudden the anointing comes in and the anointing destroys the Yoke of the enemy and snatches you amen and all of a sudden the devil's plans that he had for you have just been interrupted amen because the hand of God is more mightier amen than the mountain or the obstacle that's in front of you amen and God is more interested in rescuing you than he is replacing you now amen in St Matthew 14 and: 31 amen the Bible says that Jesus stretched forth his hand amen and he caught Peter and he said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt now when you look at this word cult it means to lay hold of it means to take possession of Amen it means to overtake or to lay hold of or to seize amen upon anything with the hands it means to to rescue one from Peril it means to help or to secure amen so when Jesus when he caught Peter amen what he done was he overtook him amen see there were things that was trying to overtake him amen but God was not interested in allowing the things that was trying to overtake him Amen to overtake him but God was interested in delivering him amen and the hand of God was greater than the water amen than the fear than the situation and I'll say tonight we've gathered here and there's a lot of devils amen they're trying to overtake minds or trying to overtake futures or trying to overtake homes and churches amen but I stand here on the first night and say this devil you don't have enough amen you don't have enough pressure you don't have enough scare you don't have enough fear amen because there is one in our midst amen who is mightier than the fear he's mightier than the water he's mightier than the sickness he's mightier than the depression he's mightier than the sin he's mightier than the Habit he's mightier than the besetting sin there is nothing the devil can throw against you that is more powerful than the hand of God that is in our midst to overtake you brother said when Peter started walking on the water he thought he was getting along all right see how big I'm doing he started sinking he didn't say well I guess it failed Heen on down to the bottom a few bubbles come up and that was all of it see no I love that Peter did not accept amen that he belonged at the bottom he did not accept that he belonged underneath a situation he didn't just give into the water and say well let's just sink and let's just sink let's just go on down in depression let's just go on down and sin no but there was a hand there and that hand was a mighty hand and Peter judged that hand more faithful amen than the trouble that was in front of him he be to cry out amen he began to cry out these words Lord save me brother B said amen and that Eternal hand I love that that Eternal hand reached down amen and picked him up again amen when he cried out let me say this his hand is not shortened and neither is his ear heavy amen and his hand is not temporary amen but his hand is eternal so that tells me amen that if it reached to Peter amen it also reached to Paul it also reached to James it also reached to Moses and David amen well let's just goe to say it and that same hand is in this building tonight amen to reach every heart listen you ain't got to get it all figured out you ain't got to get a plan together to approach God you just got to recognize I'm on my way down but there's a hand that can reach down and can snatch me of the situation and can put me back on top listen we don't belong on the bottom we belong on the top We Don't Belong under the water We Don't Belong under the pressure We Don't Belong under the situation we belong above it as Sons and Daughters of God so we're going to cry out and we're going to pull on God until he comes into our midst and reaches down his hand and saves us we're not playing games we're Sons and Daughters of God and just as Peter was so are we we are in the line of duty brother B said Christian tonight you're in the line of duty see you're trying to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and a cancer has grabbed you or a death grabs you or torulosus or whatever it is see but you're in the line of duty don't forget that you're in the line of duty Lord save me or I'll perish and then his desperation he called out and a hand reached and picked him up he said you have the same thing he said he screamed out Lord save me amen I'll say this we find out in the sinking amen that God heard him in the line of duty he started to sink amen he failed now amen let's just go ahead tonight and let's just go ahead and give that devil a black eye amen we refuse to Bow our knee Amen to the fear of failure amen we're we're we're done with the fear of failure brother BR said he was afraid he said he failed but no matter if you fail that don't have nothing to do with it amen we all fail we're a failure to begin with but we got somebody that is standing with a strong hand who can reach us and take us above the water listen quit reasoning with the devil and saying devil I'm sorry I failed devil I'm sorry amen the devil has no business in this meeting he has no room he has no rights he don't have the microphone and we're not going to give him the floor but there is a hand among us tonight that can reach in the dark deepest most cruel most most unbelievable places and can rescue a son or daughter listen you ain't got to have an education you ain't got to have a good standing you just got to have a voice that says Lord I need some help I need to get above this situation I want to walk like an overcomer I want to believe like a messiah I want to worship like David I Want to Love Like Jesus I want to pray like Peter listen the hand of God is in this building to take you from beneath it and please put you on top of it sir amen I'll tell you what the prophet of God said he said his hand can do all things amen his hand can do all things Amen brother Wayne I'm going to have to Bor amen a story you told at our tent meeting about a man that was finding a helicopter amen across the water and he he I think he hit his head and fell out of the helicopter landed in the water bleeding there and the Sharks were gathered around him and all of a sudden amen the Coast Guard flies over and they get over top of him and they start trying to encourage him brother Wayne said the man didn't need encouraging he just needed saving see it's not that he didn't need encouraging he just needed saving and then he would get some encouraging listen friends what we need tonight is to quit trying to come up with a better plan am meant to overcome the devil and come back to the message of the hour which is the Vindicated method of God listen it worked in the 40s it worked in the 50s it worked in Jeffersonville it worked in Tucson it worked worked in Durban and Johannesburg it worked on the streets of Finland it'll work right here in St Mary's OH High the message of the hour is still the Vindicated way to save a man from sin to deliver him from the spirits of Torment yes sir amen then we'll begin to encourage amen let me say this amen his hand can do all things another place the prophet of God said it takes the hand of God to do something for man another place he said God Amen delivers by his hand I love what he says no man amen can come to me except my father amen draws him first see what it is it's God Amen seeking man you have nothing to do with it if you ever felt the hand of God Amen knock at your heart you are a privileged person I wonder tonight how many can just raise your hand and testify that somewhere in your life you have felt the Divine hand of God Amen touch your heart let me say this you are a privileged person because Peter comes along and instructs us and he says these words he says humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time now look at this word hand it is by the help or the agency of anyone It Is by means of anyone it is figuratively applied to God Amen symbolizing his might his activity his power now watch this in creating the universe upholding and preserving amen because God is present right protecting and aiding one and it's also in punishing and in determining amen and controlling the Destinies of men look at this word hand amen it's a very powerful word then then then Peter says in due time that word due time is a fixed it's a definite time amen it's a time when things amen are brought to a crisis it is an opportune or a seasonable Time amen it is the right time anden look at somebody next to you and say it's the right time see somebody wants to say well tomorrow night or or maybe Saturday night or maybe Sunday morning amen listen we're not promised the next five minutes amen so I say because we're preaching amen the present tense message of the hour amen right now is a seasonable time right now is an opportune time right now is the right time listen right now is the time to tell that devil it's over right now is the right time to tell that sickness I will no longer live underneath you you will no longer control my mood you will no longer control the way I go to church and the way I believe God there is a hand and it's a Divine hand and it's a powerful hand and it's in this building tonight the same hand that put the moon in the sky the same hand that put the Sun in the sky the same hand amen that controls the planets and controls the universe that hand is in this building tonight and he's here to whip every devil he's here to break every Spirit he's here to liberate every son and daughter of God it's not a man's hand it's not a weak hand it's the Divine hand yes sir the same hand that humbles is the same hand that also exalts now amen I'll say what a prophet said you have to be born to be Sons and Daughters of God right but if you want to give yourself to drinking or the world or any kind of divination things like that that's up to you see using it for the devil sure it's the devil gets a hold of you when God borns you here for a certain thing or to do a certain thing and you let the devil get a hold of you listen you let the devil get a hold of you you was born here to be Sons and Daughters of God but you let the devil get a hold of you and you want to become Glamour Girls and populars and everything else like that amen humble yourself before the hand of God so that God can make Sons and Daughters out of you listen God ain't interested in taking one of our young boys and making the next Michael Jordan out of him God is not interested in taking one of our young girls and making the next whoever Hollywood Glamour Girl out of you but he is interested and taking you and making you another David making you another Shamar making you another Moses making you another Rahab making you enough enough come on somebody hey that devil don't want it to happen but I want to tell that devil he don't have enough to stop it from happening because what God has determined and what God has spoken will come to pass and no devil can stop it yes sir so you know what I'm going to do Amen brother Nathan I'm going to take the Liberty on the first night to invite the Divine hand into this Camp I invite him I want him to come in I want him to touch our musicians I want him to touch our singers I want him to touch our preachers I want him to touch this pull pit I want him to go through and touch every chair I want him to touch every counselor I want him to touch every dorm I want him to touch all over this Campground we invite the Divine hand we invite the hand of God that has the ability to change the destiny of a man we invite that hand in this building come Among Us Lord touch our young boys touch our young girls touch our families Lord meet the needs of your children Lord we invite the hand of God brother said Heavenly Father take each one into your hand open Faith to their heart and may the Holy Spirit may he do the exceedingly and abundantly tonight as they're waiting said when God's ready to pick them up then he can do something with them that shows that he's God he takes nothing and makes something out of it he takes a sinner like me and makes a Christian the hand of God Amen let me say this when we say Amen the Divine hand we are of course speaking of the hand of God as you study through the message you will find brother refers to the hand of God he'll call it the Divine hand brother Thomas she'll call it the Unseen hand some places he'll call it the supernatural hand he'll call it the creative hand amen or the Master's Hand or the mighty hand or the tender hand of Jehovah he'll call it the Eternal hand amen he'll even call it the unchanging hand and then he comes along and says what is the unchanging hand he said that is his word the UN changing hand of God is his word his word is his unchanging hand amen now let me just give the devil a couple black eyes in Deuteronomy 5:15 it says remember that thou was a servant in the land of Egypt so one time you was under Egypt amen and that the Lord thy God brought thee out amen fence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee Amen to keep the Sabbath day in 424 that all the people of the earth amen might know the hand of the Lord that it is mighty that you might fear the lord your God forever amen I love Psalms 98 verse1 oh sing unto the Lord a new song Amen for he hath done marvelous things his right hand and His holy arm hath gotten him the victory let me say this sometimes we allow the waters we allow the pressures Amen to cause us to for get how powerful the hand of God is in Revelation chap 1 John was on the aisle of patmas and there on the aisle of patmas he breaks out into a vision and he sees the Sevenfold personage of Jesus Christ which then he sees the fifth fold amen of the revealing and here's what it was there were seven stars that was where in his right hand brother said see those Seven Stars amen they are the Angels which are the messengers and John said that he laid his right hand amen Seven Stars out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength now watch and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead but he laid his right hand upon me and said fear not oh my fear not I am the first amen and I am the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more and have the keys of death amen and of hell now watch he lays his hand over on John in other words amen he's laying his strength and his power over on John brother said see their strength amen was from the Lord or they could have never stemmed the tide they were safe in his care for nothing somebody shout back at me nothing nothing for nothing could pluck them out of his hand and neither could anything separate them from the love of God let it be sickness Let It Be Peril nakedness famine sword life or death they were truly yielded to him and they were kept by his omnipotence let me say when God puts his hand on something he puts his strength on it and he puts his power on it and he dares any devil to try to stop it he dares any devil to try to defeat what his hand has come up on that purpose for oh my goodness well I'll say this he's put his hand on every one of you young people he's laid his hand on you and he's dared lay out of SE it to take you he said go ahead devil and try it amen but they're not under their own strength they're not under their own power they're not under a Church's power or a preacher's power there is a hand upon them and it's the same hand that created the heavens and the Earth is resting upon this young person yes sir that's why Jesus come along and said My Father which gave me them is greater than all and no man somebody shout no man is able to pluck them amen out of my father's hand brother comes along in Investments and says heavenly father they are yours they are trophies of the message you didn't know it but you're a trophy they're trophies of the word they're trophies of Jesus Christ because you said that no man can pluck them out of my father's hand he gave them to me and no man is great enough to do that no man is great enough to pluck them out of my hand so keep them Father and send them forth as fire brands that have been snatched from the fire and make them Burning Lights for your kingdom I commit them to you in Jesus Christ's name do you see where we get this term amen snatched from the fire from it comes from one of the church age Messengers amen who had his right hand laid on him his name was John Wesley and he he he actually come up with this a fire brand snatched from the fire because as a child the house he was living in caught on fire and he barely got out of it some hand caught him or snatched him and got him out of the house that was on fire and then later he comes up with the second part of it and he says this amen it's the same way I view the circumstances of my eternal salvation by God's hand did you catch that Eternal salvation not Camp salvation not Sunday to Sunday salvation not special meeting to is eternal salvation in other words if you reduce this down to just Camp to Camp amen you're reducing the power of the Divine hand this hand has the power listen if we never have another Youth Camp and God puts his hand on you in this Camp it'll take you to the Future home it'll take you to the Rapture it'll take you to your theophany this ain't some little weak hand this is a powerful hand it's a creative hand it's God's hand it's a powerful hand yes sir he said see and he was snatched from the Flames of hell when he was headed amen towards a loss of both body and soul I love how brother B comes along and says this so snatch them as fire Brands out of the fire just before the coming of the Lord Jesus catch them Father this afternoon before the devil traps them somewhere and they be carried away let me say to you tonight we were snatched by the Divine hand not to be church members not to just be a group of young people that claimed the name message but we were snatched by the hand of God to be Believers listen and if his hand is upon you then everything his hand is is accessible to you brother R said every True Believer how many True Believers we have is in the hand of God and they can draw from his love and his power and they can receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer now not a partial benefit but you can receive the full benefits of all that God is to the believer in other words what he did amen for The Messengers is what he does for every believer who comes underneath her message because the hand snatches the elect out of the age let me say this we're not just church members and we're not just young people but we are a chosen generation ation according to Peter we are a chosen generation we are a royal priesthood we are a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness amen Into His Marvelous Light see a chosen generation is a blessed generation can I say that to you you are a blessed generation you say why am I blessed because of the church I go to because of the ministry I sit under because of the type of clothes I wear the amount of money in my parents bank account the amount of house I live in no the reason you are blessed is simply because of these words the cross of Calvary that's the whole reason we're blessed because listen whether we forgot it or not we are not Jews we are Gentiles and the Bible says that the Jews amen were the ones that should have received the hand upon them but remember when Joseph amen went there to Jacob was about to bless the two boys what happened he crossed his hand Oh my he crossed his hand and the blessing fell upon the younger the blessing fell upon the younger the blessing fell upon the the younger so you mean this is not just an Elder's message but it's also a young people's message yes sir see and Joseph cried out not so my father this is the firstborn to your arve but I love what Jacob said he said but God has crossed my hands in other words we see the blessing which belonged to the firstborn the Jew was given over to the younger the Gentile which was through the cross or the crossed hands of the Lord Jesus Christ because according to Galatians 3 The Blessing of Abraham comes through the cross he said see so The Blessing of Abraham came to the Cross to the Gentiles amen the Jews rejected the cross here it is and therefore Jesus got the Gentile bride so because his hands were crossed amen the Jews rejected him but Jesus got the Gentile bride brother says it very beautiful he said this transpired in order that the spirit might become available to the Gentiles without the crossing of the hands The Blessing of Abraham the baptism of the Holy Ghost the blessing of justification the spirit of Grace and wisdom and God could never come to this young people could never come to this generation he said but when Jesus crossed his hands he called out a people of the Gentiles for his name's sake he said in the Bride of Jesus Christ she will be mes Jesus Christ she will be baptized in his Spirit she will in his name and she will be filled with his power oh I feel like giving the devil a black eye right there he said see it very beautiful robed in his righteousness there she is he said that same power that spoke the world into existence amen is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost oh not only do you have his hand upon you brother ra the same hand that created the heavens and the Earth has now a prophet said if you got the Holy Ghost inside of you you don't just have the hand upon you but you have the life of the hand on the inside of you and you're not full of complexes and you're oh I might as well preach I feel that devil amen we've just settle down and let our lives become full of complexes and full of questions and full of doubts and full of this issue amen but I want to say Satan on the first night if you're living in one of these temples you are living trespassing you are a trespasser complexes don't belong in you unbelief don't belong in you bitterness don't belong in you Jesus didn't get a gentile bride to be full of Confusion And to be full of doubt he got a gentile bride to be full of his power and his authority and his anointing yes sir so I say to the devil this is bride time devil this is bride time this ain't Church time this ain't denomination time this is bride time because we have recognized that we are that Gentile bride we have recognized that we are the ones that the hand was crossed and the blessing has come upon see brother said very beautiful the time has come for god Jehovah to rise on the scene and show himself he always does it just at the Junctions of time and that time is now brother Caleb it's not in the future it's right now I love this light somebody say light light has brought a glorious Revelation amen and here's that Revelation that the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new are you with me and listen he's manifesting himself in you now let that settle on your heart for a second the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new and it's the same God manifesting himself in you and me said the Holy Spirit must be alive in the church always see the Holy Spirit must be alive in the church and live its day so the spirit of God coming in the church it's not coming to make us live another day but it's coming to make us live in this day which means there was a message for Luther's day and there was a message for Wesley's day and there was a message for Pentecost amen but let's not stop short amen let's go all the way there was an adoption promised to the church underneath a messiah sign there would come a third pull which would be the reintroducing of not a man's hand but of God's hand to the church brother B said see these Revel they're going to be brought to us in Revelations are you ready for this and from the hand of God by Vindication listen friends the message of the hour has come to you by the hand of God can I say it like this you're literally eating out of the hand of God as you're feeding upon this message you are feeding from the hand of God can I say what else the prophet said he he said it's pure and it's clean it's unadulterated word of God coming from the hand of God I love this one Easter 65 you who were once dead in sin and trespasses has now has now been quickened together to sit in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus oh I love this feasting on Mana from above and seeing the hand of God made manifest proven the promise of this day so we've been snatched by the hand of God we've been lifted to Heavenly places we're seated in Christ Jesus and we're not feeding on a man's idea but we're feeding on Mana from above and as we're feeding on Mana from above we're literally watching the hand of God manifested Among Us now I know what somebody says somebody says well if we're going to see the hand of God manifested then what we got to see is like they did in the brandom Tabernacle when the hand come down and wrote out the seven Church ages and the handwriting was on the wall listen that's one way that God Vindicated his hand in the midst of the meeting but let me say this uh and this is real simple okay but if you want to know if it's rained outside tell me the best way to find out go get your phone and check the radar and see if it says it's rained go get your newspaper and see if they predicted rain no the best way is to go outside and look at the grass and look at the trees and look at the pavement and if it's wet I'm not very smart but that means it's rained see the evidence that's on the thing is a proof of the rain that's come upon the Earth somebody says how do you know that the hand of God is upon this generation listen I don't see the physical hand of God tonight but I see the evidence of it I see the evidence of a hand that reached Into the Fire and snatched young people I see the hand of God that saved you from sin it saved you from perversion some of you all was oh God you was ready to be the next statistic but the hand of God reached down and snatched you away from the hand of the enemy listen don't tell me the hand of God ain't Among Us I see the evidence of it I see the evidence of the hand of God all across this building tonight I see his hand there I see his hand there I see his hand there I see it in the middle I see it back there amen Xavier go ahead and raise your hand I see the hand of God Amen just a few years ago wasn't serving God but the hand of God got a hold of him and saved him and he's not just a church member under some watered down idea he's a end time message believer I see the hand of God in this play in manifestation I see his hand I can't not believe it I see the evidence I see it I see the hand of God which also is associated with the favor of God so if the hand of God is on you then the favor of God is on you the Bible says that thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her all right yay the due time the right time the opportune time is come now you all know that Zion is the type of the Bride right so we can very well say that God is favoring his bride with signs wonders Miracles Revelation healing Deliverance Second Chances third chances first chances eighth chances come on we can very well say that God is favoring this bride because the prophets of the old formal Church age is gone and the time that God is doing a new thing he's not only doing it here but he swept it around the world see the message of the hour has swept around the world now let me ask you something what is the message of the hour that swept around the world it is a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ can I say something to you young people God doesn't do anything without raising up a witness of what he has done the Bible says in Isaiah 43 remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old for behold I somebody say I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth and shall ye not know it in other words God is going to do a new thing but shall ye not know it now listen I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert can I ask you something if you are in a Wilderness and you can't find your way out you're lost you're looking everywhere you don't know where to turn you're trying this trying that trying there and then all of a sudden amen out of out of Heaven comes a hand I'm feeling too good right now Out of Heaven comes a hand and it comes right down and just makes a Wilderness right there and all of a sudden your wondering eyes are now attracted to a way of Escape now will somebody know that there is a way in the wilderness when everything else is Bush but there is a trail if you was in a desert and you were literally you were thirsting you were you were dying of thirst and all of a sudden right there Amen in in the river in the middle of the desert a river Springs up will you not know it can you Hide A Way in the wilderness can you hide a river in the desert then listen friends neither can you hide the bride's Revival in the middle of leosia the world is a Wilderness denomination is a Wilderness they don't know how to baptize they don't know how to have church how to pray what to follow but Out of Heaven Come a hand in the form of the pillar of fire and said as John the Baptist was saying to forun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming and around the world it went seven times listen but there's some young people tonight that's walking in the way that's been made in the wilderness of leosia let me shout it as clear as I know how I ain't confused and neither are you I ain't wondering who to serve I ain't wondering what to follow I have seen his hand there's a way in the wilderness now can I ask you this and a river in the desert so everybody's literally thirsting to death and they've gone to our they've gone to stagnated broken cens and brother Josh are trying to get just enough water to have a camp come on let's Pump It Up come on come on come on Pump It Pump It Pump It Pump It pump it and then all of a sudden after you pump for two Services somebody says amen and so then we go back to the sister Pump It Pump It Pump It Pump It Pump It Pump It Pump It pump it and then all of a sudden after another service somebody comes to the Altar and then we go back to the sister here we go let's go pump it P but this is the first night this is the first night of the meeting and there's people with Liberty all over their lives we're not pumping up a song we're not pumping up a prayer line we're not pumping up a move of God there is a generation who come underneath the hand of God and they're a blessed generation and they're walking in The Blessing of Abraham they're walking in a way in the wilderness and they're drinking they're drinking from RT and well water hallelujah what are you saying I'm saying man's hands came up on Luther's message and it died man's hands came up on Wesley's message and it died amen man's hands came up on Pentecost message and it died but this is the full word and a man's hand can't come up the full word word the only thing that can handle this full word is a full strong born son of God with a full faith listen Seven Seals are open the third pull is in the bride the Thunders have thundered the seals are revealed listen church it's our time to shout it's our time to Rejoice it's our time to praise God we didn't have to work the shout up we didn't have to pump the anointing up we stepped in the way underneath benath the hand of God brother says it very beautifully he says there will be no denominational manhandling there will be no denominational manh handling in the Virgin birth of the Bride no sir no sir no sir there will be no watering the message down to make it more acceptable no sir there will be no re re quoting and rephrasing things to make it more acceptable no sir there will be none of this add to take away put here put there no sir this is a full born bride she can feed all the word she can feed every mystery come on young people you ain't got to have some of the water down Sunday school Baptist sermon to have church you are an eagle you have come underneath the dispensation of the hand of God you can feed on the seals you can feed Fe on the Thunders you can feed on the Revelation you are the generation to do it you are the generation to say no sir I will not make this message more acceptable it's already acceptable well I might as well preach cuz that Devil's pushing against me what a prophet taught is already acceptable they accept it in heaven because they said we're riding on it they accept it in heaven can I tell you something else brother Carter they accept it in Hell the devils in Hell know this message is the truth well I'm going to go ahead and say it or I'm going to bust Heaven ain't going to accept it and Hell accept it and me try to rework it no sir If Heaven accepted it and Hell had to accept it you better believe I'm going to accept it in the Purity and the form that it was brought to me by from the hand of God see God has always had a witness on the earth that will be a testimony to what he has done in the middle of the age they're living see although it got down to one person sometimes God always and always will have a witness brother somebody somebody he can lay his hand on now let me say this Noah was a witness in his generation right because God by a vision revealed Noah how to build the ark and what to use to build it brother said God told no said told Noah said I want you to make this out of a specific type of wood now just any wood won't work we got to have a certain type and it must be go for wood he said now goph for wood was soft wood and it was pliable and that's what makes up the ark was a wood that could be easily applied a pliable wood now watch brother turn that and say now that's the believer he said once in the hands of God is cut down from his own self-righteousness of the tree he becomes pliable in the hands of the Builder he's not tossed about with every wind of Doctrine but a pliable that fits amen right into the word of God to be used easily now just as Noah was given a vision I believe young people that we are given a vision I believe what the Bible says that where there is no vision the people perish oh thank you Lord where there is no vision the people begin to go underneath what they're under but where there is a vision that word vision is a prophetic insight and it's also Divine communication brother B said we must have a vision a vision comes to the prophet it's the word of the Lord spoken to him now what something breaks into this and says Christopher Columbus he was a man of vision he said what he believed was that the world was round he said now watch and he could see the mass amen way before he could see the ship so it proved him that the world was round and people didn't believe it in that day but he was a man of vision so it didn't matter what somebody else believed about the message he was a man of vision he set out to prove exactly what he have a vision of that it was the truth amen can I say in these meeting ings amen Lord refresh our vision of the message of the hour if quotes are becom un common I say God refresh refresh the freshness of them if if sermons and tapes have become stale I say God refresh refresh our hearts listen the tape don't need to be refreshed and the book don't need to be refreshed refreshed but the person does because some times we get a little self-righteous and we think we know a better way than brother bam taught and so we step aside from the vision but if we're going to be a part of the vision we've got to be pliable in the hands of God he said if anything the church needs tonight what we're trying to do friends is to bring a fresh vision from the presence of God to let the people see that God still lives and Reigns and is moving with his church and he will until Jesus comes to receive it and he will until Jesus comes to receive it see then what is a vision it's the direct word of the lord it's not an impression a vision is not I think I feel I thought I saw I felt like I heard a vision is the direct word of the Lord can I say this we cannot afford to lose our vision the vision is what takes us Beyond amen I'm going somewhere it's what takes us beyond the scene into the Unseen to be able to have a youth camp in the middle of age of confusion because watch said what is a vision it's another dimension it's outside of the five it's a six sense amen I remember I remember one time I was preaching down in Florida in a convention down at brother West Coast and there was a brother come in there and brother sister I'll just say this while we were preaching I was preaching on communion with mzc and it literally am me it literally felt like that MDC was standing right there in the build I mean the anointing the people's Faith was so buil and we walked out of there and a brother come up to some of those Brothers talking and he said you know what he said that was just a bunch of workup he said there was nothing to that he said there ain't nothing to all that screaming and hollering amen and I never will forget an old brother down there he looked over and he said well maybe not in the dimension you was in but the one we was in I thought there it is the message of the power will take you out of this sense bound Dimension that keeps you from being impliable with the anointing and the hand of God when it comes in the building and will take you into another dimension see what it is amen it's faith that is sitting your destination faith is the substance of what things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen taste felt smell or hurt but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into another dimension see that makes it so real to him till he's just as good as if he's got it in his hand he knows he guesses he hopes he thinks he feels he knows I said he knows he knows it's going to happen listen I don't think somebody's going to get saved here this weekend I know somebody's going to get saved I don't feel like somebody is going to get the Deliverance I know somebody's going to get the Deliverance I don't feel like somebody's going to get a breakthrough I know somebody is going to get a breakthrough because my soul has already caught the word of God and it has shot me into another dimension to believe things that My Five Senses will not declare you know what I say I don't feel like somebody's going to dance on the devil I know somebody is going to dance on the devil I don't feel like somebody's going to go here and just get a little touched I know somebody is going to get an eternal touch of the almighty God and they'll never they'll never brother Josh be the same again can I say this to you a vision is a forecast I'm going somewhere a vision is the forecast of future events it for tells the thing before it it happens a vision is seeing something that is not as though it was until it materializes can I give the devil another black eye a vision is not looking at what is a vision is not looking at what is a vision is looking at what will be so then it takes Faith to catch the vision because the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are unseen amen they are Eternal now watch when a man once catches the vision of the invisible God and knows somebody say knows that he's always present then there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above of the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise listen if you catch the vision you're going to catch on fire if you catch a vision of your salvation if you catch a vision of your healing if you catch a vision of your deliverance if you catch a vision of your Miracle listen the biggest threat to Satan's kingdom is a Believer who has called a vision Vision because a vision will declare things when feelings won't can I say this amen and and I'm not going to read the whole story to you I'm going to preach it to you real quick Michelangelo had a vision right he had a vision of what Moses looked like brother B said he took some clay and he said with his hand he chipped away he cut he honed he rubbed it down rubbed it over he said he worked until he saw in the clay what was in the vision in his mind can I say you like this Michelangelo with his hand by a vision produced a masterpiece well in Mark 16 the Bible says that there is a connection there is a connection between the hand of God and the clay oh God there is a connection because it said they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them here it is they shall lay hands I'm turning the corner they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover look at this word lay I I found this thing about shouted it means to attack one it means to make an assault on one brother B says it like this amen let me ask you this question how does an evil spirit take control of one human vessel and then another human vessel lay hands upon that vessel and cast that Spirit out well readers not just picked it up they took a man that was sick and a man that prayed for the sick and he said they put an x-ray over it and from the man's hand it showed a visible reflection of a ray coming out of his hand and going to the other man see God knew what he meant when he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the laying on of hands of this man upon a sick man and the mechanical x-ray oh God he said showing him the light that was coming from the man's hand can I say why the devil attacks Mark 16 is because when a Son of God lays his hand upon the believer it is an attack from God you say who's he attacking is he attacking the individual no he's attacking the spirit that's trying to pull the individual underneath the water listen friends I said it as plain as I know how when we are not here to lay down we are not here to back up to the devil you are Sons and Daughters of God and deity is not in heaven deity is in you the prophet of God said oh church he said we must recognize now that we have come to a place that people are realizing that the deity and the power of almighty God is living in the human being deity is not in heaven [Applause] deity is on the earth in this building tonight can I say this the Divine hand I'm I'm I'm coming out I'm coming to my point here the Divine hand is now veiled in human hands the Divine hand is now veiled in song leaders the Divine hand is now veiled in counselors in your dorms and what is he doing he's snatching you come on somebody amen the devil don't like it but it's the truth he's snatching you see right now the devil's holding you and holding you and holding you and trying to convince you and say you're going down you're going down but when you say Lord save me when you open up and say Lord save me the Divine hand it comes into action and it reaches down you know what the part of God said he said he has no hands but your hands what is it it's the mystery of human instrumentality God doesn't come down and speak it literally with his voice out of the heavens he wrote it on paper and is expecting me and you to receive the Holy Spirit to believe that word and then when we speak that word if it's God's true word god stands behind [Applause] it well I'm going to speak it you're healed I'm going to speak it you're delivered I'm going to speak it you're the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm just going to go ahead and speak it I'm going to speak Miracles I'm going to speak deles go ahead use your voice right now speak it speak your need speak your petition speak your request he's in the building Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit comes down and are you ready for this and God performs The Miracles through the hands of his children see he's the vine and we are the branches the vine doesn't bear the fruit it Bears the branches but it gets energy from the vine and Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit comes into the human body and takes a hold of his own word it's his word through human instrumentality you know what an instrument is it's a tool or it is an Implement especially one for a delicate work so this is not any kind of work but it's a delicate work see it's a person who is made use of now watch this bam said Moses was an instrument he was elected of God he said Daniel become an instrument but can I can I bring it right here to our day and say in this age God sent a Vindicated prophet and he didn't do any kind of work he did very delicate work in other words under the angel now let's just put a name to it can we Willam Mary and brandom of the Church of the leans write these things say the amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of God now watch what brother says he said notice how God chose to use Moses to deliver Israel God told him before he went he said I'll send my angel before thee now God could have sent the angel down couldn't he he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak to the voice of a man God always used man for his work another place he said now he is the Son of God I'm just a man I'm coming to my appoint with the devil right now he is the Son of God I'm just a man this here is a perfect mute it cannot speak until something speaks through it and so is a man just an instrument just a clay but if Jesus Christ can take that person in full control and if you'll obey his calls he can preach the gospel through him he can speak with tongues through him he can show Visions through him because he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever can I say what a prophet said he said I'm just an instrument in his hand I've never seen you I know nothing about you but God knows you do you see what was happening he was standing oh God a man was standing as an instrument in the hands of God carrying God's children from sickness under Health from bondage deliverance from sin under salvation from doubt under Faith amen now I found this very amazing and Ezra chapter 8 it begins with an outlining of the heads of the families and the genealogy of those returning with Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem listen there was a total of 1,496 men listed that are all descendants of prominent Israelite families now listen in Ezra 8 they were guided and protected by God the group successfully completes their Journey oh God from Babylon to Jerusalem so it don't say young people that they started their Journey but Brother Joseph it says they successfully completed their journey and notice where it was from it was from Babylon which is confusion unto Jerusalem which is the city of Peace the oh the Bible ible says in Ezra 831 and the hand of God was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy of such as lay in weight by the way and we came to healing and we came to Jerusalem and we came to Miracles listen friends the Divine hand come down and B said God loves to take his children out of the hands of the enemy he loves by a delivering Angel to take his children out of the hands of enemy can I say this the devil has a grip and the devil gets grips in places he should never have them in he gets grips in Fellowship he gets grips in peace he gets grips in marriages he gets grips in young people come on Church you know I'm talking to you the devil gets grips in places that he should never put his hands listen what this word grip means it means to take a firm hold of it means an effective form of control over something so the Devil by fear gets a hold of a life and begins to effectively control that life by something but the pr of God says it like this he said the world is G by these two things right now the mark of the beast or the Seal of God he said now you say I got one Mark against me well that's just a mark but you never said you had one seal against you well I got a mark against me I got a mark against me a amen come on there any one of us can't raise our hands here and say we've got a mark against us somewhere but listen it never said a mark it never said a seal against you because a seal is a sign of ownership can I say this the mark against you don't own you Hallelujah the mark against you it don't own you the devil marked you he marked your spirit he might have marked your flesh he might have marked something in your spirit and got down into some secret areas but I come by here tonight to say devil you might have marked us but you don't own us you might have marked us but the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God and we are owned by the Divine hand so I'm going to stand here and say what a prophet said he said right now he said I snatch you I snatch you from the hand of the Christ I snatch you listen I'm going to do hand to hand combat right now Satan I snatch him I snatch him from Fear I snatch him from doubt I snatch him from nervousness I snatch him from condemnation I snatch him from unbelief I snatch them from questions about this message oh yeah oh yeah that devil marked you and he marked you and he marked you but let's go ahead and say it he don't own me I come from God I'm going back to God I am a gene seed of God when there is no more devil I'll still be when there is no more sickness I'll still be somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah somebody shout he owns me he owns me who owns you Jesus Christ the son of God oh God I them tell their hearts he says I pray right now you'll snatch them somehow or another through the harsh and hard words he says I'm trying to do what I'm trying to do is jerk and snatch and pull I close on this we are not quitters we are not fearful Believers in the words of brother Ron we are warriors I said we are warriors we're not quitters we're not halfway Believers we're not church members we're warriors we're not even youth campers we're warriors devil we didn't come here to play we come here to do battle we are not here on our own accord but the great warrior David the same hand that got a hold of David is getting a hold of Warriors here tonight I'm closing on this it's time to go to battle it's time to fight come on Amen don't you lay down under that depression get up and fight back don't you lay down under that mistake you made get up and fight back don't you lay down and say well I guess I'm just serpent seed I guess this is it I guess it's over I guess I'm finished I guess I'm not Victorious that is a lying devil from the pits of hell I'm walking around this building tonight and I'm saying Satan we're getting back up we were under the waters but we're getting back on top of them we're not laying down we're not quitting we're not saying well devil just carry us away I wish I had the voice of a Thousand Angels get up get up it's time to fight back against that devil there's a hand in the building it's a powerful hand it's a saving hand it's a creative hand it's an authoritative hand get up and fight back against that nervousness fight back against that fear fight back against that inferiority complex get up get up in Jesus name come on [Applause] musicians don't you lay down don't you lay down get up get your sword in your hand recognize who you are in the word come on Peter Lord Lord Save Me Brother Jay how hard was that Lord save me he had a mark against him he took his eyes off of Jesus he started looking at the winds he started looking at the waves the devil said you got marks against you but the Lord reached down and got him you know why because Peter belonged to the Lord he's more interested in rescu in you oh God then he is replacing you can I say this to you tonight we are God's Property period in the discussion sir and I'll tell you what a prophet said he said don't you on God's Property now I tell you why some some of y'all are still laying there and you're letting the devil tell you he got this Mark against you he got this against you and he got this failure against you and he got this against you and he got that against you and remember what you said here remember what you done there remember where you went what you looked at what you talked about what you did who you the devil just starts piling all these up but a prophet said oh brother stop looking at yourself and look at your sacrifice if you can find any fault in that then all right but if you find no fault in that if you can find some fault in yourself if you can find some fault in your sacrifice then all right but if you find no fault in that then you're perfect you're perfect you know why cuz it's not you that God's accepted he accepted aced Christ and Christ accepted you and you are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ and you are sealed by the Holy Ghost are you ready for this and all the devils in hell can't turn you out of there you are God's Property God never looks at you Hallelujah he looks at Christ have you often heard me say in prayer take your hands off of God's Property have faith to claim your own that's right take your hands off of her take your hands off of him see faith faith faith will do it somebody say I belong to him I belong to him you know tonight I stand here as a [Music] witness the devil can put his hands on you brother Austin he can't keep you hallu he can't keep you you know sometimes and I look across the building and the majority of the young people here probably been born and raised in the message give that privilege that Grace that God's given you but can I tell you sometimes you go go through things sometimes Believers go through things anybody been through anything and the things you go through the devil can get his hand in there and he can get a little grip in your life and he can start controlling you here and and and and oh mercy he'll get a little grip here and when the service gets to going real good and the anointings move moving and you want to raise your hands the devil's got a little grip right there and so you go to raise your hands when you go to raise it he grips or you really want to stand up and say Amen the word's really catching you and carrying you out in that Dimension and you go to stand up and just when you do all of a sudden here comes that little grip and he pulls you back down in your seat and then he starts talking to about all the marks against you and about all the mistakes and he starts talking about all them little things and so you just keep that little grip and then all of a sudden you say Okay devil I'm going to do a deal with you now here's what we're going to do they say this deals don't work somewhere or another you got to be snatched you got to be taken out of the devil's grip or can I say it like this the devil's grip has got to be taken off of you so as Believers as Believers we go through things some of you probably heard me testify this before but I just feel to share it right now several years ago brother Isaac Hatfield now he was with me there when we went to to New Zealand for the first time the week before the youth camp we had a camp an Outreach there and while we were having that Outreach there was a young lady stood up and she said these words she raised her hand they couldn't preach all they could do was just testify she said I want to just tell you about this God we're singing about to everybody walking by the market she says I was a born and raised in church church and she gives her testimony and she says but my family went through this and went through that she said but the God I'm singing about this way maker he's my God he's my savior he's always been my savior and I want you to know he can do anything for you she says I'm i' I'm in his hands basically what she was saying so we leave that and we go all the way to the youth camp and the first night of the youth camp now this is just watch how things work the first night of the Youth Camp we're on our way to church and I'm listening to brother brother W Martin sing this song devil we through you all know that song brother window song devil we through right I'm listening to that and just something come in my heart that's got to be played tonight that's got to be played in this meeting I said how am I going to play it I don't have the chord they don't have the internet the camp how are we going to play it so they start sending they start sending kids to their dorms to find cords and they finally found this right before I went up to pull pit this one girl come running with the cord she said here it is we pluged it up we played it devil we're through I went up and preached on face and reality when you come between God and Baal there's a showdown who's right and when I said the devil and God is in a showdown the the power just goes out in that building just just pitch black goes out and that girl that there's a girl falls over and she's laying there screaming holling and kicking we go down and we begin to pray and really quick we realize it's a demonic manifestation and we begin to pray and young people as I laid my hand on her and begin to pray that devil spoke up out of her and said these words you know what he said I I said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the word of God I cast you out and when I said that that devil spoke out and said what word just like that what word and I looked over brother Nathan there was a Bible and I said take this Bible sis and lay it on that girl's body and when they laid that Bible on her I said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who wrote this word he is the God of this word he said we will cast out devils and in the name of Jesus Christ Satan take your hands off brother instantly instantly with these eyes I watched that girl sit up and start looking around and say I'm free I'm free I'm free I'm free you know what she said she she kicked her shoes off and said I want to praise God in the dance I'm free when the lights come on I realized that was the girl that had the chord to play that song but it was also the girl who testified the meeting about what God had done for her so I left there with this question how could she Testify the week before and that kind of manifestation the very next week and brother Ben I studied and studied and read and read and prayed and one day listening to a tape brother B says these words he says now Satan take your hands off of God's Property and brother right there in my heart something said that he say take your hands off and let them become God's Property I said said no sir no sir in a voice spoke back as clear as I'm talking to you and said see they always were God's Property what can I say this young people God called this meeting this weekend to snatch his property he's not taking you away from the devil you never belong to the devil you always belong to God I tell you what a prophet said he said Heavenly Father we bring you this audience and we snatch them right out of the hand of the devil Satan you are defeated and the Holy Ghost has exposed you and declared that in this generation of the wickedness of this nation yet there is a people gathered here tonight who believes on you Lord and they see your presence oh Lord God I pray you'll send the shower of the Holy Spirit and power over this audience Shake every one of them their senses and realize the Holy Ghost is here and has made them well Grant it Lord can we bow our hearts together I'll say what a prophet said Satan I defeat you through the blood of the Lord Jesus and his vicarious suff at Calvary
