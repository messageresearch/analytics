[0:02] Kings and
[0:05] kingdoms shall
[0:08] all pass as the
[0:11] way. But there's
[0:16] something about
[0:20] all day.
[0:26] Master,
[0:28] [Music]

[1:02] [Music]
[1:18] [Music]
[1:23] They'll
[1:26] all
[1:29] play. Oh, there's something. Oh, there's
[1:32] something
[1:33] powerful. There's something
[1:36] wonderful. Oh, we love you tonight,
[1:39] Lord. Let's just lift our hands. Oh Lord
[1:43] Jesus, we love you tonight. We thank you
[1:46] for your mighty and wonderful presence,
[1:49] Lord. Father, knowing that you have
[1:51] conquered the atmospheres that you might
[1:54] come into the midst of your children,
[1:57] Lord. Father, you have put underfoot
[1:59] demonic powers that you might be able to
[2:02] fellowship with us, oh God.
[2:05] I welcome you tonight in the midst of
[2:07] your children. Lord, as with our hands
[2:10] lifted, as a great sign of surrender to
[2:13] you, Lord, whom we welcome in this
[2:16] place, Lord, we so thank you for your
[2:18] abiding presence, Lord. We know that you
[2:22] have not just come in the room, Lord,
[2:24] just to be here, but you have come to
[2:26] receive worship, Lord. And we worship
[2:29] you, oh God. We worship you as the
[2:32] creator of the heavens and the earth. We
[2:34] are your children, Lord. And we worship
[2:37] you as our savior and our lord and our
[2:39] great healer and our great deliverer. We
[2:42] have found you to be the counselor. We
[2:45] have found you to be the God, the answer
[2:47] to every need of our hearts. Oh Lord, we
[2:50] speak your name tonight. Lord, we love
[2:53] you and we praise you. We ask you to
[2:56] come, Lord, and may you take the word
[2:58] tonight. May you speak to the need of
[3:00] your children, oh God. May you be
[3:03] praised in this place. May you take the
[3:06] first seat, Lord. May you have honor and
[3:08] glory bestowed upon thee, oh Lord.
[3:11] Father, we ask it in the mighty name of
[3:14] Jesus
[3:15] Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. What a
[3:20] blessing. Amen. To come to the house of
[3:23] God on a Thursday night in such a
[3:25] powerful presence. Amen. How many can
[3:28] feel and sense the presence of the
[3:30] living God? Amen. We thank God, amen,
[3:33] that there's such a place, amen, that
[3:36] you can just come to steal away in his
[3:38] presence and his mercy. And we want to
[3:41] thank you for your attendance here
[3:42] tonight. And I I I know there's many
[3:45] that can't come. And I just want to say
[3:47] God bless them. And we pray that maybe
[3:49] tonight they would be able to uh view on
[3:52] the line. We pray the Holy Spirit to be
[3:54] there ministering in those places
[3:56] wherever his word is heard. Amen. And
[3:59] Amen. Tonight, if you would, while
[4:01] you're standing, let's go into the
[4:03] scripture here for a moment. I have some
[4:06] things upon our heart. The book of
[4:07] Ephesians, the sixth
[4:09] chapter. I want to read the 12th verse
[4:13] here. Ephesians chapter
[4:16] 6. I want to read the 12th verse.
[4:24] For we wrestle
[4:26] not against flesh and
[4:29] blood, but against
[4:31] principalities, against
[4:34] powers, against the rulers of darkness
[4:36] of this
[4:38] world, against spiritual
[4:41] wickedness in high places. We ask the
[4:44] Lord to bless his word. You may be
[4:47] seated tonight.
[4:49] I want to speak to you for the next
[4:51] little bit here. You know, we've been on
[4:53] an Ephesians and series for a while. Uh
[4:55] but I want to speak to you here tonight
[4:57] from this section of scripture. And if I
[4:59] would take a context tonight, a title
[5:01] for this, I'd like to talk to you about
[5:03] breaking the hold of the
[5:06] devil. Breaking the hold of the devil.
[5:10] Now, I think it's important that we have
[5:14] viewed uh from the scripture we have
[5:16] saw. Amen. that this is a great and a
[5:19] spiritual battle. And I think we each
[5:22] one could testify to the reality of that
[5:25] tonight that it's a great and it's a
[5:27] spiritual battle. Now the prophet
[5:30] teaches us that in this scripture it
[5:33] says we wrestle not against flesh and
[5:35] blood but against principalities and
[5:37] powers and rulers of darkness of this
[5:39] world and spiritual in high places. And
[5:42] this is why that brother Brandham
[5:44] teaches the ascension is such a powerful
[5:46] part of the scripture. He's probably the
[5:48] most under preached part of scripture is
[5:50] the ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:53] because he teaches us that earth
[5:55] actually belongs to the devil. From this
[5:56] scripture, brother Bram says earth
[5:58] belonged to the devil and through the
[6:01] fall the earth was given to the devil
[6:03] and every kingdom of the world is
[6:05] governed by the devil. We have to we
[6:07] hate to think that but it's the Bible.
[6:09] That's the reason we have wars and
[6:12] shootings and fighting and trouble is
[6:14] because the kingdoms of this world is
[6:16] the kingdoms of the devil. And the Bible
[6:18] said so in the great millennium to come.
[6:20] The Bible said, "Rejoice all ye heavens
[6:22] and all the holy prophets of the earth.
[6:24] For the kingdoms of this earth have
[6:25] become the kingdoms of our Lord. And he
[6:27] shall rule and reign forever. Now they
[6:30] will become. We'll have no more war then
[6:32] when he comes. No more sickness, no more
[6:34] troubles." Notice this. There's so
[6:37] little spoken of the ascension, but it's
[6:40] one of the greatest days when he
[6:41] ascended. How many remember teaching on
[6:43] the ascension of Christ? Amen. It's the
[6:45] day of the garden of Eden that sin was
[6:47] committed. All the heavens was shut off
[6:49] from mankind. And Satan then became the
[6:52] prince of the power of the air. And
[6:55] remember it says, "Why thou fallen from
[6:58] heaven, oh Lucifer? Thou no man could
[7:00] see into glory. No man could understand
[7:03] because the power is just above it.
[7:05] Heaven means atmosphere and all these
[7:08] powers were shut off because of sin. So
[7:11] the prophet teaches us that's how Satan
[7:14] come into the power of the heavenlies.
[7:16] That's how he took control of the
[7:18] atmospheres was through the fall of
[7:20] Satan through the fall of sin. But our
[7:22] Lord Jesus of course after death, burial
[7:24] and resurrection took an ascension. And
[7:27] the prophet says and he broke through
[7:29] every veil. Amen. to conquer every power
[7:32] that he might be able to open a way for
[7:34] the children of God to get into a
[7:36] heavenly atmosphere. And of course,
[7:38] Ephesians starts begins with Amen. And
[7:41] we are seated in heavenly places in
[7:44] Christ Jesus. Now, in putting on the
[7:46] whole armor, Brother Brandham teaches us
[7:48] this that we're not wrestling then
[7:50] against natural or scientific things.
[7:53] We're wrestling against spiritual
[7:55] powers. Right? So tonight, you're
[7:58] wrestling against spiritual powers. And
[8:00] it's amazing because Brother Bam takes
[8:02] it to the natural wrestler and he says,
[8:04] "You know, wrestlers, they make a a
[8:06] practice on breaking towe holds and
[8:07] things." And if you ever watched any
[8:09] wrestling or you know anything about
[8:10] wrestling or just ever fought as a kid,
[8:13] somebody get you in a real hold. And if
[8:15] you haven't trained to know how to break
[8:17] the hold, they can get you in a hold
[8:19] till you submit. And that's all that
[8:20] that's all there is to the fight. But
[8:22] the prophet says, "See, but these men
[8:24] doing knowing they rrestle, they they
[8:27] train themselves how to break the holds
[8:29] that are put upon them." He says, "See,
[8:32] like tow holds and things." He said,
[8:33] "But could you imagine?" Now, I thought
[8:35] this was funny. Could you imagine a
[8:37] rrestler come out now with his
[8:39] fingernails polished and his trunks on?
[8:42] He said, "With gold beads around it, he
[8:44] says, maybe look like a pretty good
[8:46] rrestler, but it would be all the
[8:47] intellectual." He says, see, but if he
[8:50] hadn't got a hidden strength there now,
[8:52] that when an enemy gets a hold on him,
[8:55] then he can just pull him on uh uh pull
[8:57] him out of it. You see, his intellectual
[8:59] beads and everything won't make any
[9:01] difference. See, when he gets in the
[9:03] grip of the enemy, it won't make any
[9:04] difference or the intellectual. He said,
[9:06] "So our intellectual means nothing
[9:08] unless there's a hidden power of the
[9:10] spirit there to break the hold of the
[9:14] devil." See, there's got to be a power
[9:16] to break the hold of the devil. See, but
[9:19] we are in a wrestling match, but we're
[9:21] wrestling not with fine dressed
[9:23] intellectual psychology. We're wrestling
[9:26] with the power and the promises of God,
[9:28] which can break any hold of the devil at
[9:32] any time. I love that. Don't you? If
[9:34] you're looking to break the hold of the
[9:36] devil tonight, you're going to have to
[9:38] have the power of God to break the hold
[9:40] of the devil. Jesus is our Lord and he
[9:43] proved it when he was Emmanuel, God
[9:46] himself in the flesh. When he met Satan,
[9:49] he showed us how that Satan could be
[9:51] defeated by the word. Every time he
[9:54] would come to him, he'd just say, "It's
[9:56] written." Oh, I'd like to take time here
[9:58] on some note I got. He says how many
[10:01] times that he broke Satan's power with
[10:04] it is written. showing that the
[10:06] fortified person behind the word of God
[10:09] can scream out, "It's written, turn
[10:12] loose." I like that. Don't you? It's
[10:15] written, Satan. Turn loose. Amen. A
[10:17] person that's fortified in that word
[10:19] knows that we're It's written. You're
[10:22] standing on the word of God. If you
[10:24] abide in me, my word abide in you.
[10:27] That's right. See, amen. You can tell
[10:29] Satan, "Turn loose." It's written in the
[10:31] word of God. And and he'll have to let
[10:33] go of you. I I think it's a powerful
[10:35] thing tonight. If you're going to
[10:36] wrestle with the devil, you're going to
[10:38] have to know the power it is that breaks
[10:40] the hold that he has on you. Amen. And
[10:42] and and we find that in the scripture
[10:44] that when you begin to fight in this
[10:47] battle that it was Paul that told us
[10:49] that we needed to take the sword of the
[10:52] spirit of God. And and there isn't but
[10:54] one spe one sword of the spirit of God.
[10:57] And that's the word of God. It's the
[10:58] only thing he uses to break the power of
[11:01] the devil. It is the sword of the
[11:03] spirit. You see, what we find is that
[11:06] God is the one that would influence a
[11:08] believer uh to pick up the sword and
[11:10] fight back against the devil. See, Satan
[11:13] is constantly telling people that you're
[11:15] in the hold of the devil and there's
[11:17] nothing could be done. You're in a
[11:19] you're in a position that is nothing
[11:21] could be done for your case. There's no
[11:23] hope. You've been in this situation for
[11:25] years and it's just a reoccurring thing
[11:27] and you've tried everything you believe.
[11:29] Amen. And that would only be the devil
[11:32] to anoint you to unbelief. But the
[11:34] anointing of God would anoint you to
[11:36] believe that the word of God could
[11:38] defeat Satan anywhere, any place,
[11:41] anytime, under any condition. It would
[11:43] anoint you to pick your sword up and
[11:45] fight back. I'll tell you tonight, I do
[11:48] not believe that we are in a situation
[11:50] to surrender our faith. Amen. I'll say
[11:52] this. Amen. Amen. I might get bombarded
[11:55] and that's fine. But I will not
[11:57] surrender my faith in this revealed word
[11:59] to defeat Satan anywhere, any place, any
[12:02] time. Amen. I will not surrender my
[12:05] faith and I will live in a in in an
[12:07] existence that's not bound by five
[12:09] senses where I have to obey what I
[12:12] think, feel, smell, hear. Amen. But I
[12:14] have a soul and that soul believes the
[12:17] word of God. And with that soul and that
[12:20] word, I can break the hold of Satan
[12:22] anywhere, any place, any time because we
[12:25] will not surrender. This fight is not
[12:28] over. We will not give up our arms. We
[12:31] will not lay down and walk away. Amen.
[12:33] We are warriors in the spirit of God.
[12:35] Can I say this tonight? I I believe we
[12:38] were born for this season.
[12:40] I believe we were built for this season.
[12:42] And I don't I don't believe we just
[12:44] stumbled into this time, but I believe
[12:46] God has anointed you and ordained you
[12:48] and trained you for such a season and a
[12:51] time as this. Amen. I tell you what a
[12:53] prophet of God said. He said, "You're
[12:55] his victory." He said, "You are his
[12:58] victory." In other words, I got one
[12:59] that's going to break the hold of Satan.
[13:02] He will not be able to hold on to them.
[13:04] Now, yeah, I'd say you. Amen. You cannot
[13:07] be here as a spiritual being and not be
[13:10] influenced by one of these dimensions.
[13:14] The prophet of God said, "Whether you're
[13:15] a sinner or a saint, you're getting
[13:17] influenced from one of the realms."
[13:19] Amen. You cannot be here and be not
[13:22] influenced by one side or the other.
[13:24] You're influenced, Amen, either from God
[13:26] or you're influenced from the devil.
[13:27] Brother Ram actually went so far to say
[13:29] if you're influenced by the Lord, he
[13:32] said your celestial body is on that
[13:34] side. Amen. And I say this, amen. If
[13:36] you're influenced of God, Amen. then God
[13:39] can deal with you. And do you know God
[13:41] deals with you with angels? I know
[13:44] people don't hardly believe in angels.
[13:45] And I know there's been a lot of
[13:46] fanaticism around angels, but I'll say
[13:49] this very clearly. Amen. In the midst of
[13:51] all the fanaticism, angelic association
[13:54] is real.
[13:56] Angelic association is real. I know the
[13:58] devil has went be has took that into the
[14:00] world and the world is making movies and
[14:02] they're making all kinds of things and
[14:04] they're trying their best, amen, to
[14:06] devalue what God has done. But God has
[14:09] given angelic association to believers
[14:11] in this age. Amen. Matter of fact,
[14:13] anointing them and the Bible calls them
[14:16] ministering spirits. Amen. Brother Bam
[14:19] says they speak to the people's hearts
[14:22] as a messenger or a ministering spirit
[14:25] sent from the presence of God. In the
[14:27] message of influence, Brother Bam said
[14:29] it's the Holy Ghost that leads the
[14:30] church. That's true. But ministering
[14:33] spirits are sent from God as special
[14:36] gifts.
[14:37] Amen. And and it shall not it shall be
[14:40] as I have was told me. Brother Bam says,
[14:42] "God always had ministering spirits. I
[14:45] believe in them." That's right. I
[14:48] believe in ministering spirits sent from
[14:49] the presence of God. The Holy Spirit
[14:52] ministers lead the church. He says
[14:54] guardian angels that watch over us.
[14:58] Amen. And y'all know guardian angels are
[15:00] real, right? If you find it in the
[15:02] scriptures in the book of Matthew, the
[15:03] 18th chapter, their angels do always
[15:05] behold the face of my father which is in
[15:07] heaven. Amen. Uh now, brother Bam is
[15:10] associating your theophony with angelic
[15:12] association. Y'all know that, right?
[15:14] Amen. He's He's associating a guardian
[15:16] angel with your theophony. Amen. I I
[15:19] that's what brother Brandham taught. I
[15:21] don't know. Some people don't seem to
[15:22] believe that anymore, but Amen. That's
[15:24] just what he said. Amen. It's just the
[15:26] truth. Amen. So, angelic association, in
[15:29] other words, Amen. that there is
[15:31] ministering spirits. And the angel of
[15:33] God, Amen. See, has no more to do with
[15:36] me than it the angel is has to do with
[15:39] you. And if you don't believe in angels
[15:41] as ministering spirits, then you don't
[15:43] believe the Bible.
[15:46] Just take a few moments. Now, Brother
[15:48] Bam said, "The New Church had more
[15:50] angels ministering than the Old
[15:52] Testament did." That's right. He said,
[15:54] "Listen," he said, "the Holy Ghost is
[15:56] over all." That's the body. It's true.
[15:58] But there's also ministering spirits
[16:01] that are sent from the presence of God.
[16:03] And we know Mary and all of those seen
[16:05] angels. And we know the new church seen
[16:08] angels. Is that right? People said,
[16:10] "Well, have they seen angels?" Many of
[16:11] you seen angels. You just didn't
[16:13] recognize what it was. Brother Bam said,
[16:15] "Angels has been ministering spirits to
[16:17] the church all through the apostolic
[16:20] age. They had ministering spirits that
[16:22] went to the apostles and disciples."
[16:24] That's right. But most always it
[16:26] appeared to them in the form of a light.
[16:29] Amen. It mostly appeared to them in the
[16:31] form of a light. Most of them didn't see
[16:33] a man. They saw a light. But it was a
[16:36] ministering spirit. It was the angel of
[16:38] the Lord. Amen. Of course. Amen. God
[16:42] anoints his servants. Now, in the
[16:43] greatest battle ever fought, you can
[16:45] take a paragraph or two from paragraph
[16:47] 162. And brother Ben begins to talk
[16:49] about the anointing of his spirit upon
[16:52] his angels, upon his men. And he says,
[16:54] "Now, if you want to see it in the
[16:56] Bible, turn over to Hebrews chapter 4."
[16:58] Amen. Uh uh chapter uh the first chapter
[17:01] in the 14th verse. He said that Hebrews
[17:03] says that these are ministering spirits
[17:06] sent from the from the presence of God.
[17:09] Amen. To the heirs of the salvation.
[17:11] Amen. Isn't it amazing that the angels
[17:14] in the Bible now I'm not going to preach
[17:15] on angology. I just want to mention
[17:17] this. But angels in the Bible never
[17:19] appeared until Abraham's seed come into
[17:22] the Bible. How many knows that it angels
[17:24] never appeared to anyone until Abraham
[17:27] and the first one it appeared to was
[17:28] Abraham's uh uh uh concubine Hagar. It
[17:31] was about the seed of Abraham. And
[17:33] that's why ministering spirits appear
[17:36] because we are heirs of the salvation of
[17:38] God. Because you're an heir. That's why
[17:41] ministering spirits appear. Can I say
[17:43] this very clearly? Ministering spirits
[17:45] do not appear to you for natural things.
[17:48] They do not appear to you for carnal
[17:50] reasons. But if ministering spirits are
[17:52] anointing the church, it's for
[17:54] supernatural reasons. That's right.
[17:57] Remember, they appeared to Mary. She was
[17:58] about to have a baby without knowing a
[18:00] man. He appeared to Samson. He was about
[18:02] to take over, Amen, the Philistine
[18:04] kingdom. Amen. They appeared unto many
[18:07] up through the ages as great
[18:09] supernatural anointings were visit him
[18:11] like Gideon when he was going to
[18:13] destroy, Amen. the whole the whole the
[18:15] whole bunch of the confusion. And he was
[18:17] just going to do it with a few hundred
[18:18] men. Ministering spirits sent from the
[18:22] presence of God. See angels anointed to
[18:25] bring you the word of God. Amen. to
[18:28] cause you to believe the word of God.
[18:31] Now, I know sometimes you I've got a lot
[18:33] here, so I'll run quickly, but I'll say
[18:35] this. Sometimes when you're sitting in a
[18:37] service and some people say, "Well,
[18:39] amen. I maybe you maybe you really
[18:40] didn't feel anything like you're
[18:42] thinking emotional, but something
[18:44] settled in your heart and and you really
[18:47] said, "Man, I believe that's the truth."
[18:48] Do you know that's the presence of
[18:50] angelic association?
[18:53] Do you know that settled thing that
[18:55] settles in your heart that says that's
[18:57] the truth? That's angelic association.
[19:00] That's God anointing to you what you're
[19:03] hearing is the truth. Is that right?
[19:06] It's God revealing to you. See what it
[19:09] is? It's causing the word to be
[19:11] anointed. How many's ever had a
[19:12] revelation in church? You sitting there
[19:14] and the power of God is coming and amen.
[19:17] We've shook and we've spoken in tongues
[19:19] and we've shouted, we've enjoyed and
[19:21] those are blessings of God that come and
[19:22] I I do that a lot. So, I'm not speaking
[19:25] against that and please never do from
[19:26] this pull pit cuz we believe of that
[19:28] around here. Amen. But there are times
[19:30] you're sitting in the service and it's
[19:32] just a preaching of the word opens up a
[19:34] channel of revelation to you and all of
[19:37] a sudden it's just like a preacher said
[19:39] something and a door opened and you just
[19:42] step into that door and it feels like
[19:44] it's just you and him for a few minutes
[19:46] and and all of a sudden the word is
[19:48] coming so powerful. What is it? It's
[19:50] revelation and it's opening the door of
[19:53] opportunity. It's opening the door of
[19:55] deliverance. It's opened the door of
[19:57] healing because real revelation is what
[20:00] defeats the devil. That's what really
[20:04] defeats the devil is revelation.
[20:05] Revelation is powerful, church. When you
[20:08] get a revelation of the word that is
[20:10] true, it's the most powerful force on
[20:13] the earth is revelation.
[20:16] And revelation, see, but Satan would get
[20:19] to the carnal mind if he could. But the
[20:22] prophet of God says it like this. He
[20:24] says, "See, now here's the thing." He
[20:26] says, "No wonder the carnal mind doesn't
[20:28] know it because it's Satan in that
[20:30] carnal mind." But Satan is exposed and
[20:33] he does not want himself exposed. Now,
[20:37] what happens is whenever revelation
[20:39] comes, it exposes the devil. You know, I
[20:42] I I when I was a kid, now I'm going to
[20:44] fess up right here, but when I was a
[20:45] kid, I played some cards with some old
[20:47] boys, and they was some pretty big
[20:48] bluffs that like to play cards, you
[20:50] know. Amen. But the worst thing that
[20:52] could happen to somebody bluffing is you
[20:54] find out they ain't got nothing.
[20:57] As long as you don't know what they're
[20:58] holding, they can run a big bluff. And
[21:00] usually bluffers will bet more than
[21:03] somebody that don't have. I won't preach
[21:04] to you about betting tonight, but but
[21:06] but but it but it exposes something. It
[21:09] it exposes, you know, it's like somebody
[21:12] running around, they act like they're
[21:13] great big and then all of a sudden
[21:14] something is exposed about them that
[21:16] that takes the air right out of them.
[21:18] See? Amen. And the devil likes to play
[21:20] like he's big. He likes to really put it
[21:23] on like he's big. He likes to really
[21:25] brag it out like he's a really big guy.
[21:28] Amen. But the devil ain't nothing but a
[21:30] bluff. Amen. And this word of God will
[21:33] expose that devil and let you know he
[21:36] ain't nothing but a bluff. He has no He
[21:39] has no He has no power.
[21:42] He has no power. He has no ability. It
[21:45] was taken from him at the cross. And the
[21:48] prophet of God said, "That's why he
[21:50] hates those two books of the Bible real
[21:52] bad." Amen. The prophet of God said,
[21:54] "See, he attacks them." Now, watch what
[21:56] he does. Have you ever noticed how Satan
[21:58] hates two books of this Bible more than
[21:59] others? And through liberal theologians
[22:03] and pseudocientists, he's always
[22:05] attacking that book of Genesis and that
[22:08] book of Revelation. So, it's the devil
[22:10] attacking through education. Watch. You
[22:12] send a kid to school and the first thing
[22:14] they attack is creative power. and they
[22:16] could and they want to send your kid
[22:17] back as if God didn't create the earth
[22:19] or as if if it really did if Noah didn't
[22:22] really build an ark and save and amen
[22:24] they try to go through all kinds of
[22:26] ideas and all that what is it pseudo
[22:28] scientist attacking amen the scripture
[22:31] because the book of Genesis tells you
[22:33] the beginning of the devil look if you
[22:35] can know the beginning of something and
[22:37] you can know the end of something then
[22:39] you lose your fear of what you're
[22:41] dealing with Satan we know where you
[22:43] come from we know where God cursed you.
[22:46] We know when God threw you out of
[22:48] heavens. And I can read in the back of
[22:50] this book what's going to happen to you
[22:52] in the end. And he hates this book of
[22:54] Revelation. But it says that he is cast
[22:57] into the lake of fire. Amen. After he's
[23:00] bound up for a thousand years. So we're
[23:02] going to put him in chains and then for
[23:04] a thousand years he'll be powerless on
[23:07] the millennium. But at the end of that a
[23:09] white throne judgment. Amen. I don't
[23:11] know about you, but I want to be there.
[23:13] I want to stand on the banks of that
[23:15] burning lake and watch God cast that
[23:18] devil in the lake of fire and every hurt
[23:20] and every mean and evil thing that he's
[23:23] ever done to God's people. Amen. There's
[23:25] a payday coming at the end of the road.
[23:28] That's all right, devil. You throw all
[23:30] you got at us right now. But one day,
[23:33] amen, we're going to throw you in that
[23:34] lake of fire and our God will annihilate
[23:37] you and everything about you. Amen.
[23:40] You're going to be finished. But there's
[23:42] a bride setting here that is eternal as
[23:45] God is eternal. And we'll sit in
[23:47] eternity throughout eternity and talk
[23:50] about the glory and the power of our
[23:53] risen God. Our worship is not cheap. We
[23:57] might go through some things, but we
[23:59] will worship throughout eternity because
[24:02] he's our God. And we know that devil and
[24:05] who he is and where he come from.
[24:09] That's right. He hates it. And he
[24:11] attacks these two books. That's right.
[24:13] Because it tells his origin, how he's
[24:16] been, his destruction, and the way he
[24:18] attacks. He hates to be exposed.
[24:22] Because these books exposes what he is.
[24:26] Isn't that
[24:27] something? Now, Jesus told Satan, "You
[24:30] have no part and I have no part in you."
[24:32] The devil would like to prove that
[24:34] different, but he cannot. He does all he
[24:37] can to destroy confidence in the word.
[24:40] That's his tactic. Destroy confidence in
[24:43] the word. But when the church
[24:44] disbelieves Satan and believes the
[24:47] spirit revelation of the word, the gates
[24:50] of hell will never prevail against her.
[24:53] Now, brother Bam said, "Let me bring it
[24:55] into my own ministry if you don't mind."
[24:58] You know, the gift in my life is
[24:59] supernatural and a gift whereby the Holy
[25:02] Spirit is able to discern diseases and
[25:03] the thoughts of men's heart and other
[25:05] hidden things that only God could know
[25:07] and then reveal to me. And I wished I
[25:09] could stand I wished you could stand
[25:11] with me and see the faces of people when
[25:14] Satan knows he's going to be exposed.
[25:17] Now, it isn't the people that I'm
[25:19] talking about. It's Satan that's got a
[25:21] hold in their lives through sin and
[25:23] indifference and disease. But you should
[25:26] see their faces when Satan knows he's
[25:29] going to be exposed. The most peculiar
[25:31] changes come over people's countenances
[25:33] because Satan is afraid.
[25:36] He knows that the spirit of God is about
[25:38] to let the people know of his works.
[25:41] That's why he hates these meetings so
[25:44] much.
[25:46] I guarantee he don't like these
[25:47] meetings.
[25:49] I guarantee he don't like these meetings
[25:51] that pull the covers off of him. When
[25:53] names are called and diseases are
[25:55] revealed, Satan hates it. What is it?
[25:58] It's not mind reading. It's not
[26:00] telepathy. It's not witchcraft. It's a
[26:03] revelation of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[26:06] Now, of course, they'll call it
[26:08] everything to keep you from saying it's
[26:10] God. Amen. But it really is God. Now,
[26:14] here's the thing is that when God
[26:16] reveals it by the Holy Ghost, Amen. Do
[26:19] y'all know there's not going to be
[26:20] another Calvary, right? But this time,
[26:24] Satan is defeated just like he was at
[26:26] Calvary, but it's by revelation. That's
[26:29] why that the ministry of William Brham
[26:32] takes us back to the power of Calvary
[26:35] because it unfolds the mystery and
[26:37] exposes the demon for what he is and
[26:40] puts the revelation back in the church
[26:43] and breaks the hold that Satan has on
[26:46] the people by his unbelief. Amen. Now
[26:50] watch this. Brother Bam says, "Listen
[26:51] now. Satan is trying to hold these
[26:53] people and the only way he could do it
[26:57] is by unbelief."
[26:59] And I condemn unbelief. Satan, you've
[27:02] lost the battle. You're exposed. Come
[27:05] out of this people. Now watch Brother
[27:08] Brandham. He only his ministry was a
[27:12] ministry in the realm of spirit. Brother
[27:15] Bam's ministry was not a a ministry in
[27:18] the realm of intellectual. He wasn't he
[27:21] he it wasn't it wasn't in the educated.
[27:23] It wasn't in the society. Y'all all
[27:26] heard brother Bam talk about how when he
[27:28] stood one day waiting on a a building
[27:30] for his crowd to come in cuz another man
[27:32] was speaking and he said I stood there
[27:34] and waited and he said and when that
[27:36] man's crowd come out of the building he
[27:38] said it was high society and
[27:40] well-dressed and everything was
[27:42] wonderful and well well just great
[27:45] people educated and the highest part of
[27:48] a society. He said but then here come my
[27:51] people. He said, "Lame and blot and
[27:54] crippled and insane and sick." And he
[27:58] said, "Everything come in to my to my
[28:01] meetings." Now, somebody said something
[28:03] one time. They said, "Well, it seemed
[28:04] like we got a lot of a lot of bad cases
[28:07] around the message of the hour, you
[28:09] know, and they were kind of throwing off
[28:10] on it." And we were sitting at a table
[28:12] and they were kind of throwing off on
[28:13] message people. Well, I I have to be
[28:15] honest. It kind of bothers me when
[28:17] somebody starts making fun of message
[28:18] people cuz I uh I'm one of them, you
[28:22] know. Amen. And and and and brother
[28:24] Menow Fzen was sitting there and brother
[28:26] Menow said something and he probably
[28:28] don't want me quoting him, but I'm going
[28:29] to quote him. But but he said he said
[28:31] something very powerful. He said to the
[28:33] brother, he said, "Listen, I know what
[28:35] you're saying." He said, "But listen,
[28:37] this message gives hope to everybody."
[28:40] Amen. Now in education, an intellectual
[28:43] church can only give hope to somebody in
[28:45] education and intellect. But the message
[28:48] of the hour offers hope that no longer h
[28:52] no longer how long the devil's had a
[28:54] hold on you. This message offers hope
[28:57] that you can break the power of it. No,
[28:59] no matter what kind of no matter what
[29:02] kind of family you were born to, this
[29:04] message offers hope. I don't care if
[29:07] your daddy was a drunk and your mama was
[29:09] a Harley. This message offers hope. It
[29:12] offers hope to your life. It It offers
[29:15] hope to your homes. It opens offers hope
[29:18] into your life because this message has
[29:21] a power in it that that can break the
[29:24] hold that the devil has on you. Listen,
[29:27] if it's a genetic hold, there's a power
[29:30] in this message to break the genetic
[29:32] curses that are carried down through
[29:35] your life. There's a power in this
[29:37] message and a break temper and
[29:39] stubbornness and pride and it's captured
[29:42] your whole family, but you don't have to
[29:44] carry it. There's a God here to expose
[29:48] and it come from the pits of hell and
[29:50] you can walk out of this building
[29:52] tonight free. You can walk out of here
[29:55] with no hold upon you tonight because
[29:58] this message brings hope.
[30:02] Nobody is outside of the power of hope
[30:05] with this message. It can bring hope. It
[30:09] can bring life because it operates in
[30:12] the realm of the spirit.
[30:17] See, brother Bam says when it comes time
[30:19] for God to use me, he takes me somewhere
[30:24] I don't know nothing about. And when I'm
[30:26] coming back, I lose sight of places and
[30:28] times. But that's where it speaks to me.
[30:32] There's a land beyond the river they
[30:33] call the sweet forever and a place where
[30:36] here on earth we can rise into a spirit
[30:39] realm. There's a place where we can go.
[30:43] I I love how brother Bam says it. I wish
[30:45] tonight that everyone would try to
[30:47] understand closely the angel of the Lord
[30:51] and his great mission and his work here
[30:54] on the earth. Now, we know he's here,
[30:57] but what his commission and what is the
[31:00] work that he had on the earth? His work
[31:02] here on the earth was to restore the
[31:05] faith of the children of God that they
[31:08] could return back to the power that God
[31:12] had gave us at the at the day of
[31:14] Pentecost. Actually, the power of the
[31:17] true sons. Now, we bring them to
[31:18] Pentecost, but I I just have to say this
[31:21] from my heart. I believe that message
[31:23] will take you further than that. I think
[31:25] it'll take you to Pentecost and beyond.
[31:28] I believe it'll take you all the way
[31:29] back to the Garden of Eden when God
[31:31] fellowshipped
[31:33] with his children in the garden of Eden.
[31:36] Now that work, the working of his
[31:39] spirit. Brother Bannam says my work was
[31:42] in the realm. Now you you doctor, you
[31:44] can tell me about your body, about the
[31:45] anatomy, but my work is in the realm of
[31:48] the spirit. Right. That's where I live.
[31:50] A big part of my life is in another
[31:52] dimension that the world doesn't know
[31:55] anything about. Now, I don't try to
[31:58] explain it. He said there's no reason to
[31:59] try. You can't. In demonology, Brother
[32:03] Brandham says it like this that of
[32:05] course Christians are influenced by one
[32:07] or the other. Now, these these
[32:09] influences of course are coming from one
[32:12] side of the other.
[32:15] Now, the devil has his prophets and God
[32:19] has his.
[32:21] Do you see what I mean? Stop to separate
[32:25] it. Listen to prophet. Stop to separate
[32:29] it. God has prophets and Satan has
[32:33] prophets. Don't just accept it all as
[32:36] spiritual.
[32:37] Stop and separate it. The word of God
[32:41] will separate it.
[32:43] that's quick and powerful and sharper
[32:46] than any two-edged sword. It'll separate
[32:49] the fallacy from the truth.
[32:52] It'll leave a man standing right in
[32:54] truth. You see what it is? Get in. Now,
[32:56] now, now man today, he cannot break into
[32:59] that realm and get a righteous man. Now,
[33:01] Brother Bam's talking, I'm sorry. He's
[33:03] talking about going into that realm
[33:05] where where Samuel uh was called out by
[33:08] Saul. He said, of course, in that day
[33:11] that Saul could call him out in that
[33:13] realm of the spirit, he said, but today
[33:14] you can't break into that spirit and
[33:16] call a righteous man out of there. He
[33:18] said, because the blood of Christ done
[33:19] away with paradise.
[33:21] So, so that righteous man ain't there
[33:23] anymore to call out like they did in the
[33:25] days of Saul. See, but there is two
[33:27] spirits on the earth and they're
[33:29] influencing the people.
[33:32] Now, Brother Bam says, "Now, he gave me
[33:34] a gift and I can submit myself into a
[33:36] certain realm of that spirit that God
[33:39] can open to you." Now, it's a realm of
[33:42] the spirit. See, now watch what Brother
[33:44] Brandham says. He takes it to our Lord
[33:46] where Jesus said, "I do not the works,
[33:48] but my father doeth the works in me." He
[33:52] says, "See, no flesh glories in the
[33:55] sight of God. It's all in the realm of
[33:58] the spirit."
[34:00] See now, now I read something last week
[34:03] and I want to reread it to you. I want
[34:04] to just barrel down on it just for a
[34:06] moment. How can I overcome? It means to
[34:09] recognize the devil in every one of his
[34:12] tricks. Now remember, Ephesians 6 says
[34:15] it to withstand the devil and the ws of
[34:18] the devil. Is that right? To catch him
[34:21] in every trick. Now, now there's a
[34:23] there's a there's a powerful thing you
[34:25] have to stop and separate because the
[34:27] Bible says that the trials of the
[34:30] righteous are like pure gold. So, some
[34:34] of the trials or some of the situations
[34:36] that you face are trials that God has
[34:39] sent your way. That's right. It's not
[34:42] the ws of the devil. It's God bringing
[34:44] you to a place that you might be able to
[34:47] be molded into the image of God. some of
[34:49] the things we face. You know, I I know
[34:51] sometimes we say, "Well, you know, this
[34:53] is all the devil." Well, sometimes it's
[34:55] not. Sometimes the Holy Spirit is
[34:56] allowing things that it might help us to
[35:00] perfect our character.
[35:02] Amen. Do you see? But you've got to
[35:04] recognize to overcome means to recognize
[35:07] the source of this. Recognize the devil
[35:10] in every one of his tricks. A lot of
[35:13] people say that there is no devil. It's
[35:14] just a thought. But don't you believe
[35:16] that the devil is real. He's as real as
[35:20] you or anybody else. The devil is real.
[35:23] And you must recognize him real. Now
[35:26] watch. At the same time, you've got to
[35:29] recognize him as a devil. And he's
[35:31] against you. But to overcome. Somebody
[35:34] say to overcome.
[35:36] You might recognize that God is greater
[35:39] and mightier than he is. That's the one
[35:42] that's in you has already overcome him.
[35:46] By his grace, you are more than a match
[35:48] for him. There's real overcoming. See,
[35:51] you can break any holds on you by
[35:54] recognizing the devil's got a chokeold
[35:57] on me, but there's somebody in me
[35:59] greater than the one that's holding me.
[36:02] And I got a way to break the power that
[36:04] he's got on me. I'm not imagining the
[36:07] devil's choking me. Amen. He really is
[36:10] trying to choke me. But there's somebody
[36:11] in me that's greater than the one trying
[36:14] to hold me. Now watch what brother
[36:16] Brandham is saying. Now look now he says
[36:19] there's no condemnation to them which
[36:20] are in Christ that not what I after the
[36:22] spirit after the flesh but after the
[36:24] spirit. And then you realize that you've
[36:27] overcome. You know what he is as a
[36:30] devil. Now you can't say I got sickness
[36:33] but I don't believe it's sickness. Now
[36:35] this is a real this is a real spot right
[36:38] here that we we should take a moment.
[36:41] It is a sickness.
[36:44] Don't go around and try to say, you
[36:46] know, I I I' I've met people and they
[36:48] say, "Well, the doubters try and tell me
[36:49] I got cancer. I ain't got cancer." Well,
[36:51] Brother Bam don't say that. He says, "Go
[36:54] ahead and admit you got cancer."
[36:58] Go ahead. That's right. He says you got
[37:00] cancer, but you don't believe it is a
[37:03] cancer, but it is a cancer. But
[37:06] remember, greater is he that's in you
[37:10] than he that's in the world. This is not
[37:12] mind over matter.
[37:14] You're not imagining that you don't have
[37:17] cancer. You really got cancer. But
[37:20] there's a God that is greater than
[37:22] cancer. See, greater is he. You're not
[37:26] imagining that you're tempted. You're
[37:28] not imagining that you really are
[37:31] tempted. You're tempted in your body.
[37:33] You're tempted in this world. But
[37:35] greater is he that's in you that's in
[37:38] the temptation of your
[37:40] body. You You see what it is? You got to
[37:42] You got to quit imagining that it's not
[37:44] real. It is real.
[37:47] It really is. It's a real sickness. And
[37:50] if you don't do something, it'll kill
[37:51] you. Are you hearing me? Now, watch
[37:55] this. You must realize the Holy Spirit
[37:57] is in you. Has already overcome this
[37:59] thing. Well, Brother Wayne, I tell you
[38:01] what, I can deal with that. Well, let's
[38:03] let's go let's go a step further. How
[38:05] many ready to go a step further? He
[38:06] said, "And Elijah," he said, "now bless
[38:08] this man. Lay hands upon him." He said,
[38:11] "And ask that this nervous disorder
[38:13] leave him." Now listen, I'm asking Jesus
[38:17] name. Nervousness is the hardest thing
[38:20] there is to fight.
[38:24] Worse than cancer.
[38:29] Worse than cancer. Isn't it amazing?
[38:33] Amen. That if you tell somebody what's
[38:34] nerves causing it, they want to act like
[38:37] you think there's nothing wrong with
[38:39] them or you just think, well, they're
[38:40] just, you know, they're just making
[38:41] something up. No, you've got to admit
[38:44] that nervousness is worse than cancer.
[38:48] Come on, church. Now, I I I put a lot of
[38:50] study in this. I know where I'm
[38:52] standing. Nervousness is worse than
[38:55] cancer. And brother said, the reason is
[38:57] because you can't hardly mental balance
[39:00] yourself. you can't get your mind
[39:02] running right. So when you get nervous,
[39:05] you can't catch your balance. It's like
[39:07] a a person that they they just don't
[39:09] know where Amen. to go or what to do.
[39:12] It's almost like a man that's been
[39:14] punched from every corner and he don't
[39:16] know what to do, where to turn, where to
[39:18] go. Oh, it's going to it's going to get
[39:20] me. I I don't know where to go. I don't
[39:22] I don't know where to run. You've got to
[39:25] admit that it's a devil.
[39:28] That is real. Greater is he that is in
[39:32] you than is he that's in the nervousness
[39:35] that's trying to choke off your
[39:39] life. Satan will kill you if you let
[39:42] him. He'll take all the joy out of your
[39:45] experience. He'll take the joy out of
[39:47] your family. He'll take the joy out of
[39:50] coming to church. He'll take the joy out
[39:52] of having children. Nervousness will
[39:55] wreck you, but you've got to admit it's
[39:58] a devil. And then you got to pick up
[40:00] your sword and fight
[40:03] back. I tell you, get up and fight back.
[40:07] Tell that devil tonight, I'm going to
[40:10] break your hold in this
[40:17] meeting. I'm going to warn you. This is
[40:19] not a sermon. This is a ministering
[40:21] angel speaking to you. Pick up your
[40:24] sword and fight back. Break that devil's
[40:28] hold over your life.
[40:31] Don't just don't just lay there. It's
[40:35] real.
[40:38] It's real. Let me let me let me go into
[40:42] something deep here that the prophet
[40:44] said. Now I just said that his his
[40:46] ministering was in the realm of spirit.
[40:49] It was not like a doctor. It was in the
[40:52] realm of
[40:53] revelation which exposes the devil. You
[40:57] see, brother Bam said, "You believe me
[40:58] to be a servant?" You do. That's the
[41:02] reason I asked you that. He told me if
[41:04] you get the people to believe and be
[41:08] sincere. He said, "I don't know anything
[41:10] about you. Nothing about you. But I
[41:13] couldn't heal you if I had to. Nothing
[41:15] that I could do to heal you nor even
[41:17] know what's wrong with you. I'm not a
[41:19] doctor.
[41:20] I have to examine and I'd have to
[41:23] examine you to find out what was wrong
[41:25] and maybe then I couldn't do it. I love
[41:28] this. He said, 'I could put you under
[41:31] X-rays, but the spirit of God is the
[41:35] master X-ray
[41:38] and he's here
[41:40] and he knows all these things and he
[41:43] looks back down through the cycle of
[41:45] time. Do you believe that? Now, between
[41:48] you and I stands a dark object. There's
[41:51] a patient in front of him. And he said,
[41:53] "Now I'm gonna put you under an X-ray
[41:55] machine. That is the Lord Jesus, the
[41:58] master X-ray. And I see between you and
[42:01] I, there's a dark object. There's a
[42:04] floating cloud moving. And I know who it
[42:08] is. And I know what it does to people."
[42:11] You're bothered with a nervous
[42:13] condition. It's a middle nervousness.
[42:15] It's upset. And you think sometimes that
[42:18] you're going to lose your mind. Isn't
[42:21] that right? I'm not reading your mind.
[42:26] Now it has moved from you. Your faith
[42:29] without prayer has made you whole.
[42:34] Now watch this. Here's a man standing
[42:37] under an X-ray machine. But as a prophet
[42:40] exposes it, it loses its power without
[42:44] prayer. the the exposition, the
[42:46] revelation of the devil when God
[42:49] revealed what was causing the problem.
[42:51] Amen. He showed how small it was in the
[42:54] presence of that kind of God. And the
[42:57] man was healed without prayer,
[43:00] but by faith. Now watch, Brother Bradom,
[43:03] I I won't read all the forefronts of
[43:05] these, but I'm going to read a few right
[43:07] in the middle of these. There's another
[43:08] one standing there. He said, "You feel
[43:10] like something's standing near and I see
[43:13] what's wrong with you. It's a nervous
[43:16] condition. It's a mental nervousness to
[43:18] tell you how you feel now." Oh, God.
[43:21] He's not just going to tell you what's
[43:23] wrong with you. He's about to tell you
[43:25] how you feel. When this comes on you,
[43:28] this is how you feel. He says you feel
[43:31] like you're going to lose your mind.
[43:36] You're upset, aren't you? Everything
[43:39] goes wrong, it works on you. And the
[43:42] worst time, it's in the evening.
[43:47] Now, this prophet is telling you how you
[43:48] feel. He's telling you how you feel
[43:51] about everything. And then he's telling
[43:53] you even when it turns in the evening,
[43:56] you start feeling worse.
[43:58] He says sometimes you just sit in a
[44:01] chair. You're doing something when you
[44:04] pray to Oh, you're washing some dishes
[44:06] when you're
[44:09] praying. Here's a here's a prophet who's
[44:14] completely exposing. He didn't say to
[44:17] the person, "Brother Samuel, you got to
[44:19] think of this. He didn't say to the
[44:20] person, you you this is just in your
[44:22] head, sister.
[44:26] You you need to just get a you need to
[44:27] get a grip. This is just look look. this
[44:30] is just in you. You're just This is all
[44:32] in your head. You need to man up. He
[44:35] didn't say that. He said what's
[44:38] happening is a nervous spirit's getting
[44:40] on you and in your mind you think you're
[44:43] losing your mind. Everything bothers you
[44:47] and it gets worse as it gets in the
[44:50] evening. Now watch the prophet detail
[44:53] this thing. Angel of the Lord, brother
[44:54] Bam says it again. You're worrying about
[44:57] something. You're bothered. You're
[44:58] upset. Now, this is to a patient. He
[45:00] says, "You're real nervous, aren't you?
[45:02] Kind of a mental nervous, and it's
[45:05] causing you to have all kinds of funny
[45:09] feelings." Isn't that true? It mainly
[45:12] works on you in the
[45:14] afternoon, long late in the evening when
[45:18] you get tired and run down. That has
[45:21] caused the trouble.
[45:23] See, what's caused the trouble? It's a
[45:25] nerve condition. Now watch him detail
[45:28] this. He's he's laying it out. You know
[45:30] what's uh amazing, brother Aiden? When I
[45:33] was putting these together, I actually
[45:35] had to go back and keep rereading
[45:36] because I thought I had the same quote.
[45:40] I I I kept thinking, I've got the same
[45:42] quote again and again, but I didn't. It
[45:44] was the same spirit in different places.
[45:47] He was so detailing to the individual
[45:50] that spirit that the characteristics of
[45:52] that spirit again he he would tell it
[45:54] over here in Alberta and he would tell
[45:56] it down there in Jeffersonville and then
[45:57] he would tell it over here because that
[45:59] spirit wherever it was it acted the
[46:01] same. Now Sister Lily sitting over there
[46:04] as a doctor and some of you are sitting
[46:06] here and you know this. Amen. That you
[46:07] start looking for characteristics in the
[46:09] natural. You look for characteristics of
[46:11] sickness and you don't care, amen, what
[46:13] country they're from or what place
[46:14] they're from or anything else because
[46:16] sicknesses have characteristics and
[46:19] demons have
[46:21] characteristics and the spiritual
[46:23] characteristic of this nervousness.
[46:25] Watch the prophet says it here. Look,
[46:28] it's a mental nervousness. The woman
[46:30] asked, "Should I
[46:32] believe when I feel like I'm dying?"
[46:37] Wow. Now, this woman believed she was
[46:40] dying.
[46:42] But when she began to talk to brother
[46:44] Bham, she said, "Should I even believe
[46:46] when I feel like I'm about to die?"
[46:48] Brother Bham said, "You believe
[46:50] regardless of anything.
[46:52] Don't matter if you feel like you're
[46:53] dying. Don't matter if you feel like
[46:55] you're about to lose your mind. You
[46:57] don't surrender your faith.
[47:00] Don't surrender your faith. It's the
[47:03] only thing that can break the hold of
[47:06] the devil. Do not surrender your faith,
[47:08] church. You must believe regardless. You
[47:12] never go to feeling. You go to your
[47:14] faith. Amen. There you are, sister. The
[47:18] lacking of it is, sister, I want to tell
[47:20] you, you It's a mental disturbance all
[47:23] the time. But you must keep saying,
[47:25] "Thank you, Lord, for my healing.
[47:29] Thank you, Lord, for my healing. I feel
[47:32] like I'd lose my mind, but thank you,
[47:34] Lord, for my healing. The devil said I'm
[47:36] going to die, but thank you, Lord, for
[47:38] my healing. Amen. The devil said they're
[47:41] going to carry me to a looney bin, but
[47:43] thank you, Lord, for my healing. Let me
[47:46] tell you what, I believe you can praise
[47:48] your way to a brand new mind, to a brand
[47:51] new life, to a brand new joy. The word
[47:54] of God can break the hold. He can break
[47:57] the hold that the devil's got on your
[48:00] life. What am I talking tonight? I'm
[48:03] talking about a serious trouble. This
[48:05] ain't something to play games with. This
[48:07] is a serious trouble. Look at what
[48:09] Brother Bam said. The next lady come, he
[48:11] said, "Here's a woman in serious
[48:15] trouble. The woman's got a mental
[48:17] nervousness. Isn't that
[48:20] right? Your worst trouble is in the late
[48:23] of the
[48:24] evening." Isn't it amazing? almost every
[48:26] one of those quotes. Those who are in
[48:29] late in the evening could do y'all catch
[48:31] something here. This is an evening
[48:32] message.
[48:34] And when is this neurotic spirit attack
[48:36] the age? It attack the church age in the
[48:40] evening of the age. It attacks the woman
[48:43] in the
[48:44] evening of the day
[48:47] and it attacks you sister in the evening
[48:49] of your life. Do you see it? It's an
[48:52] evening time distraction. It's an
[48:55] evening time spirit. But in the evening
[48:58] time, there shall be light. There'll be
[49:01] something that'll break the towhold that
[49:03] the devil places on your life. That's
[49:06] right. Amen. Long about the evening.
[49:09] Watch what he says. Long towards night,
[49:11] you get a little gloomy and worried and
[49:14] you get so weak that you could hardly
[49:17] stand up. Now, I want you to watch this.
[49:20] Amen. She's She's got plenty to eat.
[49:23] Everything's good around her life. No
[49:25] real reason. And she's wondering why in
[49:28] the evening am I so weak that I have to
[49:30] sit down. I can't hardly stand up. I've
[49:33] had people tell me, "By the way, I can't
[49:35] even get out of the bed and the doctors
[49:36] can't find anything wrong with me."
[49:38] Listen, you are sadly mistaken to not
[49:41] think that neurotics and nervousness of
[49:44] mind can't put you in a bed.
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:48] Listen, you can get so nervous. Now, I'm
[49:50] talking from experience, folks. You can
[49:52] get nervous enough that you can't get
[49:54] out of your bed. You can get nervous
[49:56] enough that you can't remember what your
[49:58] name is. You can't think about what
[50:00] tomorrow is. What am I doing? I'm
[50:02] identifying something to you. Get weak.
[50:05] You can't hardly stand up. You have to
[50:08] sit down. Is that right? Now watch him
[50:12] detail it and then ask the patient, "Is
[50:14] that is that right? Is that's what's
[50:16] happening to you? You're just all tore
[50:19] up now. What is it, lady? It's nothing
[50:22] to hurt you. It's a premature change of
[50:27] life. This woman's premature change of
[50:30] life, menopause, it's a gloomy shadow
[50:33] and it's nothing but a lie of the devil.
[50:37] Can you believe a lie could cause that
[50:40] kind of trouble in your body? Can you
[50:42] believe a lie could cause that kind of
[50:44] affliction to a human body where they
[50:47] got to sit down and they get weary and
[50:49] tired and they can't stand it. Listen, I
[50:51] know people say, "Well, brother Wayne,
[50:52] you've lost your mind." No. Amen. You're
[50:54] spirit first. And if you go back to the
[50:56] Garden of Eden, it was one lie that
[50:59] through mankind into mortal beings. All
[51:01] death, all sickness, everything come
[51:04] from one lie. And when Satan begins to
[51:07] lie to you and you begin to just say,
[51:10] "Well, it's just my feelings or it's
[51:12] just some little thing or it's just the
[51:15] way I feel or it's now watch what he's
[51:17] saying. You're worried about something."
[51:19] Testimony. Another one. You're worried
[51:20] about something. You're all bothered and
[51:22] you're
[51:23] upset. It's a nervousness for one thing.
[51:27] You're real nervous, aren't you? Of a
[51:30] mental nervousness. Now watch him
[51:32] separating. Yeah. It's a mental
[51:34] nervousness. See, it's kind of causing
[51:37] you to have funny feelings. Isn't that
[51:40] true? Mainly, it works on you in the
[51:43] afternoon.
[51:46] Amen. Along about the time you get tired
[51:48] and run down, do you now believe? Here's
[51:51] a woman really in serious trouble. She's
[51:53] got a minister nervousness. Isn't that
[51:55] right, lady? Your worst trouble is late
[51:58] in the evening, long towards the night,
[51:59] gloomy and worried, and you get real
[52:01] weak.
[52:02] Oh my. Our hope is in God. 1956. You're
[52:06] suffering with a nervous condition.
[52:08] Isn't that right? It's a mental
[52:10] nervousness. Isn't that right? And it's
[52:12] caused you great trouble. You get real
[52:17] weak. Now you said, "What are you
[52:18] doing?" I'm showing you that the
[52:20] characteristics of a nervous spirit
[52:23] causes weakness in the body. Yes, sir.
[52:27] Yes, sir.
[52:28] It'll cause somebody to lay down and not
[52:31] know how to get up.
[52:35] Listen now. Amen. You're suffering with
[52:37] a nervous condition and mental
[52:38] nervousness. It's caused you great
[52:40] trouble. You get real weak, don't you?
[52:44] But you do quite a bit of praying to try
[52:46] to get over this. Listen to Prophet
[52:48] detailing this now. You were
[52:50] disappointed recently. You were
[52:52] disappointed in the meeting last night.
[52:53] I'd made another altar call. You had a
[52:56] prayer card last night and didn't get
[52:57] one tonight. Isn't that right? Then
[53:00] raise your to your feet. Jesus Christ
[53:04] has healed you where you're sitting.
[53:09] Greater than Solomon. You're suffering
[53:11] with an extreme nervous condition. You
[53:13] got a mental nervousness. And your worst
[53:16] time is in the evening. You get real
[53:19] weak and set down
[53:22] again and again and again and again. You
[53:26] hate to see the sun go down.
[53:29] It makes streaks in the skies. And I can
[53:32] see you hide your face from it. And
[53:36] Satan's been telling you, you're going
[53:38] to lose your mind. He's a liar.
[53:43] Glory. Here's a prophet. He's a liar.
[53:47] I tell you, somebody say it. You're a
[53:49] liar, devil.
[53:51] Amen. You see what it is? Amen. There it
[53:53] is, brother man. I'm detailing this
[53:55] spirit. Let's go again. Amen. You're
[53:57] bothered with a nervous trouble. It's a
[53:59] mental nervousness. You get real weak.
[54:02] You suffer with
[54:04] spells, especially late in the
[54:06] afternoon.
[54:08] Even Satan has told you you're going to
[54:10] lose your mind. But it's a lie.
[54:14] You're going to be well.
[54:19] Hallelujah. Let's go. Jehovah Gyra.
[54:21] You're a Christian, aren't
[54:23] you? He says, "Listen now. Here's a
[54:26] picture. You're a Christian, aren't you?
[54:28] You're here for me to pray for you. You
[54:31] have an extreme nervous case that causes
[54:33] you to have dizzy spells." That's true.
[54:37] Of course, you were healed when that
[54:40] struck you.
[54:45] See, you're you're here to see me
[54:48] because you're having dizzy spells.
[54:51] I'll tell you what's wrong with you. You
[54:53] got an extreme nervous condition.
[54:56] And the woman hearing the prophet
[55:00] believed him. He said, "When it struck
[55:02] you, you were healed."
[55:05] He never laid his hand on her. What did
[55:07] he do? He exposed the devil.
[55:11] Her faith broke the hold. It's just a
[55:14] nervous spirit.
[55:16] Do you see what it did? It broke it.
[55:18] Brother Bam said she was healed when it
[55:20] struck her. Now watch a prophet now.
[55:22] He's going to he's going to really tear
[55:24] this thing up. You think you got
[55:27] everything wrong with you. Talking to a
[55:30] woman now. You got heart
[55:33] trouble, but that heart trouble is
[55:35] caused from indigestion.
[55:38] Yeah, you have it worse when you lay
[55:40] down after eating. Your whole trouble is
[55:44] nervousness.
[55:46] It's a mental nervousness, too. See, I
[55:49] see you're holding your head and walking
[55:51] around and sometimes you think you've
[55:54] lost your mind.
[55:56] Dizzy, heart trouble, stomach trouble,
[56:00] I'm weak, I'm tired.
[56:03] It's nervousness. Yeah.
[56:06] Put a light on it.
[56:08] It's worse than cancer.
[56:13] Now watch this. Do you believe me with
[56:16] all your heart? You're a very nervous
[56:19] person. Not nervous in shaking and
[56:21] jumping, but you're nervous with a
[56:23] mental nervousness because you're a deep
[56:26] thinker. Yeah. Now watch. Now watch,
[56:28] Brother Brandham. In one place he says
[56:30] you had menopause. In one place, he
[56:32] actually says, "Lady, you've been healed
[56:33] of menopause, but you've been left with
[56:35] this nervousness." Another one is
[56:38] getting early menopause and she's
[56:39] nervous. Another one, when you when you
[56:42] read it, she fell in a whale as a kid
[56:44] and it did something and later in her
[56:46] life she become nervous. One of them got
[56:48] bit by a dog and become nervous. But
[56:50] this one is nervous because they're a
[56:52] deep thinker.
[56:56] It's just the way you're built.
[56:59] You're a deep thinker. you you think
[57:01] things out before they get there. Now,
[57:03] watch what he's going to tell you. It's
[57:05] because you're a deep thinker. You're
[57:07] always taking other people's troubles.
[57:09] You're crossing bridges before you get
[57:11] to them. That's the old expression. It's
[57:14] your nature. It's your makeup. What your
[57:16] trouble is, you got stomach trouble. And
[57:20] that's exactly what's caused it. It's
[57:23] ulcerated stomach caused from a nervous
[57:25] condition. And it causes a souring and a
[57:29] belching, right? It causes a little
[57:32] floaty feeling
[57:34] and a smothering when you lay down. You
[57:38] have thought you have heart trouble
[57:40] sometimes, but it isn't your heart
[57:42] trouble. It's gas going through a tube
[57:45] up to your heart.
[57:50] Hallelujah. Thank God for a prophet.
[57:53] There ain't a doctor in the world could
[57:55] tell us this. But a prophet of God has
[57:58] stood on the platform has unveiled the
[58:01] thing and said it's a devil.
[58:05] Oh hallelujah.
[58:09] You're suffering with an extreme nervous
[58:11] condition. You got so nervous until it's
[58:13] bothered your
[58:15] heart. You're having a heart trouble.
[58:17] It's fluttering and jumping and you
[58:19] can't sleep. I see you get up nights and
[58:22] you're trying to get your breath. That's
[58:25] true. Listen to what he's telling you.
[58:28] Amen. Heart trouble. It's a flattering.
[58:31] It's a smothering. You can't sleep. You
[58:33] have to in the evening sit down. It's a
[58:35] floaty feeling. Funny feelings come over
[58:37] you. It's You say, "Preacher, what are
[58:39] you doing? I'm killing a devil. I'm
[58:42] going to break the hold of that devil."
[58:44] And people say, "Well, are you targeting
[58:46] somebody? A devil. This is not a flesh
[58:49] and blood experience. This is a war, a
[58:52] spiritual
[58:54] warfare. Come on, church. The prophet of
[58:56] God said, he said it like this. He
[58:58] walked into a congregation. You know
[59:00] what brother said? He walks into a
[59:02] congregation. He said, "Somehow that
[59:04] spirit of nervousness has took over the
[59:06] whole congregation." He literally saw
[59:09] the whole congregation in the hold of a
[59:12] nervous spirit. You know what he done?
[59:13] He said, "Satan, I adjure thee by the
[59:15] living God. turn them loose. Hallelujah.
[59:19] It'll break the hold. When you see
[59:22] what's wrong, it'll break the hold. When
[59:25] you believe the word, it'll break the
[59:27] hold.
[59:30] Hallelujah.
[59:31] You're suffering with it. Now watch.
[59:34] Everything is wrong with you. You think
[59:36] you think you have heart trouble.
[59:38] There's heart there's heart trouble
[59:40] caused from indigestion. You have it
[59:42] worse when you lay down after eating.
[59:45] Your whole trouble is nervousness. It's
[59:47] a mental nervousness. I see you're
[59:49] holding your head and you're walking
[59:51] around. You think you've lost your mind,
[59:53] but it isn't that way. Jesus Christ
[59:56] heals you. Go on your road rejoicing.
[1:00:03] My goodness. See, it's a gloomy
[1:00:09] feeling. Brother Bram says it. Now, here
[1:00:12] here's the thing, folks. I'm not out of
[1:00:18] quotes. You're suffering with a stomach
[1:00:20] trouble, aren't you? It's a peptic
[1:00:23] condition caused from a deep thinking.
[1:00:27] You see, it's a mental nervousness.
[1:00:30] You're not shaky nervous, but you get to
[1:00:32] thinking deep.
[1:00:36] Listen, lady, you're suffering with
[1:00:38] extreme nervousness condition. That's
[1:00:39] your trouble. But what you think it is
[1:00:43] is something in your stomach.
[1:00:45] It's giving you gas on your stomach.
[1:00:48] That nerves that's doing that and you
[1:00:52] have something wrong with your neck and
[1:00:54] your shoulders. You go to church, you're
[1:00:55] a Christian now. Now watch what he's
[1:00:58] doing. He's letting you know you think
[1:01:00] it's one thing,
[1:01:03] but it ain't what you think it is. It's
[1:01:06] something alltogether different. Look at
[1:01:08] what he's trying to do. He says you're
[1:01:10] you're a woman suffering of nervous
[1:01:12] conditions. He said and you've been
[1:01:14] prayed for. You want to be prayed for.
[1:01:16] It's a condition in middle nervousness
[1:01:18] of thinking a strange thoughts come.
[1:01:21] Strange thoughts come to you. Can you
[1:01:23] imagine that you're suffering with
[1:01:25] nervousness over stuff that didn't even
[1:01:27] come from you?
[1:01:32] Can you can you I mean I've dealt with a
[1:01:34] lot of situations in my last years as an
[1:01:37] evangelist. I travel for years and and
[1:01:39] I've known congregations all over the
[1:01:41] world and and got phone calls of every
[1:01:43] which kind and I've dealt with people
[1:01:44] and they say to me, "Brother Wayne, I'm
[1:01:46] having these awful thoughts that you
[1:01:47] ever I I'm not guilty. I I ain't done
[1:01:50] nothing wrong, but I feel so condemned
[1:01:52] by the thought that I had even." Amen.
[1:01:54] And and you know what's happened is the
[1:01:56] devil will put a thought in your mind
[1:01:59] and then you'll weary over that thought
[1:02:01] that you ain't even done
[1:02:03] and it'll make you a nervous wreck.
[1:02:05] Break the hold of the devil. Break this
[1:02:08] hold tonight and say, "Satan, amen. You
[1:02:11] have fought, but I have defeated you.
[1:02:14] You have come to this church, but you
[1:02:16] have come to die. I will not live
[1:02:19] another day with you in a chokeold over
[1:02:21] my life." What is it? It's the power of
[1:02:24] God. It's a
[1:02:25] reality.
[1:02:27] Nervousness. Nervousness. What's the
[1:02:29] prophet of God? If thou can't believe,
[1:02:32] I'm expecting something to happen. I
[1:02:35] just believe it will. I prayed all day
[1:02:37] for a great breakthrough tonight. If you
[1:02:40] suffer with nervous trouble, Amen. He
[1:02:43] said, "Lady, you sitting there, you just
[1:02:46] got healed." What's he talking about?
[1:02:49] He's talking about that it's a lie. It's
[1:02:52] a lie. Now, here's it is
[1:02:55] Satan. I love how Brother Bam says
[1:02:57] things. Let me just show you what he
[1:02:59] says here. This lady suffers with Now
[1:03:02] he's dealing with somebody. This lady
[1:03:04] suffers with. No, there's a dozen of you
[1:03:08] in here with this.
[1:03:11] This woman is suffering with mental
[1:03:13] nervousness. She's real nervous and
[1:03:15] upset. Raise your hand if that's the
[1:03:17] truth. How many in here has that kind of
[1:03:21] nervousness raised to your feet? Let me
[1:03:24] just challenge this congregation here
[1:03:27] tonight. Amen. I have prayed all day
[1:03:29] that God would break the hold of this
[1:03:32] nervous spirit. If that spirit of
[1:03:35] nervousness has been plaguing your life,
[1:03:37] won't you stand to your feet right now
[1:03:39] and say, "I defy you, Satan, in the name
[1:03:42] of Jesus Christ. I defy the power of
[1:03:45] that spirit upon my
[1:03:47] life. Satan, you're a
[1:03:51] loser. You lost the battle. Satan,
[1:03:54] you're a loser.
[1:03:56] Satan, my Lord has defeated
[1:04:01] you, you're a loser. Let our musicians
[1:04:04] come. Satan, you're a loser. It's a lie.
[1:04:08] It's a lie. You're not going to lose
[1:04:10] your mind. You're going to praise God
[1:04:13] and you're going to get a healing.
[1:04:15] You're going to break that thing.
[1:04:18] Some of you, it's a physical problem
[1:04:20] caused it. Some of you, it's a neurotics
[1:04:22] by thinking too much.
[1:04:25] It don't matter why it come.
[1:04:29] You got a reason to break it.
[1:04:34] Isn't it odd that God chose an evening
[1:04:36] service?
[1:04:40] An evening service when that devil
[1:04:43] usually bugs you the most. The Holy
[1:04:46] Spirit is here to say, "Satan, you have
[1:04:48] lied and you're losing your power over
[1:04:50] this tonight.
[1:04:59] Satan, we break your
[1:05:02] home. We refuse you the
[1:05:05] rights. It's my joy, Shelby. It's your
[1:05:09] joy. It's your rights. It's a right to a
[1:05:12] sound mind. It's a right. You got You
[1:05:15] got a right to believe God. You got a
[1:05:18] right to joy. Listen, sister. You got a
[1:05:21] right to raise your children without
[1:05:26] fear. I know Satan's doing his best, but
[1:05:30] God has sent a
[1:05:31] message. It's a message of power and a
[1:05:34] message of anointing, and it's real.
[1:05:38] And it's right here in this building
[1:05:39] tonight.
[1:05:43] So, I'll tell you what, brother Wayne,
[1:05:44] you think I must be a horrible sinner to
[1:05:46] be suffering with something like this.
[1:05:48] No, I don't think that at all.
[1:05:50] I don't fake that at all. William
[1:05:52] Brandham, Amen, in the end of his life
[1:05:54] went to a doctor and they were looking
[1:05:56] for heart trouble because he was going
[1:05:58] up a hill and he said, "I kept having
[1:06:00] these spells and I wondered what was
[1:06:02] going on." He said, "And I went and they
[1:06:04] was going to tell me I had heart
[1:06:05] trouble." He said, "And the angel of the
[1:06:07] Lord came to me and he said, don't you
[1:06:10] let them tell you that's heart trouble."
[1:06:14] You remember what he said? And then he
[1:06:16] saw a vision. How many remembers the
[1:06:18] vision? If you ain't heard the vision,
[1:06:20] go listen to Wings of Snow White Dove.
[1:06:22] And he saw a vision and he said, "When I
[1:06:25] was a little boy, there was a little
[1:06:27] squirrel jumped at my mouth." And he
[1:06:29] said, "And I tried to get it, but it
[1:06:31] jumped down in my mouth and went to tear
[1:06:32] in my belly." You remember that? And it
[1:06:36] went to tear in my belly. And all
[1:06:38] through his life, he had stomach issues.
[1:06:40] All he always had them. And they said,
[1:06:42] "Well, what's matter with you, Brother
[1:06:43] Brandham? You got what they call the
[1:06:45] blues." They said, "Ever so many years."
[1:06:47] Remember, brother Random left the field.
[1:06:49] Why did he leave the field, folks? A
[1:06:51] nervous breakdown.
[1:06:53] Your prophet had a nervous breakdown and
[1:06:55] had to leave the field because he was
[1:06:57] under depression and tried to take his
[1:07:00] own life at times.
[1:07:03] He was God's prophet to this age. And in
[1:07:06] the evening when nervousness was going
[1:07:09] to attack this bride greater than ever,
[1:07:11] God put a prophet in the middle of it.
[1:07:14] and he whipped that devil all over the
[1:07:16] platform. He himself was an
[1:07:20] erotic sir. I know what I'm talking
[1:07:22] about. But when that angel appeared to
[1:07:24] him in his old age that that that
[1:07:27] squirrel jumped at his mouth and said
[1:07:29] when he did, he said he I shut my mouth
[1:07:32] and he he missed this time. And he said
[1:07:35] a voice spoke to me and said, "Your
[1:07:37] enemy is dead. It's only 6 in long." Let
[1:07:42] me tell you something tonight. Your
[1:07:43] enemy is dead. If you can believe what
[1:07:46] I'm saying, your enemy is dead. You
[1:07:49] don't have to walk away from this
[1:07:50] building tonight with that neuronics in
[1:07:53] your life. You can, hey, you got a right
[1:07:55] tonight to say to that devil, devil, you
[1:07:58] died.
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:02] You know what you can do? You can write
[1:08:03] down this night. Take this date. Take
[1:08:06] this date. Write it down in your
[1:08:08] calendar. Drive a steak. Say where you
[1:08:10] were setting when this happened. and you
[1:08:12] tell that devil, you're a liar and you
[1:08:14] have died. You missed my mouth this time
[1:08:18] and when I leave this building, my mouth
[1:08:20] is going to be full of the word of God.
[1:08:22] A dove has come by on a Thursday evening
[1:08:25] in the month of July in 2024, and it has
[1:08:29] fed me the words of faith, and I'm going
[1:08:32] to leave this building tonight saying,
[1:08:34] "I am healed by the blood of Jesus
[1:08:36] Christ. I am healed.
[1:08:40] I am healed. Oh,
[1:08:44] I am healed. Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] I'm healed.
[1:08:51] Praise God. I am healed.
[1:08:54] I think we sang it, don't we? Sickness,
[1:08:57] you can't stay no longer. Yeah. You
[1:09:00] can't stay no longer. Sickness can't
[1:09:03] stay no longer. Listen. Nervousness, you
[1:09:05] can't stay no longer. Come on, somebody.
[1:09:07] Evict the devil. Break the hold. You
[1:09:10] can't stay no longer.
[1:09:14] Amen.
[1:09:15] Satan, I hate to I hate to tell you the
[1:09:17] news tonight, but I got to break it to
[1:09:19] you. You're out of a place to live.
[1:09:21] That's right.
[1:09:22] You're out of a mind to abuse. You're
[1:09:25] out of a person to destroy because my
[1:09:28] Jesus came by on a Thursday night and I
[1:09:31] am free. And Satan, you have died in
[1:09:34] this building tonight. I break your arm,
[1:09:36] Satan.
[1:09:41] That's right.
[1:09:44] That's right. I know some of them things
[1:09:47] come from your childhood and raised up
[1:09:48] and you still wondering if God has
[1:09:50] really forgave you or not. One of these
[1:09:52] women standing here, Brother Brandon
[1:09:54] pointed them out and said, "Sister,
[1:09:55] really what's wrong with you is you
[1:09:56] think you've crossed the line. You think
[1:09:58] your sin's going to keep you out of
[1:10:00] being forgiven and you got a neurotics
[1:10:02] on you from that unbelief and Satan's
[1:10:05] torturing you, but the blood of Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ cleanses you. Why don't you just
[1:10:09] let God forgive you? Come on, church.
[1:10:13] Let God forgive you.
[1:10:18] Put it away from you tonight.
[1:10:21] Hallelujah. Put it away from your table.
[1:10:24] Put it away from your mind. Put it away
[1:10:25] from your speech.
[1:10:29] I know what's wrong.
[1:10:35] Hallelujah.
[1:10:44] [Music]
