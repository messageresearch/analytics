========================================
praise the Lord amen there's power there huh amen God bless you it's certainly good to be here on a Thursday evening in the house of the Lord amen it's good to see everyone that could make it tonight we're uh certainly honored to be able to speak to you again as uh we've been just uh been enjoying the study in This Book of Daniel it's been a real uh it's been a real blessing to me uh individually and U we're um we're always as we're as we're studying things we're always looking looking over them and and growing uh and it's amazing to me that some of the things that you study maybe 15 20 years ago and then you go back over them and you go my did the Bible change or did was it me uh cuz those things have a much a much heavier meaning than they did the first time that you went across them as a young Christian amen and tonight we just uh we do want to say God bless you and greetings from Brother David Siler there in Manchester Tennessee he's is doing well down there the Lord sure blessed the meetings and uh we uh feel like the Lord had his way and he was uh Brother David was certainly happy and he he did send his greetings to each of you and amen just want to say God bless you from him and uh tonight if we just want to Bow our hearts from the word of prayer amen just before we open up the word of the Lord Heavenly Father it is certainly an honor to be here tonight with your children and father one more time we gather around your word to Lord to read upon it to meditate upon it father to absorb it into our lives to take it as food that it become strength to our bodies Lord in this late hour Lord you promised an evening time communion that if we'd open our hearts you'd come in Lord and reveal the things Lord it would become strength that we would feed on Lord that it would be the unfailing body word the Lord's strength to Fly Like an Eagle to get above the things of this world and Lord Lord to find ourselves in that Rapture cycle oh God and we pray tonight father that Lord your word would be rich Among Us that you would help us Lord that you would bring the inspiration the context of the scripture Lord and be more than just as comparing like a newspaper or reading a book but may you bring the inspiration Lord of which it was written that it might inspire a Heart Lord from the things that others have went through that it might be an example to our lives and we ask you tonight that you would lead us Lord that you would heal the sick Lord may you touch them that is not here tonight Lord may you bless them may you give them strength Lord and I know there's many sick many many around us Lord the viruses are moving but father you have never changed and you remain the same through every situation and Lord we're trusting in you father now we commit this meeting into thine hands and we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we're going to look in Daniel the 3rd Chapter amen uh brother Nathan would you join me again so so uh so graciously join me um it I and sometimes we go uh maybe where we read a scripture or something as where context but I just thought it was amazing if we could just read some of the scripture as we're preaching it and maybe sometimes it's been a long time since someone actually read the the portions that we're talking about so we're just going to read it if it's okay with you Daniel the third chapter if you have it say Amen we'll just read the whole chapter Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the bread thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of durah in the province of Babylon then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then in Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut saltery duler and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and who so falleth not down and worshipthe at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut saltery and all kinds of music all the people the Nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews and they spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever thou oh King has made a degree decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackit sutty and duler and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and who so falleth not down and woreth that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace but there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach mesach and Abednego these men oh King hath not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image with thou has set up then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach meach and amedo do you not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackit Suter and duler and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this manner if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach meach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach mhach and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hos and in their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the King's Command was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and menego and these three men Shadrach mhach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true oh King he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach meach and ameno you Servants of the most high God come forth and come hither then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the midst of the fire and the princes Governors and captains and the King's counselors being gathered together saw these men upon whom the bodies upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was a hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach meach and Abednego who hath sent his Angel and delivered the servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God therefore I make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything amiss against the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dungill because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort then the king promoted Shadrach mhach and Abednego in the province of Babylon God bless you you may be seated that's a powerful reading isn't it amen that's enough to have church on out there Amen to to think of the grace of God Amen and uh to hear the story read together like that and uh just been personally been studying over this and I want to maybe just continue this Daniel series another service or two and and I want to if I take a context tonight I want to look at here upon the war of worship on the war of worship and this is exactly what we're uh looking at here in Daniel the thir chapter is you're looking at something that is actually following after that Daniel has just opened up the revelation of the great image and at the end of the the revelation of that image uh you can see that the the uh that the Revelation has come and then immediately after this Nebuchadnezzar sets up an image for everyone to worship now brother Bram uh emphatically teaches that the image that he built was a image of Daniel now you can see this in the previous verse in the end of Daniel the 2 chapter you can see that he already began worshiping Daniel at the Revelation and then he sets up this image and of course I'm sure that he probably thought he was doing a good thing by setting up an image of Daniel because that God had so manifested through Daniel the god of of the universe had manifested through a human being and being an idolator uh they would they would worship the thing that they seen God in not realizing uh that the the Jew worships an invisible God and that invisible God can make itself known in a human being but you never worship the vessel that you're seeing the power manifested in rather you worship the god that is working in the vessel amen and and as seeing this of course uh what we're viewing when brother Bram teaches uh he teaches Daniel the thir chapter as an end time revelation of the Book of Revelation chapter 13 and also the Book of Revelation chapter 17 and he is showing brother brandom is actually showing a couple phases of this of the worship of of images now he teaches us that when the Gentile age comes in he said says it comes in under idolatry and it comes in under image worship he said now we find it will go out the same way that it came in it will go out in idol worship or image worship now of course when we look at this the scriptures tells us in Daniel the third chapter that Nebuchadnezzar and you notice the Bible keeps saying he set up this image he set it up in other words it was erected by man it was put forward by man it wasn't anything that God done it was what man done and he put forth this image now in the scriptures if you go back and refer to it again you'll find that the entire world was worshiping this Beast of this image of what that that Nebuchadnezzar had made the Bible tells us that when he got ready to worship that he called everyone the princes the governors the sheriffs it goes on in names everybody's going to be doing it which is an exact example that we see in the scripture if you go to the Book of Revelations the 13th chapter uh you just turn over there with me the book of Revelations the 13th chapter and you'll see that this is exactly brother Bram brother Bram ties this and I won't take a long time to read here but in Revelations the 13th chapter you'll see of course the Beast of Revelations 13:1 we've been talking about but then in the verses uh uh verse uh uh 10 here verses 9 down through the end of the chapter of 13 you're going to read about a beast that come up out of the earth and then the scripture says that there was an image that is set unto this beast and brother Bram says here of course in the in the 14th verse that they should make an image to the Beast amen that had its wound By The Sword and did live and then the 15th verse it says he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast and that image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed now you can see immediately that what Nebuchadnezzar was doing in Daniel 3 is exactly the plan that Satan has in Revelations chap 13 it's not going to be in natural Babylon that it's happening but it will take place in mystery Babylon it will be a spiritual Babylon in that time and the Bible is telling us an image will be lifted up in the end time that will be done in the spiritual Babylon and when the image is lifted up amen there will be a forced worship of an image now of course this goes into multiple levels this is the this is the order of worship of the Antichrist of the end time amen and if you study what brother Ram says he he he's very clear in saying that this is the way the Gentile age was issued in and this was also condemned now when you read the scripture here you'll find that the image of course is the image and brother bam tells us that that image is uh the World Council of churches that's exactly what it is it's the Protestant church that has been made in the image of the Roman church amen and so it's a system or an image that everyone will be required to worship therein now there's a lot of uh there's a lot of uh different ideas concerning this but watch how brother Bram will lay this together and he'll show he says now watch this is forced worship that's why he goes back and teaches that why we are not a denomination he teaches we're not a denomination because denomination ends up in a forced worship and he said there's no way that you can ever find in the Bible where God forced people to worship but if you're going to fine denomination you can only find it in Babylon when they set forth a teaching and then forced people to worship under that kind of a teaching listen no no true man of God no true spiritual leadership would ever force a certain worship upon the church and that's why the Bible said in the New Testament when it come into the church ages remember the sin of the ages that they they had the niad in spirit remember and the Nick in spirit was a forcing a people to follow a man-made leadership brother bam said see but God always leads by the word and he never leads by force in other words he he doesn't force people to do a certain thing amen he leads by the word and the Sheep of God will follow that word and they'll believe that word and that's when brother random actually puts it out and I know a lot of people don't like these kind of things but brother ROM says it plain he said see you follow me as I follow Christ and he said we follow as we follow the word he said now if I leave the word you leave me he said because see you're not following me as a man you're following you're following Christ amen and I've always said it and I I want to always make this statement is that anytime you hear me say something different than brother bradam said and you just forget anything that I said about it and you just follow what the prophet said I don't have any desire whatsoever to set something different than what a prophet has already said concerning a matter and if you hear me say something that seems something different than what the prophet said it means I just just forgot he said something where I hadn't come to that study yet and we'll just correct it and move right on CU we're exactly going to teach what a prophet said concerning every matter and and I believe any true five-fold Ministry has that same kind of heart that they want to teach it but watch now in the world system of images they're setting up an image and that image is a holy man early in brother bram's Min he teaches that of course to be the pope it's a world worship of the Pope uh the World Council of churches will end up worshiping the image that worship that Pope that's what they're going to do everybody's got to go back to Mama that's what's going to happen a few years ago they started pushing that right going back to Mama now when it gets a little closer to home is when you start realizing that homemade religion in the message amen has set brother brandom as that image and and and there are people that actually are worshiping the image of the Prophet that God so wonderfully Vindicated in the age that we're in now now of course that was wasn't exactly what brother randam was trying to say but it fits very clearly that brother brandham was been made an image in this end time among message some of the message people amen and they don't believe anybody can preach but the prophet they don't believe anybody can pray for the sick but the prophet they don't they don't believe anything like that but but how in the world could we ever stand as true children of God Amen and worship the man instead of the god that was working through the man if there was anything brother random ever had to say was don't you worship me I'm not here to make a name for myself nor am I here to make a following but I am here to introduce Jesus Christ remember in Bruce serpent brother Bram was so hurt he'd come home from a hunting trip 1960 Bru serpent Revelation series he come home from a hunting trip and he said I had to get out of the woods he said I was afraid I was going to follow my gun accidentally and shoot myself because he was so tore up over the idea that someone was worshiping him as Jesus Christ he said I would rather answer to God as a quitter as an antichrist he considered it completely an antichrist Doctrine to worship Him in any manner whatsoever amen and we've got to be careful church that we never set a man is God but remember that we are worshiping Jesus Christ we are true Christians we are not worshiping an image or an idea or a Doctrine but God is a person person amen and a person who requires the worship of every individual and we are the worshippers of almighty God now of course these these uh in the days of in the days of Nebuchadnezzar setting up a natural image trying to get people to worship of course is in Revelations the 13th chapter and then remember they're going to have to receive a Mark or the number of his name now of course that number of his name is the number of a man which 666 brother R said which is exactly the Roman numerals amen of the of where the pope sets they have it they have the name of that written over in V of Christ brother R said take the numerals and spell out the name and you'll get exactly the number 666 in numer Roman numerals teaching us and showing us that the Antichrist is the pope amen and the devil will completely incarnate him and we and the whole world's going to see it at some point amen but the Church of the Living God Amen is able to see it before it happens amen and they come under the revelation of the word of their season now in saying that that forc worship that would come now I thought it was amazing that the devil always is a perverter of the true things of God Amen isn't it beautiful to know that God himself is being Elohim but we call him God by the word of English but brother Bram said see that means an object of worship and that's exactly why God created man was for worship youall know that when God created the Angels the Angels worshiped him and then he created man and then man worshiped him but all of them was created with only knowing about the worship of God but brother random teaches us that the entire fall happened so that somebody would worship God by choice rather than by being made to worship him he wanted somebody to choose to worship Him amen and to think tonight amen that God has called this bride to do something that nobody else could do amen you have been called to worship him in a way that nobody has ever worshiped God in the entire ages now I think we've come to a beautiful time in the word of God we've come to a beautiful time in the seasons of God I believe we have come to a time of worship and I believe that was what was happening in the Bible amen the seals were opening up Daniel was seeing a for viiew of the opening of the book in the end time when he seen the stone smiting the image and that's exactly what happens in theend end time when Revelations 10 comes and a mighty angel opens up the book what is it it's a picture of Revelations the 5th chapter and the Bible says when the when the seals were open or when the book was open in Revelations 5 y'all remember what happens the Bible says that the elders begin to worship and and they begin to throw down their crowns and they begin to sing the song Worthy is the Lamb of God Amen to take away the sin of the world Amen the song of the Lamb amen remember what he said Worthy is the Lamb to take away the sin of the world it was a new song that was being written in a certain season amen and that was a season of Revelation a season now I've often looked at this and I thought it was amazing in Revelations 15 the Bible says that after uh after we're up in heaven they said they sang a song and the Bible said they sang the song of Moses and they'll sing the song of the Lamb up in heaven now if you go back and read in the scripture the song of Moses was written right after they crossed the Red Sea Exodus 15 you can go go read it amen and they they right after they cross the Red Sea Moses wrote a song in Inspiration now that song that was written in Inspiration was written on the banks of a sea right after God had destroyed an entire Army now now it's important to see this because that song could not have been written until that time Amen in other words Moses wasn't singing a song from a different generation he was singing a song about the season he was living in under an inspiration and we could call it a new song because it was the first time that God had ever destroyed an army by water nobody had ever seen anything like this before how could they write a song about something they never saw amen I I I got to point what I'm saying amen and so is it in Revelations 5 when John sings a new song Nobody had ever seen the opening of the Lamb's Book of Life so how could they sing about the revelations of the book until it was opened up do y'all realize that there's millions of people who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life there are people written from Adam until our day written in the Lamb's Book of Life but do you know that you are the first people in the seasons of the world to ever know their name was written in that book amen that God has opened that book in our season and if if there ever was a generation that ought to be able to Worship in the Revelation and the newness of song in the inspiration of this hour I know that we have songwriters I know we have songwriters of every kind but even sometimes worldly people write songs Under the inspiration that's been released amen you don't think God released the seals and it only affected the bride do you the whole world felt the effects of the Revival of the message of the hour there are songs written and preachers preach sermons had never even heard of the message amen but there's inspiration that's been released and men get under that inspiration well how much more then should the Church of the Living God get under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the power of God somebody told me here a while back well y'all can't sing that song cuz certain certain person wrote it I said my goodness think about this amen they are living off of the benefits of my inspiration amen and now you're telling me I can't take what belongs to me that song don't belong to the world that song don't belong to those songwriters it belongs to the Bride of Jesus Christ there would be no life if it wasn't for the bride any inspiration you hear that's a Godly inspiration is coming from the benefits of the bride of Christ being on the earth that would be no worship outside if there was nothing amen coming from the inspiration of God it's in that season of worship now you might say brother Wayne how'd you get there so quick let me let me just go back to Daniel the 3rd Chapter at the same time that they're going to worship that image isn't it beautiful that the devil does exactly what God does at the same time that God is introducing an image of worship so does the devil introduce an image of worship and they both predate it by song Amen God's order is song and Nebuchadnezzar is leading Worship in song Amen he's literally before he introduces his word of worship he has literally got them singing and playing and got everybody together setting an atmosphere to get everybody in One mind in one Accord get everybody in One agreement of worship amen the whole world is moved into worship by music then how important should music really be amen I I was just studying the other day I was in a ministers meeting and I thought it was amazing God pulls us in a ministers meeting at the same time concerning music and that I'm preaching on worships I thought well God just knows exactly but in doing so I found some powerful scripture and quotes where the Prophet teaches us that that's exactly the order of God for the battle do you know that God always his order is music that's God's order how many you ever read about when Jehoshaphat had seen the had seen if you ever heard me speak on that message Against All Odds I took it out of when Jehoshaphat seen a multitude coming against him and when he seen that multitude he went to the house of God and began to pray and invoke the name of the Lord and when he got done praying one prophesied remember one prophesied and got in the spirit and said that tomorrow you go out to battle but it won't be your battle this is the Lord's battle and he said he told him to appoint singers and to appoint musicians and put them out in front of the Army and the Bible records that when they begin to worship God said to them that you will not even need to fight in this battle for this battle belongs to the Lord I don't think sometimes we understand the power of praise in our music amen I I think we got gifts amen that have been squatched amen because they're fearful that somebody's going to think something or somebody's going to feel something I I just have to be honest with you I believe our preachers are to preach with all their heart I believe our musicians are to play with all their heart I believe singers are to sing with all their heart if we're doing it for somebody then have a seat but if we're doing it for the Lord amen it deserves every ounce of our heart we are to let go of our fear lift up our heads and praise God because you can worship amen like an angel can't even worship my amen it's exactly what God did he set the music out in front of the battle and the Bible said amen that by the time that the church got there and begin to praise God set up an ambush and the Devils were dead and instead of three days of fighting there was three days of gathering spools I'll tell you what you get your song service and let the spirit of God begin to move and you let people get in the service and let them sing and clap their hands and worship God Amen and turn loose in the spirit amen and there are things you are fighting amen that you won't have to fight the entire service amen but instead of spending a service of fighting you can send a service of of reaping the benefits of the spools of the Dead enemies that's in your life when you begin to worship amen I Believe In Worship and I Believe In Praise I believe in it I believe it's the truth I believe we ought to worship this is a bride's Revival amen God sets it in order amen now sometimes amen God gives us another scripture in the book of Kings concerning amen that when the children of Israel went to a dry Place seven days remember and they got in a dry place and they they wanted to get out of this dry place and they said anybody can help us they said well Elisha who poured water on the hands of Elijah bring him out here remember what he did he got out there and found out that Israel found out that Israel and and Judah had joined together and he was hot about it he couldn't believe that Jehoshaphat had taken in and was and was keeping the company that he was he was a little bit upset the brother man said he was he said he was a little out of humor he said his he he kind of like his temper had flared up on him a little bit and he was upset about the situation and you know what he said he said somebody go get me a minstral somebody go get get me a musician and let him begin to play listen friend that was that was what brother Ram said in the Bible and here's what he said concerning that he said shame on you that don't believe in music in the church he said shame on you for not believing in music he said that's God's way he said watch now the whole church was depending on a vision from God to get out of that situation he said but the vision wouldn't come until the spirit got right he said so the order of the church is to bring in music get the spirit right and then the prophets can prophesy then the Visions can be seen then the gifts can come into order if you want to see a real Ministry and an activated gift of a Preacher let the atmosphere of worship into the building under music and every Spirit come under control oh come on Church brother man said if you come in in a bad of humor you ain't going to get nothing out of that service you come in here all messed up I know I've done it I I've seen people do I've sat and preached to people and at 34s the way through service before they finally decide to even crack a grin amen they so mad maybe upset at the doctor upset at their wife upset at me upset at somebody else amen just upset whatsoever but that should have been settled in the music and should have been something in your heart released in that season in that hour because you're being drawn into worship amen you want to see Visions break out get in the spirit of God you want to see miracles happen get in the spirit of God but his Spirit has an order now somebody say well brother Wayne I'm not a musician amen or I'm not Elisha but you should still enter into worship but you know Amen brother bam said this he said you might not be an Elisha he said but if you're a musician you can be the man that brought the anointing on Elisha amen that brought the vision in the camp I tell you it's a powerful thing thank you for your for your song leading tonight brother Alex amen he brought me out on the song I thought was very fitting to what I was about to get to tonight and amen do you see that the music amen the music should set the stage the music should set the order that's why we don't cramp down the music that's why we don't have a bunch of rules and regulations and somebody said well brother Wayne shouldn't there be all these rules and regulations well I the problem I have with that is you got no absolutes from the prophet on what they should be so what you do is you set up a rule that is according to one man and now you got one man telling you what who can sing and who can't sing what you can sing what you can't sing now we've locked the holy ghost out of the church and the people are sitting there wondering why the spirit of worship doesn't come it's because we locked out the leader of worship but if we would let the Holy Ghost come in he'll tell you what songs to sing he'll tell you what Spirit to have and when he comes in the building he'll settle things and bring in gifts among the church now see what they did is they set up a music and their music led to man worship it led to imagery isn't that something amen that you can you can start approaching manmade worship through music isn't that something in other words I can make it where you're worshiping me or another or a pope or it's according to that what you're bringing so that Liberty in the music should be according to the leadership of the Holy Ghost somebody said brother Wayne how do you how do you settle all that so I tell you how you really settle is get you some godall song leaders let them get filled with the Holy Ghost and then get out of their way and let him lead then get out of the way and let them worship amen and then get behind them come on church amen when you get a man of God leading songs amen he shouldn't be he shouldn't have to fool with a congregation Wonder amen we ought to get behind him sobody well I think it ought to be a slower song we get behind him and God will slowing him down amen it ought to be faster get behind him and God will speak him up amen God can lead a man if we all come together under the unity of the Holy Ghost let the power of God come in the building and the spirit of God will shake the church woo Glory my you see what it is it's about it's about worship everything is about worship everything that we're talking about is worship our church is about worship your life is about worship it's a war of worship between what are you going to worship ship God or what some man has set up what some man has put forward with the Church of the Living God Amen refuses to worship under the dictation of any man they are following a pillar of light and they're going to the resurrection since we don't have a headquarters in Jeffersonville we'll be following the angel of the lord we don't have a headquarters in Rome we'll be following the angel of the Lord our headquarters has been set up in heaven yeah I could name a few other places to go along with that but we won't amen but you got to notice that it must come leadership from God Amen now what it is you see is God doesn't change people say well I don't know I don't know if people if if God likes music brother BR said listen God likes music and so do I he said and God ain't changed amen you said well that's all preservice but the after effects of the church do you know brother B teaches that we shouldn't just dismiss and go home he actually said that the early church they love the after effects of the Holy Spirit bathing them and that early church in the time of irus and Martin them the death of the Lord Jesus when the church was going forth before it went into Catholicism oh they love that they love to sit in the service after the word and lift their hands and worship in the spirit I have seen Visions in the middle of that worship I have seen miracles in the middle of that worship I personally have been sitting on the platform when the worship Worship in the end of the service and see Visions right in the church I've seen Miracles take place I've seen people get the Holy Ghost I've seen homes fixed and delivered and nobody doing nothing but people just worshiping God after the word has come forward I believe if God is God enough to come down and talk to us we ought to believe it enough that we can worship him for his talk and what he's done for us I don't know about you but I'm ready to worship God I'm ready to tell him that he's a mighty God that he's a powerful God that he's the god of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob my Lord think about it amen now people say brother Wayne can it get too fanatical absolutely it can and I'm not talking about that amen anything that that gets too far I promise you amen the the pastor will correct that it'll get right back in line amen but but you recognize amen that there's got to be an order to it there has to be a worship amen now now think about this because getting getting back to these boys I think it's amazing the Bible said the whole world was worshiping do you know that there was more Israelites in Babylon than these four men Hebrew three Hebrew children and Daniel four men there was multiple accounts of princes and magicians and wise men and and Craftsman they were all there and in the Bible even names 10,000 of them was there but there was only four of them that wouldn't bow there there was a bunch of people there but there was only four of them wouldn't bow I want you to watch this it wasn't until that time that we found out who was who cuz see see the chameleon the chameleon uh version of humanity is that they can move with a crowd they can blend in it's called a political Spirit they can blend in wherever they are they can blend in amen but at this moment in time you're going to worship God or you're going to worship the image you're going to worship the word or you're going to worship the image you see what it was God doesn't force you to worship but he forces you to choose who you will worship when it's the time of worship you see it's a it's a spiritual discernment one day amen everything was good but the CH but all a sudden Jesus looked at Peter said who do you say I am then it was a it was a command to discern what you're looking at everything is good until this hour and the moment that they begin to worship the whole world it was a moment that was demanding of a discernment from these three who were children of what would they were going to worship now God was not going to force them to worship but he would force them to make a choice to worship either I'll worship this and if you don't make a choice it is a choice to worship the Beast amen if you don't worship by choice it is a choice to worship the Beast do you see what it is many people say well brother Wayne what is what is the mark of the beast the Bible says it now the mark Mar of the Beast brother bam says to the mark of the beast in Los Angeles he says this he said listen I've seen guys set up charts he said take up this whole wall he said to explain the mark of the beast he said I believe it's much more simple than that he said matter of fact I only have about three pages of notes to to speak on this and I'm going to take you the scripture he said now some people believe it's in the past some believe it's in the future he said but I'm going to prove to you it's right here and he said what is the Seal of God it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost chapter 4 he said what is the mark of the beast he said it's rejecting it isn't that beautiful amen it's that simple the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there are people that don't even believe in get in the Holy Ghost but it's the Seal of God and to reject it is the mark of the beast brother B said there's your two classes then then we then we got to be careful I know I've already preached on it so we ain't going to go there but you got to be careful cuz the devil's selling everything is the mark of the now all these conspiracy theories and it's politics and it's communism and it's China and it's the vaccine it's co and it's this and it's this and this listen amen that don't have anything to do with the bride of Christ has nothing to do with the Church of the Living God if you have been sealed in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption and I tell you one thing that's going to happen this church is going to raise up in a resurrection before the Satan can ever touch her amen now now watch what happens when this when this Nebuchadnezzar saw that the boys defied his word he couldn't let that go could he just couldn't let that go so he had to single them out and say to them now it's come to you now as an individual now what are you going now there was three of them boys but it was their own personal stand on the word of what they were going to do I think it's amazing amen that the whole world was doing this and these boys would isn't it amazing the whole world to do something but there's just a few that want now I I think it's I think it's uh I think it's uh mentionable that if you read Daniel chapter 1 and you were with us you'll find out that they had already purposed in their heart that they wouldn't defile themselves with the king's meat isn't it funny they wouldn't drink the King's Wine but in Revelation 17 it ends up to be the wine of fornications they wouldn't drink his wine they wouldn't eat his meat they wouldn't dance to his tune and they wouldn't bow to his image these boys were just a these boys were just something else wasn't they they were just hard to get along with couldn't you be just a little more pliable and get under our regulations and rules everybody else is doing it everybody else is join the everybody else thinks it's okay everybody else is ready to get on board what's wrong with you boys don't you see that you can have a little better future you can have more friends and be widely accepted if you just maybe just kneel maybe maybe everybody don't even have to see you do it if you just politely kneel to this image amen you know your your life would go out better for you and I imagine amen that on Nebuchadnezzar had some people to point out Amen to these Hebrew children to kind of pour down their resolve amen can you imagine when he turn around and look now I ain't talking about our deacons here but can you imagine when he turn around and pick some deacons out the crowd and said look at there there's the deacons bowing over there can you imagine when they turn around look there was a group of ministers over there and they were all bowed at the same time and here these little boys were amen with a heart set they were going to serve God and they couldn't figure out why them Elders were doing that they couldn't figure out why are they bowing like that why why would they put down a knee to this kind of thing they it it just didn't it just didn't make sense in their mind amen but you got to find out that these boys were burn these boys were born for a certain purpose and they could not do anything else because it was what was in them now the prophet of God tells us some beautiful stories concerning these boys but I think it's powerful when you see amen that they were sitting here looking at the most powerful man on the face of the Earth they were looking at the most powerful man on the face of the Earth they were looking at their own destruction in a fiery furnace they were looking at the end of their wealth the end of their lives the end of their popularity the end of their Ministries the end of all friendships they were literally having to put everything on the line and the only thing they would have to do Amen to get everything back as that one simple little thing is just put down a knee that's all you got to do just take a knee that's all we'll let you we'll let you have whatever you want just take a knee that's all you got to do just bow but you see there was something different about these boys and he didn't even know who he was talking to he didn't realize who he was talking to these boys were the Hebrew children amen they were the true Seed of Abraham I think it's powerful when you go back and read here Amen in the Book of Daniel 3rd Chapter 16th verse he says they said to him oh King we are not careful to answer thee in this matter oh King we are not careful to answer thee in this matter I think that's powerful we're not careful of our answer in other words we've already got our mind made up it really doesn't matter what you do we've already made up our mind what we're going to do and we're not careful to give the answer we're not we're not going to make this a political speech we're we're going to say it right out we will not worship we're going to just put it out we will not bow we will not follow we only have one God that we're able to serve and that's it that's all we can do isn't that something these boys is going to answer like that there ain't nothing like a madeup mind you ever get a child of God with a madeup mind and you'll never get nothing else out of them you ever get it up come on brother Howard you get somebody don't have no double mind these boys didn't have a double mind they didn't have a mind to serve the world and serve their God they had a heart that they were going to serve God and that alone that's the only thing they were able to do I imagine whenever the King start twisting their arm he I imagine they could have pulled up a scripture and said God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind for God has give a sound mind to the church and it's a mind to serve the Lord can you think about God putting something in a man amen the scripture tells us here amen that the that the Hebrew children said the god whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from this burning furnace to deliver us out of the hand of th King he he says but oh he says listen it be known unto thee Oh King we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image that thou has set up in other words it doesn't matter what our God does we've already made up our mind not determined on what God is going to do or about to do we've made up our mind what we are going to do because they had already been taught by scripture they can't worship two different gods they already knew the first commandment is have no other God before me and do not bow and worship any other God what did God tell Joshua when he went in the land he said you're going to go in the land and they're going to set up Idols but don't you bow to their images don't you bow to their gods amen what was it amen Joshua knew you can't bow to these gods and become Victorious you can't bow to these gods and serve God and these men knew this they knew they couldn't bow and serve God at the same time amen they already made up their mind who they were going to serve and they were going to serve God because they were the Seed of Abraham do you see now take take just for a moment and think about where these boys are they're in the valley of shenar which is a portion of the land of Babylon the valley of shenar is where Abraham come from to begin with and God had called Abraham out of a polytheism of multiplicities of false gods and they took him in a land where he would have a seed who was fatherless who was married to a barren woman but he would have a seed and that seed would be of the Seed of Abraham who would only believe in one God now hundreds of years later this seed is carried back in these boys and they're back in the same land in the same places and they're being tried by the same Gods amen and this seed has already been tested through time and has returned for approving ground in Babylon can you imagine friend that God brought that seed all the way back to Babylon to prove to that devil that this seed will not worship you no matter where you put it if you put it in Babylon if you put this seed in the desert if you put this seed anywhere Abraham's seed has been proven to be a worshiper of only one God now this this wasn't this wasn't a test for the first time on this sea brother Mike when God got Abraham remember made him wait 25 years he waited 25 years before he could ever get a son and at the end of that 25 years he took him by a challenge from God to test his faith and said take that boy upon the mountain and destroy him by fire cut him up put him on the Altar and burn him and Abraham obeyed God he tested the seed or the faith of Abraham to destroy the promise that had been given and Abraham said it was God that gave him to me it's God that'll raise him up again do you see the faith of Abraham knew God give it to me by the supernatural God will raise it up by the supernatural he knew the supernatural hand of God and watch when he was tested to its limit there was something that come behind it and when it did God said to him that thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemy now that same seed that was in Abraham was in those boys and they were before a gate of fire and that seed had already been tested let me put it to you like this them that are of the same faith that Abraham is they shall possess the gates of their enemy in other words the seed that they were of was not able to Bow but rather that seed had Amen to worship one God had no choice but to worship one God now the thing is that these boys worshiping God seemed like that it was going to be the end seemed like it would be the destruction but the thing is is man is not able to see the Unseen it takes a prophet to see it and in this generation we have had a prophet comes in and breaks in the scripture right here and says while they were being carried to the furnace there was something going on in heaven don't you ever think that when you're facing a furnace that you're standing by yourself don't you ever think when you're facing fire you're standing by yourself but let me assure you if you're in the middle of a trial amen there's a conversation going on in heaven concerning the Seed of Abraham amen I tell you brother Braham helps us amen cuz you think you're all right brother B said he knows he knows what you're going through and brother Bram breaks into Revelation goes up into the heavens and he said I can see a conversation going on up there con conversation concerning the Hebrew children and them going to the fiery furnace while them boys are on their way to be burned by the forc religion of the age God is up in heaven discussing their discussion and their choices that they made with the angels of heaven brother brandom he opens up things so beautifully he said do you see one of the Angels even Gabriel runs up draws his sword said God have you not seen what they're doing down there have you not seen the pressure that they're putting on your people have you not seen what's going on and God said yeah I've seen it Gabriel he said well then let me go down there and take my sword and let me destroy him he said no Gabriel no Gabriel you just go over and sit and wait a moment I see what's going on then brother brandom said he said then them wormwood how many knows who wormwood is he's the angel that flooded the the world in the time of Noah he said wormwood run up there and said Lord let me go down there I'm going to put the fire out I'll open up The Fountains of the deep I'll flood this Babylon I'll put the fire out I'll destroy I'll show what kind of God we are serving brother B said he told Gabriel Gabriel no you can't go and and and and because I won't let Gabriel go I can't let wormwood go he said see because this is not a job for angels He said this is a man-sized job and I'm going down there myself can you imagine when God stood up off of the throne come on Church there's a time in the Bible he's going to stand up and when he stood up off of the throne was in the same hour that the image of the Beast was trying to destroy the saints of God and he stood up off of his throne and said I'll go down there myself and I love how brother Bram does it he said he went over there and put on his Rhinestone Cowboy Boots amen with his big old big old Spurs on them he said he put his chaps on reached over and pulled up a thunder head mounted it and began to ride into the into the Earth he said while he was riding that zigzag boat of lightning coming down out of Glory he said there he pass the Sea of life and he reached over and grabbed a palm leaf off of one of the trees he said when he when he rode into that fire he said he had that palm leaf and begin to bring the breezes from the sea of life into that fire and he begin to Fan back the Flames the prophet of God said them them Hebrew children were right there at the gate he said and in one place he said it like this he said and the reason they went ahead and stepped in because they had already seen he was in the fire waiting on them they knew that I step in the fire but I'm going to step in the presence of God let me tell you something young people you're never going to be a long serving our God you might get into an hour when choices seem like you're going to lose everything but it's not the end it's the beginning it's not the end of these boys it's the beginning of these boys when they get in that fire brother Bram said he was over there planting the Flames I love I love how brother Bram tells it he he said it was faning in Flames back and they were having Fellowship it was hot enough that the men that threw them in had died so don't think that the Flames had got any cooler but the breezes of Calvary had cooled the Flames to them until they had become fireproof brother you talk about fireproof that's a Church of the Living God that has become so full of the fire of God until Devil's fires can't hurt them amen the fire of God was upon their lives and there they stood in the middle of it brother B said they were in there having a conversation fellowship and I I always love this you probably heard me mention it before because I love to tell it he said they were fellowship and I always when brother bam said they were fellowship and I searched for a while what were they talking about brother brandom I want to know what kind of conversation does God have with a man in the middle of a fire that's what I want to know brother Bram said they were discussing their future amen there they are in the middle of a fire and they're discussing the future they're not talking about their end look right here in this age when the son of man descended in the middle of this wicked age what did he do he talked about a future home things that are to be he talked about a glorified body he talks about a theophany brother let me tell you if that don't make you want to Worship in the middle of the fire listen if God is in the fire then I'll get in the fire with God look at what oh brother look at what they did when they got in that fire amen that there was a there was an anointing in there talking about their future home and the Bible even says amen that when when they saw it going on the king actually answered and said didn't we put three men in there didn't we put three men in there but I see four men walking in there and one is like another Son of God somebody said brother Brandon was that Daniel he said no it was Jesus he was one liking under the Son of God and he was right there in the fires with them I'll tell you what the Bible says said though that you make your bed in hell I will be there come on Church the angels of the Lord are encamped about them that fear his name think about this amen when when God was right there in the middle of that fire with them boys and there he was discussing the future home that Fourth Man was standing there now y'all ain't y'all y' y'all's message Believers y'all know that son of man goes through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the son of man the Lord in self isn't it something he's descending into the middle of Satan's Eden it's seven times harder it's a Ley and age there's destruction everywhere there's Force everywhere to get you to bow to entertainment get you to bow to popularity get you to bow to everything but if you won't bow as a God in the middle of the fire and is standing there that a fellowship with you about your future home my goodness I don't have time to preach it but I'll say it to you like this and Corinthians 10 the Bible said with every Temptation there is a way of Escape if God has made a fire he's made a way to get out of the fire and the presence of God is our Escape in this age listen let me tell you amen these boys were in the middle of that fire said brother Wayne it must have been awful insensitive of God to let them go through such a thing but let me tell you God already had a way to fix it he already knew that he would take the heat out of that fire brother Bram said he'll take the he out of that trial if he's in there with you amen you'll suffer a trial but he take the heed out of it and he's a Fourth Man in it had you ever seen somebody go through a fire without getting any effects of the fire I I'm just studying here and I thought Lord amen what what effects would Le DEA have on the church what what what what effects will all the trials have there's some of you been through things that you would think y'all be just wrecked and done amen I I've sat and thought about families and some of the things they've lived through and the situations of person and you think my they'll just be wrecked forever and you see them at church next week they're shouting praising the Lord and you're thinking how do they do that how how do they make it through all these kind of things and there's no effect but if you read right here the Bible said that Nebuchadnezzar noted that they put three men Bound in the fire but he saw four men walking loose he saw four men brother B said the only effect the fire had on them is when they put them in they were bound and when they come out they were loose let me tell you something I believe amen that the devil amen he loses every time that he fools with the children of God I tell you what every Temptation every trial that ever come to you it cannot harm you all things work together for the good of them that love God and them that are called according to his purpose I'm talking to you tonight church amen when God lets a trial come your way he's not going to let this F has destroy you he's going to loose you from things that you have suffered in your life my can you imagine all bound up before the trial and there they out there in that fire glorifying god walking around with a son of man in the middle of Temptations and trials out there waving their hand and worshiping God their feet was free their hands were free their mouths were free their lies were free come on church I believe that there's a freedom in the house of God from manmade worship and ideas of man there's got to be something that'll loose the church this message didn't come to bind you it didn't come put you under a bunch of legal matters and you got to doth this ey and doth this te and you got to you got to fill out all the different ideas and you got to fit all the programs this message come to give life and it come to give Abundant Life and it come to put something in you and it make you worship God in tress and Oneness of the Holy Ghost so brother Wayne I'm going through a trial and I wonder how it's going to affect me let me tell you how it's going to affect you you're not even going to have the smell of smoke on you brother Levi that's how it's going to be the devil's going to do everything he can destroy you but you won't even have the smell of smoke on you isn't that something amen sister Su said not even the smell of smoke you know what brother Bram said about it he said not even one sin against you at all amen oh my think about it tonight Church we're in the middle of the greatest Satan's Eden that ever was sin is everywhere but not even the stink of smoke is on the church my I tell you what it is I believe I believe God has set it such a way that he's making us decide who we going to worship who we going to worship God or the image of man sets up but I tell you what there's some true Seed of Abraham and that seed is going to worship God can the musicians come tonight I believe that seed I believe that seed is going to worship God the after effects of the fire I've seen people go through things they just come out praising they just come out praising the Lord I watch our I watch our brother I watch our brother Ray I think it's amazing I don't know how many years he's been pastoring one you guys could help me maybe but 40 something years pastoring and still got that kind of spirit still free still free to worship and love the things of God and praise God you'd think 40 Years of pressure would happen an effect on the man but not the Seed of Abraham Hallelujah fire yeah trials yeah but not even the smell of smoke amen I tell you it's a powerful thing tonight isn't it amen amen is Beth is Bethany in here Bethany is she in here she
