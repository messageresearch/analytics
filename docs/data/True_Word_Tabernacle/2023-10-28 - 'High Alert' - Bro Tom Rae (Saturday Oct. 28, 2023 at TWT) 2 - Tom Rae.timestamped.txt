[46:27] word and amen I I I certainly appreciate
[46:31] uh these men of God you know uh I was
[46:34] just listening today uh this afternoon I
[46:37] was listening brother brandom he's
[46:38] talking about from that time and uh he
[46:42] got to talking about Moses and he'd got
[46:45] down on the back side of the desert and
[46:47] brother Bram said Moses had lost his
[46:49] burden for the word yeah and I just I
[46:52] just listened for a moment CU I thought
[46:54] wasn't that something here he is a
[46:55] Prophet but brother Braham said he got
[46:58] back there and you know he got offended
[47:00] over and he took off and went it back in
[47:02] the back side of the desert he said he
[47:04] he had lost and forgot about he he'
[47:06] forgot the promise and he said he had
[47:08] lost the burden of the word forgot all
[47:10] about the promise he said but one day he
[47:12] stepped in front of a burning
[47:14] bush and he said God begin to speak out
[47:17] of that bush I have remembered my
[47:19] promise and brother Bram said Moses
[47:21] wasn't interested but God was still
[47:24] interested he he said God hadn't lost
[47:26] his burden for his people he said he
[47:29] remembered his promise to the children
[47:33] so he said out of that fire I have come
[47:35] down to deliver these people I have
[47:37] heard their cry now friend we know in
[47:40] this age that we're living over there in
[47:43] John 6 Jesus said I'm the bread of life
[47:45] that come down out of heaven now no man
[47:48] seen Jesus come out of the heavens but
[47:50] it was the words of Isaiah and it was
[47:52] the words of Malachi that was being
[47:54] fulfilled in that for fulfillment of the
[47:56] word was the
[47:58] bread and that same language is used in
[48:01] Revelations 10 when it says a mighty
[48:03] Angel shall descend out of
[48:05] heaven and that Mighty Angel brother
[48:07] Bram said was a covenant Angel he's a
[48:11] covenant Angel to that word and God was
[48:13] so interested in us in this last day to
[48:16] send the message now according to Romans
[48:19] the 8th chapter the whole creation yeah
[48:22] this message would set the whole
[48:24] creation back in order yeah the whole
[48:26] creation will come under this word it'll
[48:29] set it back in a millennial order it'll
[48:31] set sons of God where they are to be put
[48:33] the devil where he are to be so if it's
[48:35] going to do that in the Millennium what
[48:37] would the word of life you're going to

[54:51] Cloverdale all the loved ones and
[54:53] different ones that would love to have
[54:54] been here
[54:55] here but I've got a A friend of mine
[54:58] brother Ken ardal he he says um I'm
[55:01] either going to have to quit business or
[55:03] fly because they've been traveling quite
[55:05] a bit they would have loved to have been
[55:07] here with us and so if they're streaming
[55:10] God bless you brother Ken sister Linda
[55:12] brother Ed sister Ruth God bless
[55:16] you and it's always nice to be traveling
[55:18] with my wife Joanne and God bless johie
[55:22] she has to put up with me all these
[55:25] years and you know you hate I don't know
[55:28] about you but when you hear your own
[55:30] voice you hate
[55:33] it and I I hate mine I think my poor
[55:36] wife has put up with this for over 47
[55:39] years she's going to get a double crown
[55:42] when she gets over
[55:43] there but there is one voice here I
[55:48] love and his brother menos
[55:51] yeah that's
[55:54] right
[56:01] yeah you thought I of course we love the
[56:03] voice of the
[56:05] bridegroom but brother menow has that
[56:08] reson resonating sound yeah you're right
[56:11] brother that when he things that just
[56:14] melts
[56:15] you and um I didn't actually know and
[56:20] I'm I'm just getting all my butterflies
[56:22] all lined up here
[56:25] but the top of my note here is mine eyes
[56:29] have seen the glory of the coming of the
[56:32] Lord and I thought how am I going to
[56:35] start this service with that
[56:37] song and to think that the Holy Spirit
[56:41] you Lord would have a man of
[56:44] God come up and sing mine eyes have seen
[56:47] the
[56:48] glory that means more to us than when
[56:52] they wrote that song because because the
[56:55] glory of God is the opinion of God and
[56:57] God's opinion is his word and his word
[57:00] has been unveiled mine eyes have seen
[57:03] the glory of the coming of the lord we
[57:07] are in the coming of the Lord
[57:09] Saints and we are closer now than we've
[57:11] ever been in our whole entire lives
[57:15] there's trouble in the East again and
[57:18] the whole world
[57:20] shaking and now it is a time for us to
[57:23] maybe prod ourselves just a
[57:26] bit and if the Lord would just help me
[57:29] tonight I'd just like to do a little
[57:31] prodding not not intentionally trying to
[57:35] hurt
[57:36] anybody but but I'm going to provoke you
[57:38] in
[57:40] love to press the kingdom like you've
[57:42] never pressed it
[57:44] before and I I I I believe that the holy
[57:48] spirit is present and I'm just so happy
[57:51] to see you sister Haley and brother Ryan
[57:54] God bless you
[57:55] amen comeing all they're they're from
[57:57] our assembly I don't know how this all
[57:59] works but assemblies win and
[58:05] lose but God bless you
[58:07] both and thank you again for putting up
[58:11] with me and brother Wayne thank you for
[58:14] the kind
[58:15] invitation can we stand to our feet
[58:18] please can we turn to
[58:22] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter
[58:26] 3 very very very familiar
[58:35] scripture Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1
[58:39] and verse
[58:43] two
[58:46] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse
[58:49] 1 and verse
[58:53] two
[58:56] scripture
[58:57] reads to
[58:59] everything there is a
[59:01] season and a time to every purpose under
[59:05] the heaven a time to be
[59:08] born a time to
[59:10] die time to
[59:12] plant and the time to pluck up that
[59:17] which is
[59:18] planted so before we we just start
[59:23] preaching
[59:25] for every SE time there is a season
[59:28] every season there's a space of time in
[59:31] that time God's allotted certain events
[59:34] to take
[59:36] place and so we'll be just looking a
[59:39] little bit at time maybe at a a
[59:41] different uh way this evening so if you
[59:45] would pull on the word and all by the
[59:48] grace of God try and preach the word and
[59:50] and and we'll have a a time in his
[59:52] presence so let's bow our heads
[59:55] heavenly
[59:58] father I bow my
[1:00:01] head yes to give you
[1:00:04] thanks thank you Lord we love you with a
[1:00:07] great love these are the Blood Bought of
[1:00:11] God that are standing here Lord we would
[1:00:14] want to encourage one another in the
[1:00:17] faith move us into higher
[1:00:21] objectives deeper depths as your prophet
[1:00:24] said in the word Lord and father God we
[1:00:28] just pray that the Holy Spirit now will
[1:00:30] come behind the word and speak to every
[1:00:34] life from the youngest to the oldest we
[1:00:38] ask it in Jesus name amen amen you may
[1:00:42] have your
[1:00:44] seats praise the
[1:00:47] Lord I like to if I was going to have a
[1:00:51] little
[1:00:52] title I spoke a subject and I'm not
[1:00:55] going to speak on it as such this
[1:00:57] evening but just before I left
[1:01:00] home on high
[1:01:02] alert high alert but that that will be
[1:01:07] that'll be a subject maybe we'll touch
[1:01:09] on uh tomorrow but it it it's more or
[1:01:12] less letting each and every one of us
[1:01:15] know that I believe as we're sitting
[1:01:19] here and now preparing to delve into the
[1:01:22] word that it's different than it was
[1:01:25] last
[1:01:26] Sunday it's different than it was even
[1:01:29] last
[1:01:31] Wednesday and you know we we can so um
[1:01:36] categorize Time by being a time at
[1:01:40] service or a time that we're just going
[1:01:43] to set aside for certain events and and
[1:01:46] and we get in our in our minds and in
[1:01:49] that time frame that certain things are
[1:01:52] going to happen but a lot of times when
[1:01:55] God has something in his mind in time
[1:01:59] because he's
[1:02:00] Timeless many people Miss what God has
[1:02:03] in that
[1:02:05] time and to me that's that's
[1:02:08] dangerous
[1:02:10] because you've heard the prophet say
[1:02:12] you've had your pastor preach and you've
[1:02:15] been well aware that this could actually
[1:02:17] be the last
[1:02:18] service and that's more than just a
[1:02:21] saying
[1:02:22] now that could be very very true so if
[1:02:26] there's somebody in this service that is
[1:02:29] not right with God you can be right with
[1:02:32] God right now because we get into our
[1:02:35] minds
[1:02:37] Catholicism we get in our minds we got
[1:02:39] to do a certain thing to make things
[1:02:41] right you say well I got to kneel at my
[1:02:44] bench or I got to come to the front or I
[1:02:46] got to do something Saints when people
[1:02:48] were coming by that prophet he just said
[1:02:51] you need to be saved do you want to be
[1:02:54] saved sir he said yes sir he said then
[1:02:57] you're saved I thought my and and we go
[1:03:01] through certain events because we say it
[1:03:04] has to happen a certain way well then we
[1:03:08] miss something in time and we don't want
[1:03:10] to miss nothing that God is
[1:03:13] doing so time evolves and in time let's
[1:03:17] just say since the Garden of Eden time
[1:03:20] has moved on sin came in time started in
[1:03:24] the beginning
[1:03:25] time okay are you with me yes sir so
[1:03:28] time moved along and and man fell Adam
[1:03:31] fell uh e fell they fell in the garden
[1:03:34] but God wasn't going to leave them that
[1:03:36] way right he was going to have
[1:03:38] Redemption but in that time we never
[1:03:40] they never thought how would you have
[1:03:42] dreamt Redemption was going to come the
[1:03:44] way that it came oh yeah right I unless
[1:03:48] God sent a prophet and prophecies were
[1:03:51] now written in the word and even though
[1:03:53] they be written in the word people were
[1:03:54] missing it so you say well it was in the
[1:03:57] Bible but you could have said well I
[1:04:00] read that Bible but I never saw it melai
[1:04:02] 4 was in that
[1:04:04] Bible and we'll just leap we'll go right
[1:04:07] over you can go right over to Malachi 4
[1:04:09] people it's laying in the Bible and how
[1:04:11] many billions of people have missed
[1:04:14] Malachi 4 and Malachi 4 is come and
[1:04:18] gone but we say yeah praise the lord we
[1:04:21] saw Malachi 4 but Malachi 4 wasn't
[1:04:24] pointing you to
[1:04:25] him Malachi 4 was pointing you to
[1:04:29] him so in this time Hallelujah he's the
[1:04:34] one that's been elevated through the
[1:04:37] message and so now time now God's got
[1:04:41] you on his mind is that true he's got
[1:04:44] you on his mind and he's got Rapture on
[1:04:47] his mind he's got you on his mind and he
[1:04:51] want to get you there but in this space
[1:04:54] of time from now to
[1:04:57] rapture we want to be very sensitive to
[1:05:01] what the holy spirit is doing in
[1:05:05] time amen so we can say time
[1:05:09] and I just looked up the different
[1:05:11] titles of times that the prophet used he
[1:05:13] used time quite a
[1:05:14] bit he had Junction of time time is at
[1:05:17] hand time tested memorials signs of the
[1:05:20] times time tested Faith time of decision
[1:05:24] from that time beyond the curtain of
[1:05:26] time end time seed sign end time
[1:05:29] evangelist he used time and yet a
[1:05:33] prophet was piercing in from time to
[1:05:37] Eternity trying to bring a people from
[1:05:39] time to
[1:05:42] Eternity but we are somehow still caught
[1:05:46] in time and yet brother BR says we're
[1:05:49] Eternal
[1:05:51] beings that's right so now we want to be
[1:05:53] changed from time to
[1:05:57] Eternity all right so there's certain
[1:06:00] events that take place that are are are
[1:06:02] memorable that are Memorial uh they they
[1:06:05] just stay in our minds or they've been
[1:06:08] locked in
[1:06:09] it um I I I I I remember when I was I in
[1:06:14] grade three and in grade three you said
[1:06:16] grade three Alpha how old were you for
[1:06:19] the time well that's for you to figure
[1:06:20] out I was old I was young once
[1:06:24] yeah and now what do you mean yeah of
[1:06:28] course I was and I come home and my mom
[1:06:32] was making my lunch and and she was
[1:06:36] crying and I thought what's going on I'm
[1:06:40] I you know you're in grade
[1:06:43] three and you find out that President
[1:06:46] Kennedy was
[1:06:49] shot so there's certain events that
[1:06:51] happen they say that you will always
[1:06:54] always remember that moment of
[1:06:58] time and so certain events you say well
[1:07:01] brother Tom when did you get saved I got
[1:07:03] saved in February 1975 there's a very
[1:07:06] pointed time where God saved my
[1:07:11] soul and so there's events let's take
[1:07:14] Pearl
[1:07:15] Harbor Pearl Harbor is an event it
[1:07:18] started the German invasion of Poland
[1:07:20] was
[1:07:22] 1939 and America never entered the war
[1:07:26] until Pearl Harbor was bombed by the
[1:07:29] Japanese and 3,000 Sailors were

[1:09:04] Israel they said how did the mostad
[1:09:08] which is their intelligence

[1:10:07] week they went from a nation of
[1:10:11] peace to a nation fighting for
[1:10:16] survival within the last eight or so
[1:10:20] days Israel was holding their own
[1:10:25] but now they are fighting for their
[1:10:28] existence and World opinion now you just
[1:10:32] watch now World opinion was on their
[1:10:35] side but those how can they say the

[1:10:44] machine working the people's
[1:10:49] minds and you watch popular opinion as
[1:10:52] time will go on

[1:10:56] Israel but I just don't want you to
[1:10:59] leave in natural Israel I want you to
[1:11:01] start thinking spiritual Israel because
[1:11:04] your Prophet said in Feast of the
[1:11:06] trumpets 200,000,000
[1:11:09] Supernatural demons have been loosed on
[1:11:12] a
[1:11:13] people those are extra Demons by the way
[1:11:17] but your Prophet said you could put
[1:11:20] every demon under your foot
[1:11:25] that is not a slogan that is not just
[1:11:27] something to repeat that is when you go
[1:11:30] out these doors and the enemy comes like
[1:11:34] a flood you are God's
[1:11:39] standard I'm not looking for tomorrow to

[1:15:09] through the
[1:15:11] Vatican they sided with the Nazis they
[1:15:14] didn't think Russia and the Allies were
[1:15:16] going to
[1:15:19] win we see inside the enemy's t
[1:15:24] through a prophet's
[1:15:26] Eyes Lord there's no
[1:15:30] question whether the bride's going to
[1:15:32] win or
[1:15:34] lose you are the
[1:15:37] winners in fact the prophet said rising
[1:15:39] and the sun you have already
[1:15:42] won you have already
[1:15:47] won
[1:15:50] Hallelujah but in time
[1:15:53] time moves on we've gone from as we
[1:15:57] Prophet often said in the countdown from
[1:15:59] the horse and buggy age to the model T4
[1:16:01] to the to the supercars that we have
[1:16:04] today to the jet airplane to the Jet
[1:16:06] Plane to the astronaut age we've gone
[1:16:09] all through the that progression of time
[1:16:11] we've gone from the Hubble space
[1:16:14] satellite that shoots pictures into
[1:16:16] space to the web that's looking Beyond
[1:16:18] universes they never even dreamt that
[1:16:20] there was he's a creator
[1:16:24] right the attribute of God is
[1:16:27] Creator he can't stop
[1:16:30] creating they're looking into universes
[1:16:33] they didn't even know were
[1:16:38] there and stars and galaxies what the
[1:16:41] thrill of my soul is your Bible says and
[1:16:44] my Bible says that God knows every Star
[1:16:48] by
[1:16:50] name oh here's a good statistic for you
[1:16:53] you yeah how many how many have gone to
[1:16:55] a beach
[1:16:57] before you
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:00] know like is it a sin to go to a beach I
[1:17:02] don't
[1:17:04] know right we've gone to a beach how
[1:17:06] many how many have seen a grain a sand
[1:17:10] okay you seeing a grain of sand and you
[1:17:11] put that grain and you let that fall
[1:17:13] through you go man that's a lot of
[1:17:15] grains of
[1:17:16] sand well there's a lot of beaches in
[1:17:19] North America there's a lot of deserts
[1:17:21] in the Mojave Desert there's a lot of
[1:17:23] sand there's a in Arabia and in in
[1:17:26] Africa there's a lot of sand in in
[1:17:28] Mongolia there's a huge desert do you
[1:17:31] realize that they say there's more stars
[1:17:33] than there are grains of sand on the
[1:17:36] planet
[1:17:39] Earth that's just a
[1:17:42] statistic and he knows everyone by
[1:17:46] name what a mighty God we
[1:17:49] serve Angels bow before him Heaven and
[1:17:53] Earth adors him and we limit him some
[1:17:57] way Brother come on how do we limit this
[1:18:00] unlimited
[1:18:04] God so as we see in time there's a
[1:18:07] process in time and and and and and
[1:18:10] prophecies are laying there uh can you
[1:18:13] turn to Ezekiel 37
[1:18:21] please
[1:18:25] Ezekiel
[1:18:27] 37:1 and the Hand of the Lord was upon
[1:18:29] me and carried me in the spirit of the
[1:18:31] Lord and set me down in the midst of a
[1:18:32] valley which was full of Bones and
[1:18:35] caused me to pass by them round about
[1:18:37] behold there were very many in the open
[1:18:40] Valley and lo they were
[1:18:44] dry and he said unto me son of man can
[1:18:47] these bones live and I answered oh Lord
[1:18:50] God thou knowest again and he said unto
[1:18:53] me prophesy unto these bones and say
[1:18:56] unto them oh Dry Bones hear the word of
[1:19:01] the
[1:19:01] Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these
[1:19:06] bones
[1:19:08] behold I will cause breath to enter into
[1:19:12] you and you shall live and many people
[1:19:17] have have preached on valley of dry
[1:19:20] bones and brother bar makes reference to
[1:19:21] it in restoration of the brid tree but
[1:19:24] in recognizing your day in this message
[1:19:26] brother Braham said Hosea said in 61
[1:19:29] return to the Lord remember he said that
[1:19:31] they would be
[1:19:33] scattered they will return they were
[1:19:36] torn they were blinded that's exactly
[1:19:40] what happened he will heal us and he
[1:19:44] will bind us like Ezekiel 37 Dry Bones
[1:19:49] the valley of dry bones Ezekiel Saw
[1:19:52] their return
[1:19:55] again Israel's return was coming through
[1:19:59] a prophet
[1:20:01] prophecy and so there was nothing that
[1:20:04] was going to stop the word of God to be
[1:20:07] fulfilled it was laying in scripture in
[1:20:12] time and we've taken it of course for
[1:20:14] the bride and you can take it of course
[1:20:16] you can see the parallel but I'd like to
[1:20:18] get into the parallel because remember
[1:20:21] just remember when Naomi and Ruth got
[1:20:25] Boaz it was church natural Church
[1:20:28] spiritual it was Jew and Gentile and
[1:20:33] Rose got
[1:20:34] Boaz amen and Boaz redeemed
[1:20:40] Naomi amen what day are we living in
[1:20:43] that's why the prophet said recognizing
[1:20:45] your day and his
[1:20:47] message it was God that brought the Jews
[1:20:51] back amen amen remember the prophet said
[1:20:56] in 1946 that was when they first raised
[1:20:58] the flag of the Israel flag in 1948 that
[1:21:00] was when the United Nations recognized
[1:21:03] Israel become a nation but he says the
[1:21:05] day that they raised the flag was the
[1:21:08] day come on the day that the angel of
[1:21:12] the Lord visited me because Naomi was
[1:21:17] coming back and Ruth is coming back and
[1:21:20] I don't care how dry you are
[1:21:23] let the Breath of God breathe on
[1:21:27] you
[1:21:30] Hallelujah parallel yeah and that's why
[1:21:33] I love the flag of Israel two blue lines
[1:21:36] one star of David Naomi and
[1:21:40] Ruth wow that's just me you don't have
[1:21:42] to think I just like that I look at that
[1:21:45] why are they got a parallel because it
[1:21:48] has always been
[1:21:51] parallel my not eyes have seen the glory
[1:21:55] of the coming of the Lord and the Lord
[1:21:58] himself shall descend with a shout and
[1:22:01] the voice of the Archangel and the Trump
[1:22:04] of God and the last trumpet to Israel is
[1:22:09] the seventh
[1:22:10] seal come on
[1:22:12] Roose
[1:22:14] sir how close are we come on how close
[1:22:18] are we we don't want to play church we
[1:22:21] got this set up here and this set up
[1:22:23] there say we're Beyond playing church
[1:22:26] it's pulling on the word pulling on the
[1:22:28] men of God pulling on thus sayith the
[1:22:33] word
[1:22:35] hallelujah what an hour we're living
[1:22:38] in Bible said when go in Revelation 81
[1:22:42] when he opened up the seven seal there
[1:22:43] was silence in heaven but in that
[1:22:46] silence the trumpets were gonna
[1:22:50] sound the trumpets were to Israel and
[1:22:54] brother Brown wanted to preach on the
[1:22:55] seven trumpets and he said I spoke them
[1:22:58] supernaturally under the six seal and
[1:23:01] then he said the seventh trumpet to
[1:23:04] Israel is the seventh seal to the Bride
[1:23:08] of Jesus Christ which is his
[1:23:14] coming so now we're looking at 1946 when
[1:23:17] the way flag was waste 1948 when the
[1:23:20] United Nations established here we are
[1:23:23] in
[1:23:24] 2023 75 years down the road but what did
[1:23:28] it take to drive Jews out of the United
[1:23:31] States of America mommies took babies
[1:23:35] daddies took
[1:23:36] children come on that was in your
[1:23:39] newspapers they said if my mom and dad
[1:23:42] and my brothers are fighting for their
[1:23:45] existence oh man I want to preach now if
[1:23:49] they could leave America to go to war

[1:36:39] enthused you say man you're an enthused
[1:36:42] preacher no no no no this is stimulation
[1:36:45] of Revelation
[1:36:46] folks I when I was in the world I was a
[1:36:49] dope smoker when I was in the world I
[1:36:51] was was a drugie when I was in the world
[1:36:52] I was a drinker but as brother Bram said
[1:36:54] in one place I changed my
[1:36:56] [Applause]
[1:36:58] brand Hallelujah I got a stimulation of
[1:37:02] Revelation that comes with this
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:08] message how many know the scripture as
[1:37:10] it was in the days of Noah how many know
[1:37:14] that I've got the corner on the market
[1:37:16] of using
[1:37:17] it brother Ken said every time I witness
[1:37:20] to somebody you said as it was in the
[1:37:22] days of
[1:37:23] Noah because that was real to me God
[1:37:27] sent a prophet you didn't get in the ark
[1:37:30] you're dead yes sir you don't get in
[1:37:33] this message I'm sorry absolutely have a
[1:37:35] nice
[1:37:37] tribulation at
[1:37:40] best at best so God did his purchasing
[1:37:44] work and he cried out it's finished when
[1:37:47] he purchased the work the ransom price
[1:37:49] was
[1:37:50] paid Justice was
[1:37:56] met
[1:37:57] then the three greatest words spoken by
[1:38:01] any lit lit if you look up in
[1:38:04] literacy doesn't matter Homer Iliad
[1:38:06] doesn't matter how far back you go or
[1:38:09] how far forward you go because if you
[1:38:11] can say the three greatest words ever
[1:38:14] spoken it is
[1:38:17] finished it's finished what you said
[1:38:21] well I I don't have a job you got a job
[1:38:24] tomorrow are you a Prosperity preacher
[1:38:26] no I'm a word preacher he said ask
[1:38:29] anything in my name
[1:38:31] believing ah but are you
[1:38:36] believing I have I've asked so long keep
[1:38:40] on asking
[1:38:45] yeah oh my my
[1:38:48] my so now we come to this place place
[1:38:51] where the scripture declares in Matthew
[1:38:53] 2028 even the son of man came not to be
[1:38:58] ministered un but to
[1:39:02] minister and to give his life is
[1:39:06] everybody listening to me yes sir
[1:39:08] because if you don't I'm going to stop
[1:39:09] and we'll have a we'll have church
[1:39:11] tomorrow right so you got to pay
[1:39:14] attention okay I've been to school
[1:39:16] enough and I know what it is to have
[1:39:19] pupils looking counting light bulbs
[1:39:23] so now let me go back to that scripture
[1:39:25] if you want to memorize it or put it
[1:39:28] down Matthew 2028 even as the son of man
[1:39:30] came not to be ministered unto but to
[1:39:35] minister yes and to give his
[1:39:38] life a
[1:39:40] ransom for many notice that word that's
[1:39:44] very interesting it's many it's not all
[1:39:46] yes sir it's only many many are called
[1:39:50] few are chosen so God knows exactly
[1:39:53] who's his own but he came now to Ransom
[1:39:56] Jonathan came to Ransom and that is a
[1:39:59] very key word in the Greek very key word
[1:40:02] we use it we preach it but let me give
[1:40:04] you a little bit uh a definition of it
[1:40:07] and I I might butcher the Greek of it
[1:40:09] but I got it out phonetically so this
[1:40:11] might help x a garazo so just say exaro
[1:40:17] man you're Greek already man you already
[1:40:19] know Greek exaro
[1:40:22] ex Garo Ransom that means he ransomed he
[1:40:27] purchased
[1:40:29] especially he bought you and the Greek
[1:40:31] goes into this and this is amazing
[1:40:33] brother man because brother brother uh
[1:40:35] brandham uses this in kinsman redeemer
[1:40:38] slave market slave market now I'm going
[1:40:40] into the Greek here and he goes now he
[1:40:43] says this scholar says especially to
[1:40:47] those that are in the slave market with
[1:40:50] the
[1:40:51] view of being purchased for
[1:40:59] Freedom
[1:41:01] free
[1:41:03] free
[1:41:04] free all right so he purchase you young
[1:41:07] ladies amen for your freedom amen free
[1:41:12] from
[1:41:13] sin free from the enemy free from
[1:41:16] bondage all right you still listening
[1:41:19] now so it it makes reference to a slave
[1:41:24] in the slave
[1:41:25] market referring to a Jewish
[1:41:29] believer in the Greek that has been
[1:41:33] purchased and delivered as from the
[1:41:37] law because the law binds
[1:41:41] you it's Grace that sets you
[1:41:45] free so now it goes on to say then that
[1:41:49] person or persons that have been
[1:41:54] purchased never never can I say it again
[1:41:59] never return back to the
[1:42:03] market so you say oh that brother
[1:42:05] backslid that brother is in the world
[1:42:07] come on brother if you are under this
[1:42:11] Ransom and you have been bought with
[1:42:13] this price and this
[1:42:17] Blood you Lord that's why the scripture
[1:42:20] declares you must be born
[1:42:26] again praise the Lord when you're born
[1:42:29] again you will never ever ever never
[1:42:34] ever be purchased have to be purchased
[1:42:42] again Lord this blessing is to the
[1:42:47] Believers
[1:42:49] only it's a effective are you listening
[1:42:52] now it's an effective
[1:42:55] Ransom and it's
[1:42:59] permanent
[1:43:01] Hallelujah permanent devil I've been
[1:43:05] Ransom
[1:43:08] permanently he doesn't save me to lose
[1:43:12] me I have been permanently
[1:43:16] ransomed my that's music to my ears
[1:43:19] because I don't know about you with the
[1:43:21] devil just like church or church natural
[1:43:25] they got
[1:43:25] tunnels yeah amen they got them they got
[1:43:30] Bazookas rocket
[1:43:32] launchers they got the
[1:43:35] AK-47s they're out to shoot and to kill
[1:43:38] but I am come to give you life and life
[1:43:42] more
[1:43:44] abundantly they might have the Iron
[1:43:48] Dome and that's what they say yeah we
[1:43:50] have the Iron Dome and you know what
[1:43:52] they call this brother M do you know
[1:43:54] this right I don't know they call this
[1:43:56] operation iron
[1:43:59] sword and I thought wow they got the
[1:44:02] Iron Dome and they got the iron sword
[1:44:04] but I got the blood Dome and the King
[1:44:10] sword I don't care what missile gets
[1:44:13] launched at you none are going to hit
[1:44:16] you none are going to
[1:44:19] land do you know that do you know that
[1:44:21] Napoleon went to war one time you know
[1:44:23] swords are very important in the in 17
[1:44:25] and 1800s swords are very important and
[1:44:29] a special sword maker was making special
[1:44:32] swords because if you can have a certain
[1:44:34] steel you can cut the other sword so nap
[1:44:38] Napoleon he always wanted the best and
[1:44:40] so he he ordered all these tens of
[1:44:42] thousands of swords for his army they
[1:44:45] have these special swords and they went
[1:44:47] into battle and they had the harah ray
[1:44:52] hooray raw
[1:44:55] ra and when they went to fight the other
[1:44:58] sword their swords were cut in
[1:45:01] half they forgot an
[1:45:05] ingredient but in our King
[1:45:09] sword is the full
[1:45:11] ingredient called the open
[1:45:16] book prise The Lord Glory Hallelujah
[1:45:20] it's not a king sword it's the king
[1:45:25] sword and it was put into your and my
[1:45:29] hand so now he's done his Ransom
[1:45:34] work as a son of man
[1:45:36] Ministry he has now done his
[1:45:39] intercessory work as a Son of God
[1:45:43] Ministry now he's turning to the Jews

[1:46:07] wrong he's doing the intercessory work
[1:46:11] he's now doing his
[1:46:14] claiming work at this time amen amen and
[1:46:22] John went to look for don't weep John
[1:46:26] for the lion of the tribe of Judah ha
[1:46:30] prevailed right but when he went to look
[1:46:34] for a lion what did he see he saw a
[1:46:38] bleeding lamb because he was your
[1:46:41] intercessor he was your
[1:46:44] purchaser but he couldn't see him at

[1:46:49] in the eternity
[1:46:51] because he was the land
[1:46:53] slain before the foundation of the

[1:53:36] what a day what a
[1:53:41] gathering when Israel went to war in
[1:53:45] 1976
[1:53:46] brother Ericson I know you know this
[1:53:50] but in 1976 in the war of Yong
[1:53:55] kapor that was when all the Arab Nations
[1:54:00] encircled
[1:54:02] Israel
[1:54:04] interesting very
[1:54:07] interesting in the day of Y
[1:54:10] kapor did you know that the president of
[1:54:13] the United States at that time was
[1:54:14] Richard
[1:54:17] Nixon and do you know that your secret
[1:54:19] AR of state was Harry
[1:54:22] Kissinger and Harry Kissinger was a
[1:54:25] Jew but Harry Kissinger only wanted to
[1:54:29] send one plain load of Tanks to Israel
[1:54:33] one in the young Kipper
[1:54:36] war and golday year had come to
[1:54:39] America to ask for
[1:54:42] Armament so that they could defeat the
[1:54:45] enemy and they were down to just a
[1:54:48] handful of bullets
[1:54:50] right but Richard Nixon did not listen
[1:54:54] to his secretary treasurer he said send
[1:54:57] every planeet possible fill them up with
[1:55:00] tanks fill them up with Armament fill
[1:55:03] them up so that Israel could defeat the
[1:55:07] enemy ah but you said well Richard Nixon
[1:55:11] he got booted out of office but you know
[1:55:17] your Prophet liked him
[1:55:21] whoa I'm going to give you a curveball
[1:55:22] right now he voted for
[1:55:27] him I that's just extra that's just
[1:55:32] extra but you know what Richard they
[1:55:35] asked brother brother Rich Richard Nixon
[1:55:37] I guarantee you we'll see him somehow
[1:55:40] good to the bride you know somewhere in
[1:55:42] there right they said he said they said
[1:55:46] why did you send so much arm to Israel
[1:55:51] he said when I was a young boy my mother
[1:55:54] told me she said God has raised you up
[1:55:58] to help
[1:56:01] Israel
[1:56:08] Hallelujah but you've had another
[1:56:11] mother that's called you and he called
[1:56:15] you to raise you up yes sir and given
[1:56:18] you all the Armament you need to defeat
[1:56:21] the Devil at every turn of the
[1:56:28] road Israel is returning back to her
[1:56:31] country it took a another attack to
[1:56:35] bring them from America Europe Africa
[1:56:39] South America they came from everywhere
[1:56:41] to go back to their
[1:56:45] land you
[1:56:47] know you know I'm working with on this
[1:56:50] one too so don't worry I'm now I'm going
[1:56:51] to give you some of my thoughts what
[1:56:53] aren't worth much but just to help you
[1:56:56] out you know you think that these you
[1:57:00] anybody here ever heard of Rabbi
[1:57:02] Richmond we had them in our church years
[1:57:05] ago brother visco wanted to just find
[1:57:07] out where is Israel where is Israel at
[1:57:11] but you know SS of God without the word
[1:57:14] you're going to go somewhere left field
[1:57:18] sir so I was sent a little clip the
[1:57:21] other day and his Rabbi Richmond talking
[1:57:22] to an Evangelical he said the problem
[1:57:24] with you Gentiles he said you worship
[1:57:27] only one man he said you should be
[1:57:30] worshiping all us
[1:57:33] Jews I go woo where did you go
[1:57:38] off thank God for a
[1:57:41] message thank God for a
[1:57:44] message so we think the long hair and
[1:57:47] you know all the locks that are hang
[1:57:49] hanging down and everything has
[1:57:51] something to do with it doesn't have
[1:57:53] nothing to do with it the 144,000 is the
[1:57:57] 144,000 the elect is the
[1:58:01] elect there's not one of those hund it's
[1:58:04] not going to
[1:58:05] be
[1:58:08] 43,9
[1:58:10] 199 it's going to be
[1:58:13] 144,000 and at that wedding supper
[1:58:15] there's not going to be one plate that's
[1:58:18] not full there
[1:58:20] your name tag is there and you're going
[1:58:23] to be there God's watch over Israel and
[1:58:26] God's watched over his elected lady he
[1:58:29] watched over Naomi and he watched over
[1:58:31] Ruth Ruth got Boaz and got a child then
[1:58:36] he in that Redemption process of time
[1:58:41] Naomi got yes Ruth
[1:58:44] baby brother Bisal preached on years and
[1:58:47] years and years ago passing the baby
[1:58:51] passing the word where are we at in
[1:58:58] closing can I give you a w scripture in
[1:59:01] closing be
[1:59:05] still and
[1:59:10] know I am
[1:59:15] God I will be exalted amongst the
[1:59:18] heathen
[1:59:21] I will be exalted in the
[1:59:23] earth that's Psalms 46:10 if you want to
[1:59:26] take an a note or interest in that note
[1:59:29] but the interesting fact when David
[1:59:33] wrote be still and know that I am God it
[1:59:36] was written in the context of a time of
[1:59:44] trouble it was in a time of trouble and
[1:59:47] War so let us now consider the verse in
[1:59:53] a time of great trial trouble and War be
[2:00:00] still be
[2:00:02] still and
[2:00:04] know I am God musicians why don't you
[2:00:08] come
[2:00:12] please God is in the midst of her Psalms
[2:00:18] 46 and10
[2:00:19] one of my favorite scriptures which all
[2:00:21] of them are
[2:00:24] apparently she shall not be
[2:00:28] moved God shall help her and right
[2:00:33] early Psalms
[2:00:35] 9177 A thousand shall fall at thy side
[2:00:39] and 10,000 shall fall at thy right side
[2:00:43] and we've seen them over the years yes
