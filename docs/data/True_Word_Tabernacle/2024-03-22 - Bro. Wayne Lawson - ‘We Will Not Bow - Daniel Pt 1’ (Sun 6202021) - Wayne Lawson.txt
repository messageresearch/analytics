us to the paths of righteousness oh Lord we ask you for your mercy now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you today if you have your Bibles amen we would like to turn to the Book of Daniel in the first chapter and amen we have a few things uh to look at today uh from The Book of Daniel I I've got it on my heart just to study uh this book just a little bit um and what I have found out is that uh in the very first the very first chapter uh we would need an entire week of Bible history just to understand the reading so I'm not going to try to bore you with every uh scripture and every thing but but you I'll give you some of the scripture and you're you can able to go back and read them and go through them and it's there a lot of tremendous reading and and understanding so we but I I'll just maybe make it a little bit shorter and just give you the synopsis of of some of these things amen but uh if we could read from Book of Daniel here the first chapter and the first verse for in the third year of the reign of jehm king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it may God bless the reading of his words you may be seated um I think it's a very interesting study the Book of Daniel of course it's the parallel to the Book of Revelations in the New Testament The Book of Daniel was written uh in the land of Babylon and Daniel under captivity as a slave of Babylon but yet he was inspired by the word of God to write it amen and to leave it to the church um I I I think it's amazing that we're still here now uh 4,000 years later nearly reading of the things that a man pinned while in captivity in Babylon what a dedicated life amen what a what a servant of God that his words amen would live that long amen um and in in here if you if you approach this book The Book of Daniel uh in the first chapter it begins with a very interesting verse here for in the third year the reign of jeam the king of Judah now in that very saying right there it's going to announce something to you because this is really not the name of this king of Judah uh his name actually is not at all uh jehm it's been changed it's actually eam it's uh he is the second son of King Josiah how many remembers who Josiah was in the Bible Josiah was the king that uh caused God to not destroy Judah at the time and and as long as he lived remember he was the he was the one that had the greatest Passover amen that the nation had ever knew he was the one that went in and destroyed all of the Witchcraft from among cut down the Groves and God really blessed the nation of Israel because of Josiah and as long as Josiah was alive God's hand was stayed and and the judgments wasn't oppon it but then after the death of Josiah it was in the time of this that his first son Josiah's first son was raised up to the throne and he only was about I think it was less than a year uh just a few months actually that he was able to Reign uh the eldest son of Josiah after his death and it was then that the Egyptians came and actually took took him into captivity which which josi himself was killed in a battle with Egypt and the king of Egypt killed him and then his son his first son then was was was toen off of the throne in 2 Kings if you like to read it it's in 2 Kings CH 23: uh 33 and then 24:5 the Bible says that Pharaoh put unto him the the bonds and in the land of HTH that he might not reign in Jerusalem first son of Josiah now put the land a tribute of 100 talents of silver talents of gold and Pharaoh then made eclam the son of Josiah the king in the room of Josiah his father and turned his name to joim uh was actually the changing of a name by an Egyptian king that was now sitting on the throne of Jerusalem can you imagine that Judah is being ruled by a king who carries the name that has been changed by an Egyptian king so in other words amen the the the kingdom was now in the in the Reigns of men who were not men like King David these were not men who were born in bread and anointed of God to lead the country but they were being placed by Egyptians and their name Nam were being changed to show Egyptian rule over them and these were the kinds of men that were actually leading Israel in the days that the Book of Daniel was written and and this is of course why that the Book of Daniel was written from Babylon is because of the fall of the kings in the land of Israel which of course is Judah by now now if you're in your Bible History you all know that Israel and Judah are now two separate Nations they were actually uh the tribe of Israel of course were 12 sons of Jacob become the sons of Israel which were the state of of Israel itself which would have been 12 States but two of the states were pulled off and made what we call Judah which Jerusalem would be the capital and it was remained for the for the seed of David So Judah was a separate nation in itself had its own Kings and then God sent prophets to it but then Israel had its own King and had 10 tribes and they they had their own Nation so it was separate now Israel has already been carried off by the Assyrians before this has happened Israel has already been carried off by the Assyrians and Judah has been left but now Judah is being ruled by evil Kings now now it's amazing because if you look at this Israel should have been together as a nation but now part of it's gone only two tribes exist and a king sets up on the throne of it that has been taken over by Egypt and and now he's actually fleecing the people he's a very evil man and the scripture showing us that he's teaching the people evil ways now to think that Daniel and the children of Israel that was in Judah are living under an evil rule even in their own land can you imagine living in a land where God was supposed to be reigning that his word should have been the rule and yet that while they were yet in their own country amen they were not under good influences of a King but the scripture teaches us here that in the Book of Daniel that in the third year amen of this man's Reign that Nebuchadnezzar comes down and of course he has a battle Nebuchadnezzar there's three great three great uh rulings at this time there's Egypt there's Assyria and there's Babylon but according to prophecy Babylon is going to actually take over the entire world this is the prophecies that Jeremiah is making he's beginning to pronounce babylon's going to take over which the King Nebuchadnezzar God's going to giv him Rule and then when King Nebuchadnezzar starts coming down to fight of course with the Egyptians he again takes over amen and and the scripture teaches us uh and I'd have to read a bunch of scripture to you to get to all this amen but the but the scripture teaches us that whenever about the third year of the reign of this man jeh hoim which is under the Egyptian rule that he Rebels against Nebuchadnezzar now God has anointed Nebuchadnezzar to take over the world world and now we have a king who's living in Judah who's under the influence of Egypt who's rejecting the will of God again even in Nebuchadnezzar coming and and the scripture teaches us this is when that Daniel goes into captivity now if You' like to study Bible History of course Babylon is going to pull about three or four different Exiles out of out of Judah over a space of years it it's a scripture tells us I think it's in the 18th year right R of Nebuchadnezzar this is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule when he pulls it out it's about the 18th year of his rule when he finally burns down the city of Jerusalem and and and and ruins the nation and and he carries away zedekiah but here in this first portion of this it's just a small amount of people are going to be pulled out of Jerusalem in an exile and taken over into Babylon now in that in that first little capture of people what happens is Nebuchadnezzar sets up this this King and he's going to rule the nation but he's going to do it under Nebuchadnezzar he's going to be under the rule and this this is what becomes a great problem in Israel or excuse me I call it Israel but it's Judah this is what's going to be a great problem in Judah because the kings of Judah want to do their own thing because whenever they served God they were Sovereign but now they have been placed under influences of other Realms and other people and even in their own Nation they're starting to experience slav y because that they did not follow the will of God so they're starting to fall under under now now they're still in their Nation now but they're under influences amen and and they can't help it they can't break it now if you uh like to read the Bible I'm going to skip ahead a little bit here but this is in in the stories of the scripture under the carrying away of is of Judah into Babylon that there is a king named zedekiah which is the one who follows this Jehovah him the king zedekiah which is a very puppet of Nebuchadnezzar himself but the scripture teaches us even he couldn't keep the rule of Nebuchadnezzar and he rebelled against him now if you like to read the message and you read your Bible you'll find out this is where the story amen of hananiah and and zedi comes up against Jeremiah y'all remember the story when Jeremiah comes in and prophesize remember he he's he comes into the into the king's Chambers and all the people are there and he's wearing a a a wooden yoke upon his neck and he comes in and prophesies that babylon's going to rule and the people will be under the rule of Babylon even in Israel and a false prophet then comes up and says to him Jeremiah this is not the word of the Lord but God spoke to me and he said that God will bust up this and he will break the Yoke of the bondage off the people and he reaches up and takes the Yoke off of the neck of Jeremiah and throws it on the floor and he said God's going to break it and when he did he began to prophesy that within 2 years all the people's going to be let go and here Daniel is prophesying to the people that because of the wickedness and the sins of the people you could have turned to the Lord he said but prophecy was saying 70 years God will have Judah down there in Babylon but because amen of this man kind of got caught up in the spirit you know he seen what was going to go well with the crowd so he just transitioned his sermon to m that's the popular thing to say at that time and actually come against a god anointed Prophet so that he could prophesy what would get a big amen from the church amen that just to be honest now he was one of them Prosperity preachers telling everybody America's going to stand America's going to go amen you can live in sin you can do anything go anywhere act any way and God bless America you know Amen in other words he was saying that God could bless Judah in its sin and I think it ought to be a great lesson this morning for every man for every child for every woman to realize amen that Israel was a nation amen that was anointed of God but God would not allow it to be blessed while it was in sin amen he rebuked it off of them sent true prophets unto them and the Bible said that they become learned in the way of evil and had no knowledge of good can you imagine that God's Own people now this is Abraham's people that had been Led Out of Babylon y'all remember Abraham was the father of Israel and Abraham had been called out of Babylon hundreds of years before this called out to make a nation unto himself now the nation children that Abraham had made is now turned to the gods of the world while they're in Israel and yet they're under the godship of other Idols now God took them out of Babylon for the purpose of building a nation where there was only one God but now in the nation where there was one God they have beg to incorporate the gods of other nations amen which teaches us that whenever that man turns to another God that God gives them over to the God they're serving as long as you desire to serve God he is a god of Grace a god of Mercy a god of blessing a god of reality but there is a a core rule with serving the god of Abraham hear ye oh Israel the Lord thy God is one and amen and there is only one God and he is a jealous God and he said that we cannot serve two Gods at the same time either we serve God or we serve man in other words it's it's not possible to serve our God and the god of the world at the same time because our God will not allow you to worship him while you're worshipping another God he's a jealous God amen amen I I could say it maybe so people really understand it it would be like it would be like that your wife decides to get two husbands well in my case my wife couldn't have two husbands because I would not be a second husband and our God says to you he will not be your second husband he he will not be the other guy he will not play the other fiddle either he'll be God or not God at all either he'll be your leader or Not Your Leader at all either you'll serve him with a single heart or you can have the gods that you desire but let me say this to you before you choose a another God you might already to check out the kind of God you're serving right now before you choose the God of this evil age you might understand that when you are sick in the bed that God is Not A Healer amen when you are troubled in your mind the God of this world is not a savior he is not a deliverer he is not a mighty God but he is the creator of hell he is the creator of confusion every Destruction has come from the lives of this enemy and amen the the scriptures teaches us God had brought them out of Babylon brought them amen into that land that they might serve God if you're sitting here this morning as a Christian and God has led the church out of denomination he's LED them away from these things he's LED you here so that you can serve god with a free heart my why would we ever want to be entangled again if God has led us out with a free heart now in the in the scripture here it's telling us that in the third year of course this is the first carrying away in the Book of Daniel it's the first carrying away of the children of Israel into Babylon amen I think about this because they would have walked the same Trail back that Abraham walked out can you imagine going the wrong way on that trail amen the trail that had brought them out of Babylon and brought them into into Judah now the children of Abraham years later have turned around and is walking backwards on the same trail that Abraham come out of they're going back to the place of confusion that Abraham had led them out of the god that had brought them out now the Israel is being returned to that land but listen now I think it's beautiful to remember this because the scripture says amen that they begin to take out the wise and they begin to take out them a good understanding so when Nebuchadnezzar went and took over over Judah what he done was took the he took the he he brain drained Judah he took the wise he took the spiritual he took the understanding and that's the people that he brought out so Daniel and the three Hebrew children brother Bram said they was a little bit like birds of a feather he said now these guys of course were True Believers amen but they were caught in the mix of being under evil leaders amen isn't it a amazing right here in this America now amen we escaped the religious persecution of the Roman church and we come out of Europe and cross the sea the Waters of Separation to come to America for the purpose of religious Liberties is that right and the Very Nation we are living in now was founded upon the Bible it was founded upon the principles of judaa a Jewish Christian Bible that's where our laws were written that's the way our Bill of Rights was established that's the way everything in our land was run up to a few hundred year to a few years ago everything was run that way our public schools had Bibles in them they had prayer in them amen our our nation was a nation amen that was blessed of God is that right amen it was a nation blessed of God but here we are this morning subject to evil leaders we're actually here but this nation is now subject to evil leaders now it wouldn't have evil leaders if the people didn't have evil Hearts but the leadership is now resembling what the people were and because they have lost their spiritual attitudes now whether you know it or not because of the elections that we've had because of the people that's in offices right now seven out of nine jurors sitting on the Supreme Court are Roman Catholic in their faith we ran from the Roman Church church out of Europe to this nation so we wouldn't be ruled by them and now they're setting in our Supreme Court our president right now is a Roman Catholic they have taken over this nation whether you like it or not you are now subject back under that thing again the Roman Church is taking over the politics of the United States of America and they never fired a shot they never had to kill nothing they never had to do anything people say well brother Wayne it ain't really that bad and let me say this yet it ain't that bad yet but it's in the place right now amen to begin to move in the Bible predicts the mark of the beast is going to come upon this nation come on now Jeremiah prophesied it to Judah and told him the whole thing is coming under judgment and if you want to escape the judgments get in the presence of God and that God has sent a prophet in this age and he said that you cannot worship God and the image of the beast at the same time if you're going to be a free man or a free woman you've got to get into Christ you got to get out of this National Spirit out of this idea and get into Christ my when I think about this I think about these young men and how that they're living they're living in a world under the influence of evil leadership even when they were in Judah these young people were having their kings and their leaders amen were were making choices for the nation and they were evil choices they were evil decisions amen now now can you imagine these boys really and honestly were already being prepped for Babylon amen because when they got to Babylon the scripture tells us when they got to Babylon the first thing that happens they got their names changed now I could I could go through the names here amen how many of you interested would you like to hear hear the change of the names or is that an interesting thing I I thought it was pretty I thought it was pretty amazing amen uh that the scripture says that they changed the names now Daniel chapter 1 and verse 6 the Bible said now among them were the children of Judah Daniel hananiah Michelle and Azar and unto the prince of the Unix gave the names he unto them Daniel to the name Bel shazar now Daniel which is in Hebrew means God is my judge but the name they changed it Bazar in chal means the true Treasure of Baal the true Treasure of Baal they changed him from God as my judge to The Treasure of Baal in other words he was the depository of the secrets of Baal or the treasury of baale Amen now it's amazing because here the scripture says amen that they've changed his name of course it's trying to change identity right and to hananiah they changed his name amen which signified the Lord has been gracious to me or whom to the Lord has been gracious that which the word Lord is Jehovah and it was changed to Shadrach chaladi which means he has been verly translated he's the inspiration of the son God the author of evil to be prosperous let God Prosper Us from Evil it was uh serving of course the Babylonian Gods meach which means he comes from God they called him M meach which signifies Michelle signifies he who comes from God and they called him meach which means he who belongs to the goddess of shishak a celebrated deity of the Babylonians mentioned by Jeremiah Jeremiah 25:6 amen now the the last young man who took abedo was a Zari which signifies the Lord is my helper they changed it to abedo which is in the servant of Neo who was one of the divinities by which they meant either the Sun or the Morning Star the juper or Venice in other words they changed these boys' names they changed these boys clothing they changed these boys place that they lived amen and and they done everything they could do to make them fit into the nation that they had been brought into I I think it's a an amazing picture of the scripture of how that the children of God have been brought into a land who does not believe in their same God who who who who who look at the names they were carrying the the clothes that they were wearing everything about them represented something else now the scripture is going to say here amen that these young men their names has changed their clothes are changed everything are trying to be brought and the Lord had prevented uh had put them there of course by the hand of Providence but the scripture said the king had appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat so the king had decided that he was going to spend about a year on these guys and then they were going to get to come into the king's Chambers he appointed a man over them to feed them and to nourish them until the time they would come in the presence of the king of Babylon but the Bible reads here and I this is really where I want to get in the seventh verse unto the prince of the Uno he gave the name and he gave unto Daniel the name of el chazar but Daniel in the eth verse purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the princes and the Unix that he might not defile himself now here is a man who is living in a place where everything that he believes is not is not even regarded there's nothing about Daniel's life that is regarded by the people who is in control he is in a person he is a he's a man who's living in an evil time in an evil place in an evil world I tell you what a prophet said he said he had no church to go to he had no Fellowship he had no songs to sing he had nobody to have the Bible studies with he had no fellowship of other believers amen but this man refused to defile his character that God gave him listen friend I I think that one verse ought to ReSound in every heart of every believer today we've got a beautiful Church to come to this morning how many appreciates the church church amen how many really how many appreciates the church sure isn't it beautiful to have a place to come where other people believe how many appreciates a pastor that teaches the message of the hour so you know had to come and and try to decipher through these things but a true prophecy in a true Place listen and and hear your setting with the baptism of the Holy Ghost sitting in a good church with a good Ministry preaching the word and you see how difficult it is at times to remain the identity of a Christian in a bad situation amen but let me say this to you Daniel ought to be the courage to every believer sitting in here that no matter the situation you're in no matter the place you find yourself in Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile his relationship with God my when I think about it like this Daniel had nothing left he had no home left he had no family left he had no Heritage left everything about Daniel his own name was gone but there was something in the man's heart that you could not take away from him and let me say this morning I believe amen that as Daniel was an alien in a strange world so are we an alien in a strange world and brother one thing's for sure we might be a long ways from a Heavenly home but you will never change the heart of a True Believer because they had purpose purposed in their heart man when I think about a man purposing in his heart in other words you don't live this life on accident you're going to have to purpose in your heart to be different you're going to have to purpose in your heart where you're living is going to be different amen I I I I know some of you live in homes with unbelievers but you got a purpose in your heart that the atmosphere you're in is not going to change who you are you work in situations come on now some of you atmospheres amen I've been there I've stood in the factory and heard the dirty jokes and all those things amen but in my heart amen I I I have to be honest with you I wouldn't laugh at it I wouldn't laugh at their jokes I wouldn't cut up with all that that filth and nonsense amen amen after a while most people end up calling me preacher didn't even know I was a preacher but amen because I wouldn't join into their into the politics and and the nonsense you don't have to be a politician to work somewhere you don't have to go home with them amen and have supper every night we are not here to be the friend of the world we are here to be Servants of God and to be different than the world that we're living in you're a testimony to this entire nation that God still has a Daniel God still has somebody who's willing to purpose in their heart I will not defile myself a we might as well preach in the house of God this morning I believe there's some Daniels that's in the world we're in now you said preacher my name ain't Daniel that's all right whether it is or whether it ain't but I'll tell you this Amen brother randam says it like this Daniel purposed in his heart though he become a citizen there amen but it wasn't by choice because he was an alien and every born again Christian is an alien as soon as he's born again because he's Heavenly bound his possessions lay in heaven we may not be amen we may not be a an Israelite living in Babylon but we're a Christian Living in America and we're just as much alien here as Daniel was there amen but Daniel didn't have a church Daniel didn't have worship Services Daniel didn't have preaching every week but the purpose in Daniel's heart was so powerful that without the Holy Ghost he lived a clean life without the Holy Ghost he remained impure unto his God what's The Testament too that the Holy Ghost filled Church of the Living God there's going to be somebody in the day that we're living in that's going to live clean they're going to separate their lives they're going to come away from this world and be an alien and be an alien amen we are we are aliens amen living a separated life Daniel purposed in his heart you're not going to do this on accident now I I'm not I'm not teaching this from from from without experience i' I've been right where you're standing in your jobs I remember I was an inspector for a city and there was about four or five of us went on a trip we all had to go somewhere we had to go to this school these other guys went with us and we while we're on the while we're on the way we stop at this little restaurant and we go up there and there's four of us standing at the front door and we go out and we're going to have to wait 30 or 40 minutes and the guy says to us would you like to wait at the bar every one of the guys I was with said yeah just give us a seat at the bar we'll have a drink while we wait and they all turned around looked at me I said I ain't been on a bar store in 20 years and you ain't going to put me on here waiting for no food either they all turned around and looked at me and they said no it's all right we'll wait you you see amen if I would have just folded we'd all been sitting on the bar stool but when I decided I will not defile myself sitting on that bar stool then that Church of Christ song leader that was with me who was ready to go over there and sit and drink wine with the rest of them decided you know what that's right we shouldn't be doing that do you know sometimes all the crowd needs is one guy to stand up and say what's right they just need one one person to give a little courage to a situation amen that things are right I don't think we ought to always look for an example sometimes we ought to be the example sometimes we don't have to have leadership we ought to be the leader in the crowd we are to say it's wrong I ain't going there I ain't doing that that's not the way we do things in the Church of the Living God come on church I think God is still looking for some Daniels he's looking for some leaders from some men of God who's ready to say I will not defile myself he purposed in his heart now when a it's teaching me something that when a true Christian purposes something in their heart that that purpose is real and it'll hold them it'll hold them against every situation amen they were there it wasn't their choice they were there but they were aliens in another land brother bam said he he said here's some time ago my wife and I and brother Mercer he said we went down to the city center he said there's a bunch of religious people he said but we seen some woman had a skirt on one of the strangest things CU now the rest of them seem to have one on and now we have many of the choirs and everything else see women and choirs and church members and everything else and you're down in town and nobody's wearing a skirt well just go around and ask a few of them they go to church yeah yeah I go down here to this Baptist or I I go over here to this Methodist I go over here do something amen now you think about that how in the world can people testify as Christians and and dress just like the world we're in in so much you can't even tell the difference between the world and the church it's a it's a truth brother B said his wife actually actually said something about it and she said well she says she said my wife said well said uh you see they're they're not of our citizenship amen because the wife's asking him brother brother brandom now why is it that that that these girls are wearing these kind of clothes and acting like this and you're asking the church to go this other direction and brother Bram said because we're not the same we're not of the same citizenship and she said yeah but but we're all Americans and brother R said we're not Americans that's beautiful isn't it but we're not Americans you said we are Americans well we are Americans naturally but see America has a spirit and that spirit is the spirit of Le oysa that's the kind of spirit that's on America the American Spirit y'all y'all know what I'm saying amen look at the immorality look at the ungodliness that sets upon the land it's the American Spirit now a child that's been born of God is don't have an American Spirit they have received another spirit they come from another place they have another kind of citizenship they are the sons and daughters of God we are not just American Born we are Heavenly born you were born with a spirit water blood and spirit from your mother's womb that was your first birth which made you an American but by the grace of God we've been given another birth we have been given another Spirit we have been given another dispensation within our beings we have become citizens of of another kingdom with another set of laws with another set of realities now I I I I want I want to say this brother bam said it like this he says see he said but well uh honey you see each Nation lives on the spirit of the nation and it's a national Spirit he said well then we would be living on an American spiry but we're born again we live on a Heavenly spirit with Holiness and righteousness we're not Americans as far as it goes because America is just an Earthly Nation but when a man in Germany or Switzerland or wherever he may be when he becomes heaven born he takes a Heavenly spirit and his nature and his makeup look for things above where Christ set at the right hand how we ought to remember that that he died that we might be able to be fortified from the thing inoculated from it so Daniel was literally an alien in another world which is representing you living here as an alien of another world isn't it something amen that the way people had beg to drift in this nation now let's just say something very very carefully here because when Daniel was in the court of the king the king's meat the king's ways the king's prop that was the thing to do it it it wasn't the people that were eating that meat and they were going that way it wasn't withstanding nothing it was the king's meat who wouldn't who wouldn't in all the land of Babylon who wouldn't have enjoyed to go into the king's Chambers and eat the same portions that a king ate every day am me the the the the the the the trainers of Daniel must have looked at him and said what's the matter with you this is the same food we fed the king this morning and you're saying it is a defilement to you amen you you see the man amen called what they thought was the best in the land a defilement to him what the best the world had to offer was a defilement to the soul of Daniel now amen it was the thing to do and and and I'll say it like this I don't really mean for this to be a negative sermon so let's not turn it negative okay amen look look at what's happened here amen that that the soul of Daniel is going to be defiled by partaking of this but it is the thing to do so I think we could learn a lesson as a church that just because something is legal don't make it right now that's a big statement is it just because it's legal don't make it right is that right because what you have to remember is originally the laws of America was based on the Bible but watch what happens as the moral decay of a Nation takes place the laws are constantly changing with the nation the laws listen there was a a time that whiskey was outlawed in this America I come up in in Northern Arkansas you had to drive an hour and a half in any direction to find a liquor store because it was a dry county after dry county because some of the churches had got together and had bought up all the liquor license that was pretty smart of them wasn't it it was only like I I worked in the city Jonesboro I think there was five or six liquor license and you look it up I think three or four of them belong to the First Baptist Church they bought the liquor license to keep them from building bars in the cities they they were doing their best right there in Northern AR all keep all the liquor out of the church out of the people see because watch but after the people wanted liquor after a while they made it legal and now look at the damage that is done unto the nation that we're living in look at the look at the homes this morning that have been wrecked by whiskey and beer and alcohol Good Men started out with just a little social drink you know just a little little whine for the stomach's sake and I'm sorry I guess I'm just going to have to preach but but they start out with just a little whine and even right here in the message of the hour people starting to backslide that think it's okay to sit down and oh I felt that one amen they sit down and think it's okay just to drink a little wine let me let me let me prophesy something to you that wine is going to turn to something a little better and it's going to get a little more often and after a little while amen you're going to be you're going to be embarrassed by your natural habits that have taken away the joy of the Lord out of your life because if you want to drink wine if you want to drink wine come to the house of God and don't sit on the on the Pew like a bump on the log get into the word of God and let it turn to stimulated power you can get drunk in the house of God and satisfy your desire to drink wine you can drink till every nervousness is gone until every confusion leaves your mind we do not have to partake of the tables of the wines of this world to rejoice in the in the in the presence of the wine of God come on Church you know God has a way to give you everything the king wanted to give you his way we got another king and he gives you everything that you need through his word he said prove it in the Bible amen Daniel talked him into a 10day trial he said this just don't give it to me and you feed me water and pulk for 10 days and see if I don't Prosper just as well as them that's defiling theirselves other words whatever you think the king's meat's going to do for them give me pul and water and my God will do for me supernaturally what they're going to get in the natural amen let me tell you you never turned down nothing from the devil and suffered amen a loss in your life because God will prosper a man that will sanctify his life to the things of God ah we might as well get it I I guess I ain't done amen but I found out that we we got message people now sitting at their dinner tables drinking wine amen like the world does oh see brother Ray I guess we just ain't High Society enough you know we we ain't got that we ain't got that high in life yet I pray I never get that high I pray I never get so up that I can turn my nose away from a thing that a prophet of God said and drink make a bunch of wine at a dinner table and influence my children against the things that a prophet of God taught brother Bram said he was a Nazarite from his birth don't never drink don't never smoke don't never touch the thing are you with me and every son or daughter of God that has been born of the Holy Ghost is a Nazarite in its vow and you got no right to the things of the world you ought to purpose in your heart this morning I will not defile myself oh we got that devil on the Run come on help me there's there's a little devil fighting that we got it on the Run come on you know it's wrong you know that thing's wrong you ought to take it out of your house take it out of your refrigerator and if you think this preacher is scared of you because you drink alcohol this preacher will die before I ever bow my knee to some drinking devil it's ruined homes it's ruined lives and it's ruining you it's marrowing your conscience said preacher what in the world are you doing the Bible said Jeremiah prophesied against them now I read my Bible and it said had the people hearkened to Jeremiah the city wouldn't been destroyed but because there was some false preachers the Bible says it they were false preachers and prophesied the popularity and they wouldn't come against the devil and since they wouldn't do it the people amen crucified Jeremiah for preaching the way he preached and they followed the lies of the devil but watch what happens in a few short years zedekiah was the king remember zedekiah was the king that Jeremiah prophesied to do you know zedekiah amen was taken captive this is a good reading zedekiah was taken captive do you know that he watched his sons die he watched his kingdom burn to the ground and was put in Chains and they didn't kill him to last they put out his eyes but they didn't put out his eyes before he could see his kingdom burn before he could see his sons die amen they made him watch the path of his destruction and the old devil is so cruel if you serveing he'll let you live long enough to see your family destroyed to see your life destroyed that Devil is a devil and he's out to destroy you but God has come that you may have life and may have it more abundantly well in case you're wondering where I'm at yes it's wrong for a family to sit around a table and drink it's wrong for a mom and daddy to sit around a table and drink there's a lot of dads in here don't have much respect from the oh my goodness can I preach there some fathers that don't have much respect out of their homes and they're wondering I got to beat my wife and submiss if you would live a clean life in front of that woman she would respect your life and she would respect you but how can you cause a woman to respect you when you live like a pig you live like a hog you're not a hog you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God come on up out of that thing this morning and let the presence of God come into your life I have I have purposed in my heart I will not defile myself with this Le c age I'll not B I'll not break to it you can tire and feather me you can put me out you can crucify me you can indict me you can say I'm a crazy fanatical preacher amen but up in heaven the things that I believe they believe up there from my homeland this is the word of the Lord may not be the law of America but it's the law in heaven oh my is it odd how the Holy Spirit goes by and picks things up just cuz they legalized that dop that marijuana don't mean you ought to smoke it oh oh yeah it's becoming the popular thing now ain't it oh yeah it's legal brother Wayne it's legal that thing is of the devil it was of the devil when it started and it's of the devil when it's end and no matter how much this godforsaken nation says it's right it'll be wrong it's destroyed homes and lives and minds and it'll destroy your home your life your mind it'll destroy your soul you know why they've legalized it you want me to tell you the truth you want to tell you why they legalized it why they're legalizing it is because the people are so sinful in their lives their souls are tore up and they can't get any peace so they're doing their best to drink peace in them to smoke peace in them to bring something in them but Jesus said yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you shall see me for I will be with you even in you I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you he is my comfort he is my peace he is my reward he is my life I'm not lacking this morning I've got the Holy Ghost and power there's a reality in the word of God I'll not def myself with the things of this world he said Preacher what's wrong with you I tell you what's wrong there's an entire nation going against what the word of God says I'll not defy myself with it aliens weird I'll tell you what Paul said you were but peculiar peculiar let me tell you what brother Bram called you Oddball oh you're the guy don't want to dance at the wedding yeah I'm that guy I believe in Christian weddings oh my Lord what are we going to do this morning right I'll be a church left when I'm done we believe in Christian weddings around here no I'm I'm not I'm just not that guy you know it's amazing to me that over in India they have they have traditions in India in India the Traditions have so influenced their weddings that they can't tell the difference between Christian weddings and Hindu religion but the pastors in India when I come there ask me the silliest questions like how to perform a wedding I'm thinking You' already know how to do a wedding it's simple but because of where they live it so influences their weddings y'all ever been to an African wedding well it's interesting Brother Ray you should never take an African wedding I I'm just tell you right now you can't handle it day three hours late brother brother brother Ray would not be happy they show up three hours late no joke they come when they want to that's just the tradition of it now is that right really is that right to tell somebody you'll be there at 2:00 and then you don't show up till 5: that's not right if you want to show up at 5:00 tell them I'm supposed to be there at 2: but I won't be there at 5:00 so take a take a relax come on come on Alex I get a big amen out of you we've set in them hotels in Africa for hours waiting on them guys I'm going to give y'all a secret I found out something they picked it up a little when they get around me I tell y'all a trick what you do is you don't get dressed till they get there so they wait on you an hour and you cut them down in your hotel room said hey can we serve you some coffee y'all just sat down there no brother we got to go no no we got plenty of time sit down you know what they do they show up early next time they got they got to get this guy cuz he takes forever to get dressed they're African weddings they they get out and they play a uh they play African music they dance to African music they they act like Africans but they're but but Christians should be Christians I don't care if you're in Africa or India or America or where you are it ought to be a Christian thing a way a Christian does things a way a Christian Acts we don't drink believers do not [Music] drink this part's with me how about y'all over there Christians don't drink is that right you know what we don't even smoke we don't go to dances we don't go to parties y'all say what in the world do y'all do for fun hey you ever been to church with us have you ever been to church with us we don't come to church to cross our arms and look at the preacher for 2 hours we come to the house of God to worship to praise to get in a holy ghost atmosphere where the entertainment of the spirit moves in the heart of the Believers and they raise up in power and anointing and enjoy the things of God Amen don't feel sorry for me because I don't have the world I got Jesus you can have the world I got Jes Jesus I got the Holy Ghost I got the power of God I don't have to have wine to get drunk I don't have to have dope to get high I can go into the presence of God oh Church come on up high with things are it's all a perversion of the things of God well I tell you brother Wayne I want to see things so they take that dope it's hucog enic right well have you ever read the Bible where the prophets were lifted up and they saw 3 or 4,000 years and and 2,000 years in the future and in the past but it wasn't they wasn't hallucinating false things they were seeing real things because a real high gives you real reality and a real picture of the future amen but a false High gives you a false huci in it it makes you see things in an altered state and you believe you're right when you're wrong but by the grace of God that your purpose in his heart I will live a separated life no matter where you put me no matter what happens in my life I will not defile myself said brother Wayne but everybody around me change it change the atmosphere you may not be able to help going to work but some of you put yourself in position you wouldn't have to be in if you didn't put yourself there listen when I worked the line at a factory they all knew I was a Believer when I roll a survey truck and four of them guys come crawling in every one of them smell like whiskey from the night before big old Burly dirty filthy jokes I rode right in the truck with them but when they were in my presence they were kind they were quiet they were Meek you know what the you know what the running joke was in my survey truck they'd say preacher if you don't be nice we're going to tell you a dirty joke I looked at the old boy one time you don't have to be mean you don't have to be arrogant his old boy big enough to whip me and you and three or four more of us he looked over at me and he said said something to me one day and I said I said now you know that ain't right he said now preacher I'm I'm going to tell you a dirty joke I said no you ain't either he said oh yes I I'm going to tell you a dirty joke I said no you ain't he said you can't keep me from can't keep me from it great big old guy you know I said well just go and tell it then and he started telling it I stuck both fingers in my ears and I went yeah yeah he he got on the floor laughing at me cuz it's the only way I could keep from hearing that filthy joke he was about to tell me but I didn't have to fight with him he respected me from that day on I wasn't being arrogant I just didn't want to be defiled you don't have to be mean and AR am but you got to set your heart I will not be defiled I will not live like this world lives I will not be the way they are and there are some people in this land that's like Daniel you know that the scripture tells us of a of a girl taken slave who was from Israel and went to non's house another great leader but was a Syrian do you know that girl had such a testimony with God she was a slave in the house of the Syrian of the Syrian Chief who was a who was a a leper but her atmosphere was so set apart until she told the leper by inspiration if You' go down to to Israel we got a prophet in the land down there and you could be healed look at her testimony she never lost it even when she was a slave she never lost the reality of the God she was serving and her a slave in Syria was in better shape than the king that was in Israel yeah so how do you get to that cuz when the nonon went first thing they done was send him to the king and the King ripped his garments and said I don't know how we're going to help you that's right a king living in a country with Elijah and didn't know how to help them but that little girl knew she knew if you get in the presence of that Prophet God will change you see she set her testimony apart even though she was a Play Amen I I I don't believe you ought to have to push on people be mean to people but you ought to keep your testimony you are to you are to testify for this word somebody's sick around you amen if you knew of a if you knew of a peel that would heal somebody of cancer now now y'all know I'm telling you the truth cuz we got so many of them essential essential oil salesman Among Us now that they if if they think an oil might help you you cannot have lunch with somebody without about them telling you 42 times of what that oil can do for you I'll tell you what it does for me it keeps me up all night cuz it stinks I mean it really stinks but if somebody thinks it works they'll go around stinking can you imagine go y'all know it's true y'all know it's true you do not have to ask who wears essential oil but because but because that they think it works they're willing to wear stink on them it's the truth you know it's true it does not smell like perfume if they ever get anything scented like good cologne maybe I might try if it worked for one person one time they sell it around the world but this gospel has worked for person after person after person after person and because people are afraid of a little rebuke or a little bit of somebody turning their nose they'll hold silent in a crowd when they are to tell somebody Jesus loves you Jesus saves you Jesus heals you you don't have to break the whole message but tell them there's hope somewhere there's a God somewhere he changes lives he changes situations he changes hope listen I I believe this morning that we ought to like these men purpose in our heart aliens he said well brother Wayne if I if I had a job where I didn't have to interact with nobody this man lived in Babylon not a church no Fellowship no songs no Holy Ghost and kept his testimony brother brandham likened him to a slave from Africa that was brought into America and he said one day a slave buyer went byy slaves and he went down to a slave Farm where they had the slaves and he said he was looking over the field like you want to buy a used car it was a shame that he did it but but it's a story he looked over and he seen one slave who was different than all of them said I want to buy that one he said I Ain for sale do you see the only one of them that was worth anything was the one that was different the one that was different was the one that they wanted to get why do you think the world's working on you cuz you're the only thing different you're the only thing with value everything else is marred everything else is defiled brother said they looked at that man said I want to buy him he said you can't buy him he's not for sale oh how I've had to tell the devil many times I'm not for sale I've already been bought and sold I belong to Jesus Christ and none other so what's different about him do you feed him something different no e like the rest of them oh I got you got him a special quarters he lives in nope y'all give him special treatment nope he's the same as everybody else he said well when what makes him different he said well I wondered that same thing myself so I asked one day and they they said the thing that makes this man different is the land where he is from that he is the King's son and even though he is in a nation and probably will never see his home again think about that he's never going to see that home again but he still knew he was a King's son so he conducted himself like the son of a king no matter what situation he was put into and the prophet of God said this he said think of this he did that knowing he would never see his home again he said but as the Sons and Daughters of God he said we know that it won't be very long until we're going to return to our homeland we're going back to where we come from we're going back to our home we may be aliens here we may be different here but brother get us up in heaven one time they believe what we believe up there they think what we think up there y'all remember when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time remember amen not in 1960 but previous when his daughter had died and his and his wife had died and he was right there to that place of losing his mind and he was in such a nervousness he was praying and the Lord took him into that other realm and he said when he got over there remember a young girl walked up to him and started talking to him and he said he said now who are you she said I was your shepher and Rose on the earth and he looked at said but you were just a baby she said but Daddy don't you remember your teaching on immortality that girl was a baby when she died she had no clue what William brandom taught on immortality but up there in heaven everybody knows this message is right up there in heaven this message is right it might not be right in the church it might not be right in the denomination or in this America but up in heaven this message is right everybody knows the teaching on immortality up there everybody knows you got a theophany up there because it's the message of the hour I I pray this morning won't you stand and join me I will not defile myself with this world matter if our musicians would come this morning won't you won't you take a moment and just say right here this morning I will not defile myself I might be an alien but I'm Different not just because I want to be different I'm a child of a king I'm a stranger here I've got a lot of scripture I'm sorry I don't have time to get to all of it but but I think you got my point we're different in the book of HEB Hebrews it said that Abraham left his country Babylon and went and sought a city whose Builder and maker was God isn't that something he said had he had a heart to return he could have but he had no desire to return he left that country as a pilgrim and a stranger to serve his God but I want you to think about something Abraham had developed a seed in that land a family that God had called him out of Babylon into Israel and he had so developed a family that when even his when his pure seed returned back to the land of Babylon in the midst of all those gods in the midst of all those confusions they still couldn't defile that seed because it was an undefiable Incorruptible seed of the Living God and I believe this morning there the Church of the Living God is of the same Seed of Abraham undefiled uncorruptable seed of God I know we're just strangers here but we're seeking a city to come let's just bow our hearts this morning gracious Lord father I pray this morning that the word has spoken to a need Lord I pray this morning that the things that have been spoken to the church would be a help to aive somebody father we're not here in a negative this morning we're here in a positive truth that there was a man who lived thousands of years ago who came to inspire the church in this last day that just because you live in a world of ungodliness does not mean that you have to become ungodly the morals of this nation have drifted the laws of this nation has followed it but Lord we got another law we live by we live by Your Word now we ask you this morning that you would see our hands as we lift them to you God keep us keep us with your keeping power as you kept Daniel Lord help us to purpose in our heart this morning that we will not drift with this age that we're in Lord now father we thank you for your power your spirit now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Amen brother Ben you got something
