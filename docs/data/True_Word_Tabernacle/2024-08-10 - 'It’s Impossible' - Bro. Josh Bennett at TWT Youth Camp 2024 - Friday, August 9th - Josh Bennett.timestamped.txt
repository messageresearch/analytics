[1:01:12] right now so amen let's just look here
[1:01:14] tonight Hebrews chapter 6 you forgive me
[1:01:16] for a lengthy reading but I'm just going
[1:01:18] to read the whole
[1:01:20] chapter and the Bible says therefore
[1:01:23] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:01:24] of Christ let us go on unto
[1:01:27] Perfection not laying again the
[1:01:29] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:01:31] and of Faith towards god of the doctrine
[1:01:34] of baptism and laying on of hands and of
[1:01:36] the resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:01:38] judgment and this will do will we do if
[1:01:41] God permit brother Brown said Paul was
[1:01:44] wanting us to know that these things are
[1:01:46] absolutely essential very important to
[1:01:49] the church but but yet there's um you
[1:01:53] know we can't just lay the foundation
[1:01:55] over and over we got to go on to
[1:01:58] Perfection
[1:02:00] Amen in the verse four it says for it is
[1:02:03] impossible for those who were once
[1:02:05] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:02:07] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:02:09] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:02:11] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:02:14] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:02:17] them again unto repentance seeing they
[1:02:20] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:02:22] aresh and put him to an open shame for
[1:02:26] the Earth which drinketh in the rain
[1:02:28] that cometh off upon it and bringeth
[1:02:30] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:02:33] dressed receiveth blessing from God but
[1:02:37] that which beareth thorns and briers is
[1:02:39] rejected and is n unto cursing whose end
[1:02:43] is to be
[1:02:44] burned but beloved we are persuaded
[1:02:48] better things of you and things that
[1:02:51] accompany salvation though we thus speak
[1:02:54] for God is Not unrighteous to for forget
[1:02:56] your work and labor of love which you
[1:02:58] have showed toward his name and that you
[1:03:00] have ministered to the Saints and do
[1:03:02] Minister and we desire that every one of
[1:03:05] you do show the same diligence to the
[1:03:06] full Assurance of Hope and to the end
[1:03:09] that you be not slothful but followers
[1:03:12] of them who through faith and patience
[1:03:14] inherit the promises for when God made
[1:03:18] promise to Abraham because he could
[1:03:19] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[1:03:22] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:03:24] and multiplying I will multiply thee and
[1:03:26] so after that he had patiently endured
[1:03:30] he obtained the promise for men verily
[1:03:32] swear by the greater an oath for
[1:03:35] confirmation is to them an end of all
[1:03:38] Strife wherein God willing more
[1:03:40] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the
[1:03:43] promise the immutability of his counsel
[1:03:46] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[1:03:49] immutable things that means
[1:03:51] unchangeable by two immutable things in
[1:03:54] which it was impossible for God to lie
[1:03:57] we have a strong consolation who have
[1:04:00] fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the
[1:04:02] Hope set before us which hope we have is
[1:04:06] an anchor of the Soul both sure and
[1:04:09] steadfast and which entereth into that
[1:04:12] within the veil whether the
[1:04:15] Forerunner for us entered even Jesus
[1:04:18] made a high priest Forever After the
[1:04:21] order of MDC amen may God just add His
[1:04:25] blessings to the reading the words
[1:04:26] you're seated
[1:04:31] tonight I want to by God's help tonight
[1:04:36] U I'd like to speak on it's
[1:04:40] impossible and you know as we see here
[1:04:43] in Hebrews 6 and4 the Bible says it's
[1:04:46] impossible for those who were once
[1:04:48] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:04:50] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:04:52] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:04:54] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:04:56] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:04:59] them again unto repentance seeing that
[1:05:02] they crucify to themselves the Son of
[1:05:04] God aresh and put him to an open shame
[1:05:07] you know and as I as we read that th
[1:05:10] those those verses there um I was
[1:05:13] studying this uh a while back and I and
[1:05:16] I ran ran across something I thought was
[1:05:18] pretty good because you know there was
[1:05:20] one commentary said that you know uh
[1:05:23] that that Satan uh he he knows the
[1:05:26] scripture and how many knows that's true
[1:05:27] even when he in the temptation of Jesus
[1:05:30] he he brother Brandon said he coded the
[1:05:33] the the scripture not quoted it but he
[1:05:35] coded it and and you know he's always
[1:05:38] trying to use and and and and we know
[1:05:40] that Satan will use bible verses to
[1:05:43] bring uh to to battle in your mind and
[1:05:47] and you this commentary said this has to
[1:05:49] be one of Satan's favorite passages in
[1:05:52] the whole Bible amen when when the devil
[1:05:54] gets ready to take take a text to preach
[1:05:56] a sermon I he he generally goes right
[1:06:00] out of Hebrews 6 because it's a place
[1:06:03] that he can battle a struggling believer
[1:06:05] see see because he's always trying to
[1:06:08] convince you that you know uh you went
[1:06:10] too far and there's no way back and
[1:06:12] there's no hope for you but I want to
[1:06:14] tell you tonight I got some good news a
[1:06:16] prophet said that if there's a desire in
[1:06:19] your heart if there's something in you
[1:06:21] amen there if there's any little bit of
[1:06:24] a thing that's laying with you in your
[1:06:25] heart that's calling out for God or or a
[1:06:28] desire to serve God then the prophet
[1:06:30] said you have not went too far he said
[1:06:33] because if you went too far you wouldn't
[1:06:35] have that
[1:06:36] desire amen amen listen friends and
[1:06:40] Satan is always trying to use that to
[1:06:42] battle in the mind of a of a struggling
[1:06:45] Christian and I know that you know he's
[1:06:46] always trying to brother BR would say uh
[1:06:49] that that Satan would try to convince
[1:06:50] people that that that that don't have
[1:06:52] the Holy Ghost that they're all right
[1:06:55] and then he said he's always trying to
[1:06:57] tell those that do that they ain't got
[1:06:59] it how many knows that's the truth
[1:07:01] that's the battle see that's where say
[1:07:02] and where Satan will battle you is
[1:07:04] because and and I know that I'm
[1:07:06] preaching Amen to real people here
[1:07:08] tonight so I know that you're going to
[1:07:09] get with me you can fellowship with with
[1:07:12] me on this thought like brother Bram
[1:07:13] said amen because we make mistakes see
[1:07:17] because we're human we're constantly
[1:07:18] making mistakes and I know there's some
[1:07:20] people believe that once you get born
[1:07:22] again you don't make no more mistakes
[1:07:24] but I I'm just going to tell you that's
[1:07:26] not what the prophet
[1:07:28] taught amen because even after you're
[1:07:30] born again and you're filled with the
[1:07:32] Holy Ghost you're still a
[1:07:34] human and you're still subject to make
[1:07:36] mistakes and and so Satan is right there
[1:07:39] and every time you make a mistakes now
[1:07:40] think about this cuz I know he's
[1:07:42] battling with our young people in this
[1:07:43] every time you you trip up or every time
[1:07:46] you make a mistake he's right there and
[1:07:49] a and he's always taking you back see
[1:07:51] amen taking you back you got to go back
[1:07:53] and start over again cuz you know I
[1:07:55] guess I didn't get it on he makes you
[1:07:57] question every experience you ever had
[1:07:59] with God and that's why we don't never
[1:08:01] get
[1:08:02] nowhere because we're always going back
[1:08:06] and starting over and we we go a little
[1:08:08] bit and then we we trip up and make a
[1:08:10] mistake and then we're going back amen
[1:08:12] and and laying the foundation again but
[1:08:14] friends amen listen I believe that we
[1:08:16] got to lay the foundation and if you've
[1:08:18] never been baptized in the name of the
[1:08:20] Lord Jesus Christ I encourage you I even
[1:08:22] plead with you amen I would not amen put
[1:08:25] it off another minute amen be baptized
[1:08:28] in his name Hallelujah if you ain't got
[1:08:31] a testimony tonight that I've been saved
[1:08:34] Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost I
[1:08:35] would not leave this building tonight
[1:08:38] until I knew for sure amen that you had
[1:08:40] had that experience with God but brother
[1:08:43] if you've already had that
[1:08:46] experience there ain't no need to go
[1:08:51] back Hallelujah and every time you make
[1:08:54] a mistake you ain't got to go back and
[1:08:56] get re-baptized and come on and do the
[1:08:59] first works over and over that is a
[1:09:01] trick of the
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] enemy is that right see that's where
[1:09:08] Satan is battling and that's the tactics
[1:09:10] that he used now listen amen how many's
[1:09:12] thankful for the message of the hour I'm
[1:09:14] so glad God sent a prophet because
[1:09:17] listen friends if God wouldn't have sent
[1:09:19] a prophet amen then we would have been
[1:09:21] subject to any interpretation of the
[1:09:24] word amen Satan was e
[1:09:27] interpreter and he come along using the
[1:09:30] scripture is that right quoting the
[1:09:32] scripture to her amen but listen thank
[1:09:35] God that we got we had a message in this
[1:09:37] day and a prophet is a Divine
[1:09:39] interpreter of the word and I say this
[1:09:42] without apology tonight we have perfect
[1:09:45] interpretation with Divine
[1:09:49] Vindication we got to wonder what God's
[1:09:52] meant and what this scripture meant and
[1:09:54] what that meant amen we got a
[1:09:57] message perfect interpretation with
[1:09:59] Divine Vindication now brother Brown
[1:10:01] said about this scripture he said now I
[1:10:03] know what you legalist has got in your
[1:10:05] mind but right now he said but you're
[1:10:07] wrong brother Braham just quoted this
[1:10:10] scripture he said I know what you
[1:10:11] legalist or think but you're wrong he
[1:10:13] said I stand on this the Bible confirms
[1:10:15] it that if God ever saved a man he is
[1:10:19] saved for All Time and Eternity
[1:10:25] you can't make it say anything
[1:10:28] else you say well what about Hebrews
[1:10:30] 10:26 the Bible says for if we sin
[1:10:33] willfully after that we have received
[1:10:35] the knowledge of the truth there
[1:10:36] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but
[1:10:38] a certain fearful looking for of
[1:10:40] judgment and fireing the nation which
[1:10:41] shall Devour the adversaries he that
[1:10:44] despised moses' law died without Mercy
[1:10:47] under two uh or three Witnesses of how
[1:10:50] much sord punishment suppose you shall
[1:10:53] he be thought worthy who has trien
[1:10:55] underfoot the Son of God and counted the
[1:10:58] blood of the Covenant wherewith he was
[1:11:00] Sanctified AO an Unholy thing and a done
[1:11:03] despite unto the spirit of Grace amen
[1:11:06] now listen you they asked brother BR or
[1:11:08] brother BR is saying well what do you
[1:11:10] say about that brother Bram how does
[1:11:12] that look he said now think the
[1:11:14] scripture don't say now that's not
[1:11:16] talking about a
[1:11:18] Christian that's talking about a man
[1:11:20] that heard the word and turned away from
[1:11:23] it see if we sin what is sin
[1:11:27] unbelief so if we disbelieve willfully
[1:11:31] after that the gospel has been preached
[1:11:33] us there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:11:35] sin what is sin unbelief amen St John
[1:11:38] the 4th chapter Jesus said he that
[1:11:40] believeth not is condemned already see
[1:11:42] sin is not smoking and drinking and
[1:11:44] committing adultery you do that because
[1:11:46] you're an unbeliever that's just
[1:11:48] attributes see you do that because
[1:11:50] you're an unbeliever just and just to
[1:11:52] quit smoking and quit drinking and so
[1:11:54] forth like that don't mean that you're a
[1:11:57] Christian that's just an attributes of
[1:11:59] your
[1:12:01] conversion amen ain't that beautiful
[1:12:03] brother man said sin is unbelief see all
[1:12:07] these other things just attributes you
[1:12:08] only you're only doing that cuz you
[1:12:10] don't
[1:12:11] believe and then he says you can quit
[1:12:13] doing that still not be a Christian amen
[1:12:16] but but but that is attributes of a
[1:12:20] conversion in other words amen you if
[1:12:23] you are converted you will quit drinking
[1:12:25] and stealing and smoking and oh come on
[1:12:28] church amen amen when you get a true
[1:12:30] conversion there's going to be something
[1:12:32] that goes along with that and there's
[1:12:33] attributes of that is that what the
[1:12:35] prophet's saying he said now listen now
[1:12:38] he said but he that disbelieves
[1:12:39] willfully after that not after he
[1:12:41] received Christ in his heart the Bible
[1:12:43] don't say that said if we s if we
[1:12:46] willfully disbelieve see amen after we
[1:12:50] received a knowledge of the truth he
[1:12:51] wasn't talking to the Christian at all
[1:12:53] some woman come to me not long ago said
[1:12:55] brother brandom I'm a Christian but I
[1:12:57] blasphemed the Holy Ghost I said it's
[1:13:04] impossible amen it's
[1:13:07] impossible I tell you what I aim to do
[1:13:10] tonight I'm planning on taking Satan's
[1:13:12] favorite
[1:13:14] scripture and cutting his head
[1:13:20] off come on church amen David amen
[1:13:25] walked up to Goliath one day and after
[1:13:27] he smoted him with that rock he walked
[1:13:29] down there and David didn't have no
[1:13:30] sword so he took Goliath's sword he took
[1:13:33] gath's own sword and cut his head off I
[1:13:37] tell you what what we're going to do
[1:13:38] here by the grace of God tonight is
[1:13:40] we're going to take Satan's favorite
[1:13:42] scripture and his favorite quotes and we
[1:13:45] just going to chop his head
[1:13:48] off
[1:13:50] Hallelujah you say well brother Josh I'm
[1:13:54] a Christian but I blasphemed the Holy
[1:13:56] Ghost
[1:13:59] impossible the prophet of God said is
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:07] impossible
[1:14:10] Hallelujah even brother venam himself
[1:14:12] had a had struggle with this scripture
[1:14:14] because you know he said at one time I
[1:14:16] thought amen a if somebody wants receive
[1:14:19] the Holy Ghost and then would backslide
[1:14:21] he'd be lost forever I just couldn't
[1:14:23] make this other to make sense with that
[1:14:25] and I thought well why is that in the
[1:14:27] Bible said it it says in the Bible he
[1:14:29] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:14:31] him that sent me at eternal life and
[1:14:33] shall never come into judgment but has
[1:14:36] passed from Death unto life and all that
[1:14:39] the father has given me shall come to me
[1:14:41] and and none of them is lost and I'll
[1:14:45] raise them up at the last day and no man
[1:14:47] can pluck them out of my hand how does
[1:14:49] that divy up with this I just couldn't
[1:14:51] understand it amen how it's impossible
[1:14:53] for those that was once inlight I
[1:14:55] thought there's something wrong I just
[1:14:56] can't get it and then brother Brown said
[1:14:59] I begin to think about I went down to a
[1:15:00] little Pentecostal meeting and there's a
[1:15:03] man sitting there he said I never told
[1:15:04] this before the public but there's a man
[1:15:06] sitting on one side and uh uh spoke in
[1:15:09] tongues a man on the other interpreted
[1:15:11] and they would tell different things was
[1:15:13] going on I thought and one of them was
[1:15:14] speaking tongues and one in I thought my
[1:15:16] isn't this wonderful and I thought how
[1:15:18] glorious them must be Angels come down
[1:15:20] in the form of
[1:15:21] men but you know what brother Brown went
[1:15:24] and he said that because he had such a
[1:15:27] interest in the in the Supernatural in
[1:15:29] this move of God Amen he began to get
[1:15:31] around them men a little bit and because
[1:15:32] of the gift that God or or because of
[1:15:35] the discernment of the word that was in
[1:15:37] him amen he he he talked to the one man
[1:15:39] and he said he was an absolute genuine
[1:15:43] believer and then he talked to the other
[1:15:45] man and he said and that man was totally
[1:15:48] different he was arrogant in his spirit
[1:15:49] and and all these things and and and and
[1:15:53] he broke into a vision and he saw that
[1:15:55] the man was living with a woman that
[1:15:57] wasn't even his wife now brother Brown
[1:15:59] was really struggling how could it be
[1:16:01] that there could be a a real true Holy
[1:16:04] Ghost
[1:16:06] manifestation listen I'm telling you I I
[1:16:09] you young people this will help you
[1:16:10] tonight because you have watched and you
[1:16:13] have watched Men that you had confidence
[1:16:15] in and even preached this
[1:16:18] message for years and even there would
[1:16:22] be manifestations of the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:24] their Ministry only for them to uh in
[1:16:28] the end turn and walk away from
[1:16:31] it and then it causes you to question
[1:16:33] everything and amen and if you're not
[1:16:35] careful it'll cause you to even question
[1:16:37] the message but I'm here to tell you
[1:16:39] tonight the message wasn't the
[1:16:44] problem the message was never the
[1:16:46] problem brother Bon was having a hard
[1:16:48] time understanding amen but he was
[1:16:50] sitting there reading his Bible and he
[1:16:51] said a wind blew and it blew it to
[1:16:53] Hebrews 6 and he began read them verses
[1:16:55] that I just read amen and he said he
[1:16:57] begin to ponder on that and he just
[1:16:59] closed his Bible he said as he thought
[1:17:01] on it he was still wondering he opened
[1:17:03] it up randomly again and the wind blew
[1:17:05] right back to Hebrews 6 and he began to
[1:17:06] read it again and he broke into a
[1:17:09] vision and he saw a man going forth
[1:17:11] sewing seed in white and then there was
[1:17:14] another man that come behind him in
[1:17:15] Black sewing seeds in the same field and
[1:17:18] then the rain came amen and the sun
[1:17:21] begin to shine on the sea the seeds
[1:17:23] begin to grow amen they both amen begin
[1:17:25] to grow and mature he said but after a
[1:17:28] while see what was it it was wheat and
[1:17:30] there was tears in the same
[1:17:34] field and as they as they begin to grow
[1:17:37] amen under the rain because listen the
[1:17:39] Bible says the rain falls on the just
[1:17:42] and the
[1:17:44] unjust and as they begin to grow Amen
[1:17:47] brother Brown said but all there come a
[1:17:48] a a season of drought and the sun begin
[1:17:51] to shine and amen and
[1:17:53] both the wheed and the tears begin to
[1:17:57] dry up and they both begin to cry out to
[1:18:01] God for
[1:18:03] rain wait a minute let's stop right
[1:18:05] there for a minute and just make a point
[1:18:07] amen you mean to tell me that even a
[1:18:09] true wheat seed
[1:18:11] plant can get
[1:18:14] dry you mean even a true amen seed of
[1:18:18] God a real
[1:18:21] believer can have dry spells in their in
[1:18:24] their walk with the
[1:18:27] Lord you mean to tell me that even real
[1:18:30] true message
[1:18:32] churches can have
[1:18:35] seasons amen when it's kind of
[1:18:39] dry well according the prophet he said
[1:18:41] amen and and they begin to cry out to
[1:18:44] God and then he said the Skies begin to
[1:18:47] darken and the Rain Begin to Fall and he
[1:18:50] said when the Rain Begin to Fall that
[1:18:52] week amen begin to rejoice in that rain
[1:18:55] and say thank you Lord for the rain amen
[1:18:58] listen and he said in the tears he begin
[1:19:01] to also lift their hands and rejoice and
[1:19:03] say thank you Lord for the
[1:19:07] rain is that right amen the prophet of
[1:19:10] God said see amen then he began to catch
[1:19:12] an understanding amen of what was
[1:19:15] actually happening amen and he said
[1:19:17] that's why you can't look at a
[1:19:21] manifestation as an Evidence
[1:19:24] of the
[1:19:27] individual come on church he didn't say
[1:19:30] it wasn't an Evidence of a move of
[1:19:34] God can we just preach a balance of this
[1:19:37] thing because people's fighting on every
[1:19:39] side of it but I tell you what amen we
[1:19:41] got to get the way the prophet said it
[1:19:43] amen it's an Evidence listen if there's
[1:19:46] healings and there's Miracles and there
[1:19:49] SIDS and
[1:19:51] wonders that is a work of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:57] and that is an Evidence of a
[1:19:59] manifestation of the power of God Among
[1:20:03] Us the prophet said but it ain't an
[1:20:05] evidence that the individual is is
[1:20:08] true there's only one true evidence of
[1:20:12] receiving the Holy Ghost and that is
[1:20:14] that you receive the word for your
[1:20:21] age Hallelujah I told you we going to
[1:20:24] cut that down head off tonight because
[1:20:26] I'm telling you he's telling some of you
[1:20:28] oh if I could shout like sister so and
[1:20:30] so if I could dance like this sister if
[1:20:32] I can speak in Tong amen I can have the
[1:20:34] victory listen friends if you believe
[1:20:37] this message and if there's something in
[1:20:39] your heart that agrees with the word of
[1:20:41] God and you can say Amen to every word
[1:20:44] for your
[1:20:47] age that is all the evidence that you
[1:20:50] need
[1:20:58] Hallelujah I tell you what that'll do
[1:21:00] that'll hold you when the camp is
[1:21:03] over and when the chill bumps is gone
[1:21:06] and there ain't nobody shouting and
[1:21:08] there ain't nobody dancing if the word
[1:21:11] is settled in your
[1:21:15] heart in the good days and the bad days
[1:21:18] when you're up and when you're down when
[1:21:20] you feel God and when you don't
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:35] Hallelujah brother BR said this brings
[1:21:37] an understanding of Matthew 7:21 because
[1:21:40] I come to me he said many will come to
[1:21:42] me in that day saying Lord Lord have we
[1:21:44] not cast out devils in have we not done
[1:21:46] all these things and what will we say
[1:21:48] depart from me ye that were con I never
[1:21:51] knew you
[1:22:00] see if they shall follow
[1:22:05] away if they shall fall
[1:22:08] away I thought about that fall
[1:22:11] away I got to looking at if they shall
[1:22:14] fall away see and that word fall away
[1:22:17] it's it's got a much deeper meaning than
[1:22:19] just
[1:22:22] fall says to fall away is is to dep
[1:22:25] depart
[1:22:28] from depart from the true
[1:22:33] Faith amen and from worship of
[1:22:37] Jehovah to fall away to turn from and
[1:22:41] walk in
[1:22:42] error and see Satan would like to
[1:22:44] misinterpret that to you and just tell
[1:22:46] you every time you
[1:22:48] fall you fell
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:52] away but I want to tell you tonight amen
[1:22:55] you can
[1:22:57] fall I'm going to prove it to you by the
[1:22:59] prophets you can fall but brother if
[1:23:03] you're a holy ghost filled seat of
[1:23:07] God you might
[1:23:09] fall but it's
[1:23:12] impossible for you to fall
[1:23:17] away Hallelujah let me tell you tonight
[1:23:20] and I want the devil and all hell to
[1:23:22] know I have failed many times
[1:23:25] and I'll foul again but brother amen
[1:23:29] there is something settled in my heart I
[1:23:32] can't not I will not I will
[1:23:38] never fall
[1:23:42] away I'll never say this message is
[1:23:45] wrong I will never walk away from the
[1:23:48] say the Lord I will never deny what God
[1:23:51] has done in this day
[1:23:56] fall down you better believe it fall
[1:23:58] away it's
[1:24:07] impossible
[1:24:09] Hallelujah cuz the Bible says a
[1:24:11] righteous man fth seven times and riseth
[1:24:16] again hallelujah amen listen friends I
[1:24:19] got a scripture for you tonight A
[1:24:21] righteous man fth seven times but Rises
[1:24:24] again brother BR said listen we all fall
[1:24:29] down falling down ain't what sets us
[1:24:33] apart it's the getting back
[1:24:41] up everybody falls
[1:24:44] down but brother a real
[1:24:47] soldier gets back up
[1:24:54] just tell you what the prophet said he
[1:24:56] said amen just keep your mind just pure
[1:24:58] and on Christ he say well you see amen
[1:25:01] uh if you don't watch you'll get
[1:25:03] yourself over in a place if you if you
[1:25:05] keep up thinking on that and and he said
[1:25:09] now listen to what brother man said
[1:25:10] don't think that you can live so
[1:25:13] perfect that you won't make a
[1:25:18] mistake don't you think you'll ever get
[1:25:21] that way cuz you won't
[1:25:25] no you're not sinless not like that see
[1:25:28] you'll certainly get off track on one
[1:25:30] side or the or on that side but a man
[1:25:33] that's once knocked down if he's a real
[1:25:37] Soldier he'll rise up
[1:25:40] again oh what's the song say Let Me Lord
[1:25:43] let me rise and try again he said but a
[1:25:46] coward as soon as he sees or makes the
[1:25:49] first mistake little mistake amen he'll
[1:25:51] be like that little water bug I was
[1:25:53] talking about well call right back to
[1:25:55] the water again he'll he just can't
[1:25:57] stand
[1:26:00] it said I got a lot of respect for a man
[1:26:03] when he does make a mistake he's got
[1:26:04] enough courage to rise and try
[1:26:07] again we're all going to make
[1:26:11] mistakes the
[1:26:13] best makes
[1:26:17] mistakes just in case you think well
[1:26:19] brother BR change that later I this is
[1:26:21] from
[1:26:22] 1965 power of transformation
[1:26:26] now we're not perfect
[1:26:28] people we make our
[1:26:31] mistakes we do things that's wrong
[1:26:33] because you see but love covers all
[1:26:38] that amen why cuz we're we we're willing
[1:26:40] that when we see our mistakes to come
[1:26:43] back and apologize to one another see
[1:26:45] that's real Warriors right there that's
[1:26:47] really men and women that's Gall a man
[1:26:50] that would go out there on the
[1:26:51] battlefield amen that's got nerve enough
[1:26:53] to walk out there but when he gets
[1:26:55] knocked down amen then get back up and
[1:26:57] try
[1:27:01] again I thought this was beautiful
[1:27:03] brother Brown talked about uh and I
[1:27:06] never absolutely caught it in this way
[1:27:08] but brother Brown was talking about the
[1:27:09] the the the uh The Crow and the dove on
[1:27:11] the ark and brother BR said he said he
[1:27:15] was showing the difference of the nature
[1:27:17] of the two birds and he said see they
[1:27:19] let that that that Crow out of the Ark
[1:27:21] and brother rown said it went out of
[1:27:23] that Ark and it went from dead body to
[1:27:24] dead
[1:27:25] body he said that Arc that that that
[1:27:28] Crow never did come back see cuz amen
[1:27:30] when it was released out of the Ark it
[1:27:31] just it just left and went from dead
[1:27:33] body to dead body he said but he took
[1:27:35] the Dove and released it out of the Ark
[1:27:38] and he said when that Dove was released
[1:27:40] he said because amen that Dove was of a
[1:27:42] different nature it couldn't stomach
[1:27:44] them
[1:27:45] things and and the Bible says there was
[1:27:48] no rest for the Dove's feet so what did
[1:27:51] the dove do it came back and brother
[1:27:54] said that was a type of the True Church
[1:27:56] of the Living God and every True
[1:27:57] Believer he said listen you may go out
[1:28:00] amen but you'll never be satisfied out
[1:28:03] there because your Nature's
[1:28:07] different hallelujah amen you might
[1:28:10] backslide and you got you might walk out
[1:28:12] he said but you're going to come back
[1:28:14] you're coming back if you're a
[1:28:19] DB Hallelujah because there's nothing
[1:28:22] out there that can satisfy God the
[1:28:25] desire and The Thirst and the longing in
[1:28:27] your
[1:28:34] heart this why he said in the token I
[1:28:36] know I'm reading so close but I I mean I
[1:28:38] want to nail it down and clinch it
[1:28:40] tonight the prophet of God said if you
[1:28:42] was ever healed if you live Al if you
[1:28:44] live long enough you'll get sick again
[1:28:47] but if you one time take the
[1:28:50] token you got it
[1:28:53] forever the Bible says grieve not the
[1:28:55] holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[1:28:58] until the day of your Redemption not
[1:28:59] till the next
[1:29:02] Revival not from Youth Camp to Youth
[1:29:05] Camp not from revival to
[1:29:08] Revival brother B say you just got an
[1:29:11] emotional workup but when you're dead
[1:29:13] and your life is hid in God through
[1:29:15] Christ you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:18] and if you're once baptized by the Holy
[1:29:20] Spirit you can backslide
[1:29:26] uhoh about half the church is going to
[1:29:28] shut down on me right here but the
[1:29:30] prophet say you can backslide you say
[1:29:32] even with the Holy Ghost that's what he
[1:29:34] said you can
[1:29:37] backslide that's true but you can't get
[1:29:39] away from the
[1:29:44] seal if you ever get sealed by the Holy
[1:29:47] Ghost brother it's not from revival to
[1:29:50] Revival Camp to Camp it's not based on
[1:29:53] your feeling
[1:29:54] it's not based on your SS come on church
[1:29:57] it's not based on what you
[1:30:02] see it ain't between you and the
[1:30:04] preacher it ain't between you and the
[1:30:06] church every preacher in this
[1:30:09] message could walk away but if you've
[1:30:12] been sealed by the token and you got the
[1:30:15] literal life of Jesus Christ brother
[1:30:17] that will hold for All Time and Eternity
[1:30:25] let's tell the devil tonight it's
[1:30:29] impossible to be sealed with the Holy
[1:30:31] Ghost and lose
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:40] it now brother Brown said you go out and
[1:30:42] sin and do things he said he said now
[1:30:45] you ain't going to get by with
[1:30:49] it can I just tell you what he said he
[1:30:51] said you going to get a good whipping
[1:30:56] he said you'll reap what you
[1:30:57] sow I think you're just going to go out
[1:30:59] there and sin and get by with it if you
[1:31:01] do and you got that kind of attitude it
[1:31:04] just shows you've never been born
[1:31:07] again you get it if you if you still got
[1:31:10] the desire in you to do wrong then
[1:31:12] you're still
[1:31:14] wrong for he has perfected forever
[1:31:17] those it's quoting the scripture there
[1:31:20] and he said in them beasts under the old
[1:31:22] on the Old Testament under the legal
[1:31:24] days offered a yearly continually amen
[1:31:26] could never take away the sin see but
[1:31:29] when you put your hands on his upon his
[1:31:32] head and confess your sin and are born
[1:31:35] again of the spirit of God we have no
[1:31:37] more desire of sin sin has passed from
[1:31:42] you that's for Time and
[1:31:44] Eternity you'll make your
[1:31:48] mistakes you'll
[1:31:50] fall this is staggering and but he said
[1:31:54] it you'll willfully do wrong you'll go
[1:31:57] out sometimes and do things and that
[1:31:59] that that don't mean that don't mean
[1:32:01] you're
[1:32:03] lost that means you're going to get
[1:32:09] corrected listen to me young people I
[1:32:11] want us to settle down in your heart
[1:32:13] because listen I'm tired of watching The
[1:32:15] Devil take y'all and every time you make
[1:32:17] a mistake and every time a a thought
[1:32:19] crosses your mind and every time amen
[1:32:21] you stumble a little bit amen the
[1:32:22] devil's beating you down with
[1:32:23] condemnation and amen and and trying to
[1:32:26] destroy amen the work of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:28] in your life amen listen friend you're
[1:32:30] going to make mistakes you're young
[1:32:31] people and you're going to make plenty
[1:32:32] more
[1:32:34] mistakes but if you got if you've been
[1:32:36] born
[1:32:37] [Applause]
[1:32:40] again you've been sealed by the Holy
[1:32:43] Ghost the prophet of God said you'll
[1:32:45] make your mistakes amen you'll even get
[1:32:47] corrected for their mistakes but that
[1:32:50] don't mean you're lost
[1:33:01] brother B in this quote he goes straight
[1:33:03] to his children he said my my children
[1:33:05] my my you know they make a lot of
[1:33:06] mistakes they do things against my rules
[1:33:08] and a lot of times even when they do
[1:33:09] them they know what's
[1:33:11] coming and they're going to get a weapon
[1:33:13] for it he said but they're still my
[1:33:17] children listen I'm asking you this you
[1:33:20] young people tonight amen how many
[1:33:22] mistakes have how many times have you
[1:33:23] dis appointed your mom and
[1:33:26] daddy but how many times is have they
[1:33:29] have they kicked you out of the family
[1:33:30] for it no they'll correct
[1:33:35] you but you're still their their their
[1:33:38] child you're still their son you're
[1:33:41] still amen their daughter amen listen
[1:33:44] that's the point brother Brown's making
[1:33:46] and listen what he said it's impossible
[1:33:48] for that man to ever be gone again that
[1:33:51] once been born of the eternal life God
[1:33:54] is not an Indian giver he that Hearth my
[1:33:57] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:33:59] has everlasting life and shall never
[1:34:01] come into judgment but is passed from
[1:34:04] Death unto life and I'll raise him up
[1:34:05] again at the last day that's God's
[1:34:11] promise now you say well brother Josh
[1:34:13] ain't there a line you can cross
[1:34:17] sure absolutely because you know I
[1:34:21] believe that brother B shows it plainly
[1:34:24] he said that
[1:34:25] Cain I I'll just read a quot to you he
[1:34:28] said he
[1:34:30] said it made Cain go away a willful
[1:34:34] sinner he willfully dis was disobedient
[1:34:37] and every person will be the same way
[1:34:40] willfully disobedient after he seen
[1:34:42] Abel's message so Vindicated of God that
[1:34:46] it was the truth and then refused to do
[1:34:50] it he crossed a line divid he crossed
[1:34:53] the div in line brother Brown said
[1:34:55] there's a line that you can cross you
[1:34:57] know you know that don't you and when
[1:34:59] you see it in the scripture and you
[1:35:01] won't do it he said listen oh you'll go
[1:35:04] on and be blessed so so was everyone of
[1:35:07] Israel they live right there in the
[1:35:09] wilderness and raised their children in
[1:35:10] their crops and was blessed and
[1:35:11] everything but every one of them
[1:35:13] eternally eternally separated from God
[1:35:16] see cuz you can cross the separating
[1:35:17] line do you believe that Cain did it you
[1:35:21] know what they call that they call it a
[1:35:24] in in in terms that there's a term they
[1:35:26] use a lot of times in a Aviation they
[1:35:29] call it a point of no
[1:35:31] return and and and it's it's it's
[1:35:34] something to describe something that has
[1:35:35] reached a place that it can't go back so
[1:35:39] in other words like you know uh the a
[1:35:41] point of no return would be a a place
[1:35:44] that could be reached maybe in a journey
[1:35:46] or in a flight and and and and they've
[1:35:48] reached a certain place and they know
[1:35:50] that you know they ain't even got enough
[1:35:52] fuel to go back where they come from
[1:35:54] so returning back is not an option see
[1:35:57] so it's reached a place that you can't
[1:35:59] return it's it's it it's past stopping
[1:36:02] at that point is that right amen and I
[1:36:05] just say this tonight amen I believe
[1:36:07] that brother Brown even said that this
[1:36:09] nation and please don't get mad at me
[1:36:11] about this but I'm just saying what the
[1:36:13] prophet said he said it's reach the
[1:36:15] place Amen brother man said I believe
[1:36:18] that this nation cannot
[1:36:21] repent it's it's impossible another
[1:36:23] what's he trying to say we've come to a
[1:36:25] place in our politics and amen that that
[1:36:28] that it's no going by it's it's reached
[1:36:30] a place there's no turn it around
[1:36:32] brother R said you could put an Abraham
[1:36:34] Lincoln and a George Washington on every
[1:36:36] street corner and you wouldn't turn it
[1:36:39] around see that's where we are as a
[1:36:41] nation and individuals can get in the
[1:36:43] same place cuz brother BR is clearly
[1:36:45] showing us that Cain come to that spot
[1:36:48] amen he crossed the line I heard brother
[1:36:50] BR say on tape amen just the other day
[1:36:52] he said there was a woman in the meeting
[1:36:54] last night he said I believe that she
[1:36:56] crossed the line between uh mercy and
[1:36:59] judgment in the meeting that night
[1:37:01] brother B amen by that discernment was
[1:37:03] watching that and he saw that she had
[1:37:05] crossed that line amen but listen for I
[1:37:07] want to tell you this tonight if there's
[1:37:09] a line in the
[1:37:15] negative if you can get to a
[1:37:18] place that there ain't no going back and
[1:37:21] there's no repenting and there's no
[1:37:23] turning around around that's where Cain
[1:37:24] got cuz the Bible said he walked out of
[1:37:27] the presence of
[1:37:30] God but brother if there's a play if
[1:37:32] there's a line in the
[1:37:35] negative I believe there's also a line
[1:37:37] in the
[1:37:40] positive I believe there's a place where
[1:37:42] you can
[1:37:43] get by the true baptism of the Holy
[1:37:46] Ghost there is a place that you can get
[1:37:49] as a real believer brother there ain't
[1:37:51] no going back there there ain't no
[1:37:53] turning around there ain't no come on
[1:37:56] Friends there's no changing of it
[1:37:58] tonight all the devil's Out of Hell
[1:38:01] couldn't take it away from
[1:38:08] you Hallelujah I believe there's some
[1:38:10] young people in here tonight you reached
[1:38:12] the point of no
[1:38:16] return Retreat is not an option
[1:38:23] come on friends why will we go back
[1:38:25] there ain't nothing to go back
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:28] to amen some of you ought to look behind
[1:38:31] you tonight and realize I've come too
[1:38:35] far I fought too
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:40] hard Hallelujah I've overcome too
[1:38:45] much to turn back
[1:38:49] now I remember one time I was swimming
[1:38:52] across a a Cove of of a lake and I I I
[1:38:54] got tired I was wore out man I got tired
[1:38:57] aen I was swiming ACR but I tell you
[1:38:58] what I look behind me and I realized hey
[1:39:01] there listen there's more water behind
[1:39:02] me than there is in front of me I know
[1:39:04] some of you's been there before and when
[1:39:06] you get in that place where going back
[1:39:08] ain't no option amen going turning
[1:39:10] around ain't no
[1:39:12] option amen you know what they call it
[1:39:14] in military turns burning the
[1:39:18] bridges burn the
[1:39:20] ships that's what the Vikings used to do
[1:39:22] when they when that when they would come
[1:39:24] ashore amen they would burn their ships
[1:39:27] why because they didn't want no option
[1:39:29] of
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:33] retreat they call it Crossing the
[1:39:36] Rubicon and they get that turn from when
[1:39:40] there was a a Caesar back in the in the
[1:39:42] Roman Empire and he was coming in with
[1:39:44] an army amen but he knew that if he
[1:39:46] crossed that River if he was defeated he
[1:39:48] would be executed him and all his men
[1:39:51] with him amen but they made it decision
[1:39:54] amen it this listen amen it's either
[1:39:56] it's either Victory or
[1:39:58] die because once we cross this River
[1:40:01] there ain't no going back amen and I
[1:40:03] tell you what I believe we cross the
[1:40:04] Rubicon tonight Retreat is not an
[1:40:10] option
[1:40:12] hallelujah amen I say this the only
[1:40:15] difference between us and Them is De fee
[1:40:17] ain't an option either because my God
[1:40:20] has never lost a battle
[1:40:26] Hallelujah so brother if we can't go
[1:40:29] back if we can't Retreat and we can't be
[1:40:33] defeated then the only thing for us to
[1:40:36] do tonight is go forward in
[1:40:43] Victory Hallelujah you say but brother
[1:40:46] Josh what am I going to do when the
[1:40:48] Devil comes tomorrow amen take your
[1:40:51] sword and like that
[1:40:54] devil I tell you what it's time for us
[1:40:57] to do do what the Bible says resist the
[1:41:00] devil and he'll flee from
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:09] you old Chinese they had to saying too
[1:41:12] they said break the kettles and sink the
[1:41:17] boats burn the
[1:41:21] bridges amen wow we ain't going
[1:41:24] back it ain't even an
[1:41:30] option oh thank you
[1:41:33] Jesus listen friends can I just say this
[1:41:36] night it was impossible for Cain to
[1:41:41] repent you know what because there was
[1:41:44] nothing in
[1:41:48] him do you realize that God gave him an
[1:41:50] opportunity just the same
[1:41:54] God came down and said if you just do
[1:41:56] like your brother you'd be accepted also
[1:41:58] amen but it was nothing in him amen he
[1:42:01] turned down his opportunity and walked
[1:42:04] out of the presence of God I got to
[1:42:05] think about that today amen as as Cain
[1:42:08] was walking out of the presence of God
[1:42:10] Amen but then I got to thinking about
[1:42:11] Adam also walking out of the
[1:42:14] garden amen after that he had fell amen
[1:42:18] but there was a big difference between
[1:42:20] Adam and Cain Cain was walking out of
[1:42:24] the presence of God with no hope of any
[1:42:27] way back he could never return he had no
[1:42:30] hope no promise he could not repent it
[1:42:33] was not even possible but when Adam amen
[1:42:36] and Eve started walking down the Garden
[1:42:38] of Eden there was a bloody sheep skin
[1:42:41] that was slapping on their legs and
[1:42:43] there was blood that was running down
[1:42:46] and the voice of God pierced through the
[1:42:51] silence and said I put imity between the
[1:42:55] woman's seed and the serpent seed what
[1:42:58] was it amen as they were walking out as
[1:43:00] Sons and Daughters of God they were
[1:43:02] walking out with a promise I'll make a
[1:43:05] way for you to come back
[1:43:11] again Hallelujah listen to me up here
[1:43:15] there's people that'll walk away from
[1:43:16] this message and there ain't no way for
[1:43:19] them to ever come
[1:43:21] back that may be a little bit bit too
[1:43:23] hard for some of you but it's true amen
[1:43:25] there's no way cuz they can't repent
[1:43:27] there's nothing in them to repent but
[1:43:30] brother if you backslide amen I believe
[1:43:33] amen if you're if there's something in
[1:43:35] your heart if there's a seed in your
[1:43:40] soul on your way
[1:43:42] out you're walking out with a promise
[1:43:46] that there is a way for you to come
[1:43:49] back I think there might be somebody in
[1:43:51] here tonight amen you might be that
[1:43:54] prodical you might be that wavered one
[1:43:57] you might be that backslid one and the
[1:43:59] devil's trying to tell you you went too
[1:44:01] far there's no hope for
[1:44:07] you it's
[1:44:10] impossible for you to be
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:17] lost oh listen Heen I I I took the

[1:45:31] close that if it were possible it would
[1:45:35] deceive the very elected but it ain't
[1:45:43] possible the devil's trying to tell you

[1:46:51] Eternal Word of God a Vindicated a
[1:46:56] message and the prophet is tell you may
[1:46:59] fall but you won't fall
[1:47:08] away
[1:47:12] Hallelujah this is a
[1:47:14] difference between Judas and
[1:47:18] Peter because Judas couldn't
[1:47:21] repent but El read your Bibles Peter
[1:47:24] made plenty of mistakes
[1:47:27] too matter of fact and I'm going to I
[1:47:29] know and I'm going to admit it tonight
[1:47:31] Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost and I
[1:47:33] see that and realize Peter would have
[1:47:34] never cursed and denied god with the
[1:47:36] Holy Ghost you understand we understand
[1:47:39] that amen but there was a major
[1:47:41] difference between Judas and
[1:47:43] Peter I tell you what it was seed
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:58] listen to me Church you young people got
[1:48:01] the same struggles and problems of all
[1:48:03] them other kids out
[1:48:05] there you're going through the same
[1:48:07] battles but there's a big difference
[1:48:09] between you and them
[1:48:14] seed
[1:48:17] predestination Hallelujah the prophet of
[1:48:20] God said Israel had their backward Parts
[1:48:24] they had their parts that was not
[1:48:25] praiseworthy and that's what bam looked
[1:48:28] and saw and begin to amen begin to try
[1:48:30] to curse them is that right he said but
[1:48:32] what BM didn't see amen they might add
[1:48:35] their troubles and they might add their
[1:48:37] struggles and they might add their
[1:48:38] problems but they also
[1:48:42] had a pillar of fire that was leading
[1:48:49] them they also have a prophet of God god
[1:48:53] with a Vindicated
[1:48:55] word they also had a smitten Rock they
[1:49:00] also had a Brazen serpent that was
[1:49:03] lifted up upon a pole oh yeah we got our
[1:49:06] same struggles and our problems but I
[1:49:08] tell you we got something that the world
[1:49:10] ain't
[1:49:14] got Hallelujah you got a message you got
[1:49:17] a holy ghost you got the Holy Ghost
[1:49:21] [Applause]
[1:49:25] big difference between Judas and
[1:49:28] Peter you never find anywhere where
[1:49:30] where where where uh Jesus after Judas
[1:49:34] uh uh betrayed him and never find where
[1:49:37] Jesus went after
[1:49:41] him and look at old
[1:49:44] Peter one day even Jesus told him said
[1:49:47] get behind me
[1:49:49] Satan and then Peter comes along he's
[1:49:52] always messing up brother Ray he's I
[1:49:55] tell you he's one of my f Peter is my
[1:49:57] favorite character in The
[1:49:59] Bible because I feel like I just relate
[1:50:03] to him so much CU I'm always getting my
[1:50:05] foot in my mouth and I'm always trying
[1:50:06] to you know and when I'm trying to do
[1:50:08] good I just turns out bad and I mean
[1:50:11] Peter even when he was trying to defend
[1:50:12] the Lord he took his sword out cut the
[1:50:15] uh solders ear off and all the things
[1:50:16] that Happ and and and then only to go
[1:50:18] and deny the
[1:50:20] Lord and after Jesus had died
[1:50:23] amen I love this cuz Peter got so
[1:50:27] discouraged that he went back to
[1:50:29] fishing went on right on back out to the
[1:50:32] life that God that that Christ had
[1:50:33] caught him out of but while he was out
[1:50:36] there fishing Brother
[1:50:37] David there was some little women that
[1:50:39] went down to the Grave that
[1:50:42] morning and Jesus looked at them and
[1:50:45] said go tell my
[1:50:48] disciples and Peter
[1:50:55] Hallelujah he could not forgive
[1:50:58] him because Peter belong to
[1:51:04] him Hallelujah Jesus looked at him one
[1:51:07] day and said Peter Satan desires you
[1:51:09] that he sift you as a sand amen but I
[1:51:13] have prayed for you that thy faith fail
[1:51:15] thee not I tell you what I'm looking at
