welcome you out to the house of god let's go directly to the word and we'll just go right to the beginning genesis chapter one take our texts for the morning appreciate the good atmosphere we have we feel in the house of god uh quick announcement don't forget that couples meeting at the mass barn that's on saturday the 25th of this month at i think we said 6 p.m somebody said uh well what counts as young couples and i said you're as young as you feel so but it'd be the second time we've done this brother wayne has got a real good uh book it's a little booklet a collection of quotes on marriage and things and really edifying material and so we're we're sort of following up on that if you think you would benefit from that keep that in mind amen genesis chapter one and verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree into which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day and over to the second chapter thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth in the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man who he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen if you i know you've been standing but if you bear with me i'd also before we pray like to read this quote from the message leadership and brother branham's in prayer in this quote he said lord tender us and bring us to realization of this insane age that we're living in granite god when we see young women so caught up in the web of the devil young men perverted minds children dope addicts cigarette smoking drinking immoral satan's eden god it took you 6 000 years according to the bible to build an eden and you put your son and his wife in there his bride to rule over it and satan come around and perverted it and now he's got six thousand years and he's built his own intellectual eden through science and education and so-called intelligence and he's built it into a mess of death oh god take us back to eden again oh god take us back to eden again lord where there's no death where there's no sorrows that's your desire down deep in your heart let's have a word of my my title this morning is another eden another eden heavenly father certainly lord there's something in the heart of every christian that's longing lord other place god we find that in this world lord uh we find misery we we don't find satisfaction in satan's eden lord and we as we look around and as time goes on we find that this world fits us less and less and we find less and less hope lord for for a successful life a a happy life lord a fulfilled life and so lord this morning acknowledging uh acknowledging that we're looking to you oh god father we're just desiring a deeper walk with you lord that we could be transported translated father into heavenly places in christ lord in the middle of satan's eden we could find a refuge lord an oasis and lord that our hearts cry could be answered you take us back to eden again granted lord as we gather father we want to be faithful to pray for our pastor lord how the enemy is attacking him in his body with this sickness oh god may you deliver him from this saying oh god lord and and uh and and by your stripes father may you find healing i pray lord loose him from this attack of the enemy father for we we love him and appreciate him lord we dedicate ourselves we dedicate this service to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you you're seated and sorry to keep you standing lingering amen i i did want to thank the church i didn't neglected to do it last thursday but for all those in in in every way that you supported the the youth camp that we had uh it was really overwhelming the way the church just rose up and carried out on their shoulders i believe the lord blessed it and so i appreciate the church you know somebody even
