the Lord in prayer this morning also want to let you know Apostolic Tabernacle North Carolina brother Josh Bennett will be having their annual meetings on June 20th through the 23rd so remember that the 20th June 20th through 23rd there at Apostolic Tabernacle so remember that also we have a testimony from sister Haley it says I bit my lip and March and somehow hit a vein that wouldn't stop bleeding a couple days later I had a purple vein showing through my lip that called it a Venus Lake after about a month it wasn't going away so I made an appointment with the vein doctor to have her laser it a week before my appointment I was brushing my teeth and the vein burst it bled for a couple hours and wouldn't stop so I called the doctor and she got me in that day to laser it which cauterizes the vein another week goes by and it still kept bleeding so she lasered it again and turned it up even hotter that time she said it's a big vein and it actually goes almost to the jaw so after cauterizing it within a couple weeks the vein the vein should shrink back down well it didn't it turned into a sore that would not heal and it kept growing it turned into a tumor called a pyogenic granuloma basically means tumor that bleeds often it bled every day and some days I would feel washcloths full I went to a dermatologist to see if she could remove it and she thought it might need actual surgery because of the bleeding and how it would scar so she referred me to a plastic surgeon I got a hold of one and he was going to take a look at my pictures to see if I needed surgery or not that day I was feeling really discouraging so I messaged his sister's group asking them to please pray that the plastic surgeon would have some answers for me and that the Lord would stop the bleeding and heal my lip with no big scar I felt silly asking for my lip but I was dep desperate for answers and healing the surgeon's office called me the next morning say I definitely needed surgery because of how much it would bleed they said it would be over an hour long and be under anesthesia and they would remove the vein inside my lip and Stitch the top I asked how much that was going to cost they said that didn't they didn't take insurance and it would be over 2,000 I got off the phone feeling totally discouraged thinking we didn't have that kind of money to spend on something so silly as me body my lip so I prayed and called the second place the dermatologists had recommended they took insurance and scheduled me for an appointment this past Friday while all this was going on I had read online that someone in another country put salt on that kind a tumor and it dissolved within 2 weeks this was the evening after I had asked the sisters to pray and a week before my scheduled appointment I had nothing to lose so I decided to try the salt treatment that night the next morning I woke up and it was black and drying out it completely stopped bleeding within 3 days the tumor was completely gone all I have left is a tiny spot that's getting better every day I called the surgeon this week and canceled my appointment no surgery no scar no more tumor he's an on time God and cares for the little and big things in our life nothing is too silly or simple for him he cares friends praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord hallelujah our god does care

Holy Ghost meeting amen and you know um I love the way he said that the enem is going to come around and say that was just a uh just uh just your feelings or something of that nature but I believe the Holy Spirit when he begins to move on his children and they begin to react you got every right Amen to to to Worship the Lord and praise him and I thank God for every testimony we have this morning amen and amen do you know your testimony brother bam actually calls it a rock and you remember he said to Peter he said I'll call thee Peter little Stone and he said it was a rock of confession you know back in the Bible there was a time when the children of Israel was out in the middle of the desert and they got in trouble and remember when they called Elisha on the scene and he went out there and they didn't have any water and they was in the middle of a battle and he told him he said what you need to do is start digging and he said if you dig digging these ditches he said you're going to find water and the Bible said when they dug down in those ditches that they had slept overnight and when they woke up the next morning there had been no rain or anything but every ditch was full of water but said the secret behind that was the water that come out of that rock with Moses was still there in the in the country but it was bling beneath all that sand and it was on the Bedrock and when they dug down to that rock that Prophet knew if you dig the sand out of the way the old dirt you dig it out of the way that that that Spirit would start coming and the next morning when the enemy looked upon it they thought it was rivers of blood and they thought well we've lost the battle so so they turned and ran and Elisha commanded them he said now you rise up from your places and go over and fall all the trees in the enemy territory and you take rocks and you put it on every well because the enemy's Welles was something that was putting out in that in that country and brother brandom types it to formalism and he said see there's former Wells there's people going around and saying God don't do these kind of things anymore but God gave you a testimony last night you take your rock and you put it right on that former well and you stop the mouth of Amen of nayay and and brother Bram said God you said what you need to do is each man took a rock and they got over on them old former Wells and they had a rock testimony that's what it is a rock testimony and they said praise God God give me the Holy Ghost amen and you just place it right on that well and I thank God this morning that he's give us the Rock Amen we can take our testimony this morning you can tell anybody anywhere that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever amen and he's still working miracles Among Us amen we certainly love him this morning we honor and and and invite our Lord Jesus amen to come Among Us and manifest his glory amen in his presence amen I wonder if you just stand with us this morning we're going to turn the order of the service today amen we certainly enjoyed those specials and those testimonies amen what a blessing amen what a Grace amen it's uh it's certainly good to have our brother Tim pro it with us today and amen and it's certainly an honor to have him speak for us again today we're asking the Lord just to bless him greatly amen uh we are uh longtime friends and so we we have spent many hours and and many much time with brother Tim and amen we've seen the enemy destroyed the holy spirit is used so many times our fellowship and friendship we're just asking the Lord to speak to him this morning use our brother amen in a very special way amen amen so we want to this morning to just turn the service to that amen uh brother Ben if you have something amen we just like to turn to the word I know the master of the [Music] way I know the maker of the rain oh he can calm the storm make make the sun to shine [Music] again I know the master of the wind oh yes I know the master of the way oh God yes I know the maker of the rain he came C the storm the sun shine again I know the master the Hallelujah it don't matter about the storm we know the master I'm so glad to be serving him today I trust that as we come to the end of these meetings that you leave and go home just more in love with Jesus than ever before he'll just manifest himself to you and continually in a greater way thank you brother Wayne for your hospitality Brother Ray thank you so much we so appreciate your kindness to us while we've been here just treated us so royally me and my son Timothy amen just enjoyed being together with brother Ron again sister Connie and these are special times and um I'll just tell you brother Wayne has blessed us at evening ey Tabernacle many many times with his ministry and brother Ray also um back in the Years um spoke in our Labor Day meetings and special meetings tell you what these uh these are good preachers you ought to come hear them amen amen I if I were you I'd put my shoulder to the will and supported with everything that I had amen amen put my whole heart into the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen and you know sometimes um as we're here of course you know I didn't come as a pastor I come in the role of an evangelist this weekend and stepping in into that um Ministry um and I you know sometimes you know when you're at a at a place maybe you say it's something maybe you don't understand the same and uh well you can just chock that up to my ignorance and just stay with your pastor and and um you know I'm just here to edify the body of Christ and build it up and strengthen it sometimes you know we we don't cross the teas exactly the same or dot the eyes but we all believe in the same glorious message and the thing about it is is we have G given Jesus the preeminence in our lives and uh we're doing everything we can to make Heaven our home and you know I I want to give everything that I have to him I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 6 years old I uh started preaching when I was 15 actually when I sat in brother Brandon's meetings that year I had asked for a a Bible for my birthday a new Bible with my name on it and my suit because I was getting ready to preach then and I was I was only 11 years old but you know um you know we you have a a call in your life and some somebody asked me one time when did you know you was call us always knew I was call this was always a part of my life I always knew this was what was going to happen from the time I was just a young child just from my earliest memories and um you know so God calls us all differently uses us in a different way sets us apart for different purpose but we all are part of God's great plan amen and I'm so thankful to be a part with you today amen you know but even though even though that I gave my heart to the Lord early and things like that maybe you come in a little bit later important part is we were all Sinners and needed a savior we needed Redemption amen you can't you can't be born physically into the message you have to be born again to be in the message amen so ask God for that new birth experience in your life and whatever you've received from God add to it you know just press on keep pressing on falling in love with Jesus more than ever before amen let's talk to the Lord together now Lord we love you and we thank you for your blessings to us your grace is so great in our lives Lord your mercy endures to all generations we just want to say today that we love you with all our hearts and if there's anything thing Lord that we've held back reserved we want to give that too today we're just asking Lord that we would serve you with everything that's within us surrendered completely I just ask father that you would just come today Minister hearts and lives you know what their needs are and I just pray that you would Minister to them today and thank you Lord for True Word Tabernacle where the true word is being preached Thank You For Real Men of God like our brother Wayne Lawson Brother Ray Ericson that have stood the test of time and and they have been they've been faithful students of the word of God and they've studied to know their to show themselves approved the Workman that needeth not to be ashamed and we thank you for this lighthouse in this area Lord we just pray oh God God that you'll just come and bless it over and abundantly Lord even in the building project that is ahead father we're just looking to you to be out shedi and provide for every step of the way Lord you're still the same god Jehovah Gyra the one who provides and I pray Lord that you'll provide for everyone every need now as we give this service to you Lord minister to hearts and lives we pray help me to step out the way in Jesus name amen amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Psalms chapter 139 I'm going to read from the seventh verse Psalms chapter 139 and verse 7 and as we look into the word today I pray that God will just open our hearts to the word of truth that we have been so blessed with in this day as we preached not from a closed book but from an open book amen where the word of God has been made known to us in this day and the full word of God has been born into manifestation and I so thank God for that Psalms 139:7 whei shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall my thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day and the Darkness and the light are both alike to thee and then turn with me to 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 13 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep and Jesus Will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words God bless you can be seated I'm going to speak to you from that passage in the Psalms and also hinge from this verses in Thessalonians and I'm going to speak to you on about on the wings of the morning all right and and of course um as we have also read from the scripture in Thessalonians where Paul gave us words of comfort that were to be give us strength and I believe that people and men and women down to the ages have received strength from these very words and comfort from the scripture and the psalmist speaks of the wings of the morning you know those first rays of light that comes with the Dawn and it you know it just seems like sometimes that night will never end and you know some of us you know we we just can't wait for the dawn you know we we yearn for it we sing of it just as we heard it sung by sister Bethany and those a while ago of come Jesus comes and you know it we yearn part we H for it you know um many songs have been written about it by and by when the morning comes when all the saints of God shall G be gathered home you know on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection share and when his chosen ones are gathered to their home beyond the skies When the Roll is caught up yonder I'll be there it's the hope of the ages like the psalmist says you know some golden Daybreak Jesus will come amen and for the world we have a new era that is Dawning that will change the world as we know it there's some a thing called artificial intelligence that is here and many fear that it will destroy human life and brother Bram tells us in countdown that he had learned that all things that are natural are types of spiritual things and that we were to remember that when you see anything in the natural it is Type in a spiritual thing and I'm sure you just re you just um noticed in the news recently where the US um completed the first dog fight between AI controlled F-16 um you know where where did it would fly without a um human pilot and uh you know that even our Air Force secretor secretary Frank Kendall flew in that F-16 and it matched up well against an experienced human pilot in dog fights so he flew in this dog fight or this plane and and practice dog fights without a human touching any controls and so we we have a lot of advancements that are taking place in the world today and we know that brother ran and prophesied back in 1933 seeing um the seven continuous visions and one of them that that we'll speak of and maybe several of was it was um you know the the artificial intelligence on the and bringing the automation of driverless cars that are now on the road and and of course that was 91 years ago that these things were spoken to us and that was not by artificial intelligence but it was by God's intelligence through a prophetic eye by Vision that saw driverless cars and he he called it shaped like an egg the word aerodynamics was was not even invented back at that time nobody knew what that was and so they had to even make up words to describe it just like we use the word computer today in our language and and 91 years ago nobody would have known what that was we had actually speak a new new binacular today in our time than what we did 100 years ago you know but but I mean just even in our small town of of Menan the other day we we there was um an an a car driving along the road without a without a driver in it the wh Mo autonomous car is now clocked over 20 million miles of real world driving experienced through countless situations and it's that's equivalent of driving to the Moon and Back 40 times and so you know we also know that on the other hand the bride of Christ is also going beyond the wisdom of man by receiving the message it's the intelligence of God and the body for Christ has been built up Through the Ages as brother randam stated like a seed the church in the ground and came up as it were the feet with Luther then Advanced through Wesley and then in the Pentecostals of tongues and then he said now it's in the eyes of prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing left for it but for him himself to step into that CU that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our of our own it's his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't it's God himself and as we come into place he's govern the body all the way down through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning so we we as he described have come through the feet with Luther and Wesley the body Pentecost the tongue the prophetic eye and now Christ is here with his intelligence and and this is why that we can be told things with accurate accurate discernment you know other gifted mens in in this generation would rise up and maybe 80% own and other and 20% wrong or 20% right and 80% wrong but but this intelligence was God it was used in a man and through that prophetic voice proven to us that the complete word was here because only the word can discern the thoughts and intents of the heart now those with that are familiar with artificial intelligence tell us that that the power grids that we have today will not supply the need for the energy required by this artificial intelligence but however this intelligence that we have received comes from with a energy Supply of the fullness of the Holy Ghost and his Dynamic working power amen because this is the time that the Dynamics come to the mechanics and make that word live you know when brother Ram left us he left us with a car that would drive amen it was running and it would drive it would drive down to Divine Healing it would drive down to Miracles it would drive down to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would drive down all amen it had power in it it would move sir well we've had a too many fiddle Fatt with mechanics amen we got to come back to what the way the prophet left the car he left it running and it ought to be able to run down to Divine Healing Deliverance salvation every promise of God Amen sir brother Brandon said in this very thing he said what is it he said the quickening power of God has come to us to open up the Seven Seals he said what was that the intelligence of a man no that was a quickening power of God I'm so glad for the quickening power amen and so the in this same intelligence now just going through a couple of things this morning I'm trying to keep track of time so um believe it or not I do pay attention to time I do after I'm done yeah okay I'm old turning 70 this year and I'm old and it takes me a while to get going so I'm like the old Indian that was watching this straight train trying to get going and they had this you know had this building it up with coal and building up the engine and you know trying to get the fire up and he was watching he said man that thing can never go that thing it'll never run it'll never run it'll never run after a little bit got steam up in that old engine blew some blew uh some sound out the whistle and he'd go to grinding down the the track and started running and he said yeah they'll never stop it they'll never stop [Applause] it I know how you feel today amen so you know he just takes us a little longer to tell what we know amen and so anyway you know but the intelligence this Divine intelligence tell told us of a woman rising in power yeah and that and let me tell you that's the Bride of Jesus Christ who is the fullness of the godhead in a body yeah and she is a complete manifestation of the word of God Amen that intelligence showed us in the preview of the Bride that when the rest of the church goes down this one goes up amen and and that that this that woman that Christ has stepped into is now here upon the Earth and this Al those this intelligence also told us of another woman rising through the popular vote of women this is back in 1933 who you know there wasn't even women in the Senate and the Congress and the and and and all of that but anyway he said it would either be vice president or president but a woman of great power perhaps a Catholic Church he said who who would oh would hold America in her complete sway he looked at it he said I can't I I I I know it was a woman but maybe it was the Catholic church I'm not not sure you know it wasn't part of the vision that it was the Catholic church but he said I saw a woman rising and so in the 70th week of Daniel he said he said now that brings us then to the election of President Kennedy and and um this car coming on the scene and bringing five of The Seven Things that has happened exactly and I predicted I saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking and dressed in the real highly Royals like purple and I got parentheses like here she was a great ruler in the United States and perhaps a Catholic Church a woman some woman I don't know her to be a Catholic church I don't know all I can I can't say only thing I seen it was a woman that was all and I just say we got both right and she was dressed exactly like the prophet said amen even described her her inaugural dress in Royal Purple just like the prophet of God said amen and she vice president but we also got the first Catholic President since Kennedy and we have the same repeat of the same thing crooked voting that's right that brother bandam said got Kennedy in back then is now happened again amen so we we are here right at this very very hour you know you you can start checking the box that's amen you just start to click you know the first Vision you know as he went right down and showed you know the the the the king the the kingdoms coming together and and the war between Germany and so on and and the and Hitler leading of war and melini's fall and all that you go check and check and check check come right down to again the autonomous car check now we come right now to the woman coming in check we're here we're here I don't know what you're waiting on or looking for but for me I tell you I I'm seeing signs that the night is about over over amen I'm seeing a bride rise on the scene Hallelujah I'm seeing the Dynamics come to the mechanics I'm seeing a bride move in the power of his [Applause] resurrection I'm seeing people beginning to believe their hearts turned back to Faith again amen now brother brandham said of this woman now we we got both we got we got Catholicism we got the the woman we got it both in the same thing she will lead thetion to ruination I'm quoting and this Administration has had gay and transgender celebrations in the White House advancing their cause more than any other Administration they boast that roughly 15% of all appointees identify themselves as as lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer and we even have the the the first Senate confirmed cabinet secretary in US history as our Transportation uh uh secretary is being the the the first openly gay man you see and and if you just remember it you remember just even the liberal man Bill Clinton back years ago he signed in the law the Defense of Marriage Act protecting the right of marriage between a man and a woman and all of that has been undone and Biden signed into law samex marriages and brother Bram told us then he said she will guide or lead this nation to ruination and then he then he said these other things she held the people in her complete power right and this Administration does what it wants to do if the Supreme Court says they cannot forgive student loans this Administration does it anyhow they circumvent laws they've been and flooded the the country with 7 million illegals and who they're now giving voting rights Opening Our borders now inviting the Palestinians who not only hate Israel but hate America look at what is happening you know brother brandham said always for us to look at Israel if you want to know what time it is she's under attack the world courts and the world opinion is against her this is a spiritual war Amen brother Ram told us many years ago and feast of of trumpets he said those Spirits had been released that had been held up under Euphrates and he said they come there and he used and described them as they they came the hatred against the Jews and he and he said you know it would it would be against us in the same way but ours comes in the ecclesiastical manner amen but remember the pressure that was put upon you when you were there many of you were in the the the camps there and you were held in the bondage of denominational systems and there you were dying and in emancipated being killed with every kind of false Doctrine amen what did it do it caused something to rise up within us and that we must have a Homeland we've got to have a place where the word can be preached amen where the baptism of jesus' name can be proclaimed where healing and miracles and signs and wonders and the promises of God can be manifest we've got to have our homeland we got to get back to the [Applause] Bible and God opened the book for us for the us to come in now and Israel is over there in their Homeland and there they are World courts her against her and they she becomes the burdensome Stone spoke of in Zechariah 12 and3 I I'm just giving use some check marks Zechariah 12:3 and in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people and all that burden themselves with it shall be cut into pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it amen it's already prophesied the world's going to be against her amen we go we go and see where that man is got into God's laboratory and here's the plague I want you to look in the Bible Zechariah 14:12 and this shall be the plague where with the Lord will Smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongues shall consume away in their mouth nuclear destruction atomic fod yes amen goes right over to Revelation 13:13 he does wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men this is this what give power and authority now now look we are here this intelligence has shown what is going to happen smoke bombs craters all over the land of America this is what's coming next I said this this is what's coming next amen but but let me just tell you at the same time even though that's coming next Jesus said that we should pray always to be accounted worthy to escape the things that are coming on the earth God has provided a way out he's provided a Rapture for the church and Escape Hallelujah we are in an exodus we're not going to be left behind and neither are we leaving a ho behind we're taking our loved ones our children hallelujah we're taking out our Promised Land we are going in an [Music] exodus this intelligence admonished us watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North and Daniel's Vision shows us the iron and the clay were not mixed and we got Russian China Iran and Arabs joining in in a coalition America her allies joining together they W mix it's a and it's in this stage after the the Gentile kingdoms coming down from Babylon the head of gold to Silver to Mees and Persians to Brass the the Greek Empire to iron the Roman Empire now running down to De feet where the powers are divided between the iron and the clay and it is here it is here at this point at this stage of the image we all agree we you know we we're going back to Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream come down from The Babylon Empire meets in Persian brass on down to uh the Greek and down into iron into Rome and runs all the way down to the end to where we're here at the end of the Gentile kingdoms have we arrived are we here amen but it is that place that and that time that a stone without hand hits the feet of the image and will sweep away the people and that stone becomes a great mountain of the Lord for the millennial Kingdom ahead this prophetic voice told us Babylon is a head of gold another kingdom with silver brass the Greek comes down and here we are right at that place and then a stone a stone without hand comes to Smite the feet of the image and breaks them into pieces and they crumble and fall and become a great Mountain because the Bible said the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of Our Lord in his Christ there will be a millennium amen for the Bible said in Daniel 2:44 and the days of these King in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up the kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break into pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever and we're here we are here because already the spiritual forerunning of this event has happened already we've seen the kingdoms of man come down as the Stone smoke the image become a great Mountain filling the earth and the god of Heaven setting up a kingdom in the hearts of men and women a kingdom that will never be moved because he said yeah once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven but we have received a kingdom that will never be moved Hallelujah that's the promise that was given this is the intelligence that we receive yeah the book holds many wonderful truths and Revelation and Promises of the time when darkness will be over when will morning come right now still dark so very dark even the Book of Revelation shows the Gentile ages are nighttime because there are seven stars and seven lamps and they're not seen in the day they're only useful at night as he said in the church ages that he said and I quote this from the church age book and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last age golden Candlestick what he was as he walked in the first stage he is even now in this last stage Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but sometimes it just seems morning will never come you know the seventh Church age supposed to be the the shortest has now exceeded the first year Church age by here the messenger left he left us when he was but 50 6 years of age and now has been gone 58 years two years longer than he was here when will morning come we see the world get darker and darker and the haer to this coming is that that the delay will make a way for scoffers to arise yeah and they will come expressing doubt and that would be one of the signs you know you you got to have scuffers yeah amen you got you know you got to have scoffers and mockers you know Canaanites and Jeb Jeb sites and websites all rising up to express doubt it it'll be one of the last signs and in this time many will lose Faith second Peter 3 and 3 saying knowing this first so he established first first first when it comes to identifying the last days and the coming there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation you know here they were in that time and Peter's having to deal with this because Jesus wasn't coming back like they thought he was they had it all figured out surely he'll come this year and there was date Setters date Setters we you know he's surely going to come by this time and and that time and you know whatever and you know white you K that's going to be the end of everything and better store up I tell you you know it'll be it'll start there you better get ready you know and 2000 comes we change calendars people were concerned about the delay in Paul's day and said Paul said the things you wrote to me about and he begins to explain the scripture in first Thessalonians 4 you know he could write of these things because he'd went into the third heaven and so he is one who could tell us of celestial bodies and he could tell us of you know all kinds of things you know that this house of this habitation you know we we'll give way and we already got one in glory I I he didn't say it but he could say I saw him there cuz he visited that place but you know again at least by his prophetic eye he saw it cuz he told us things about heaven that no one else could new bodies no else could but you know the people were just concerned about the delay and and because of the delay it it gives occasions to scoffers and it's even hard on us who are believers right you know just recently I had a dream now this is just a dream it wasn't wasn't a vision and just chalk it up as a dream but I'm going to tell it anyway it was a dream and do you know I had a dream I went to heaven and I as I walked into the entry there I was stopped and there was an angel went and came with records and he opened the book and he looked into the book and he said it is not your time to come here you must go back but when you go back you must rest more all I woke up from that and I thought rest more I must rest more so I went to cabin on the lake and I rested and I watched the waves come and feeling the winds blow and contemplating what I was told to do I was told to take a rest but then I realized it's not physical rest but resting on the promise it's looking at what God said and resting on it oh if I can get you to do that your hands were laid on you last night we did what the Bible said rest on that promise rest on it amen knowing he will never fail heavens and earth will pass away but his word can't fail if there's anything we must do is enter into rest don't get anxious don't get worried don't get fearful Don't Be Afraid God's got [Music] this rest is not going on vacation it's not getting eight hours of sleep Jesus said come to me and I'll give you rest it's an active exchange you know your burden his rest the world says rest is is to be a complete engagement from everything but Jesus says Jesus says rest is a complete it is complete engagement engagement with the person of Jesus Christ he he is your rest Giver he is your burden lifter so it's not disengaged from all of this and other and getting eight hours of sleep and you know resting up I mean we're get we're getting more vacations than any other age ever did better work laws and ethics and everything else than anybody else we'll we will Riot for our rights but Jesus said rest is not disengagement it's complete engagement it's it's engagement with the person of Jesus Christ he is your rester he is your burden lifter so cast your cares on him for he cares for you amen humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he will lift you up we got to come to Jesus saying I humble myself I cast my cares on you I can't do this by myself I'm a dependent come on the bride a woman is to be a dependent dependent that's right he shows your due benevolence he wants you to cast your cares on him and I want you to make an exchange completely he says give me your burdens take your rest amen if we can only realize that in in your situation whether You' got a death notice of cancer or you've had a wicked past or whether you've been abused or mistreated stop rest on your promise and say yes God knew all about this and and this is a path he's used to bring me to God but oh God now just let me rest in your promise amen you know many times we we have bad situations in our past and and things but remember it's those kind of things that brought us to God it's those difficult moments that we realize I need a savior I need Jesus amen last night as we entered the prayer line we prayed with Brother Ray Ericson for him and his wife Ruth you know they were just young people in their 20s when they embraced this truth many of us were we were just kids and brother Ry our senior pastor here be 86 years old this year they started out this this Christian Journey as young people I myself was a boy as I've told you in brother Brandon's meeting now we're old men and and I you know and we we're looking at the wings of the morning right the signs of the approaching son and we're saying hurry up son you know my time on Earth is about up and we're hearing the signs of the night or the sounds of the night and and the spirits of darkness and we're asking why is all this delay how come we have to continue to wait you know 60 years ago the prophetic voice like a morning star that Heralds a day come out and said Shalom good morning I'm catching the first raise of the coming son he ain't here yet but he's coming and I see the sign of it amen he says in Isaiah 60 And1 arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross darkness of people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee but here we are 60 years later looking for the night to be over yeah some of the darkest hours is just before the dawn and the world is getting darker and darker Peter explained the delay said first people are willingly ignorant they're willingly ignorant that God made the world and it belongs to God this is God's world this is God's Earth yeah and Satan will not rule here forever amen he he's got an expiration date on [Applause] him his kingdom has to come to an end he cannot rain forever the Bible said in Psalms 24 And1 the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwelleth in there and for he founded it upon the Seas and established it on the floods right now Satan is a prince of darkness and he rules this Earth and it belongs the Earth belongs to God but he's a squatter he's a squatter and he but let let me tell you God's not going to give up on this Earth amen the Earth belongs to God I just read it in the Bible he will redeem it and he will live upon it with his people and I tell you from Divine intelligence the word of God says that Satan's Reign cannot continue forever so he says in second Peter 3 and3 and this may be a little different translation but mostly most importantly I want to remind you that in the last days scoffers will come mocking the truth and following their own desires and they will say what happened to the promise that Jesus is coming again for from before the times of our ancestors everything has remained the same since the world was first created and they deliberately forget that God made the heavens Long Ago by the word of his command and he brought the Earth out from the water and surrounded it with water and then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with the mighty flood and by the same word the the he the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire and they are kept for the day of judgment when ungodly men will be destroyed but you must not forget this one thing dear friends a day is like a thousand years to the Lord and a thousand years is like a day the Lord isn't really slow about his promise as some people think no he is being patient for your sake he does not want anyone to be destroyed but he wants everyone to repent what a gracious God what a God rich in Mercy what a God that isn't willing to give up on one that ain't going to leave a ho behind amen that he's going to redeem his children and take every one of them home amen but the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief and then the heavens will pass away with the terrible noise and the elements themselves will disappear in fire in the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment amen what other age tell me what other age could the Earth be destroyed with fire many times over the arsenals of just the US and Russia have enough to destroy this world over many times never in the history of the world have we been so close to the burning right we're right on the edge of this scripture this Earth is a Fallen Earth before it was like a millennium there was peace the lion but laid down by the lamb how do you know that brother Tim well that's the way it's going to be in the Millennium which is only a reflection of what the first day was before the fall right amen so the Earth is Fallen Earth and before then it was a millennium that was peace the line laid bound with the lamb and many you know many times people look at situations in their life and and they wonder why did God let this happen to me if he's God why did I suffer the way I do you know why did bad things happen to good people oh why did why did people abuse me well I mean the answer is really simple th this is not the millennium last time I checked now I know there's some people believe they're already in a new body but I ain't happy with mine you know they you know they but they look at it and they say why why why does this happen to me why why does tragedies happen why why do good men you know that that are preaching the gospel get cancer how come this happens to to to good people well when God made the Earth it was all perfect there was no sin there was no adultery there was no murder there was no sickness there was nobody ever hurt nothing could hurt or destroy in all his holy mountain you know that that you know but but man chose between life and the knowledge to know what good and evil is and now everything that we receive comes from that tree of knowledge and we come of that to know good and evil so everything good evil comes with it I mean you you can't even take any kind of medicine without looking at all the side effects something else is destroying your body these heart attacks this man has had because of the chemo the the dead pancreas that he has caus of the chemo you you see it's it's it it's knowledge and and here is fighting cancer and keeping that a bay while it's destroying the rest of the body amen now so everything we receive that is good evil comes with it it's it's a world with a mixture the good that wonderful moment that a baby is born the The Joy the excitement and with that same child one day evil will come and someone will lay it in a grave every young man standing before the altar with a pretty beautiful bride will one day close the other's eyes in death we don't think of that in that moment but some of us have lived to experience that Satan rules the Earth as a prince of this world and he gets into people and he hurts other people why won't God stop it he will but because man chose this when he chose to know good and evil God has allowed us to live in these decrepit and temporary bodies and he's put an expiration date on every person that comes in this world and he said you simply can't live in these bodies forever I I'm going to yes you know you've chose this way and and even you've chose for for men to be born this way and born of the sexual birth instead of the spoken word like sons of God were to be born to and I I'll bring that around and they'll have a new birth and they'll be born to the spoken word but I tell you I tell you the bodies that you're they're going to get are going to be mortal corruptible bodies and they're going to Decay and I'm not going to let you live in a sin curs evil world forever amen so you see when B your body is so ravage it can't hold life anymore it isn't Jesus can snatch your loved one out of your arms no he rescues them and takes them out of this evil world and takes them into his presence into a place where there's no heartache no sickness no evil the place we all long in our heart far where nothing dies nothing is hurt say well we're in this mess because of our the choice of our first parents that's right but now it's your choice right right you're on the same basis as Adam eve were you can choose life or knowledge and you can choose Satan and hell are God and Heaven right now we sing the song this world is not my home of course this Cosmos is not our home but this Earth is and those who go to heaven will only be there temporarily and because we will come right back here to live the Earth belongs to God and he redeems it as he did of in the days of Noah he flooded it and washed it clean he baptized it with water and then some thousand years later he comes along and he sheds his blood upon it and sanctifies that that's right amen and doing that he was claiming this Earth he was even claiming your body for the resurrection hallelujah amen claiming you amen your body oh thanks be to God am me claiming you to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost think about that a man or woman born in sin with Satan the ruler over their lives amen and then through the new birth Satan is dethroned and a new king come sit down upon your thr and these this mouth that used to curse now blesses God these hands that did Evil now raises our hands up to praise the name of the Living God hallelujah and it makes your cursers bless the name of the Lord but he said I'm going to redeem it I'm going to fix it I'm going to make it all over again again behold as he read last night I make all things new so therefore he baptized it with water he shed his blood upon it but he's got one more thing to do to it he's got to burn it with fire and out of that fire will birth a new world a new Heavens right A New Earth right now I know I'm jumbling some of the Millennium and and the and new heavens and earth together but you know we're just we're just not trying to to to cross every tea and Dot every eye right here you see but you see God does the same thing with you you come to repentance through the water through the sanctification of the blood then you come to receive his Spirit where God comes to live in you when he and when he does he's claiming your body for the resurrection that's right Amen brother ad tells us in the future home he said you know the heavens and the Earth will pass away with a great noise when it gets his new birth and he said if you think if you think that that the heavens and the Earth and make a great noise he said what about a man or woman when they get born again they make a great noise and the old thing pass away and behold All Things become new you're not born without emotion emotion is an it but you're not born without it it comes with it the Holy Ghost is not some sensation but it is Sensational it is not the Holy Ghost is not a feeling but brother you feel when it comes hallu it itself is not a feeling it's a person but when he comes in your life something happens it's not an imagination it's an experience where you meet God and the old life passes away behold all things and like the New Jerusalem God comes down to dwell within your heart well when Jesus went away two angels came and spoke with some of the 500 who saw him after his resurrection and the Bible say said in Acts one while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall Al so shall come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven what a wonderful word Amen brother I tell you if I was standing there I would take it Jesus is coming in my lifetime I heard what the angel said I saw Jesus go away and he told me I would see him come in like manner but instead of coming if you read M Mark chapter 16 the Bible said that when he sended up he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and there the book of Hebrews teaches as he becomes our intercessor he sat down on the right hand of majesty on high and became the intercessor between God and sinful man so he says in 2 Peter 3:14 wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligently that you be found of him and peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of our God is salvation so he said this Longs suffering that you're going through he said is actually salvation and so he says it again 1 Peter 3:20 the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is AG Souls were saved by water well the longsuffering why why not come back then well I'll ask you what if Jesus had to come back then right what if you just close a book and say that's all my family taking them into the glory that's it these few Jews that were saved that's it it's over with but God had more in his mind there were more in his family you see I I I'm the fourth child in my family what if my my mother and dad would have said three kids is good enough we ain't going to have no fourth one like one family said I ain't having no fourth child cuz I hear that every fourth child born in the world's a chinan and I sure ain't having no well I'm the chinan in my family what if that had stopped at three I wouldn't have been here that's right what if God would have called a halt way back then you wouldn't be here Amen Brother Ray what if Jesus had come in 1967 when you embrac the message and and took this glorious truth and many of you wouldn't be here that's right but you see there were more names in the book that still had to be manifested on the earth and so we have waited on you to come you know when I started preaching in 1970 I was preaching his coming but he didn't come and thank God he didn't right you know one thing we thought cuz we had got the word brother we got the message that that was man we had it and we were ready to go we didn't realize it had to take on flesh come on Amen we just stopped cuz we started getting collections of books and tapes and whatever else and that buddy we had it we were ready to go we weren't God's got a lot more wisdom than we do amen we I have called a Hal a long time ago cuz I get in a hurry but you know the hours get weary and and and and long but the Bible said in Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward in other words whatever you do don't lose confidence in the promise amen it's has great recompense of reward even listen even without a heaven even if there was no Rapture even if death ends in nothingness the way of a Christian Life Is A Better [Applause] [Music] Way the way of God denying a man and a woman together in holy matrimony and raising up children is a better way amen the words of his commandment Thou shalt not kill or Thou shalt not steal is a better way so cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward the Christian life has great recompense of reward even without heaven but heaven will be even a greater reward oh wonder what it'll be like when we get home for you need a patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise you see so what you should seek for your life is God let me find your will amen you have a purpose you got a plan for my life and your longsuffering is allowed me to be here because my name was in the Lamb's Book of Life so let me find your will and let me find your purpose for my life for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not Cary now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul will have no pleasure in him the just or the righteous shall live by faith I don't understand sometimes I just trust I just rest I just take another step I understand life situations and I'm going forward I'm not going backwards many times we're standing at Red Sea moments and here we're surrounded in every way but you don't know which way to turn but just go forward you don't know how it's going to open up you don't know how it's going to come but you just know he put a promise in the word there's a promised land before us and we just take another step amen knowing he made the promise I'm going to take you to that Promised Land you know and so therefore I won't go back to Egypt I will not surrender to the world no I'm going through Jesus yes I'm going through [Music] so Peter says in in in the scripture he said as you wait for the day of God do your best or you do your part to make it come soon all right the day when the heavens will burn up and be destroyed and the heavenly bodies will be melted by the heat well I know many anxious hearts And Delay sometimes can be so frustrating so upsetting but there's always been a delay of course we get weary of the night we long for it to be over it seems like the longer we go the longer we wait the more difficult it is however ever we are living in the Fulfillment of the word of God I I I just want to point to you some things as we see the signs of the morning we are living in the Fulfillment of the word of God after a long delay of 2,000 years for this is the age where many scriptures and all types and shadows are being fulfilled you know things can happen and rock rock along long rather and and nothing seemed like it's happening but it's as it was in the days of Noah the Bible said while the ark Was preparing while things were being made ready for the great climatic change that was going to happen you see certain things had to be in place it's kind of like brother bisc you know going out uh there with a green checkered shirt having it you know not even knowing he brought it along and here was a vision and he was a you know on that vision there's going to be an animal with panel horns and and uh some kind of animal like that be 42 in long and you know the the details of it there'd be a Grizzly a silver tip Grizzly I I would I would um um I I'll kill and and uh you know and there's a man right about that time before it comes there'll be a man step out he'll have a green checkered shirt on you see everything had to come to place in the vision sometimes people misjudge the prophet of God about the visions and that's pretty dumb to do because again you know many people have never had a vision so how in the world you're going to tell somebody how to have one or how it works pretty dumb just put your hand to your your finger your head and say Mt you know it's it's like the brown bear Vision brother brandham had you know and and and he saw and and he saw that he was to get a brown bear and and and um you know I've been in pastor's um offices where it says Visions never fail in a in an image or a statue of a brown bear and so on and and and you know things like that and I was I was coming along studying the message of brother brandham in chronological order and and as I was just going from place to place with him he goes to Port Albini and different places in Canada then he comes back home and he says you know I I I missed a vision first time I've done it in years he said the vision transpired right in front of me and he said or right before us and he said I wasn't at the right place at the right time I failed to be God brought his part to pass but I failed to do mine I didn't listen to him and so brother randam you know in that he he tells about I I call I was actually in 1989 I was with brother bcll and I was I preached a a meeting for him there and and um we were watching the northern lights on the way home as I'd never seen them I'm a southern boy and I was watching these northern lights flicker in the darkness and we just kind of pulled off the side and and I said brother bisc I've been watching I've been listening to the the the port Albini and this those sermons was was you with Brother brandom at that time he said yes yes I said did y'all go hunting afterwards he said yes yes he said well uh well I said well what about the the brown bear did you he said I saw that brown bear and I said you did tell me about it by the way when I went home I wrote it down exactly what he told me and then many years later when he came out and told about it himself I just got my notes out it was exactly what he said he didn't make up no stories right so anyway as I as I he told me you know he said brother Bram had told about the vision and thought maybe you know could happen on this trip and you know we uh we we would the boy said they were teasing us the older guys teasing us younger guys oh y you'reall too scared to go in the woods by yourself you know you're just a bunch of Cheers you know you you're you're just young kids and so him and him brother Bram and and um Bud South was making fun of Blaine and Eddie and saying you know Billy and saying you know you're you're not grown up like us you know so the next day they went out and but said well I'm taking brother brand this way and you boys go that way brother bram's goes with bud and here he goes and you have brother brandham on tape saying the Holy Spirit kept nudging me to go with those younger Fells but he said I didn't want to hurt that other brother's feelings and he said I missed a vision and he said God I did not behave as a ser of God I didn't do what you told me to do I didn't listen to The Obedience let me tell you something it wasn't really important whether or not to get a bear but don't miss the the the visitation of those seven angels I'm going to send you and you're going to have to get up and move from Indiana all the way to Tucson and it's going to be a colossal thing but what have you do you can you can miss a brown bear but don't you miss this on that's it and brother brother brother Bisal said while we was out there we saw that bear and he said we thought man if we can get brother brandom here we'll go get him and get him here and said about that time the bear stood up Mammoth bear he said whiffed up in the air and he said caught our scent and he over the over the way he said man he wasn't Trot and he was Galloping over the mountains and away he said he would be miles away and he said so we came back and told brother Brandon we saw a bear and we W to take you there we'll go in the morning but rain set in it got so rain you said we we couldn't see we couldn't even leave our tents and we couldn't even see around you know it was so fog and everything else and and blizzardy cold and he said I got up there and uh and and he said I we sat in those tents for the till the hunt was up and brother Brown said well well I got to go I've got meetings and maybe I can come back another day and so they were packing up and and getting ready sorry brother brandom you know I'm sorry about this weather and maybe you can come back and they were packing up and brother brandham was seemed troubled and said you know boys tell me where where did y'all see that bear he said I I want to walk down the where y'all saw that way and so as they told him kind of the general direction away he went and and after a while he came back and he said Brothers he said I wanted to tell you I've been the Jonah on this trip he said I missed a vision I disobeyed the Lord but it said I talked to him a while ago on that mountain and I repented before God for doing it he said I want to tell you what I want to do he said uh what what's going to happen he said we we get we will leave out of here dry it's all over now the sun will come out and it's it's all over we'll ride out of here dry he said that sounded impossible every every tree was full of water and and you know rain coming down fog everywhere and he said they got on their horses and started out and said the the clouds started moving back and the sun began to shine and a wind started coming and whipped around on those little branches and there was not even a drop of water and he said we took off our coats and everything and rain coats and packed them away and we wrote out there dry just like he told us now there is a Rapture going to take place come on and it's the vision but don't you miss it you're going to have to be at the right place at the right time in this word if you want to be a part of it come on the word's going to be fulfilled I don't want to see nobody left behind but don't miss the [Music] vision God's got a provision of this age of an escape for them for the from the things that are coming on the this Earth if you'll stand before the son of man the word and let him judge you if he'll judge you now you won't be judged you won't have to go through the tribulation for purging you'll be purged now by the word don't you see how important it is this message came to clean you up there things you can't take with you you there you're you're a little short dresses and makeup and ey winkers and all that ain't going to be all that important if you miss that Vision you boys with your bangs and your bracelets and your S5 ways come on be a man fulfill the image of God show some headship some leadership don't G grab every fad that comes along oh I'm sorry I I'm I'm evangelist but listen church I don't want you to miss it amen I want you to be a part of it get into that word fall in love with Jesus more than you've ever fell in love with him before amen amen listen that day when the rain started seemed like another day in the days of the flood there was no rain there was no clouds there was no Thunder there was no warnings other than a prophet's Voice who with Divine intelligence had warned them and told them and the day probably began like a another usual day the Rapture is going to take place like another usual ual day it ain't going to be car wrecks and airplanes crashing and all of that yeah there will come a time when he returns back with his Saints all the kingdoms will fall and will go on but this when the bride leaves it's a secret catching away are you with me amen so you know all of this that the world is looking oh it's all go to be in Calamity and and I'll get ready then no it's going to be another just usual day the alarm clock will go off at the same time come on you're going to be expected at work at the same time come on some will be going to the pastor's house and some will be going here or there and he'll come all of a sudden someone from that other dimension will stop right here you're going to look at mother dad you're going be changed this is no fiction story this is what listen if you were 100 years back that would be a fiction story autonomous cars a plane that could even well even with the the right Brothers aren't that far behind us men flying in the sky much less a pilotless that was fiction back then and maybe the church world has taken this as is fiction but it's not fiction amen it's not it's not it's a Divine intelligence has told us that we're here and we have arrived and we're at the end time we know in that day halfway Believers stood around the heart AR and said hey you know might have been right maybe the old man was you know I helped build that church I I was a deacon there I was I mean how many have we seen Fall Away deacons trustees and yeah this one and that one even preachers the Bible prophesies of it so you say he tells you what would happen in this last day but you know God is always right on time he is never too late nothing's out of order you think sometimes it's all out of order brother Tim I mean surely it would be over by now but even like the three Hebrew children he he might even wait till your thrown in the fire but he'll be right there on time amen you might be like Daniel and the Lion's Den but he's right there on time but we've got so much that God has done at his age and yet we have not yet seen full and total fulfillment you know you you you see how he's worked setting up end time events and searching the scriptures we can see all the types of the Bible whether it be of women such as Ruth or Rahab or Esther or Virgin Mary or men like Enoch Abraham Moses with the Exodus Joshua with with the placing into the inheritance every one of them were pointing through this hour and we can actually spend hours and hours on these Bible characters we can talk about Samson you know how that you know he is a type of the church and and and and and even you are typed in Samson and the church just come through playing with the harlots and all the other thing and lost its power but that's not the end of them that's amen there's a new crop that is growing amen there is a people coming back into the Covenant strength is returning into the body the Rapture is at hand and we're going to destroy Satan's kingdom as we leave here amen hallelujah amen God is a god of restorer brother brandham said that Holy Ghost would strike a little church that's coming out of the world women that's got wees long hair and nazarites to prove they separated themselves from the world but each of these lives were prophesying of this day because their lives were not just an event in history but their lives were prophesying of the very hour that we're living amen I submit to you today that the Bible every Prophecy in the Bible is pointing right here amen Jesus would look in the scripture himself and he would tell us search the scriptures for he said they testify me and and no doubt he had been doing the same thing because he looked into Jonah uh and he didn't see himself in the negative he didn't see himself as a backsliding prophet that's right running from the presence of the Lord that's not the part he saw in there you know some people go look in it and get a negative well I can never be saved brother Tim I'm that Cain in the Bible I said what I'm no Cain you're no can that's not the part where to be fulfilled well C didn't even have a chance oh yes he did oh yes he did said don't you know if you do right you'll be accepted just come the way that Abel did humble yourself down don't you see I have accepted this sacrifice just come and sacrifice away no he chose the wrong way right you don't have to choose that way choose life like I said you're between you well I don't even have a choice I'm predestinated I don't never even have a choice no you are predestinated and God does revealed it to you upon your new birth but until then you don't know it and the devil don't know it I I sometimes think the devil gets a little idea that you might be like the woman at the well he kind of had a figured out there's something about this girl I tell you what I'll smutter with sin so bad she can never believe but I'll tell you no matter how dark her life was amen how wrong she was there was a Divine appointment for her life and the same one that in the beginning said let there be light and there was light came and said let there be light and there light upon a predestinated seed and that woman said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the [Applause] Messiah amen the devil don't know only God does preachers don't know only God does that's right I'm going to heaven cuz my preacher told me so no you're not no no preacher knows you're going to heaven or we stand up man this guy's going to heaven you know he died he was faithful we don't know that person was so wicked we don't know his last moments you you know the Bible said all judgment is given to the son so why are you judging just put him in the hands of God so well my son he died and he wasn't a real Christian brother Tim put him in the hands of Jesus nobody can treat him any better than Jesus nobody is more fairer than Jesus I me you know just decide I don't have to make a decision on this I just put him in the hands of Jesus that's all I'm going down Pastor I don't know why I'm going down today but anyway amen like a sewer he just goes He sews seed and here there but but Jesus could see himself in the scripture and he would say as Jonah was in the belly of the well three days and three nights amen he said so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth and he will raise he saw himself in the scripture you see we are looking back and this is what it does when God has opened the book to us why we see Abraham not as just a story in the Bible not just as a somebody body's inheritance and then you know you know whoop dooo my your your your grandfather great great great with George Washington whoopy dooo who cares Abraham who cares no God put this in there and he was showing a prophecy in this man's life that somebody was going in this day in their old age this old 2,000 year old Sarah that can't get around is somebody with me is going to straighten up and be changed and she's expecting a child after 2,000 years of baress there is a bride coming into [Applause] being there's an expected woman on the scene amen and this we heard last night and the as the spirit of God moved among you it was just the baby kicking in the womb it's the signs of Life coming forth amen we're about to give birth to the coming of the Lord Jesus hallelujah what a day we're living in but we're living in a day where multitudes of hundreds of thousands of scriptures that have been pointing to this hour is being fulfilled scriptures that late dormant in the Bible for thousands of years behold I sended you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and The Dread ful day of the Lord he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers or I'll Smite the Earth with a curse he prefaces all of that behold the Earth will burn like an oven and all that are proud and do wickedly will burn like a stubble amen but that those who fear my name will the son of righteousness arise there be morning dawn upon them and they will rise with healing in their wings Hallelujah the son of righteousness bringing healing that's what this message done for me prophetic ey looked out there in Joel's prophecy and saw you coming and said in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and my daughters shall prophesy my old the old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see vision and all my handmaids and my daughters my sons I'll pour out my spirit and here you are today fulfilling that scripture it's come alive in you prophetic eye come and gave us intelligence and so what happened in the Bible would go all the way back to the serpent all the way down Trail him all the way down to the scripture to the end age a prophetic eye of God's intelligence you know we're not in the first of the Bible where it starts out in the beginning God we are in the last of the scripture we're the last prayer of the Bible that said even so come Lord Jesus because that prayer is going to be answered in this day for a group of people who are alive and remain for the coming of the Lord so you are not you are not living at the beginning of the book you're living over here in the end of the book where the last prayer is being fulfilled as we speak am we are the continuation of the book of Acts we're not writing a new book of Acts as if it's another book but it's the same Holy Spirit continuing his ministry so we're here in the end of the Bible writing the last acts of the holy spirit in the Gentile bride now so here we are at this time wherever Bible promise that's been spoke of the Bride is being fulfilled right now in this day it is a day that God has done and it's doing many mighty wonderful things because it's not all just past God continues to work as all the events that begins to be wound up that has to do with the coming of the Lord when you think about it in his first coming the the scripture had lay dormant there for many many years of promises that were given for example you know I I can imagine Isaiah standing there that day and he said behold I a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son you know he he told him here's a sign you want to sign I'll give you one and out of his mouth said a virgin shall conceive well that wouldn't be 700 years for it be fulfilled but it had to be spoken and a promise given it had to it had to prepare put scriptures there and lay them for the Messiah to come are you with me now and so you see from Malachi to John the Baptist there was hardly nothing that God spoke if you go from here to the Old Testament to the New Testament there's nearly 500 years that there was not a prophet not a prophecy come on not a word from God for 500 years it looked like nothing was happening but all the time things were getting into place Daniel's vision's coming in the part there's got to be got got to be the red dragon that at Rome that is going to step up into place it's got to be in this position this has got to be here this the vision you see it it's like like when said the green shirt everything's got to be in place everything's got to be where where it's right in place and then then of course you know Israel um there has to be expecting a Manchild and and and like we're here right now in this day you know here as I've been saying scientific age Tan's car woman in purple Russia uniting you know uh every pieces is coming to play where's the bride in that time there's an elect lady on in that time there's a people rising a people who know their God who does exploits in that time Hallelujah there is vessels whom God is pouring out his Spirit upon Israel is at a pregnant moment just like we are now right we're waiting expecting what's going to happen happen then all of a sudden suddenly it changed I'm telling you that suddenly right things can happen right you didn't realize it but just think about how Co changed the world suddenly right how quickly it shut down your word World suddenly you couldn't have predicted it you couldn't even known it but you see then the same thing with with then you know here they're rocking right along nothing's happening all of a sudden an angel starts appearing first to Zachariah and then to Mary and then to Joseph and a dream and then to Shepherds and then to wise men then to Anna and to and Simeon and the temple and then after all that Supernatural activity and there seems like nothing happens for 30 years all of these promises I mean Angel come where's the angel you know where where you know I mean here it is you know I mean this promise was ain't nothing happening but all the time you know we catch one little glimpse of Jesus at 12 years old in the temple yeah disputing with the PE with the with the priest and so on like that that's it just one little window that that that there's something there's a growth happening in this Supernatural boy but you know but we don't really see nothing and you know God has given us a time of of growth where the word is taken on flesh where the the people who coming to know their God who established dress yourself in the word amen who are who who are taking the book and prophesying again are you with me church this is where we're at this is the time we're at and here all of a sudden we hear there's a man a voice crying in the wilderness and we don't know it but he's the shout he wasn't weeping in the wilderness he was shouting in the wilderness and it really wasn't John shouting in the wilderness it was a voice of what crying in the wilderness God was crying calling an elect getting ready for the Messiah to come making the path straight come on church and then you know then then here all of a sudden Jesus appears on the scene here he walks out here he's baptized what kind of rigged thing is this disbel the signs got it on the first page the cousin the cousin to John the Baptist has been anointed the Messiah wouldn't you know you see it's all made up stuff rigged and then Jesus walks out with a Ministry and he begins to defeat Satan begins to tear his kingdom down and for three and A2 years scripture after scripture is being fulfilled and even in his last moment and it kicks in the high gear and many many scriptures just start rolling in as he hangs on the cross my God my God why is th forsaken me all these things laying in the Bible you know laying there they gambled for my coat they did this I mean it's all there it just comes all crammed in the that last moment and I say again friends many scriptures has already been fulfilled we are living the day where we can say this day this scripture many of the scriptures have already been [Applause] fulfilled scriptures that seem dead and late dormant has sprung to life and God's been doing many mighty things as he as he's prepared for the coming of the Lord and we have arrived we have AR arrived at 1 Thessalonians 4 the place that Paul was talking about then that he said that he that he was believing that they had arrived why didn't he know cuz God as brother bam said that god holds Us blind to things many times until the time we have need of it so he did not want them to know there were going to be seven Gentile Church ages right right he wanted them to believe he wanted them to be expecting him to come right in that hour so that every age would go down with a life that was filled with expectancy for his return that's right amen amen ready to meet him amen so he hid it and he would write a whole symbolic book and write it in Parables right right yeah and wouldn't even make it known until it was time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins the sound the mystery of God would be finished this is what he declared that he would do in the last day amen and all these scriptures would now become to life amen now we we have seen it where the Lord himself has ascended from heaven with a shout amen it is God doing a quick short work here in this last day and we're we're presently witnessing with that scripture coming to life let me tell you 1 Thessalonians 4 is no longer a funeral scripture only for those just Comfort somebody that's lost a loved one it is now an active prophecy Hallelujah and it comes with a message to gather the elect back to the word to bring us back to our homeland hallelujah amen oh my for the next part to take place is for the voice of the Archangel right where is Archangel in the Bible Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from from Heaven he was clothed with a cloud there was a rainbow a full Covenant over his head amen his face was as it were the sun his countenance as it were the sun shining in his strength he's no longer veiled he's the unveiled God he's no longer hidden he's the revealed God hallelujah and here he comes out in the fullness of his words shine in his streets am amen amen and he put his foot upon the line and upon the seea yeah his feet we saw a cloud in the heavens yeah made up of seven angels it was a signed to us in this last day Supernatural it was the head but where was the body the body's on Earth that's he's got a bride and he puts his feet one upon that Roman system right out of which come out of the land multitudes of Nations and up the Sea of on the sea there which is mult multitudes of nation and now of the land where nothing no no populace Rises up out of there so right there on the American Spirit on the spirit of Hollywood on the spir Spirit of this end time he put your foot that's on that Roman doctrine that false Trinity thing come on Amen that it held the church down all the Creeds of man put your foot upon it put his foot on and and he said Satan cannot rise up he can the Beast cannot come into its power till I lift my feet off the Earth and when the Holy Spirit lifts off the Earth there's a bride going with him Hallelujah I'm not leaving you behind amen for I promise I will never leave you or forsake you for he's the same yesterday today and forever watch now here he is the son of man as he reveals himself his brother Bon said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in form of son of man in human flesh through the bride body that's right the ministry of the Bride the ministry of Christ is is the same here we are we're in the last day the bride to fulfill Enoch's prophecy you know Enoch prophesied the Lord's coming with 10 thousands of his Saints and we are here we are his Saints and the Lord is here working his Works through his bride he came 2,000 years ago in Groom form how many believe that right Jesus was the bridegroom now he's here in Bride form see that's what we didn't understand we we we we were looking for the meeting in the air and it's going to happen that's what Believers believe we will meet him in the air but right now he's here but where is he he's in his bride body pouring out his fullness Hallelujah of people who have taken the book from the hand of the Archangel amen who was commanded as John being the type come and type of the Bride of Jesus Christ brother brand said one man John could represent the entire bride and here we take the book and we eat the book and we digest the book keep it down don't throw it up don't spit it out it well the good parts the bad parts or whatever Parts keep it all down it's the word keep it all down digest it and let it come out as a prophecy prophesy again prophesy son of man these were these bones shall live what a day we're living we're in the time of the breaking of the silence things that had been silenced for years and years and years is now being made known to an Endtime people mysterious thunderous voices of God that would be spoken sealed up to the end time but in the last day he promised to break the Silence of that say what are those seven Thunders no they're not add your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temper that's never the been the Thunders isn't the Thunder never was the Thunders what are those seven Thunders they are the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals the things that was once hidden now revealed things that we didn't know that we needed to know things that kept the book closed to Us mystery promises that that were closed to us now open us to where now we're no longer preaching from a closed book we're preaching from an open book and in that open book every promise belongs to us hallelujah amen it's a Breaking of the silence it's the seventh seal where this ends that and then that ends this and then that ends that and everything comes in listen this will end and then something else will break out and it'll break out and it'll break out listen you can't put it back in the box once it's started you can't stop it the coming has begun and you can't stop it the can't stop it all the host of hell can't stop it amen no sir it's been released his coming has been released and now he's moving in a bride people and soon we'll hear the Trump and with the Trump the dead in Christ shall rise first and we will go and meet him in the air that's the promise it's not a delay like you think all kinds of things are working things that you don't even see things that are going unnoticed no I don't have a green checkered shirt no that ain't impossible that's impossible this can't happen this is not the place this is not the time that can't be the woman that can't be the car that can't that can't be this can't be all of these can't be on come on but I'm seeing son the signs of the morning let me just close on this you know when the seventh seal is open it breaks the silence things that have been hushed silenced sealed up come to life life begins to end the process of the end time this is a process of things being fulfilled and we're in the process of fulfillment and when the 7eventh seal was open the Bible said that there was incense that was mixed with the prayers of the Saints now it could be a million miles off if I am forgive me and we'll just go on be friends but I just look at it like this I think of one prayer that's never been fulfilled it's the last prayer of the Bible even so come Lord Jesus and the Bible tells us that when the seventh seal was open it was mixed with the prayers of the Saints I submit to you that in every age down there they all prayed for his coming they all wanted him to come in their generation I want him now right now I want him to come today but he didn't but God has to answer those prayers come on Amen but at the right time he couldn't answer it back then if he answered it back then he had call the role it all been over you wouldn't be here but there Comes A Time amen the last day where he mixes it with the incense and it goes into the heavens and when it does God throws down lightning and thunderings and voices and the end time Begins the end time begins and Jesus has started answering the prayer for his coming by sending Malachi 4 by sending a prophet in this last day by restoring the word by restoring you am by turning your heart back to believing again amen by come on this is what he's been doing he's been restoring you you're part of that restoration you're part of that coming he's been coming into your life changing your life making Sons and Daughters of God out of you and he said into motion the end time process and we come down to the end when will morning come well let's go back 2,000 years ago the Saints had been sleeping a long time first one laid into that place of resting first one was Abel he would be followed by others they would all be waiting for the Messiah they had received the promise then he's going to come he's going to come as the seed of a woman surely this was it even you know even Eve would get confused on that they would think oh this is him here's the one here's the Manchild here here's the seed that that is going to correct what the serpent did and it winds up being gain there's a delay Abel Waits until at the sacrifice that he offered was prophesying of a lamb that would come and shed its blood now they wait then others gather Abraham will gather there I Isaac and Jacob Joseph Great Men prophets Ezekiel Jeremiah yes all the way down to Malachi and others that believed under that blood offering of bulls and goats and it was a dark hour it so dark They Crucified their Messiah like this day is so dark they crucify the word in this Darkness amen so dark and he lay in a tomb while no one knows what's going on on the earth something's happening in that other realm Abraham wakes up Sarah shakes him there's a man there at the door there's there's that promised one that is there yeah Daniel jumps up he hears a noise and he jumps up and he he comes running over and said yes that's him that's the Messiah that's the one I you know he you know he's the wheel I saw in the middle of the wheel and the others would see that the different ones I saw him

of the longsuffering of God and we thank God you know in the hands of ease interpreter as he always tries to interpret everything in the hands of ease interpreter God ain't kept his word he's left us here he's not going to move it's not in in the hands of that interpreter but in the hands of the interpretation of the word of God God's raised up men of God like our brother Tim to take the word and speak of God's interpretation amen of the time period we're here has nothing to do with God lacking and promise but it's the longsuffering of God that our children would receive the Holy Ghost and the manifestation of the word would come into fruti and how the word would live up in life and and the time that we have here it's so it's so sacred the hour is so sacred we feel the wings of the morning
