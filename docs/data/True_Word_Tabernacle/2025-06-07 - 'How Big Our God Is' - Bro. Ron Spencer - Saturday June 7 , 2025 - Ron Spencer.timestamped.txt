[21:15] come for the evening offering. We'll be
[21:17] taking an offering this evening at this
[21:19] time. Brother Jonathan, if you'd come
[21:22] and lead us to Lord in prayer this
[21:24] evening.
[21:25] I had a testimony here from Sister
[21:28] Jennifer
[21:29] Lines. It says, "I have been asking for
[21:32] prayer because of my cheop did not work
[21:35] and I had a biopsy in my mouth months
[21:38] ago that they said was either benign or
[21:42] benign or malignant. If it was
[21:44] malignant, it could would be a whole new
[21:47] rare cancer called multiple myyoma. And
[21:50] I would have to get more scans. I got my
[21:53] port taken out on Monday because they
[21:55] couldn't get it working. And on
[21:57] Wednesday, the doctor from Cleveland
[21:59] Clinic who specializes in multiple myoma
[22:01] sent me a message saying the
[22:04] plasmosytosis is from inflammation and
[22:07] not cancer. Praise the Lord.
[22:13] Hallelujah. Thank you.
[22:17] Hallelujah.
[22:21] Praise the Lord. I do not need a poor
[22:23] any longer. Hallelujah. Jesus praise his
[22:25] holy name forever. So we thank God for
[22:28] coming on the scene for our sister and
[22:32] for seeing her through this ordeal.
[22:34] Amen. Our God is more than able. We
[22:36] thank God with testimony after testimony
[22:40] and living witnesses among us here this
[22:43] evening to God's faithfulness and
[22:46] healing of cancer. Amen. So we thank the
[22:49] Lord for that. Amen. And if you have a
[22:52] need, let's agree together with our
[22:53] brother as he prays.
[22:58] Father, we're so appreciative of your
[23:01] grace upon our lives. Father, we rejoice
[23:04] around this
[23:06] testimony. Father, you're truly an
[23:08] awesome, amazing God. And you're the
[23:11] high priest of our confession.
[23:14] Lord Jesus, we lift our our hearts with
[23:17] true worship and adoration and
[23:20] thanksgiving to you, Lord. I thank you,
[23:23] Father, for the word that we received
[23:26] last night. And Father, we're truly
[23:30] kings and priests. And Father, we're
[23:33] truly just offering the sacrifice of
[23:36] praise and joy before your throne of
[23:38] grace this evening. Father, we just
[23:41] invite you into this meeting this
[23:43] evening. We ask that you would have
[23:46] preeminence.
[23:47] Father, we would just ask that you would
[23:50] meet every need, discern every heart,
[23:54] Lord, just speak through your servant,
[23:56] Father. And Lord, our hearts are open to
[24:00] receive. Father, we would just ask that
[24:03] you would bless this offering, Father.
[24:06] Lord, we give all these things unto you
[24:08] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[24:13] Amen. You may be seated as I receive the
[24:15] offering. Brother David and Sister of
[24:17] Faith, if you come sing for us
[24:20] tonight, let's enjoy the singing
[24:23] tonight.
[24:39] Sorry.
[25:03] [Music]
[25:13] I stood

[25:17] courtroom. The judge
[25:20] turned my way.
[25:24] It looks
[25:25] like you're guilty. Yeah. Now, what do
[25:31] you
[25:35] say? I spoke
[25:38] of your

[34:34] you because of who you are.
[34:42] Jehovah
[34:46] Gyra
[34:51] my
[34:54] Jehovah

[35:01] victory Jehovah
[35:04] [Music]
[35:08] for my praise

[35:24] Lord, I worship you because of who you

[37:14] Jehovah Jehovah.
[37:17] [Applause]
[37:17] [Music]
[37:42] [Music]
[37:43] Oh, Lord
[37:52] I Lord I worship Lord. I worship
[37:57] you because of you are.
[38:06] I
[38:07] love you,
[38:12] Lord, and I
[38:17] live my
[38:25] Lord. Oh, to
[38:31] worship, worship you.
[38:36] Oh my
[38:42] [Music]
[38:49] Oh
[38:53] [Music]
[38:59] my
[39:04] you baby.
[39:07] Oh, may be a
[39:11] [Music]
[39:12] [Applause]
[39:13] [Music]
[39:25] sweet. Hallelujah. Amen. I certainly
[39:28] believe tonight that the worship of the
[39:30] people of God, Amen. the the praises
[39:33] that are going up, Amen. The Bible tells
[39:36] us that God inhabits those praises. If
[39:39] you study that word and inhabit it means
[39:42] that when you begin to praise him, you
[39:45] give him a seat.
[39:48] So when you're in the middle of a trial
[39:49] or some kind of situation, you think,
[39:52] well, there's just no way out of this
[39:53] and I can't. What what you really need
[39:55] is you need the Lord in it. So the way
[39:58] to involve the Lord in it is give him a
[40:01] seat in the middle of it. And when you
[40:03] begin to worship him and you begin to
[40:05] praise him, you have just invited him to
[40:09] become in the center of your trial or
[40:11] the center of your problem. What a
[40:12] tremendous word we heard last night.
[40:15] Amen. About the praise of
[40:18] God.
[40:20] Amen. What a what a tremendous blessing.
[40:23] Amen. From our brother Tim Puit. And
[40:25] what a what a word. Amen. What a
[40:27] blessing. Amen. It's such a honor to see
[40:30] each of you that is here tonight, our
[40:32] friends and the the church and the the
[40:35] visitors that are able to be here. We
[40:36] say God bless you. You're certainly
[40:38] welcome here at the gates. And we
[40:40] worship our we worship our Lord Jesus
[40:42] and and we uh we we want you to enjoy
[40:46] him and love him and give your heart to
[40:48] him and feel free to do that here in the
[40:50] building tonight and just love him with
[40:52] all your heart. Amen. I u it is a real
[40:56] honor that we're able to have a prayer
[40:59] line tonight and if you have special
[41:00] needs of course Amen. I I know that the
[41:04] spirit of the Lord will be working
[41:06] through the word of God as it is being
[41:08] spoken. Amen. And so we ask that uh that
[41:12] may the Lord just in enhance and build
[41:15] you in each one of these. I want to
[41:17] share something uh out of here ye him
[41:20] right here in Lima, Ohio. Brother Bram
[41:23] says, "Now Lord, that through the word
[41:26] of the living God and through his
[41:30] word they may find faith for salvation
[41:33] for the soul and healing for the body."
[41:37] And may we live, if possible, to see the
[41:40] day that when the great ransom church of
[41:43] God will stand united together in the
[41:46] full Bible with all of the powers of the
[41:49] resurrection operating through their
[41:51] members.
[41:53] I I I tell you when brother man preaches
[41:56] those sermons once more, Lord, and he's
[41:58] talking about Samson and Yes, sir. You
[42:01] know what he's describing is that Samson
[42:03] was a mighty man, a mighty warrior, and
[42:05] then and then something Samson gave away
[42:08] his secret. And do you know the secret
[42:11] of the church is the fire behind the
[42:13] veil. That's right. Amen. It's that it's
[42:15] that it's that logos that dynamics of
[42:19] God that's behind that's the secret.
[42:20] Don't never give it away. Amen. And when
[42:23] he gave it away, he just become a common
[42:25] man and he could be bound and he could
[42:26] become blind and he was shaven in his
[42:28] power. Brother Bram makes it clear that
[42:31] he's talking about the Pentecostal
[42:32] church and he's saying that she gave
[42:35] away her secret and she went to
[42:37] buildings and she went to socials and
[42:39] organizations and they they got programs
[42:42] instead of the power of God. And he said
[42:44] they lost the the power of the church.
[42:46] And he said now it had just as many
[42:48] members ever had. And he's speaking of
[42:50] Samson having all of his members. He had
[42:52] his he all had his members. He said,
[42:55] "But they were just no power in them."
[42:58] But he said when Samson began to regrow
[43:01] his hair, he said his locks begin to
[43:03] come back. And brother Brandon said when
[43:05] he reached back there and felt those
[43:06] locks, he knew the covenant was with
[43:08] him. And that's when he cried once more,
[43:11] Lord. And he wanted the strength to
[43:12] reach the members of his body. that it
[43:15] wouldn't just be a memory that there was
[43:18] power in the church, but that strength
[43:21] that once was would be right there
[43:23] present in that very moment. And he
[43:25] cried once more. And when Brother
[43:27] Brandham does that, if you if you're a
[43:29] tape listener, you'll hear toward the
[43:30] end of the sermon and he'll talk about
[43:32] that covenant is the Holy Spirit. And
[43:34] brother Bram was saved when Samson
[43:35] reached back and touched that lot. And
[43:37] when he says that, he begins to discern
[43:39] someone. He begins to tell them what
[43:41] their name is, where they're from. He
[43:42] said, "There it is. says, "Do you feel
[43:44] the lock? Do you feel it, church? The
[43:46] covenant is still with us. The Holy
[43:48] Ghost is still here." And when he did
[43:50] that, he cried out once more. "Let the
[43:53] power fill every member." I I don't know
[43:55] about you tonight, but I want to see
[43:57] Bible resurrection power in every member
[44:01] in every part of this assembly. That his
[44:03] strength would be there tonight. Amen.
[44:06] As we want to thank God, we want to
[44:08] invite him tonight. We want to invite
[44:09] him in a in a miraculous way knowing
[44:12] that there is nothing too hard for our
[44:15] God.
[44:17] Whatever you have need of tonight, there
[44:20] is nothing too hard for our God. Amen.
[44:23] If we give it to him tonight, we are
[44:25] very highly honored to have with us
[44:27] tonight, Brother Ron Spencer. Amen. Uh
[44:30] we also have Sister Connie here
[44:32] somewhere. God bless you, Sister Connie.
[44:34] We we so appreciate you uh uh bringing
[44:38] brother Ron and escorting him up here
[44:40] and and coming with him and spending
[44:42] your weekend with us and Amen. They're
[44:44] they're they're very special to True
[44:46] Word Tabernacle. They've been coming
[44:48] here. Brother Ray started him coming
[44:49] here twice a year sometimes since 94. So
[44:52] they go way back and uh and and and then
[44:56] uh we go way back with him as well.
[44:59] Amen. But we certainly have seen God use
[45:03] brother Ron in such a very unique and
[45:06] special way for the Lawson family. God
[45:09] has used brother Spencer very much used
[45:12] him. I uh I get up very often and I hold
[45:16] my little Eevee and I think about when
[45:18] the Holy Spirit gave us that that
[45:21] miraculous birth and God had used man to
[45:26] pray. Yeah. And you know uh one thing we
[45:29] know is this that God is able but God
[45:33] works through man.
[45:35] God works through agents.
[45:38] Amen. and and and I I know that tonight
[45:42] that God could use our brother and if
[45:44] you begin to pull and the Holy Spirit
[45:47] begins to speak, there'll be people
[45:49] leave this building tonight and say, you
[45:51] know, I was really sick when I came in
[45:54] or I had this problem and and then
[45:57] tomorrow they'll be able to say that
[45:58] that that thing that it was dealing
[46:00] with, that situation, that thing, it's
[46:02] it's just been changed. It's just gone.
[46:05] And we we certainly believe that
[46:06] tonight. Now, Brother Ron, uh we we so
[46:09] thank him for coming. He's a dear friend
[46:11] of ours, a very powerful man of God. Uh
[46:15] he loved of all of you. We want to give
[46:16] him his liberty tonight. We want him to
[46:18] come and take his liberty. Amen. That
[46:21] God would use him, Amen, to the to the
[46:24] dictates of his heart. Amen. Let's just
[46:26] sing. Amen. As brother Ron would come.
[46:28] God bless you. Kill my
[46:32] God,
[46:36] Lord. I

[48:53] [Music]
[48:58] Isn't it wonderful to serve a living
[48:59] God?
[49:02] A God that hears and answers our
[49:05] prayers.
[49:09] Don't just crush us every time that we
[49:11] get into a spot. That's right. But he
[49:14] cares. Thank you. I'm glad to serve a a
[49:18] God that cares. Amen.
[49:21] [Music]
[49:23] It's good to have a friend that cares.
[49:26] A doctor that cares. Yeah. But isn't it
[49:30] great to have a God
[49:32] [Music]
[49:35] that really cares? Amen.
[49:38] We're so honored to be with you this
[49:41] weekend and feels like home.
[49:44] and we so love you with all of our
[49:46] hearts that we we so wish that we could
[49:50] go and spend time with you. But but one
[49:53] day, yeah, one day.
[49:57] Amen. One day. We so love brother Ray
[50:00] and his family and brother Wayne and his
[50:03] family. So glad to be with my buddy,
[50:06] Brother Tim. Somehow somehow in his
[50:09] life, he must have did something wrong
[50:11] to get stuck with me.
[50:15] I apologized to him before service. I
[50:17] said, "I'm sorry that you're stuck with
[50:20] me and seems like to be a pretty good
[50:23] team." And so, all right. Amen. We've
[50:25] been through some real difficult times
[50:27] together. And he's been a buddy to to
[50:30] help me through this journey of of
[50:33] cancer. And uh you know, it's good to
[50:35] have a buddy. Amen. It's good to have a
[50:38] buddy. I'd like to thank you again for
[50:40] every prayer that you pray. We thank you
[50:43] for all of that. And so doctors say that
[50:47] I'm
[50:47] the most well-looking sick man they've
[50:50] ever seen. And so so I take that as a
[50:54] compliment. And so glad to have Sister
[50:56] Connie with me today. And Amen. We so
[50:59] love her with all of our hearts. And
[51:00] she's a trooper. She's an absolute
[51:03] trooper. Maybe we just talk to him now.
[51:07] Here's what I would like for you to do.
[51:10] I would like for you personally to
[51:13] invite him to where you're
[51:15] at. He'll come if you invite him.
[51:19] Brother Brandham said he comes where
[51:21] he's invited.
[51:24] So won't you invite him now?
[51:26] Heavenly Father, we love you with all of
[51:29] our
[51:31] hearts. We just don't have words in our
[51:34] English language to be able to say how
[51:36] much we love you.
[51:39] Now we have stepped to this place of
[51:41] duty. Now you have laid things on our
[51:44] hearts and I ask you today that you
[51:47] would speak to us in a special way. I
[51:50] too have
[51:50] [Music]
[51:52] needs and you are such a wonderful God
[51:55] that cares and hears every one of our
[51:59] prayer from the greatest to the least.
[52:03] Lord, we love you.
[52:06] And we come to this evening on a
[52:08] Saturday
[52:09] evening. Sure, there's millions of
[52:11] things to do,
[52:13] but we come to serve you. And we ask
[52:17] you, we invite you to where we're at,
[52:21] Lord. We have needs.
[52:24] There was a woman that that came into
[52:26] your
[52:27] meeting and she wasn't satisfied with
[52:30] being on the back row. She pressed her
[52:33] way
[52:36] and she said, "If I can only touch the
[52:38] hem of his garment, I know I'll be
[52:43] whole." Now, she came to that meeting
[52:45] one way, but she would leave a complete
[52:48] different way. I trust that's the way
[52:51] that we've came this afternoon.
[52:54] We've came one
[52:56] way, but if we touch the hem of your
[52:58] garment tonight, we know we'll be well.
[53:02] Touch us now. Thank you for this
[53:05] opportunity. We don't take it for
[53:08] granted. Bless this people. We pray in
[53:11] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen.
[53:15] Amen. God bless you. God bless you. If
[53:17] you will turn with me to Genesis chapter
[53:19] 22 and verse 10.
[53:31] Thank you. It's our secret.
[53:36] Yeah. Very familiar portion of
[53:38] scripture, but all of them
[53:42] are. And Abraham stretched forth his
[53:45] hand and took the knife to slay his son.
[53:50] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[53:54] him out of the heaven and
[53:57] said,"Abraham,
[53:59] Abraham." And he said, "Here am
[54:02] I." And he said, "Lay not thine hand
[54:05] upon the
[54:07] lad, neither do thou anything unto him.
[54:11] For now I know that thouast fearest God.
[54:16] and seeest, thou hast not withheld thy
[54:20] son, thine only son, from me." And
[54:24] Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked,
[54:26] and
[54:27] behold, behind him a ram caught in the
[54:30] thicket by his horns. And Abraham went
[54:34] and took the ram and offered it him up
[54:37] for a burnt offering in thestead of his
[54:40] son. And Abraham called the place of
[54:43] that place Jehovah Gyra. As it is said
[54:48] to this day, in the mount of the Lord,
[54:51] it shall be seen. And the angel of the
[54:55] Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven
[54:58] the second time, and here's where we
[55:01] want to emphasize, "And said,"By myself
[55:04] have I sworn, saith the Lord.
[55:08] For because thou hast done this thing,
[55:11] and hast not withheld thy son, thine
[55:14] only son, that in the blessing I will
[55:18] bless thee, and in the multiplying I
[55:21] will multiply thy seed as the stars of
[55:25] the heaven, and as the sand, which is
[55:28] upon the
[55:29] seashore. Thy seed shall possess the
[55:32] gate of his enemy. Yeah. and in thy seed
[55:35] shall all the nations of the earth be
[55:38] blessed because thou hast obeyed my
[55:43] voice. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[55:45] seated this
[55:52] evening. I'd like to speak to you and
[55:54] there's no way that I can cover this,
[55:56] but maybe I'll just get a little sliver
[55:59] of it tonight and and you might enjoy it
[56:02] just a bit. I'd like to talk to you
[56:04] about how big our God is.
[56:09] Amen.
[56:12] How big our God is. Now, it's something
[56:16] that we forget at times. Yeah. Right.
[56:21] We forget it when we get into a trial or
[56:24] we forget it when we get into a problem.
[56:26] Yeah. But I'd like to just pause for a
[56:28] little bit after that masterpiece last
[56:30] night and I'd like to talk to you about
[56:33] how big he is.
[56:38] There's just no God like our God.
[56:41] He's a God that fills all time, space,
[56:46] and eternity. And I don't even think
[56:48] that we can define that.
[56:52] Uh we just can't define how great big he
[56:54] is. Right.
[56:57] and and he is the most powerful that
[57:00] there can be. Brother Brandham would say
[57:03] these words and I thought it was a nice
[57:05] way to start the service. While we have
[57:08] our heads
[57:10] bowed, I want I want
[57:14] person who you're sitting next to. I
[57:17] want you to lay your hands over on that
[57:19] person next to you. Just lay your hands
[57:22] on them inside or out. No matter where
[57:25] you are, lay your hands on the one
[57:28] another. I don't care what you have a
[57:32] need
[57:32] of. That doesn't matter a
[57:36] bit. I don't care where the person is.
[57:39] Might be across the seas, across the
[57:43] oceans. No matter where it is, God
[57:46] covers all space, time, fills, all time.
[57:51] He's omnipotent. He's on the present.
[57:55] He's infinite. He's here now.
[58:00] He hears our prayers. The Bible said
[58:03] that these signs shall follow them that
[58:06] believe. And each one of you are a
[58:09] believer. If you'll lay hands on the
[58:11] sick,
[58:13] they shall recover.
[58:16] Now, I want you to just think about how
[58:18] powerful prayer is.
[58:20] Brother Bradom said it's one of the most
[58:22] powerful weapons in the world. He said
[58:26] prayer, he says, has more power than an
[58:29] atomic bomb.
[58:34] That's quite a statement. Yes, sir.
[58:37] said, "When the weakest of Christians
[58:40] goes on their knees,
[58:44] not a bishop,
[58:46] not some great presbyter, not your
[58:49] favorite pastor, but when the weakest,
[58:55] so Satan's doing himself much detriment,
[58:58] telling you how weak you are, cuz it
[59:01] actually pulls you into a
[59:03] quote." When the weakest of Christians
[59:06] go on their knees, the kingdom of hell
[59:09] shakes.
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:13] How f how powerful prayer is.
[59:18] Moses
[59:20] prayed and a Red Sea opened up. Yeah.
[59:24] Not only opened up to bring deliverance
[59:26] to the children of Israel, but it
[59:29] destroyed the greatest army in the
[59:32] earth. Yeah,
[59:35] Daniel prayed and lions laid down.
[59:40] And he had a wonderful night.
[59:44] But the same lions, same lions ate up
[59:48] his adversary.
[59:56] Elijah prayed. Yeah.
[59:59] And then he outrun all the horses. Yeah.
[1:00:03] 40 miles. Yeah.
[1:00:08] Some of you might want to pray
[1:00:13] tonight. Here
[1:00:16] recently in our
[1:00:18] Pentagon, our new administration has put
[1:00:20] in a new a new accord there that the
[1:00:25] Pentagon, the believers or Christians
[1:00:28] will gather
[1:00:31] And they'll take 30 minutes. Yeah. On
[1:00:34] time. On government time. Not your lunch
[1:00:37] time, but on government time. I'm
[1:00:39] thankful we've turned that way.
[1:00:42] And And they gather and they have a
[1:00:45] worship service for 30 minutes. I
[1:00:48] thought it was interesting. I I thought,
[1:00:50] well, maybe I'll I'd like to listen to
[1:00:52] the first speaker.
[1:00:56] So
[1:00:58] Headsup invited his pastor, a local guy
[1:01:01] from
[1:01:02] Kentucky, has a little bitty
[1:01:05] church. And I thought, "This ought to be
[1:01:08] interesting." And he walks through the
[1:01:10] pull pit and he gives delivers 11 minute
[1:01:13] sermon. I've already took 11
[1:01:18] minutes. And he delivers 11 minute
[1:01:20] sermon. one of his opening statements, I
[1:01:24] think it's good for us as
[1:01:26] well. And he
[1:01:28] said, "You're the most powerful people
[1:01:31] on the earth.
[1:01:33] You're in charge of the most powerful
[1:01:35] weapons known to man." Yeah.
[1:01:39] And he made a statement. He said, "But
[1:01:40] you're not God.
[1:01:44] You're not God. So don't make God
[1:01:46] decisions.
[1:01:49] Don't blow up nations. Yeah. Just over a
[1:01:52] whale or a disagreement. Yeah. Be
[1:01:55] responsible with the power that you
[1:01:58] have.
[1:02:00] What are you going to do with that,
[1:02:01] Brother Ron? Well, I want I want to just
[1:02:03] Can I use some of those words?
[1:02:06] You're the most powerful people on the
[1:02:08] earth.
[1:02:10] Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:02:12] And you are God's. Amen. Yes, sir. Come
[1:02:16] on. But be responsible. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:02:20] Be responsible. You got the greatest
[1:02:22] weapons that there is.
[1:02:24] Don't waste your 24 hours in a day.
[1:02:29] And
[1:02:31] remember, none of us are brother
[1:02:33] Brandham.
[1:02:34] None of us would pretend to be brother
[1:02:36] Brandham. But we have the power of God
[1:02:39] at our disposal
[1:02:42] to pray for the sick and and the sick be
[1:02:45] healed.
[1:02:47] None of us can heal one another. We know
[1:02:49] that. But we can sure pray for one
[1:02:52] another.
[1:02:54] I need your prayers. And and I I I trust
[1:02:58] that I can pray a prayer for you that
[1:03:00] will help you.
[1:03:04] I want you to think about what God is
[1:03:07] doing with
[1:03:10] Abraham. And he begins to tell him of
[1:03:13] how big it
[1:03:14] is. And he reminds him that Abraham, I'm
[1:03:19] going to bless your seed.
[1:03:23] Can you count the sand of the sea?
[1:03:29] Now, let me just remind you, you go out
[1:03:31] to the wet sand that's on the shore and
[1:03:34] you pick it up. It's impossible
[1:03:38] to count just the grains that you can
[1:03:42] have in your hand. But God said, "The
[1:03:45] sand of all the seashore."
[1:03:50] And he asked him a question. Can you
[1:03:53] count the stars? Come on.
[1:03:57] I wrote the first Bible. Can you count
[1:04:00] the stars? He's reminding him. I'm a big
[1:04:05] God.
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:10] That's right. Let's just listen to a
[1:04:12] couple of quotes. Brother Brown said
[1:04:14] there was never one like it
[1:04:17] on the earth. Never will be. He was
[1:04:22] Emmanuel. He was alpha, omega, the
[1:04:26] beginning and the end. He that was,
[1:04:29] which is, which shall come, the root and
[1:04:32] the offspring of David, the morning
[1:04:35] star. In him dwelleth deity. In him was
[1:04:40] God. Amen.
[1:04:44] Brother Ron, that's simple. Well, what
[1:04:46] happened to all those trinitarians?
[1:04:49] They didn't catch it. That's right. He
[1:04:52] says in God's provided place of worship.
[1:04:54] He said God Jehovah, Savior, Emmanuel,
[1:04:58] the door of the sheepfold, he that was,
[1:05:01] which is, and shall come, the root and
[1:05:04] the offspring, the root of the offspring
[1:05:07] of David, the morning star, the lily of
[1:05:10] the valley. Oh God, how wonderful.
[1:05:14] No wonder Isaiah said, "Counselor,
[1:05:16] prince of peace, the mighty God, the
[1:05:20] everlasting father." Yes, sir.
[1:05:24] In adoption, he said, "For he said, I am
[1:05:28] he that was, which is, and shall come. I
[1:05:33] am the root and the offspring of David,
[1:05:35] the morning star. I am Alpha and Omega.
[1:05:39] That's A and Z in the and the Greek
[1:05:42] alphabet. I am from A to Z.
[1:05:48] I am I am all in all. That's right. I'm
[1:05:53] he that was alive and was
[1:05:56] dead and is alive forever more. I have
[1:06:00] the keys of death and
[1:06:03] hell. Oh my. Every nugget that you pick
[1:06:06] up here and start polishing, it'll
[1:06:10] polish right into Jesus.
[1:06:14] Seven church ages, he said. But it's
[1:06:16] plainly says here in Revelation that
[1:06:19] Jesus is that which is, that which was,
[1:06:24] that which is to come, and he is alpha
[1:06:27] and omega.
[1:06:29] the Almighty. He is the rose of Sharon,
[1:06:32] the lily of the valley, the bright and
[1:06:35] morning star, the righteous branch, the
[1:06:38] father, son, and the holy ghost. He is
[1:06:41] God.
[1:06:44] He's the almighty God.
[1:06:48] One God.
[1:06:54] Revelation 21 and verse one.
[1:06:58] And I saw a new heaven. Yes. Yeah. And a
[1:07:01] new earth
[1:07:04] for the first earth were passed away.
[1:07:07] And there was no more
[1:07:09] sea. And I, John, saw the holy city
[1:07:12] which the new Jerusalem coming down from
[1:07:15] God out of heaven prepared as a bride
[1:07:18] adorned for her husband. And I heard a
[1:07:21] great voice out of heaven saying,
[1:07:22] "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
[1:07:25] men, and he will dwell with them, and
[1:07:27] they shall be his people."
[1:07:30] I don't want to lead you out of the mix.
[1:07:34] Your amen should have been better. Yes.
[1:07:38] Amen. Amen. And I hear heard a great
[1:07:41] voice out of heaven saying, "Behold, the
[1:07:43] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[1:07:45] will dwell with them, and they shall be
[1:07:48] his people, and God himself shall be
[1:07:50] with them, and be their God."
[1:07:54] Amen. And God shall wipe away all tears
[1:07:57] from their eyes, and there shall be no
[1:07:59] more death. Boy, I feel like shouting
[1:08:01] right here. There shall be no more
[1:08:03] death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
[1:08:08] neither there shall be any more pain.
[1:08:11] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Never a
[1:08:14] hospital be built there.
[1:08:18] We won't build armies to fight a war.
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:25] Never be another sorrow.
[1:08:28] Hallelujah. Let it never be another
[1:08:31] cross word.
[1:08:35] Never be another habit that you have to
[1:08:36] fight.
[1:08:40] Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir.
[1:08:46] And the former things are passed away.
[1:08:49] And he that sat up on the throne said,
[1:08:52] "Behold, I make all things new."
[1:08:58] Hallelujah. And he said unto me, "Write,
[1:09:00] for these words are true
[1:09:03] and faithful."
[1:09:05] And he said unto me, "It is done. I am
[1:09:08] alpha and omega, the beginning and the
[1:09:10] end. And I will give unto him that is a
[1:09:12] thirst of the fountain of the water of
[1:09:15] life freely. And he that overcomemeth
[1:09:19] shall inherit all things, and I will be
[1:09:22] his God, and
[1:09:25] he shall be my people, my son.
[1:09:31] I want to just bring you
[1:09:34] in in Job chapter
[1:09:37] 38. There's a lot of us sitting here
[1:09:40] that's had some bad days. Yes, sir.
[1:09:44] Sure. There's a lot of us here that's
[1:09:47] had some bad days. This thing working,
[1:09:49] sir. There's a lot of us here that's had
[1:09:52] some bad days, right? But none of us
[1:09:57] come on. None of us have had a day
[1:10:00] like Job had.
[1:10:04] Job did not get a letter from heaven
[1:10:06] saying, "I have bragged about you to the
[1:10:09] devil. That's right. My arch enemy.
[1:10:14] I've had a testimony service about you
[1:10:17] that I have confidence in you.
[1:10:21] See, God doesn't have confidence in your
[1:10:24] flesh. He has confidence in the seed
[1:10:27] that he placed on the inside of you.
[1:10:31] That's where his confidence. And brother
[1:10:33] Brandon will say, he says, "God has
[1:10:35] confidence in Abraham because he
[1:10:38] fellowship with him." That's right. Then
[1:10:40] he's had confidence in you because he's
[1:10:42] fellowshipped with you. Maybe a warm
[1:10:45] presence that comes in your home and you
[1:10:47] just feel him walk by. Maybe it's in a
[1:10:50] service. All of a sudden something
[1:10:52] becomes supernatural and you know it's
[1:10:54] not just another service.
[1:10:58] He's took time to be with you.
[1:11:01] The God that's that fills all time space
[1:11:04] and eternity takes time.
[1:11:08] Amen. Yes, Lord.
[1:11:13] I want you to notice a couple things
[1:11:15] about this reading. He said, "Then the
[1:11:17] Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind,
[1:11:19] and
[1:11:21] said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel
[1:11:24] by the words without knowledge?
[1:11:27] Good up thy loins like a man, for I will
[1:11:31] demand of thee, and answer thou me." He
[1:11:34] asked him a question. Yeah.
[1:11:37] Where was thou when I laid the
[1:11:39] foundations of the earth? Declare if
[1:11:42] thou has understanding.
[1:11:45] Who hath laid the measures thereof, if
[1:11:48] thou knowest, or who has stretched the
[1:11:51] line upon
[1:11:53] it? Whereupon are the foundations there
[1:11:56] are fastened? Or who laid the corner
[1:12:00] thereof? Yeah. when the morning stars
[1:12:03] sang together and all the sons of God
[1:12:06] shouted for joy. Yeah. I want you to
[1:12:09] catch a couple things here. And I know
[1:12:11] you're you're so well taught almost
[1:12:13] feels intimidating to speak to you, but
[1:12:16] but let me just let me just say this to
[1:12:18] you. God doesn't come down and have a
[1:12:20] pity party.
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:23] God doesn't come down and brush his hair
[1:12:26] and tell him you've been a good boy
[1:12:29] through your trials and you know he
[1:12:32] doesn't come down and talk about
[1:12:33] anything that's going on.
[1:12:35] That's right.
[1:12:38] He reminds him how big he is.
[1:12:44] He reminds him of how big a God that I
[1:12:47] am.
[1:12:49] Where was you? Yeah.
[1:12:52] So he begins to remind him, you were in
[1:12:55] my mind.
[1:12:57] You are an attribute, a thought that is
[1:12:59] expressed on the earth. Where was you
[1:13:01] at, Job? Remember where you was at
[1:13:06] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[1:13:10] when I did all this and created all
[1:13:12] this? Where was you at? I want to tell
[1:13:15] you, Job, I had you in my mind.
[1:13:19] Yes.
[1:13:21] You get it? Yes, sir. No matter what
[1:13:24] trial that you're in today,
[1:13:27] if God is having a conversation with you
[1:13:29] in this service, he's reminding you. I'm
[1:13:33] not coming to give you a pity party.
[1:13:37] I'm not coming down to that level. I
[1:13:40] want to raise you up to where I'm at.
[1:13:44] It's good up here. I want to raise you
[1:13:46] up. I want to encourage your faith.
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:52] Yes. Praise God.
[1:13:56] Hebrews 13:8 is the theme of this
[1:13:58] message.
[1:14:00] I want to remind you of it. Jesus Christ
[1:14:04] the same yesterday
[1:14:07] and today
[1:14:09] and forever.
[1:14:11] He's a God that has never changed.
[1:14:14] He's never lied.
[1:14:16] He's never been in a crisis.
[1:14:21] He's just as powerful today as he ever
[1:14:24] was.
[1:14:26] That's right. When he says, "I am the
[1:14:29] first and I am the last." Then he says,
[1:14:32] "And beside me there is no God." Amen.
[1:14:39] Brother Bram says, "You don't
[1:14:40] underestimate Jesus Christ."
[1:14:43] Cuz he's the power over all powers.
[1:14:46] Amen.
[1:14:48] Don't be afraid of Satan.
[1:14:51] As long as you're in him,
[1:14:55] but if you're not in him, that's right,
[1:14:58] you better tremble.
[1:15:01] If you're not in Jesus today, you need
[1:15:03] to change teams.
[1:15:06] [Applause]
[1:15:08] cuz our God is undefeable.
[1:15:11] [Applause]
[1:15:15] Those are not just pretty words that
[1:15:17] Brother Brandham says in uh an
[1:15:19] invincible army. Amen. That's not just
[1:15:22] good words. They're truth.
[1:15:25] If you're on God's side, you're
[1:15:27] invincible.
[1:15:32] Glory to God. If you're in him, not even
[1:15:34] death itself can harm you.
[1:15:38] You're free from all fear.
[1:15:42] So, let's just remind ourselves, he
[1:15:44] controls everything.
[1:15:48] He controls nature. He controls the
[1:15:51] waves of the sea.
[1:15:54] And the sea going in or coming out can
[1:15:57] be measured by inches.
[1:16:06] He conquered all sin.
[1:16:11] There's no sin that God can't conquer.
[1:16:16] There's no sickness
[1:16:20] that God can't heal.
[1:16:22] [Applause]
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:23] That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:16:27] And remember, he's the God of past,
[1:16:30] present, and future.
[1:16:37] You may have been raised in difficult
[1:16:39] circumstances, but this God is the God
[1:16:42] of love.
[1:16:44] He don't force you to love him. That's
[1:16:46] right.
[1:16:48] He don't beat you around.
[1:16:51] I'm sorry if you've been under
[1:16:52] ministries that have beat you and beat
[1:16:54] you. Listen, we're on a love gospel.
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:59] Are you with me? God don't force you.
[1:17:02] That's right. But you got a dress code.
[1:17:05] But God has pro he has give you that to
[1:17:09] protect you.
[1:17:14] But that's so difficult. It's because
[1:17:16] it's difficult, you're on the wrong
[1:17:17] team.
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:20] But once you get Jesus in your life,
[1:17:23] come on.
[1:17:25] Well, brother Ron, I I just I there's
[1:17:28] just so much for me to have to give up.
[1:17:31] Really? Really?
[1:17:33] Friends that are leading you to hell, I
[1:17:35] I'll give them up.
[1:17:37] Habits that are destroying your body,
[1:17:40] I'll give them up. Alcohol and drugs
[1:17:43] that are taking your brain cell, I'll
[1:17:45] give them up.
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:51] Well, I I you know I you know I hate to
[1:17:54] miss all the parties. Welcome to
[1:17:56] Saturday
[1:18:06] night. Hallelujah.
[1:18:14] Now, those that were in bottles, you
[1:18:16] understand what I'm saying right there?
[1:18:20] You know, you would you would get drunk
[1:18:22] on Saturday night. Well, this is about
[1:18:25] the same. You'll get drunk here tonight.
[1:18:29] Amen. And you know, the best way to help
[1:18:31] a drunk on Sunday morning is just come
[1:18:35] to hear the preacher tomorrow morning
[1:18:37] and get another drink and you'll be
[1:18:40] drunk the rest of the
[1:18:42] week, sir. And there's no hangover.
[1:18:50] There's just no hangover.
[1:18:52] [Applause]
[1:18:55] Preach, brother.
[1:18:59] I want to remind you there's nothing too
[1:19:01] hard for God.
[1:19:04] That's right. Where we limit him is we
[1:19:07] in our human thinking.
[1:19:12] In our human thinking. We begin to put
[1:19:15] limits on God.
[1:19:21] But let me just say this to you. If God
[1:19:23] is your partner, right, you better have
[1:19:28] big plans.
[1:19:32] Tell your neighbor that one. Yeah.
[1:19:35] That's a good one.
[1:19:42] I told Brother Wayne this. I saw the
[1:19:44] size of the building that you're
[1:19:46] building and I just looked at him and
[1:19:48] said, "It's not big enough.
[1:19:51] Yeah.
[1:19:52] Amen. Right. That's right.
[1:19:58] Well, brother Ron, that's positive
[1:19:59] thinking. Well, when David walked off of
[1:20:01] the hill,
[1:20:03] he wasn't thinking about how big a
[1:20:04] tombstone they're going to build for him
[1:20:06] or what kind of memorial they're going
[1:20:08] to get for him, he just didn't pick up
[1:20:11] one stone. He picked up five.
[1:20:14] Cuz after you defeat the first demon,
[1:20:16] you know you're going to do it. He's got
[1:20:18] brothers.
[1:20:21] You're going to go from victory to
[1:20:23] victory to victory to victory. You're
[1:20:26] going to live in victory because you got
[1:20:29] a big job.
[1:20:40] Brother Ron, you must have read a
[1:20:42] positive book before you came here.
[1:20:44] Well, I did. Let me just give you a
[1:20:46] couple of quotes. And we know that all
[1:20:49] all things that work together for the
[1:20:51] good to them that love God, to them who
[1:20:55] are the called according to his purpose.
[1:20:58] For whom he did forno, he also did
[1:21:01] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:21:03] image of his son, that he might be the
[1:21:05] firstborn among many brethren. And
[1:21:07] moreover, whom he did predestinate, then
[1:21:09] he also called.
[1:21:13] You know, great big God don't just call
[1:21:15] you and then throw you away.
[1:21:19] If you ever thought of you, you are as
[1:21:21] eternal as he is eternal.
[1:21:30] And whom he called them, he also
[1:21:32] justified. And so if the devil is
[1:21:35] beating you over your back with
[1:21:36] condemnation to what you used to be in,
[1:21:39] I want you to remind you. I want to
[1:21:41] remind you when you give those sins to
[1:21:43] God and you ask him to forgive you and
[1:21:45] he changes your life, you're as
[1:21:47] justified as though you never did it in
[1:21:49] the first place.
[1:21:57] You may see yourself with a lot of
[1:21:59] scars, but God looks at you as sinless.
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:07] Boo
[1:22:07] devil. We're not Catholics
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:14] paying our way out of purgatory. We are
[1:22:17] sons and daughters of God.
[1:22:24] And whom he justified them, he also
[1:22:27] glorified. Now it makes a great big
[1:22:29] statement here. Romans 8:31.
[1:22:31] And what shall we then say to these
[1:22:34] things? Right. Right.
[1:22:36] The things that are previously said,
[1:22:39] what shall we then say to these things?
[1:22:41] This is great big. I want you to read it
[1:22:43] with me. If God be for us, who can be
[1:22:47] against us?
[1:22:49] [Applause]
[1:23:03] Amen. I want to ask you a question. How
[1:23:06] big is your God? Yeah.
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:10] All right. That's just such a simple
[1:23:12] simple text, brother Ron. Okay. How big
[1:23:17] is your God?
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:20] I want to ask you, how big is your God?
[1:23:25] Come on. He is as big as you'll let him
[1:23:28] be.
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:33] Amen.
[1:23:34] Come on, brother. That's good.
[1:23:37] Amen.
[1:23:39] Jesus was having a sermon with his
[1:23:42] disciples. And he said, "Let not your
[1:23:45] heart be troubled.
[1:23:47] You believe in God, believe also in me."
[1:23:50] "In my father's house are many mansions,
[1:23:53] and if it were not so, I would have told
[1:23:56] you.
[1:23:58] I go to prepare a place for you. Amen.
[1:24:04] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:24:07] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:24:10] myself, that where I am, there you may
[1:24:14] be also.
[1:24:18] Brother Brandon preaches a sermon called
[1:24:19] Future Home.
[1:24:22] Oh, yeah. It's pretty mindblowing that
[1:24:24] Yeah.
[1:24:25] that a Kentucky preacher
[1:24:28] is going to stand there and tell us
[1:24:31] something that no theologian of the
[1:24:33] world is able to describe
[1:24:36] right walls 216t high
[1:24:41] jasper
[1:24:43] gates of pearl
[1:24:47] more than a pretty song now and it
[1:24:50] begins to describe it's like a pyramid
[1:24:53] and at the top our Lord is there and he
[1:24:56] is a light that shines
[1:25:00] down over the whole city. We'll dwell
[1:25:02] there.
[1:25:05] Oh, brother Ron, but there's a whole lot
[1:25:06] of us isn't going to be tight. You
[1:25:08] haven't discovered how big the city is.
[1:25:11] And the river of life runs through every
[1:25:14] piece of property.
[1:25:17] We cannot fathom,
[1:25:20] excuse me, in our human imagination.
[1:25:24] We can't fathom
[1:25:29] how awesome a place that it is.
[1:25:33] But more than roads of golden asphalt,
[1:25:38] right?
[1:25:41] That really wasn't what he was talking
[1:25:42] about. He was talking about, brother
[1:25:45] said, he's not talking about brick and
[1:25:47] mortar. He's went to build you a house.
[1:25:51] Amen.
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:54] That'll never deteriorate.
[1:25:58] No false teeth, no guy glasses. There's
[1:26:01] not going to be a grayheaded person
[1:26:04] there.
[1:26:08] Run like a deer.
[1:26:12] Yes, sir.
[1:26:14] I don't know what percentage in this
[1:26:16] building is gayheaded, but you ought to
[1:26:17] be shouting right now. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:26:21] Absolutely.
[1:26:27] Now Jesus meets with men in different
[1:26:30] circles
[1:26:32] and in different
[1:26:34] numbers. One time he met with
[1:26:38] 500 and another time he met with
[1:26:41] 70. Once with 12 and once with
[1:26:46] three. And he will
[1:26:48] meet even come to one hungry soul.
[1:26:55] Amen. No matter what the size of the
[1:26:58] circle is or how many people are
[1:27:00] gathered together, Christ is omnipotent,
[1:27:04] omnipresent.
[1:27:06] And he's the only being that there is
[1:27:08] that's omnipresent.
[1:27:10] The devil can't be omnipresent.
[1:27:13] God is the only one who's omnipresent.
[1:27:17] Yeah, that's everywhere.
[1:27:20] He fills all heavens, the
[1:27:24] earth. Brother continues, "And here's
[1:27:27] some time ago on Mount up up in
[1:27:30] California. I was
[1:27:32] looking at this great
[1:27:35] observatory where one of the astronomers
[1:27:37] had been converted in my meeting. They
[1:27:41] took me up there and they got a glass
[1:27:44] that that you can
[1:27:45] see 120 million years of light
[1:27:51] space. Light travels I think about 8,000
[1:27:55] miles per second. Break that down into
[1:27:59] miles and how many miles that you would
[1:28:01] have to go
[1:28:02] inund 12 million light years. How many
[1:28:05] miles would you have in a minute or how
[1:28:09] many in an hour or in a day or in a year
[1:28:13] in a hundred years? Brother Brandon was
[1:28:14] trying to assimilate this thought as a
[1:28:17] man. Yeah. How big this universe is,
[1:28:22] right? Right. And all beyond that is
[1:28:25] filled with the solar system.
[1:28:29] Our great Jehovah God. Now he just comes
[1:28:33] to it. Yeah, our great Jehovah God just
[1:28:37] blew them off of his fingers
[1:28:40] in creation and it covers all the space.
[1:28:45] And sometimes we walk around and act
[1:28:47] like we can run his business.
[1:28:57] Punch your neighbor and say, "Hey,
[1:28:58] listen to this."
[1:29:02] And Jehovah, God just blew them off of
[1:29:05] his fingers in creation.
[1:29:07] He covers all space. And sometimes we
[1:29:10] walk around and act like that we can run
[1:29:14] his business.
[1:29:18] He's so big, he fills all the space and
[1:29:21] yet will become so small
[1:29:25] that he will come to a poor lost
[1:29:26] sinner's heart.
[1:29:29] That's what makes him great.
[1:29:33] I've had the privilege in my life to see
[1:29:35] great men, kings. I've been in four
[1:29:38] palaces praying for kings and monarchs
[1:29:40] and potentates.
[1:29:43] Where's that believe the sign at now?
[1:29:46] Yeah. Really? He says, "I've been in
[1:29:48] four, not just one. I've been in four."
[1:29:50] Right.
[1:29:52] And you find great men and they're
[1:29:55] they're little in their own sight. It's
[1:29:57] men that's nothing. That's right. little
[1:29:59] man that that thinks himself big that
[1:30:03] tries to make himself big. Yeah.
[1:30:07] That's what makes God so big.
[1:30:10] He humbles himself to come down to save
[1:30:13] and to heal.
[1:30:16] He's here.
[1:30:19] It makes him God to me.
[1:30:26] Amen.
[1:30:30] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:32] We had a family that come to our church
[1:30:34] and their grandmother prayed that her
[1:30:39] her children and grandchildren would
[1:30:42] become
[1:30:43] believers. Every service she turned in a
[1:30:46] prayer request, praying for my children,
[1:30:49] praying for my grandchildren.
[1:30:52] She died, went off of the scene. She was
[1:30:54] a real saint.
[1:30:56] She's off the scene for probably
[1:30:58] decades. You know what started
[1:31:00] happening?
[1:31:03] I don't have to tell you.
[1:31:06] Well, here they come. And they're just
[1:31:08] pillars in the church. I mean, just
[1:31:10] literally pillars.
[1:31:13] I went into a restaurant one time and
[1:31:15] they're set one of them there in the
[1:31:17] table was just filled with B beer
[1:31:20] bottles. I didn't walk over and start
[1:31:22] preaching to him. I walked over and told
[1:31:24] him how much I loved him. Come on. I
[1:31:26] said that in sincerity.
[1:31:28] If I tell you I love you, I mean that. I
[1:31:31] don't tell the devil I love him.
[1:31:38] And so this young man and his
[1:31:40] wife, they had a rebellious boy and he
[1:31:43] was wicked. Just plain stinking
[1:31:46] wicked.
[1:31:49] Wicked. You looked up the word wicked.
[1:31:52] His picture was
[1:31:55] there. I'd say he's probably 5 foot
[1:31:57] eight, weigh probably 160 pounds, but he
[1:32:01] thought he was Goliath.
[1:32:04] There was a demon in him big as a
[1:32:10] bullfrog. They would bring him to my
[1:32:12] office and he would be filled up with
[1:32:14] heroin, cocaine,
[1:32:15] and and and I pray for him and he would
[1:32:18] get sober in a second. Listen, there's
[1:32:22] none Alcoholics Anonymous can do that in
[1:32:25] a second. He would be sober.
[1:32:28] Time would go on and he wouldn't come to
[1:32:30] church. And one day he decided, I need
[1:32:33] to go to church. So, I had a girlfriend
[1:32:35] that matched
[1:32:41] wicked. You know, you you date what your
[1:32:45] character is.
[1:32:47] God's got a sense of humor. She's tied
[1:32:49] it all up. She's a mess. I mean, a mess.
[1:32:53] Comes from a family that's a mess.
[1:32:56] If they watch this service, they know
[1:32:57] I'm telling the truth. That's right,
[1:32:58] Brother Ryan.
[1:33:02] Father's Day, they show up that Sunday
[1:33:06] morning. They sit in the
[1:33:09] back. Dad doesn't even know they're
[1:33:11] there or even coming.
[1:33:14] They walk in and sit down in the back. I
[1:33:16] recognize that they're there. I I I call
[1:33:19] their names and and they're sitting
[1:33:22] there and they wave at me. I didn't get
[1:33:23] to shake their hands
[1:33:25] and you
[1:33:27] know, couple days later. They arrest
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:32] boy. They put him in jail. They don't
[1:33:35] let him out. He goes through the court
[1:33:36] system. He's tried. He gets a couple of
[1:33:39] years, maybe four, I don't know exact
[1:33:42] time. I think it's four years. You know
[1:33:45] that girl that came with him on on that
[1:33:47] Father's Day never missed a service in
[1:33:51] that four years.
[1:33:54] Now he went away to jail
[1:33:57] and she came to God
[1:34:02] so he's not going to come out of jail
[1:34:04] and meet a girl that's a party city
[1:34:08] wild as bucks. He's going to meet a
[1:34:10] daughter of God.
[1:34:12] Now she's tatted up. They didn't leave.
[1:34:15] But listen, if you looked at her before
[1:34:16] and looked at her now, total different
[1:34:18] citizen.
[1:34:23] I want you to think about it. Never
[1:34:25] missed a service. Never had went to
[1:34:26] church. Never missed a service after
[1:34:28] that Father's Day Sunday.
[1:34:31] Boyfriend goes to jail. Who knows when
[1:34:34] he'll get out. Somewhere in his jail
[1:34:37] time, she begins to witness to him of
[1:34:39] what's going on in my life. And God
[1:34:42] meets him in a cell.
[1:34:56] Don't worry about the ts.
[1:34:59] You heard it last night. With those
[1:35:00] tats, you raise them up before God. And
[1:35:03] you're reminding the devil, I'm not your
[1:35:05] slave no more.
[1:35:08] You may have scarred me. You may have
[1:35:10] beat me. You may have warned me, but I
[1:35:12] made a great job.
[1:35:20] It wasn't because somebody made a
[1:35:22] decision for Christ cuz you wasn't
[1:35:24] looking for Christ. God came looking for
[1:35:27] you. That great big God that we're
[1:35:31] talking about came looking for you.
[1:35:40] Don't worry about your shame. Come on.
[1:35:43] He's not ashamed to you. That's right.
[1:35:46] He knows where to find you. If you're in
[1:35:48] the tombs, he knows where to find you.
[1:35:51] If you're in a well and you're shattered
[1:35:53] by light, he knows where to find you.
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:05] Long story
[1:36:07] short, grandma's prayers
[1:36:10] was to a great big God.
[1:36:18] Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] I don't want to bore you, but I can't
[1:36:33] help but put this one in.
[1:36:37] Maybe some of you were denominational or
[1:36:39] TV preachers or
[1:36:42] whatever. It's almost fun to hear some
[1:36:45] of those guys try to describe the big
[1:36:47] bang theory.
[1:36:51] Well, let's listen to brother Brandham
[1:36:53] explain the big bang theory. All right.
[1:36:58] Is this okay? Yes, sir.
[1:37:02] He said, "Then let's notice out yonder.
[1:37:06] I see now it's all out in space. that
[1:37:09] all is
[1:37:10] God without form and forever for
[1:37:14] eternities. No beginning, no ending.
[1:37:16] It's all God. Before there was even air,
[1:37:19] there was God.
[1:37:21] The very beginning of nature or creation
[1:37:24] was God.
[1:37:26] Now, the Bible teaches us that the logos
[1:37:28] went out of God. Or I might say that
[1:37:31] then God becoming the first body form.
[1:37:35] When this logos went out of God, let's
[1:37:38] look at what it looked like. No one had
[1:37:41] has seen the father at any time.
[1:37:44] Nowhere, never did, never will. But when
[1:37:49] the logust that went out of him become
[1:37:51] like a little halo of light.
[1:37:54] Amen. Brother Brown just puts it in a
[1:37:56] way that we might in our human thinking
[1:38:00] understands it. That's right. Let's see
[1:38:03] it play in yonder like a child before
[1:38:06] the doorstep of the father. And now I
[1:38:09] can see as he moves up yonder over
[1:38:11] yonder and he draws into his memory or
[1:38:14] his mind a picture of what the world
[1:38:17] should be. There's not even a star or
[1:38:20] nothing. And I hear him say, "Let there
[1:38:24] be." And an atom broke
[1:38:27] yonder. And when it did, the sun came
[1:38:30] into
[1:38:31] existence and begin to whirl. She burned
[1:38:35] a million years and a million and a
[1:38:37] million year of years. And after a
[1:38:39] while, I see a flicker, a clinker fly
[1:38:42] off of
[1:38:44] it. What is it? The first star that flew
[1:38:47] from the sun. He watches it fall for a
[1:38:51] few million years. How old are
[1:38:56] you now? You put that little whatever
[1:38:59] 110 years old. Glad to have you here.
[1:39:02] The government just proved you're
[1:39:04] getting social security. Yeah.
[1:39:15] But if you're 110 years old, it's
[1:39:17] nothing.
[1:39:19] Think of it. It's nothing. It's not a
[1:39:22] drop.
[1:39:24] That's right. If you're a Democrat here
[1:39:26] tonight, God will save you, too.
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:31] He's a big God.
[1:39:35] [Applause]
[1:39:36] Meet Sister Connie after service. She'll
[1:39:38] be glad to talk to you.
[1:39:46] Loosen up. You'll be okay. You'll You'll
[1:39:48] live through this. You'll live through
[1:39:50] it. We got a prayer line. You'll live
[1:39:52] through this.
[1:39:56] And he watches it fall for millions of
[1:39:59] years.
[1:40:00] Think about how big God is.
[1:40:05] Millions of
[1:40:07] years. And he stops it. And he asks he
[1:40:11] he presents the question, what is
[1:40:14] it? What's he doing? He's writing his
[1:40:18] first Bible. Yes.
[1:40:22] The zodiac. Yes.
[1:40:25] How big is God? Amen. And God writes
[1:40:28] three Bibles. One the zodiac, one in the
[1:40:30] pyramids, one on paper. Amen. He's
[1:40:33] writing the first zodiac. And he starts
[1:40:35] off with the virgin, ends up with Leo
[1:40:37] the lion. Jesus first coming and second
[1:40:39] coming. Amen. And if we had time to run
[1:40:41] through it, you'd see it. But he writes
[1:40:44] it
[1:40:45] because man is to look up.
[1:40:49] God is above. And then after he gets all
[1:40:53] of every all of all of heavenly, the
[1:40:56] solar system written out, then I can see
[1:41:00] him move over here and over a clinker
[1:41:02] and over this world and it's nothing but
[1:41:04] an iceberg hanging over it. And he moves
[1:41:07] over around the sun and he begins to
[1:41:10] revolve it around and he he melts all
[1:41:12] the waters and the ice on it. And the
[1:41:14] icebergs come fling around through it.
[1:41:17] Texas is formed.
[1:41:20] If you got a complex, he mentions Texas.
[1:41:30] Louisiana. See, you're from It was It
[1:41:34] was in the
[1:41:36] beginning. He formed it before Virginia.
[1:41:39] So, don't get a complex here.
[1:41:43] And down through there, where it scraped
[1:41:45] off of
[1:41:47] The chronologicals tell us that the
[1:41:48] icebergs went on into the gulf and so
[1:41:51] forth. And now the world's without form
[1:41:54] and void and waters upon the deep. And
[1:41:58] we're in Genesis one now. And then he
[1:42:00] made the plant life. And uh then after
[1:42:02] that he he made man in his own image.
[1:42:07] Amen. I want you to just think about
[1:42:09] what I just read. You didn't learn none
[1:42:12] of that
[1:42:14] in school. That's right.
[1:42:18] Well, how would William Brham know?
[1:42:22] If you talk to the one that did it,
[1:42:28] the mighty angel, if you talk to him
[1:42:31] personally, he can tell you, you can
[1:42:34] describe this to the bride of Jesus
[1:42:36] Christ. I saved this knowledge till the
[1:42:38] bride,
[1:42:41] and I want to tell them how I created
[1:42:44] the earth. Amen.
[1:42:51] I want to remind you how great you of a
[1:42:54] people you are.
[1:42:59] This great big God thinks you're a great
[1:43:02] big wonderful people.
[1:43:09] All right. He's the author and the
[1:43:10] finisher of your faith. You're the
[1:43:13] mystery that's in this book. Yes sir.
[1:43:17] Now let me take you to some very things
[1:43:19] that you're very familiar with. He says
[1:43:22] it in the word of his power.
[1:43:25] Peace be still.
[1:43:31] None of us live to see that storm out on
[1:43:34] the sea. When the disciples felt so
[1:43:38] small,
[1:43:40] their boat was like a bottle stopper on
[1:43:43] a horrible ocean and they knew that any
[1:43:47] second that they could die.
[1:43:50] But when Jesus says peace be still, the
[1:43:54] storm dissolved.
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:43:58] And they say never a man spake like this
[1:44:01] man.
[1:44:03] So when he steps into your storm,
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:07] [Applause]
[1:44:09] so when he steps into your storm, you
[1:44:11] may not see him, right? You may not feel
[1:44:15] him, but he speaks to your storm and
[1:44:19] cause it to come.
[1:44:21] [Applause]
[1:44:28] Wonderful. I'm just going to go over
[1:44:29] some things that you're very familiar
[1:44:31] with.
[1:44:32] When he calls Lazarus out of the grave,
[1:44:35] he's got plans already for him. Yeah.
[1:44:38] Cuz notice in a few moments, he's going
[1:44:40] to tell him, "Let's eat."
[1:44:44] He seems like he's late, but he's always
[1:44:46] on time.
[1:44:49] So, he walks to the tomb. You know this
[1:44:51] story. He walks to the tomb, but the
[1:44:53] prophet takes it to another level,
[1:44:56] right? Cuz he's in contact. You don't
[1:44:58] read this in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[1:44:59] John. But when he comes to the another
[1:45:02] level, brother Brandham said he called
[1:45:04] him by name.
[1:45:09] That's right. Or he would have emptied
[1:45:10] the graves of the believers
[1:45:14] and all of them would have come forth.
[1:45:17] But today's assignment was for one.
[1:45:20] Don't worry about the rapture. When,
[1:45:22] where, how.
[1:45:25] It's not for our feeble minds to know
[1:45:26] everything about it. Don't worry. You're
[1:45:29] his seed and he's a big enough God
[1:45:32] wherever you're
[1:45:43] at. Amen. And walks in a tomb into a
[1:45:47] room,
[1:45:49] a room full of
[1:45:53] doubters. As a matter of fact, her
[1:45:55] father has went way out on the limb to
[1:45:58] have Jesus to come. Sure. Yeah.
[1:46:01] The pressure will be for the rest of his
[1:46:04] life.
[1:46:06] Yeah. You're a leader of our
[1:46:08] church. Why didn't you go to the greater
[1:46:10] leaders?
[1:46:12] But instead,
[1:46:14] You called Jesus to come
[1:46:18] and he did some sort of a witchcraft
[1:46:21] and raised your daughter back up. No, he
[1:46:23] knew the difference.
[1:46:26] I called for Jesus and she was sick. She
[1:46:29] died and you guys embombed her.
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:34] You guys sent all the the people over to
[1:46:37] sing songs and get her ready to be
[1:46:39] buried.
[1:46:40] You guys did all of that. But I knew if
[1:46:43] I could get Jesus,
[1:46:45] and he told me on the way, "Fear not."
[1:46:49] The faith that started will keep you.
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:46:55] Hallelujah.
[1:47:00] Jesus said,
[1:47:01] "Damsel, arise." That's right. He called
[1:47:05] her from another world.
[1:47:10] That's right,
[1:47:13] brother. I wish I was lived in those
[1:47:15] times. Well,
[1:47:17] I hear a prayer request.
[1:47:20] Some of you are
[1:47:22] suffering with a very common
[1:47:25] enemy. Well, you see, there was a
[1:47:27] conference about us.
[1:47:29] Yes.
[1:47:31] Amen.
[1:47:34] It was Malachi 45 and 6.
[1:47:37] An angel
[1:47:40] And I don't care what the denomination's
[1:47:42] believe or don't believe, not a matter,
[1:47:44] right? But they had a conference about
[1:47:46] me, right?
[1:47:49] And the angel told the prophet said, "If
[1:47:51] you can get the people to believe,
[1:47:56] and they come to a point to where they
[1:47:57] could have called your name
[1:48:01] and your condition
[1:48:04] and the statement is made, not even
[1:48:07] cancer.
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:09] That's right.
[1:48:10] [Applause]
[1:48:12] Lord,
[1:48:13] not even cancer shall stand.
[1:48:17] Now, I am a unique case. They call me
[1:48:22] complicated. I should have been
[1:48:25] medically
[1:48:27] dead over five years ago. Yeah. Cause
[1:48:32] three tumors, one the size of about an
[1:48:34] orange, was taken out the back of my
[1:48:36] brain. You know, we have a miracle that
[1:48:39] took place, Brother Wayne. We have a
[1:48:41] very close connection. You know,
[1:48:43] sometimes we would we would say,
[1:48:45] "Well, you know, this weekend the blind
[1:48:49] saw." Boy, we would rejoice. But the
[1:48:52] weekend that Brother Wayne came 5 years
[1:48:54] ago, I went blind.
[1:49:01] And it was a miracle.
[1:49:04] Nobody shouted cuz I went blind.
[1:49:07] lost my peripheral
[1:49:09] vision, lost in both eyes everything
[1:49:13] that's sllanded. So if you walk up to me
[1:49:15] and go to shake my hand, I can't see
[1:49:18] your
[1:49:20] hand because it's too low. I can't see
[1:49:23] it. If I drop my head, I can see your
[1:49:26] hand. So don't get miffed if I miss your
[1:49:30] hand. But you see, had I not went
[1:49:35] blind when your pastor was
[1:49:38] preaching, the tumor would have grown so
[1:49:41] quickly, it would have taken my life.
[1:49:44] But Satan is stupid.
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:52] If he would just left it till after the
[1:49:54] meeting,
[1:50:00] the tumor would have killed me along
[1:50:03] with two more growing. The tumor would
[1:50:06] have killed me. but he's so
[1:50:11] inflated in his ego,
[1:50:14] I'm going to destroy that preacher.
[1:50:17] And the
[1:50:19] blindness sent a signal something's
[1:50:22] going on.
[1:50:26] Amen. And brother Wayne stood there and
[1:50:28] held my hands
[1:50:30] up. Listen, we knew we had trouble, but
[1:50:34] the next day they would find out I had
[1:50:36] three tumors in my brain. Rejoice. Yes.
[1:50:39] God saved my life.
[1:50:56] Now, I've had about 30 MRIs, the best
[1:50:59] that we can go. MRIs where they put you
[1:51:02] in a cage and send you through a tunnel
[1:51:04] and MRI chamber and and they scan your
[1:51:07] brain and they do it backwards and
[1:51:09] forwards. You you guys would know, but
[1:51:12] anyway, they they go through that. And
[1:51:15] I've had about 30 of those MRIs and
[1:51:17] every one of them told us that the
[1:51:19] cancer was
[1:51:21] stable, the chemo was working. So, a
[1:51:24] couple months ago, I had an
[1:51:27] MRI and it's my first clean.
[1:52:00] You want to see a blind woman shout be
[1:52:02] with her.
[1:52:12] About a year and a half
[1:52:14] ago, four
[1:52:17] specialist looking through the best
[1:52:19] machines that they
[1:52:21] had told me that I had eye cancer in
[1:52:24] both
[1:52:26] eyes. They instructed me that I would
[1:52:29] lose one of my eyes. They would take it
[1:52:31] out. You've got physicians here and they
[1:52:33] you know what I don't understand all
[1:52:35] this stuff and put the lingo don't
[1:52:37] pretend and they told me that they would
[1:52:39] take one eye out the other they would
[1:52:41] shoot full of chemo and try to save one
[1:52:43] of my
[1:52:46] eyes. Brother Tim came to see me. Andrew
[1:52:49] called brother Tim and brother Tim came
[1:52:51] to see me
[1:52:53] and listen if you want to die don't call
[1:52:56] him.
[1:52:59] If you want it, you want to die, don't
[1:53:01] don't call
[1:53:03] him. When I got burned up, my lungs were
[1:53:06] gone. And he said I wouldn't live. He
[1:53:08] came said, "I didn't come to preach your
[1:53:10] funeral. I come to preach faith. Do
[1:53:12] you?"
[1:53:14] Well, you know the rest of the
[1:53:18] history. And so, Brother Tim prays for
[1:53:20] us. And they I I'd had a dream. And the
[1:53:25] dream was and the the long and short of
[1:53:27] it that the curse was over.
[1:53:31] And so, so I went to my final
[1:53:34] appointment to where that that day, if
[1:53:37] that's the way everything was, they was
[1:53:39] going to remove one of my
[1:53:41] eyeballs. I don't know whether it was
[1:53:43] left or right. And so the girl in the
[1:53:45] that prepped me and she just began to
[1:53:48] talk to me. Do you really want to go
[1:53:50] through this? My father went through it.
[1:53:52] You know, you can die a a life. You're a
[1:53:55] Christian. And she just went through it.
[1:53:56] Connie was ready to kill her with a
[1:53:58] submachine
[1:54:01] gun. She if she had the power of the
[1:54:03] spoken word, that girl would
[1:54:12] be. And so I see another person in the
[1:54:15] team and I see another person in the
[1:54:16] team. Yeah, we see it. It's there. It's
[1:54:18] there. It's there. So they put me out in
[1:54:20] a waiting room for dilation, some
[1:54:22] different things to work and some
[1:54:24] numbing medicines to work in my eyes and
[1:54:26] behind my eyes. And you know, we're just
[1:54:29] sitting there. We're just we're just
[1:54:30] sitting in there. You know, I'll be
[1:54:32] honest with you, in a trial like that,
[1:54:33] you're just
[1:54:34] going, "Hold my breath. Here we go."
[1:54:39] We walk down an aisle about 60 to 80
[1:54:42] feet. Walk down the aisle. Now we're
[1:54:44] going to see the top specialist in in
[1:54:46] the East Coast.
[1:54:48] Uh he's from overseas somewhere. You can
[1:54:50] understand some of his words, some of
[1:54:52] you can't understand. A wonderful
[1:54:54] doctor. Just absolutely wonderful.
[1:54:57] He pulls his machines up and he starts
[1:54:59] to look and he goes, "Okay, you're good.
[1:55:02] Come back in a year."
[1:55:15] Now understand we are now months in the
[1:55:18] process. Months. Brother Tim is there
[1:55:21] with me when I get a call. You know you
[1:55:23] understand you have cancer. We're going
[1:55:25] to take you through. We hear all of
[1:55:26] that. We are months in the process. We
[1:55:29] have went to one appointment after
[1:55:30] another appointment after another
[1:55:32] appointment. Well, the brain uh brain
[1:55:34] has metastasized into your eyes and this
[1:55:36] is what it is. It's prone to do this and
[1:55:39] you know now you know it's just you're
[1:55:41] just you're just in it. You're in the
[1:55:42] trial. But God's in the trial with you.
[1:55:47] Now, I want to explain something to you.
[1:55:49] I don't know how long that hall is, but
[1:55:51] maybe you walk through that hall
[1:55:56] like I walk down this hall and and I sit
[1:55:59] down and before the doctor, he pulls the
[1:56:01] machines out. He looks in my eyes and he
[1:56:02] said, "Uh, come see me in a year."
[1:56:05] Wow.
[1:56:07] He walks out of the room.
[1:56:12] We tell the doctor with him what has
[1:56:16] went on the last few months. And she
[1:56:17] said, "Let me go. Let me go get
[1:56:19] it." He walks back in and he says, "Uh,
[1:56:23] okay. What's going on?" And we tell him
[1:56:26] what's been happening through all these
[1:56:27] other doctors.
[1:56:30] That's right.
[1:56:32] He says it must have been a
[1:56:34] miscommunication.
[1:56:47] I liked it when doctors have to testify.
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:57:06] Brother Ron, I haven't seen a miracle.
[1:57:07] Okay.
[1:57:10] Okay. He's in a blue suit.
[1:57:12] [Applause]
[1:57:25] Now remember, there was a meeting about
[1:57:28] us,
[1:57:29] not even cancer. Oh, but brother, that
[1:57:32] was in a cave. No, that was between God
[1:57:34] and his prophet.
[1:57:36] [Applause]
[1:57:39] Now it's God and his people.
[1:57:43] God can't save me. Really?
[1:57:48] Amen.
[1:57:49] Come on, brother. Amen. Amen.
[1:57:54] Really? You think you're that bad?
[1:57:58] That a God that created stars and they
[1:58:01] floated for a million years and he
[1:58:03] started the process over again. You
[1:58:05] think you're too bad?
[1:58:09] Do you think you're too sick?
[1:58:18] Let's just borrow a couple quotes from
[1:58:20] brother Brandon. And I'm just going to
[1:58:22] paraphrase here for a second. Brother
[1:58:24] Brandon said, "If I pray for everybody
[1:58:26] here tonight," That's right. that's
[1:58:27] sick. That's right. And they die. That's
[1:58:30] right. That's right.
[1:58:34] I'll be right back here tomorrow night
[1:58:36] praying for the sick and believing at
[1:58:38] his word.
[1:58:40] Amen.
[1:58:42] what he said. But brother Ron, I got
[1:58:44] prayed for and I'm I'm sicker.
[1:58:47] Lord, this guy prayed for me and that
[1:58:48] guy prayed for me. What about your
[1:58:50] prayer?
[1:58:54] Amen. How powerful are we?
[1:59:00] Brother Ron, what do you think in the
[1:59:01] situation that you're in? I think like
[1:59:04] Paul did.
[1:59:06] To be absent from this body is to be
[1:59:08] present with the Lord. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:59:10] Yes, sir. Okay. Every devil in hell has
[1:59:15] came after this guy.
[1:59:19] You feel like he's came after you. So, I
[1:59:21] just use myself for a Okay. Every devil
[1:59:23] in hell has came after this guy and he
[1:59:27] hasn't been a up to the experience for
[1:59:29] five years.
[1:59:33] That means I can't lose.
[1:59:41] Amen,
[1:59:43] brother Ron. But Sister Karen died.
[1:59:49] Yeah. When your time comes.
[1:59:55] When your card is called.
[1:59:58] But she didn't lose.
[2:00:03] [Applause]
[2:00:04] We miss our loved ones. Yeah. But see it
[2:00:08] loose.
[2:00:10] [Applause]
[2:00:13] What you don't understand is a prophet
[2:00:15] explained that for us too. Yes sir. Not
[2:00:19] just a new city. Not how God created the
[2:00:22] earth. He explained
[2:00:26] how you step from this body to that
[2:00:28] body. Come on now.
[2:00:31] Your last breath here is your first
[2:00:33] breath there.
[2:00:37] Hallelujah.
[2:00:44] And before corruption can set into this
[2:00:46] body, we're standing in a new one.
[2:00:52] I don't know what it all it'll be like,
[2:00:54] but I say I win.
[2:01:03] Thank you, Lord.
[2:01:05] Amen. What about your miracle?
[2:01:11] What about your miracle?
[2:01:14] How big is your God?
[2:01:22] Don't limit God.
[2:01:25] God's not a Ferrari.
[2:01:30] For those that don't know, God's not a
[2:01:32] sports car.
[2:01:34] Yeah. Where has a limit of 232 m an
[2:01:37] hour, right? God does way faster than
[2:01:40] that.
[2:01:43] Don't put him in a box.
[2:01:47] There's no accidents.
[2:01:50] God gave you a checkbook.
[2:01:53] Don't live as underprivileged children.
[2:01:56] We are sons and daughters of God that
[2:01:59] has more authority. That's right. than
[2:02:02] the angels that are in heaven.
[2:02:05] Amen.
[2:02:08] You can't make this up. Then can you
[2:02:10] give me give you just a couple more
[2:02:12] minutes?
[2:02:13] [Applause]
[2:02:18] God made trees to worship. He made birds
[2:02:21] to worship. But he really loves to hear
[2:02:24] you worship. Yes.
[2:02:27] Now, Brother Tim went at this one way
[2:02:29] and and before I ever got here, I got
[2:02:32] these notes. I've never preached a
[2:02:33] sermon before, brother. So, I'm riding a
[2:02:35] new horse.
[2:02:38] It's Psalms chapter 50. If you want to
[2:02:40] hear some quotes, come on. If you're
[2:02:42] still Church of Christ, let me just give
[2:02:44] you a couple quotes.
[2:02:47] Forgive me. I'm just in a
[2:02:50] mood. Picking on Democrats and picking
[2:02:52] on Church of Christ.
[2:02:59] You want to go through a quote some
[2:03:00] quotes here? Praise ye the Lord. Amen.
[2:03:05] Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him
[2:03:07] in the firmament of his power. Praise
[2:03:10] him for his mighty acts.
[2:03:13] What have I just described for you? I'm
[2:03:15] coming to an end. So, pick up your
[2:03:18] pocketbooks. Get yourself
[2:03:20] ready. Praise him for his mighty acts.
[2:03:23] Praise him according to his excellent
[2:03:25] greatness. Praise him with the sound of
[2:03:28] a trumpet. Praise him with a saucery and
[2:03:30] a harp. Praise him with a timber and a
[2:03:32] dance. Praise him with stringed
[2:03:33] instruments and organs. Praise him
[2:03:37] with this is one of my favorites. Praise
[2:03:40] him with a upon a loud symbol.
[2:03:45] Amen. I like that emphasis loud.
[2:03:48] Come on.
[2:03:51] Can I pause just a moment here? When you
[2:03:54] was a sinner and you was out in the rock
[2:03:55] and roll, you played that baby so loud
[2:03:58] that people down the street could hear
[2:03:59] you.
[2:04:01] But you come to church and the devil
[2:04:03] will get in your ear. Come on. Don't get
[2:04:05] the flesh here.
[2:04:09] This is all just emotion. What was it
[2:04:11] then? You was worshiping the devil that
[2:04:14] was destroying your life. Come and
[2:04:16] worship God.
[2:04:18] You got something to really worship God.
[2:04:22] You got something to say to him.
[2:04:35] Brother Ron, I've got some excuses.
[2:04:36] Well, maybe this next quote will take
[2:04:38] care of that. Let everything that hath
[2:04:40] breath
[2:04:43] praise ye the Lord.
[2:04:48] So, you have a good excuse not to praise
[2:04:52] the Lord if you're dead.
[2:05:00] Well said. Amen. Psalms 100. Sometimes
[2:05:05] it takes more than one quote. Make a
[2:05:07] joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye
[2:05:10] lands.
[2:05:12] So, it takes care of the culture issue.
[2:05:18] We do it different over here. We do it
[2:05:20] different over there. That ain't no
[2:05:22] excuse.
[2:05:24] [Music]
[2:05:27] Amen.
[2:05:28] Serve the Lord with gladness and come
[2:05:30] before his presence with singing. Know
[2:05:32] you the Lord, he is God. It is he that
[2:05:35] hath made us and not we ourselves. We
[2:05:38] are his people and the she and the sheep
[2:05:42] of his I'm I'm just I feel like I just
[2:05:44] run a I feel like I could run a mile
[2:05:47] right now.
[2:05:48] and the sheep of his pasture. End into
[2:05:51] his gates with thanksgiving, into his
[2:05:53] courts with praise, and be thankful unto
[2:05:56] him, and bless his name.
[2:05:59] For the Lord is good, and his mercy is
[2:06:03] everlasting, and his truth is enduring
[2:06:05] to all generations.
[2:06:20] Hallelujah.
[2:06:23] And just for good measure, I'll read one
[2:06:25] more quote for you. Praise ye the Lord.
[2:06:28] Psalms 149. Praise ye the Lord. Sing
[2:06:32] unto the Lord a new song. You heard all
[2:06:34] about that last night.
[2:06:37] And his praise in the congregation of
[2:06:39] his saints. Let Israel rejoice in him
[2:06:42] that hath made him. Let the children of
[2:06:44] Zion be joyful in their king.
[2:06:47] Let them praise his name in a dance. And
[2:06:50] let them sing praises unto him with a
[2:06:53] temple and a harp. And for the Lord
[2:06:55] taketh pleasure in his people.
[2:06:59] He will bountifully.
[2:07:02] He will beautify the m and the with
[2:07:04] salvation. Let the saints be joyful in
[2:07:08] glory. Let them sing aloud upon their
[2:07:11] beds. Amen. Let the high praises of God
[2:07:15] be in their mouth and a two-edged sword
[2:07:19] in their hand.
[2:07:23] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Beautiful.
[2:07:27] Amen.
[2:07:34] Just before we quit,
[2:07:39] there's nothing that Satan can do.
[2:07:41] That's right. To stop our God.
[2:07:50] Nothing.
[2:07:53] Nothing.
[2:07:56] Nothing. Tell your neighbor nothing.
[2:08:05] Nothing.
[2:08:07] So you walked into this building with
[2:08:10] trials, tormented by
[2:08:15] situations, maybe
[2:08:17] financial. We've all been there. But if
[2:08:20] you make God your partner,
[2:08:24] That's right.
[2:08:29] [Music]
[2:08:30] He's the best realtor.
[2:08:35] He's the best doctor.
[2:08:38] He's the best lawyer.
[2:08:42] So, he'll take care of your financial
[2:08:44] counseling.
[2:08:48] You're having marriage
[2:08:50] issues. You don't need a preacher to to
[2:08:53] give you five weeks of counseling.
[2:08:57] Both of you fall in love with Jesus.
[2:09:01] Both of you fall in love with Jesus.
[2:09:05] And get so full of the Holy Ghost till
[2:09:07] the devil don't know what to do with
[2:09:09] you.
[2:09:11] and let the Holy Ghost take over your
[2:09:13] brain.
[2:09:15] Take over your tongue, take over your
[2:09:18] ears, take over your hands,
[2:09:22] sir. Take over your whole body.
[2:09:24] Hallelujah.
[2:09:27] Yes, sir. Good advice.
[2:09:31] I want to remind you, you can't lose.
[2:09:37] Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] Now, we're a supernatural people. Yeah.
[2:09:45] Cuz all of us have a different story.
[2:09:47] Yes, sir. We're not canned soup people.
[2:09:51] All of us have a different story.
[2:09:55] Every one of you have an eye
[2:09:58] map. There's no two
[2:10:01] eyes in humanity alike. Nobody has the
[2:10:05] same eyes that you do. Right.
[2:10:08] That's right. Nobody has the same
[2:10:10] fingerprint that you do.
[2:10:14] And yet God pre-planned you.
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:21] Amen. Short, tall, skinny, fluffy.
[2:10:29] [Applause]
[2:10:34] Let's be fair. Some of us like to
[2:10:37] eat and it shows on us. Some of us
[2:10:40] better.
[2:10:42] Hey, listen. You 6'5 guys
[2:10:50] that But you put that same weight on
[2:10:53] 5'5.
[2:11:03] But God don't get smaller just because
[2:11:05] of your size.
[2:11:07] [Music]
[2:11:09] I'm ending it up because I want you to
[2:11:11] understand that we have such a great big
[2:11:13] God,
[2:11:16] but he becomes so personal to you.
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:23] Really, brother Ron? Memphis.
[2:11:27] Where's my Elijah?
[2:11:31] Yes, Bombay. Uhhuh. Which of your gods?
[2:11:36] Can come and heal this man?
[2:11:42] How big is our God?
[2:11:45] How big is our God? And he challenged
[2:11:50] all of the gods
[2:11:52] to prove to them
[2:11:55] like he did on Mount Carmel,
[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:11:59] there's no other god besides me.
[2:12:05] Which of your gods can come heal this
[2:12:07] man?
[2:12:09] That's right.
[2:12:17] Where did the pope come from?
[2:12:23] Challenge them. And the angel of the
[2:12:26] Lord, not one of them coward preachers
[2:12:31] would step up. They knew better. That's
[2:12:33] correct.
[2:12:35] They knew better. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. A
[2:12:38] lot of people can talk about Brother
[2:12:39] Brandham 60 years later. Yeah. But they
[2:12:43] knew better. Yes, sir.
[2:12:46] Yes, sir.
[2:12:49] That's right. And if your critics only
[2:12:52] knew how powerful you was,
[2:12:56] [Applause]
[2:12:57] I'm talking to the demon powers that
[2:12:59] come against you. If they really knew
[2:13:02] that you had the power one of these days
[2:13:04] to call them into judgment and stand
[2:13:06] there and testify, "Mr. Cancer, you did
[2:13:10] everything to kill me.
[2:13:14] But I had such a great big God.
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:33] Amen.
[2:13:35] The musicians can come.
[2:13:45] Brother Brandham loved this
[2:13:47] song. And then because of life's
[2:13:50] journey,
[2:13:53] he wrote a verse.
[2:13:58] And he begins to sing on the wings of a
[2:14:00] snow white dove.
[2:14:03] God sends us his pure sweet love.
[2:14:09] a sign from above
[2:14:12] on the wings of a dove.
[2:14:18] Then he writes it, "Though have
[2:14:21] suffered and many away, yes,
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:26] I cried for healing.
[2:14:31] Both
[2:14:33] night and day.
[2:14:43] Faith wasn't forgotten
[2:14:47] [Music]
[2:14:50] by the
[2:14:52] father above.
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:57] He gave
[2:14:59] me his son. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:05] on the wings of
[2:15:18] on the wings of a
[2:15:22] snow.
[2:15:24] Why do
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:43] Love on the wings of
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:56] just over two weeks
[2:15:58] ago. It was on a Thursday
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:04] morning. I became so drunk I couldn't
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:14] stand. Every thought in the world went
[2:16:17] through my
[2:16:19] head. I thought, "Well, tomorrow I'll
[2:16:21] wake up and it'll be different."
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:28] I was drunker the next
[2:16:31] day. On
[2:16:34] Saturday I became so
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:43] drunk, so dizzy the world spinning every
[2:16:47] which
[2:16:48] [Music]
[2:16:50] way. Sure I thought a tumor has blowed
[2:16:53] up.
[2:17:02] again the services and Saturday night
[2:17:05] services being preached at my
[2:17:09] church and I was so sick I laid on the
[2:17:14] floor out in a
[2:17:17] patio. Connie covered me with a blanket.
[2:17:26] doctors don't have an answer for
[2:17:29] it. And I said,
[2:17:33] "Father," and I laid there and I sung
[2:17:36] this next
[2:17:38] verse. And I got up and went to bed. And
[2:17:42] the next morning, that thing was gone.
[2:17:45] [Applause]
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:48] [Applause]
[2:17:53] [Applause]
[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:18:00] I want you to sing it with me now. Maybe
[2:18:03] you're sick and have been going through
[2:18:05] a lot of
[2:18:06] things, but I just believe you won't
[2:18:10] have to leave here with that. I want to
[2:18:12] encourage you to that. We're not a
[2:18:15] prophet.
[2:18:17] We're just believers like you are.
[2:18:19] [Music]
[2:18:21] None of us are going through the same
[2:18:22] trial or the same valley.
[2:18:26] We so many times say, "I know what
[2:18:27] you're going through." We really don't.
[2:18:30] But we know one that does.
[2:18:33] [Music]
[2:18:34] We know one does.
[2:18:37] Sing this with me and then we'll call
[2:18:39] the prayer line.
[2:18:41] Though I have
[2:18:45] suffered. Could we stand?
[2:18:49] [Music]
[2:18:58] I
[2:19:01] [Music]
[2:19:13] fore faith once. Blessing
[2:19:19] for

[2:19:25] father of
[2:19:32] God. He gave me his son
[2:19:42] on the wings of the if our ministers
[2:19:47] will come and we'll start the line now.
[2:19:50] Those that are sick, would you just
[2:19:52] raise your hand before the Lord and say,
[2:19:53] "I want to be prayed for it."
[2:19:58] Would you just make your way this way
[2:20:00] and and

[3:59:41] you know, I don't think this meeting has
[3:59:43] to be any different than when brother
[3:59:44] Brandham was here. That's right.
[3:59:47] Because there were meetings even when
[3:59:49] there wasn't one feeble one left. That's
[3:59:51] right. So, I'm going to believe that for
[3:59:54] tonight.
[3:59:56] And I'm going to believe the angel of
[3:59:57] the Lord is going to go to wherever is
[3:59:59] necessary.
[4:00:01] Take care of every soul, every body.
[4:00:04] Hallelujah.
[4:00:06] [Music]
[4:00:13] Let's pray. Let's pray together. Father,
[4:00:17] you've been so wonderful and so near
[4:00:19] tonight.
[4:00:21] You've touched many souls and many
[4:00:23] bodies and many minds.
[4:00:27] You've brought great victory in the love
[4:00:29] divine,
[4:00:32] Lord Jesus.
[4:00:34] We love you with all our being.
[4:00:38] We haven't even got the English
[4:00:40] language to express
[4:00:42] ourselves
[4:00:44] fully our gratitude to your mercy.
[4:00:50] Be with the people now as they depart.
[4:00:52] Yes. May the angel of the Lord go with
[4:00:54] each one.
[4:00:56] Let them return to their home safely. Oh
[4:00:59] God.
[4:01:00] Restore our brother Ron. Lord God, give
[4:01:04] him strength. Give him rest in the night
[4:01:07] hours. Father, we give you praise and we
[4:01:10] give you
[4:01:11] honor. As we depart from this
[4:01:14] building, may your presence never depart
[4:01:17] from us in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[4:01:21] you. If you go quietly as we leave here
[4:01:24] now, the presence of the Lord is here.
[4:01:26] So we
[4:01:29] just walk in his presence, live in his
[4:01:31] presence. Breathe in his presence.
[4:01:35] He's real. God bless you.
