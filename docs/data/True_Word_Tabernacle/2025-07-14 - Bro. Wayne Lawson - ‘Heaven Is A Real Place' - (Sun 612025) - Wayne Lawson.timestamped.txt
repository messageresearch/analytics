[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] My hope is built
[0:06] on nothing less
[0:10] than Jesus blood
[0:14] and righteousness.
[0:19] I dare not trust
[0:22] the sweetest grave,
[0:28] but holy trust in Jesus name.
[0:33] My hope,
[0:36] my hope is built
[0:39] on nothing less
[0:44] than Jesus blood
[0:47] and righteousness.
[0:52] I dare not trust
[0:55] the sweetest friend
[1:00] but holy trust in Jesus name.
[1:05] Oh Christ alone
[1:10] corner
[1:12] stone
[1:14] we made strong
[1:17] in the Savior's
[1:20] love
[1:22] through the soul.
[1:25] For he is Lord,
[1:30] Lord of all.
[1:36] [Music]
[1:40] When darkness seems
[1:43] to hide his face,
[1:48] I rest on his
[1:52] unchanging praise.
[1:56] through every high
[1:59] and stormy day.
[2:04] My anger holds within the
[2:10] [Music]
[2:12] Myor
[2:14] within the
[2:18] Christ alone.
[2:24] stone
[2:26] we made strong
[2:29] in the s
[2:32] [Applause]
[2:34] through the storm.
[2:38] [Music]
[2:42] Lord.
[2:46] [Music]
[2:50] Oh yes.
[2:52] When he shall come
[2:55] with trumpet sound. Oh, sing it to him
[2:58] now. They are there.
[3:04] [Music]
[3:14] Fall standless
[3:16] [Music]
[3:17] stand before the throne.
[3:21] Single stand.
[3:24] Fall stand before the throne. Oh Christ
[3:30] alone.
[3:33] Water
[3:35] stone
[3:37] we made strong
[3:40] in the savior's
[3:43] love
[3:45] through the storm.
[3:49] He is the Lord.
[3:52] Lord of all.
[3:56] Oh yes. Christ the Lord.
[4:00] Oh,
[4:03] cornerstone.
[4:08] [Music]
[4:10] [Applause]
[4:15] [Music]
[4:19] Oh, he is Lord,
[4:23] Lord of all.
[4:27] Oh,
[4:30] when darkness seems
[4:33] to hide his face,
[4:38] I rest on his
[4:41] unchanging grace.
[4:46] In every high
[4:49] and stormy day,
[4:54] my anchor hold within the veil.
[5:00] Oh, my anchor holds. My anchor holds
[5:05] within the veil.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a beautiful reality this
[5:17] morning.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Just beyond the veil.
[5:21] That's the anchor and the hope of every
[5:23] believer. Amen. Is not in this life, but
[5:27] it's in a life just beyond. Scripture
[5:30] tells us that we're our anchor, our
[5:33] hope. Amen. Lies beyond the veil of this
[5:36] flesh. And thank God we have it this
[5:38] morning. That there's something there
[5:40] that is bigger and greater. Amen. And I
[5:43] think the more that we are conscious of
[5:46] it and the more that we talk about it,
[5:48] the more that we focus upon it, the more
[5:50] our lives are full of purpose, our
[5:52] hearts are set upon the goals of God.
[5:54] And we're looking at the recompenses of
[5:58] reward and the grace that God has before
[6:00] us. And and the less uh real it seems,
[6:03] the less heaven, the less the angels,
[6:06] the less the other dimensions, the less
[6:08] they seem real. It seems that's when
[6:11] hearts wander and minds are maybe uh
[6:14] become more complicated in life. But if
[6:17] we just focus our hearts and our minds
[6:19] upon it and I believe that's I believe
[6:21] that's why we're gathering even here
[6:22] this morning. Just listening to the
[6:25] prophet yesterday and he's talking about
[6:26] things that are to be and and he's
[6:29] talking about a young mother and how she
[6:31] begins to have a baby. He said that that
[6:33] father wanting that baby to be born
[6:35] perfect said you know there's a there's
[6:38] sometimes a body is crawling or craving
[6:40] it's crying out for something and he
[6:43] said that's you know what causes a
[6:45] father to get special things or do
[6:46] certain things and and he immediately
[6:49] says and that's that's what God is
[6:52] doing. He said, 'Why are we having these
[6:53] revivals and why are we having church
[6:56] and why are we gathering together and
[6:57] why are we so insistent on preaching the
[7:00] word of God is because there's something
[7:03] developing within the church and it's
[7:05] for another land. It's for another
[7:07] realm. Amen. It's so good to be in the
[7:09] house of God this morning and amen to be
[7:12] here on a Sunday morning. I would like
[7:13] to say that it's a great privilege to
[7:15] see each of you that could be here today
[7:17] and to see the the house of God to be a
[7:20] place that I I I find brother Brandham
[7:22] says this and for years I wondered what
[7:24] he meant when he said that the gospel
[7:27] was still the greatest drawing power
[7:30] and I'd go by football stadiums on the
[7:33] way to church and when I was
[7:34] evangelizing and you'd be going through
[7:36] a city and man the parks are full and
[7:38] the football fields are full and the
[7:40] softball fields are full and you get to
[7:41] church and maybe 200, 300 people, 400.
[7:45] And brother Ram said, "It's still the
[7:46] greatest drawing power." And then I
[7:48] listened to the next part of that. He
[7:50] said, "To them that are drawn to it."
[7:53] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Oh yeah, that's right.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; To the one that's drawn to it, there's
[7:57] nothing more greater. There's not a
[7:59] greater pull. There's not a greater
[8:00] draw. There's nothing else they'd rather
[8:02] do than serve the Lord God." Amen. And
[8:05] it's so good to be a part of that and to
[8:07] see that that burden in each of your
[8:09] hearts. And Amen. We want to just take a
[8:11] moment this morning before we open the
[8:13] word in prayer. Let's let's just bow our
[8:15] hearts for prayer. And let's speak to
[8:17] him just a moment. And father, we are
[8:20] we're so certain this morning of your
[8:22] grace. And Lord, I I thank you that Lord
[8:26] that there is a witness this morning
[8:27] that when we even bow our heart to pray
[8:31] that there's someone to hear us.
[8:34] Lord, you taught your disciples to pray.
[8:38] And you begin with our father which art
[8:40] in heaven. Lord teaching your children
[8:43] that there is things that is unseen.
[8:46] There is an ear to hear the prayer. And
[8:50] I ask you this morning father as we
[8:52] speak to you that are not visible in a
[8:55] human realm at this moment but Lord that
[8:58] you hear us.
[9:01] The Bible said that you were touched by
[9:02] faith. And I ask you this morning as our
[9:06] hearts are grown together, Lord, to come
[9:07] and worship you today,
[9:10] Lord. I ask you that you would step into
[9:12] the realm so real, Lord. That we could
[9:16] that we could feel the inspiration
[9:20] that Lord, as though we are not in
[9:22] heaven this morning, but Lord, may the
[9:25] atmosphere of heaven become so real that
[9:28] we'll be acquainted with it before we
[9:30] ever go. We ask you this morning that
[9:32] you would take the voice, Lord, of a
[9:35] simple man and use it for your glory. We
[9:38] ask that you would bless your children
[9:40] this morning as we would speak from your
[9:42] word. Lord, I know that it is written,
[9:46] you said in this Bible that he that
[9:48] heareth or readeth these words that they
[9:51] would be blessed. And I ask you this
[9:53] morning, Lord, that you would give us
[9:55] the grace as we would speak these things
[9:57] that hearts would be, Lord, set on you,
[10:00] our affections, our lives, Lord, as we
[10:03] turn to you this morning. Now, Lord,
[10:05] we're inviting you to come take your
[10:07] word, Lord, and have the preeminence in
[10:10] this meeting. In the name of Jesus
[10:12] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. And God
[10:16] bless you. If you have your Bibles
[10:18] today, we just like to go into the word
[10:20] of the Lord. Amen. I'm I'm going to be
[10:23] speaking here to you from John the 14th
[10:25] chapter. I'm going to read the first
[10:26] three verses. Um this is still under
[10:30] that same topic of the opening of the
[10:33] word. I'm I've been studying through the
[10:35] seal book and and uh of course many
[10:38] things
[10:39] but uh in doing so I I've been speaking
[10:42] to you about the inspirations that are
[10:44] coming uh to me personally about uh
[10:47] revelations contained under the seals.
[10:50] And uh it it's a it's an amazing to me
[10:52] it's an amazing study and I just pray
[10:54] that uh it would be something uh that
[10:57] would be a blessing to you in John 14.
[11:00] And I want to read the first three
[11:01] verses. Now let not your heart be
[11:04] troubled.
[11:06] For ye believe in God, believe also in
[11:09] me. For in my father's house
[11:13] are many mansions. And if it were not
[11:16] so, I would have told you. and I go to
[11:21] prepare a place for you. And if I go to
[11:24] prepare a place for you, I will come
[11:28] again and receive you unto myself
[11:31] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[11:37] Amen. Uh we ask the Lord to bless his
[11:39] word this morning. She could be seated.
[11:41] If I would take a a subject this morning
[11:43] for a topic, um just a subtopic, I'm
[11:46] trying to place something on it so we
[11:48] could find it later. if you're trying to
[11:49] get into it. Uh I want to speak to you
[11:52] this morning on heaven is a real place.
[11:55] Heaven is a real place. Uh and I love
[11:58] how Jesus said this that he went to
[12:00] prepare a place. Amen. Heaven is a real
[12:04] place and things that are to be. Brother
[12:06] Brandham says it this. He said uh if
[12:08] we're Christians and I just wonder this
[12:10] morning how many Christians are in the
[12:12] building just by the uplifting of your
[12:13] hand. And I'd say that almost every
[12:16] person I see has their hands lifted up.
[12:18] up and brother Bram said that's the way
[12:19] it is a lot of times he said in our
[12:21] meetings or even in our churches these
[12:23] days he said there's so many that are
[12:25] just Christians and he says and I think
[12:28] uh that we ought to be notified ahead as
[12:32] Christians that we don't have to guess
[12:34] and that we ought to be notified of what
[12:36] our destination will be and I want to
[12:39] speak tonight he said on the subject of
[12:41] things that are to be now that's a
[12:44] powerful subject and things that are to
[12:46] be and speaking last night on the
[12:48] rapture. He said, "Then I want to speak
[12:49] on this subject that I might tie last
[12:52] night's message." So, Brother Bam uh is
[12:54] is telling us as Christians that there's
[12:57] something that's going to be. And I I
[12:59] like to think about that that he's he's
[13:01] dealing with our future, not just our
[13:02] present, but also our future. And he's
[13:05] telling us about things that are to be,
[13:07] but he's telling us, amen, that there uh
[13:10] is a future for the church. Now, it's
[13:11] coming at a wonderful time because uh
[13:14] Brother Brandham is actually speaking
[13:16] this uh standing on the on the um you
[13:20] could say the cusp of the changing of
[13:23] time and eternity when uh when as a
[13:26] prophet reading the handwriting on the
[13:28] wall, opening of these seals and seeing
[13:30] the debacery and the evil and all the
[13:33] great uh the the the the apostasy that
[13:37] has struck the age. And he's seeing the
[13:40] darkness in schools and motherhood. And
[13:42] he's seeing it in families and churches.
[13:44] And he everywhere he looks, he can see
[13:46] the the the as it were a shadow or hand
[13:49] of darkness as it settles over the
[13:51] nations. And in the face of every bit of
[13:54] that, he's saying to the Christians,
[13:57] there's something coming for you.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what I hope it is, because in
[14:02] Hebrews 13, Paul will tell us this.
[14:04] He'll say that here we have no
[14:07] continuing city, but we seek one to
[14:10] come. So I I I love how brother Brandham
[14:12] says it. He says this this is the
[14:14] grandest of all of the ages. And he's
[14:17] permitted us to live in because it's the
[14:19] closing out of time and it's the
[14:21] blending in of eternity. And history
[14:24] only tells us what we have read and what
[14:27] has been. But what's in the future lays
[14:30] in the hands of God. Amen. I love
[14:32] brother Brandham how he says things so
[14:34] wonderfully and he says it to us like
[14:36] this. He says I want you to know every
[14:39] sensible person that has any reasoning
[14:41] knows something's this to happen.
[14:43] There's not a person in this building
[14:45] that's got right mind but knows that
[14:47] this world cannot stand under these
[14:50] conditions.
[14:52] We can't stand friends and there's not
[14:54] one thing as your pastor, as your
[14:57] brother, there is not one thing that I
[14:59] could guide you towards this morning but
[15:02] to Jesus Christ. My when I think about
[15:05] it this morning, I think of how that a
[15:07] prophet said, "In all of the things,
[15:09] there's only one thing that I know that
[15:11] I could point you to that is a certain
[15:14] future for you as a person, as a
[15:16] believer, and that is to Jesus Christ."
[15:18] Brother Brandham says, "In things that
[15:20] are to be," he says, "I believe this.
[15:22] Therefore, the bride in the rapture is
[15:24] going to come. And I believe that this
[15:26] is all pre-planned by God,
[15:29] &gt;&gt; and it's backed up." And the beginning,
[15:31] he knowed every man, every place. He He
[15:34] knew all about it. It's pre-planned. God
[15:36] knew it would be here. He made a way so
[15:39] that when we get here, he's going to
[15:41] prepare a place for us. And when we get
[15:44] there, it'll all be prepared. Amen.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Even as this night is prepared, as this
[15:51] hour is prepared. Yes, his fornowledge
[15:54] tells us this thing. And we know he's
[15:56] omnipresent, right? He's omniscant and
[15:59] he is omnipresent. Therefore, his
[16:01] fornowledge. He can't be like the wind
[16:05] over the earth because he's a being. He
[16:09] isn't just a myth. He's a being. He
[16:12] dwells. He dwells in a house. He dwells
[16:15] in a place called heaven.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; He dwells in a house. He dwells in a
[16:22] place called heaven. Listen, heaven is
[16:25] not a pipe dream.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Heaven is not the uh theory of some uh
[16:31] uh poor people grasping to reach up to a
[16:34] pie in the sky to give the uh uh you uh
[16:38] the underlings of the world something to
[16:40] hope for. Y'all know that's the teaching
[16:42] of the great intellectual mind, the
[16:43] agnostic and the antichrist and amen.
[16:46] And and and the atheist is that you are
[16:48] all being fed a line to keep a social
[16:51] pattern and this Christianity of
[16:53] something that's coming and something
[16:55] that's just being given to you. It's all
[16:57] in somebody's mind. But listen, I I want
[16:59] you to know it's more amen than
[17:01] somebody's mind or somebody's idea or
[17:04] some kind of a a pipe dream that's been
[17:06] given to the church. Amen. What it is is
[17:09] it's a reality and heaven is real and
[17:12] God is real and these things that we are
[17:14] preaching are real. Amen. And I believe
[17:16] we're going to go there because Jesus
[17:19] said in his own words, "I go to prepare
[17:23] a place for you." Amen. And just as this
[17:26] human body was prepared for your coming
[17:28] to this earth, so has God prepared a
[17:31] place for you when you leave this earth.
[17:34] There is a place prepared. As sure as
[17:36] there is a God in heaven, there is a
[17:38] place for you as a church of the living
[17:41] God. Amen. Brother Ben, preaching
[17:42] sermons like things that are to be more
[17:45] than a couple hours. Preaching future
[17:47] home of the earthly bridegroom and the
[17:49] heavenly bridegroom more than three
[17:51] hours. Amen. He preaches the rapture
[17:54] more than two hours. The sudden secret
[17:56] going away of the church nearly a nearly
[17:58] a two-hour sermon now. Amen. That's
[18:01] about five, seven, nine different hours.
[18:03] Amen. just in this little concept of
[18:05] thought and and and I'll say this much
[18:07] more he says in many other places. So
[18:09] please this morning as I speak to you
[18:11] amen when you leave here today I want
[18:13] you to know before I preach this amen I
[18:15] will not conclusively deal with this
[18:18] subject. There is no way within just
[18:20] this few moments of time that I could
[18:22] amen bring in every piece and every
[18:24] moment and every situation and compass
[18:27] it into one sermon. So give me a little
[18:29] grace in this. If I miss your favorite
[18:31] quote, then just know I know it's there,
[18:32] but I can't take the extra hour to
[18:34] preach it this morning. Amen. And if I
[18:36] say a little something that don't fit
[18:38] within your realms, just remember how
[18:40] brother Bam said that you should eat
[18:42] apple pie.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; How many pie eaters we got here? Amen.
[18:46] If you come to something that you just
[18:47] can't maybe get digested like apple,
[18:50] brother Bam said just spit it out and
[18:52] keep eating. Amen. So I I believe that
[18:54] there's a lot of things, amen, that to
[18:57] be discussed upon this subject because
[19:00] it's talking about our future as a
[19:02] church, as a people. Amen. Not just what
[19:05] we are here, but what we're going to be
[19:07] in the fourthcoming. Now, if you're
[19:09] watching these seals as we're studying
[19:11] them, you're getting into the fourth
[19:13] horse rider in the fourth seal. Amen.
[19:15] And you're seeing a pale horse come
[19:17] riding. And and the prophet said simply,
[19:19] it's just a mixture of the three other
[19:21] horses. Amen. And it's coming together.
[19:24] And he said, "Look how these three
[19:25] things are coming together. And what is
[19:28] it here?" It's named death and hell is
[19:31] going to follow after it. Amen. So death
[19:33] is coming and hell is going to follow
[19:36] after that. So we see, amen, that this
[19:39] power was going to be given for
[19:40] destruction and for troubles. And so we
[19:43] can look this morning and we can see
[19:44] denominationalism and we can see the
[19:46] harlot and we can see the beast and and
[19:49] we can see that it's it's been named in
[19:51] this age. Now, the reason we have a name
[19:54] for death and we know what it is is
[19:56] because we've had a prophet among us.
[19:58] Now, if you're uh studying this in the
[20:00] fourth seal, there's actually a fourth
[20:03] living creature that comes forward and
[20:04] tells John to come and see. And that is
[20:07] the eagle. And it's not just an eagle.
[20:09] It's actually a flying eagle. And this
[20:12] eagle is the last of the creatures that
[20:15] does. So if you watch the fifth, sixth,
[20:16] and seventh seal, there's actually no
[20:18] creature related with those other seals
[20:22] because brother Ram said here in the
[20:23] fourth seal is when death is going to be
[20:25] named. In other words, the eagle or the
[20:28] messenger that has came and preached
[20:30] unto us. Not only has he told us what
[20:33] is, but he's going to also talk to us
[20:35] about what is coming. And it will be
[20:38] just as vindicated as what he's talking
[20:40] about in current times as what it's
[20:42] going to be. So, Brother Brandham is the
[20:44] one that looked upon denomination and
[20:46] said, "It's death." He looked upon the
[20:48] Catholic and said, "It's death." He
[20:50] looked upon the the rightest living of
[20:52] the age. Y'all remember it? He met those
[20:54] Americans in the Canadian uh hotel and
[20:57] the girls running down the hall drunk
[20:58] and half-dressed and their babies at
[21:00] home with their husbands and they're
[21:02] crying, "Woo! This is life." And he said
[21:04] he caught one of them. Can you imagine?
[21:06] He caught one of them by the hand. He
[21:08] said, "Lady, this is not life. This is
[21:10] death." Amen. And what this America
[21:12] calls life, its night life and social
[21:15] and all of its events and all, that's
[21:17] not life. That's death. Amen. And hell
[21:21] is going to follow after it. Amen. But
[21:23] life comes from the word of God. Amen.
[21:27] You see, when Jesus comes out of the
[21:29] heavens of heavens, he's riding one
[21:31] solid colored horse, and it is the word
[21:34] of God. knowing as a church that we will
[21:37] not mix together things to bring life,
[21:40] but it is the word and the word only
[21:43] that brings life in the church. And I I
[21:45] certainly believe tonight or this
[21:47] morning, that's why, amen, we have life
[21:49] is because we have the word of God. If
[21:52] that is death and hell follows after it,
[21:54] amen, then I believe there is a word
[21:56] this morning and there's something
[21:58] following the belief in this word. It's
[22:00] a heaven. It's a glorified body. It's a
[22:03] redeemed earth. There is an eternal life
[22:06] ahead of the believer that believes this
[22:09] word.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, I believe that we've had
[22:13] a beast, an eagle, a divine revealer of
[22:16] the word. Amen. That all of heaven
[22:19] follows after this message. It's coming
[22:21] from an immortal land. It's vindicating
[22:23] and made declared to us the word of
[22:25] rapture. It's declared to us the son of
[22:28] man is here. It's declared to us the
[22:31] pillar of fire is on the earth. Now,
[22:33] it's important to me that the pillar of
[22:35] fire is here because this is the return
[22:38] of the pillar of fire. The same one,
[22:40] folks, that led the children of Israel
[22:43] out of Egypt and took them into the
[22:46] promised land is the same pillar of fire
[22:49] that has came to this church to take us
[22:52] not just out of denomination, not just
[22:55] to equipp us for a rapture, but that
[22:57] same pillar of fire will lead us all the
[23:00] way to the millennium. Amen. And we
[23:02] cannot miss it because the one that is
[23:04] leading is the only one that knows how
[23:07] to get there. He is the way. The Bible
[23:10] says in John John 16:12, he Jesus said,
[23:13] "I have many things to say, but you
[23:15] cannot bear them now." How many knows
[23:17] that's a prophecy of the seals?
[23:20] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I got things to say,
[23:22] but I can't bear them." Now, brother
[23:23] said, "That's a prophecy of the seals."
[23:25] So, people that thinks the seals were
[23:27] preached before Brother preached them,
[23:29] Jesus said they wasn't. He said, "I'd
[23:31] like to say them, but I can't say them.
[23:33] I can't say them now." But when the
[23:35] seventh angel sounds,
[23:38] That's Bible truth, friends. Amen. You
[23:41] see, how be it when the Spirit of truth
[23:43] has come, Amen. He will guide you into
[23:46] all truth, and he shall not speak of
[23:48] himself, but whatsoever he shall hear,
[23:50] that shall he speak, and he will show
[23:52] you things to come. Isn't that powerful?
[23:55] The spirit of truth is here to lead you,
[23:58] to guide you. Amen. And it's here to
[24:01] tell you things that are to be. Can we
[24:03] just say it that way? Amen. And we find
[24:05] then Jesus said it. Let not your heart
[24:07] be troubled. You believed in God.
[24:09] Believe also in me. Now if my father's
[24:12] house are many mansions were not so I
[24:14] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[24:15] place. Now look how Jesus said this.
[24:17] Don't let your heart be troubled with
[24:19] all that you're seeing with everything
[24:21] that's happening now. Jesus is actually
[24:22] fisten to be destroyed at the cross.
[24:25] He's going to be crucified. The worst.
[24:26] Amen. He's going to be taken into
[24:28] government custody. They're going to
[24:30] condemn him to death. They're going to
[24:31] give him corporal punishment. Amen. And
[24:33] they're all going to watch this. They're
[24:34] going to watch the humiliation or the
[24:36] degradation of who they believe is the
[24:39] Messiah. Amen. They believe he's there
[24:41] to fulfill all those scriptures. And
[24:43] they're going to watch him crumble under
[24:45] the Roman emperor's hands. And Jesus
[24:48] said, "Don't let your heart be troubled.
[24:51] My life is ending for a purpose. I go
[24:55] away to prepare a place." Now, listen.
[24:57] If you can believe God, believe me when
[25:00] I say this. Amen. Don't let your heart
[25:02] be troubled. Do you see? Then it's your
[25:04] faith and what Jesus died for that's
[25:07] going to take the trouble out of your
[25:09] heart. If your heart is troubled today,
[25:11] let me say this. Jesus said, "I give
[25:13] unto you peace, but not the way the
[25:16] world gives you peace." He never gave
[25:18] you any any any anti-depressants. He
[25:20] never gave us any counseling. But what
[25:22] he gave us was a sure promise of the
[25:25] word of God and of tomorrow. And I say
[25:28] this, and I I'm not knocking medication.
[25:30] We need it. God bless every every
[25:31] doctrine ever. Amen. You you that's not
[25:34] what we're talking about. Amen. But
[25:35] Jesus was pushing out something that
[25:38] would give peace to the world and that
[25:40] is faith in why I have come here and
[25:43] what I'm doing when you cannot see me
[25:45] any longer. You have to know that you
[25:48] believed in God then don't be troubled
[25:51] because faith is what brings peace and
[25:53] expectation.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said that where I am. Amen.
[25:58] Now this is uh this is a powerful thing
[26:01] to me that where I am Jesus did not
[26:04] dissipate once he was resurrected.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; He was resurrected bodily. Amen. The
[26:10] Bible tells us that he was seen of many
[26:14] and preached unto them for 40 days. My
[26:16] Bible tells me after his resurrection,
[26:19] he took fish from the fire and ate it to
[26:22] prove he wasn't a ghost. He was a
[26:25] glorified man.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. That where I am. So that
[26:30] body is somewhere this morning.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ. I do not agree
[26:36] with those people that believe that
[26:38] Jesus, Amen, was just a temporary
[26:40] moment. Amen. And he's just our brother
[26:42] now or he's just something that was just
[26:45] for a moment in time and he disappears.
[26:47] But my Bible says in Isaiah 9:6 that the
[26:50] government would be upon his shoulder
[26:51] and would sit upon the throne, amen, of
[26:54] David throughout eternity. Amen. The
[26:56] Bible records and when he comes from the
[26:58] heavens of heavens, he is upon his
[27:00] vesture. It's named the word of God and
[27:03] he is the king of kings, the lord of
[27:04] lords, the glor. Listen, there is no
[27:07] heaven without Jesus.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Amen. Somebody said,
[27:11] "Well, I tell you, one of these days
[27:12] Jesus will be our brother and we won't
[27:14] be able to worship him no more." And
[27:16] some don't even believe there'll be a
[27:18] Jesus there at all. Amen. But let me ask
[27:20] you, what is a heaven without Jesus?
[27:22] Amen. He is the object of our worship.
[27:25] He is the adoring of our love and our
[27:27] faith and our hope. He is our savior,
[27:30] our redeemer. He is our Lord. He is our
[27:32] God. He is what I worship and what I
[27:35] live for. I do not live just to be in in
[27:38] a nice place. I live so I can sit at the
[27:42] feet of my redeemer. Amen. And worship
[27:44] him the rest of my days.
[27:47] I'll say this, the greatest moment, the
[27:49] highest moment in human existence is
[27:51] when you so get in the presence of God
[27:54] that you lose the cares of this life.
[27:56] And and to think about the height of
[27:59] that moment, you you young people, when
[28:01] you get in that influence of that
[28:03] anointing, that spirit, and you're
[28:04] dancing down the aisle and you're
[28:06] worshiping God in a dance or rejoicing
[28:09] or Amen. when the spirit falls over you
[28:12] and you break out into, y'all know what
[28:13] that is. when sister hope when you break
[28:15] out in tongues and the power of God.
[28:17] Amen. How high you feel in that very
[28:20] moment. Amen. Listen, there is nothing
[28:23] in this earth that can compare with the
[28:26] height and the glory that a man feels in
[28:29] the presence of Jesus Christ. But this
[28:31] will not be a moment. This will not be
[28:33] one second. This will be the rest of
[28:36] eternity standing in the presence of the
[28:39] almighty God. Oh, that's what heaven is.
[28:43] It's in the presence of God. It's in the
[28:45] presence of the one who gave life unto
[28:48] us. Oh, I want to go to heaven, but I
[28:50] want to see Jesus. I don't want a crown.
[28:53] I don't want a robe. I don't want none
[28:55] of that. I want to see Jesus.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what I want to see.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; My I tell you, when you when you've met
[29:08] him, you know he's still real,
[29:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:13] Heaven is the place. Jesus said that
[29:16] where I am,
[29:18] &gt;&gt; that where I am,
[29:20] &gt;&gt; that he is somewhere and he's in heaven.
[29:22] And I know there's some spiritual
[29:24] applications to John 14. Don't don't uh
[29:26] don't think I don't know, but I want to
[29:29] look at the reality part of this.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Heaven. Brother Brandham says it in 65.
[29:35] Christ revealed in his word. You're
[29:37] going to find out one of these days.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you go to heaven, you don't
[29:41] fly off somewhere else.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; You're still right here
[29:45] &gt;&gt; in another dimension.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Then the heaven is not a
[29:50] million miles away.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Then heaven's not somewhere way off
[29:55] somewhere. It is a real place, but it's
[29:58] right here
[29:59] &gt;&gt; in another dimension. Brother Bram says
[30:02] it like this. You're standing right here
[30:03] at the platform speaking to the father.
[30:06] I said, "Father, I know you're standing
[30:08] right here." Amen. At this platform and
[30:11] the glorious nails card one is so close
[30:14] in another world or another dimension,
[30:17] he's standing right here.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd say this when we're dealing
[30:21] with closeness, somebody said, "Brother
[30:22] Wayne, how far is it?" I'll tell you
[30:24] this. When the prophet went beyond the
[30:26] curtain of time, Amen. Uh, and we played
[30:28] the the the portion of you so I wouldn't
[30:30] have to repreach the whole thing, but we
[30:32] played that portion to deal with
[30:34] closeness of heaven. Brother Brandham
[30:36] measured it as a a Kuckian would. He
[30:38] said it was only about 20 ft from where
[30:41] I was.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "There I was in heaven looking
[30:44] back. It was only about 20 feet from my
[30:47] body." So, amen. I I I don't I don't I
[30:50] don't want to say, "Amen. It was that
[30:51] far." I want to say it like this. It was
[30:53] that near.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't 20 foot far. It was 20 foot
[30:56] near because we thought it was a
[30:58] thousand or a million or 200 light
[31:01] years. Amen. When the astronauts went to
[31:03] the moon, amen, they said, "We didn't
[31:05] find him up there." And they come home
[31:07] disappointed that Jesus wasn't on the
[31:08] moon. Amen. The Bible never said he was
[31:10] on the moon. He said he was in heaven.
[31:12] And heaven is just a dimension that's
[31:14] just faster than the one we're in right
[31:17] now. Amen. I'll tell you, he's within
[31:19] the sound of your voice. Amen. He can
[31:21] feel you. He can hear your prayer. Amen.
[31:25] Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; He's 20 ft close.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; All the saints of the ages from the time
[31:32] of Apostle Paul all the way to the day,
[31:35] they're just 20 ft from where you are
[31:37] now.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Now, we know dimensions, right? We've
[31:42] heard them. Let's just take seven of
[31:44] them. This is what the prophet teaches.
[31:46] Very very clear teaching that there are
[31:49] seven dimensions. The first three of
[31:51] them, time, light, matter. The next one
[31:53] he says is this, you know, science,
[31:55] radio, television. Now, somebody said,
[31:57] "Well, I don't believe in dimensions."
[31:59] Well, turn the radio on and
[32:01] &gt;&gt; turn the television on
[32:04] &gt;&gt; now. Turn the phone on
[32:06] &gt;&gt; and it tells you there is a whole
[32:08] another world that you're not seeing.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; They're passing through here right now.
[32:12] You say, "There ain't nothing else in
[32:14] this room." Turn on a television,
[32:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:16] &gt;&gt; And it'll catch. Remember back in the
[32:18] days of the analog when they rabbit
[32:21] ears? I I when I was a little boy, we
[32:22] had rabbit ears and K8 TV. That's all we
[32:25] had. That or white noise? It's fuzz or
[32:28] that, you know, had them little rabbit
[32:29] ears and and and and and you know, hey,
[32:33] uh uh uh Bugs Bunny was going right
[32:35] through the room.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Road Runner was running right over my
[32:41] couch, but we didn't know it till we
[32:44] turned on the television. And then we
[32:46] received a signal that proved
[32:49] &gt;&gt; brother man said television was here
[32:51] when Jesus was here.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; But you couldn't have told them in that
[32:56] day because there was nothing to declare
[32:59] it in your dimension.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; But when we got radio and television and
[33:03] radar amen and we started getting these
[33:05] signals, somebody began to realize,
[33:07] amen, oh there are things that we can't
[33:09] see in this room. Brother Ram said, then
[33:11] we go right on into the region of the
[33:13] lost in the fifth dimension. He said
[33:15] those are where people go. Amen. That
[33:17] that that have never accepted Christ.
[33:19] You know, as a young child, you're under
[33:21] the blood of Christ. Now, when you come
[33:23] to age of accountability, you have to
[33:25] accept that blood for your own. Amen.
[33:27] And anyone who don't accept that blood
[33:30] for their own, when they pass from this
[33:32] life, they go beyond the blood into the
[33:35] regions of the lost. Amen. But beyond
[33:37] that is the sixth dimension. Amen. with
[33:40] a prophet of God called the paradise or
[33:42] the region of the saved where someone
[33:44] who accepted the blood goes into that
[33:46] region when they pass from here. The
[33:49] seventh is the presence of God. Brother
[33:51] Bram said that's when he was there. He
[33:53] asked them, I want to see Jesus if I'm
[33:56] in heaven. And first thing he wanted to
[33:58] see, I want to see Jesus. And they said,
[34:00] he's just a little higher than this.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, what was it? He
[34:05] was in that seventh dimension. But one
[34:07] day he said, he's going to come and when
[34:09] he does, he's going to judge you first.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; That's powerful, isn't it? Amen. He's
[34:15] going to judge him first. Brother Ram
[34:16] said the people over there said they
[34:18] went in on his doctrine. He says that's
[34:20] the people said we're resting on the
[34:22] thought that you have taught us what
[34:24] Paul taught his believers. Amen. And we
[34:27] find out then that Jesus himself went up
[34:29] into heaven in a corporal body. Amen.
[34:32] And he sits there as a nailed scarred
[34:35] body upon the throne of God. Amen. I'll
[34:39] just say it like brother Bam did. He
[34:40] says he lived in that scarred and
[34:42] bruised for our sins and for our
[34:44] sickness. And he sits on the throne of
[34:46] God.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see his corporal body?
[34:49] Brother Bram said the thing that is
[34:50] different today about Jesus on the
[34:52] earth, he says today he's here in the
[34:54] form of the Holy Ghost. But his corporal
[34:57] body sits at the right hand of God in
[34:59] heaven.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Queen of Sheba, he said
[35:02] the only thing is the corporal body. His
[35:04] body is at the right hand of God, the
[35:06] father in heaven, sitting on the throne
[35:07] of God. Do you believe that?
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, you have no power if that's not
[35:15] true. Because the believer today as a
[35:19] human being, we were fallen from God.
[35:22] Amen. And we had to have something to
[35:24] lift us back from what Adam lost. And
[35:27] Jesus sat down on the throne of God that
[35:30] a human being
[35:31] &gt;&gt; would be back on the throne of God
[35:34] because he is our kinsman sitting on the
[35:36] throne of God. That's why Paul would say
[35:38] this. If you that been risen with
[35:39] Christ, seek the things which are above.
[35:42] Amen. Who Christ siteth on the right
[35:44] hand of God. Set your affections there.
[35:47] Amen. Because he's there, then set your
[35:49] affections there. In Mark 16, I'll just
[35:51] give you the scriptures. Mark 16 says,
[35:53] Amen, that the Bible says he was
[35:55] received up into heaven and set on the
[35:58] right hand of God. Acts chapter 3 said
[36:00] that he would send Jesus Christ be
[36:02] preach be preached unto you whom the
[36:04] heaven must receive until the time of
[36:08] the restitution of all things. Now,
[36:10] that's exactly scripture with what
[36:12] brother Brandham said. He said he's
[36:14] right above us now, but he's got to wait
[36:18] until this little season is over and
[36:20] then he'll come. Amen. And he'll take us
[36:23] with him. Remember, he talks about how
[36:25] that they were there in theophony. Now,
[36:27] the scripture tells us, Amen. 1 Peter
[36:29] chap 3 22, he has gone into heaven and
[36:33] sits on the right hand. Now, when we
[36:36] when you start discussing this, it opens
[36:38] up a deeper now it opens up a deeper
[36:40] thing because now we're talking about
[36:42] three different bodies. We're talking
[36:44] about bodies celestial, we're talking
[36:47] about bodies terrestrial, and we're
[36:49] talking about glorified bodies.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Three bodies, terrestrial, celestial,
[36:54] glorified. That's what the prophet says.
[36:56] He says, see what it is. He says when we
[36:59] drop this robe, we take on a theophony
[37:02] body. He says, "See, that's a body not
[37:04] made with hands, not born of a woman,
[37:06] we're going to go to that. But then at
[37:08] the coming of the Lord, his physical
[37:10] body, then that body that if you're if
[37:13] you die, let's just put it real plain.
[37:15] If you would die before the time, amen,
[37:18] that Christ comes from the heavens of
[37:19] heaven in his corporal body, then this
[37:22] body that dies, you as a person, because
[37:25] we've never seen the real you, that's
[37:27] not the real you. The real you is the
[37:29] one inside that." And brother Ram said,
[37:31] "It ain't no different than a man
[37:33] wearing a coat and he takes one coat off
[37:35] and hangs it in the closet because it's
[37:37] old." And then he puts on a new coat,
[37:39] which is your theophony body, and you
[37:41] step in that theophony. But the
[37:43] theophony is only a temporary
[37:46] until the great resurrection of the
[37:49] saints.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; How many knows that?
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. at the resurrection, brother Bam
[37:54] said, then this theophony will come back
[37:56] and pick up that human body and glorify
[38:00] it.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a real point important part
[38:03] now because Jesus came to redeem you.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He came to redeem you and
[38:10] that theophony will pick up this human
[38:12] body and glorify it where you'll have a
[38:15] body likened unto his own glorious body.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Now, now church, that's real powerful.
[38:21] And there's a real reason to make sure
[38:23] we get this right because brother Bam
[38:25] said to us that are dwelling in the
[38:27] flesh. He says if we are still alive at
[38:30] that time.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; He said that theophony is going to come
[38:34] and pick you up. Hallelujah. Amen. What
[38:36] a what a season to live. Amen. What a
[38:39] season. Because that theophony is
[38:41] already forming on the inside of a
[38:44] believer.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What's the mystery of the
[38:48] change? Prophet of God said it develops
[38:49] around the word. Do you see then? Amen.
[38:52] What what if you're if you've already
[38:54] made the connection. Brother Bam said,
[38:56] if it's during the rapture that then
[38:58] this body returns back and picks up that
[38:59] glorified body in 1 Corinthians 15:40,
[39:02] if you like to study these things, 1
[39:04] Corinthians 15:40, it records celestial
[39:07] and terrestrial. So, we're talking about
[39:09] theophony and we're talking about a
[39:10] human body, two different bodies. Amen.
[39:13] Paul was caught in up in the heavens and
[39:16] saw these things in 2 Corinthians 12
[39:20] 2-4. Now, did brother Bam teach the same
[39:22] thing Paul taught? Watch. Amen. Amen.
[39:25] And I knew a man. I can't tell whether
[39:27] he was in the body or out of the body,
[39:29] but he was caught up into the third
[39:31] heavens. And the Bible says that which
[39:34] was not lawful for man to utter. Amen.
[39:37] Paul went there and saw it because it's
[39:39] a reality. He saw it with his own eyes.
[39:43] He was He was transferred into that
[39:45] place and come back to tell us it's
[39:47] real, but I can't tell you a lot about
[39:49] it.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's powerful to me. It's
[39:53] real, but I can't tell you a lot about
[39:54] it because it's yet unlawful. In 2
[39:57] Corinthians 5, Paul tells you more about
[39:59] it. He said, "We know this earthly
[40:00] tabernacle be dissolved. We have a
[40:02] building, a house not made with hand,
[40:04] eternal in the heavens." Then he tells
[40:07] us, Paul again tells us this human body
[40:10] to be dissolved. You have one already
[40:13] waiting. Now, now this was not just
[40:15] Paul's revelation that Paul left uh amen
[40:19] without account. Because Peter himself,
[40:21] Amen, makes the same statement in 1
[40:23] Peter chapter 1 and verse 13. He said,
[40:25] "I think it meet as long as I'm in this
[40:27] tabernacle to put you in remembrance
[40:30] knowing that shortly I must put off this
[40:32] tabernacle."
[40:34] He was telling, "I've got this
[40:36] tabernacle. I got to put it off." Amen.
[40:38] But I I know this, amen, that I'm
[40:40] enduring after my decisions to have
[40:43] these things always in remembrance. Now,
[40:45] watch what he says in the 16th verse.
[40:47] Because we have not followed cunningly
[40:49] devised fables. We have been made known
[40:52] unto you the power and the coming of our
[40:54] Lord Jesus Christ, which we were
[40:56] eyewitnesses of his majesty. Yeah.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Now, now Peter in 1 Peter chapter 1,
[41:01] y'all know he's referring to Matthew 17.
[41:04] How many aware of that?
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Peter in 1 Peter 1 is actually talking
[41:09] about his experience on Mount
[41:13] Transfiguration in Matthew 17. And can
[41:16] you imagine being Peter standing there
[41:18] and seeing the Lord Jesus transferred
[41:20] before you and all of the sudden you see
[41:23] Moses and Elijah whom you know Moses has
[41:26] been dead for hundreds of years. And
[41:28] Elijah was carried off on a chariot. But
[41:31] there they were in the promised land.
[41:33] Amen. 800 years later. And they were
[41:37] standing there. And Peter knew who they
[41:39] was. Amen. He said, "I'm an eyewitness
[41:42] that if a man put off this tabernacle,
[41:45] there's another one that cannot decay."
[41:47] And hundreds of years later, he look
[41:50] just like they did back.
[41:52] [Music]
[41:54] &gt;&gt; This is not a cunning device fable. It's
[41:56] the word of God. It is a more sure word
[41:59] of prophecy. The Bible tells us in
[42:01] Matthew 18, Jesus himself said it. He
[42:04] said, "Their angels do always behold the
[42:07] face of my father in heaven." Amen.
[42:09] Brother said, "If you want to understand
[42:10] that," he said, "You got to go to Acts
[42:12] the 12th chapter and see when Apostle
[42:15] Peter was supposed to be dead and he
[42:17] come knocking on the door of John Mark."
[42:19] Amen. And they come to the door and
[42:21] answered and said, "Who is it?" He said,
[42:23] "It's Peter." And they said, "It can't
[42:24] be Peter. He's dead. It must be his
[42:28] angel.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Now, now look, folks, brother Bam is not
[42:32] ever saying we're angels. And Jesus is
[42:35] not saying we're angels, but Paul says
[42:37] the body is celestial.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; It is angelic in it's a celestial body,
[42:43] not an angel. You are always sons.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; You are always sons. Amen. And brother
[42:49] Bam says, "Behold in their face, uh the
[42:52] angels always behold the face of the
[42:54] fathers." He said, "In other words,
[42:56] their angels or their messengers, their
[42:58] bodies, their angelic bodies they go to
[43:02] if they die. They're always before my
[43:05] father's face. If this earthly
[43:07] tabernacle be dissolved, we have one
[43:10] already waiting." My goodness. Amen. He
[43:14] did not mean that he would go prepare a
[43:16] mansion. He meant he would go prepare a
[43:18] body.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Some of these bodies are
[43:21] redheaded and some are blackheaded." And
[43:23] Amen. Thank God. Amen. Some of you that
[43:25] ain't got hair going to get some hair.
[43:29] I don't think any perfect heads without
[43:32] hair. So,
[43:35] you know what they say, right? They say
[43:37] that uh there's only a few perfect heads
[43:40] and the rest of them God covers with
[43:41] hair.
[43:45] There's red, yellow. God is God of
[43:49] variety. Don't ever get it in your mind.
[43:51] Everybody has to be the same.
[43:53] Come on, church. God is a God of
[43:55] variety. Just go down to the go down to
[43:57] the nursery and look around and there's
[43:59] red flowers and blue flowers and yellow
[44:01] flowers and amen. And the same God
[44:03] creates all of them. There's a blue bird
[44:05] and a yellow bird and there's a black
[44:06] bird and a brown bird and and all kinds
[44:09] of birds and all kinds of humans and all
[44:11] kinds of characters and all but they're
[44:13] all according to God because God is a
[44:16] God of variety. Listen, we we find out
[44:19] brother Bam said then he's not talking
[44:21] about a mansion. And he's talking about
[44:23] a body.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 1 John chapter 3, I hope this
[44:27] is okay. In 1 John chapter 3, he said,
[44:29] "Beloved, we are now sons of God. It
[44:31] don't yet appear what we shall be, but
[44:34] we know that we shall be like him."
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is. Questions
[44:39] and answers. Brother Bam said, "It's not
[44:41] even been revealed yet
[44:43] &gt;&gt; what it would be." He said, "But I know
[44:46] because I saw it."
[44:48] &gt;&gt; I know because I saw it. What is it?
[44:51] Amen. I wondered what it would be. It is
[44:54] a celestial body. Amen. Let me say this.
[44:57] Amen. A celestial body. When you pass
[45:00] beyond this life, now I'm not preaching
[45:02] a funeral this morning. I'm preaching
[45:03] your future.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when you pass beyond this
[45:07] life, there is, amen, an immortal
[45:11] dwelling place beyond this region, and
[45:14] there is no babies going to be there.
[45:16] Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Do you know that every person will be
[45:20] somewhere that age range of 18, 20, 21,
[45:23] 22? Brother said, "Why is it that you go
[45:26] up to a perfection in human life and
[45:28] then you fall off the other side?" He
[45:30] said, "Showing you the age of that
[45:32] theophony." Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; What he said, he said, "You're eating,
[45:37] you're eating, you're getting stronger,
[45:38] you're getting stronger, and someday you
[45:39] start eating and you still eating the
[45:41] same foods going off on the other side
[45:43] because that is the age of that perfect
[45:46] body." Now, brother Brandon, it's very
[45:48] clear to us when he went beyond the
[45:50] curtain the first time and he seen
[45:52] Sharon Rose. Remember, he's walking
[45:54] there, the wheel on the wagon is broken,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; and a girl, beautiful girl, says to him,
[46:00] "Good morning, daddy."
[46:02] He says, "Now you're the same age as I
[46:04] am. Why would you call me daddy?" And
[46:06] she said, 'Well, I was your little
[46:08] Sharon Rose on the earth,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; but daddy, there's no babies up here.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Don't you remember your teaching on
[46:15] immortality?
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's pretty powerful to me cuz
[46:20] that baby at 6 months old when she
[46:22] passed, had never heard William Brandon
[46:24] preach on immortality.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But she knew up in heaven his
[46:28] teaching on immortality was true
[46:31] &gt;&gt; because it didn't come from the earth.
[46:33] It came from the heavens.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; This message has been confirmed in
[46:38] heaven.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; This is heaven's message. It's not Amen.
[46:42] It's not man's message.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I think of the glory of it.
[46:46] Somebody said, "Well, there's no babies
[46:48] there." Yep. And there's no old age
[46:50] there either.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; There will be no old age in that place.
[46:54] Somebody said, "Well, how can you prove
[46:56] it?" Brother said he looked at them
[46:57] women said that was the most beautiful
[46:59] women and and and a voice said to him he
[47:01] said them women you think are so
[47:03] beautiful he said do you notice that one
[47:06] he said no I don't know who she is he
[47:08] said you led her to the Lord when she
[47:10] was 90 years old
[47:13] &gt;&gt; no wonder she's saying precious brother
[47:15] here in this dimension she's 90 years
[47:18] old at the end of her life if you gave
[47:21] her 10,000 years if you gave her 10,000
[47:24] there's going to come a last day to that
[47:27] 10,000 years. There's going to come a
[47:29] last moment and a person that's lived
[47:31] 10,000 years would give every dime they
[47:34] had to live another day. Amen. Because
[47:37] when it comes to the end, but there
[47:39] there will be no dying because there
[47:41] will be no old age. There will be no 90
[47:44] year old, no 80 year old. There will be
[47:47] perfect bodies. Oh, church of the living
[47:49] God, it's a reality that there is a
[47:52] body. Amen. Now, somebody said, "Well,
[47:54] Brother Wayne, I think when we get to
[47:55] heaven now, we're all just going to sit
[47:57] on these on these uh clouds and we're
[47:59] going to play our harps and we're going
[48:01] to play music and we're going to enjoy
[48:03] ourselves." And
[48:06] &gt;&gt; now watch, Brother Brand said, "That's a
[48:08] conception we used to have." Yeah,
[48:12] &gt;&gt; we used to have now that they had before
[48:15] the fullness of the word come into
[48:17] existence or the opening of the seven
[48:20] seals that's been promised to us in this
[48:22] age. Do you see? I believe heaven is a
[48:25] real place. Under the opening of the
[48:27] seals, he begins to declare heaven is a
[48:30] real place. This is not so sleeping.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Brother B says it. You're just as alive
[48:37] as you are right now, but greater in a
[48:40] more perfect life.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; I I love how Brother Bam says it. He
[48:44] says, "Your body's sleeping, but your
[48:45] soul ain't.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; It's not soul sleeping." Amen. It It's a
[48:51] It's a time, Brother Bam says it like
[48:52] here. We're not going to set up there
[48:54] for eternity on a cloud and just strum
[48:56] on our harps. Amen. But we're going to a
[48:59] real place. We're going to a real place.
[49:03] I tell you, heaven is a perfect place.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; My goodness, when when you start to
[49:09] think about heaven, how many ever just
[49:10] sits around once in a while just thinks
[49:12] about heaven?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; You know, you just think about it, you
[49:15] know,
[49:16] &gt;&gt; you think, how's it going to be? And
[49:17] what's everything going to be like? And
[49:19] now the Bible said, "Half hadn't yet
[49:21] been told."
[49:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Of the things prepared for you.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And you just, you know, you start
[49:26] thinking about heaven. And and one of
[49:28] the words that that that we have in
[49:30] English language that helps to describe
[49:32] heaven is perfect.
[49:34] And brother Ram uses this word when it
[49:36] comes to heaven. He's excused a lot.
[49:37] It's perfect. Amen. Meaning that there's
[49:40] no spots of imperfection. There's those
[49:43] things that rub you wrong or do Amen.
[49:45] Those little uh those little things that
[49:47] they just won't be there anymore. It's
[49:49] perfect. Brother Bam said, "A perfect
[49:51] heaven, a perfect God, a perfect savior,
[49:54] a perfect blood, a perfect atonement, a
[49:56] perfect being of you."
[49:59] &gt;&gt; All of those things that you hate about
[50:01] yourself, they won't be there.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; All those little things that just drive
[50:07] you crazy about yourself, they just
[50:10] won't be there.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; There'll be a perfect you.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; My goodness. I'll invite y'all over to
[50:16] see the perfect me.
[50:20] Amen. It's a perfect It's a perfect you.
[50:22] It's a perfect me. It's a perfect place.
[50:24] Brother Bam says it's a taking you from
[50:27] this pest house and putting you in my
[50:30] father's house.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; He said when you fell and you were born
[50:33] into this earth, you come into a pest
[50:35] house where all these things are. He
[50:37] said, "Oh, but God's going to take you
[50:39] from a pest house and put you in the
[50:41] father's house." Now, listen. I I I like
[50:43] to read the Bible. I like to read about
[50:45] heaven. Amen, brother Chris. They said
[50:47] heaven is a country. That's pretty big.
[50:50] It's a country. And and and and another
[50:52] person, they explain it as it's the four
[50:54] square city, the celestial city of God.
[50:57] It's a country. It's a city. Amen. One
[50:59] calls it Amen. a a civilization. Amen.
[51:03] They call it a kingdom. Amen. But I like
[51:05] how Jesus said it's my father's house
[51:07] because it's like going home. It's not
[51:10] visiting some foreign nation. It's not
[51:12] visiting some city where we're just
[51:15] going to be tourists. But we are
[51:17] citizens of this kingdom that we're
[51:19] going to. And we have a house there. My
[51:22] father has a house. Hallelujah. I won't
[51:26] be the strange one there. My beliefs
[51:29] won't be the strange ideas. These things
[51:32] that we hold so dear and seem so
[51:34] opposite to the world. They are the
[51:36] regular ideas of heaven.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; All of the women in heaven going to wear
[51:41] dresses and all of them will have long
[51:43] hair. And there won't be none of our
[51:45] sisters peered upon as if they're weird
[51:47] because they don't have 42 paintings and
[51:49] and five different tattoos and 16
[51:51] earrings. And
[51:56] &gt;&gt; look, I I'm sorry. I Me and Chrissya
[51:58] gets out once in a while and she loves
[51:59] to go shopping. I usually sit in the
[52:01] truck and but but once in a while once
[52:04] in a while I I I'll get up the nerve and
[52:06] I'll go right into the mall with her.
[52:08] And the funniest thing I ever see
[52:09] sometimes these these folks in the mall,
[52:12] you know, these these poor girls and
[52:13] they got and I'm not making fun of
[52:15] anything. I just want you to see
[52:16] something. They got pink hair and purple
[52:18] hair and and I I mean literally enough
[52:20] tattoos and and and and earrings just go
[52:23] all the way through and just I mean
[52:25] you're like, I can't believe that a
[52:27] human being takes that much time to get
[52:29] ready in the morning.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And I can see them turn and look at my
[52:34] wife as if she's something off of a
[52:40] Oh, if they could see me looking back,
[52:41] I'd be like,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; "She's got morals they don't know
[52:49] nothing about."
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Character
[52:53] &gt;&gt; standing there, a real lady,
[52:56] &gt;&gt; something that they can't even imagine
[52:58] being.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But think somehow it's weird.
[53:02] Amen. You you see the modern society of
[53:05] religion looks upon this little church
[53:07] like she's something strange somewhere
[53:09] but they don't Amen. If they could only
[53:11] see me looking back. She's got
[53:13] theological max factors. Brother B said
[53:16] her doors is the gates of hell. Amen.
[53:18] Amen. The sermons are nothing but a
[53:20] bunch of Hollywood hybridization of
[53:22] man's ideas with politics and demon
[53:25] power.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And they look at a pure word church as
[53:29] if there's something wrong with that
[53:31] church. That ain't nothing wrong with
[53:32] us, but we come from heaven and we're
[53:34] going back to heaven. And there's a
[53:36] reality to this word. We are sons and
[53:39] daughters of God. We are not weird
[53:42] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[53:48] It's a perfect place calling you. Amen.
[53:51] Just as an expectant mother, amen, is
[53:54] bringing forth life. So are you going
[53:56] into another place? Jesus is going
[53:59] ready. He's going to prepare a place for
[54:01] you. And it's a beautiful place.
[54:05] And it's a beautiful place, brother B.
[54:07] When he calls hope beyond the curtain of
[54:09] time. And when he calls hope back, you
[54:11] remember what she said? She said, "Be
[54:12] what' you call me back for?"
[54:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Call you back?" He said,
[54:16] "Yeah." She said, "I had just entered
[54:18] the most beautiful place."
[54:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to paraphrase. "The most
[54:21] beautiful place. Great big birds and
[54:23] beautiful trees and and and it was
[54:25] this." He said, "These white robed
[54:27] people had come to escort me into this
[54:30] place." And I when I heard that, I said,
[54:32] "Oh, thank the Lord. I don't have to
[54:37] cross Jordan alone."
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. To think about it. Amen. Amen. Do
[54:44] you all recognize when it comes your
[54:46] time, if you don't go in the rapture, if
[54:48] you do go in the rapture, they're going
[54:49] to come meet you.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; But if you pass from this life, God
[54:53] won't let you cross that Jordan. Amen. I
[54:55] imagine he'll send some of your buddies
[54:57] over to see you. Do you know there are
[54:59] record upon top of record of people that
[55:02] are leaving this dimension that stand up
[55:04] and start greeting people before they
[55:05] ever go? They start talking about seeing
[55:08] this one and that one and amen and
[55:09] coming back. Amen. What is it? You don't
[55:11] have to cross Jordan. There are people
[55:14] that you know that are still alive in
[55:17] another dimension and you can't see
[55:19] them. But the moment this veil of flesh
[55:21] is dropped, you will see them with your
[55:23] eyes.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Be to God. Amen. You'll talk
[55:27] about something wonderful. Brother Bam
[55:29] said, "Call you back from where?" She
[55:31] said, "Bill, I was in heaven."
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She said, "You preached
[55:37] about it, Bill."
[55:39] Oh, but you don't know.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; You preached about it, but you don't
[55:43] know. She said, "Bill, do you know where
[55:44] we made our mistake?" And he said,
[55:46] "Honey, I do. I know where we made our
[55:48] mistake." She said, "Bill, them people
[55:49] wasn't trash." She said, "You, my mama
[55:51] shouldn't have never called them trash,
[55:52] Bill." She said, "I know we never did."
[55:55] Amen. But she said, "Bill, you make me
[55:57] one promise." She said, "You preach this
[56:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost until death
[56:03] takes your time." And you raise my
[56:05] children like that. Now, this is coming
[56:07] from a woman that's went beyond and come
[56:09] back. And she knew there are religions
[56:12] to live by, but there are religions to
[56:14] die by. And not every religion man lives
[56:17] by is a religion you want to die by. But
[56:20] this Holy Ghost religion. It's Holy
[56:22] Ghost religion will hold. It'll hold all
[56:25] the way till you pass beyond the curtain
[56:27] of time. Oh, brother. Amen. When he got
[56:30] over there, you remember what he said to
[56:31] him, Bill. Amen. This is what you call
[56:34] the Holy Ghost.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; This promise. Amen. To preach this.
[56:40] Amen. I tell you this, because this Holy
[56:42] Ghost gospel, Amen. Amen. It means more.
[56:45] Do you know that your human life began
[56:48] in the womb of your mother
[56:50] &gt;&gt; before you ever came into the earth?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Life begins at conception.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know that before you get to
[56:59] heaven, you already have eternal life?
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know God gives a man
[57:05] eternal life before they go?
[57:08] Do you know the prophet said that our
[57:11] beloved Mary, who the Catholic Church
[57:13] loves so well, he says she couldn't even
[57:15] get into heaven until she staggered
[57:18] under the power of the Holy Ghost and
[57:20] become drunk before God would ever let
[57:22] her in heaven.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something that God commanded
[57:26] that a person receive the Holy Ghost
[57:29] before going into heaven? So, the
[57:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost is not just
[57:33] some emotion. It's not just something we
[57:36] can make fun of or act like there's
[57:38] nothing real about it. But the baptism
[57:40] of his spirit is the life of God coming
[57:44] not just on the spirit of a man, but in
[57:46] the soul of a man where life begins in
[57:49] the soul of a believer here before they
[57:51] ever go to heaven. I'll tell you this.
[57:54] Amen. I know that we were born in sin
[57:56] and we were shaped in iniquity. Amen.
[57:58] But God gave us grace this morning that
[58:00] we might be able, amen, to be able to
[58:03] switch that birth into a heavenly birth
[58:06] before we ever go there and become
[58:08] citizens. Now, the prophet, Amen, says
[58:11] something that's powerful to me. He said
[58:13] he's seen both places.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; I saw a vision of both places by the
[58:19] grace of God. It's, if I'm wrong,
[58:21] forgive me, but I believe I've been in
[58:23] both places. I've seen the redeemed.
[58:25] I've seen the blessed. I've seen the
[58:27] lost and I've seen where they're at. And
[58:29] that's why I stand, brother, today to
[58:31] warn you to flee from a downward path.
[58:33] Don't you never go down that road.
[58:36] That's right.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And you've got everything to live for.
[58:39] Blessed upward way. When the redeemed of
[58:41] joy and peace, they can't be sorry.
[58:43] There is nothing. They are perfect. Seen
[58:45] both places. And I know it's an awful
[58:47] statement for a person to make, but I
[58:49] believe I've seen both both places. Far
[58:53] be it from any person entering the
[58:55] region of the lost. If you're standing
[58:57] there with hot wires bored through you,
[58:59] tormented in every way, it'd not be like
[59:03] the devil torment that's in that place.
[59:05] There could be nothing. A human mind
[59:08] cannot comprehend what the region of the
[59:11] lost is. There's no way to explain this.
[59:13] There's no way to explain the regions of
[59:15] the blessed. It's so great and that's so
[59:18] horrible. It's from the ridiculous to
[59:21] the sublime. Don't you never go that
[59:25] way.
[59:26] Now, Brother Brandham says it. He said,
[59:28] "When I was in the realms of the loss, I
[59:30] screamed out and said, "Oh, God." He
[59:33] said, "Don't never let a person come
[59:36] here. You can't. There's no tongue to
[59:39] describe the horrors of it. There's no
[59:41] way for me to tell you. If you believe
[59:43] there's a burning hell full of fire and
[59:45] brimstone, that would be a cool shady
[59:48] green pasture to the side of what
[59:51] horrors of this lost condition and the
[59:54] misery that's associated in this place.
[59:57] When I was a little boy, that's when he
[59:59] fell in the vision of hell. Now, just
[1:00:01] for your uh studying, I want you to know
[1:00:03] that's when he was talking about when he
[1:00:04] he died on the table when he had been
[1:00:06] shot in the legs and descended into
[1:00:08] hell. And he said, "I cried, oh God." He
[1:00:10] said, "But there wasn't no God there."
[1:00:11] And he said, "I cried, oh mama, but
[1:00:14] there was no mama there." He said, he
[1:00:16] remember he said, and then he cried. And
[1:00:18] he said, I cried, but there was nothing
[1:00:20] there. And he said, I could not offer to
[1:00:22] God anything. I couldn't say that I had
[1:00:25] done this or this. He said, the only
[1:00:26] thing I could say is that I had never
[1:00:28] committed adultery. But see, there was
[1:00:31] no appeal before the throne of God that
[1:00:34] would set a man out of that region of
[1:00:36] the lost other than the blood of Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ. Oh, the precious blood of Jesus
[1:00:43] and it can do what nothing else is able
[1:00:46] to do. There is no religion, there is no
[1:00:50] church, there is no church annity, there
[1:00:52] is no memberships, there is nothing on
[1:00:54] this planet that can keep a man out of
[1:00:57] the region of the lost, outside of the
[1:01:00] blood of Jesus Christ. There is no other
[1:01:03] hope for the generation.
[1:01:05] Oh, that precious blood. My how it runs
[1:01:10] through my stream right this very
[1:01:12] moment. Oh, the blood, this rock I
[1:01:15] stand. There is nothing else. There is
[1:01:17] no other place of hope. There's nothing
[1:01:19] else for this lost generation. There's
[1:01:21] nothing else for humanity but the blood
[1:01:24] of Jesus Christ. No denomination can do
[1:01:26] it. No pope of Rome, no bishops, no
[1:01:29] hopes.
[1:01:32] Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:01:36] So, Brother Wayne, what are you talking
[1:01:38] about? Do you know Jesus saw what
[1:01:40] brother Ram said he saw?
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said from this dimension. He saw
[1:01:45] both places and he describes them before
[1:01:47] the blood. And he says that I saw he
[1:01:50] said I saw a rich man in hell lifted up
[1:01:53] his eyes and looked unto Abraham's bosom
[1:01:57] where the old poor Lazarus was in the
[1:01:59] bosom of Abraham and there was a gulf
[1:02:01] pitch between them and he said let I
[1:02:04] pray thee that Lazarus would come and
[1:02:06] put some some water on my lips but there
[1:02:08] was no way that they could pass in
[1:02:10] between those gulfs. Now now friends,
[1:02:13] brother Bam is very clear to help us in
[1:02:15] these things because that's before the
[1:02:17] blood.
[1:02:19] That's before the blood. So that was a
[1:02:22] place because man could not go into
[1:02:25] heaven. He was put in a place called
[1:02:27] paradise. Amen. But on the death barrel
[1:02:30] and resurrection of Jesus, he emptied
[1:02:32] out paradise and took these people into
[1:02:36] that new Jerusalem or that city of God.
[1:02:38] Amen. But now we find that Jesus, amen,
[1:02:41] visiting both of those place spoke of
[1:02:43] that rich young ruler and spoke of him
[1:02:45] as one, amen, that gained the world but
[1:02:49] lost his soul.
[1:02:52] See, what good is a man than if you gain
[1:02:55] the whole world
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; and lose your soul?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That soul that could live throughout
[1:03:05] eternity in perfection.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Or that soul that can torment in the
[1:03:10] regions of the lost for eons.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Now listen, there is a place for an
[1:03:16] unrepented sinner. There is a literal
[1:03:20] heaven. Yeah.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And there is a literal hell.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter 5, Paul says it. I
[1:03:28] I I like how he says it now in first
[1:03:31] verse. If we could read it. Be ye
[1:03:32] therefore followers of God as dear
[1:03:34] children and walk in love. And Christ
[1:03:36] also loved us and gave himself an
[1:03:38] offering for us as a sweet smelling
[1:03:40] savior. He said, "But fornication and
[1:03:42] uncleanness or covenantness, let it not
[1:03:45] be once named among you, has become a
[1:03:49] saints, neither filthiness, nor foolish
[1:03:52] talking, nor gesting, which are not
[1:03:55] convenient, but rather of giving thanks.
[1:03:57] For this you know that no whoreonger, no
[1:04:00] unclean person, no covetous man who is
[1:04:03] an adulterer have any inheritance
[1:04:07] in the in the kingdom of Christ and of
[1:04:10] God. Let no man deceive you, for because
[1:04:13] of these things cometh the wrath of God
[1:04:15] upon the children of disobedience. Be ye
[1:04:18] not partakers with them. Any man tells
[1:04:21] you, Amen, that it don't matter how you
[1:04:24] live, what you do, where you go, that
[1:04:26] man's lying to you.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; There'll come a day that sinners will
[1:04:31] turn over the ash heaps of hell, hunting
[1:04:34] that lying preacher that shook their
[1:04:36] hand and told them, "You're okay now,
[1:04:38] honey. Listen, you are not okay until
[1:04:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost seals that
[1:04:43] soul under the token of the word of
[1:04:46] life. Amen. Listen, I I know that
[1:04:48] somebody said, "Well, brother Wayne,
[1:04:49] this is a little rough." No, it amen. It
[1:04:51] ain't near as rough.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; It's not near as rough. In in Revelation
[1:04:57] 21 and 27, the Bible said, "There shall
[1:05:00] then no wise enter into anything
[1:05:03] that defileth it, neither whatsoever
[1:05:06] workketh abomination or maketh a lie,
[1:05:09] but they that which are written in the
[1:05:11] Lamb's book of life."
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch the scripture. In Revelation
[1:05:16] 21:7, it said, "He that overcometh shall
[1:05:18] inherit all things, and I will be his
[1:05:20] God, and he shall be my son. But the
[1:05:22] fearful, and the unbelieving, the
[1:05:24] abominable, the murderer, the hormonger,
[1:05:27] the sorcerer, the adulterer, and the
[1:05:29] liars shall have their part in the lake
[1:05:31] of fire, which burneth with fire and
[1:05:34] brimstone, which is the second death."
[1:05:38] Yeah.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Now the second death
[1:05:44] in Revelation 20 and verse 10, the Bible
[1:05:46] said, "And the devil deceived them that
[1:05:48] were cast into the lake of fire and
[1:05:49] brimstone, where the beast and the false
[1:05:52] prophet are, and shall be tormented day
[1:05:55] and night and forever. Death and hell
[1:06:00] follows after it."
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Do you see who's there? the devil,
[1:06:06] the beast, the f, the one that said
[1:06:09] William Brandon was wrong on that
[1:06:10] baptism.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; The one that said that that truth about
[1:06:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[1:06:18] eternal security when life comes on the
[1:06:20] soul, the ones that lied on that and
[1:06:22] said just sign here and become a member
[1:06:23] of our denomination and and if you'll
[1:06:25] accept our trinitarian our trinitarian
[1:06:27] doctrine, then then you can have it.
[1:06:29] See? Amen. But that was deceived. They
[1:06:32] deceived them and cast them into the
[1:06:34] lake of fire to be tormented day and
[1:06:36] night. And then there's a great white
[1:06:37] throne of judgment. But watch in the
[1:06:39] 14th verse. And the Bible said, "And
[1:06:41] death and hell were cast into the lake
[1:06:43] of fire." And this is the second death.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Death and hell and the false prophet and
[1:06:49] the devil. They're all going to be cast
[1:06:51] into the lake of fire. Listen, I'm glad
[1:06:53] to know today, amen, that there is a
[1:06:55] coming, an end to this devil. There is
[1:06:57] coming a death to this devil. Amen.
[1:07:00] That's what we believe. I believe there
[1:07:02] is a complete annihilation of the soul
[1:07:05] that sins. The soul that sinnth shall
[1:07:08] surely die. The soul now Satan must
[1:07:10] surely die to be completely destroyed.
[1:07:13] How I disagree with universalists that
[1:07:15] say Satan will be saved. He sinned and
[1:07:17] his soul sinned and his spirit shall be
[1:07:20] totally annihilated and there will be
[1:07:23] nothing left of him.
[1:07:27] Oh, devil, I hope you're listening to us
[1:07:29] this morning. You deceiver,
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; you demon that tries to deceive God's
[1:07:35] children, you are totally annihilated at
[1:07:39] the end of this thing. Listen, I take
[1:07:41] Thank God this morning there won't be no
[1:07:43] more devil. How could heaven be perfect
[1:07:46] and a devil be there?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, brother, I think
[1:07:51] there's an eternal hell." Now, let me
[1:07:53] just get down into some real reality
[1:07:55] just a moment. You know, Brother
[1:07:56] Brandham, the fifth seal divides the
[1:07:58] bride from Israel. Y'all know how he
[1:07:59] does it. He said they're crying how
[1:08:01] long? And they're looking for vengeance.
[1:08:04] He said that can't be the bride.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Listen at their cry. Vengeance. He said
[1:08:10] that can't be the bride.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; See, because in Revelation 21, it calls
[1:08:14] her the lamb's wife.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; She's the voice of mercy. She's the
[1:08:18] voice of grace.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You can't tell me that
[1:08:23] we're going to enjoy ourselves eternally
[1:08:26] and think of someone burning in a hell.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. How could we enjoy heaven and
[1:08:34] somebody burning in hell? Brother Rama
[1:08:36] actually says that. He said, "Did you
[1:08:38] see God completely does away with it? He
[1:08:41] completely does away with the memory of
[1:08:42] it and and takes the memory of the
[1:08:44] wicked and completely abolishes it so
[1:08:46] that there won't be any pull in your
[1:08:49] spirit throughout eternity." Amen. Just
[1:08:51] as we find the Bible said the soul that
[1:08:53] sinnth it shall surely die. Come on. We
[1:08:56] don't believe in eternal hell. But we do
[1:08:58] know there's eternal death
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says a woman that
[1:09:04] lives in pleasure is dead while she yet
[1:09:08] liveth.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Now folks, I this is this is just the
[1:09:14] plain gospel.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; You can live how you want to.
[1:09:20] Yeah.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; But the pleasure of sin is only for a
[1:09:24] season.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And the wages of sin is death.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching the scripture now.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And the soul that sinnth shall surely
[1:09:36] die. Amen. But but we find out God tells
[1:09:39] us that every one of us was born in
[1:09:42] death.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Come to this earth speaking lies. But
[1:09:47] Ephesians opens it up and says, "But God
[1:09:50] who is rich in mercy, while we were yet
[1:09:54] dead in our sins."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God that he came through the
[1:09:58] graveyard of Leodysia and woke me up.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Now, how did he wake you up? He preached
[1:10:04] this message over me and the light of
[1:10:07] the resurrection said, "Come out of that
[1:10:08] tomb of unbelief and sin and
[1:10:11] denomination and live, child. If you
[1:10:14] shall repent of your sins, you shall
[1:10:15] live." Amen. I'll tell you this. We
[1:10:18] won't have to die because we live. We
[1:10:20] live right now. We're alive right now.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Therefore, your name is in his thinking.
[1:10:27] Before there was a world began. Now, we
[1:10:30] were dead and we were separated. But the
[1:10:32] Bible said while we were yet in our
[1:10:34] sins, he quickened us and made us
[1:10:36] together with Christ. That way, grace
[1:10:38] you are saved. Do you know Romans 5
[1:10:40] teaches a beautiful sermon? And Paul
[1:10:42] says it. He says that. He says, "Listen,
[1:10:45] he died for us
[1:10:47] while we were yet sinners.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; We were dead.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; But he died for us."
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know he died for every person
[1:11:02] that will accept him?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; There is not one person that couldn't
[1:11:08] turn to Christ this morning and say, "I
[1:11:11] want to accept you." that he would turn
[1:11:12] away.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; He said he wouldn't. I will in no wise
[1:11:16] cast them out.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He died for us while we were yet
[1:11:20] ungodly.
[1:11:22] Now, this this is just simple gospel.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; We all sinned
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; and come short of the glory of God.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And without the blood of Christ, you
[1:11:33] would never reach it. Because the
[1:11:35] commandment over your life, Brother
[1:11:36] Mike, he said, "Be ye perfect even as my
[1:11:39] father in heaven is perfect." And there
[1:11:41] is no perfection that you can reach that
[1:11:44] without the blood of Jesus.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; You'll never reach that kind of
[1:11:47] perfection. That's why my Bible said God
[1:11:49] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:11:51] begotten son. Do you know in John
[1:11:53] chapter 5 and verse 24 it said he that
[1:11:55] believeth on me he says he has
[1:11:58] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:12:01] condemnation but has passed from death
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; unto life. All right.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:12:11] heaven is for the overcomer.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us in Hebrews, in
[1:12:17] Revelation chapter 2, that he that
[1:12:19] overcomemeth shall not be hurt
[1:12:23] by the second death.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Blessed is holy is he that hath part in
[1:12:27] the first resurrection. On such the
[1:12:30] second death hath no power.
[1:12:34] See, now you start getting a glimpse
[1:12:37] into Brother Bram's teachings on the
[1:12:40] realities of accepting God through the
[1:12:43] word.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Look at what he's starting to say
[1:12:46] because brother Bram goes in there and
[1:12:48] he tells us very clearly that a man that
[1:12:50] is born of God can no more die than God
[1:12:55] can die. Yeah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; If God has put life in you, you cannot
[1:13:00] die any more than God could die because
[1:13:03] the life is eternal life.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Now, sin has an end. Suffering has an
[1:13:08] end. Amen. But eternal life has no end.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; It's Zoey life.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; This service will have an end.
[1:13:24] It's Zoe life.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; See the life that has no end.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing but purity will be there.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; The life of God eternity for the ages
[1:13:37] and on and on. Do you see the overcomer?
[1:13:41] The overcomer will inherit all things.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; But brother, what does it mean to
[1:13:46] overcome? Brother Bam said it means to
[1:13:48] beat down.
[1:13:50] It means to handcuff.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; It means to It means to bind it. The
[1:13:56] thing that mastered you, you now master
[1:13:58] it.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; To overcome.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said the overcomers of the
[1:14:02] Leodysian age. What is it that they
[1:14:05] overcome? He says, do you see it? They
[1:14:08] overcome what? That nickel in spirit.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; They overcome the things of the world.
[1:14:13] They overcome these denominations. They
[1:14:15] overcome these priesthoods. They
[1:14:16] overcome everything the world and sells
[1:14:19] out to love Christ. So you'll not be
[1:14:21] hurt by the second death. He has got
[1:14:25] eternal life. Do you see? Amen. I I find
[1:14:30] a a great soulless in small statements
[1:14:34] because they sometimes they're the ones
[1:14:35] that really penetrate the heart.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Where John chapter 4, he said, "Ye are
[1:14:40] of God, little children."
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:44] see that you have overcome this world.
[1:14:47] And greater is he
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; that is in you than he that's in this
[1:14:54] world.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; The greater one is already on the
[1:14:57] inside. So your faith has raised up to
[1:14:59] conquer. You have already overcome.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; That's why you're sitting here this
[1:15:04] morning.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You had to be an overcomer. Even even to
[1:15:07] make it to this church, you had to
[1:15:09] overcome. Amen. That's right.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; To overcome means to stand the test.
[1:15:13] Every one of you's been tested. Every
[1:15:16] one of you's been pushed to your limits.
[1:15:18] But for some reason, we're still here.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Tested in every direction. But we
[1:15:24] overcome every test, every day, every
[1:15:28] morning. And you say, "Well, preacher,
[1:15:30] amen, I tell you what, I'm here." But
[1:15:32] see, we're not just here. We got life in
[1:15:35] us.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Because overcome means keep life in you.
[1:15:39] Listen, brothers. I believe we got life
[1:15:41] this morning because the word keeps
[1:15:43] pouring life in the church.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. To him that overcomemeth. Amen. He
[1:15:48] shall inherit all things. I'll tell you
[1:15:51] this. Amen. I I I I don't know. Amen.
[1:15:54] What would be greater than to hear the
[1:15:56] Lord say to you, "Enter in my good
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and faithful."
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful word, isn't it?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; My good and faithful.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. my good and faithful servant. Do
[1:16:11] you see? It was in that place, in that
[1:16:15] sixth dimension when brother Brandham
[1:16:16] went there. Now, we're not dealing with
[1:16:18] postmillennial at this time. It's in
[1:16:20] that dimension where brother Brandham
[1:16:22] went in
[1:16:24] and he said they were everyone
[1:16:27] in white robes.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And they he asked them where where did
[1:16:32] they get these white robes?
[1:16:36] And he said they got it by accepting
[1:16:40] the pardoning grace of the living word.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Now a church can give you a membership,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; but they can't give you a white robe.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; It's only the word that can give that
[1:16:55] robe.
[1:16:57] Do you see a place? Heaven is a real
[1:17:02] place, brother Kyle.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:05] It's worth compelling people to go.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; If if it if it if it wasn't if it wasn't
[1:17:12] knowing the horrors of hell and and the
[1:17:15] great and the great punishments that
[1:17:16] await that we would compel them out of
[1:17:19] it. Heaven is good enough to compel you
[1:17:22] to go by itself.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Heaven Heaven is the kind of place where
[1:17:28] every person wants to go.
[1:17:31] And you know the beauty of it. If you're
[1:17:32] if you're not on your way to you that's
[1:17:34] on your way this morning. Amen. I I
[1:17:36] think you ought to be I think you ought
[1:17:37] to feel pretty good about it.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; But if you ain't on your way this
[1:17:41] morning, I want you to know there's an
[1:17:43] invitation being given right now.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; There is an invitation to go to a place.
[1:17:48] The place that I'm going. You you know
[1:17:50] you know where I'm going. Brother Bam
[1:17:52] said I could say this. He said he said
[1:17:54] if there's one going,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; this is the way you believe it.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; I'm the one. Yeah.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; The place that I'm going, I just got to
[1:18:03] I just got to thinking on this. The
[1:18:05] place I'm going.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you where I'm going. I'm going
[1:18:09] to a place where there won't be any
[1:18:12] demons.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; And there won't be no devils.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; There won't be no Satan. There'll be no
[1:18:19] adversary,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; There'll be no sin.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; There'll be no unbelief there.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; there'll be a total annihilation of all
[1:18:30] darkness.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; There'll be no more sickness as a result
[1:18:34] of unbelief. Instead, there will be
[1:18:38] perfect bodies.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; No pains.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No Tylenol.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; No need for pain medication.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; There won't be no backachches. No ED
[1:18:55] trouble. Come on now. I'm talking about
[1:18:56] a real place.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; There is a place where the blind is
[1:19:01] going to see.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; there won't be no glasses or no contacts
[1:19:06] there.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; There will be no impaired visions. There
[1:19:10] will be no eye diseases to restrict you
[1:19:12] which you won't be able to see because
[1:19:14] brother Amen. Thank God that blindness
[1:19:17] is going to Amen. going to be taken away
[1:19:19] because there will be no eye disease to
[1:19:21] steal the sights that you're going to
[1:19:23] see. Thank God that the blind will see
[1:19:26] because look at what you'll be able to
[1:19:28] see once a man gets into heaven. I don't
[1:19:31] know about y'all, but sometimes I get up
[1:19:32] in the mornings and I walk by my flower
[1:19:34] garden and somehow when the when the sun
[1:19:36] hits those blooms, I I just can't hardly
[1:19:39] take the colors. I feel them. I don't
[1:19:41] know if you if I'm crazy. I may be
[1:19:42] crazy, but I I feel the colors when I
[1:19:46] stand up high peak out there in
[1:19:47] Colorado. Brother Jeremy knows my
[1:19:49] feeling. Amen. you're right there at the
[1:19:51] end of September and the golden aspen
[1:19:53] starts spreading out across and blending
[1:19:55] into those evergreens and the clarity
[1:19:57] and the sun starts hitting that and you
[1:19:59] can literally feel the brilliance of it
[1:20:01] and and it's just so magnitude and the
[1:20:04] fire of it and and you can just feel it
[1:20:06] and I think oh if we could see this in
[1:20:08] this dimension with the eyesight of
[1:20:10] heaven and and where there's no bugs
[1:20:12] there there's no there's nothing to
[1:20:14] destroy the shimmer of the aspen the
[1:20:16] deep green of the evergreen the giant
[1:20:18] oaks will grow air planted by the Lord's
[1:20:21] own hand will stand in glory. Birds will
[1:20:24] rest safely in the breaches thereof
[1:20:27] singing their songs. There'll be all
[1:20:29] kinds of song birds there. And just out
[1:20:32] of instinct, you won't have to pull out
[1:20:33] a book. You'll know every name.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You'll know every tune.
[1:20:38] Amen. You'll be able to identify every
[1:20:41] tune. I I I think uh Spencer, what's he
[1:20:44] about one? He's almost two now. We
[1:20:46] walked out by the house by the
[1:20:47] evergreens the other day. walked around
[1:20:48] the corner of the house and and a little
[1:20:50] uh dove was cooing over there. Coo coo.
[1:20:53] And he says, "It's an owl, papa."
[1:20:56] I said, "It's almost an owl, buddy. But
[1:20:58] that's a dove. That's the coup of the
[1:20:59] dove." Pretty good for a year old,
[1:21:00] though, I thought. Amen. It's a It's an
[1:21:02] owl, Papa. Amen. But I say this. Amen.
[1:21:05] Up there, we'll identify every bird in
[1:21:08] every song. You look and see the joy.
[1:21:11] See, you can see it now. You can see it
[1:21:13] without the obscurity of humanity.
[1:21:16] You'll see the joy of your brothers and
[1:21:18] your sisters on their face. That old
[1:21:19] saintly mother that struggled along and
[1:21:22] she struggled. You'll see her in her
[1:21:24] young body rejoicing in the grace of
[1:21:26] God. I tell you, I'm going to look for
[1:21:28] some of y'all.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I expect, Amen. Amen. To see
[1:21:33] the real you, that one. Amen. I don't

[1:21:37] but Sister Mary, she's a dancer in
[1:21:39] hiding back there. She I watch her.
[1:21:41] She'll pat that foot and hit that hand.
[1:21:43] I tell you what, you get her over there
[1:21:45] on that other realm in that new body and
[1:21:47] there won't be no holding that back no
[1:21:49] more. Amen. Because, Amen, there'll be a
[1:21:52] peace that'll come, a joy, amen, to
[1:21:54] every person. Amen. There it is. Amen.
[1:21:57] There'll be no feeble fathers and no
[1:21:58] weary friends.

[1:22:03] There'll be no old dad. Well, Jonathan,
[1:22:05] you won't help. You have to help your
[1:22:07] dad out of the car no more or up the
[1:22:09] steps. There'll be a new body there.
[1:22:11] Listen, I'm talking about the joys of
[1:22:14] why we do this day in and day out. Let's
[1:22:17] set the prize. Let's look at why why is
[1:22:19] it brother David drives all them hours
[1:22:21] and brother Brian all them years and
[1:22:23] Amen. hours and years of of service and
[1:22:26] faithfulness out of these people of God
[1:22:28] because there's a reward at the end of
[1:22:30] the road. There's a real body. There's
[1:22:33] not going to be any of this this this
[1:22:36] this thing that hinders that believer.

[1:22:41] young again. He'll be vibrant. Them old
[1:22:44] swooping shoulders will begin to stand
[1:22:46] tall. Time won't be wearing on those
[1:22:49] joints no more. My goodness. Sin won't
[1:22:52] be scarring the flesh. Amen. Do you know
[1:22:54] the only nail scarred body in heaven
[1:22:56] will be Jesus.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; You know the only scars in heaven
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; will be Jesus.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And those scars are left as a memorial
[1:23:04] that you'll know who died for you.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; This will not be a silent place. Let me
[1:23:10] tell you, this will be the noisiest
[1:23:11] place that you've ever been.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Heaven is going to be the happiest place
[1:23:16] that you've ever seen. Every deaf is
[1:23:18] going to hear. There will not be a
[1:23:20] hearing aid. There will not be an
[1:23:21] impaired Amen. Nobody having to say,
[1:23:23] "Huh?" It won't be nobody that cannot
[1:23:25] clearly hear. When we stand to our feet
[1:23:28] and begin to say, "Oh, hail King Jesus."
[1:23:31] And we crown him Lord of Lords. Our ears
[1:23:34] will hear the distinct cries. Oh, I
[1:23:38] believe God will give me hearing that
[1:23:39] I'll be able to individualize some of
[1:23:41] you and hear you. And when you say, "Oh,
[1:23:44] amen. Hell, the power of Jesus name."
[1:23:46] Amen. I'll see you, hear you, know that
[1:23:49] you made it to the other side. It won't
[1:23:51] be a silent place. Even the death is
[1:23:53] going to hear no herinade, no struggle,
[1:23:56] no Amen. No. You You'll be able to hear
[1:23:58] that singing bird all the way on the
[1:24:00] other side of the world. You'll be able
[1:24:02] to hear that bugle of that elk.
[1:24:06] Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; My
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; you ain't never been there. If you ain't
[1:24:11] never been there, you know,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; you ain't break the stillness of that
[1:24:15] morning. And
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; just something comes in you that there's
[1:24:19] a God out there somewhere.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, he calls in the voice of that L and
[1:24:24] and and you you you get on the other
[1:24:26] side. Amen. There he is. There's where
[1:24:30] that lion lays down. And you just walk
[1:24:32] over and pet him. Brother Guthrie,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; there won't be no trouble,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; but all the saints will be rejoicing.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Won't be any complexes to hold you back.
[1:24:42] There
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; won't be no condemnation on you.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; There won't be no distress or anxiety.
[1:24:48] There'll be no nerves to battle there.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; There'll be no weariness in your
[1:24:52] worship. There'll be no asthmetics there
[1:24:54] to keep you from running your race.
[1:24:56] There'll be no allergies.
[1:24:58] I'm talking about the heaven I'm going
[1:25:00] to. There won't be no coed to take your
[1:25:02] breath away.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; We'll stand right there and we'll see
[1:25:06] them and we'll hear them. Amen. And
[1:25:08] we'll take deep breaths with them.
[1:25:09] Brother Wayne Stevens and Brother
[1:25:11] Thompson, Brother Robert. They'll stand
[1:25:12] there breathing that perfect air. Amen.
[1:25:15] Singing and praising God. I can hear
[1:25:17] Brother Wayne catch out now. This is the
[1:25:20] breath in our lungs. Amen. Amen. To
[1:25:23] think, Amen. There won't be nothing
[1:25:25] there to steal their breath away. There
[1:25:27] won't be nothing there to rob it.
[1:25:31] That's right.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; No, it won't be there no more. Sister
[1:25:35] Liz won't have to sit down in the middle
[1:25:36] of the shopping trip no more. Not there.
[1:25:38] Amen. She won't have to worry about the
[1:25:40] pump and the medication. Not there.
[1:25:42] Amen. She can run out a 100 miles and
[1:25:45] turn and run back again. And she can
[1:25:47] say, "Look at me go, boys." Amen.
[1:25:49] There's nothing to rob my air no more.
[1:25:51] I'm talking about a complete healing of
[1:25:54] the body and the spirit and the soul.
[1:25:58] I know it's hard to see in this dark
[1:26:00] world, but it's perfect peace without an
[1:26:03] endless praise. There'll be no hurt
[1:26:05] there. There'll be no car wrecks.
[1:26:08] There'll be no midnight tragedies.
[1:26:09] There'll be no gunshots. There'll be no
[1:26:11] bad news. There'll be no knocks on the
[1:26:13] doors in the middle of the night. It
[1:26:15] just takes your breath away. There won't
[1:26:17] be no more news to come like that no
[1:26:19] more. No, sir. It's a place where a
[1:26:22] mother can rest.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know where you are,
[1:26:26] Sister Gail. Amen. But Sister Sarah
[1:26:28] won't be laying on that bed suffering.
[1:26:31] Amen. But you can lay down and sleep and
[1:26:33] know. Amen. There's a perfect body.
[1:26:35] There'll never be no poor pain there.
[1:26:37] There won't be no need for our nurses
[1:26:39] because all the pain will be gone.
[1:26:41] Victory will be total and eternal. Every
[1:26:44] one of you will be well. Every eye is
[1:26:47] seeing. Every ear is hearing. Every lame
[1:26:49] is going to walk. There won't be another
[1:26:51] funeral service. Amen. You know, when I
[1:26:54] think about this, I think every every
[1:26:57] lame is going to walk. I think about it,
[1:27:00] brother. I'm sorry, but I could just see
[1:27:01] Sister Mary Lewis. Amen. I I just
[1:27:04] Brother tapped me on the shoulder said,
[1:27:06] "Look, we're going, Brother Wayne, and
[1:27:07] see sister Mary Lewis cutting up the
[1:27:09] heel towards the throne of God." I tell
[1:27:11] you, Brother Jim, won't it be a day,
[1:27:14] Amen, when you see Brother Jim taking
[1:27:16] off and sprinting and saying, "Look at
[1:27:18] my new legs, folks." Amen. We did the
[1:27:20] best we could do here, but God had a new
[1:27:22] pair. The lame is going to walk. The
[1:27:24] blind is going to see. Amen. I'm not
[1:27:27] talking about a Pharisee. I'm talking
[1:27:29] about a reality of almighty God. There
[1:27:33] won't be no more weeper over wavered
[1:27:35] loved ones. There won't be no more alder
[1:27:37] calls cuz there's no sin there. There
[1:27:39] will be no disabilities, no hurts, no
[1:27:41] anger, no pain, no
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; to the known man, there's about 18,000
[1:27:47] different diseases. And all of those
[1:27:49] 18,000 diseases, there won't even be one
[1:27:53] there.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many disabilities known
[1:27:59] to man, but there won't even be one
[1:28:00] there.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; But King Jesus, he'll be there.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And brother, I'm going to be there. And
[1:28:09] I trust every person sitting in this
[1:28:11] building this morning's going to be
[1:28:13] there because we're not going in on our
[1:28:15] works. We're not going to get to the
[1:28:17] gate and say, "Lord, I was a good man or
[1:28:19] I was a good boy or I was a good church
[1:28:21] member." We're going to go up and say,
[1:28:23] "Lord, I accepted the pardon of your
[1:28:25] grace and I accepted your blood. I'm
[1:28:29] here because I was invited to be here."
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What an invitation this
[1:28:36] morning.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hey, I believe we got an invitation to
[1:28:40] come. And to him that wants to come can
[1:28:42] come freely. And there's nobody can turn
[1:28:44] you down. Stand to your feet with me
[1:28:45] this morning. It's a real place, folks.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Heaven
[1:28:53] is a real place.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; It's the place I'm going.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; It's the place I'm going.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:10] you're young in your body and you you
[1:29:12] don't have any sick friends or you're
[1:29:14] not taking care of anybody,
[1:29:17] it means something to you.
[1:29:20] But if you're in one of them families
[1:29:22] where you're daily working and helping
[1:29:24] and dealing with the disabilities and
[1:29:27] the inadequacies and the
[1:29:30] oh just one thought of it,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; just one thought that there's a place
[1:29:41] You know,
[1:29:43] this is the kind of destination
[1:29:47] that you don't get somewhere along the
[1:29:48] way and say, "Well, this would be nicer
[1:29:49] here."
[1:29:52] When they were moving west to California
[1:29:54] from the in the manifest destiny in the
[1:29:57] 17 1800s,
[1:29:59] they'd be going across there and
[1:30:02] take it to Ohio and say, "There's a
[1:30:03] better place in California. I'll just
[1:30:04] settle here."
[1:30:07] But as you journey to heaven, there
[1:30:08] won't be no place.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; There won't be no destination
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:15] that you're going to get to in this life
[1:30:16] to say, "This is better here."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Because Paul said it was far greater.
[1:30:23] That's a big word. It's far greater.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. I don't know
[1:30:31] what your heart is, but I know I'm
[1:30:33] going. How many say, "Brother Wayne, I'm
[1:30:36] going.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not going because I It's not It's
[1:30:40] not my merits."
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; I've accepted I've accepted the
[1:30:44] pardoning grace of this word.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go, brother Ben, if you
[1:30:49] would.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] I'm kind
[1:30:55] of home
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:31:00] sick
[1:31:02] for
[1:31:04] a country.
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:07] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:10] you which I never
[1:31:20] been
[1:31:22] before. Oh, thank you, Father.
[1:31:27] Oh, sad
[1:31:30] goodbye.
[1:31:36] till there
[1:31:38] is broken.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord
[1:31:45] for time won't matter
[1:31:54] in
[1:31:56] you.

[1:35:14] sweet you
[1:35:17] the land.

[1:36:13] I will take
[1:36:20] My heavenly
[1:36:23] light
[1:36:28] you
[1:36:36] longing
[1:36:38] for
[1:36:40] you

[1:36:45] And someday
[1:36:51] all the I'll stay

[1:37:17] you love
[1:37:24] sweet.
[1:37:29] You know, in preparing yesterday,
[1:37:33] I came across a song and I put it here
[1:37:36] in my notes on the number one song.
[1:37:41] It was Ba Land.
[1:37:44] The inspiration of the Lord just would
[1:37:46] pick it up and have brother Ben
[1:37:49] sang this song unprompted, untalked to.
[1:37:53] I got written here notes if you'd like
[1:37:54] to see it.
[1:37:57] It's just wonderful.
[1:37:59] There's somebody orchestrating
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; our lives.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; This moment is prepared.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; There's a real heaven.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That atmosphere that's coming in here
[1:38:17] now. That's a
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; That's where a prophet said that God had
[1:38:20] expanded heaven.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; That it might be for our redemption so
[1:38:25] we could actually step into that realm.
[1:38:28] of heaven before we ever get there to
[1:38:31] feel his feelings to to see his graces.
[1:38:34] And I'll tell you this morning as we bow
[1:38:37] our hearts, I
[1:38:39] maybe maybe there's something going on
[1:38:41] in your life this morning that
[1:38:44] but in the view of what you're looking
[1:38:46] at and with heaven in front of you,
[1:38:49] you'd like to just set some of the
[1:38:51] baggage down and say, "Lord, I've let
[1:38:53] too many things get too important,
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; but this is the important thing, Lord.
[1:38:59] This is this is the important thing.
[1:39:01] This is what I want to set my heart on.
[1:39:04] As we bow our heart this morning, hands
[1:39:07] going up across the building, I want to
[1:39:10] I want to pray with you. If somebody
[1:39:12] don't know the Lord Jesus,
[1:39:15] I want you this morning to accept him.
[1:39:16] Say, Lord, come into my heart right now,
[1:39:20] Lord. Make that my home, too.
[1:39:24] Father God, we bow our hearts today,
[1:39:27] Lord, knowing that you're a merciful
[1:39:29] God.
[1:39:31] this inspiration that just struck our
[1:39:33] hearts. Lord, I
[1:39:36] I recognize, Lord, that you're speaking
[1:39:38] to someone. You're speaking to even
[1:39:41] hearts across the room, Lord, to
[1:39:43] refocus,
[1:39:45] to reset our affections.
[1:39:47] And Lord, that's what we want to do. We
[1:39:50] We want to lay aside every weight, Lord.
[1:39:53] That we'll be able to run this race with
[1:39:55] our patience, Lord. That not just
[1:39:58] beginning, but we want to finish it,
[1:39:59] Lord.
[1:40:01] And we ask you this morning as we Lord,
[1:40:04] maybe some across the room say they just
[1:40:06] need to ask your forgiveness, Lord.
[1:40:10] Maybe there's things that begin to enter
[1:40:12] lives and entertainments and worldlyism
[1:40:15] and things that just begin to draw the
[1:40:17] attention
[1:40:18] causing numbness and coldness to enter
[1:40:21] their lives. Lord, I I pray that they
[1:40:23] take it out of first place this morning.
[1:40:25] Lord, they remember why you've called
[1:40:28] them. remember why they come to the
[1:40:30] house of the Lord and why this message
[1:40:32] is so real to them. Lord, I pray,
[1:40:35] Father, whatever has staggered them,
[1:40:37] that they would be rejuvenated this
[1:40:38] morning, refilled of your spirit. Lord,
[1:40:41] if there's one don't know you, I pray
[1:40:43] right now that you would just give them
[1:40:44] that grace to open their hearts that
[1:40:47] they'd be able to see them. Lord, as we
[1:40:49] baptize these young people this morning,
[1:40:51] Lord, Father, we believe it's a great
[1:40:54] symbol, a great outward expression of
[1:40:56] something you're doing. And I pray,
[1:40:58] Father, that it that Lord, it would have
[1:41:01] eternal significance this morning,
[1:41:03] Father. Lord, we want to thank you for
[1:41:05] your grace now as we ask these things in
[1:41:09] Jesus name.
[1:41:11] Amen and amen. And as brother Ben's
[1:41:14] going to lead us in a few songs, we're
[1:41:16] going to have a baptism. So, I'm just
[1:41:17] going to go back if you deacons would
[1:41:19] prepare things. Amen. God bless you,
[1:41:21] friends. We love you.
