this woman to be married to this man amen congregation may be seated we appreciate everybody coming and being a witness of this great event in this couple's life they're turning the corner both of them not only in their natural life their christian life and so we thank god how he orchestrates marriage and how he orchestrates a couple coming together many times of different maybe nationalities or whatever it might be different walks of life different situations in their lives but today i can as a pastor as a minister of the gospel i can say with all my heart that i'm uniting a man and a woman that both have the holy ghost and both have the word of god as their absolute and so we appreciate that we can uh marry them with confidence that this marriage will hold because they will be searching the word for answers and their livelihood and their leading and their guiding so we thank god brother john david sister hannah we thank god for both of you and we thank god for all the friends you have all the brothers and sisters in christ all the beautiful family i see some from out of state i i heard way away from idaho i believe are utah there's come to be a blessing in this marriage in a believer's life it's already pre-planned by an almighty god that they serve and so he already knew the end from the beginning he knew that these two would eventually meet and they would fall in love but that's just a part of filial love but in this love is more than just feel your love feel your love can come and it can go it can compromise it can give up it doesn't sometimes feel your love does not make a commitment but because these two are believers in jesus christ that is the same yesterday today and forever that they can put their lives into the promised word of god and live by thus saith the lord not by all the emotions not by their own thinking or reasoning but taking it back to the bible in the message of the hour and getting an answer i want to say to you both life is not a dream marriage is not a dream but it's a reality it's a reality of growing together in the love of christ and believe me i know your trust in the living god so we appreciate that so much today your love that you have for each other and the love you have for christ nothing will separate you nothing will separate you at all this marriage i believe was orchestrated before the foundation of the world amen no man put it together no man can take it down because jesus christ is here in our midst his presence is with us today that you can take these vows that you're going to exchange and knowing that you mean it from your heart and you'll stand by them through sickness through death through riches through poor you will stay together in the love of jesus christ i say to you to these people that are here as witnesses that your prayers be greatly appreciated for these two people that are no longer going to become rb2 but to be joined as one no marriage would be a complete without reading a scripture which is very familiar to us wives submit yourselves onto your own husbands is unto the lord for the husband is the head of wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore the church is subject under christ so let the wise be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for him that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy without blemish so on men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever hated yet hated his own flesh but nourished it and cherished it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones with his cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let everyone in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband i know in many of the marriages that i perform i read this quote from the kinsmen redeemer those that are familiar with the message because i think it's so fitting hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will be will end love never did begin and it'll never end it was always eternal amen and when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's pretty there'll be an end to that but when the man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds a man she loves no matter what he looks like like he loves her she loves him that's eternal made in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and they stepped out into a space of time and will return back to eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time then goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish another quote but the man makes it so clear that outside of salvation there couldn't be a greater gift than a godly wife so brother john david you're getting a godly wife she said under my ministry i think for 12 years i've seen her character i've seen her life dedicated to people she'll dedicate her life to you brother john brother john you're a real man of god you may not speak loudly but your life is what counts so i want to say to you god loves you god cares for you and he'll make it all work for his glory so we see here another quote notice there is nothing that god could give a man outside of salvation better than a nice wife there is no man that can console a person when they're tired they won't confine anyone like they do their own wife what a fortunate thing your brothers are when you've got a nice little wife that's clean and upright and moral and you can come in when you're tired and weary and sit down and she can talk to you she can do more for you than anybody else that's right she's your jewel she is your queen we thank god we thank god for both you and we love you in the lord jesus and we know that eternity will spell this all out one day how this really came about amen [Music] it was a day in early springtime [Music] to rest his camel train he had found a bride for isaac near the evening shadows fell for his weary journey had not been in vain [Music] loved her isaac and he loved rebecca fair oh it must have been a happy wedding day [Music] don't you hear the aliens [Music] comes in the blessed holy spirit through the prophets has come down to earth [Music] is [Music] we shall [Music] that will be [Music] [Applause] [Music] call [Music] train comes in [Music] hey before i go into the wedding vows and exchanging the rings sister hannah wanted me to read what brother bannon spoke in one of his marriage ceremonies we are gathered here together in the sight of god in the face of this company to join together this man and woman in holy matrimony which is commanded by saint paul to be honorable among all men it is therefore not by any to be entered into in advan inadvisedly or lightly but reverently disgracefully soberly and in the fear of god into this holy state these two persons present come to be joined i will require and will charge you both as you will surely answer the day of judgment when the secret of all hearts shall be disclosed if there is either of you that know of any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this holy do you now confess it for be it assured unto you that any couples that are joined otherwise then god's word doth allow their marriage is not lawful but duly believing you have considered this solemn obligation you're about to assume that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently discreetly soberly in
