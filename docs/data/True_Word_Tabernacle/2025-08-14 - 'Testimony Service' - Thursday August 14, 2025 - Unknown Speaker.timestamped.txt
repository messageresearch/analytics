[28:39] Sister Laura is going to testify
[28:40] tonight. Let's
[28:44] &gt;&gt; um two weeks before camp, I was in the
[28:48] hospital short of breath, sharp pain in
[28:51] my lungs, and I was diagnosed with pury,
[28:54] which is inflammation of the lining of
[28:56] the lungs, and they also said I had
[28:58] fluid in the sack around my heart.
[29:01] Starting in January, I could do what uh
[29:04] Brother Andrew said we shouldn't do,
[29:05] which is make a laundry list of
[29:07] everything that was wrong with me. My
[29:09] body has been fighting a lot this year
[29:12] and a lot of loss,
[29:15] but I just decided to just keep looking
[29:17] towards the healing.
[29:20] And I went to camp knowing that I was
[29:22] going to receive something special. And
[29:25] God verified it through Katie when she
[29:27] went up for prayer on Thursday. And I
[29:30] went through the prayer line and God
[29:31] touched me.
[29:34] But when I went back to my seat
[29:37] and brother Ben started singing, "It's
[29:39] your breath in our lungs." God said,
[29:40] "Your healing is coming now."
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; And his holy spirit just swept through
[29:46] the building at that moment. And you
[29:49] know how it is. You can't make that
[29:51] scream of that blessing up. And I'm
[29:54] telling you all the pain that I'd had in
[29:56] my lungs that had me sleeping in the
[29:58] recliner. It was so lovely to be able to
[30:01] lay down and sleep in my bed. And then
[30:04] Sunday morning, I went up for prayer
[30:06] that all the appointments that I have
[30:08] with specialist coming up would all just
[30:10] be testimonies of his goodness.
[30:15] And I had an appointment on Tuesday with
[30:18] the hematologist because my blood,
[30:21] y'all,
[30:23] it's it's been wacky all over the place.
[30:26] Um, lots and lots of testing, but long
[30:29] story short, well, it's too late for
[30:31] that. I'm sorry.
[30:33] His
[30:36] name was Hassan Aada
[30:38] and we sat and he was in my room for a
[30:42] long time taking lots of notes and um
[30:47] I just felt pressed to tell him I'm
[30:49] healed and I told him we had meetings
[30:53] and I know God touched me and the words
[30:55] that came out of his mouth were faith is
[30:58] such an important part of healing
[31:03] &gt;&gt; and he didn't discount it and we sat
[31:05] there and we talked about the things of
[31:06] the Lord and I was just so grateful
[31:08] because that was my specific prayer is
[31:11] that would be testifying of his goodness
[31:13] and just believe with me as I go through
[31:16] these other appointments coming up that
[31:18] it would all be glory to God that I'm
[31:21] completely healed in my body.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; It's your prayer
[31:29] in our love so we pour out. So we pour
[31:34] out our praise. Hallelujah.
[31:39] It's your bread in our love.
[31:44] Hallelujah.
[31:45] So we pour out our praise. We pour out
[31:51] our praise. It's your praise in our
[31:54] love.
[31:57] Oh, so we pour our praise to you all.
[32:04] [Music]
[32:04] [Applause]
[32:07] Oh, great
[32:11] are you.
[32:14] [Music]
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Mighty are thy works, oh God.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going to have a
[32:22] testimony service tonight.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; All right. And uh two of my favorite uh
[32:28] uh traditions, if we could use the word,
[32:29] that we've we've sort of established
[32:32] along with our youth camp. One is the
[32:34] prayer service that we have with the
[32:36] young people before camp.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; The other one is the testimony service
[32:39] we have after camp.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; They both uh they both uh lend so much
[32:43] to the weekend itself. Maybe we'd like
[32:45] to stand for a scripture reading just
[32:48] before we say a few words of thanks and
[32:51] then go right to the testimonies.
[32:54] in Deuteronomy chapter 6 ju just read uh
[32:58] in verses 4
[33:01] uh down a little bit and
[33:04] I know that I've
[33:06] shared this with the church sometime
[33:08] before uh this is something that struck
[33:11] my heart a little earlier this year.
[33:16] Now, this is just after the ten
[33:17] commandments have been delivered.
[33:19] And so, the uh you know, the law of the
[33:22] Lord has been put in the hands of the
[33:24] people. And so, it's a it's a
[33:27] dispensational change. It's a prophetic
[33:29] ministry uh turning of the corner for
[33:32] God's elect.
[33:34] And this is how they're instructed to
[33:37] respond
[33:38] here. Oh Israel, the Lord our God is one
[33:42] Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy
[33:45] God with all thine heart, with all thy
[33:48] soul, and with all thy might.
[33:51] And watch this. And these words, which I
[33:53] command thee this day, shall be in your
[33:56] heart, and you shall teach them
[33:59] diligently unto thy children. shall talk
[34:02] of them when thou sitest in thine house,
[34:04] and when thou walst by the way, when
[34:06] thou liest down, and when thou riseest
[34:09] up. I know that people uh uh that that
[34:12] sometimes people look at youth ministry
[34:14] as something that's secondary in the
[34:16] church or optional or or uh you know,
[34:20] something that's a lower priority. But
[34:23] but God uh in this in this changing of
[34:27] dispensation is instructing the people
[34:29] in the same breath that he tells you to
[34:31] take the word of God and hide it in your
[34:33] heart and make it a part of your daily
[34:35] living and your daily communication.
[34:37] He's also instructing it to teach us
[34:39] teach it diligently to our children and
[34:41] establish them in the way. And so we
[34:43] appreciate all those who have supported
[34:45] in in in every different way uh to make
[34:48] our youth camp possible. Uh because
[34:50] that's the burden behind it
[34:52] &gt;&gt; is to give uh is to not not let the not
[34:55] let the message you know uh decline into
[34:59] dead traditions and
[35:01] &gt;&gt; you know just carry on on the inertia of
[35:03] ritual and
[35:05] &gt;&gt; you know and and family legacies but to
[35:07] give a new generation their own chance
[35:09] at a revival. And every fresh and true
[35:12] revival comes from one source. That's
[35:14] back to the word for your day.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what we want to do
[35:18] is lift up the message not as a dead
[35:20] letter. Amen. But as a quickened spirit,
[35:22] a revealed Christ. And and uh so many
[35:25] have got behind it. Amen. Just to make
[35:27] it possible. So we want to thank you
[35:29] all. You could be seated. Just want to
[35:31] make a few words of thanks. I just uh
[35:34] you know, we really ought to spend an
[35:36] hour thanking everybody. uh a piece, you
[35:41] know, for the labor that's gone in, but
[35:43] we just run through uh some of the
[35:45] things and I and certainly I'll leave
[35:47] people out, but uh we just want to we
[35:50] want to thank all the workers uh the
[35:52] staff members and everybody that has
[35:54] just uh just uh it's unbelievable the
[35:57] amount of labor that goes into a
[35:59] weekend. Uh, but Sister Tara, Brother
[36:01] Richard, the McNelte family, and all
[36:03] those that would work with them. We
[36:05] appreciate our singers and our musicians
[36:07] that played and played to keep an
[36:09] atmosphere. Uh, Brother Ben and his his
[36:12] group, his team, the, you know, the
[36:14] medical staff. We kept them busy once
[36:16] again. Sister Lily and brother Chris
[36:18] helping her. And, uh, you know, uh, we
[36:21] sure thank God for that coffee.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; That really keeps uh, that keeps
[36:25] everyone going through the weekend. And
[36:27] it sure meant a lot, you know, to have
[36:29] brother Nathan's sister Natalie uh you
[36:31] know, uh just just starting up a
[36:33] fledgling business there to close down
[36:35] their personal business for a whole
[36:37] weekend to serve God's people is really
[36:39] an amazing gesture and we appreciate
[36:41] that. I appreciate all the dorm leaders
[36:43] who, you know, uh dorm leading isn't
[36:46] just uh it's not just staying up late
[36:48] and having fun with the kids. There's a
[36:49] lot of there's a lot of little
[36:50] situations, a lot of little sometimes
[36:53] sensitive or or or situations or a
[36:56] little bit of drama that rises up and
[36:58] it's just amazing how the Lord uses
[37:00] those dorm leaders to keep the testimony
[37:02] of the camp clean to protect everybody's
[37:04] experience and they just uh you know
[37:06] they they make a real sacrifice to be
[37:08] part of it and there and it's it's
[37:10] really incredible uh you know the effect
[37:12] that they have in lives and you know I I
[37:15] I don't know that I uh have forgotten a
[37:18] single dorm leader I ever had in all my
[37:20] years going to youth camp. They just
[37:22] make a mark on your life. And we thank
[37:24] the night guards uh gave up their sleep
[37:26] for the weekend. Just keep things
[37:28] orderly. And so uh and and certainly
[37:31] many that I forgot. Brother Matt
[37:32] Mccclard and running all those
[37:34] activities and things that our young
[37:35] people could have a good time because
[37:36] sure we sure believe in young people
[37:38] having a good time.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; So we just want to we just want to just
[37:42] lump them all into a big group and just
[37:44] give them a round of applause tonight
[37:46] and show our appreciation.
[37:48] acts of service.
[37:51] [Applause]
[37:54] Amen. We're so thankful for what God has
[37:58] provided. You know, and what would mean
[38:00] more uh than that, what I would
[38:02] appreciate is if everybody in this
[38:03] building, especially the young people,
[38:05] would go seek seek some of these people
[38:07] out. If you saw somebody working on the
[38:09] grounds and go tell them thank you
[38:11] personally face to face for the
[38:13] sacrifice that that was made. And you
[38:15] know, if they uh if they're in one of
[38:17] these rolls that that we've mentioned or
[38:19] but if it's somebody who you know,
[38:21] picked up some trash or cleaned a toilet
[38:23] or changed out, you know, some paper
[38:25] towels or something like that, tell them
[38:26] thank you twice because, you know, all
[38:29] that stuff needs to be done. And we
[38:31] appreciate those that don't despise the
[38:32] little things, but just looking for some
[38:34] way, just some way just shows what's in
[38:36] the heart, some way to be a part of what
[38:39] God is doing and and to just put up
[38:41] stock in these testimonies that are
[38:43] going to come forth tonight. Amen. So,
[38:44] we appreciate you all and I'd like to
[38:47] especially say that I'm so thankful for
[38:50] the the youth of True Word Tabernacle
[38:53] &gt;&gt; and I, you know, I'm just so proud,
[38:59] so proud of these young people, their
[39:02] testimony, you know, their their
[39:04] influence. And isn't it amazing that we
[39:06] could invite young people from all over
[39:09] the world,
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. other countries and everything all
[39:11] across the United States from many many
[39:14] many different churches uh actually 66
[39:16] or more churches represented at the
[39:18] youth camp
[39:19] &gt;&gt; and not have our young people take a
[39:21] backseat to any of them in their
[39:22] testimony and their character uh just in
[39:25] their witness you know it's it's not
[39:28] hard to see what God has done in this
[39:31] youth group and and uh the sincerity
[39:33] comes through the character the loyalty
[39:35] you know they're invested in this youth
[39:37] camp and it makes a difference and and I
[39:39] I appreciate them. I want Amish to know
[39:41] that uh that that somebody's
[39:43] appreciating uh their overcoming life
[39:47] and uh and just grateful for them and
[39:49] what the Lord has done. And also, I'd
[39:51] like to thank our pastor, Brother Wayne.
[39:53] You know, none of this would be possible
[39:55] without the church getting behind this
[39:57] youth camp in a great way.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm sure that there's nobody in my
[40:02] position directing a youth camp that's
[40:04] given as much liberty as I am. And
[40:06] that's not lost on me. I appreciate that
[40:09] very much.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; And uh and you know that the church puts
[40:12] a lot financially behind making the camp
[40:14] possible uh believing in the vision and
[40:17] the and the return. And so uh I just
[40:20] appreciate the support, brother Wayne.
[40:22] It's a dream come true uh for us all to
[40:24] be able to do this. And we want to we
[40:26] want to thank God for the ministry.
[40:28] Brother Andrew Glover, Brother Josh
[40:30] Bennett.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; What what a wonderful word that we heard
[40:34] over the weekend. You know, it it just
[40:36] was uh it was just good, solid, clean
[40:40] preaching of the message of the hour.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. With the dynamics behind it, you
[40:44] could see the effect in the young
[40:45] people. You know, as the young people
[40:47] were coming through that prayer line, I
[40:49] was just I was marveling and noticing
[40:51] what a good, clean, solid faith
[40:55] &gt;&gt; that you could sense in the hearts of
[40:56] the young people. Just standing on the
[40:58] word of God, believing in his word. No
[41:00] sensationalism in it. just a sincere
[41:03] strong faith by the preaching of the
[41:05] word that that only comes by hearing.
[41:07] Amen. And only if you're hearing the
[41:08] revealed word of the hour. Amen. It
[41:10] produces life. It produces power. Amen.
[41:13] It it puts a key in your hands.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It can bind and it can loose. And
[41:18] so we just thank the Lord, you know, for
[41:20] for for preaching a word that would help
[41:22] our young people.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And once again, being such a
[41:24] blessing. Amen. You know, uh we're here
[41:27] to testify of what the Lord has done.
[41:30] It's been uh several days since camp
[41:32] ended. And so there's been plenty of
[41:34] time for everyone that had a camp
[41:35] testimony to be attacked by the enemy to
[41:40] maybe stumble and fall and maybe uh you
[41:43] know to to to hear Satan's lies to have
[41:46] a mind battle to go through all of those
[41:48] things.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; You know that's just a normal part of
[41:50] the experience.
[41:52] Jesus himself, brother Brandham talked
[41:54] about right after he was baptized, he
[41:56] went out into the wilderness to be
[41:58] tempted of the spirit. He said that's
[42:00] just the way it happens. When you get
[42:01] the Holy Ghost, the first thing the
[42:04] devil comes right along for temptations
[42:06] when you claim your healing, watch the
[42:08] devil come right along to back her up
[42:10] and say that it's wrong. Brother Bram
[42:12] said that's the time to stand
[42:14] &gt;&gt; because you don't testify of what you
[42:17] see or feel. You testify of what you
[42:19] believe.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. and stay with it. Another
[42:22] time, Brother Bram said, "But you see,
[42:24] but you look at your symptom. You look
[42:26] at your symptoms, say, "Well, look here.
[42:28] I was prayed for maybe for a crippled
[42:29] hand, and my hand is no better." Brother
[42:32] Bam said, "That's no sign that you're
[42:33] not healed."
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God said so. That's it. No
[42:37] matter what that hand takes place, it's
[42:39] what God said. It ain't from my hand.
[42:41] It's what God said. He said, "I accepted
[42:43] it and I'll stay with it and that's
[42:45] all." And he said, "Now, he could open
[42:47] it up. He today, tomorrow might be 25
[42:50] years, but you let your testimony be
[42:52] positive. He said every time you get
[42:54] sick and you were prayed for and you go
[42:56] out and get a little sick, you say,
[42:57] "Well, I guess I lost my healing."
[42:59] Brother Bram said, "Then your testimony
[43:01] becomes negative and Jesus can't say no
[43:03] more for you because he's the high
[43:05] priest of your confession." Amen. As was
[43:08] preached over the weekend, he's sitting
[43:10] there making intercessions on your
[43:12] confession, what you believe. Amen.
[43:15] Amen. So, we're here just to give the
[43:16] devil a black eye. Amen. And to show
[43:18] that, hey, you know, no matter what I've
[43:20] been going through this week, I'm going
[43:21] to stand, Amen. on what God revealed to
[43:24] me at camp. I'm going to stand on the
[43:26] word of God and I'm going to testify of
[43:27] my healing, testify of my experience,
[43:29] testify of my deliverance. Amen. I'm
[43:32] going to make a positive confession. I'm
[43:33] going to carry that positive confession
[43:35] to the finished result. Amen. Because
[43:37] he's the high priest of my profession. I
[43:40] like what the what brother Brandham told
[43:42] John Ryan, I believe it was, that came
[43:44] in the prayer line because he was blind.
[43:46] Brother Brandham prayed for him that he
[43:47] would and told him he would have his
[43:48] sight. He came back around the line. He
[43:50] said, "Well, Brother Brandham, I can't
[43:52] see." He said, "Well, what does that
[43:53] have to do with it?" He said, "But you
[43:56] said I'm healed." He said, "You are
[43:58] healed." Amen. You said you believed.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Now, but he and so he
[44:03] sent him away with a positive
[44:04] confession." I like what he told him. He
[44:06] said, "Give the angel of the Lord a
[44:07] chance.
[44:09] give the angel of the Lord a chance.
[44:11] That's what you find, you know, a young
[44:12] person gets the baptism of the Holy
[44:14] Ghost where they stumble many times is
[44:16] they, you know, they they get a really
[44:18] experience with God in a meeting like
[44:19] we've had and they go home and then the
[44:21] first sign of trouble they be the devil
[44:23] comes and attacks that with doubt and
[44:25] makes you doubt your experience. Amen. I
[44:28] like the quote brother Caleb shared with
[44:30] some of the ministry today about Moses.
[44:33] how Moses after he'd stood on that
[44:35] sacred sands, after he met that pillar
[44:37] of fire face to face. Amen. When he
[44:40] walked away from the bush, the fire left
[44:42] the bush because the fire came from that
[44:44] bush and came into Moses and went with
[44:46] him. So, you know, when you run up
[44:48] against a red sea, you don't have to go
[44:49] running back to the burning bush. Amen.
[44:51] Because the fire that was burning in the
[44:53] bush, Amen. is identifying itself above
[44:56] you, Amen. looking at your obstacle,
[44:58] Brother Bam said, with angry eyes. Amen.
[45:00] To to take you forward. Amen. You know,
[45:02] and that's the thing it is. If you got
[45:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the first
[45:06] time you get into trouble, you don't
[45:07] have to run back to youth camp.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You stand on your experience.
[45:11] Amen. And profess, amen, that that the
[45:14] Holy Ghost came upon me and he said
[45:15] he'll never leave me. He said he'll
[45:17] never forsake me, but he'll be with me
[45:19] even in me to the end of the age. So,
[45:21] how many got a testimony tonight? Amen.
[45:24] We we uh we we we just want to give uh
[45:27] time uh whatever it takes. We we can't
[45:30] go all night, but we'll give a good
[45:31] amount of time here uh for testimony. Uh
[45:35] we'll just uh just a couple points of
[45:36] order. We appreciate as you testify, if
[45:39] you try to keep it brief, uh that sure
[45:41] helps. You know, I know it's hard to get
[45:43] our thoughts together sometime, but you
[45:45] know, the main thing of a testimony is
[45:47] give give God the glory. And that
[45:49] doesn't mean we need all the details.
[45:51] And and even things if they feel
[45:53] personal to you, there's no obligation
[45:54] to share because it's a testimony, not a
[45:56] not a confessional. Amen. Amen. But as
[45:59] far as you as far as you feel to share,
[46:01] amen, we're just behind you. Amen. We we
[46:03] we we support it. We just want to give
[46:06] God the glory. Even if it's, hey, I
[46:08] showed up to camp sick and I left
[46:10] healed. That's a complete testimony.
[46:12] Amen. You say, I showed up bound, but I
[46:14] left delivered. That's a complete
[46:15] testimony. Amen. That's all that's all
[46:18] there really is to a testimony. And so,
[46:20] we'll just uh we'll ask as best you can
[46:22] uh keep that brief and uh recognizing
[46:25] the struggle. Amen.
[46:28] Amen. If it gets going on, just tell
[46:30] everybody you're closing.
[46:34] And uh and we'll just uh I know there
[46:36] are many that have a testimony. Youth
[46:38] camp, we find out, is not only for the
[46:39] young people, but it's for all of us.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; But uh but just at first, we try to get
[46:44] a good amount of the young people time
[46:46] to testify. Amen. Because it's focused
[46:48] uh around them. Amen. Amen. Well,
[46:53] let's start. Amen. Who's got a testimony
[46:56] this evening?
[46:59] Brother Ben. All right, start us out,
[47:01] brother.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Well, um, I don't really have a
[47:06] testimony from camp. It's more of a
[47:09] testimony about my my year-long walk
[47:12] with Christ so far. He has taken me so
[47:15] far.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Um,
[47:18] &gt;&gt; he has I I just I can't describe it. I
[47:23] he's been have he's been burdening this
[47:25] me on my heart for quite a while now.
[47:30] And I was just asking the Lord for a
[47:32] reason to or a time to ask to testify
[47:37] and
[47:38] he he brought this up this this service
[47:41] up and
[47:44] I just thank the Lord for it. Um so
[47:50] Lord help me
[48:07] I apologize.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; I I really can't think of anything. I'm
[48:12] sorry.
[48:14] [Laughter]
[48:19] Well, I just thank the Lord for all he's
[48:21] done in my life.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Um,
[48:24] &gt;&gt; he's given me a testimony. I can't
[48:26] really describe it right now, but he's
[48:28] still working in my life and he's still
[48:30] working in your life.
[48:33] Praise the Lord.
[48:34] [Applause]
[48:35] [Music]
[48:41] &gt;&gt; If you I'm sure you've all noticed, but
[48:43] it's been an amazing trajectory brother
[48:45] Ben's had in his life about would it be
[48:48] about two years ago, you wouldn't have
[48:50] known anything about the message,
[48:52] anything about uh you know uh uh what
[48:55] you know now. So, he's just entered into
[48:57] a whole new world and it's been just
[48:59] inspirational to watch the Lord get a
[49:01] hold of him, to see the moving of the
[49:02] spirit in his life. And so, we're just
[49:05] thankful for you, Brother Ben. You're a
[49:06] testimony to us all. Amen. And, you
[49:08] know, Brother Ben's got a real good
[49:10] friend. Uh, Brother Micaia has done
[49:12] amazing work just being a friend to
[49:14] Brother Ben. And I I'm I'm proud of
[49:17] that. And uh I've told brother Micaiah
[49:19] this personally, but there's a lot of
[49:21] guys stand in a pulpit for a year and
[49:23] never produce something like the what
[49:26] we've seen in brother Ben's life. And so
[49:28] we just appreciate what the Lord has
[49:30] done.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody else got a testimony. You
[49:33] boys, brother Silas.
[49:37] So um
[49:41] I don't remember how long ago exactly it
[49:44] was. pretty sure it was a Sunday, but it
[49:49] was probably like two, three, four
[49:50] months ago. Um, I think it was brother
[49:53] Wayne that was preaching and he preached
[49:55] on it doesn't matter if you were raised
[49:58] in the message unless you have a
[50:00] personal encounter with God, it won't
[50:03] matter.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And so,
[50:07] ever since that sermon, that's what I
[50:09] prayed for. That's what I wanted. I
[50:11] wanted my personal encounter with God.
[50:15] And uh I've been struggling with a well,
[50:20] pardon my testimony, I was struggling
[50:23] with a couple of different addictions
[50:26] and the devil had stole my peace and I
[50:30] was just
[50:32] a big wreck. Um and
[50:37] at this church camp, I really wasn't
[50:40] expecting much cuz I've been to a bunch
[50:42] of them. I went there and I was ready to
[50:46] I was there for a couple of different
[50:47] reasons, not all of them um church
[50:51] related, but um
[50:54] I went there and the first sermon he was
[50:59] uh preaching about your opportunity and
[51:02] that really hit me
[51:04] &gt;&gt; and it made me wake up for a second and
[51:06] made me actually pay attention. And then
[51:09] the second one um was about um
[51:16] you've been given the key.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And um that's when my heart really
[51:21] opened and
[51:23] um the third night, I don't remember
[51:25] exactly what it was about, but um I
[51:29] walked through that prayer line and
[51:33] I will say that those addictions are
[51:36] gone now. I no longer deal with those
[51:38] anymore. I know that there's going to be
[51:40] temptations down the road, but I know
[51:42] that God has given me the key and I'm
[51:45] free.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Um, and my pieces back and I'm just so,
[51:51] &gt;&gt; oh goodness, throat. Um, and I'm just so
[51:53] happy and I've got my peace back and
[51:55] I've got the
[51:58] I've got it and I'm just
[52:01] [Applause]
[52:02] that's what it's all about, church.
[52:06] [Music]
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:12] went through the prayer line on Saturday
[52:14] night and uh I just had a lot in my
[52:16] heart. We're just asking the Lord closer
[52:19] to walk with the Lord and went through
[52:21] the prayer line and um after the
[52:23] ministers had gotten through praying and
[52:25] they had went up and kind of just
[52:27] walking around and I went up back to my
[52:29] seat.
[52:31] I was just sitting there and I was just
[52:34] asked telling the Lord I love him.
[52:37] The angel of the Lord I felt him just
[52:38] come over and hover right above me and I
[52:41] knew it was the angel of the Lord. Just
[52:43] such a peace came over me and I just I
[52:46] don't can't describe it but it was all
[52:49] over the building. I know you guys felt
[52:50] it and I just I want to testify.
[52:58] [Music]
[52:59] [Applause]
[53:02] And to say the least, Brother Ben was
[53:04] right. It was the best weekend of my
[53:06] life.
[53:09] [Applause]
[53:10] [Music]
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Um, I had a few things I was going to
[53:20] camp for. I wanted another experience
[53:24] and um I wanted more joy in my life and
[53:28] um every sermon was super powerful and
[53:31] spoke to me. But uh Thursday night um he
[53:36] touched me in a special way. And um
[53:40] Saturday night I went through the prayer
[53:41] line and before I got past the first few
[53:43] ministers, I just started jumping up and
[53:45] down and they had to carry me out. And
[53:50] before they could get me all the way out
[53:51] of the prayer line, I heard Isaac pray
[53:54] um give her joy. And that was just a
[53:58] confirmation that he hears my prayers.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; And um I was out out of it for a little
[54:04] while, but uh that was a super amazing
[54:07] experience for me. And um we ended up
[54:12] staying in the church quite late that
[54:14] night because we were all drunk. But
[54:18] &gt;&gt; it was so amazing and I'm so grateful
[54:20] for it.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] [Music]
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Nathan, Nathan, if you can have him
[54:30] stand, that'd be great.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; See a little better.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Um, I had been going to camp and um, I
[54:37] just really wanted peace and joy and I
[54:40] just wanted to be happy in the Lord. And
[54:42] I'll just say I came out happy. I had
[54:44] joy. I have peace and that's really my
[54:47] testimony.
[54:48] [Music]
[54:49] [Applause]
[54:50] [Music]
[54:55] &gt;&gt; So, I had a few things that I was coming
[54:58] to camp for. Um, I really wanted the
[55:01] Holy Ghost and to have an experience.
[55:04] And Saturday night, I was standing in
[55:07] the prayer line waiting and my
[55:10] brother-in-law Tyler came and told me
[55:13] that he had went up to give brother
[55:16] Andrew a uh handkerchief. And he said
[55:19] that he felt the presence of the Lord up
[55:21] there and that whatever I wanted then he
[55:24] was up there and I went through and I
[55:28] believe that I got the Holy Ghost and I
[55:30] also got drunk that night.
[55:33] [Applause]
[55:35] [Music]
[55:37] [Applause]
[55:40] [Music]
[55:45] for a couple months. I had been I had
[55:47] some questions
[55:49] and I was praying about them. I went and
[55:53] the first night I was thinking about
[55:54] those questions and he answered them
[55:56] just as I was thinking about it.
[55:59] [Music]
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:07] Amen.
[56:08] The word is still a discerner of the
[56:10] thoughts and intents of the heart.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Anybody else?
[56:16] Sister Shelby.
[56:18] Um on a couple days before camp, Fleece
[56:21] had posted something on the youth chat
[56:24] about testimony she had and at the end
[56:27] of it she wrote that no matter how big
[56:30] or small
[56:32] of a ask we had or a need to go ahead
[56:35] and just write it down at the beginning
[56:37] of camp and lay it aside. And so I'd
[56:41] been dealing with a lot of fear and
[56:42] anxiety for about nine months. And I
[56:45] just wrote down every lie Satan had told
[56:48] me over the past nine months. And next
[56:50] to it I would write, "He is my peace."
[56:52] Or, "He is my joy. He's my love." And at
[56:54] the end of it, I asked I said, "I'm
[56:57] asking for full deliverance."
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And on Saturday, while brother Andrew
[57:01] was preaching, God came down and
[57:04] delivered me of every single thing.
[57:07] Anybody?
[57:10] [Music]
[57:20] Anybody down there? Brother Samuel.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Well, when I first came into camp, I was
[57:32] expecting to get a refilling of the Holy
[57:34] Ghost
[57:36] all through camp. If I was looking for
[57:38] it, I was following through, praying for
[57:41] it. And on Saturday night, I was I stood
[57:44] up in the prayer line. I was going
[57:47] through just thinking of what my prayer
[57:49] is, what what should I be praying for?
[57:51] And I
[57:54] I was taking as steps of faith. Every
[57:59] step I take, I pray for something. And I
[58:02] would I was waiting as I come up to I
[58:05] got a thought. Well, I want to be I want
[58:08] to be slain in the spirit.
[58:10] I want to be carried out. I don't I I've
[58:14] never had it before.
[58:16] I want to be feel his spirit just come
[58:18] down so heavy I couldn't stand. And when
[58:21] I was going through there were so many
[58:24] things that were answered that were I
[58:27] had prayed for for months and I was just
[58:31] so slain in the spirit that I was I had
[58:33] to carried out. I was laid out and then
[58:35] once I slowly came back then I ended I
[58:39] was got refilled with the Holy Ghost I
[58:41] was touched. Um I I ended up getting
[58:46] drunk that night as well but it was it
[58:48] was a wonderful feeling. Joy came back.
[58:51] That's my testimony.
[58:56] [Music]
[58:59] [Applause]
[59:10] Lord
[59:29] Thank you, Jesus.
[59:34] I just went through the prayer line and
[59:37] I was praying for something else and
[59:41] whenever I went through
[59:47] ministry said something that I didn't
[59:51] even go up for and I got delivered from
[59:53] that.
[59:56] [Applause]
[59:57] [Music]
[59:58] [Applause]
[59:58] [Music]
[59:59] [Applause]
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:07] Okay. So,
[1:00:10] I went up uh I I went to the camp,
[1:00:14] whatever, expecting deliverance from an
[1:00:17] addiction. I've been
[1:00:20] kind of just hanging out on my phone
[1:00:24] every freak opportunity I got. kind of
[1:00:29] took away my focus from spending time
[1:00:32] with God and all that. And I just let it
[1:00:37] consume me and I went up uh
[1:00:41] to camp expecting deliverance and God
[1:00:44] delivered me from that. But not only
[1:00:48] that, uh, for quite a few years, my
[1:00:52] ankles have been, uh, super weak and
[1:00:57] anytime I'd play or even just walking,
[1:01:00] they just give out or whatever, I'd
[1:01:03] twist and roll them. And so I always had
[1:01:06] to wear a brace. Well, this camp I kind
[1:01:11] of asked I'd left it and I'd asked my
[1:01:13] mom to get me a new one and so she got
[1:01:17] it. Well, I ended up not even using it
[1:01:21] the entire camp and my ankles were
[1:01:24] completely healed. Never rolled them
[1:01:27] once, never hurt him. I'm thank the Lord
[1:01:29] for that.
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:39] We'll just open it to anyone who wants
[1:01:41] to testify now.
[1:01:43] Anybody? Brother Mike got to raise your
[1:01:46] hands high. I get tunnel vision when I'm
[1:01:48] holding a microphone. So,
[1:01:51] don't get old.
[1:01:55] Testimonies are awesome. Uh, Thursday at
[1:01:58] work, I ended up going to the ER. A lot
[1:02:01] of chest pressure. thinking I'm going to
[1:02:03] miss camp. Was looking forward to it.
[1:02:07] Spent 24 hours. They did all the tests.
[1:02:10] They did a stress test and all that.
[1:02:12] They kept me overnight and
[1:02:14] and
[1:02:16] all everything test came back good. It
[1:02:19] all came back good. The stress test came
[1:02:21] back good. They said they had noticed a
[1:02:23] nodule in my left lung. You know, fear
[1:02:26] tries to step in. And Saturday night, I
[1:02:31] I go up. I'm with the ministers standing
[1:02:33] up front and I don't know why I'm so
[1:02:35] nervous.
[1:02:36] I'm up with the ministers up front and
[1:02:39] I've been battling dizziness also for a
[1:02:42] couple years now. And as I was walking
[1:02:44] up there to the front, I'm dizzy as can
[1:02:46] be. I'm standing up there dizzy as can
[1:02:48] be praying over everybody. And at the
[1:02:50] end of it, I went down to the front
[1:02:53] after everybody had gone through and I
[1:02:54] was like, "That nodule is not going to
[1:02:57] be there.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to claim my healing right
[1:03:00] now." And I went up there to the front
[1:03:02] and as I was walking through the power
[1:03:05] of God fell
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden I heard myself
[1:03:08] shouting, "It is over. I am delivered. I
[1:03:11] am healed. And I know that I know that I
[1:03:14] know that I know that that is now going
[1:03:16] to be there. I got some testing coming
[1:03:18] up. I've followed up with my doctor
[1:03:19] today." He said, "As far as your heart
[1:03:21] goes," he goes, "There's nothing wrong."
[1:03:24] And he's not worried about that nodule
[1:03:26] or anything. But I know when I go, so
[1:03:28] they're going to do some more imaging
[1:03:30] for another reason and it'll check out
[1:03:33] that nodule at the same time. It's not
[1:03:35] going to be there.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And that dizziness has been gone ever
[1:03:38] since that time. It tried to come back
[1:03:41] tonight, but it's gone.
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:49] [Applause]
[1:03:56] I was praying for
[1:03:59] the filling of the Holy Ghost and on
[1:04:03] Saturday night through the prayer line I
[1:04:05] believe that prayer was answered.
[1:04:09] [Applause]
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:19] Um, so one of the things I went to camp
[1:04:22] for was um my stomach issues and um our
[1:04:26] camp was the worst over like many years.
[1:04:29] Like I would have to take a bunch of
[1:04:30] pain pain and like acid medication and
[1:04:34] this camp I didn't have to take any
[1:04:36] whatsoever. So glory to God for that.
[1:04:38] And then uh one of my main thing was
[1:04:41] like Sunday mornings I could hardly last
[1:04:43] like I could hardly go through service
[1:04:45] usually like I'd throw up a bunch
[1:04:47] sometimes and like I could hardly go to
[1:04:50] the fellowship after. I'd be so sick and
[1:04:53] have to leave. And I just got delivered
[1:04:55] of that Saturday night and I haven't
[1:04:57] felt any pain since.
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:08] I'll do my best to keep this short. Back
[1:05:11] in October, November of last year, I
[1:05:14] started to have a lot of hormonal
[1:05:16] issues, which caused me to have a lot of
[1:05:18] mental battles. Sometime in June, my
[1:05:21] doctor said I most likely had PCOS. I
[1:05:23] decided I wasn't going to accept that
[1:05:25] and went up for prayer sometime in July.
[1:05:28] Camp arrived in Thursday night. Brother
[1:05:29] Andrew was talking about recognizing and
[1:05:31] believing the Lord's presence and how
[1:05:33] anything could take place. I claimed my
[1:05:36] healing right then. The presence of the
[1:05:38] Lord was so strong and it felt like
[1:05:40] something physically dropped into my
[1:05:42] chest and it just settled there. I can't
[1:05:44] really explain it other than I knew I
[1:05:46] was healed and it was all over. Saturday
[1:05:49] came and it was a rough day. The devil
[1:05:51] was attacking me with some of the worst
[1:05:53] mind battles, fear, anxiety, and con
[1:05:56] condemnation about my past that I've
[1:05:58] ever experienced.
[1:06:00] I knew he was fighting me that hard
[1:06:02] because he was about to lose his hold on
[1:06:04] my life.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; When brother Andrew started talking
[1:06:06] about fear and anxiety at the end of the
[1:06:08] service, I was praying and I remember
[1:06:10] telling the Lord, I didn't know where or
[1:06:13] when all this fear and anxiety started,
[1:06:15] but I knew he had me in my future in his
[1:06:17] hands and I knew he could deliver me,
[1:06:19] too. The presence of the Lord swept
[1:06:21] through my row and those chains of fear,
[1:06:24] anxiety, and condemnation broke off of
[1:06:26] my life. There's so much more that
[1:06:28] happened, but it would be too long to
[1:06:30] tell.
[1:06:31] That Tuesday after camp, I had an
[1:06:34] ultrasound to check and see if something
[1:06:35] more serious was going on other than
[1:06:37] what they thought was PCOS. The devil
[1:06:40] began to fight me so hard that morning,
[1:06:42] but I kept reminding him that he was
[1:06:44] defeated by the sword in my hand and the
[1:06:46] word in my mouth.
[1:06:48] I got the ultrasound done and my doctor
[1:06:50] comes in to read the results and she
[1:06:52] says that I don't have PCOS and
[1:06:53] everything is perfectly fine and
[1:06:55] healthy. I told Annie what my doctor
[1:06:58] said and she was like, Lauren, your
[1:07:00] doctor probably doesn't even realize it,
[1:07:01] but you just got your healing. That's
[1:07:04] when it hit me that the Lord was so
[1:07:05] gracious and answered my prayers and
[1:07:07] healed me. I knew he he had and it took
[1:07:10] it a minute to sink in. The Lord
[1:07:12] answered so many of my prayers and I
[1:07:14] know he'll answer the rest of them. I'm
[1:07:16] so thankful for the Lord's grace in my
[1:07:19] life.
[1:07:20] [Applause]
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; One more camp testimony. Brother Ian
[1:07:32] Patton here got baptized on Sunday
[1:07:34] morning. Go stand everybody.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; We're sure proud of this young man.
[1:07:38] Amen.
[1:07:43] Any
[1:07:50] other hands? Sister Laura.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. First off, I was a counselor for
[1:07:58] the first time this year, but I had a
[1:07:59] really good group of girls, so I got
[1:08:01] broken easy. But I really enjoyed that.
[1:08:04] But well, it's actually a couple of
[1:08:06] months ago when uh Brother Ron and
[1:08:08] Brother Tim had come down and Brother
[1:08:10] Ron had preached a message and it was
[1:08:12] simple. was just God is a big God and um
[1:08:16] so uh you know we've been going through
[1:08:18] some different things and at that that
[1:08:20] that time I was going through a lot and
[1:08:23] um I'd went through the prayer line and
[1:08:27] uh actually it was brother Ron came he
[1:08:28] asked he goes can I talk to you and he
[1:08:30] goes uh sister he's like you can't carry
[1:08:33] this you're not strong enough he goes
[1:08:35] but God is a big God and and the spirit
[1:08:38] of God hit me and I just totally fell
[1:08:40] out which I had never done that. But uh
[1:08:44] so I held that in my heart. Well, um of
[1:08:47] course the God is a big God. Well, you
[1:08:49] know, you guys know of everything that's
[1:08:51] kind of been going on with with Zion and
[1:08:53] the different things. Well, um we come
[1:08:56] to Saturday and um um I'm helping in the
[1:09:01] prayer line while I I had seen Zion in
[1:09:04] the back and also there was a scripture
[1:09:06] the Lord had given me about and I
[1:09:09] actually put it in the house. I give it
[1:09:10] to Z. And it says um that the Lord will
[1:09:14] remember Zion. Yeah, this set time has
[1:09:16] come. He will favor her. And I I told
[1:09:19] Zion that well.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; So I seen her and it was amazing like
[1:09:23] how the song services, brother men, he's
[1:09:25] just in the spirit and like different
[1:09:28] situations where like I knew the
[1:09:29] situation and he would sing a song.
[1:09:31] Well,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; so I seen Zion and then that he started
[1:09:34] to sing that song that God is bigger,
[1:09:37] better, stronger, greater. And one part
[1:09:40] says, uh, I say to the mountain, it's
[1:09:43] time to move.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; So, I just felt the Lord and I, right?
[1:09:47] You know, before she got into the prayer
[1:09:48] line and I I went to her and just I
[1:09:51] quoted that scripture and I said, "It,
[1:09:54] you know, it's time for this mountain to
[1:09:56] move." And uh, so she, you know, the
[1:09:59] presence of the Lord and then she gets
[1:10:00] into the prayer line and Brother Wayne
[1:10:02] says, "It's time for the mountain to
[1:10:03] move." And boy did God move. And we were
[1:10:07] all rejoicing, jumping and shouting. And
[1:10:10] anyway, so I just want to thank the
[1:10:12] Lord.
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:16] [Applause]
[1:10:23] Just real quick, the uh Lord gave me a
[1:10:28] the meetings were wonderful and and I I
[1:10:30] can't tell you how wonderful it was to
[1:10:32] see the so many drunk young people. I'm
[1:10:36] so so happy. It was such a wonderful
[1:10:39] experience sitting in there and watching
[1:10:41] the Lord just sweep over you young
[1:10:43] people. But Sunday night or Sunday
[1:10:46] afternoon, I'm standing out there at the
[1:10:48] end of the road and I'm just thinking on
[1:10:50] the the goodness of the Lord and I look
[1:10:52] down and the devil, the serpent is
[1:10:55] laying dead between my feet. And every
[1:10:58] one of you that came in there Sunday
[1:11:00] drove over top of that dead devil. He
[1:11:02] was he was dried up. But every one of
[1:11:04] you got to drive over top of that dead
[1:11:06] devil.
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:17] Well, uh, God's been doing a lot in my
[1:11:20] life over this past couple months. Um,
[1:11:22] it's good to be good to be here and a
[1:11:24] part of the church.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Um, well, for one testimony, uh, my lip
[1:11:29] that was cut. Um, I was supposed to go
[1:11:32] to an oral surgeon here in a couple
[1:11:33] weeks, but I went up and got prayed for.
[1:11:36] It's completely healed. I have to cancel
[1:11:38] it cuz there's there's nothing to look
[1:11:39] at. There's nothing to see there. It's
[1:11:41] completely healed. Um, but God has been
[1:11:45] doing so much in in my life. Um, there's
[1:11:51] Yeah, I
[1:11:53] God's been good.
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:01] [Applause]
[1:12:04] Uh, so I had been wanting a a closer
[1:12:06] walk with the Lord before camp and uh
[1:12:10] cuz I hadn't I hadn't been reading my
[1:12:14] Bible or even listening to tapes as much
[1:12:16] as I knew I I could have or should have.
[1:12:19] Uh, and I kind of felt myself growing
[1:12:22] apart from the Lord. So, uh, when I went
[1:12:25] to the prayer line Saturday, I heard one
[1:12:27] of the ministers say, uh, give him a
[1:12:30] closer walk, Lord. And that really
[1:12:32] touched me. So,
[1:12:34] now after camp, I came out with my heart
[1:12:38] was burned with a new desire for the
[1:12:40] Lord. And so, now I can walk closer with
[1:12:44] him every day.
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:54] I just want to thank the Lord uh for
[1:12:56] touching my life again at camp. Um on
[1:13:00] Sunday afternoon when uh brother Josh
[1:13:03] was preaching about all the uh lost ones
[1:13:08] coming in um that just really touched me
[1:13:11] and I was just thanking the Lord in that
[1:13:14] moment and I just thank the Lord for his
[1:13:16] touch.
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:19] [Applause]
[1:13:30] kept waiting on Z or Zoe to testify so I
[1:13:32] wouldn't have to do this.
[1:13:35] Um but and I wasn't going to, but I
[1:13:38] figured that if um you guys all prayed
[1:13:40] for me as much as you have, then you
[1:13:42] deserve the right to know about the
[1:13:44] victory that's came.
[1:13:46] Um, a couple weeks ago I ended up back
[1:13:49] in the hospital because I was passing
[1:13:51] out so much and I was hitting my head
[1:13:54] and and things were just in a really a
[1:13:56] really scary spot. And um, but in the
[1:14:00] hospital, the Lord had just revealed to
[1:14:02] me how much that fear was playing a part
[1:14:05] in all of it. And he took that fear
[1:14:08] away. And and from then on, I knew I
[1:14:10] knew I was healed. I just I had to walk
[1:14:12] into the full heal, you know, the full
[1:14:15] victory of it. And so, um, went into
[1:14:18] camp and I knew I knew that I was going
[1:14:20] to get my complete healing. And, um, the
[1:14:22] Saturday before service, I was praying
[1:14:25] and the spirit of the Lord came down in
[1:14:27] the house and and it was just a special
[1:14:30] such a special meeting. And I had never
[1:14:32] encountered anything like that where I
[1:14:34] just really felt like I met him face to
[1:14:36] face. And um and so I uh it just it hit
[1:14:41] me that um I was thinking about the
[1:14:43] prayer line and about the children of
[1:14:45] Israel coming to the Red Sea and how
[1:14:47] when they walked through that water
[1:14:49] swallowed up all of those enemies that
[1:14:51] had been coming after them. And I and I
[1:14:53] purposed in my heart when I walked
[1:14:55] through that prayer line that that enemy
[1:14:58] that had been following me for this last
[1:15:00] year and a half, he wasn't going to
[1:15:02] follow me through that prayer lineise.
[1:15:06] And I'll tell you, I have not passed out
[1:15:08] one time since Thursday
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; and I'm getting stronger every day and
[1:15:14] that he has completely healed me.
[1:15:17] And I'm so thankful and I thank you all.
[1:15:21] And I' been on some certain medicines
[1:15:23] and things that I'd been on for a year,
[1:15:25] year and a half, and I've he's
[1:15:27] completely restored my peace and my joy
[1:15:30] and my sleep. And I thank you all for
[1:15:32] praying. And I just thank the Lord for
[1:15:35] what he's done.
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I thank you all for um
[1:15:47] hosting the camp. It was a blessing and
[1:15:49] I had excruciating pain. I couldn't lift
[1:15:51] my arm. I couldn't do anything two days
[1:15:53] ago and now I can no pain. And then also
[1:15:57] um um Somali was like, "Can we go
[1:15:59] tonight for the testimony?" I said, "Oh
[1:16:00] no, we got work and school." And I was
[1:16:02] cooking and God said go. So I was like,
[1:16:05] Molly, hurry, get your clothes.
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Um, I just want to say God did so many
[1:16:16] things for me at camp. Um, through the
[1:16:19] prayer line service. I believe that he
[1:16:21] filled me with the Holy Ghost. And I
[1:16:24] just want to say thank you all for being
[1:16:26] my friend.
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:29] [Applause]
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:40] So, uh, I've been battling for about a
[1:16:42] year now with, uh, just different health
[1:16:44] conditions. Um, just, you know, similar
[1:16:47] to Bethany, just passing out and
[1:16:49] different things and just the devil
[1:16:52] trying to torment me. And uh
[1:16:56] well at camp that week before camp it
[1:16:59] was probably the one of the worst weeks.
[1:17:02] And uh well we Saturday night um was
[1:17:07] again it's pretty rough. I was just
[1:17:09] really weak and different things and
[1:17:10] Caleb was he had such a bad migraine
[1:17:14] actually in fact that he just said I've
[1:17:16] got to go lay down and he went in the
[1:17:18] car and laid down and I realized it
[1:17:20] astonished me like what are we doing no
[1:17:23] this is the devil has been fighting us
[1:17:25] for this moment I said texted him saying
[1:17:27] get back in here I was like no I was
[1:17:30] like we have not fought for all this for
[1:17:31] us to go lay down or something we can't
[1:17:33] I don't care and I said let's I said I I
[1:17:37] wasn't evening and go in the prayer line
[1:17:39] and uh but I just really felt that I
[1:17:42] should and uh I mean I was again I was
[1:17:45] weak. I kept having to sit down
[1:17:46] different things and uh when I got up to
[1:17:49] the prayer line honestly I didn't have
[1:17:52] any emotion. I wasn't crying. I was just
[1:17:55] Lord just whatever you want from me cuz
[1:17:57] you know Lord I believe that you've
[1:17:59] healed me. But
[1:18:02] and again mom said that brother Bend
[1:18:04] started singing that song. So I speak to
[1:18:06] the mountain, it's time to move.
[1:18:09] And a lightning bolt struck me like
[1:18:13] I've never felt before in my entire
[1:18:14] life. And Uncle Wayne said, "Speak,
[1:18:18] Zion. Speak." And I just started
[1:18:20] screaming, "I'm healed. I'm healed."
[1:18:23] And um the girl who could hardly walk
[1:18:27] danced for like 20, 30 minutes
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; and was able to dance with her girls
[1:18:32] Bethany and Zoe, which we danced all
[1:18:36] over that devil, I'm telling you.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; And the girl who had to be carried out
[1:18:41] all the previous services was able to
[1:18:43] get a purse and she was able to pray
[1:18:44] with a couple other people. She danced
[1:18:46] and she was able to walk out on her own
[1:18:48] feet.
[1:18:50] Amen.
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:19:01] Um, I just want to thank the Lord. Um, I
[1:19:06] as as we moved here about seven years
[1:19:08] ago and and our heart's desires was our
[1:19:11] kids would be raised in this atmosphere
[1:19:14] and I believe that we've begun to see
[1:19:16] the impact of that and I'm so thankful.
[1:19:18] Um, I have witnessed firsthand the
[1:19:22] effects that the enemy has tried to
[1:19:24] place on my kids. Like, I've seen even
[1:19:27] in their young age when there's been
[1:19:29] fear, when there's been evil influences,
[1:19:31] when they've been tormented,
[1:19:33] but I've also now seen when they've been
[1:19:36] under the impact of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:19:38] someone recently told me, uh, "Brother,
[1:19:41] I think you're raising a fanatic."
[1:19:44] And I I want to say, well, I think all
[1:19:45] our kids here are fanatics, and I'm
[1:19:47] thankful for that.
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:58] share one that was texted in anonymously
[1:20:01] and that uh you'll understand why from
[1:20:03] the details here. This is from a young
[1:20:05] couple in the church here. Uh two months
[1:20:07] or so before camp, the Lord put on our
[1:20:10] hearts to give an offering to help out
[1:20:11] with the camp expenses. We decided that
[1:20:14] we would just give whatever the next
[1:20:16] month's commission check was. We never
[1:20:18] really know what it'll be. So when it
[1:20:19] came in for that month, it was over
[1:20:21] double the amount we had ever made in
[1:20:22] commission. Be careful what you ask for.
[1:20:25] Amen.
[1:20:27] But the same week, there was a big
[1:20:28] meeting at work that I had been praying
[1:20:29] about. It would be a big deal for me to
[1:20:31] get this client. I gave the check to the
[1:20:33] Lord. Two to three days later, the
[1:20:35] client decided to use our company. You
[1:20:37] just can't outgive the Lord.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate that.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:20:53] We all know that we have a restoration
[1:20:55] message
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; and something really struck me. I can't
[1:20:59] remember all the details but when
[1:21:02] brother Josh was ministering I believe
[1:21:04] there was somebody in his assembly 20
[1:21:06] years out from the Lord and the Lord
[1:21:09] restored him. So what really struck me
[1:21:12] on Sunday after the service in the back
[1:21:14] room where the ministers were, our
[1:21:18] brother Miguel from Pawne, Oklahoma gave
[1:21:21] his testimony of three of his loved
[1:21:24] ones. And I think one of them had one of
[1:21:27] them was his stepdad. I believe didn't
[1:21:29] want nothing to do with him for a time,
[1:21:31] but the Lord just restored all three
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; and I think one of them was out from the
[1:21:36] Lord for many years. So people, I know
[1:21:40] that God is real and he's going to
[1:21:42] restore those that have backsliden.
[1:21:46] We're claiming them.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:52] [Applause]
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:22:08] Okay, like Nathan said, I went to camp
[1:22:11] sick and I left healed.
[1:22:14] Um, after about eight months of um of
[1:22:18] passing out and feeling very out of
[1:22:21] control and um helpless, I um well, I
[1:22:26] didn't make it through the prayer line.
[1:22:27] I I did kind of crumble to the ground
[1:22:29] but um it was in a way of uh the Lord
[1:22:33] was carrying me and um he was holding me
[1:22:37] in his arms and instead of feeling
[1:22:38] helpless I was just I was just resting
[1:22:41] and yeah then yeah anyways it was really
[1:22:46] good.
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:53] [Applause]
[1:22:58] Good evening, folks. Um, so there's been
[1:23:02] uh some promises I've been claiming
[1:23:04] for quite a few years and
[1:23:09] lately I've been getting to the point
[1:23:10] it's like I'm speaking the word and I'm
[1:23:13] waiting on the manifestation and I'm
[1:23:15] speaking the word and waiting on the
[1:23:16] manifestation
[1:23:17] and the devil started coming and
[1:23:19] fighting me like man what's the point?
[1:23:22] Because speaking the word over a
[1:23:24] situation takes a lot of energy out of
[1:23:26] you if you're not seeing it happen. And
[1:23:28] as it just happens over and over, year
[1:23:30] in and year out, and the devil's like,
[1:23:32] "Why you just keep wasting your time?"
[1:23:33] And I started feeling depressed about
[1:23:36] it. And uh then I um I was worshiping on
[1:23:43] prayer line was Saturday, right? Yeah.
[1:23:45] So I was worshiping on Saturday night
[1:23:47] and I was just thanking God for whatever
[1:23:49] he done for me and all that. And then
[1:23:51] all of a sudden about the time that God
[1:23:53] hid Zion and all them, I was like
[1:23:56] thanking the Lord like Jesus, thank you
[1:23:58] for them, you know. And he said, "Okay,
[1:24:01] so the same way I'm answering their
[1:24:03] prayers, I'm going to answer yours. But
[1:24:05] I want you to understand it's a
[1:24:07] privilege for you to speak the word and
[1:24:10] claim a promise and I don't answer it
[1:24:13] because it's your way of proving your fa
[1:24:16] your faith in my word." And so I started
[1:24:19] the depression left because I started
[1:24:21] saying, "Thank you, Jesus, for allowing
[1:24:23] me to have this chance of claiming my
[1:24:25] victory, of claiming my promise even
[1:24:27] when I'm not seeing it happen." And so
[1:24:29] that depression lifted. I ain't seen the
[1:24:31] promises yet, but I'm thankful. I mean,
[1:24:33] I want to see them happen, right? But on
[1:24:35] the other hand, I'm thankful that God
[1:24:37] has chosen me to be able to claim these
[1:24:40] victories and allow me to grow in that.
[1:24:43] And then the devil must have got upset
[1:24:45] about that because he healed oh God
[1:24:48] healed her of puricy and then I just got
[1:24:51] diagnosed with bronchitis yesterday. But
[1:24:53] the same God that can deliver her from
[1:24:55] pury can whoop this bronchitis. So I'll
[1:24:58] be all right. So
[1:25:01] [Applause]
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:04] [Applause]
[1:25:09] wonder if we can get a few more young
[1:25:11] people in. We got back there. I'm
[1:25:15] coming. All right.
[1:25:32] I'm gonna try to make this quick, but uh
[1:25:37] God's done a lot for me. Um, not too
[1:25:41] long ago, I started to slip really bad
[1:25:45] and I started to get a lot of mental
[1:25:47] battles
[1:25:49] and um, just started doing things that I
[1:25:51] normally wouldn't.
[1:25:53] And uh, I guess to put in a way, I just
[1:25:55] started running from the Lord. Started,
[1:25:57] you know, skipping services, any excuses
[1:26:00] I could find to skip a service.
[1:26:02] So, you know, this is all going to tie
[1:26:04] in, but I took a vacation to Florida and
[1:26:08] made sure I was going to be gone for two
[1:26:10] Sundays and uh just telling the truth.
[1:26:14] And um one of the nights I was just, you
[1:26:16] know, cruising around and something
[1:26:19] happened at the Waffle House and uh I
[1:26:21] was just being nosy. So, I decided to
[1:26:23] pull over, talk to the employee, see
[1:26:24] what happened. And um you know it's as I
[1:26:28] talked to this guy it's uh not anybody
[1:26:30] thought I would be a believer at all. Um
[1:26:33] you know just the way he looked you know
[1:26:35] long hair and you know some tattoos
[1:26:37] which nothing wrong with it. It's just
[1:26:38] not somebody you would think firsthand
[1:26:40] would be believer and kind of had hippie
[1:26:42] vibe. And I was just talking to him and
[1:26:45] some point in the conversation you know
[1:26:46] he kind of just starts talking about
[1:26:48] God. Uh didn't expect that. And uh you
[1:26:52] know he kind of looks at me and he goes,
[1:26:53] "You know what, man? God's testing you."
[1:26:56] And um repeated that multiple times. And
[1:26:59] I remember as he left, you know, he said
[1:27:02] it again as he's walking away, he said,
[1:27:05] "God's testing you." And um it stuck
[1:27:08] with me. And you know, decided to come
[1:27:10] to church that Sunday and Brother Wayne
[1:27:13] was preaching
[1:27:15] and uh he said, you know, and I was in a
[1:27:18] really, really rough spot. And that's an
[1:27:20] understatement. But um and brother Wayne
[1:27:23] was preaching and he said, you know, God
[1:27:25] will, and paraphrase, I don't remember
[1:27:27] exactly how I said, you know, God will
[1:27:28] anoint somebody to, you know, out of a
[1:27:31] barroom or something like that, you
[1:27:32] know, just somebody that's not a
[1:27:33] believer to say something to you. And
[1:27:35] that stuck with me, but you know, with
[1:27:38] all the oppression that had going on,
[1:27:40] you know, Satan put all the stuff in my
[1:27:42] mind, you know, I felt like there was a
[1:27:44] Lord, but my thoughts just went to I
[1:27:46] failed the test. You know, I was a
[1:27:48] hypocrite.
[1:27:50] um let you know everybody at church
[1:27:52] down, my friends. Um so going into camp,
[1:27:54] you know, I just that's what I thought.
[1:27:56] I was a hypocrite. And um so I already
[1:27:59] made in my mind I was not going through
[1:28:00] the prayer line and I didn't just cuz
[1:28:02] you know I was too scared of what people
[1:28:03] would think. And um you know after the
[1:28:06] prayer line ended
[1:28:08] um you know it was dismissed and most
[1:28:11] people were gone. I remember I was kind
[1:28:12] of just sitting in my chair and
[1:28:14] disappointed, you know, that I, you
[1:28:16] know, I didn't want to live another year
[1:28:18] in, you know, the state I was in. And I
[1:28:20] I was just sitting there. I didn't know
[1:28:22] what to do, you know. And that's when uh
[1:28:25] brother Nick, right, you know, most
[1:28:26] people were gone, came into my aisle and
[1:28:28] started praying for me and real
[1:28:31] genuinely. And he prayed for me for a
[1:28:34] good bit and at some point it was very
[1:28:36] profound. You know, I had a lot of
[1:28:38] complexes, of course. you know, I just
[1:28:40] felt like something just left me. I got
[1:28:42] physically weak, but Nick was holding on
[1:28:44] to me tight, so I didn't fall. And um I
[1:28:48] remember it was really encouraging
[1:28:49] because, you know, it's easy to think it
[1:28:51] was an emotion or some sort. And Nick
[1:28:53] said, you know, hey, man, you I felt
[1:28:55] something leave you. And I'm like,
[1:28:56] that's interesting. I felt the same
[1:28:58] exact thing. And I remember at that
[1:29:01] moment, I was like, you know, now that
[1:29:02] that's gone, let me start praying to
[1:29:04] God. I really want to make my heart
[1:29:05] right. That's really the only thing I
[1:29:06] wanted out of camp. Yeah.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And you know, I just couldn't get any
[1:29:10] words out. You know, I was just sitting
[1:29:12] there like, I don't know. I haven't
[1:29:13] prayed in a while.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; And I remember the only thing I could
[1:29:16] ask for was Lord, you know, I need
[1:29:18] somebody to lift me up in prayer. I need
[1:29:20] somebody to come here. And I remember
[1:29:21] there's a few brothers sitting in front
[1:29:23] of me and I was like, maybe him. And
[1:29:25] well, they got up and left and there was
[1:29:27] not that many people left in the
[1:29:28] building. And that's when um you know,
[1:29:31] and I was really I mean, I was
[1:29:32] desperate. You know, I didn't want to
[1:29:33] leave. You know, you know how brother
[1:29:36] Ram said, "You clean the house." And I
[1:29:37] knew I needed something else. And I was
[1:29:39] really desperate in my heart. You know,
[1:29:41] I just sat there and I was just waiting.
[1:29:42] I wasn't praying. I was just like, you
[1:29:44] know, thought, that's not how God works.
[1:29:46] You can't ask for something and it just
[1:29:47] comes. And I was praying for somebody to
[1:29:49] come pray with me. And that's when uh
[1:29:52] that's when Troy came in my aisle and he
[1:29:54] kind of looked at me and he said, "Hey
[1:29:55] man, I feel led to pray for you." And uh
[1:29:58] I'm like, "Well," I was like, "Okay."
[1:30:00] Well, I was literally waiting for
[1:30:02] somebody to do that, you know, and um he
[1:30:06] prayed for me and you know, I just lost
[1:30:08] it. Um I basically used him as a tissue,
[1:30:11] you know, um and I'm just I'm just so
[1:30:15] thankful, you know, and just presence,
[1:30:17] Lord, I felt it and you know, all that's
[1:30:20] gone. And I'm just glad for, you know,
[1:30:22] the people we have in church and, you
[1:30:24] know, the people led. I'm glad Troy
[1:30:26] listened to that voice. You know, I
[1:30:28] didn't know he was in the building. I'm
[1:30:29] just thankful. That's all I got from
[1:30:30] camp, you know.
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:53] There's Sister Mandaline. I was looking
[1:30:54] for you.
[1:30:56] I just want to thank the Lord for what
[1:30:58] he's done. It just been a real blessing
[1:31:01] at camp. Brother Ben was right when he
[1:31:05] said it was going to be the best weekend
[1:31:06] of our lives.
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:18] I had been struggling a good bit this
[1:31:20] year and um had just let some things
[1:31:23] build up in my spirit toward the Lord,
[1:31:25] toward people, just I didn't think it
[1:31:28] was major, you know, just a little bit
[1:31:29] of bitterness or a little bit of
[1:31:31] whatever, but it had just started to
[1:31:33] wear on me. Um, and leading up to camp,
[1:31:36] I knew I was not in a good spot just
[1:31:39] mentally, emotionally, spiritually, you
[1:31:41] name it. I needed help. And, uh, I get
[1:31:44] to camp and for the first time in four
[1:31:46] years, I actually have to work. Uh, I
[1:31:48] didn't have an easest storm this year. I
[1:31:51] had a bit of a situation all weekend.
[1:31:53] Um, and that's it. It was interesting.
[1:31:56] So, I ended up missing um, a good amount
[1:32:00] of Thursday and Friday service. And then
[1:32:03] Saturday service I tried to stay in, but
[1:32:05] I was still out a little bit there. And
[1:32:08] again, like I went to camp to work.
[1:32:10] That's what I I had a burden to, but at
[1:32:12] the same time, it's just like that
[1:32:15] thought was in my head of but Lord, why
[1:32:17] do I always have to work? Like why can't
[1:32:19] I ever get the blessing? you know, these
[1:32:21] people will come and they have these
[1:32:23] epic Saturday night testimonies or they
[1:32:25] have these wonderful situations that
[1:32:27] happen and like the Lord has done stuff
[1:32:28] for me and I usually just weep and whail
[1:32:30] and ugly cry and that's it. And nothing
[1:32:34] wrong with that, but I was just like
[1:32:36] genuinely but also selfishly and kind of
[1:32:39] carnally like why can't I ever have
[1:32:41] anything more? Um, so I'm just sitting
[1:32:45] in my seat worshiping Saturday night and
[1:32:47] finally I decide to go ahead and go
[1:32:49] through the prayer line and and I was
[1:32:51] just, you know, at that point all I
[1:32:53] wanted was my joy back. I'm like, I
[1:32:55] don't really care about anything else. I
[1:32:56] just I feel like I've lost all joy of
[1:32:59] everything. I'm just going through the
[1:33:00] motions cuz I know it's right. Um, but
[1:33:02] that's not right. You're supposed to
[1:33:04] have more than that. So, I I get up to
[1:33:06] the the start of the prayer line and the
[1:33:10] songs that were being sung the whole
[1:33:11] time I was in the prayer line were just
[1:33:12] speaking to me, but I was just like, I I
[1:33:14] just want my joy. That's all I had on my
[1:33:16] my mind. And I get in the prayer line
[1:33:18] and Brother Wayne grabs a hold of me and
[1:33:21] uh like I went back and watched it and
[1:33:23] literally physically turned me to him
[1:33:26] and just like preached in my ear. And
[1:33:28] all I remember him saying was like
[1:33:30] something that the spirits that are are
[1:33:32] holding her be free and like she can
[1:33:34] like basically move forward. And I don't
[1:33:35] remember there was a bunch of other
[1:33:36] things said as I went through. Um and it
[1:33:39] got to the point where I was just crying
[1:33:41] out to the Lord. Like I wanted that. I I
[1:33:43] wanted just to be back. And um I I don't
[1:33:48] really remember much of the prayer line.
[1:33:49] I I blacked out and I think I had to be
[1:33:51] be carried over to a seat. And I
[1:33:53] remember just weeping and crying. And
[1:33:55] like when I came to um I just had this
[1:33:59] this genuine like thankfulness of like
[1:34:03] I'm not worthy. I I don't deserve his
[1:34:05] grace and his love and he he comes every
[1:34:09] time and just takes care of us. And I
[1:34:11] was just so overwhelmed and weeping with
[1:34:12] that. And I went back to my seat and
[1:34:15] like every time I would think about it,
[1:34:17] I would just start crying all over
[1:34:18] again. And I think I cried. I don't
[1:34:20] know. I thought it was just a couple
[1:34:22] hours. Turned out we were in there till
[1:34:24] like 108 is what I was told when I
[1:34:26] walked out. And the whole time I was
[1:34:28] just so thankful for his love and his
[1:34:31] grace and his goodness and everything
[1:34:33] that I didn't deserve as a human. And
[1:34:36] the young people were just slap happy
[1:34:38] and giggling. And it was just so
[1:34:39] precious to to watch the love from
[1:34:41] brother Nathan like just enjoying them
[1:34:44] being like that. And there was no no
[1:34:46] reproach, no pressure. It was just full
[1:34:47] liberty and love. And I just remember
[1:34:49] sitting in my seat like I wish I had
[1:34:52] strength to just run around screaming,
[1:34:53] "Look what the Lord has done." But I
[1:34:55] couldn't move. And I didn't think
[1:34:56] anything about that at the time um until
[1:34:58] I went to leave. And uh I thought I was
[1:35:01] fine. I gathered my stuff. I was aware
[1:35:03] that I was walking, but my toes weren't
[1:35:05] working. They felt longer than my feet.
[1:35:08] My knees weren't working. My body was
[1:35:10] kind of not right.
[1:35:13] And so I get out to the vestibule and my
[1:35:14] cousin Esther looks at me and goes, "Oh,
[1:35:16] Hannah,
[1:35:18] I don't know what I looked like, but
[1:35:20] apparently I sat down and she asked if I
[1:35:21] was a room leader and my eyes crossed
[1:35:23] and I don't know what I answered." And
[1:35:25] uh so I had to get carried uh to a golf
[1:35:28] cart, carried up my steps into my dorm.
[1:35:32] And I never had that happen before. And
[1:35:33] it just like made me realize the Lord
[1:35:36] hears like the desires of your heart and
[1:35:38] like he he will answer that. Um, and
[1:35:41] then in conjunction with that, part of
[1:35:43] my my interesting room all weekend,
[1:35:46] there was a situation and I was
[1:35:47] completely out of it on Saturday night.
[1:35:49] And I just really appreciate the staff
[1:35:51] and the support from Brother Nathan and
[1:35:53] the ministry that in an hour of need
[1:35:55] when I wasn't able to be there instead
[1:35:57] of, you know, being told I wasn't a good
[1:36:00] leader and should have been doing my job
[1:36:01] and not been in church getting drunk,
[1:36:03] they just stepped in and took care of
[1:36:04] everything. And like there was no no
[1:36:07] backlash for that. Just absolute love
[1:36:09] and support. And I really appreciate
[1:36:10] that and I'm thankful for what the Lord
[1:36:12] has done.
[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; You know, we uh we get young people
[1:36:26] coming to the camp from
[1:36:29] I mean uh from situations darker than
[1:36:32] you can imagine sometimes. And uh
[1:36:34] there's all kinds of things that you
[1:36:36] just would never think that pop up
[1:36:38] during the week. And that's where I
[1:36:40] appreciate uh somebody like Sister
[1:36:41] Hannah, all our other dorm leaders, but
[1:36:44] she sure had the lion share this year.
[1:36:46] But uh but so anointed to be in that
[1:36:49] position, a minister with wisdom, with
[1:36:51] leadership uh just to make the right
[1:36:54] decisions and bring in the right people.
[1:36:55] And that that does so much to protect
[1:36:58] the testimony of the camp to to to to
[1:37:01] open a door for the Lord to touch lives.
[1:37:04] And so we so appreciate that service and
[1:37:07] Amen. and and that was a a testimony for
[1:37:10] me because a lot of those kind of things
[1:37:12] going on in the weekend. Uh we didn't
[1:37:15] get much time with our young people,
[1:37:17] which is usually priority number one.
[1:37:19] It's just to make some memories
[1:37:20] together. I missed almost all the
[1:37:22] volleyball games and just uh felt like
[1:37:25] we we didn't get a lot of the time
[1:37:28] together that I would like. last year,
[1:37:30] you know, uh the young people really
[1:37:32] lingered in the service and uh and just
[1:37:35] got drunk in the spirit, just enjoying
[1:37:36] it. And uh I missed that alto together
[1:37:38] last year. So God was good. Uh uh um
[1:37:44] Saturday night, right? We I was able to
[1:37:46] spend a little time after the service
[1:37:48] there. Some of our young people were
[1:37:50] lingering and uh we just had a special
[1:37:52] moment. You know, we just thank God for
[1:37:55] light hearts.
[1:37:56] uh these these young hearts carry so
[1:37:58] much heaviness of this world a lot of
[1:38:00] the time just to have a just to for God
[1:38:03] to have a place uh for laughter, for
[1:38:06] peace, for happiness, for
[1:38:08] light-heartedness. Uh that's such a
[1:38:10] blessing. That's such a blessing. And
[1:38:12] it's good to have that together. You
[1:38:14] know, uh if you don't travel around with
[1:38:16] these young people, you might not know,
[1:38:18] but I don't care where you're at and
[1:38:20] where they're having church. Uh our kids
[1:38:22] here will be the last ones out of the
[1:38:24] building every time. They know how to
[1:38:26] water that seed and they know just how
[1:38:28] to enjoy the presence of the Lord. And
[1:38:29] we thank God for that. Amen. We
[1:38:31] appreciate that,
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Kenzie.
[1:38:44] I came to camp with a lot of things on
[1:38:46] my heart. Um, anxiety and health issues.
[1:38:49] And uh actually last minute Saturday
[1:38:53] night right before before the prayer
[1:38:55] line, I had in my heart that I would
[1:38:58] have my own shout and my own unique
[1:39:01] dance. And I didn't want to look like
[1:39:03] anyone else. I just wanted my own my own
[1:39:06] experience. And I didn't tell anybody
[1:39:09] because it was super last minute. And I
[1:39:13] get up to the prayer line
[1:39:15] and I don't know if it happens to anyone
[1:39:17] else, but every single prayer line I've
[1:39:18] gone through, the minister that preaches
[1:39:21] never gets to pray for me fully cuz
[1:39:22] Brother Wayne grabs me.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:29] Doesn't even let him. Just grabs me,
[1:39:32] speaks directly to me and tells me that
[1:39:35] he says, "Lord, you've given her every
[1:39:37] dream. You're making her dreams come
[1:39:39] true. I'm getting I got engaged and he
[1:39:43] said, "Make one more come true for her."
[1:39:46] And after that, I don't really remember
[1:39:48] much. And I specifically remember
[1:39:51] brother Matt McClard saying, "Uh, may my
[1:39:54] wall of Jericho fall tonight."
[1:39:57] And he says directly, "Give her her own
[1:40:01] unique shout." And I started yelling and
[1:40:04] the rest of the prayer line, people
[1:40:06] praying over my marriage and helping me
[1:40:08] to be a wife and a mom. one day and I
[1:40:10] just I and I had health issues right
[1:40:13] before the c the service that night.
[1:40:16] super weak in my knees and it was just
[1:40:19] really struggling that service and I was
[1:40:21] like man I cannot tonight and I every
[1:40:25] other prayer line I've been in my legs
[1:40:27] go out you know I have to be carried out
[1:40:29] and this one I walked I fully walked and
[1:40:32] was just led to a seat and I'm sh still
[1:40:34] shouting all the way to my seat and I'm
[1:40:36] praying and uh I don't even know if this
[1:40:39] she remembers this but sister Angela
[1:40:41] came and started praying over me and
[1:40:44] started speaking in tongues
[1:40:46] And I got a second experience and
[1:40:48] started yelling again. I couldn't even
[1:40:49] sit still while I was kneeling. I'm
[1:40:51] slamming my head on the seat in front of
[1:40:52] me and don't even know it. And I'm
[1:40:54] leaning forward and just just enjoying
[1:40:57] the presence of the Lord and still
[1:40:58] screaming out. And my mom told me she
[1:41:01] could hear somebody but didn't know. I
[1:41:02] was like, "That was me."
[1:41:05] And uh we're I'm testifying to them and
[1:41:08] I wasn't planning on testifying tonight.
[1:41:10] And my mom told me, "You need to tell
[1:41:12] somebody." I told Cara at the coffee
[1:41:15] shop and lucky brother Wayne walks in
[1:41:17] and he didn't get to hear it
[1:41:20] but I just I he specifically got what my
[1:41:24] priority was right before the prayer
[1:41:26] line and I'm still believing for the
[1:41:27] things I went through to come and uh you
[1:41:31] know what she probably doesn't want me.
[1:41:34] Abigail has a testimony of her own. My
[1:41:38] little sister has had nervousness for a
[1:41:39] very long time.
[1:41:42] Um she's seen a lot and he hurt a lot
[1:41:45] and she's just even at a young age has
[1:41:47] had a lot of mind battles keeps her up
[1:41:50] at night. She cries
[1:41:53] and she she's very attached and with
[1:41:55] this change coming it's going to be very
[1:41:57] hard and there was no climax in the
[1:42:01] service and I think it was brother Josh
[1:42:03] or brother and one of them brother
[1:42:05] Andrew was preaching and said
[1:42:08] specifically about nervousness give way
[1:42:11] and my sister starts screaming out and
[1:42:13] jumping. She had to hold on to the seat
[1:42:15] in front of her and she's just jumping
[1:42:17] up and down. A lot of a lot of people
[1:42:19] saw it and she ended up falling flat to
[1:42:22] the floor just screaming out to the Lord
[1:42:24] about nervousness and she claimed it.
[1:42:26] She's standing here today. She's fine at
[1:42:28] 9 years old.
[1:42:31] [Applause]
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:44] I uh I know we're uh keeping the
[1:42:46] testimonies focused on the camp, but a
[1:42:48] lot of our young people go to the school
[1:42:50] here. Brother Richard u has a testimony
[1:42:52] to share about what the Lord's doing
[1:42:54] there.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, as uh Nathan said, this testimony
[1:42:58] is about the school. Um the as many uh
[1:43:01] Bible believers school there in Lima,
[1:43:03] many of you know it, many of you young
[1:43:05] folks attend there. Um the about 15
[1:43:08] months ago, I think it was the DAO
[1:43:10] Foundation that uh funded the school for
[1:43:12] 40 plus years found they were out of
[1:43:15] money and um it was a real existential
[1:43:18] crisis. The school was going to have to
[1:43:19] close. Bottom line. So we worked real
[1:43:22] hard. Many people uh prayed and worked
[1:43:25] on that. We worked out that we could get
[1:43:27] a charter from the state. We worked out
[1:43:29] we wouldn't have to teach about Paul and
[1:43:32] his two dads. We wouldn't have to teach
[1:43:34] common core math. We wouldn't have to
[1:43:35] compromise on our standards. We wouldn't
[1:43:37] have to. We wouldn't have to. Nothing.
[1:43:39] So, credit to Am I allowed to give
[1:43:42] credit to Republican government in state
[1:43:44] of Ohio for that? Okay. Seriously. So,
[1:43:48] no compromise is needed and that's a
[1:43:50] amazing thing. So, we applied for the
[1:43:53] charter. Um I just realized sitting here
[1:43:56] um they the state needs has to come and
[1:44:00] inspect the school. They will they won't
[1:44:02] do that in the last week of school. So
[1:44:04] the last day they would come was May the
[1:44:07] 16th and they couldn't come because they
[1:44:09] had so many things going on. Um and they
[1:44:12] made a special exception and they came
[1:44:13] on May the 20th. I just looked that up.
[1:44:16] It suddenly struck me. Any of you good
[1:44:17] at math? The difference between 16 and
[1:44:19] 20 is 4 days. They were 4 days late. And
[1:44:24] we got the charter. So we got that in
[1:44:26] June. So this is just two months ago.
[1:44:28] And uh so you know we've been working on
[1:44:31] the budget and what can we afford and so
[1:44:34] on and uh we sat there in a board
[1:44:37] meeting about just about a month ago and
[1:44:40] we're looking at all the numbers. How
[1:44:42] much will we get from the charters the
[1:44:44] SGOs's that many of you gave to you know
[1:44:47] you redirected your tax money from
[1:44:49] giving to the state of Ohio to giving to
[1:44:51] Bible believer school. Thank you raised
[1:44:53] 60,000 from that. Thank you to everybody
[1:44:56] who contributed to that uh and
[1:44:58] redirected your tax money. We will be
[1:45:00] doing that again this year by the way.
[1:45:02] So uh get ready for that. Um but the we
[1:45:06] looked at all the numbers and it was
[1:45:07] just really tight. We had 69 students
[1:45:10] enrolled which was up which was answer
[1:45:12] to prayer and it was super tight and
[1:45:14] we're looking through all the numbers
[1:45:15] and we could do it but it was just
[1:45:17] tight. It was pressure on all the
[1:45:19] different categories. There's pressure
[1:45:21] on could we you know do this do that. It
[1:45:23] was just really tight. So, I remember I
[1:45:25] I was sitting there. I'm looking at all
[1:45:26] the numbers and playing with them and it
[1:45:28] just struck me that we needed we had 69.
[1:45:30] We just needed to get to 80. I felt like
[1:45:33] if we could get to 80 and I put that 80
[1:45:35] in the spreadsheet and everything looked
[1:45:36] better. The numbers look better. The
[1:45:38] numbers look fine. I said and I looked
[1:45:40] up I remember I looked up straight but
[1:45:41] brother Paul Priest was sitting right
[1:45:43] opposite me. I said, "Brother Paul,
[1:45:44] looks like we need to get to 80." And he
[1:45:46] looked straight back and said, "Yeah, I
[1:45:47] worked out the same thing. 80 students.
[1:45:49] That's what we need." So, I said, "Well,
[1:45:51] that's that's that's what we're going to
[1:45:53] pray for. 80 students there. So, so that
[1:45:57] was that was a month that was less than
[1:45:58] a month ago. I think it was about 3
[1:45:59] weeks. We're at 69 and then we got
[1:46:02] another three and then we got another
[1:46:04] four and if I get the math wrong,
[1:46:06] forgive me. And we got another two and
[1:46:07] we got to 78
[1:46:10] and that was uh last week. School
[1:46:12] started yesterday, by the way. So, it
[1:46:14] was last week we got to 78. And I was
[1:46:16] like, "Praise God, 78." Difference
[1:46:18] between 78 and 80, who cares? It's fine.
[1:46:21] But God cared. God cared. School started
[1:46:24] yesterday. On Monday, we got final two
[1:46:28] registrations to get to exactly 80. Not
[1:46:31] 81, not 79, but exactly to what we were
[1:46:36] praying for. So, I just want to give
[1:46:38] glory to God. Um, you know, so many of
[1:46:41] you have prayed and helped with the
[1:46:42] school. Again, it was like the school
[1:46:44] was literally going to have to close,
[1:46:46] but as of now, we got more students than
[1:46:48] we've had. I don't know if it's forever
[1:46:50] because uh but for a very long time for
[1:46:52] 20 plus years that's more students than
[1:46:54] we've ever had at the school. U I was
[1:46:56] there for opening day yesterday and many
[1:46:59] of you were there new teachers and so on
[1:47:01] and there was just such a joy and such a
[1:47:04] peace and such a reassurance from God
[1:47:06] that he was behind the efforts 100% and
[1:47:10] he was so gracious that he didn't give
[1:47:12] us didn't settle for 78. I settled for
[1:47:14] 78. Good grief. He gave us exactly the
[1:47:18] number we were praying for. So, I just
[1:47:20] want to give all glory to God. Thank
[1:47:21] you, Lord.
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:27] Like to get just one or two more of the
[1:47:30] young people if we can and then we'll
[1:47:32] probably bring it down to a close
[1:47:34] tonight. Here you buddy.
[1:47:40] um more related about camp, but uh so
[1:47:43] for a while I've been struggling with
[1:47:46] like anxiety for like what people would
[1:47:49] think about me if I did a certain thing.
[1:47:52] And brother Andrew was preaching about
[1:47:56] like fear and anxiety is under our feet
[1:47:59] and hope it's gone now.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:02] [Applause]
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:11] if the musicians want to comment.
[1:48:16] I uh don't usually do this. It's my
[1:48:19] first time here and my first time at
[1:48:21] camp this year
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; and it really opened my eyes. Um I just
[1:48:27] want to thank the Lord for that and I
[1:48:30] want to thank the Lord for the
[1:48:31] opportunity of going to camp this year.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Um that's all. Thank you.
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; That's brother Kaden. If you want to go
[1:48:46] up and say hi after service and make him
[1:48:48] feel welcome among us. We're sure happy
[1:48:50] to have him. Um, in my thanks uh of
[1:48:55] everybody, of course, I left somebody
[1:48:56] out. Got reminded
[1:48:59] uh forgot to thank the soundmen. Ain't
[1:49:01] that a classic?
[1:49:04] So, if you can hear me through this
[1:49:06] microphone, why don't you why don't you
[1:49:08] appreciate the sound, man?
[1:49:11] [Applause]
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:20] If you don't mind me slipping in a
[1:49:22] personal testimony just at the end here
[1:49:23] as we close. Um last year uh my wife had
[1:49:27] a surgery kind of a post-natal hernia
[1:49:29] surgery and uh something happened with
[1:49:32] the anesthesia there. Uh she reacted to
[1:49:35] it really badly and ever since then um
[1:49:38] we've had a real battle with anxiety. uh
[1:49:40] just right around the time the sun would
[1:49:42] go down a nervousness would come in just
[1:49:45] you know just irrational and knowing
[1:49:47] it's irrational but um just that just
[1:49:49] those physical symptoms of that uh been
[1:49:52] and different things feeding into that
[1:49:54] so it's been a battle uh so you know uh
[1:49:59] coming Saturday night uh brother
[1:50:02] Andrew's preaching just on speaking the
[1:50:04] word and a point that he made just
[1:50:06] settled my heart the inspiration came uh
[1:50:09] so clearly to me that it was time it was
[1:50:11] time to say speak something to that
[1:50:13] situation. So I just uh I just began to
[1:50:16] rebuke that spirit that's been working
[1:50:18] in my home and uh and and just going in
[1:50:21] for that kill. You know this is this is
[1:50:23] it driving down a steak. Um you know
[1:50:26] right at just just within moments of
[1:50:28] that brother Andrew took a little turn.
[1:50:31] He began to tell a story about brother
[1:50:32] Brandham talking to a mother. Remember
[1:50:34] back in the left corner and uh and uh it
[1:50:37] just was so precisely, you know, to to
[1:50:40] the fears that come and torment a
[1:50:42] mother's mind who's dealing with
[1:50:43] nervousness and those different things.
[1:50:45] And I and I I looked and I looked, you
[1:50:47] know, uh where Cheyenne would usually be
[1:50:49] sitting. I thought, "Oh, she's out with
[1:50:51] the baby." You know, you know how it is
[1:50:53] for a mother. Uh they they they just
[1:50:55] can't be in the service all the time. I
[1:50:57] thought, "Ah, she's she's not hearing
[1:50:58] this." But I I still knew it was the
[1:51:00] Lord. But then I looked over this way
[1:51:02] and for the first time the whole weekend
[1:51:04] she had come in that left door and she
[1:51:06] was right where brother Andrew was
[1:51:08] pointing and describing brother Brandham
[1:51:10] dealing with that issue. I could just
[1:51:11] see on her countenance that the Lord was
[1:51:13] working on that end too. And by the
[1:51:15] grace of God uh from that time uh sun
[1:51:18] up, sun down, uh fear and nervousness
[1:51:21] has left our home. That devil's
[1:51:23] defeated.
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:33] You know, that that was such a a major
[1:51:35] point in the ministry this weekend. Uh
[1:51:37] such a major thing that our young people
[1:51:39] are dealing with. And it just you could
[1:51:40] feel it in the air uh from the first day
[1:51:43] on the camp. Just a a tension and a
[1:51:46] nervousness there. And uh and and so,
[1:51:49] you know, the devil was really fighting
[1:51:51] the meeting in general with that spirit.
[1:51:53] But uh but you know as as uh by that
[1:51:56] Saturday night as the faith was
[1:51:58] beginning to build from the ministry of
[1:51:59] the word, you could just feel that slip
[1:52:01] away from the room. See so many young
[1:52:03] people get a breakthrough. And I believe
[1:52:05] a son or daughter of God doesn't have to
[1:52:07] carry fear.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to carry
[1:52:10] nervousness. Amen. There there's no fear
[1:52:12] in love. Amen. But we've been given the
[1:52:15] spirit of power. Amen. Of love. Of a
[1:52:18] sound mind. And so we just thank God for
[1:52:20] deliverance. Thank God for victory.
[1:52:22] Amen. And uh how many how how many just
[1:52:24] just in a general testimony, how many
[1:52:27] were got a special touch from the Lord
[1:52:28] at camp? Amen. How many how many got
[1:52:31] something out of the ministry? How many
[1:52:33] enjoyed yourself in worship? How many
[1:52:35] just had a good time? Hasn't hasn't God
[1:52:37] been good. Amen. God is so good,
[1:52:40] friends, and we've been so blessed and
[1:52:42] Amen. It's just not hard to see what the
[1:52:44] Lord has done. So no wonder we got a
[1:52:46] heart of worship. I mean, how could we
[1:52:48] not praise him for everything that he
[1:52:50] has done? and he's poured out abundantly
[1:52:52] of his blessings, of his goodness, and
[1:52:54] and we just appreciate him for it. Amen.
[1:52:56] How many love the Lord? Amen. Let's just
[1:52:59] uh take a few moments to worship him
[1:53:01] then. You got a song
[1:53:04] to me.
[1:53:06] Precious are his thoughts of you and me.
[1:53:14] No way I could count. Maybe you'd like
[1:53:17] to stand and just make this your
[1:53:18] testimony.
[1:53:21] Oh, so I'll just thank him for being so
[1:53:28] kind.
[1:53:30] God has been good,
[1:53:34] so
[1:53:36] good.
[1:53:38] I have been blessed

[1:53:45] when he walks among us.
[1:53:49] All that he does.
[1:53:53] All of his mercy
[1:53:57] and all of his love.
[1:54:00] If the pen of the rider
[1:54:05] could ride every day,
[1:54:09] even this world
[1:54:12] could never contain.
[1:54:16] How much I' been blessed.
[1:54:24] I have been blessed.

[1:54:48] Oh, just thank you for
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:55] God.
[1:54:59] So
[1:55:01] good.

[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:07] the rock that I
[1:55:10] the rock that I
[1:55:14] [Music]

[1:55:22] shows me the way
[1:55:26] the word is
[1:55:30] in your
[1:55:35] song.
[1:55:37] He's a reason
[1:55:42] we have been
[1:55:44] singing again. He's the rock that I
[1:55:47] stand on. He's the rock that I stand on.
[1:55:53] In a trouble someday
[1:55:57] his presence he hides me. He shows me
[1:56:02] the way.
[1:56:04] The word in its fullness
[1:56:09] in you and me.
[1:56:12] He's not just a song.
[1:56:16] He's a reality.
[1:56:20] We have been blessed.
[1:56:26] Oh,
[1:56:28] I have been blessed.
[1:56:31] God so good to me.
[1:56:35] Oh, precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:56:41] me. No way I could count him. There's
[1:56:47] not enough time.
[1:56:51] So, I'll just thank him for being so
[1:56:57] kind.
[1:56:59] God has been good.
[1:57:03] So
[1:57:05] good.
[1:57:07] I have been blessed.
[1:57:12] Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; God has been good.
[1:57:20] So

[1:57:32] you? God has been good.

[1:57:41] I have been blessed.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful testimony of the
[1:57:49] wonderful things that God has done. And
[1:57:52] Amen. to uh to see the the glory and the
[1:57:55] power and the contact the Holy Spirit
[1:57:57] has made with these youth. Amen. into
[1:58:00] the youth meetings, the camp. Amen. I
[1:58:03] think it's turned into more than just a
[1:58:05] youth meeting. Amen. Everyone's hearts
[1:58:07] are are excited and not just for our
[1:58:09] church, but for the community and those
[1:58:11] that are around it. And we want to thank
[1:58:13] the Lord for it. And we certainly uh
[1:58:16] appreciate each one of you that has been
[1:58:18] involved in this. And I want to thank
[1:58:20] Nathan, Amen, for his for his dedication
[1:58:23] to this and and the hours uh that he
[1:58:26] places in it. And of course, uh, they
[1:58:29] they call them Uncle Nate and Uncle
[1:58:31] Ronnie at the camp. And, uh, I hear
[1:58:33] everywhere I go, uh, people talking
[1:58:36] about these camps. They said, "Man, we
[1:58:37] are so blessed." I was just sharing the
[1:58:40] meeting with Brother Donnie Reagan
[1:58:41] there. I missed the Thursday night
[1:58:43] because we were doing the mission camp
[1:58:44] meeting there. And Brother Reagan said
[1:58:47] to me, he said, "Brother Wayne," he
[1:58:48] said, "Some of the young people, my
[1:58:49] granddaughters, they enjoy that camp
[1:58:51] above all they do through the year. They
[1:58:53] just so enjoy that camp." and and we we
[1:58:56] appreciate the Lord for allowing uh this
[1:58:58] to be a great blessing to them. And you
[1:59:01] know, u we we thank brother Nathan for
[1:59:03] that. He's kind of a he's a real kind of
[1:59:05] a little bit of a political diplomatic
[1:59:07] fell at times. He sent me the the final
[1:59:10] bill for this camp just before the
[1:59:12] testimony service.
[1:59:15] Uh I felt a lot better about it after
[1:59:18] the testimony service. I I was I was
[1:59:24] I was making the figures come out per
[1:59:26] testimony. I think I'm doing pretty good
[1:59:28] now. This is this feels a lot better.
[1:59:34] It's not too late for you to for you to
[1:59:36] get involved.
[1:59:39] Amen. So, but uh it's it's uh if our
[1:59:43] trustees and our senior pastor for
[1:59:46] forgive me for my expenditures over the
[1:59:48] weekend, I think it's money well spent.
[1:59:50] And we so appreciate each of you for
[1:59:53] your giving. And we so we so love you
[1:59:55] all. And my heart is full. I
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; I uh sit here tonight and listen to
[2:00:00] these things. If I talk much, I'll I'll
[2:00:02] be crying ugly as Hannah says. Uh my
[2:00:06] heart is so full to hear of the wonders
[2:00:09] and the riches
[2:00:11] of of the God of Abraham. How that he
[2:00:14] would visit our our humble abodess and
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; uh that he would step behind uh this
[2:00:21] this presence would come and minister
[2:00:24] and make real this. If you heard these
[2:00:27] testimonies, you hear a lot. He he did
[2:00:30] this and he did that. And
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; I just love to hear that that Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; He talking about that wonder, wonderful,
[2:00:38] awesome, wonderful God. And I I love the
[2:00:41] um how, you know, God uses men, but I
[2:00:44] loved how much was spoken about him
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; and not so much about the minister or
[2:00:51] the one doing the praying,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; but the God that was doing the touching.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I'm so thankful for that
[2:00:57] tonight that we're setting him forward
[2:01:00] as being the living God who ministers
[2:01:03] and touches and and these these great uh
[2:01:06] prayer meetings uh have been effective
[2:01:08] and each of you that chose children and
[2:01:11] youth through this through this time and
[2:01:13] your prayers uh I know that you've been
[2:01:15] rewarded in hearing how God has
[2:01:18] ministered and what he's done. And we we
[2:01:20] want to thank you each of you. And I I
[2:01:23] was just listening to some of the camp
[2:01:24] songs and um I I I'm so proud of what's
[2:01:28] what's happening with our youth and the
[2:01:31] development of the gifts and uh the the
[2:01:34] refining of these these musicians and
[2:01:37] brother Ben, sister Lily that they're
[2:01:39] spending so much effort and work in in
[2:01:42] bringing out these wonderful gifts and
[2:01:44] this youth and the choirs and things and
[2:01:46] and you know, but uh we were just
[2:01:49] listening to it on the way to church.
[2:01:50] Um, no fear. I just we were we were just
[2:01:54] moving to that no fear and Chris and I
[2:01:56] were just discussing the the choirs and
[2:01:59] and we were discussing the cleanness of

[2:02:04] beautiful young ladies. the the I don't
[2:02:07] you parents are blessed with you
[2:02:08] beautiful young ladies and but but but
[2:02:11] modest and godly and and it it is just
[2:02:15] brother brother Ray is just such a
[2:02:17] testament
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; to the cleanness of this gospel and not
[2:02:22] that we beat everybody up every week
[2:02:24] with a with a standard but there's a
[2:02:26] there's a spirit that exists in this
[2:02:28] church
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; that people want to live right and they
[2:02:31] want to dress right and and I I thank

[2:02:51] we love you so much and thank you for
[2:02:53] that. Amen. And Amen. Brother, uh just
[2:02:56] as we would maybe just close our eyes
[2:02:58] and bow our hearts and let's just have a
[2:03:00] word. Sorry, sister Martin. Okay. Yeah,
[2:03:05] sister Becca uh Mark and and brother
[2:03:08] Seth are not here tonight. Becca's
[2:03:09] having having some issues and we need to

[2:03:14] prayer tonight.
[2:03:16] Father, as we bow our hearts tonight and
[2:03:19] Lord, with our hearts so full,
[2:03:22] we want to thank you from the depths of
[2:03:23] our soul. I want to thank you for all
[2:03:26] that you've done, Lord. And Lord, you're
[2:03:29] you're such a faithful God. how the
[2:03:32] sisters started this service singing
[2:03:34] about your faithfulness and how we've
[2:03:37] seen it through the years. We've seen
[2:03:39] you faithfully, Lord, how you answer the
[2:03:41] hearts and how you've met them and and
[2:03:44] Lord, to hear time after time that you
[2:03:46] would that you would meet these young
[2:03:48] people in their need and then Lord, give
[2:03:50] them a testimony that you're alive. I
[2:03:52] thank you for it. And tonight we ask you
[2:03:55] for Becca, Lord, that you would touch
[2:03:56] her body, that you would strengthen her,
[2:03:59] Lord, that whatever this is that's
[2:04:01] resting on her, Father, that you would
[2:04:03] break the powers of it even now, Lord,

[2:04:09] Satan, you are defeated.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; My Lord conquered you 2,000 years ago at
[2:04:16] Calvary, and you're a defeated enemy.
[2:04:20] And we rebuke you, Satan, that you take
[2:04:23] your hands away from God's children.

[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; This is my theme song lately. I feel
[2:05:12] blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I
[2:05:17] go to sleep each night.
[2:05:21] Though I've had my share of hard times,
[2:05:26] wouldn't change them if I could.

[2:05:35] God's been true.
[2:05:39] [Music]
[2:05:41] Lately, I've been looking back along
[2:05:46] this winding road
[2:05:50] to the old familar
[2:05:53] markers
[2:05:54] of the mercies as I have.
[2:06:00] I know it may sound simple,
[2:06:04] but it's more than a shame.
[2:06:09] There's no better way to tell you than
[2:06:14] to say
[2:06:18] God's been
[2:06:22] in my life.
[2:06:28] I feel bless
[2:06:33] when I go to sleep.
[2:06:38] Though I had my share of hard times, I
[2:06:43] wouldn't change everything if I could.
[2:06:47] Cuz through it all,
[2:06:52] God
[2:06:58] times we play. And I can see that I've
[2:07:03] cried some bit tears.
[2:07:08] But I've felt his arms around me
[2:07:12] as I face my greatest fears.
[2:07:17] You see, I've had more gaze than loses.
[2:07:22] And I no more joy later
[2:07:27] as his grace roll down upon me
[2:07:32] uner.
[2:07:36] Oh God
[2:07:38] saints you're dismissed
[2:07:41] in my life.
[2:07:46] I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams
[2:07:51] when I go to sleep each night.
[2:07:56] And though I've had my share of hard
[2:08:00] times, I wouldn't change them if I
[2:08:04] could.
[2:08:06] Cuz through it all,
[2:08:11] God's been good.
[2:08:16] God's been good.
[2:08:19] God's been good in my life.
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:27] I feel blessed beyond the wild dreams
[2:08:32] when I go to sleep each night.
