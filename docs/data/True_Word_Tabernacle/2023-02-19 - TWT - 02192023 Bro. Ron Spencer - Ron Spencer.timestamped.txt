[48:23] church this is God's church but
[48:25] sometimes we just need to stop and think
[48:29] thank God for what he has done
[48:31] you remember there was men that came
[48:34] back to Jesus to thank him
[48:36] and it's very important to stop and
[48:38] thank him for what he has done
[48:42] and no man with his own energies will
[48:44] produce anything if you do it with your
[48:47] own energies you'll only make a mistake
[48:50] and so we are very aware of those things
[48:53] if if we can just just move ourselves
[48:55] out of the way
[48:57] I've been friends with Brother Ray
[48:59] Erickson
[49:01] for way too many years
[49:04] the first time I saw Brother Ray I was
[49:06] speaking at the Tabernacle in over over
[49:09] the way where brother Jonathan's at
[49:12] and I had been invited I think there was
[49:14] about 40 people there
[49:16] and I preached a sermon called the
[49:18] autopsy of the Dead Church
[49:22] no don't get scared I'm not going to
[49:25] preach it today
[49:29] and I remembered as a man sat on the
[49:31] aisle and he had his foot about halfway
[49:33] out in the aisle
[49:35] he had dark hair
[49:37] presence of God just emulated out of him
[49:40] brother Tom Brown came to the Altar and
[49:43] just
[49:43] just bellowed and we prayed together for
[49:47] quite a while and I walked into the
[49:49] pastor studied and he and brother Isaiah
[49:52] Brooks said do you know who you prayed
[49:54] for at the altar and I said no this is
[49:56] my first time here I don't know anybody
[49:59] he said that's Tom Brown
[50:01] I said well and we became great friends
[50:04] but I said I want to know who the guy is
[50:06] that had his foot out in the aisle
[50:09] I like that guy he said that's Ray
[50:12] Erickson
[50:18] Ray asked me to come the first time and
[50:20] I was busy I couldn't come
[50:22] I told him no
[50:24] he asked me again a bit later and I told
[50:26] him no
[50:29] you know three times his charms and so
[50:32] I've been coming now way too many years
[50:34] and so
[50:36] amen I found Brother Ray to be a real
[50:39] man of God
[50:42] Ray is a legend in his own time
[50:45] he's a Powerhouse
[50:48] he operates with such power and such
[50:50] humility at the same time it's just
[50:53] just incredible
[50:55] he he's a visionary
[50:58] you guys came from Astoria
[51:00] to the church Downtown
[51:02] to where he was and I preached that so
[51:04] many
[51:06] and then and then here you are
[51:09] and his vision has not diminished you're
[51:12] about to build a new church I hope I'm
[51:14] not giving you news
[51:15] foreign
[51:22] you won't do it as one man you'll do it
[51:25] as a team
[51:27] and he'd been a phenomenal Minister for
[51:31] many
[51:32] to see
[51:34] how it's to be done well
[51:37] so a lot of people do it and they do it
[51:42] but he's done it well
[51:45] the atmosphere in this church is kind of
[51:47] like my home Church
[51:49] I like that
[51:51] you're easy people to preach to you come
[51:54] hungry you come ready
[51:56] you're a team here you're not pulling
[51:58] against one another throwing rocks at
[52:00] one another you're a team
[52:03] you just find your place in the body we
[52:06] don't need Stars we just need
[52:08] we just need family
[52:11] brother Ray's family is a is an example
[52:14] of how it is how it's to be done
[52:17] if you would want a picture of the
[52:20] message of the hour and what family is
[52:23] you do not need
[52:25] a six-week course on how to raise a
[52:29] family this message tells you everything
[52:31] that you need
[52:33] and if you want pictures of how it is
[52:35] race family does that and so I've
[52:38] watched them as they grow and we're
[52:40] getting gray hair now grandchildren are
[52:43] coming and a lot of them
[52:47] and we can see that this message wasn't
[52:51] just a Revival to Brother Ray and his
[52:54] wife but it became to his children
[52:57] and then the flame went to his
[52:59] children's children
[53:00] Will Go On
[53:03] because it's God's work
[53:05] Brother Ray thank you
[53:22] I'm not done Brother Ray
[53:27] one of the qualities of Brother Ray is
[53:29] he wasn't a kingdom Builder
[53:34] and I just I'm not here to fix 30 years
[53:39] but he should have been the pastor of
[53:41] this area a long time ago
[53:45] but when politics gets into anything
[53:48] politics whether they're in Washington
[53:50] or in a church
[53:52] is that the devil
[53:56] if you need that said again I can do
[53:57] that for you
[54:00] and brother Ray didn't let politics rule
[54:03] his gift
[54:04] as a matter of fact it only magnified
[54:06] through the years
[54:08] it wasn't about how many people was in
[54:10] the crowd
[54:13] it just continued to work
[54:16] when I first came here brother Ray was
[54:18] working
[54:19] and he kept working and he kept working
[54:22] and then he became a full-time Pastor
[54:24] here which he was before but he had two
[54:27] jobs three jobs
[54:29] and it was a job to raise Ben
[54:40] brother a can look at his family
[54:43] and see them take leadership in the in
[54:45] this church
[54:47] he can be proud
[54:49] that it lives
[54:52] he wasn't a kingdom Builder
[54:56] but even great Kings
[54:59] as they see themselves age they want to
[55:01] see their work go on
[55:04] I would say there's a lot of churches
[55:06] around the message very jealous of what
[55:08] has just happened here
[55:10] because you just didn't get anybody to
[55:12] to be their pastor
[55:15] you got one of the greatest preachers on
[55:18] the Earth
[55:21] haven't got my offering yet so
[55:40] all these years he's been right here
[55:42] with you working as a team member
[55:46] and I don't know if you you do any study
[55:49] in history but this guy reminds me he's
[55:51] a country boy but he reminds me of a man
[55:54] named Feeney
[55:55] Finney was a liar
[55:58] Finney had the Holy Ghost
[56:00] and Finney would preach and five miles
[56:02] down the road they would drop their
[56:04] lunch boxes and give their heart to
[56:05] Jesus Christ
[56:08] I knew brother Wayne as a as a young man
[56:11] as he began to preach he's not just one
[56:14] of the boys
[56:15] I don't think that we lift each other up
[56:17] or try to lift each other up it's God
[56:20] that places the gift
[56:23] he didn't go to school
[56:26] he was just a kid on the river
[56:30] doing fishing
[56:32] he never asked for any of these
[56:34] accolades or anything all he wanted to
[56:37] do was serve the Lord
[56:39] I thought it was a tremendous thing for
[56:42] him to come and work with Brother Ray
[56:43] these years
[56:44] I've applauded it I've shouted it to the
[56:47] moon and and back and to the Stars again
[56:52] because Brother Ray had qualities that
[56:54] he would need in his leadership skills
[56:58] now brother Ray's loved this church and
[57:01] he loved his work and he loves you as
[57:02] people
[57:03] he's not finished
[57:08] it's kind of like a
[57:11] an old fire horse
[57:14] you know it used to be they they dropped
[57:16] the water wagons with a with horses
[57:20] you know that hook she was young one day
[57:23] and he could run probably faster than
[57:25] them all
[57:26] and he was hooked to other horses
[57:28] sometimes four six eight horses and they
[57:31] ran with all of their plight and that
[57:33] lead horses not very kind of knew where
[57:35] the fire was yeah had a sense inside of
[57:37] me
[57:39] but there come a day that his steps were
[57:41] a little slower
[57:43] didn't mean he wasn't still a great
[57:45] horse
[57:46] but his steps were slower
[57:48] he couldn't get to the fire in time
[57:53] so what they did was
[57:55] they just simply put him in the in the
[57:58] barn
[57:59] you know that old Bell would ring
[58:03] and he'd come out of that Barn charging
[58:06] and he ran all the way down about a mile
[58:09] with those horses just running with
[58:11] everything that was within him
[58:13] and he come to the fence
[58:16] and they would go on
[58:18] now whether you knew it or not he was
[58:21] thanking God for the fence
[58:35] now family I want to just tell you
[58:36] you're going to watch your pastor be
[58:39] more relaxed
[58:41] than ever before
[58:43] you're going to see him enjoy services
[58:47] like never before
[58:49] and when he preached he's charged his
[58:52] wagon he's been ready for for a month
[58:54] and now all of a sudden he gets to he
[58:56] gets to preach and he preaches and then
[58:59] he goes thank God for the fence
[59:04] and then he hears a little problem in
[59:06] the church and he said Wayne
[59:13] this is your baby
[59:16] I know
[59:26] but what you don't understand is God's
[59:29] did it all
[59:32] and so I would like to stop and
[59:33] congratulate you
[59:36] I'm probably not like anybody else that
[59:38] you'll have in but
[59:40] I can't say hello in five minutes so
[59:44] but I'd like to congratulate you as an
[59:46] audience
[59:48] for your prayer
[59:50] and there'll be some transition that'll
[59:53] seem kind of bumpy on the way don't you
[59:56] worry
[59:57] you'll get to the pavement soon enough
[1:00:01] and what God's going to need not just
[1:00:03] from you and brother Reagan from Wayne
[1:00:06] brother Wayne
[1:00:08] he's going to need you to stay a team
[1:00:11] need you to stay a body
[1:00:14] because brother Wayne didn't go to a
[1:00:16] school somewhere
[1:00:18] could be a pastor
[1:00:20] he's going to learn from that guy
[1:00:21] sitting in the back with a cough
[1:00:25] so brother Wayne brother Ray's not mad
[1:00:27] at me and moved to the back he told me
[1:00:30] he said I got a call
[1:00:31] so be careful when you shake his hand
[1:00:42] I want to say I love you
[1:00:45] brother Wayne's Ministry is going to
[1:00:46] change he's been an evangelist he could
[1:00:49] take that sermon that was so inspired
[1:00:52] and preached a hundred times and make it
[1:00:54] feel as fresh as it's ever been but now
[1:00:56] he's going to be a pastor
[1:00:58] and so as a pastor he's going to be with
[1:01:01] you you know as an evangelist you hit
[1:01:03] and run you're hit and run you're Hit
[1:01:05] and Run
[1:01:07] some of you know you got some you don't
[1:01:09] know you got but now as a pastor he's
[1:01:11] going to be with you for the Long Haul
[1:01:14] and he's going to watch you mature
[1:01:17] and the difference with the pastor he
[1:01:19] has to be patient with you
[1:01:24] he has to watch you grow from a baby
[1:01:26] change her diapers
[1:01:30] then after a while you'll learn to eat
[1:01:32] on your own you'll throw food on the
[1:01:34] floor
[1:01:37] but he can't throw you out in the road
[1:01:40] because now he's your pastor
[1:01:44] and he's going to watch you make
[1:01:46] mistakes and he knows I can't
[1:01:47] micromanage them and be there to hold
[1:01:49] their hand all the time but but I'm here
[1:01:51] for you
[1:01:52] and he's going to watch you grow and
[1:01:55] and one day we'll all be in heaven
[1:02:00] and we'll thank Brother Ray and brother
[1:02:02] Wayne and this team sitting here
[1:02:05] Brother Ray can look at this group of
[1:02:07] young men and his grandsons
[1:02:11] boy what a job they did at brother Tim
[1:02:13] pritz the other day
[1:02:14] this church was showcased by these boys
[1:02:17] preaching
[1:02:21] and that big tall guy right there well
[1:02:23] they're all tall to me
[1:02:29] yeah
[1:02:31] but that big tall guy on Sunday morning
[1:02:33] he just he just blew the place up and
[1:02:38] and you started it out on
[1:02:41] Friday night
[1:02:43] and you didn't act a bit nervous
[1:02:45] as a matter of fact it was so great
[1:02:47] until you came to my church a few weeks
[1:02:49] ago and
[1:02:50] well that boy don't he looks like he's
[1:02:52] been preaching for a long time
[1:02:55] Brother Ray if you want to set your
[1:02:56] ministry at work
[1:02:58] there it is
[1:03:00] I'd like to say thank you

[1:03:23] only one of me nobody's going to copy me
[1:03:25] or impersonate me they might do that to
[1:03:27] other preachers but they won't do me so

[1:06:15] with me this morning
[1:06:16] hope you haven't started your clock yet
[1:06:19] because I haven't started mine
[1:06:35] they're mine
[1:06:37] Matthew Chapter 13 and we read the whole
[1:06:40] scripture last
[1:06:43] last night but we'll read a portion
[1:06:48] and the same day went Jesus out of the
[1:06:52] house and set by the seaside
[1:06:54] and great multitudes were gathered
[1:06:56] together unto him
[1:06:58] so that he went into a ship and sat
[1:07:02] and the whole multitude stood on the
[1:07:05] shore
[1:07:06] and he spake many things unto them in
[1:07:09] Parables saying
[1:07:11] behold A sower
[1:07:13] went forth to sow
[1:07:16] let's go down to the end of where we
[1:07:18] read last night
[1:07:23] and the disciples came and said unto him
[1:07:26] why speaketh thou unto them in parables
[1:07:30] and he answered and said to them because
[1:07:32] it is given unto you to know the
[1:07:34] mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:07:36] but to them it is not given
[1:07:39] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[1:07:42] and he shall have more abundance
[1:07:45] but whosoever hath not
[1:07:48] from him shall be shall be taken away
[1:07:52] even that that he has
[1:07:55] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[1:07:58] because seeing
[1:08:00] because sins
[1:08:01] because they see and see not
[1:08:04] and hearing they hear not
[1:08:06] neither do they understand
[1:08:09] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:08:12] Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall
[1:08:15] hear and shall not understand and see
[1:08:19] and you shall see and shall not perceive
[1:08:22] for this people's heart is wax gross and
[1:08:26] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[1:08:29] eyes have closed less than any time they
[1:08:32] should see with their eyes and hear with
[1:08:34] their ears and and should understand
[1:08:36] with their heart and should be converted
[1:08:39] and I shall heal them
[1:08:42] I think that such a powerful statement
[1:08:45] and I shall hear heal them
[1:08:48] now he says it like this blessed are
[1:08:51] your eyes
[1:08:52] for they see and your ears for they hear
[1:08:57] for verbally I say unto you that many
[1:09:00] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:09:04] to see the things which you see and have
[1:09:06] not seen them and they hear those things
[1:09:09] which you hear
[1:09:11] have not hurt them yet you can be seated
[1:09:19] what a time we live in
[1:09:24] you're the ending of all ages
[1:09:27] God has watched over your seed since the
[1:09:30] foundation of the world
[1:09:33] that which was potential now is reality
[1:09:37] what was in God's Vision now lives
[1:09:43] thoughts are now expressed
[1:09:46] the mess delivered
[1:09:49] and it has the capacity to change your
[1:09:51] body
[1:09:53] not just cause you to live right
[1:09:56] but that's that's just part of this
[1:09:59] but it's it has the capacity the
[1:10:02] potential in it
[1:10:04] for a people is going to take the
[1:10:06] rapture
[1:10:07] your identification is rapture
[1:10:11] your identification is reflection
[1:10:14] and if we go by the way of the Grave God
[1:10:17] made us a promise that we're going to
[1:10:20] raise up on that Resurrection morning
[1:10:24] it's not a promise by a preacher it is a
[1:10:27] promise of God
[1:10:29] and the seed
[1:10:32] the seed is not destroyed when your body
[1:10:35] wears out and it longer no longer can
[1:10:39] sustain life right right yeah it may go
[1:10:43] back to the gases and the ashes but God
[1:10:47] makes a promise
[1:10:49] that on Resurrection morning he'll raise
[1:10:52] that body back up
[1:10:54] [Applause]
[1:10:56] at that point you'll never know what
[1:10:58] time is ever like or tall is ever like
[1:11:01] or death is ever like because God has
[1:11:05] designed you as an eternal being
[1:11:10] we didn't come here to build a church
[1:11:14] a bride around the world we're linked as
[1:11:17] a family you can be with somebody from
[1:11:20] South Africa
[1:11:22] just meet them and all of a sudden you
[1:11:25] realize you've been family all along
[1:11:30] and the Really the realization is you
[1:11:33] stepped out of Eternity into a space of
[1:11:36] time
[1:11:37] just like your marriage you you joined
[1:11:40] maybe maybe you meet that certain one
[1:11:43] for a certain time and and you just know
[1:11:46] she's special
[1:11:48] and you marry and you enjoy life and and
[1:11:52] energy to enjoy life you begin to raise
[1:11:54] children together if you're fortunate
[1:11:56] enough and you watch them and you watch
[1:11:58] them grow and almost overnight

[1:12:37] door
[1:12:40] kind of like a church and lay your ego
[1:12:42] down at the door
[1:12:43] you're selfishness down at the door now
[1:12:45] you're married and to become one
[1:12:49] and you enjoy marriage this ain't a
[1:12:51] marriage seminar but it is
[1:12:54] when you get the Holy Ghost your prayers
[1:12:56] are different you're eating at the table
[1:12:58] is different
[1:13:00] enjoying one another is different
[1:13:04] sure I came across a spot here a bump in
[1:13:07] the road and but I enjoy my wife more
[1:13:10] now than ever
[1:13:15] sure there's difficult days and sure
[1:13:18] there's days
[1:13:20] yourself out of the Lazy Boy seems like
[1:13:22] you want your feet to move but they just
[1:13:24] won't move you want things to happen but
[1:13:26] your body just won't make it happen but
[1:13:28] there's another round
[1:13:31] Glory
[1:13:33] can you come on Amen brother Brandon
[1:13:35] would say it like this give me a
[1:13:37] preacher
[1:13:38] give me a Christian give me a house way
[1:13:41] that's a Christian
[1:13:44] give me a farmer or a factor worker
[1:13:46] that'll put God first
[1:13:49] there's the real key when you lose your
[1:13:51] focus remember what your number one
[1:13:53] priority is it's God
[1:13:58] it's God it's not politics it's not it's
[1:14:01] not uh trying to build yourself up
[1:14:04] because we're nobody
[1:14:06] and if you want to figure out how
[1:14:08] important you are brother may I say I'm
[1:14:11] not going to do it
[1:14:12] put your finger down in a bucket of
[1:14:14] water and pull it out find a hole
[1:14:20] the important thing about you is him
[1:14:29] that'll put God first in everything I'll
[1:14:32] show you Amanda to be successful in
[1:14:34] spite of all
[1:14:36] what a statement this all that the devil
[1:14:39] can put on him he seeks God first
[1:14:43] he says we're flesh of his flesh we're
[1:14:47] bone of this bone God raised up his bone
[1:14:49] and flesh out of the grave and they
[1:14:51] cannot hide the the man that has the
[1:14:55] potentials death cannot take him
[1:14:58] Jesus said all that the father has given
[1:15:01] me
[1:15:03] will come
[1:15:05] and I'll raise him up at the last day
[1:15:09] oh my Easter while we're righted in
[1:15:12] eastern when he's raised and will and we
[1:15:15] raise with him he sent back the abstract
[1:15:19] we hold it as the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:23] Ghost
[1:15:25] what powerful statement he's about to
[1:15:27] say
[1:15:28] He Is Alive forevermore
[1:15:31] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:38] I can imagine as Paul is beginning to
[1:15:40] describe
[1:15:42] as we're speaking today and I maybe
[1:15:44] didn't give you for those that wasn't
[1:15:45] here last night he sent his seeds into
[1:15:48] the Earth
[1:15:50] and though might be thousands of years
[1:15:53] now you have arrived
[1:15:55] now it's your turn
[1:15:57] it's your turn to run
[1:16:00] Paul would be given the responsibility
[1:16:03] to in Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:16:06] to just catch it a name
[1:16:09] to catch a name that had significant
[1:16:14] Eternal purpose
[1:16:16] in the mind of God
[1:16:18] and in their space of time they took the
[1:16:20] Earth
[1:16:22] I can't imagine what the responsibility
[1:16:24] would be like
[1:16:27] in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 32 I just
[1:16:30] read your portion here he said what
[1:16:32] shall we then shall we say hi more for
[1:16:35] the time would fail me to tell you of
[1:16:37] Gideon and Barack and of Samson of Jeff
[1:16:40] and I of David and of Samuel and of the
[1:16:44] prophets that's a mouthful
[1:16:48] you're talking about a dream team from
[1:16:51] heaven
[1:16:53] all in the same sentence
[1:16:57] who through faith submute kingdoms
[1:17:01] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[1:17:05] strap the mouths of the Lions quench the
[1:17:08] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[1:17:10] sword out of weaknesses were made strong
[1:17:13] what's grounded in Fight to turn the
[1:17:15] flight to the armies of the aliens women
[1:17:18] received their dead raised to life again
[1:17:20] others were tortured not accepting
[1:17:23] Deliverance
[1:17:25] that they might obtain a better
[1:17:27] resurrection and others had a trial of
[1:17:30] cruel mockings and scourgeons moreover
[1:17:33] bonds and imprisonment
[1:17:35] listen you could take just a portion of
[1:17:37] a sentence and preach for months
[1:17:44] they were stoned
[1:17:48] they were song asunder
[1:17:51] were tempted
[1:17:53] were slain with a sword
[1:17:56] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[1:17:58] goat skins been destitute and afflicted
[1:18:02] when I read that about being strong
[1:18:04] everybody knows the name John Wesley
[1:18:07] he was five foot one and redheaded
[1:18:12] I like it
[1:18:17] he would put me put out of a lot of
[1:18:19] churches today because he was so
[1:18:20] emotional
[1:18:24] and he preached
[1:18:26] and then his inspiration of preaching
[1:18:29] one time he was in a field because the
[1:18:31] church a churches wouldn't hold his
[1:18:33] crowd and a hailstorm came
[1:18:36] and they just stood there ten thousand
[1:18:38] people stood there while he preached
[1:18:41] one day he was preaching
[1:18:43] and the whole crowd got slain in the
[1:18:46] spirit and he thought what he said was
[1:18:48] so important he went out and tried to
[1:18:50] set him up and said listen
[1:18:54] but they were so drunk in the spirit
[1:18:57] these men were powerful men
[1:19:01] these men were men that God slowly seed
[1:19:05] into the Earth
[1:19:07] God knew that he was sending them into
[1:19:10] the Earth and he was anointing them with
[1:19:12] purpose
[1:19:16] but it wasn't an easy Road
[1:19:18] they hated him so much till they stoned
[1:19:20] him over and over again
[1:19:23] stalled him I just read about in the Old
[1:19:26] Testament how they stoned him and here
[1:19:27] we've got a church age messenger
[1:19:31] right right right they're stoning
[1:19:33] brother Branham now
[1:19:35] they'll pay for that
[1:19:37] every Rock they throw they'll pay for
[1:19:39] that
[1:19:40] but let me just say this to you as they
[1:19:43] stoned John Wesley he didn't quit
[1:19:49] I read his diary over and over again he
[1:19:52] would it was very it was a very
[1:19:54] intellectual man
[1:19:57] and being his extreme intellect
[1:20:01] he would write so dry in his literature
[1:20:05] he said today I was stoned
[1:20:09] and I waited till the last one left
[1:20:13] and it climbed out from under the stack
[1:20:15] of stones
[1:20:18] and guy went home preparing to preach
[1:20:21] tomorrow
[1:20:27] how many times did it happen five times
[1:20:30] I found it
[1:20:32] five times you'd mostly quit Church
[1:20:40] I hoped you wouldn't
[1:20:44] these were men with passion
[1:20:47] he had a message to preach
[1:20:51] and he preaching his message it cost him
[1:20:53] a lot
[1:20:56] no church welcomed it
[1:21:01] nobody welcomed him
[1:21:03] he would build churches later and it
[1:21:06] would become the Methodist movement
[1:21:08] it was a new method of preaching
[1:21:12] not a Pulpit
[1:21:14] but he would stand in the in the streets
[1:21:16] on a basket
[1:21:18] and preach because nobody wanted him
[1:21:22] but that didn't stop the message
[1:21:29] no Paul would say it like this of whom
[1:21:32] the world was not worthy
[1:21:34] they wandered in deserts and in
[1:21:37] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:21:39] earth and these all haven't obtained a
[1:21:41] good report through faith received not
[1:21:44] the promise
[1:21:46] God having provided a better thing
[1:21:50] for us
[1:21:51] that they with us
[1:21:55] should not be made perfect
[1:21:58] there is a people in another Realm
[1:22:02] counting on you
[1:22:06] how many brother random calls you the
[1:22:08] final voice to the final age it goes all
[1:22:10] the way back
[1:22:12] in the mind of God in the last book in
[1:22:16] Revelations chapter 5 we were standing
[1:22:19] there screaming Hallelujah and
[1:22:22] worshiping Our Redeemer
[1:22:24] we're all at them to fight with him
[1:22:30] and then he would begin to write
[1:22:33] wherefore seeing we're also
[1:22:35] compassionate about with all of this
[1:22:37] group
[1:22:38] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1:22:42] aside every weight
[1:22:44] and the sin was just so easily beside us
[1:22:51] and let it run with patience the race
[1:22:54] that is set before us
[1:22:56] looking unto Jesus the author the
[1:23:00] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:23:03] and be sat before him and doing the
[1:23:06] cross despising the shame and it sat
[1:23:08] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:23:10] God
[1:23:12] what a statement
[1:23:18] brother Branham was standing
[1:23:21] and God would use a man to
[1:23:24] to speak in tongues
[1:23:27] and then speak
[1:23:29] God was speaking to him
[1:23:32] and God spoke to him these words
[1:23:37] because thou has chosen
[1:23:40] The Narrow Path
[1:23:43] the harder way
[1:23:45] that thou has walked in your truth your
[1:23:48] own choosing
[1:23:50] thou has picked
[1:23:52] the correct and precise decision and it
[1:23:56] is my way
[1:23:58] because of this momentous decision a
[1:24:02] huge portion of Heaven will await them
[1:24:06] what a glorious decision that thou has
[1:24:09] made
[1:24:10] this in itself is that which will give
[1:24:13] and make to come to pass that tremendous
[1:24:17] victory in the left divine
[1:24:21] I would like to say this is more than
[1:24:23] just a wig in Branham
[1:24:28] this is for every one of you
[1:24:31] you had to make a choice
[1:24:34] and at many times it was a difficult
[1:24:36] choice
[1:24:38] it was a narrow path
[1:24:42] but what a reward
[1:24:46] what a phenomenal reward that we have
[1:24:54] brother Graham says the devil is always
[1:24:56] trying to point you to somebody's
[1:24:58] failure
[1:25:00] but he tries to keep you away from the
[1:25:02] real testimony that is genuine
[1:25:07] I'm real careful who I point my children
[1:25:10] to Heroes
[1:25:13] Hollywood and all of these stars are not
[1:25:15] Heroes
[1:25:18] politics and all their Stars they're not
[1:25:20] Heroes
[1:25:22] this Sports World in all of their scars
[1:25:25] it's not Heroes look around the building
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:29] these are real people that are heroes
[1:25:38] and he gives it a theme a devil is
[1:25:41] almost harmless
[1:25:44] unless he can have something to work in
[1:25:48] you remember those Devils that were cast
[1:25:50] out of a legion that they had he said
[1:25:53] they wanted to do more mischievousness
[1:25:56] they wanted to go into the halts so
[1:26:00] Devils must have something to work with
[1:26:05] and I said it that realm and the
[1:26:07] negative realm if the devil wants
[1:26:10] somebody to work with how much God needs
[1:26:14] you
[1:26:17] I want to remind you for with God not
[1:26:20] this is possible
[1:26:22] so regardless of how many blockades that
[1:26:25] you have to go through and walls that
[1:26:27] seem so tall to climb God is great at
[1:26:32] impossibilities
[1:26:41] ye are of God we quoted it last night I
[1:26:44] came from God and I'm going back to God
[1:26:47] that was our origin we're here and we're
[1:26:50] going back to him
[1:26:52] year of God little children and have
[1:26:54] overcame them because greater is he that
[1:26:57] is in you
[1:27:01] than he that is in the world
[1:27:05] you know there's certain names
[1:27:07] sometimes God sees has a name
[1:27:10] and it becomes your name and you realize
[1:27:13] that you came from God and you're going
[1:27:15] to go back
[1:27:17] do you realize that your name actually
[1:27:19] shakes hell
[1:27:24] you may be nobody here but in hell
[1:27:29] you have become extra Tormentor
[1:27:37] hell is always wanting a News Bulletin
[1:27:40] on what you're up to today
[1:27:43] and what you don't realize is you as
[1:27:45] your prayer life you are praying for an
[1:27:49] atmosphere around your home
[1:27:51] you don't need a hundred people standing
[1:27:54] guard
[1:27:55] in another dimension there are angels
[1:27:57] that's watching over your house
[1:27:59] Psalms 91 has been dispatched to take
[1:28:03] care of you
[1:28:05] angels are in charge to take care of you
[1:28:07] to watch your children going to school
[1:28:13] if you're going to look back God has
[1:28:15] prepared you oh my brother Ron God save
[1:28:17] me from this what you don't understand
[1:28:19] that's only half the story what God has
[1:28:22] kept you from
[1:28:28] if you could have only seen the enemy
[1:28:30] trying to destroy your life a spirit
[1:28:33] trying to creep into your home an
[1:28:35] attitude trying to change you and God
[1:28:37] rich in Mercy by the gift of the Holy
[1:28:40] Ghost wash that thing out like an
[1:28:43] Artesian well he just washed that thing
[1:28:46] out
[1:28:47] that's why the need of the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:50] more important today than ever before
[1:28:51] because Satan is on the attack he's
[1:28:54] trying to get in your mind and so God
[1:28:57] rich in Mercy fills you with the Holy
[1:29:00] Ghost and every time a little trash goes
[1:29:03] in watch Holy Ghost water pushes it
[1:29:05] right back up
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:16] God has a law of reproduction
[1:29:19] in his seat they have all the potentials
[1:29:21] of God
[1:29:22] not just a portion God poured all of
[1:29:25] himself inside of you
[1:29:28] you're an amateur God on the earth
[1:29:30] you've heard these things
[1:29:33] but the devil would whisper in your ear
[1:29:35] trying to get you to believe another
[1:29:36] report but whose report will We Believe
[1:29:45] you're God's masterpiece
[1:29:48] the scripture says in these signs shall
[1:29:51] follow them that believe
[1:29:54] in my name
[1:29:56] he has given you a checkbook
[1:29:59] with authority to sign the check
[1:30:06] my wife that's here
[1:30:08] our bank would not recognize my name
[1:30:14] if I would sign a check they would go
[1:30:16] there's some forgery going on here
[1:30:20] because since we've been married she
[1:30:22] signed my checks
[1:30:24] foreign
[1:30:29] I don't have a clue this might be
[1:30:32] foreign to a lot of people I don't have
[1:30:34] a clue
[1:30:36] to how much money is in my own bank
[1:30:40] I'm not worried
[1:30:44] and that right Connie
[1:30:47] once in a while I'll just look at her
[1:30:49] and say we okay
[1:30:55] because when I said I do
[1:31:00] everything that I own is hers
[1:31:03] and everything she owns is hers
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:23] but we have an identification to another
[1:31:25] kingdom
[1:31:27] amen and so we as his wife
[1:31:31] sang the church
[1:31:38] sometimes we back God for things when we
[1:31:40] have the authority to just write a check
[1:31:48] you know Connie when she goes to the
[1:31:50] store she don't call me said is it okay
[1:31:54] I hope I don't hurt nobody's feelings
[1:31:56] here
[1:31:59] on is it okay is it okay is it okay
[1:32:06] it's okay
[1:32:09] I'm busy here you just do what you got
[1:32:11] to do
[1:32:14] sometimes Brother Ray we just delegate
[1:32:21] my cancer doctors told me said you
[1:32:23] learned to delegate
[1:32:26] you don't have to shake 300 people's
[1:32:28] hands get the deacons to do that
[1:32:35] they do a great job
[1:32:36] I just tell everybody I love them
[1:32:39] I haven't changed my mind
[1:32:42] there are days
[1:32:52] but you're the wife of God
[1:32:55] I don't know how many quotes you've got
[1:32:57] to hear
[1:32:58] but you're God's wife
[1:33:03] I hope you get it you're his wife
[1:33:07] you're his you are the
[1:33:10] Christ Living in bright form on the
[1:33:13] Earth
[1:33:16] why shouldn't we overcome
[1:33:20] you have all of his potentials you don't
[1:33:22] have to beg you're not a slave no more
[1:33:25] it's live Just Breathe
[1:33:30] quit beating yourself just breathe
[1:33:33] here we go
[1:33:39] there was a time you had to remind
[1:33:40] yourself you were married I'm married
[1:33:42] I'm married I'm married I'm married I'm
[1:33:44] married
[1:33:46] but after it becomes a reality you don't
[1:33:48] have to worry about that no more you're
[1:33:51] married
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:53] and sometimes when you came to church
[1:33:55] you were I married to him I'm married to
[1:33:57] him I'm married to him but one day it
[1:33:59] wakes up inside of you
[1:34:02] that means why
[1:34:05] I'm him in bright form I have all of his
[1:34:09] potentials he put it in me
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:23] I was a group of men
[1:34:25] that signed the Magna Carta
[1:34:29] for our independence as America
[1:34:36] and their names they were powerful
[1:34:38] people
[1:34:39] some of them will have his hat on the
[1:34:42] great plantations
[1:34:46] they were some of them rich
[1:34:49] some of them were just common workers
[1:34:52] Liars
[1:34:55] but we declared that we were independent
[1:35:00] from foreign rules we forgot it
[1:35:08] but
[1:35:09] these people signed that Magna Carta the
[1:35:13] Declaration of Independence
[1:35:16] and they signed it
[1:35:19] they sealed their life with their
[1:35:22] signature
[1:35:24] we're free we're not going to live as
[1:35:26] slaves no more
[1:35:29] what you don't realize that once they
[1:35:32] signed it and became a part of it
[1:35:35] now every enemy turned on them their
[1:35:39] plantations was destroyed most of their
[1:35:42] families was destroyed
[1:35:44] mom as a matter of fact one man the
[1:35:48] enemy had infotril infiltrated his
[1:35:50] family and his home
[1:35:53] and he told George Washington if the
[1:35:56] enemy's going to live in my home blow it
[1:35:59] up
[1:36:03] blow it up
[1:36:05] I say this we have signed our life to

[1:36:49] the spirit of Christ lives inside of you
[1:36:51] you'll do the works of Jesus Christ
[1:36:58] it was a man

[1:37:03] and he signed it larger than anybody
[1:37:05] else
[1:37:07] his name is called John Hancock
[1:37:12] later they would ask him why did you
[1:37:14] sign your name so large
[1:37:16] he said when the king reads it
[1:37:20] I want him to see my name without his
[1:37:22] glasses

[1:38:06] charging like never before
[1:38:11] [Applause]
[1:38:23] huh
[1:38:26] the scripture says that Jesus said unto
[1:38:29] them
[1:38:30] no man having put his hand to the plow
[1:38:33] and looking back is fit
[1:38:37] for the kingdom of heaven
[1:38:40] I want to say this to you and you've
[1:38:42] heard me say it before never
[1:38:45] give up
[1:38:51] young people all across this building I
[1:38:53] want you to say it with me never
[1:38:58] never
[1:39:00] give up
[1:39:07] whatever the reason is
[1:39:10] too much pressure
[1:39:13] exhausted
[1:39:15] frustrated
[1:39:17] lack of commitment
[1:39:20] the spirit to flee
[1:39:23] run from responsibility
[1:39:29] refusing to train
[1:39:34] the thoughts of escaping it all
[1:39:38] let me just tell you something about
[1:39:39] escaping it all we live in a world that
[1:39:41] you want to go to the back side of the
[1:39:42] mountains and then when you get there 52
[1:39:46] 000 other people are there
[1:39:54] and all the things all of a sudden you
[1:39:56] find yourself
[1:39:57] in that
[1:40:00] isolation with 52 people in front of you
[1:40:03] at Starbucks
[1:40:07] and what you was escaping you have just
[1:40:09] found again
[1:40:11] but this world it's not our home
[1:40:16] this world is no place to relax
[1:40:22] brother Ron I'm wiped out
[1:40:24] good
[1:40:26] because that means if you're fighting
[1:40:29] Satan's trying to get you
[1:40:34] right brother on the things that I've
[1:40:35] been through
[1:40:36] I could write a book
[1:40:39] about
[1:40:41] my horrors of life
[1:40:45] well that's just stuff
[1:40:48] come on
[1:40:57] I got on a plane after a meeting
[1:41:01] about 20 years ago
[1:41:04] I got about halfway
[1:41:07] and I was called to the next
[1:41:10] layover and they told me we have
[1:41:14] we've canceled your flight
[1:41:17] and I said I I really want to go home
[1:41:24] I looked across at the younger lady at
[1:41:26] the counter and I said I really I'm wore
[1:41:29] out I preached a meeting
[1:41:30] and I really I really need to go home
[1:41:37] and then I blame my wife
[1:41:39] I said my wife needs me
[1:41:48] they put me on a complete different
[1:41:50] Airline
[1:41:52] I got I got in that place and put me
[1:41:55] beside of a window
[1:41:58] and a big guy sat down beside him
[1:42:01] he was a rattle boss
[1:42:06] and he told me about how important he
[1:42:08] was and what his job he had and talked
[1:42:10] about his boss that sit behind beside
[1:42:12] him all the time he talked about how
[1:42:14] great he was and you know he just kept
[1:42:16] going and kept going and we were about
[1:42:18] to land and he finally said what do you
[1:42:20] do
[1:42:27] I didn't have a lot of time to just
[1:42:29] waste with him and I said well I'm a
[1:42:32] preacher
[1:42:33] and I preached the message of William
[1:42:34] Mary and Brenner and the guy that had
[1:42:37] been silent was sitting at the aisle
[1:42:40] all of a sudden he perks up
[1:42:43] he said I grew up in the message and he
[1:42:45] started talking about the Miracles that
[1:42:47] he knew
[1:42:52] and as we land he's telling me I grew up
[1:42:54] and he said I got away in my my my
[1:42:56] family is demolished and my life is
[1:42:58] demolished and I I own an insurance
[1:43:00] company and I I have all of this but I
[1:43:03] don't have God
[1:43:07] I told that story for about 20 years
[1:43:11] looking for that man in the meetings
[1:43:16] families moved from North Carolina to
[1:43:19] our church
[1:43:21] and a brother comes
[1:43:24] and he comes to the church and he's
[1:43:26] there a couple of times and
[1:43:28] and uh
[1:43:30] we're going to have a little pizza get
[1:43:32] together and so uh I don't I don't know
[1:43:35] him he don't know me and we're just
[1:43:37] talking as we're going into the into the
[1:43:40] fellowship hall and
[1:43:43] and he would sit down beside of me and
[1:43:45] he began to talk and others would begin
[1:43:46] to talk I think we had about 12 at the
[1:43:48] table at that time and the Lord Whispers
[1:43:51] in my ear the man that was on the plane
[1:43:54] is setting beside him
[1:44:03] and in the other ear
[1:44:06] what if you're wrong
[1:44:11] and I looked at him and I I just kind of
[1:44:13] set back
[1:44:14] 20 years I've been looking for him
[1:44:19] 20 years of Devastation in his life
[1:44:23] 20 years of a lot of turmoil
[1:44:26] and God hasn't forgot him
[1:44:30] he'd write books about his turmoil of
[1:44:33] his life
[1:44:34] actually write books
[1:44:36] about his turmoil in his life
[1:44:42] and I said we've met before he said no
[1:44:45] we've never met before I said yeah yeah
[1:44:48] we've met before
[1:44:52] he said how you know that
[1:44:53] I said a little voice just spoke in my
[1:44:55] ear that I met you on an airplane
[1:44:58] and I've been looking for you for 20
[1:45:01] years
[1:45:03] and so I told him the story that I just
[1:45:05] told you and he put his hands over his
[1:45:07] face and he said my God
[1:45:11] God never gave up on me
[1:45:26] let me just say this to you and your
[1:45:28] children
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:30] that seems so impossible God does not
[1:45:34] give up on his kids
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:38] he made a promise I'll not lose one of
[1:45:42] them
[1:45:44] not one of them
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:48] for him insane like this you may be
[1:45:50] going through hell
[1:45:52] but God will watch over you his grace
[1:45:57] and his love he's rich in Mercy his
[1:46:01] Redemption is as strong today as it's
[1:46:03] ever been
[1:46:05] his power to forgive
[1:46:10] when he forgives the most wretched
[1:46:12] sinner in the world it doesn't diminish
[1:46:15] his power whatsoever
[1:46:17] because that which he deposited is him
[1:46:21] himself
[1:46:24] and you may be in a pawn shop and feel
[1:46:27] like nobody will ever look at you but
[1:46:30] God's headed your way
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:45] thank you Lord
[1:47:01] when I called you out last night as a
[1:47:03] doctor
[1:47:04] don't you never let nobody make fun of
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:11] amen God called you to be where you're
[1:47:13] at
[1:47:18] and don't you be intimidated by people's
[1:47:20] spirits

[1:47:24] you didn't put yourself there God
[1:47:26] blessed you there
[1:47:37] thank you Lord
[1:47:55] is that all right for me to go on
[1:48:00] foreign
[1:48:07] God sends his seeds into the Earth
[1:48:11] he sends them on a mission
[1:48:14] your mission was to be more than a
[1:48:16] mailman
[1:48:20] people didn't know that God had an angel
[1:48:22] stepping on their soul
[1:48:25] and your prayers in the morning
[1:48:27] protected their homes as you visited
[1:48:31] you being in a certain School you may be
[1:48:33] the only believer but God blesses that
[1:48:36] school because you're there you working
[1:48:39] on a certain job God blesses that job
[1:48:41] because you're there
[1:48:44] you walk into an empty restaurant and
[1:48:47] all of a sudden it begins to fill up
[1:48:49] because you're there
[1:48:54] it's blessings that's been commanded
[1:48:56] over top of your life
[1:48:58] there's blessings have been commanded

[1:49:30] given to you
[1:49:32] this isn't what I promised you this is
[1:49:35] what God said I'll bless you with
[1:49:46] amen
[1:49:48] thank you Lord you walked up brother
[1:49:51] Aegis
[1:49:54] your life was devastated I don't know
[1:49:57] the whole story
[1:49:59] but it was in prayer
[1:50:02] you had a back condition
[1:50:04] and while we prayed I've never ever did
[1:50:07] it since
[1:50:09] while we pray God spoke in my ear and
[1:50:12] said ask him what his hobby is
[1:50:20] we stopped he was a guy he looked kind
[1:50:22] of shocked when I stopped and asked him
[1:50:26] Greenhouse
[1:50:28] well let's pray that God blesses the
[1:50:30] greenhouse
[1:50:38] what about you
[1:50:40] don't get jealous of what God did
[1:50:45] don't get jealous of brother Wayne
[1:50:48] don't get jealous of these boys oh
[1:50:50] they're just preachers because they're
[1:50:52] Granddad they ran from that
[1:50:55] these guys didn't want to do the job
[1:50:57] because they saw the turmoil that he had
[1:50:59] to go through
[1:51:00] the fights but now it's their turn
[1:51:05] long live the king
[1:51:07] so you can enjoy the labors as these
[1:51:10] guys work
[1:51:13] it's enjoying this
[1:51:28] Sister Mary
[1:51:30] brother Darren
[1:51:32] I know you've got a wonderful family
[1:51:42] I know you got
[1:51:43] but you didn't put that gift in that boy
[1:51:48] he was probably a stinker growing up
[1:51:53] most preachers are stinkers growing up
[1:51:56] but God rich in Mercy
[1:52:01] I think about the the things that God
[1:52:04] has did
[1:52:05] allowed me to be a part of his life
[1:52:08] his wife's life
[1:52:10] when Satan tried it I don't I can't find
[1:52:13] her but when Satan tried to destroy her
[1:52:15] and take her life
[1:52:17] yeah
[1:52:18] yeah
[1:52:21] come on is it okay for me to do a little
[1:52:23] talk here
[1:52:29] by the way and you brought her to my
[1:52:31] house you told her you'd take her any
[1:52:33] place in the earth
[1:52:34] anywhere
[1:52:37] she made a choice to come to my house
[1:52:42] you go girl
[1:52:50] when you call me I begin to pray
[1:52:54] this is life or death
[1:52:57] I forget
[1:53:01] we met we talked she wasn't even the
[1:53:04] same person
[1:53:07] Satan made into time
[1:53:11] we went into the house
[1:53:14] we said in what we call a great room
[1:53:16] it's tall
[1:53:18] and we begin to pray
[1:53:20] and a demon spoke out of her he said I'm
[1:53:23] not coming out
[1:53:24] and we rebuke that demon
[1:53:27] spirit of God hit brother Wayne he
[1:53:28] rolled all over the floor he rolled all
[1:53:30] over my office
[1:53:32] spoke in tongues
[1:53:34] you don't believe in that you need a
[1:53:36] birth
[1:53:45] and I I asked her ever after everything
[1:53:47] settled down
[1:53:49] I said would you like to see my puppy
[1:53:54] because I needed her to relax
[1:53:56] Brother Ray I'm sorry if I'm telling
[1:53:58] something that's too too
[1:54:00] I needed her to relax
[1:54:02] to where I could catch her spirit
[1:54:05] of what caused it
[1:54:12] and I had a dog
[1:54:14] it was an Australian Shepherd
[1:54:16] his granddaddy won the New York State
[1:54:18] show
[1:54:20] she was beautiful
[1:54:22] cancer took a life
[1:54:26] what a devil
[1:54:28] picked on my dog
[1:54:31] cancer took her life
[1:54:34] her name was Belle we called her Bell
[1:54:37] after Beauty and the Beast
[1:54:42] I don't like Disney brother Ron
[1:54:45] shame on you
[1:54:59] and Belle came out and jumped up in her
[1:55:02] lap
[1:55:03] and he she just loved her
[1:55:06] she started rubbing all over bail and
[1:55:08] bail could make you feel like you were
[1:55:10] the most important person in the world
[1:55:15] brother Wayne was on the golf cart
[1:55:16] sitting behind she was sitting beside of
[1:55:19] me
[1:55:19] we hadn't went a hundred yards
[1:55:22] and the Lord told her exactly what was
[1:55:24] going on
[1:55:26] her daddy didn't even know
[1:55:29] God cared amen
[1:55:33] because you were going to be a
[1:55:35] preacher's wife
[1:55:37] had you been born a male you would have
[1:55:40] preached sermons
[1:55:42] but we don't believe in transgender
[1:55:47] so you get to sing songs
[1:55:51] and songs in your songs you create an
[1:55:54] atmosphere to where Devil's run
[1:55:58] God allowed you to go through that trial
[1:56:01] that while you could sing songs even in
[1:56:04] the depth of that Psalm you could reach
[1:56:07] down where nobody else can reach
[1:56:10] because the seed that got deposited on
[1:56:14] the inside of you is not for 10 or 20
[1:56:16] years it's for eternity
[1:56:21] he sent that seed into the Earth
[1:56:23] [Applause]
[1:56:31] and you needed a wife
[1:56:34] that had been through all of that
[1:56:38] because she would know how to pray for
[1:56:40] your ministry
[1:56:43] when you feel so intimidated
[1:56:47] I'm just a young guy
[1:56:48] I'm Just a Nobody
[1:56:51] I I don't even hardly know what to say
[1:56:53] and then you stand to your feet and
[1:56:56] preach a masterpiece
[1:56:59] because of the sea
[1:57:05] he sent his seed into the Earth
[1:57:13] buddy Robinson
[1:57:15] he sent his seed into the Earth
[1:57:18] and he would trap millions of miles
[1:57:22] Charles City
[1:57:24] would stand
[1:57:26] intimidated
[1:57:33] but he would preach
[1:57:35] and he would preach convictions so
[1:57:37] strong until the entire police
[1:57:40] department didn't have nothing to do
[1:57:43] and they became the original barbershop
[1:57:45] quartet
[1:57:48] oh because
[1:57:49] God sent his seed
[1:57:55] child spiritual shook London and Europe
[1:58:00] and he would write our president of the
[1:58:02] United States a letter
[1:58:05] declare slavery free
[1:58:09] and our president Tom with a beard
[1:58:14] went to Gettysburg
[1:58:17] and a man spoke in front of him two
[1:58:19] hours nobody remembers what he spoke
[1:58:23] hardly anybody knows his name but a man
[1:58:26] named Abraham Lincoln
[1:58:28] because God sent his sin
[1:58:32] he knew we were coming
[1:58:35] God was going to have a messenger born
[1:58:39] in this land
[1:58:41] in the same state as that president was
[1:58:47] glory and he needed him to be free to
[1:58:50] preach this message
[1:58:53] he needed to be so so bound to the word
[1:58:57] and so entrusted he would only say God's
[1:59:01] word
[1:59:06] and on his way he writes his speech
[1:59:09] the Gettysburg Address
[1:59:12] how did the history
[1:59:14] but there was a preacher behind him
[1:59:17] in London
[1:59:25] named Charles Spurgeon
[1:59:39] my body says I need to quit
[1:59:42] my spirit says I got to finish this
[1:59:47] you can help me
[1:59:56] brother Brennan was under a tree
[2:00:00] he was a bootleggers child
[2:00:04] he's carrying water water
[2:00:11] to make
[2:00:12] moonshine
[2:00:16] they were running from the law
[2:00:18] most Moonshiners didn't drink their own
[2:00:20] whiskey because it meant money
[2:00:23] how do you know that
[2:00:26] I came from Moonshiner families
[2:00:30] her grandfather was a Moonshiner
[2:00:32] my great-grandfather was a Moonshiner
[2:00:36] it was money
[2:00:37] now they put up making beer all over the
[2:00:40] world nobody says nothing it's
[2:00:41] glorifying
[2:00:46] but in that day it was against the law
[2:00:50] and brother Brandon was currying water
[2:00:52] God didn't care where he was carrying
[2:00:54] water to
[2:00:56] me all but brother Ron I've been through
[2:00:58] such stuff
[2:01:00] really
[2:01:02] God's not ashamed of where you had to
[2:01:04] come from
[2:01:08] he's not so ashamed brother Ronald
[2:01:10] probably never fit it in church don't
[2:01:12] you worry
[2:01:14] we're not concerned with your past
[2:01:16] we're concerned with your future
[2:01:21] that's what we're concerned about now
[2:01:22] don't don't beat yourself in purgatory
[2:01:24] all the time that's already been taken
[2:01:27] care of
[2:01:28] it's a done deal you can't do anything
[2:01:30] about yesterday but your future is what
[2:01:33] God's got on his mind
[2:01:39] you would have never even Satan would
[2:01:42] have never been able
[2:01:44] to see the potential
[2:01:47] and this man that would never weigh over
[2:01:49] 150 pounds in his in his bodily flesh
[2:01:53] starts out as a boxer never defeated
[2:01:58] going west
[2:02:00] and he's laying on a saddle
[2:02:03] and a fella starts playing through his
[2:02:05] comb and the spirit of God drops
[2:02:09] don't worry no matter how far you go God
[2:02:12] will find you
[2:02:15] that guy's family's been murdered and
[2:02:18] tormented and had a wretch
[2:02:21] but God know what he laid inside of your
[2:02:24] seed
[2:02:29] it's not your flesh that is so important
[2:02:32] it's the seed that has been deposited
[2:02:37] [Applause]
[2:02:45] amen
[2:02:47] thank you Lord the messages that you
[2:02:50] hear
[2:02:51] are more than the mind of a man
[2:02:54] but God choreographed every sermon
[2:03:00] and you hear it brother Branham say well
[2:03:02] I was I just come down I wanted to
[2:03:04] worship with you I came into town and I
[2:03:06] wanted to worship with you really don't
[2:03:09] have any notes but brother Neville said
[2:03:11] You Preach
[2:03:14] and he gets up and preaches and knoweth
[2:03:16] it not
[2:03:18] one of the most powerful sermons he ever
[2:03:20] preach or door in a door and he gets up
[2:03:22] and he just starts talking
[2:03:25] because it wasn't him
[2:03:34] patience standing in front of him
[2:03:37] he said you've been nervous
[2:03:39] nervous since a child
[2:03:43] about 40 years
[2:03:45] I see you get off a bus and the dog
[2:03:48] chases you down the road I've been
[2:03:51] nervous since that time
[2:03:57] and you begin to realize that
[2:04:00] that man don't know you
[2:04:02] but that that presence that's between
[2:04:05] you he knows you
[2:04:14] now you're the you're the granddaughter
[2:04:16] of a great preacher
[2:04:18] isn't that right
[2:04:20] yeah
[2:04:21] his name Charlie
[2:04:23] I've known him for many years
[2:04:26] now what he preached all those years now
[2:04:28] lives inside of you thank you Lord
[2:04:33] am I right
[2:04:35] thank you Lord and there's a special
[2:04:37] blessing because you're his Granddaddy
[2:04:40] and God will pay his even his
[2:04:42] grandchildren yeah a special blessing
[2:04:47] because of his work
[2:04:51] but there's an enemy would try to deter
[2:04:53] you and take you in different directions
[2:04:56] but if you can just remember your origin
[2:05:00] preaching to More Than Just That Girl
[2:05:07] don't you never be ashamed to work God
[2:05:09] has brought you from
[2:05:13] amen because where God brought you from
[2:05:15] he's taken you back
[2:05:18] it's more than just a salmon story
[2:05:22] it's just more than a migration of birds
[2:05:27] God brought you from heaven and out of
[2:05:29] the Lamb's Book and he's going to break
[2:05:32] you back
[2:05:36] Russia screaming she wants to drop a
[2:05:38] bomb on American end at all but there's
[2:05:40] Angels standing there
[2:05:44] I'm finishing now but there's Angels
[2:05:46] standing there
[2:05:48] those men are ordained to fulfill what
[2:05:51] God Said was going to happen
[2:05:54] just like you're ordained to fulfill
[2:05:56] what gods have in the Bride of Jesus
[2:05:59] Christ
[2:06:06] China's screaming North Korea screaming
[2:06:09] I ran screaming
[2:06:14] and we appear as the weakest that we've
[2:06:16] ever been
[2:06:19] God ordained that too
[2:06:23] but nothing can happen
[2:06:26] not one bomb can drop
[2:06:29] until God's got a covenant with the
[2:06:31] families of the Earth
[2:06:35] that can have the most powerful weapons
[2:06:37] even beyond their mind's life it doesn't
[2:06:40] matter they can't do anything until that
[2:06:45] last seed comes in
[2:06:50] he knows where they're at
[2:07:00] because he was sitting on a boat
[2:07:07] hair down on his shoulders
[2:07:11] his robe was a little dirty
[2:07:19] and he just simply said
[2:07:21] A sower
[2:07:23] went forth to sew
[2:07:29] because he
[2:07:31] was the great sword
[2:07:45] and only hours he'd go to a graveyard
[2:07:49] for what
[2:07:56] you're the most important thing on God's
[2:07:58] mind
[2:08:03] the stars are hanging in orbit
[2:08:06] and yet in all of God's Great vastness
[2:08:10] you
[2:08:12] are the most important thing
[2:08:14] on God's mind
[2:08:21] why do you talk to them in parables
[2:08:27] blessed are your eyes
[2:08:31] are you see
[2:08:35] blessed are your ears
[2:08:38] for you here

[2:09:02] the Earth
[2:09:04] but God gave you the highest job he
[2:09:06] could give you
[2:09:08] the preach this word
