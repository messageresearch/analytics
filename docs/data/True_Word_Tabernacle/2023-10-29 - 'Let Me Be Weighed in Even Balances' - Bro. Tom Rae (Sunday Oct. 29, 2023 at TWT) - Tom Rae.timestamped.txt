[1:05:26] 11
[1:05:28] Proverbs
[1:05:36] 11 and we will be reading at verse
[1:05:43] one Proverbs 11 verse
[1:05:48] 1 a false
[1:05:50] balance is an Abomination to the Lord
[1:05:54] but a just weight is his
[1:06:00] Delight when Pride cometh then cometh
[1:06:04] shame of with lowly is
[1:06:07] wisdom the Integrity of the upright
[1:06:10] shall guide them but the perverseness of
[1:06:13] transgressors shall destroy
[1:06:15] them riches profit not in the day of
[1:06:19] Wrath but righteousness deliver from
[1:06:23] death
[1:06:24] the righteousness of the perfect shall
[1:06:27] direct his way but the wicked shall fall
[1:06:31] by his own
[1:06:32] wickedness the righteousness of the
[1:06:35] upright shall deliver them transgressors
[1:06:39] shall be taken in their
[1:06:41] own
[1:06:43] naughtiness like to read verse one one
[1:06:46] more time
[1:06:47] please a false balance is an Abomination
[1:06:52] to the Lord but a just weight is his
[1:06:56] Delight let's pray one more
[1:06:59] time heavenly father as we look around
[1:07:02] the room and see the redeemed of God it
[1:07:05] moves our hearts Lord these precious
[1:07:08] brothers that work in the back lord in
[1:07:10] the
[1:07:11] sound I just pray Lord that you will
[1:07:13] bless those that labor for the kingdom
[1:07:17] in what area whatever area you have them
[1:07:22] as the pastor was saying this morning
[1:07:24] great gifts are in the body Lord those
[1:07:27] gifts are not for themselves but the
[1:07:30] gifts are for the body so I pray that
[1:07:33] your blessing be upon the church and
[1:07:35] upon the word as we commit ourselves to
[1:07:38] you now in Jesus name amen amen you may
[1:07:43] have your
[1:07:46] seats now you might this morning have to
[1:07:52] um um
[1:07:55] I will go
[1:07:57] slow and like brother Ron Spencer said
[1:08:00] one time he heard me at home I was
[1:08:02] preaching and he was listening to me and
[1:08:04] he text me after all I he I said I'm
[1:08:08] going to go slow this morning and he
[1:08:11] text me he says well let's see how that
[1:08:15] [Laughter]
[1:08:19] goes so we're all different and that's
[1:08:22] what makes the great B of God
[1:08:25] beautiful every one of you have have are
[1:08:28] something special to the Lord and each
[1:08:30] one has a part to play in the great body
[1:08:32] of Christ and so I I thought well I I
[1:08:37] just came across this the other day and
[1:08:38] I and I and I thought this might might
[1:08:42] help understand word the kind of day
[1:08:44] we're living
[1:08:46] in it's it's called and the title is
[1:08:50] facts in case you miss them facts in
[1:08:54] case you missed
[1:08:55] them according to
[1:08:58] research our attention span has markedly
[1:09:01] decreased in 15
[1:09:06] years in 2000 it was 12
[1:09:14] seconds 12 seconds you say I know I
[1:09:17] listen to brother uh brother Dwayne I
[1:09:20] know I listen to him real good but after
[1:09:22] 12 seconds
[1:09:27] shopping I'm not saying you do that at
[1:09:29] all not this
[1:09:32] church huh oh I got to fix my car or I
[1:09:36] got it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[1:09:38] but this is fact this is data we're
[1:09:41] we're proving we're going to prove their
[1:09:43] data wrong okay I'm doing this to help
[1:09:46] you help me amen stay
[1:09:51] focused in 2000 it was 12 seconds now 15
[1:09:56] years later it is shrunk to
[1:09:58] 8.25 seconds
[1:10:02] wow so these are this is not you know
[1:10:05] Tom Ray making up some facts this is
[1:10:08] data that they are collecting in fact
[1:10:11] scientists reckoned we now have a
[1:10:14] shorter attention span than
[1:10:22] goldfish
[1:10:24] it's amazing isn't
[1:10:26] it but I'm I'm saying this not to put a
[1:10:31] cloud or anything on us but the message
[1:10:34] came or the word has come to focus
[1:10:38] us so the stats that they give is not us
[1:10:43] am okay because I know when the preacher
[1:10:47] preaches at our church whether it be any
[1:10:50] other brother preaching behind the
[1:10:51] pulpit I know I got a more attention
[1:10:53] spend in 8.25
[1:10:56] seconds I can prove that
[1:10:58] wrong but the way
[1:11:01] Society is moving in their uh how can I
[1:11:05] say in their
[1:11:07] entertainment the way the news flash
[1:11:10] comes it is trying to dictate the minds
[1:11:15] of those that are of Satan's Eden but
[1:11:19] God in his greatness sent you Malachi 4
[1:11:24] to give you the very Mind Of God that
[1:11:28] focuses on thus saith the Lord is
[1:11:32] everybody with me on the same page I
[1:11:35] don't care what science says I'll take
[1:11:37] what the word
[1:11:39] says amen I come to church to meet with
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ I come to hear from his
[1:11:44] word and I do not have the attention
[1:11:47] span of a
[1:11:52] goldfish amen
[1:11:55] it goes
[1:11:57] on this is where marketers have a
[1:12:02] problem I who the the old days I have to
[1:12:04] admit I came out of the world so you
[1:12:07] know um I grew up unfortunately with a
[1:12:11] television but it used to be they put
[1:12:14] the ads on and you could go out make a
[1:12:16] sandwich come back sit down have your
[1:12:18] Coke and now the thing goes on back to
[1:12:20] the football game right that's right
[1:12:23] they can't do that
[1:12:25] anymore it's got to be
[1:12:28] changing it's got to keep their
[1:12:30] attention span right and they said
[1:12:33] what's happening to our
[1:12:34] children is that in in their
[1:12:37] transactions in entertainment they have
[1:12:39] to change a scene up to every five
[1:12:44] seconds and that has become now
[1:12:48] scrambled egg
[1:12:51] mines you say honey listen listen to
[1:12:53] Daddy he
[1:12:56] can't because the programs the way that
[1:12:59] Society is is bringing the
[1:13:03] people is to keep them
[1:13:08] unfocused and it it it it it's a time
[1:13:11] where we need to saturate ourselves in
[1:13:15] the
[1:13:16] word saturate
[1:13:19] ourselves so now who we who we use tapes
[1:13:23] who knows when I say tapes what tapes
[1:13:26] are okay that's pretty good already I
[1:13:29] said tapes the other day at a group of
[1:13:31] people and they looked at me like I was
[1:13:32] from the Dark Ages we don't use tapes
[1:13:36] anymore well well I guess that's a
[1:13:38] vacular now how do what are we supposed
[1:13:41] to say now
[1:13:43] USB no we don't even use USB anymore
[1:13:46] right so I I don't know whatever medium
[1:13:48] you do but we need to saturate ourselves
[1:13:51] with thus sayeth the Lord
[1:13:53] amen we used to we used to have a tape
[1:13:56] and tape used to be 120 right brother
[1:13:58] Ray used to be a one C 120 and sometimes
[1:14:02] extra long tape it' be a c120 with a C60
[1:14:05] that's 180 minutes that's a three-hour
[1:14:07] tape and that and that was normal that
[1:14:10] was normal you sat down and and that's
[1:14:13] what you listened and and you know some
[1:14:16] and I always look at people you know I
[1:14:18] look at you Dory but sometimes I look at
[1:14:21] you and I know you're not looking back
[1:14:23] at me you're looking over my
[1:14:26] head and you're somewhere
[1:14:28] else but it's not that we are to engage
[1:14:33] you or entertain you let's put it that
[1:14:36] way we are here to preach the word of

[1:33:49] kingdoms of Our Lord

[1:33:57] forever and ever do I hear a
[1:34:02] Glory
[1:34:04] Hallelujah what a word what a prophecy
[1:34:07] what a
[1:34:09] reality Amen brother Bram says this in
[1:34:12] three Witnesses he says there over in
[1:34:15] Revelation it said Rejoice ye heavens
[1:34:18] and you holy prophets for the kingdom of
[1:34:21] this world world has become the kingdoms
[1:34:23] of our Lord and of his Christ and as
[1:34:26] long as they are controlled by Satan
[1:34:30] they got the satanic thoughts and Powers
[1:34:35] they'll fight until Jesus comes but
[1:34:39] there will be a
[1:34:40] stone hued out of a
[1:34:43] mountain without hands that'll break
[1:34:47] these
[1:34:49] kingdoms into pieces
[1:34:52] and there'll come a kingdom out of there
[1:34:54] Hallelujah and I'm glad tonight I'm a
[1:34:57] candidate of that
[1:35:00] Kingdom why don't you say this morning
[1:35:03] I'm happy this morning that I am a
[1:35:06] candidate of that Kingdom because
[1:35:09] there's been a rock coming this
[1:35:12] generation strike the image grinds it to
[1:35:17] powder come
[1:35:19] on and we are a part of that new
[1:35:23] kingdom thy kingdom
[1:35:26] come thy will be done in
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:31] earth
[1:35:34] hallelujah hallelujah glory be to Jesus
[1:35:39] let the Hallelujah roll brother Dallas
[1:35:43] we believe it we're a part of it we're
[1:35:46] born into it we were always in
[1:35:50] it
[1:35:58] Hallelujah so I like the title we
[1:36:00] finally get to the
[1:36:02] title been too good to me I told Brother
[1:36:06] Ray last night he said I feel like so
[1:36:08] much at
[1:36:09] home I act like I'm at
[1:36:13] home you're very gracious and thank
[1:36:17] you for making me be
[1:36:20] me
[1:36:23] in the message Oneness he says that you
[1:36:25] would study it
[1:36:27] prayerfully
[1:36:28] carefully weigh it
[1:36:30] out so I'd like to title this my little
[1:36:33] message let me be weighed in even
[1:36:40] balances because an unbalanced scale is
[1:36:43] an
[1:36:45] Abomination so I want to be
[1:36:48] balanced on a balanced scale
[1:36:54] you with me amen so let me be weighed in
[1:36:58] an even
[1:36:59] balance so that I could be weighed not
[1:37:02] on the scales of
[1:37:03] humanity but on the scales of
[1:37:08] God if we wait ourselves on the scales
[1:37:11] of leoda they would they would say
[1:37:14] you're
[1:37:15] crazy but you get weighed on God's
[1:37:18] scales you're going to find out you're C
[1:37:21] worthy
[1:37:23] worthy Worthy is the Lamb and the worthy
[1:37:27] lamb has called you the worthy
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:31] prde I'm so happy my wife didn't get up
[1:37:34] this morning said honey I'm So Unworthy
[1:37:36] to be your your wife oh amen I go honey
[1:37:41] what's
[1:37:46] wrong what's wrong
[1:37:48] here it'd be strange wouldn't it
[1:37:51] huh you brothers that are married your
[1:37:54] wives come up to you and say honey I'm
[1:37:56] So Unworthy how did you choose
[1:37:59] me I mean there were so many other more
[1:38:01] beautiful
[1:38:02] women you're the only one from me you
[1:38:06] stepped out of Eternity into time I
[1:38:09] stepped out of Eternity into time God
[1:38:13] put us
[1:38:14] together and we're going back to
[1:38:16] eternity
[1:38:19] together and so we want to take Satan's
[1:38:24] scales and boot them out the
[1:38:26] door what Satan thinks about you who
[1:38:31] cares what your schoolmates think about
[1:38:33] you who
[1:38:36] cares what your fellow employees say
[1:38:38] about you who
[1:38:42] cares what God thinks of you that's what
[1:38:45] I
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:49] care I get scared scared even when
[1:38:52] people start saying you're a nice
[1:38:57] fell I have to take it from where it
[1:38:59] comes
[1:39:03] from when it's not a Believer I always
[1:39:06] say what do you
[1:39:10] want or what is on your agenda you've
[1:39:12] never called me a nice guy
[1:39:16] before but we should be in the habit of
[1:39:18] calling one
[1:39:20] another
[1:39:25] amen that you should study it
[1:39:27] prayerfully carefully weigh it out in
[1:39:30] the balance of God's word and see
[1:39:31] whether it be of God or not for I
[1:39:33] believe that that's the way we should
[1:39:36] always weigh things with the word but
[1:39:42] that's why we started with now she is
[1:39:45] him right she is revealing the son of
[1:39:50] man so we want to get you on the scales
[1:39:54] real quickly we don't want the devil
[1:39:56] start playing with your mind he's a
[1:40:00] liar and the truth can't be found in him
[1:40:04] so whatever he tells you
[1:40:07] rejoice cuz he's never going to tell you
[1:40:09] the
[1:40:10] truth I know you you'll get that
[1:40:12] tomorrow morning yeah amen the devil
[1:40:15] says Devil's never going to call you a
[1:40:19] believer come on the devil's never going
[1:40:23] to call you a Believer but but he will
[1:40:26] call you an unbeliever so
[1:40:28] Rejoice because he can't tell the truth
[1:40:31] so the truth of the matter is you're a
[1:40:34] Believer
[1:40:36] Hallelujah you see that's reverse
[1:40:37] psychology no it's not it's the
[1:40:40] truth it's just true so just weigh it
[1:40:44] out amen you know when somebody says
[1:40:46] something to you you know like you know
[1:40:48] brother you should buy this truck really
[1:40:51] I wasn't even thinking about
[1:40:53] it but why do you want me to buy your
[1:40:57] truck well he needs money probably and
[1:41:00] he thinks that you have that extra
[1:41:02] dollars to do that so in decision making

[1:41:09] go to school I don't mean you guys I
[1:41:10] sorry you young men go to school right

[1:45:07] your unbalanced
[1:45:09] scale you were born in
[1:45:13] sin shapen in iniquity amen you came
[1:45:18] into the world speaking lies amen but

[1:50:55] table no I said we're enjoying one
[1:50:59] another we're enjoying the presence of
[1:51:02] God what was preached on Sunday what was
[1:51:04] preached last Wednesday what God's doing
[1:51:06] in our lives prise the
[1:51:10] Lord isn't that great that's why we have
[1:51:13] fellowship with one another we have our
[1:51:15] doors open to one another we share with
[1:51:17] one
[1:51:18] another Mak the church
[1:51:22] strong we're not just a place on the
[1:51:26] Pew now I'm getting over
[1:51:31] to
[1:51:33] huh Fellowship
[1:51:35] Divine it's not just the
[1:51:39] church am oh my did you get the Romans
[1:51:42] sir I know you're dying for me to get
[1:51:44] there I got 10 more pages than we're on
[1:51:46] the first half of the first
[1:51:48] page
[1:51:51] Romans 5 and:
[1:51:54] 10 for if when we were
[1:51:59] enemies we were reconciled to God by the
[1:52:02] death of his son really want I want you
[1:52:05] to take a look at that word reconcile
[1:52:08] reconciled means you were imbalanced
[1:52:10] yeah amen but the only thing that could
[1:52:13] balance you was
[1:52:15] blood come
[1:52:17] on blood
[1:52:21] not the blood of 2,000 years
[1:52:24] ago no sir the bleeding word
[1:52:28] today is what's going to balance you and
[1:52:31] I to make make us
[1:52:35] equal
[1:52:37] amen how important is the
[1:52:41] message somebody should shell out very
[1:52:44] important
[1:52:46] extremely
[1:52:48] absolutely when the Prophet says in the
[1:52:50] token message this message is
[1:52:55] Christ that means this message is the
[1:53:00] word hallelujah for then if we were
[1:53:05] enemies well when we were
[1:53:08] enemies the Bible goes on to say we were
[1:53:11] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:53:13] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:53:16] be saved by his life so for when we were
[1:53:19] enemies
[1:53:20] there had to be then something we were
[1:53:23] an enemy so there had to be somebody to
[1:53:26] give us
[1:53:28] peace because if you're enemy you're not
[1:53:30] in
[1:53:33] peace so there had to be
[1:53:36] someone to give you peace again with
[1:53:41] God because you were always Gods yes sir
[1:53:47] you were always in the mind of God
[1:53:50] but through the fall you had to come
[1:53:52] through this
[1:53:54] progression
[1:53:56] right so now something had to happen to
[1:54:00] make you equal or reconcile or on the
[1:54:04] same plane or on the same balance and
[1:54:07] that had to be his
[1:54:11] word his word
[1:54:14] amen so you got to walk in the light as
[1:54:16] he is in the light then the blood of
[1:54:18] Jesus Christ cleanses you from some
[1:54:22] sin oh good I caught you no you
[1:54:26] didn't cuz you're BL Bible Believers
[1:54:29] right yes sir amen so what does the
[1:54:31] blood of Jesus Christ do cleanses you
[1:54:33] from what all s Oh My My My now we want
[1:54:38] to move it from here to here yes sir
[1:54:40] okay let's move it from here to here
[1:54:43] let's speak it from our heart yeah amen
[1:54:45] from all
[1:54:46] what now say a little louder now
[1:54:50] all see if you say it more than once or
[1:54:53] twice it almost become a habit yeah they
[1:54:56] say if you do something for three months
[1:54:59] it becomes a habit let's start your
[1:55:01] habit
[1:55:04] today that was Luther is one of his
[1:55:06] favorite scripture one night he was
[1:55:08] writing out he was translating a Bible
[1:55:11] and uh the Devil comes to him walking in
[1:55:13] his room can you imagine how the devil
[1:55:15] did that walk right in his room and he
[1:55:18] said Luther I got a bunch of things
[1:55:20] against you you did this this week and
[1:55:23] this this this week and this last week
[1:55:25] and this and he read out a
[1:55:27] whole list laundry
[1:55:31] list and then finally Luther said is
[1:55:33] that
[1:55:36] all he says no by the way you did this
[1:55:38] this this and this this this also he
[1:55:40] says is that
[1:55:42] all he says yep that's pretty much it he
[1:55:45] says he threw brother I I a couple
[1:55:48] accounts he threw the Inkwell at him and
[1:55:51] say get out of here devil because the
[1:55:53] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:55:58] me from
[1:56:00] all all your accusations
[1:56:03] hallelujah thank you Lord if we could
[1:56:06] catch that one scripture You' be the
[1:56:07] most liberated
[1:56:09] [Applause]
[1:56:11] people wake up in the morning free from
[1:56:14] guilt and sin hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:56:18] don't care if my wife burnt my
[1:56:21] toast you know honey how I like my toast
[1:56:24] this egg is not it's solid
[1:56:30] egg I'm just trying to help you
[1:56:38] along so we're being
[1:56:41] reconciled that mean God is Rec what you
[1:56:46] lacked yeah he is now going to to give
[1:56:50] you what you lacked so that you could be
[1:56:55] reconciled and be on the same plane
[1:56:58] amen so the only thing he could give you
[1:57:01] was
[1:57:02] his amen was his what
[1:57:07] word
[1:57:09] my my and the word comes to
[1:57:14] his thank you so God had to have a
[1:57:18] prophet for the word to come to
[1:57:21] reconcile
[1:57:23] you so that's why you see churches
[1:57:25] churches churches all
[1:57:28] unbalanced they can't live right act
[1:57:30] right speak right dress right they're
[1:57:34] imbalanced but when the word came you
[1:57:38] could walk right talk right speak right
[1:57:40] act right live
[1:57:43] right cuz God's reconciled
[1:57:46] you and now you're no longer an enemy
[1:57:50] you're at peace with
[1:57:52] God
[1:57:54] hallelujah so you've exchanged your sin
[1:57:57] for the
[1:57:59] blood oh if you haven't done it this
[1:58:01] morning you can do it right now you can
[1:58:04] throw it in the sea of God's
[1:58:06] forgetfulness right now oh the blood of
[1:58:10] Jesus Precious Blood of
[1:58:13] Jesus thank Hallelujah exchange your
[1:58:18] sin
[1:58:20] yeah for
[1:58:22] sinlessness exchange your
[1:58:25] sin for
[1:58:27] Peace So then to be reconciled means
[1:58:31] you've exchanged one thing for
[1:58:34] another yeah
[1:58:37] amen it's the word
[1:58:41] used is to
[1:58:43] describe actually the exchange of
[1:58:47] coins to be of equal worth yeah
[1:58:52] amen see I'm trying to get you down the
[1:58:54] road righten because I want to show you
[1:58:56] a year of equal worth yeah amen so then
[1:59:00] to be reconciled goes back into the
[1:59:03] Greek and the Greek then lets you know
[1:59:06] to say to be reconciled is an exchanging
[1:59:09] of
[1:59:11] coins to come to the equal
[1:59:15] value of what's purchased amen
[1:59:20] all
[1:59:23] right so can I give you the Greek now
[1:59:26] that we're Greek Scholars from last
[1:59:29] night I gave you one word and think
[1:59:31] you're a Greek scholar I'll give you two
[1:59:34] and you'll have a
[1:59:37] PhD
[1:59:40] calaso calaso meant to legally reconcile
[1:59:46] two disputing
[1:59:48] parties
[1:59:51] so what it's making reference to is a
[1:59:54] court because it's a legal
[1:59:58] statement so in the court of God it's
[2:00:02] meant to reconcile two disputing parties
[2:00:06] amen the
[2:00:08] judge became my attorney amen hallelujah
[2:00:11] and he said you're not guilty Brother
[2:00:13] Ray it's a rigged court amen for the
[2:00:17] redeemed amen
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:20] [Laughter]
[2:00:23] Hallelujah so now we're talking in a
[2:00:25] court of law when two people or two
[2:00:27] parties are having a
[2:00:30] dispute so it's the Believers now being
[2:00:34] reconciled to God through Christ Jesus
[2:00:38] who was your
[2:00:39] Ransom he paid your
[2:00:42] Ransom have I lingered too long on this
[2:00:47] thought okay
[2:00:50] so now that that this is a court case
[2:00:52] brother Nathan have you ever gone to
[2:00:54] court that's a good thing we just see if
[2:00:57] we catch him huh he's not been to court

[2:01:37] Supreme
[2:01:38] judge showing he's
[2:01:40] Alpha he's not he's showing Alpha and
[2:01:45] Omega amen the beginning and the end and
[2:01:49] what an identification what quickening
[2:01:52] power he lets us see his coming this
[2:01:55] quickening power snatched us from death
[2:01:59] to
[2:02:00] life from being unequal to
[2:02:06] equal
[2:02:08] Hallelujah are you

[2:02:31] had to say change the word he said
[2:02:33] brother Tom it's
[2:02:38] okay it's okay I'm not that
[2:02:43] hurt
[2:02:44] worthy Yes means you're
[2:02:47] befitting amen you have the weight of
[2:02:52] another thing that is of same
[2:02:56] value I'm giving you
[2:02:58] definition to be worthy is having worth
[2:03:02] it's a quality that renders
[2:03:05] value it's a quality that renders value
[2:03:09] so I want to say value for
[2:03:16] value value for
[2:03:19] value yeah
[2:03:21] amen years ago I'm sorry I I digress but
[2:03:25] maybe this might
[2:03:26] help years ago I read an
[2:03:30] article and the article was a um an
[2:03:33] ambassador from England went to a
[2:03:36] province in
[2:03:37] China and of course you know India they
[2:03:40] were the big Conquering the world they
[2:03:42] were in IND uh England they were in
[2:03:45] India they were in China they were many
[2:03:47] places and in this one Ambassador he set
[2:03:51] up an office and this fellow comes in
[2:03:53] and cleans his office and and um a chief
[2:03:57] of the district comes in and uh he's got
[2:04:01] a package all wrapped up brother Ray and
[2:04:03] and he gives it to
[2:04:05] him gives it to
[2:04:07] him and oh thank you very much that's
[2:04:09] very kind of you right I just showed up
[2:04:12] I'm in the Ambassador here from England
[2:04:14] and you know I represent the king and
[2:04:16] queen and all that sort of stuff and so
[2:04:19] unpackaged it and the fellow that cleans
[2:04:21] his office comes walking in and
[2:04:24] goes
[2:04:26] what and he says what
[2:04:29] what he
[2:04:31] goes the
[2:04:33] vase that's from the 15th dynasty of
[2:04:37] whatever of
[2:04:40] chin and he goes you know how much
[2:04:43] that's
[2:04:44] worth and he says no it's just the chief
[2:04:47] and brought me a a
[2:04:49] pause he says that I looked it up it was
[2:04:52] worth
[2:04:53] $32,000 at the time that was when they
[2:04:56] were making like 50 cents an
[2:04:58] hour
[2:05:01] so the fellow says W that's that's way
[2:05:04] too much and he puts it on a nice little
[2:05:06] stand and and then the fellow that
[2:05:08] cleans his office says what are you
[2:05:09] going to
[2:05:10] do he says what do you mean what are
[2:05:12] going to do I took the gift graciously
[2:05:15] he says no no no you're in
[2:05:17] China he says what do you mean I'm in
[2:05:19] China he says in China if somebody gives
[2:05:23] you a
[2:05:24] gift you have to give a gift back of
[2:05:28] same
[2:05:32] value I think he left
[2:05:37] China no he didn't but that's an Eastern
[2:05:41] custom and brother Ram said we have to
[2:05:43] look at the Bible because it's an
[2:05:46] Eastern
[2:05:47] book so so then if Jesus gave his
[2:05:52] life and laid his life
[2:05:55] down because he felt you were a
[2:06:00] value hung on a
[2:06:03] cross suffered
[2:06:05] ridiculed beaten
[2:06:09] striped and
[2:06:11] died that's value surely this church can
[2:06:16] rise to the occasion and say I'm going
[2:06:18] to lay my life down for Jesus Christ I'm
[2:06:22] going to give him equal value I'm going
[2:06:24] to lay my life down for him I'm going to
[2:06:27] walk like him talk like
[2:06:30] him
[2:06:32] amen something of value yeah
[2:06:37] amen it's not an old
[2:06:40] story it's a
[2:06:42] reality that my God and savior came in
[2:06:45] Jesus was his
[2:06:47] name amen
[2:06:52] now we'll move
[2:06:56] to
[2:06:58] weighing and the word
[2:07:02] worthy let's turn to Revelation chapter
[2:07:16] 5 thank you for putting up with
[2:07:23] me it's
[2:07:26] 1:00 we'll wind her down for
[2:07:31] you but we're just starting
[2:07:35] actually I know that makes my wife
[2:07:38] nervous when I do
[2:07:43] that Revelation 5 chap chter 5 verse1
[2:07:47] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[2:07:48] that sat on the throne a book written
[2:07:50] within and on the backside seal and
[2:07:52] Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel
[2:07:55] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[2:07:58] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[2:08:01] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[2:08:06] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[2:08:10] able to open the book or
[2:08:13] neither to look
[2:08:16] thereon and I wept much because no man
[2:08:22] was found worthy to open and to read the
[2:08:27] book neither to look there on so so now
[2:08:34] I I sure don't want you to be nonchalant
[2:08:37] about what I'm talking about here yeah
[2:08:40] amen throughout 2,000
[2:08:44] years there was no one
[2:08:47] worthy to even look on the
[2:08:51] book let's turn to Revelation
[2:08:57] 10 no one worthy to take the book no one
[2:08:59] worthy to look on the
[2:09:01] book but then Revelation 10:1 says and
[2:09:04] there came another Mighty Angel and
[2:09:06] there came I saw another Mighty Angel
[2:09:09] come down from heaven clothed with
[2:09:13] a rainbow was upon his head and his face
[2:09:16] was were the Sun and his feet feet as
[2:09:18] were p uh pillars of fire and he had in
[2:09:22] his hand
[2:09:24] what a little book
[2:09:26] open so we all you've all known of
[2:09:29] course it was closed and we all know
[2:09:31] that that's Revelation 10:1 and now it's
[2:09:33] open but there was no one worthy to look
[2:09:36] on the book or to take the book there
[2:09:38] was no one found worthy but in this
[2:09:42] day I want you to get ahead of me
[2:09:44] actually right now but in this day there
[2:09:46] was a people that we're now called
[2:09:49] worthy come on not only to look on the
[2:09:52] book but to take the book not only to
[2:09:56] take the book but eat the
[2:09:58] book no generation no age was found
[2:10:03] worthy to look on it to take it but now
[2:10:07] in this age an angel came down handed it
[2:10:11] to Revelation
[2:10:12] 107 and he gave it to you take the book
[2:10:16] I take the book don't take the book eat
[2:10:19] the
[2:10:20] book come on people
[2:10:23] Rejoice 2,000 years no one was worthy to
[2:10:28] look on it but you've been given it you
[2:10:32] can eat it you can take it and you
[2:10:35] become the
[2:10:37] book value for
[2:10:41] [Applause]
[2:10:46] Value Praise His Holy
[2:10:50] [Music]
[2:10:52] name
[2:10:57] Hallelujah Luther wasn't worthy Wesley
[2:11:00] wasn't worthy col wasn't worthy ianus
[2:11:04] wasn't worthy no one was worthy to look
[2:11:07] on the
[2:11:08] book but in this
[2:11:12] day this
[2:11:14] scripture is being
[2:11:16] fulfilled in your
[2:11:19] [Applause]
[2:11:22] lifeall think of it young man think
[2:11:25] about
[2:11:27] it Andrew wasn't worthy huh Nathaniel
[2:11:32] wasn't
[2:11:33] worthy the disciples weren't
[2:11:36] worthy no one was worthy but the lamb
[2:11:39] was worthy and the lamb opened the seals
[2:11:43] took the book and his claiming work and
[2:11:47] in that that book was your name and
[2:11:50] you've been redeemed by a love
[2:11:53] divine are you still with me all right
[2:11:57] so now value for
[2:12:02] Value the word
[2:12:05] worthy maybe collectively because I
[2:12:08] don't want you to say the word worthy to
[2:12:10] me I want you to lift up your voice and
[2:12:13] say thou are
[2:12:15] worthy worthy Thou Are Worthy Lord Thou
[2:12:19] Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy to be
[2:12:25] praised in the manner of worthy it means
[2:12:29] axus a x i oos axus that's three great
[2:12:38] words you qualify now to be a teacher of
[2:12:43] Greek
[2:12:45] axus meaning weighing
[2:12:49] as much as so you're found
[2:12:52] worthy you're being now weighed at the
[2:12:56] same
[2:13:00] weight I wish I had a a scales here you
[2:13:04] know the old scales and they put the
[2:13:06] weight here and the and and what you
[2:13:09] were buying here and that they had it
[2:13:11] figured out what what was worth right
[2:13:14] and God called an unbalanced scale
[2:13:18] an Abomination because there were there
[2:13:21] were trades people that would have other
[2:13:23] weights in their pocket when they saw
[2:13:26] brother pastor Wayne come by dressed in
[2:13:28] a nice suit they would say hey he can
[2:13:31] afford
[2:13:32] this and they would change the weight
[2:13:34] right that's why I always when I go buy
[2:13:36] shopping I get I wear my old
[2:13:42] jeans
[2:13:45] secret so that and God hat it's an
[2:13:48] Abomination to God weight is weight what
[2:13:52] you purchase has to be of equal weight
[2:13:56] so now we're looking at
[2:13:57] worthy Worthy is actually meaning
[2:14:01] weighing as much as or it's of same
[2:14:05] value or of same
[2:14:07] worth it means then the weight of
[2:14:10] another thing is being like of same
[2:14:16] value in other other words its root
[2:14:19] meaning means balancing the
[2:14:24] scales so let me put it into a graphic
[2:14:27] form yes sir here's a
[2:14:30] scale and Jesus stood on the scale and
[2:14:33] the scale is up here now because it's it
[2:14:36] right has to get balanced so Jesus
[2:14:38] stepped on the stale
[2:14:40] worthy worthy so there has to be
[2:14:44] somebody that's because he hates an
[2:14:46] unbalanced scale
[2:14:49] right so there has to be a people that
[2:14:52] step on this side of the
[2:14:54] scale to make this scale equal
[2:15:00] value are you still here you're still
[2:15:03] there so the root meaning of that word
[2:15:05] is the balancing of
[2:15:08] scales it's applying to an expectation
[2:15:11] of something that will correspond to
[2:15:14] what the weight is on that side of the
[2:15:16] scale
[2:15:19] so now what we see
[2:15:21] today is a prophet coming in our hour in
[2:15:25] the church age book and now turning to
[2:15:28] the bride and saying
[2:15:32] Church you are
[2:15:35] worthy so now the church steps on the
[2:15:40] scale and the scale is not imbalanced
[2:15:43] because it's an Abomination to be
[2:15:46] imbalanced so the the bride steps on
[2:15:49] this side and the bridegroom steps on
[2:15:52] this side and the scale is perfectly
[2:15:58] balanced so what does that mean brother
[2:16:00] Tom that means the value of what Christ
[2:16:03] is is your
[2:16:06] value amen praise the Lord
[2:16:09] Jesus who said you're not worth
[2:16:12] something
[2:16:14] on who said you're
[2:16:16] unworthy said when the prophet has been
[2:16:21] told by the God himself to call a church
[2:16:26] worthy then you could say by the grace
[2:16:28] of God I know it's a it's sometimes a
[2:16:31] bitter pill to swallow but just swallow
[2:16:33] it we were unworthy but through the
[2:16:36] blood of Jesus Christ he ransomed me you
[2:16:39] Lord and gave what was lacking in my
[2:16:42] scale the same weight as what he is it
[2:16:46] wasn't me it was his blood which was his
[2:16:50] life in me that balanced out
[2:16:58] Christ is he
[2:17:00] worthy he is
[2:17:02] worthy worthy the lamb that was slain
[2:17:08] Deuteronomy 25 and3 says Thou shalt not
[2:17:11] have in thy
[2:17:12] bag this is now getting
[2:17:15] serious Thou shalt not have in thy bag
[2:17:18] other
[2:17:20] doctrines it doesn't say that I just
[2:17:23] threw that in for to bring it down to
[2:17:26] our level yeah good Thou shalt not have
[2:17:30] in thy bag divers
[2:17:34] weights a great and a small for self or
[2:17:37] for others I put Thou shalt not have in
[2:17:40] thine house divver measures a great and
[2:17:44] a small but Thou shalt have a perfect
[2:17:47] and just weight a perfect and just
[2:17:50] measure shalt thou have that thy days be
[2:17:55] lengthened in the land which the Lord
[2:17:58] thy God
[2:18:01] liveth how important is a balance
[2:18:07] scale as we get closer to the closing
[2:18:11] winding up
[2:18:14] times more and more pertinent
[2:18:18] that we do not have great or small or
[2:18:22] any idea that is contrary to thus saith
[2:18:27] the
[2:18:32] Lord a just weight and balance are the
[2:18:35] Lord's all the weights of the bag are
[2:18:38] his work so what it says here in the
[2:18:42] Hebrew meaning fair business and
[2:18:44] measures are pleasing to God
[2:18:48] weigh it out weigh it out weigh it out
[2:18:51] amen weigh the scale of God's word out
[2:18:54] is he worthy yes he's worthy is he
[2:18:57] worthy that you would lay your life down
[2:18:59] for Christ yes he is young people you'll
[2:19:03] never be sorry you will never be sorry
[2:19:08] you will never have an imbalanced
[2:19:16] scale a false
[2:19:20] balance is an
[2:19:24] Abomination it's really and this is
[2:19:27] where it goes if you want to keep on
[2:19:29] following the chain goes into
[2:19:32] idolatry because if you can add
[2:19:35] something that's not
[2:19:38] true you can keep on adding and going
[2:19:42] into areas you should not
[2:19:45] go God's given his word word to give us
[2:19:48] a perfect
[2:19:54] balance it's human nature and
[2:19:57] unfortunately human nature can get you
[2:19:59] in
[2:20:02] trouble to be
[2:20:05] unscrupulous it's human
[2:20:08] nature it takes
[2:20:12] Christ in your
[2:20:15] life to stay Hest
[2:20:25] I shall end up with the quote so that
[2:20:27] you won't I won't be leaving me

[2:20:37] 7
[2:20:39] no they are like
[2:20:42] him he is
[2:20:44] them they are like him even as John said
[2:20:49] they see him as he is for they are
[2:20:54] worthy do you realize who's saying
[2:20:58] this it's Jesus the worthy one
[2:21:04] himself this is the only one who is
[2:21:08] accounted worthy to take the book out of
[2:21:12] the hand who him who sits upon the
[2:21:14] throne and now this Worthy one is saying
[2:21:18] to his
[2:21:21] Saints who's his
[2:21:25] Saints you are
[2:21:32] worthy Hallelujah you are worthy he's
[2:21:37] the only one qualified that's right the
[2:21:41] only one qualified to
[2:21:44] judge and say
[2:21:49] you're
[2:21:57] worthy I would ask you to do me one
[2:22:02] favor at the closing of the
[2:22:04] service as I've preached on this
[2:22:07] part I'm
[2:22:09] worthy I would like you to say
[2:22:13] that the only reason I could ask you to
[2:22:16] say that is because he said you could
[2:22:18] you are that I couldn't ask you to say
[2:22:20] that you say oh no brother Tom I'm not
[2:22:22] worthy I mean we not even worthy of the
[2:22:24] being Charing that's the way we we have
[2:22:26] our attitude
[2:22:29] sometimes but if you want to take this
[2:22:31] little paragraph stick it on your fridge
[2:22:33] put it on your headboard put it by your
[2:22:35] night table do whatever you want to
[2:22:38] do but he wants if I could read the
[2:22:41] quote at the very
[2:22:45] beginning and say Jes Jesus is in
[2:22:49] you it's God manifesting himself in his
[2:22:52] last days in you it's the son of man
[2:22:56] revealing himself in
[2:23:00] you how could you say that without not
[2:23:05] knowing you're
[2:23:08] worthy so all the revelations that we
[2:23:12] have and all that God is revealing to us
[2:23:14] and will continue to reveal to us comes
[2:23:17] back to the very part if you say I'm no
[2:23:20] longer church but I'm bride the only way
[2:23:23] that you could say that this morning
[2:23:24] really without with a clear conscience
[2:23:27] knowing that you've been ransomed by the
[2:23:29] blood and he's paid your
[2:23:32] debt and he stepped on the scale and he
[2:23:35] gave you weight so that you could be
[2:23:38] equal with
[2:23:40] him the way you can
[2:23:42] say she is
[2:23:45] him is because you you can
[2:23:48] say

[2:41:00] morning it's been very powerful amen we
[2:41:02] certainly appreciate you've taken time
[2:41:05] to come and share the word and amen um
[2:41:08] and we appreciate you assigning a value
[2:41:11] to this congregation amen God bless you
[2:41:15] and thank thank you for assigning such a
[2:41:17] a high value to these people here today
[2:41:21] I I know that there's a there's a world
[2:41:23] out here would look at a group like this
[2:41:25] and they have a lot of low things to say
[2:41:28] but God has sent him here among you to
[2:41:31] say no that's not your value but your
[2:41:35] value is equal with almighty God now
[2:41:39] it's in the Book of Leviticus actually
[2:41:41] when the there was actually values
[2:41:43] assigned to people people and then there
[2:41:46] would be a ransom put in the courts for
[2:41:48] them and sometimes there would be
[2:41:50] someone they didn't know what to do so
[2:41:53] the the priest were given the job of
[2:41:55] assigning a value to Ransom the person
[2:41:59] and this morning you've had a priest
[2:42:02] stand in the office here and ass
[2:42:04] signning a value to this congregation
[2:42:06] and to you as a
[2:42:08] Believer God gave him the permission to
[2:42:11] assign that value to you and he stands
[2:42:15] there by the word of God and says now
[2:42:16] you're equal
[2:42:18] don't don't say anything less than that
[2:42:21] and I know maybe it would even be hard
[2:42:23] for you to
[2:42:25] believe but God who is rich in Mercy
[2:42:28] sent a prophet Among Us and he said life
[2:42:32] is so valuable that he wrote it on the
[2:42:34] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:42:36] foundation of the world and he said he
[2:42:38] went all the way to Chicago for one Soul
[2:42:41] he said because one soul is worth 10
[2:42:45] thousand
[2:42:47] worlds I'll tell you this this this
[2:42:50] Human Side Of You the sign the value
[2:42:52] brother BR said maybe just a few cents
[2:42:54] is what you're worth but the soul that
[2:42:57] you
[2:42:58] have brother Bram said it's so precious
[2:43:01] that God gave his own son's blood that
[2:43:04] he might redeem you and pay that ransom
[2:43:06] for you this morning I'll tell you it's
[2:43:08] a powerful it's a powerful reality it's
[2:43:11] and it you know what it takes more faith
[2:43:14] to believe that
[2:43:15] than to believe you're not worthy it
[2:43:18] really takes more faith to to agree with
[2:43:20] a man of God this morning and say that's
[2:43:22] nothing but the truth that's the truth
[2:43:24] and I believe that's the truth I I think
[2:43:26] that from my heart of this congregation
[2:43:28] and the men of God around the world and
[2:43:30] the congregations the value to me it's
[2:43:34] it's the cream of the crop when I hear
[2:43:37] uh when I hear people they go negative
[2:43:39] on them message people them message
[2:43:42] people I whoa what do you mean them m
[2:43:45] message people that's God's elect the
[2:43:48] most valuable thing in the world is
