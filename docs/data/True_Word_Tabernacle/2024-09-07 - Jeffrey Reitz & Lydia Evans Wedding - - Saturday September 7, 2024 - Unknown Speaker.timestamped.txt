[50:39] vows that will join them together as
[50:41] husband and wife we ask that you will
[50:44] bless this day and our time spent

[50:48] couple and make them a blessing all the
[50:50] days of their life for we ask this in
[50:52] Jesus name amen amen amen amen God bless
[50:57] you it's certainly an honor to be here
[51:00] today and to be able to be a part of
[51:02] this wonderful ceremony we want to thank
[51:04] each and every one of you that was able
[51:06] to come today to witness this um it's an
[51:09] amazing thing how much is done for a
[51:11] ceremony for a wedding ceremony but we
[51:14] know that it's done that way because
[51:16] it's a very important day this is a
[51:19] bride's day it's a day when the Lord has
[51:23] put these two together it was so
[51:25] important marriage that even the Lord
[51:28] visited a wedding and that was where he
[51:31] first uh began his works of Miracles was
[51:34] at a wedding and uh today we want to
[51:37] invite him to be a part of this wedding
[51:40] that he might be able to do something
[51:42] here a miracle like he done there but
[51:45] this time a miracle would be taking two
[51:48] lives and making them
[51:52] one in the
[51:54] scriptures the first marriage that it's
[51:56] recorded God performed
[52:00] himself the Bible tells us that he made
[52:03] man and when God looked upon man he said
[52:05] it's not good that a man should dwell
[52:08] long so I will make him help
[52:12] me and out of the ground the Lord God
[52:14] formed every beast of the field and
[52:17] every fowl of the air and he brought
[52:19] them unto
[52:21] Adam to see what he would call them and
[52:23] whatsoever Adam called every living
[52:26] creature that was the name thereof and
[52:28] Adam gave names to the cattles and to
[52:30] the fowl of the air and the Beast of the
[52:32] field but for
[52:34] Adam there was no any help meat for
[52:39] him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[52:42] to fall upon Adam and he slept and he
[52:45] took one of his ribs and he closed up
[52:47] his flesh instead thereof and the rib
[52:50] which the Lord had taken from the man
[52:52] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[52:54] man and Adam said now this is bone of my
[52:57] bone and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall
[52:59] be called woman because she was taken
[53:02] out of the man therefore shall a man
[53:05] leave his father and mother and shall
[53:06] cleave unto his wife as they shall be
[53:10] one
[53:11] flesh there was a lot of there was a lot
[53:14] of animals in the garden but Adam was
[53:16] still
[53:17] alone it's not it's not that other
[53:20] people are not around or that there's
[53:23] not a world of people but a person can
[53:25] live in the world live alone and not
[53:28] have that that part of him that God
[53:32] created for
[53:33] him brother bham says that the greatest
[53:36] thing that God could give a man outside
[53:39] of Salvation is a wife and she's to
[53:42] comfort him to help him to bless him and
[53:46] to console him and to be a real
[53:49] companion to
[53:51] him so God didn't only just give Adam
[53:55] animals and companion ship in that
[53:57] manner but he gave one that he brought
[53:59] from his own
[54:00] self uh the scripture records that the
[54:03] that the bone was taken from his rib
[54:06] wasn't taken from his head because a
[54:08] woman should never rule over a man was
[54:11] not taken from his foot because a woman
[54:14] should never be under the foot of a man
[54:16] but it was taken from the rib out of his
[54:19] side next to his heart because that's
[54:21] where a woman should walk a wife should
[54:23] be is next to a man the one that God
[54:27] created for
[54:28] you I believe it's Eternal I believe God
[54:32] makes Eternal mates the prophet of God
[54:35] said love never did begin and it never
[54:37] will end and it's Eternal and When a Man
[54:41] Loves a Woman and he marries her just
[54:43] because she's pretty there'll be an end
[54:45] to that but when a man finds a woman
[54:48] that he loves he don't know why but he
[54:50] loves her and she finds the man that she
[54:53] loves and no matter what he looks like
[54:55] he loves her and she loves him that's an
[54:59] eternal Maiden Glory death nor nothing
[55:02] else will ever separate them because
[55:04] they are from eternity and they stepped
[55:06] out into a space of time and will return
[55:09] back to Eternity eternity drop down in a
[55:13] body called time then it goes right back
[55:16] up into eternity again I believe when
[55:19] God brings two together for marriage
[55:22] he's bringing together those Eternal
[55:24] mates that was a part of of each other
[55:26] to begin with and a part of each other
[55:29] today to thank God and could bring
[55:32] together a man and a woman and you've
[55:34] had a lot of relationships in your life
[55:35] with your parents with your families
[55:38] with your churches but this will be the
[55:40] most important relationship of your life
[55:43] this relationship will go far beyond any
[55:46] relationship you've ever known and you
[55:49] too will be placed together to fulfill
[55:52] what I believe is a deeper purpose for
[55:54] God what one person
[55:56] maybe you serve God and he's give you a
[55:59] purpose in this life but when you come
[56:01] together as a man and wife you as
[56:03] Christians will be able to do your
[56:06] purpose on Earth much better than you
[56:08] could alone see it's not good that a man
[56:12] dwell
[56:13] alone one of the wisest men who ever
[56:16] live said this that two are better than
[56:21] one because they have a good reward for
[56:24] their labor for if they fall
[56:26] they have one to lift up his fellow but
[56:29] woe to him that is alone that faileth
[56:31] for he have no one to help him and again
[56:34] if two lie together then they have no
[56:36] heat but how could be one warm alone and
[56:40] if one Prevail against him two shall
[56:42] withstanding and a three-fold cord is
[56:46] not easily broken then therefore it's
[56:49] not just that God puts two together but
[56:51] there must be a third one there must be
[56:54] an extra person in this marriage and
[56:56] that third person must be God the Bible
[56:59] says in Ephesians 5 that wives should
[57:01] submit their themselves under their
[57:03] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[57:05] husband is the head of the wife even as
[57:07] Christ is the head of the church and he
[57:09] is savior of the body therefore as the
[57:12] church is subject so let wives be
[57:14] subject unto their own and husbands
[57:15] should love their
[57:17] wives the scripture tells us that every
[57:20] man has a head and that head is God and
[57:23] that every woman has a head and that's
[57:25] her husband husband and when you have a
[57:27] man under God and a woman under that man
[57:30] the three of them together will make a a
[57:33] three-fold cord that cannot be easily
[57:37] broken because in your life comes God
[57:41] and God himself the Bible said is love
[57:45] and one thing we found out about love is
[57:48] Love Never
[57:49] Fails love always makes a way when there
[57:53] is no way I I would say today as you
[57:56] in this wedding Arrangement and you're
[57:59] having this ceremony you're going to
[58:01] leave here
[58:02] today there's a lot of advice you're
[58:04] going to get in your
[58:07] marriage but the real advice and the
[58:10] greatest advice you'll ever receive is
[58:11] love one
[58:13] another if you really just fall in love
[58:15] with one another so deeply love will
[58:18] make a way when there's just no way love
[58:22] will cause you to forgive one another
[58:24] love will cause you to be able to stop
[58:26] speak to one another and love is proven
[58:29] that it'll be able to keep together a
[58:31] home even against the test of
[58:35] time marriage is a miracle and I believe
[58:38] a miracle that should be a miracle of
[58:40] love Paul explains love when he says
[58:42] love is patient and it's able to ex it
[58:46] it's patient and let me just say it like
[58:48] this it's able to accept or tolerate
[58:51] delays problems suffering without
[58:54] becoming annoyed or anxious
[58:57] love is
[58:58] kind charity envieth not charity vth not
[59:01] itself and it does not boast it is not
[59:03] puffed up and it's not
[59:06] proud it doeth not behave itself
[59:09] unseemly love is never
[59:12] rude see it seeketh not its own it's not
[59:15] even selfish it's not easily provoked it
[59:18] doesn't become angry quickly it thinketh
[59:21] no evil and this is one of my favorite
[59:23] parts of the scripture where it says
[59:25] love think no evil because what it
[59:28] really is speaking of is love does not
[59:30] keep a records of
[59:31] wrong that's one of the most powerful
[59:33] things that could be given in a home and
[59:36] I'll say today as a guest it's not just
[59:38] in just this home but it would be good
[59:39] in every home in every church and every
[59:43] marriage if we was like God who kept no
[59:46] wrong who we we marked not wrong we
[59:49] didn't impute the trespasses one to the
[59:52] other but yet there was forgiveness the
[59:54] Bible said rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[59:57] of rejoice and truth it beareth all
[59:59] things Love cover all things it
[1:00:03] believeth all things it hopeth all
[1:00:05] things and here's the thing it endureth
[1:00:07] all things and charity never fails love
[1:00:11] fails not at any
[1:00:13] time I just love this that
[1:00:17] love cannot
[1:00:19] fail so if you want a marriage that
[1:00:21] lasts and a marriage that can stand the
[1:00:23] test and trials of life just love one
[1:00:26] another deeply and the more you love the
[1:00:29] Greater Life you'll
[1:00:32] have Jeffrey at this time we're going to
[1:00:35] enter the vows the

[1:04:39] now you might at this time maybe you've
[1:04:43] attended many weddings and you've always
[1:04:45] seen it in the pictures of how that a
[1:04:48] bride wears a
[1:04:51] veil this Veil wearing came from the
[1:04:54] scriptures
[1:04:56] as early back as when Isaac and Rebecca
[1:04:58] were
[1:04:59] married the Bible tells us that Rebecca
[1:05:03] left her home and Isaac his father's
[1:05:05] tent and they met in a
[1:05:08] field and the Bible tells us that while
[1:05:10] elaser was leading Rebecca into the
[1:05:14] field that Rebecca lifted up her eyes
[1:05:16] and when she saw Isaac she lit off of
[1:05:20] her camel for she said unto the servant
[1:05:23] what man is this that walketh to meet us
[1:05:24] in the field
[1:05:26] and the servant had said it's my
[1:05:29] master and therefore she took a veil and
[1:05:32] she covered her
[1:05:34] face the prophet of God says this why
[1:05:37] does a woman every time she gets married
[1:05:39] put a veil over her face it's because
[1:05:42] she's coming to her husband the head
[1:05:45] just like Rebecca she put a veil over
[1:05:47] her face to meet Isaac she has no more
[1:05:50] head Isaac is her
[1:05:53] head and the church ought to be
[1:05:55] submissive to the word that it veils its
[1:05:58] own face see the nature of a woman is to
[1:06:02] submit to a man and that's what the
[1:06:04] church ought to do submit to Christ and
[1:06:07] his word and his doctrines for she takes
[1:06:10] no thought for herself she now she has
[1:06:13] no head Christ is her
[1:06:16] head now the Bible records in
[1:06:18] Revelations 3 when it's writing to the
[1:06:21] Philadelphian
[1:06:23] age it says this thing saith he he that
[1:06:25] is Holy and he that is true and he that
[1:06:28] hath the Key of David and he that
[1:06:31] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[1:06:33] and no man open the scripture is
[1:06:35] declaring that the Lord Jesus is the one
[1:06:39] that's the ruler over the
[1:06:41] church in this in the exposition of the
[1:06:44] church ages the prophet takes this and
[1:06:46] says what that Key of David
[1:06:49] signifies is a mere Shadow being
[1:06:51] fulfilled now in Jesus standing in the
[1:06:54] lampstands
[1:06:55] it has to do with our Lord after his
[1:06:57] resurrection and not his Earthly
[1:06:59] pilgrimage but what does this key
[1:07:02] signify is the answer lays in the
[1:07:03] position of the key for the key was not
[1:07:06] in his hand but it was worn around it
[1:07:08] was not worn around his neck it was not
[1:07:11] placed in the hands of other men or the
[1:07:13] verse could have not have said he alone
[1:07:16] has the use of that key for he alone
[1:07:19] opens and shuts and no man has the right
[1:07:21] but Jesus himself isn't that right but
[1:07:24] where is the key
[1:07:26] it's on his shoulder but what does a
[1:07:29] shoulder have to do with it in Isaiah
[1:07:32] 9:6 the Bible said the government shall
[1:07:34] be upon his shoulder but what does this
[1:07:38] mean the answer lies the phrase the
[1:07:40] government on his shoulder it comes from
[1:07:43] a wedding in the Eastern ceremony when
[1:07:46] the bride has been committed to the
[1:07:47] groom that she takes off her veil and
[1:07:50] places it on the groom's shoulder
[1:07:53] signifying not only is she un under his
[1:07:56] Dominion but she has transferred her
[1:07:58] rights to him that he is the head but
[1:08:02] also that he Bears the
[1:08:04] responsibility and care and that he and
[1:08:07] he alone no one else no other man no
[1:08:09] other power has any right or any
[1:08:13] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:08:15] Key of David God being
[1:08:18] Sovereign he forew
[1:08:20] this and today we're going to fulfill
[1:08:24] this ceremony as our brother David would
[1:08:27] come to transfer this
[1:08:30] Veil to this
[1:08:53] man as the father would place this
[1:08:56] Veil upon the husband's right
[1:08:59] shoulder it is a symbol of the
[1:09:02] transference of headship from a father
[1:09:06] to a
[1:09:07] husband
[1:09:09] Jeffrey you may kiss your bride
