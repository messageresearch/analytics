[33:18] here amen this morning brother Wendell
[33:21] was preaching on Mighty
[33:23] Men amen Mighty women and uh made me
[33:27] think of a young man named Gideon in the
[33:31] Bible uh how that the angel greeted him
[33:34] came with a message to Gideon in a time
[33:37] when there really was a need for
[33:38] somebody to take up the mantle somebody
[33:40] to somebody to carry on what the
[33:42] forefathers had had left it's a it's a
[33:45] great story for young people each one of
[33:47] you in your own generation you're a
[33:49] Gideon you're somebody waiting for a
[33:50] call waiting for a purpose waiting for a
[33:53] uh waiting for an overcoming
[33:58] power and you know so a man appears to
[34:00] Gideon preaches him a sermon just like
[34:02] we heard this morning he says hail
[34:04] Gideon thou Mighty Man Mighty Man of
[34:07] Valor and you know what it is uh in our
[34:09] human
[34:10] Minds uh Gideon in his Humanity he
[34:14] starts to resist that he had a few
[34:16] things to say about it he said you're
[34:17] calling me a mighty man but I come from
[34:19] this kind of a household and we got
[34:21] these kind of problems going on and
[34:22] we're not seeing the power of God like
[34:24] it ought to be and all those things were
[34:26] true about
[34:28] amen but then all of a sudden there was
[34:29] a
[34:30] realization a revelation and he realized
[34:33] that that that man that was talking to
[34:35] him that was more than a man all of a
[34:37] sudden he realized that that was the
[34:38] angel of the Lord that had something to
[34:40] say to him we didn't hear from a man
[34:41] this morning amen we saw our brother
[34:43] Wendell take the pulpit but it was not a
[34:45] man it was the angel of the Lord that
[34:46] had a message to young people how many
[34:48] believe you got a message tonight amen
[34:50] he's how many want to receive it say God
[34:53] I don't want to argue with your calling
[34:54] I want to hear it I want to believe it I
[34:56] want to be that that mighty man I want
[34:57] to be that Mighty young woman amen
[34:59] that's anointed to overcome Le oosa amen
[35:02] we want to just answer his call let's
[35:04] stand tonight as we just welcome the
[35:06] Lord amen and let's receive let's
[35:10] believe what the angel has for us
[35:12] tonight

[37:36] Bibles let's turn to Matthew 4:1 such an
[37:39] honor to be here this evening appreciate

[37:44] Nathan to to minister the this youth
[37:46] service tonight um many of y'all know me
[37:49] that haven't heard me Minister I'm just
[37:51] a simple preacher but I pray something
[37:53] can be said tonight to be a blessing
[37:56] amen in Matthew 4:1 and it's a lengthy
[37:58] passage of
[38:00] scripture but we know this is right
[38:02] after John the Baptist or John the
[38:04] Baptist baptized Jesus and the spirit of
[38:06] God descends upon Him Matthew 4:1 then
[38:08] when Jesus was led up of the spirit Into
[38:11] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[38:13] devil and when he got fasted 40 days and
[38:16] 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and
[38:19] when the tempter came to him he said if
[38:21] thou be the Son of God command these
[38:23] stones to be made bread but he answered
[38:26] and said it is written man shall not
[38:28] live by bread alone but by every word
[38:30] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[38:33] then the devil taketh him up into the
[38:34] holy city and Seth him upon the Pinnacle
[38:37] of the temple and saith unto him if thou
[38:39] be the Son of God cast thyself down for
[38:42] it is written he shall give his angels
[38:45] charge concerning thee and in their
[38:47] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[38:49] any time thou Dash their foot against a
[38:51] stone and Jesus answered Jesus said unto
[38:54] him it is written again Thou shalt not
[38:56] temp the Lord thy God again the devil
[38:59] taketh him up into an exceeding high
[39:00] mountain and showeth him all the
[39:02] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[39:04] them and saith unto him all these things
[39:07] will I give thee if thou will fall down
[39:09] and worship me and then Jesus saith unto
[39:12] him get thee hence Satan for it is
[39:14] written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[39:16] God in him only shalt thou serve amen
[39:20] can we bow our heads this afternoon dear
[39:22] gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an
[39:24] honor and a privilege it is to come into
[39:26] your pray presence Lord God as we felt
[39:28] you this morning and seen you walk the
[39:30] aisles and touch the hearts Lord God I
[39:32] believe you're the same yesterday today
[39:34] and forever father Lord I ask that you
[39:36] would move once again in the hearts of
[39:38] your people Lord walk the aisles father
[39:40] Lord we're a needy people father and
[39:42] only you can meet the needs Lord I ask
[39:45] these things in your precious name amen
[39:47] amen you may be seated and if I had a
[39:49] subject tonight it would be the season
[39:52] of pressure this is something I've been
[39:54] preaching on for the last few Services
[39:57] back home so I'm be putting a few
[39:59] different thoughts together so hopefully
[40:00] it can all all come together but I want
[40:02] to start off by reading a quote that is
[40:04] familiar to us all brother Brandon would
[40:06] say unless we suffer with him we cannot
[40:09] reign with him you have to suffer to
[40:11] Reign the reason for this is that a
[40:14] character simply is never made without
[40:17] suffering character is a victory not a
[40:20] gift and I just like how he puts that
[40:22] character as a victory not a gift that's
[40:25] not something we have to earn so to
[40:26] speak but it's something that's not just
[40:28] given to us we got to fight to obtain
[40:31] you know I think as a child we're giv
[40:33] clothes we're giv toys and it's not
[40:35] something that uh that we try to take
[40:37] care of because we didn't have to buy it
[40:39] oursel it was given to us so if we lose
[40:41] it we're going to get another one if we
[40:43] get hos in our jeans we're going to get
[40:44] some more jeans or if we lose our hat
[40:47] mama's going to buy us another hat but
[40:49] once we grow up and we start to pay for
[40:51] those things we're earning those things
[40:53] and now we're no longer willing to throw
[40:55] it away but we're going want to fight to
[40:57] obtain it you see and I think that's the
[40:59] way it is with the character of God if
[41:01] it's something that is just given to us
[41:03] every time we're in a Temptation every
[41:05] time we're in a struggle every time
[41:07] we're in a pressure we're willing to
[41:09] throw it away because we didn't uh we
[41:11] didn't fight for it but once it's a
[41:13] struggle to obtain it once it's a fight
[41:16] to obtain it you're not willing to throw
[41:18] it away and we're living in a time where
[41:21] the Satan is Satan is putting every gun
[41:23] every tactic everything he has have the
[41:26] young people of today but I believe
[41:28] there's something on the inside of the
[41:30] young people that we're not throwing it
[41:32] away but we're fighting to keep it oh my
[41:35] brother Brandon continues on to say a
[41:37] man without character can't rain because
[41:40] power apart from character is satanic
[41:43] but Power with character is fit to rule
[41:46] and so we can look at dictators
[41:48] throughout the span of the world Hitler
[41:51] Stalin melini Saddam Hussein all of
[41:53] these men had power but they had no
[41:56] character to use it and we see they turn
[41:58] into dictators and they did more harm
[42:00] than good and so God is wanting somebody
[42:03] on Earth that's not going to abuse the
[42:05] power that he's given them but somebody
[42:08] that can operate it under the character
[42:10] of his own likeness you see God wants
[42:13] somebody on Earth to manifest his life
[42:16] manifest his thoughts manifest his
[42:18] desires and without the character of God
[42:21] we're going to do what we want to do
[42:23] what I want to do what what my opinions
[42:25] are what my ideas are but once the
[42:28] character of God is on the inside it's
[42:31] no longer me I but now it's Christ we
[42:34] got one purpose that's the kingdom we
[42:36] got one agenda that's the kingdom and
[42:39] that's what God wants on Earth today is
[42:41] a bride that is bone of his bone flesh
[42:43] of his flesh life of his life power of
[42:47] his power oh my somebody has come under
[42:50] the character of God and is manifesting
[42:53] his life brother brandom continues on to
[42:56] say and since he wants us to share even
[42:58] his throne on the same basis that he
[43:01] overcame and is sat down in his father's
[43:03] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[43:06] with him so it's an overcoming process
[43:09] you see it's not just going through
[43:11] pressure it's overcoming the pressure
[43:13] it's not just going through suffering
[43:15] it's overcoming the suffering because we
[43:18] got many people that's been through this
[43:19] they've been through that they've been
[43:21] through this they've been done wrong but
[43:23] that did they overcome those situations
[43:25] it's not just going through hard times
[43:28] we got to overcome it you see because it
[43:30] can have the opposite effect pressure
[43:32] can either build up or it can destroy
[43:35] and the way and the way we respond to it
[43:37] determines our outcome in that pressure
[43:40] you see I believe pressure can build up
[43:43] such a faith in a young people that you
[43:45] can move mountains but the same pressure
[43:48] can destroy confidence where you don't
[43:50] know what is right you don't know what
[43:52] is wrong you don't know what to believe
[43:54] in so you got to resp respond the right
[43:56] way during the pressure and overcome the
[43:59] pressure and this is my favorite part
[44:02] about this quote brother brandom says
[44:03] thank you and brother brandom says this
[44:05] and the little temporary suffering that
[44:07] we go through now is not worthy to be
[44:11] compared to the tremendous Glory that
[44:14] will be revealed in us when he comes
[44:16] he's letting us know that the pressure
[44:19] we're going through the suffering we're
[44:21] going through is temporal but what we're
[44:24] going to gain from it is eternal oh
[44:27] that's why we can't give up in the
[44:28] pressure we can't give up in the hard
[44:31] times we can't give up in the suffering
[44:34] because we're living in a season of time
[44:36] but all of eternity is waiting for you
[44:38] oh that trial that you're going through
[44:40] is a season that the suffering you're
[44:42] going through is a season but all of
[44:45] eternity has been opened up to the young
[44:47] people of this generation that's why we
[44:50] got to fight we got to press this ain't
[44:52] time to lay down this ain't time to give
[44:55] up it's this is time to fight to obtain
[44:58] the character of God oh my this is time
[45:01] to fight you see the Bible lets us know
[45:04] that we got to press for it Revelations
[45:07] 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit
[45:10] all things he that overcometh so
[45:13] somebody it can't be pushed over by the
[45:16] devil but you got to fight for it you
[45:18] see the devil ain't just going to roll
[45:19] over and give you the victory but you
[45:22] got to fight for it you see the Bible
[45:24] would tell us in Luke 16 and 16 the law
[45:27] when the prophets were unto John since
[45:29] that time the kingdom of God has
[45:31] preached and every man presseth into it
[45:34] so anybody that's wanting to get into it
[45:37] has to fight for it has to press for it
[45:39] you see but pressure is incredible
[45:42] pressure can influence pressure can
[45:44] persuade pressure can intimidate so
[45:47] pressure can push you away from the
[45:49] things of God or to the things of God
[45:52] you see intimidation is a strong force
[45:54] you see how many I'm sure some's got
[45:56] their driver's license how many has ever
[45:58] been driving down the highway and you're
[46:00] in the fast lane and you're going too
[46:02] slow for the guy behind you what he's
[46:04] going to do is he's going to get behind
[46:06] you on your tail and he's trying to
[46:08] pressure you to get over even though
[46:11] you're doing what is right you're going
[46:12] the legal speed I'm ashamed to say but
[46:14] I'm one of those guys that likes the
[46:16] pressure you know to get over hey I'm I
[46:18] want to get where I'm going what I'm
[46:19] doing is I'm pressuring him I'm
[46:21] intimidating him trying to get him the
[46:24] move and oh my that's what the devil
[46:26] does with the young people of the day
[46:29] through pornography through lust through
[46:31] gossip through the spirits of the day
[46:33] he's trying to pressure you to move off
[46:36] of what God has given you in this
[46:38] generation oh we don't got to give into
[46:40] the voices of the world oh my brother
[46:42] Brandon preaches a message called the
[46:44] voice of God in these last days he talks
[46:47] about voices that are trying to dead in
[46:50] the voice of the supernatural trying to
[46:52] deaden the influence of the supernatural
[46:55] he the influence influence is a very
[46:57] important thing it can it can it can uh
[46:59] builds up your character the word
[47:01] influence means to mode character so
[47:03] you're either going to be characterized
[47:06] after God or after the things of the
[47:08] world you see brother brandom talks
[47:10] about politics he says politics has a
[47:12] voice and it's now crep into the church
[47:15] where the the the the voice of politics
[47:18] has a stronger pull than the voice of
[47:20] God and then he says he he talks about
[47:23] Hollywood he says Hollywood has a voice
[47:26] and now we look at the young people
[47:28] today he says uh except the pattern you
[47:31] say you you can look at somebody that
[47:33] comes out of Hollywood he says then
[47:35] watch everybody else start to dress like
[47:37] them start to comb their hair like them
[47:40] he says it's an influence it's a voice
[47:43] that is making people dress like that
[47:46] and so if the power of Hollywood has
[47:48] that kind of an influence what about the
[47:51] things of God oh what about the voice of
[47:53] God he can take a young people and turn
[47:56] them into a Powerhouse you see you might
[47:58] be a young girl or a young boy you might
[48:01] not be a preacher or a singer but you
[48:03] get under the influence of the voice of
[48:06] God it will turn you into one of those
[48:08] David's mighty men that brother W was
[48:10] talking about this morning but brother
[48:12] brandham talks about Hollywood and he
[48:14] says now it's become the pattern and
[48:17] that just stood out to me it's become
[48:19] the pattern it's become the the the the
[48:21] new normal and now we feel like the
[48:23] outcast we look at Hollywood and the
[48:25] people that are dressing like Hollywood
[48:28] and now we feel like we need to fit in
[48:30] with them even though we're living the
[48:32] right life your girls got your your L
[48:34] care and your long dresses you young men
[48:37] are dressing like gentlemen but now
[48:39] we're feeling the pressure to look like
[48:42] the pattern of the world oh my it's
[48:44] intimidation that is trying to get you
[48:47] to move off of what is right oh my but
[48:50] you see we don't got to give in to the
[48:52] pressure if you can just fight against
[48:55] the pressures of the day we won't look
[48:58] like Hollywood we won't look like the
[48:59] things of the world but we will look
[49:01] like Jesus Christ we will show the
[49:04] character and the life of Jesus Christ
[49:07] oh my you see brother brandom talks
[49:09] about Matt Dylan in that message he says
[49:11] Mount Dylan he was a bad guy he says he
[49:14] would wait outside of Dodge City and he
[49:16] would wait for the criminals to come out
[49:18] of the city and he would shoot him in
[49:20] the back he says he wasn't a good guy
[49:22] but now Hollywood has picked him up and
[49:25] made him into a made him into a good guy
[49:28] made him into a superhero and he says
[49:30] now the kids and this is back in the 60s
[49:33] I believe he says now the kids are
[49:35] wearing cowboy hats and are trying to
[49:38] mimic Matt Dylan he says that's all fine
[49:40] and all but now they know more they know
[49:43] more about Matt Dylan than they do about
[49:45] Jesus Christ what is it it's pressure
[49:48] that is trying to mow a generation and
[49:50] that is way back then but what about
[49:52] today we got spirits that are trying to
[49:55] promote a generation to look like the
[49:58] the the children of the world but you
[50:00] are an oddb you're not meant to fit in
[50:03] you're not meant to look like Hollywood
[50:04] you're not meant to look like the
[50:06] magazines you are meant to look like Ms
[50:09] Jesus Christ with the character of Jesus
[50:13] Christ on the inside you may say brother
[50:15] Josh you don't know what I'm going
[50:17] through I I'm only 25 I've been there I
[50:19] feel the pressures of the world that
[50:22] come against me I felt the pressures
[50:24] that I wanted to fit in I thought I was
[50:26] cool when I turned my hat on backwards
[50:28] and I went to the basketball court I did
[50:30] not look too very cool but I wanted to
[50:32] fit in I wanted to fit into society that
[50:35] pressure is a genuine thing but you got
[50:38] to fight against it you see the Bible
[50:40] would give us some examples that on the
[50:42] other side of the press is the victory
[50:45] you look at the Bible talks about the
[50:47] lame man but wanted to get to Jesus but
[50:49] he couldn't get to Jesus because of the
[50:52] press the Bible says the Bible says his
[50:54] friends pick picked up his bed and took
[50:56] him to the place where Jesus was
[50:58] preaching but he could not get inside
[51:01] because of the press and I thought my
[51:03] this is the kind of friends that I want
[51:05] to have those friends looked at that and
[51:07] said my the pressure is great we cannot
[51:10] get inside where Jesus is that but I'm
[51:12] willing to fight I'm willing to make a
[51:15] way so that we can get in front of Jesus
[51:18] Christ you know what they started to do
[51:20] they took off the shingles started to
[51:22] take the roof apart and lowered the lame
[51:24] man in front of Jesus so that he could
[51:27] see the victory oh my you don't want
[51:29] friends that are pressuring you away
[51:31] from Jesus I'm preach you now you don't
[51:34] want friends that has taken you away
[51:37] from the message of the hour you want
[51:39] friends when you're in the time of need
[51:41] when you're in the time of pressure when
[51:43] you're in a struggle they would say Hey
[51:45] brother let me pray with you I was
[51:47] reading a quote today let me show you
[51:49] this and encourage you and that should
[51:51] to give you an encouragement as as
[51:54] friends to stick up for one another in
[51:56] the time of pressure let me be one of
[51:59] those friends hey you don't got to go
[52:01] down defeated you don't got to backslide
[52:04] you don't got to turn away but let me
[52:05] take the shingles off let me take the
[52:08] roof apart so that you can get in front
[52:11] of the supernatural hey and I say this
[52:13] evening the shingles have been taken off
[52:15] the roof has been taken off the
[52:17] Supernatural is inside of the building
[52:20] if you've got a need Jesus Christ is
[52:23] walking the house touching the heart
[52:25] changing lives if you're willing to
[52:27] press for it you got to be willing to
[52:30] fight for it he's not just going to give
[52:32] up and give it to you you've got to
[52:34] fight for it you've got to press for it
[52:37] there's some agonizing that's got to
[52:38] take
[52:40] place oh Hallelujah the woman with the
[52:43] yeshu of
[52:44] blood the Bible says when she heard
[52:47] about Jesus she come to touch Jesus but
[52:50] the Press was too great she couldn't
[52:52] touch Jesus but she was willing to fight
[52:55] she was willing to crawl and let let let
[52:58] me tell you something sometimes you got
[53:00] to crawl past the pride you got to crawl
[53:03] past the self-esteem and the pride and
[53:06] the name that you built up for yourself
[53:08] so that you can touch the H of His
[53:10] Garment because once she touched the hym
[53:13] of His Garment the character of Christ
[53:15] started to reflect itself the characters
[53:18] of Christ started to reflect itself
[53:20] stuff you know brother brandom says that
[53:22] in the beginning before there was a sun
[53:24] before there was a moon it was just God
[53:26] he says inside of God was
[53:28] characteristics he had the
[53:30] characteristics to be a Healer to be a
[53:33] savior to be a deliverer but since he
[53:35] was God Alone there was nobody to
[53:38] express that to oh my so every time the
[53:41] god comes and heals your body that's the
[53:44] character of Christ reflecting in your
[53:46] body oh come on now every time God comes
[53:50] and gives you a renewing that's the
[53:52] character of Christ reflecting it itself
[53:55] to the world letting the world know that
[53:58] God ain't God alone anymore he's got a
[54:01] body on Earth come on somebody God wants
[54:04] a body on Earth that he can live through
[54:08] that he can reflect through you know
[54:10] brother brandom says that you're God's
[54:11] advertising agent you know he said that
[54:14] he says one time he was driving down the
[54:16] road and he SE a billboard and the
[54:18] billboard had one word hungry and he
[54:21] says that billboard wasn't to attract
[54:23] the ones that were looking for a call
[54:25] wasn't to attract the ones that were
[54:27] looking for a hotel it was to attract
[54:30] the ones that were hungry oh my and he
[54:32] says you're God's billboard you're to
[54:34] attract the ones that are hungry how has
[54:38] that taking place for the Josh the
[54:40] character of God is on the inside
[54:42] letting the world know there is the
[54:45] resurrected savior hey if there's never
[54:48] a time for the character of Christ to
[54:51] reflect itself it's today we got
[54:53] denomination after denomination
[54:55] claiming to be Christians claiming to
[54:57] know God but they're living a different
[54:59] life so if there's ever a time for a
[55:02] body to estain the pressure and reflect
[55:05] the character of God it is today oh my
[55:09] the Bible also tells us about zakus we
[55:12] sing about about zakus as a kid but I
[55:15] started to read these scriptures and
[55:17] this just stood out to me the Bible says
[55:19] he desired to see Jesus and who he was
[55:23] and that just stood out to me brother
[55:24] Nathan he didn't want to just see the
[55:26] body of Jesus he wanted to see who was
[55:28] on the inside he wanted to see who he
[55:31] really was because many people is seeing
[55:34] the body and calling him the elth many
[55:37] people is seeing the body and calling
[55:39] him the prince of the Devils many people
[55:42] is seeing the body I want to look past
[55:44] the body and see what is on the inside
[55:48] and little church everybody hear sermons
[55:50] we need to go past the sermons and see
[55:53] what is inside of the sermon
[55:55] hey there's many there's millions of
[55:57] people listening to the tapes but they
[55:59] cannot see the supernatural if you've
[56:01] got a desire to see Jesus and who he
[56:04] really is you can press you can fight
[56:08] past the pressure to see the
[56:10] supernatural you see the Bible says that
[56:12] he sought to see Jesus and who he was
[56:15] but could not because of the press
[56:18] because of the pressure was keeping him
[56:21] from seeing the supernatural you know
[56:23] what the Bible says he done though he
[56:24] knew where Jesus was going to go by and
[56:28] I just love that he knew where he was
[56:29] going to go and so what he did was he
[56:31] climbed up the tree brother the brandom
[56:33] says he got to the fork of the tree
[56:35] where the Old Testament and the New
[56:37] Testament come together and that put him
[56:39] in a position to see the supernatural oh
[56:43] my what I love about it is Jesus is
[56:45] walking by so now it's no longer zakus
[56:48] trying to see the supernatural now God
[56:51] is walking by his way so that he can see
[56:54] the super Supernatural he done fought he
[56:56] done pressed he done fought past all of
[56:59] the pressure now he is in position oh my
[57:03] and here comes Jesus walking by it ain't
[57:06] zakus saying Jesus and now it's Jesus
[57:08] saying zakus Oh my he done F past all
[57:12] the pressure he done fought past all of
[57:15] the pride he done fought past all of the
[57:18] the Skeptics and the naysayers and now
[57:20] it's Jesus walking down the aisle saying
[57:23] zakus come down from there for today I
[57:27] must abide oh and this evening you might
[57:29] have fought through some mind battles
[57:31] you might have fought through some
[57:32] pressures you might have fought through
[57:34] some pride to be here tonight but now
[57:36] you're in position you're in position
[57:39] Christ is walking the house calling your
[57:42] name calling out your need calling out
[57:44] saying I've got a miracle for you today
[57:47] if you want to see the supernal I'm
[57:49] walking by your way oh if you're willing
[57:52] to fight past the pressure you you can
[57:55] see the Supernatural and what's so
[57:57] incredible to me about this story is he
[58:00] says I must abide in your house the word
[58:03] abide is to take up residence to dwell
[58:06] permanently but Jesus left the house so
[58:09] did Jesus Li to him no he revealed to
[58:13] him what zakus was looking for remember
[58:16] zakus wasn't interested in the body he
[58:19] wanted to see who was on the inside of
[58:21] the body so whenever the body of Jesus
[58:24] left the revelation of Jesus was still
[58:27] there come on now the supernatural was
[58:30] still there because what happens the
[58:32] Bible tells us that zakus started to
[58:35] make all his wrongs right he started to
[58:37] repay the ones that he cheated what
[58:40] happened the supernatural was taking
[58:42] place and abiding in the house of zakus
[58:46] oh man you want to see change in your
[58:49] heart change in your home let the
[58:51] supernatural abide in the home abide in
[58:55] your heart and let us start making
[58:57] changes where you can forgive your
[58:58] neighbor where you can love your sister
[59:00] again where you can look at your parents
[59:02] without bitterness again hey I've been
[59:04] there before it's easy to become bitter
[59:07] it's easy to become offended at somebody
[59:10] but let the Supernatural come and abide
[59:13] in those situations let him come and he
[59:16] can for you can forgive once again like
[59:19] you used to you can love once again like
[59:22] you used to it's the supernatural coming
[59:25] and abiding but first somebody's got a
[59:28] press for it but you see the Bible would
[59:31] tell us in Philippians 3 and14 I press
[59:34] toward the mark for the prize of the
[59:36] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so
[59:40] there got to be some press SC and gone
[59:42] I'm going to move on from that now
[59:44] pressure could either destroy you or
[59:46] Build You Up the Bible would tell us in
[59:48] Matthew 5:10 blessed are they which are
[59:51] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[59:54] theirs is the kingdom blessed are ye
[59:57] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:00:00] you and shall say all manner of evil
[1:00:02] against you falsely for my sake and so
[1:00:05] he's letting you know that you are a
[1:00:08] blessed generation when you're being
[1:00:10] persecuted for righteousness sake he's
[1:00:13] letting you know that the kingdom is
[1:00:15] yours if you can withstand the pressure
[1:00:18] you see one definition of righteousness
[1:00:21] is being right in the eyes of God
[1:00:23] including character and that just stood
[1:00:26] out to me blessed are they which are
[1:00:28] persecuted for righteousness sake or for
[1:00:31] character sake for theirs is the kingdom
[1:00:34] and so whenever God starts to build a
[1:00:36] character in your life the devil's not
[1:00:39] going to just sit there and say yeah
[1:00:41] good job he's going to come back to try
[1:00:43] to Mar that character we can look at
[1:00:45] Joseph Joseph through his whole life was
[1:00:48] character building upon character
[1:00:50] whenever he W whenever he was thrown
[1:00:52] into the well that was some character
[1:00:54] building whenever he was sold as a slave
[1:00:57] that was some character building
[1:00:59] whenever he was in part ofer's house it
[1:01:01] was all building him and training him
[1:01:04] getting him ready for the kingdom but
[1:01:06] then you notice the devil wasn't going
[1:01:08] to give up on on Joseph the Bible says
[1:01:11] Piper's wife come up to Joseph and said
[1:01:14] come lie with me so now he's in a
[1:01:16] position of pressure he's in a position
[1:01:19] of pressure that if he would go and lie
[1:01:21] with parer's wife all of the character
[1:01:24] the God was building through his life
[1:01:27] could be marred hope this is okay this
[1:01:29] evening all of that character the God
[1:01:32] was working on through Joseph's Journey
[1:01:35] was now in a position to be marred oh my
[1:01:39] so that's H so the devil's not just
[1:01:41] going to give up when the when God is
[1:01:43] doing something in your life you got to
[1:01:45] withstand it and so now we see Joseph in
[1:01:48] a decision time he had to to stand
[1:01:50] against the pressure and the Bible says
[1:01:52] he refused her and he ran away but she
[1:01:54] got a hold of his coat and we all know
[1:01:56] what happened because he withstood the
[1:01:59] pressure now he thrown into the dungeon
[1:02:01] and I started to think about that he
[1:02:03] could not have got to the kingdom
[1:02:05] without going first to the dungeon cuz
[1:02:08] we know what happened that the was the
[1:02:10] Baker and the and the wine guy had
[1:02:12] dreams had had dreams and Joseph come
[1:02:14] and gave them the interpretation of the
[1:02:17] dreams if it wasn't for the dungeon how
[1:02:20] could if he got to the Palace come on
[1:02:23] somebody so now is in a point of
[1:02:25] pressure if he would have given in all
[1:02:28] of the character building would have
[1:02:30] been thrown away but now since he was
[1:02:32] stood it now he's in a position where he
[1:02:35] could fulfill the vision cuz you noticed
[1:02:38] before Joseph was ever in the palace
[1:02:41] there was a vision of Joseph him in a
[1:02:43] position of authority we all know the
[1:02:46] story how I think it was it was a wheek
[1:02:48] I believe Joseph was in the middle his
[1:02:50] wheat and his brothers were bowing down
[1:02:52] before him and the Stars the stars were
[1:02:55] bowing before Joseph's star so before
[1:02:58] Joseph was ever in a position of
[1:03:01] authority there was a vision of him in
[1:03:04] that position Oh but before he could
[1:03:07] fulfill that Vision he had to have some
[1:03:10] character oh Hallelujah and there's been
[1:03:13] a vision concerning your life Marching
[1:03:16] In step to Onward Christian Soldiers not
[1:03:19] like the world dancing and being drunk
[1:03:22] there's the vision for your life but you
[1:03:24] got to have some
[1:03:26] character it's not going to come easy
[1:03:29] you've got to press for it you got to
[1:03:31] fight for it you got to withstand the
[1:03:33] pressure oh my so now we see that Joseph
[1:03:37] is now on his way to the kingdom hope
[1:03:39] this is okay tonight he's on his way to
[1:03:41] the kingdom but it was I believe it was
[1:03:43] a year or so later but now Pharaoh has a
[1:03:46] vision and he asked his wise men what is
[1:03:50] I'm disturbed I'm troubled tell me my
[1:03:52] dream tell me the interpretation and
[1:03:54] they wented pharaoh to tell the dream
[1:03:57] and they was going to give the
[1:03:58] interpretation we all know the story and
[1:04:00] he says no you tell me the dream and
[1:04:02] give me the interpretation they could
[1:04:04] not do it and then there comes somebody
[1:04:07] hey Pharaoh I I was supposed to
[1:04:10] mentioned him before but I forgot it was
[1:04:13] right on time it was right on time if he
[1:04:16] would have told of Joseph way back then
[1:04:19] Pharaoh would have forgotten about
[1:04:20] Joseph too but this was the perfect time
[1:04:23] this was the perfect time for the baker
[1:04:26] to come up and say hey I had a dream one
[1:04:28] time too in the dungeon and there was a
[1:04:31] man in there that gave me the
[1:04:33] interpretation of the dream and Pharaoh
[1:04:35] says hey bring him up here if he would
[1:04:38] have given into to the pressure with
[1:04:40] Piper's wife he would have not been in
[1:04:42] the dungeon he would have been
[1:04:44] dead come on now but it took Piper's
[1:04:47] wife to get him in the dungeon hope
[1:04:50] you're following me now it takes the
[1:04:53] character building the pressures that
[1:04:55] put you in a position to fulfill the
[1:04:58] vision that God has for your life oh my
[1:05:02] so now Joseph is now in position we know
[1:05:05] the famine comes the drought comes and
[1:05:08] now the true test of his character is
[1:05:11] put into action
[1:05:12] forgiveness forgiveness what's he going
[1:05:15] to do when the ones that threw him into
[1:05:17] the dungeon on when the ones that solded
[1:05:20] him as a slave when the ones that told
[1:05:23] his father that he was eaten by Wolves
[1:05:26] now he's in a position for vengeance do
[1:05:29] you ever think about that now he's in a
[1:05:30] position he's got to snap his fingers
[1:05:32] hey go go go kill these guys and they
[1:05:34] would have done it he's in a position
[1:05:36] where the tables have now turned now he
[1:05:39] can bring the persecution but because of
[1:05:42] all the character all of the character
[1:05:45] building he's in a position and he
[1:05:47] forgives his brothers now think about
[1:05:51] that could you forgive somebody that
[1:05:53] throws you into a dungeon or throws you
[1:05:55] into a whale could you forgive your
[1:05:57] sister if she sells you as a slave man I
[1:06:00] know my my my my brothers were pretty
[1:06:02] mean to me pretty honoring but they
[1:06:05] never were that bad how I remember Caleb
[1:06:08] telling me I was adopted I wasn't loved
[1:06:10] but I never was sold as a slave that is
[1:06:13] a pretty rough situation but because of
[1:06:16] all of the character building all of the
[1:06:19] character building now he's in a
[1:06:21] position to express the love of Christ
[1:06:24] right now he's expressing the character
[1:06:26] of Christ in a position where human
[1:06:29] character could not have done it if he
[1:06:32] went straight from Daddy's house to the
[1:06:34] kingdom he would have not had that
[1:06:36] character to do that but s of all of the
[1:06:39] suffering all of the struggles all of
[1:06:42] the persecutions all of the heartaches
[1:06:44] that brought forth the character you
[1:06:47] might have been through some sufferings
[1:06:48] you might have been through some
[1:06:50] heartbreaks you might have been through
[1:06:52] some broken hearts but all of that is
[1:06:54] building up character it's Building Up
[1:06:57] character where you can fulfill the
[1:06:59] vision hey I hope it's okay if I tell a
[1:07:02] testimony there was a time where uh my
[1:07:05] heart was broken a million pieces my
[1:07:08] heart was shattered my life was a wreck
[1:07:10] and I was about to commit suicide I was
[1:07:12] I was sitting there at a swimming pool
[1:07:15] and I was about to jump into that pool
[1:07:17] and take my life but then a voice spoke
[1:07:19] to me and I said Lord if you would just
[1:07:22] take this from me if you would lift me
[1:07:24] up then I will serve you if you will
[1:07:27] lift me up I I would give all my days to
[1:07:30] you and because of that broken heart
[1:07:32] because of that Brokenness there was a
[1:07:35] fire that was put on the inside of my
[1:07:37] heart like never before it was
[1:07:40] Brokenness that put me in a position
[1:07:43] where the fire of God can manifest
[1:07:46] itself hey when your life as a teenager
[1:07:48] man I thought I was invincible hey I
[1:07:50] thought I could whoop anybody I could
[1:07:52] beat anybody and armrest and I was
[1:07:54] faster than anybody but there come a
[1:07:56] time where reality hit I I tore my
[1:07:59] rotator cuff I got a concussion and I
[1:08:01] realize hey I'm not big bad Bill oh no
[1:08:05] it takes the pressure it takes the
[1:08:07] suffering where you can't look up or you
[1:08:09] can't look down anymore because you're
[1:08:11] at the bottom of the bottom the only
[1:08:13] place you can look is up so it takes the
[1:08:16] suffering for you to realize hey if you
[1:08:19] how would you know that God could heal
[1:08:21] if you never was sick how would you know
[1:08:23] God could deliver if you never was bound
[1:08:26] how would we know God was a savior if we
[1:08:28] never was lost so it takes the suffering
[1:08:31] for you to realize I need something
[1:08:34] greater I need a savior I need a Healer
[1:08:38] and so don't curse God in the suffering
[1:08:41] but Rejoice that he counted you worthy
[1:08:44] enough to go through the sufferings like
[1:08:46] he went through he he went through
[1:08:48] Brokenness he went through hard times so
[1:08:51] that he would know what it was like for
[1:08:53] you to go go through
[1:08:54] those oh my oh my you see we're living
[1:08:58] in such a day of pressure you see but
[1:09:01] it's through the pressure that the devil
[1:09:03] is trying to Mark character you see when
[1:09:06] does something blow up it is when
[1:09:08] pressure upon pressure upon pressure and
[1:09:11] then all of a sudden it blows up nobody
[1:09:13] loses their temper right away oh I don't
[1:09:15] think you shouldn't at least but it's
[1:09:17] pressure upon pressure if something
[1:09:20] happens at the work and and this happens
[1:09:22] and the Brother brandham Talks he says
[1:09:24] you can step out onto the outside and
[1:09:26] you feel the pressure he says cars are
[1:09:28] flying by at 65 M an hour he says that
[1:09:32] the guy in the car is trying to hurry up
[1:09:34] and get home he hurry ups and he gets
[1:09:36] home but supper ain't ready because he's
[1:09:39] home too early and then the wife says
[1:09:41] something smart and then they get into a
[1:09:44] into an argument he says what is it it's
[1:09:46] pressure right it's pressure building
[1:09:49] upon building and it's building and then
[1:09:50] you explode and that's what the devil is
[1:09:53] trying to do is mar your character
[1:09:56] through pressure oh my but this ain't
[1:09:58] time to give up this ain't time to give
[1:10:01] in hey you know Jesus was in that very
[1:10:04] position you know when did Jesus
[1:10:06] ministry start after the Temptation in
[1:10:09] the wilderness that's right he never
[1:10:11] opened one blinded eye until after the
[1:10:13] Temptation he never raised one dead
[1:10:15] person until after the temptation but
[1:10:18] during the Temptation I'm sure it was
[1:10:20] hard I'm sure he was having mind battles
[1:10:23] just give in I don't know if you've ever
[1:10:25] had these thoughts but I've had these
[1:10:27] thoughts in the time of Temptation and
[1:10:29] pressure the devil will speak to me and
[1:10:31] say just give in and I'll leave you
[1:10:32] alone how many's ever heard that before
[1:10:34] just give in and I'll leave you alone
[1:10:36] I'll let up for a little bit could you
[1:10:38] imagine the thoughts that Jesus was
[1:10:41] having and just look at when when the
[1:10:43] devil says jump from the Pinnacle and
[1:10:45] the angels will catch you could you
[1:10:46] imagine how strong that Temptation was
[1:10:49] because the Bible says that the Angels
[1:10:52] come and minister to Jesus Jesus so the
[1:10:54] Angels was already there they was they
[1:10:57] were there the whole time could you
[1:10:59] imagine the the the temptation just to
[1:11:02] jump so that the devil would leave him
[1:11:04] alone but he withstood the pressure so
[1:11:07] that he could fulfill his
[1:11:09] ministry oh my you got to you got to
[1:11:12] withstand the pressure so that you can
[1:11:14] fulfill your ministry you may say
[1:11:16] brother the Josh I Don't Preach I don't
[1:11:18] sing but you got a minister we heard
[1:11:19] this morning I was sitting there
[1:11:20] listening to Dad preach and I was like
[1:11:22] oh man he's all over what I'm preaching
[1:11:23] preaching tonight but we all got to
[1:11:25] Ministry you don't got to sing you don't
[1:11:28] got to preach you don't got to play
[1:11:29] instruments but you got to Ministry but
[1:11:31] how the pressure how the pressure
[1:11:33] affects you determines your
[1:11:35] ministry you see little brother brandom
[1:11:38] talks about Suzanne Wesley he says she
[1:11:40] wasn't a preacher but she had 17
[1:11:42] children but was still willing to pray
[1:11:44] for three hours a day and he says out of
[1:11:47] that come Charles and John Wesley her
[1:11:50] Ministry produced preachers oh oh my if
[1:11:55] we got some housewives in here your
[1:11:57] ministry your ministry can produce
[1:12:00] powerhouses your ministry can produce
[1:12:02] Hong leaders your ministry can produce
[1:12:05] Housewives and deacons and trustees you
[1:12:08] may say but the Josh I Don't Preach but
[1:12:10] you got a Ministry still you're raising
[1:12:13] the next generation of powerhouses hey
[1:12:16] what brother brandom say that there's
[1:12:18] going to be young men that take this
[1:12:19] message all the way to the coming of the
[1:12:22] Lord it could be your young men it could
[1:12:24] be your toddler sitting right there like
[1:12:27] like brother W said this morning there
[1:12:28] could be more Ray Ericson out here more
[1:12:31] Wayne lawon out here and the parents
[1:12:33] Ministry is is affecting how they're
[1:12:36] being raised hope this is okay tonight
[1:12:38] if your home life what you put before
[1:12:41] your children is affecting their way
[1:12:43] they're being raised but I say if we put
[1:12:45] the message of the hour before our
[1:12:48] children and that start to have
[1:12:50] influence their life and that's all they
[1:12:52] know then watch them become
[1:12:55] powerhouses it's a Ministry you see
[1:12:58] where the brandom talks about the little
[1:13:00] washwoman he says she wanted to do
[1:13:02] something for God we all know the story
[1:13:04] he she wanted to do something for God
[1:13:06] and so she was washing clothes and save
[1:13:08] the ball of her money and we brother
[1:13:10] brandom says she went and got some
[1:13:12] flyers Drew up some flyers and we're
[1:13:14] passing them out we're in the stable and
[1:13:17] on the flyer that there come a young man
[1:13:19] that come up to the to the woman brother
[1:13:21] brandom says he had hair down p his eyes
[1:13:24] his daddy's overalls on and he couldn't
[1:13:26] even read but brandom says he come up to
[1:13:29] her and says ma'am what's that say I
[1:13:31] can't read and she says son right over
[1:13:34] here is a Revival we're having some
[1:13:36] services in this little stable over here
[1:13:39] brother brandom says that night the
[1:13:41] preacher got up and started to preach
[1:13:43] and there wasn't even nobody there
[1:13:45] nobody was even there but he was
[1:13:47] preaching and I think my thank God for
[1:13:50] God called preachers for pastors for
[1:13:52] evangelists that are willing to stand
[1:13:54] against the pressures that are still
[1:13:56] willing to preach because while he was
[1:13:58] preaching brother brand says there come
[1:14:00] that little boy the one that couldn't
[1:14:02] read that had his daddy's overalls on
[1:14:04] haired down past his eyes come and set
[1:14:06] on the back row of the of that little
[1:14:07] stable and brother brandom says that as
[1:14:09] the preacher was preaching that little
[1:14:11] boy come up and gave his heart to Christ
[1:14:14] but the random says you know who that
[1:14:15] boy was the white El Moody that one two
[1:14:18] million SS to God and he says you know
[1:14:21] who was responsible for those two
[1:14:23] million Souls the little old washwoman
[1:14:26] the little old washwoman was responsible
[1:14:29] for those 2 million Souls why she had a
[1:14:32] Ministry it wasn't a great bright
[1:14:34] Ministry but she was willing to fulfill
[1:14:37] the ministry maybe you can sing that's a
[1:14:40] Ministry maybe you can testify that's a
[1:14:43] Ministry but pressure and complexes
[1:14:46] insecurities try to push down your
[1:14:49] ministry hey we heard this morning
[1:14:51] brother brandom says who is the first
[1:14:53] Divine healer David through his music so
[1:14:56] if you can play music that's a Ministry
[1:14:59] oh come on now oh how did God defeat the
[1:15:02] armies with Jehoshaphat remember the
[1:15:04] armies were coming against Jehoshaphat
[1:15:07] and the Lord come to Jehoshaphat and
[1:15:09] said the battle's not yours it's mine
[1:15:11] and you know what he told him to do you
[1:15:13] than the Lord would have told
[1:15:15] Jehoshaphat go get some Spears go get
[1:15:17] some armor go get some footmen but what
[1:15:20] he told him to do is go get some singers
[1:15:23] yeah go get some singers and as those
