tonight if you have your Bibles man we're going to go into the Book of Daniel the 4th chapter amen we're going to have brother Nathan come if you would he's going to help us read some things here um in Daniel chapter 4 I amen I hope you hadn't forgot we've been looking in the Book of Daniel Amen got some things here so he's just going to read for us tonight Daniel chapter 4 we'll read the first eight verses and then skip over to verse 19 Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people Nations and languages that dwell in all the Earth peace be multiplied unto you I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me how great are his signs and how Mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and his Dominion is from generation to generation I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house and flourishing in my Palace and I saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream then came The Magicians the astrologers the Chaldeans and the soothsayers and and I told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof but at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was belto shazar according to the name of my God and in whom is the spirit of the Holy gods and before him I told the dream and then he summarizes the dream for Daniel and then we pick it up in verse 19 then Daniel whose name was belthazar was astonished for one hour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said Bel shazar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee belto shazar answered and said my Lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the Heaven and the sight thereof to all the Earth whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heavens had their habitation it is that thou O King that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy Dominion to the end of the Earth and whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven and saying heue the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and Brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the de of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over him this is the interpretation O King and this is the decree of the most high which has come upon my Lord the king that they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to meet to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the Dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule wherefore oh King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by showing Mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility and all this came upon the King Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months he walked in the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon and the King spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my Majesty while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and he giveth it to whomsoever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from Men did heat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven till his hairs were grown like Eagle's feathers and his nails like Bird's Claws and at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and I bless the most high and I praise and honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my Kingdom Mine honor and brightness return unto me and my counselors and my lords sought unto me and I was established in my kingdom and excellent Majesty was added unto me now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the kingdom the king of Heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you a little bit tonight from this section of scripture Daniel 4 uh I think that is the first time uh that I've ever took it as a subject of course of of looking at it so I've uh been taking a little extra time and the study of it and I found some what I believe to be some tremendous things but I think there's an object in a real serious lesson to be learned in this portion of scripture and of course we are not Kings uh and it it as far as a natural king and the kingdoms that's not going to apply to us but I do think that it has some great application unto the Church of the Living God to learn some things uh from what this king lived through amen and uh as we're of course reading here we're looking at a time period when Nebuchadnezzar has been given actually been given the rule of the entire Earth now his the the might of Nebuchadnezzar is so powerful that he actually has a sovereign rule of the world there's nobody been able to uh overcome him or nobody's been able to do anything to withstand him but the reason that he has what he has is because God has actually given this Dominion to him uh he actually is the fellow Nebuchadnezzar this king is the one who has overcome Israel he has crushed down the Temple of Israel he's carried away the children of Israel and as far as he's concerned there's nobody who has any authority over him and the longer that he rules the more he becomes sure that he's the man and he has everything in control amen but now here is the reason that he is a ruler in Jeremiah 27 veres 5 to8 amen it says I have made the earth and the man the Beast and thereup the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me and now I have given all the lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and the Beast of the field have I given him to serve him and all nations Shall Serve him and his son and his son's son until the very time of this land come and many nations and great Kings Shall Serve themselves of him and it shall come to pass in the nation and the kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and that will not put their neck under the Yoke of the king of Babylon that Nation will I punish sayth the Lord with a sword and with a famine and with pestilence until I have consumed them by his hand now so so the reason that he had this ultimate power and authority upon the Earth was simply because God was using him he was a tool in the hand of God God had raised him up now if you're a of course a studier of scripture God has raised him up to deal with Israel because of their arrogance and their belief that they could worship anybody or do anything because of who they were but God was teaching Israel something that you cannot serve other gods and remain in the place that you are so he's raised up Nebuchadnezzar he's brought them underneath the place that they're living and now Nebuchadnezzar is becoming lifted up within himself and his rule he's impressing himself and and the more the higher he gets the more Authority he has the more rule he has uh the more self-centered he's becoming the more prideful he's becoming maybe could I say this his character is not keeping up with his position other words he's growing in position he's growing in power but he's not growing in character now this is something that I believe that every Christian must take great heed to is to remember that with position and with authority your character must grow with that because if you ever outgrow your character amen you become a trouble for yourself you become trouble for everyone around you you know uh that that's the problem with with sports actually there's uh we have people who can carry a football and they're so talented at it but they're usually end up in prison maybe for rape or some kind of dope charges or something because they're talented they're gifted but they have no character to go with the gift so that there's nothing there now you know uh uh maybe maybe there this could go a lot deeper but I think you're getting the point that the character must accompany the position and here this man is a king and he's setting in a rule and Authority but he's getting a hard heart he's getting a hotty life and and and and and now what we must always remember is some things that a prophet will have to say now let's just just hear Brother badam a moment in a message hear ye him he says humility the way down is always the way up he says that we will humble himself he said God will exalt him and he that exalteth himself he shall be abased now the way down is the way up for a Believer if he'll humble himself before God now I'll go to he cares do you care now if you're if you're if you're interested in the way these sermons lay I thought this was amazing when I'm studying this uh Book of Daniel the 4th chapter I I get a message on my heart entitled a warning before judgment and so I I'm the guy that if I'm going to listen to One him before judgment I want to know what he preached three sermons before he got there is there something he's building up to and of course there was if you go listen you'll listen to a sermon called why Christ speak and the very next sermon brother Brown will preach a message called humble thyself he just talks about having the power of the spoken word and the very next sermon is humble thyself amen and the very next sermon is he says he cares do you care and then he preaches a warning then a judgment and the next sermon of course is Christ The Mystery of God revealed but in this he cares to you care it's very powerful because brother Ram will say you've got to be clothed with humility before God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble he he says therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt thee in due time casting your care upon him for he carth for you so he's tying together humble thyself with a message he cares do you care amen and and in saying that he's reading the book of Peter as a text amen that we should humble ourselves before God that he may exalt Us in due time and if you care he cares he cares for you is that right then see then brother ra must teach us he cares now after after God knows that judgment is coming on the earth he still does something because he cares for the people amen now the the the difference between people who can receive the care of God and them that don't receive the care of God is the difference in the spirit to be able to receive the message or the word amen and in many cases the correction of the word it'll take character now the scripture Will Tell Us in the book of Isaiah 57 in the 15th verse that God says thus saith the high and the lofty one that inhabiteth the eternities whose name is Holy he said I dwell in a high and holy place with them also that is of a contrite and a humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of a contrite one in Pro ver 16 and 19 amen he said better is it to be a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud in Proverbs 22 and4 by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life in 29 and 23 he said a man's Pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit in Matthew 18 Jesus said whosoever shall humble himself as a little child the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven in James he said humble thyselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift thee up amen I think it's amazing that the Bible said that in book of Peter we should humble ourselves ye younger submit yourselves to the Elder amen and all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and give give Grace unto the humble I tell you that's a powerful thing Amen to know that God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble humble yourselves therefore amen now I I I I think this is very powerful right here and what Apostle Peter is saying I believe is exactly applicable to this scripture that if we would humble ourselves then God doesn't have to Humble us but when we re when we absolutely refuse to Humble ourselves then God always has a way of bringing humility to an individual that he's planning on using amen see see the scriptures are clear that Nebuchadnezzar was in the hands of the Lord and God was not going to forget him and God was not done with him but he was done with him as far as he could use him until he was ready to Humble himself now I I'm just reading this and I can can I can I say a little something to you before I continue preaching amen I know this is the first time I've spoke in a little while and and to come back I actually argue with the Lord about preaching this kind of sermon I said Lord I a spoke to the church a little while I hate to come preach in this kind of sermon so I I want you all to know I I'm not trying to say this applies to anyone here at the church or the church this is part of the series I think it's good for every Christian but let me just put it out real straight okay amen I I personally believe this is one of the most humble churches in the message of the hour I I believe you humble to the word quicker than any congregation I know of and I I just want to be uh just put Flyers where Flyers are do brother Ericson's the most humble Pastor I think I've ever been around I I just have to put it right there we we love Brother Ray and his spirit is it's unbelievable anywhere I go in the world and I say I'm at brother Ericson's I I'm associate with him there they're like oh brother Ericson his he's got the best spirit so so we're we we want that to be real clear as we continue and now I want want you to see that now that that the prophet is going to teach us amen that humility must be we must humble ourselves or God will humble us amen so because see the point being is God is going to use you and God has chosen you and you're a tool in the hand of God but God can only use you as long as your spirit will allow you to be used of the Lord now in Greater witness brother bam says like this you've got to become nothing in your own sight and you be and then you become something in God's side amen now doors and door to the heart he says now watch when a real big man makes him s small that shows the god of Heaven see Jesus even himself became a foot waser to mankind see the way up he that humbles himself has got to be exalted amen now the prophet will say now see the difference somebody wants their name something big but God's people wants to shun that kind of stuff they don't want big great big things they don't want big something they want to be humble with humility the Way Up Is Down he humbles himself shall be exalted he exalts himself shall be abased now don't try to be a big something see try to be a little something but you be what you are now look at what the prophet said but you be what you are now this King in the scripture had to be a king CU God made him a king so he couldn't just go be somebody else but humility was not not being the king humility was a recognizing I'm a king because God made me a king do you see this some times people get it in their mind that you can't do great things or you can't uh preach great places or you can't sing great songs or you can't be a great church to be humble but that's not it at all you got to be who God made you to be and let me promise you this if you humble yourself God will do great things with you he'll do great things with the church amen look look at the grace that he's given here in True Word Tabernacle but we've got to remember where that Grace comes from and that's why we glorify God every time God does something wonderful we put all the praise on Jesus and we put all the glory on God Amen because God is able to now I know God uses men so we might as well we might as well get aside that I somebody was complimenting me the other day in the back back there and I don't know sometimes I don't know I don't know how to accept compliments and I I know brother Ericson shares the same problem if you start bragging on me I'm like oh my goodness let's change the subject could you it makes you feel odd because you know when I was a young preacher somebody come up and say to me and say well brother Wayne man that was a powerful message well see now that you're you don't realize I'm the only one that knows what's what's being put in my mind when I don't know what I'm thinking or something just comes out of nowhere and and and you know so so sometimes you don't realize how much God it really is amen and somebody say to you well thank you for that sermon you know it was a powerful sermon when I was a young guy I I I I I I'd take time and say well it wasn't me I I tell you I just it wasn't me it just came to me and it was you know and I try to explain it and I see the look on their face you know so after a while I just started saying thank you thank you you know it is really not something that you could explain because God is actually using a man he's using a vessel I had to take time and read the scripture amen but I can't put scripture together I can't put the inspiration in that takes God to do that amen so we we can't just say well I'm not going to do what God called me to do because somebody wants me to humble myself but humility is realizing there is a calling there is a gift there is something God has made us to do but it's God that gives the grace to be able to do what we're doing it's nothing good thing that we have done that we could go back and brag or act like we've done something great it's what God is doing now in Jesus Christ in the same brother bam says now we approach the word tonight I want you to bear in mind remember God doesn't have any any stuffed shirts and when you get to that place that you're willing to be nothing then God can make something out of you and so as what we see Jesus he said he come to show what God was and anything that's high and hotty isn't God woo amen that's a prophet anything high and hotty that's not God he said God is low and humble and he said that's what makes him God something that comes low that can go high my goodness amen that's powerful isn't it amen you got to always stay humble if you'll be little in your own sight no matter what God does for you you can see how much humbler you can be more God blesses you just keep getting more humble all the time and he continues to bless you but when you get to a place that you think I've got this and I haven't I and and you haven't got it but you're on your road out right there see you'll lose your influence you'll lose your strength of your testimony he said when women begin to act like the rest of the women there's something wrong you see what he goes immediately see the reason you have what you have is cuz you're humbling to the word you're wearing those dresses you're letting your hair grow you're doing exactly what a prophet said so God's doing something abundant for you but if you ever get to the place well I can just do what I want and I can live what I want act like what I want then then that's when God backs up and says all right well have at it then amen but you recognize we need the grace of God we need the power of God in our lives we need the sanction of the Holy Ghost upon our meetings Upon Our Lives there's never a sermon amen the longer we preach the more we understand without God sanctions the word amen we can do more damage in one meeting than God can fix in 10 meetings but if God comes in on the word he'll fix problems and he'll fix this and he'll heal this and he'll do that amen and you never have to ask when I get involved because it always comes out in a problem amen do you see God is in Simplicity the Way Up Is Down humble yourself don't never say well I got this he says you ain't got nothing just remember if you got the grace of God just be thankful for it and be humble and keep humbling yourself you see it's not you you got to get yourself out of the picture another quote you got to stay with the promise but you've got to get simple enough to get out of your own way problem with us we can't get simple enough the problem with we can't get simple enough that God you see the secret of the power of God is to get out of the way and let the Holy Ghost do something wonderful in our life God is great and he says and he that humbles himself and hides himself he said Jesus thank God Amen that he could do this I thank thee that thou has hid thyself from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes see the way to know God is to get simple to get weigh down and that's the reason See's setting right here tonight your humility has brought you under the message of the hour because you possess the the humility to humble yourself to a prophet to humble yourself to the word of God and that that word itself can become the exaltation of your life amen now listen after after brother Adam will say this and humble thyself he'll say this after all these years on the field and around the world seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and and if you want to get somewhere with God don't you ever let an arrogant Spirit get around you if you want to get somewhere with God don't you ever let an arrogant Spirit get around you y'all know what arrogance is that's like you can do something yourself or you got a little something and you're a little better and someone else it's an arrogance I I I just have to be honest one of the most putrifying thing I've ever saw as a preacher that's arrogant amen is exactly opposite of what a preacher ought to be the preacher ought to know above everybody in the building that I am nothing I come from nowhere I can do nothing I can act no way I can do nothing at all to help anybody I am totally surrendered asking the god of Grace to come in the meeting and to touch a heart and if somebody gets help it was only God that did it I have nothing to offer I have nothing I can brag of but if Jesus Christ the son of God can get me out of the way just long enough he'll minister to a hard and Light lives will be changed and hearts will be touched amen what good would we be to have an arrogance about us arrogance is the very thing that runs the power of God away from a Ministry or a life amen I've seen some pretty good preachers but they're so proud of themselves that you can't hardly stand and listen to and preach the spirit is just arrogant it's just nasty it's putrifying it's an arrogant Spirit you said brother Wayne why would you say that because they actually might be called of God but if they're not willing to Humble themselves God's going to Humble them brother Bram said it's see you got to be conscious you got to be conscious of how little you are you got to be conscious of that you've got to know that you are little brother B said take a glass of water stick your finger in it and pull it out and that's how much your opinion means that's how much it means you see the littleness that we are amen we are little amen and we are alive and he is in humility and as long as we stay humble we are going to dwell with the most high God if we can bow our hearts then God can allow us to see what this scripture is dealing with is humility this scripture is dealing with a king can be took from the lofty position of a throne and be made an animal in the woods because of the wrong kind of spirit you can take the wrong kind of spirit and it will take you from a throne to a four for to a creature on his for all fourest out in the wilderness can you can you imagine amen one day sitting at a king's table commanding armies and thousands and the next day amen they nobody will listen to you there's nobody uh uh coming to you they didn't even clip the poor man's fingernails they didn't cut his hair he was a total lunatic in the space amen of one word that he spoke when he began to say look at this Mighty Babylon that I have created look at this thing that I've done look at what I have said amen it was a hoty heart it was a arrogance that came to him that brought him to a place amen that he was exalted in Pride and there is a law in the Bible if you come up in Pride you will be abased if he would have went up like he come down then he would have come down like he went up amen do you see now I I wantan to I want to I want to say this I do not believe that this scripture is without purpose I do not believe that God would allow a king to spend seven years on his hands and knees without a purpose I I believe that God had a full intent in this scripture to teach us as individuals lessons that we who have been made Kings amen must remember that character must move with our position amen now notice this in Daniel chapter 4 when Daniel is talking to the king amen the Bible the Bible says in the vision that there was a watcher an angel come down from heaven and this Watcher in the 17th verse tells us he said this is the matter of the decree of the Watchers and the demand of the word of the Holy ones to this intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and give it to this purpose this story has a purpose that we would understand the sovereignty of God this entire chapter was written for the purpose that we would understand that anything that we have God has given it to us that God is Sovereign amen almighty God is Sovereign and he will give to whom whatsoever he desires to give because he is God I think that to today that Nebuchadnezzar should have just remembered that God was God now in this in this interpretation uh of this of this Vision brother mam is clear in the message of there is warning before judgment brother Braham is teaching us amen that God has a nature that he never brings judgment before he brings a warning now the warning that Nebuchadnezzar is receiving is a Vindicated warning it's not a it's not something well maybe something might take place he's literally placing this in Vindication he shows him the dream then Daniel sees a vision just like in Daniel chapter 2 and then Daniel comes and tells the interpretation of it and in the interpretation this is a Vindicated Prophet to Daniel tell or Daniel telling King Nebuchadnezzar what is fing to take place he's not guessing about what's fing to take place he's talking to the king he's saying you are fising to go out here and become a beast in the field amen now look at this because of a Vindicated Prophet giving him a warning this is a warning before judgment now judgment not it's not that it might be coming it's not that what if this happens but he the king should be absolutely sure that Daniel is telling him the truth and when Daniel tells him the truth he tells him he's going you're going to be driven now the seven periods of time that he's going to be out on this all fours a prophet said is seven years he said that now think about this seven years as an animal because of a hearty a hotty heart it was seven years as an animal because of a hotti heart that was all that was wrong with the King he had a hotty heart he commanded amen the god commanded the stump to remain with a band of iron showing that what has been cut down will be restored so God was not intending to destroy Nebuchadnezzar he was intending to Humble Nebuchadnezzar it it amazing that Daniel and his people are in the Kingdom of Babylon for the very same sin of arrogance because their forefathers and kings were worshiping other gods because they thought that God would not bring judgment for this kind of activity amen and there they are in that land and God has made them King and Nebuchadnezzar becomes to a place that he believes that he is above the god of Heaven Daniel's God is just another God but God is intending for this man to know without a shadow of a doubt Nebuchadnezzar is going to know that there is a God in heaven that that God rules and that God gives to whomsoever he desires the sovereignty of God is about to become a revelation Amen to Nebuchadnezzar it's going to take seven years and it's going to take seven years as a beast it didn't have to take seven years y'all know that right it didn't have to take seven years do you know that just before amen Nebuchadnezzar falls into this God uses Daniel to say something to him and the Bible says in the 27th verse amen Daniel talk to the king and he says to him wherefore oh King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by showing Mercy unto the poor if it be a lengthening of thy Tranquility look at this here is a Vindicated Prophet advising this man saying to him look don't go seven years on all fours just humble yourself a and do good amen break this thing break the sin off of you I I think that this is a powerful thing having read what a prophet said to us about our Spirits humble yourself make yourself small take away the hotess put yourself under your brethren humble yourself to the mighty hand of God you see the advice that a prophet is giving was the same advice that was being given into the scripture if you would only humble yourself and change your ways then God would reverse what is being spoken by a Vindicated prophet my Lord think about that a minute God was given to him now the reason that he didn't accept it is written in D Daniel 5 and verse 19 he says it like this in the 20th verse he says when his heart was lifted up his mind is hardened in Pride and he was disposed from his kingly throne and they took the glory from him so his his heart was lifted up and his mind was hardened in Pride so he was already so prideful that a Vindicated Prophet couldn't speak to him a Vindicated prophet couldn't say save yourself seven years of trouble and just do good break this curse off of your life break it off right now and he wouldn't be able to do it now the reason he couldn't is because he was a great man the reason he couldn't is because he was a great man with a hotty attitude amen now look God gave him a different spirit and showed him that I can exalt and I can abase amen now watch what this what what this King done he took the wrong kind of spirit now you you you're hearing a theme through this entire service tonight is the spirit was wrong now look what it was he was a chosen vessel God had ordained him and gave him everything he had but the spirit was wrong tell me tell me it don't matter what kind of spirit you have I'll show you in the Bible it does matter what kind of spirit you have his Spirit was wrong see he he exalted himself now you say what's so wrong with a man exalting himself but the scripture says in Isaiah chapter 14 that this was the fall of Lucifer himself in the beginning Lucifer was a song leader in heaven he was a worship leader he had the highest position in heaven next to amen next to God Almighty was an arch be a light barrier called Lucifer when you went up into heaven he was the right hand of God are you hearing me he was the right hand up there he was in power he had everything coequal to God except for the spoken word he could not and because of that he could not receive worship but he could not handle amen just being in power without receiving worship he had to have somebody to worship him he couldn't handle all them good things that's being said about God he couldn't handle all those good things are you hearing me yet amen that same little Little Spirit can work right in ministries I've seen it work right in churches among songs and and singers and leaders where they get a little spirit that if you if you really brag on one guy well my goodness the spirit gets all tore up and amen but you know what if we loved one another the way we're supposed to love one another when somebody brags on somebody we would get right on the ball and we' brag on them a little too because let me let me just say something to you if our team is winning I don't care who's in the ball it doesn't matter to me who's up here preaching if they're preaching the message of the hour we ought to be shouting amen we ought to be rejoicing the word of God there shouldn't be that place where if it's not coming from a certain guy or if it's you you see what I'm saying there has to be the spirit of the word amen now now the scriptures I know I know these things can get a little touchy but they're touchy whether we talk about them or not so might as well just talk about them right they're already a little touchy so why not just poke them and tell them it's a devil it's not an odd feeling it's a devil you're not just having a little odd feeling it's the same spirit that was on Lucifer in the beginning that was jealous that God was getting something and he wasn't getting it amen now now the scripture said that Lucifer was the son of the morning and was cut down to the ground and did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will send them to Heaven I will exalt my throne above the Throne of God and I will set upon the Mount of the congregation side of the north and I will send above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high he's using the word the most high look what Daniel was telling him you got to know he's the most high the word most high is Elon that comes from when Abraham met God remember and God blessed him mdct and he said be blessed of the most high God it's a it's a Hebrew title for God which means the most high God and they called him Elon so our God is Not Just another God of gods he is Elon he's the high God he's the most high God there is no other God besides our God he's not one God among many gods he's not sharing his throne or his authority or his power he is God and he's God alone and he's God over everything and everywhere and everybody and everything was made for our God even the devil was made for God Amen that devil is working out exactly the way God is designed him to work out we needed an adversary and bless that Devil he's a real adversary but I hate that thing and amen and it's a spirit and it don't have no place in the Church of the Living God it's a spirit of jealousy and a spirit of Envy I threaten one time to preach a sermon on brotherly kindness that's uh uh that's a that's sacrificed on the altars of jealousy jealousy will cause you to treat people a way you wouldn't even treat a sinner you wouldn't even treat a sinner the way people sometimes gets treated in the house of God and it ain't nothing but dirty old filthy jealousy amen and it's cruler than the grave and it don't become a son or daughter of God to carry that kind of spirit we ought to love one another we ought to serve one another we ought to help one another we ought to lay down on the ground and let somebody walk over us if it needs to be well glory to God it's Thursday night we ought to be shouting right Mercy I will a sin see it was an exaltation self-exaltation listen if you're not interested in exalting yourself you're interested in accepting what you get it's only when you decide that you're going to do something and everybody else don't agree that's when the trouble comes when Trouble Comes is when one individual decides that I'm going to do this and everybody don't get behind them then then it becomes a self-exaltation it's not it's not God doing it so then it becomes an issue it becomes trouble but if every person holds their position and every person gets in their place now I got a right to say these things I am in a position in this assembly and it's right under that man sitting right there directly under 100 100% under 100% agreement with his decisions with the way he goes I don't have to humble myself to that I could have did something different but I chose to humble myself instead to argue with so if he makes a decision I took my opinion aside and I get under his decision because that is the order that's the way Unity comes it's the way the power of God moves my goodness now you can see why the spirit on Nebuchadnezzar was so wrong because it was the spirit that had been on Lucifer in the beginning that he caused him to exalt himself above the stars of Heaven now let me oh God is this okay now this is the way this goes okay so Brother Ray makes a call or he corrects a situation and you call somebody and you're talking to him and they said well he handled that wrong what he did that individual just exalted Ed himself above the advice of your Godly Pastor he exalted himself now what spirit's doing that because they want you to look at them like they're somebody amen but let me tell you if you sit under them as a pastor a little while you think brother Ray ericsen is an angel see I'm getting older I'm getting older I should be wiser shouldn't I but I've been around a little while I've been around I've been around long enough to know that you can sit and watch a television screen and agree with a preacher but if you sit in his church you wouldn't feel the same way long as they're somewhere off somewhere do you see but when it but when they stand in the pull pit and they look at your house and correct you and your family and then all a sudden it ain't is fun I don't know where that's coming from Lord forgive me brother Ray forgive me Mercy help somebody B play something see that's what denomination has tried to do now what I've showed you as a spirit look at denomination what they're doing with a message yeah they're saying brother Bram was wrong on that do you see what they're doing they're exalting their opinion above a Vindicated prophet of God now I can show it to you in scripture if you like the Scripture it says in second Thessalon chapter 2 let no man deceive you by any means the day shall not come except there come a falling away and the man of sin will reveal the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that as God Seth in the temple God showing himself that he is God who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God how many knows what that scripture means brother Bram broke it down for us and I'm not going to take a long time to read it but brother BR broke it down for us who exalteth himself above all that's called God he said what is called God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so brother B said what is called God is the Vindicated word in your age which is the message of the hour so that message is here and when a denomination says brother Brandon was wrong on that or when they said do you see what they're doing they're exalting their opinion about how you should live how you should dress how you should teach and they're doing it above all that is called God it's a denominational spirit it's a denominational attitude and it was back there on that King in the beginning and God was saying I can't use you with that kind of spirit on you because you believe that you're greater than I am see denominations believe they're greater than God they're looking for Revival believe they're worshiping God but at the same time they're actually crucifying the word of God now when when God warns Nebuchadnezzar food Daniel he gives him the opport opportunity of repentance and rather than repent he gets hoty he gets pridey who are you to correct me see that's the attitude now let me let me just ask you has there been similar warnings and similar spirits to correction in the Bible before this time there is Kings in Israel who have been lifted up in Pride now I think one king if you if you go back in in in in second chronicles 25 I'll give you a little homework there's a fell whose name is AAS ma ma m a a z i a a 2 Chronicles 25 And1 he was a king who strengthened himself and led his people now the scripture I'll give you the I'll give you the condensed version the scripture teaches what happens with this king is he's actually a king and he's put in position he's a king of Judah but Judah has already been divided in Judah and Israel and he's a king and Judah and he's got to fight a battle so he hires himself a bunch of missionaries from Israel and when he hires these missionaries the man of God comes to him and said God's not going to support this when you go in the battle with these with these with these people that you've hired mercenaries not missionaries these mercenaries you've hired he said when you go out into the battle God is not going to help you in this battle and God is able to help or God's able to oppose he said well what do I do with them he said I've already paid him 100 talents he said God is able to give you much more than 100 talents let them go back where they come from and go fight the battle with God so he goes and he fires this bunch of mercenaries amen and he goes on by himself with his little army and he just Stomps this enemy he kills and destroys and takes captive he has a mighty success well while he's being successful in the battle The Mercenaries are going back through Judah and they actually pillage a few cities and and they show out a little because of their anger at the king amen and this King now is built up in himself I whip the enemy so he turns and thinks that he can whip Israel now think about this he's the king of Judah he's of their own blood and he's angry and he sends a letter down to the king of Israel and says to him I think you and I need to meet face to face what an attitude amen you and I need to meet face to face I'm a little angry about what you did and we need to meet face to face he's already puffed up in his heart you see he's he's he he he beat this guy he can beat anybody he can do anything now cuz he did this he can he can just take any battle he can do anything you see the kind of spirit he's presenting well when the king of Israel gots the letter he sends him back a little a little funny letter kind of and he said there was a there was a a a cedar down in the land of Leb Lebanon and there was a thistle sent word to him and then a beast run over the thistle so he was telling him king of Judah you are a Thistle and I am a cedar in Lebanon you are too little to take on the battle you're about to take on and sure enough the fellow was so lifted up in his heart he went on and done it anyhow he just come and attacked and when he did amen the people were killed and they were run back into Judah and the story simply goes that the people whom that king led turned on him and killed him because of the attitude he had got their people killed they turned on their own King and destroyed him now y'all want to know who that was that was uzziah's father and the Bible tells us that Uzziah then becomes king he destroyed the people that K his his father amen and he become king and ruled as a good King he was an impressive man he wasn't politic he' done great for years but at the end of his Reign he was such a successful King he had such a powerful Reign that he believed amen I'm successful I'm blessed I'm going to be a minister now I'm going to go in the house of God and I'm going to burn incense and I'm gonna he thought because he was successful in one position he would be successful whatever he done wherever he went he'd become a hotti man that was the very sin of his own father and when the sin come upon him he goes in the house of the Lord and begins to burn the incense and while he's burning the incense 80 preachers come in there four score of them come in and they say to him you can't do this you're a king you're not a levite you can't do this in the house of God you got to get out and the scripture tells us he man with 80 preachers telling that King he should have humbled himself right there said you know right boys you know what I I got I got a little lifted up you're right never never mind I I I I'll just I I I see I did wrong here I'll just get out of here but you know what that wasn't what he did because he didn't have the right Spirit he was a king but he didn't have the right Spirit and the spirit on him Was the Same Spirit that had lifted itself up in the beginning and the moment he was corrected he became angry at the correction you've got to watch that church Amen in this generation we're living again nobody wants corrected nobody wants to receive correction a pastor can give a little correction people just fly off a handle they they get all tore up in their spirits but the Bible said that this is the house of judgment that correction begins at the house of God if we can't be corrected by the word where can we receive correction where can God correct us if he can't correct us from the pull pit but we might as well go ahead and say it but we got a bunch of mansy pansy preachers now that they're wearing coats instead of preachers coats and they bended to the will of the people so if somebody actually hears a sermon with a little teeth in it they think they're being mistreated they're not being mistreated but the Bible said if we can't receive correction we are bastard born and we don't even belong to God can think about it what would you think about a father or mother never correct its own child you can't tell me you don't love a that you love a c a child and you won't correct it you can't tell me that I'm sorry how how in the world could you love a child and not correct it because if you really correct it you don't want to see it grow up and become a a juvenile and out in prisons and and and and the amen uh we we've got a brother Tyler's here is is one of our one of our police officers bless their heart they can't even hardly do their job now because parents ain't done their jobs at home so they meet a 18yearold out on the street that's entitled they don't have it they don't have to listen to nobody they don't have to do nothing and they have to put them in a police car and the whole public turns on them because they're having to do at 18y Old what some mom or daddy should have done at threey old and should have picked up a switch and whipped that child till it listened like it ought to you said preacher you lost your mind no I think it's time Amen to stop the the nonsense in the house of God and pull back the word of God and let it lay where it lays C black black and white white I'm tired of the gray brush over every situation over every life listen to me there is a right and there is a wrong and I don't care who you are from me to the back door to the back pew to the well maybe I should wait a little while longer before I preach some more said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about genuine love I'm talking about genuine love when you love somebody enough to be honest and truthful and not want to see their soul in hell not want to see their life destroyed or their marriages or their church or that Spirit of hotess will not receive correction which is exactly what king Uzziah he was a king but he had the wrong spirit and that Spirit caused a leprosy because he wouldn't be able to be corrected he got a big head that's what happened and his head got big now listen the king got to the place that he thought within himself see pride got him people don't think Pride's a big thing but Pride was what brought the fall of multiple kings in the Bible Pride amen what got them was Pride now if there was those who could not be corrected if those were had the wrong Spirit then surely in this Bible somewhere there was somebody that represented a bride who did receive correction that does receive the word of the Lord and changes things do you see what happens in Daniel 34 Daniel 4:34 the Bible tells us that because he wouldn't receive correction he fell seven years as a beast but there was something that finally ended his seven years of trouble his seven years was ended and and and have y have y'all ever noticed this it's the first time I really paid attention to this this is the only place in the Bible I know that a pagan King has written scripture in the Bible these are the words of a pagan King in our Bible he said I Nebuchadnezzar remember that's powerful Nebuchadnezzar lifted up his eyes unto heaven and he said my understanding return to me and I bless the most high here is a man blessing the god whom he has destroyed the people who worshiped that God he should not have ever worshiped Daniel's God or Israel's God because he would have believed believe that their God wasn't able to deliver but he come through enough to know that Israel God is God he come through enough to understand the God Amen is God this man's God is God and and when he saw that he lifted up his eyes I thought it was powerful I believe today that if we could lift up our eyes it would break a lot of problems I believe if we would lift up our eyes from the troubles in our lives and the situations that's going around us sometimes those problems are in your life to hum you sometimes you're facing situations in your homes and in your marriages because you wouldn't receive correction to begin with and you've been living with that thing for years but you could break the thing tonight if you would only lift up your eyes and say God I've had enough of this thing I've had enough of this situation and we've been around and around and you know I'm preaching tonight you know you know you know I'm telling you the truth some of us has been dealing with things in our homes for years when the word corrected it but we wasn't ready to receive correction so we've been dealing with it and dealing with it but there is a way to end the thing there's a way to change the situation and it is to lift up your eyes and say God you're God and there is no there is no waken it without you you see what is happening amen you see what is taking place now in the message of warning then judgment brother Bron will actually read from Isaiah chapter 38 this is his text in Isaiah chapter 38 and he reads the story of a man named Hezekiah when Isaiah goes to Hezekiah y'all remember who Hezekiah was Heen he was a man who had a bull brother B said he wasn't dying from Bulls he must have had cancer he said the man had cancer Hezekiah never knew that but he said Hezekiah had cancer he said and God was going to Hezekiah amen through Isaiah a Vindicated prophet and remember remember when Isaiah walks in the room and Hezekiah knows a prophets talking to him now his words cannot fall he knows that this man when he speaks it is exactly what he says is the truth and he says to the man prepare yourself because God's going to take you from the earth you're going to die a Vindicated Prophet has just announced you're going to die brother when a prophet says you're going to die you might as well prepare your life you're going to die this man so believed the prophet that he dropped down and turned his face to the wall he didn't get angry he didn't get upset he took it as a warning rather than a rebuke he took it as a warning rather than being angry at a rebuke he received it as a warning and Grew From it look what he done he turned his face to the wall and Isaiah left the room and the Bible records before Isaiah could get out of the temple he was out on the steps I think it was as he was passing and the spirit of the Lord spoke to him and said turn around and go back in there and tell Hezekiah that his prayer has reached under heaven and that he shall not die but thus saith the Lord I give him 15 more years myy Lord 15 more years given to him he can you think about that amen a prophet thus sayith the Lord you're going to die amen the Bible records that Hezekiah honestly didn't want to believe him because he'd already prophesied his death but he said I'll give a sign unto you he said Here's your sign I want you to go out on the temple steps and out on the steps there's a su dial out there that's of course that's how people used to tell time we still do it if you don't have a clock in the fields you got a compass you can set it down stick a stick up the shadow as it falls over the compass will tell you what time of the day it is amen do you see they had a Sund dial that told them the time of the day and the Bible says that I have turned back the dial on the Sund dial 10 degrees now it was enough Seth that most people wouldn't have recognized it it was enough that most people wouldn't even understood it ever happened but because a prophet was announcing it it was a visible thing a minute thing but it was visible and when they went and checked it sure enough the sundow had backed up exactly 10 degrees now I I I uh I Enlisted the help of a of one of our one of our Geniuses here brother Richard called text him last night brother Richard grills and he done a little math degree for me amen he said brother Wayne he said now if it's a sundow as all other sunds he said that's exactly 40 minutes I thought oh dear God exactly 40 minutes the number of judgment is 40 God backed up the hand of time exactly 40 minutes he took the Judgment off of it because he heard the warning of a Vindicated Prophet amen what do you think we're talking about tonight church if we receive a spirit that can receive a Vindicated message we have passed from Death unto life and we shall not come into condemnation judgment has been passed over the church by the words of a Vindicated Prophet we never come into judgment but God backed up the very hands of time now y'all y'all y'all y'all think it's I think it's power for 40 minutes but listen to this in the same context is another man whose name is Jonah who went to preach to a city the size of Los Angeles and he went to announce the destruction he told him in 40 days God is going to destroy this place and you know what they did instead of instead of being rebuked instead of being angry the king called a fast they put sackcloth and Ashes on and they begin to repent before the almighty God Amen and God stayed the hand of judgment and took those 40 days away from them that had been judgment by repentance they had backed up the clock of God and had brought back a mercy on a nation where judgment had already been pronounced I don't care what kind of judgment you're under tonight if you would hear the word of the Lord it will back up the hands of judgment amen accept the warning of God say Lord I don't want no kind of spirit that's wrong I don't want no hotess I don't want a pride in my life Lord back it off of you don't have to Humble me Lord I'll humble myself look at what they did they amen they backed that up can I I tell you it's a powerful thing because what gets men in trouble sin what gets families in trouble is sin amen listen to me it's not that you're not exalted the Bible said if you'll humble yourself I will exalt you in due time do you know this is the time for the Church of the Living God this is exactly the time for you to be exalted listen to me the God who is God has spoke over your life and he said you are the final voice to a final Age The God Who is God said whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven the God who is God God has said you're ambassadors and you're spiritual Kings and you have a dominion and everything is under your feet every disease and every devil everything has been placed you have been positioned as a king and Authority by almighty God then we must keep the spirit that goes along with our position oh think about it a minute you know the scripture says that he that overcometh this layout to see an age he said he will give to him to share in his throne th this is this is the age his Dominion you can share in Dominion with God you said brother Wayne what are you talking about in his kingdom amen there is no greater voice than this bride in the Kingdom of almighty God you have a joint Heir in every promise according to the word you know the Bible said in Mark 11 if you say under this mountain be moved and cast the SE it shall be as you have spoken you cannot give that kind of power to a people who don't have the right kind of character that's why the age of the spoken word is the age of adoption and adoption directly deals with the character that's in the Church of the Living God we have got to have a character that is responsible with the power that has been placed into our hand I tell you tonight I know this character amen without character power it makes us fit to rule but if you take power and you take character and you put them together you have a church that's fit to rule you have a church that's fit for power my goodness I think tonight I think we ought to shake off the bands I think we ought to shake off every Spirit that's unlike the Lord every spirit that would say well I don't have to listen to the message or I don't have to accept that or I don't have to believe that we ought to let every one of them go until our spirits come to such a spirit of humility amen that the that whatever judgments have been piling up it will be gone we got a couple more minutes is this okay amen Apostle Peter said this if any man speak then let him speak as the Oracles of God and if any man Minister let him do it as the ability which God giveth that God in all things might be glorified through Jesus Christ to him praise and Dominion forever and ever amen If any man speak let him speak as an oracle of God another words let him be the voice of God if a man's going to speak let him speak the word of God listen to me friends I don't know if you know the position that God has given you you are right now Sons and Daughters of God you're right now Kings seated in Authority with almighty God but we can't do just what we want to do it has to be in line with the word of God brother Wayne is an oracle brother Bram said we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom and like the wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of the hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in the hour we're now living in a living Oracle of God let him speak but let him speak as a living Oracle as a living Oracle see not with his own ability now think about this tonight not with your own ability friend not with my ability the ability don't come from us it has to come from God everything you have has come from God you don't have one thing tonight that you didn't get from God look look at the scripture and the exposition of the church ages brother BM said each individual that the group isn't the one who has an ability to hear from God Amen to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of a messenger those who are hearing are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting a corrective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what a messenger has all already received from God do you see what he's saying look how easy would it be that because of the position we have to start saying little things to our own opinions start putting things out into decree to whatever we think they are to be or how they are how how they should lay but our ability must come from God if we don't stay with a message it becomes a hotty attitude that what we say matters do you see what he is it's coming from an ability God have not come to bring us fear he said I've come to not bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability and all power is given unto me and it is yours to use just speak the word word and I will perform it God has come to give an ability to the church that ability is a message and that you could hear it you've got to be a prophetic class of people you can't just be anybody and receive this this ability has come from God the Revelation has come from God and if you have a revelation it's not a place where we look down on others and say oh they they're this and they're that there ought to be a humble heart coming and saying God help them Lord help somebody that don't see this because what we have has come from God listen tonight the prophet of God said I don't have very much now this is a this is a prophet I don't have any ability I have no personality I have nothing but I've got a soul and I got a voice and it's all yours Lord in perfect strength brother Bram said we got to get empty friends we got to get weak deny your own ability you out on the radio out there you that hear these tapes now I stopped right there when he said that I was listening to it you that hear these tapes whenever they come empty yourself out pour yourself out upon the altars of sacrifice and let the angel come with fire and fill the vessel with the power of the almighty he'll make you strong now Moses himself before God could use him brother Braham said he had lost all of his ability that's when God made him powerful now here's the thing if you actually have an ability brother Bram said you've actually got to strip yourself unless you would try to do something within yourself now this this this right here this set me back in my seat no ability I don't care whose it is will never be usable in the sight of God God has got to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do as long as we feel that we're doing a pretty good job of it then we'll never be able to be used of God you said brother Wayne my ability brother Bram says you've got to dig out the rubbish of your own ability and throw it out of us and make room for the Holy Ghost my you say brother Wayne what what is it it it takes the right Spirit to master your own ability it'll take the spirit of God to master it you see sometimes our only ability is our greatest struggle and that was Moses's problem he was going to take his ability and he was going to deliver the children of God by it and God cured him back there 40 years on the desert brother Bram said his cure come to him he said his cure was he had to get him away from his human ability listen friend tonight what we've read in the scripture here is simply a king who got caught up in his own ability he got drunk on his own power and he decided that he could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted because he was God but there remained to be a God and he had to go through seven years to discover that God is God he could have in one moment said to Daniel you know what Daniel you're right tell you what let me do you instruct me and we'll do exactly what you're saying and let's walk away from this clean tonight listen friend tonight I promise you this there is examples in the scripture where people took the wrong Spirit towards the word proudy and hoty can our musicians come brother Ben they took the wrong attitude they end up dispossessed some of them end up out of their own homes some of them end up in the wrong places I can show you at the Third Exodus go read the Third Exodus and see the prophet said they were coming out of Egypt going back to Israel he said why were they in Egypt to begin with he said because God had made Joseph the leader and they had rejected it they' rejected the Holy Ghost and because of their Spirit they had to go somewhere else and do something different you got to be careful tonight that your spirit will accept the grace of God and that you let your let your let your spirit let it receive the word now especially to you to this congregation I don't mean this as a rebuke I really do not mean this as a rebuke but it is a lesson and I believe it's a lesson to all of us right I believe it's a lesson to any believer because this age is an age I I'm not going to take time in scripture to prove it to you tonight but when this Bible said we've been lifted up into Heavenly places do y'all realize that's not fulfilled until this age in Matthew the 20th chapter a woman looked at Jesus and said let my son said it's your left hand and your right hand position and Jesus said I can cannot do it for it is not mine to give but it will be given unto them that my father had prepared do you know that the prophet said that was the Overcomer of leysa you have been elevated to a position in the word that no other age has ever come to so especially in this hour we have to watch that our Spirits keep up with our position God help us tonight I don't know about you but that's what I want I want I want all of my abilities I want God to rule in this life I want every every Spirit every feeling I know I know I've been in Ministry 20 years I probably felt every feeling I've probably had every Spirit deal with me same same you same the same situations the same feelings of jealousy and envy and pride and and you you you you know You Preach one good meeting and you want to stand up and say hey I've arrived then the next meeting uh you you laying on your face going oh dear God what did I do so ever from then on you say well you know what I found out I can't do this it's going to take God and it'll take the Lord tonight for our lives for our homes for our families amen if you want to stand with me tonight will you will you please not receive this as a rebuke I love
