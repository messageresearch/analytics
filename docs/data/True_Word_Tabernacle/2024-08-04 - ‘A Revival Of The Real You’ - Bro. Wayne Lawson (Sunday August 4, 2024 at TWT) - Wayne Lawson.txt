this morning amen amen so amen you could be seated just for a moment uh stay with me just for a moment here amen and uh if we could this morning let's just stand and we're going to uh ask the Lord and just if we bow our hearts together amen we'll come together for just a moment here in prayer amen I'm I'm trying to gather myself so I can speak I'm sorry I just about don't have any breath the anointing appear and amen so let's just pray father we ask you for your mercy Lord that your strength would just come here Lord upon every heart and every Life as we feel that great sweeping presence of you as you move through the building Lord the Mortal body almost don't know what to do but Lord one of these mornings you're going to give us a new body where we can sit around your throne Lord and fellowship under the atmosphere throughout eternity father now this morning as we come together to to look into your word I pray Lord that you would Quicken our minds you would Quicken our understandings Lord that you would give us mercy and peace in our heart and I just ask you now that you would take this word that you would speak to the need of your people we ask it in Jesus name amen amen and amen if you have your Bibles I'd like to go into the scripture in the book of Ephesians the sixth chapter and I'm going to read here uh from the 6th verse and the 17th verse sixth verse and S uh 6 and 17 I'm just going to read the one scripture and let you be seated and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God you may be seated this morning I want to uh speak from here again if you were with us Thursday night uh we took from here from the Ephesians 6 for the dividing of the soul and the spirit and we were looking uh at this uh from this area because the word of God of course the word is the sword of the spirit and of course Hebrews the 4:12 uh Hebrews 4:12 said that it is a deser between the thought and the intent and between the spirit and the soul which teaches us that there then is a difference between the spirit and the soul and then if you can begin to understand the difference between the two it takes you into another level of Faith or another realm of faith and brings you into this now I I would like to take this for a context thought if I would just for a title I want to speak to you on a Revival of the real you a Revival of the real you now brother Brandon was saying things that are to be that this old Tabernacle here this body is like an old coat that you wear that you once wear now but inside of there it see you are inside there so it's like a wearing a coat but the coat ain't you you're on the inside there so this human body is like a coat that you wear and he said see it's not you you are on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body did you hear how he identified you you the spirit of God are on the inside of that body see your body see your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you call like William brandom or Susie Jones or whoever it is see it's on the inside of that now now the people they've seen you but all they've seen is this and what what what you was your real you is on the inside of that amen but the old Cod itself is just bore the image so the real you is on the inside of that so here here's from the message of the Inside Man 1953 if you haven't heard it you'd love to hear it amen the Inside Man and brother B said do you ever think inside of your body is another man there's another man inside the body it's the spirit man amen now uh just a couple of these quotes you heard Thursday and the prophet of God God will say see the the scientific part of a man the see The Taste the feel the smell the hear is only to contct this Earthly home but it's the Inside Man which is the spirit that contacts God Amen that's the part that contacts God now this is the Inside Man see if that Inside Man is of God it is the spirit of God if the Inside Man is of god it's the spirit of God that's inside the man amen here it is brother Ram tells us this he tells us about Apostle Paul when he was in the Shipwreck and he was warming his fire hands over the fire and the serpent reached out and bit him now that bit the man the serpent bit the man it built the outside man but brother Ram said but inside of him every little cell of blood is aive and there you all he said they were charged full of the Holy Ghost certainly amen that's how they walked on water that's how they done great Miracles because they were perfectly in harmony with God see the very holy spirit that made the heavens and the Earth had so charged this man with power he says till death amen the thing of the serpent wouldn't even go into his body because he was full of the spirit the same as he was full of blood that that is a refrigerator quote he was as full of spirit as he was full of blood amen and every every part of him was charged with that Holy Ghost and brother B tells us the secret that he was ordained to be somewhere so the serpent couldn't kill him because Paul was supposed to go somewhere so God had a purpose for his life and God has a purpose for your life how many knows things are to be what brother ramam said your purpose is he says your purpose is your duty is to express God to this nation that you're supposed to express the gene of God to this nation that is your purpose now of course that this man now is going to feed on psychology and he he will feed on something intellectual but the inside man he feeds on the word of God he feeds on the word of God Amen and that's where the real Great fight is tonight amen or this morning for us is is that man of course amen God took his heart but the devil took his mind and he looks at things with his eye through is human things but the heart is on the inside and God gave eyes to that heart that they might be able to see now we're living in a blind age we're living in a blind leosia amen but God on the inside of a Believer there's a door in your heart called the door of sight and when God gets in that door he opens the door of sight that you might be able to see amen so that's exactly why the Bible says that you should pray that you're that you have the anointing in of your eyes that you might be able to see that it takes anointing to see amen because it's the inside now when the Holy Spirit begins to fall it falls on All Flesh according to Joel chapter 2 that God would pour out his Spirit on All Flesh but not all flesh is saved but the spirit pours out on All Flesh and some people get the rain and they get it right on their flesh and that's as deep as it goes and some people go a little deeper even into gifts and things and it falls into their Spirit which is the second realm but there's a Third Realm of man called The Soul amen and if the spirit ever gets down in that Soul that's where the real germ lays is in the soul of man and if that Gene amen is inside of you that come from God and you get that spirit in that third real there's an eternal life that is quickened on the inside of that believer brother B said the physical will contact the physical and the spirit spiritual will contact the spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is a gene that come from God that's pretty powerful brother Isaiah that's pretty powerful amen if you got a gene that come from God it's no different than your heavenly father giving you a gan than your Earthly father giving you a Ginge then out of that Gan comes a life and out of that life comes character and virtue and potential and ability and it matters what seedline you are concerning what kind of character or what kind of virtue is there listen you're not going to add amen p uh Dove feathers to a crow amen you you can't stick them in you can stick them in but they won't last amen a and but it's got to grow and so is it with the seed Gene of life it has the potential of God on the inside of that seed and if you put the life on the seed it begins to manifest every virtue that is is in God you don't have to work it up or pump it up you got to just let it grow amen and it'll grow because it's in there it comes from the soul and things are to be brother BR says it this he said if you don't line up with the word there's something wrong you see then your real father ain't God because the real start is in your soul amen and before there was even a spirit there is your soul and if that Soul didn't come from God then it's not a germ of God to begin with and you're received you're just in a patch of weeds bearing the world's records amen now he's being pretty straight here amen if you can't if if the word don't mean nothing to you he's saying the soul didn't come from God because the soul that come from God has the life of God on the inside of it it doesn't mean that you're perfect or you're free from mistakes but it means there's a desire in you to do the will of God in this generation now because that real start is in your soul now I I I tell you the the there a significance of that I cannot overemphasize that the start is in the soul that's why brother B said the Holy Ghost is a gift he says but it's a temporal gift but the real gift is that Soul it's that Gene that come from God do you see if it come from God it can't be lost amen that's why the Bible said that there should come in the last days Christ and false Christ that would deceive the very elected if it were possible other words everybody could get under the anointing but there's going to be some people with a gene seed of life inside of them you you can no more deceive them than you can deceive God because the very life in them in other words they're not acting like Christians they are Christians they're not acting like message believers they are message Believers they're they're not acting like children of God they are the children of God Amen it's not an impersonation it is a reality amen that's where the real start comes from now if you watch and and when their eyes were open brother Bram talks about the little woman at the well he loves this he loves this story he tells it so many times amen he tells the woman at the well you know why he tells it don't you because it represents his own Ministry because the Messiah sign that was given to the woman at the well was given to a woman because it would be given to the church in the end time see Jesus had a wicked and adulterous generation shall seek after a sign but there will be no sign given except the sign of Jonas remember the sign of the Resurrection The Sign of the Resurrection would be that when Jesus did the same things in our generation that he did in that generation but because he was the Messiah he was only going to people who were looking for him so the Samaritan was looking for him the Jew was looking for him the Gentile was not expecting a messiah they were idop pacing heathens they had no prophecy of a messiah coming but the Samaritan understood that the Messiah was coming and the Jew understood the Sam the Messiah was coming so he gave his sign to the Jew and the Samaritan but because there was no Gentiles to give it to he took a woman who was a Samaritan amen who was a harlot representing what the church would be when God found them in the end time and when he walked up to the whale he looked right down and brother Bram said it like this that little arrogant ill-famed woman probably poor kid had been turned out in the street he said but right down in her heart she was predestinated it was a predestinated seed laying there see she was a seed to start with before she was an arrogant little girl in the street she was a seed to start with before her life amen a a prostitution she was a seed to start with amen and you can't put enough trouble on that seed Amen to cover up what God can't redeem it out of the midle it really doesn't matter where he finds that seed it's his seed and it belongs to him and he can get it out because he Bel is still God look at what he done look how he found her brother BR said that little seed was laying in there amen skip to the bottom of the paragraph but this little woman her life was all marred up see that outward person the life was all marred up but down in there was a little bit of light way down in there was a seed waiting and as sure as a light can strike a seed it's gerti and it's going to live and the identification brother Bram says something about her he says the word found her I love that don't you in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word became flesh and the word flesh found her and when the word found her he was sharper and quicker than any two red sword and Discerning of the thought and the intent of the heart he pierced past the darkness of prostitution he pierced past the darkness of her of her religious upbringing come on church amen religion had left her in a mess the Pharisees had left her in a mess and she was as done with religion as I'm done with religion I don't know about you all but I don't want religion I want Jesus I want the power of the Holy Ghost to come down in the church with Revival and reality do you see what it was the word found her and when the word found her look at the condition she was in but it's sharp and powerful and it's piercing and it's dividing of the spirit and the Soul her spirit was a prostitute that was the spirit but the Jean seed that was on the inside of her belonged to God brother bam says it like that she was one of those thoughts of God that was manifested woo she was one of those thoughts of God somebody say it thoughts of God thoughts of God she was one of those thoughts of God that was manifested and brother bam in later in identification he said and there were others and there were others that had them thoughts in God's mind he said like Peter and Nathaniel and all of those that was in God's thinking but as soon as that light flashed they recognized it Hallelujah you know what he said you know what brother Ram went on to say he said you didn't have to go down and get them and bring them up to an altar you didn't have to go and drag them to the things of God he said because there was a seed in them and a moment the light went over them they was ready to follow the word of God and I believe this morning there's something on the inside of a Believer amen you don't have to pump them up and make them do it you don't have to talk them into it amen just let the Holy Spirit start going over that seed and something on the inside will break out of them and they begin to follow God you see she was an actual type of the Bride she was a type of the Bride she was a woman a harlot and she had a seed and the messic sign came to her took 2,000 years for that type to mature and brother Ram uses this more than any other thing that he does concerning his ministry over and over and over and over and over and over again because watch He's reflecting somebody from the scripture and brother mam never stood there and said now I'm going to do what Paul did he didn't do that but he said has this been done since Jesus was on the earth and after 2,000 years the Messi sign was done and there was a woman so if there was a messiah sign we know where that fits that was brother brandom but where does the woman fit somebody's life right here this morning reflects the character of that woman that said Amen to that word and it quickened the seed that was on the inside of her that's right it was now brother Bram says it like that that's why in The Rapture brother Bram could come along and say she's Justified now she never done it in the first place now there should be a whole sermon preached on in the first place but I but to save time I'll just say this the first place was in God but before he was God because God's an object of worship right but Elohim is a self-existent one and that's where you were you were in Elohim before there was any physical manifestation you were a part of his thinking of this end time and you were in him then that's why brother B said see then the bride is Justified now now there's a big difference in Justified and forgiven big difference brother man said forgiven means you did it and then I forgave you for it he said but Justified means that you never did it actually never did it in other words if I came to you and I said to you hey I forgive you for being out last night drinking driving around in the car and you said but brother Wayne I wasn't out last night drinking driving in the car amen now I can't forgive you because amen you didn't do it then you're just not you're justified in other words you never did it in the first place now the word Justified means just and I I it's a play on words but just if I'd never done it just if I'd never done it so Justified takes a new meaning it's not justified for you it's Justified never did it amen and that justification brother B says she never done it in the first place now here's the word prophet and he's looking at you but he's not looking at you here he's looking at the Inner Man and he's identifying the Inner Man Came From eternity the Jean seed on the inside of you he is saying it never did it to begin with the real start is the soul the soul didn't start in your body it began in God and it's come and deposited in a body but you were a seed to begin with when you were a little bitty baby coming from this earth into the Earth God had a seed in you already come on Church don't tell me that you had the power to go into a bar when you was born you had the power to tell a lie Amen to cheat commit adultery in this first birth everything when you were born in the earth everything that would ever cause you to sin was in you right then then you got to believe like you got to believe like the Bible says that there was a seed in you also as a son or daughter of a God that when you came up to an altar you were born with the power to do that and no matter how many years you spent in the world that seed was there when God put you on this Earth and this world word has come to redeem that which God had already had in his Earth amen now it's the first place therefore being marred he said but now be being married to The Virtuous Son of God never Sinn she was foreordained now usually I put this in the end of my notes and I never get to it so I'm going to start with it this morning it's in the end of 14 different notes I've had throughout this Ephesian series and I never get to it come on we're just going to start with it if we run out of time glory to God she was for ordained see she was trapped and now she heard the truth and came forth the blood cleansed her what happened she heard the truth she heard the real truth amen she heard the truth for the first time in her life and it took the word to identify her as a thought of God nothing else can do it folks nobody else can identify you but this message has identified this bride not as a Pentecostal not as a Lutheran not as a Baptist but as the bride the literal out ring part of almighty God she never sinned in the first place I love it things that are to be brother B said the word of God bleeding to wash the bride she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place she was trapped into it now when I'm reading this I'm not talking about your human body there's two of you and I'm talking about that germ that come from God that is taking over this human body and this human body is saying you're human but the other part is saying your deity and we have focused so long on the human part that the deity part has been suppressed and oppressed amen and it never gets its way well I think it's time to turn loose of the deity partk and you tell this human partk I'm taking over this body Hallelujah I I believe that it's high time that the word of God is bled that it might release you you you say well somebody brother B said here it is you was trapped into it you want to deal with a human side you were trapped you were trapped into it now let's go in visible Union the brides powerful sermon brother B said you're standing completely Justified you never sined it the first place God don't even know nothing now you're sitting there trying to discuss this with God and God don't know what you're talking about that's the truth amen God don't know what you're talking about brother B said God don't even know nothing it's in the sea of forgetfulness now y'all know brother Bram uh told about it uh brother brother Tim PR I talked it over one time the lady actually was in his church came through a prayer line down in Louisiana she was a smoker came through the prayer line and brother Bram was telling him confess your sins before you get here and there was some people come in front of her and brother Bram called him out smoking and said you need to repent of that smoking then God will heal you and this girl sitting back here grazed a Methodist she got scared she said well I didn't know it was that big a deal but she got she got under conviction and she didn't want her mama know one she didn't want the whole church no one so she got to repentant and when she got in front of the brother bam he never called her out now there happened I think a couple different times and somebody asked brother bradam about it and brother Bram simply said look that if God don't see it how could his profit see when it's put under the blood that is God's created way to destroy sin otherwise you would have to live with the accumulation of your sin your whole life that's an Old Testament law the the blood of the Old Testament pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and it accumulated but that day on Calvary that was a sacrifice made that one drop of the blood of Jesus Christ eradicated every sin that was ever committed from Adam all the way to the end of the world not just the not just sin that was amen but sin that was going to happen God's blood is so powerful he has already destroyed sin you ain't even committed yet he's already destroyed sicknesses that ain't even come up in your body yet because by his strrip you are healed by the blood you are saved do you see the power of that blood this morning amen now I know it's in the sea of forgetfulness now here's the thing you never did it that's a prophet now you were accused of it by the accuser but really I love how he says that get real yeah but really now you're accused of it get real man are you hearing the prophet you're accused of it but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God and you're standing here washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead and absolutely out of existence in the mind of God well glory be to God he said you're accused of it but really you're really a predestinated son to begin with now here brother B was say it like this you were deceived into it by your first marriage and it's no fault of your own but by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery and that's the reason you was born in adulterous you were a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it but it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world now if if we could we don't have time to get in deep in Doctrine this morning in this area but y'all know if you if Adam hadn't to fail you would have been spoken word children in the in the garden right there would have never been no sin in the first place because you were in that the real you was in that Lamb's Book of Life that would have come out in that Garden under the manifested word you would have been a part of that word that would have come out in Perfection amen but because of the failure of Eve you came into the Earth and a perverted birth with spiritual Amnesia amen and therefore brother R is saying it's not your own fault you were born here but really there's a germ that was in you was to be you the real you before the foundation of the world now Jesus himself and redeemed brother Ram said what did he redeem he redeemed your soul from hell that's what he is he's a redeemer of the Soul Jesus is a redeemer he redeems by process 1964 future home brother brandham tears apart the idea there's two Souls of course some people don't read all the message they read one part of it and they run off with something and then they cause a lot of confusion usually it's excuse for sin usually usually uh the Mis the mishandling of the word is done to make a hole that some man wants to fulfill some perversion just to be honest amen and they then therefore by doing this amen they they they uh make two different Souls now now if you want to understand the Redemption of the soul and understand how there's an old soul and a New Soul you got to go to Future home and you look at the Earth itself and brother B said watch there's three different Earths there's an old world there's a present world and there's a world to come but it's all the same Earth and the soul is just one soul but it's now a redeemed soul and that redeemed soul is through a process that God came down through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed you now that Redemption of you is the real you is that right to show you now brother Brown the message identification is powerful paragraph 77 he said to show you is the ones that he thought of his thoughts is the Christian of today how many Christians I got in here today his thought is the Christian today do you see you were actually his thoughts before the world began see man was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the Earth speaking lies and there is nothing in him at all see but if he was God's thought when he come to the world he's God's thought to the beginning to display an attribute do you follow me then Jesus came to break the clouds back so that an attribute could display itself he is God's expressed word nothing else could be manifesting other characters had already fallen see Jesus came to redeem now now uh this is very uh I would need to really slow down to get this area but y'all's quick so I'll just say it fast but Jesus was a redeemer right he was a redeemer but job said my redeemer lives so the life is the Redeemer see now there's no life in the Bible that could redeem Fallen man see every thought that fell from heaven would have had to go unfulfilled except that the life of God could get into the thought and then Resurrect The thought now that life had no way to get to man unless it come through Calvary and was released as a spirit upon man so the so the Holy Spirit redeems the Fallen thought of God and makes you a Christian today so there it is brother B says see anything is to bring it back it's God's thought see that that think that little you that little me no one the world could take our place see it was God thought now Jesus says this in John 17:5 he said father glorify me with the glory I had before the world was the glory before the world was brother Ram said then Jesus was the only man that had pre-incarnate knowledge that's odd to me that William brandom then comes along and he starts talking about in the beginning God and then he said now before that so whatever knowledge it was that wrote the Bible and had existence before the Bible has spoke to us in this generation through an Elijah Prophet to make known and identify what it was even before and what it was in the Bible and what it is now do you see what he's doing he's showing you an identification in God he's identifying you in the Bible and now he's identifying you today what's he doing he's bringing a perfect faith that we were chosen in God before the found nations of the world brother Brandon brings us this in in questions and answers in 1953 and he said the first man he made was In His Image returning back to the image to our first created image when God created me William brandom I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious as far as I know of he says but I don't believe you're getting it but Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said that he chose us before the foundation of the world that for some part of me Arman Neville all of the rest of you here that is in Christ was there before the world began and this is my analysis of this I think the people today are possessed with the spirit or the spirit a part of the Angelic Spirits which rotated off of God and never fell in the beginning and resisted the LIE of the devil in heaven then when that great theophany be to spin in heaven brother BR said off of that rotated spirits and he said those Spirits have anointed people in this generation that they wouldn't believe the lie of the devil in this that's why the Bible could say that in the end time there will be false Christ but you won't deceive the elected because somebody's character will reflect that scripture because they were there in in the beginning they were there when Jesus prophesied and now they're setting right here this morning this is not just an abstract bride you're not just a bride of his imagination this Bride is a reality of the Fulfillment of the thought of allmighty God listen this is a real bride she's a true bride there's been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there's got to come one that is the Fulfillment of the vision we're not here just to talk about it you are that hallelujah what is it now brother Ram has some powerful things to say you would think he was educated in the idea he said when his program was laid out the whole thing you were recognized in the program because you got eternal life now that word Eternal means it never did begin and neither can it end how many's got eternal life now come on raise it up high let's get some faith that life never began now I know you think it started on some day that's not true that life never began because it's Eternal neither can it end that's why we don't believe in pre-existence of souls you're not pre-existence you're Eternal you're you're you're a part of God do you see you you you're a part of his attribute now when brother B says this he says see it came in you an attribute of God's thinking before the world was ever created now that's the only way you can have eternal life and that life he was thinking of you is in you now that life that was before the world that was thinking of you is in you now right my goodness that that life yeah that was thinking of you is in you now see there's no way to separate that hallelujah what is it brother B said it's Elohim materializing right it's just Elohim materializing what is it that life has already come into the church brother brandom says it like this he said a real believer no matter what they are the thoroughly satisfied the thoroughly convinced because the life that is in them has already become Christ the life that is in you has already become Christ now if you take that quote and amen it comes and go wait Jesus amen let me ask you where's he at today you want to talk about the bride coming of Christ amen open up your eyes folks has she been so long with you that you have not known who she was listen Jesus was with Peter and he was on a wood boat and brother R said it was made of common wood and the creator of the wood slept in the boat and he was asleep he said but here we are he said made of Texas mud and Indiana mud and Ohio mud and the same one that was in that boat is in this boat it's the same life Hallelujah the same life and the life that is in you has become Christ amen that's why you can look at her and say she is him because it's the same life now here's the thing there has never come a message that could reflect the exact character of Jesus to identify himself on the earth now now um brother Brandon will say it very clearly in adoption he said you're actually never able to have the right kind of Faith until positionally you know right do you see faith is not just a a quickening it's a positioning because look let's get real okay you you when you get married let's just put it that way when you get married and you're living with one another and you got the marriage certificate and you had the wedding video and you got rings and you share a home together does that mean every day is going to be the best day but your position you got to know that that's your position and the bride is married in this age it's the marriage of the Lamb that's your position and you know really you have a you have a checkbook this is checkbook time you see what it is now you'll never really have the right kind of Faith until positionally you know that now here's the here's the thought his brother Brown will say this it's pretty amazing how he does say it he says down there in Kentucky and he said we lived in a a log house he said no clapboard shingles and things and he said there was a mirror at our home he said but it was just a mirror piece of it tacked up on a tree and there was a little warh bench out there and it was a picture pump and he said dad would Pump It Mor's hands and looked in the mirror and he said I see Mama stand out there and try to comb her hair CU there was no mirror in the house now now how many ever uh when you a kid how many ever found a little piece of mirror you just found a little piece of it you know and you tack it up on a tree or you put it up on a little piece and you know you have a hard time reflecting more than just a portion that's right yeah you know and usually usually they're foggy or dirty or half broke and you know you know and it don't do a real good job of reflecting the whole image and brother R said that that there was a little boy he said he was raised in a home much like ours and one day he went down to his grandma's y'all y'all remember the story and and they were a little better off down there and they went down to the town and he said upstairs there they had a a mirror that was on the back side of the door and he said he stood there and the little lab was lonesome he was looking around and he said he happened to look at that door that had been closed he said but then somebody must have opened it and he saw the back of that door he saw a mirror on it now now this Prophet is not just telling the story folks he's telling you that up to the opening of the word there's just been a little mirror tacked on the wall that we could get glimpses of what that real bride looks like but when that door opens up there is a is anybody ever seen one of them full length mirrors we got one of them in our bedroom I I skipped past that thing but it reflects the full image to you you can literally there's there's mirrors that can tell you what you look like there's mirrors that can tell you exactly who you are exactly what you're looking like and the message of the hour is not a partial look at the bride it's not just a little piece or a little Glimpse or a little part but it's a real face to face complete view of what she looks like from the body of the feet all the way to the Head I'll tell you this the prophet of God said that great mirror this morning is his word and we ought to be able to identify ourselves he says with something we're going to speak about now we were talking about in the Bible study on Friday it was it was it I used it kind of as a as a humor but but it's really true amen most of you got mirrors in your house and and you know they're they're usually personal they're for every you know you usually got a mirror for you you know and we were laughing about it and I was talking about brother Seth I know he's a NIC looking guy but I said Seth when did you ever get up in the morning and go look in the mirror and just look for a minute and go there stands a messiah can you can you just see him standing in the mirror looking Mariah come here you got to see this guy that's a messiah standing looking right here brother Isaiah you surely you ain't never done that but see the reason he don't do that is because in that mirror is a human a human man looking and he sees all the imperfection and he sees All the Troubles of the years he sees all the problems and they're all collected in the image that he's looking at it identifies all the years and the struggles and the problems and the issues and it's all looking back at him right there in that mirror amen but there's another mirror come on Church there's another mirror called the word of God and there's something about it when you start looking in this one that you'll holler for somebody to come here and see what the prophet said about me come here look here here's the Messiah right here here it is I was in him before the foundation of the world Carissa come and look it's a messiah do you see Church of the Living God Amen there is a reflection out of the mirror this morning of the real you that mirror at home is not the real you it's just bearing what's on the inside but on the inside of you is royalty you are looking at the Queen of Heaven you are looking at God God's attributes you are looking at the reason and the purpose of his being everything that God is is in this church everything every bit of his reputation all that was in God was poured into his son and all that was in Christ has been poured into this bride now I know we sit here this morning we look at the Bible and but for the first time we can see ourselves across the pages of the Bible we're not just a one scripture Church we're not just a one one one little Creed or one little Doctrine or one little piece we we have not taken one little area of the message and seated it down and said this is all there is to it brother it's an open book it's a whole book and the Bible said to eat the whole lamb and don't eat it Soden with water and don't water the thing down but put some fire under it and roast it and make it tasty ah I believe it this morning do you see what it is amen that the when the when the Bible starts opening up brother BR said it become a new book right right it become a new mirror let's just put it that way and brother Bram says it like this he said see every Parable in the Bible and every type of the Bible is made manifest right before us the same God in the pillar of fire that wrote it he came and make it manifest now watch him in Christ revealed in his own word and evening light says come on in every Parable everywhere we go nature Bible he said whatever it was Daniel Kings of those days everybody every form every move every place positionally shows the hour we're living in this entire Bible speaks of This Moment In Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother B said he had a goal in his mind and he said it's put in every type that's in the Bible the seven seal when it opened up we found out it was in every type that was in scripture because the seven seal is Christ it is life life and it's coming to the church do you see the third pole is not something for somebody else it's not just something for brother brandom the third pole we are a part of that by predestination that is our part of that word life is coming in so when you start reading the Bible do you see what the message does it redeems your life and it lets you look in the scripture when that life was represented as David when that same life that's in you was presented in scripture you can see yourself as David one morning you know you you fight your Goliath but but but that's not your only type that's only a portion of your character but you can see another character in shamgar when you pick up your ox nood and you go to whipping and you can see another portion of your character when you see Samson pick up the Jawbone or when you see Gideon coming under the inspiration and destroying his enemy you can see other parts of your body other than just that one part come on Tamar can't you see yourself when you were in desperation that part of you is a life that was causing Tamar to do what she done you don't know it but that was in God's mind when Tamar was preserving the seed line of Judah she was becoming a part of the coming of the Lord look that life was descending to Earth wasn't it and it was coming right through judah's line so Tamar had to do her part come on Rahab you had to do your part and I can show you in the Bible who you are in the Bible I can show you Rahab and I can show you the part she played and it only mirrors the life that you live and here you can identify yourself with it what was it they was a part of the descension he descended through 42 Generations yeah that's right go read them it's 41 actually but the 42nd generation was yet to come in Isaiah 53 from the cross he cried and that who shall declare his generation there shall be forth a seed and a generation shall be counted as the seed and who is that seed this morning but the Royal Seed of Abraham who then can look back in scripture and show their identification in every type that's in the Bible you are Sarah and you're Abraham you're David amen and your Samson see you see every one of those types are reflecting because it was a life that was in them that caused them to do what they were doing amen I'll tell you there was a time when Paul was here and Paul said in First Corinthians he said we look in a mirror dimly but one day face to face one day we're going to know as we are known there's the life that newest is going to be revealed and when this thing begins to open we begin to see him face to face and we are changed into the same image so something has been molding you throughout your life some some life has molded the character of your human life but this life that comes from Christ will mold you into the character of Christ see there's a real you there's a real Church somebody said which is the real church I'll tell you what a prophet said he said even Satan knows that God is immutable in his ways and even Satan can assuredly know the church at Pentecost with the power of God is Mark 16 in action and the true church that Jesus claims as his own amen Mark 16 in action is the true church Jesus claims as his own now Christ in this true church will be a continuation of the book of Acts Christ in this true church will be a continuation of the book of Acts and in this bride Greater Works will be done this bride will be Greater Works will be there and listen here is where the weakest Christian can stand this is where I take my stand that re Revelation is the greatest prevailing power that is known to man Revelation is a prevailing power and brother brandom says it is the thing that gives you authority over the Devil Revelation is what causes you to understand who you are it identifies you but that Revelation cannot come from just a school like a teacher putting two scriptures together brother ROM said it'll take Supernatural instruction for the church to understand who they are by scripture there's nobody can take you through this Bible and show you yourself except the life that wrote the Bible gets inside of you and then you can see the mirror and understand my life is his life and he I'm just as much a part of that word as he is a part of that word there is nothing of such prevailing power as the power of Revelation brother BR said one of these days now I I know I don't know about you all but Rapture is my goal Rapture is my goal so the Revelation I really desire is the one that raptures you that's the one that really goes and a lot of people has that out in the distance but brother brandom didn't put it in the distance in the Rapture book he said look he said she's waiting for that Revelation and a couple verses later a couple of pages later he begins to say that first Thessalonians 4 is a revelation of a three-fold purpose of God and the out is a message the voice is when the bride begins to believe it and the trumpet is the changing of the body the revelation of the Rapture is it comes in a progression of threefold and it begins with the word and when the word takes preeminence in your life it molds the character of Jesus Christ that's why brother brandom said the new birth is a revelation glory to God it's a revelation it gives you Authority that God is revealed revealed to you this great mystery that's your new birth amen oh if the church only knew its position it will one day and the Rapture is going to go when it knows what it is hallelujah you say preacher I want a Rapture Revelation your position in Christ is the revelation of the Rapture in this last day we are not just a layout to see in church we have been positioned in first Thessalonians 4 there has has been a change from a death cycle to a Rapture cycle and the church is on their way to a change of the body do you see what it is what happened what happened to Adam and Eve disbelieve the word and they fa but God has sent a message to speak another word and it's a word of incorruptibility that will resurrect the church and will change them in the moment in the twinkling of an eye if the church only knew its position and let me ask you this how are you going to identify yourself in this word without this life the life that was in him from the beginning that's why I took so much time to tell you the life in you is the thought he had then and that thought has been reflected through every scripture that's ever been written you can go to every type and find Christ so brother B said Jesus was the Fulfillment of the Old Testament but this Bride is a fulfillment of the new New Testament you have the interpretation of that word you see what it is it's not identified us in a morg it did identify us as a dead Church it identified us as the living manifestation of the word of the Living God come on church this bride will not fail she can't fail because she's the word to begin with my goodness when you think of [Music] it now true identification we know that Jesus was the Messiah we know he was the son of God we know he was the bridegroom he was God's Tabernacle yeah God said so he said so at the River Jordan and he said so on Mount Transfiguration but where it really spoke was in a tomb on a Sunday morning but where it really spoke was in a tomb on a Sunday morning and brother Bram said there his cold body laid dead in that tomb it laid there dead in that tomb but it wasn't to that life came back in that body that it was identified as God you see it wasn't the death that identified him as the resurrected one it wasn't the death that identified him as Isaiah but it was the resurrection that identified him and when the life come into the body that was God saying this is my body and then that body was reflected throughout the scriptures down Through the Ages do you see then the life brother brah said his body was not held in the grave it was res recognized with him in Resurrection the same as he is now listen which means this the word which he is has beg to rise the word went from Luther and Wesley and began to raise in power and begin to move and then it loved a little more but now it's coming up to identification wooo Glory it's coming up to identification do you see what he's saying when the bride knows who she is that's when the Rapture is going to go when you get your position when you know who you are by the word that's when the Rapture will go and brother B says it's coming up time now to identification see watch to the life in the body true identification is the life in the body that's what it is is brother Ram says it like that the life in the body is a Vindication the Rapture is at hand there's nothing else to happen see just the Harvest that's just the Harvest then see see what what's watch Jesus uh watch God quit his creation What What In the Garden of Eden why did he quit creating he quit creating because he reached Perfection right why does the Farmer harvest the field because the seed has reached back to seed again life has moved to its fullness to identify what the plan is and why would God continue the church age when life is now coming up to identification that this is the bride that was in his mind before the world began and who could tell you that unless it was the life that thought of you that came to you come on church this message is more than just a bunch of teaching it is the return of the pillar fire which you were a part of to begin with has come here to redeem you and identify you and say this is my people I can't call you Church no more I'm going to have to call you bride and when the bride recognizes mama that's me then she's going to go you you you you you see the correlation when she starts recognizing and seeing I know some of this is real Elementary to you but you forgive me for my elementary thoughts but I'll say this but up there in those Stars you were recognized in that pyramid you were recognized in this scripture you're recognized in the message you're recognized you just had to recognize that's you somebody's in the pyramid somebody's in the Stars somebody's in the pillar of fire mama that's me that's in there I know they've talked about it amen but there is a real you there's a real you and it's reflected in the scripture now you say preacher why in the world is it so important to see me because if you know who you are you know what belongs to you watch Abraham walking out in the out out in the promised land and when he meets mecdc out there he's just separated from lot and his Brethren and he gets out there and he's not got anything over him the Lord looks at him and says hey look to the north you look to the South and you look to the east you look to the west and everything you see belongs to you and the Church of the Living God if you get all of the unbelief beat off of you and you get all of the traditional ideas beat off of you everywhere you look in the Bible you can say that's me that's me mama that's me that belongs to me joy belongs to me peace belongs to me the Holy Ghost belongs to me life belongs to me do you see I just heard brother bam on tape this morning he's Discerning person after person he said that ought to beat the dross of unbelief off of you I said it did Brother random I believe you it beat the dross of unbelief off of my eyes and not I'm not just reading a couple Pages I'm seeing Eternal thoughts manifested in the age where we're living in every promise in This Book Is Ours no man come to the father except by me see you got to come through that life to be recognized as a part in John 6:44 Jesus tells the truth that's why brother Braham says he would get on election and he' get on it real strong well I guess I picked up his habit election and election real strong now there might be brothers that feel more qualified to beat the church into position but that ain't me I read where the prophet of God said that Israel was putting in their Nation by persecution but the church would be put in its position by the power of God so I say open up the channels and let the power of God come until we find our position in that word brother you don't have to brother said it in the spring of the year you never seen angels with with uh uh with ladders up and down the road on the on the oak trees you never seen a bunch of angels God ain't got a ain't got a lick a leaf picking poliy that comes in the spring of the year to get the old last year's leaves off but man said they nobody has to do that he said they may hang on their all winter but when the New Life Starts coming he said when the New Life Starts coming it just pushes off the old and it brings on the new brother let the new life get in that inner man and it'll push off the old habits it'll push off the old ideas it'll push them off we don't have to compromise we don't have to beat somebody into form just get life in them and Watch The Life begin to bring changes that's right amen because these people are ordained to believe there are three classes of people and I really believe these are genuine Believers I say that because somebody who had their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life was before the foundation of the world I happen to believe I was on that book you say how do you know you're on that book well how' Peter know it how did Peter know to reflect his self in that book how did he get from from a ignorant fisherman to recognizing he was in that book brother Bram said I'll tell you how he did it he said when that Messiah sign strick over that seed he said he knew his name was in the book because the light struck the seed that's exactly what happened that woman the wh That's exactly what happened to people throughout the nation and that's exactly what happened to me do you see what it is you identify yourself as having your name in that book brother Bram said God never came goth it not he said he never came to redeem the devil's children he came to redeem his own that's what it was he come to redeem his own his own children now as sure as there's a natural seed there's a spiritual genan seed and in that genan seed brother Bram said that Gene is in us and we were Sons and Daughters of God to begin with when God called you he had already for ordained you for when God called Romans 8:29 and 30 to the to them that he called he's already Justified and them that he justified he's already glorified I love how brother Brown reads it and says let the devil have all the temper tantrum he wants to have they're already glorified not in this body but in the presence of God now I know some people maybe don't agree with this but I'm preaching and I know brother Ray believes it and I believe it so we're going to preach it anyhow but do you know in Matthew 18th chapter that Jesus said that all children die goes to heaven and he said the reason being is their Angels behold the father's face and when he picked that up brother brandham was asked about that question and brother brandham said that's the aanes that's your angelic body amen not that you're an angel we're talking about Celestial and he said that body is in the presence of the father no wonder he could say you're already glorified somebody said well you don't even have a theophany really brother bam said when you recognize this message is Eagle food you heard from it well I don't know about you but I heard from my fony and my I didn't just hear it I heard a call from it and that call come right out of this message that that that was the very thing that brother bam said was that was that theophany standing there that's why he could therefore say they're already glorified now brother brandham actually seeing those bodies within 20 ft of his bedroom I don't know how long this building is but it's a lot longer than any 20 ft so I'd say a person sitting in the middle of this building strikes a very good chance of being within the reach of the theophanies that's beyond the curtain of Time come on church it's not a million miles away it's just in a dimension that's a little faster than this one and the prophet of God is telling us one of these days we're going to speed up oh that's why this anointing that came is not an ox anointing it's not laying bound and slow it's an eagle anointing and they catch the Revelation amen it's a quicking in the end time it's a spirit of God that comes upon the church it's the real you now now I'm going to say this amen uh uh Revival uh brother Seth but where of you brother that's a that's a good quote you sent me this week Amen on Revival I think you come out of recognizing your presence Topeka if you hadn't heard the Topeka series go listen to the Topeka series it's amazing son of man's all through there but in that brother Bram describes what a real Revival is now what a real one is and he says really he says what a real Reviving is a real Revival is not an adding right it's not an adding he said what that is is it's a cleaning up of what you got it's a it's a it's a refreshing of what you got now I I know the church is growing and I appreciate the Lord for letting it grow but I don't want just see the church grow I want to see predestinated seed that's why we're not backing off of the message we're not going to we're not going to water the message down to incorporate all the world come on Church we're going to preach the message and bring the genuine Fe and feed the word of God this is the theophany calling back we're not interested in building the biggest church we're interested in preaching the message of the hour to the elect seed we're going to leave here one of these mornings are you reading the news Israel's in a great mess it may be in the morning this bride may be finding her position this morning the last one might be setting hearing me preach this morning then why could I preach a Baptist sermon or why could I preach a Lutheran sermon worried about somebody's feelings getting hurt brother you can't hurt the bride's feelings with this message you can't hurt the bride's feelings with this message they're not scared of the name William brandom they're not scared of the Holy Ghost they're not scared of shouting and rejoicing and praising because they were there when the Bible said job shouted woo somebody's shouting right here this morning somebody said well that's just too far but here's the problem is brother bam said last one's going to come in somewhere it might not be a churchwide Revival it might not be a World Revival it may be one person one person when God went to Lazarus in the Tomb it was one man coming out which represents this bride's Revival it may be one person at a time it may be in one person and not another but he called Lazarus by name and so has this message called you by name brother what was it when that Revival began it was a hearing of the name brother B said this book holds the mystery and the unfolding of it now the mystery of this book is calling names the opening of the word the opening of the door put a mirror before the church told you who you was called your name said come on your rewards what is it amen the same one that woke up ji's daughter with not a general Resurrection but he said the woman sleepeth she don't she didn't die she sleeps and brother B said what was it her name was on the Lamb's Book and there might have been many maidens that morning that had went to sleep or died he said but not that one and when he went down to the house he proved brother B said he proved his word was right when he spoke her name and she come alive he said but he proved something else too he said he also proved that he was all knowing he had four knowledge and he knew her name before he called her and God knew your you see this message has four knowledge it knew about you before you got here you don't think brother Ram just preaching to the people in the 60s do you man he was calling it an infant bride Church in the 60s you see what it is he proved he was God and he proved what he knew was there now it looks dark for Revival and I understand there's a lot of darkness in the world we're living in it looks dark but it's no darker than it was the night that the disciples were on the sea and brother said a devil got on every wave and said I'll sink this ship the problem with that ship is Jesus wasn't on it oh but brother Bram said oh he said there it is but when all the Hope was gone for Revival they saw him walking on that sea they saw him walking on that sea how many knows what that actually represents now when brother Bram says it brother brother Bram says one place he says brother Bram are you saying the spirit of God will be on the church and brother man said yes he said that's exactly what the book of Isaiah says the government shall be on their shoulders and then he goes over to the Book of Daniel the 12th chapter and he opens it and Daniel said he seen times and times and half a time and then the book would be opened and he said there was a man in the water standing there with a Wi on and brother Braham said there it was it was the Holy Ghost on the water he said what did the water represent in Revelation 17 it was the people so when you see the Holy Ghost on the people it will be a sign of the end time when Jesus come walking on the water brother Bram said it represented the Resurrection Ministry of Christ would come to the people on the water in other words it would come through the people and the people when they when they when they when they were without hope when it was dark when they were only worried about survival he said here he come walking and if that hasn't happened again and if that hasn't happened again he said but the people are afraid of it now watch the only hope to survive and the people are afraid of it the only way to get into the Revival that people are afraid of and the prophet of God goes on to say this he says see but here he says what it is he said when when that little boy died back there in the scripture and he said the the woman sent after Elijah he G she gave a she gave a stick to her servant said go get go go run or Elijah did actually told his servant said go run lay the stick on the boy and he said don't you stop for nothing and brother Ram said that's the same way with our commission that's the way Miracles are done is that we go without stopping for soup suppers Bunko games worldly events and then he says what you have to do is you got to lay aside all of those things of the world he said we're stopping too much he says and then we're because watch what listen what he's doing he's laying out what's stopping the church he's saying you've been commissioned to go do this but you you stop for mle games you stop for card parties you stop for denominations and then he stops IT and throws it in here he says and then we're stopping because if we're afraid we're going to get too fanatical is't that something brother bram's being afraid of the moving of the spirit right in with Bunko games and card parties we're afraid we're going to get too fanatical and brother B said I'm more scared of the person that's afraid of it than I am the person that's the fanatic I'm more afraid of the person that's afraid of the Holy Ghost than I am the Holy Ghost getting out of line now somebody said well brother Wayne hey man I've just been in some meetings and they just get so rough well I'll tell you what brother Ram says he said somebody said today I've seen Pentecostals kick the seats over in the floor yeah and break up the furniture yeah and he said have they got anything and brother bam said oh yeah he says they have the Holy Ghost he said yes sir he says well we Baptist have it too he said if you did you got it after you believed when you believed they believe you get it when you believe but Acts 19 says have you received it since you believed and he said I can stand a little wildfire and a kicking over the furniture before I could set in an old church so cold the spiritual thermometer goes below zero brother R said I'd rather you kick the pews over as turn the heat off off amen now now what's he talking about see brother B says but what's really happening is people's only painting a fire to the church he said that's what these Baptists are doing thank God we're not Baptist this morning he said that's what their Baptist is doing amen he says there he says what good does a freezing man do with a beautiful picture as a great fire but it burnt 2,000 years ago how you going to warn by that it'd be like me coming up here and putting a big old backdrop of a nice pretty fire with a bunch of people and you can even put the 12 apostles around the fire warming their hands but how you going to get warmed of that that's 2,000 years ago now Church these meetings that brother random had were 50s and 60s and some of you heard about the revivals of the 80s and you've heard about the '90s this is 2024 how you going to re how you going to warm this new generation by the fires that happened 50 years ago we can tell them how God came and how God did and what God did but I say what we ought to do is we ought to build a fire just like the one that saved me and just like the one that saved you hallelujah hallelujah I don't want to paint no fire I want to build one I want to build a fire that's so hot it'll burn out every disease it'll burn burn out every sin it'll burn out every formalism I say build a fire and throw some gasoline on it while you're busy and let the Holy Ghost Flames Begin to burn across the Church of the Living God I'll tell you what brother Ram says it like this he says he we don't need this in the Millennium we're not going to need this in the Millennium we need it right now we don't need a miracle in the Millennium we'll have a glorified body in the Millennium we don't need a praise service in the Millennium we need it right now we need these old bodies that are arguing with the inner man these old clumps of clay that are formal and they're tired and they're weary and they're upset we need them to get under the submission of the inner man until they begin to worship God and the fear leaves and the trouble leaves that the power of God can sweep through the church like never before I say every generation has a chance I say every young person ought to know what it's like brother Dallas I don't believe we ought to have to take our kids to no dance before they can dance I don't believe our children ought to have to learn how to dance under rock and roll parties down at the bar I think they ought to be a holy ghost moving in the church where the victory songs can be sang where we can clap our hands and move under the spirit of God and not feel bad about it tomorrow well somebody help me this morning I don't believe we ought to have to feel bad tomorrow because we worship God [Applause] today I'm I I'm serious I don't believe that these young people are to have to drink whiskey to experience being drunk I know what a prophet said he said we ought to get so drunk that we forget our names brother that's pretty drunk we ought to get so drunk in the spirit till we forget what our name is and remember who we really are remember we really are the children of God we really are the presence of God in the age we're living in my goodness to think of it today somebody said well I'll tell you what brother Wayne you know it's just that old it's just that old Wildfire well brother B said I'd rather have a fire it's popping and you have to throw coals back in it it's not have one at all if you're cold and this is a cold age this is a dark time and the only hope is to get the life in you that's in that fire and that fire created you it can identify you it's a painted fire brother R said he said now what good would it do to feed a canary and keep it in a cage amen let me ask you what good would it do for me to preach the greatest message that's ever hit the planet astronaut fuel that would break every barrier it'll tear down every Power it'll destroy every unbelief it'll put a gust of wind under the wings of the church it'll bring inspiration and powers and fellowship of Truth amen what good is it to preach a message like the message we have been given amen and not let the church enjoy it come on church what good would it do to feed them the word and then tell them they can't be Sons and Daughters of God with freedom well I tell you what if they can be sons of God in heaven I think they ought to be here and if they're Daughters of God in heaven they ought to be here and if they shouting in heaven they already to be able to shout here if they have joy in heaven I say have joy in here and there ain't no devil going to take my joy I ain't going to allow it brother now sorry too late somebody say well I can't believe our pastors acting like that hey look if I can't do this and be a pastor I don't need to be a pastor then if if David if David as a king could dance before the the Lord in front of his whole country I believe a pastor hard to be able to dance in the spirit and say God is my Creator and God filled me with the Holy Ghost yes he did and I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed to worship him I'm not ashamed to give voice to him I'm not ashamed of the power of God I say Bring it on I say young people Bring it on Bring the fire bring the fire of God we're going in a camp meeting it won't be like our Thursday night services it may be a little more fiery than normal but I say that true word Tabernacle F the Flames of the Holy [Applause] Ghost brother Wayne I was in a fanatical meet one time and I'll tell you what I'm just going to pull back a little bit okay you pull back brother Bram taught us how to do that he said me and my brother work through the woods one day and he said we found no turtle and he said he pulled his head back in the shell and he said you know what he said I'll get his head out of there and he said he went over and got him a switch and he said he beat that shell he said that head never came out he said I know how to do it on I'll baptize him he took him over and put him in the water and brother R goes He floated right to the bottom and Bubbles started coming up but he never come out he said oh but brother when we got him out of that water he said I got the trick he said they went over and build him a fire and they set that Turtle right on top of the fire brother that got him moving and I tell you what you do you build a fire hot enough and it'll move you you get a fire burning hot enough and it'll move and I say God has sent us a fire we don't have to start one we got one all we got to do is enjoy the Flames there's people setting in here's got the same experience that they got on the day of Pentecost there are people sitting here at the same pillar of light that came on the day of Pentecost is in them right here this morning I'll tell you what I've been identified I've been identified I've been identified you you said preacher what are you really talking about I'm an American nobody got no problem with that do [Applause] you Europe's history ain't much better brother but brother Bram said if you're an American right he said you were with George woron when he crossed to Delaware you were there when that happened if if you were an American you were with a blinking when he when he just decided there won't be no more slavery you were there when they rang the Liberty Bell to break and give Liberty from Britain and they pledged their allegiance and they pledged their their their fortunes and they decided to be in America and there was America fors and it's had it shame and it's had its Glory but if you're an American you identify with all of it and brother man said if that be true about our natural heritage what about the seed that's on the inside of you that if you're a Christian you were there when job was shouting for Joy if you're a Christian you're there when God put Adam in the Garden of Eden if you're a Christian you've come down the Nile and the basket with Moses amen if you're a real Christian amen you stood there to banks of the Red Sea with Miriam when she's played her tambourine and she rejoiced amen come on girls you know you know what I'm saying if you're a Christian you was there you say I never danced in the spirit yeah you did you did there on the banks of that Jordan or that Red Sea if you're a Christian you were there you were there when the pillar of fire came down and wroe out the Commandments you were there you were there when they crossed the Jordan and they marched Down the Walls of Jericho you were there when these things happened you was always in there in every type you was there but you think you were less there when John baptized Jesus and a pillar of Fire come out of the heavens and got into him do you think you were less there when he cried from the cross my God my god father forid them they don't know what they do brother BR said you were there he said you were there in him and you paid for your sins in him and you paid for your deaths in him and you died in him but brother three days later he come out of the Tomb and and we rose with him on that Easter morning we rose from the dead out of that out of that grave and I was there and I was there when he came out of the grave and I was there when 120 somebody said well brother Wayne how do you know that you would have been there cuz I'm here now I know I'd have been there cuz I'm here brother BR said that's the way you do it look at the character you are now and you'll know what you would have [Applause] been I was there oh yeah I don't remember how many thesis Martin Luther tacked up how many was that I say it wrong every time 90 something huh 95 95 of them I was there for all 95 and I was there when that man had something on the inside of him and says I will not bow to this system I don't regret what I have said and I will not bow to the system it says I can't say it I was there that's right I was there when when the Holy Ghost fell up there oh yeah but brother you see that's where most people quit their identification stops right there with a partial image of the church that the tongues come on the day of Pentecost there in isua 1906 when the spirit of God begin to fall and that's where a lot of people start identifying the world over in the charismatic Realms that's as far as God wi as far as they could concern but brother in 1933 there was a light come down out of that Jord over that Ohio River just like it did the Jordan amen and that star that come down and brightened our Trail I was there somebody said well it didn't happen it did happen I was there when it happened I was there when it happened I saw it with my own eyes now you think I'm crazy don't you well let me tell you I am not in the feet of the church I looked in the mirror I'm not in the shoulders of this church I'm not even in the mouth of this church I went into the eye of the church and Malachi 4 gave us eyes and we got eyes to see what happened in 1933 and I got eyes I could see what happened when God visited that man in 1947 in a pillar of fire it turned into a bean just like it did with Joshua at the walls of Jericho do you see what it is I I was there and some people now try to say these things didn't happen but I was there do you see when that when that cloud appeared out there on Mount Sunset brother B said it's our Lord up there what was it it was headship oh he thought about you and me was being revealed in that headship which became this message I was there brother I didn't stop in 1963 and I didn't stop in the Easter of 1965 when they put our profit in the ground but I was there when these little church churches started forming all over the country and Men of God begin to bust and and plane out and make trails and inner roads for the teaching of this world I was there amen 40 years ago when Ray Ericson founded this church of True Word Tabernacle I was there but brother I wasn't just there then I'm here this morning to confess that the same God the same God that done that is doing this and this generation has a chance at the Revival how do I know I was there and I'm right here this morning stand to your feet with me this morning hallelujah hallelujah and I'm right here this morning we got a chance at this revival but ain't I stand in the prayer line with you when God blessed you and I wasn't only there when that happened I stood in the blessing see if you were there you're here if you were there you're here somebody said well there ain't no such a thing as the aony then why am I here because I was there this man wasn't there but that inner man was there he was there you know you were too there was a time I didn't know that but when that great light the one I was a part of came and began to open the scriptures I began to see myself in that scripture that's when I realized I was there I can see my reactions literally I can see some of my own reactions reflected in some of those men you know you you're sitting there shaking your head you know exactly what I'm talking about you go my goodness that's exactly what happened to me because the same life that's in you was right in that then to build you a mirror that way you're not identified by a church you're not identified by a teaching right you're identified by Christ am I am a Christian and in the truest sense of the word Levi you are a Christian amen because the spirit of Christ runs through us do you love him this morning Amen brother Ben you got something [Music] I
