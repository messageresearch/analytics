grave nothing like the presence of the Lord there's nothing like the presence nothing like the presence nothing like the presence of the Lord amen amen that's certainly the truth tonight isn't it amen there's just nothing like the presence amen the prophet of God said that he revealed his presence to release their desires to him amen when he Reveals His presence the desire of the church is released in his presence amen amen it's certainly good to be here on the Thursday evening good to see everyone out this evening and amen we we thank the Lord for his Blessing amen upon the word and uh the service Sunday what a what a tremendous time to be in the presence of the Lord amen when he just sweeps through the church and sovereignly begins to deal with hearts and amen you know I don't think we commend uh the church here enough maybe I don't have the ability or the words maybe sometimes to express it and the more I talk the more nervous I get but uh if I don't start preaching I'll get all nervous usually but uh I I know where I'm at and the anointing but if I talk I'm don't tell them what I'll say you but U but we certainly love you all and and uh and what a what a tremendous group of people and I I so I want to commend you on your abilities just to lay aside everything and get in the presence of the Lord and I know a lot of you go through things and you've got situations and and you're working all day and you're coming and businesses and work problems and home situations and sicknesses and but the spirit of the Lord is never hindered you just always come and set aside whatever is happening and get right in the presence of the Lord and it's very commendable to to see a group of people that understand the need of the Holy Spirit to move with liberty and freedom Amen in the church and we certainly love you all and amen uh we certainly thank brother Ben for his his part in that and amen I I told him the other day I've re-evaluated his weight I I think I'm thinking he's up about 1200 lb now it's amen amen his value is uh his value has gotten greater amen we certainly love him appreciate each of you if we could today maybe just bow our hearts in a word of prayer dear Lord we thank you for your mercy tonight for truly Lord you have blessed us beyond measure Lord You've blessed us Lord a lot better than we deserve and father we thank you today that you would give us the grace to Stand Here Lord and know that your mercies is real and father to stand before such a lovely group of people and it is a great honor and a great privilege to serve along with them Lord and father we're asking you that you would bless them tonight and you would take your word and Lord truly we could open the pages of the Bible but Lord there's no way we could open the Revelation so we ask you would come in the building tonight Lord and that may you just pick it up Lord may you put the scripture together in the hearts Lord and may an understanding come of reality and truth and we ask you for it tonight father as we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen and amen and if you have your Bibles tonight we just like to go into the book of Ephesians uh I want to go into Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11 uh I'm going to be reading uh 111 down to verse 14 and um this next uh next half of this chapter is just just amazing this is an amazing book the book of Ephesians of course it's the end time Book of Joshua right so uh you're definitely going to find yourself in this book Amen in Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of the glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession and un the praise of his glory amen you may be seated tonight I'm going to be continuing on this Ephesian series but I'm going to speak a little bit tonight on having obtained an inheritance um I want to read this portion uh out of the Amplified it's just it's just so good in in the 11th verse in him we also were made God's heritage portion we obtained an inheritance for we had been foreordained chosen and appointed beforehand in accordance with his purpose who works out everything in agreement with a counsel and design of his own will I think that's pretty powerful isn't it he works it all out with a counsel and design of his own will so that we who first hoped in Christ who we put our confidence in in him as having been destined and appointed to live for the praise of his glory amen to live for the praise of his glory I like the 14th verse for the spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance it is the first fruits of the Pledge and the foretaste it's the down payment of our heritage in anticipation of its full Redemption and our requiring of a complete possession to the praise of his glory amen this is a this is from the Amplified the original version of the Amplified I actually have one of those older Amplified Bibles they're pretty neat uh it's sometimes and then if you have the uh Interlinear uh the old Greek dial diaglog that brother bam used it's also it's a very good read in the book of Ephesians it has a it has some very good things setting there and showing the appropriation of a certain of a certain portion uh unto a people and then that would be by a predestination or God God's own choosing or his own will amen I I I would like to just take and think about this tonight that we have obtained an inheritance and U and of course speaking here of the bride's portion amen I believe uh that we're looking at a time of course that this is not a natural land but it is a spiritual land and so we're going to rehearse a couple things through here you're going to hear some things you've heard uh but in the book of Ephesians you're Crossing so many many different points that have been made previously uh throughout the message of the hour but the prophet says it like this it's not a natural land it is a spiritual land amen so we realize that the promises that have been given to us is in a spiritual realm the the spiritual promises so we recognize that God can give us something but we're going to have to fight for it amen uh I'll just have to say sometimes we realize this we're going to have to press into these promises they're not always going to come easy it's not always just going to be a cakewalk as we would call it or a flyy bed of ease but we do want to assure you that you are an overcomer amen I don't know if you've thought about it lately but I just want you to know you are the champion you are actually the Overcomer you're the winner in this book when you I I like sometimes if I read a novel I don't read many of them but I like to read the back of the book first and figure out what what kind of book I'm reading and I I I like the The Book of Revelations is one of my favorite books of this scripture and it tells us where everything ends up and I'll tell you this if you read the back of the book you're the winner in this book you have that Revelation that's been setting there before you now of course in in this bride amen she is the Overcomer and been for ordained in the body of Christ she has been spoke about all the way throughout the Old Testament this is something that has been a mystery hid not uncomprehended but it needs to be initiated before you can see the scripture and what it was meaning cuz this this bride has been in him the entire time she was of course the tree that that would David would sing about and say that she's like a tree planted by the water and amen though amen though the tree would be cut down the roots wouldn't be uh uh withered and and she would come again in all of her glory and see he was talking about the church he was talking about something that was going to be coming forth amen the bride of Christ Christ this is what he's talking about in The Book of Revelations in the 21st chapter a city set on a hill coming down out of Heaven and her Jasper walls and her streets of gold and the light is the Lamb itself he's speaking of the Bride see all throughout the scripture that great mystery of the Bride is laying there but it's not until the message of the hour comes and it begins to to lace out where we were and what part spoke to us and I I often uh think about the Book of Joshua it's pretty amazing to me at the Book of Joshua and how that uh in in the Bible when God gives them early on even Bethlehem itself is not really even spoke of until like in the book of numbers and then it just gives a little small scripture there but when Joshua is kneading out all of the land it's not even discussed but it just talks about the land of Judah don't even but but brother Bram said but in the mind of that of God that was laying there in there and waiting for a time to come out and and there Bethlehem would be the place of the Messiah and his birth but it was hid until a certain season until a certain time and then after it was it was manifest then we seen it and and so we recognize that that that the things that we see and the things that we have have belonged to us for a long time things that that that have went unclaimed things that God has given us his promises but yet they they've been ours the whole time amen but just now really recognizing what has belonged to us and what we really should Poss and how we should go into it and I I say this I I I I want to know and and with reality that everything that we are taking as Believers have already been paid for and I I I believe I believe that we have to pay for what we're talking about I I don't believe any of this is free I don't believe amen that that we're just going to skate into it I believe it has to be paid for and I'll say this supreme promises have been made but Supreme sacrifice has been made for them it was a supreme Son of God by a supreme sacrifice that gave us Supreme promises and them have been made for us and I can stand here tonight and plainly declare to this bride City every promise that God has made to this church has already been paid for matter of fact we have the receipt that Jesus said and brother brother man brings us up in my commission he says when he died at Calvary he paid the Supreme price and every Redemptive blessing that he died for at Calvary is already paid before God and the debt is fully paid my goodness amen you are excused before God you've been taken out of the pawn shop and the only thing you have to do is accept and Faith Christ and walk out of that pawn shop and that's all amen I'll tell you this amen it's already been paid for and here's the thing today I know that there are other voices and I know that there are things that you must war in this spiritual world but I will tell you this any spirit that says it's not paid for never come from God any spirit that says to you you cannot possess these things did not come from God Amen but I believe we could rehearse what they said in the Old Testament when Caleb and Joshua were looking at the land and and others were looking at the obstacles and Joshua and Caleb said look amen we are more than able to take this land and I believe we could Echo that same thing here tonight that we are more than able to take this land and somebody said brother Wayne how do you say that in the face of all the issues and all the different oppositions and challenges that we have today well there's this difference between Caleb and Joshua and everybody else amen everybody was looking at the opposition and the challenges but Caleb and Joshua was looking square at the promises of God and they knew the god that made them they knew there was a promise laying there and as long as they kept their eye on the promise that would not be any failure Amen in the Church of the Living God and I'll say this tonight if we'll keep our eye on the promise of God all things are possible to you that believe God has given this church in possession of everything amen all we have to do is possess it and accept it because it's already been paid for when I think of this today the prophet of God said see amen anything anything that's contrary to the word of God Is A Lie anything cont to with the word of God was a lie brother abam said Abraham wasn't afraid to put it to work he said are you the same Faith he gave Abraham he gives it to you freely if you'll use it say I have a gun I like this he says say I have a I got a couple of them guns you know brother said you you just got you a gun brother R said it like this he said say I have a gun he said it'll shoot it's a good true shooting gun if I hang it up on the wall and I say oh sure I got a gun he said what do you do with it see it hangs on the wall that's your faith people say I'm a Christian I believe I can but what do you do about it put it to work turn it loose do something with it get out and Hunt up the devil where he says you're still hurting and you say you're a liar he said pull a bead on him get him in the scope and don't be afraid to pull the trigger cuz it'll go off as sure as anything yes sir he says it'll go off Abraham like God called things which were were not as though they were anything contrary to God's promise was a lie to Abraham anything contrary was a lie I love that ain't you hunt that devil up tonight and call him a liar amen instead of going deer hunting we can go devil hunting tonight hunt that devil up amen and say devil you're a liar and I got a gun here tonight and it's not just a 22 or a little peashooter amen this is an Adam Bomb of thus saith the Lord amen to drop on that devil tonight amen I tell you this the prophet of God said the holy spirit makes you call anything contrary to God's word as though it were not amen I know many times we don't like to tell people they're a liar but the devil is a liar and you got every right to tell him he is tonight amen amen the prophet of God says it like this when you leave everything behind you every care every worry everything that says you can't be a Christian i've smoked too long I've drank too long brother random I've lived in adultery I don't care what you say and what you've done though your sins be a Scarlet you once pass that line of barrier the devil trying to torment you saying you can't do it you can't do it I said I can do it for Jesus said whosoever will let him come drink of the Waters of free amen leave it behind you amen yes you can absolutely we are more than able to take the land and the possessions of it amen I don't know amen I don't have to make you a chance ion you already are a champion I don't have to make you a winner you already are I don't have to amen pep you up and talk you into winning this God has already anointed you and already put you in the back of this Bible as the winner of this race and I say this tonight we ought to just lift up our eyes and press on to the mark of the High Calling that's in Christ Jesus forgetting things that are behind us to move on amen amen amen the prophet of God said the Holy Spirit would never make you do anything contrary to the scripture the the spirit would never make you God's spirit would never make you amen deny one of these promises amen it would never be the spirit of God in Romans 3 and: three it said what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the fa Faith Of God without effect God forbid yay let God be true and every man a liar as it is written thou mightest be justified in thy s and thou might have overcome when thou art judged Amen in Romans 4:17 for I have made thee the father of many nations and before him he believed even God that quickeneth the dead and calleth things which were not as though they were now that wasn't actually Abraham that was actually God that did that and brother randam attributes it to Abraham right right one time I thought well maybe brother BR didn't realize that the scripture was saying that God did that but then I got to reading one day and he most certainly did amen but what happened is Abraham so much was like God and he repeated it the way God repeated it he confessed it the way God confessed it and I believe tonight that we can speak it just like God speaks it amen I believe we can I believe we can tell the devil tonight amen you are of the Father the devil and his lust of your fathers will he do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there was no truth in him and when he speaketh a lie he speaketh his own for he is a liar and the father of it amen you Sur preacher what are you doing the prophets is trying to show us something our approach to our inheritance now amen what what are we looking at brother R said he was he was at that uh stomach problem for years you remember it and he said he went and got prayer and he said they told him if you eat solid food you're going to die he said I went home after prayer and told Mom to put me up a bowl of beans and a big onion I tell you what he knew how to eat didn't he hey amen get me a bowl of beans and onion amen I a big chunk of cornbread I tell you what that's that's home right there amen amen so we we I'm getting hungry amen but but the prophet said he ate that and he said as he was eating it he said the devil was telling him he was going to die he said the the bean started coming up and he was pressing them back down amen you remember that he said they just started burping up he said I started putting them back down singing I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe now that's see that's simple but it'll stick to the ribs folks amen that that that was uh what he explained how he was overcoming the greatest uh problem in his life brother BR always had that stomach problem it was always there amen and and it wasn't like brother Greg he had to overcome it that one time brother random had to overcome that his whole life amen he had to push it back his whole life amen but he said God's word said it I healed amen and I stood that I won't get into it brother Ronnie amen but but God's word said I'm healed amen and so he stood right there on it and and he walked out and somebody said how you feeling brother Bill and he said well I'm feeling just fine they said well ain't you lying he said no sir I'm not lying I'm confessing the word of God Amen I'll tell you what confess means to me the same thing as sometimes you have to pick up the promise of God and beat the devil back with it so you can conf Fess you're healing and if it wasn't for the word of God you couldn't do it because you don't feel healed you don't think you're healed amen you you're not feeling well at all but the word of God gives you the opportunity to stand in a place of healing when you don't feel like you're healed amen but you can deny every sense and confess the word of God and hold the promises of God over that brother B said upon such a word I wonder tonight if our listeners how can we be so petty and so dilatory about reaching out and taking a hold of the promises of God when he gave his blessed promise to his church I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age and then we set along as if God never said it but whatever you bind in the earth I bind it in heaven whatever you loose in the earth I'll loose it in heaven whether it's sickness whether it's disease whe ever it is God blessed promised it's our privilege to pick up this promise and use it I say glory to God I got a privilege tonight to pick up this Bible and use it in the face of opposition I can tell you you're a champion already Amen in the face of the greatest problems of your life I can say just hold on just a little while because you're the Overcomer brother I know how it's going to End Amen the Church of the Living God is going to come out in Victory amen you ain't going to lose this battle amen I'll tell you one thing amen if we can just get through it's going to be okay the preacher you seem awful awful determined in that point well I'll tell you the reason being cuz my Bible said amen that all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose and I'll tell you this tonight the devil don't have enough Devils hell don't have enough Angels Amen to defeat the Church of the Living God we have been anointed for the challenge of this age God has sent forth the spirit of his son upon the church to manifest his promises in this age and it's our privilege tonight to pick this promise up and use it and you imagine tonight we got a right to use it I I like that personally because you know in uh as a minister you all you all know sometimes uh maybe some of you mothers understand that you get you get in a situation where your baby sick or something like that and you really don't know how to handle it but you got a privilege to pick up the promise you got a privilege to pick that promise up and use it now here's the thing according to the prophet we got a we got a privilege to do it now when you start looking at this inheritance of course the church has been giving this in this age now when we go back and we look in the Book of Revelations the 10th chapter what we see in Revelations 10 is we see an open book in the hand of the angel coming down from heaven that book you're seeing in Revelations 10 open is the book that was was closed in Revelations 5 in Revelations 5 John was instructed that nobody could even touch or look at that book but in Revelations the 10th chapter John was being commanded to come and take the book and not only look but to eat the book so through Revelations 5 to Revelations 10 something had taken place that had opened access to the promise that they could receive this now watch in Revelation 6 and verse one the Bible says and the land stood there and opened the book with the first seal being and brother B said there he stands tonight with the book open now the possession of that book now this is a very powerful area and you you might want to put this one on your refrigerator in the breach brother RMA say this it's the Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve what it ought to do to a born again Christian it's legal possession of that book its legal possession to the abstract deed to the title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost what of it Brethren amen they had possession of that deed amen it means we have everything that Adam lost now it would be it would be maybe our thought to think well it's always been that way but it hasn't always been that way in Revelations 5 they couldn't touch it Revelations 10 he's invited to take it what is the separating point the lamb took the book and descended to the seventh angel on the earth Amen in in the Book of Revelations the seventh angel was that key piece amen between not getting the book and being able to eat the book that's just very simple but God sets times and God is the one that sets Seasons I'll say this from the believer's position 1955 brother bam says God's word belongs in our life and God sets times and time limits and it all works to that time youall believe God sets the times sure amen and you you if you was with us on Sunday we're preaching on the mystery of his will right and we were looking at that the word brings the will of God now listen to this part of this quote he said you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it you got to find the will of God and the time of God to do it that was what was wrong with Moses amen Moses amen understood that he was a deliverer but he got the wrong timing and he wasn't able to do it now he knew it was the will of God but he was out of time with it and he didn't know that God was in it at that moment he kills one man banished to the back side of the desert for 40 years amen so but what he done is of course he loses amen the side of Freedom he loses this and brother B said he had lost the idea of freedom he said but God met him one day in a burning bush and when God's season came along just exactly he revealed his plan to Moses I love this and the reason Moses had forgot about the freedom because God promised he would have it but God hadn't forgot the promise and Moses tried in himself and failed that's what the church has done many times tried in ourselves and we fail in God's element of time he says it like this amen we find out God God works everything seasonally and Moses when he had failed to find the time limit of God you see if you get ahead of God you get behind God but you want to be right in the season of God God has a season for your life he has a season for this church he has a season for his word now we're experiencing one of the greatest Seasons we've ever had as a church amen amen I know we've been here 10 years myself and and and we're and we're looking at a great season amen of a liberty and a and a Grace and a mercy that is falling on the church and brother Ray and I look at each other once in a while and we say man just hold steady amen cuz I I I know the devil don't like the way things are so he's going to be doing everything he can but but you better you better remember this enjoy the seasons that are here don't be sitting there thinking about what it used to be some some other time in the past of our of our history as a church or or you're looking out in the future thinking when we get our new church and when all this goes we're going to have all great times and all that don't miss the season that you're in don't miss the greatest moments in the in the history of your life the the season that God is manifesting in this hour do you see what it was when Moses got into the front of that Burning Bush brother man said it was a direct revelation of the whe and the timing of God and when you see the whe and the timing of God brother I'll tell you what it's ready it's ready for God to pour something out upon the Church of the Living God a fresh Revival a fresh Revelation a fresh vision of the word of God for your life we are in the appointed time and season today listen for thousands of years man have looked for this season Daniel said it would be in the time of the end Revelations 10 said it would be in the time of the end brothers sisters amen tell somebody we have arrived we are at the end amen amen if the church is going to enjoy the Revival of God this is the season to enjoy the revivals of God this is not for another generation come on sometime we have to accept that we are the people this is the season this is the day this is the hour come on I know you'd like to put it off on Moses but Moses ain't here tonight and I know you'd like to say well and Joshua Joshua ain't here tonight may I say this David did his job good and Paul did his job good and irius did his job good brother brandom did his job good but this is your season this is your hour The Paton has been placed in your hand I say the hour has come for the Church of the Living God to manifest these realities now you got to realize the specific day we're living was spoke of in scripture yes sir that's right in Revelations 10 and Daniel 12 Matthew 24 Luke 17:30 John 14:20 at that day what day is that when the Revelation made known at that day that's that's this day isn't it beautiful the day when the son of man is revealed is the same day that day ye shall know Amen Let just somebody put a buzzer sign out and say God wants you to know what has been hid from other ages God wants you to know Amen in Genesis 21 God told Sarah that there would be a time that the Lord had set an appointed time in Psalms 102 David talks about God setting an appointed time in Ecclesiastes chapter three to everything there is a season and there is a purpose under heaven timing is everything and to recognize the burning bush announc the timing and the will of God and to to rec to see this tonight that the message of the hour has told you your message and your season and your time and your hour and where you're sitting tonight that's right Amen to work into that season I could say with the prophets many men have lost longed to see this day and they did not and many eyes have longed to see this and have not and many ears have longed to hear this and have not but blessed are your eyes and blessed are your ears for your season has arrived praise the Lord when I look at this tonight in Revelation chapter 10 and verse 7 I know you're a Revelations 10 church amen in the seventh verse the Bible says when the trumpet call of the seventh angel is beginning to sound the mystery of God and I love how it says this in the Amplified that is the hidden purpose and plan is finished the mystery of God is finished see the spirit of the Lord opened that which had been hidden that's right that which had been mystery you are now been initiated but it was the spirit of the Lord that did it the same as it did it with Moses in the burning bush that same Pillar of Fire has announced this season and open the door for the church to move into the revelation of Christ in Luke chapter 4 it was Jesus that announced it in the 18th verse the spirit of the Lord is upon me what because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor see Jesus picked the scripture for the season he was living and said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach this acceptable year of the Lord amen amen and then he closed the book and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now now just in uh just in uh how could I say this just in just a free spot for you that study the message I think it's a powerful season because Jesus changed something here if you're a studier of the Old Testament the laws of Jubilee they were always sounded by trumpet right uh they on the 50th year they'd take a trumpet and and the priest would go out and sound a Ram's Horn and he see they made the atonement at the at the temple they made the atonement at the camp but the priest would sound the trumpet in other areas announcing the atonement is made so you didn't see the atonement you actually heard it right amen the the sound was saying the atonement is here Jesus changed that from the sounding of a natural horn to the preaching of the gospel and he moved it saying the spirit of the Lord is upon me to declare to announce to Proclaim to Harold by the speaking of the voice the acceptable year of the Lord Has Come of course the Year of Jubilee struck in the 10th month and the seventh day the Year of Jubilee was a return to the will of God Amen if you watch Israel and when they went into their promised lands that land had been given to them and it was a perfect will of God for them to be in that land they spent 400 years in permissive wheel down there in Egypt but when the pillar of fire came it come to lead them to the perfect will of God for their lives and it was that fire that led them in their Promised Land it was a pillar of fire that returned and brought them into that land now here's the thing God knew that once they got in that land they were still humans and they would still be debts and there would still be problems you know the law of Jubilee and if they got in trouble they would sell out and maybe somebody would be go into slavery and something would happen or whatever but whenever they got out of that position when they got when when Gad got over somewhere in Judah or Judah got somewhere over somewhere amen when that happened amen that that would sound and when the sounding of that trumpet it would tell them it's time to return to the will of God The Inheritance that was given them was given to them by the will of God it was not theirs it was God that gave it to them do you see it was God Amen that had gave them their spiritual herriage amen and they were heir to everything that God said they could have I say this tonight that the Church of the Living God is heir to all things and it's been given to me I'm an heir see there's an inheritance and then there's an heir what the inheritance is is one thing but we're the heir of that inheritance and I can claim every everything that God promised to me there you are it's mine how do you get it something you done no sir it's an unmar gift that God gave us and it's ours and it belongs to us and Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in scriptural authoritative word my goodness H that's powerful ain't it if you go to the devil in scriptural authoritative word and lay it down say Satan it's mine lay it down my goodness when's the last time you really challenge Satan like that it belongs to me Satan lay it down amen now Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11 for we obtain an inheritance obtaining an inheritance a an inheritance here in this specific scripture is the word claros k l e r o o it's it's a different word Greek word than most all the other words of inheritance in the New Testament this word actually deals with that it's talking about an assignment of an allotment it's it's talking about a possession that has been gained by the casting of Lots now if you're a study of the Old Testament you realize that the prophets would use Lots in the Old Testament amen and how that they would cast lots and the Lots would fall and then the inheritance according to the lot would fall on a certain tribe when God made the promise through Abraham through the Genesis 30 through their mothers Here Comes Joshua under inspiration and Joshua is going to place them in that land but the scripture tells us in Joshua 18 that Joshua said to the children of how long will you slack and go to possess this land which God has given unto us and he took out and they would cast lots and they would say this part belongs to you and this part belongs to you and this part belongs to you see it took out all the politics it took all of the man out of it amen and when those lots would fall upon them th that's what belonged to them it was their inheritance that God gave them and they could obtain it now here's the beauty of this to me that the prophet would speak about this and he would say that word inheritance he said oh God he says see here it is we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something before for the foundation of the world he left you something a name written on a book that when the lamb would be slain you would be recognized with it isn't that powerful he left you an inheritance you say way what is my inheritance your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life brother mam said in the church a book that there are names that is on the Lamb's Book of Life that cannot be removed nor can sin be added to those names and we must accept that I said oh my goodness and we must accept that amen I said Lord I accept that amen it is my inheritance I accept the word concerning my life amen you said well preacher if I have this inheritance how do I get into it brother man said how do we get into this inheritance he said we walked right up into it he said see do we get into this heritance how do we get there because we're predestinated yes amen listen inheritance by predestination it's powerful to me brother B said my now my Armenian Brothers he said I know that's going to be awfully hard for you he said you're not going to see it he said but that's all right he says it's so good to look at he said maybe we could just get a step ladder and climb up and start looking at the promises amen that God gave us amen you you see amen he gave us by pre predestination Romans the 8th chapter the scripture says Amen in whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he justified and them he also glorified amen watch this in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what is it it's inheritance by predestination amen I inherited something what is my inheritance there somebody had to leave me an inheritance Jesus left you oh beg my pardon he didn't leave you in inheritance he paid for your inheritance brought down your inheritance your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first isn't that powerful tonight amen Jesus was sent to save those who had already been chosen didn't Paul say five verses behind this that he had already chosen Us in him and that's our inheritance that God could choose and Let Jesus come and pay the price what the shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing that you do my goodness brother what is it it's a total price that's been paid there's where the sin question was settled before God's requirements were made the total price was paid at Calvary and from all the Redemptive blessings that Jesus did for every one of our personal property you Believers the only thing you have to do is just believe it accept it and call it yours it's already already been paid for hallelujah it's already been paid for by Stripes you are healed it's been paid for he was wounded for our transgressions it's paid for he was bruised for our iniquity

the sick no more put footprints on it amen start walking down the land and if you run into a giant don't worry you're anointed to fight with giants because God has anointed you in this season in this hour he died the death at the cross that you might have a Redemptive right amen that he died for you're just afraid to possess it you're afraid to claim it isn't that amazing afraid to claim it well I

brother Jesus did that when he died Jesus come to purchase that inheritance for me amen isn't that powerful it's etern it's inheritance you say I have an inheritance it's an inheritance of eternal life God sent Jesus to make this inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inheritant I was blank it was valid there's nothing I could do but in the fullness of time God sent his own good time Jesus the lamb he slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what the inheritance sunship my goodness inheritance is what sunship to be a Son of God isn't that powerful tonight amen to be a Son of God that is is your inheritance tonight to be sons of God and sons of God are led by the spirit of God and if we're air were joint HS

promise that was made to the Church of the Living God my goodness it is written in the word that you are God God Gave You Dominion when he made you he made you a Son of God when he made Adam he made him to rule the Earth but Adam forgot who he was sin entered in and Adam forgot how to rule he forgot how to tell the wind he forgot how to speak to the tree he forgot how to speak to the mountain but the Bible said I shall restore sayeth the Lord and I'll give you not the spirit of fear but the spirit of adoption whereby you might cry Abby father memory is coming back to the church we're going to remember what it was like to speak to the storms Amen to speak to the mountain to speak to the trees amen our spiritual Amnesia is over God has sent a message to restore us back to our inheritance in this AG Proclaim it declare it tell it preach it shake the house with it the Church of the Living God can possess these promises yes and amen absolutely he forgot how to do it but the memory the spirit of God said when the Holy Ghost comes he will remind you of these promises hallelujah hallelujah see Moses had forgot God hadn't forgot you forgot God didn't forget Adam forgot God didn't forget come on Amen we got a bunch of we got a bunch of Israelites returning to their homelands and they're going to go back in tribal order yes they are they're going back in tribal order but two of them tribes won't be in the order because they had sinned back there before the blood and God remembered what they did but he also remember their order is that right amen but you watch this but to the church of the Living God Amen there is another memory amen that has come which is the word of God that has restored the Church back in its tribal order back in the order of the Bride amen right in step with every word of it right in Step amen I saw her walking didn't he say he did didn't he say he saw you walking in the Rhythm didn't he say he saw all those other Brides fall off left and right he said but that original Bride come back again and I say to you tonight I believe I'm looking at a part of the original acts book of bride church I shall restore sayth the lord it's an 11th Hour people the spoken word has restored the memory of the church The Possession and The Inheritance that was before the world ever began that's what the seven seal is about it's not about theology it's not about Doctrine it's about inheritance it's about sunship it's about adoption it's about who we were before we were here but brother we're getting ready to go back if this old body ever lets go there's a [Applause] soul I know this body needs redeemed but this Soul's already redeemed Hallelujah one day these old bars of clay these old bars of bone that hold this Soul they ain't going to be able to hold it always no sir may choke you to death but we're sons of God May choke us to death but the logos has put another portion on the earth and it's in the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ verily I say unto you if thou say unto the mountain be moved it shall be cast into the sea hallelujah it's not just a f of imagination this is not a Disney book this is not a fantasy this is a reality of the sons of God coming under the blood spirit of God to return back to every inheritance that God had gave them I say unto you Jesus said I say unto you may I say I say unto you if you shall say under this mountain this whole earth has been groaning for the manifestation of sons true Sons born Sons when they begin to speak the word becomes back I believe we're on the road of it tonight the prophet said hey he says it like this this is the day of the manifestation of sons see you got to find the season you got to find the timing you got to find the will of God so what does the will of God mean it's everything the will of God's everything CU everything works to his purpose and to his will try to stop the will of God you'll never do it try to keep it from happening you'll never do it because when the will of God sets an action it's going to fulfill exactly what God has prophesied this is the day of the manifestation this is the hour of the Fulfillment of the scripture you'll never stop it from happening it just ain't possible you'll never you'll never never stop it the prophet of God said there's going to come a true genuine and anointed Holy Ghost God called church that when they speak the word it'll flash like lightning brother brother brother in spiritual Amnesia brother Ram said we got to be identified with John 14:12 The Works that I do shall he do also don't forget it if you do you got spiritual amnesia yeah see they forgot they were Gods isn't that crazy they forgot they were gods they forgot their position with God say well it ain't possible King did it one time yeah a king did it a king went out and ate grass with a beast cuz he forgot he was a king yeah he had all authority as a king but he forgot he was a king he lost it as a beast but wasn't it seven years I think my my my memory is going preaching on memory and I'm losing my memory believe it's seven years and look what at least seven Frost or seven does but you see what happens is he comes back to the to the kingship see people forget they forget who they are they forget their Christian balance they forget what God really made them do you see what the prophet of God said he's telling us that deity will be restored at the end time that deity actually is not in heaven amen that deity is in you do you know the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb it's a believer in contact with his maker Hallelujah now if you know the will of God Paul Moses when he saw the will of God here's brother Ram saying this is the day of the manifestation it was the burning bush Pillar of Fire setting the day the time the season and the will of God and when he did this it's amazing to me because when you read the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter he said by Faith said what is Faith he said it's a revelation of the will of God and by faith Rahab and by the will of God Moses and by the will of God Abraham and by the will of God Samson and by the will of God and here is a continuation of the book of Hebrews when the heroes didn't end in the book of Hebrews but so are some of you tonight and by faith you shall overcome I'll say this to you tonight I'll say that you know some hindrances but your faith don't know any the gates of hell are against you Jesus said they would be but he also said we would Prevail that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you you see they will be against you amen but they won't they won't Prevail against you the gates of hell now watch when you when you see this it actually brings a reality that when God sets a promise in front of a Believer and they know they're going after a promise made to them by the Lord there is no stopping that believer there will be no stopping that believer when you see that your inheritance is sunship and that it was predestinated of the Lord that it was paid for by the blood of Jesus that your name was put in the Lamb's Book and this message has come to Proclaim declare to shout aloud to you that you're are returning to your sunship there'll be no stopping that one amen be like a house of fire on a windy day be no stopping that because they go straight into action can our music players come tonight there'll be no stopping that that's right there'll be none I've got a section here on purpose I better not get into it I'll be an hour when you see it's the plan you see it's the purpose see inheritance yes sir is purpose nothing can destroy destroy the purpose of God is't that amazing when you see his will there's no wind that can blow out the fire there's no Beast that can eat the believer there's no there's no water that can drown her there's no fire that can burn her there's no death that can destroy her there's no devil that can stop her because it's our inheritance so brother Levi there's a season of sending and God sends a message it's a sending it's a sending there's a season for God has sent forth God has sent forth the spirit it's a season of sending but we are in the season of receiving thank you Jesus we're here receiving amen we're receiving the benefits of what God has done in this age do you love him tonight won't you stand to your feet with us thank you Lord
