[3:42] our hearts in a word of prayer before we
[3:44] read the scripture this morning amen we
[3:47] just like to approach the Lord Heavenly
[3:49] Father Lord there's one thing that we've
[3:52] understood Through The Years Lord that
[3:55] no man can open the scripture and no man
[3:58] can make it bring an understanding but
[4:01] you're God and Lord you you're a
[4:04] merciful god to open our understanding
[4:07] to bring an Enlightenment Lord and we

[4:17] of wisdom and Revelation Lord may it

[4:37] which they were written father we ask
[4:39] you now to lead us in your word in Jesus
[4:42] name we pray amen and amen and God bless
[4:46] you if you have your Bible to the Book
[4:48] of Daniel uh the 9th
[4:52] chapter I want to look this morning
[4:54] Daniel chapter 9 we're going to look in
[4:56] the first two verses um I was actually
[5:00] been praying about how to continue in
[5:02] This Book of Daniel if we would continue
[5:04] further or what but I I felt to at least
[5:07] to to bring this last portion here
[5:10] there's um three tapes brother bandam
[5:12] preaches in Daniel chapter n uh he'll
[5:15] preach on Gabriel's instructions to
[5:18] Daniel six-fold purpose of Gabriel's
[5:21] visit to Daniel and also Daniel's 70th
[5:24] week all King from Daniel chapter 9 so
[5:27] there's actually a lot of information
[5:29] that's in that chapter and um and I want
[5:32] to Maybe cover a little bit of it this
[5:34] morning with you um but in in uh in
[5:37] saying that let's go to Daniel 9 And1
[5:40] and we'll read here uh the first two
[5:42] verses and let you be seated for in the
[5:44] first year of Darius the son of aerus of
[5:47] the seed of the mes and which was the
[5:49] king over the realm of the Chans in the
[5:52] first year of his Reign I
[5:55] Daniel understood by books the number of
[5:58] years where of the word of the Lord came
[6:01] to Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[6:03] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[6:07] of Jerusalem God bless you as you could
[6:09] be seated this morning and I want to
[6:12] speak here on uh Daniel chapter 9 and I
[6:15] want to maybe just speak to you a little
[6:17] bit from here on the
[6:19] understanding of Daniel from the
[6:22] angel and I uh reading this portion of
[6:27] scripture we're looking at something I
[6:29] think that is very powerful uh here that
[6:32] Daniel and uh brother Bram speaks of it
[6:35] quite often in the three tapes that I
[6:37] just mentioned if you want to go listen
[6:39] to them they're very powerful very
[6:41] powerful uh tapes and there's a lot
[6:43] there's a lot in them tapes and I'm sure
[6:46] that you'll be quite blessed with them
[6:48] um but I say that this morning and uh
[6:51] and want to maybe quote brother brandham
[6:54] concerning Gabriel's instructions to
[6:56] Daniels something that he brought
[6:58] concerning it is he said I would like to
[7:00] do this he said uh God knows my heart
[7:03] and he's listening to me he said' but I
[7:05] wanted that I might Enlighten his people
[7:09] and he was actually studying The Book of
[7:10] Daniel the 9th chapter and he said I
[7:12] want to do this but I want to do it so I
[7:14] can Enlighten the people uh that was the
[7:17] reason the prophet approached it he said
[7:18] and I believe he will give it to me and
[7:21] I do not know as yet but I'm trusting
[7:23] for next Sunday amen that he will give
[7:26] us that and then again in Gabriel's
[7:28] instruction he said his wife was
[7:30] actually asking him he said how do you
[7:32] expect our people which are poor people
[7:34] and many of them uneducated like we are
[7:36] to understand such things as that and
[7:39] brother Ram said I said God will give
[7:41] the answer and no matter how complicated
[7:44] it is God can break it down and make it
[7:46] simple for we are the portion of the
[7:49] people who are longing and praying for
[7:51] that day and hour and our eyes are set
[7:53] towards heaven waiting for his coming I
[7:56] think it's pretty powerful when brother
[7:58] brandom approach such things as an
[7:59] uneducated man and he was speaking to
[8:02] uneducated people of course he's talking
[8:04] about biblically uh not having any
[8:06] schooling in that manner but he said God
[8:08] could give an answer that could make it
[8:09] simple amen and I I I I thank God that
[8:13] we've had a prophet in this generation
[8:15] that can take things that seem so uh
[8:17] complicated and make it so simple that
[8:20] we could understand it you know uh he he
[8:22] spoke language that we could understand
[8:24] such as brother Brandon would take one
[8:26] of the greatest Mysteries that you ever
[8:27] heard in your life and he would would
[8:29] say the seed is not air with a shook
[8:32] amen and he would just make it so simple
[8:33] now there's others that came behind him
[8:35] and took the Simplicity and complicated
[8:38] it and put some confusion to it to maybe
[8:40] make it sound a little better amen but I
[8:43] I just appreciate the way God brought it
[8:45] in our generation to make it an
[8:47] understandable thing for our age in our
[8:49] season now the scriptures are telling
[8:52] here that Daniel living in the time of
[8:54] the changing and uh he was changing
[8:57] actually from the Babylonian Kingdom
[9:00] and he was going to be living in the
[9:01] same city of Babylon but the government
[9:03] had changed to the mes and Persians
[9:04] which we covered uh when we were talking
[9:06] about the handwriting on the wall and so
[9:08] he was living at the time of the change
[9:10] of the dispensation of the governments
[9:13] and by doing so he realized that
[9:16] something was written in scripture in
[9:18] Jeremiah concerning the season that he
[9:20] was living and he was believing that it
[9:22] was a time of Deliverance for the church
[9:25] he he was believing that and and of
[9:27] course the scripture said I understood
[9:29] by the books the number of years
[9:31] therefore the word of the Lord came to
[9:32] Jeremiah the prophet So Daniel was
[9:35] understanding by the books that
[9:36] something was about to happen in his
[9:39] season of time mother brandom actually
[9:42] tells us of how uh that he was he was
[9:44] reading these books and he said it done
[9:46] something to Daniel of course what it
[9:48] did is it made him desperate and I and I
[9:50] think that this is a very powerful area
[9:53] because a lot of people preach on
[9:54] desperation in the end time most people
[9:56] always put desperation to tribulation
[9:59] and they always make it sound like the
[10:00] only time the church will ever receive
[10:02] Revelation desperate uh because of the
[10:05] tribulations that come upon them but
[10:07] here is an exact example that a man
[10:10] seeing the scriptures through him in
[10:12] desperation in other words desperation
[10:14] can come one of two ways it can come
[10:16] through tribulation and again it comes
[10:18] through Revelation and I pray that God
[10:20] would give us a revelation that would
[10:22] make our hearts desperate to understand
[10:24] the season and the time that we're
[10:26] living because that we have been reading
[10:29] the scripture and seeing the time the
[10:31] season that we're living aligns with
[10:33] what the prophets have said concerning
[10:36] our generation now it said here uh uh
[10:39] the prophet will say it very clearly he
[10:41] said now Daniel was there and I think
[10:42] it's amazing he said he was an alien he
[10:45] had been ousted from his people from his
[10:47] church he says without one church
[10:49] service without any church to go to
[10:51] without any hymns to be saying he said
[10:54] what he's saying to himself in the midst
[10:55] of all this still he held on to what the
[10:58] prophet said amen no church to go to
[11:01] nobody to fellowship with everybody went
[11:04] to Heathen temples everybody worshiped
[11:06] their Idols no chrisan songs nobody
[11:08] believed the same thing he did and yet
[11:10] 68 years from a young man of about 12 or
[11:14] 14 year old he was taken down there and
[11:16] he held true to God and understood by
[11:19] Jeremiah's books he said the prophets
[11:22] that were that were uh almost
[11:24] accomplished and how that that would
[11:26] warn the heart of any true prophet of
[11:28] God today
[11:30] that we look back and see this true
[11:32] Prophet said and know that we're at the
[11:34] end time he said I understood by the
[11:37] books of Jeremiah my brother amen now
[11:39] brother R is saying look at this man
[11:41] living in the time he was living without
[11:44] any church to go to without any
[11:46] Fellowship without other people without
[11:48] someone to to encourage him he didn't
[11:51] have those people who were praying for
[11:53] him and this but this man held
[11:54] victorious in that kind of situation
[11:57] amen and he only had the books of
[11:59] Jeremiah to do so and I I think it's
[12:02] pretty powerful Amen brother br will
[12:04] actually preach a message to us called
[12:06] why some people can't keep the Victory
[12:08] and I thought it was powerful that this
[12:10] man was keeping a victory in that kind
[12:13] of circumstance and that kind of season
[12:15] and how it ought to be an encouragement
[12:17] to every believer today that we should
[12:19] be able to keep a victory in the age
[12:22] that we're living in amen with our
[12:24] churches and with our assemblies and our
[12:27] songs and our encouragement our weekly
[12:30] uh uh coming to the house of God how
[12:32] that it would be a blessing now of
[12:34] course it was Jeremiah the 25th chapter
[12:36] that Daniel was reading can we just go
[12:39] there Jeremiah chapter 25 and let's just
[12:41] read the eth to down to the 14th verse
[12:44] now Jeremiah was a prophet prophesied
[12:46] before Daniel and before the children
[12:49] had come into this now uh therefore thus
[12:51] saith the Lord host because you have not
[12:54] heard back up one of the eighth verse
[12:57] there thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[12:58] because you have not heard my words amen
[13:02] the next then the ninth uh behold I will
[13:05] send and take of the families of the
[13:06] north sayith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar
[13:08] the king of Babylon my servant and will
[13:10] bring them against this land against the
[13:12] inhabitants thereof and against all
[13:14] these nations around about and utterly
[13:16] destroy them and make them an
[13:18] astonishment and a hissing and a
[13:20] Perpetual
[13:22] desolations moreover I will take from
[13:24] them the voice of birth and the voice of
[13:26] gladness and the voice of the bridegroom
[13:28] the voice of the Bride the sound of the
[13:29] milestones and the light of the
[13:32] candle and this whole land shall be a
[13:35] desolation and an astonishment and these
[13:38] nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon
[13:41] 70
[13:43] years amen and it shall come to pass
[13:46] when 70 years are accomplished that I
[13:48] will punish the king of Babylon and the
[13:50] nation saith the Lord for their iniquity
[13:52] and the land of the Chans will make it a
[13:55] Perpetual desolations now here we're
[13:58] reading a of a prophet who's prophesying
[14:01] against his own Nation but he's giving
[14:03] it a number of years amen uh and it
[14:06] shall come to pass when 70 years I will
[14:09] bring up on this uh the 13th verse sorry
[14:13] amen and I will bring upon the land of
[14:15] all my words which I have pronounced
[14:17] against it and that is written in this
[14:18] book The jeremi had prophesied against
[14:20] these
[14:21] nations and for Many Nations and great
[14:24] Kings Shall Serve themselves of them
[14:26] also and I will recompense them
[14:27] according to their deeds and according
[14:29] to the works of their own hands now
[14:32] brother Braham is beautifully telling us
[14:34] that Daniel is reading the exact words
[14:37] that I just read you he was just a young
[14:41] boy when he went into Babylon and they
[14:43] went in with this prophecy So Daniel
[14:45] would have sat around and read those
[14:48] prophecies the same as you read the
[14:50] Bible you read the same very words that
[14:53] he read now I think this is powerful for
[14:56] for what I'm what I'm thinking of is how
[14:59] that God was able to put words on a page
[15:03] and they so affected this young man that
[15:05] he kept a victory in the middle of
[15:07] Babylon that he kept his he kept his
[15:10] stature he kept his loyalty he kept his
[15:13] grace to God and that's what he was
[15:15] reading that had that much effect upon
[15:18] him you you think of that he he begins
[15:20] to approach 70 years can we again let's
[15:22] read again Jeremiah chap 29 same Prophet
[15:26] Jeremiah 29: 4-14 amen Jeremiah 29 uh
[15:31] veres
[15:32] 4-4 thus sayith the Lord of hosts the
[15:34] god of Israel unto all that are carried
[15:36] away captives and whom I am caused to be
[15:38] carried away from Jerusalem under
[15:40] Babylon now they're already being
[15:41] carried into Babylon now and he's
[15:43] addressing them while they're there
[15:45] build ye houses and dwell in them and
[15:47] plant Gardens and eat the fruit of them
[15:50] and take your wives and beget you sons
[15:52] and daughters and take wives for Sons
[15:54] for give your daughters to your husbands
[15:56] that they may bear sons and daughters
[15:58] that you may increased there and not
[16:02] diminished and seek the peace of the
[16:04] city where I caused you to be carried
[16:06] away captive and pray unto the Lord for
[16:08] it for in the peace thereof you shall
[16:10] have peace amen for thus saith the Lord
[16:13] of hosts the god of Israel let not the
[16:15] prophets and diviners be in the midst of
[16:18] you deceive you neither hearken to you
[16:20] with dreams which you shall cause to be
[16:23] dreamed for thus they prophesy falsely
[16:27] unto you in my name I have have not sent
[16:29] them saith the
[16:31] Lord for thus sayith the Lord therea 70
[16:34] years be accomplished in Babylon I will
[16:36] visit thee and perform my good word
[16:39] toward thee and causing you to return to
[16:41] this place hold it right there think of
[16:43] this now here is a prophet who has
[16:45] prophesied before they ever went you're
[16:47] going for 70 years now amen in that
[16:50] season of Jeremiah preached I think 23
[16:53] years he preached that sermon to them
[16:55] you're going to Babylon for 2 for 70
[16:57] years and in the middle of prophesying
[17:00] that there was another Prophet that came
[17:02] up and broke the the the iron or broke
[17:05] the oxen remember he broke the the Yoke
[17:07] of wood off of the neck of his and then
[17:10] and then he told him that God's going to
[17:12] deliver them and they don't have to go
[17:14] to Babylon it's not going to be that way
[17:16] and then Jeremiah prophesied to him he
[17:19] said you've taken the wooden Yol and
[17:20] you've made it an iron yolk and he said
[17:23] thus sayeth the Lord you're not going to
[17:24] live out the rest of this year amen and
[17:27] Babylon will take possession of Israel
[17:29] and it'll be there 70 years now they're
[17:31] in Babylon and there's prophets still
[17:34] prophesying you you don't don't don't
[17:35] build your houses don't get married
[17:37] don't don't establish yourself make war
[17:40] here in Babylon and while they're there
[17:42] he's sending them letters in their
[17:43] captivity saying you're going to be
[17:45] there 70 years pray for the Peace of
[17:47] Babylon and build houses and marry and
[17:50] and he's instructing them amen because
[17:52] he's not Desiring them to believe the
[17:55] wrong thing but establish yourself
[17:57] because God's not going to hear hear a
[17:59] prayer of Deliverance for 70 years look
[18:02] look now this has been solidly drilled
[18:05] into Israel by now this Prophet Jeremiah
[18:08] again and again and again 70 years and
[18:10] then he said I will hear your prayer
[18:13] look at the next verse the 11th verse
[18:15] for I know the thoughts that I think
[18:17] towards you sayith the Lord and their
[18:19] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[18:21] give you an expected in I know that's a
[18:23] famous verse that's been made famous in
[18:25] the last days but here's a prophet
[18:28] saying that I know the thoughts that I
[18:30] have toward you God already knew the
[18:32] thoughts of Israel when they went to
[18:34] Babylon and his thought of them was
[18:37] you're going to be there 70 years but at
[18:39] the end of 70 years I'm going to bring a
[18:41] Deliverance to the church amen and that
[18:44] Deliverance will come in its season and
[18:46] that 70 years will be the marking of
[18:49] that season I think it's powerful to
[18:51] know that God sets a season of
[18:53] Deliverance he sets a season amen that
[18:56] that that you can live in something for
[18:58] 70 years but as soon as the time piece
[19:02] of the prophecy of God clicks on its
[19:04] right date and right hour there is not
[19:07] enough Devils or enough uh Babylonians
[19:10] or enough Persians or mes to keep these
[19:12] prophecies from Rolling forward now
[19:15] before the 70 years no matter what they
[19:17] did there was no Deliverance but at the
[19:19] mark of 70 years there would come a
[19:22] Deliverance among them that there was
[19:24] nothing that was going to be able to
[19:26] stop it now if you're the one reading
[19:28] reading this throughout the 70 years it
[19:30] would almost be um a moment of uh how
[19:33] could I say it it would be a time as
[19:35] you're knowing no matter how much you
[19:37] prayed no matter what you did no matter
[19:38] what the season amen it was going to be
[19:40] a certain way but they were all looking
[19:43] for the season of Deliverance they were
[19:45] looking for the season of expected end
[19:48] they they knew that God had a thought of
[19:51] Deliverance for them and it would come
[19:53] in a certain season and that season
[19:55] would be marked by 70 years and when
[19:57] they began to to read that and know that
[20:00] 70 years is accomplished that's what was
[20:02] wrong with Jeremiah or with uh Daniel in
[20:05] Daniel the 9th chapter that was why he
[20:08] was being uh enthralled in prayer and
[20:10] and he was fasting and he was looking to
[20:13] God because he knew the season that God
[20:15] would hear prayer concerning the
[20:18] Deliverance of Israel had come upon them
[20:21] isn't it something when you see that
[20:23] there is a mark concerning the prophecy
[20:25] of God and then you see that Mark come
[20:27] to pass let's just say he would say
[20:29] something like seal up the seven
[20:31] Thunders until the seventh angel sounds
[20:34] see then that then there's no matter how
[20:37] you approach the Bible until the seventh
[20:39] angel sounds that will remain sealed but
[20:42] if you're the people who's leaving in
[20:44] the season of when the seventh Angels
[20:46] sounded you have seen your 70 years
[20:49] accomplished now you know it's a season
[20:51] of Deliverance and and a season that God
[20:54] will send utterance and he will send
[20:56] deliverance and he will send an hour and
[20:58] it may look like evil times and it may
[21:01] be Troublesome times amen but God knows
[21:04] his thoughts concerning the church and
[21:06] they're not thoughts of evil there are
[21:08] thoughts of Peace amen there is an
[21:10] expected end for the Church of the
[21:12] Living
[21:14] God I don't know I don't know what the
[21:17] devil has to say about it and I really
[21:19] don't care but I do know this God has
[21:22] thought some things concerning you amen
[21:24] that God has given to the church amen
[21:27] and that is a certain season of time now
[21:30] we read here Amen in in Jeremiah chapter
[21:34] 29 the now let's read the 12th the 12th
[21:37] verse as well then you shall call upon
[21:39] me and shall go in prayer unto me and I
[21:41] will hearken unto you see the
[21:43] inspiration of Daniel to be praying at
[21:45] that very season amen then I will
[21:48] hearken unto you 13th verse here and you
[21:51] shall seek me and find me when you
[21:53] search with me for all your heart Amen
[21:56] in that season if they if their hearts
[21:58] would would seek God they would see it
[22:01] it would come in understanding in that
[22:03] season he meant look what he says I will
[22:05] be found of you sayith the Lord I will
[22:07] turn away your captivity I will gather
[22:09] you from the Nations and from all the
[22:11] places will I you have been driven
[22:13] sayith the Lord I will bring you again
[22:15] into the place which I have caused you
[22:17] to be carried away captive my think
[22:21] about it in that season of understanding
[22:23] in that season of when God is going to
[22:26] answer prayer this is the season that
[22:29] Daniel recognizes by the scripture I am
[22:32] living in that season and this is the
[22:35] effect that it had on Daniel without a
[22:37] church without hymns without religious
[22:40] services without fellowshipping without
[22:42] having other believers to call and
[22:44] compare scriptures to him reading this
[22:47] and determining I'm in the season of the
[22:50] 70th year of the Captivity it brought a
[22:53] desperation upon this man that he had to
[22:57] appeal to God conc concerning the words
[22:59] of Jeremiah my when I think about this I
[23:03] think about the the words of Daniel and
[23:05] how that he was able to be pulled in by
[23:07] the scripture what about you and I this
[23:09] morning amen what about the things in
[23:12] the last days what about the things that
[23:14] we understand by scripture amen that
[23:17] should come up in the last days brother
[23:19] random says it very clearly he says that
[23:21] the holy spirit is here bringing this in
[23:23] the last day the same as it brought it
[23:26] on Daniel in that day might to think of
[23:29] this a prophet amen a prophet like we
[23:32] like we have received could come here
[23:34] and say I understand that there's going
[23:36] to come some scoffers in the last
[23:39] days as he's According to second Peter I
[23:42] manyan knows he opens up the Rapture
[23:43] book brother R begins to preach the
[23:45] greatest revelation of the Rapture he
[23:47] begins with scoffers shall come in the
[23:49] last days now it sounds like a negative
[23:52] but it's not a negative because he's
[23:53] telling you scoffers are going to come
[23:56] but that's a sign to you you're living
[23:58] in the season of your deliverance amen I
[24:02] understand scoffers are coming people
[24:03] are saying to me all the time well
[24:05] scoffers they're they're saying brother
[24:07] bam did this and they're saying they did
[24:08] this and that ought to be a sign to you
[24:11] above all signs that it is the season of
[24:14] the Deliverance of the Church of the
[24:16] Living God Amen that scoffers shall come
[24:19] that Nation shall rise against nation in
[24:21] the last day I understand there'll be
[24:23] tidal WS I understand there'll be
[24:26] fearful sights and flying saucers I
[24:29] understand this for the fail and the
[24:30] fear there'll be a perplexity of time
[24:34] and distressed amongst the nation I
[24:36] don't have time to preach on every one
[24:37] of these but you know the perplexity of
[24:40] the times who knows what to do who knows
[24:42] what to do with the with the with the
[24:44] world's systems and the economies and
[24:46] now we got Co poured on us amen you
[24:49] think it's hard in your own families or
[24:50] your own church think about the world
[24:52] leaders right now trying to determine
[24:55] how to approach this thing it's
[24:57] perplexity it's it's a distress it's a
[24:59] nervousness it's fearful sights amen
[25:02] it's plagues it's a it's ungodliness
[25:04] it's falling everywhere there's so much
[25:06] change in the season we are and we can
[25:09] look at all these things and we could
[25:10] become discouraged by them and we could
[25:12] fall under the fear of them and under
[25:14] the depression of them or we could look
[25:16] at them and say this marks the time
[25:19] period of the Deliverance of the Church
[25:21] of the Living God it ought to make us
[25:24] hold steadfast it ought to make us
[25:26] fearful in the sight of God t know we're
[25:29] in the season of prophetic Deliverance
[25:31] amen of when God said he would open up
[25:33] his ears and hear the prayer of
[25:35] Deliverance in such a time as we're
[25:37] living today I understand this I
[25:40] understand now look at this brother Ram
[25:42] said I understand by scripture that
[25:44] women's going to Bob off their hairs in
[25:46] the last
[25:47] day now ain't never been a season like
[25:50] this when people doing what what he's
[25:51] talking about amen the whole world
[25:54] cutting their hair women is the thing to
[25:55] do I understand they'll wear shorts and
[25:57] clothes and they'll walk in high heeled
[26:00] shoes and tinkling they'll go in the
[26:01] last day I understand the morale will be
[26:04] very low in the last day I understand
[26:06] preachers will be false shepherds in the
[26:07] last day they'll compromise and not feed
[26:10] the people the word of God Amen they'll
[26:12] go after Creeds instead but I understand
[26:14] there'll be a voice that'll come in the
[26:16] last days a crying out of the Wilderness
[26:18] a calling back to the original message
[26:21] back to the things of God I understand
[26:23] by the books these things will take
[26:25] place I understand that in the last days
[26:27] there'll come a famine the churches will
[26:29] be so organized and set everything
[26:32] together in the last days there'll be a
[26:33] famine it'll not be for bread and water
[26:36] but it'll be for the hearing of the word
[26:38] of God and people will go from east to
[26:40] west and north to south seeking to hear
[26:42] the word of God churches will be so
[26:44] organized and tightened till they'll
[26:46] fail to hear it I understand that by the
[26:48] books but in the day oh God there'll be
[26:50] a branch that'll rise up out of David I
[26:53] understand he'll send Elijah as the day
[26:56] comes to an end he'll have a message
[26:58] that'll turn the heart of the children
[27:00] back to their Apostolic fathers turn
[27:02] them back to the original go back again
[27:05] to the end and start and I understand
[27:07] that'll take place just before the
[27:09] spirit leaves the church for the Jews I
[27:13] understand this amen by letter I do it
[27:16] by the word by the written word that
[27:18] Israel will return to her Homeland I
[27:21] understand that prophets that Israel
[27:22] will rise and become a nation they'll
[27:24] establish Temple worship and go to
[27:26] dealing with her again and then come to
[27:28] her Homeland there'll be two prophets
[27:30] that'll rise up in the last day I
[27:32] understand this just as the Gentile
[27:34] Church moves out two prophets are going
[27:36] to arise Elijah and Moses to Israel amen
[27:40] what is it we see these things are true
[27:42] they're scripturally true amen we're
[27:44] looking at all the things happening let
[27:47] me ask y'all something is Israel in its
[27:49] Nation or not is it already there with a
[27:52] with a flag flying over it this morning
[27:54] they have an army a nation a government
[27:57] they have a a seed the UN they're a
[27:59] nation fully a nation and they're doing
[28:02] it now to you that are born and when it
[28:04] was a nation you've been born lately and
[28:06] it seems like it's always been that way
[28:08] but history tells you for 2,000 years
[28:11] hip was not a nation but it's a nation
[28:14] this morning churches are organized this
[28:17] morning women's hair has been cut all
[28:20] over the country immorality has set in
[28:23] Inventions have taken over from the Tree
[28:25] of knowledge they have atom bombs
[28:27] setting in the hand angers ready to
[28:29] destroy the world darkness is settling
[28:31] over through rock and roll and unbelief
[28:33] and Antichrist and Satanism and it's
[28:36] moved into the governments of
[28:38] homosexuality it's everywhere people say
[28:40] well brother way if that ought to be
[28:41] scary it shouldn't be scary for the
[28:43] church it ought to be a season to
[28:45] understand that in the season these
[28:47] things are going on that there would
[28:49] come a desperation in the heart of the
[28:51] people of God and they'll begin to seek
[28:54] the wisdom of the Holy Ghost and
[28:56] whenever God's people begin to pray and
[28:59] seek the wisdom of God the spirit of
[29:02] inspiration and revelation will fill the
[29:04] church with power and authority and
[29:07] bring an eye openening experience to
[29:09] every man and woman and daughter of God
[29:12] in this season that we're living in it's
[29:14] a season of desperation I don't know
[29:16] about you but I'm not going to wait amen
[29:19] for the tribulation to get desperate to
[29:20] see the hour I'm living I'm not going to
[29:23] wait amen until plagues are everywhere
[29:25] to see the season that I'm living I'm
[29:27] going to say God I see in the Bible
[29:30] these things are supposed to be put me
[29:32] in a desperation to understand and to
[29:34] pray and to make my life right before
[29:37] you my brother Ram said it's a season he
[29:40] said and what it ought to do is ought to
[29:41] make us check
[29:43] up it ought to make us check up I think
[29:46] it's checking up
[29:47] time it's checking up time now look what
[29:50] happened here amen when when this when
[29:53] when when amen when when this man begin
[29:56] to pray I'll not go through the entire
[29:58] prayer amen but if you like to read the
[30:00] book of Daniel the nth chapter it's a
[30:02] good time to to read this because amen
[30:05] from the second verse amen here Daniel
[30:08] turns his face to God and he makes a
[30:11] prayer of how evil he has been and how
[30:14] evil his people and how they deserve
[30:17] what they got and how that God made a
[30:19] promise to them if you do this you're
[30:21] going to get this and he said Lord we
[30:23] deserve it he said and give to un unto
[30:26] us is the face of confusion conf usion
[30:28] and amen and and with thee is
[30:30] righteousness and he begins to appeal to
[30:32] God and say we're sitting here confused
[30:34] and alone and forsaken we're outside our
[30:37] Temple we're outside of our worship and
[30:39] it's all because of our sin and our
[30:41] ungodliness he he begins to say our
[30:43] condition is our fault it's the way we
[30:45] did the way we live and you begin to get
[30:47] desperate before God he don't blame God
[30:50] for the situation he don't blame God and
[30:52] say well I I don't understand why you
[30:54] did me this way and I'm upset at you
[30:56] Lord because these situations and they
[30:58] he begin to tell him Lord I know it was
[31:00] the sin and I know it was the people and
[31:02] I know what it was amen but then he
[31:04] begins to ask for understanding he
[31:07] begins to ask God to bring something
[31:09] special amen if you want to read
[31:11] something powerful read Daniel the 9th
[31:12] chapter and read what kind of prayer it
[31:15] is that Angels come to
[31:17] hear because the Bible said while that
[31:20] this man was praying it come about the
[31:22] evening obligation amen or the evening
[31:25] sacrifice and the Bible said the angel
[31:28] Gabriel touched him and he came into the
[31:30] room with him while he was praying
[31:32] that's when the angel came to him you
[31:34] you know how many times brother bam
[31:35] tells us amen if we want angels to visit
[31:38] our home that there's a there's a way to
[31:40] get angels to visit a home he said said
[31:42] an atmosphere that Angels would be
[31:44] welcomed coming into he said the two on
[31:47] the road to EMAs was talking about the
[31:49] Lord when he stepped out he said Mary
[31:52] was thinking on the prophecy when the
[31:54] angel Gabriel come to her amen I believe
[31:57] this morning that angels can come right
[31:58] in the house of God I believe we can set
[32:01] an atmosphere that Angels would come
[32:03] Among Us amen when we set our mind upon
[32:06] the Lord amen set our mind upon the
[32:08] things of God and an angel came to him
[32:11] now I would like to take a about a it
[32:14] would be nice if I took about two hours
[32:16] here and preached on how the angel came
[32:18] to Gabriel Gabriel came to Daniel Amen
[32:21] because I think it would be relevant to
[32:22] the season we're living I'm not going to
[32:24] but it would be relevant to the season
[32:26] we're living of how how the angel came
[32:29] to Daniel Amen you can go hear a prophet
[32:32] tell it in his own Ministry how the
[32:35] angel came to me but you can read how
[32:37] the angel came unto Daniel and it's in
[32:40] the Bible now why people have such a
[32:42] hard time today in believing that an
[32:44] angel could come to a prophet and speak
[32:46] to him I I don't understand because it
[32:48] certainly happens in the Bible and it's
[32:51] clear in the scripture that an angel
[32:53] Gabriel come unto Daniel and if you want
[32:55] to read that we'll read it in Daniel uh
[32:58] chapter 9 verse
[32:59] 22 amen we can read here Daniel 9
[33:03] chapter 20 verse 22 you can read here
[33:05] how the angel actually stepped into the
[33:08] room and he informed me and talked with
[33:11] me and said oh Daniel I am now come
[33:14] forth he said to give thee skill and
[33:16] understanding and at the beginning of
[33:18] the supplication the Commandments I have
[33:20] come to show thee Thou Art greatly
[33:22] beloved therefore understand the matter
[33:24] and consider the vision 70 weeks are
[33:28] determined upon thy people and upon the
[33:30] holy city to finish transgressions to
[33:32] make an end of sin to make
[33:34] reconciliation for iniquity to bring in
[33:36] Everlasting righteousness to seal up the
[33:39] vision and the prophecy and to anoint
[33:41] the most holy now therefore and
[33:44] understand that from the going forth of
[33:46] the Commandment to restore to build
[33:47] Jerusalem under the Messiah the prince
[33:49] shall be seven weeks three score and two
[33:51] weeks and the street shall be built
[33:53] again and the wall and even in
[33:54] Troublesome times and after three score
[33:58] week shall Messiah be cut off but not
[34:00] for himself and in the people of the
[34:02] prince that shall come shall destroy the
[34:04] city and the sanctuary and the end
[34:06] thereof shall be with the flood and with
[34:08] the end of the war of desolations are
[34:09] determined and he shall confirm the
[34:12] Covenant with many for one week and in
[34:13] the midst of the week shall he cause the
[34:15] sacrifice and the oblation to cease and
[34:18] for the overspreading of the
[34:19] Abominations he shall make it desolate
[34:21] even unto the coming consummation that
[34:23] is determined shall be poured upon the
[34:25] desolate now you're reading an angel
[34:28] talking to a man who has been praying
[34:30] concerning the season that he's living
[34:33] in this man is convinced that 70 years
[34:36] have been determined of the Captivity
[34:38] and he's come to the end of 70 years but
[34:41] when Gabriel comes to him he don't just
[34:43] talk to him about 70 years he talks to
[34:46] him about 70 weeks which opens up the
[34:48] entire time span that God will deal with
[34:52] Israel as a nation a lot of people
[34:54] wonder about the 70 weeks and they they
[34:56] say well brother Wayne
[34:58] or they ask questions around the world
[35:00] concerning 70 weeks and many people have
[35:02] confused this and they take it in and
[35:04] they mix it with both Jew and Gentile
[35:06] but brother B said according to the
[35:07] scripture here that Daniel was cons
[35:11] accepting instructions concerning thy
[35:14] people which was the Jewish people so
[35:17] the 70 weeks concerns the Jewish people
[35:21] it is not a gentile scripture at all it
[35:24] is a Jewish scripture now it should be
[35:27] given unto the Jews and it should be
[35:29] brought now I want to take just for a
[35:32] couple moments here and see as the
[35:34] prophet would take this he said when
[35:36] Gabriel come to him he come to bring
[35:39] amen a skill and understanding amen a
[35:43] skill and understanding now that
[35:45] understanding was amen that God was not
[35:48] going to deal with Israel until it come
[35:51] to its
[35:53] Homeland right he's not going to deal
[35:55] with Israel till it comes to its
[35:56] Homeland this was the understanding that
[35:59] God was given unto Daniel that Israel
[36:02] will not be blessed until it comes to
[36:04] his homeland God has never blessed
[36:07] Israel outside of its Homeland is that
[36:10] right he's never blessed it outside of
[36:12] its Homeland when it gets in its
[36:14] Homeland there is where Israel's
[36:16] blessings are laying amen now in case
[36:18] you brother think brother Ram is just
[36:19] talking about Israel his very next
[36:22] statement says but God will not deal
[36:24] with his church until she comes to her
[36:27] Homeland
[36:28] he says which is the message of the hour
[36:31] you see after after God is showing us a
[36:33] parallel that Israel was waiting on a
[36:36] season just as the bride was waiting on
[36:38] a season and God's blessings come upon
[36:41] the church when the message of the hour
[36:43] comes there is a blessing that comes
[36:46] upon the house of the God on the house
[36:48] of God and he will not deal with her
[36:50] outside the message of the hour now I
[36:52] tell you that's something to write down
[36:54] friend and God will not deal with the
[36:56] church outside the message of the hour
[36:58] people get in their mind they're going
[36:59] to go out and do great things and
[37:01] they're going to set the message aside
[37:02] and they're going to go into the
[37:04] apostolic worlds and do great things God
[37:06] will not bless this bride outside the
[37:09] message of the hour if you want a
[37:10] blessing on your life get in this
[37:13] message and let the let the Dynamics of
[37:15] God come upon his word that will
[37:18] Enlighten the season that you're living
[37:20] in and fill you with the glory of the
[37:22] hour that you're living in that's the
[37:24] message that God gives to the church he
[37:26] never did bless Israel outside and he
[37:29] never will bless you outside he'll never
[37:31] bless you as a Methodist or a
[37:32] presbyterian or a Catholic or a pilgrim
[37:35] or a Nazarene or a Church of Christ or a
[37:37] Pentecostal he will never bless that
[37:40] you've got to come back to the Homeland
[37:42] back to the beginning back to a
[37:44] Pentecostal experience like what
[37:46] happened on the day of Pentecost with
[37:48] the power of the Living God that changed
[37:51] thousands of people so now we realize
[37:53] the message of the hour amen is
[37:55] connected to a Pentecostal experience
[37:58] you can't set aside a Pentecostal
[38:01] experience and expect the blessings of
[38:03] God but a Pentecostal experiences a
[38:06] confirmation of the resurrection and
[38:08] brings the church in the homeland of the
[38:11] power of God in the season she's living
[38:13] him I understand by the books that all
[38:16] the wickedness is going to take place
[38:18] but at that same season he said I shall
[38:21] pour out my spirit saith the Lord of
[38:23] hosts and I shall restore sayith the
[38:27] Lord how's he going to restore when he
[38:29] pours out his Spirit he's going to bring
[38:31] a Dynamics on the word that will take
[38:33] the church back to the original word
[38:36] that was poured out on the day of
[38:38] Pentecost amen I don't know about you
[38:40] but I'm not going to camp out in any
[38:42] denominational ages I'm not going to
[38:44] camp out in any of them but when the
[38:46] denominational ages ended that's where
[38:48] the bride's blessings began amen the
[38:51] prophet said that denominational days
[38:53] were ending when the book itself was
[38:55] being opened up we've got to season that
[38:58] we're living in it's a season of
[39:00] understanding it's a season of
[39:02] inspiration it's a season of favor it's
[39:05] a season of Praise it's a season for the
[39:08] bride to go back to where she come from
[39:11] because she's ordained to do so I think
[39:14] there ought to be a desperation in the
[39:15] church to get back under the original
[39:18] word of God not let one Creed not let
[39:20] one idea not one let one a stagnant
[39:23] thing come upon our lives but allow the
[39:26] blessings of God flow like they've never
[39:28] flowed Through The Years God will hear
[39:31] our prayer in that season a prayer for
[39:33] devil portion a prayer for Life a prayer
[39:36] for truth God will hear the prayer
[39:38] because that's the season that is
[39:40] supposed to take place I when I think
[39:43] about this this Angel comes to Daniel
[39:46] and it says he come to bring
[39:48] understanding and skill amen I believe
[39:51] understanding is powerful I believe if
[39:53] you can understand something that brings
[39:55] you into something under with
[39:57] understanding comes power is that right
[40:00] remember remember when when uh the angel
[40:03] had come to brother brandham and brother
[40:05] Ram was sitting there praying constantly
[40:07] about the gift that was in his life and
[40:10] while he was praying about that gift
[40:12] amen he was confused because preachers
[40:14] were telling him it was an evil thing
[40:16] that was coming on him and when he went
[40:18] into prayer the angel came to him and
[40:21] brought a skill and an understanding and
[40:24] told him the reason he was born and said
[40:26] gifts and callings are without
[40:28] repentance and the reason you are the
[40:30] way you are CU you was born for a
[40:33] purpose amen and here he thought that
[40:36] what was happening to him was wrong he
[40:39] thought what he was dealing with him was
[40:40] wrong but when he got in the presence of
[40:43] the Angel he not only welcomed it but he
[40:46] exercised the gift knowing that it was
[40:48] God's will for his life and you see can
[40:51] you can you fellowship with brother
[40:53] random on this point that there was a
[40:55] difference about you there was a
[40:57] Desiring about you and understanding
[41:00] amen and people told you you should stay
[41:02] out of them seals and you stay away from
[41:04] that prophet and you stay away from that
[41:06] church and they're a bunch of Fanatics
[41:08] and they're just shouters and holy
[41:10] rollers and and they told you all them
[41:12] things but whenever you got in the
[41:14] presence of this Angel he made you to
[41:17] understand you were born for the purpose
[41:19] to serve God in the age that you're
[41:21] living in we were not put here amen just
[41:24] to live in this world we were put here
[41:27] to bring the understanding of the word
[41:29] in the season for God said the wise
[41:32] shall understand in the season that
[41:34] we're living in and if there's going to
[41:36] be an understanding there's got to be
[41:39] somebody in this earth that is a vessel
[41:41] of understanding they've got to be a
[41:44] wise virgin who's living in this season
[41:47] we might not be able to break it all
[41:49] down and tie every scripture together
[41:51] but brother we can understand this
[41:54] message comes from God and I was born to
[41:57] be believe it and to prophesy this word
[42:00] in the season that I'm living in my when
[42:03] I think about the
[42:05] grace that was given now now if you take
[42:08] this season of understanding this is the
[42:11] reason that the angel came was for
[42:13] understanding the reason the angel came
[42:16] in this age was to bring understanding
[42:20] to the church that this is the season
[42:23] you're living in this is the time this
[42:25] is the appointment and if it was just me
[42:28] saying it if it was just an angel saying
[42:31] it be one thing but it was the thing
[42:34] that the prophets had already spoken and
[42:37] had brought them into a reality in the
[42:40] season that we are now detailing the
[42:43] time that we're living the spirit of
[42:45] wisdom brother bam said will come into
[42:46] the church to make known the church by
[42:49] revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing
[42:50] the church and revealing what day we're
[42:53] living in the same as Gabriel came to
[42:56] Dan
[42:58] the Holy Spirit has come to the church
[43:00] in the last day to reveal these great
[43:02] deep Secrets do you
[43:05] understand so God came for the purpose
[43:08] to give you understanding amen God Wants
[43:12] You to Know listen God already knows God
[43:16] knows the very moment the very season he
[43:18] already knows the or ordination of your
[43:21] life he knows who has and who hadn't got
[43:23] the Holy Ghost God knows these things
[43:26] but he want wants you to know these
[43:28] things he desires you to see the
[43:30] studying of scripture is not for God
[43:32] it's for you the listening of the tapes
[43:35] is for you to come into understanding of
[43:37] the season to know your age to know your
[43:40] maturity amen I tell you this I I
[43:42] believe that this is the very season for
[43:44] it to happen it's the season of the
[43:46] eagle the season of
[43:49] adoption amen now I brother Rand would
[43:51] tell us that we never have the right
[43:53] kind of Faith until positionally we
[43:55] know who we are
[43:58] faith comes from positionally knowing
[44:01] that's where faith comes
[44:03] from is that right the right kind of
[44:06] faith and the faith we're looking for is
[44:10] not just for Divine Healing we're
[44:12] looking for a faith to change our bodies
[44:15] and that'll take a perfect Faith so
[44:17] there has to be something that can
[44:19] position us perfectly in the word of God
[44:22] in the season we're living and it'll
[44:24] take God to reveal or to bring it
[44:26] brother brother brings it to Revelations
[44:28] 10 and said of course that this would
[44:30] bring an Ephesians or a paradox or an
[44:34] understanding in the last days brother
[44:36] ramam said we're promised that would be
[44:38] an understanding he said we're going to
[44:40] receive an understanding how many know
[44:43] brother Ram actually taught that it was
[44:45] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is a
[44:47] clear
[44:51] understanding so it's not God bringing
[44:54] confusion he's bringing understanding
[44:57] the understanding is the day you're
[44:59] living now people will take these things
[45:02] like we've read right here and instead
[45:04] of bringing understanding they will
[45:06] bring
[45:08] confusion we just read something that
[45:11] has probably brought more confusion
[45:13] among the church then of course in the
[45:16] messages there as much confusion
[45:18] concerning this as anything you've read
[45:20] but the reason the confusion is there is
[45:23] because men desire followings and they
[45:26] desire to sing like they understand
[45:28] things better than the next guy but if
[45:31] you just take a profit and let it become
[45:33] simple the Simplicity of the word will
[45:36] bring understanding which brings faith
[45:38] into your heart and positions you to
[45:40] know where you're standing this very
[45:42] hour we don't have to go chasing some
[45:44] guy somewhere we don't have to come
[45:46] chasing somebody's YouTube program or
[45:48] its internet page to figure out heyen
[45:50] what about this and his and this and
[45:52] that we've got a word from a prophet
[45:54] concerning the season that we're living
[45:57] in think of this in the six-fold purpose
[46:00] amen the six-fold purpose sounds big
[46:02] don't it sounds really sounds like it's
[46:04] just so far nobody could ever understand
[46:06] it but C can we take just a just a
[46:08] moment to look at it look at the
[46:10] six-fold purpose here brother bandam
[46:12] will actually line it out for us and
[46:14] he'll say look it come to bring
[46:16] understanding number one amen now we're
[46:18] going to be looking here at the uh the
[46:21] 70 weeks that are determined it's the
[46:23] 24th verse look at what he says there's
[46:26] there's six things here he says number
[46:28] one we're going to finish the
[46:31] transgression we're going to finish the
[46:33] transgression Daniel is receiving
[46:36] information from Gabriel that's telling
[46:38] him there's 70 weeks accomplished and
[46:40] there's a six-fold purpose for these 70
[46:42] weeks the 70 weeks will end the
[46:45] transgression of
[46:47] Israel see he's telling you the 70 weeks
[46:50] is for a
[46:51] purpose the first purpose of 70 weeks
[46:54] given to Israel is to end the
[46:57] transgression of thy people it's not
[46:59] ending the transgression of the Gentile
[47:01] it's the people so 70 weeks has nothing
[47:04] to do with a gentile church at
[47:07] all amen now I'm going to say this as
[47:10] strong as I know how because 70 weeks
[47:12] determined are to Israel and to
[47:14] Jerusalem thy City and thy people of
[47:17] Daniel but the reason a prophet preaches
[47:20] it is to bring an understanding to the
[47:22] church that's not your
[47:24] inheritance amen and the Trib ation
[47:27] Falls during the time of the 70 weeks
[47:30] and it's not your inheritance so he's
[47:31] not getting on to the church saying you
[47:33] can't understand the 70 weeks he's
[47:35] saying you have no inheritance in the 70
[47:38] week it's not your portion and William
[47:41] brandham is a Joshua and he's crossed
[47:43] the Jordan and he's pointing out the
[47:45] portions that belong to the church the
[47:47] Gentile and he's saying this is your
[47:49] portion and this is your portion and
[47:51] this is your portion but 70 weeks has
[47:53] nothing to do with you and thank God
[47:56] they don't because the 70th week of
[47:58] Daniel is a tribulation period which is
[48:01] the six seal it's the saving of the
[48:03] Jewish people but it has nothing to do
[48:06] with
[48:06] us praise God we're not going into
[48:09] tribulation we believe in a
[48:12] pre-tribulation rapture we don't believe
[48:14] in a post-tribulation rapture we don't
[48:16] believe in a mid-tribulation rapture we
[48:19] believe in a pre-tribulation Rapture the
[48:22] bride will not go through the
[48:24] tribulation period there's no reason for
[48:27] her to go because there is no sin on
[48:31] that
[48:34] bride sixfold purpose of the 70th week
[48:37] number one is to end transgression and
[48:40] there is no transgression in the Church
[48:42] of the Living God there's no see there's
[48:45] there's no transgression here this
[48:47] morning there's nothing that it has
[48:49] nothing to do with us it's to finish the
[48:51] transgression of those that transgressed
[48:53] against God people say what does that
[48:56] mean to finish the transgression what
[48:58] this means is is that Israel killed its
[49:02] own
[49:03] Messiah they killed their own Messiah
[49:06] they transgressed God and the 70th week
[49:09] will be to end the transgression that
[49:11] they made that day at Calvary now if you
[49:14] turn into Romans chapter 11 pull it up
[49:16] right quick Romans 11th chapter and Paul
[49:19] tells you in the 25th and the 26th verse
[49:22] and he gives you the answer to this
[49:24] scripture in Romans 9:24 for I would not
[49:26] Brethren that you be be ignorant of the
[49:28] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[49:30] own conceits the blindness is part as
[49:33] happened to Israel watch until the
[49:36] fullness of the Gentiles come in until
[49:39] the fullness of the Gentiles come in the
[49:41] next verse and also Israel shall be
[49:44] saved all Israel can be saved can you
[49:48] isn't that powerful all Israel shall be
[49:50] saved as it is written there shall come
[49:53] out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[49:56] away the ungodliness from Jacob if you
[49:59] just underline that in your Bible turn
[50:01] away the ungodliness from Jacob is exact
[50:04] translation amen of that he will do away
[50:07] with the transgression the prophet said
[50:09] this is an exact answer to Romans 9 the
[50:12] 24th chapter he will turn away the
[50:14] ungodliness from Jacob what did he do
[50:16] brother Bram said here's what happened
[50:18] he said what they did he said is they
[50:20] rejected their own Messiah now why did
[50:23] they reject their Messiah for you they
[50:26] rejected their Messiah for you they
[50:29] literally murdered their own Messiah who
[50:33] came to give them life so you would have
[50:35] a chance that you would not have a
[50:37] transgression amen that you would have
[50:39] the grace of God in your life my look at
[50:42] this until the fullness of the Gentiles
[50:44] come he's telling you that God stopped
[50:47] Israel and put you in their place he
[50:50] explains it in Romans 11 he said he said
[50:52] he took the he took and took the branch
[50:55] off of the Olive Tree and and grafted in
[50:57] a wild Vine Heen he grafted in a wild
[51:00] Vine what did he do he put you on the
[51:02] Olive Tree that had the roots of Abraham
[51:05] amen how else would you ever get the
[51:07] blessings of Abraham unless God would
[51:09] have put you on the tree of Abraham you
[51:11] had no inheritance in that tree you had
[51:14] no roots in that tree but God took you
[51:16] off the Wild and put you on the tame and
[51:19] the life of Abraham's Covenant came up
[51:21] through the tree and brought a blessing
[51:24] to your house and God is saying until
[51:26] that until that wild tree is finished
[51:30] then I'll come over and get Ro get
[51:32] Israel and I will put it back where it
[51:34] belongs amen what is it the wrong they
[51:37] did transgression the wrong they did
[51:39] Brother B says what will fix it they
[51:41] will receive the Holy
[51:44] Ghost what will fix it they will receive
[51:47] the Holy Ghost all Israel shall be saved
[51:50] They will receive the Holy Ghost can I
[51:52] say it to you not all Israel is
[51:55] Israel not all Israel is Israel Israel
[51:59] he's speaking of is the 144,000 in
[52:02] Revelations the 7th chapter it said God
[52:05] stopped the first world war on the 11th
[52:07] Hour the 11th day in the 11th month it
[52:10] was a mysterious thing but an angel
[52:13] stopped it until the 144,000 were sealed
[52:17] upon their foreheads that seal is the
[52:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to
[52:21] know what them two witnesses are going
[52:23] to preach they're going to preach the
[52:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Israel is
[52:27] going to receive it brother they're
[52:29] going to receive what these Gentiles
[52:31] have turned down God will save them
[52:34] he'll save them according to scripture
[52:36] he'll save them and when he saves them
[52:38] he will make an end to their
[52:41] sins the next one number two he will
[52:43] make an end to the sins that end of sins
[52:46] brother man replaces the word sin with
[52:48] unbelief to make an end to their
[52:50] unbelief what was their unbelief brother
[52:52] man said their unbelief was the Messiah
[52:55] they didn't believe Jesus was the
[52:58] Messiah they didn't believe it honestly
[53:00] when Jesus prayed from the cross he said
[53:03] father forgive them they know not what
[53:06] they do see remember having eyes they
[53:08] see not having ears they hear not God
[53:10] blinded those Jews so that you could
[53:13] receive something and they didn't
[53:15] believe their own Messiah that was their
[53:17] unbelief and the Bible brother B tells
[53:20] us this very clearly he'll make an end
[53:22] to that unbelief he said when did that
[53:24] unbelief come on him Matthew the 24
[53:26] chapter remember or 27th chapter when
[53:29] they were going to crucify Jesus
[53:31] Remember pilate told them I don't find
[53:33] no fault with this man I don't find any
[53:35] fault and you should release him we'll
[53:37] let you release one one one man today
[53:40] remember what they did they said give us
[53:42] barabus right and that's where barabus
[53:45] got life and Jesus got death amen that's
[53:48] where you and I got saved that was the
[53:50] morning of our Salvation the Gentile
[53:52] church was saved and Jesus was crucified
[53:56] and look look at what they said pilate
[53:57] took some water and washed his hands and
[54:00] said I will not have the blood of this
[54:02] innocent man on my hands and you
[54:05] remember what the Israelites said they
[54:07] said let his blood be upon us and
[54:09] brother it was and brother it was that
[54:12] six million Jews that died in that
[54:15] Holocaust under Hitler was the blood of
[54:18] Jesus Christ upon the people through
[54:20] suffering and persecution and it's not
[54:22] over there'll be a three and a half year
[54:24] tribulation where they'll suffer for the
[54:27] thing that they received unto them but
[54:29] God will make an end to the sin he'll
[54:32] bring an end to their unbelief he will
[54:34] open their eyes people say well brother
[54:36] Wayne Amen where's that at in the
[54:38] scripture I I think it's a powerful
[54:40] scripture brother man brings that exact
[54:42] thing to Joseph in the days that Joseph
[54:45] was rejected as a messiah remember his
[54:47] Brethren knew he was their brother but
[54:49] rejected him as the leader and God
[54:52] allowed them to do that and Joseph was
[54:55] taken and made the lord of the Gentiles
[54:58] took a gentile wife and had a family
[55:00] with a gentile woman amen and at the End
[55:04] Amen of sin the end of the unbelief of
[55:06] his Brethren was when they brought them
[55:09] Brethren down to Israel or to Egypt and
[55:12] they sat in the room with Joseph and the
[55:16] prophet of God said look the Bible said
[55:17] and Joseph sett Al they brought the
[55:20] brethren in and Joseph sat Al and he
[55:23] cried aloud brother man said they heard
[55:25] him crying in all of Jerusalem or all of
[55:28] Egypt he was crying because of what had
[55:31] been done he said but what had he done
[55:33] with his wife he had took her and put
[55:36] her away he had put her in the palace
[55:39] while he made himself known to his
[55:41] Brethren what did he do he ended their
[55:44] unbelief he told them I am Joseph your
[55:47] brother and what they do well they thril
[55:49] down and begin to cry
[55:52] and see they make an end to it brother
[55:55] man said they don't make an end to it
[55:57] it'll make an end to it it'll bring it
[55:59] Joseph is an end of sin amen it'll break
[56:02] an end to their sin what's he going to
[56:04] do in Zechariah Chapter 12 I I think
[56:06] this is a powerful scripture Zechariah
[56:09] Chapter 12 in the 10th verse look what
[56:11] he said brother BR brings this one in as
[56:12] well he said I will pour upon the House
[56:14] of David and upon the inhabitants of
[56:16] Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and
[56:18] supplications that they shall look upon
[56:20] me whom they have pierced and they shall
[56:22] mourn him and mourneth for his only son
[56:25] and they shall be bitterness as one is
[56:27] in bitterness for his firstborn and I
[56:29] will pour upon him the House of David
[56:31] the inhabitants of Jerusalem it'll be
[56:32] the spirit of Grace and supplications
[56:35] isn't that amazing that God said in the
[56:37] last days I will pour on Israel the
[56:40] spirit of Grace and supplication I'm
[56:43] going to open their eyes do you know the
[56:45] prophet said that God is going to give
[56:47] white robes to all of them Jews from the
[56:50] time of Jesus all the way to the last
[56:53] day them real Gene that real 144 4,000
[56:56] group that real believer he said he's
[56:59] going to give them a white robe at the
[57:01] end can you imagine that they died
[57:03] without accepting Christ but the spirit
[57:06] of Grace is going to be poured upon them
[57:08] until God will restore unto them what
[57:11] they didn't even deserve but because
[57:13] they were blinded of it I'll tell you
[57:16] this if God is able to pour the spirit
[57:17] of Grace upon those Jews and give back
[57:20] to them what they had done in that day
[57:22] how much greater then is the spirit of
[57:25] Grace upon him bride in the day we're
[57:27] living in listen this I can can I just
[57:30] say this the devil pushes you and the
[57:33] devil's beat you up with law and
[57:35] traditions and he's all time got in the
[57:37] church feeling like you don't deserve
[57:39] nothing and you don't deserve the
[57:41] blessing and you don't deserve the grace
[57:43] amen but can I say something this is the
[57:45] season when God has been pouring out
[57:48] he's been pouring out the grace of God
[57:51] if there ever was a time that the grace
[57:54] of God has been poured out it's the
[57:57] season that I'm living in it's the hour
[57:59] that I'm living in today it's a season
[58:02] of the grace of God being poured out
[58:04] upon the church when has there ever been
[58:07] a church that has heard a prophet say I
[58:10] went beyond the curtain of time and seen
[58:12] that bride and when I seen her she was
[58:15] standing there in a white robe he said
[58:17] where did they get them white robes he
[58:20] said they got it from the pardoning
[58:21] grace of accepting this word amen we're
[58:24] not going to receive white robes she's
[58:27] already got white robes listen you might
[58:30] not know it this morning but if you have
[58:32] received the pardoning grace of the word
[58:33] of God you're a wife wrapped in the
[58:36] white robe of God's grace and mercy it's
[58:39] an adoption robe church it's a robe of
[58:44] authority I know I know you don't feel
[58:46] like you're worthy amen but he said
[58:49] you're worthy come and walk with
[58:52] me what was it it's a it's a time it's a
[58:56] time of Grace now you can I'll just run
[58:58] through this quickly and not spend no
[59:00] long time here but in in the third part
[59:03] he said he'll make a Reconciliation for
[59:05] iniquity amen he'll make a
[59:07] Reconciliation for iniquity he said
[59:09] what's the iniquity of course it's again
[59:11] rejecting Christ but the Bible says in
[59:14] Isaiah 66 and8 that Israel will be
[59:17] borned in one
[59:20] day Israel will be borned in one day in
[59:23] Zechariah 13 He said what he's going to
[59:26] do is he's going to open up a fountain
[59:30] in the House of David look what he's
[59:32] going to do he's going to bring Grace
[59:34] for the iniquity this is all speaking of
[59:38] Israel he's going to bring in the fourth
[59:41] the fourth purpose he's going to bring
[59:42] in Everlasting righteousness amen God's
[59:45] going to now we're talking about Israel
[59:47] people ask me said brother Wayne will
[59:49] the Jews be in the
[59:51] Millennium for thy and thy people look
[59:53] what he said to bring in everlasting
[59:55] life righteousness brother brand in the
[59:57] church book actually says the Jews will
[59:59] be in the Millennium the 144,000 he said
[1:00:03] they will be there but they will
[1:00:05] remember they will be servants he said
[1:00:07] amen I don't I don't know what that
[1:00:08] actually means but they if you're in the
[1:00:11] Millennium it'd be all right me whatever
[1:00:12] I am
[1:00:14] H just get me there
[1:00:17] brother I'd rather be a doorkeeper in
[1:00:19] the house of
[1:00:21] God Amen he actually takes this to
[1:00:23] Revelation 20 and 1 and 3 and habca 2
[1:00:27] and ver14 he said it's when any the
[1:00:29] enemy has been put away and he would
[1:00:32] bring in Everlasting righteousness other
[1:00:34] words he's going to seal it away in the
[1:00:36] fifth he said he would unseal the vision
[1:00:38] and the prophecy it says seal in the in
[1:00:41] the book brother Ram takes it to sealing
[1:00:42] it then and unsealing it now in the
[1:00:45] sixth he said that he would come in the
[1:00:47] Millennium and anoint the most holy
[1:00:49] other words he's going to anoint a
[1:00:51] millennial Temple amen I don't
[1:00:53] understand amen people ask me all the
[1:00:55] time so will they Millennial Temple
[1:00:57] brother Ram said the sixth purpose amen
[1:00:59] of gabel's instructions to Daniel was to
[1:01:01] tell him God was going to anoint a
[1:01:03] temple in the Millennium so I just one
[1:01:06] who believes God's going to anoint a
[1:01:07] temple in the Millennium how it's going
[1:01:09] to get there who
[1:01:11] knows is it going to build it going to
[1:01:13] come out of heaven what's going to take
[1:01:14] place who knows if you go read it
[1:01:17] brother bam ties this to the Future home
[1:01:20] in the in the eighth day but you find
[1:01:22] out it's in the future home brother Bram
[1:01:24] backs up and he recar ifies it and said
[1:01:26] the Millennium is not the future home
[1:01:28] and he shows the Everlasting is in the
[1:01:30] Millennium so what are we looking at
[1:01:32] we're looking at God doing something in
[1:01:34] the days amen he's doing this in the
[1:01:37] days of Daniel telling him about 70
[1:01:40] weeks that is to be accomplished under
[1:01:42] Israel now now can we just take just a
[1:01:44] moment and say brother B what is 70
[1:01:47] weeks what does that mean one week
[1:01:50] equals 7 years so got to say it's 70
[1:01:52] years weeks other words there's 70 weeks
[1:01:56] of years so every week was seven years
[1:01:58] now according to scripture there was 69
[1:02:02] of those weeks that were fulfilled up to
[1:02:05] the time of Jesus's birth now how many
[1:02:09] realizes now if you if you go study this
[1:02:11] I'm going to tell you this and then you
[1:02:12] can go study the rest of it instead of
[1:02:14] taking a long time but there's a lot of
[1:02:16] people that teach that there's a week
[1:02:18] left to Jews which is 7even years they
[1:02:20] say the years of the tribulation is
[1:02:22] seven years and they teach that
[1:02:24] emphatically and I'll promise you if if
[1:02:25] you go listen to 70th week of Daniel
[1:02:27] you'll find out why they teach that
[1:02:30] because brother brandham is saying
[1:02:31] there's a week left to the Jews in the
[1:02:33] 70th week of Daniel but when you take to
[1:02:36] the fifth and The Sixth Seal brother
[1:02:38] brandham revisits the subject and he
[1:02:41] said that Jesus's Ministry fulfilled the
[1:02:44] first three and a half of the 70th week
[1:02:47] he said so there's three and 1/2 years
[1:02:50] left unto the Jews so the three and a
[1:02:53] half years unto the Jews matches exactly
[1:02:57] what was prophesied of the two witnesses
[1:02:59] in Revelations the 11th chapter when you
[1:03:02] think about the 70th week of Daniel
[1:03:05] we're talking about the last half of the
[1:03:07] 70th week of Daniel which is three and a
[1:03:09] half years now those three and a half
[1:03:11] years means god owes Israel three and a
[1:03:14] half years to end transgression to make
[1:03:16] an end of sin Amen to bring uh sealing
[1:03:19] the way of their iniquity he's God's
[1:03:21] going to deal with those Jews that's
[1:03:23] what he's saying that's what that's what
[1:03:25] the 70th week means God's going to deal
[1:03:27] with them Jews he's going to let them
[1:03:29] receive the Holy Ghost now if you turn
[1:03:31] to Revelations the 11th chapter let's
[1:03:33] read the first three verses how is God
[1:03:35] going to deal with them Jews just like
[1:03:37] he dealt with you
[1:03:39] Gentiles do you know that the opening
[1:03:41] them trumpets to the Jews as he open the
[1:03:43] seals to the
[1:03:44] bride do you know that seventh angel
[1:03:47] sounding to the Gentiles is opening of
[1:03:50] the seventh
[1:03:51] seal the opening of The Sixth Seal is
[1:03:54] two prophet sounding in Israel
[1:03:57] Revelations 11 the first verse amen what
[1:04:00] is it it's when God begins to deal with
[1:04:02] the Jews he sends two Messengers to them
[1:04:05] now you can't get them Jews saved until
[1:04:08] God is in the season of saving them
[1:04:11] therefore was given unto me a rod I'm
[1:04:13] reading Revelations 11:1 and therefore
[1:04:15] was given me a rod and it was an angel
[1:04:17] stood saying rise and measure the temple
[1:04:19] of God and the Altar and them that
[1:04:21] worship
[1:04:22] therein and the court which was without
[1:04:24] the temple even measure it not for it is
[1:04:26] given unto the Gentiles and the holy
[1:04:28] city shall tread under for
[1:04:30] 40 and two
[1:04:33] months we're talking about 30-day
[1:04:35] calendar of the Jew you're talking about
[1:04:38] three and a half years watch the next
[1:04:39] now he said and I will give power un my
[1:04:42] two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[1:04:45] 1,2 and3 score days clothed in sackcloth
[1:04:49] 3 and a half years there is no
[1:04:52] seven-year period of ministry in the
[1:04:54] 70th week there's three and A2 years of
[1:04:57] Jesus's Messiah prophecy and then two
[1:05:00] witnesses Moses and Elijah can we just
[1:05:02] keep reading a minute here it's a
[1:05:03] beautiful reading these are the two
[1:05:05] olive trees of the two candlesticks
[1:05:06] standing before the god of the
[1:05:08] earth and if any man will hurt them fire
[1:05:11] proceedeth out of their mouth and devour
[1:05:13] their enemy and if any man heard him he
[1:05:15] must be man or killed like this how many
[1:05:17] knows Elijah called fire out of heaven
[1:05:19] and destroyed Men by the 50s the same
[1:05:23] one the next verse and there have power
[1:05:26] to shut the heaven and that it rain in
[1:05:28] the days of the prophecy how many knows
[1:05:29] that Elijah shut the heaven up for three
[1:05:32] and a half
[1:05:33] years amen look in in the days of the
[1:05:35] prophecy and the power of the waters to
[1:05:37] turn them to blood now we're talking
[1:05:38] about Moses and to Smite the Earth with
[1:05:41] plagues talking about Moses and often as
[1:05:44] they will now these men will prophesy
[1:05:46] for three and a half years what is this
[1:05:48] Revelations 11 is the last half of
[1:05:51] Daniel's 70th week which is known to the
[1:05:54] church as The Sixth Seal
[1:05:56] in the Book of Revelations the 6th
[1:05:58] chapter which is a season when the
[1:06:00] foolish virgins are going to be saved
[1:06:03] which is a season when the 144,000 are
[1:06:06] going to be saved but it's not the
[1:06:08] season the bride's going to be saved
[1:06:10] because the bride is not going to be
[1:06:12] there she's already been raptured
[1:06:15] because of a prophetic word of Malachi
[1:06:19] the 4th chapter hold on to this word
[1:06:21] church amen amen you got Bibles and you
[1:06:24] got prophecies and you got got scripture
[1:06:26] and you got church and you got amens and
[1:06:28] you got everybody gathered together we
[1:06:31] need to keep the victory like never
[1:06:33] before I know things are rough and
[1:06:35] trials are everywhere and problems are
[1:06:38] arising on every corner sicknesses and
[1:06:40] diseases and and mournful sounds I it's
[1:06:43] a it's one of the most horrific Seasons
[1:06:46] that any people have ever lived I would
[1:06:49] just praying about this yesterday as I
[1:06:50] was reading over these things and I
[1:06:52] thought it was amazing because when
[1:06:54] brother Ram deals with these he he
[1:06:56] doesn't brother man just talks about the
[1:06:59] darkness and he keeps bringing the
[1:07:00] darkness he keeps showing the darkness
[1:07:03] amen now it's it's not a how can I say
[1:07:06] this it's not in the negative that
[1:07:08] brother randam is showing the Dark Side
[1:07:10] of leard deia it's not in the negative
[1:07:13] that he's showing us the denominations
[1:07:15] and the troubles and the problems that
[1:07:17] are arising upon us what he's trying to
[1:07:19] do is show us the season that we're
[1:07:21] living that night is coming he's trying
[1:07:24] to tell the Church the darkest night the
[1:07:27] world has ever known is coming upon the
[1:07:30] Earth amen I I I can I can I take it to
[1:07:32] the scripture in the book of Isaiah the
[1:07:34] 21st Church 21st verse Isaiah said it
[1:07:38] was recorded in Isaiah he said that they
[1:07:41] asked of the scripture and they said
[1:07:43] Watchman what of the night see they
[1:07:46] looked for understanding from a Watchman
[1:07:49] who had been climbed up high and brother
[1:07:51] man said which was an eagle of God it
[1:07:53] was a prophet of God that had lined up
[1:07:56] higher than the normal man could see and
[1:07:59] see what they were doing is scare was
[1:08:01] coming in the city troubles were coming
[1:08:03] and they looked to The Watchmen they
[1:08:05] said Watchman what of the night and the
[1:08:08] Watchman seeing the trouble that was
[1:08:10] coming prophesied to the city he said
[1:08:13] the night
[1:08:14] cometh the night cometh and any true
[1:08:17] Watchman has got to say the night cometh
[1:08:20] they can see the leard deia they can see
[1:08:22] the struggles and the trials and the
[1:08:24] problems and they can see it's not going
[1:08:26] to get better church can I tell you this
[1:08:28] this is not going to get I wish I could
[1:08:30] get up here this morning and say to you
[1:08:32] all this will be over next week and
[1:08:33] things will return to normal and things
[1:08:35] are going to get better after that I
[1:08:37] tell you things are not going to get
[1:08:39] better I tell you that economies are
[1:08:41] going to crash I tell you weapons are
[1:08:43] going to be increased and and
[1:08:44] pollution's going to get worse and and
[1:08:46] corruption's going to get worse I I say
[1:08:49] it's all going to get worse the Bible
[1:08:50] said it would gross worse and worse as
[1:08:53] the days are coming you think things are
[1:08:55] bad they're going to get
[1:08:57] worse I know it sounds rough but let me
[1:08:59] tell you that Watchman climbed up high
[1:09:02] and he said the night cometh amen he
[1:09:04] said but the morning cometh
[1:09:06] also but the morning cometh also I
[1:09:09] thought oh God I heard brother Rand him
[1:09:11] on tape he cried out he said the morning
[1:09:14] cometh also I thought dear God Amen I'm
[1:09:18] so glad that the morning cometh also I'm
[1:09:21] glad that these things that were seen
[1:09:24] it's not all that were looking at but
[1:09:26] the morning is coming for the
[1:09:29] church preacher what are you saying
[1:09:31] Watchman what of the night what does
[1:09:33] that mean to the church brother Bram
[1:09:35] said it means what's going to happen
[1:09:39] what's about to happen Daniel was in the
[1:09:42] season of change he was asking what's
[1:09:45] about to happen I'm saying Watchmen
[1:09:47] what's about to happen and we've had a
[1:09:49] prophet on the scene to bring
[1:09:51] understanding that the 70th week of
[1:09:53] Daniel is about to take place but
[1:09:56] there's a church a bride that has come
[1:09:59] under a prophetic word that's going to
[1:10:01] be lifted off of this Earth before the
[1:10:04] night can come to a climax the Church of
[1:10:07] the Living God is not going to be here
[1:10:09] I've got quote after quote where brother
[1:10:11] B said Russia is going to bomb America
[1:10:13] he said but before the first bomb ever
[1:10:16] drops there'll be a bride sting in glory
[1:10:19] tribulation coming but before it ever
[1:10:21] strikes there'll be a bride set in glory
[1:10:25] you said preacher how can you be so sure
[1:10:27] because it's our leaving that begins the
[1:10:31] 70th week of Daniel again and again and
[1:10:33] again brother Ram says he will not deal
[1:10:36] with the Jew and the Gentile at the same
[1:10:38] time let me assure you the bride will
[1:10:41] not go through
[1:10:44] tribulation you said brother Wayne
[1:10:46] when's this Rapture going to start I
[1:10:48] tell you it's already began I tell you
[1:10:50] change has already started God has
[1:10:53] already took you from your cigarettes
[1:10:55] and the alcohol and the beer he's
[1:10:57] already took you from denomination he's
[1:10:59] already rescued from the traditions of
[1:11:02] man rapturing Grace has already come
[1:11:04] into our heart the word has already been
[1:11:07] restored Seven Seals have already been
[1:11:10] opened the Thunders have already sounded
[1:11:13] God has already sent the grace and the
[1:11:16] multiplication of the spirit upon the
[1:11:18] Church of the Living God I say the
[1:11:20] Rapture of the church is already in a
[1:11:23] process this morning I say there's a
[1:11:25] word that is bringing stimulation by
[1:11:28] Revelation in the Church of the Living
[1:11:30] God listen to me friend this is not
[1:11:33] another message amen that goes to these
[1:11:35] Jews they will preach your message they
[1:11:38] will preach the same things that we are
[1:11:41] preaching in the Church of the Living
[1:11:42] God Amen whatever we need for a Rapture
[1:11:46] is all here
[1:11:49] today we're not looking for a great
[1:11:51] ministry we're not looking for a great
[1:11:53] man going to wave a wand over us and
[1:11:56] we're all going to be changed Bible
[1:11:58] prophecy has already shown you're living
[1:12:00] in the season of fulfillment you're
[1:12:02] living in the hour of it amen it's time
[1:12:05] to rise and shine morning Stars the
[1:12:09] light has come the light of
[1:12:11] understanding for resurrection power for
[1:12:15] anointing so brother Wayne why in the
[1:12:17] world we go through all them scriptures
[1:12:19] and all these things because many have
[1:12:20] brought them and brought confusion to
[1:12:23] the church to make them Wonder are they
[1:12:25] worthy I say you're worthy people's
[1:12:28] brought it to make it Wonder amen are
[1:12:30] you ever going to make it I say we
[1:12:31] already made it by the word of God I
[1:12:34] know we can't change the problems I know
[1:12:36] we can't change the hour but God the
[1:12:39] grace of God he has changed our
[1:12:41] understanding that we're able to see
[1:12:44] things differently than we've ever saw
[1:12:46] them morning is coming
[1:12:49] friends morning is coming I know I see
[1:12:52] where we're at morning is coming we
[1:12:55] losing loved ones but mour is

[1:13:04] you know how can you be so sure cuz the
[1:13:06] lights already begin to
[1:13:10] shine brother Brandon actually says this
[1:13:13] he said it's not coming from the Moon
[1:13:15] anymore he said the moon has already set
[1:13:19] he said and darkness has filled the sky
[1:13:21] he said but there's a Morning Star
[1:13:23] standing there alone
[1:13:26] prophesying of the oncoming
[1:13:31] light oh Daniel that morning star was
[1:13:35] alone no church no denominations would
[1:13:38] preach what he was preaching but he was
[1:13:40] standing alone with the prophecy and the
[1:13:42] same has happened in our age a prophet
[1:13:45] stood alone in the changing of times and
[1:13:47] told the bride the night is coming but
[1:13:50] the morning cometh also don't forget to
[1:13:53] tell the church the morning cometh don't
[1:13:56] forget to tell the bride the morning
[1:13:58] cometh oh don't forget to tell them the
[1:14:01] Rapture is upon the
[1:14:04] church we're not going to go in a
[1:14:06] Rapture after the
[1:14:08] tribulation we're going
[1:14:11] before we're going before could you
[1:14:13] stand to your feet with us this
[1:14:17] morning we're going
[1:14:23] before I believe it's the
[1:14:27] season of
[1:14:30] understanding
[1:14:33] night it's just going to get darker
[1:14:38] friends oh but that
[1:14:41] church she's rising up into a realm to
[1:14:45] reflect the
[1:14:47] light you can never say these things
[1:14:49] standing on the
[1:14:51] ground you got to get up there where
[1:14:53] that light can strike you
[1:14:56] right when that light begins to strike
[1:14:58] you can you can shine forth you can walk
[1:15:01] in the darkest of
[1:15:04] situations so God sent a message to us
[1:15:07] things are about to change
[1:15:10] here and for the church that's a
[1:15:12] powerful
[1:15:14] thing amen what an

[1:15:57] we'd be sitting there fishing or
[1:15:59] something he said brother brand get real
[1:16:01] quiet he said little breeze Blow by and
[1:16:03] he said he jerk off his hat and say he's
[1:16:06] here he said to us it was just a
[1:16:10] breeze but to brother
[1:16:12] brandom the resurrection power just
[1:16:14] swept across
[1:16:18] him I don't want to miss the
[1:16:23] moment when a Bree flows through here I
[1:16:26] don't want to sit on no
[1:16:28] limb let the breezes of anointing and
[1:16:30] Rapture raise up the thing that would
[1:16:33] carry
[1:16:34] us brother Bram said he went back to the
[1:16:37] mountains in Colorado he said no matter
[1:16:38] what the wind was doing he said there
[1:16:39] was a little Channel there he said I'd
[1:16:41] go to in the mornings he said about
[1:16:42] Sunrise he said i' go to this one little
[1:16:45] Channel and he said when the morning sun
[1:16:48] began to peep he said the wind would
[1:16:51] change and he said it would all funnel
[1:16:53] right down this one channel
[1:16:56] and he said I'd sit there and hear the
[1:16:57] wind blow down that
[1:17:00] channel now he's telling us that the
[1:17:04] winds were blowing all over the
[1:17:06] world but when that Morning Sun starts
[1:17:09] Rising that wind changes and it goes
[1:17:12] right down the channel of

[1:17:21] the breezes that's coming and recognize
[1:17:23] it as the wind of the resurrection power
