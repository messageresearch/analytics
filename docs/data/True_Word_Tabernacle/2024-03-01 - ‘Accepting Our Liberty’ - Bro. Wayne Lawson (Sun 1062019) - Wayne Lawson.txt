the [Music] answer amen do you love the Lord this morning certainly a privilege to be here with you today amen and uh I was just noticing unless there's been a huge change I've just noticed and looked out the window just before I came out and the Sun was shining so amen so I I knew that'd be a little relief amen amen uh sometimes you know uh we we just uh like to bring a good report amen and uh we thank the Lord for the report that he's given us in this age and time and what a blessing that it is amen I don't know how many of you was with us last night but we just certainly had a wonderful time in the Lord and and the the grace that he shown amen don't we appreciate the presence of God Amen and what he does for us and wonderful and amen and uh I didn't even get a chance to greet our friends from Canada uh last night God bless you Billy Gordon appreciate seeing you all and amen the different ones that was able to be there last night we certainly appreciate the uh amen the support to this morning if we can uh let's just turn in our Bibles and I'd like to maybe just read from the same section of scripture that I read last night uh in Romans the 10th chapter uh if you were there um we got about about onethird of the way into the thought and the Lord just took it over and then there we went amen so uh amen I I appreciate when God does that kind of thing amen and amen and uh we just want to read from here this morning in Romans chapter 10 and let's look at the 11th verse for the scripture saith whosoever believeth upon Him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him now for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher now how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing by the word of God let's just bow our hearts faithful Lord we thank you this morning we thank you for the word of life and the truth in this age and Lord for a heart to believe it Lord where would we be this morning if there wasn't something in us that we this message was Lord with a certainty and father I I thank you so much for what you have sent in this time that we're living we ask you father this morning that you would take your word that you would bless this Congregation of people that have gathered here Lord and truly we've come here to worship you we've come here to Lord to find ourselves closer to you and Lord we're asking you this morning that you would just lead us in the paths of righteousness for thy name's sake we ask it in Jesus mighty name amen and amen may God bless you this morning as you are seated uh I want to maybe just speak to you a little bit today upon accepting our Liberty accepting our Liberty um I've been uh just Thursday night of course I'm in the series of Matthews and I just to be honest with you it just left me just like that and I'm not a cold Theologian so I I try to follow the inspiration so maybe we'll get back to it and next week I've got a bunch of things on it so we'll see but uh but uh but I uh just some things that was dealing with my heart and I got to preaching on true worship and found some quotes and things that really was blessing me and so uh just just moving into that but I uh spoke last night to the congregation there at brother Jonathan's in the meeting many of you were there we were actually speaking on receiving adoption Authority and uh but this morning I want to preach on accepting our Liberty and I'm praying that that we're able to uh maybe just make a small connection here this morning with you up adoption and Liberty because I think that it's sometimes we maybe maybe don't catch some of the things that the prophet would say and I'm myself speaking of and then as he says things it just gets more relevant and more real all the time as we go and and looking into U looking into the scripture of course this morning we're speaking and we're reading here from Romans the 10th chapter when Paul says whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved but then who could call on him that that didn't know him or haven't known him how could they actually call on him and whom they haven't heard and then yet how could they hear without a preacher and then how could a preacher preach unless he be sent amen and then if he is sin if he's called of God he will actually preach the message of the age that he's living in he actually cannot speak something different if he's called of God to preach he would have to preach the season and the time that he was actually called to be in and to look to see that the scripture would say Amen that that Faith cometh by the hearing and by the hearing of the word of God so everything God has for the generation will be delivered to them by the preaching of the Gospel it's clear to us that will not be any more sacrifice Christ will not be taken any more weapons for our healings there will be no more Bloodshed for our sins there'll be no more cross there'll be no more judgment he will not have to return to hell again amen but all of these things have already been a finished work and today we believe the only way we can receive for them is our faith according to that finished work and that faith is actually generated or brought To Us by the preaching of the word that preaches of a finished work now to preach this message just in a cold inspiration or just a an intellectual way is not preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is preaching a Living manifested Word that brings a liberty to the church to know that God will do exactly what he said to do and there is some people that actually believes that that the word of the age is quickened and that quickened word is where God has called his church to to bring forth its Liberty in that church at that time now everything that you already have has been paid for and that that what you're going to receive from that is that the preaching of the word the inspiration of the word will bring to you those things which have been given now I want to just review just a second here and God has actually did something wonderful in that God gives all these but he gives them in Seasons so everything God has for the church he actually has in season God works in season God works in times we can go all the way through the scriptures there's so many scriptures but you could go to Daniel 12 and see he said shut it up until the time of the end you can go to Revelations 10 and you'll find that all the great wondrous things that John saw he was told to seal it up until the seventh angel would begin to sound so God actually works within a Time according to Psalms 102 that the Lord would actually appear in his glory at the time that Zion was built up and when the Church of the Living God comes to the stature of the perfect man that God would appear to them there in his glory amen and we find that of course the scripture tells us that in John CH 12 that unless a corn would fall in the ground it would die it would abide alone but if it would die it will bring forth much fruit knowing that in in John 12 the people wanted to see Jesus and Jesus told them Greeks at that time you cannot see me now but when the corn goes in the ground and comes back again then when you're going to see me of course he's speaking of Luke 17:30 when the day the son of man shall be revealed the Gentiles will have their opportunity to see Christ in his manifested glory at that day amen they'll be able to see him see God sets times when he told Sarah I will visit you according to the time that was the time that God gave her a body change amen there's a time when God in job said he would hide him in the grave until his time would come and then he would give him a resurrection there's a time that God said I will arise and have mercy up on Zion the time of her favor the set time has come my I think this morning it's kind of hard to get past scriptures like that Ain it there's a time that God's going to favor the church amen there's a time that he's going to appear unto them and I I I hope that Amen in in repetition that we catch that this is the time of the favor of God if you know the time that you're living in you know that you're working in the plan of God you're not here doing these things by yourself I'm not just a preacher trying to bring something or manufacture something or amen but all God is looking for is some men that'll get out of the way to preach the word of this age and its manifested power and glory and there's a God here this morning that'll back up this word we're not standing here trying to make something happen amen something is happening and I'm only here Amen to tell you the things that I see God doing and happening and it's and it's actually going in if you remember back about a year ago we actually said to the church I believe we're changing levels I believe that your that your floor amen your ceiling will become your floor amen and and you know in in saying that sometimes people think well brother Wayne thinks he's going to lead a a higher level or something no that wasn't even what I was saying what I was saying was is I feel a change in the church and amen I wasn't trying to prophesy what I think is going to be I'm only announcing what I am experiencing and what is happening in the church and sometimes God is doing Miracles Among Us amen but we're not recognizing what he's doing then it happens and it never helps us but if we could only know and realize that God is changing ing lives and hearts and and manifesting His glory and his power amen I'll tell you when things begin to be known we begin to receive things amen when we look at this for the time amen that we believe the hour of favor has come amen I believe that I'm sorry if if I'm wrong but I believe that I believe the hour of God's favor is upon the church I believe that it's our season of redemption I believe it's our season of blessing I believe it's our season of God doing great things among us and I don't know about you amen but I don't want somebody else to live my season I don't want somebody else to have the things that God has promised me and for my age I know Moses had a wonderful age and Joshua had a wonderful Age and and I know Paul had a wonderful time all of the disciples had their age and their time but this is not their time this is actually your time and if we could only catch this they everyone longed to see this day and did not see but blessed be your eyes and blessed be your ears for you're the one that sees this message you're the one that hears the things that God has had shut up in the book from the foundation of the world Amen to think this morning we are to shake ourselves and recognize that this day this message this hour is the greatest of all Revelation that has ever been given to the church and there is no greater prevailing power than the power of Revelation to receive the revelation of God this morning is to receive the Liberty that you have been looking for ah the spirit of the Lord is upon me that's what Jesus said Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord y'all remember amen I I i' I've preached it here at the church and I just want to maybe bring this into your memory if you're visiting this morning you maybe hear uh uh the spirit in that in Luke chapter 4 Jesus will say the spirit of the Lord is upon me and he says it's here an anoint to me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captive to recover the side of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the ministers and all of their eyes fell upon him and the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears isn't that awesome in your ears amen it was being fulfilled because they were hearing it it was being fulfilled in their ears they were hearing a Vindicated word saying this is the season the Lord is on me for this season now it's it's it's a phenomenal to me because I I I've I've studied the scripture back and forth looking for any other place but I haven't found it but this is actually the place it changes from the trumpet of Jubilee to the preaching of of the Gospel uh until this time in the Scripture it was that a jubilee horn would be used to announce Jubilee y'all remember what Jubilee is I'm not going to teach on it so but Jubilee was a time every 50 years they would sound a trumpet and the people would be free to return back to their possessions now there's something that's very key in this point because the key to it is is that the children of God who were returning in the 50th year they were returning to their possessions now they were actually Sons amen of Israel and they had a place they belonged so under the Jubilee trumpet they was not returning to something that they didn't belong to them but they had been being held bondage or hostage under a servitude of some some debt old and when the jubilees sounded they returned back to their inheritance see they returned back to the liberty of their inheritance it wasn't something that wasn't theirs it wasn't something that didn't belong to them it was just something they couldn't possess because of a debt that was owed against it but under the sounding in that Jubilee it brought them a liberty to return that's why in John chapter 8 when the scripture said for the who the son has set free is free indeed and and the scripture will go on to say for the servant abideth not in the house forever but the Son and the prophet said what Jesus is saying there is the servant had no inheritance in the house do you see people who worked in the fields and people who were servants to a farm they had no inheritance in that land now they were being paid but no inheritance so if they were taken out into slavery when the Jubilee trumpet sounded they couldn't return because they had no Heritage they had no inheritance but Sons on the other hand could return to what the father had give them under the sound of that Jubilee and to think that in this scripture Jesus is saying that the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord changing it from the sounding of a horn to the preaching of the Gospel so the preaching of the Gospel is what's going to release Sons to go back to their inheritance that was originally Theirs to begin with oh come on Church you didn't become a son you always were a son amen but you were under the bondage of a servitude amen you see God has got a liberty for the church that goes beyond just a just a freedom it goes beyond is a returning to everything that God has gave to you everything that is owed amen against it will be smitten off you shall return to your possessions of course a prophet will announce by this in the 10 virgins he said when the trumpet sounds he said I tell every one of you take visible our audience the one that serve in sin the day of sin is over that's what it actually meant the day of sin is over the day of unbelief has finished the day of unbelief finishes in other words when the trumpet sounds in the Scripture it was a gospel it was a trumpet of a horn but Jesus made it the gospel and when this gospel trumpet begins to sound the day of sin is over the day of sin is finished amen the seventh seal ends all things amen I really want to preach on the seventh seal this morning forgive me but but it's in my it's it's in my notes but I I couldn't get the inspiration I wanted to preach on it but the seven seal ends all things you see what it does it brings an End Amen to the servitude or the sin of Our Lives it brings an end to the bondage of not knowing who we are not knowing where we belong not knowing what we're supposed to be doing amen but the seven seal opens up the mind of God and brings the mind of God through the preaching of the word which we lets us turned back to what we were in the mind of God can you imagine this morning if you really went to the mind of God what you're supposed to be what you're supposed to be doing what God has given you by the mind of God this morning I tell you what every fear would die every doubt would die every unbelief would die every thought that I can't make it every thought that I ain't enough every thought that says you'll never make it it with every bit die in the presence of the word of God this word is has been sent to destroy the works of the devil and has filled your mind and your heart to say I can't do it I won't make it if I'm not able to do it but if you would just hear the message of the hour it is a message of Deliverance it's a message of Liberty it's a message of adoption it's a message of sunship it's not a message I'm saved today and I'm lost tomorrow this message delivered an establishment in the grace of God that I was saved and if I'm saved I'm forever saved ain't no devil going to lock me out ain't no devil going to pull me out if God save me I'm Sav for Time and Eternity by one Spirit we are baptized into the body amen not just from one day to another day not from one hour to another hour but God has sealed us until the day of redemption if you ever come in you don't have to go out amen until the change of our body this message is a message of adoption it's a message of security it's a message of power it's a message of Liberty not a bunch of bondage amen not a bunch of bondage no sir no not this church not this message not this bride no sir the day of sin is over that's right Satan has lost it this is not his day this is a bride's day this is a bride's hour I know Le de is living in Satan's Eden but there's a bride who's moving to the New Jerusalem she's being quickened in this word age her heart has been quickened and she's leaving this dark L de seea and she has stepped out into the rising of the Sun the son of Liberty the son of Hope the son of righteousness has arisen there's been a change I know it's raining on the outside in this world it's dark and it's ugly and everything is wrong but in the house of God where the name of Jesus Christ is there is Safety and Security there is a light of glory and presence amen we're back here in the presence of God hallelujah this message is bringing a message of liberty no longer slaves no longer servants are you hearing me no longer slaves no longer servants the seven seal is saying it's finished it's done what held you under servitude is no longer there this is the trumpet of adoption this is the trumpet of go back to what's yours go back to your possession go back to that if you say under this mountain be moved and cast into the sea go back to your worship go back to the liberty of worshiping God by one Spirit we are baptized into the body we're not a bunch of dead intellectual church joiners we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we have went beyond the veil hey we are not a blessing bride we are not a blessing woman who has run from the bedroom of experience with our Lord but we have went behind the veil where the revelations are changing us Moment by moment our by hour glory to God Liberty that's right Liberty the ending of it this is the acceptable time this is the acceptable year no matter how long you've been in bondage no longer how long amen there was every man could go free if he wanted to go free that's right second Corinthians the third chapter Paul now listen Paul is the right don't think he wrote about it one time Paul his greatest Revelation was the spiritual adoption of the church 2 Corinthians 3 Paul said amen introducing the administration of Glory remember the changing of the administration coming to the administration of Glory not being ministers of the spirit law or the letter but Ministers of the spirit and if the administration of the law was glorious how much more Glory will it be under this administration of when the spirit writes the word in the people that's right see then he says in 2 Corinthians 3 but if the minds are blinded unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but under this today even when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart so they can they can read about it but they can't see it because the veil that's upon them but watch The Veil is upon what now watch this second Corinthians 3:15 where's the veil it's on their heart right the veil is on the heart the very next verse 2 Corinthians 3:16 but nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord I know y'all know these things when it shall turn to the Lord what is the it it when the heart when it the heart shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now now Paul amen knows very well the last Prophecy of the Old Testament was behold I will send you Elijah before the great and grateful day of the Lord and He will do what he will turn the heart of their Apostolic fathers or back to the faith of their father fathers Paul knew the hearts were going to be changed faith of the fathers now now there there's not time enough but so that you maybe catch this you can go study it amen but if you will study Abraham brother mam said actually was the true father of our faith he said see then the message actually takes us all the way back to the founding father of our faith back to an abrahamic faith is that right now you watch Abraham and Isaac when Isaac was up on the mountain with Abraham and gen Genesis 22 and he was going to be sacrificed remember now that before they ever went up there what did Abraham say he said the boy and I will go up and worship we'll go worship and then the boy and I will return amen Abraham was going to go worship under a revelation that God is going to make me sacrifice this child but even if I would kill him he's going to raise him up again because I've already received as one from the dead he was worshiping with a revelation of a Vindicated God whatever God says just do it he's got enough to make it come out we don't have to raise up Isaac he can raise Isaac up we just got to be obedient to his word when they went up there on that mountain amen and they found themselves amen up there I always wondered what in the world made Isaac laid down his life brother man said he put out them little chubby hands remember and he willingly laid down on on that altar can you imagine the story that was told him to make him give up his own life amen you you see Abraham could tell him a story in Genesis 22 that he couldn't have told in Genesis 15 or in Genesis 12 but Abraham had already lived his whole life he had already met the angel he had already talked with mecdc he had already seen a body change he had already seen ishmail come and tried it the wrong way he saw how that Isaac had come had lived with him 14 years he had a story from the front to the Finish to Quicken the faith of Isaac in one message and Isaac received the Liberty to get in his position by the preaching of a compiled message that gave him Faith a faith to lay down his life knowing God would raise it up again do you see the message of the hour on that mountain how could you ever give your life up how could you ever lay your life down but God is compiled every Revelation Through the Ages this message couldn't have been preached in no other age but right here in the end time God has took the whole story from Eden all the way to this age and tied it together and when you heard it it quickened something on the inside of you that said God I want my position I want my authority if I would just lay down my life he will raise it up again Isaac would have received Faith he would have received a faith his heart would have been turned a father's faith become a child's Faith which lifted the child to his father's understanding through the things that he heard oh Church of the Living God how is God going to get you from this Pentecostal baby stuff into the maturity of the word of God he's going to do it by the things that you heard you know what's amazing to me amen when you say something like that there's been so many Devils that's took good worship services and called it Pentecostal baby stuff until people started believing it but that ain't nothing but a bunch of devils trying to Black name the worship of Jesus Christ this has nothing to do with Pentecostal baby stuff this is what you call stimulation of a revelation the greatest Revelation that's ever struck the Earth has struck our hearts how can we sit still in such an hour as this how can we just hold our peace in an hour like this there's never been a greater word spoken to any age at any time it's running through our lives it's running through our hearts amen something raising up on the inside of us it's stimulation by re well these bunch of people drunk not like you think this is the new wine that was prophesied of the old he said with other tongues and stammering lips so I speak unto my people and are refreshing from the presence of God come on Church what did he say a refreshing from where the presence of God that's why Peter spoke in the book of Acts the third chapter and said the heavens must receive Jesus Christ until the restitution of all things and a refreshing from the presence of God the heavens has got to keep the Corporal body until the church is refreshed by the stimulation of the revelation of the wine of God you say what does that really mean that's what's going on this morning that's what it's about this morning this is not Pentecostal babies these are stimulated word believing children of God and they felt the word permeating their lives changing [Applause] them you may W you may drink some water and walk the same you ever drink some good wine and it'll change the way you walk I know I ain't got time to preach on drunk people they speak at a different octave you can hear them about two weeks down the road down y two or three blocks you can hear them talking down there like intoxication it makes things get louder amen I tell you I know you can hear me amen but there's something about a couple drunks they just start loving to shout back one another and after a while they get caught up in their own world they don't care that there's the rest of the world around them they're just intoxicated under the what they're hold of and I'll tell you this we've been sharing a bottle it's a bottle the inspiration of the Holy Ghost it's the wine of the Church of the Living God we're not here to be a bunch of stagnant cold formal worship God in every aspect of the word of God let us worship until we don't know who we are let us worship until a vibration comes from [Applause] Heaven oh [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God pass the bottle amen if you ain't having a good time get a drink it'll do you some good if you ain't enjoying this service get a drink it'll do you some good amen there ain't nothing to do you good like letting go in the presence of God you're the Sons and Daughters of God feel your Liberty feel it it's your position you are in Christ I tell you prophet of God I heard him say in position in Christ you have no right to worship outside of the body how do you get in the body by one Spirit baptized into one body if you're in his body this morning you can shout as loud as you want you can praise as loud as you want it's in order this morning brother M said at the brandom house we do certain a certain way he said in your house you do things a certain way but this is God's house under God's name and we do things a certain way worship goes up in the house of God praise goes up in the house of God this is true [Applause] worship the Turning of a heart and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to their children in the heart of the children to their fathers L I'd come and smite it all with a curse watch brother Bram stand there in India turn them people from worshiping that God of the son to worshiping the resurrected Jesus Christ watch him there in Africa a naked boy on the Chain crawled his way to the platform and them 30,000 natives that never knew about God Amen they heard the preaching of the Gospel they heard a prophet say rise up from there and he said Not only was he healed his his mind returned to him and 30,000 Hearts were turned at one [Applause] moment come on Church there's no dead letters changing this lives there's no dead letters there's no we can't put enough things together to Astound our elves to a change but the changing of the heart comes from the presence of God when God quickens a word to you it forever changes you Revelations 10 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel Jesus said the anointing of the Lord is upon me to preach the gospel the season was then it was at the time of the opening of the book the book is actually opened in the time of Revelation chap 10 but it's not revealed until the seventh angel sounds and when he begins to sound he reveals what was in the book now how does he reveal it by the preaching of the message all of your possessions is in that book when you hear the message preached from the open book you are receiving your Eternal inheritance by the word that you are believing you see why that devil don't want you to hear the preaching of this message you see why he does not want the message preached with power and inspiration amen according to Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 he's going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the heart of the children to their fathers number two he will reveal the mystery of the seven unknown thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the heart of the children back to their Pentecostal fathers amen and what's the attraction brother bam said the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10: 1-7 the last message to the last AG fulfills in this age Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man is revealed the day when the son of man is revealed do you see that Elijah the prophet has to be on the Earth when the Lord revealed RS himself to the church because he's going to reveal himself as the word and the word can only come to a prophet when Jesus went down there he went to John the Baptist remember he didn't go to the Pharisees he went to John because the word has to come to a prophet and when Jesus returned in this age in the form of a pillar of fire amen down there on that Ohio River where did he go he went to a prophet standing in the water the same as he did in the old he went to a prophet in the water he in this age went to a prophet in the water he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you've not received a tradition you've not received a man-made idea you have received the word the word has come to a prophet and the Church of the Living God is coming to the word as they're hearing the message of the [Music] hour now what's Paul he's going to tell us in this scripture 2 Corinthians 3 and: 17 for the Lord is that spirit for the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen Liberty see Liberty comes God gives Liberty isn't it amazing amen that God does not give bondage that God does not chain people down God does not bind people God does not put us in a box God gives us Liberty it's amazing because this Liberty that is given is given by the spirit of God yes sir in John chapter 4 the Bible said God is a spirit and they that worship Him worship in spirit and in truth amen it has to be spiritual truth that brings the church into true worship think of this now for the Lord the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty the Lord is the spirit of Liberty in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 the Bible says in this season that we are living the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the Lord who is that Spirit shall come from Heaven preaching a message of Liberty are you with me the the Jubilee back there in the Bible remember gave them Liberty to return to their possessions the message of the hour is a message of Liberty to return to what you were before the devil put his Filthy Hands On You to return to what God made you before the foundation of the world you were a Son of God before there was a star before there was a devil before there was a heaven before there was an angel you are already a son but this message is going to take you back back to what God made you it's a liberty to return Thank You [Applause] Lord the message is a shout I don't have to preach that to y'all y'all know that the message is a shout that's right now watch the 10th chapter in the seventh verse for in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the Mist of God should be finished as he's declared unto his servants the prophets and in the eth verse it said and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth go and take the little book amen now you have to be careful because the devil can use symbols and try to get you with an idea that there's some little book floating around that you're going to have to go take this certain kind of little book or something like that from but but think of this now the prophet of the age has come and let us know that this book was written and planned before the foundation of the world before ink and paper this book was already written and planned before the foundation of the world this book amen is the revelation of the word of that brother man says it like this what did what did Adam Lose Friends Adam lost the book he lost his image or his inheritance in life that's what he lost but the Bible said that Jesus is given back everything that Adam lost now see the sacrifice amen has already been paid for what Adam did amen but the sons of God must hear the liberty of what has been bought and paid for and the message of the hour is the preaching of the little book brother man said we don't need a new book we don't need a new Bible he said what we need is a revelation come on what we need is a revelation a revelation see if we get the Revelation oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we do not need a new Bible we do not need a new translation some are very good I'm not against them but what we need is a revelation of the spirit that's right my he says may God give us by his Spirit a continuous and lifegiving prevailing Revelation is that right Jubilee remember Jesus said not a trumpet the preaching of the Gospel in the 10th chapter in the seventh verse here is the seventh angel sounding a gospel trumpet amen bringing the church to a liberty like no other church has ever been to amen now watch brother Ram said that book of course it's a jubilee time that book has been sealed and in heaven now amen for for ages ever since Adam lost it it's been sealed it's been held back ever since the beginning but brother bam says in the breach what talk about a jubilee time when that lamb steps forward he said the books even sealed in heaven and and people are saying is my name in there I don't know I hope it is amen but if it was there it was before the foundation of the world the first thing that represented Redemption come the lamb had to be slain from the foundation of the world but then he took the book Glory he opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to the people to reveal it to the people faith is a revelation and how does faith come faith comes by the hearing of the word of God what we have received of this age is the word of God the word has come to a prophet but not just any word the word of the ages the word of redemption the word that finishes the devil the word talk about a jubilee now the prophet of God will actually he said I know they thought they fought at it and brought forth and produced things let's just read this now the messages are all kept up until the Earthly vessel until the time of God's appointed time of the last messenger of the earth an Earthly messenger see he's typing this with the day bondage of of of of Babylon he sold his land remember and they took the the the the price and the property and they put it in an earn vessel and they kept it there until the time they returned see because though they've been in Babylon 70 years when they returned to Israel they got their land back they got their possessions back that's right remember that was under zeru when he restored the temple they broke those Earth and vessels that held those messages of possession and when the vessel was broken right the message that was in it was a message of of legal inheritance of legal possession brother M said this title deed has been CT until an Earthly vessel until a seventh Earthly Angel shows up the message he is carrying is a message of inheritance a message of legal rights a message to return to everything that God gave you do you see something happening this morning this message is not a message of bondage it's a message message of Liberty it's a message of truth it's a message of legal rights then that means only one person owns that property and the devil said he owns it but God said he owns it do you see what it is that means the day of the devil is finished his claims do not stand in the presence of this message under a Pentecostal message he can hold you under a Baptist message he can hold you but under the sounding of the seventh Earthly message his claims has finished the devil doesn't have a claim on the church no legal rights at all I don't have to preach one Baptist message I don't have to preach one Presbyterian message I don't have to preach one idea of man he has no rights this message of the hour is a message of redemption whatever the message says about you that is the truth how's this thing coming to us it's brought To Us by Revelation from the hand of God by Vindication God vindicates his word that's the Revelation you're accepting you see John come here and take the book which Revelation should I take the one Vindicated see because there's a lot of Revelations but the one we want is the Vindicated one that's the one that comes from God because God never sends just a word he sends a Vindicated word Jesus is the Vindicated word when you receive a Vindicated word you are receiving the Lord you're not just receiving a word you're receiving a Vindicated word which is Christ amen amen amen do you see in the seven seal brother Ram gets done and he actually closes saying praise God does everybody understand he says congregation say Amen does everybody believe remember I started who hath believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed do you see what it is amen God came into the world look back there in John Christ came into the world and the world knew him not and the world received him not but as many as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God can you say power power to become what Sons sons of God now you might think that that that's a Greek word you got to watch those Greek words cuz power means different things in this Greek word is escusa which means Authority and he gave them Authority maybe we'll use one of the other words he gave them Liberty it actually means power it means Authority right Liberty or strength do you see what it is as many as received him this revelation of the open book as many as received him to them he gave authority to be the sons of God and we'll say it like this he gave them Liberty and where the spirit of God is there is liberty liberty for what Liberty to be the sons of God Liberty to come to adoption Liberty to return to what God has promised for you now now I'm not I'm not losing my mind watch Galatians the 4th chapter I say this in the first verse that an heir as long as a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen he differs nothing from a servant he has no Liberty as a servant but under the tutors and governs until the time appointed of the father does God have a time until the appointed time what did the breach say the time appointed was when the seventh Earthly vessel came that was the appointed time there's where the Liberty is going to come under that message look at what he said even so when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them under the law that we might receive that we might receive Liberty that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons all right God has sent forth the spirit of his son in your hearts crying Abby father where thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ then if you're not a servant anymore what are you you're a son and if you're a son then you're Heir what are you heir of everything that God gave Jesus he gave the Church of the Living God you are a joint heir to every promise then in Mark 11 when Jesus cursed that fig tree he was not cursing a fig tree to show his power he was actually cursing a fig tree to show what the church was air of in their days of Liberty come on friend there's never been another church performed those things there's never been another age when they had those kinds of things in the church but under the message of the hour there was actually five manifestations of the third pool right now don't don't leave me yet five manifestations of the third pool watch brother Ram spoke squirrels amen six of them were actually spoken two different times amen we found that he actually stood on a mountain and told a storm to go back where it came from he stood there in his bedroom and cursed a cursed a tumor that was on his wife miles away and said before the doctor ever touches her the cancer will be gone he stood in a boat over a little dead fish that had been dead a half hour and by the quick and activated word of God he said fish I give you life in the name of Jesus Christ and the fish come back to life again oh my nothing greater than the last one when hady right was sitting there in agreement with the word in agreement with the word she heard about the manifestation of the third pull and it did not choke her and it did not settle her down amen she wasn't a resenting Spirit she was not a resenting Spirit she had a receiving spirit and she said brother brandom how did that happen and he said sister I can only tell you that he is Jehovah Gyra the same one that brought that real for Abraham brought that for me he is Jehovah Gyra and in an agreement to him she said that's nothing but the truth brother brandham and something I love he said the greatest anointing I ever felt in my life come right then when that bride agreed with that third pool manifestation there was an agreement that brought a connection between that bride and that word manifested and it released an atomic power that was in the and that girl heard a prophet say whatever you say Haddie I have got permission from God to speak it whatever you say and you know what she said don't you come on come on parents you know what she said she said give me the life of them two boys and it shook the corridors of hell that morning because somebody was announcing devil you're finished there's a bride who received its Liberty there's a bride taking her Liberty she said them were my possessions and I'm not just a servant I'm a daughter of God I'm not just a child I'm a mature child in the presence of God me tell you something this morning you ever catch a revelation of what this message has give you when you come in agreement with it you're receiving Liberty to speak a word you're receiving Liberty to bind Devils you're receiving Liberty to tell the lame to get up and walk and the blind to see you are receiving a liberty that will tear down the gates of hell and Destroy every devil I know what I'm talking about I've met Devils on the field in India I've met them in Africa I've met them in America and there ain't no no devil there ain't no power there's nothing can stand before this message that I'm [Applause] preaching as long as you're a servant you're under a bondage what B of bondage are you under well I don't know if I don't know if they could be saved I I've seen them laughing at the prophet maybe they've blasphemed the Holy Ghost I don't know I seen him out there drinking the other day I don't know how anybody could ever get saved and out there drink I don't know I I I tell you what I I tell you what I did the other day I I didn't do this right I got a bad attitude and said something wrong I don't know if the Lord's going to honor it now and I don't know I don't know if it's going to happen you see the bondage you're coming under cuz you're pointing everything to your ability you're pointing everything to who you are and what you are in this life but I'm talking to you about another book I'm not talking about the book of this life I'm talking about a Lamb's Book of Life That's Eternal in the heavens that God is reading out of that book and totally ignoring you you are not going to do this this is the Lord's doing this is what God is doing he's bringing a liberty to you to believe for this thing to believe whatsoever you say Galatians 1 position in Christ brother bam says it he says galatian gives a picture of how we were under tutors the child was born became a son very moment he was in the family now there was a tutor over this boy to educate and raise him and we have no more than a servant said galatian letter until that time and Age come a certain limited time that was set and that tutor would always take the father and your son is progressing right or whatever it was he says I'm not disagreeing with my dear brother but take it from someone who loves you there's where Pentecost failed to see this if the ho the Holy Spirit may be not willing to give it then look when you're born again of the Holy Ghost you say that's it brother it was you was a child you was just as much child as you're ever going to be you're born in the family but the tutor which is the holy spirit has watched over the church in its maturing now if the tutor natural went to the father and said this boy's not doing very good I teach him but he won't listen he's headstrong he won't listen he's going this way or going that watch him placing all of that with him listening how is that boy getting from servitude to sunship he's listening to the tutor he's receiving the instructions of his Liberty do you see what he's doing the tutor is moving him from the way a child thinks to the way his father thinks this message is moving you from the way you think about yourself the way you think about others into what God thinks how God does how you're seeing Heaven's point of view in the spiritual sense we are actually born into Christ we become children of God God knows best here's where I say reverently not to disagree with my lattering brother lattering Brethren you think I'm persecuting the church no dear brother I'm not you see this boy after he got to a certain age he had to be adopted into the family he was borned into a minister knows that is the placing of the sons do you see that Ephesians chapter 1 you're actually predestinated unto the adoption of Sons that's what you're predestinated to God didn't Destin you to the Pentecostal age he didn't Destin you to no Ruan age he destined you unto the adoption of sons when does the adoption come at the appointed time the time of Liberty the time of maturity the time of a message of the hour according to Romans chapter 8 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed in into the image of his son into the image of his son now Jesus amen he never sent down a picture like we have of the hofman head or here at the marriage supper he never said now you all get your hair like this and get your robe like this and this is what I want you to come to but in second Peter chapter 1 he outlaid what a true mature son would be giving him Seven Virtues with a topping of Christ as his Capstone is that right which brings a child Liberty and we can announc according to 1 John chapter 3 the Bible said when he shall appear we shall be is that an image I guess we shall be in His image we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is how are we seeing this by the revelation of the word we are seeing what God really is and we're coming into that image of what he has given the prophet will announce it and he he'll say we are now the Sons and Daughters of God we are right now the Sons and Daughters of God you got to be careful as you hear a prophet say this because he's not saying we are now servants he said we are now Sons we are right now Sons and Daughters of God sitting together in Heavenly places amen right now every man woman boy that's born again of God receive the Holy Spirit setting in Heavenly places and gathered together in Christ amen watch what he says see that that God is putting you here he says it like this now and God's covenant with Abraham some people goes by feeling they say I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved but the devil can beat you around the stump every day on that now he's teaching us something is he bringing this to Liberty the devil can beat you some people goes by their feeling I'm not saved because I I feel like I'm saved or the devil can beat you on the stump every day but I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved because I met God's requirement God called me and I accepted it and by faith I believe it and whether I feel good or whether I feel like it or not I am anyhow cuz God said so do you see where your Liberty is God said so do you see where sunship is God said so Abraham he said I know what it looks like but God said so Noah said it looks like this but God said so Jesus said God said so do you see the difference it's not what I feel it's what God Said God said sa God said this Bride is a spotless virgin bride not what I see not what I think it's what God Said God said so you are now a Son of God in the house of God as a part of God's economy Romans 88 chapter 1 there is now no more condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus there is now can you say now right now there is now no more condemnation we are in Christ no condemnation no bondage we are living in Liberty watch what he said for they are dead to the world alive in him living in this present day making the word God has used them and for dained them placing their names in the Lamb's Book of Life and from when the waters come upon that seed that's in your heart it raises up the bride of Christ just as perfect as in every age see the lutherans under justification the feet raised like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostal under the arms the works and deeds and so forth to the calvinist or had to be Armenian so they could be legalist but now we come to the Head the Capstone crying Grace Grace the Capstone cry The Headstone crying Grace Grace passed from Creed unto the Living Word of the Living God pass from Death unto life pass from Creed unto the Living Word of the Living God you see already set it in Heavenly places alive right now with every word of God subject to us we have been actually quickened in this word age to believe these things that we are believing I'm closing right here let's take this just as a thought brother B said we go back through last Sunday for it is impossible for man that once tasted of the Heavenly gifts to fall away and again to renew himself under repentance absolutely totally impossible isn't that amazing for he that is born of God does not and cannot commit sin for the seed of God remains in him first John chapter 3 right I'm just going to read the prophet for the seed of God is the word of God yes sir and Faith cometh by the hearing of the word the sacrifice was made it's all over do you see what he's saying if you do wrong God will make you pay for it that's simple enough isn't it if you do wrong god'll make you pay for it but if you do it willingly now see you don't do it willingly do you know you really a Christian don't willfully do things wrong they just don't amen they actually do things right if they do something wrong they didn't mean to do that if you see now this is a very powerful thing for if we sin willfully after we've receive the knowledge of the truth now watch what he says be real careful and listen to him if we sin willfully After we receive the knowledge of truth but after you're once born you have the truth now watch people try to take that once that you've received knowledge of the truth and sin willfully there's no more sacrifice watch brother brandom separate you from that scripture he says you're not receiving the knowledge of Truth you have been born and received the truth see what he's saying not the knowledge of it but you have accepted the truth and it's already become a reality you're a child of God for Time and Eternity God swore what he would do see he that heareth my words and believeth upon him that sent me hath everlasting life and I will raise him up and he will never come into judgment for them that are in Christ shall not come into condemnation look what he's saying for it is impossible for God to lie do you see where he places it amen if a man it would be impossible for him to do it brother said because it's impossible for God to lie if God said once a man has received truth he has passed from Death unto life he shall not come into condemnation then you can't take Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 10 and take this bride and put her in Hell she's already bypassed the tribulation she's already bypassed she is not in bondage any longer she has come into a liberty I'm not living every day of my life wondering if I'm going to do something and end up in Hell come on church if a man can make a sin that he can pass the day of Grace and God don't deal with him anymore if a man can go there then a man can go to a place with God that he can never come back again come on church this message took us to a place where a prophet would announce the day of sin is finished you're not going out and coming back and going out and coming back but a man whoever comes in he come into the liberty of God he will abide in the presence of God forever do you see what it is this morning we are already in the presence of God not you're going to be you are right now right now you're in the presence of God oh if I could just vibrate that into your heart this morning that the way you know it is by the message of the Hour come on this message has brought you what you can't see Amen brother es side just beyond the veil brother Ram said there's a he said there was a bunch of Believers over there white robed already that's what he said and in Matthew chapter 8 the Bible said we have an Angel that's before the face of the father somebody said what Angel is that brother brandom he said that's your theophany and it's already in the presence of God right now that's why he said to them that I forn know I have already glorified amen you cannot be lost no more than the god of Heaven could be lost he is there in the presence of God hey we are coming into Liberty this message is bringing us to Liberty don't you try to bind me up and say I ain't got no theophany of course I have a theophany I already heard from it this message brought to me don't bind me up and say that we ain't got a liberty in the house of God to worship and praise and enjoy ourselves listen we ain't going down to no bar we ain't going to a bunch of ball games but we come to the house of God and let the glory roll brother let the Holy Ghost come and rejoice and worship in the presence of [Applause] God I know it ain't popular with the world but we ain't the world so brother Wayne I think y'all's crazy well that's all right there's a bunch of ball Fanatics I'm just a Jesus fanatic that's right somebody the other day we was down there in Pigeon Forge and he a sister I won't tell her name y'all probably if she was there you know who she was and she was jumping up and shouting and rejoicing after the service somebody said brother Wayne if you don't know it I think that sister enjoys your preaching she was shouting rejoicing up them somebody said well I don't think women ought to be up there dancing like that I said listen I don't mean to be rude but that's all that woman's got in her life her husband beat her and left her she she ain't got nothing in this world she ain't got nobody to love her she ain't got nobody to be with her and she gets in these messages night and day and then she comes into a message and hears the message preached and she lets go and live there ain't nothing else she's living for but the moment that explosion happens in her heart brother I don't know about you but that's what I'm living for I'm not living for just a worship service but brother one of these days the worship service is going to turn into a meeting in the air this old body is going to change and we're going to leave here hallelujah amen it's finished devil devil you're finished you're over you're defeated thou demon of unbelief you lost your [Applause] power I'm not wor from one day to the next if I'm going to make it come on because it's not me that makes it it's not me paid for it it's not me it's not mine it's what God did for me and the only way I can do it is by receiving what he said about it and I accept it this morning receive your Liberty if our musicians could come today receive your Liberty [Applause] receive your [Applause] Liberty [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] H you're the Mighty [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah you're welcome to stand your feet with us if you want God oh we receive our Liberty we receive our Liberty Oh Glory thank you for your hallelu oh my hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord do you believe it's a Year of Jubilee Glory what's the requirement to have Liberty hear the horn what's the requirement today hear the message he that heareth my word now some people take that carnal as they could be but that wasn't what he meant he that hears hears hears understands quickened a quickened word pass you left that old Creed you come into the Living Word brother Braham said that Paul was quickened he was so quickened from the law to Grace that in 1 Corinthians 15 he said he had the victory he said death has been swallowed up by Victory and he was actually talking about being quickened from the law to Grace there's nothing left of the law in me can you think of that this morning quickened quickened out of that quickened out of that Pentecostal age into the Living Word of Life brother I tell you the greatest thing you ever done is believe this message you'll find more Liberty in the words of this message than anywhere you'll ever read what other word could completely take your past and throw it away come on I have never read no other messages where a man could say that Jesus Took took your sins take it out of the Book of Malachi he wasn't just he was in The Book of Micah he wasn't just playing it was in the scripture and take your sins and he said he cast them into the Sea's forgiveness but see most people teach the blood and they just taught a chemical blood but this Prophet taught a blood that's a spirit and he said the blood is the spirit of God so he said he created a way to destroy your sins which was the works of the devil that they wouldn't even be remembered in the mind of God now he's trying to call you up out of your mind into his mind where your thoughts will become his thoughts and when your thoughts you start thinking like he thinks you're going to start walking like an adopted son talking like an adopted son cuz that's the only way he ever saw you he never saw you as a kid he never saw you that way he didn't look at you that way he saw the end thank you Father he saw the end you got something oh my God if I knew how to sing it I'd sing this is the Year of Jubilee but I don't know it do you know it do you know the

brother Joshua ministering and he brought out about that dance and about the victory I don't know where that young man is this morning with brother Jacob grills I was sitting pretty close toward the

[Music] [Applause] we need to uh kind of move along but anyway uh I don't say this the wrong way but after this service today I I can't even comprehend it all to be honest with you it was moving so fast I mean he preached four hours in one but really uh I don't say this bad right but there was so much in this meeting and I don't say this bad I better explain myself but years ago we had a brother from overseas and and that's why he's my friend and everything and and and for two or three years later people were still asking for CDs I want this one to be available we don't make an archive in our or a tape library of a ministers we have I mean Benjamin and Elma keep them put out a few CDs but I'm honest as the pastor here I want this meeting to be available that we can hear it we can hear it those that want to hear it over and catch some of those fine things that even I missed that was in this [Applause] meeting let me make one correction on the meetings coming up Saturday and when brother Ron's here it's then it's all been sent out the invitation it's 6:30 Saturday not 7 6:30 so forgive me for that but anyway that's a correction so make sure you don't show at 7 come at 6:30 this Saturday and then I forget the DAT of beon it's the last Saturday and Sunday I think of the month amen so listen folks those that uh like Benjamin said everybody's invited those that didn't know about it uh we'll have food uh and I I could say follow somebody if you don't know the way but it's pretty simple go West on State Route 30 go to wak Road it's a sign in there a green sign wac Road make a left go about a half mile and you'll see a barn and you'll see all kinds of cars there you're welcome and we really need we we haven't got time to visit here now grab your food whatever you got and we need to go because uh it's hard for me to predict you know to the to the man that's fixing the meat he said well what time are you going to so I told him between 2:30 and 3: so we got 20 minute drive your sister need to work as hard as you can to get your food on the [Applause] table Hallelujah get it yes sir I know you know sometimes you know my my family said don't worry you know he said
