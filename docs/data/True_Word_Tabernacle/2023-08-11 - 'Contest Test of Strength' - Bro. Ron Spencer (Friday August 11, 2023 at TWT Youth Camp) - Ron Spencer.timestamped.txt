[1:06:44] he saw this baby before the foundation
[1:06:47] in the world

[1:06:53] Satan did everything he could to stop
[1:06:55] you
[1:06:57] you joined hands

[1:07:45] him maybe you thought I'd like to have a
[1:07:47] special child

[1:15:07] melanoma and we take chemo every day and
[1:15:10] and just to make sure that Satan showed
[1:15:13] up after this service last night was the
[1:15:15] worst night that I've had in three and a
[1:15:17] half years but you know that just goes

[1:15:46] if you poke a Believer long enough
[1:15:48] you'll get a fight
[1:15:52] amen amen the Lord laid on my heart
[1:15:56] tonight to speak on
[1:15:58] the contest
[1:16:02] a test between strengths
[1:16:06] amen I find it interesting that our
[1:16:10] messenger of the day brother Branham was
[1:16:13] a boxer
[1:16:16] he's not only fought Satan but he was a
[1:16:18] boxer
[1:16:20] and he knew how to fight
[1:16:23] so as his understudies
[1:16:27] we're also boxers
[1:16:30] not just men
[1:16:32] but there's some ladies in the room at
[1:16:34] Satan's absolutely terrified of
[1:16:38] so
[1:16:40] let's just dedicate this service to
[1:16:43] whipping the devil would that be all
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:53] amen
[1:16:57] Psalms chapter 23 if you'd like to turn
[1:17:00] there with me
[1:17:02] you know it by heart since you was a
[1:17:04] child
[1:17:08] the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[1:17:11] want
[1:17:13] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:17:15] Pastures then he leadeth me beside of
[1:17:17] the Still Waters
[1:17:18] he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me
[1:17:21] in the past of righteousness for his
[1:17:23] name's sake and yea though I walked
[1:17:25] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:17:27] death I will fear no evil I like that I
[1:17:29] will fear no evil
[1:17:31] in the Valley of the shadow of death for
[1:17:34] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[1:17:36] they comfort me thou prepares the table
[1:17:39] before me in the presence of mine
[1:17:41] enemies
[1:17:42] thou Upon Us my head with all in my cup
[1:17:45] runneth over
[1:17:46] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:17:48] me all the days of my life and now comes
[1:17:52] the Covenant and I will dwell in the
[1:17:54] house of the Lord forever
[1:17:57] you may be seated
[1:18:02] brother Branham said that Satan took
[1:18:06] Jesus up on the mountain and set him
[1:18:08] down
[1:18:11] and he rebuked him again with the word
[1:18:15] defeated Satan with the word of God
[1:18:19] now he brings you into the equation
[1:18:22] showing that the weakest of Christian
[1:18:26] and you may feel like well brother Ron I
[1:18:28] feel like the weakest in this building
[1:18:30] well you're still involved the weakest
[1:18:33] of Christian can defeat Satan with thus
[1:18:36] saith the Lord it is written it is
[1:18:39] written it is written
[1:18:44] he could have took his power he could
[1:18:46] have he could have took a lot of of his
[1:18:48] gift but he took the word that you would
[1:18:51] have to use
[1:18:52] knowing that as a Believer you would
[1:18:54] follow his pattern and his example it is
[1:18:57] written it is written it is written
[1:19:01] it's not written by prophets it's
[1:19:03] written by God it's our covenant it is
[1:19:06] the infinite word of God
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:12] Revelations chapter 12 and verse 7 and
[1:19:15] there was war in heaven
[1:19:17] and Michael and his angels fought
[1:19:19] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:19:21] and his angels and Prevail not
[1:19:24] neither was there found any place found
[1:19:29] any more in heaven and the dragon was
[1:19:33] cast out of that old serpent called the
[1:19:35] devil
[1:19:37] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[1:19:41] was cast out into the Earth
[1:19:44] and his angels were cast out to him
[1:19:49] and I heard a great loud voice saying in
[1:19:52] heaven I like this I heard a great loud
[1:19:56] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:19:59] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:20:01] of our God and the power of His Christ
[1:20:05] Hallelujah I want you to read this with
[1:20:08] me now for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:20:11] is cast down
[1:20:13] which accused them before our God day
[1:20:16] and night and they overcame him
[1:20:21] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:20:24] of their testimony
[1:20:31] and they love not their lives unto death
[1:20:34] I want you to read this and make it
[1:20:36] personal now these first phrases and
[1:20:40] they overcame him
[1:20:42] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:20:45] of their testimony
[1:20:47] I want you to realize there's these are
[1:20:49] some things that you already know you've
[1:20:51] heard it don't never let it become a
[1:20:54] lyric or just a fable to you but you are
[1:20:58] the final voice
[1:20:59] [Applause]
[1:21:01] you are the final voice to the final age
[1:21:05] nobody can take your place
[1:21:09] when God was laying out who would be and
[1:21:11] when they would be and what time that
[1:21:13] they would be born in what age if they
[1:21:15] would be born God chose you to be the
[1:21:19] final voice to the final Edge
[1:21:22] people from all the ages if they would
[1:21:24] have been given a choice they would have
[1:21:26] took your place
[1:21:28] but God reserves your position
[1:21:31] thank you
[1:21:33] he reserved your position
[1:21:38] he has gathered you you are not an
[1:21:41] accident
[1:21:43] he has gathered you and he has called
[1:21:46] you an invincible Army on the Earth
[1:21:50] because you will discern and withstand
[1:21:57] now I want to just ask you now
[1:22:00] who gathered us here
[1:22:04] who has gathered us here who has watched
[1:22:08] over our Gene seeds since the foundation
[1:22:11] of the Earth
[1:22:12] when marriages would happen and this one
[1:22:15] would marry this one when Wars would
[1:22:17] take place when plagues would happen
[1:22:21] God watched over your natural seed
[1:22:25] one in a million throughout every
[1:22:27] generation
[1:22:29] he had a photo of you before the
[1:22:32] foundation of the world you're
[1:22:34] wonderfully and fearfully made
[1:22:39] thank you
[1:22:44] he has gathered us he has placed us he
[1:22:48] has elected us he didn't just do it to
[1:22:51] see if he could do it
[1:22:53] he's got you here for a purpose
[1:22:56] more than just said in a meeting more
[1:22:58] than just set on a Pew but God has
[1:23:01] raised you up to destroy the works of
[1:23:04] the devil
[1:23:09] I'd like to say this to you Satan is in
[1:23:12] trouble
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:15] Satan is in trouble
[1:23:17] knowing that you have arrived
[1:23:20] and he hasn't been able to stop you for
[1:23:23] thousands of years of your arrival
[1:23:27] [Applause]
[1:23:29] if he couldn't stop you for those
[1:23:31] thousands of years how can he stop you
[1:23:34] now
[1:23:44] I believe the redeemed ought to say so
[1:23:47] I believe we ought to speak it I believe
[1:23:49] we ought to say Amen to it
[1:23:52] I would like to remind Satan he cannot
[1:23:55] stop this end time Revival
[1:24:03] this moment has been designed and
[1:24:06] preserved for you
[1:24:11] God has orchestrated even where you set
[1:24:15] what you're wearing
[1:24:19] he has prepared this moment he has
[1:24:22] watched over our Prophet stood there and
[1:24:26] knew that the seeds were coming
[1:24:28] as he preached sermons and felt the
[1:24:31] rejection of the message of the hour
[1:24:34] no wonder God had to take him beyond the
[1:24:37] curtain of time
[1:24:38] and millions would scream we're rushing
[1:24:41] on it
[1:24:41] [Applause]
[1:24:45] are you with me maybe even as he
[1:24:47] preached here there would just be a
[1:24:49] handful of people that would catch the
[1:24:51] message but God knew you were coming
[1:24:55] he knew you would be born in total
[1:24:57] darkness to where and even a prophet of
[1:24:59] God couldn't see past
[1:25:02] but God designed you and God built you
[1:25:05] to live in this age
[1:25:13] so we would call this that you are the
[1:25:16] final runners
[1:25:20] and God designs his best to run at the
[1:25:23] end that's not a stone's throw at
[1:25:25] anybody else that's lived down to an
[1:25:27] edge they overcame in their age
[1:25:32] but now's our turn
[1:25:35] so I'd like to say this let's finish it
[1:25:46] let me just say no matter what Satan
[1:25:48] Whispers in your ear
[1:25:50] we will not be shaken
[1:25:54] we will not turn around
[1:25:56] we will not be defeated
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:00] we are a chosen generation
[1:26:03] you're a generation with purpose
[1:26:06] the message is more than books and tapes
[1:26:09] but it's living reality living on the
[1:26:11] inside of you
[1:26:15] what God has started he will finish it
[1:26:20] okay
[1:26:25] I want you to think about that
[1:26:28] your pastor brother Wayne spoke it this
[1:26:30] weekend maybe for
[1:26:32] the visitors nothing but you're the
[1:26:34] spoken seed word of God
[1:26:38] as I heard him speak that to you you're
[1:26:41] the spoken word see
[1:26:43] God spoke you into existence
[1:26:48] he spoke a message that you would catch
[1:26:51] a host of
[1:26:53] more than a script for an actor but it
[1:26:56] became real life
[1:27:00] you come from many different diverse
[1:27:03] places
[1:27:04] God didn't put us all in the same church
[1:27:07] no wonder Satan has such a hard time
[1:27:12] you don't need a thousand people to
[1:27:14] crack you up
[1:27:18] you may be one in a million one in your
[1:27:21] family
[1:27:23] you may be the only youth in your church
[1:27:26] let me just say this to you God trusts
[1:27:29] you
[1:27:30] he's not looking for your seed that he
[1:27:32] trusts he trusts the Jean seed of God
[1:27:35] that he put inside of you before the
[1:27:37] foundation of the world
[1:27:42] so with that in mind we recognize that
[1:27:44] the weakest of Christians
[1:27:47] shake the kingdom of hell when you go on
[1:27:50] your knees and begin to pray
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:54] now let me just say nobody can take your
[1:27:57] place
[1:27:59] and neither can you take somebody else's
[1:28:01] place God's got a job for you to do
[1:28:07] if you can sing sink
[1:28:11] if you're called to preach preach if
[1:28:14] you're called to clap your hands clap
[1:28:16] your hands
[1:28:23] but none of us have been called to be a
[1:28:26] bunch of sissified
[1:28:28] panty waste
[1:28:30] Church mice we have come to the house of
[1:28:33] the Lord to worship God and to let him
[1:28:36] know we're here and to tell Satan what
[1:28:39] side that we are on
[1:28:45] foreign
[1:28:54] 27 said the Lord is my light and my
[1:28:57] salvation
[1:28:58] Whom Shall I Fear
[1:29:01] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:29:03] whom shall I be afraid
[1:29:05] when the wicked even mine enemies Came
[1:29:08] Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled
[1:29:10] and fell though a host should encamp
[1:29:12] against me my heart shall not fill
[1:29:15] though War should rise against me and
[1:29:17] this will I be confident one thing that
[1:29:20] I have desired of the Lord that will I
[1:29:22] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:29:24] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:29:27] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:29:29] inquire in his Temple for in the time of
[1:29:32] trouble
[1:29:34] he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the
[1:29:37] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:29:39] me and he shall set me upon a rock and
[1:29:42] now shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:29:44] enemies round about me therefore will I
[1:29:47] offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:29:50] joy
[1:29:53] so no matter how bad you have to fight
[1:29:56] the devil all week long
[1:29:58] when you show up at church
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:03] you have a license to Worship the Lord
[1:30:18] hear O Lord when I cry with my voice
[1:30:21] have mercy upon me and answer me when
[1:30:24] thou set us seek ye my face and my heart
[1:30:27] shall said unto thee thy face will Lord
[1:30:31] will I seek hide not thy face far from
[1:30:34] me
[1:30:35] put not thy servant away in Anger for
[1:30:38] thou has been my help leave me not
[1:30:41] neither forsake me oh god of my
[1:30:43] salvation when my father and mother
[1:30:45] forsake me then the Lord will will take
[1:30:48] me up teach me thy way O Lord and Lead
[1:30:51] Me in the playing path because of mine
[1:30:53] enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the
[1:30:56] will of mine enemies I like this
[1:30:58] for false Witnesses are risen up against
[1:31:01] me and we can say amen and such a
[1:31:04] breathe out cruelty notice these words I
[1:31:08] had fainted
[1:31:11] unless I believe to see the goodness of
[1:31:14] the Lord in the land of the living
[1:31:18] I'm not trusting in my own energies or
[1:31:21] My Own Strength
[1:31:24] wait on the Lord and be of good courage
[1:31:29] and he shall strengthen thine heart wait
[1:31:33] I say on the Lord
[1:31:38] a contest
[1:31:40] a contest is a strength
[1:31:43] it's a test of strength
[1:31:47] a test of strength
[1:31:49] Indian tradition says that they would
[1:31:52] the strongest
[1:31:54] would pull on two different sides of
[1:31:57] maybe a rope or a pull or a a pole
[1:32:01] and they would pull the other one Into
[1:32:04] the Fire
[1:32:06] so what I'm going to do here tonight
[1:32:09] is I'm going to challenge you
[1:32:14] two different ways
[1:32:16] if you were backslidden or you don't
[1:32:18] know God I want to pull you into the
[1:32:20] Holy Ghost Fire
[1:32:23] and if the devil has showed up for the
[1:32:25] meeting I want to pull him into the fire
[1:32:39] we must be determined
[1:32:43] don't never be defeated
[1:32:45] you can't be defeated this is a direct
[1:32:48] quote you're the children of God
[1:32:51] promised the Holy Spirit to every
[1:32:54] believer
[1:32:56] so if you're here tonight and you say
[1:32:58] well I don't know if I've got the Holy
[1:33:00] Ghost this is your night
[1:33:03] you're fighting against the darkness and
[1:33:05] even your self-will but God is
[1:33:08] determined and it's promised you that
[1:33:12] you can have the very life of God living
[1:33:15] on the inside of it
[1:33:18] because you can't overcome on your own
[1:33:22] you can't overcome in your own in your
[1:33:25] own theology or your own intellect or
[1:33:29] your own self-will but with him living
[1:33:32] on the inside of you you can't lose
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:46] brother Brown said no your enemy
[1:33:49] trained for the contest
[1:33:51] and you're going to have to you're going
[1:33:53] to have to meet him
[1:33:55] he says
[1:33:57] and know him
[1:33:59] know what his strength is
[1:34:01] and when you train for this contest you
[1:34:04] know you're going to meet him
[1:34:06] for it's one thing's for sure you're
[1:34:08] going to meet him so you've got to train
[1:34:09] for the contest
[1:34:11] not training for a contest is like a
[1:34:13] boxer
[1:34:14] his enemy that he's going to meet out
[1:34:18] there in in the contest he will fight a
[1:34:21] really good fighter usually knows and
[1:34:24] studies his opponent he studies his lips
[1:34:27] knows
[1:34:29] where he's fighting for whether he leans
[1:34:31] forward or hangs back fights
[1:34:34] right-handed or left-handed
[1:34:36] he studies him he studies all of this
[1:34:40] and then if he's a good smart fighter he
[1:34:43] gets him a sparring partner that'll
[1:34:46] fight just like his opponent will fight
[1:34:49] for he knows all of his lips and when he
[1:34:52] gets to that place
[1:34:54] now he says I think it's a very good
[1:34:56] thing for a Christian to do
[1:34:58] if you want to start training you start
[1:35:00] with John 3 16 the Golden Rule
[1:35:03] he says start out right
[1:35:06] that you'll get on the right floor and
[1:35:08] then you train you you train for The
[1:35:11] Knockout punches
[1:35:13] because you're going to have to use them
[1:35:15] everybody knows that you have to train
[1:35:17] to to hit your enemy and always God uses
[1:35:21] his word and just remember
[1:35:24] that God uses his word to fit the
[1:35:26] internet
[1:35:27] if God could think or could have give
[1:35:30] his people anything better to defeat the
[1:35:33] enemy with he would have done it
[1:35:37] so as I have always said when God makes
[1:35:40] a decision that's the best that there is
[1:35:44] he never has to alter his decisions
[1:35:48] so it's the first decision that God gave
[1:35:50] these people in the Garden of Eden to
[1:35:52] combat the enemy was his word
[1:35:55] they were fortified with the word now
[1:35:58] the enemy is going to study the strategy
[1:36:00] with the word
[1:36:01] and now Satan studied all of that out so
[1:36:04] so perfectly when he come to Eve he had
[1:36:07] the best strategy that he could use upon
[1:36:10] her and that's to reason with the word
[1:36:12] now you never want to reason with the
[1:36:15] word
[1:36:17] just believe it
[1:36:19] [Applause]
[1:36:21] don't try to explain it
[1:36:24] don't try to figure it out you can't
[1:36:27] figure out God so God is the word and he
[1:36:30] made it for you
[1:36:32] just to believe
[1:36:34] that's our strength
[1:36:39] just accept the word
[1:36:42] brother Ron that sounds so simple well
[1:36:44] I'm gonna get to you
[1:36:47] brother Brandon being a boxer
[1:36:50] he talked about a man that would train
[1:36:52] him
[1:36:53] six seconds Smith
[1:36:56] he said when I first started training
[1:36:58] for boxing
[1:37:00] before I got to into the professional
[1:37:02] fighting there used to be a trainer
[1:37:05] and they called him six seconds Smith
[1:37:08] the reason they called him that because
[1:37:10] he knocked out his opponents in six
[1:37:13] seconds so there was somebody before
[1:37:16] Mike Tyson
[1:37:21] and he would hit him so hard
[1:37:23] Telly would knock through the ropes all
[1:37:26] four ropes
[1:37:28] he would knock him and knock him so hard
[1:37:30] until
[1:37:31] brother Branham would fly over into the
[1:37:34] chairs
[1:37:37] and he's told him he said six
[1:37:40] he said you just knocked the breath out
[1:37:42] of me
[1:37:45] he said I just about broke my back
[1:37:49] and six second told him said it'll do
[1:37:52] you good
[1:37:55] do me good how can it do me good you're
[1:37:59] about to kill me
[1:38:00] he said look Billy
[1:38:02] I don't care how physically fit you are
[1:38:06] your bodies got to be able to stand and
[1:38:09] come back quick
[1:38:11] you got to be able to take the punch
[1:38:14] if you're if your body's not used to
[1:38:17] coming back you'll lay there and and
[1:38:19] take the count
[1:38:21] but if your body's used to taking it
[1:38:24] then you'll come back
[1:38:27] every time you get hit that shocks the
[1:38:30] blood and it runs it right back to the
[1:38:32] heart
[1:38:34] said if you do that then your body's
[1:38:37] used to coming by quick and when you get
[1:38:40] knocked down
[1:38:41] you'll get back on your feet of death
[1:38:49] he said you may Hate Me Now
[1:38:52] but you'll appreciate me
[1:38:54] when you get out there in the ring
[1:39:00] now brother Brandon we don't leave that
[1:39:02] in the boxing ring
[1:39:04] he said but I found something
[1:39:06] you don't have to Baby around with
[1:39:09] believers
[1:39:10] just pour it on
[1:39:13] you'll appreciate me when you're when
[1:39:15] you come to Calvary
[1:39:17] when they come to the end of your road
[1:39:19] you'll praise God
[1:39:21] I'm glad that I took that old rugged way
[1:39:24] here I stand with the blood wash of the
[1:39:27] Lamb
[1:39:30] you don't have to Baby around them old
[1:39:32] creeks and things out there come on get
[1:39:34] in the way
[1:39:35] God has a way he's got a plan it was
[1:39:38] wrote right there in the Bible
[1:39:43] oh don't you love it
[1:39:45] now brother Brandon was praying and he's
[1:39:47] praying against the enemy
[1:39:50] and he says Satan
[1:39:52] you can't hold them no more
[1:39:55] they're God's children right now
[1:39:58] and I'm bringing them before you
[1:40:01] you have to take your hand off of their
[1:40:03] lives they belong to God now and I claim
[1:40:06] them for him I claimed them as trophies
[1:40:09] of Christ's love at Calvary I challenge
[1:40:12] you to a debate
[1:40:15] you don't have any legal power
[1:40:18] you have no power over them you didn't
[1:40:21] have it in the first place you were just
[1:40:24] bluffing them you're only bluffing them
[1:40:26] and Christ stripped you of everything
[1:40:29] that you had at Calvary
[1:40:32] he stripped you of every Power that you
[1:40:34] had and you're nothing but a bluff
[1:40:38] and we're calling your blood
[1:40:47] I want to remind you our God is not dead
[1:40:52] but he is very much alive and he's in
[1:40:54] this building right now he's not a
[1:40:57] Million Miles Away
[1:41:00] so the house of hell that would like to
[1:41:02] hold you Bound in prison walls even now
[1:41:05] I want you to know there's a power in
[1:41:08] the building right now that's not the
[1:41:11] keys to the door
[1:41:16] and if Jesus assigned your pardon accept
[1:41:20] it and walk up
[1:41:22] and tell the devil I will not be your
[1:41:25] slave no longer
[1:41:35] Satan I want to remind you our champion
[1:41:40] stood there and said I have power to lay
[1:41:42] my life down and power to take it up
[1:41:44] again there was nothing you could do to
[1:41:47] stop it
[1:41:49] our promises we are going for a Rapture
[1:41:51] and we're going to have a body change
[1:41:54] that's coming a resurrection there's
[1:41:56] coming a rapture we will see the
[1:41:59] physical Lord Jesus Christ and there's
[1:42:01] nothing that you can do to stop it
[1:42:04] nothing
[1:42:10] thank you
[1:42:14] nothing
[1:42:19] Our God has never lost a case
[1:42:22] he's never been in a crisis he has never
[1:42:26] lied he's never went back on his word he
[1:42:29] is always on time he always has the
[1:42:32] right decision
[1:42:36] God has given unto us
[1:42:38] unlimited power
[1:42:42] so why don't we use it
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:49] brother Ron I've been I've been
[1:42:52] I've been through some battles
[1:42:54] well this might describe you
[1:42:56] I have been sick before
[1:42:58] but I made it
[1:43:01] I have been broke before but I manage
[1:43:05] I've been broken-hearted before but I
[1:43:08] made it
[1:43:09] I have been betrayed but I made it I
[1:43:12] have been lied on but I made it I have
[1:43:15] been destitute but I made it
[1:43:19] I have been rejected but I made it
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:26] say it with me I am here
[1:43:29] and I made it
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:35] I love this quote brother Graham said
[1:43:37] don't underestimate Jesus Christ
[1:43:41] because he's the power over all powers
[1:43:44] don't be afraid of Satan
[1:43:47] as long as you're in him but if you're
[1:43:50] not in him you better tremble but if
[1:43:53] you're in him Jesus Christ not even
[1:43:56] death itself can harm you
[1:43:59] you're free from all fear
[1:44:03] when I think about that I wanna shout
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:14] Hallelujah
[1:44:16] now you see this age tells us that we're
[1:44:18] going to be Overcomers
[1:44:21] so Overcomers means that we're going to
[1:44:24] have to wrestle with some things
[1:44:27] we're going out to fight for every
[1:44:29] promise that God has given to us
[1:44:31] it is our Promised Land we're going to
[1:44:34] have to fight we're going to have to
[1:44:36] fight for every inch of ground
[1:44:38] but Victory is in our camp
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:43] for a new birth you've got to fight for
[1:44:45] it
[1:44:46] now some people say well brother on you
[1:44:49] you know there's just way too much
[1:44:51] emotion
[1:44:55] well the devil would say that
[1:44:58] and a good old Church of Christ would
[1:45:00] say that
[1:45:02] but it's hard for me to believe that
[1:45:03] message Believers would say that
[1:45:13] you don't like that you're you're going
[1:45:15] to be miserable for about the next 45
[1:45:17] minutes
[1:45:22] one of a hundred some quotes I can prove
[1:45:25] that anything without emotion is dead
[1:45:39] so if your religion hasn't got any
[1:45:41] emotion about it bury it
[1:45:43] okay
[1:45:45] somewhere and get a new one that's got
[1:45:47] some life in it
[1:45:51] so if your church
[1:45:56] I'm used to being in trouble I might as
[1:45:58] well get here now if your church is dead
[1:46:01] I won that's a lie
[1:46:14] well brother Branham I didn't get
[1:46:16] nothing out of service because that
[1:46:17] brother that brother and he's in another
[1:46:20] place called it a sister got to amen and
[1:46:22] it got you shouting and it just chills
[1:46:24] run over me brother Brown said you
[1:46:26] better not go to heaven
[1:46:29] you'll freeze to death
[1:46:36] so young people you've got to fight your
[1:46:39] way past the barrier of dead religion
[1:46:52] well brother Ron that's a workup was it
[1:46:54] a work up at volleyball
[1:46:58] wasn't a workup at the professional
[1:47:00] baseball game
[1:47:02] wasn't a work up at the hockey or the
[1:47:04] football
[1:47:06] pay hundreds of dollars for tickets and
[1:47:08] you go and set in the cold don't tell me
[1:47:10] I'm I'm in the Ohio State country I know
[1:47:13] where I'm at
[1:47:18] LSU all right I got you
[1:47:22] those people don't go there and sit
[1:47:24] still
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:29] and they go there with very much the
[1:47:31] possibility of getting beat
[1:47:35] they leave their houses they put flags
[1:47:38] on their car
[1:47:40] they're proud to be identified with
[1:47:42] their team
[1:47:45] they're thrilled to be identified
[1:47:48] they wear their shirts they wear their
[1:47:50] coats they wear their hats
[1:48:00] they don't care who's sitting beside of
[1:48:02] them
[1:48:05] I don't care who's sitting beside of
[1:48:06] them they just start shouting and they
[1:48:09] start screaming they start hollering
[1:48:13] they're doing everything that they could
[1:48:16] there's no way that the players can hear
[1:48:18] them all the way up there but they give
[1:48:21] it everything that they got
[1:48:25] then the same devil will get mad at you
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:32] same devil will get mad at you when you
[1:48:34] come to church
[1:48:38] [Applause]
[1:48:40] and you start singing
[1:48:42] and you start tapping your feet
[1:48:46] you start lifting your hands
[1:48:50] and if you're not careful you'll be
[1:48:52] dancing all over the place
[1:48:54] well it runs in our family
[1:49:07] I might as well kill that devil while
[1:49:09] I'm there
[1:49:12] I might as well kill him while I'm there
[1:49:14] King David was a dancing
[1:49:20] and again 17 miles dancing he got in the
[1:49:25] flesh he got to dancing he was shouting
[1:49:28] because the word had came back home
[1:49:32] he had ever right to shout we in this
[1:49:35] Branch Revival have every right to shout
[1:49:47] you with your emotionless religion will

[2:00:25] trying to destroy youth like you
[2:00:29] and I say this you we will not be
[2:00:32] defeated
[2:00:41] Romans chapter 8 and verse 28 for we
[2:00:44] know that all things work together for
[2:00:46] the good to them that love God
[2:00:48] to them who are they called according to
[2:00:50] his purpose for over more over whom he
[2:00:54] for whom he did for no he also did
[2:00:57] predestinate to be conformed in the
[2:00:59] image of his son that he might be the
[2:01:01] firstborn among many Brethren and
[2:01:03] moreover whom
[2:01:04] he did predestinate
[2:01:07] then he also called
[2:01:09] and whom he called then he also
[2:01:12] Justified
[2:01:15] so if he brought you out of the Lamb's
[2:01:17] Book and he's did all of this work to
[2:01:18] get you here
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:22] and he called you and he gathered you
[2:01:24] then he also Justified
[2:01:27] [Applause]
[2:01:28] so if you've asked God to forgive you of
[2:01:30] your sins
[2:01:31] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:01:33] Jesus Christ receive the holy ghost in
[2:01:36] your life and the devil is whispering in
[2:01:39] your ears and he's jumping on your back
[2:01:40] that devil is trespassing
[2:01:44] knock him off
[2:02:02] and if he just keeps telling you what
[2:02:05] you used to do and reminds you how bad
[2:02:07] you was and what you used to say in the
[2:02:09] pornography you used to watch
[2:02:12] just remind him God Justified me and
[2:02:15] it's as though I never did it in the
[2:02:17] first place and he took the desire of
[2:02:19] that thing out of my life
[2:02:33] and if you're still wrestling with those
[2:02:36] things in your life you've came to the
[2:02:39] right place you do not have to go home
[2:02:41] and be a slave to that any longer
[2:02:50] foreign
[2:02:55] but I can't overcome let him get in the
[2:02:58] inside of you he will overcome in your
[2:03:01] life

[2:03:12] who can be a dead stars
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:20] I'll just be honest with you I refuse to
[2:03:23] retreat
[2:03:29] I refuse to give up
[2:03:33] I've been serving the lord 40 years now
[2:03:36] preaching almost that long
[2:03:38] but let me just say this to you there's
[2:03:40] never been a day where I wanted to go
[2:03:42] back
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:44] there's nothing to go back to
[2:03:46] [Applause]
[2:03:57] Satan can offer you everything in the
[2:04:00] world but he's got nothing
[2:04:02] that I want
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:06] and you've got everything that he wants
[2:04:10] refuse to give up refuse to retreat
[2:04:16] Onward Christian Soldiers marching on

[2:04:24] little children
[2:04:26] and have overcame them because greater
[2:04:28] is he that is in you
[2:04:30] [Applause]

[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:38] Paul say it like this in second
[2:04:40] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5 not
[2:04:42] that we are sufficient of ourselves to
[2:04:46] think anything of ourselves but our
[2:04:49] sufficiency
[2:04:51] is of God
[2:04:54] I can't have strength for myself but my
[2:04:57] strength comes from him
[2:04:58] [Applause]
[2:05:02] I'm asked over and over again by
[2:05:05] incredible doctors
[2:05:07] are you ready to give up and quit your
[2:05:10] chemo
[2:05:11] quit
[2:05:15] quit
[2:05:18] why would I want to quit
[2:05:22] we're whipping cancer here
[2:05:40] now for the critic in the building said
[2:05:42] now it's not a miracle if you're taking
[2:05:44] drugs
[2:05:48] you know you need to know the
[2:05:49] naturopathic route
[2:05:53] where was you at when they gave me four
[2:05:55] months to live
[2:05:59] where was you at when I had a brain
[2:06:01] tumor that big
[2:06:06] where was you at when the doctor walks
[2:06:09] in it sets down on my bed don't know if
[2:06:11] I'm going to make it through it I had
[2:06:13] trust in God because God said if you'll
[2:06:15] trust me I'll use you like never before
[2:06:23] I did not expect to be handed to death
[2:06:25] sentence
[2:06:27] but let me just say if that's what God
[2:06:29] chose for me to walk
[2:06:31] I'm willing to walk wherever God wants
[2:06:33] me to walk
[2:06:39] I felt something so I'm going to go
[2:06:41] ahead and take care of it
[2:06:44] a doctor is about six foot five walks in
[2:06:46] about the size of you brother Aaron
[2:06:48] walks in crosses his legs looks at me
[2:06:51] he's been taking care of me I'm in
[2:06:52] palliative care he takes care of me he
[2:06:54] says uh
[2:06:56] you
[2:06:57] are a miracle
[2:07:02] you are a miracle
[2:07:05] he said do you ever have people tell you
[2:07:07] that it's not a miracle
[2:07:09] because you're taking chemo
[2:07:12] I just smiled at him
[2:07:17] he said I want you to look in the lobby
[2:07:21] I want you to look in all these offices
[2:07:23] every one of them are on the same chemo
[2:07:25] you want
[2:07:26] they're they're taking the same
[2:07:28] experimental drugs that you're taking
[2:07:31] none of them look like you

[2:08:03] was bruised for mine iniquities he took
[2:08:06] those stripes at Pilates judgment Hall
[2:08:08] that I could be healed

[2:08:37] taken that trial to destroy the worst of
[2:08:41] the devil
[2:08:54] it might be a little brave but cancer

[2:09:24] brother Brandon made this statement he
[2:09:25] said I'm so glad that a man can so
[2:09:27] completely serve God
[2:09:33] if the devil could amen he could say
[2:09:35] this yeah he's right that man's right

[2:09:42] that a man could so completely serve god
[2:09:44] Till the devil don't know what to do
[2:09:45] with him

[2:09:49] they would say Amen we can't do nothing
[2:09:52] with that group of people

[2:10:57] Ali in the corner
[2:11:00] he he said I didn't tell him how to
[2:11:02] fight
[2:11:03] no matter if he was in a great losing he

[2:12:42] he went right back into training
[2:12:46] he went right back into getting himself
[2:12:48] ready
[2:12:50] and he found a man that could hit as
[2:12:54] hard as his Challenger
[2:12:56] and he told that man don't you take it
[2:12:59] easy on me
[2:13:00] you hit me just as hard as that man hit
[2:13:03] me you hit me to where my heart stops
[2:13:05] you hit me to where you knocked me up
[2:13:09] cause I'm determined to stay on my feet
[2:13:14] I'm determined
[2:13:21] and he trained and he trained and he
[2:13:23] trained and he trained and he trained
[2:13:25] and he trained and he trained
[2:13:34] and he was in the back back there and
[2:13:36] there was it says getting him ready the
[2:13:38] night had come the challenge was ready
[2:13:40] they stood there with their opponent
[2:13:42] coming out screaming I am the champion
[2:13:44] and he knew who was the champion
[2:13:48] who I feel like preaching
[2:13:50] he knew who was the champion
[2:13:53] somebody else was carrying his belt
[2:13:56] [Applause]
[2:13:59] carrying his belt
[2:14:04] and he'd come out dancing
[2:14:09] and it was all business
[2:14:12] but this time
[2:14:16] when he got hit with that hard knock
[2:14:19] and his head started to spin and he felt
[2:14:22] the chaos of her coming on him again he
[2:14:25] stayed on his feet
[2:14:27] he got against the ropes he would call
[2:14:30] it the rope-a-dope
[2:14:32] he would stay on the ropes until he came
[2:14:35] back to himself
[2:14:38] and when he came back to himself
[2:14:42] he knew who he was and he knew what he
[2:14:45] was capable of doing
[2:14:58] I'm not talking about Muhammad Ali right
[2:15:01] now
[2:15:01] but you've been hit with some punches
[2:15:03] that knocked you all over the place
[2:15:05] knocked you out knocked you down you
[2:15:08] thought you'd never get back up again
[2:15:10] but God rich in Mercy reached down and
[2:15:12] grabbed a hold of you
[2:15:14] and you started the training process
[2:15:16] over and over and over again you came to
[2:15:18] church you came and worshiped you read
[2:15:21] the word of God you listened to the
[2:15:23] tapes
[2:15:24] and Here Comes Your Challenger
[2:15:29] and he hits you with his best shot and
[2:15:32] you just stand there and sleep
[2:15:38] you just shake it for a little while
[2:15:42] and when you come to yourself
[2:15:45] I am bone of this bone I'm life of this
[2:15:48] life I'm power of his power
[2:15:53] I am an overcomer
[2:16:06] I'd like to say Satan has underestimated
[2:16:08] you
[2:16:11] now he's been known for that before
[2:16:14] let me remind him three Hebrew children
[2:16:16] in a fire
[2:16:17] [Applause]
[2:16:19] a prophet in a in a dungeon full of full
[2:16:23] of lines
[2:16:30] Hallelujah an old man walking around
[2:16:34] I'm going to have a son
[2:16:37] I'm gonna have a son
[2:16:39] I'm gonna have a son
[2:16:41] an old woman sitting in their tent
[2:16:45] and God having a teller that's nothing
[2:16:48] impossible
[2:16:50] [Applause]
[2:17:06] one man
[2:17:07] took a Jawbone of an ass
[2:17:11] and killed a thousand
[2:17:14] because the word said he could do it
[2:17:19] one man
[2:17:21] because the word said one will chase a
[2:17:24] thousand
[2:17:26] and to prove it could happen
[2:17:29] one man picked up a Jawbone of an ass
[2:17:34] and killed
[2:17:36] pornographic devils
[2:17:38] [Applause]
[2:17:40] dead devils

[2:19:50] against you to destroy you
[2:19:53] and you're right
[2:19:55] he's put all kind of Family Matters
[2:19:57] against you to destroy you

[2:20:01] you

[2:20:58] young man standing beside him
[2:21:00] he swore he'd get you too
[2:21:02] you've been fighting a real fight
[2:21:05] ain't that right I've been fighting a
[2:21:07] real fight
[2:21:09] but you didn't come to this Camp to go
[2:21:10] home the same person
[2:21:15] you didn't you didn't come here to get
[2:21:17] defeated
[2:21:20] you come here for victory
[2:21:24] you're Joe's son behind him
[2:21:26] you didn't come here to be defeated
[2:21:30] just being in the daddy of a preacher's
[2:21:32] home won't give you Victory but you came
[2:21:34] here with one thing on your mind I'm
[2:21:37] going home with more Victory than ever
[2:21:39] before in my life
[2:21:47] all right
[2:21:56] Aaliyah
[2:21:58] Aaliyah last night you had a
[2:22:00] breakthrough
[2:22:01] you'd been looking for that kind of
[2:22:03] breakthrough but tonight's your night to
[2:22:05] get filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:22:17] foreign
[2:22:30] man from his birth was predestinated to
[2:22:33] kill Philistines
[2:22:36] but he got tangled in his flesh
[2:22:39] and he found himself into Lila's lap
[2:22:41] like a lot of you have
[2:22:45] but that wouldn't end
[2:22:48] God didn't write that Son of God off
[2:22:52] he didn't say I'm finished with him
[2:22:56] he said Satan you have underestimated
[2:22:59] Mike's power
[2:23:09] I want to tell the devil to not shaken
[2:23:13] you have underestimated these kids
[2:23:15] you've underestimated these Believers
[2:23:18] that are sitting here tonight
[2:23:26] he found himself
[2:23:29] had a grinding meal
[2:23:31] with his eyes put out
[2:23:34] his hair shaved
[2:23:37] Nazarite Val
[2:23:39] looks like it's gone
[2:23:43] but be careful of what you see
[2:23:48] temporary problems
[2:23:55] temporary circumstances
[2:23:58] it's not the Eternal answer
[2:24:04] God didn't choose you to lose you
[2:24:07] so if you were a prodigal away from home
[2:24:11] eating in a pig pen
[2:24:14] get too caught up with where you're at
[2:24:17] because there's coming up going home
[2:24:19] party
[2:24:39] they had him tied to a meal
[2:24:42] grinding corn
[2:24:44] in the middle of the city
[2:24:47] it was over
[2:24:49] in a place that was down
[2:24:52] and in that grinding meal
[2:24:54] people could walk up and look at the
[2:24:57] champion
[2:24:58] and they could make fun of him
[2:25:01] and they could spilled on him
[2:25:03] and had their little children to come up
[2:25:05] and make fun of him whistle at him and
[2:25:08] spit on him
[2:25:11] but he just kept grinding
[2:25:14] he just kept going
[2:25:18] going to his Pew
[2:25:20] he just kept pushing
[2:25:22] all he knew to do was push
[2:25:25] and pray push and pray push and pray
[2:25:29] push and pray go to the Altar and pray
[2:25:32] lift your hands and praise the Lord Echo
[2:25:35] and amen out
[2:25:37] it may not seem like you're going
[2:25:39] anywhere it may not seem like Victory is
[2:25:42] close in hand
[2:25:43] but your hair is growing
[2:25:51] seem unconscious but your hair is
[2:25:55] growing back up
[2:25:58] you can feel it down on your ears
[2:26:02] and after a while you can feel it on
[2:26:05] your shoulders and when you shake your
[2:26:07] head you can feel it
[2:26:10] and you know it's being restored one
[2:26:13] prayer at a time
[2:26:15] whether you know it or not every service
[2:26:18] you didn't close at
[2:26:21] you're getting closer to your body
[2:26:23] change
[2:26:25] you're getting closer to seeing your
[2:26:27] loved ones
[2:26:29] keep pushing
[2:26:31] keep pushing it
[2:26:33] what God has purposed in his heart he
[2:26:36] will bring to pass
[2:26:39] so today
[2:26:41] they thought they'd make fun of him
[2:26:45] today
[2:26:48] they had all their football gods
[2:26:51] and all their gods lined up
[2:26:54] and they were going to do some heavy
[2:26:56] worshiping and they were going to make
[2:26:58] fun of God's champion
[2:27:05] as he was walking in
[2:27:07] he was taken by the hand
[2:27:10] of a little boy
[2:27:15] and brother Branham said he prayed
[2:27:18] once more
[2:27:23] once oh brother Ron I thought I'd come
[2:27:27] to the meeting one more time
[2:27:31] I thought I'd come to church one more
[2:27:34] time
[2:27:39] Lord let me fill your presence
[2:27:45] once more
[2:27:48] maybe you've been away from God and I'm
[2:27:50] not just talking to young people now
[2:28:04] little fella
[2:28:07] this building's got to be built to worth
[2:28:09] it there's got to be pillars in it to
[2:28:11] hold it up
[2:28:12] could you take me over
[2:28:15] and put me between the pillars
[2:28:18] let me put my hands
[2:28:22] on those pillars that are holding up
[2:28:25] Satan's kingdom
[2:28:33] Satan if you're still in the building
[2:28:35] get ready
[2:28:41] and he did fill it in his flesh
[2:28:43] but there's something started moving
[2:28:47] and he began to remember what it was
[2:28:49] like to take a Jawbone
[2:28:53] and his arms go across one enemy after
[2:28:57] another
[2:28:58] he felt what it was like again to pick
[2:29:01] up the gates of the city
[2:29:04] to catch 300 foxes and sell all their
[2:29:07] tails on fire
[2:29:10] to whip devil after devil and he felt it
[2:29:13] again
[2:29:22] and he began to push
[2:29:25] today
[2:29:28] say it with me
[2:29:31] today
[2:29:36] he would take his hands
[2:29:39] push
[2:29:41] can you imagine what he felt like
[2:29:44] when he felt him start moving
[2:30:00] it's a test to shred
[2:30:06] brother Brown said you'll never know
[2:30:08] when it was like
[2:30:11] when I was looking at that little boy
[2:30:12] laying on the ground
[2:30:14] two years after the vision
[2:30:17] that was the boy there was the soldiers
[2:30:19] there was the trees
[2:30:21] he said you could line up every devil in
[2:30:24] hell
[2:30:25] [Music]
[2:30:25] [Applause]
[2:30:27] you can line up every devil in hell and
[2:30:30] you couldn't stop it
[2:30:33] If this boy is not off of the ground in
[2:30:35] five minutes then you call
[2:30:37] you call me a false prophet
[2:30:50] let me just tell you may sound boastful
[2:30:53] but you could line up every devil in
[2:30:55] hell
[2:30:56] and you can't stop this bride's Revival
[2:31:14] you say brother hun but I just can't
[2:31:16] I've come to the altar so many times
[2:31:19] and I just can't make a breakthrough
[2:31:24] I just can't make a breakthrough
[2:31:26] can I tell you about your champion
[2:31:30] I've talked to you about Muhammad Ali
[2:31:32] I've talked to you about
[2:31:34] champions of the scriptures but I want
[2:31:37] to talk to you about my champion
[2:31:40] my champion
[2:31:42] my champion
[2:31:44] stood there and didn't say a word
[2:31:48] because he knew where he was headed
[2:31:51] he had the power to call Ten Thousand
[2:31:53] Angels
[2:31:55] he had to power one of those angels
[2:31:57] could have changed the whole scene
[2:32:00] he surrendered himself to a chop block
[2:32:02] to where they would beat him until he
[2:32:05] was totally unrecognizable as a human
[2:32:06] being
[2:32:08] and he took those lips so a guy named
[2:32:11] Ron Spencer could stand here without
[2:32:13] fear of cancer
[2:32:32] I want to encourage you I don't care
[2:32:34] what the doctor tells you
[2:32:37] let me just take a moment here I don't
[2:32:39] care what the doctor tells you I don't
[2:32:41] care how bad he says it is I don't care
[2:32:44] where he says it is
[2:32:46] [Music]
[2:32:47] I don't care what the Test shows I don't
[2:32:50] care what the scan shows I don't care
[2:32:53] how long you gotta fight it we are the
[2:32:56] winner
[2:33:02] take courage
[2:33:05] fight fight fight fight fight fight
[2:33:18] your disease that you're fighting will
[2:33:22] not win
[2:33:25] everywhere
[2:33:29] Brother Ray of Satan would have known
[2:33:31] what Jesus was really doing
[2:33:34] he'd have never touched him
[2:33:37] Jesus would have died an old man that
[2:33:41] would not be nail prince in his hands
[2:33:43] thou would have not been thorns on his
[2:33:45] head he would have never carried a cross
[2:33:48] he'd have never been beat with those
[2:33:50] rods and those bra those things ripping
[2:33:53] into him until his organs would show
[2:33:57] every stripe was killing devils
[2:34:16] Satan you asked for a fact we showed up
[2:34:22] you asked for a fight here in laodicea
[2:34:24] we showed up we're here
[2:34:30] okay
[2:34:38] the scripture said I will not suffer my
[2:34:41] Holy One
[2:34:44] to seek corruption
[2:34:47] Jesus would say destroy this body
[2:34:50] this temple in three days I'll raise it
[2:34:54] up again
[2:34:56] Satan heard every word
[2:35:00] you was in him
[2:35:06] you was in him
[2:35:09] when he was on the cross you was in him
[2:35:16] and if Satan couldn't correct you 2 000
[2:35:20] years ago he can't corrupt you now
[2:35:43] I don't know your battle
[2:35:46] I don't know your situation
[2:35:49] but I've talked to you about it God that
[2:35:52] does
[2:36:00] you know
[2:36:01] sometimes Satan knows it when to get you
[2:36:04] he don't fight you when there's a
[2:36:05] thousand people here
[2:36:10] he don't fight you when you're sitting
[2:36:11] in church
[2:36:15] he fights you when you get in the car
[2:36:20] he starts rattling in your ear
[2:36:23] he starts sending all kind of negative
[2:36:25] thoughts through your mind
[2:36:27] and it don't matter if you got blonde
[2:36:30] hair or gray hair
[2:36:33] your parents are oh new hair
[2:36:36] I'll get y'all
[2:36:39] he's no respected person
[2:36:43] so he fights you alone
[2:36:46] if you stay alone and don't invite God
[2:36:49] on the scene
[2:36:51] he'll whip you
[2:37:15] let me just tell you something about
[2:37:16] courage because I'm going to challenge
[2:37:18] you now in just in a moment
[2:37:20] courage is not fighting when you've got
[2:37:23] the strength
[2:37:26] courage is fighting
[2:37:29] when there is no strength to be found
[2:37:37] now every one of us are an individuals
[2:37:39] sitting here tonight
[2:37:42] you know what you've been fighting
[2:37:46] now you say well brother Ron I don't
[2:37:48] know so much about this as a convention
[2:37:49] meeting and you preach them fighting
[2:37:52] sermon
[2:37:53] yeah well
[2:37:55] I'm just paying attention to the boss
[2:38:01] because I'm not going to go back down
[2:38:03] the road tomorrow and tell him Lord I
[2:38:05] couldn't I couldn't preach what you
[2:38:07] wanted me to preach because that would
[2:38:08] have been too difficult
[2:38:11] I learned a long time ago if I preach
[2:38:13] what he wants me to preach he'll give me
[2:38:15] the strength
[2:38:34] so I told you that last night was the
[2:38:36] most difficult night that I have had in
[2:38:38] three and a half years
[2:38:40] Satan knew this punch was coming
[2:38:44] because no doubt he'd been watching
[2:38:46] across my shoulders as I was working
[2:38:52] and he knew
[2:38:54] that if I delivered the mail
[2:38:57] and you opened the mail
[2:38:59] and you read your name on the mail
[2:39:02] and you said I can overcome
[2:39:14] I hear the sound of freedom
[2:39:19] I hear a jubilee trumpet in the building
[2:39:25] I hear that slavery
[2:39:27] is over
[2:39:29] and I don't have to be a slave no longer
[2:39:44] amen
[2:39:46] now it's your turn
[2:39:49] last night
[2:39:52] from 12 o'clock to three o'clock
[2:39:56] I fought the enemy
[2:40:00] and I said Lord don't let me die in this
[2:40:02] bed I honestly prayed that Lord don't
[2:40:04] let me die in this bed
[2:40:06] I got a sermon to preach
[2:40:08] yeah
[2:40:11] if you give me the strength I preach the
[2:40:13] sermon
[2:40:15] there's some people came to the building
[2:40:17] decided do I go to church or don't go to
[2:40:19] church they can do that on Sunday
[2:40:20] morning I don't know if I got the
