a tremendous time to serve the Lord isn't it amen amen just now if we would maybe we just turn to the Lord let's bow our hearts together almighty god father it uh feels like maybe lightning is just moving through the building almost electric Lord where your presence is moving on hearts and lives and father I know Lord that when some got out of the bed this morning to come to church Lord you were already dealing with her hearts Lord already speaking Lord and the great needs that have been made known to you through prayer Lord I know that you're a prayer answering God now father this morning we have come here with one goal in mind Lord and that is to worship you and your Prophet has taught us that the highest form of worship is the word of God and we ask you now Lord that we enter this realm of the word may you Lord stand near us oh god father may you inspire the words that should should be spoken Lord and keep the words that are not now father we're committing this service to your hands and we ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus come take this take this service for your glory in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles I want to turn to the book of Ephesians uh the 5th chapter and we're going to be reading uh several verses here but verses 22 down to verse 32 um it's a beautiful reading uh usually used for wedding ceremonies um that I would like to read it this morning and uh we'll be speaking here from this section of scripture Ephesians 5 and verse 22 now wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church now he's teaching us how to love even as Christ loved the the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies now he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourished and cherish it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones that's powerful isn't it amen we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones amen for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this next verse this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen may the Lord bless his word as you could be seated this morning uh I'm going to have several services in this portion of scripture but this morning I'm going to begin with this area um that's it's a it's a it's there's a lot here uh but I'm going to begin in this area uh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church now uh if you're uh uh if you read the messages and you you follow along with the prophet of course in one of the sermons here he'll teach us uh that the end time message The Messer of Revelations 10:7 that his ministry was to unfold The Mystery of the Bible that that would be the ministry that he would have would be to unlock uh the mystery of the scripture and the and brother brandom is listing different uh Mysteries and he goes into different Mysteries and in the fifth mystery he said is of the church as the bride of Christ in Ephesians 52832 so it's a great mystery of how the church is the bride of Christ now uh if you uh look up the word mystery brother Bram actually says this he says mystery here the mystery is a scripture it is previously hidden truth but now divinely revealed which is a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation now they greater Mysteries and the greater Mysteries are and then he begins to list them so a mystery is a divinely revealed truth it's something that is written previously hid but now it's been revealed now I want to speak to you a little bit on this context this morning from this scripture and I would take a a Title Here If I could and for the context of scripture I'm want to speak to you about the marriage of the Lamb I want to talk to you about the marriage of the Lamb amen now in Revelation chapter 19 let's just read about the marriage Revelations 19: 5 and9 and a voice uh uh Revelations 19:5 and a voice come out of the throne saying praise our God all ye servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready I love this verses here and to her was granted it was granted given it was like a a present and to her was was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen it was clean and white now for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb now you're going to find later that the calling to the marriage supper of the Lamb is the rapture right because the rest of the Dead live not a thousand years now you see why he said blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb in other words theyve went into the Rapture amen and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God now that's powerful amen these are the true sayings of God and I believe that it's very true this morning that we could announce to the church to the world to this age that the marriage of the Lamb has come now you see that whenever that you see it in scripture look how John makes it so glorious it's not much different than when Isaiah saw the coming of the Lord Jesus and he said well the mountains were made High the low and The Valleys were made High and the Crooked places were made straight and when it happened it was John the Baptist came and baptized Jesus and and made a way and here comes this man and so it was it was the prophecy was uh appeared to be speaking of one thing but when it happened amen everybody was asking who is this what does this mean what's taking place well to explain John simply said I'm the one that cometh out of the Wilderness to prepare away so see things events that transp ired in the days of the Lord Jesus the only thing they did is that they would reach in the scripture and then they would make what event happened and then they would make it clear now the thing is Jesus many times spoke to them and said I am he that cometh and then he he fulfilled scripture and then he said I'm I'm fulfilling scripture it is I'm doing this because it is written and he'll say because it was written was it not written and so what he's doing is he's showing the events that are happening or what is taking place is only make clear when you identify it by scripture so all of these great events that we have seen in the message of the hour we've seen the great crowds and we've seen the Messiah sign we've seen the ministry of William Brandon we've seen all of these things and people are saying what is this who is this what is all of this about I want to announce to you the scripture makes it clear amen it is the marriage of the Lamb that's what all of the noise is about that's why all the Angels that's why all the arrangements that's why the heaven host and it's why the power of God is displayed as such because it is the marriage of the Lamb amen it's the marriage of royalty it's the King's son and his bride amen it's what a powerful thing to know amen that there is a mystery concerning Christ and the church you are the Bride of Jesus Christ now this announcement is something that comes out of the throne am mean I think it's amazing when announcements are made you only listen to announcements as you can tell where they come from you know it makes a lot of difference who you tell of when something comes it's like and there's certain people I'm sure you all have them amen they'll tell you well certain certain thing happen this that and you're never going to tell that till you check it because you've did it before and found out well it wasn't just the way you thought you know amen so what you need is a good trusted source and and what John is saying is that the voice that is announcing the marriage of the Lamb is a voice that is come from the Throne of God which we can certainly trust the Throne of God now if you watch this the Bible says it amen that it was a voice that come out of the throne now I'm just going to take you on a Bible study for a couple moments here in Revelations the fourth chapter and the fifth verse the Bible says and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and Thunders and voices and those voices watch this were the seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God so what you're seeing is what is coming out of the throne and the voice that is announcing watch the scripture now and it says and that voice were the seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God now you know God don't have seven spirits right amen he's just got one spirit that manifested throughout the Seven Ages amen so the seven spirits are just manifestation of one Spirit now watch the seven spirits Before the Throne now go to Revelations 1 and4 and John says to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace and peace be unto him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne now in Revelation 31 it's going to tell you what those Spirits are and unto the angel of the Church of Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars amen I Know Thy Works th th as th name liveth and are dead now in Revelations 1:16 he's going to describe what the Seven Stars are now somebody say well brother Wayne this is Elementary maybe for you amen but there's new people and there's people that come so if you believe it I'll go ahead and hear an amen just now and then you're being so nice and listening so quietly but this really ain't a quiet church so you go ahead and amen the word we'll be okay amen and unto the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works and thou had name that thou livest but thou are dead now in Revelations 1:16 the Bible said that he had in his right hand Seven Stars now out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was the son as a strange China now he had in his hand Seven Stars now somebody said what is them Seven Stars we'll look in the next verse it'll tell you Revelations 1 and20 and the Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks for the Seven Stars s are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches so the stars in the hand are the Angels to the seven churches amen now what we're seeing then is the voice that comes from the throne comes to the church as a star or as a spirit it is the angel of that age and unto the angel of the Church of thus under the angel of samarina under the angel of Ephesians and in each one of them it's a star is only a symbol that's considered an angel is that right now an angel in our thoughts many time is just talking about a Celestial Angel which is like a seraphim amen or it's a cherub it's some kind of a Heavenly Angel but the word here in the Greek is not speaking of a Heavenly Angel it's speaking of an Earthly Angel amen if you if you're a Bible student and you carry this on to Revelations 19 and also to revelation 22 you'll find that John e one of these angels and tries to worship that angel the seventh one and John said don't worship me I'm of one of your prophets I'm of your brethren John he was a brother of John and a prophet of the scripture he was the Seven Star which was the prophet of God that would visit the last day Church according to Revelation 3:14 unto the Seven Star the Church of Le oysa right now that seven star is the seventh angel of Revelations the 10th chapter and in the day when the voice of the seventh angel star begins to sound that's when the mystery of this whole thing shall become clear it's when somebody can stand on the platform and take the current events that are happening and put them right in the Bible and let you know this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your midst and it ought to fill our hearts with joy no wonder the Bible said be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come I'll tell tell you this we've got a right to Rejoice this morning as a Church of the Living God we're living in the greatest of all of the ages that has ever been in the history time of course we're excited of course we're in great in great expectation of what God would do in this generation because this is the season that God has chose he has announced it by the stars that we have come to the marriage of the lamb now if you uh if you look in the scripture amen you'll find a men that these stars are symbols but we all know that according to the Bible that in the end time there would become someone who would be able to take the symbol off of the scripture before the Bible was written it was in the mind of God right and then it was recorded in a symbol and then it's to be revealed at a latter time I I'll I'll say it to you like this the Bible said that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world now God knew in his mind this that his name was Jesus and Jesus was that lamb slang before the world began but when they recorded it in the Bible they didn't say I'm going to send you Jesus he said a lamb I'm going to give a lamb and so the lamb was a symbol of something God had in his mind but it took somebody like that day when Philip met the unic and the unic was hearing and he's seeing all this stuff and then he starts reading Isaiah and said who is Isaiah talking about and Philip said well I'll tell you who it was amen it was this this man Jesus because now the mystery of it had been revealed and had been introduced by a prophet now I don't have time to preach all these subjects but I'll say this that God will do nothing until first he sends a prophet Amos the thir chapter and the seventh verse God will do nothing until first he sends a prophet why did Jesus go to John in the water why did Jesus go to John in the water and he said Lord I have need to be baptized the he said suffer to be so John for it ful it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness why did John have to baptize Jesus because the word Jesus is the word has to come to a prophet why didn't Jesus go down to the Pharisees and say hey I'm here it it's because it's not the channel God chose he chose for the word to come to the prophet and the prophet introduced the Messiah and that day Elijah did it in this day there's another Elijah that has introduced Jesus Christ to this generation amen you see what it is it's an announcement now amen I know that when the when the when the seals opened up and the Thunder sounded it revealed the symbology the The Book of Revelations which was written to the bride I don't have time to preach all these areas but you know it that the bride's book is the Book of Revelations right wrote in symbol form and hid until the time the Bride come on the earth that's why you have a message is because the trans revealing of this message is what brings the revelation of the symbol on the Book of Revelations is that right now now now when that symbol becomes now you read it it's a different Bible to you we didn't need a new Bible we didn't need a new translation of the Bible we needed to understand the Bible we were reading is that right amen now when you read Seven Stars and you start reading them I I was preaching the convention one time and and I was preaching on the Seven Stars in the right hand and I was talking about God stars and his angels and I just read the scripture like it would be read in our generation and instead of saying under the angel of Ephesus I write I just said unto Paul I write because that's really what was in the mind of God when he put to the angel of Ephesus he really meant unto Paul that was the meaning of the scripture and I just went through the seven Church age Messengers like that and I said but you know when it comes to that seven star that's where the real Trouble Comes as that seven star was a man named William brandom that's where the real trouble is cuz I I've learned something man the devil can't take the name of that Prophet I tell you what it's it's rough on that devil and I tell you why I I mean I don't blame him cuz he's took a weapon everywhere that Prophet ever went the devil took a real weapon amen I remember years ago guy was down in Mexico and he was preaching a meeting and running to a devil he couldn't cast out and he said he didn't know what to do and inspiration came so he reached over and picked a book of brother randoms up and turned around and and he said he held up that book and he said' do you know who this is the devil and the devil said yeah he said' that man's name is William brandom he cast me out of a meeting in Jonesboro Arkansas years ago and that devil had to recognize that was a prophet now now some of the Christian people don't know it but the devil knows it the devil knows it's real amen now now I'm saying that because amen you can quote anybody you want to just don't quote brother random you can quote Paul you quote Peter you quote James you can quote any of the early Apostles you can quote Moses you can amen you can call it the word of God but when you quote William brandom all the devils in Hell start cankering up you ever notice we can quote Billy Graham we can quote uh Church Hill we can you know I mean I did it myself we fought them on the beaches and we'll fight them in the in the Sands we'll fight them on the waters but we will never surrender amen Church Hill gave that as a vday speech and and and and and and beat the Germans in in England by the words that he spoke and we've all used them and we've inspired people by them amen but that was nothing to be compared with a voice coming out of the Throne of God and unto the angel of the Church of the L de seea can I say it the way it was written unto William brandom I say I Rite unto thee I was preaching a meeting and I was in Norway and there was a lady there that was suffering with leukemia cancer she was in bad shape she was really bad shape and when I was preaching it took me a year to find out this testimony but when I was preaching that sermon I announced the seven star was a man named William brandham A year later that woman found me when I come back to do the camp she said brother Wayne last year when you preached here I was so sick with leukemia I said I remember she said when you announced the seven star was a man named William brandom she said there was a warm sensation that started at the top of my head and went come through my body she said brother Wayne I am completely healed of leukemia I never laid a hand on the woman I never even knew she was I never knew how even to touch her she was in the back of the building but the power of the word of God being received gave her a deliverance and I tell you this morning the same God that was in that meeting in Norway is in this meeting in true Earth Tabernacle this morning amen my God is not going to leave this message there is an angel Covenant angel that walks with this message in the last days I'll tell you see when the Holy Spirit the devil can't stand this anointing the devil can't stand this this season that we're living in now the authority of the five-fold ministry is an authority that comes from being under a messenger that's right when I say things with such Authority concerning scripture it's not because I uh uh that I conveyed with the biggest Bible schools or I'm not coming with a doctorate that some educator gave me where 500 men got together and decided that certain scripture meant a certain thing cuz I found out the Bible said let every man's word be a lie that the word of God remains true there is no private interpretation of the word of God but God will bring it to pass and when God brings it to pass it is a clear interpretation and Vindication of what you're reading amen has been written there has never been anything like it in the history of the world to give the Church of God in Authority we should not be ashamed of this gospel and may I say this I am not ashamed of this gospel I am not ashamed of the name of William brandom or the seven star and the seventh angel or a prophet of God I'm not ashamed because I'm not confused about it I know where it came from I know what it's done for my life and if you begin to believe I know what it can do for your life it'll bring families back together again it'll bring healing in homes it'll bring victory in churches it'll destroy depression Spirits it'll get anxiety away from from you many people are suffering with confusion today and anxiety because the devil has robbed from them the foundational truth that a prophet of God is visited this generation why do you think Satan attacks a prophet so hard why do you really think it is you think he's trying to help you oh I'll tell you the devil come to steal kill and destroy all he's come to do is Rob you of the good things of your life amen I'll show you one thing and I'll carry on but I'll tell you this when Elisha was down there with haa remember that amen the Syrian Army wasn't worried about the Israel army they could care less about the Israel army because they thought they could trick them and outsmart them and so can the devil trick you and outsmart you but God had a prophet there and he was saying don't go down that street because the Syrian Army is waiting on you and don't go behind that Hill because the Syrian Army it got so bad the king of the syan army said we got a spy Among Us he said the people said no everybody's faithful here got a prophet among them he's telling them what you're saying in your bed Chambers so the King was not Waring against Israel's Army he began a war against God's prophet and so is the devil in this end time started a war against God's Prophet but let me tell you something we've already won the battle the faith is in my heart this morning I believe this message and the devil can't take it away from me it belongs to me it's been Vindicated it's real it's true this is my message this is my age this come for me Hallelujah somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I tell you I would have believed it in another time you will amen are showing this morning exactly what you would have been in another day right that's because Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever the authority of this five-fold ministry comes from being under an authoritative word sent by God's Own Way just as men who were under Martin Luther could preach justification by faith hallelujah how they could go out in the streets in the face of Catholic dogmas isn't it amazing they could stand in the face of that entire Catholic church and just homegrown Guys Without educations or anything God under the influence of Martin Luther and they'd run around and tell people who were trying to gain amen their Grace from God by beating and hurting and and they could preach to them the Justified are justified by the faith in the cross of Jesus Christ oh they had Authority oh they had power they just had a couple scriptures amen but they were under an authority the same John Wesley's Ministry that came behind him taught that amen God would sanctify a Believer and look at the power of the Pentecostal Revival broke out in 1906 with the baptism of the Holy Ghost begin to fall and look how it broke out across the Nations and look how it begin to cause all the situation turn the world upside down and they done it on Acts 2 and 4 acts 238 and Acts 19 well think about it they had one scripture amen I'll tell you this amen they had a rumor that he was alive amen they had a couple of scriptures in the day of Pentecost but this bride has received an open book with an authoritative prophet of God and he said this day this scripture and he's gave you your place he's gave you your position oh Church of the Living God I say devil get out of the way as a bride upon the Earth and knows who she is what she's here for what she stands for hallelujah hallelujah somebody said what's all of this about Paul wrote it in Romans 7 we wouldn't have knew it had a prophet not picked it up but in Romans the 7th chapter Paul wrote it when he said that a woman if she has a living husband is bound to that man as long as he lives but when he died she is loose from the law of her husband now you know what the prophet said you might think that's about marriage and divorce he said but it's a prophecy for the last day listen to me The Modern event is made clear by that prophecy Pentecost the movement of Pentecost died dead it's dead we are loosed from the former ideas of what God is and how God does and we have been moved under a message of the hour listen and everything that was good in Pentecost is in this message we didn't lose nothing folks we gained something we gained a husband we gained somebody that could give us life somebody could give us seed Hallelujah modern event made clear the denomination is dead dead the revivals are dead oh amen but when God let it die I'm I'm quoting the prophet God let it die but he let it die to loose you that you might be married to the new anointed word of the age Hallelujah you can accept the prophet's message because Pentecost died but there was a message for a bride and it was coming for a marriage this ain't coming just for a good time it's coming for a marriage it's not coming just for a furter it's coming for a marriage oh hallelujah amen amen Hey Brother bam said it like this he said I can only take one home one one one woman home with me today I can only take one home with me he said there's only one miss William Brown oh he said and there's only one miss Jesus Christ listen let me tell you something I would not leave my wife here no more than God would leave his life can you think about that that God would leave us here for tribulation that he would leave us here for listen he's not going to leave you he's not going to forget you he's not going to forsake you come on as the Bride of Jesus Christ The Rapture is our home well somebody shout hallelujah tell that devil I know who I am hallelujah it's a modern event make clear by the prophecy what is happening Brother Wayne Romans 7 Revelations 19 just as Jesus walked on the road with a two to amus it was prophecy that he was making not all the prophecy is written we know that right like it's not just a prophet saying sayith the Lord this shall happen this shall happen this shall happen but the actions of men in the Bible were prophecy Joseph's whole life was prophecy poor man nobody was following him around telling him hey you're a type of Jesus and when he was down there laying on that hard bed in prison and he was cold and hungry and mistreated and persecuted he didn't have anybody sitting there saying it'll be okay it'll be okay your life's being lived out is a prophecy amen do you know it was literally hundreds of years later when Jesus came that they even understood the life of Joseph nobody understood the life of Joseph and until Jesus came and then the prophecy become clear in the manifestation I say that because Jesus walked with two on the road to EMAs and he appeared to them after the resurrection which we are after the resurrection and he appeared to them himself which is prophecy the Lord shall appear himself 1 Thessalonians 4 says the Lord himself shall appear Among Us 1 John chapter 3 said the Lord shall appear and and we shall be like him amen he shall appear Among Us now we say brother Wayne what is this coming Among Us you got to read Luke 24 to understand it that Jesus appeared to them in another form and they didn't know who they were walking with but in the evening of the third day amen he took them in a room and he broke the bread to them and they saw that this is him that has risen from the dead he is Jesus that's who is I say to you this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you're wondering what the meeting is about it's him it's him he's came Among Us in the power of his resurrection to take over bodies as a member of his pride to claim you by Authority amen I tell you what amen I love the part of this when they when Luke 24 when they got excited at his resurrection they had to go tell somebody and the Bible said they ran back they walked over and they ran back let me tell you if you see what they say you might have drove over but you'll run back amen you might have come in in in in in disturbance and you might have come with your head down but if you catch what I'm saying to you this morning you go home with joy unspeakable and full of Glory you are in the presence of the Messiah himself he has risen Hallelujah look what happened when they when they went in that room and those men ran back and they told their friends and while they were telling it what's the Bible say he appeared among them again the same one that was in that room he was telling about it again and there he showed up again and let me say something to you this morning the prophet of God said when you talk about him he comes near when you start talking about him he's come present I believe we are standing in the presence of Jesus Christ this morning and the power of that Resurrection has come to give life and strength Hallelujah he's not a stranger no more to us though he has appeared he stayed long enough for us to understand he's our husband amen hallelujah you said preacher what the world let me just say this so I can I can just make it clear the word that fell on the day of Pentecost were not working this day that was for Pentecost this is for the bride the going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecost has represented that again we're in the bride age that's uh paragraph 324 invisible Union of the Bride we are in the bride age blowing bride age listen let me let me just make it clear to you amen our old husband is dead we we are in the age when the bride is receiving the word there has not been another age like it Hallelujah when has there ever been another day like this day I tell you not in 2,000 years of church history has anybody ever lived in a season like you are living in I say we are to secure our season I say we are to redeem our time we are to tell the devil you can't have one service Satan you can't have one minute of one service you can't have one day amen every service is important every moment is important every scripture is important every amen is important I know the devil's told our young brothers and our young sisters oh your amens don't matter I'll tell you that's a lying Devil he's telling you that to keep you quiet but I will not K quiet I will not hold my peace in the presence of him I could change the world in the presence of one that can make everything different I say all hell the name of Jesus Christ We Salute the return of our Lord Jesus Hallelujah if we don't praise him the rocks are going to rise up in our place Hallelujah ain't no Rock going to take my place ain't no devil going to quien me down well somebody shout aloud let that devil know you still got a right to shout I know he brought something in your life to shut you up he brought something in your life to quiten you down I say Satan you missed you shot but you missed you threw a punch but it was blocked the grace of God has visited Our Generation I see it I know it it's real you can't take it away from me I didn't imagine it I didn't dream it [Music] hallelujah hallelujah listen the headship and the body had become one unit no wonder brother Brandon would invoke the scripture nothing shall separate us from the love of God we are no longer twing oh I wished I was a preacher right now look I know what you're thinking we're on this side and God's on that side and Jesus got us a bridge and we walk back and forth wrong idea brother BR said when these seals opened up he said God didn't Bridge the gasm he removed the chasm you're on the same side with Jesus whether you feel good whether you feel bad whether you feel worthy whether you don't feel worthy there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Hallelujah the blood works the blood the atoning blood it works for you and I I know what the devil I know the devil I know how he works amen but I love the Bible cuz it's God's weapon to destroy him well let me tell you this if it's just based on our works let's just go there for a moment okay Abraham after the body change lied hey that's the Bible we all read it Abraham lied after the body change about his wife Sarah and no words in scripture do you find God coming to him and tell him if you don't repent I ain't going to give you a child on contrary he tells that King if you don't give the woman back and and repent to this man and have him pray have that liar pray for you I'm going to shut up every womb in your kingdom listen I'm telling you you're under a covenant you're under a promise you're under the anointing and there's not enough Devils to take away the promised Covenant when God said who I bless that shall I bless let me say to this blessed are they which are called under the marriage supper of the Lamb blessings upon blessings have come upon Our Lives Hallelujah you visitors forgive me I'm actually behaving myself a little from what I feel right now Hallelujah there a covenant and God's made it with us the headship and the body have become one what is it amen it's an announcement that the hour has come if you're reading the first seal brother random is trying to explain Revelations the 10th chapter and he says in there if you've had a question as you're reading Revelations 10 the Bible said in the seven Thunders Ed The Voice John was about to write it the angel said don't write it seal it until when until the doctors of divinity get together and put school together until the Baptist educate their professors now I not what he said the Bible said until the seventh angel sounds oh I love the word of God now when that seventh angel was sounding do you think he knew what the Thunders were I'm I'm sincere do you think William brandom knew what the Thunders were when the seal he said if you've wondered what it was turn to John 12 and read it you won't have to wonder anymore Hallelujah you're talking about shutting up all the Giants and the doctr of divinity here's a prophet saying it happened in John the 12th chapter when the Bible said Jesus said father glorify my name thy name and me and and and the Bible said that it thundered from the heavens see God spoke from the heavens and said I have glorified thy name and I shall glorify it again right and the Bible says that a voice spoke but people heard a thunder and Jesus said the voice came not for your sake but for my sake he heard a voice they heard a thunder the seven Thunders folks the word Thunder is only a symbol for voice it's the voice of God that's why brother brandom says it will take the seven Thunders to wake her up it will take the voice of God to wake her up come on y'all know the quote no manifestations have given the bride Revival is that what he said third seal 1963 Dead's been raised greatest conventions in the world's been held T revivals amen healings all over the world he said no Revival yet nothing to stir up the bride yet it'll take those seven unknown Thunders listen now brother random wasn't he knew what he was talking about he was his ministry God was using but he said it don't wake the bride what's happens not woke the bride up but it'll take those seven unknown Thunders and he knew that it was his job and he was doing it right then because in 1964 he turned around he said the problem with these Pentecostals is they're praying and fasting asking for a Great Awakening he says and they missed it they have missed the Awakening of the Bride so something happened back there in them seals that they miss so watch the noise of a thunder it is the voice of God now I'm only making that clear because let us find the symbols we find out what Thunders means in first seal paragraph 262 the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened see a seal makes something a mystery in other words I can't explain it cuz it's a mystery but when I speak what the mystery is the mystery's gone because you've heard a clear sounding voice it told you exactly what it was and here we are in this age with a prophet look now we've got we've got Ecclesiastes in the Greek we've got Ecclesiastes we got church but now the prophet's going to come and talk about this term called bride amen and it's in the first seal that he says I'm going to call you bride so you understand what he's saying is there's something God had in his mind and it's been sealed mystery all these ages but now I'm going to be able to reveal to you that you are what the Bible was talking about is setting right here amen what is he talking about he's talking about his own Ministry now now in the message of Shame brother brandom is uh brother Bram gets in a lot of he's in a lot of uh discomfort in the message of shame because he's having a lot of times and he's having these dreams and in these dreams brother BR he keeps telling them and that I'm dreaming that I'm slacking off on the job basically and he said I'm looking for what is that something's going to tell me what it is so I can so I can uh uh so I can know I can get this confusion off of me he said so I got up in the morning one morning and he said Lord you're going to have to give me something and he said now I'm I'm encouraging you not to do this guys he said but but I did this because of course it's his office right and he said I did this and asked the Lord to give me something in the word so it would answer what's going on with me and he said when I let the Bible fall open he said it fell open to Genesis 24 and verse 7 now if you're a Bible reader you know Genesis 24 is after the death of Sarah Abraham's wife life it's when Isaac is going to take a bride it's the longest chapter in the book of Genesis and isn't it odd that God would devote so much of the Bible on Isaac taking a wife now the reason being is is because Isaac was going to type Jesus and Rebecca was going to type The Perfect Bride so what God's intention his entire goal of scri scripture is to take a bride for Jesus that is the goal of scripture that is the that is the greatest point of scripture that is the great mystery which has been hid in God is the mystery of redemption of him bringing his bride home amen now now when you start seeing this you'll see that's why that it's the longest chapter in the Bible because it is a very important chapter and when brother random let the scripture fall open here we are in and he's in the year of 1964 65 and he's now being taken to the chapters of Genesis 24 when Abraham would send a servant after this bride now it's powerful if it's a if it's a if it's a if you're a Bible reader it's a powerful read and I would encourage you to go read the entire chapter we don't have time this morning but if you're a Bible reader go read that entire chapter and see that there was a discussion between elizar faithful servant of Abraham and Abraham about his position with Abraham now he was a faithful servant and the Bible tells us that he held everything that Abraham had he was faithful in all things so he sent his faithful servant to retrieve a wife for his son Isaac can you imagine can you imagine guys your dad going sending some not himself but sending somebody go get a a wife for my son son amen but see this man was well trained in the house he knew exactly what they were looking for and he was sent on this long journey and he was going to get a wife now he actually he actually has some uh doubts about his ability because he says to Abraham he says well how do I know that I'll get the right one and how do I know that she'll come with me and how do I know she'll believe what I said and and and when he starts saying this Abraham turn says well look the god that brought me to this land he shall send that angel before thee and he shall do the work now it's a powerful lesson here because the angel went before Abraham now the angel now you know here is speaking of the Angel of the Covenant which is the pillar of fire that later leads the children of Abraham from Goa all the way to the promised land but here this Angel was specifically going before elaser now listen friends that's the angel of the Covenant that is the pillar of fire right and it's going to go out in front of Isaac and it's going to speak to hearts and then Isa or excuse me elaser and then elzer is going to speak with him now that's the same one that brother brandom identifies in the end time as the picture of the Angel of the Lord the angel Angel of the Lord went with elaser to find a bride in the end time we have another El are and the father has sent the same Angel the same angel that picked out Isaac's wife in the Bible is the same angel that will pick out the Bride In the End Time Elie was in that day but the Bible doesn't call him elaser how many knows that how many knows Genesis 24 never says his name's elaser actually I had a Critic bring that up one time and I thought well glory to God I love this because they they meant it as a criticism and I started laughing I said well being there's no name there then that was the point that God left it open to let you know he wasn't exactly speaking of elaser he's talking of the end time he's that's why the Bible said amen that in the when the Luke 24 remember he it's cleopas and his friend it never says who the other guy is cuz he's talking about you he's talking about the friend of the Bride you can put yourself in the vision when there's no name there easily you can go in the v and here here elaser fits right in scripture and he goes for the same Angel the Bible the Bible predicts that the angel goes before him brother Bram told us how long half hour well I don't know about you guys but Revelations 8 is pretty powerful and you start thinking about half hours but anyhow but it went about a half hour out in front of him and it was it was it was it was making her heart ready to receive now here's the thing uh brother Andrew Glover said something down the tent meetings which I thought was powerful some of you I'm sure you wasn't there even heard it but I I'll just repeat it I thought was so good he actually talked about the angel uh softening the heart uh and and what he was referring to was that that Heathen that was on the porch there in Kentucky that squirrel Hunter remember the story and when he started talking to brother brandham he was calling brother Bram a lion a lion preacher he said these bunch of lion dogs these preachers because they're always talking about something that we don't think's there talk about God and brother brandham said to him you think all preachers are like that he said well there's just one now that I'd like to meet his name's brandom and he said why would you like to meet him he said because there was a lady up the hill here a few years ago that had cancer and this man came and held a meeting down here and he called out her sister and told her what was wrong with her sister she was dying with cancer and said you got a hanky in your pocket take that hankerchief and go up there and lay it on her and she'll be completely healed and he said that night we heard sound like Salvation Army was up there said screaming and hollering and he said so I told the wife next morning we'll get the uh wagon go up and get her said when we got up there he said preacher you ain't going to believe us but she was sitting at her table eating breakfast he brother B said you don't say what was look now had that man met brother brandham prior prior to that story he would have called brother random a lion dog too but the angel of the Lord had already been up on that Hillside and already prepared that man's heart and he was sitting there wanting to meet brother brandom listen I'm talking about a god this morning that's prepared your heart at points in your life and made you thirsty for an oldfashioned meeting with the Holy Ghost and an experience with God something in you says there's a God somewhere there's a truth somewhere there's a holy ghost somewhere amen that's the grace of God that came to you [Applause] first and Rebecca what she would have she would have turned that down flat but the angel got there in front of him now there's a great Point here I like brother Ram makes a great point of it and he says that the the messenger came in the evening Zachariah the Bible says that in the evening time there shall be light if you was here last Sunday we went into that quite heavily there should be scriptures being fulfilled in the evening now watch here elaser comes in the evening to a woman who's already communing with an angel the Great Commission upon him is to receive a bride for Isaac and he is strictly told you must take one who is of our lineage you must have a seed line who is my seed line and it even went into conversation and elaser says to him he says look Abraham if I can't get one to come should I take Isaac down there he said no Isaac won't return the bride's going to come to him well you're quiet I thought I heard brother Bram say something like that his feet won't touch this Earth until the Millennium that the bride would go up to him in the air so if you're not willing to go he's not coming back to the Earth for a bride in his physical body he's going to meet his bride in the [Applause] air the only way that this woman would ever meet Isaac was through this servant you can throw him away if you want to but I know he was my ride to my husband man when he started talking to her I think it's amazing brother Bram lays it out beautifully in a message called time of decision he said that elaser decided to trust God not Creeds so he knelt down next to the well and said Lord the woman who's supposed to marry Isaac now he lays out how she's going to respond I thought it was powerful when you uh when you actually go into the to the powerful point of it in the in the fact that he knows her response and he actually says she'll come out and she'll see me here and she I'll ask her for a drink and then when I ask her for a drink then she'll offer me the drink and when she offers me the drink then she'll say I also water your camels now when she came out Ken's a powerful story because he doesn't tell her the whole Revelation all he does when this woman comes out she comes out in the evening time now now do do you think this is fixed up do you think this there's no internet there's no wifi there's no telephones now how did she know to come to the well at that moment and how did he know to be at that well at that time because God has Junctions of times that he orchestrates and he puts people in the right place at the right time and while they were there at the right place at the right time I hope you're hearing me don't you know that God knew you'd be sitting in this seat this morning he'd be sitting right here in this church hearing this sermon this morning yes right and you know what he did he actually prayed said Lord let her respond this way and he asked her for a drink when he asked her for a drink she then gave him a drink and replied and I'll Water your camels also Hallelujah now that was what he asked for wasn't it he wanted that response but he didn't tell her how to respond she knew how to respond and that's a powerful thing because something was in her to tell her how to respond to that now if you're if you're a Bible student you know that brother Adam says any Beast is a symbol of power and he said just as the Harlot rides a Scarlet made Beast he said that's the power the Roman Church has he said so is this Campell a representation that what brought elaser to the well was the power of the Holy Ghost and he said and here it is Rebecca was going to ride those camels back to meet Isaac now now the prophet lays it out he said do you see there she was ready to water the power that would carry her if the power of the Holy Ghost brought William brandom if same power of the Holy Ghost is going to take this bride off of the earth listen doctrines of divinities are not going to give you the power for it psychology is not going to do it for you church membership is not going to do it but the power of the Holy Ghost is the only thing that can break the gravity of this lay out to see an age and put you in the presence of God and I'll tell you this one thing we found out you got to draw water from the well amen and sometimes you come in the house of God it's not that way this morning it's real easy amen but sometimes you come in the house of God and you need a water out of that well what that means is you need to work a little bit sometimes you need to amen when you don't feel it and sometimes you need to wave your hand when you don't feel it and sometimes you need to say praise the Lord when you don't feel it because I'll tell you this if you start out just a little it'll feel real good after a while brother B said I come in a meeting one time he said I come in that meeting he said I thought what a bunch of crazy people he said but the longer I sit there oh he said the better it felt I tell you this listen this morning there's a God Amen that comes on the scene when people begin to praise the Lord it is the watering of the camels come on Rebecca I know you're in this building this morning and somebody's going to water the camels of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what I I'm not going to sit down shut up I'm not going to quit praising God as long as I got a voice in my body I'll say praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God you can think I'm a maniac a loud man a quiet but think anything you want to about me cuz I'm going to tell you this what's going to happen I'm going to praise God anyhow because I done found the power of prayer I done found the power of praise I done understand that when I begin to praise God devil start getting out of the way when I start praising God atmospheres begin to change when I begin to praise God angels gather around me and the son of man comes in the middle of the building somebody say well you don't have to act like that well you know the Bible tells us a story about when they invited Jesus y'all remember that when they invited Jesus and they put a bad name on him and they put a bad name on those holy rollers and they made it Pentecostal in a bad way amen Pentecost is not bad amen when it's an experience it's just when it's a denomination is that right amen and what we found out is is they almost had it blocked out what I'm talking about is sometimes people don't like praise so they'll set on the they'll set on it now they they got Myriad of reasons of why but they set on the move of the spirit and every time it starts coming up amen they feel like they need to just pull it down I almost call them praise police you know amen they're going to arrest anybody that Praises God any anything that moves they're going to they going to turn and look at it and they're going to try to quieten it down now now listen what I'm saying to you is they almost had that completely amen they almost had Jesus completely boxed out but there was this one little woman that when she come walking by amen she took an oil and the Bible said she took a bottle of oil and went into the feet of Jesus and she broke the top off of for that you know what that means Amen brother Mike she broke the top off you know why she broke it off cuz she's going to pour it all out she's not going to save some for next week or next day listen you don't know the cost of the praise that's coming out of the man is preaching to you this morning it cost something to praise God it cost something listen amen you wasn't there when he saved me you wasn't there when he filled me with the Holy Ghost when he gave me a direct leadership of the will of God I say this morning if anybody's got a right to praise Him we've got a right to praise the presence of the Living God [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah carrying water to the camel now y'all know good and well that that took a long time I don't remember I did a study on one time but it was a lot of water and that ain't bad if you got a fire hydrant but when you draw in water it was the most work of a good afternoon hundreds and hundreds of gallons of water they said 10 camels somebody can Google it I don't remember how many 100 gallons it took but it took aund and something gallons to water one camel I don't remember the number there a lot let's just put it that way when she's she's watering these camels and the Bible said he just held quiet he didn't shout loud yet because this is only one of the requirements is that she would do this the other part of this is that she would be a Kinfolk so the minute she stopped watering he looks at her and goes and what house do you belong to is't that amazing who's your dad cuz it matters brother Bram said see the Church of the Living God is blood relation to Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost meaning you can praise him you can water the camel but if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you still can't be a member of that bride but a holy ghost filled bride praising his name amen is exactly what he's looking for who who's your who's what's your name what house are you in and when she began to reveal she came from the house of Abraham's Kinfolk the Bible said that the servant bowed his head and Worship the Lord yall know in Lo in Los Angeles brother man preaches is a message called time of decision which is the subject matter I'm preaching now do you know what his opening verse for that was and the and the servant bowed his head and praised the Lord because he was coming to that choice of the Bride now watch what happens when he when he brings this bride to this point I mean Rebecca Rebecca has heard and and I was reading it this morning and when I started reading this point it literally just felt like Electric my office I mean the anointing just swirled because the Bible tells us that when when he started talking he started telling them about Abraham and how since he left his home and it says and God has blessed him with cattle and with servants and with great riches and a son in his own age and then he says and he's heir of all these things in other words Rebecca you're about to marry one of the wealthiest men there is to marry his father is a great wealthy man and you're going to marry in the money now it's nice if he's goodlooking but if he's got money now you boys that are going to the gym instead of working let me tell you she's more interested in six cars than six- pack just saying I told my wife I ain't got no sixpack I got 24 Hallelujah I don't know how we got here I guess we need to laugh a [Laughter] little where was I at marry him for money that's where we were now it's it's odd because they wanted them to give them 10 days they wanted 10 days and and and Elia wouldn't have it he said look if if if you're going to take him you're going to marry him I've already gave you the message of him either you believe it or you don't there's a lot more to know about about it and we'll tell you on the journey but you got to make a choice to go you got to make a choice to leave your father your mother your denominations you got to leave it all but I got something for you on the journey when you when you mount up on this holy ghost power I'm going to feed you I'm going to water you I'm going to clothe you I'm going to give you jewelry I'm going to give you gifts amen and greatest of all you're going to get him you got to make a decision somebody said brother Wayne I don't know what I'm going to do I require a decision of you I got to say to you you got to make your mind up you can't serve God and the devil either you're going to serve God or you're going to serve the devil I tell you what we ought to do this morning we ought to say I'll go I'll go I'll go I'll go I'll go meet this one somebody said have you got more to go on sorry all she had was the word of that servant Hallelujah and brother Ram said and all you got is the words of this message that's all you got amen but oh god oh I wish I could I wish I could say it the way I see it look his name was elaser just like they had an Elijah in that day there was a little a little black woman down in Memphis that was having prayer remember and when brother Randon comes she he said I had a vision or a dream and I said Lord where is my Elijah and I saw you coming down the road so his name might have been William Brandon but he's my Elijah his name might have been William Brandon but he's my elaser I can't be Rebecca if he's not elaser oh Hallelujah but he's elaser and Isaac amen is Jesus Christ but here's the thing she had to go on his word that's all she had right think about this and he had some gifts that's all he had that's what he had to offer but you know if you follow the message of this the the Vindication of this message goes beyond anything ever written in the history of the world our El eer that came to us could stand and tell the to rise up and walk and then look at you and say make your choice he told the dead on five occasions Rise Up from the dead make your choice come on he stood there and talked to an angel night after night after night our elaser is different there ain't never been an elaser like this elaser Church of the Living God choose choose to go with this message you'll never come in contact with anything so real is the message of the hour not in the history of the world not in the all the days of your life will you ever come in contact with anything like this you must make a choice you must take a choice to leave unbelief to leave doubt to leave criticism oh I know they got their website set up I know there was probably some people behind the well and they went over and said well I don't know if that story was exactly right that elra was telling but you know I don't know I think I think maybe he didn't get it exactly right and them earrings they might be in 10 karat I think maybe come on Rebecca are you sure are you sure you want to do this I think he's I think he's I think he's just I think he's off in the head are you sure you want to follow this man well listen anybody doing you that way has something else they want you to follow so the first thing you want to ask him said what's behind it what do you want me to follow who do you want me to listen to is it some little is it some little unbeliever somewhere is it some critic that hides behind a mic on a YouTube station somewhere we're going to follow that come on Amen ain't got enough power to break an egg let let them raise the dead but God has sent a message in this age with authority and power and the baptism of the Holy Ghost I will follow this man he knows where we're going look at the type it's beautiful Isaac can't come down there the angel said you can't go to that land so he's telling Rebecca you got to go with me come on come on the Rapture isn't one day it isn't one moment it's a process of Time come on Church we're talking about marriage this morning we're talking about water in the in hallelujah hallelujah we're talking about water in that well brother Joe I almost preached a sermon this morning entitled be you drunk with the spirit because right above where I'm reading in Ephesians you know what it says it said be not drunk with wine we're in excess but be ye Fe filled with the spirit brother brandom re re reques that and says don't be drunk with wine be drunk in the spirit and how you going to get drunk in the spirit come on it's the new wine the new wine is stimulation caused by Revelation and the marriage of Jesus on the third day he went to a marriage first miracle he ever did and he turned water into wine and he brought stimulation in the time and they said you save the best for the last Hallelujah listen listen he turned water into wine and fat marriage and at the end time he has promised to take the water and turn it into wine and make stimulation power amen have you ever seen anybody take the water out of the well of Rebecca and Isaac make it into stimulation power for the church but this message did it it brought wine Isaac can't come back to the Earth you got to go to him right and brother BR said that's why he left his house and you left your house and you met up there in the middle right what is it amen it's the meeting it's the meeting in the air all you got is this message that's all you've got that's all you've got he found her in evening light the same as you have been found in evening light elasia was looking for character character that would receive the end time message and so have we received the the end time message listen when we look at this I say this that the prophet of God of this age had a job and it was to get a bride for Isaac the the marriage that we are talking about is a union between you and the word we're not talking about the Corporal body of the Lord this morning we're talking about the word that has been promised to come in this age the prophet of God said it like this and the word as the bridegroom being the word the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union and they unite like a wedding you're the hearer he's the word when you receive the word there's a wedding going on in there there is a union brother Bram called it an invisible Union but a prophet could see in the invisible and he would announce to the church you're no longer two you're now one looking in the Supernatural he was looking at you and he was saying Brother David what a powerful thing he was looking at you and he was saying you're one he wasn't looking there's Jesus and there's you there's Christ there's you he was saying they are now one Christ is in the bride by the word of God made manifest within her amen do you see the prophet of God in the in the message proven his word for you that are a great studiers I I know I'll just bring this one to you so you can Mite it down and take it home with you amen man improving his word brother BR said there's got to come something to unite the two together the church has to be the word and if he unites the two together it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy do you see what I mean is the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh and will make his word so real that it will unite the church in him as the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already united we go to the marriage supper not the marriage all these fleshly Mighty Men the marriage of the Lamb has come see the Rapture is going to be the wedding supper the word here unites with a person and they Two Become One and what does it do then it manifests the son of man again what is happening the marriage has already happened the marriage has taking place now now I I let me just say it to you like that there's many members of his bride right amen there's many members of his bride and there's marriages taking place constantly with this word but there's going to be one supper for the whole body of the Bride of Jesus Christ what is it we are living in the age I'll read it to you now he shall appear in these last days to bring the people back to the word so the bride will know her husband her mate the revealed word isn't that powerful the revealed word is your mate that's why the prophet in turn on the light would look at the church and say it's bride time it's why he would look and say it's seed time it's bride time what's he talking about amen the word the revealed word has come and there has been a marrying that's taking place can I can I deliberate on something to you we okay y'all I want to deliberate on something to you and I want you to see something very clearly this is not you marrying Jesus this is Jesus marrying you this is not you marrying him this is him marrying you I show it to you in the scripture you're a gentile Ruth the mois was a gentile right and her Israelites had moved down in to Moab and when they got ready to return they returned home in the time of of great Peril and great death just like we had in the 1940s when all the Jews were killed and they returned to a Jewish State same thing in the Book of Ruth happened right here in the 1940s and when they returned while they were returning into their Homeland Jesus is going to get ready to redeem them as His People amen but there's a gentile bride that returns at the same time as Israel returns so is the bride that's why the angel coming to brother brandom at the same time that Israel becomes a nation is so relevant to us because it's just like amen Boaz amen at the field of harvest that whenever Naomi returns she returns with Ruth is that right and they were Kinsmen they were near Kinsman brother Ben I thought I'd just come out the back room and shout when you started your song this morning I was like Hallelujah that guy's scary man Heen and and watch it's the greatest love story right there's not a greater love story than the Bible and the story of Ruth and Boaz and Naomi is speaking of Gentile bride the Jewish old old the old of the Old Testament the Jewish woman and is speaking of Jesus as Boaz the kinsman redeemer of the church and when they return they're poor and they've lost all their inheritance and Ruth goes to work in his field and he notices this girl and he ask who is this girl and they said well and me let's just get down to the short of it well she's your kin folk and she come back from Moab and she's working in your field he says to his guys he said look boys he said while she's working y'all just leave little handfuls along the way y'all just drop little bells along the way amen you know what brother B said it was a type of he said it was a type of this bride he said he told the angels of God while this bride's in the field drop little handfuls of purpose in her way that she'll find purpose along the way amen and and and the Bible tells us that she only worked in the field of Boaz which is a type of the church staying in the word amen and it's in the word is where our Redemption is and it's in the word where God is going to give life and you're going to find your your mate is which is Christ but it's not until toward the end of the book of of Ruth and moaz that this book of redemption becomes so beautiful it's whenever Ruth decides amen that that Naomi says look we're we're near Kinsman aen this man can redeem us if you just go to him isn't it beautiful when she goes to him it's in the evening and it's also in the time of harvest which type of us it's in the evening it's a type of the Harvest and she goes into the threshing floor where the seeds are being separated from the Shook and at that time she goes in and lays at the feet of the only one who can redeem her she humbles herself to this message and lays at the feet and when he rises up y'all know the story when he rises up and sees who she is amen he actually ask her who are you she re she reveals who she is and when he finds out she's his Kinsman through Naomi she says will you redeem me and he said I will redeem you oh when she returns home she walks into the house with Naomi the Old Testament scripture she walks in the house with Naomi and Naomi turns back to her and she said who are you because she was returning from the field different than she left she was a girl with a promise a promise from a wealthy man because he was able to do all that he said he could do very quickly you know what she told you know what Naomi told Ruth she said Ruth listen rest yes sir rest and she tells her where she can find her rest she said because this man won't stop until the thing is finished it moved from roof's work to the work a Boaz she couldn't do this part she couldn't open the seals she couldn't bring the word all she had to do was wait till the Boaz was able to unveil this thing to her oh I'll tell you this amen Boaz went down to the city the next day amen actually found a a closer kin which was the devil right and he said to her said to the C will you redeem her he said no I won't redeem her he said well I will so he goes down and gathers all the elders and I wished I had more time to preach on it but I'm going to just give you the story but he goes down and gathers all the elders and brings them around which is the tradition and he has to prove to them his intention with this woman and he has to prove that he's Kinsman of Naomi and he has to prove that he's worthy that he has enough money to do the buying he has the kinsmanship to do it and that he's willing to do it because her other Kinsman wasn't willing to do it because she wasn't worthy to him and when he started testifying to those Elders he started telling the whole story and he started telling look I'm the Kinsman and I've got this much money and I've got this and I've got this and I want to redeem Naomi and the Bible tells us whenever he gave it out they said worthy you're worthy to do it and the Bible tells us that he redeemed Naomi he redeemed the fields amen he redeemed and he got Ruth in the deal Ruth was the whole reason for the deal right Ruth was everything that he was looking for that was the reason of his doing do you know when brother Bram preaches this in Revelations 5 and also the breach that he brings this story every time to describe to the church what the lamb had to do to redeem the church right and he said when they were up in heaven sister Hannah it's a powerful story he said there was one sit upon the throne and he had a book in his hand and that book was sealed in Revelations 5 and when John looked upon this the Bible said nobody was Worthy to redeem there was no Kinsman in heaven to redeem and John said he turned and he said oh there's a line the tribe of Judah had prevailed to take the book and he turned to see a Lon and he saw the lamb and he saw that Jesus that lamb the symbology had become a lion he had become a king he had become the worthy one he' become somebody that could pay the price he could answer the questions he could beat back the en enemies he could redeem everything that had been lost look at the power of this I I don't know if you've ever compared Boaz but look back there when he set before the elders and here Jesus is in heaven when they said there's 24 elders and there's 12 of the Patriarchs and there's 12 new types apostles who all knew the law who all knew kinsmanship who all knew what it would take to redeem and the prophet of God said his act of redemption was to stand before the elders and testify that they are my kin folks can you imagine Jesus standing before the elders before the Patriarchs and taken the Lamb's Book which had your name Jaden which had your name Noah and he stood before all the elders and all the angels and said them are my children and he claimed you with all your problems with all your life with all your situations and he claimed every bit of it and said they belong to me and I am worthy with my own blood I paid the price of redemption for them and he took them and the Bible said while he was giving his testimony the elders begin to throw down their crowns and say Worthy is the Lamb Worthy is the Lamb let me say something to you this morning he is worthy he is worthy he's paid the price and my redeemer is also my husband his name is Jesus Christ and he claimed me when I was in the depths of sin and told Satan take your hands off of this one it belongs to me and when he gets ready to take this bride home let me tell you this there'll not be one sin against her when he gets ready for this bride to walk into heaven amen into his father's house there will not be one accusation there will not be one sin there will not be one recorded problem because the blood of Jesus Christ is Worthy I think somebody ought to say hallelujah he's worthy this morning the blood of the Lamb is worthy preacher what are you trying to get at I I I I I'll make it short in closing I'll say this to you what I'm trying to say is there's been a marriage and with every marriage there's a marriage certificate you say what is your marriage certificate the prophet of God said it was my name on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of of the world every marriage has a wedding ring you say where's your wedding ring brother Bram said our wedding ring is the pre is the unmerited grace of almighty God we're wearing the ring of Grace and our contract is our name is on the Lamb's Book of Life and the Lamb's blood was shame for you and I before we ever sinned the first time I'm not a great student of the Jewish uh laws and arts but I did notice that most Jewish weddings take place on the third day because it was third day there's a double good right because it was first time life came in the earth in Genesis 1 and it was good it was good double good the Third Day Jewish weddings are are around that but Jewish weddings are different because they take a little time they they have a a little season they're a little different there's actually in a Jewish wedding which is what Paul's basing here there's actually a point in the wedding I wish I knew Hebrew I'd tell you the word but there's a word there for marriage contract and when a woman's getting married to a man in Jewish they actually write a contract that says that he will financially support her that he will give her seed for children that he will not live leave her over so many days that she he will he will abide with her that if he leaves he has to come back she has it a marriage contract which is her guarantee they say it's not for the male it's actually written for the woman and when they had this contract what SEALs the deal in the Jewish in the Jewish wedding what is the point between betrothal and wife the point between the two is when he reads off the contract and she willingly accepts it church when this message came and a prophet begin to unveil those word when the seals and the Mysteries begin to be laid out before you the point between church and bride is when you willingly accepted that see modern events I know what the devil keeps saying he's going to steal you he's going to take you we're already married all ready our musicians come they take the marriage contract and it literally is written in their law that it has to be where they both can located at any time so most of the time they hang it in the house hang it visible so maybe he's been gone a couple days on a trip and somebody says he ain't coming back for you all she's got to do is look over and there's this promise I go away to prepare place but I'll come again to receive you under my side he made a promise he going to leave us here wouldn't it be odd wouldn't it be odd to start talking to somebody that's married like that they're going to get married I mean yesterday 28 years to my lovely bride we 28 years well wouldn't it be odd if I got up every morning to reassure that we was married and that would be a very uncomfortable life but anybody's been married very alone knows that after a little while you hit a stride where you understand her she understands you and you just start moving as one and it's not you dominating it's not her rebelling it's just moving as one because your will becomes the same will it ain't long if you if if you've been married very long you know I'm telling you the truth it comes about the grandkids you know it's true and you and your Wheels start meeting together and they just it just becomes a fluid easy Rhythm that you're carrying in your marriage and at this point of the bride of Christ this is not about him making you submit that's why here that true word we don't get up every Sunday with a tu before we don't and some people say well you're not preaching enough clothes line well look the marriage has taken place and if you want somebody if you want to see a changeing them just let them get a little closer let them get a little closer and if they just keep the will after a while the will of God will begin to overcome them something brother bam told me I love I take it personal he said you never saw angels in the spring of the Year climbing up the trees and taking out the old leaves he said you never saw that he said because God designed it that as soon as new life comes it'll start pushing off the old Leaf so all you need to do is fall in love with Jesus amen just fall in love with him he's already your husband when you accepted that just fall in love and let that Spirit just get closer and closer and closer and let it move it away from you oh do you love him this morning won't you stand to your feet with us I'll have to pick this up again sorry [Music] I am [Music] redeemed B with a pride Jesus has changed my whole life
