[1:31] I'll sing [music]
[1:37] [music]
[1:40] as we come together this morning on a
[1:41] Sunday morning. One of my favorite, it
[1:43] is my favorite service of the week is
[1:45] Sunday mornings. I often think of the
[1:47] resurrection and what it what it means
[1:49] to us as believers and Amen. So, you
[1:52] know, I was just um I was just reading
[1:55] uh the prophet saying this morning he
[1:57] was looking in the book of Hebrews and
[1:58] he he called the Bible. He said this is
[2:02] himself in print. He said, "So, when we
[2:05] read it, he said we'd like to stand
[2:06] together." So, if if I could get you to
[2:09] stand one more time. Amen. We're going
[2:11] to uh just have a word of prayer and
[2:14] then we would like to read the
[2:15] scriptures. Amen. Let's just bow our
[2:18] hearts. Father, we thank you today for
[2:21] your grace upon us, Lord, for this
[2:24] gathering of people. We thank you for
[2:26] the great Holy Spirit, Lord, which you
[2:28] have put in our midst and in our hearts
[2:30] today. Father, we ask that you would
[2:33] just lead us now. And father, as we
[2:35] would come to your word, Lord, that you
[2:37] would take your word, that you would
[2:39] touch your children, you would bless
[2:40] them, Father. We ask you to be the voice
[2:43] behind the voice, may you speak to the
[2:46] individual needs that's in this building
[2:48] today. Father, now we ask it, Lord, for
[2:51] your grace. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[2:56] And amen. And if you have your Bibles
[2:58] today, I would like to turn into the
[3:00] book of Hebrews, the first chapter. And
[3:02] I want to read Hebrews chapter 1
[3:06] verses 1 and two. Um I don't know that
[3:11] I'll take every service
[3:14] uh on these
[3:18] uh but I would like to take at least the
[3:20] next couple services, Lord willing,
[3:21] Sunday and then again Thursday uh upon
[3:24] these first two verses. There's so much
[3:26] here. Um I don't think that it's quite
[3:28] possible uh that we would be able to
[3:31] cover it all. Uh at least not if we keep
[3:34] within kind of keep within the times,
[3:38] amen, of something that we are
[3:41] comfortable with. Amen. So in Hebrews
[3:43] chapter 1:es
[3:45] 1 and:es 2.
[3:48] Now God who at sunundra times
[3:52] and in diverse manners he spake in times
[3:55] past unto the fathers by the prophets.
[3:59] But he hath in this last days spoken
[4:02] unto us by his son
[4:05] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[4:09] things
[4:10] by whom he also made the worlds. Amen.
[4:14] God bless you this morning. As you could
[4:16] be seated, I uh
[4:20] just like to if I could to speak to you
[4:23] a little bit here. I'm going to get
[4:25] situated in a moment. We were trying
[4:27] something new and it's not working out.
[4:28] Amen. So, amen. So, in Hebrews chapter
[4:31] 1, uh I I I just uh speaking Thursday
[4:35] along this line, something really just
[4:37] striking my heart personally. Um and uh
[4:40] you can take the crowd out of that a
[4:42] little bit, Ben, wherever you are. Just
[4:45] take the crowd out. Thank you. Amen. Um,
[4:47] so you can see it and uh I was just
[4:50] thinking about this the book of Hebrews
[4:53] and uh something really just striking my
[4:55] heart that we were that we uh would
[4:57] seeing the deepness and the richness of
[4:59] this book and just introducing a little
[5:01] bit if you wasn't here Thursday uh we we
[5:04] spent quite a bit of time on introducing
[5:06] it. So I don't want to reiterate a lot
[5:08] of that but I will say that uh some of
[5:11] the things that brother Brandham had to
[5:12] say about the book of Hebrews is number
[5:15] one he said that the book of Hebrews was
[5:17] written by Paul and he said I think with
[5:20] some spiritual discernment he said I
[5:22] think we could say that that it was
[5:23] written by Paul and then he turned
[5:25] around again and said well maybe not
[5:27] exactly just written by Paul he said but
[5:30] you know uh he said that but the
[5:32] beginning of the scripture says that God
[5:34] who it's under a time so he said, "You
[5:36] can see then it wasn't just Paul that
[5:38] wrote it, but it was a creative being
[5:40] inside of Paul that was using Paul to
[5:43] write the scriptures." Amen. That it was
[5:46] uh God who had sundra time. So, it's a
[5:48] very deep and rich book. Brother
[5:50] Brandham actually calls it the key
[5:52] letter that Paul wrote because it's a
[5:54] letter that is separating the law from
[5:56] the grace. And what it's actually is is
[5:59] it's a dispensational book. It's it's
[6:01] it's changing of dispensation from law
[6:05] unto grace which has given us a a
[6:07] reality. Amen. That God uh is still as
[6:10] much God as he ever was God. But he is
[6:13] changing dispensations. Now we are
[6:15] dispensationalists. We believe in
[6:17] dispensations. And uh maybe on Thursday
[6:20] I'll get deeper into this. But in
[6:21] dispensations we certainly believe in
[6:23] them. uh because here in the scripture
[6:25] it begins by saying God who at sunund
[6:27] times and diverse manner spake in times
[6:29] past and it it literally means by many
[6:33] portions by many times by many ways but
[6:37] it it just is singular God by many
[6:40] portions by many times by many ways has
[6:43] been the one speaking and it's amazing
[6:45] as Paul would say this and then in
[6:47] Hebrews 13:8 Paul will nail down that
[6:50] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[6:53] and forever. So he remains the same even
[6:56] though he speaks in many portions. He's
[6:58] the same God. If he speaks in many ways,
[7:01] he's the same God. He speaks in many
[7:03] times, but he's the same God. Because
[7:06] it's God that is doing the speaking, he
[7:09] is the same yesterday, today, and
[7:11] forever. One thing that we've learned uh
[7:14] throughout the years of studying brother
[7:16] Brandham of course and studying
[7:17] scripture in the light of truth of
[7:19] dispensations we have found out that
[7:22] God's nature never changes. His attitude
[7:25] never changes. It's just his mask or his
[7:28] form is the only thing that actually
[7:30] changes about God. He appears in many
[7:33] different forms remaining the same in
[7:35] attitude, the same in power and the same
[7:38] except for the corporal body. Jesus
[7:40] Christ is the same right here this
[7:42] morning as he was when he walked on the
[7:45] shores of Galilee. He's the same Jesus
[7:48] right here this morning. He's just as
[7:50] live and just as real as he ever is. He
[7:54] is here in another form in another
[7:56] dimension. Amen. Unseen by the eye, but
[7:59] the prophet said by a new birth, you
[8:02] could feel the charge when he steps into
[8:04] the room. Amen. Of course. Amen. The
[8:06] scripture tells us, amen, that God who
[8:09] at Sundra times, now when you think
[8:11] about God who in sundra times, the Bible
[8:14] said many times, many ways, diver
[8:16] manners, he spake in times past. Do you
[8:19] know God can still speak?
[8:22] &gt;&gt; God was speaking back in those days and
[8:24] God can still speak. Amen. As he spake
[8:27] in times fast. Now, in the Old
[8:30] Testament, we're taught that there's
[8:32] three different ways that God was
[8:34] speaking. Amen. and and we found out,
[8:36] brother Bam says we learned, he says
[8:38] that there was three ways to know
[8:40] whether it was God doing the speaking or
[8:42] whether it was man. Now, that's the
[8:44] probably one of the greatest criterias
[8:46] of a believer is to have discernment of
[8:49] what is it you're hearing. Because of
[8:51] course, just because you hear a voice
[8:53] don't mean that you automatically
[8:55] believe that voice. Amen. For the
[8:56] scripture said you should try the
[8:58] spirits. Amen. And so there should be
[9:00] some way. You remember Paul begins or
[9:03] excuse me, John writing the book of
[9:05] Revelations and he starts right there in
[9:06] the first chapters and he said there's
[9:08] many who say they're apostles but
[9:10] they're not. Amen. And and and he says
[9:12] it sounds like you're trying them but
[9:14] you wasn't trying them. You was trying
[9:16] them by the word. You let the word do
[9:18] the trying to determine whether you're
[9:20] hearing from someone who is of God or if
[9:23] it's a different spirit. The spirit of
[9:25] truth, the spirit of error. But in the
[9:27] Old Testament, we could learn whether it
[9:29] was God or not speaking for first it was
[9:31] by a dreamer. See, uh, Brother Bam says
[9:34] like you take it was a dreamer and and
[9:36] and and you take a dreamer that would
[9:38] come or a prophet. He says, uh, if you
[9:40] wanted to see it was right or not, you
[9:43] could take it to the breastplate of
[9:44] Aaron, which they actually called the
[9:47] urum of thumb. How many ever seen
[9:48] pictures that was recreated of the urum
[9:50] of thumb? Actually, it was the
[9:52] breastplate of the high priest of Aaron.
[9:54] It was embedded with 12 different
[9:55] stones. And those stones were each one
[9:59] represented under the birth of the 12
[10:01] tribes of Israel. And and whenever there
[10:03] was a prophet or a dreamer that dreamed
[10:05] or prophesied, they would speak that
[10:08] over that ura mathum. And if it was from
[10:10] God, the lights would flash across it
[10:12] and it would speak to them that yes,
[10:14] this is God. And if it wasn't of God,
[10:17] then they would usually stone the
[10:18] speaker to death because they were
[10:20] trying to bring deception. Now the
[10:23] prophet teaches us very clearly that
[10:25] though the priesthood changed and the
[10:28] yurma thumbum the breastplate was done
[10:29] away with but a new priesthood has a new
[10:32] uromum and the yurmothum of the modern
[10:35] man of the modern church amen is the
[10:38] bible. The bible is the uromothum. So
[10:41] the things that is spoken must flash a
[10:44] light across the Bible. Not across one
[10:47] scripture, but it must dovetail a truth
[10:50] throughout the Bible from the book of
[10:51] Genesis all the way to the book of
[10:54] Revelations. It should dovetail itself
[10:56] if it is truth. Now of course that the
[10:59] Aionic priesthood and under that
[11:01] Levitical law they had the ways that
[11:03] they would do it. See prophets or
[11:05] preachers or dreamers or any of them had
[11:07] to try what they were doing. But there
[11:10] see there is a difference between uh uh
[11:12] maybe just a spirit of prophecy or a
[11:15] minor prophet than there is a major
[11:17] prophet. I mean he realizes the Bible
[11:19] makes a difference in this when he
[11:21] speaks there in the book of Exodus
[11:23] talking about Moses. He said see there's
[11:25] many people prophets who see dreams and
[11:27] have prophecies. He said but now Moses
[11:30] is different. I speak mouthtomouth with
[11:32] Moses and and and and Moses was an
[11:35] actual vindicated prophet. In other
[11:38] words, Moses was born a prophet. Do you
[11:41] KNOW THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE in the
[11:42] spirit of prophecy and a prophet? How
[11:45] many knows that's the truth? There's a
[11:47] big difference. AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF
[11:48] prophecy is a spirit that comes upon
[11:50] them. In the Old Testament, like Saul, a
[11:52] king, would go among them and they could
[11:54] get under the spirit of prophecy and
[11:56] prophesy, but they wasn't actually a
[11:59] prophet. We've seen it in modern times
[12:01] under the gifts of the spirit under the
[12:03] Pentecostals where there was the spirit
[12:05] of prophecy will fall on the
[12:06] congregation. And because we're all
[12:08] believers, do you know the spirit of
[12:10] prophecy can work on any believer in the
[12:12] church that has the Holy Ghost? How many
[12:13] knows that's right? But just because the
[12:15] spirit of prophecy works on you doesn't
[12:18] make you a prophet.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; See, but prophets are born prophets.
[12:22] Amen. In other words, like you take uh
[12:24] brother Brandham. And brother man was
[12:25] born all the way all the way back into
[12:28] even his childhood. He was already
[12:31] seeing visions and having dreams and and
[12:33] God was using him in a spiritual way
[12:35] because prophets are actually born. Do
[12:37] you know Moses's birth was predicted
[12:40] over 400 years before he was born. When
[12:42] God speaking unto Abraham said, "Thy
[12:45] children should sojourn for 400 years in
[12:48] a strange land which they know not, but
[12:50] then I shall deliver them with a mighty
[12:52] hand." Amen. That mighty hand that God
[12:55] prophesies to deliver his children by is
[12:58] by the hand of Moses. Amen. It was God
[13:01] was going to call a man named Moses. So
[13:04] they were all waiting for a deliverer to
[13:06] be born. And just because God moved upon
[13:09] different men, amen, it was Moses that
[13:11] they were waiting for because of his
[13:13] birth. Now there is a difference in the
[13:15] gift of prophecy and the prophet.
[13:17] There's a huge difference. And the
[13:19] difference is one of them must be judged
[13:22] and the other he does the judging
[13:25] &gt;&gt; like the the spirit of prophecy. A
[13:27] prophecy comes forth and we all are well
[13:29] taught in this as Paul would teach from
[13:31] 1 Corinthians chapter 14. Before
[13:33] prophecy can be given to the
[13:35] congregation, it must be judged. How
[13:37] many know that's true? You other words
[13:38] someone in here couldn't just stand up
[13:40] and start prophesying over our people
[13:42] because see there's no way to return
[13:44] that prophecy until in other words if
[13:47] it's wrong what are you going to do?
[13:48] It's already out among the people. But
[13:50] so that's why that Paul said to take
[13:53] away the confusion because God's not an
[13:55] author of confusion. Amen. To take away
[13:58] the confusion, then a prophecy was
[14:00] judged. Amen. And you have two good
[14:03] witnesses that says, "This is coming
[14:04] from God." Then the person prophesying
[14:07] and the two witnesses stand before the
[14:09] congregation and say, "God has spoken to
[14:12] us and this is the word of the Lord."
[14:14] And if that's the truth, amen, the
[14:16] spirit of God is working among you. And
[14:19] if that's not the truth, it's a lie. And
[14:21] those three are to come to the platform
[14:23] and repent for their lie so that people,
[14:26] Amen, can keep trusting God. Otherwise,
[14:29] it is confusing and makes people wonder,
[14:32] CAN WE TRUST WHAT'S SAID? CAN GOD REALLY
[14:34] BE TRUTHFUL? Is it OR IS IT ALL JUST
[14:36] CONFUSION? You Now, now there's a point
[14:38] behind this, but when it comes to a
[14:41] VINDICATED PROPHET, AMEN. YOU DON'T
[14:43] JUDGE HIM. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T STAND
[14:45] THERE and say, "Well, is he speaking the
[14:47] truth or not the truth?" A vindicated
[14:50] PROPHET SPEAKS the word of God and
[14:53] everything else is judged by what that
[14:55] prophet has to say. That's the kind of
[14:58] prophet Moses was. IF MOSES SAID, "GOD,
[15:01] THERE'S GOING TO MEET US IN THAT TENT."
[15:03] That was no argument. That's where God
[15:05] was going to MEET US. IF MOSES SAID
[15:07] THERE'S GOING TO BE SEVEN FEASTS, THAT'S
[15:09] EXACTLY HOW THAT they were going to
[15:11] worship God. MOSES WAS THE KIND OF
[15:13] prophet that could tell them WHERE TO
[15:15] MEET GOD. He could tell them the orders
[15:17] of their WORSHIP AND THEIR SACRIFICE,
[15:19] HOW TO WEAR THEIR CLOTHES. HE COULD TELL
[15:21] THEM HOW TO SET UP THEIR TENTS. He could
[15:23] tell them how to SET UP THEIR FOOD. HE
[15:25] COULD TELL THEM WHAT TO EAT. AMEN. Eat
[15:27] clean, eat unclean. HE COULD TELL THE
[15:29] PRIEST HOW TO APPROACH GOD, WHAT FIRES
[15:31] TO BUILD, WHAT NOT TO BUILD. AND IF YOU
[15:33] GOT ANY OF IT WRONG, YOU WOULD DIE UNDER
[15:36] THE sacrifices or under the great curses
[15:38] of God. How many knows that's right?
[15:39] Amen. because it was the scripture. See,
[15:42] then the words of that prophet became
[15:44] the judge unto that generation. Now,
[15:47] amen. It's not just a a a spirit of
[15:49] prophecy. It is a prophet whom God is
[15:53] working through. And and when you look
[15:55] at the Bible here in Hebrews chapter 1,
[15:58] there's a point behind this. Hebrews
[15:59] chapter 1. If you're looking at the
[16:01] Bible, what Paul is doing here in the
[16:04] first two verses is he's now going to
[16:06] separate for you the difference between
[16:09] the prophet and the son of God. HE'S
[16:12] FISHING TO show you that as MUCH AS YOU
[16:14] SAW MOSES is a prophet, he's going to
[16:17] tell you there is a difference between a
[16:20] prophet and the son of God. He's going
[16:22] to set up to you and I. Amen. That God
[16:25] at one TIME SPOKE UNTO OUR FATHERS. AND
[16:28] GOD SPOKE BY PROPHETS. BUT IN THIS LAST
[16:31] DAY, he is GOING TO SPEAK THROUGH HIS
[16:33] son Jesus Christ. Oh, what a glorious
[16:36] revelation when you see what God is
[16:39] doing here. How that God is using Paul
[16:42] to show us the difference between a
[16:45] prophet AND JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU GO BACK
[16:47] in the scriptures, it's amazing because
[16:49] all of the testaments of the Old Bible
[16:52] testifies of Jesus, doesn't it? When you
[16:54] speak of the of the tabernacle in the
[16:56] wilderness, it's talking about Jesus.
[16:58] It's a three- room house built of skins.
[17:00] Amen. Took nine months to prepare. Amen.
[17:03] You it come from God. Amen. You You see,
[17:05] it's it's and I could go through it.
[17:07] It's the It's the Jesus Christ, the
[17:09] tabernacle. The sacrifices are the
[17:11] tabernacle. I mean, or or are Jesus. The
[17:13] high priest is Jesus. Is that right?
[17:16] Amen. But none of them is actually
[17:18] Jesus. They're only a type of Jesus.
[17:21] That's why you could accept the
[17:23] sacrifice of the Old Testament, but you
[17:25] still needed Jesus. Do you do you see?
[17:27] BECAUSE THEY TYPED who he was. They
[17:29] wasn't him. And receiving those
[17:31] sacrifices was not receiving the
[17:34] fullness of it, which was God himself.
[17:36] If you go back all the way back unto the
[17:38] prophets, like of Moses, and and the
[17:41] Bible tells us that Moses was much like
[17:43] Jesus. Remember, amen. In his birth, he
[17:46] was a deliverer and he was a young child
[17:47] and he was all of the different types
[17:50] that made of Moses. Amen. And but yet
[17:53] Moses wasn't Jesus.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You could look at Moses
[17:58] and take places in Moses's life and say
[18:01] that type Jesus, but it wasn't Jesus.
[18:03] YOU COULD GO IN YOUR BIBLE AND YOU COULD
[18:05] TAKE A man like David. It's David's a
[18:07] great example because Jesus when he
[18:10] comes will actually be called the son of
[18:13] David. And in the book of Psalms, when
[18:15] you start reading some of the Psalms,
[18:16] you say Psalms chapter 22. And when THE
[18:19] BIBLE STARTS TALKING IN PSALMS 22, you
[18:21] can listen to David. And it almost
[18:23] sounds like, amen, that David is
[18:26] speaking of himself on the cross. WHEN
[18:29] HE SAID, WHY THOU FORSAKEN ME? THY bones
[18:31] they stare at me and my tongue cleave to
[18:33] my lip. AND DAVID STARTS CRYING OUT IN
[18:35] THIRST AND TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE MOCKING
[18:37] HIM AND HOW THEY'RE LOOKING UPON HIM,
[18:40] SAYING THAT HE COULD NOT SAVE HIMSELF.
[18:42] How could he save others? BUT THAT
[18:44] WASN'T DAVID. AMEN. THAT WAS CHRIST
[18:47] CRYING THROUGH DAVID. AMEN. YOU SEE, BUT
[18:50] HE COULD TYPE. HE COULD TYPE JESUS. BUT
[18:53] DAVID wasn't Jesus.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Do you see that? It was the
[18:58] spirit of a prophet working there. It
[19:00] was a type of it. It was a type of God
[19:03] using David. If you look at the life of
[19:06] Joseph, Joseph's life doesn't mean very
[19:09] much UNTIL JESUS Christ comes. You can
[19:12] go see the life of Joseph and watch how
[19:14] that Joseph typed Jesus. Amen. How he
[19:17] was hated of his brother and loved of
[19:19] his father. Amen. You you know it's the
[19:21] types. And I'll take just a moment and
[19:22] speak about them. Just remind you
[19:24] remember how how he was loved of his
[19:26] father. They hated him without a cause.
[19:29] Amen. Just as they hated Jesus and the
[19:31] brethren piled on him and beat him and
[19:34] stripped his robes from him just like
[19:36] they did Jesus. Amen. They threw him in
[19:38] a pit just like they did Jesus. Amen.
[19:40] They told the father he was dead and
[19:43] they put blood on the road and told the
[19:44] father he was dead. But he wasn't dead.
[19:46] He was becoming the Lord of another
[19:48] country just like Jesus. They say he was
[19:51] dead there in Israel. He wasn't dead. He
[19:53] was thrown in the grave, but on the
[19:55] third day he rose up. Amen. And become
[19:57] the Lord of the Gentiles. SEE, IT'S JUST
[20:00] LIKE JOSEPH. Every knee will bow. EVERY
[20:03] TONGUE SHALL CONFESS. AMEN. HE WILL
[20:05] reveal himself to THE BRETHREN JUST LIKE
[20:07] JESUS. BUT JOSEPH WAS not Jesus.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; MOSES TYPE JESUS. David type Jesus.
[20:16] AMEN. JOSEPH TYPE JESUS. BUT THEY wasn't
[20:19] him. It was NOT THE ONE THAT WE WERE
[20:23] LOOKING FOR. Though they were a type of
[20:25] him. I think of this today. I think of
[20:27] the grace of God that when you can look
[20:30] at all of the prophets, but there was
[20:32] none of him, them was actually him. And
[20:35] that's what Paul begins to say in the
[20:37] book of Hebrews. He said, "But in the
[20:40] last days, he has spoke through his son,
[20:43] Jesus Christ." See, it was prophets back
[20:46] there. But today, AMEN. IT'S CHRIST THAT
[20:49] IS INSIDE THE CHURCH DOING THE SPEAKING.
[20:53] IT'S NOT JUST A PROPHET. IT'S GOD
[20:55] HIMSELF THAT IS SPEAKING to the church.
[20:58] The first thing we HAVE TO DO IS
[21:00] RECOGNIZE THAT PAUL COULD UNDERSTAND
[21:03] THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS WORKING
[21:05] ON THEM PROPHETS BECAME FLESH AND THE
[21:08] MAN JESUS CHRIST AND HE WAS SHOWING YOU
[21:10] JESUS IS NOT A CONTRADICTION TO THE
[21:13] PROPHETS. HE IS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE
[21:15] PROPHETS. HE'S NOT JUST A TYPE OF THE
[21:17] PROPHETS. HE IS A FULFILLMENT OF THE
[21:19] PROPHETS. OH, WHEN I THINK ABOUT it this
[21:22] morning, oh, what Paul WAS TRYING TO SAY
[21:24] UNTO THEM, HE WAS TRYING TO say that
[21:27] Jesus Christ was God.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Listen, the first of all
[21:34] revelations that we should see is the
[21:36] supreme deity of Jesus Christ.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; You must know he is when you hear his
[21:42] voice. It's the same voice that sounded
[21:45] on Mount Si, that sounded on Mount
[21:47] Transfiguration. It's the voice. It's
[21:50] the son of man. THAT'S RIGHT. SEE, now
[21:52] every time that Jesus comes forward in
[21:55] the church ages, every time he
[21:57] introduces himself, he puts forth
[21:59] something of his deity. That's the first
[22:02] thing he tries to make known to a church
[22:05] is that he's deity. He's God. You see
[22:08] great issues back here with Iranius and
[22:10] them fussing. They tried to say THAT GOD
[22:13] WAS THREE IN cosmics and God was three
[22:15] in persons. Amen. But there is no such a
[22:17] thing. IT'S THE TITLES OF ONE BEING. HE
[22:21] IS THE ALMIGHTY GOD. YOU SEE, IT MIGHT
[22:23] BE FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST. BUT
[22:25] THERE'S NOT THREE GODS. There is just
[22:28] ONE GOD WHO WAS IN THE ATTRIBUTE
[22:30] MANIFESTING AS A FATHER WHO WAS ABOVE
[22:33] US. AMEN. AS A PILLAR OF FIRE. BUT WHEN
[22:37] IT BECAME A SON OF FLESH IN JOHN CHAPTER
[22:40] 1, he became God with us. AMEN. BUT THE
[22:43] BIBLE MADE A PROMISE THAT THOUGH HE
[22:46] WOULD DIE AND BE BURIED AND RESURRECTED,
[22:48] YET A LITTLE WHILE AND THE WORLD SHALL
[22:50] SEE ME NO MORE, BUT YOU SHALL SEE ME FOR
[22:53] I WILL BE WITH YOU EVEN IN YOU UNTIL THE
[22:56] COMING OF the Lord. You see, IT'S IN
[22:59] YOU. THAT'S THE FIRST OF ALL REVELATIONS
[23:01] is that Jesus is deity. HE IS NOT THE
[23:05] third person of A GODHEAD. HE IS THE
[23:08] FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY IN ONE
[23:11] MAN. OH, IF I COULD GET THAT ACROSS TO
[23:13] THE WORLD TODAY, IF I COULD SCREAM IT
[23:15] FROM THE MOUNTAINTOPS THAT JESUS IS THE
[23:18] FULFILLMENT OF EVERY SCRIPTURE IN THE
[23:21] BIBLE, he is the son of God. He is God
[23:25] himself manifested in the flesh.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; The first of all revelations in every
[23:32] church age, he will address himself as
[23:34] deity. Yeah,
[23:35] &gt;&gt; we find it the first of all revelations
[23:38] is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ.
[23:41] Now, we're talking about Hebrews 1 and
[23:43] 2. Don't forget our topic. It is the
[23:46] supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Do you
[23:49] know the most important revelation in
[23:51] this Bible? How many knows what it is?
[23:53] The most important revelation in this
[23:55] Bible, the most important one, Amen. in
[23:58] the Bible is that Jesus, Amen, is the
[24:01] God of the Amen. Listen, he was in the
[24:04] Old Testament Jehovah, but in the New
[24:07] Testament, he is Jesus. Watch the
[24:10] scripture here. O Israel, the Lord thy
[24:13] God is one God. The New Testament does
[24:16] not reveal another God. Amen. It is a
[24:20] further revelation of the one and the
[24:23] same God. Christ did not come down to
[24:26] make himself known. He did not come to
[24:28] reveal the son. He came to make known
[24:31] THE FATHER. HE NEVER TALKED about two
[24:34] gods. He talked about one God. And now
[24:37] in this last stage, we have come to a
[24:39] capstone revelation. The most important
[24:42] revelation, amen, of the Godhead in the
[24:45] whole Bible is that Jesus is God.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. True word tabernacle. Where
[24:52] you at this morning? You let no
[24:55] compressing spirit hold you back from
[24:56] your amens. AMEN. THE MOST IMPORTANT
[24:59] REVELATION in this Bible IS THAT JESUS
[25:01] IS GOD. LISTEN, IF YOU MAKE HIM THE
[25:04] SECOND PERSON OF A GODHEAD, YOU HAVE
[25:06] LOST YOUR POWER. AS A BELIEVER, YOU ARE
[25:08] A POWERLESS CHURCH. YOU'RE A POWERLESS
[25:11] PEOPLE. FOR JESUS SAID, "ALL POWER IN
[25:14] HEAVEN AND EARTH IS GIVEN UNTO ME."
[25:15] THERE'S NOT A SECOND PERSON UP THERE
[25:17] THAT'S A LITTLE LESSER THAN GOD. HE IS
[25:20] OMNIPOTENT IN POWER. AMEN. AND JESUS IS
[25:23] THE SAME THIS MORNING AS HE ALWAYS IS.
[25:26] AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, HE'S GOT ENOUGH
[25:28] POWER TO BLOW THAT UNBELIEVING DEVIL
[25:30] RIGHT OUT OF THIS BUILDING THIS MORNING.
[25:32] HE IS THE SUPREME DEITY. HE IS A SUPREME
[25:35] GOD. AND THERE IS NO GOD THAT CAN STAND
[25:37] BEFORE HIM. HE IS THE GOD OF ALL GODS.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; AND HE IS MY GOD.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; AND WE EXALT HIM THIS MORNING AS PAUL IS
[25:46] exalting him. His name is the Lord Jesus
[25:50] Christ.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a name that's above every
[25:55] name. Yes sir.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; ABOVE EVERY PROPHET. THERE IS NO NAME OF
[25:58] ANY PROPHET THAT WILL COME to the name
[26:01] OF JESUS CHRIST. IT IS A NAME ABOVE
[26:03] every name of every disease. IT'S ABOVE
[26:06] EVERY DEMON. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL
[26:08] IT. I DON'T YOU CALL IT ANXIETY,
[26:10] NERVOUSNESS, SICKNESS, CANCER,
[26:12] TUBERCULOSIS. YOU CALL IT AUTOIMMUNE
[26:16] DISEASE. YOU CALL BLINDNESS, DEAFNESS,
[26:18] WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. THIS NAME
[26:21] OF JESUS IS ABOVE EVERY DEMON, EVERY
[26:24] POWER, EVERY UNBELIEF BECAUSE IT HAS
[26:27] POWER. AND WE EXALT HIM AS GOD. WE DO
[26:31] NOT EXALT HIM AS SOMEBODY WHO WOULD JUST
[26:33] WORSHIP ONCE IN A WHILE. HE'S WORTHY OF
[26:36] OUR WORSHIP. ON OUR GOOD DAYS, ON OUR
[26:38] BAD DAYS, IN OUR MOMENTS OF TROUBLE, IN
[26:41] OUR MOMENTS OF STRUGGLE, HE IS STILL
[26:43] WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. AND WHEN YOU EXALT
[26:46] HIM, YOU BRING A POWER AMONG YOU TO
[26:49] CONTROL THE ATMOSPHERES YOU'RE SITTING
[26:51] IN.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; I know the atmosphere of this world
[26:54] would like to suppress the revelations
[26:56] of God and the power of it. But brother,
[26:58] let me tell you, there's enough power in
[27:00] this message to blow the unbelief right
[27:02] off OF A PERSON, OFF OF A CHURCH, OFF OF
[27:05] AN INDIVIDUAL.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. I REFUSE TO suppress the
[27:10] revelation of God
[27:12] &gt;&gt; to the spirits of unbelief. Amen. Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the fullness of the Godhead
[27:19] bodily. In the book of Hebrews, this is
[27:21] the revelation that Paul is delivering.
[27:24] And he writes it in other places. To be
[27:26] clear, in Colossians 1:15, he said, "He
[27:29] is the image of the invisible God, the
[27:32] firstborn of every creature. FOR BY HIM
[27:35] WERE ALL THINGS CREATED that are in
[27:37] heaven, that are in earth, visible,
[27:39] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[27:41] dominions or principalities, whether
[27:43] they be powers or things that are
[27:44] created by him and for him. He is before
[27:48] all things, and by him all THINGS
[27:50] CONSIST. HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BODY, THE
[27:53] CHURCH. GLORY TO GOD. YOU WANT TO KNOW
[27:55] THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH? IT IS JESUS
[27:57] CHRIST. COME ON. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE
[27:59] HEAD? COME ON. I KNOW PASTORS, AND GOD
[28:01] HELP US. I KNOW PASTORS WANT TO BE THE
[28:03] THE HEAD OF EVERY HOME. LET ME TELL YOU.
[28:06] AMEN. A PASTOR IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN.
[28:08] AMEN. THERE'S ONE HEAD OF A MAN AND THAT
[28:11] HEAD IS CHRIST. AND CHRIST IS THE HEAD
[28:13] OF THE CHURCH. AND AS LONG AS A PASTOR
[28:16] COMES UNDER CHRIST, AMEN, THAT HE
[28:18] OPERATES IN THE OFFICE OF HEADSHIP OVER
[28:20] AN ASSEMBLY. BUT ONLY IF HE'S WALKING in
[28:23] the word.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; We ain't following a man. We're
[28:27] following that word.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:31] My goodness. Amen. Enough with man-made
[28:34] kingdoms. Enough with the denominational
[28:35] and organizational SYSTEMS AROUND THIS
[28:38] MESSAGE. FORGET IT. WE NEED ONE AMONG US
[28:41] AND THAT IS JESUS CHRIST. AND HE IS HIS
[28:44] WORD
[28:45] &gt;&gt; and his word leads.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Call me a maverick if you want to. I'm
[28:50] going to follow this message.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS AND BY HIM ALL
[28:54] things consist. He is the head of the
[28:57] body, the church, who is the beginning,
[28:59] the firstborn from the dead, and that in
[29:02] all things he might have preeminence.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; In all things he would have preeminence.
[29:08] For it pleased the father that in him
[29:12] should all fullness dwell. Now, how much
[29:14] is going to dwell in him?
[29:16] &gt;&gt; You know, a partial portion kind of like
[29:18] Moses or kind of like David or No, in
[29:20] him the fullness dwells.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; My goodness, look at Paul. HE CHANGES IN
[29:26] COLOSSIANS 2. He never changes his
[29:28] revelation. He just changes chapters. He
[29:30] said, "For in him, in the ninth verse,
[29:32] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[29:35] bodily, and ye are complete in him."
[29:38] Listen, you'll never be a complete
[29:40] person till you get in him.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; You're never going to have the life you
[29:44] want till you get in him. There will be
[29:46] nothing can bring you happiness until
[29:48] you get in him. THERE WILL BE NOTHING
[29:50] CAN CONFIRM, COMFORT YOU. THERE'S
[29:53] NOTHING THAT CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY. THERE
[29:54] IS NO SUSTAINING JOY. FOR MY BIBLE SAID
[29:58] THAT THE WICKED WILL HAVE NO PEACE
[30:00] &gt;&gt; IN THIS LAYOUT OF AGE. YOU CAN SEE IT.
[30:02] WE GOT more than we ever had. INCREASED
[30:04] IN MATERIAL GOODS, increased in
[30:06] education, INCREASED IN SCIENCE. WE'VE
[30:08] INCREASED IN EVERYTHING. BUT PEOPLE are
[30:10] more troubled right now than they've
[30:13] ever been. BUT THERE IS A WAY TO SETTLE
[30:15] THE HEART. IT'S TO COME INTO JESUS
[30:18] CHRIST. HE IS THE FULLNESS. AND HIM IN
[30:21] YOU MAKES A COMPLETE PLAN.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. Amen. I can't preach
[30:26] for preaching. Amen. But you see, in him
[30:28] dwelleth the fullness of the godhead.
[30:31] You you you know it was the pillar of
[30:33] fire itself spoke. Amen. In Matthew
[30:35] chapter 3 and said, "Lo, a voice from
[30:37] heaven saying, "This is my beloved son
[30:41] in whom I am well pleased." Let me just
[30:44] give you a a a let me give you a a a
[30:46] good a good uh translation of this. in
[30:49] the one I'm pleased to get in.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The one I'm in, the one I dwell
[30:54] in.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the it's scripture for Jesus
[30:58] said, "I doeth not the works, but my
[31:00] father which dwelleth in me."
[31:04] &gt;&gt; He doeth the works.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Now, now if you go to Hebrews chapter 10
[31:09] and verse 5, this is later in Hebrews.
[31:11] We'll get to it. Wherefore when he
[31:13] cometh unto the world, he saith
[31:15] sacrifice and offerings, thou wouldest
[31:17] not, but a body thou hast prepared.
[31:20] Amen. Do you see that Jesus is the very
[31:23] body that God has got into in its
[31:27] fullness?
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the the Bible didn't go away
[31:31] because Jesus came, right?
[31:33] &gt;&gt; In the book of Amos, the third chapter,
[31:35] if you're a Bible reader, you know it.
[31:37] THE BIBLE SAYS, "SURELY the Lord God
[31:39] will do nothing, but what he revealth
[31:41] his secret unto the servants, the
[31:44] prophets."
[31:46] &gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful, isn't it? Do you
[31:47] think that changed because the
[31:48] dispensations changed?
[31:50] &gt;&gt; No. No. God still reveals to the
[31:54] prophets.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Now, IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE IT PAUL IS NOW
[31:58] separating the prophets from God, from
[32:02] the son of God or the fullness of God.
[32:04] And many people are trying to take
[32:06] scripture like this and make it sound
[32:09] like that God doesn't remain to be
[32:12] prophetic when when when Moses IS NOT
[32:15] TAKING AWAY A PROPHETIC GOD. He's just
[32:19] showing you it will not be partial no
[32:21] more THROUGH PROPHETS LIKE IT WAS IN THE
[32:24] OLD. But in the new it will be God
[32:27] speaking through his son Jesus Christ.
[32:30] Now here's the thing. Amen. Somebody
[32:32] said, "Well, you know what about Jesus?"
[32:35] Well, let me just say very clearly, you
[32:37] do know Jesus is a prophet, right?
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know in Deuteronomy the 18th
[32:43] chapter, the 15th verse, it said, "The
[32:45] Lord God will raise up unto thee a
[32:48] prophet from the midst of thee of thy
[32:50] brethren, liken unto me, and him shall
[32:53] you hearken." You know that Moses
[32:55] prophesied that the Messiah that was
[32:58] coming was going to be a prophet. And
[33:01] when Jesus come, was he a prophet?
[33:04] &gt;&gt; In Acts 3 AND:E 20, THE BIBLE SAID, "AND
[33:07] HE SHALL SEND JESUS CHRIST, which was
[33:10] preached before unto you, whom the
[33:12] heavens must receive until the time of
[33:15] the restitution of all things, which God
[33:18] has spoken by the mouth of all the holy
[33:20] prophets since the world began." So, so,
[33:22] uh, Peter says here in Acts that God has
[33:25] took the body of our Lord Jesus and
[33:26] brought him into heaven. HE SAID, "AND
[33:29] THEN HE SAYS, WATCH UNTIL THE TIME OF
[33:31] the restitution OF ALL THINGS." NOW, NOT
[33:33] ALL THINGS WAS NOT RESTORED in the days
[33:36] when Jesus was on the earth.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; It was not all restituted, was it all?
[33:41] No, it wasn't. All the restitution
[33:43] wasn't there. But look AT WHAT HE SAYS.
[33:45] BUT MOSES TRULY SAID UNTO the fathers,
[33:48] "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise
[33:50] up unto you the brethren, liken unto me,
[33:52] and whom shall ye hear in all things."
[33:55] Do you know that Jesus himself is that
[33:58] prophet like Moses?
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself is that prophet like Moses
[34:05] but he is more than Moses.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; He is a prophet like Moses but he is
[34:12] more than Moses. WE KNOW THE PROPHETS
[34:15] WERE IN the days gone by but today it's
[34:18] Christ. IT'S NOT JUST A PROPHET. IT IS
[34:22] MORE than a prophet. DO YOU SEE THAT?
[34:25] GOD NEVER LOST THE ABILITY TO PROPHESY
[34:28] OR TO FORETELL THE FUTURE. AMEN. BUT NOW
[34:31] WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST A PROPHET.
[34:33] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOD OF THE
[34:35] [screaming] PROPHETS.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. In this last DAY, HE HAS
[34:39] PROMISED that he would speak through his
[34:41] SON JESUS CHRIST. NOW, THAT CORPORAL
[34:43] BODY IS NOT HERE. AMEN. THEN HOW ARE WE
[34:46] GOING TO HEAR FROM GOD? BUT THE BIBLE
[34:48] PROPHESIED the Holy Ghost would come and
[34:51] he would speak.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Hebrews chapter 1, watch
[34:55] this. Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one.
[34:57] Let's tie it to a beautiful scripture in
[34:59] Luke 16. But I want to read this ahead
[35:01] of it. In Sundra Times and diverse
[35:03] manners, he spoke to the prophets. Amen.
[35:06] And the law and the prophets were until
[35:08] John, right? And then the kingdom of
[35:12] God. Uh, put it back up. Put Luke 16:16
[35:14] up there. We're coming to it now. But in
[35:17] the last days, he is speaking through
[35:19] his son. This is from Hebrews 1. He's
[35:22] speaking through his son, God. in
[35:23] sunundra times in diverse manner spoke
[35:25] through the prophets doing the same
[35:27] thing. He's speaking to the fathers
[35:30] through the son Jesus Christ. He's doing
[35:34] God's doing the same things but he's
[35:37] just changing from prophets of the old
[35:40] testament and the law which they pointed
[35:42] to now it's coming to Jesus Christ. He
[35:46] has raised him up from the dead and he
[35:48] lives within us identifying himself and
[35:52] foretelling things. God in sundry times
[35:55] that scripture can't be tampered with
[35:57] and that scripture cannot lie. I've had
[36:00] many people say to me, well, you know,
[36:02] because we believe in a prophet in the
[36:03] end times, they'll say, well, brother
[36:05] Wayne, the law and the prophets were
[36:06] unto John. And it's the oddest thing
[36:08] that they quote that and have no clue
[36:10] what it actually means. They have never
[36:12] considered that there is something
[36:14] written behind the very scripture
[36:16] they're quoting. Let's read it. The law
[36:18] and the prophets were until John. But
[36:20] since that time, the kingdom of God is
[36:24] preached and every man pressth to it.
[36:27] ISN'T THAT AMAZING? In the Old Testament
[36:29] of law AND PROPHETS, MAN COULD NOT GO
[36:32] INTO THAT INNER VEIL. THEY COULD NOT GO
[36:35] INTO THAT HOLY PLACE. THEY COULD NOT GO
[36:38] INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD. BUT SINCE THE
[36:40] LAW AND THE PROPHETS WERE FINISHED,
[36:43] AMEN, now every ONE OF YOU BY THE BLOOD
[36:46] OF JESUS CHRIST CAN PRESS INTO THE
[36:49] KINGDOM OF GOD WHERE THE VERY GOD OF THE
[36:52] PROPHETS CAN COME RIGHT INTO THE CHURCH
[36:54] AND USE HIS GIFTS AND MANIFESTATIONS
[36:57] among you. Amen. Oh, when I think about
[37:00] this, I think about the kingdom of God
[37:02] that is within you. Somebody say, "Where
[37:04] is the kingdom of God?" Well, in Luke
[37:06] chapter 17, Jesus in his own words, he
[37:09] says it here, "And when he dreamed or
[37:12] when he demanded of the Pharisees when
[37:14] the kingdom should come," he answered
[37:17] them and said, "The kingdom of God
[37:19] cometh not with observation." Neither
[37:22] say, "Lo here or lo there, but the
[37:25] kingdom of God is within you." Do you
[37:29] see what Hebrews 1 is saying? It's
[37:31] saying that he spoke through those
[37:33] prophets, but in the last days, the son
[37:36] is going to get into his church. Jesus
[37:39] said it's the law and PROPHETS UNTIL
[37:41] JOHN, BUT AFTER THAT, SOMETHING IS GOING
[37:44] TO COME INTO THE CHURCH. A KINGDOM IS
[37:47] GOING TO BE SET UP WITHIN THE CHURCH OF
[37:50] THE LIVING GOD. JESUS IS GOING TO BECOME
[37:52] THE KING IN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM OF
[37:55] EVERY LIFE IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[37:57] GOD. My when I think about that this
[38:00] morning, it's the kingdom. It's where
[38:02] his word is made power. It's don't have
[38:06] borders like America. But you and all
[38:08] know the Virgin Islands down there is
[38:11] American territory. Puerto Rico, I
[38:13] believe it's No, it's not Puerto Rico,
[38:14] is it? Yeah, it's American territory.
[38:17] Amen. They speak American, spend
[38:19] American money, act like American, do
[38:21] American, BUT THEY'RE NOT actually
[38:22] within the border. But our kingdom rests
[38:25] there. LOOK AT BRITISH BRITISH AND AND
[38:27] THE FRENCH. I RUN INTO the Africans DOWN
[38:29] WAY IN THE JUNGLES speaking a French
[38:31] language. I see THEM SPEAKING A A
[38:34] BRITISH ENGLISH down there in those
[38:36] jungles. WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THAT?
[38:37] From the dominion of England over Africa
[38:41] because English kingdoms were carried to
[38:44] Africa and made those Africans come
[38:47] under THEIR KINGDOM. AND SO HAS JESUS
[38:50] COME FROM THE HEAVENS OF HEAVENS AND HAS
[38:52] SET UP A KINGDOM IN THE HEART OF EVERY
[38:55] BELIEVER. AMEN. AND SET HIM HERE THIS
[38:57] MORNING. JESUS MAY NOT BE THE KING OF
[39:00] THE WORLD, BUT HE IS THE KING OF EVERY
[39:02] BELIEVER SET HIM HERE BECAUSE HIS WORD
[39:06] HAS POWER IN THEIR LIVES.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is where the word has
[39:12] power. 1 Corinthians 4:20 tells us that
[39:15] the kingdom of God is God's word made
[39:18] power. What is the kingdom of God? It's
[39:20] within you. The kingdom is in you. And
[39:23] when the word comes in there, what does
[39:26] it word begin? It turns itself into
[39:30] power.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; When a man has the Holy Ghost and the
[39:35] word comes into you, THIS HOLY GHOST IN
[39:38] YOU turns it into power. When God says
[39:42] you should or you shouldn't, it should
[39:44] be this way. It shouldn't be this way.
[39:46] If you HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, that is a
[39:48] kingdom. It's a command from the throne
[39:51] of God. Do you see? Amen. I know Jesus
[39:54] ain't sitting on a millennial kingdom.
[39:56] So, we'll get into that dispensation
[39:57] later, but let me Y'all remember David,
[39:59] don't you? Who was David had a had a
[40:02] whole host of mighty men and one day
[40:04] laid up there in Bethlehem over
[40:06] Bethlehem looking at that at that well
[40:08] of Bethlehem and laid there and and and
[40:11] just said, "I I would like to have a
[40:13] drink out of the well of Bethlehem." He
[40:15] was not a king down there in Jerusalem,
[40:18] &gt;&gt; but he was certainly a king over the
[40:20] followers he had.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And the prophet made
[40:22] a point out of it and he said David
[40:25] desired a drink from that well. But
[40:28] David's desire to them was a command.
[40:32] AMEN. HE didn't have to to command them
[40:34] a certain thing. HE JUST TOLD THEM HIS
[40:37] DESIRE and it became a command of their
[40:40] heart. That's why you don't have to beat
[40:42] believers into believing the message or
[40:44] beat them INTO CERTAIN LIFESTYLES
[40:46] BECAUSE if they KNOW GOD DESIRES IT.
[40:48] AMEN. IT'S A COMMAND in the kingdom of
[40:50] God.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you this, the millennium's
[40:55] coming, but we won't change kings.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; We're not going to change kings. Amen.
[41:01] We got the same king now. You see,
[41:03] PAUL'S TELLING THEM THIS IN THE HEBREWS,
[41:05] YOU'RE NOT CHANGING KINGS. JEHOVAH, WHOM
[41:08] YOU HAVE FOLLOWED, HAS JUST BECOME JESUS
[41:11] CHRIST IN THE FLESH. You didn't change
[41:13] kings,
[41:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:16] But he's manifesting fuller among you,
[41:19] church. See, what is it? It's the Holy
[41:21] Spirit. I love how Brother Brandon
[41:23] speaks this. He says, see, Hebrews 1 is
[41:25] saying the Holy Spirit will take
[41:27] possession.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; He's taking the possession to operate
[41:32] Christ in the church.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; that's what's going on. He's taking
[41:37] possession. Hebrews 1 is a prophecy.
[41:41] He's going to take possession of human
[41:43] bodies.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:45] that God through the sacrifice of Jesus
[41:49] Christ is going to claim human bodies
[41:53] for his own body.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Think about that. That you'll be bought
[42:02] with a price paid for
[42:04] &gt;&gt; and claimed by Jesus Christ. What What
[42:08] you I I don't have a better word to say
[42:10] it than modern terms. It's a Holy Ghost
[42:12] takeover. YEAH,
[42:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S A HOLY GHOST TAKEOVER. THAT'S WHAT
[42:17] PAUL is predicting HERE IN HEBREWS 1.
[42:20] HE'S NOT SAYING GOD IS FINISHED WORKING.
[42:24] HE'S SAYING GOD IS GETTING CLOSER.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; HE WAS ABOVE YOU. HE WAS WITH YOU. BUT
[42:30] NOW HE'S COMING IN YOU. GOD AIN'T
[42:33] GETTING FARTHER. GOD'S GETTING CLOSER.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE HOW MEN will take the scripture
[42:39] AND THEY'LL BLOCK GOD out of the PEOPLE
[42:41] BY SCRIPTURE. THIS SCRIPTURE IS not
[42:43] ending the manifestations of God. It's
[42:46] bringing them closer to you.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; My goodness. My goodness. Amen. That you
[42:52] you can can I I'm going to just touch
[42:54] this because I'm coming back to it later
[42:56] in the series. But in Hebrews chapter 2,
[42:58] watch this in the first verse. Hebrews
[43:00] 2:1. Therefore, we ought to give a more
[43:02] earnest heed to the things which we have
[43:04] heard, lest at any time we should let
[43:06] them slip. I'll have to come back and
[43:09] preach on that. That's really good,
[43:10] ain't it? Amen. For if the words spoken
[43:13] by angels, now listen to that, if words
[43:16] spoken by angels were steadfast, look up
[43:19] the word angel, it's a small a, it's
[43:21] angelos, which means messengers.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Let me let me read it to you as if you
[43:27] wasn't reading it English transferred
[43:28] Greek. Let's just say it like this. If
[43:30] the word spoken by prophets,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; was steadfast and every transgression
[43:36] and disobedience received a just
[43:39] recompense of reward. In other words, if
[43:41] the things that were spoken by prophets
[43:44] were powerful and and and must be
[43:46] understood and took notice of, how then
[43:49] shall we escape if we would let a such a
[43:53] great salvation which has began to be
[43:56] spoken?
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Not by angels.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; WHO'S DOING THE SPEAKING NOW?
[44:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S NOT ANGELS SPEAKING. IT'S
[44:10] SPOKEN BY THE LORD.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHAT PAUL IS PUTTING IN
[44:14] HEBREWS 1? NOT PROPHETS, JESUS CHRIST.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S COMING TO THE CHURCH IN THE NEW
[44:20] TESTAMENT? IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AN OLD
[44:22] TESTAMENT LAW. It's it's God getting in
[44:26] a man and speaking to the church. Look
[44:29] at how powerful this is. Amen. Look in
[44:32] Hebrews chapter 3 because we're talking
[44:34] about God speaking, right? Hebrews
[44:35] chapter 3, watch in the seventh verse.
[44:38] Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith,
[44:39] today, if you will hear his voice,
[44:42] harden not your hearts, as in the
[44:44] provocation, in the day of temptation in
[44:46] the wilderness, when your fathers
[44:48] tempted me and proved me, and saw my
[44:50] works 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved
[44:53] with them that generation, and said,
[44:56] they do heir in their heart, and they
[44:58] have not known my ways. So I swear in my
[45:02] wrath, they shall not enter into my
[45:04] rest. Now look what it is. Wherefore
[45:06] though, as the Holy Ghost said, today if
[45:08] you will hear his voice. So, HE WAS
[45:09] SAYING GOD WAS SPEAKING back there to
[45:11] them. And they didn't get in their rest.
[45:13] Now, why didn't they get there? BECAUSE
[45:15] THEY DIDN'T KNOW GOD'S WAY. THEY WASN'T
[45:17] ABLE TO RECEIVE GOD'S VOICE. BUT HE
[45:20] SAID, "DON'T YOU DO THE SAME THING NOW
[45:22] THAT THE LORD IS SPEAKING? When you hear
[45:25] his voice, don't you harden your heart."
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Look what he tells us in Hebrews chapter
[45:30] 4 and verse one. And he begins to say,
[45:32] "Therefore, let us fear a promise left
[45:34] of us of entering the rest." In other
[45:36] words, Amen. Here's where you get
[45:37] scared. There's no rest. But if there is
[45:40] a rest, don't have any fear. It's a
[45:42] promise. For unto us was the gospel
[45:45] preached as well as unto them. But the
[45:48] word preached DIDN'T PROFIT THEM, NOT
[45:51] being mixed with faith that heard it.
[45:53] NOW, WHY DIDN'T THEY GO into the
[45:55] promises back there under Moses? BECAUSE
[45:57] THEY DIDN'T MIX WHAT THEY heard with
[45:59] faith.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Do you see? It wasn't the immorality
[46:02] that was killing Israel. It wasn't the
[46:05] transgressions of the LAW THAT WAS
[46:07] DESTROYING ISRAEL. IT WAS THE LACK OF
[46:10] BELIEVING WHAT GOD HAD SAID UNTO THEM.
[46:13] AMEN. AND I SAY THE SAME THING TODAY.
[46:15] IT'S NOT JUST UNCLEAN LIVING BECAUSE
[46:18] THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD LIVING PEOPLE THAT
[46:20] DON'T BELIEVE GOD, BUT IT'S THAT
[46:22] SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WILL HAVE A HEART FOR
[46:25] THE THINGS THAT GOD SAYS. And I I don't
[46:28] have time to preach it, but I'll just
[46:29] give it to you in the Bible just so you
[46:31] remember. Jesus looked at the Pharisee.
[46:33] What did he say to him? You snake in the
[46:35] grass. You're full of dead man's bones.
[46:38] Remember, he said, "You garnish the
[46:39] tombs of the prophets and you're THE
[46:41] ONE." LOOK AT HOW HE TALKED TO THEM. YOU
[46:43] HYPOCRITE, YOU WHITEED WALL. JESUS IS
[46:46] TALKING TO THEM THAT WAY. WHY IS HE
[46:48] DOING IT? For their immorality? Nope.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; CUZ THEY WASN'T IMMORAL. THEY had the
[46:52] law down to the letter. You couldn't put
[46:55] one THING ON THEIR LIFE. IT WAS BECAUSE
[46:57] THEY WERE ACTUALLY REFUSING THE VOICE OF
[47:01] GOD IN HIS FULLNESS IN THAT AGE. YOU CAN
[47:04] LIVE HOLY. You can live clean. BUT WHEN
[47:07] GOD SPEAKS, YOU'VE GOT TO HUMBLE YOUR
[47:09] HEART AND SAY, "LORD, I ACCEPT YOUR WORD
[47:13] IN MY GENERATION." IT'S NOT THAT GOD
[47:15] QUITS SPEAKING, but he speaks various
[47:18] WAYS IN VARIOUS TIMES, BUT TODAY HE
[47:20] SPEAKS through his son, Christ Jesus,
[47:23] who is our king. My goodness. Then I
[47:27] say, "Let us labor to enter into the
[47:29] rest of God." [laughter]
[47:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHERE THE HOLY Ghost rules over
[47:33] every life. Now, when I when I think of
[47:36] this, you see what's going on is Paul is
[47:39] showing that God is now transferring
[47:42] into the church. He's become the Holy
[47:46] Spirit in the church. In John 14 and
[47:48] verse 16, let's read something here.
[47:51] very very uh beautiful reading where
[47:54] sometimes people will take you to say
[47:56] there's well there's a couple of them in
[47:58] in the godhead but watch this and I will
[48:00] pray the father see there's one and he
[48:03] shall give unto you the comforter
[48:04] there's two and they shall abide with
[48:06] you forever even the spirit of truth
[48:08] whom the world cannot receive so Jesus
[48:10] is talking and the father and the spirit
[48:12] he he's discussing this as it's
[48:14] different doesn't he
[48:15] &gt;&gt; but how many realizes the father and the
[48:17] spirit's the same thing
[48:19] &gt;&gt; yeah Yeah.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 1.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The father of Jesus Christ is God.
[48:26] Is that right?
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible tells us it's his father.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; But when the Bible also speaks that when
[48:34] the angel come to Joseph, he said to
[48:35] him, "Fear not to take Mary thy wife,
[48:37] for the thing she conceived is is of the
[48:40] Holy Ghost."
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Who was the father? The Holy Ghost or
[48:44] the father?
[48:45] BUT BECAUSE GOD IS A SPIRIT,
[48:49] &gt;&gt; come on.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; The father is a spirit.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Then the father and the spirit's the
[48:55] same thing. USING TWO DIFFERENT ENGLISH
[48:56] WORDS, but it's the same thing.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; It's not two different spirits. NOT TWO
[49:02] DIFFERENT GODS. SAME THING.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; But watch what Jesus says here. Even the
[49:06] spirit of truth whom the world cannot
[49:08] see. Now he's making it sound like the
[49:10] comforter is different from him. But
[49:12] watch what he says now. The world cannot
[49:14] see because it seeth him not, neither
[49:16] knoweth him. But you shall know him. He
[49:18] dwelleth with you. Shall be in you. I
[49:21] will not leave you comfortless.
[49:23] For I will come. Oh, I thought the Holy
[49:25] Ghost was coming.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; But I will not leave you comfortless.
[49:31] For I will come to you yet a little
[49:33] while and the world seeth me no more,
[49:36] but ye shall live because I live. You
[49:39] shall live also. And at that day you
[49:41] going to know this that I am in my
[49:43] father and ye in me and I in you.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; What's he doing? Amen. He's prophesying
[49:51] of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. IS GOING
[49:54] to speak through the believer.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? Amen. When I look at
[50:01] this and look at our Lord Jesus coming
[50:03] to the earth, how many knows the Bible
[50:05] called him Emmanuel? Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; He was God with us. Amen. Matthew
[50:12] chapter 1 and 23 in John. John records
[50:15] him in John 1 and1 and said, "In the
[50:17] beginning was the word
[50:19] &gt;&gt; and the word was with God
[50:22] and the word was God."
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:26] &gt;&gt; In the 14th verse, he said, "And that
[50:28] word was made flesh and dwelt among us."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I'm moving too fast. I got
[50:35] a lot to hit. But in the book of
[50:37] Hebrews, the 4th chapter and THE 12TH
[50:39] VERSE, PAUL is saying that the word is a
[50:43] discerner of the thought and the intent
[50:46] of the heart.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; SO LET'S SEE. JESUS WAS the word. And
[50:50] when he went to the woman at the well,
[50:51] how many ever read the account in John
[50:53] chapter 4? And Jesus went to the woman
[50:55] at the well. And when he began to talk
[50:57] to her, he talked about her going to get
[50:59] her husband and bringing him. And she
[51:00] said, "I don't have one." He said,
[51:02] "That's right."
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. you've had six and the one
[51:06] you're living with ain't yours. AND SHE
[51:09] GOT SO EXCITED. SHE SAID, "SIR,
[51:13] I perceive thou art a prophet." He said,
[51:15] "That's right."
[51:17] &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, WE WE'RE
[51:19] EXPECTING THE MESSIAH." HE SAID, "I am
[51:21] he."
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet and the Messiah was the
[51:27] same thing.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? JESUS WAS MORE
[51:31] than a Messiah. HE WAS THE PROPHET.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; YEAH. THAT THEY HAD LONGED TO see and
[51:36] proved it by the discernment of the
[51:38] spirit of the woman at the well. Brother
[51:40] man, it's a beautiful reading. If you
[51:42] like the Bible, it's beautiful because
[51:44] this woman heard it one time and
[51:46] recognized that was the Messiah talking.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. DIDN'T MATTER WHAT HIS body looked
[51:51] like because, AMEN, THE BIBLE said he
[51:53] wasn't anything to look at. AND ISAIAH
[51:56] 53 said he was uncumbly. Amen. And the
[51:58] tree OF LIFE HAS ALWAYS been uncumbly.
[52:01] It's the TREE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IS
[52:03] BEAUTIFUL and looks good. Come on,
[52:05] church. Amen. But he BEGAN TO DISCERN
[52:07] THAT same Jesus. That was a Samaritan.
[52:09] He walked over to the Jews and he looked
[52:11] at them Jews and and and he walked over.
[52:13] Remember, Amen. Nathaniel run down to
[52:15] Philillip and said, "Come see the
[52:17] Messiah. I found him." And Philip goes
[52:19] up the hill and sees this man Jesus
[52:21] who's no different than any other
[52:23] Pharisee or any other theologian. He
[52:25] looks just like the rest of them. But
[52:27] when he walks up in the prayer line,
[52:29] this man looks at HIM AND SAID,
[52:31] "PHILLIP," AMEN. He calls him, he said,
[52:33] "An Israelite in whom no G." And the man
[52:35] says to him, "Since when do you know
[52:37] me?"
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And the most beautiful words come out of
[52:40] his mouth. He said, "I knew you." He
[52:42] said, "Before Nathaniel come to you up
[52:44] there at that fig tree?"
[52:46] &gt;&gt; And the man WAS SO BLOWN AWAY THAT HE
[52:50] SAID, "THOU ART the king
[52:54] &gt;&gt; of Israel."
[52:55] NOW, NOW LOOK WHAT HE DONE. HE HAS NOW
[52:58] identified that that word is a
[53:00] discerner. It is God. IT IS THE MESSIAH.
[53:04] IT IS THE PROPHET. IT IS THE KING. AND
[53:06] THAT JUST ONE TIME, MY GOODNESS, JUST
[53:10] ONE TIME. AND PHILIP KNEW WHO HE WAS.
[53:13] ONE TIME THE WOMAN KNEW WHO HE WAS. JUST
[53:15] ONE TIME. And Peter knew who he was. And
[53:18] we have today, amen, records of over
[53:21] 8,300 TIMES ON TAPE WHERE A PROPHET HAS
[53:25] SAID THINGS TO PEOPLE WHERE YOU'RE FROM,
[53:27] WHAT YOUR NAME IS, WHAT YOUR CHILDREN
[53:28] ARE, WHAT YOUR ADDRESS IS, WHAT YOUR
[53:30] SICKNESSES ARE. I SAY, SIR, THOU ART A
[53:34] PROPHET. AMEN. BUT THERE MUST BE MORE
[53:36] THAN A PROPHET THERE.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; It's got to BE MORE THAN A PROPHET
[53:41] THERE.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Glory be to God. Amen. It
[53:48] was. Amen. The word is a discerner.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; It was the son of God that was upon the
[53:54] earth. Now, look what he says here in
[53:57] Hebrews 5. I'm going to preach the whole
[53:58] book of Hebrews to this morning. Hebrews
[54:00] chapter 5, look in the fifth verse. I'm
[54:03] sorry. I'm I'm going to probably throw
[54:05] about 100 scriptures at you. It might
[54:07] feel more like Bible study than
[54:08] preaching, but but it's going to feel
[54:10] pretty good because you know I'm telling
[54:11] you the truth. Yeah.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 5, SO
[54:14] ALSO CHRIST glorified not himself to be
[54:17] made manifest a high priest, BUT HE THAT
[54:19] SAID unto him, there it is, he that said
[54:23] unto him, thou art my son, and today I
[54:26] have begotten thee. So he did have a
[54:28] father because it was he was not his own
[54:30] father. He was the son of the spirit.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Right. as he also said in another place.
[54:36] I always like when Paul says that IN
[54:38] ANOTHER PLACE, "THOU art a priest
[54:40] forever after the order of Melkazedc,
[54:44] who in the days of his flesh, when he
[54:45] had offered prayers and supplication,
[54:47] strong crying and tears unto them that
[54:50] was able to save him from death, and was
[54:52] heard in that he feared. Though he were
[54:54] a son, yet he learned he obedience by
[54:57] the things he suffered." He was
[54:58] altogether human, wasn't he? And though
[55:00] he were a son, HE SUFFERED. AND BEING
[55:02] MADE PERFECT, HE BECAME THE AUTHOR of
[55:06] eternal salvation. My I don't know if I
[55:09] I feel like shouting right there. HE
[55:11] BECOME THE AUTHOR OF ETERNAL. THERE IS
[55:14] AN ETERNAL SALVATION, FOLKS. THERE IS A
[55:17] SALVATION THAT'S NOT A CHURCH SERVICE TO
[55:20] A CHURCH SERVICE. IT'S NOT YEAR TO YEAR.
[55:23] IT'S NOT PROBLEM TO PROBLEM. IT IS
[55:25] ETERNAL.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Just as much as GOD IS ETERNAL, THE
[55:29] SALVATION of God is eternal. Paul is
[55:32] introducing something, sister Rald. It's
[55:34] different than that Old Testament. From
[55:36] year to year, they had to go. But Paul
[55:39] is saying now there's an eternal. We're
[55:41] not returning yearly. We come to this
[55:43] priest one time and it fixes it
[55:46] eternally.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Man made perfect and
[55:50] eternal salvation. He was called of God
[55:54] a priest after the order of Melkazedc.
[55:58] [laughter]
[55:59] Man, what a reality. Melkazedc sound
[56:01] like a big name, doesn't it? But you
[56:03] know, I know people are all confused on
[56:05] who that Melazedc was. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU
[56:08] YOU GOT A Bible in front of you.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And though things were written here,
[56:12] there was not understanding on some of
[56:14] this. But according to the book of
[56:16] Revelations, if you won't discount it
[56:18] now in Revelations the 10th chapter and
[56:20] the seventh verse, my Bible said, "In
[56:23] the days of the voice of the seventh
[56:26] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[56:29] mystery OF WHAT?"
[56:31] &gt;&gt; GOD
[56:31] &gt;&gt; OF GOD should be finished. AMEN. THEN IF
[56:34] THERE WAS A GREAT MYSTERY over who's
[56:36] this Melazdc, wouldn't it be this
[56:38] seventh angel coming to solve out the
[56:40] matter? Wouldn't it be him that was
[56:42] going to tell us WHAT IT REALLY WAS and
[56:45] will it really come from? AMEN. IT'S
[56:47] CHRIST HIMSELF, CHURCH. LOOK IN
[56:49] REVELATIONS the 10th chapter in the
[56:51] first verse and SEE WHEN JOHN SEES A
[56:53] MIGHTY angel descending out OF HEAVEN.
[56:56] IT'S NOT ONE OF THE PROPHETS.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF THAT IS COMING TO
[57:01] THE CHURCH. IT'S NOT ONE OF THE
[57:04] PROPHETS.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; He's coming. And when he comes, he has
[57:07] seven thunders. And they uttered their
[57:08] voices. But John, he couldn't write it
[57:10] back then.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; But when this seventh angel begins to
[57:14] sound,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; well, seven thunders, what are they?
[57:18] That's that's real easy. That is not a
[57:20] complicated thing. You want me to tell
[57:21] you what they are? It's the voice of
[57:23] God.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; The voice of God. And when the seven
[57:27] seals sounded, it's the revelations
[57:30] contained in the seven seals that God
[57:32] has spoken in this generation.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So those seven thunders, do you see? Now
[57:36] watch this. in Hebrews chapter 7. Amen.
[57:39] This is the thing. The one that came,
[57:41] the one that Paul is talking about, this
[57:43] Melkazedc, DO YOU KNOW HE WASN'T A
[57:45] PRIEST, he was a person. He wasn't just
[57:47] a priesthood or figment. He was an
[57:50] actual person.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 7, watch Paul will
[57:53] say this. Consider now how great this
[57:56] man was.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Now, he's talking about he's talking
[58:00] about in the Bible Melazedc that met
[58:03] Abraham. And when Paul talks about him,
[58:06] he said, "Think about how great this man
[58:08] was." So, Brother Bam said, "I want to
[58:10] point out here to you that it was not a
[58:13] priesthood. It was a person."
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And whoever that person was, he's still
[58:19] alive.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Because the next verses said he was
[58:23] without beginning of days or an ending
[58:26] of life.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was God. He was a person. And
[58:30] that PERSON WAS GOD. NOW, YOU can't
[58:33] really catch the revelation until you
[58:35] until you look at the at the Bible and
[58:37] and you and you and you see that God is
[58:39] Elohim, right? Self-existent.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; He's a spirit, RIGHT?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, GOD wanted to talk to
[58:46] Abraham. So, he just reached down and
[58:48] picked up 16 elements, created a body,
[58:50] stepped into it in various times, in
[58:52] various ways. He spoke into Abraham. HE
[58:56] GOT INTO THAT BODY and went down and
[58:58] visited with Abraham in Genesis the 14th
[59:00] chapter.
[59:02] Now, Paul was reading Genesis 14 when
[59:06] he's commenting in Hebrews 7. See, he's
[59:09] taught in THE BIBLE THAT PAUL HAS THE
[59:11] SAME OLD TESTAMENT you got.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Read Hebrews uh Genesis with me. Let's
[59:17] see what Paul had to read about about
[59:18] this what he's speaking of in Genesis 14
[59:21] and 18. And Melkazedc, king of Salem,
[59:25] brought forth the bread and wine. And he
[59:27] was the priest of the most high God. And
[59:30] he blessed him. And he said, "Blessed be
[59:32] Abraham of the most high God, possessor
[59:35] of heaven and earth." And he blessed be
[59:37] the most high God, which hath delivered
[59:39] thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave
[59:41] him tithes of all. He was a man. He was
[59:45] a person. He spoke and talked to
[59:47] Abraham, and he brought brine and bread.
[59:50] The first communion served. Here's the
[59:53] man that served communion.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Now, it's amazing because this man was
[59:59] speaking unto Abraham. Now, it's God in
[1:00:03] various times, in various ways. NOW, IF
[1:00:05] YOU GO BACK TO THE BIBLE, HOW FAR can
[1:00:08] God come down and you still recognize
[1:00:10] he's God? See, because you can recognize
[1:00:12] Elohim, the pillar of fire. You, OH,
[1:00:14] THAT'S GOD. BUT WATCH NOW. AMEN. Later
[1:00:16] in Genesis 18, THE BIBLE RECORDS THAT
[1:00:20] THREE MEN COME, AMEN. to Abraham's tent
[1:00:22] door. And one of them Abraham looks at
[1:00:26] and says, "My Lord."
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED THAT MAN his God.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. Have you ever
[1:00:36] wondered how far God can come down?
[1:00:38] Well, let me tell you this. He come all
[1:00:40] the way down until he got into a body
[1:00:42] that had dust on his clothes. He had a
[1:00:45] stick in his hand. He had dirty feet
[1:00:48] because Abraham washed them. HE WAS
[1:00:50] HUNGRY. He could eat. HE COULD SERVE
[1:00:52] BREAD. HE COULD BE A PART. AMEN. HE
[1:00:54] COULD TALK AND FELLOWSHIP WITH ABRAHAM.
[1:00:57] BUT ABRAHAM WAS A SEED. AND HE KNEW
[1:00:59] THERE'S ONLY ONE GOD. AND THIS IS HIM IN
[1:01:02] THIS MAN.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Look at the power of that.
[1:01:08] Recognizing that God was in that man.
[1:01:11] Now, now Abraham believed in one God.
[1:01:14] That's all he believed
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; in one God. He didn't believe in
[1:01:16] multiplicity of gods. He didn't come out
[1:01:17] of Babylon. You couldn't sell him that.
[1:01:20] Amen. But he believed in one God. Paul
[1:01:23] is trying to show the church, these
[1:01:26] Jews.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; These Jews that And you can't see it for
[1:01:30] us till you see it for them.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; He's trying to show them Jews. That
[1:01:35] pillar of fire that y'all's worshiped
[1:01:37] over with Moses. And that pillar of fire
[1:01:39] that you believe in, he's the one that
[1:01:42] got into this man, JESUS CHRIST. THIS
[1:01:44] GUY YOU'RE CRUCIFIED, THE ONE YOU HAVE
[1:01:46] THROWN OUT. AMEN. THAT IS GOD THAT HAS
[1:01:50] MANIFESTED in his son.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; He was telling them God ain't changed.
[1:01:54] He is just now manifesting himself in
[1:01:58] the form of his son. DO YOU KNOW THAT
[1:02:00] THE BIBLE TELLS US, AMEN, THAT THAT that
[1:02:02] when gen and and and this is relative to
[1:02:05] our thought in Genesis chapter 14 when
[1:02:08] when Melazdc comes, he's representing
[1:02:11] the coming of Jesus Christ, right?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; He's coming with communion. But when he
[1:02:17] comes, he's not coming with a lamb at
[1:02:20] this time.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He's bringing a restoration to Lot and
[1:02:24] he's bringing a restoration to the
[1:02:26] ministry, but he's not coming with a
[1:02:28] lamb at this time. But he did serve them
[1:02:30] communion. Do you know that Jesus
[1:02:32] himself serves communion years later
[1:02:35] just like Melazdc did because Melazdc
[1:02:38] became Jesus Christ?
[1:02:42] BUT IN GENESIS 14, he didn't have a lamb
[1:02:45] for a sacrifice.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he have a lamb, folks?
[1:02:50] Because he was God.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Now, look, David had a lamb, didn't he?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And and and and Moses had a lamb.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PEOPLE,
[1:03:00] THEY HAD A LAMB THAT THEY could offer.
[1:03:02] But until Jesus was born,
[1:03:06] GOD HAD NO LAMB HIMSELF.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, HE COULDN'T OFFER THE
[1:03:12] FIRSTLANDS of the flock. GOD COULDN'T
[1:03:15] OFFER. HE COULDN'T GO DOWN AND TAKE ONE
[1:03:17] OF THEM LITTLE LAMBS LIKE MOSES DID AND
[1:03:19] OFFER SYMBOLOGY. BUT WHEN GOD OFFERED A
[1:03:22] LAMB,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; IT HAD TO BE THAT ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT
[1:03:26] WAS IN HIS MIND BECAUSE MOSES WAS ONLY
[1:03:29] OFFERING A LAMB BECAUSE IT WAS A TYPE.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN GOD MADE AN OFFERING, IT WAS
[1:03:35] THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE. IT WAS THE
[1:03:37] MAN CHRIST JESUS. That's right.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; My when Jesus walked into the water that
[1:03:42] morning, IT WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT
[1:03:45] SAW him coming and said, "Behold the
[1:03:47] lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:03:50] the world." LET ME TELL YOU THIS
[1:03:52] MORNING, OUR LAMB IS GOD'S LAMB. I don't
[1:03:56] have David's lamb. I DON'T HAVE MOSES'S
[1:03:59] LAMB. I DON'T HAVE THAT LAMB THAT YOU
[1:04:01] CAN SACRIFICE AND GO AWAY THE SAME OR A
[1:04:04] SINNER AND REMAIN. BUT I'VE GOT A LAMB
[1:04:07] THAT IF YOU EVER COME TO THIS LAMB, YOU
[1:04:09] ARE SANCTIFIED FOREVER. YOU ARE CLEANSED
[1:04:13] BY THE BLOOD OF GOD'S LAMB. GOD SLAY THE
[1:04:17] LAMB. In Isaiah 53, it said it made his
[1:04:20] soul an offering for sin. Then it wasn't
[1:04:24] the blood of just a man. It wasn't the
[1:04:27] blood of just a Jew. It was the creative
[1:04:30] blood of God which redeems you AND I
[1:04:33] THIS MORNING. NOW, PREACHER, AMEN. AND
[1:04:35] BELIEVER, YOU MIGHT NOT CATCH THE
[1:04:37] REALITY of what that means, but what it
[1:04:39] means IS WHAT PAUL IS SAYING THAT GOD IS
[1:04:43] COMING TO GET HIS PEOPLE, but he
[1:04:45] couldn't do it without a lamb.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO OFFER A LAMB before he could
[1:04:51] get into his people. That's where he
[1:04:53] really wanted to go. So when he brought
[1:04:56] Christ Jesus and he offered him, he was
[1:04:59] offering his own lamb. Do you see Jesus?
[1:05:02] Amen. He wasn't just a normal man.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; You know, when they were talking to
[1:05:10] Jesus in John 6, he said, "I am the
[1:05:12] bread of life."
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; They said, "Our fathers did eat man in
[1:05:17] the wilderness." And he said, "There
[1:05:18] everyone dead."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; But I am the bread of life. You hear
[1:05:23] that? I am.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; When they were talking about the need of
[1:05:28] light, Jesus said, "I I am the light of
[1:05:31] the world." Yes.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Look at what he said. He said, "I am the
[1:05:35] door of the sheepfold."
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I AM the good shepherd."
[1:05:39] There's several of them. "I am the
[1:05:41] resurrection and the life. I am the way,
[1:05:44] the truth, the life. I am the true
[1:05:46] vine."
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY LOOKED UPON HIM AND HE SAID,
[1:05:50] THEY SAID, "WELL, WE BELIEVE MOSES AND
[1:05:52] WE BELIEVE ABRAHAM." AND JESUS LOOKED
[1:05:54] RIGHT AT HIM AND HE SAID, "BEFORE
[1:05:56] ABRAHAM WAS, I am." AMEN.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEM PEOPLE MUST
[1:06:01] HAVE THOUGHT? BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT WAS
[1:06:03] the name of the GOD THAT HAD SENT MOSES
[1:06:06] AND HAD BUILT THE OLD TESTAMENT LAW. HE
[1:06:09] SAID, "I AM THAT I AM." AND JESUS WAS
[1:06:13] THERE TO FULFILL EVERYTHING THAT MOSES
[1:06:17] HAD SPOKE ABOUT HIM. JESUS DIDN'T COME
[1:06:20] TO DO AWAY WITH THE LAW. HE COME TO
[1:06:22] FULFILL THE LAW.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THE LAW WASN'T DONE AWAY WITH.
[1:06:26] THE LAW WAS FULFILLED IN JESUS CHRIST.
[1:06:29] NOW YOU AND I ARE NOT UNDER LAW AND
[1:06:32] PROPHETS. WE ARE UNDER THE GRACE OF
[1:06:35] ALMIGHTY GOD. THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:06:38] CHRIST,
[1:06:39] THE BLOOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CAN GET A
[1:06:41] HOLD OF SOMEBODY THIS MORNING. I'LL tell
[1:06:43] you what he can do. Amen. Amen. He can
[1:06:46] COME RIGHT HERE AND TAKE FULL POSSESSION
[1:06:48] of your body. Do you know that? He has a
[1:06:50] right to make full claims of the body
[1:06:53] that is here. Amen. Now, now you know as
[1:06:56] you're as you're looking into this, of
[1:06:58] course, people say, "Well, Brother
[1:07:00] Wayne, you know, why
[1:07:03] why do y'all talk about an end time
[1:07:05] message? What's the point?"
[1:07:08] You know, that's a good question.
[1:07:10] Honestly, it is.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; It is honestly a good question because
[1:07:14] if the cross and the blood
[1:07:17] did everything,
[1:07:19] [snorts]
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; then why would there be any need for
[1:07:21] anything else?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:07:24] That's a that's a good question, isn't
[1:07:26] it? But do you know after the death,
[1:07:29] burial, and resurrection of our Lord
[1:07:30] Jesus, after the great atonements that
[1:07:33] he made that Apostle Paul come to that
[1:07:36] young church? And he said, "Look, folks,
[1:07:40] grievous wolves are about to enter this
[1:07:41] flock."
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "They're going to take away
[1:07:44] the truth.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Grievous wolves are going to come." And
[1:07:48] Paul began to prophesy. Jude not over 30
[1:07:52] years from the death of our Lord Jesus
[1:07:54] already began to say he was going to
[1:07:55] contend for the faith in the book of
[1:07:57] second Peter almost a exact replica of
[1:08:00] the book of Jude and he starts talking
[1:08:02] about false prophets coming among them
[1:08:04] and they were going to be leading the
[1:08:06] people astray what was they doing they
[1:08:08] was leading them away from the great
[1:08:11] sacrifice that God had made for humanity
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:08:17] one of the greatest scriptures in the
[1:08:19] Bible John chapter 3 can you pull that
[1:08:20] of go to John chapter 3 and and and you
[1:08:23] know the 16th verse. Go to John chapter
[1:08:25] 3. Look at the 16th verse and look at
[1:08:26] what the Bible so beautiful how it
[1:08:28] reads. For God so loved the world he
[1:08:30] gave his only begotten son that
[1:08:32] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:08:34] perish but him that have everlasting
[1:08:36] life. Look at the next verses. He said,
[1:08:38] "For God sent not his son into the world
[1:08:40] to condemn the world, but that the world
[1:08:42] through him might be saved,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; that he that believeth on him is not
[1:08:48] condemned. But he that believeth not is
[1:08:50] condemned
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; already."
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he hath not believed in the
[1:08:57] name of the only begotten son of God.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Now, it isn't it odd that it says in the
[1:09:04] name of the only BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD. It
[1:09:06] doesn't just say in the name of Jesus.
[1:09:07] Isn't that odd to you? Amen. But you you
[1:09:10] you GOT TO REALIZE THE BIBLE tells us
[1:09:12] why. It said you can only worship in the
[1:09:15] gate where HE PUTS HIS NAME.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; NOW PAUL IS TELLING YOU ABOUT
[1:09:18] DISPENSATIONAL TRUTHS. AMEN. And he's
[1:09:21] telling you there's more than ONE GATE.
[1:09:22] AND MAYBE GOD USED a gate one time and
[1:09:24] he used a gate another time. And he used
[1:09:27] the Pentecost and the Lutheran and the
[1:09:28] Baptist and he used all these gates.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; But there's one where he put his name.
[1:09:34] Now, brother Bram tells us this, and
[1:09:36] this is a very very beautiful uh uh uh
[1:09:40] statement from a prophet. He says, "The
[1:09:42] word interpreted
[1:09:45] is a manifestation of the name of God."
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; See, when when you hear the word,
[1:09:53] to believe upon that word is to believe
[1:09:57] upon the name of God.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; See, you can't believe on the name of
[1:10:02] God by believing some denominational
[1:10:04] nonsense that's been taught about him.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Now, watch
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; when you start looking at this that
[1:10:12] there's a reason the scripture says it
[1:10:13] in Isaiah chapter 60. I won't be too
[1:10:15] much longer. In Isaiah the 60th chapter,
[1:10:18] watch in the first verses.
[1:10:20] HE SAYS, "ARISE and shine, for thy light
[1:10:23] is come and the glory of the Lord has
[1:10:26] risen upon you." Do you know the light
[1:10:28] of God is supposed to shine in the end
[1:10:30] time?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Zechariah chapter 14, look at the
[1:10:33] seventh verse in the 16th verse or the
[1:10:35] sixth and seventh verses. Amen.
[1:10:37] Zechariah tells a clear statement. Amen.
[1:10:40] That in the evening time
[1:10:43] there shall be light. In Zechariah, not
[1:10:46] Zephaniah. Sorry, I got ahead of you
[1:10:47] here. I'm doing it for for timing. Amen.
[1:10:50] In Zechariah, he said, "In the evening
[1:10:52] time, there shall be light." Isaiah
[1:10:55] says, "Arise, shine, there's coming
[1:10:57] light."
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah says, "In the evening there
[1:11:01] shall be light."
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; It's amazing to me that the Bible also
[1:11:07] says in Malachi 4 that God would send
[1:11:11] Elijah the prophet before the grateful
[1:11:14] day of the Lord.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Malachi 4 and:5. In Luke 17,
[1:11:18] Jesus prophesies of the same thing and
[1:11:21] says, "So shall it be when the son of
[1:11:24] man IS REVEALED." WHO IS the son of man?
[1:11:27] It's Jesus Christ.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S TO BE REVEALED in the end times.
[1:11:32] SEE, IT'S NOT ANOTHER GOSPEL. THE
[1:11:35] MESSAGE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING IS NOT SOME
[1:11:37] OTHER GOSPEL MADE UP BY SOME OTHER
[1:11:39] PROPHET OR LIKE JOSEPH SMITH OR THE
[1:11:42] SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST. THIS IS THE
[1:11:44] ORIGINAL WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN FROM GOD'S
[1:11:48] OWN LIPS. And in the end time, he
[1:11:50] promised you to return to the original
[1:11:53] word of the living God. Look, it shall
[1:11:55] be light about the evening time. Is that
[1:11:58] right? Evening time.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it's evening time of the
[1:12:02] ages?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; In the evening time, there shall come
[1:12:06] light.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Now listen. What good does light do
[1:12:10] without eyes?
[1:12:14] And do you know the body of Christ is
[1:12:16] like a human body? It's built from the
[1:12:18] feet up.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And do you know in the ages throughout
[1:12:22] the ages that we were in a foot and then
[1:12:24] we were in the legs and we were in the
[1:12:26] hips and the church has grown in
[1:12:28] progression of the human body throughout
[1:12:32] the ages.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; You see Pentecost in that lip tongue.
[1:12:35] You you've seen it.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; But the next part of the BODY WAS THE
[1:12:40] EYES. YEAH.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; And what is the eyes of a of a people?
[1:12:44] It's a prophetic.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE EYES. NOW, WHAT good would
[1:12:49] light come and there not be eyes TO
[1:12:52] CATCH THE LIGHT?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; WHY TURN ON A LIGHT IF THERE WAS NO EYES
[1:12:56] IN THE BODY? BUT A PROPHET IS AN EYE TO
[1:12:59] THE BODY. AND WHEN GOD SENT a light in
[1:13:02] the evening time, he also sent a prophet
[1:13:05] in the evening time that would BE A
[1:13:07] LIGHT TO THE BODY. AND WHEN HE CATCHES
[1:13:10] THAT LIGHT, he begins to shine light
[1:13:13] upon certain parts and upon the word of
[1:13:16] God. Now, if you're if you're if you're
[1:13:18] with me now, I'm not going to be long.
[1:13:20] Look in Matthew chapter 6. And watch
[1:13:22] this in the closing. Now, Jesus himself,
[1:13:25] speaking of light, he says, "The light
[1:13:28] of the body is the eye.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; And if thine eye be single, thine whole
[1:13:35] body shall be full of light.
[1:13:38] But if thine eye be evil, thine whole
[1:13:40] body shall be full of darkness. And if
[1:13:43] therefore the light that is in thee be
[1:13:46] darkness, oh, how great your darkness.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Now, what's Jesus talking about?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; He's talking about your understanding of
[1:13:55] his word.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, if what you're believing
[1:14:00] about his word, let's just say it's new
[1:14:02] light, you got to be careful your new
[1:14:05] light isn't darkening the light that God
[1:14:09] has sent.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I I'll read it to you again.
[1:14:12] Luke chapter uh uh Luke chapter 11
[1:14:16] and uh we'll look in the 32nd verse. Uh
[1:14:18] let's see.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; No, let's go down to
[1:14:22] 34. The light of the body is the eyes.
[1:14:25] Jesus speaking. Therefore, when thine
[1:14:27] eye is single, thine whole body is full
[1:14:30] of light. But when thine eye is evil,
[1:14:34] thy body is full of darkness.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Take heed therefore that the light which
[1:14:41] is in thee be not darkness.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; See now, Amen. If thine eye be dark, now
[1:14:48] watch. If thy if thine eye
[1:14:52] the light which is in thee be not
[1:14:54] darkness. If thine whole body therefore
[1:14:57] be full of light, there shall be having
[1:15:01] no part darkness, the whole shall be
[1:15:02] full of light. Even when the bright
[1:15:04] shining of a candle doeth light. Now
[1:15:06] look what he's telling you. When the
[1:15:08] light comes, if you have an eye to catch
[1:15:11] that light,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; then the whole body
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; will be full of light.
[1:15:18] If the light that you're catching is
[1:15:22] darkness. Now, now this is not an old
[1:15:25] thought.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; This goes back to Genesis the 3 chapter.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; When the serpent come in the garden and
[1:15:31] he started talking to Eve about the
[1:15:33] word, remember?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; He was one to make her wise.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing that someone always
[1:15:41] wants to make you a little wiser?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; They use knowledge. I got some new light
[1:15:48] on a subject.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; But you have to be careful that the
[1:15:52] light you're receiving is not darkness.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; See, BECAUSE EVE DIDN'T BECOME WISER.
[1:15:58] BROTHER BAM SAID, "LOOK, IN THE DAY AND
[1:16:01] SATAN SAYS IN THE DAY THAT YOU EATETH."
[1:16:03] AMEN. AMEN. AND SHE SAID, "GOD SAID I
[1:16:05] DIE THAT YOU MIGHT MAKE ME WISER in the
[1:16:08] worldly terms, but you're GOING TO KILL
[1:16:10] ME SPIRITUALLY."
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:16:13] IF IF YOUR EYE be single, IN OTHER
[1:16:15] WORDS, IF YOU HAVE A PLACE ONLY FOR THE
[1:16:17] WORD OF GOD, THEN YOUR EYE is it's a
[1:16:20] light and it's a light upon you. And you
[1:16:22] say, "Now, Brother Wayne, now what's
[1:16:24] this got all to do with what you're
[1:16:25] preaching about?" Amen. Now, now think
[1:16:27] about this just a moment. You've got to
[1:16:29] have light, folks.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; AND JOHN SAYS IT. If you walk in the
[1:16:34] light,
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; AS HE is in the light, THEN YOU HAVE
[1:16:38] FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM. and his blood
[1:16:40] cleanseth thee from all your sins.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see the Bible tells us
[1:16:45] this? THAT THE SACRIFICE THAT GOD MADE,
[1:16:48] God so loved the world, he gave his only
[1:16:50] begotten son. And sister Mariah,
[1:16:52] everybody is saved by that sacrifice.
[1:16:53] You know that's true. If a baby dies in
[1:16:57] the womb of a mother, that's a saved
[1:16:58] baby. IF A BABY DIES BEFORE IT COMES,
[1:17:01] AMEN, to the age of accountability,
[1:17:02] that's a saved baby. Amen. THE BLOOD OF
[1:17:05] JESUS. AMEN. IT FIXED THE SIN THAT
[1:17:08] CAUSED THE WORLD'S SIN. IT WAS WHAT
[1:17:11] happened in THE GARDEN AND JESUS FIXED
[1:17:13] IT ALL. AMEN. BUT IF YOU COME PAST the
[1:17:15] age of accountability, you got TO ACCEPT
[1:17:17] IT. BUT WITH THAT SACRIFICE, EVERY
[1:17:19] PERSON IN THE WORLD ought to be saved.
[1:17:20] THERE OUGHT NOT BE ONE LOST person in
[1:17:23] this world. WITH THE SACRIFICE OF GOD'S
[1:17:26] OWN SON AND THE COVENANT BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:17:28] CHRIST, THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE PERSON
[1:17:31] IN THIS WORLD THAT is lost. But I can
[1:17:33] use your Bible and prove that there will
[1:17:36] be.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; My Bible says that they have to enlarge
[1:17:39] the borders of hell.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; There shouldn't be anybody lost.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "HOW DID THEY GET LOST?"
[1:17:47] BECAUSE people got new light.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Because they got new light. DO YOU KNOW
[1:17:52] WITH ALL THAT SACRIFICE, BROTHER ASHTON?
[1:17:55] YOU know what's amazing is that if you
[1:17:57] take the light off of it, there's no
[1:17:58] sacrifice at all.
[1:18:01] Can you imagine the great blood of Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ can exist and it not be your
[1:18:07] sacrifice? You said, "How's that
[1:18:08] happen?" Go to Hebrews the 10th chapter
[1:18:10] and watch it. The Bible said, "He that
[1:18:12] sins and willfully disbelieves once he's
[1:18:14] heard the truth." He said, "Now he hath
[1:18:17] no more sacrifice." NOW, WHAT'S THAT
[1:18:20] MEAN? HE'S NOT TALKING TO A BELIEVER.
[1:18:21] NOW, AMEN. You You got to get that out
[1:18:23] of your mind. HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN AGE
[1:18:26] THAT'S LOOKING AT THE SACRIFICE OF JESUS
[1:18:28] CHRIST AND SOME DENOMINATION IS PUTTING
[1:18:31] BLINDERS over their EYES AND THEY'RE
[1:18:33] THROWING THE LIGHT OFF OF THE BLOOD.
[1:18:36] THEY'RE THROWING THE LIGHT OFF OF THE
[1:18:38] POWER OF GOD AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S IN
[1:18:40] THE CHURCH OR it's in the teacher, it's
[1:18:42] in this, IT'S IN THIS, BUT IT'S NOT IN
[1:18:44] THAT SACRIFICE. BUT WHEN A PROPHET of
[1:18:46] God come to THE EARTH, HE TOOK THIS
[1:18:48] CHURCH AND EXALTED THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:18:51] CHRIST. HE SAID, "YOUR CHURCH CAN'T SAVE
[1:18:53] YOU. YOUR PREACHER CAN'T SAVE YOU. THERE
[1:18:55] AIN'T NOBODY CAN SAVE YOU. SHAKING MY
[1:18:58] HAND CAN'T SAVE YOU. COMING TO AN ALTAR
[1:19:00] CAN'T SAVE YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:19:03] ACCEPT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. MY PUT
[1:19:08] A LIGHT BACK ON THE SACRIFICE. IT IS THE
[1:19:11] BLOOD THAT DESTROYS SIN. IT'S THE BLOOD
[1:19:14] THAT SAVES DRUNKERS. IT'S THE BLOOD THAT
[1:19:16] DELIVERS ALCOHOLICS. IT'S THE BLOOD THAT
[1:19:19] BRINGS DRUG ADDICTS AND MAKES PREACHERS
[1:19:21] OUT OF THEM. IT'S THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:19:24] CHRIST. PUT A LIGHT ON THE SACRIFICE. DO
[1:19:27] YOU SEE WHAT the message is doing? It's
[1:19:29] putting a light on the original
[1:19:31] SACRIFICE TO TAKE A man and CLEAN HIM UP
[1:19:34] SO MUCH THAT HE COULD MANIFEST JESUS
[1:19:37] CHRIST THE SAME AS JESUS DID WHEN HE WAS
[1:19:40] UPON THE EARTH. Let me tell you this. I
[1:19:42] KNOW THAT GOD CAME AND CLAIMED THE BODY
[1:19:45] OF Jesus as a lamb of God. But that same
[1:19:47] God is looking for a bride body THIS
[1:19:49] MORNING. THE SAME GOD that said, "Behold
[1:19:52] the lamb OF GOD AND TOOK THAT LAMB TO A
[1:19:55] SACRIFICE IS THE SAME GOD THAT
[1:19:58] PROPHESIED IN HEBREWS 1 THAT HE WOULD
[1:20:00] POSSESS a body." WHOSE BODY? YOUR BODY.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; NOW, you got to think about that just a
[1:20:07] moment because ever since you've been a
[1:20:09] little boy, the devil's been telling you
[1:20:11] that you don't belong to him and you're
[1:20:13] for somebody and there's this spirit
[1:20:14] here. And Amen. I know how it is. Chase
[1:20:17] these little girls around and say YOU'RE
[1:20:19] NERVOUS NOW AND AND I YOU'RE ALWAYS
[1:20:21] GOING to be nervous and you're always
[1:20:22] going to be LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE ALWAYS
[1:20:23] GOING TO BE WHAT A LIE. [screaming]
[1:20:26] PUT ANOTHER LIGHT ON IT. JESUS BLOOD WAS
[1:20:29] SACRIFICED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A CLAIM TO
[1:20:32] YOU THIS MORNING. LISTEN, THE DEVIL
[1:20:34] DON'T HAVE A CLAIM. THE DEVIL'S A LIAR.
[1:20:36] HE'S GIVEN YOU A NEW LIGHT. ONE THAT
[1:20:39] DESTROYS THE BLOOD OF THE SACRIFICE OF
[1:20:42] JESUS CHRIST. BUT THIS MESSAGE HAS come
[1:20:45] to claim believers for the word of God.
[1:20:48] LISTEN, I KNOW THAT THIS LED TOAN'S
[1:20:51] TRYING TO CLAIM OUR YOUNG BELIEVERS.
[1:20:53] THEY'RE TRYING TO CLAIM them for their
[1:20:54] clothing. Make a MAKE MOVIE STARS OUT OF
[1:20:57] THEM. MAKE MAKE A A BALL CHAMPIONS OUT
[1:20:59] OF THEM. Make game champions OUT OF
[1:21:01] THEM. I TELL YOU THIS MORNING AS A
[1:21:03] PASTOR OVER THIS CONGREGATION, I CLAIM
[1:21:05] YOU. AND I CLAIM YOU FOR THE MESSAGE OF
[1:21:08] THE HOUR. I CLAIM YOU FOR THE TEACHINGS
[1:21:11] OF THE BIBLE IN THE LAST DAYS. NOT JUST
[1:21:14] ANOTHER CHURCH, BUT A BRIDE BODY JESUS
[1:21:18] HIMSELF can step into.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; He's come to claim you.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And if you put enough light on the
[1:21:27] sacrifice,
[1:21:29] if you let this message be preached
[1:21:31] without darkening it with man's ideas,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; there's not one person in this building
[1:21:36] can't be saved.
[1:21:38] That's right.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you was born.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you was illegitimate or
[1:21:43] born TO A DRUNKARD'S FAMILY. IF YOU PUT
[1:21:45] THE RIGHT light on this sacrifice, IT
[1:21:48] COULD TAKE THAT ILLEGITIMATE BIRTH AND
[1:21:50] MAKE YOU A LEGITIMATE SON OF GOD. PUT
[1:21:52] THE RIGHT LIGHT ON IT. BROTHER, YOU
[1:21:54] DON'T HAVE TO BE BORN TO THE BRANDON
[1:21:56] FAMILY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BORN IN THE
[1:21:57] LAWSON FAMILY OR THE ERICSON FAMILY. IT
[1:22:00] DON'T MATTER WHAT FAMILY YOU'VE BEEN
[1:22:02] BORN INTO. AS LONG AS YOU'RE BIRTHED
[1:22:04] UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, PUT THE
[1:22:07] RIGHT LIGHT ON IT.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; There's not a person in this room can't
[1:22:11] be saved right now with the right light.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You You light up this sacrifice and
[1:22:16] it'll clean the hands of the dirtiest
[1:22:18] hearts. It'll clean any heart. IT'LL
[1:22:20] SANCTIFY ANY LIFE. IT'LL SAVE THE ONE. I
[1:22:23] DON'T CARE HOW LOST. I DON'T CARE HOW
[1:22:25] TROUBLED. WELL, I TELL YOU, BROTHER
[1:22:26] WAYNE, you don't know. I was born in the
[1:22:28] home of an alcoholic. That's all right.
[1:22:30] William Brandon was carrying water to a
[1:22:33] moonshine steel WHEN THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:22:35] APPEARED to him. That went your excuse,
[1:22:37] didn't it? You ain't got any EXCUSES
[1:22:39] LEFT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW DOWN YOUR
[1:22:41] WATER POT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW DOWN
[1:22:43] YOUR YOUR IDEAS AND YOUR TRADITIONS AND
[1:22:46] YOU MIGHT COME TO JESUS AND SAY, "LORD,
[1:22:48] USE ME FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO USE ME
[1:22:51] FOR."
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. Yeah, I I can't be
[1:22:56] used because I was born in a drunkard's
[1:22:58] home. Amen. But Taz, stand up right
[1:22:59] there. As you witness, YOU AIN'T GOT any
[1:23:02] more excuses. I don't care what kind of
[1:23:04] home you come OUT OF. YOU CAN BE a man
[1:23:06] of God. YOU CAN BE A LEADER. YOU CAN
[1:23:08] RAISE CHILDREN THAT BELIEVE THIS
[1:23:10] MESSAGE. YOU CAN BE SOLID. YOU CAN BE AN
[1:23:13] ELDER. YOU CAN BE A PART OF A BODY.
[1:23:15] [applause] THERE'S NO MORE EXCUSES LEFT.
[1:23:17] COME ON, CHURCH. MAYBE SOME OF YOU WERE
[1:23:19] BORN INTO BAD HOMES AND YOU SAID, "WELL,
[1:23:21] BROTHER, I COULD NEVER DO IT." I TELL
[1:23:23] YOU, THAT'S THE BIGGEST LIE THAT'S EVER
[1:23:24] BEEN TOLD.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. It don't
[1:23:27] matter what your birth is or what your
[1:23:29] raising was. Oh, I tell you they I tell
[1:23:31] you they got a lot of trouble cuz the
[1:23:32] way they was raised and they can't never
[1:23:34] and humanly I believe you're you GOT A
[1:23:36] GOOD POINT. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A NEW
[1:23:38] birth now. AND IF YOU SHINE THE RIGHT
[1:23:40] LIGHT on that new birth, A PERSON CAN
[1:23:42] START SURRENDERING TO THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:23:45] CHRIST AND THEIR HERITAGE CHANGES AND
[1:23:47] THEIR NATURE CHANGES AND THEIR ATTITUDE
[1:23:50] CHANGES. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BLOOD.
[1:23:54] THE BLOOD OF JESUS. THE BLOOD THAT
[1:23:56] SAVES, THE BLOOD THAT SANCTIFIES, THE
[1:23:59] BLOOD THAT SPEAKS.
[1:24:01] DON'T TALK TO me about LAW AND PROPHETS.
[1:24:03] I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE GRACE OF
[1:24:06] GOD THAT HAS COVERED THIS GENERATION.
[1:24:08] I'M TALKING ABOUT the one THAT SAVED ME
[1:24:10] AND SANCTIFIED ME, FILLED ME WITH THE
[1:24:13] HOLY GHOST AND PUT ME IN A PULL PIT TO
[1:24:15] TELL THE WORLD HE IS A GOD THAT CAN SAVE
[1:24:18] YOU, SANCTIFY YOU, FEEL YOU. HE'S NOT
[1:24:21] DEAD, YOUNG PEOPLE. HE IS ALIVE AND HE'S
[1:24:25] RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING THIS MORNING
[1:24:27] WITH POWER.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Put some LIGHT ON IT.
[1:24:33] PUT SOME LIGHT ON IT. HE'S THE HOLY
[1:24:36] GHOST. HE STILL SPEAKS WITH TONGUES. HE
[1:24:39] STILL SEE VISIONS. HE STILL RAISES THE
[1:24:41] DEAD. THERE'S GIFTS OF KNOWLEDGE AND
[1:24:43] WISDOM AND PROPHECY. HE STILL CAUSES THE
[1:24:46] LAME TO WALK AND THE BLIND TO SEE. AND
[1:24:49] HE USES YOUR HANDS TO DO IT.
[1:24:56] I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BLOOD.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Put some light on it.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Don't let some devil tell you God don't
[1:25:05] do that no more.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; He absolutely does it.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, you you're just too far
[1:25:14] shot, man. God can't do nothing to you.
[1:25:16] What a lie from hell.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. trying to darken the light
[1:25:21] on the sacrifice of God.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Whether it's coming,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; y'all know I'm in the Bible.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And Paul said they would transform
[1:25:30] themselves into angels of light.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; But you better be careful. Your light's
[1:25:35] not darkness.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That's far enough there.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; But you see what happens? People begin
[1:25:44] to darken
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; and they take away the sacrifice.
[1:25:49] That's what they done throughout the
[1:25:50] ages.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; That's why the message of William
[1:25:54] Brandham is not about
[1:25:57] William Brandom.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; But just because you say I'm a man
[1:26:03] follower, you will not take my liberty
[1:26:05] to believe what God done in this
[1:26:07] generation.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I refuse.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I refuse to let people take my liberty
[1:26:13] to quote a prophet, to believe a
[1:26:15] prophet, to follow a prophet. the one
[1:26:17] God sent to me.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, this this world's strong with their
[1:26:26] unbelief, folks.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; They get right up in your face with
[1:26:28] their unbelief.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; But for some reason, when the light of
[1:26:31] God shines,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; but it shined in my path. It saved me.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And let me promise you, if he saved me,
[1:26:39] but he saved you.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:42] There ain't a person in this building
[1:26:43] this morning he can't take and use your
[1:26:46] life the way he ordained it to mean
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; but you're going to have to let some
[1:26:49] light on the sacrifice
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; you're going to have to let us put some
[1:26:56] light on the sacrifice
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; and when you do it'll start getting
[1:27:01] empowered
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; it'll power it'll it'll come in
[1:27:04] manifestation in your life it begins to
[1:27:07] take over somebody sitting here this
[1:27:09] morning you need the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:10] you're saying, "Brother, I've got this
[1:27:12] issue and I got this issue." See, you're
[1:27:13] focused in the wrong place now.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; That's Satan darkening.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He's darkening the light on the
[1:27:19] sacrifice. Listen, no matter how you're
[1:27:21] born, no matter where you're born, no
[1:27:22] matter what your attitude was. Do you
[1:27:24] know we brother said this clearly? He
[1:27:27] said he would ignore your doctrine to
[1:27:29] give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:35] because really intellectually, I don't
[1:27:37] care what your doctrine was. It ain't
[1:27:39] right till you get the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; You didn't have him this morning. You
[1:27:45] didn't have the Holy Spirit this Maybe
[1:27:46] you're sitting here this morning
[1:27:47] wondering. Let me tell you, let me tell
[1:27:49] you this. The Holy Ghost is real.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And I know some of you may be wondered
[1:27:59] for the Holy Ghost, didn't they? Yes.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Do y'all know why they did that?
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; It was 10 days from the resurrection of
[1:28:06] Christ, the 40 days
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; until the 50th, which was Pentecost.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; And God was waiting on the 50th day,
[1:28:14] which met the festival laws that he had
[1:28:17] set up.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God came on that 50th
[1:28:21] day. They didn't tar 10 days to pray for
[1:28:24] the Holy Ghost. Right.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; They used those 10 days to get
[1:28:28] themselves out of the way. But the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost fell on the 50th day, which tells
[1:28:32] us this. You don't have to come up here
[1:28:33] and tar at the altar.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost came 2,000 years ago.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But look, look, if you you said,
[1:28:44] "Brother Wayne, I need prayer." Listen,
[1:28:46] if you need prayer one time or you need
[1:28:47] prayer hund times,
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; don't quit
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; till you get the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:54] That's right.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Don't quit. [applause]
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Just keep coming. And when you RECEIVE
[1:29:03] THE HOLY GHOST, you'll know you did. And
[1:29:06] then you it'll be satisfied in you.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; But but watch now. Don't give up on it
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; because it's real.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many here got the Holy
[1:29:19] Ghost? If you got the Holy Ghost, just
[1:29:20] stand on your feet right now. If you got
[1:29:21] the Holy Ghost, I want you to stand on
[1:29:23] your feet. And if you're looking for the
[1:29:25] Holy Ghost, I want you to look around
[1:29:26] the building just a moment.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; It's just real, isn't it?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; If you want to if you want to receive
[1:29:31] it, go on and stand up with them and
[1:29:33] become a part of it
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; and look around and say, "Well, I'll
[1:29:36] tell you this. This is a real thing.
[1:29:38] This is real people. This is a real life
[1:29:40] experience
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; and I could have it." If our musicians
[1:29:44] would come this morning,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I certainly believe today.
[1:29:48] I believe Hebrews chapter 1:es 1 and two
[1:29:51] is not discussing the end of God
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; or the end of the work of God.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; It is discussing a further manifestation
[1:30:00] of the same God.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; It just changed dispensations.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And oh, how we if we could see it for
[1:30:08] them,
[1:30:10] how we are to see it this morning.
[1:30:13] Dispensational changes.
[1:30:16] God has moved in this in this age in
[1:30:20] such a way. It's not a different God.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; It's the same Jesus.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He's just the same right now
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; as he ever was.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts right now.
[1:30:36] Father God,
[1:30:38] Lord, I've spoke my heart to these
[1:30:40] believers. They they've endured
[1:30:43] many scriptures.
[1:30:46] Lord, I I have put so much word out this
[1:30:48] morning. Maybe even just the mind can't
[1:30:51] even conceive the scriptures that's been
[1:30:53] given.
[1:30:55] But Father,
[1:30:57] I know when I give your word, I know
[1:31:00] it's true.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And as we have spoke the truth over this
[1:31:04] congregation, Lord, I pray that the God
[1:31:07] of this Bible
[1:31:09] that you would move upon the heart of
[1:31:11] your children, Lord, in today. May you
[1:31:13] destroy every dark place,
[1:31:17] anything that would cause darkness on
[1:31:19] this sacrifice, any word spoken by any
[1:31:21] man, any ideas, any teachings,
[1:31:26] anyone that would hold up and say that
[1:31:28] it ain't the same, that Jesus ain't the
[1:31:31] same, his healing ain't the same, his
[1:31:33] mercy ain't. I pray this morning, Lord,
[1:31:36] that your light would shine in on that
[1:31:38] sacrifice and that every heart this
[1:31:40] morning would know that that sacrifice
[1:31:43] lays open for them today. If they have a
[1:31:45] need, Father, I pray they could receive
[1:31:47] it right now. I pray, Lord, that through
[1:31:50] the gift of your spirit, may as you move
[1:31:52] among your congregation, Lord, let us
[1:31:54] release things that are trying to make
[1:31:56] claim to our life. Let us release the
[1:31:58] things that are trying to take control.
[1:32:01] And Lord Jesus, we want to give it to
[1:32:03] you.
[1:32:05] In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; He's my master,
[1:32:16] Savior. [music]
[1:32:18] Yes, he is.
[1:32:20] Jesus
[1:32:26] like a fragrance [singing]
