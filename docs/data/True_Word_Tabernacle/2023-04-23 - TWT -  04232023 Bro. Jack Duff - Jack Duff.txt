morning we want to let you know about by the Larry Carmack says a few weeks ago I noticed a spot on my leg that I thought should be checked out I went to the dermatologist and she said it was nothing to worry about but found a couple other spots they look suspicious she did a biopsy they called a few days later and said they were both the beginning stages of cancer one on my arm of basal cell and one on my neck a melanoma Miracle number one they sent me to a plastic surgeon he said it was a very good catch to find these spots when setting the date for the procedure to remove the one on my neck I asked if there was any way I could have done could have it done before April 29th because I retire on that date and would have a small lapse in insurance coverage they could not get me in until the middle of may we called about Cobra insurance and another short-term policy both were very expensive and it would cost more than the procedure we called the plastic surgeon office back to see if we could back it up a few weeks until I would have insurance they said it is a melanoma and an aggressive cancer and want to do it as soon as possible so we thought we would just have to pay for it in the meantime we got a call from the dermatologist and wanted me to come in that day to take care of the spot on my arm about an hour and a half hours later the plastic surgeon called and said if you go today to have your arm done we can get you in next week to do the area on your neck one appointment is at 7 A.M before the office opens and the second one is on the 28th the day before I retire and I still have insurance Miracle number two Miracle number three I am training someone to do my job and they have had a lot of trouble hiring people I am on a five pound weight restriction and since I am training he is able to do the physical lifting and I don't have to take any time off also on the way home after the surgery on my arm I said to the Lord I haven't seen your dust for a long time

morning sir good to be in the house of the Lord amen welcome all the visitors this morning say God bless you amen we have a very special dedication this morning brother Seth and sister Rebecca amen I don't know if they're in the building yet she's coming but we want to just take a few minutes this morning and listen we know the prophet taught us that we don't believe in baby baptisms we don't we don't believe that a child has made its decision to serve Christ but the Bible says that the blood of Jesus was shed for the world for the sins of the world and the prophet said that a baby if it would pass he said it would be going straight to heaven because of its innocence and and we thank the Lord for that so he said in the scripture instead of baptizing that Jesus had suffered the little children to be brought unto me and he said he took him in his arms and blessed them and dedicated them back to the Lord and we're so honored this morning to get to be a part of this one amen and I was just thinking this morning on the way to church Chris and I were talking that brother Sean Martin and I have been friends since well Bethany was born the same month that I met your dad and she's 20 years old in January and so we've been knowing what Seth since he was four years old or so not much bigger than Titus in his hands and and we've known him all these years and no need to be a man of God and serve the Lord dedicate his life to this message he's one of the musicians here at the church and we're so thankful how many appreciate you've been seeth in this ministry amen we want to thank you for being a part of he puts his shoulder behind the wheel and anything whether being asked his needs he's been there he actually recently if you want to pray for him he just started a Ministry where he's going into the retirement centers in the nursing homes and he sets up of about an hour and plays to the people that can't go out he goes and plays and spends about an hour I went with him a couple of times the anointing just comes in the room he did something to see people with their hands lifted or worshiping they're bound to that Center so he just takes the anointing to them and then if you want to know how to pray for him pray God will just give you extra blessing there and I know that Rebecca stood greatly beside of him and and I was just thinking on the way about Rebecca and the first time that I seen her and her family I remember I come through here preaching on Thursday night I still remember the sermon I was preaching on zaru and her and her family showed up and you you hadn't been it's probably maybe it was six or four or something in that area and said just just a young baby so I've known these two forever and then helped perform the wedding and now we've got two babies we have Heaven Louise this morning who's named after Rebecca Shawn's first wife that passed which is Seth's mother and they've named her after her and then of course Rebecca's in heaven so Heaven Louise is a great representation of a real Godly mother amen so this is a real a real blessed child to carry this kind of name and we're so thankful to have him this morning sister Susie would you like come stand with us this morning and we appreciate this Mass family don't we God bless you rehearsal if there's a real Christian in the world I've seen their standings and very tough times and hold together and hold a family together very strong woman and she's done she's done a great service to the name of this message in this church we're very proud that you're hardness I think it's a great honor to get to hold this baby today and to dedicate her unto the Lord and amen heaven fatherly by our hearts this morning we thank you for the anointing here around this sanctuary as we hold this child Lord we're reminded of your words to bring them bless them Lord as we Bless the Child this morning we ask you that your great anointing would rest on Lord as we knew Rebecca her great faith I pray Lord that you would anoint little heaven with him God may she have great faith as we dedicate her to you that your angels Lord will just begin to move in around and protect you Lord bless us bless this home now we ask you for your mercies today in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen is amen amen she's going to have good lungs to praise the Lord amen we believe in shouting at church and

a while and um I am recently we had brother Nathan our way and he was such a blessing to us there in Florida and um you're just many of the ministers here have always just been a blessing to us there and in Florida brother Wang came years ago years ago and I remember him coming on a uh Friday night I believe it was and um his first time preaching for us and he preached his song preached a sermon uh bless the Lord you know no matter what you're going through just bless the Lord and he didn't realize that day he preached a sermon a brother that just lost his job and they come to church that night and here's the sermon bless the Lord you know it's just something about how Believers have a different Outlook you know when we have trials and tribulations and distresses amen we have a different outlook on things and we learn how to praise God no matter what we're going through amen because he's worthy of the praise [Music] the reason we can bless the Lord it's because we have a confidence in the god that we serve the Bible declares to us that all things work together for good because we're called according to his purpose Hallelujah this little song Amen is just a song of Declaration that I like to sing amen says I believe that high you'll see the good myself the Lord and I'm confident have seasons change your faithfulness remakes [Music] come on Hallelujah I said I

[Music] I'm confident [Music] oh your faithfulness your faithfulness your faithfulness remains yeah I know it does I know it does you're faithfulness remember [Music] [Applause] thank you foreign [Music] before I do that no true word is um this is a year of transition and um and I just wanted to just take a moment and um I want to salute Brother Ray Harris [Applause] [Music] you you all may not know when you may not realize [Music] it means a lot as a as a younger minister when I can see a seasoned minister set examples that the rest of us should follow uh in my years a man and just being in the message I've Just Seen A lot where uh churches are left in complete disarray there is no plan at all in place and you know it's just it to me it's it's shameful that we end up like that but uh it takes a a real man of God to have foresight to look down in the future and and and and and try to put the church in a position where it can be successful and um there's a tremendous sacrifice that a man of God makes you know he it not only not only has these pastors but you know even in his latter years he still makes a sacrifice and uh you know and for me it just it just it speaks volumes it speaks volumes uh I I I've you know just seen churches where um they don't think about secession they don't talk about it they don't plan for it they don't do anything but when I see a church doing it right I have to come and say God bless you God bless you I'm gonna I'm gonna try to move on but I worked in an environment uh at a at a mega church and um at this mega church they had a transition that they they did they went from the the father who was the founding pastor and the son became the next pastor and uh and when they did it they studied other churches and one of the ones that he studied was uh Andy Stanley and and his son I mean Charles Stanley and his son Andy Stanley and they watched how transition happened it just was a flop you know and they watched other Ministries and how they did it and they realized what we shouldn't do and um you know and and they decided to do something different and it just worked it worked very well and uh and what I've seen here many of the mega churches use that model as their model but what I've seen happen here at True Word I believe it should be a model that should be taken throughout my message and people should follow what has happened here and when you have a man like Brother Ray in our midst we ought to be pulling from him to get everything we can uh because this this is this is done right this is done right and I say God bless you the true word amen we appreciate it from a distance you just don't know what it speaks to us amen God richly bless you thank you see here I am to worship here I am to bow down here I am say you're my God you're all together lovely all together Worthy all together one before [Music] know how much it costs to see my sins come on say I'll never know just how much all to

my daughter Sarah just to sing it the blessing amen for you all but we'll do that at the end if we can Let's uh let's let's get our Bibles and we'll we'll read a scripture um thank you musicians praise the Lord amen we'll um Rita uh just one scripture just to kind of and get us going here amen um I'm coming from south Florida and we bring greetings from Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and um you know it seems like as soon as we got here the weather changed it's got to be the devil got to be today but uh we're happy to be here Amen in the area and just what a what a blessing it has been thus far and and um just you know trying to find the mind of the Lord for this morning a minister it's not that you lack sermons uh there are a number of sermons but you try to find Lord what do you want said for now all right and um and we trust that the Lord has given us something for this moment uh one of the things that I'm I'm very mindful of Amen when we when we're looking at scripture brother Branham is is trying to actually Elevate our thinking to get us to see who we are and it makes a statement and one of his sermons it says when the bride recognizes who she is then the Rapture will go and uh so oftentimes the Lord will give us sermons that will help try to put the bride in position to recognize who she is and uh and and I'll be honest with you uh when we start even thinking like that it challenges everything challenges our thought process telling everything we've heard like what is this but it's the Lord Jesus trying to get us to see something and I help you I pray that he'll he'll help us see ourselves amen this morning I want to make a very familiar scripture out of Luke chapter 2. verse 8 through 11. and um it's very familiar uh the Bible says in Luke chapter 2 verse 8 it says and there were and the same country Shepherds abiding and the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord let's have a word of prayer amen over the scripture father we are grateful for the opportunity to stand behind this sacred deaths we realize um Lord just uh how how important this place is and father we want to just bring something that you've given us to give to your people and that father would be something that helped Elevate us uh in our walk with you Lord I I thank you for uh brother Erickson who's the senior pastor of this great assembly Lord and brother Wayne Lawson Lord it was now the pastor of the symbol we thank you for both of them and their Ministries Lord and just what they've meant to us over the years all the other brothers that have worked alongside them amen we're recently blessed by brother Nathan coming our way and Lord and we just we just appreciate all that has come from this place God as we come just for a little time of Fellowship today we pray that you would take control of this may this be something that will Fellowship around in Heaven someday oh God we'll remember that time we got together on Earth and how our hearts were uplifted by the word of God We Trust Lord that you just get all the glory and all the honor and all the Praises in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated we just take for a topic um the attribute of salvation man the attribute of salvation as I mentioned earlier brother Branham makes a statement to us that when the bride recognizes who she is in the rapture will go and as we kind of comb through this discernment today there is typically what I'd like to do I give you a title and I'll give you a scripture but my thought is actually coming from a whole nother part of the Bible and uh but I know how people are as soon as you read a scripture amen and oh I know which direction he gonna go maybe you don't amen unless you heard the sermon already before but but uh but what I like amen is that they're they're a little nuggets in the scripture that we have the opportunity uh will become a man to service we have a opportunity just to kind of look at some of those nuggets things that will challenge us things that we might have read over or over read right and uh and but then God has a way of just kind of saying hey hey hey wait a minute and now you take a highlighter you put it on that section amen so uh just bear with me this morning as we as we've worked through this but I want to start with a quote out of why we are not a denomination Amen brother Brandon makes this statement which why which was first a savior or a sinner which was first a savior he says uh uh which was first A Healer or a sick person why was that permitted to why why was there permitted to be a sinner because the attributes of him is a savior if there'd never been a sinner he'd never been known as a savior Hallelujah he can make all things wind around to his glory can the power to say or can the pot say to the Potter you made me thus who's on the wheel who's got the claim whose hands is it in Paul said uh oh foolish man then he say uh he said he raised Pharaoh up for this purpose this very purpose certainly he knew it before there was a world he know who would be what and he let there be sin that he might be a savior he let there be sickness that he might be a Healer he let there be hate that he might be loved sure he did he's gone and that's his attributes and he has to have something to display his attributes I like that he says how would you ever know there was a night how would you ever know there's any if it was all it was all daylight uh how would you ever know there was a night there's a night Soul it could it could prove daylight sure sure it is amen you see what he did now and just a little thought from this quote is God allows certain things to happen or he knows these things are going to happen through predestination and for knowledge he knows things are going to happen but when it happens it's an opportunity for an attribute of God to be expressed to a believer blessed be the name of the Lord amen but uh um as we go we're going to look to that amen God has attributes in him but he also placed certain attributes in US and he has to allow certain situations and he has allowed certain circumstances before those attributes are expressed in and through us it's not our attributes it's the attributes of God that are dwelling on the inside of us oh blessed be the name of the Lord you see uh all that God wants the prophet has taught us he poured it into Christ and all that Christ is he is currently pouring that into his church so let me go a little further if a lion gives birth you expect another lion amen if a zebra gives birth then you should expect a baby zebra if an elephant gives birth then you should expect another elephant if a dog gives birth then you should expect a dog not a cat but another dog come on somebody amen if a human gives birth you expect another human but I'm here to ask the question this morning if God gives birth we should expect the Son of God we should expect the thought of God with the attributes that God had in him dwelling inside of him blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet makes a statement here and I see it's going to be very easy amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the prophet makes this thing says God gave Jesus his Spirit without message in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God manifested In the Flesh the Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself but when he gave out his Spirit to we adopted silence he gives us a bucket full out of that ocean he had all the fullness of the godhead we just have a portion of it as a gift of the Holy Spirit but if I took one bucket full of water out of the ocean or even a teaspoonful of it out of the oceans the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean would be in that Spoonful but just less in quantity not less in quality so the same holy spirit that was in Christ is in his church follow me amen just for a little bit we read Luke chapter 2 verse 11 for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior now I want to uh pause just for a little bit amen a savior now uh for for our purposes it's not just a savior this is the savior and the scripture does capitalize it so we understand who they're talking about Hallelujah but we're talking about some of his attributes amen this morning but here the Bible says For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord now I I said amen a savior well the scripture says they say I said the savior because we know who Christ is to us amen but I don't think the scripture was making a man a mistake when it said a savior there actually was a purpose for that and we're gonna just kind of keep reading through scripture this morning to see this let's just work let's take our time when I click on that word savior has a definition amen behind it and I have a little book called the key to the Bible that I looked at and it said a savior means a preserver a Defender uh a deliverer and they said God is preeminently the savior of his people as their creator preserver and deliverer so God preeminently preeminently is the savior amen hallelujah amen because he's the Creator preserve and deliver but but this attribute of save your preserver deliverer amen we're going to find that attribute has been expressed throughout time not just when Christ came to the Earth but this attribute had been expressed all through the Old Testament can I go a little further if it was expressed yesterday our savior is the same yesterday today and forever so if it was expressed yesterday then that same attribute would have to be expressed today oh we're looking for a god with skin on them that day on Calvary brother Brandon makes a statement When sin struck the Earth back in the beginning like a sheet of Blackness falling from the heaven it literally paralyzed the Earth it thrown every creature on the earth and all of God's creation and bondage man was under bondage of death sickness troubled Sorrows all nature fell with fell with it sin was an anesthetic that actually paralyzed the Earth and then we were set here hopeless because every creature on Earth was subject to it and everyone born on Earth was subject to it so it had to come from some place where there was no sin I like that statement it had to come from some place where there was no sin I want to let you know you have come from some place where there was no sin and this morning you're on your way back to that same place where there was no sin Hallelujah that's why even in scripture even if you fell in sin if you bring it underneath the blood there is nothing against you God does not hold it against you he drops it into a sea of forgetfulness and post a sign up say no fishing come on somebody amen we're going back to a place where there is no sin no sickness no disease no war no covet praise God we are on our way back to that place we come from God we're going back to God from a place from some place where there was no sin it could not come from the Earth one of us could not redeem the other amen it had to come from another therefore when man realized that he was separated from his God he become a Wanderer they wept they cried they toiled they wandered about through the mountains and and through the desert seeking a city who's building making was God for he knew that if he ever got back in the presence of God he could talk it over with him but there was no way back Jesus is the way he became he become lost amen he didn't know which way to turn so he just took out wandering trying to find somewhere that he could find a way back to that place something on the inside of him told him that he come from a place that was perfect foreign from this quote as we realize we needed a savior not just a savior but these things because man could not save himself Hallelujah man cannot redeem himself he needed a redeemer so it excites our heart when we read and look to that the Savior was born blessed be the name of the Lord but I want to amen just present to you this morning God began to tell the story of Luke 2. through characters of the scriptures amen God began to tell a story of Salvation and Redemption through various characters that we find in Scripture one of them amen that we can look at is a guy by the name of Joshua his his name actually meant Jehovah savior he was given a name amen that that tithe salvation even in his name certain things that happened in Joshua's life that caused this attribute of Salvation to be expressed stay with me just for a little bit Joshua amen was uh and and my I didn't think about this till right now but you know before Moses left the city he established that Joshua will lead the people can I put it this way they had a succession play but the people wanted to see the same God of Moses dwelling inside of Joshua and they told us if we see God in you we will follow just like we did Moses do God had to do certain things in Joshua's Ministry to elevate him so the people could see that it was nothing but God the time in Joshua's Ministry deal with some of the the people that are in the land and don't do this and don't do that and Joshua got a little excited and they got ahead of the plan of God and uh he let these gibbyanites come amongst them and they tricked them they they brought all this old stuff and old shoes and and and old Tupperware cases and and all kind of stuff like this they're bringing and they say oh we've been on a long journey and before you know it Joshua felt for the story Hallelujah and he made a deal with these people my God had come to find out after he made the deal they were his neighbors they had tricked well the same group of group of people got in trouble one day because somebody else heard about them and there was this these kings that came against them they wanted to fight them and as they come against them we pick it up in Joshua chapter 10 verse 6. they they begin to a man cry for Joshua to come and help them remember his name meant Jehovah savior right here in verse 6 and Joshua 10 it says and the man of gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to give God now let's just pause there just for a second these men were in trouble and these men knew that they could not get help up from One Source and that was that Source was the children of Israel there are people in your life right now they know exactly who to call when trouble strikes they don't even pray themselves but they asked you to pray because they know you can get in contact with God they know you have a special relationship with God they can see his attributes oozing out of you [Music] they know exactly where to go when they're in trouble to the camp to gildall said slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and do what his name meant Jehovah's savior and here right in the scripture he's been asked to express this attribute you know uh I mean let's just keep reading let's just keep I'm telling the story of these savior was told to many characters in the Old Testament and if it was told in their lives that story didn't end then the story is still going on it's going on in you you don't realize it but the story is going on in you it helps us look at our trials a little different it says uh coming to us quickly and save us and help us for all the things of all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains that gather together against us so they called for Joshua to come and save them they needed a deliverer they need it they needed help they needed someone that could that could that could get the job done Hallelujah and Joshua representing Christ stepped in as Savior let's look at this the way of a true prophet of God brother Brandon makes a statement here then I gave the illustration of how that Israel on the march to the promised land they had never seen that land they know nothing about it they just had a promise of God there was a land that was full of milk and honey and God uh and good in a great place they never had it nobody had ever been there and know nothing about it but they had the promise of it and by faith Glory they sojourned through the desert and when they got right to the borderline amen they had a warrior there by the name of Joshua which means Jehovah's savior so he crossed over the over the Jordan into the promised land and brought back the evidence that the land was was there I like that and it was a good Land Two Men packed one bunch of grapes it was a good land so he brought back the evidence that the land that they were going to possess was dead it says now to the church we adjourning to the land of immortality a land where there's no death amen a land where the Dead's raised up and we had a great savior in our camp Jesus means Jehovah savior beloved and he crossed the Jordan of death over into the other land and came back and come back and brought the evidence that we live after death amen so where's death at Joshua perfect height of the Lord Jesus Cross Jordan and Jordan representative death he crossed Jordan and brought back a good report that the land was was flowing with milk and honey man also Jesus went across Jordan when he died in that tomb he went across Jordan and he rose again after the third day and he proved that the land was good on the other side of death Glory the land is good for the believer on the other side of death amen it's an eternal land where we never get sick and won't have to die again amen it truly is a land flowing with milk and honey God began to tell the story of redemption and salvation through these various characters of scripture I told you I was reading a scripture and when I read it I don't know how many times I read my Bible and read over that scripture but it just I overlooked it and then the Holy Spirit kind of pointed something to me here and I want to read it for you and hopefully you'll see what I see Nehemiah chapter 9. we'll start at verse 24. Nehemiah 9 and verse 24. says so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subdue us before them the inhabitants of the land the canines and gave us them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they would and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed Houses full of good full of all Goods whales dig Vineyards and Olive yards and fruit trees in abundance so they did even and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocation this is the verse that got me therefore thou deliverest into the hand of their enemies who fetched them and uh and in the time of their trouble when they Cried unto thee thou hearkenness I mean thou heard a stem from heaven and according to thy manifold Mercies thou gave us them thou gavest them saviors who saved them out of the hand of the Indians so if I could just put it this way the savior gave saviors is that what we read in scriptures thou gave us some savior so the Savior gave savings then the question becomes who are these who are these saviors because it's pluralized who are these saviors that the Savior came the attribute of Salvation that's flowing through somebody [Applause] when they found themselves in trouble this attribute would be expressed when we just you know look at this I went to the Greek Lexicon and amen and I just kind of looked at that word savior it says uh to say and to be delivered to be liberated Amen to uh to be saved in battle to be victorious right to be saved from moral troubles then your pastor comes to the pulpit or another Minister comes with the word of God maybe your mom or your dad is bringing some corrections glory to God they don't you don't realize it but an attribute has been expressed through them to save you from trouble and you think they're just picking on you no they're saving you from trouble they're saving you from heartache they're saving you from pain this attribute is being expressed through somebody we can look at various scriptures and let's just bear with me we're still working taking our time to get there all right amen but uh you know when I read that script and say wait a minute you gave them saviors because my thought is that the Savior that I meet let me just inject a personal testimony this is a little personal testimony before I even knew it's roughly four or five years old somewhere in that range I don't even remember the age that I was but um I was my mom had took me over to my aunt's house and my cousins were responsible for watching me they were older than I am a few years older than I am uh three of my girl cousins and they had to watch me this day and they decided they wanted to go to the pool and uh none of my cousins could swim I couldn't swim but I could play in the pool and as I went there to the pool uh I didn't get in and my cousins they stayed in the shallow end of the water and uh and what they did what they told me that says uh you know you're just gonna be careful you stay there on the shower and so I would take a rock and I would throw it down in the pool and I'd scoop it out and I threw another rock in tonight scoop it out and you know and eventually it got boring because this is a shallow end I want to go to the deep end I want to throw it in a little deeper and I would I would just Edge my way down to the and my cousin like be careful be careful I'm like well I am and I'll throw a rock in and scoop it out I throw it in and scoop it out and I finally got to the six feet where it's been really deep and I said I threw that rock in and I went to scooping out and the only thing I remember from that moment is waking up in the lap of a fireman and uh they told me what had happened because I had no clue what my my cousins they they saw me uh fall in they can't swim they see me there at the bottom of the pool and they said it just so happened that the Lifeguard oh my was skating by at the time and as she was skating by she realized what had happened and she wasn't even on duty but she threw off one skate but couldn't get the other skate off and she jumped in the water a man with one skate on and she got me out of the water my cousins were calling 9-1-1 and then they had the police coming in the fire department everybody was there when I looked at me the whole neighborhood was out there but that that young lady jumped in the pool and she got me out and and somehow they they got the water out of my lungs and and I'm here today I don't know how all I can say is the grace of God that that got me here but can I put it in these turns before I knew these pages God had to send me a savior [Applause] I don't even know her name I don't know I wouldn't know what she looked like but that day that lady was a savior to me she was a deliverer to me she don't even know whose life she saved Minister might have had experiences like this and we don't realize it was the attribute of God being expressed in this situation oh but you see you understand I thank the Lord for for her I appreciate what she did but I didn't know Jesus at the time and I like to say it like this why would I need Jesus why was she not good enough why was she not good enough you see I read it earlier man cannot redeem man cannot save man from sin so I needed Jesus because I was sinking deep in sin I was far from the peaceful Joy very deeply staying with him I was seeking to rise no more the master [Applause] but the master of the sea heard my despairing cry and from the waters blessed be the name of the Lord from the Waters of sin he Lifted Me now say to my mind [Applause] in the Lexicon when I clicked on that word he gave them saviors the Lexicon took me to a number of scriptures and I'll just share a couple of them with you but one of them was in Exodus 2. in verse 12. it says and the Shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up and helped them and water their flocks so when Moses was helping the daughters of Jethro they needed help they needed somebody they were in trouble amen the other shepherds are just taken advantage of them they needed someone to step up and do something when the Bible says that Moses helped them Moses actually became a savior God himself expressed this amen out to the children of Israel in Exodus 14 30. it was an expression you see a savior and let me just put it this way a savior is willing to risk their life a savior is willing to risk their own a savior is willing to amen give everything they got that young lady jumped in the water with a skate on she was willing to risk it off for me not knowing what she was doing oh my God maybe someday I'll meet her I don't know but it's I if I don't okay it's fine I'll shake her hand and say thank you but then I like to introduce her to me the savior I could show her our actions we're typifying Christ typing Christ but we need Jesus and the Israel he was a savior to Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore this is all when when they walk through the Red Sea and and God made a way for the children of Israel but he didn't make a way for pharaoh and his army he made a way for them to be defeated when he opened the waters and then closed him God saved Israel he became their savior their back was against the wall they needed help from somewhere let's go a little further this is another one I'll just read it really quick second Kings 13. verse one through five Second Kings 13. and the three and twentieth year of joash the southern Azariah king of Judah Jehoshaphat the son of jehu began to Reign Over Israel and Samaria and Reign 17 years and he did that which was even the sight of the Lord and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of Nevada which made Israel a sin he departed not there from and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he delivered them into the hand of haziel king of Syria and into the hand of benedett the son of haziel all their days and jehoiah has uh Basalt the Lord and the Lord hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of Israel because the kingdom of Syria the king of Syria oppressed them look at this and the Lord gave Israel a savior so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents Before Time God raised a deliverer up in Israel to deliver them God raised a savior it's right there in the scripture brother Branham makes this point to us in the faith of Abraham look at this look at what he says when you're saved God gives you a checkbook at the bottom of it it's got Jesus's name signed on every check any Redemptive blessing belongs to you are you afraid to fill it out and Abraham's children are you afraid he won't recognize the name of Jesus whatever you ask the father in my name that I will do that's the promise you're Abraham's children you're not afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize the name of Jesus on any Redemptive blessing that the body's sitting at the right hand of God making intercession for that's what he died for now Abraham sure he was heir then after a while lot got in trouble now we'll close in a minute lot got in trouble and you always get in trouble when you backslide wish we had time to dwell on that but he got in trouble what happened the enemy come and picked him off now Abraham played the part of the savior again brother Brahm of you Abraham played the part of Savior when life got himself in trouble when the when the armies came and and took over of the land that he was dwelling in and Abraham couldn't find anything but a few servants and some some tools in the bomb and he went down and got like rescued Abraham became Lots Abraham was a lot safer if he was looking for a Godless skin on him he needed to look no further than Abraham and if we're Abraham's seeking and we know we are Abraham's seat this if the attribute was expressed in Abraham that same attribute is now being expressed in and through us God needs somebody where God needs some hands that he can use and a mouth that he can use and some feet that he can use song say if you can use anything Lord you can use you can use me let's finish reading this quote Abraham played the part of the Savior again he garrisoned himself and went after the enemy that took away his poor vaccine corrupted brother that's what Jesus did sickness bound you sin bound you poor back to living corrupted and Jesus came in and went after you and he brought lot back Abraham did right I just wanna Coast just a little bit here a lot was overtaken and captured if in the city that he was dwelling if he or the inhabitants of that City would have been strong enough to defeat the opposing armies then they would have not they would have needed anyone greater than who they were to bring Deliverance but we got to recognize that we need someone greater than us in order to bring Deliverance there's got to be somebody living a little higher than us hey got a stronger hold on God than us this is why your family your friends call upon you when they get in trouble they know they can't get there themselves they need someone stronger Deliverance is is in this person here salvation is in this person if they would get in contact with God on my behalf I think my situation would change it's the attribute of Salvation being expressed in and through us we can look back in scripture there's so many and we just went through the Book of Judges we would see where the Bible said he gave them saviors all through the Book of Judges all through the Book of Judges we can look at amen e Hut oh what a I love this one right here shamgar that attribute was being expressed in shamgar he got to a point where he was sick and tired of being sick and tired every year I get my crop up to a certain spot and I'm looking God has blessed me with rain and God has done this and I'm ready to reap the Harvest and these Philistines that show up and take everything for every year I'm tired of hiding this and I'm tired of hiding that this is my land I don't have to apologize to no Philistine but dwelling in my land and he finally got himself to his body saying this is the year die or not I will not let another Philistine take my Lane he had no sword he had no tanning he had no gun but he had an ox goal he went out there with a lot to go and beaten down 600 Philistines and also kept his Harvest [Applause] God was a safe to his family the attitude was being expressed through him shamgar bar Barack Gideon Jeff the Sampson all of these in the Book of Judges we can see clearly when the Bible says he gave them saviors just take it back to judges all of them but I showed you how the prophet told us that it was also found in Abraham there are other characters that we can find let's look at David David got to a situation where he was running from Saul and while on the Run he was so afraid David finds himself actually fighting and he's registered in the army of the Philistines just think about this this man this that's supposed to be going against the Philistines is registered in the army of the Philistines and he's a soldier reporting for Duty they're getting ready to go to battle and he doesn't know who they're going to fight he just don't I need to report for Duty and when he gets there the uh the leaders of the Philistine said no we can't let this guy come with us say why well you know look he may we're going to go against the Israelites so if he gets there his heart may turn towards him like Israelites did he'll be coming against us send them back home David goes back home and as he's on his way back home uh he realizes once he gets there that his wife is gone children are gone animals are gone everything is gone and all of his arm is so disappointed and upset with David they said we're going to kill you right now what did you lead us to we're gonna kill you right now and the Bible tells us that David had to do something that most of us are afraid to do David had to encourage himself in the Lord I want to tell you something thanks and you're not going to have somebody to Pat you on the back every time but you got to learn how to encourage yourself in God at the David and courage himself somehow got that man together and said let's go and get our families and as they were on the way they found this one little soldier that had been left behind to die and they nourished that Soldier back to hell he was a savior to the soldiers but they nursed him back to health and when they nurse him back to health that man began to spill all the secrets and it says I know exactly where the Army is let's go down there and get your get your family he said I know exactly where they are and when David got there he routed the Army and saved everybody that was in his family the Bible says he recovered all David became a savior the attribute of Salvation was being expressed but notice God needed a situation to occur this would have never come out of David at the situation not been there but the situation must present itself for the attribute to be expressed tired of being safe I don't know if we get it I don't know if we get it uh when you have just naturally you're born in certain families and in those families there are certain genes that flow through those families certain traits that happen I mean sometimes young men and even ladies they lose hair at a certain age they don't know they don't know what happened it was this way yesterday and now all of a sudden it's like this what happened it's a gene that just kicked in it activated and let me tell you something when the G activates your diet can't stop it when the gene activates you going to the doctor and ask him to give you a special feel it will not stop it there is a genius in you that's automatic come on somebody and there are genes from God that are dwelling inside of you and they are automatic you cannot stop them from being manifested [Applause] just receive Who You Are twice we don't go around with uh t-shirt on and an s on our chest we don't operate like that but you just need to understand that there are things that happen in your life that God is using for his glory and it's an attribute that God is expressing through you let's go a little further Joseph was thrown into a prison well actually before he went to the prison he was thrown into a ditch raised up out of a ditch uh sold into slavery living in Potiphar's house promoted in a prodigal's house demoted to prison because potiphan's wife lies on him I mean trial after trial after trial after trial gets to prison two men have a dream and he's there encouraging them in prison tell me a dream and uh and maybe we can do something about this God gives him the interpretation of the dream the Butler and the baker he interpreted and when he tells amen the butler says now when you get out don't forget about me man forgets about him but God sends a dream to Pharaoh in God's timing this attribute is about to be expressed and in God's timing Here Comes Joseph I mean he's down in the prison and and God says a pharaoh dream and Pharaoh can't get anyone interpreted then the Bible says forgive me I remember there was a guy in prison when I was in there and he told me exactly what's going to happen to me and he told about the baker was going to happen to him and exactly what he said happened say go get that fella bring him out of there right now brought him up to Pharaoh's ferals interpret the dream the dream pharaoh and and as he's interpreted uh he gives him one last piece of advice on his way back to prison he's he says now if I were you I would find the wildest man in this Kingdom and make sure you put him in charge in order to while you got years of plenty make sure he has everything ready before the years of famine come and Pharaoh says okay thank you good advice and then he looks around and says is there anybody anybody wait wait don't go anywhere anybody anybody here why is it in this man anybody nobody okay he will not go back to prison he's actually going to second in charge from prison to power and here is Joseph in his position and he's thinking he's doing very well until one day visitors special visitors show up these visitors are his Blood Brothers he recognizes them I'm not see them for years and it begins to work with them and work with them and start asking questions about the daddy and other brothers and all this and he said he says okay he says my dad is still open I got to figure out a way to get him here to to Egypt through that that God drove amen his father and his brother and all their families right back into Joseph's care and let me tell you something amen I want to pick this up in the scripture Genesis uh 50 verse 17. amen uh Joseph is sitting there amen and Justin join us with all his brothers and one day his dad actually passes away and his brothers realized oh Joseph's gonna get us now he only was nice to us while Daddy was alive but oh my everything coming back on us now we got to come up with some plan to get Joseph to not do anything to us look at what Joseph says let me tell you something before we get there a savior has already endured certain things that forms their character it forms your cat you don't respond to things the way other people respond to it you don't look at things even the way other people look at it you've gone through certain things in your life and it has formed and made you like Christ look at what happened to Joseph look at this Joseph Genesis 15 verse 17 so shall ye sing unto Joseph his brothers have come up with this scheme so shall you saying that Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto the evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespasses of the trespass of the Servants of the god of thy father and Joseph's wept when they speak unto and his brothers and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants and Joseph said unto them not for am I in the place of God but as for you he thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to do what to say much people alive this attribute of Salvation is now being expressed after Joseph have gone through trial after trial after he's gone through test after test it has formed and made his character God did this this when I went into the the pit it wasn't you put me in there God did that when you sold me amen into slavery it wasn't you coming up with that that thought it was God that did that God did that because this day he knew there would be a famine in the landing that to have somebody saved to save much people alive verse 21 now therefore fear you not I would nurse you and your little ones and he confront he confronted them and speak kindly unto them I I I I got I got I got I got more Let me let me uh slip there's let me I gave you a couple couple men that we saw this this attribute going through but let me let me just let's let's just pick up pick up two two sisters in the scripture one of them she had a really really bad testimony but let's talk about the other one that had a good testimony first she was told by her uncle don't reveal Who You Are don't tell anybody who you are we know the king is looking for a new Queen vashti will not come before the king she she was doing her own thing amen but we we needed he put her down so I'm gonna get myself a new Queen at the advice of his servants and uh and they said okay and and when they went looking for all the virgins in the land Mahdi found Esther and Esther please the king blessed be the name of the Lord and here Esther now amen actually please the king she's being promoted to Queen but she has not revealed who she is oh I know who I am but she has not revealed who she is and then there comes a time that trouble strikes Haman decides that he is so upset with this one guy Mordecai he will not bow every time I come around this guy stands with his head up he will not bow everybody else is bound but I'm tired of this guy I'm going to take him out and everybody that's like him I'm taking him out now did not realize Mordecai was related to Esther and in the Kingdom there were only two people higher than Haman that was the king and Esther this is why Esther a man when she was told by by Mordecai now now this guy has put this eating cow he's gonna kill every Jew now I know you haven't revealed your identity but don't think you're safe in The King's path once they realize who you are they'll come after you too it says the why did how do you know that God did not bring you to the kingdom for such a time as this she says okay y'all faster you're gonna pray for me and uh three days I'm going to I'm going to see the king and look look don't notice the words if I perish let me perish why would she say that because a savior is willing to give their all our savior went to a cross and gave his arm so a savior when this attribute is being expressed a savior will give their all she says if I perish let me perish but I'm gonna go in and see the game and and I want to tell you something Esther thought in her mind that God's purpose for her was to be Queen but God actually had a higher purpose than Queen and he put s in the positions that she's the only one that could stand in the gap his his in God's mind he wanted Esther to be the savior and only she could save the people invited came into the house and Finally Revealed revealed my all the Gallows that Haman built for everybody else he got hung on himself but there was a savior in shushan the past her name happened to be estas this other lady in scripture she really had a bad reputation of all reputation but one day she heard that there were two spies coming out of Israel coming in the spot of land and now and she already knew because she knew the word on the street was when Israel comes we're finished there's nothing we can do to fight against them their God is too big for us so she said let me get these two spies have them into my house and let me have a conversation with them I'm not looking for customers I'm looking for salvation and she hid those spies and as she hit them you know they come in and she hit them and and then uh uh uh they said look look rehab this is what you got to do you know if uh if you want salvation because we're going to come we're going to take this and she'll say I know everybody here knows it y'all gonna take the city but I just want my house to be safe give me a token give me a token that you won't destroy my house and I love this she took that red that Scarlet threat throw it outside the window like they told her and they said they told us that anybody that you can get into the house will also receive salvation I love the way Rahab did this her request was not just for me because a savior's not just considering themselves but her request was despair my father and we'll just bear my mother we'll just spare my brothers and my sisters they say anybody you can get within the house will be saved now this this just blessed me because there's a little quote here about rehab that I want to share with you in God's rap gift Rahab the Harlot that we're all familiar with she being a young girl that was turned on the street by a heathen father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and was to bring an income to them on prostitution yet down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard that there was a God who answered prayer and the first opportunity she got to accept that God or do something for him she did it and God's better life and saved a father and mother and a family she fell in love with a general in the army of Israel we find in the history of Merit this general and this courtship was wonderful and finally they settled down and lived at Bethlehem now here's the thing that got me when brother Branham says this if there was an if there was ever an opportunity for Rahab to exclude her family look look my father and my mother even agreed to this I did not register for this job I didn't sign up for this job but yet they they put me in this field so they could get money into their own house if there was any time somebody should have had a reason to be upset with their parents it was rehab because you know oftentimes we hold my mama did this and my daddy did that and you can be savior to Mom and Daddy [Applause] right I mean we we get all these uh these things on the inside of us and we just want to unleash and tell we want to tell every counselor what Mama did and what Daddy did we have such a bitterness and a resentment and an anger but not rehab and rehab and not even have the Holy Ghost [Applause] but yet she has something on the inside of her and she looked beyond what Mama did to her she Liberia what Daddy did to her when the spies came she said is there salvation can I get a token from me and for my father and for my mother can I get something but to protect us to deliver us to save us the same red Scarlet that you let us down bye that Scarlet thread that you used to let us down make sure it's hanging in your window whoever you can get into the house whoever you can get into now they can't be outside hanging out hanging out no no no they must stay in the house salvation can only come to that house and if you if Rahab if you can get them in the house they'll be saved maybe the little nephew say I don't want to go to Auntie rehab's house son if you want salvation so no arguing no no no no no no I don't care what you think about Auntie rehab your thoughts mean nothing right now salvation is only in one place and and now they did not know the strategy of Joshua the strategy of Joshua was marched around the walls well one time each day and then on the seventh day you're gonna March seven times and they might run away and said when you blow the trumpet you know and tell the people don't say a word can you imagine that for Six Days Seven Days not even talking say don't shout until I tell you to shout and on the seventh day seventh time they walked much around that wall and like oh we don't know but they see that Scarlet thread and they told Joshua exactly Joshua mean Jehovah Stadium they told Joshua this is what the promise that we get see that house right there so yeah we see it and God saw it too and when they blew the trumpet every piece of the wall fell except one piece and it's a piece where rahab's house is positioned race was a savior to her family the scripture says he gave them and I want to tell you something it's it's easy to leave this sin Old Testament but I am telling you right now that Gene is still activated [Applause] let me close with this quote that Gene is still activated it's in you it's in you it's in you it's in you sometimes you don't realize what you're going through don't realize how God has expressing himself through you but but that that that Gene is still here but we point them to the savior but don't realize don't don't limit yourself he is using you and and I read it right there to scripture he he gave them he gave him the Savior sent savior sometimes we're so afraid to wear our titles I'm the bride of Christ I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm the wife of God here this uh this quote is out of the deity of Jesus Christ and now how close here oh my my my my my I I'll tell you this if I was still in my Baptist Church I would have never been able to preach a sermon like this but because of what God has done with his prophet and he he has opened this word up to us that we begin to see ourselves in the scripture we begin to see ourselves in the scripture like I said at the beginning when it says a savior in our minds that is the savior we're going to fight for Jesus but I want to tell you something Jesus is also fighting for you and he wants you to recognize Who You Are he gave them saviors the deed of Jesus Christ that same that same Christ Hallelujah let them let the fundamentals let them people who deny the power of God see it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the whole that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you you are the devil's trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little drop down something you're not your sons and daughters of God that deity is not in heaven well where is it then if it's not in heaven where is it if brother Branham is off the scene where is it if Jesus died and rose again some thousand years ago where is Piet it's not an empty tomb where is deity the prophet has given us the answer deity is inside of you I know who I am how do I made myself abuse who God made me to be I'm not ashamed of who I am it is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah you see a prophet saying things like that in 1949. I know you think I'm crazy now you know what if if the brother if brother Brandon could be here right now preaching a sermon and said that we a group of people amen because it's been preached to you you know who you are now it says uh what do you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God Lives in You Immortal Life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being he stood back there he's a creator of all things he made life frogs and all these ducks and chicks and animals created everything and nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he's top the mouth of lions he quits the violence of fire they escape the edge of Sword they raise the dead from grave who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity brother sister that deity is it you here's the scripture a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the End of the Age Christ in the manger no Christ in you Hallelujah Worship in Christ in the manger who we worship is it but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life Hallelujah I The Creator God himself dwelling in the human being does not get up here what we shall be when you when you get your mistake we look at your failures you not as bad off as Rahab she was still used as a savior if God can use a rehab he can use you the prophecy does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall see him as he is for we will be made like him I'm telling you right now the word of God is forming and shaping and molding us into the very image of Christ you're not here to replace Jesus but you are here to be just like him I believe the scripture says Jesus thought it not robbery to be just like his father he thought of not like and you know look I'm gonna tell you in Jesus day he had to fight the the the the the leaders in of that date because they could not understand how this man on Earth could claim to be God well guess what we're going to fight the same fight today how these people you you you you you Christ and you look at you well that's the thing I'm not looking at me but I am looking at what he has done for me and because of that I can claim this oh blessed be the name of the Lord the attribute of salvation flowing in and through each one of you God bless you church God bless you let's have a word of prayer I want to ask my daughter to come and sing a song for you this morning amen um actually maybe both of them can sing a song I'll let Sarah go first and then maybe Rebecca could sing something after that let's pray father your word is sometimes so challenging it challenges our thinking it Channel challenges Lord just uh what we've been taught over the years but you sent us a prophet that would go to scripture and he would see things that the church world was completely missing and it would try to get us to see who we are who we were truly an Eliezer that got a Rebecca for Isis our desire is not Lord Jesus to misplace the word of God but our desire is truly to find out who we are in you because the prophet did tell us that once the brat recognized who she was then the Rapture would go so help us Lord to see ourselves we ask oh God that your blessings would just lay here at this church as I started today just thanking them for what we see from a distance in this year of transition God we we see a servant of God a man of God that have visited the man that could die to himself that his thoughts not his ideas and and and he had the the people's interests in heart what an example man for us to to follow we see Christ in this man it's not really Erickson but it's Christ in him father as a church continues their Journey we pray that you would just anoint brother Wayne and continue to bless the Lord give him everything he needs oh God step into the shoes that he's been asked to feel we pray Lord that the Believers would stay United as one in a body and at the end it would have no chance to come against this church you started True Word you will keep True Word and we thank you Lord for all that you've done we leave our blessing on this place it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] my daughter Sarah [Music] and [Music] operations to you the Lord [Music] the Lord and give you make his
