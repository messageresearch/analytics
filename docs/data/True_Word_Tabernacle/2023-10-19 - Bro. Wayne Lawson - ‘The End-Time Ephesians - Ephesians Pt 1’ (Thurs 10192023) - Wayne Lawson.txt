TRANSCRIPT
========================================
tonight uh we're going to be looking in Ephesians the first chapter and just before we read the word maybe we just might bow our hearts for a word of prayer heavenly father with the book open here before us Lord your Prophet taught us that Lord any man could turn the pages of this Bible but Lord it would take your spirit to open it to us and father tonight as we come to you with humble Heart Lord before this congregation of people Lord before anybody that would see these things we lord we just willingly admit our inabilities Lord but father if you just come by and you would take your word and you would speak it to your children Lord it would help them Lord it would strengthen their lives and and Lord with that in mind tonight we we offer you to come by Lord we open our hearts we open the pulpit Lord we open this meeting Lord to your presence Among Us Lord that we'd just be able to worship you and Lord that you would bring your strength Among Us Lord now father we commit this meeting into theiry faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen and amen and God bless you tonight and uh if you have your Bibles in Ephesians the first chapter I want to read these first three verses Ephesians chapter 1 verse 1-3 uh I've been I've been working on some things for the book of Ephesians for a little while and Sunday uh brother brother Mel just inspired me there uh in the book of Ephesians and I I'm going to maybe I'm not going to speak every service probably on it but I'm going to start a little series here in the book of Ephesians and I've got some things that I just want to work through and uh I'm I'm a I'm a studier by nature and I like the and I like to go through things and the book of Ephesians is some powerful things in it I think it would be a blessing to all of us amen and so I want to um just take tonight for uh for first three three verses of this and read it and then we'll we'll see how the Lord leads us uh Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated tonight I want to uh just speak to you here a little bit on this and if you uh enjoy studying at home uh maybe uh I'll give you a few of the sermon titles that I'm studying personally and you you can go through them if you'd like uh I'm studying the of course the adoption series I think it was three or four parts of that and then also I'm listening to uh a believer's position in Christ uh and then we were also uh looking into uh the Paradox and then we looked into Israel and the church so there's several sermons here that we're that we're drawing from to get direction that it's not just maybe just a one-sided uh situation but looking into all of them and I I have found some beautiful things uh that brother brandham has to say about the book of Ephesians and uh starting out the adoption series it's a real a real powerful that first maybe 20 minutes of the first adoption you'll just get some real nuggets right off the bat and you'll you'll hear some things that are quite a blessing to you I want to read this from paragraph 34 now the book of Ephesians as I was just saying to my opinion is one of the greatest books of the New Testament it leaves us on here where Calvinism runs out on one Limb and armenis runs out on the other limb but the book of Ephesian draws it together and positionally places the church now brother bram's using two um theological terms of groups Calvinism would be the grace Group which would be under Luther and and then but yet on the other limb of this was the armenis which would be the legal arm and the prophet says but both of them meet here in the book of Ephesians which is a very uh powerful thing if you like to know where truth is and you know uh brother B said that's where they meet now if you get on any one of those limbs you'll find yourself way out somewhere you know you get uh you get in it and you can see it in the Reformation of the church when just the just shall live by faith and that's when the Martin Luther's group come out under justification of course they were coming right out of the darkness and if they could just believe the just by faith there was a light that came in the church and they got so on that that after a while they got where they didn't believe in alar calls anymore they didn't believe in evangelism they didn't believe amen and they kind of got into that realm of whatever God does god'll do amen and and you've met people like that when they get into predestination well it don't matter anyhow just what's going to happen is going to happen you know and so they get into that thought you know so they get learning down there brother Bram said but then that's when God raised up John Wesley and then they come in and stomped out the idea he said and then he took it to the legal side and then so we got two arms we got an armenius and we got a legalism he said or a Calvinism he said but see in the book of Ephesians is what pulls the thing together now to make itth to make it make sense brother brandom always I I just love how he does his teaching is so simple It just strikes the heart and brother B explains it when he says see what really it is he says is that by Grace you're saved now that's the scripture he said so Grace is what God does for you he said but now the works is what you do for him but it has nothing to do with your salvation it has everything to do with his grace and in your life and and the prophet will say it he said now here's the only way I can explain it to you he said when I get ready to go overseas he said I got a lovely family and a lovely wife he said we'll get down to pray together when I get ready to go he said she don't give me a balling out and saying listen Mr brandom if you don't behave yourself when you're overseas I'm going to leave you he says it's not that way at all he says there's an understanding of love and it's what's between us and that's what brings Perfection and love is what it is that brings uh the real Revelation to the Church of that brings the balance in it that if you really fall in love with the Lord you're not really going to do things amen that you believe is wrong because you love the lord it's not going to be because he's going to throw you out of the Kingdom or you're going to lose your salvation but you just love the Lord so you're going to do things that are right before him because you love him amen amen and that's exactly I believe when you when you see that Revelation it gives you a liberty in your life to live for the Lord with love and with strength and with truth and and the prophet of God begins to tell us this is where it comes together this is how it fits together in our lives now here in the adoption series brother B will say it like this I'd like to say that this book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament Joshua now Ephesians the book of Ephesians and I've typed it with Joshua and if you noticed Israel was brought up out of Egypt and there's three stages of that Journey one stage was leaving Egypt the next was in the wilderness and the next stage was in Canaan so you see the justification was the leaving of Egypt and then the sanctification was doubt in the wilderness but then it became the baptism of the Holy Ghost when they crossed over the Jordan and brother M said that's the reason we don't believe of course that Canaan represents the Millennium he said see but it does represent the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they're killed and burned and took cities and there is no death in the Millennium so when you you hear people sing about the Canaan land well we use the word Canaan land to sing about heaven but really in the scriptural type Canaan land is not heaven Canaan land is the age of the Overcomer it's the land of our overcoming in this age now and it's been crossed into now in the Paradox brother R will say this Joshua here is a book actually is a book of redemption of the Old Testament Joshua and we would have to consider it to be that because the book of redemption because it's red Redemption has two parts now y'all know these quotes real well Redemption has two parts See Redemption anywhere has two parts so brother B is going to bring that home to us anywhere you find Redemption there's going to be two parts of that Redemption he says now that is out of and into it takes two parts to make Redemption there's a coming out of and a going into to Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt and Joshua represented SED the grace that took him in the promised land I love it how brother bam speaks about that Grace he said the law and the grace you see there were two different aspects of God's commands now the law brought them out Moses and Joshua took them in it represents something for our day now it represents that we are in a journey and we're coming from Egypt into a promised land so we have to come out of the Egypt the chaos and on our road to this promised land in our father's house of many mansions there's a going out of and there's a going into now y'all know a lot of people comes out of Amen but it's that going into it's the that's the real struggle it's not the coming out of it's the going into cuz that's it takes election to bring you into something see law can bring you out but it'll take Grace to take you in and brother R says this you remember brother R says how that Joshua represented Grace he says because watch now Grace was before the law Grace was during the law and Grace was after the law but the law could never position the people it took the grace of God to position the people see remember the Bible says that the law amen could not make the promise ineffective in being that the promise was made 430 years before the law in other words before there was a law ever given by Moses Abraham received a promise from God that these people would go in this promised land so it was not according to the law that they would go in it was according to the promise that they would go in and that promise was a promise of Grace now of course if we're going to look back in the Old Testament and we're going to see the great parallels of why they were going amen but it's beautiful to hear a prophet say it he said but this promise was given to the church is not a natural land but a spiritual land in 1 Peter chapter 2 and9 for you are a holy generation a royal priesthood called out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light amen do you see them we are a people going into a land but it's a spiritual land it is not a natural land so we have to ask ourselves tonight what land is brother Adam talking about what spiritual land brother B says in adoption that the land of promised to the New Testament to the believer is the promise of the holy spirit for it shall come to pass in the last days now he's going to Joel chapter 2 that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your handmaids of manservants will I pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy and I shall show wonders in the heavens now the prophet is actually speaking here now that the promise coming out of Joel chapter 2 is the promise of the end time church that it is a spiritual promise amen amen so we want to remember we got to be a spiritual people because we have a spiritual promise Amen in Joel chapter 2 he's telling this our land now let me just take a couple scriptures here in Ephesians chapter 1 and: 13 Paul calls the holy Holy Spirit the spirit of Promise in Ephesians 1:13 he said to whom also we trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom after that you had believed you were sealed by that Holy Spirit of Promise isn't that powerful by the spirit of Promise can you pull up Luke 24 and 49 and the Bible when Jesus told them to go Jerusalem I love how he says to them behold I send the promise of my father upon you that you tar in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from up on high now these were natural seeds of Abraham they were naturally the Seed of Abraham they were naturally following Jesus they were naturally in the promised land but they didn't have the promise that the father had made to the church in Luke 24:49 Jesus is Calling it the promise of the father now brother randam will say what promise is he talking about he's talking about the book of Isaiah the 28th chapter and the 9th verse Isaiah 28 and ver9 For Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are winged from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept and line must be upon line and here a little and there a little but with stammering lips and other tongue will I speak unto this people to whom he said this is the rest somebody say the rest this is the rest amen this is the rest where with you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear amen this is the rest now that's a powerful thing because that's exactly what the promised land was going to be to Israel it was going to be their rest it was going to be their inheritance it was going to be land that belonged to them amen they didn't have to leave it they didn't have to set it aside they didn't they didn't have to say well this belongs to the Egyptians and we can't have it and and and we got to move on but but this would be their land of rest the same as the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be the place of rest for the believer in the last days now I can go to Hebrews the 4th chapter and you can see that Paul said this that we should fear unless a promise remains for the church now what promise is it that would take the fear from the church it was a promise of the spirit of God and then Paul goes on to say that Jesus did not give us another day to bring rest unto us he says but he said unto us come unto me all ye that are weak and heavy laden and I will give you rest now you all know through scripture there's three rest right there's a rest with God in the beginning he created seven days and a rest came and then whenever the law came they put the seventh day keep it holy and he gave them a rest but but but brother Bram says but the third rest which Paul is talking about was when God gave a rest to the People by coming into them and when God comes into a person it is a rest from their labors it is a rest from wearing whether I'm going to make it or I'm not going to make it it's a it's a place of coming out of that Amen to the altar everynight trying to figure out if I'm saved do I have the Holy Ghost am I going to be wearing now I don't mind somebody coming to the altar you can come all you want amen but it's a terrible thing to see a demon tormenting a person on something that's valuable as eternal life there's nothing worse than seeing amen someone constantly struggling am I saved do I have the Holy Ghost don't I have the Holy Ghost do I have it don't I have it it's a struggle and the devil is the only one that would torment a person like that when the Bible predicts and gives you a promise of Eternal salvation by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen Jesus ain't going to die again the blood ain't going to be shed again the Holy Ghost is not going to be given again so tonight it's really not how much we pray it's how much we receive the promise that God has sent in this age I don't know about you but I'm ready to accept everything that God has for my life amen listen to me young people if you've been worrying in that place let me say to you amen quit worrying about it and receive What the Lord Has give you by a promise and then you drive your steak in the ground and you say God has made me a promise and here I'm going to stand amen now I I know what I'm talking about cuz amen if you don't get to that place in your life every time you say a little something wrong every time say you feel a little something wrong then there you go back wondering do I have it don't I have it but see what he's saying here is there's a promise to the church that they can come out of that place and they can rest and they can rest amen you see when the battle's over that's when madick met Abraham right when the battle was over when the Battle of life was settled amen now you got to battle it out but when that when that that battle settled don't ever let someone take that from you it is the foundation of the peace in your life don't ever let someone place your a Salvation on works right now I'm I'm I'm standing where a prophet's at I know right where I'm at he said legalism is not in this Bible at all it's not on this Bible at all now if there was some way to work our way in when Jes Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane and he made an Earnest prayer he was bleeding sweat drops from his brow the first shedding of seven sheddings of blood was for the will of mankind and he was saying father not my will thy will be done if there be any other way if there be any other way let this cup pass from me amen and we found out there's no other way for a man to be saved saved there's no other way for a man to be saved than that that they receive the Covenant blood of Jesus Christ and as you receive it you receive it by faith and when you comes into the heart God seals the Heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you got a ride it's a Greek or a bond or a male or a free don't matter where you are from and what your belief was when God Saves you you're saved and you're Sav for Time and Eternity amen now we're talking about something powerful here because we we see amen that this that this book of Ephesians is not just written to anybody how many realizes that this book is addressed to somebody it's literally a letter addressed to a people now the prophet will tell us this he says watch Paul said Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus I I mean I just I don't we don't don't have time to preach on every Point here but but I thought it was interesting Daniel that that it introduces him as Paul now there's an entire sermon right there amen it says Paul now that ain't his name Paul is not this man's name actually his name is Saul he was born to Saul he was a he was he was actually born to The Tribe of Benjamin and circumcised on the eighth day and according to Paul's testimony he said concerning the law he was completely blameless and concern earning Zeal he was killing Christians but when he went to do against the will of God look at the god who's rich in Mercy that man set out to kill Christians and it was the Zeal of his heart to do it but God is so merciful that he stopped him in his tracks can you imagine that God had to Blind him to let him see what he needed to see God had to take his natural side to give him spiritual side I know you thank God all the time for things you do for you you but sometimes you are to thank God for the things he kept you from sometimes you are to thank God for the things he kept you from and listen to Paul's testimony here he is his name's Saul and he's a self-righteous Pharisee he has the law on his side and he's going but the pillar of fire amen had an elected group who needed a messenger and a an Angelic Covenant that God had made with a gentile church and he needed a messenger and God came to this man in total Grace it was total Grace that spoke to Paul and he said Lord who art thou and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest amen that great pillar of light when it be to speak to him amen it it actually caused him to go blind Daniel and the Bible said many people didn't even hear it amen saw the light didn't hear the voice some saw the uh I believe they saw heard the voice didn't see the light amen but Paul went to the city uh uh the city and actually went to the Straight Street I I pre preached a sermon one time on getting straight on Straight Street you know amen he was so crooked amen he needed a place to get straight his his his understandings was so messed up he look now look how did Paul get to the right place he had to go to the pillar fire he had to bypass even the Pharisees of his time Amen in Galatians when Paul comes back he said I went three years in the desert and discovered I never learned this Revelation he said in any of my brethren or even up in Jerusalem I never went conferred with the disciples but the Revelation which he had was so Superior to all the other uh disciples that he said even if an angel would come and say something different than what I say let him be a cursed now from there is where brother brandham gets the statement amen that a a redeemed son on the Earth has more power than an angel in heaven he said so this redeemed son so here he meant he changes his name and brings it to Paul now Paul who has been converted met the pillar of fire knows what he's dealing with comes back to the church and writes a letter amen and he says it's by the will of God now I think it's Bing I was reading this this today in believer's position of Christ and brother man gets to talking about the will of God and he said see he said it's like he he confirms Paul he said it was like me that time he said I went down to this Pentecostal church he said man he said there was this girl got out in the aisle and she got to shouting and dancing he said she's dancing all over the building and he said and I got to think it he said I didn't say it now he said but in my heart I thought she was flat wrong I'm I'm just quoting him he said I thought I was that she was flat wrong he said so when I went back down to the to my church he said they got to sing in that meet in the air one time he said next thing I know he said I was out there doing the same thing he said see it was by the will of God now look what he's doing he's taking Paul and he's saying by the will of God something that he thought was flat wrong he found out he was doing himself brother man in this very verse is using that Paul who thought the Gentiles were flat wrong who thought Christianity was flat wrong amen but now by the will of God Amen he's going to open a door of Vance unto the whole Realm of the Gentile church because God who is rich in Mercy has come to this man Paul an apostle by the will of God I I tell you what you could preach a while on this cuz brother Ram says it what by the S hendred Council it wasn't by a group of men by laying on hands they didn't come along brother B said the latter day you you latter rain people he said you think that I'm persecuting the church he said I'm not he said but it's got to be by the will of God see because they want to ordain gifts in the church you know what he's brother man puts out a lot in this verse but he says in the light of rain y'all know they want to make they want to lay hands make prophets out of people but everybody should know prophets or born Prophets You Don't become a prophet you're born a prophet and brother man is teaching us the difference he says see here Paul is an apostle by the will of God it wasn't what somebody wanted him to do or what he wanted to do but it was what God called him to do and he was called to them that are faithful in Christ Jesus I think it's beautiful to the Saints which are in Christ Jesus we're in Catholic country up here and and and most people think Saints has got to be dead you know everybody thinks Saints got to be dead it ain't no living Saints but brother Bram said but Saint actually means a Sanctified one amen he said now if you start praying to Saints he says you're communing with the dead amen I don't know a lot about All Saints Day but I know we got some Halloween coming up and if you want to know what I think about it I don't disagree with brother Ry on that at all I think it's a bunch of heathenism is what I think about it you do whatever you want to but if you want to know what I think and there it is amen I think I think that if you start communing with the dead you're communing with the dead and it's it's a it's a somebody said well brother Brandon don't you believe in talking to Jesus ain't he dead he said oh there's a big difference see he said Jesus raised from the dead and he's alive forever more so we're not here tonight amen we're not here tonight communing with the dead man amen but our lord Jesus is raised from the grave and he's alive forever more amen it's Saints which are in Ephesus now I know they want to wait till they die to make them a saint amen but there are real saints that are alive and I believe they're in this building tonight I believe we have real saints right here in this building tonight Saints of the Lord saints of God Sanctified unto the Lord see Sanctified sanctified people to the faithful that are in Christ Jesus don't you love it that he don't just say Sanctified but he said to the faithful that are in Christ Jesus to the faithful who are in Christ Jesus so this book is being addressed uh to the elected church it's being to them that are predestinated and listen how closely brother B says we'll get to it in a few moments Paul is speaking or addressing Ephesians 1 directly straight to the solder shoulder of the church that's what they're doing tonight this is not for babies this is for grown-ups this is not for babies he says this is for grown-ups amen we're trying to get to full Doctrine see now watch what he's going to do he said who's he dressing not a bunch of babies but to the people that are set in Heavenly places and be blessed he said you know something you've been taught you've been saved and I want to tell you what it's about look at the beauty of that you've been saved now the book of Ephesians is going to tell you what it's about amen when you when you when you start approaching this this an this this will answer a great big area and a great question if you're a studier you're going to see something way far beyond what I'm talking to you tonight about but you're going to see that the book of Ephesians is to people who are already saved the book of Ephesians is not a book that you read to get saved or get the Holy Ghost it's a book to people who are already saved now watch this because you're going to find immediately the book of Ephesians is an adoption book the book of Ephesians is a positionally placed book the book of Ephesians is a josh book now what's he who's he addressing he's addressing to them that are already saved amen he has chosen Us in him before the world began now this book is not to everybody right this book is not to everybody in Genesis 17 and4 you will find that the Covenant that God made was not with everybody it was with Abraham's seed right when God made a covenant with the Earth he made that Covenant with Abraham's seed let's read here as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou sh be a father of many nations now neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name Shall be Called Abraham look at that change of names Saul Paul Abram Abraham amen and a father of many nations I have made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of these and Kings shall come out of thee my goodness we didn't got enough time to preach on that one and Kings shall come out of theee do you do you recognize that he's talking about that whole line of David he's talking about the king of King that whole line of Kings is going to come out of him amen but it's not even to mention the Gentile Kingdom amen where there will be spiritual kings that will come right out of Abraham's loins amen because he'll be a father of Kings Amen in other words we are a royal lineage of Abraham we are not we are not of the ishma church we are not of one of the 12 uh different uh sons that Abraham had but we've come out of the Royal Line amen we've come out of the royal seed amen where it all belongs to you and I look at what he says here and he will establish Amen brother Braham switches the word he says predestinate my Covenant he said between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an Everlasting Covenant and be un God unto thee and to the seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou are a stranger and all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession I will be their God now that's that's exactly what's going over there right now in Israel is the the Palestinians coming from the ishel line they want to take over the Jewish property that God gave them under a covenant to Abraham and Drew out the borders Joshua has the maps it come from an entire birth line that they they belong there it belongs to them but ishmael's line says we are Seed of Abraham as well and it's going to belong to us and there's a war going on but one of them really owns it it really belongs to one of them well there is also a spiritual seat of Abraham which is the Gentile church and our inheritance is not the land of Israel it's the power of the Holy Ghost it's the spiritual land of almighty God that we have been an inheritor in that Land by the grace of God you see amen we were predestinated into it so people say well by the way then when you start preaching these promises they're to everybody they're not to everybody they're to Abraham's seed amen do you see what it is brother manam says it like this Christ was predestinated he was the royal Seed of Abraham do you see that he was the royal Seed of Abraham ishmail was not that seed Isaac was not that seed Jesus was that seed so Sarah didn't have Abraham's Royal seed Mary had Abraham's Royal seed remember it one was by a doubted promise one was through the works of the flesh but the next one was by promise amen and Mary had that seed see what it was when the spirit come on Christ he bore record of the word of God and when the water spirit falls on the word seed the Royal Seed of Abraham faith in God's word will produce the same kind of crop amen you said well I don't believe that he said well then go back to Genesis 17 and read it and he reads the scripture we just read he says what does Abraham see now it's not his flesh see Paul said Jew is the Jew outward is not the real Jew it's the Jew inwardly and what is the Seed of Abraham those that believe the whole word of God oh my goodness isn't that powerful tonight he amen those that believe the whole word of God you say well am I Abraham's seed do you believe the whole word of God then you're Abraham seed you see amen isn't that what the real battle is about amen what seed you're of Amen look at how many times you've had the devil say to you amen there's a Rapture but not for you there's a real Prophet but you ain't a part of it there's a real bride but you're not a part of it amen There's real promises but you're not a part of it but see if you believe the whole word of God it qualifies you as Abraham's seed and you're an heir according to the promise listen amen thank God that he put it in believing thank God he put it in believing now I can go to Romans 4 with you he said this is to the shity of all of the Seed of Abraham remember that it was the shity of all seed that it might be by grace that the Heathen would receive the Promise by the hearing of the word of God in that amazing that's how Rahab was converted it was by the hearing of the word of God she didn't see the Red Sea open but she believed it she didn't see Joshua's commission but she believed it and because she believed it she was a part of it and to think tonight amen the devil can torment us but he can't keep us from believing the word of God in this age listen let me just say it very clearly I didn't see that bridge fall but I believe believe it I didn't see that dead boy raised up but I believe it I didn't see the angel come to the prophet but I believe it I didn't see it with my own eyes that Pillar of Fire in Sam Houston but I believe it anyhow and I tell you the Seed of Abraham can believe the impossible I know the devil will fight you on everything he can fight you on but there is where you stand and say I believe it anyhow [Music] see he can torment you but he can't keep you from believing what is the Seed of Abraham it's them that believe the whole word of God regardless of what denomination Papa Mama or anybody says they believe the whole word of God I will establish my Covenant right now predestinate my Covenant with the seed and in each generation they will believe it there you are the Seed of Abraham now watch God said I will establish it with a seed I'm making my promise with a seed the book of Ephesians is not to everybody it's to the believer it's to the spiritual Jew it's to the person that believes the whole word of God that's who this book of Ephesians is written to to the faithful who are in Christ Jesus can we just read it go over to the book of Corinthians let's read Corinthians uh the 12th chapter let's see see what he says here uh First Corinth Ians CH 12 isn't it verse 13 I didn't write it down but let's let's let's just get it from memory here first Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 13 for by one Spirit can somebody say Spirit by one Spirit by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body isn't that beautiful amen whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free have been made all to drink into one spirit amen oh my by one spirit I love how brother B he'll said it over and over by one Spirit we are baptized into one body what spirit is it then it's the spirit of God that is baptized the church back into the body of Christ it's the spirit of God that has opened up and put man back in the corridors of Glory it's the spirit of God that has baptized you into your original genetics and put you in the body of of God put you air to every promise of God but it's the word that teaches you who you are hallelujah amen it took the book of Ephesians to declare to the church we have rights here man we were born yes we were birthed but what's the rights of the church amen I think it's a powerful thing by one Spirit we are baptized into one body can we catch another set of scriptures galatian chapter 3 and let's look in the eth verse if you're gonna bring it up I won't turn there Galatians chapter 3 and let's look in the eth verse powerful scriptures if you're if you're looking at this it's powerful scriptures Galatians chapter 3 and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto them Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed isn't that powerful keep moving that so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham keep moving it for as many as are the works of the law under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in all things which were written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evidence that just shall live by faith keep moving now amen you see and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them them yeah Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written curse it is everyone that hangeth on a tree now look at the curse that was over the people the curse that was over the church amen but brother Levi he didn't stop halfway up the hill amen he didn't stop I I tell you sometimes it's just staggering to see what Christ done and I I heard brother B on tape this morning he said it like like this he said the anointing left him and he went there as a man I thought oh God what kind of love could push a man without anointing I know what it is to get up in the pull pit and begin to preach and sometimes the anointing is not as powerful as it is other times but you have a duty to do amen and you press through it and any of you ever preach kind of knows that feeling amen but but there's love in your heart and you go on and start carrying out the commission then you feel the anointing as it begins to build amen but you see our lord Jesus operated completely without anointing in the last moments of his life but he knew his position with God was to take the curse away from Mankind and it could only be done through that cross oh amen I'll tell you this how far did he go brother he went far enough to rebuke the curse can I say it like this the spell has been broken off of the church because Jesus went all the way and because he went all the way you and I could go all the way we don't have to stop tonight in justification we don't have to stop in sanctification but we can go on unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost where every Power has been given to the church my goodness what is it it's a breakthrough a Revival the curse has been taken off the curse of sin the curse that you were born under amen it has been broken off of you my goodness somebody said well what you can bring it back up now heyen do you see the curse was moved that the blessing could come y'all y'all immediately brother Bram goes back in the Old Testament puts Jacob isn't it Jacob when he's blessing his the name's Jacob yeah it's when Jacob they go down and Jacob's blessing his sons there and when he brings the Elder and brings the younger and he crosses his hands and he starts putting the the blessing on the wrong one and they said father you're blessing the wrong one he said I know but God has crossed my hands and brother R said there it was in the cross there the crossing of the hands took the blessing from one and put it on the other and there at Calvary God took the blessing and laid it on the Gentiles amen though what a blessing tonight blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places brother man said it like this he said see if you're outside of the Kingdom it's just emotions he said but oh if you're inside there it's spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus Heath redeemed us from the curse which is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on the tree let's continue down that verse The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ which we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith my goodness Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be a man's Covenant yet be confirmed no man dis knowth or adth there un let's keep going we're going to go back down to the 20 of something verse now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made and he saith not unto thy seeds as of many but as of thy one and to thy seed which is Christ one seed watch this many promises look at that there's a plural on the word promise and there's not on the word seed and to thy seeds as of many but as of one to thy seed which is Christ you got one Christ now if you study the message that's a powerful thought because in the Bible in Matthew 24:24 he said there would be Christ and false Christ with a plural brother said be many of them Christ he said but one true Christ one real seed and here he's saying one seed but a lot of promises amen but it's given through one C continue into the next verse and this I say the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years cannot disan know that should make the promise of God of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more a promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise it's a beautiful set of scriptures wherefore the service the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator it's like Paul knew something here huh now there is a mediator is not a mediator of a one but of God is one in the law against the promises of God God forbid if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law amen I I I think it's the actually the 208th verse we're looking for there amen you'll see it the promise of Faith Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond or free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus amen you are all one in Christ Jesus so being born into Christ makes you Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise now look at the power because now we're talking about amen that this is this is coming to a certain people the book of Ephesians is not to everybody it's to a certain people it's to the Seed of Abraham the believer the spiritually birthed people in this age now the prophet of God let us know this he said see who did it God when did he do it before the foundation of the world then if we come in an illegitimate birth through Eve's corruption making us all her children and subject to death then the Sovereign God has to make a way to redeem his children all the father hath given me will come and no man come unless my father draws him now it's amazing to me the book of Ephesians will parallel the Book of Joshua this was brother bram's Ministry Joshua in the Paradox in 65 brother Bram said a few years ago I could take my Bible if you didn't know this about brother Bram is a it's something powerful to know but it could take his Bible and he could get in front of somebody and say what is my commission and he could just lay his Bible down and it would fall open to Joshua the first chapter yeah every time yeah now if you go ahead and try that with your own Bible sometimes you'll find the balance don't work that's that's there's that's a pretty fat part and a pretty thin part it splits at the right part now that split was done by the hand of God now it was a few years later he kept telling people this but then one night brother Ram said a vision came and he said a Bible come out of the ceiling I can just imagine sitting in my office and a Bible come out of the ceiling and a hand read the first nine verses of the Book of Joshua to brother brandham and brother B says that hand came and read them now that's where he takes his text for the message Paradox from those first nine verses in the Paradox brother bam will tell us that when we cross the Jordan that's where all the promises are laying we'll get into the vision later but that's where all the promises are laying is on the other side of Jordan other words on the other side of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that's where all the promises are laying amen do you see every promise lays in the promised land amen a Believer can come to recognition that he needs to be saved then he comes to a stage of sanctification now I will say this in passing tonight sanctification is a place you got to go but a place you can't stay CU that is that fair enough it's a place you got to go but a place you can't stay right because this is the Wilderness Journey for the for the church it was in the age of sanctification in your personal walk brother Bram says if you repent and get Sanctified and don't get the Holy Ghost you'll be seven times worse than you were from before he said that's why that Billy Graham has such problems with his converts he says because he makes him a target for the devil he said because he don't build his nest High high enough and the snakes get into the eggs do you see what it is it takes a moving on into the Holy Ghost it takes a a pressing on in to the spirit of God you got to cross it you got to you got to go to sanctification but you can't stay there you can't just stay in the Sanctified life and say this has got it this has got it this has got it it creates legalism and I just just since we're at home and I'm just preaching I'll say this some of the meanest people you ever met were religious sanctified people the meanest people you ever met in your life is people that only went to sanctification and they never got the Holy Ghost cuz if they would have got the Holy Ghost they'd have had some long suffering and some gentleness and some kindness and some peace and they would have had something in them for a little kindness but you just take a now we just we just come out of the age sanctification and they come up so far but they wouldn't go into the holy Spirit In other words they wouldn't let a divine nature come in amen and they got Sanctified and it just made them religious and made them mean and they keep up with how many services you miss and they keep up how y'all know what I'm talking about it's all a set of rules but listen I don't know about y'all I've had all the religion I want I've had all the measuring tapes and all the rule books and all I've had all of that I want amen but if we get the spirit of God on the inside of us amen he's our leader he's our guide he's our teacher and we're not doing these things because amen somebody said we couldn't we do it because we love God and we want to be a good influence in this age we don't want to be no stumbling block we don't want to cause somebody to stumble over our lives amen so we give our hearts to Christ and we move on in there it's in Ephesus brother B says he says in Ephesus after the day of Pentecost see there comes an Ephesus brings us positionally like in Joshua see what happens is is Joshua wasn't taking these people just anywhere he was taking them to a place their name was on now now many of you know this some of you might not but Jacob had 12 sons and those sons names were the names of the 12 tribes of Israel it would be like George washingon had 50 kids and some of them were named Arkansas Michigan Louisiana so the the the the name of the tribe was the name of one of the sons of Jacob which had his name changed to Israel so Israel had 12 sons the nation Israel had 12 tribes and 12 states of land that was divided in 12 places but the division of that land was not by Joshua's own thinking but in Genesis the 30th chapter when those children were born there mothers now think about this their mothers when they were birthing those children cried out a name and a labor pain and the prophet said that name that they cried out positionally placed Israel in its Homeland and he said the name represented by the well over the wall next to the Sea it represented where they belonged amen and there they were birthed and went into that Wilderness and there they went into Egypt and there they were 400 years at away from it but after 400 years God still remembered where they belonged God still remembered where they was at and how they were going to get there but when Joshua come unto them it was the grace of God that could look at a tribe and say that's your land and that's your land and that's your land now amen it's exactly The Inheritance that we're talking about in the book of Ephesians amen it was a division of the land casting lots and placing them each one but the prophet speaking of you and I said God had us in his mind from before the world began remember that he put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world and when he spoke I wondered one time how did he put my name on the book y'all ever wonder that how did he write my name on the book I tell you what I like to shatter my heels off when I found it brother Bram said he' spoke your name yeah that's why the spoken word calls your name it was written by the spoken word and you're called by the spoken word but the spoken word of this message matches the spoken word that was in the mind of God that's why the Baptist can't place you and that's why the Lutheran can't tell you who you are that's why that the Pentecostals could never position the church cuz they didn't have the mind of God but this message has opened up the mind of God and a prophet has spoke back the adoption Authority into the church Calling You by name oh he spoke your name position he placed you gave you a promise now let me say this when a prophet begin to to to divvy up this and he begin to split this inheritance brother Greg early on Amen brother Bram couldn't tell the difference sometimes between Israel promises and Gentile promises when we first come into the land he said some things mixing it up but you watch as we get closer to 65 Things become clearer and clearer and clearer and as he gets to the end of it he starts saying things like the bride can do Greater Works he starts saying things like the spoken word is a part of your inheritance and what's he doing he's dividing those things into the church as an inheritance of you and I as Sons and Daughters of God that promise is not for everybody Mark the 11th chapter Pentecost the world name it claim it has nothing to do with Mark 11th chapter that is for sons of God who are positioned in the promises of God and through Divine orders they can speak the word of God now don't think it'll come without fighting don't think it'll come without fighting if you want to see if you want to see in the natural what you're facing in the spiritual watch Hamas right now and watch Israel right now Israel is there and I could take this Bible and stand here all night and prove to you that it is an eternal land and it belonged to them from before the world began and God gave it to them through prophets he raised it up he certified it and gave it but watch those terrorists attack them on their own land and then the whole world get up in arms because they prend themselves you see the same thing in the Church of the Living God God you see it terrorists attack the move of God they attack the prayer lines they attack the move of the Holy Spirit they attack the dancing in the anointing they attack Every Which Way But if you would turn and defend yourself well he's just fighting well he's just this well he's just this listen folks we got god-given privileges the spoken word belongs to us the moving of the spirit belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us it is a land that we're living in it's full Doctrine I don't know I've been attacked a lot I know these men of God have I I was laughing the other day and I I don't want to reveal too much of your private testimony so you can tell it later or whatever you want to do but he said when he first come out of a movement I'll just put it that way first come out of a movement well that that movement the teachers the spirit behind it was so rough that any emotion it's Pentecost yeah any emotion it's just Pentecost it's if you cry a little well you're just emotional it's emotional manifest it's just just so they name call the thing to disposition the church from being able just to rest just to just to rest you know I'm watching something happening I probably a little open here but let's just say I'm watching something happening in the world around the churches right now a little war going on of whether we should worship shouldn't worship whether we should or shouldn't what and they're making it to the place where you can't hardly preach no more and just preach the quotes and move home without somebody what's he mean by that what's he mean by that I tell you what we ought to do is just inherit the promise amen forget the devil and everything he said and everything he's got in his mind it's a Church of the Living God we got a right to it I believe it I believe those right are there and I believe God has put men of God into this age amen that can stand here with the promises of God and tell every uncircumcised devil you've got no right to take away what God has G give the church give it in power give it in might I'll take a few minutes in closing y'all okay amen you you see here brother bam says it like this adoption in the message adoption he said teaching is treacherous and I got to agree with him when you get to teaching amen that's where the the the rub starts happening isn't it we get to teaching a little bit but brother Bram says but I think and feel at this point it might be good to bring the church to what I think is a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think preaching is a wonderful thing and brother biller beer teaching goes beyond the little especially to the church preaching catches The Sinner you've seen it he said brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are right now now some people say well brother Wayne don't believe in teaching that's a lie I do believe in teaching I just don't believe in a bunch of dry teaching I don't believe in a bunch of intellectualism being put in the place of anointed teaching now y'all got to be you got to be honest sometimes a man ain't got a call in his life he has no anointing in his life six-foot icicle and he gets up and says he's a teacher so everybody just has to endure for hours because usually they're not short- winded I might as well just be honest they're not usually short- winded they just go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and the longer they talk the colder it gets amen you know what I'm talking about so don't throw away teaching because you've seen somebody wasn't called to teach teach there is a real teacher there is a real gift of teaching there is a real anointing that comes in and lays the word together and when you see that word coming together brother it ought to create something on the inside of the church that'll make it stand in the face of hell and say it belongs to me anyhow the devil says you can't but it's mine anyhow because we believe in it amen it's a right kind of teaching brings a right kind of faith I tell you what a prophet said he said many times what we're getting is Hope instead of Faith teaching would give the faith he said sometimes we're getting hope instead of Faith he said now what what's what's the real difference I'll tell you the real difference hope is believing that he can Faith is believing that he did hope is I'm praying God's going to heal me Faith is God healed me Faith is that which puts it in tomorrow and if you're not careful becomes the enemy of your healing because the devil gets in your hope and puts it off to another day but faith can stand with the word of God and say by Stripes I am healed I am healed tonight I am saved tonight do you see that don't hope you got the Holy Ghost let faith come on the inside of you and say I got the Holy Ghost by the blood of Jesus Christ make it come from a hope to a faith now brother BR breaks into it he says I'll just preach it instead of read it to you he said but this whole world is full of electricity but you can go stand out in the middle of a field somewhere that's dark and wish for light he said but electric is real but you got to put it there through a conduit so there's a way to put electricity in that dark place but you got to follow the laws of it you you stand there and you're up there on Lake Erie and and and then you go somewhere and it's so dry that they can't grow any plants and you say how is it all this water could be on the Earth but this place don't have any that but but the brother B said but see watch you can use the laws of gravity you can use a certain law and bring the water to another place if you follow the right laws and so is there a law of faith that law of Faith Works in the church but if we would be taught right that law would work better every day now you say taught right brother Wayne what does that mean if we're taught right the law of faith will access a greater law because what happens is if there's some unsur in us if the devil's got a little spot there he's working on you see you can get along and go to church without that okay you can come to meet and even say amen and that'll be okay but when you get to that Showdown when you get to that real hard spot if the enemy can move you off of that by maybe it don't belong to me maybe I shouldn't be here maybe it really isn't something I should do then all of a sudden now you are dispositioned because your faith is wrong so if you stand there tonight and you're saying well amen I I I'm this because I because I felt this way and I thought that way and I this this if any of those elements are in your positioning you'll lose it let me just let me just go real quick here if your if your positioning has to do with your feelings do you know brother B said Satan will beat you on the stump with that cuz you felt good then you felt bad brother M says it like this he says if you're looking in a mirror at your self you will lose your position he said but if you would turn and look at Christ isn't that something tonight if you look to Christ you'd gain the strength you need for that perfect Faith amen it'll fill your charge your life with electricity it'll give you the law amen what we have is an Ephesus we have an Ephesus of Faith moving into Faith amen amen why don't you stand with me tonight there must come an Ephesians to this far musicians would come I'm going to get long I'm sorry amen there there's got to be an Ephesians to this right there's got to be an Ephesians to this brother bam tells us this very closely he says there's got to be an Ephesians to this journey the same as there was to that Journey now we're not talking about the Ephesus Church age we're talking about that perfect church that was in Ephesus those Ephesians there's got to come an Ephesus to this we've got our Joshua we got our seed we got our Believers now if we take the word and we stand there with that word the book of Ephesians will place us to a position that we can fight we can we can stand positionally and hold ourselves in that word amen I I pray it was a little help tonight I'm going to I'm going to be combing this I hope it's okay with y'all I might comb through the book of Ephesians a little bit amen I just had it on my heart the right kind of Faith yeah amen you said the right kind of faith brother Wayne yeah I'm talking about adoption faith hallu brother Bram immediately takes it to being an ambassador to checkbook Authority where the promises belong to the church and you and that's exactly where we are in this stage of the journey we're not we're not coming to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the church is past that point we've crossed the Jordan we're on the other side sir and there's the land now the beautiful thing is brother Braham said it like this he said we got to we got to take every corner of it remember what the scripture said don't leave no bushes don't leave no don't leave no spots don't leave anything for the enemy to hide possess every possess every corner of your land amen amen you got a song tonight brother Brian
