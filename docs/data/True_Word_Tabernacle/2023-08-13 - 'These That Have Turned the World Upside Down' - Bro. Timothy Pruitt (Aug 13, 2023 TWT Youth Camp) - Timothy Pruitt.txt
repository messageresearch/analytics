believers brother Matthew mcclart has been a huge part of our course staff amen and uh and you know the first year that we did this you know everything was just quite experimental and it's just amazing how supernaturally God has put this together you know because uh one would come and say brother Nathan if I can help with if with anything I'd like to help I'd like to help well why don't you do this and well why don't we try you being over this and and uh and you know if we'd have tried to we could not have put together a more a more cohesive and and and and and and gifted and just just uh just a well-oiled machine of a team amen so we just we see the Lord in it amen we see his will and so we appreciate everyone and and uh and really everyone deserves recognition those that have been

amen we uh we appreciate Brother Richard we appreciate uh Our Song leaders our musicians amen you know an artist is measured uh into in one of two ways either by their talent or by their anointing and this weekend we haven't been lacking it either so God's been good to us amen we appreciate them [Applause] [Music] amen we really appreciate brother Nathan and sister Natalie and their coffee shop

for the spirit amen and they have really they've really uh blessed us this weekend and and we really want to take a moment to appreciate the ministry that we've enjoyed this weekend love you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's been a good three years amen amen and we appreciate also our speakers that took some time with our older youth brother Aaron and brother Samuel just did a tremendous job and the Lord has really moved with uh with the special sessions we had with our 21 and up and friends and and I want to thank all of you that have come for these last three years and have supported this thing it's been overwhelming it's been humbling and and I appreciate you so much like we've said we've we've got well over 40 probably approaching 50 churches that are represented here together and it's just amazing what the Lord has done with what a few years ago was kind of a wild dream and here we are amen so thank you for getting behind this thank you for getting behind our young people amen thank you you might say brother Nathan you know you've got quite a platform here what do you intend to do with this with this audience with this Outreach and what's your agenda with this so we happen to have one and uh and you know I I so appreciated the message last night brother Andrew because the way that he presented it is just exactly in the vision of this Camp our agenda our vision our purpose our drive is to lift up the message of Jesus Christ hey man this is not about a church this is not about a Ministry this is not about a personality this is about an end time message a living word for this day amen amen friends I would like to ask you today have you heard the message amen if you're not aware there's a message in the land friends and in the middle of this land of Darkness Darkness on the face of the Earth and a gross heavy Darkness on the people there is a light today there is a light that has pierced this dark world Amen and found seed of God that was laying in this earth and has quickened us to life that's what the message is it's quickening power brother sister it's not a Creed it's not the church that you belong to it's not the lifestyle that you were raised in amen it's the power of God Amen which has been spoken into this age to bring Sons and Daughters of God to manifestation amen it was sent to call you out amen with everything that we do with all of our effort we want to lift up the message of Jesus Christ amen to walk in this evening light and give God all the preeminence that he deserves and see this bride amen come into the fullness of the blessing that she has prophesied to receive amen we that's what we're trying to build friends amen we're not trying to build a church here we want you to take these Revival fires home to your church we want to build the message [Music] Pride built up by an end time evangelism brother Graham said we're trying to light these fires we know that the nation has rejected its Revival amen we know that this generation amen will not receive a Revival there will never be a great Revival sent down on our country on this world on its religious systems amen but when you hear the vision of a prophet he said what we're trying to do amen he said we're trying to light Revival fires on every Hill that we can amen wherever this message can be received let it go to the farthest corners of the Earth Amen Let It Quicken every last seed to life hallelujah how many love the message today how many love the word many people say well brother Nathan what we need to do we need to get our young people to Christ and then show them the message that's not how we believe it friends if that's what you believe you've missed the whole thing amen because this message is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is still speaking and moving amongst his people today he's still revealing his deity through a bodice body Ministry today but what he wants to do is get a group of young people a new generation amen that he can draw them unto himself and take his deity and pour it into young men and young women and reveal the mystery that was in him before the foundation of the world which mystery you are young people for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before [Music] hey man you were Sons and Daughters of God before there was a moon stars or a molecule Hallelujah what a blessed message amen that's what this is about friends this is not wildfire this is not strange fire but there is a pillar of fire that is moving amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ it's thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride amen and the pillar of fire has been here this weekend and has met some young people on the sacred Sands with a voice that could speak from a burning bush amen and speak right right to where you're at friends speak right to your heart he's spoken in our sessions with the older youth amen the the the the inspiration that that brother Samuel and brother Aaron had it dovetailed so beautifully together we could not have we could not have coordinated had we tried amen I want you to believe young people that God is speaking to you this weekend and I want you to believe that he's going to do it one more time amen you remember last year when chains were breaking brother Timothy had left the platform he was already on his way out that side door but there was one heart there was one young lady sitting in this congregation still Bound by complexes still Bound by fear amen and it was one young lady's desire amen that that that sent the hand of the Lord and pulled brother Timothy out of that office to tell you that you are beautifully and wonderfully made amen this message friends is a living breathing thing this is not a dead letter this is not a Creed amen it's a living reality living reality it speaks amen what good is a we talk about well we've got the word we've got the word but brother Bram said if you if you had a sword of the word and and if you you could just strike and strike and strike if that sword didn't have something to to cut the Veil amen if the word doesn't cut the veil if it doesn't reveal Christ if it doesn't make him a living reality to you then it's no good but he said the word in an ordained hand he said that word when it comes into an ordained hand that it'll be a sword that'll rip the Veil so brother Timothy as we invite you and appreciate you this morning there's only one thing left to say let a rip [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah said Hallelujah how wonderful is our God and how great is our God what a mighty God we serve don't you just love him with all your hearts don't you just appreciate his presence and all that he's done in our lives and the victories he's brought and amen just overwhelmed at all the things that we witnessed and seen and amen God's a good God he's got you in his mind he he had you in his mind before the foundation of the world it's what he thought has how much he thought of you been thinking of you a long time and he's here to touch you this morning and to minister to your needs well you know brother brother Andrew said last night he was up the night before fighting devils [Music] and we saw last night the reality and the Fulfillment of devils that were defeated and driven out Devils that have lost their power well last night I wasn't up fighting devils I was up I kept getting woke up about everything like every hour hearing shouts of victory here in shouts of victory amen voices that were screaming out I'm delivered I'm free I'm not going back no more Hallelujah just to let you know what kind of service we're going to have amen let's just bow our hearts together in prayer father we just want to say how much we love you Lord and how much we appreciate you and thank you for all that you have done all the wonderful Works you've done and accomplished this weekend Lord I know there's more and I sometimes we wonder how can it get any better how can it get any greater but Lord we we're sitting in a place of unlimited resources unlimited power and we just ask the Lord that your presence will come and touch hearts and touch lives again this morning to give us strength Lord as we walk out of this place in this atmosphere and we go to our buses into our vans and we'll know Lord we're not leaving you here we're not going home alone but you're going with us and you'll be in this with us in our bedrooms and our cars and places of business wherever we go Lord in our churches Lord we can take this revival fire with us and go spread it around Lord and show what all God has done we love you with all of our hearts we thank you for this opportunity and we bless you this this morning in Jesus name amen Acts chapter 17 and verse 2. still nothing here amen I'd like to say once again it's just been an honor to be here with you and amen they kind of gave me the difficult job this weekend of starting and finishing and so amen we're okay because we know where we're standing today and amen Acts chapter 17 and verse 2. it says in Paul as his manner was went unto them and three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures opening in a legend alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and have risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ and some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas and of The Devout Greeks a great multitude into the chief women not a few but the Jews which believe not moved with envy and took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sword and gathered a company and said all the city on erupt on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people when they found them not they drew Jason and certain Brethren unto the rulers of the city saying these that have turned the world upside down or come hither also whom Jason has received and these all do contrary to the decrees of seizure saying that there is another king one Jesus amen how many can say that this morning there's one king amen the King of Kings the Lord of lords amen we let you be seated like to speak to you on these that have turned the world upside down amen amen yeah yeah the prophet of God has said it like this he said God's strategy is to take empty vessels empty-human vessels and shake the world with them like at Pentecost at Pentecost what did he do he took 10 days to get all emptied out but they was all standing there with their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up that's all and they shook the world and that's the need of today amen I you know I'm not interested in you just shaking the world in the sense of Europe or or the world economies and world powers and all that but I'm excited I'm expecting you to go home and Shake Your World amen your world Amen the world that you live in your bedroom your car your places that you live amen amen amen I believe that you're going to go home with a with a power that is not your power but it's his power because it's not our lives that can do these things it's not our lives that can cast out Devils it's not our lives that can live above sin but it's his power amen living on the inside of us therefore when we receive power from Christ and in our lives come the Holy Ghost I believe that's what God did this weekend amen I believe that you came with complexes and you came with fears and and you came with anxieties and you came with all kinds of issues in your life but God sent us big old bulldozer down and he cut all those things to pieces and he just put them off on the scrap pile somewhere and in your life he's built a Hallelujah Avenue amen it ain't the same place no more the Holy Spirit has brooded over you this weekend to now big beautiful flowers of Salvation are standing up you don't have to try to impersonate anything it's a new heart that's come inside of you it's a new spirit that's come inside of you everything is new he says how the dev how can the devil walk back there and expect those same old things there again that same old fussing that same old Fighting those same old complex everything that you had in you but when he walks back he finds that God has took a bulldozer and he has run everything out and he's turned the whole ground upside down he's built Big Terraces put a beautiful home there and he himself has moved on the inside of you he said oh I feel religious right now the Holy Spirit has come and he turned over your Tin Can Alley and he dumped it upside down and he swept out all that stuff and inside of there he creates a new heart he creates a new life not only that but he moves in to see that from now on everything's going to go all right amen glory to God he is the caretakers he has caretakers that is assigned to you amen listen you're not going to go home and have to worry about all this by yourself no he is assigned angels on your behalf he's assigned angels to follow buses home he's assigned angels to get in cars amen when you go home you're gonna find Angels that's around your room and moving in your life because they're caretakers of his property and his angels going to be there when the Devil comes back and he says no you move back this ain't your place no more this ain't your dwelling place no more you used to live here but you don't live here no more you used to come in here but you don't come in here no more you used to abide here though but you don't abide here no more amen God has come and listen listen don't don't get the idea that when you're gonna go home that Satan's going to just kind of roll back and and take it easy on you know he's going to continue to try to come he's going to continue to try to hit you but if that Eternal question has been settled in your heart amen there's not a devil in hell that can shake you from it Hallelujah listen young people you're gonna go home to trials you're going to go home to situations you're going to have mind battles is still going to come but if that Eternal question has been settled on the inside you can point him right back to where that steak was driven and say devil right there I changed right there I once was but I'm no more that man right there I used to be this but I know more of that I used to be covered up with fear I used to be covered up with complexes but that's not me no more I'm a blood ball son or daughter of the king okay Hallelujah he's going to try to make you believe nothing happened he's going to try to make you believe it wasn't a real experience because you're still having battles no God gave you an experience so you can win hey man you come in here whipped but you're going out equipped amen you're going out with something on the inside of you and when that Devil Comes against you next time he gonna say whoa wait a minute see Satan is a master of minimizing the word and maximizing excuses amen see you know the word's been preached to you and the Bible says it is her brother Jonathan preach on it he sent his word and healed you read it in Psalms he sent his word listen that is what has delivered you amen it wasn't you know we get to one we get to wanting these certain things to happen you know wait a minute I'm gonna get ahead of myself he will minimize the Vindication of the word and bring forth to the front for Forefront every excuse imaginable and make them bigger than the Vindicated word of God the worst part of making excuses isn't altogether the missed opportunities it isn't the guilt that you might feel amen after you lied to yourself it's not the money you might lose or the relationships that might end or the Broken Dreams you never fulfill the worst part about an excuse the hidden danger is that you'll eventually start believing them [Applause] eventually your excuse will become the truth no matter how much God speaks to you through the word of God the longer you make excuses the more you actually start to believe them and you'll no longer cringe when you say it because it's become the truth listen to this right here in John 5 you know there was a man that was at the pool of Bethesda he'd been laying there 38 years there was a certain man been ill for 38 years and when Jesus noticed him laying there helpless knowing he had been in that condition a long time he knew how long that man had been there he knew how bad it was he knew how impossible it seemed and he asked the question do you want to get healed do you want to get healed do you want to get to I'm going somewhere do you want to get to every day that no doubt this man wished for healing he wished for deliverance he wanted it he desired it he thought but Jesus comes and he goes right to the real root of the problem do you want to get healed amen what do you want to get well seems like a terrible question to ask somebody in that condition that God had been paralyzed for 38 years he had missed out on Joyce for a long time that we take for granted and Jesus had the nerve to ask this question do you want to get healed this question makes no sense until this man starts making excuses [Applause] well I wanted a certain preacher to pray for me to me directly it's a way that to a preacher that I know it was him listen this is his word you don't need really a preacher to tell you by his stripes you're healed because it's in his word you don't need her amen some certain thing to happen if it's in his word but the problem the devil wants to make you have an excuse why you're still living the Way You Are some of you still bound this morning because of your excuses you came to a prayer line with excuses [Applause] my brother Andrew didn't say this or brother Wayne didn't do this or I didn't get this happen listen let's do away with excuses this morning I'm telling you this morning don't leave here with excuses amen leave here with a promise leave here with the victory leave here with love and compassion in your heart well no one helps me no one has picked me up and and took me to the pool before I get there somebody's already beat me amen amen remember I heard y'all shouting the victory it's gonna be all right do you really want to get well see Satan had maximized the excuses and minimize the word do you want to get well or do you want to continue to identify with excuses do you want to get well or do you want to continue to believe the lies

want to be delivered well I was expecting something else to happen and it didn't do you want to be healed [Applause] see people begin to worship their excuses instead of the word of God they begin to lift up their excuse of why something didn't happen and why this listen you need to turn your thoughts to the word of God the word said I could have it therefore I can have it the word said I'm Healed therefore I'm Healed the word said I'm free therefore I can walk out of here free the word said I could have joy and I'm going to leave here with joy the word said it the word said it the word said it do you want to be delivered do you want to be healed we'll get some grit about you [Applause] you know some reason some of y'all still bound you know why because you don't hate that stuff enough [Applause] if you hate pornography you'll never go back to it if you hate lust demons and you hate it when it comes in your mind because you can't help thoughts from coming but you'll take it subject to the word of God but we go with our excuses well it's in my bloodline it's in my daddy did this and my mama did this therefore I know I don't got to do that there is a greater power there is a greater blood that like family history Hallelujah we are not in this service this morning to worship our excuse but I got an excuse I'm tired Carol but tell that tell our devil to get out of here this

of Jesus I'm going to defy the laws of seizure and say there's one God hey oh yeah we're gonna deal with some excuses this morning the boss said take off your shoes brother Adam said what if Moses would have said I'll take off my hat in my way it's the way I think God ought to operate you ain't the one who started the burning bush let me tell you something you go out there and speak and you say Bush burn it begins to burn and there ain't no fire I might listen to you for a moment for just a moment when you start saying something contrary to the word we're done I don't care what kind of signs and wonders you got amen but here here Moses comes up to this Burning Bush and he walks up to it and the boy speaks says take off your shoes well I'm just going to take off just something else what can I give up tonight what was he wanting him today to come and come entity common reverence strip your Sprite off [Music] someone's been in the message long enough to get a lot of pride hey man amen hey don't worry I heard some older folks shouting last night too amen hallelujah Moses slipped off them shoes and started walking up that was the angel of the Lord Jesus Christ sitting in that bush the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel he said any teacher knows that the angel of Covenant was Jesus Christ he was the rock that was in the wilderness he was the brass serpent he was all in all the Patriarchs he was in David he was down through the New Testament and he's in his church tonight the same Lord Jesus yesterday today and forever and he changes not oh he didn't like excuses then and he don't like him now [Applause] God told Moses he said well Moses but I I can't say much I don't have good speech you know I used to have that same excuse I said I don't want to be a preacher I hate being in front of crowds give a book report in school I just shook me to my but the devil devil knows how to pull those excuses over your eyes people say brother Ronnie was saying on the way here he said man you are hey you always so calm it's kind of like a duck sitting on the water he just gliding across but underneath he kicking like all get out good yeah when God determines anything you're going to do it anyhow I'm going to say that one more time because I went hit the back wall if God is determined to do anything you're going to do it anyhow God has his way set and you're going to do it so you might as well give in and start to work that's all so he showed him signs he he put his hand in leprosy put it back in a clean he throwed a rot down snake to pick the back up and it goes down that as we was talking about the first night that light made such a change in that man's heart and that man's life brother Brandon said you talking about something ridiculous he said let me come across let me look across let's look come across the hill one beautiful morning the sun's Rising the birds whistling all of a sudden steps out an old man about 80 years old whiskers flying everywhere white hair bushing bushing behind him leading the old mule with a wife sitting a straddle with a young and on each hip crooked hand and stick in his hand here he goes where are you going Moses I'm going down to my bedroom to take over there I'm going down to my house and I'm going to take over hey there's a lot of enemy over there don't matter God said go take over he said you mean you're going to take over I sure am why because God said so sure we're going to take over that's all God said it and if God said it that settles it write this down if God said so you can do it if God said so you can do it it doesn't matter what the devil tries to stop you or how many Devils tried to arise in your path if God said so you can do it well that's ridiculous you got what you got in there we've got a nuclear weapons you got what you got I got a stick oh this dick this Rod produces miracles what you got in your hand I mean you got a stick this morning raise it up this is how I fight my battles this is how I fight my battles this is how I fight my battles [Music] I don't fight it because some preacher said something I fight it because God said it God said you can live above fear God said you can live above pornography said you can go home and take over God said you can go home and drive that enemy out of your life because when a preacher ain't there when the church ain't there when Mom and Daddy ain't there God is still there he's still on the throne a stick wasn't very much but it was a stick he said well brother Brandon I can't even whistle let alone testify it will do something whatever is in your hand get going we're at the end of the road let's get out of here tomorrow let's testify to somebody let's do something about something don't stand still you say I am a timid person Moses said the same thing he said but you know what one time over the football stadium I was preaching in I walked in there was a sign that hung over the door it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's size of the fight in the dog but why not how about fell out the other day somebody sent me a picture of these two sharks swimming together one was ate up from one end to the other other sharks said what happened to you he said I got in a fight with a Chihuahua oh I can see it this morning down in hell I told Brother Andrew last night as he's laid out and I said man if the wind inside looks this good how bad does the losing side look like you see it right now out as one laid over on the couch he got bandages his arms Twisted all up one devil said what happened to you he said you know there was this little woman with a skirt little dress she come through that prayer line and I was holding on next thing I knew I was getting shook all over the place next thing I knew it she would throw me down and she was stomping a butthole what'd you get in fight with I got in a fight with a woman there ain't nothing worse than a man getting whooped by a woman he don't want everyone to admit he ever got whooped by a woman but the devil's got a minute there's a woman upon this hearse and every day he's getting whipped he's getting tormented he's getting put back in his place what happened that woman again what happened that woman again she began to believe and I'm holding on to it with all I had and I'm saying you can't have it tonight tonight you're not your night but all of a sudden something began to pulsate on the inside of her in the beginning and she began to believe and she said I can I will I do believe she's up there now turning the world upside down it's time that you quit being the tormented and become the Tormentor it's time you quit being a defeated and start being the Conqueror you can conquer your bedroom you can conquer your car you can conquer that devil that's whisper in your ear tithe after you can all right you give a timid person enough wine [Applause] I'm just going somebody was talking about I'm just gonna say how brother Jewel talked about it he said they want to talk about black people white people I'm not trying to make this a racial thing we ain't we only one race we're only one race that's the Heavenly race [Applause] he said you know he said he said people used to say white people worship different than black people but they'll find he said when I was out in the world he said I had a white buddy we get drunk we acted the same way he said you know what I come down I found when I come to the house of God I love brother George my brother's been in a battle so I'm gonna say it for him this morning when I come down to God I've found out if we get to watch we getting that wine strong enough a white man a worship just like a black man black man worship just like a white man Spanish red yellow white don't matter if you're timid this morning getting some wine you're getting enough of it you'll be like that old mouse you gotta chased around fell off with some wine you know that story and he got drunk on that wine that come out of that wine bottle and he said where's that stupid cat at now [Applause] the mouse still looked like the same Mouse he didn't get no big muscles he was still the same Mouse but what changed was what was on the inside of him I'm looking at some young people saying where that stupid devil at now they wanted to destroy try to destroy me they wanted to try to rob me service after service well that stupid devil had you say well I don't teach my children to say stupid you got the wrong preacher I found out Philistines they some stupid people that was 500 of them came to one man that got enough hello he had enough that devil had come service after service after service and robbed him of his Harvest robbed him of his family robbed him of his Children's Health and robbed him and robbed him for one day he was stagging around didn't know what to do in here and all of a sudden he fell against the rod something changed on the inside of them you know what had happened he started reading I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I'll never leave you or forsake you my children has a covenant not you will and I will I will I'm just waiting for somebody to take me at my word and I'm going to fulfill it he jumped out of that house and he began to whoop the listings one after another after another after another after another after another now you be the judge 498. let's give them 498 there's two left and he stayed they stayed there till they was dead you know why stupid we heard about it Jawbone a thousand they're coming at Samson he picks up a Jawbone just seemed like nothing but it was representing what was in that word [Applause] and there was enough power in it that could hold together to beat through Philistine Army armor and go to all the way down to a thousand okay nine you think by now they've learned a little something 900 and 95 no no we're going to stay till we get all of them dead we're just all gonna die I don't know about you brother Wayne but if I'd have been there and I hadn't be a Philistine it wouldn't have took a hundred I mean something's happening here beyond our control if a man could take a Jawbone and whoop us and we got swords and sealed Shields and all this something you know why stupid the devil is more stupid than you give him credit for you know why I say that because he's fighting you with all his God and he knows he's going to lose hey he's fighting you with everything he's got and he knows he's going to lose well the devil can fight that hard no he's going to lose how much more can you fight knowing you're going to win Hallelujah I'm here to talk to you this morning you're not losers you're winners you got to get determined [Applause] you got to have a determination when you leave this camp well Stephen heard something you preached the other day I I might steal it I'm sorry power side that's where I like it too don't give me this bunch of weak nothing I want something got some power in it hey man some of you don't go tree War Tabernacle you don't know what we're talking about yeah so I'm trying to do your story Justice you stand up and tell you got a booming voice go ahead the better the Wildfire the no fire at all right let's pushed the gas this morning let's push the gas this morning come on power sign Hallelujah you're going to make mistakes but as long as you're on the power side there's a power that's going to raise you up hey man this car's got power in it my brother Branham left here he left a car with power it was an engine that was running it would go down to Divine Healing it would go down to miracles a lot of teachers got in they shut the engine off and they tried to drain the gas out of it but it's been restored in this day thank you you know one day I was on the way to church and I'm just driving looking into the sun all of a sudden out of the corner of my eyes I seen this snake coming out it ran out I went I said man I didn't my wife sitting there

come on the inside and change you forever sister and he didn't see you coming go home and run over that devil run over it run over I give you you got the power I don't have to give it to you it's already here run over that devil run over it you hit the gas it'll power be there you hit the gas it'll run over it it's dangerous having a drunk preacher you got to have a determination in other words you need to be decisive you need to have a purpose you need to be Resolute you need to be resolved you need to be single-minded there's only one mind that's the mind of Jesus Christ you need to be decided some of you need to make the decision I'm leaving this camp and if God allows we have another I'm not going to come back to feed it I'm going to come back Victorious you need to be set you need to be settled you need to buckle down you need to be constant you need to be Earnest you need to mean business you need to be solid strong-minded unfaltering unflinching unhesitating on wavering [Applause] that's the way God is unchangeable unshakable he ain't got the 2023 and shaking in his boots he said come on Brad just believe [Music] for God is determined let me tell you how to determine if God makes up his mind to do anything it has to be God is so determined his table will be set and somebody will be there God is determined to have tables that are full God has never changed he's just the same today as he was then God is determined to do something he'll do it nothing somebody said nothing is going to stop him [Applause] what's living on the inside of you nothing is going to stop you I'm going to just take a little turn here then we're going to come back James 1 verse 5 says any man any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God hello they give it to all men liberally and I'm brave is not and it shall be given to him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering don't forget who he is he's not to be a stranger he's to be your daddy my daddy used to have a sign on his door to his study that says nobody come in here and disturb unless you know see a deacon blah blah blah all that I never really read it never I that's how it wasn't for me because behind that door was my daddy some of you come to God a whole lot different you come begging and begging I'd have to beg my dad if I truly had a need he supplied my need you don't have to come to God begging and begging this and begging that don't become a bunch of spiritual beggars some of you are more Beggars than blind Bartimaeus was I told you well I would have said oh Lord help me Jesus let him ask in faith nothing waver for he that waverth is like a wave of the sea that's driven with wind and tossed yeah for let not let not that man think he will receive anything of the Lord because a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways yeah yeah like a wave of sea that's blown and tossed men should not think that he receive anything because he's double-minded you know it's just like a man one time had a flat tire he's out in the middle of nowhere in the dark night and his tire blows out all of a sudden he sees a light up there on the hill say I bet this old farmer he probably got a jack really Wayne I I'm gonna walk up here and get that said knock on the door at two o'clock in the morning but there's a light on the porch so he starts walking up there and he said you know what I'm gonna go ask well I'll

up his kids his wife he's a lot put a gun in my face ain't no telling what but no I need a jack and he walks up and he finally gets enough nerve to knock on the door but his mind's so messed up the man opens the door and he don't even have time to ask what he wants this man that needed to Jack looked at that man said just keep your stupid Jack that's how you do God you don't talk yourself out of before you can even give it to you you double minded what you need is a mind of Jesus Christ and realize he he's not just some foreign person or some foreign object or some God a million miles no that's my father I'm just going to open the door and go in and say father I have a need and if I have a need if I'm asking for bread he's not going to give me a stone he's gonna give me what I have need of get some Grit get some fight in you quit having an excuse so the preachers got to fight for you [Applause] you're trying to do away with preaching no I'm trying to do away with your excuse [Music] you need to have some determination I'm not going to continue in my complexes I'm not going to continue in these fears I'm not going to continue in this sin I'm an overcomer that's who I am you know Jesus he had some overcoming power in him did you know that yeah buddy I kind of like the way he acted in church the Bible says he went to the Sabbath who said went to the South to the synagogue on the Sabbath as was his custom so our father had a customer going to church so his children does too oh yeah anyhow and but when he got there he didn't just sit there with his arms folded he walked in John 2 and he saw the temple was full of oxen and sheep and doves lukewarmness formalism full of psychology and he made what he do he made him a scourge of small cords he just wove a few things together and he drove them out of the temple the sheep and The Oxen and he poured out the changer's money and he overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence and make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house has eaten me up whatever Jesus went he turned Satan's kingdom upside down [Applause] he didn't allow some formal Spirit to sit there or some lukewarmness to sit there or some he didn't allow it to stay there he grabbed some promises and he wove them together and he drove him out listen if I can just get you to get some promises this morning and wave them together and go to your bedroom and drive that devil out that's been pulling from you and costing you and pulling things out of your life and you drive him out cause something has happened I have a sick you know you need to get a little radical yeah you said well I don't know about okay you know what Zeal means it's all out it's committed it's convicted it's drastic it's extreme it's intense it's passionate it's radical it's severe the devil been severe on you you need to be severe on the devil let's go the other way you know what Zeal opposes average comfortable cautious indifferent lethargic moderate well I love water worship but I just want it in a moderate moderate way you weren't the one who built the fire normal I just want to be normal forget it you know I tell you brother brother and Olga's been my brother-in-law and mother brother-in-law Jeff you know what they had this what they called a normal list people they thought was normal and they had some people they thought and the next thing you know they're Crossing them off you know they finally had to cross their own names out you don't belong on a normal list I'm not normal go ahead it's okay to say it I'm not normal [Applause] I'll tell you what's normal today is homosexuality what's normal today is a man and woman's clothes and a woman listen you say well I just can't stand it when a man wears women clothes or women's been wearing men clothes for a long time it ain't gonna be much longer till a man comes out in women's clothing we ain't gonna think nothing about it that's gonna become normal but that ain't my normal it might be normal to you to have a quiet little service and a little time with the Lord that ain't my normal no it might be normal to you to just sit on your haunches and not do nothing and allow some Moss to grow on you that ain't my normal it might be normal to you to just allow the devil to walk in and out of your hallways and in and out of your heart that ain't my normal there's a God that's on the throne there's a God that's there and it'll take Satan take your hands off foreign don't even care about time so [Applause] a drunk don't even care about eating so if you're caring about going to get something to eat or scaring about time right now take a drink [Music] [Applause] because this ain't gonna be your normal Sunday morning service we can go through it God is a god of zeal we ain't got I am going to tell me I'm going to kind of go over some spots right quick but you can go into Hebrews and you can find in Hebrews chapter 12 there's kingdoms that can be shaken and kingdoms that cannot be shaken amen but the kingdoms that cannot be shaken will shake kingdoms that can be shaken [Applause] [Music] but the kingdoms that can be shaken cannot shape kingdoms it cannot be shook [Applause] hallelujah amen well let me just let you in on at least next little bit who's afraid this morning he said let me do your brother so let me just give you a word from my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know this gift in my life is Supernatural as a gift where uh whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and thoughts of men's heart either hidden things that only God can know and then reveal to me is I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people I saw him last night but Wayne you saw him last night the faces brother Andrew you saw him last night the faces many of you Brothers the faces of people when Satan knew no he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people I'm talking about it's this devil Satan has got a hold of their lives through sin listen to this indifference disease you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed oh my all that hollering you heard last night all them Devils just fighting they knew they were about to lose any time you see a devil start acting out it knows it's about to come out let me just drop something in right there many times we see in a prayer line or somewhere wherever a devil start acting out don't be afraid that's not the time to fear that's the time to believe and I give you that little head right there because when he starts doing that he knows his time is over he knows he's finished he knows this vessel I'm about to lose cause I've met somebody greater than I am [Applause] Satan is afraid the white direct quote he knows the spirit of God is about to let people know of his works that is why he hates these meetings so much what names are called and diseases revealed Satan hates it listen we're in the time of the the the throning of Satan when spirit of God comes into a Believer there's a commission cast that devil out if you don't believe the commission you're not a child of God after receiving the commission he gives the power to use it casting out the hold on man's life that's crippled him for years some of y'all came here crippled in your spirits for years couldn't even some of it cut him hardly raise your heads somebody come along and molested somebody coming along and done this or that gotten a little part in that you know what happens the Devil Comes it comes in strikes and if he can find a weakness I've seen him do it to young people in church problems listen Church you under got to understand the church is always pregnant she always has unborn children in her and if you do something in the wrong way you make her abort amen oh well I thought you said we're going to Rejoice we are just hang on a minute let me get down to this right here while we right there he talked about Moses after they walked out with a high hand go across he said it wasn't but a few more moments in church this church trouble started coming it wasn't only a few moments later When Trials came and the church got All Shook Up as it is so easy for a congregation to people to do something to to do when something don't just seem to happen the way it was supposed to be God brings tension into the church oh every song that cometh to God must be tried proven and tested he let sickness strike you he lets diseases come to test you and to prove who you are and to show the world you are a Seed of Abraham he permits disasters he permits friends to turn against you he permits boyfriends to break up with you and girlfriends to break up with you he permits it he permits all those things they turn the devil loose what to tempt you he said Abraham had Isaac but he had to be taken to a place to be tested takes him up on a mountain know the story he let Abraham be tested to that final point he's got to test you and me for that final moment that time of decision when everything is away from you that's what I'm trying to tell you it's a balance here because it ain't all going to be rejoicing and shouting and dancing down the streets no they're gonna be times of testing but the same God that was with you in the rejoicing is the same God in the testing hey man he led Abraham okay he lets every one of his children come he said he's standing stood alone he said what you need to do is stand alone walk out there though he slay me yet I'll trust him that's the Seed of Abraham that's the one who gave the promise no matter what the rest of them say or the rest of them do for me and my house we're going to serve God if the rest of them say there's nothing to an experience it's just a bunch of excitement for me and my house we're going to serve God I'd like to take it out with Paul right there and say the way they call heresy so worship by good god of my father [Applause] though there be titlers come in the church though there be Twisters that come in though there'll be all kinds of false prophets everything coming to the church among the people in the neighborhood but as for me in my house we're going to serve God though all of them quit coming though all of them quit coming though the church gets cold and indifferent as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord though if someone was prayed for and didn't get well and nothing happened as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord come on fathers come on Mothers amen is for
