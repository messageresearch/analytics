what a time to serve the Lord amen it's a it's a terrible time in the world but it's a tremendous time in God amen and we just want to greet each one of you it's good to have our family here with us this morning and amen Vernon Dei and Gracie came down and it's always a blessing amen when you can get your family together and fellowship around the things of the Lord and amen we're uh praying for the brothers that's on the field this morning and amen but as we're here this morning we're trusting that the Holy Spirit would have something direct to your heart amen and we're asking for a real leadership in his word this morning so if we just bow our hearts together I just asked you if you'd pray with me and let's ask the Lord to do something special this morning for a heart father we greet you this morning Lord and we thank you for your divine presence in this building Lord as your anointing swirls around the room Lord and scriptures begin to roll Lord there's an answer for hearts Lord there is a God that lives father father we hunger for thee Oh Lord we' love to see it when Lord your spirit walks down the aisles and Lord opens the heart of your children and Lord you can only fix those little intricate things that are in the heart and maybe never discussed with another human but Lord you and you alone know the secrets in the mind of a man Lord and we're asking you this morning that you would divinely Lord move through this sanctu uary touching hearts and lives Lord father maybe questions that are there and desires Lord to be able to come higher in you and we're asking that your word would unlock those doors this morning Lord and father may you allow us a higher fellowship and worship with you Lord now as we commit this meeting in thy hands Lord we ask you to take it and use it for all your glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen and amen God bless you this morning and we'd like to turn into the word of the Lord if we could I'd like to look over in the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I want to read the 13th verse Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 and 14 amen uh what a what an amazing time to serve the Lord and I'm going to pull right out of the Book of Daniel for a service I'm sorry but yesterday the Lord just spoke something directly to my heart and we're going to try our best to follow that um we're uh we're uh we like him to have the ride away amen amen and uh so I want to I wanted to speak to you from this for a few minutes this morning the book of Ephesians the first chapter we'll read the 13th verse here in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of a purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen we ask the Lord to bless his word this morning you may be seated I want to take from that phrase this morning the word of truth I just uh the Lord just spoke something real directly to me yesterday morning and uh just as just as I was thinking in prayer and just something spoke directly to me you have received the word of Truth so I want to if I can just speak to you a little bit today and maybe a statement that we have received the word of Truth amen I think it's a powerful thing uh when you take it to the scripture and begin to study it what the word of truth actually means and what it is and what it gives to an individual um I I know that in the seasons that we are living in the hour that we live truth is a very uh it's a very um sacred thing and it's often not found in very many places truth is something that's been pushed to the borders uh for the sake of whatever reason popularity politics um directions but of course it's the Spirit of the enemy that is constantly trying to bring some type of confusement or some type of maybe not an an outright lie but maybe just enough to keep someone from a positive truth and that is Satan's objective even this morning is to be sure that we don't rest on a positive truth because when people who stand on Truth they stand up on the infallible word of God then those people are actually an invisible an invincible people and they cannot be defeated by standing on the word now in the Scriptures it is beautiful to see that Jesus himself tells us amen that he is the truth many people will ask us this uh in this age we're living really what is truth what uh who has truth what is truth and Jesus himself said in John 14 he said I am the way I am the truth and I am the life amen so so the the way of God is the truth and Jesus is that way so I would easily say that Jesus is the truth that's what the truth is this morning you don't possess truth unless you possess Christ it's the only way to possess truth is to possess him you can read about him and you can read the truth but you can't actually have the truth until you receive the word of Truth in you which he is trth uh it's Jesus in John 177 he said sanctify them through Thy word for Thy word is truth so now we're seeing that the word is trueth now it it's apparent that if you believe the word then in John chapter 8 and the 32nd verse the Bible said you should know the truth and the truth shall make you free so the truth is the way it's the way of life and it's also the way of Freedom if you're going to have freedom this morning it'll because you have truth there is no Freedom outside of truth if you don't own truth then you don't have true freedom because something is always influencing your mind it's influencing the way you go uh but when you have truth then you have Liberty you have real Freedom amen Jesus is the truth and if you continue in him you will actually have a liberty like you've never known now I know sometimes we think about the world that we're living in and the little um how could I say it in the world we're living in there is so many misrepresentations of Truth uh it's not that there is so many outright lies there's just not so many people telling exact Truth uh if you would maybe watch CNN or Fox News or one of the media sources you're not going to sometimes just hear exact lies but what you're hearing is a perverted truth in other words they'll take a half a statement or they'll take a little part of statement then they'll add a content to it that's not exactly right so then you have been given a falsehood In The Name Of Truth so all of a sudden now we we kind of have to Discount our media sources as a way of absolute truth we might receive some truth but absolute truth does not come through your television sets absolute truth doesn't come through your cell phones and absolute truth does not come in any other source outside of the Vindicated word of God in this season and if a person is going to be absolutely true then they're going to have to minimize the source of what they receive as truth down to the Vindicated word amen we're in that place in that hour where it is become a moment of truth is that right and if there is a moment of truth then God has a truth for that moment and that is the season that we're living in I would like to say that I I would join Apostle Peter when he was standing on the mountain with the Lord and and he had said seen the baptism of Jesus the disciples had all knew that John had declared that there had been a baptism of Jesus and a a great light had come down and said this is my beloved Son now that was a powerful point that this is my beloved Son amen but then it comes to mount Transfiguration where only about three men were allowed to go up with Jesus in this experience and while they were standing there the Bible said that a a cloud came down out of heaven and Jesus was transfigured before them and then it said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and now when Apostle Peter was in that experience he comes back in the book of Peter in the second chapter in the first verse and he begins to write about his experience and he said amen that we have not followed cunningly devised fables but we made known unto us by the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ that we are eyewitnesses of his majesty in other words these people people like Apostle Peter was saying I was standing there when Jesus was transfigured before me amen and I'm not following some cunning devised Fable but I'm actually following truth and and he knew that he was behind exact truth it's a amazing because he said we have received from God the Father honor and glory and there came a voice from Heaven saying of the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard were with him in the Holy Mountain and we also have a more sure word of Prophecy isn't that powerful a more sure word of Prophecy now you have to ask yourself what is a more sure word of Prophecy than Isaiah saying a virgin should conceive what is a more sure word than Isaiah 9 saying Emmanuel shall be with us a son shall be given what is a more sure word is when that word of Isaiah had become flesh and was standing right in front of apostle Peter and Not only was the flesh standing there God himself was vindicating that this was amen the flesh dwelling of Isaiah 9 and Isaiah 6 and the Book of Ezekiel see the word of God had brought forth something into the flesh which bypassed all the questions of what Isaiah meant until that very hour what Isaiah meant had been a question it was a it was somewhere amen a lot of people could say Well it meant this and it meant this and it meant this but after Jesus came to the Earth to apply any other meaning to the book of Isaiah it would be sin after that it would be it would be an unbelief of the revealed word amen so God had given them exact truth or absolute truth and he said that it was a more sure word of Prophecy where un we take heed as a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and a day St arise in our hearts knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scripture is in any private interpretation isn't that powerful and it's beautiful when you really come to that reality that the scripture is of no private interpretation in other words there's no churches has a right to interpret prophecy of scripture there's no group of men that actually has a right to say this is what this means and this is what this means but God alone reserves the right to interpret scripture by making that scripture manifested in the season that it's desired to be of God and in that season then truth comes forward and Truth is the interpreted word of God how many realizes that truth is embodied it's more than just a story or just a a scripture you read but truth becomes embodied in a people and those people become the extension of Truth by manifestation just as God had seed in other ages those seed amen you you look back and you say well Noah is the seed of God or you say Moses was the seed of God well they were the seed but do you know Jesus said in the Book of Luke that the seed is the word that's the parable so those men were not only seed they were the word but they wern't the word in a Bible they were the word manifested and they were manifesting truth under the light of the age they were living other people looked at that truth and they said well you're a Luna IC or you're a heretic or you're a crazy man but they were the Fulfillment or the interpretation of the scripture in the day that they're living in oh my amen there are a people today in this hour that don't just possess truth but they have become truth amen there is a truth in this Bible but there is a truth that is living Jesus said I am the way I am the truth and I am the L and if Jesus is in you this morning he didn't he didn't leave the Bible as truth and come into you as a lie but he would testify of the word in you the same as he testifies of the word in the Bible amen I believe amen that we are written Epistles of the word of God this morning I I don't believe that we just read the word and it stays there but we become the very word that we read Our Lives become the interpretation of the scripture itself now I I know that it's a powerful question what is truth now of course you got a right to ask that question and pilate did ask that in the Book of John the 18th chapter pilate said unto themart thou a king asking Jesus are you a king he says I am a king and to this end was I born and for this cause I came into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice and pilate said unto him what is truth amen what is truth amen think of that when he had said this he went out again to the Jews and said I don't find any fault in this man I don't find any lie at all in this man he is exactly what he confesses to be he he is telling truth and and of course pilate asked what is truth and I believe there's many people today asking the same question what is truth what is truth well I don't know of any truth outside of the word of God I just have to be honest with you I do not believe amen there is any truth outside of the word of God I believe everything else has a tinge or a Twist of somebody's idea or something of man put to it do you know the Bible said to let every man's word be a lie that the word of God would stand true do you know that the only truth you'll ever know is the word of God and that truth is a powerful truth over our lives it is a truth that has been declared now you can take truth in the Bible but by the time you get it out of the Bible it can become a lie that's right that's now that's a thought isn't it amen when the word becomes a lie how does that happen when man puts an interpretation to it now I I I've I've I've read enough of the scripture to understand that scripture uh scripture if it's in the wrong place is not the truth is that right now what would you think about me if I come this morning and said we all need to go build an ark I could take Noah's t testimony that it's time to build an ark the world would be destroyed by water and I could preach that to you as the gospel and what has been the truth is not the truth and I would be telling you an absolute Lie by using the Bible and doing so because amen the word has a season and in that season then that word is exactly true for That season amen I I I find this amazing that God has to declare what is Truth by the manifestation of his word and I believe this morning brother B says it like this he said the Lord your God has declared to you what is truth the Lord has Vindicated what is truth his word and by his Spirit see not by might or by power but by my spirit see and God seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth and thy word is truth and he is Thoroughly a Vindicated that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he has showed evening seed s to you he has revealed it to you in the word he has proven it to you by his Spirit now in the Paradox of course brother Ram talks a whole lot about Superstition uh there's different places in the message and I'll just carry you to a couple of them but out in Arizona there was a superstitious mountain where uh that there was a mountain everyone was afraid of because that there was a Superstition over that come from the Indians and everybody in the area believe those superstitions so when they approach that mountain they did it with fear but the fear was coming from Superstition now brother Ram said you had to show up at certain time of the morning to see the Superstition and he said when he got there it was long before daylight and he said he brought along a little flashlight with him and when he walked up to the mountain he said see my flashlight could only cover a certain portion of the Mountain at a time he said so every let me just paraphrase it everywhere the flashlight didn't shine Superstition would dwell see Superstition can dwell in the Dark Places every place that you don't understand scripture that's where Superstition is it's in that place of misunderstanding so Superstition will hide in that place but brother Ram said instead of approaching the Superstition with my little light he said what I did was backed off a few steps and just sat down and waited for the sun to rise because when the Sun rises up it's able to show the whole picture at one time amen do you see through the age men has approached god with a flashlight and they they found the truth and they found the truth but between all those places where where they misunderstood things but this end time bride has been able to take a seat until the rising of the Sun and when the sun begin to rise Now The Sun Shines on the entire mountain and the Mystery of godliness and and faith and virtue and see that whole statue of the perfect man we're seeing what it really means to be to be a Christian to be a believer we're seeing the end time events unfolding together we are not living in an age of supers we're living in a season of perfect Faith this is a season where the devil should not have one place to get into the Church of the Living God there ought to be a people alive this morning that should say to them it's not what Paul said we will not stand on it if it's not what the prophet said we will not stand on it there should be a word bride on the Earth today that will only receive the Vindicated word of the age we're living in we're too far past it friends this is no time to get your lines Tangled Up This is no time to get tangled up in politics and ideas and superstitions and and worldly things are you with me and denominational thinking concerning end time events we know where we're going we know where we're petted we know what the Vindicated word says about this season I know there's a third world World coming but we're not going to be here for it come on Church we're not going to be here for it before the bomb hits this America there'll be a bride setting in glory that's thus saith the Lord take the Shadows off of it take the fear out of the heart of the children of God let truth set us free from the truth from the from the things that man would do to us my when I look at it this morning this should Miss message should be the end of superstitions brother BR said I think it was a old Captain he said we were on the Sea on the ocean we were floating in a boat and got out away from the land a little bit and he said they were trying to put I actually was in Oregon one time and we were with Brother Rich Cobb and we've been out in the ocean we were trying to come back to Harbor and those guys watch the tide because there's just a little bitty spot that they can run that boat in them rocks they got to power right through those rocks they can't just drift up there cuz it the the the current will make them hit the Rocks so they got to power in that little key they got to power that boat right through that so they they they catch the tide right they know when to come back and all that stuff so they get right there in that key brother BR said there was a man he said he was out there and and and a storm had come up and the fog had settled down and everybody was trying to figure out how to get back to the shore see but that old Captain was seasoned enough to know you don't try to reach Shore with this kind of condition so he just backed up and said they said well what are you going to do he said we're going to wait till the sun comes up now when the sun comes up the fog will disappear and then you can easily get in that place see but as long as it's working under fear and under darkness and under foggy places you're going to crash your boats what's going to happen but if you'll just wait till the sun rises then you're able to go into that place and I believe in the season that we're living in amen we have come under the rising of the Sun and this bride knows exactly where to go and how to move her boat amen we're not living under superstitions now as long as it's in the book brother Ram says it can be questioned but when it's been made manifest but when it's been made manifest then the product of that he said it's then the light is on the word see now the word being Vindicated is the light of the spoken word of God now the the light of the spoken word of God God said let there be light now that was a word but when the sun come into existence that was a reality of the word so if let's let's just say let's just say there's a bunch of people standing around and God said let there be light people could have run around and said God said let there be light but until the sun appeared they could have said that means this and that means this and that means this and they could have quoted him forba him but only God had the meaning of what he said and when he spoke it then the Sun come into existence you don't have to ask what that meant anymore it's right there it comes up every morning it's a part of our Lives now it is a reality see the word spoken becoming a reality takes the questions off now in the church age book brother mam will tell us something that's powerful because one one of the things that we have in this end time is we have so many people uh coming up with so many absolutes of how to know we've been saved or how do we have the Holy Ghost how how what is the what is the absolute to that what does that mean to be saved or to have it if you belong to a certain maybe a certain denomination the absolute of Salvation would have your name on the book see if you don't do what we say we'll remove your name then you've lost your fail see but now I've got a problem with that one because you can't join the church the only way to get into the body is to be born in the body see I never joined the Lawson family I was born into that family now because I was born in there whe they want me in it or not they got me amen we're we're family amen that you can't choose your family brother Richard you amen when you're born you're just born amen whether that's a royal line or whatever it is you're birthed into that family you see now you know that when a child of God is has been birthed into the family he's a child of God then by birth so that's why sometimes maybe there's disagreements or whatever but we're brothers and we're sisters amen amen no different than the the household you were born in we have a household of faith and children are born into that season now now if if we we must have an absolute of what that means to be born or to have received the Holy Ghost otherwise you you're like the wind you one day you're saved next day you're not saved one day you got it next day you ain't got it amen and if you leave that up to individuals they'll make you a whole list of dos and don'ts and and if you then usually it's particular to one group you know they have each one has a little slant on what that means you do this you ain't got it you do that you got it and you don't do that you ain't got it and they got this whole list but I I i' I've been searching this Bible a long time I ain't found that now if you got it and you can bring it to me I I'll just go ahead and take it right now we can end the we can end the arguments but you see what the problem with that is is you got to be alive before you can live for God it wouldn't have been funny for Jesus to have took a list of dos and don'ts and laid it on the tomb of Lazarus but Lazarus couldn't have did or don't do nothing as long as he was in the grave but when he was alive then there was a life in him so what is it about a bunch of dead people doing or don't doing something what does that make a difference there has to be a life inside the believer that makes a person do what they do or don't do see what it is there's got to be an Evidence of the Holy Ghost now I I'll take it to the only truth I know the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is the same as it was back in the days of our lord it's receiving the word of Truth for the day that you live in wo brother the evidence of the word is of the of the life or the Holy Ghost is receiving the word of Truth for the day you live in Jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if people got the word The Works would follow the word now the word of truth brother Ram says it like this I Know Thy works perg and age if a man fears that he might not please God let him fulfill the word of God if a man uh wonders if he will hear those words wello my good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of Truth was the criteria then and it's the Criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another Plum line as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so is it going to be judged by the word amen now of course again Perman age I want to just read this to you before we continue remember now John the Baptist prophet messenger of his day was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb he was baptized in the Jordan uh the word of God Jesus it came to him the word always comes to truly spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said I pray the father and he will send unto you another comforter and he'll abide with you even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now we know what the truth is in John 17 Thy word is true and he said you don't understand my speech because you cannot hear my word did you notice Jesus said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the word comes to you you would receive it now you can tell quickly what kind of spirit is inside an individual when the word is given to you how you respond to that word you can jump and holler you can join a church you can pay your tith you can do anything else but when the word is given to you and something inside you will not agree with that word and you got to Buck up against it and you got to push that preacher till he agrees with you there's something wrong with the spirit in that man or woman the evidence of a truly Holy Ghost filled individual is a Spirit ready to receive the Vindicated word of God when the spirit of truth comes the word is come he will guide you into all the truth he will speak the word and show you things to come if you want to know carefully that Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost with speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying shouting or dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth and you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word isn't that powerful you said well brother Wayne have you switch directions on this absolutely not I don't believe that uh I don't believe that that shouting or rejoicing or healing is an Evidence of anything other than that God still works miracles but if the person doing the shouting the believing the healing amen the Vindication of that individual is his ability to adhere to the promises of the he's living in amen you you can shout and dance and deny the word and you are just another Judas are you with me you can worship and just be another Cain somebody said well how did Cain worship read your Bible he had an acceptable excellent sacrifice but Abel's was more excellent than Cain's because it was redone with a revelation do you see what it is you can set up an altar but if you don't rightly divide the word of God then your altar comes in effective in the presence of God there is only one way to have atonement there's only one way to have forgiveness it's to come to God a provided way and that way is the way of Truth Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and outside of that truth your worship is in vain in vain do they worship me teaching for Commandments the seeds of discrepancy amen you know what I'm talking about listen to this word We Know Thy word and there is no other truth outside of that Thy word will become a reality to us today now saying you receive the Holy Ghost now watch now watch what'll happen the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen is not the way of receiving the Holy Ghost now amen isn't this powerful watch what's what's what's the foundational teaching here look how close amen look how close the scripture comes we just read to you having after that you heard after after that you have heard of the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation do you know that because of the way that's written that after you have believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise there is entire denominations that teach amen that when you believe the word you got the Holy Ghost now I'm I'm getting serious because if that was just in the Baptist Doctrine that'd be one thing but that Baptist Spirit has tried to come right over in the message of the hour and if you want to get the Holy Ghost just believe what I'm saying believe my teaching believe my understanding and you got the holy ghost that is a lie straight out of the pits of hell it is a misrepresentation of Jesus's doctrine that you must be born again and if a man is going to be born again he's got to be born again by the Water by the blood and by the spirit he's got to be baptized by the Holy Ghost and if the Holy Ghost God and bring life inside a Believer he'll have to agree with the word of God and that is the evidence of the spirit amen I I I know that old Baptist Spirit tried to creep right in you wanton the Holy Ghost just lift your hand what a what a what a what a fallacy some say well that's the one of the Mysteries of the age brother Wayne to receive the Holy Ghost without sensation and then they go directly to Mary and Mary believe the angel and receive life now I I appreciate that that's the way that Jesus Come into the womb of Mary I got that amen but that's not the way Mary got into heaven do you see the lie that's behind that the Bible said amen that Mary was in the upper room Acts chapter 2 amen she was there when the Holy Ghost came and she got just as drunk as Peter and James and John and brother brandham said if God wouldn't let Mary in heaven without getting drunk in the Holy Ghost how is he going to let you in heaven without getting drunk in the Holy Ghost that don't bring a Baptist Doctrine for life and for measurements of truth I do not believe it I will contest it it is seeds of discrepancy and it has come to rip the Church of its power and of its strength my goodness what is it Jesus never taught that nonsense Peter never taught that nonsense and I I'm using the word nonsense because I'm being nice Jesus called now listen directly Jesus was not playing he said to the devil you're a liar Jesus didn't mince words Jesus didn't go around it and said well maybe that's not exactly right he said it's a lie come on now John chapter 8 Jesus called the devil a liar straight up he said you're a liar and the father of Lies he said and the reason that people can't receive me is because they are of their father now that's the truth amen amen e either either God's your father amen or the devil's your father and as long as you're living in this Natural Life the devil fathered you it's a hybridization it's a lie that you're living in nobody got to teach you to lie you can lie before you can talk and you could you could steal amen you little bitty kids can steal and lie and cheat nobody had to tell them that because they learned it from their first parent and their first parent is a hybrid thing that the the Bible said every man born of a woman's a few days in full of trouble the nature on the inside of them's wrong they can't do right if they want to every work that you have is an Abomination or a filthiness in the sight of God so Jesus the only man that was ever born right said you got to get right by getting a new birth and God has promised the church a perfect Nature by A Perfect birth of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is no other life outside of Christ coming in Into the Heart amen now now it's a very a very timid thing because the Bible said have you received after that you have believed Now isn't that something because people say well you got it when you believed but that's not at all what the Bible says so to misinterpret the word makes the word a lie it's contrary to scripture now think of this because the scripture if you pull this up uh let's pull this up 2 Timothy Chapter 2 and let's read the 15th verse here now the Bible said that we should study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain Bings for they will increase more ungodliness and the word will as doeth a canker of whom hus and Philip philus canker that word canker in the Amplified is cancer isn't that wild and the word will eat after doth a cancer or a canker of whom hus what what that speaking of is brother Ram says cancer comes from a bruised cell remember that the body the Natural Body cancer comes from a bruised cell now there's a there's actually I was talking to sister then she helped me on this understanding but in your in your uh uh chemo your chemo like what what brother Ron would take that imuno therapy what's happening is your body won't fight cancer because it thinks it's your body so it won't actually attack it and it lets cancer grow because it don't think it's your body but chemotherapy they're giving them makes the body identify that cell broken cell as cancer so it makes it fight the thing see but without something to fight it what happens is a brw cell becomes bruised the rest of the body then is affected by that bruise and it starts putting out distorted cells into the rest of the body after a while the body can't live because of that bruise cell amen now that's exactly what things that are not scriptural do to a body of Believers amen when when one of your own gets a little distorted and they start puking out things that are not biblical amen it becomes as a caner as a cancer amen so so nobody wants to say that's a lie no nobody wants to stand up again nobody wants to be that person that calls that thing out and says that's exactly wrong amen but somebody better do it or the cancer will take over the body you see what he's saying to you and they would eat doeth a canker of whom hus and so in other words you just just hear this a couple times believe the word and you got the Holy Ghost now don't let no preachers bump that and let that go on for about five years or six and it won't be long and that'll be the standard teaching because the body will recognize it and one of its own ministers saying it nobody else is going to bump it so then it remains as a teaching and then it caners look is this do the canker of whom I mean watch the next verse here the 18th who concerning the truth of erid saying that Resurrection is already passing over through the faith of son what's that concerning the truth that a now look at that so the scripture is telling you these two men took a truth and misplaced it and made an error out of it isn't that something they truly believed in Resurrection but they took the resurrection and misplaced the resurrection and made an error out of a truth isn't it something take a great truth make an error out of that truth because they wasn't rightly dividing the truth now notice let's go back to this first portion of this I want to I want to just take this and I'll come right back but I I think this is powerful a powerful Point here uh let us study to show ourself approved I've got to come back and and pick this up I'm sorry this is too important to bypass uh let's look at this let's look at that word right there study thyself to show thyself approved that word approved in the Greek I'll spell it to you uh d o k i m o s de uh it's a Doos kind of kind of it's not absolute truth I'm going to spell it for you so you can get it look it up later it's in the Greek Lexicon Strong's number 1384 look it up for yourself it means accepted pleasing acceptable now this is a powerful point in the ancient world there was no banking system as we know of today not like paper money money was made from metal heated under liquid poured into molds and then cooled when the coins were cooled it was necessary to smooth off the edges so the coins were uh comparatively soft and course many people shaved them closely in one century more than 80 laws were PA passed in Athens to stop the practice of Shaving down the coins that were in circulation but some of the money changers were Men of Integrity who would not accept no counterfeit money they were Men of Honor who put only genuine full- weighted money into circulation such men were called uh d o k i m oos or approved so when the scripture when Paul is saying show thyself approved he's talking to Timothy now he's saying unto him these guys out here that's making these coins and there are places where you can take a counterfeit corn and they won't weigh the thing thing they'll just put it back in circulation cuz it don't matter to them they don't care to put things in circulation that's not exactly right but there were men who were approved Men of Integrity that when you brought to them a coin that was shaved see the the Shaving of those coins they could look at them coins it wouldn't show the Shaving you couldn't look at it with a natural eye and see it was shaped you actually had to weigh that coin to know that there had been any shaving done on the coin so the only way you can do it is weigh it in if you weighed the coin then you would know it's out of circulation amen but but think about this now because I I know exactly what this is saying from here because if there is going to be someone who is told by Paul to divide the word and to keep the stuff out of circulation then he was telling Timothy it's already happening Timothy it's already taking place or he wouldn't be telling him to watch the Shaving of the coins and to be sure that you don't rreach or regur itate things that have been shaved down to match doctrines of other people I tell you what you're going to have to make up your mind you're going to be a voice of God or a voice of the people you're going to be a voice of God or you're going to be a voice of ideas and the voice of others amen I I just make something clear this morning this ministry the Lord has given me ever how small or ever how big is not for anybody to use other than this message amen I will not propagate I will not prop up I will not push Doctrine of man and ideas of man amen no matter force is going to do it you can tell me I'm going to put you out do whatever you can do whatever you want amen but I will consecrate myself to the message of the hour and it's the only thing that I'm willing to speak or preach now I say that because I believe amen we're living in a season now you you you probably think well brother Wayne's crazy well I've been on the field 25 years so I think I've been tried about every which way could be tried I've heard about every Doctrine you could hear I heard it from some from very powerful men and they they put a little pressure on you if you if you just bend a little we we'll we'll give you this so we'll do this amen but if it's ever been revealed to you what truth really is there will be an unmovable Faith inside your heart amen I am of the I'm in the place right now that I would rather stand on a rock on a creek bank and preach the truth of this message and to preach in the biggest coliseums the world has to offer amen I am not in a position Amen to trade my Truth for a little bit of peace with somebody's ideas about whatever they have now now I'm I've come to a place in my life I've had it tried every which direction there's people come to me one time a great I praise God I'm just going to have to preach but gu comes to me and says to me he said well brother Wayne he said I want you to know he said there's just one God Amen brother he said but there's two Lords I said no way sir look how done it one God but there's two Lords what a lie Paul said there is one Lord one faith and one baptism now how you going to use that scripture with that idea I tell you what you're going to do you're going to bypass it you're going to bypass it not read it or not talk about it but if you study to show yourself approved now there's a lot of things I could bring as examples and I'm not going to but I think you get the point amen I I I I have to speak the things that are true and the things that are solid he said that we should study to show oursel approved nothing other words that we wouldn't be ashamed Amen in other words that we wouldn't shave down things and then repr preach them to the people amen the price of Salvation has not changed the cost of Revival has not changed the way of Truth has not changed we cannot shave this down or water this down and make this a little better a little easier to believe we can't change it for our next Generations or what it's going to be if we do not hold this word of Truth as an absolute where are we going to find one if we don't remain with the standard of this message where are we going to get one amen I tell you what it is there's people trying to change the gopost on this message yeah my goodness I don't mean to get in these things but I'm just going to preach to you it's one thing to trespass on my property it's another thing to try to build a fence in the wrong place come on church amen it's one thing somebody somebody get out and they do a little something wrong and they kind of Shame facedly said but way I know that wasn't exactly right and I'm sorry shouldn't probably done that amen I I I'm okay with that I can we can handle it we can forgive you forgive me we can go on down the street everybody's trespassed the word amen but when you start changing the property corners and you start saying that ain't wrong no more or this is wrong and that's right it ain't wrong amen there's something somewhere there got to be a surveyor somewhere and STS the old Corners back and says we're not budging off of the land that God gave us in this generation there are people sitting here today that have Stak their life on thus sayith the Lord and that's exactly where we got to stand and exactly where we'll be now the Bible said that a Workman who would study who is approved would not have any need to be ashamed brother B said the reason people are ashamed is because they're not sure of it they're not sure of it or they're embarrassed by it amen what is it they're ashamed because they're not sure what they're talking about is the truth they're not sure they've not been to the place where they can promise you without one Shadow of Doubt that that is the truth but when a man ever Goes On The Backs side of the desert and he ever meets God in that kind of way there's nothing that'll ever take it out of his life there's nothing that will ever move that man amen now I I I think of this now now we we look at this this morning if you want to read a message in 65 called seed of discrepancy brother bam says Jesus he tells a parable in Matthew 13 and talks about the seed of the swer and he says that one seed was the seed of God the other seed was the seed of the enemy he said now the seed of discrepancy is anything contrary to the word so anything contrary to the word is a discrepancy anything that's contrary to the word is a Discord among the Brethren isn't it amazing how important it is just to say what the prophet said now look at this because born to the spirit of God by the Holy Ghost and the seed word manifesting that's the genuine seed of God but the enemy can join the church and become Orthodox and a Creed but that's a discrepancy anything that interferes with the strain of genuine truth of God's word well that's powerful ain't it only a prophet can say it like that the strain of Truth anything that interferes with the strain of Truth see with the strain of genuine truth of God's word you've got to get right to interpret no man has a right to interpret God's word he promis it he does it interpretation he promised he interpretation anything contrary to God's word is a discrepancy absolutely now Judas had no real Faith he was a make-belief faith now the faith he thought that he that that was the son of God but he didn't know that was the son of God or he wouldn't have done it and a man who will compromise on the word of God being the truth he's got to make believe faith man that's that's getting tight there ain't it if you compromise on this truth that's a make believe faith if you compromise if you're in a position of compromise let's just compromise that is a make belief Faith because true faith cannot compromise because it's on the word of God see the man's word now you said well brother Wayne I don't really see how that this message it how is the word of God well now I I I tell you I can I can take you into the Bible and you you you use the Bible quite well and quote it and I think it's powerful I think this Bible is the only absolute truth in the world Amen but but the Jews will call it the Books of Moses so it was actually written by a man but the man was speaking for God so what we find then is that the man was a veil but the words he spoke was God brother brandom says it like this he said the spirit of God could form in what we called a prophet and the word of the Lord came to this man so it wasn't the Prophet The Prophet was the veil but the Word was God now the man's word won't act like that do you see that a man's word won't act like God's word will a man can say well this is going to happen and it don't happen a man could say well this is going to be this way and this is going to and it ain't that way because a man has the ability to lie or to miss it but God cannot lie so if God speaks it it's his word and it has to act exactly it has to act exactly like it was now there are people that propose that what brother randam says is is just the ideas of a man but brother maram says it like this he said I'm thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God I'm thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up it's the word of God I'm thoroughly convinced and absolutely convinced that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm C fly convinced that he's here right now again God's power to transform we are privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to get made it up it's the word of God manifested and been proven that it's right do you see what it is if it's God's word it'll Stack Up on the rest of the word it it won't break the strain of the word see to break a strain you take you as a human being when you were born you just went from Human to human both of your parents were human at least I hope they were so it has to go from Human to human you see you don't start out a cat and end up as a dog you don't start as a dog and end up as an elephant you start out as a human and become a human because it's just cell built upon on Cale when when a child is first uh first conceived it's it's just just it's just a little germ it's microscopic amen but it ain't long cell human cell on human cell begins to develop things I think one of the first thing that a baby develops is a backbone well I mean let that soak in a minute but it all forms around that right amen but but you see word cell begins to be word cell until you have a mature child it it's word to word so what you're seeing is is the message of the hour isn't something besides the word it's only building on the word word by word you see it's only a bringing to Perfection the thing that God began in the beginning it's the word of Truth absolutely straight see human being to human being and when a man is born to the spirit of God he don't inject anything into its life it's unadulterated word of God Vindicated for that hour other words when you're born again you're not going to bring a Creed into that it' be like a baby trying to bring cat life into its into its existence to develop some hybrid something but if a man is a man only man life comes into him and so is it with the Holy Ghost if you have been born again it'll be word upon word upon word look at look in the Book of James I love this in the Book of James in the first chapter in the 18th verse he said of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be kind to the first fruits of his creatures of his own will he begat us I like how One writer says it he says the father acted deliberately of a set purpose of his own will he begot us another words God deliberately did this he didn't he didn't partially do this he deliberately done this and God has by his own will begot a children of God that would stay with his words in the samna age brother brandom tells us even our even the thoughts of God are Eternal and if you can see this you'll see many things if you can see that God's thoughts are Eternal you'll see many things because before they were a word they had to be a thought and that thought was God so now when it's manifested it's the word and becomes the word of God we got we got a lot of scriptures on it I'll not talk take time to read all them but look at this he said he begat Us in the Book of James by his own will he begat us with the word of Truth he begat us with the word of Truth in Acts 17 it's Paul that says even your poets taught that we are The Offspring of God even The Poets would teach We're The Offspring of God so that the deity shouldn't be explained in Idols it should be brought into Humanity amen according to First John the Bible says as many as receive him to them he gave power to become the sons of God to them that believe upon his name which were born not of blood nor the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God see so after you have heard the word of truth then you are sealed by the spirit of promise and brought into Christ see listen I'll tell you if you're in Christ you are a new creature you have been recreated it is a new creation Now somebody said well brother Wayne what do you mean New Birth well I think it's powerful because we've not been born under Pentecost we've not been birthed under Lutheran we've not been birthed as a Wesleyan we've been birthed under the message of the hour and according to Malachi 4 that parent would be a restored word of God there is a parent of the church now there is a there's a parent and it matters who your parents are of how you act it'll influence your birth it'll influence what you do it's according to who your parents are and I believe there's a church today that has a parent of the infallible word of God now I know there's a lot of problems and I know there's a lot of situations but one thing that I know God will still bring the direct word to his church who desires that word brother mam says that when a child begins to be developed as a child is wanting to be developed the mother in the in the womb the child in the womb begins to call for things that the mother will ask for is that right and if there is a deep to desire that there's a deep to meet that if a mother says I want watermelons and pickles somewhere in this world there's watermelons and pickles and there's a father somewhere to get those watermelons and pickles amen because they want the child to be born perfectly and if that is in the natural what about in the spiritual brother man said then if there's a body somewhere that wants to come into Perfection then God will call somebody on the platform to preach absolute truth because that's the desire of the church is absolute truth not part truth not maybe truth not hope so truth but what is the absolute truth of the word of God I believe today there is an absolute truth I believe we can be born to the word of God not born of somebody's ideas or some system or some denomination but a birth amen a birth that is in the word of God Amen of his own will he has gave us a birth by the word of Truth so that we can be first fruit I love how the Amplified says it an example of what God has created and set apart to himself for a Divine Purpose that God has birthed this church for a Divine Purpose he's birthed you as an individual for a set aart Divine Purpose in other words God has got to have a second Eve God has got to birth a second Eve somebody is going to be a second Eve he said preacher what are you getting at I'm getting at that first Eve did something really wrong she lets somebody give her 99% word and 1% idea and that birth troubles the entire world today because you received something that wasn't absolutely true then that birth was distorted and came come out of that think about it this morning church we're not here to give birth to ideas of man we're not here to produce something like that it brings trouble but if we would stay absolutely with the word of God there is peace and joy and grace and mercy in the house of God my amen I believe it this morning I believe that we can be born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible be born by the word of God be born by the word of God how are you birthed by the word says amen how could you even get started unless you was the word to begin with amen how do you start unless you were God Gene to begin with how could God put word on word unless there was word to begin with but because before before you were here you were a part of him there that way he set that part of him inside you and when this word begin to be preached it could be added word to word and Life to life until there was something that built sell upon sell my I I I I I can't help it this morning I think of a people that's received the truth and the hour We're living we're not just another church where sale upon sale word upon word life upon life the very Vindicated word of the age we're living in I've read in the Bible the word but now we're looking at the word the people that's received the word has become the word the very flesh of the word of God oh my I I I I just can't hardly help it Church the election grace of God that's upon your life election Grace that made you call that lie it made you spit out that lie it made it where it couldn't stick to your life pattern oh it might have influenced you a little while somebody might have brought you a certain place for a little while but after a bit the truth began to push out the ARs and all of a sudden the seed took over in your life and when it did oh I I love how brother BR says it he said it pushes out all the other seeds because you're sealed in the womb you are sealed to the word of God and can't receive nothing else amen what are we receiving this morning we are receiving a Vindicated truth in the we're living in I've never met any other preacher I've never seen another preacher that could stand like brother random did when he got done preaching a sermon he could stand there and say if what I said is the truth then let God come and vindicate it there's not another preacher ever lived that God would come and vindicate what they said at the end of their book and now we got people thinking they can go through the books and add this way and take that way but listen church God has v indicated this message as an absolute vinding truth and we have received it we have received it with our hearts we have received it with our life which is the evidence of the Holy Ghost my you want an Evidence this morning that Satan cannot shake there's something in you that has received amen the word of Truth not a lie not a word misrepresented I I know people think sometimes I I want to take a couple places here but sometimes people think we're we're in say but the way we believe this message but can I say this this is not a cult this is not fanaticism these are men that is not ashamed to preach this because they have rightly divided the word of Truth everybody says the Bible is truth but you could take the Bible and preach alive with the Bible I'll take I I'll just take a couple places maybe you can maybe you can uh just take from this what I'm trying to say what about if you go to the Book of Genesis and you go to Genesis the 4th chapter and the Bible says there in Genesis 4 that Adam knew his wife amen and she conceived and bear forth a son Abel and then again she bear Cain and most anybody will read that and say that Adam and Eve had two children Cain and Abel amen but if you don't rightly divide that you'll accept that as the truth when it is not the truth the Bible does say the Bible does say that Eva is the mother of all living but it never said that Adam was the father of Cain matter of fact it says opposite of that and he said Cain was of that evil one is that right then Cain's father was the devil somebody said well how'd you get that well the Bible will tell you if you just read it he said preacher how you getting that well now now if something happened to you and we wanted to know what happened couldn't we ask you so when God asked Eve in Genesis 3 what happened remember CU he asked Adam he said it was the woman so the Lord looked at the woman and said what happened when he said what happened she said the serpent begal me so what did Eve say happened the serpent begal me now if you got a slithering snake on the ground talking and and and having seductive things with a woman you you're crazier than I thought you were you call me crazy and you got a slithering snake talking out of an apple tree having seduction with a woman that can have a child come on the Beast was a man without a soul he was the closest thing there was to a human being and he was on the upright and he was talking and he was seducing a Woman by misrepresenting the word but God cursed him for doing it and put him on his belly and made the dust his meat and that's why we're here today and unless a prophet would have come Church the absolute truth would have never been told on that story but this morning we have an absolute truth and we're not budging on that truth you see what I'm saying Ephesians 1 tells you a truth after you believe people put it since you believe when you believed you got it but that wasn't what the scripture said now you take that same thing go to the Book of Matthew Jesus's own words going to have a baptism right here this morning Jesus's own words said go ye unto the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost and 300 years they did exactly that they did exactly that from acts the 2 chapter the Bible said that they were every one baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but after 300 years the death of Christ they come along and I see or n of France I believe it was and they had themselves a counsel and when they had that counsel they changed that baptism and made it a trinitarian Doctrine and now when you were baptized you were baptized in the name of father in the name of son the name of Holy Ghost and you were put into the Fellowship of the church not into the body of Christ you were baptized into their Doctrine and their Fellowship you are not a Christian by that baptism come on church because they were Mis divided the word they brought you to the tree of knowledge rather than the tree of life but the tree of life has always been Revelation and God is the only one that can give Revelation and'll help a man rightly divide the word he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life Is Right In the Bible he gave you Matthew 28 he gave you Acts 2 which one one you're going to feed from now think of that because it's scripture but misrepresented you're believing in three Gods which breaks the very first commandment of God have no other God can you imagine someone using scripture to make a trinitarian God out of our god making us Heathen by nature and by faith but because of a prophet he rightly divided them that and now you sit here this morning and it's Sunday school lesson because you've received the word of Truth now it's a Sunday school sermon it's not even not even it's it's not even hardly a wow anymore over it well the greatest and Powerful most great truths that ever struck the Earth was the truth of the godhead but we have been so absorbed by it it's our nature and our thinking and we wonder why did anybody ever think anything different but a hundred years ago it was the battle it was a Battlefront you see what it was but something happened and we received we receiv received the word of Truth rightly divided word rightly divided word you you can take you could take the scripture and make it say things it don't say it's seed a discrepancy to do it sir there's three things you must not do Christ revealed in his own word you must not do it you must not misinterpret it you must not mislocate it and you must not misplace it to do so is the same sin that Eve committed in the Garden of Eden hallu it's the same sin you can paint it any way you want to you can you can prop it up you can paint it up you can try to back it up it's the seed of discrepancy the same thing if it caused that in the garden it'll cause that now it's death to do it it's separation from the word of God and anything that separates from the word do you see what we've received we have received truth oh and I think if there's any generation that's going to hold on to it I think we better hold on about to get rough it's about to get become a rough ride Church you better hold on to truth we have received we have received the word of Truth won't you stand to your feet with me I'm sorry I've I've went a lot I've got a whole lot more than I had time so I'm not finished even close but I I could pre I could preach a series on it and I don't want to do it this morning so so by the way how should these things be divided you know the beautiful thing is it's already been divided so we don't have to pick through it I I've told I've told through the years because you know hillbilly has hillbilly ways and but my granddad he was a commercial fisherman his kids and brother Vernon back here he's done running Nets and trot line only more Rivers he knows exactly what I'm talking about down south down there I know I know people don't hardly eat catfish up here but down south catfish is a delicacy them old big flatheads my grand my grandpa throwed you out of the boat for throwing one of them back Troy back in the late 70s and early 80s he was getting 250 Cent $2.50 a pound for live weight on them things and that's when people in Arkansas my goodness what they making $3 an hour so I mean that you know one of them 30 lb Flathead my goodness so we didn't get to eat Flathead it's moral the story we we ate we we ate the Buffalo we ate junk fish well they had rib bones and then you had them other fets in the back and they got they real bony like a drum or something you just bones like crazy little old bitty fine bones mom never would her let us eat them but after we got a little bit older she'd take that she take that fish and she'd break it up and she'd go through it and she'd pick out all them bones she just hadn't she just had a way that you break it if you broke it right they all come out right the same place and take all them bones and she'd just clean All Them Bones out and then she'd just give it to us and all we had to do is eat it we didn't had to figure out how to get the bone out of it all we had to do is eat it when God give you this message he took the bones out see he he divided it so that you could just consume it because it's already been divided for the church it this is the rightly divided truth God's gave it to you this morning I want to say we we we appreciate the holy spirit this morning and I pray this is speaking to somebody I I I I can't I can't help it I when I wake up the Holy Spirit speaks something to me I've learned I can I can either squelch that or I can just let the Lord speak and that's what we want to do this morning we want to just let him maybe this is speaking to your need this morning something you ever you ever wrestle with a scripture you ever wrestle with a truth you ever sit and wrestle with that truth don't wrestle with it this morning just receive it so brother way I'm having a hard time receiving it but if you got that Holy Ghost In You that nature will receive that word it'll overcome it that old that old outward man he might fuss with it a bit but it won't be long and that inner man will rise up he said you know that word's right it's about time for you to say you're sorry and repent then the Holy Spirit begin to move on you I tell you this morning friends I thank God for the truth I do I I don't know I I don't know if we have it in our capacity to show you the measure of what it means to be in possession of truth if you if you could just lift out for a moment and just take a view of the world there's little mamas this morning over there in chai India carrying little sick babies up to a up to a cow supp po they can't hardly afford an ounce of food put what little money they got to a Hindu priest wiping the ashes out of a fire and wiping it on his baby and shaving its head and wrapping it and putting it at the feet of a cow hoping praying well what about that that little mama sitting over somewhere this morning that someone has through television or news has told her that there's not a God she's accepted the idea that there's maybe if there is she don't know it's just agnostic and no where's sick baby only only only hope at all is Medical Science then Medical Science says we just don't know what to do with a child where where's that Mama going to turn where's that father going to turn that that family when the young ones taken prematurely out of the life and they're not there no more and they they don't know nothing about a theophany they don't know anything about the next life they don't understand any of the resurrection power what what you possess here this morning it's it's greater than life I I don't I don't have the ability to relay it to you but I pray God do it in his Spirit don't let go of Truth don't do it not for anybody not for any reason you lose truth you've lost it all you release that truth you lost everything so it's worth everything this morning we just bow our hearts for a moment maybe even Satan's challenging you on the truth of this message you left that devil away with that this morning biblical truths that are so solid brought in the light of God's word perfectly lines up Satan doing everything he can do to distort the mind and to disposition you come back to truth this morning submit yourself to the word of God so Lord I don't want nothing but your truth that's all I desire in my life I I just want your truth Lord I want a rightly divided absolute Tru truth in my heart father there's hearts all over this building just now maybe somebody right now even you just like to Rift your hand said B Wayne I want I want to hold truth Satan's challenging me and I want I want God to empower me this morning God bless you bless your hands give me power to hold truth Lord father Lord you know you spoke this to me and here standing in this congregation this morning Lord hearts that are saying they confirm Lord this was you I feel scattered I I don't feel I have the ability to present it Lord but father I thank you this morning above all things I thank you for truth and this God I thank you I worship you that you have set a right thought in our heart I thank you this morning that you've established an altar in this place an altar with truth Lord a rightly divided word I thank you that we understand Lord the the doctrines of this Bible and the positioning of your church in the season of this word now father I pray this morning for every IND individual under the sound of my voice father those even out on the line maybe that would hear these things father I pray that you would satisfy their heart right now that without one shadow of a doubt this is absolutely a true word and father
