After a little bit in the service, we'll also be receiving uh the offering. So remember that in a little bit we'll call the brothers and to receive the offering. Let's just all pray together. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we're at a loss for words with how thankful we are, Lord, that we saw the moving of your spirit last night, Lord. The healing, the deliverance, Lord, the touch that you gave us last night, Lord. It was just so amazing and we're just so thankful for it. Lord, our bodies may be weak this morning, but our spirit is willing. Father, we're just asking that you would just come down in the service yet once more. Father, we know that Hebrews 13:8 says that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. So Lord, we're just taking you at your word, Lord. That you're going to be the same today as you were last night. The same deliverance that was given to us last night. Lord, we're expecting that that'll be here for us this morning. Lord, we just ask that you would be with the minister as he's uh preparing himself for service, Lord. May he just be able to get himself out of the way, Lord. May he enter into the channel of the Holy Spirit, Lord. that we wouldn't be hearing from any man, but we would be hearing directly from the throne of God this morning. Lord, we come together, Lord, not necessarily just to see friends or to see familiar faces or to sing songs, but Lord, we've gathered ourselves together to grow closer to you. So, Lord, we're just asking that you would just come down, Lord. We're trying to make you welcome this morning. Be with the songs and the uh the worship. Lord, may it not just be words flowing from our lips, but may it be worship pouring out from our hearts. Father, be with each and every need. Uh Lord, there's many here that need deliverance and need healing. Lord, just touch them. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you shake the hands of those around you this morning? Ah, they're they're uh hold on hold on on the offering there. I don't know if they're ready. Everybody ready for the offering? I don't know if they I don't know if they had their pockets out yet. So, just uh I was just I was just warn I was going to give them a 10-minute warning earlier, but they're coming. I think they're coming now with the bucket. So, go ahead and we'll receive the offering at this time. We'll ask the Mavo sisters to come and sing for us also if they come up to the platform. Amen. Thank you for giving unto the Lord this morning. Did anybody get up here? [Music] Somebody covered it. All right. The sun comes up. It's a new day, dawn. It's a new day. It's time to sing.

Couple of announcements before we proceed here. Well, remember the gathering at the Mcnaldi's home. Uh there's probably information out there. You can scan the barcode or there might be something out there on the desk or ask the locals if you need an address. Remember that for the uh dinner in fellowship, you can go there after everything's been um when you're finished here. Uh please be very careful on the entrance into their home uh the driveway and the road there. Just be mindful of the other public traffic there so we don't have any uh mishaps or anything. Also this morning, um remember uh our guys and those that need to help with the chairs and the clean up around the camp and those of you that are walking around. If you see something on the ground, please clean it up. Uh we appreciate that. And then so remember those that um please some of the young people, we could use your help. they could use your help in cleaning up. Also, immediately after the dismissal of the service this morning, we'll be having baptism. I believe there's two candidates right now. Possibly two candidates. So, we thank the Lord for that [Music] down a step or so. So, just remember that. If there's any others that would be interested, just meet them. The pool is on the other side of the front large parking lot. So, that's where that is. Any of that would like to attend that baptism, they'll be doing that shortly after the dismissal of the service this morning. So, we really appreciate you all coming and putting the effort to come. I we're we're thinking about having it next year, but we don't know how much interest there is. So, is there any interest in having another one next year? [Music] Okay. All right. Okay. Nathan, what's the dates for next year? Second second week in August. &gt;&gt; 6th through the 9th. &gt;&gt; August 6th through the 9th. So remember that. 2026. Unbelievable. August 6th through the 9th. All right. So we'll meet here next year, Lord willing, for not all caught up, &gt;&gt; caught away. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. Which that would be fine with me. &gt;&gt; I'm ready this morning for a new body. &gt;&gt; Oh man. I was going to say we had a little bit too much fun, but we didn't have too much fun last night. &gt;&gt; We just had a good time in the Lord. That's that's uh that's pretty pretty much our typical services around here at home. Uh we just love the word. &gt;&gt; We love the word and the spirit responds. There's a responder inside here. And when the word comes, we just take it and feed on it and enjoy it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you love the word of God this morning? He's just given us so much revelation in this hour. We thank you. And that's what the word that's the word that's been coming this week. It's just been straight word 110%. Right out of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's all we need. That's all we need as young people. Amen. Just the straight word of God. Amen. In our hearts. And I pray you just take this fire back home and enjoy it. Enjoy it. Just be faithful. Be faithful on Sunday on midweek. Clean the carpets. Volunteer. Amen. Just just be there. &gt;&gt; Be there. Don't fill a seat, but be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's enough of that. said I wasn't going to tell nobody I couldn't keep it to myself keep it to myself I was tell You are you said I was Nobody could keep it to myself. [Music] You are started walking. I started talking. I started singing. I started shouting. [Music] Said I wasn't going to testify. I said I was going to be there. Heat. Heat. the Lord has done for me. I get joy when I think about what he's done for me. I need joy when I think about I joy when I think I joy Heat. [Applause] Heat. Please don't for Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] How many just say, "Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's the one that made it all possible. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What God has done in this generation for us, &gt;&gt; sent his word &gt;&gt; and it did not return void. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're actually I'm looking I'm looking at the manifestation of this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the prophet was here, he would see &gt;&gt; what he labored all those years for. &gt;&gt; And seeing the fruit &gt;&gt; that's come upon this young generation, &gt;&gt; not just the old generation. I want to say to you I just as an elder in 1967 the Lord came into my life and he gave me that grace and he's still giving me that grace. So it's possible people &gt;&gt; not just to have it one day &gt;&gt; but the rest of your life. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. I've been so blessed myself with the ministry of the word from brother Joshua and brother Andrew this weekend and I think if I remember my right Friday brother Josh said there's there's not a message for the older people and the message for the young people it's the same message &gt;&gt; and it does the same work for us as older people as well as he'll do it for you &gt;&gt; as a young generation. &gt;&gt; So, I've just been blessed to hear the maturity of the word coming forth because I believe this is a season we're at. &gt;&gt; I think it's harvest time. Don't you? &gt;&gt; How many agree with me? It's harvest time. &gt;&gt; Praise. So, as the word goes forth this morning, still isn't over. &gt;&gt; Got another service. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody needs something yet. &gt;&gt; But God is faithful. &gt;&gt; Let's sing as brother Joshua comes this morning to brother Joshua Bennett ministers the word of God. Let's sing. He is Lord. He is Lord. He is the Lord. He is Lord. Make him your Lord this morning. Whatever you have need of him. Oh, he has risen from the dead and he is Lord. [Music] Every sh [Music] comes [Music] that Jesus [Music] Christ is Lord. Yes, he is Lord. He is Lord. He has risen from the dead. He shall come. Jesus Christ. Can we just lift our hands? Just sing it to him now. Sing it this way. He's my Lord. Oh, he's my He has risen from the dead. And he Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Lord Jesus, Lord, truly you are our Lord. And Lord, we know there's a day coming when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess. But Lord, we want to confess right now. You're our Lord. &gt;&gt; You're the King of our hearts. Oh God, we're so grateful and thankful, Lord, to be in your presence. And Lord, as I was just thinking this morning about the ministry and the different ones that's had a part and and Lord, you just want to thank everybody. You want to show your gratitude to because all the efforts that's been made and sacrifices and but Lord, we don't want to forget to thank you. Lord, I think about the lepers that was healed and there was 10 of them, I believe, but one returned to give thanks. Lord, I want to be that one this morning is I want to come and just say thank you, Lord. Lord, we're so thankful, God, for the the different things that's been made possible this weekend and and and the ministers and the pastors and the support and and all the counselors and those that labored. Lord, we're so grateful in our hearts for all that they've done. But Lord, we're so thankful, Lord, that you've come by this way. Lord, because we know, Lord, that that's what's made the difference in these in these services. And Lord, we're just asking that you'd just come one more time. Lord, at the closing of this meeting, God, I pray, Lord, that you may your Holy Spirit just come. And Lord, I pray God that there would be something that just settle down into every heart of every young person in this building. Lord, that they would take it home with them and a and the blaze of fire that's burning in their in their soul now. I pray God, Lord, that they would feed that with the word of God and through prayer. And Lord, I pray God that it would burn, Lord. And it would it it would just Lord be something that would carry them through all the days of their life, all the way, Lord, to your soon return. I pray that you would grant it, Lord. Lord, we just ask God that you would just have your way, Lord. We give you the preeminence now. And Lord, we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. And if you take your Bibles, we'll turn into the book of Daniel. I'd like to turn to the ninth chapter of the book of Daniel. And we certainly are honored to uh stand here once again and and um we uh sure appreciate all the different ministers and uh that's come and to support the meetings and and uh my what could we say about brother Andrew and his ministry and what a blessing that he is to the bride of Christ and amen just uh uh you know uh uh you young people are blessed to have uh ministers like brother Andrew Glover that can just uh you know and he he uh he gets right down with you and and I I watch how he does you know he he'll he'll he'll be out here talking to the you know he don't just come preach to you he he uh he talks with you and and uh shares experiences with you and I I tell you it's a real special thing and we sure appreciate our brother and amen just um you know uh from brother Ray to brother Wayne brother Nathan brother Ronnie, all all the brothers that's uh had a part in this and and give us an invitation to come. I just feel real honored to be able to stand here and I just want to say this. I don't know if it's really um I I I know that, you know, we we don't want to be prideful, but um uh so I hope you don't take it the wrong way, but I'm just proud of the young people of this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, you can say a lot of things and a lot of people have a lot of criticisms, but &gt;&gt; I want to I want to tell you young people, I'm proud of the young people. This is what the message of the hour produces. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well Josh, they ain't perfect." I know, but hey, hey, Amen. I tell you what, I'd put this group of young people up against any group of young people on the planet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you know what? By the grace of God, Amen. We will prevail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure love you this morning. Daniel chapter nine, I'll read from the first verse. And you pray for my voice. I I I'm about it's about all gone, but Amen. I I know his grace is sufficient. Amen. In the first year of Darius, a son of a hazarus of the seed of the Mes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldans. In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem. and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fastings and sackcloth and ashes. I want to drop down to verse 20. And while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplications before the Lord my God, for the holy mountain of my God, yay, whilst I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I'd seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touch me about the time of the evening oblation or the evening sacrifice. and he informed me and talked with me and said, "Oh Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding." And at the beginning of thy supplications, the commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee, for thou are greatly beloved. Therefore, understand the matter, &gt;&gt; and consider the vision. &gt;&gt; May God add his blessings as you're seated this morning. I want to u just take for a few minutes and the Lord would help us maybe give you a little something to take home with you. And um I I want to speak on while I was praying and you can see in these verses of scripture that there is an angel, the angel Gabriel is coming to Daniel the prophet and he's coming while Daniel is in prayer. Now, there's something that has put Daniel in desperation. And and the Bible says that he understood by the books. He was actually reading the prophecies of Jeremiah. And as he was reading the prophecies of of Jeremiah, there was an understanding that came to him that he began to realize the day that he was living in. And he began to realize that, you know, that the time of deliverance had come. And Daniel got desperate before God. And the scripture says that he be to pray and Amen. He set his face to pray. Amen. And and the prophet of God said, "Oh God, if there was ever a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray is now. For we as his true servants, we see by the letters of the apostles, by the warnings of the Holy Spirit that we're in the last days." How many can agree with that? Amen. And I believe that if there was ever a time for the people of God to get desperate, it's right now. You know, sometimes I believe people get the wrong idea of desperation. You know, Brother Brown preaches a message, desperation, and a and he shows that a lot of times it takes uh uh you know, circumstances and bad things and and troubles to really bring out desperation. But but don't forget, he said it ought not to be that way. Amen. And this is what the prophet said. He said after the message that was preached this morning, which was the token, he said it ought to throw the entire church into desperation. I believe that when the word begins to come forth and you begin to realize the day that you're living in, it ought to make us desperate before God because we realize, amen, that we are living in the hour of the coming of the Lord. This is a time that a rapture is going to come and amen. Listen, friends, tribulation is getting ready to strike the the world. But but but we're not going into tribulation. Amen. Because we know we're going in a rapture. Amen. A but but our hearts has got to be desperate. Now, you know, I think about this, and I I don't want to get carried away in this part of it, but but I will say this. It's amazing to me that Daniel understood by the books. He understood by prophecy, amen, that the 70 years was accomplished and that God was getting ready to h bring uh uh the the Jews out of Babylon and restore Jerusalem. That's getting ready to happen by prophecy. He understood that. Amen. But Daniel didn't just sit back and say, "Well, you know, the prophet said it and God's going to do it and you know, and I I you know, I just might as well just relax and just just watch it play out." No. Daniel got desperate before God and he be to pray because Daniel knew that his prayer had something to do with it. Daniel Daniel also knew, listen, I know the time I'm living in, but I want to know how what that means to me. Amen. I want to know what the part I'm going to play in this. Listen to me, young people. It's one thing to know you're living in the end time, but it's another thing altogether to have an understanding of the hour that you're living in and know what it means to you as an individual. You got something to do with this. Amen. You got a part to play in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Daniel begin to pray. Now, Brother Baron would say about prayer. Amen. And I think this is s such a beautiful thing because I I I I believe that Amen. If I if God has done something for you in these meetings, I believe that there's something very important, a key that the prophet gives to us for you to keep living in a a an overcoming life. Amen. I It's very simple instructions, but but nevertheless, it's powerful because brother Brown said, "Read your Bible and pray every day." That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen what the prophet said. He said, "What what man calls great, God calls foolish. And what man calls foolish, God calls great. So we've got to do the what we got to do is get back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do as only way I know to do it is prayer. Prayer is the key. That's the answer. Prayer changes things. Prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings. There's no atomic bomb. There's no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer. Amen. And the prophet of God said in one place he said the atomic bomb is not the most powerful weapon upon the earth today. He said a believer in contact with his maker. It's the most powerful force. Amen. That is on the planet today. Amen. He goes on to say, well the scripture I believe someplace says that devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees. Ain't that powerful? Amen. You ain't got to be the the pastor to make hell tremble. Amen. You ain't got to be an evangelist to make hell tremble. Amen. The weakest of Christians when they begin to pray. Amen. Demons begin to tremble. You see what prayer does? The prophet of God said prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man. It's bringing man up to God. See, as you pray, you lose sight of these earthly things. Amen. and and you sway out into somewhere else way beyond on and on until you come into his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. James chapter 5. Amen. In verse 13, the Bible says, "Is any if any among you is afflicted, let him pray. Is any merry, let him sing songs. Is any sick among you? Let him call the elders of the church and let them pray over him, anointing with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick. &gt;&gt; And the Lord shall raise him up, and if he's committed sin, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another, and pray for one for another that you may be healed. Amen. Listen now. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. And then he says Eli Elias or Elijah was a man subject to lack passions as we are. And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not for on the earth by the space of 3 years and 6 months. He prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit. Brother Bram said Elijah was not an angel. He was a man and he had his ups and downs. He had his troubles like we do. He had his passions. The Bible said he was a man with like passions. subject to passions as we are. He was just as apt to make a mistake as you are or I am. He's just as apt to do something wrong as you are or I am. Amen. I I just feel to stop here and say something cuz I I you know uh the devil's come along now and he and he wants to uh point out all the mistakes of our prophet and he wants to just show you every every mistake brother Ben Brandon made and and and you know what but I to me to a real believer I believe that's backfired on the enemy cuz I tell you amen if you come to tell me that William Brandon was a man I already knew that. Amen. But I tell you what, every time you show me a mistake he made, it gives me more faith. Amen. Because I just look at it like this. If God could take a man like that with all them failures that made all them mistakes and do what he did in his life, there's hope for me too, brother. If God can use a man like Elijah with his ups and his downs. Amen. He listen, he can use you. He was just a man. &gt;&gt; He was just as apt to make a mistake as you are. But he earnestly prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen what the prophet said. He said, "And God listen to a mortal's prayer." And I say this with all true reverence. There's not another force on the earth. There's nothing on the earth, no matter what it is, what kind of gift it is. There is nothing in the world that will come ahead of prayer. Prayer is what does the work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, as Daniel began to pray, and I I I again, I don't want to spend a lot of time cuz I got some things I'd really like to share with you, but as Daniel began to pray, the Bible says he made his confession. &gt;&gt; I think it's pretty amazing because when Daniel begins to pray, you know, I I I look in the scriptures sometimes and some of the prayers that are recorded in the Bible, I believe that they're wrote in the and they're recorded in the scripture. Amen. For our benefit. Amen. I if if God thought so much of a prayer that he had it recorded in the scripture, then there's got to be something in that for our benefit. You know, a lot of times we call we we Jesus the disciples come to Jesus said, "Teach us to pray." And we call that the Lord's prayer. Really wasn't the Lord's prayer as much as it is our prayer, but Amen. But the prophet called it a model prayer. So Jesus was just giving us amen prayer to to to model our prayers after. Amen. And you'll find out, amen, that when Jesus, amen, be to teach us to pray, he said, when you pray, pray on this wise. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Amen. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Amen. Amen. He said, forgive us. Amen. Amen. So you see, Amen. Jesus is telling you that when you approach God, Amen. You want to first of all let him know how great he is. You see this in Daniel's prayer. Amen. As Daniel started praying, he said he he said unto the Lord my God. Amen. He said, "I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said,"Oh Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant of mercy to them that love him, to them that keeps his commandments." Amen. In the next verse, he said, "We have sinned." Now, &gt;&gt; I want you to catch something here because, Amen. When Daniel was taken captive into Babylon, he was just a teenager. He was just a young boy. Amen. A and they were in Babylon because of the sin of Israel. But Daniel never stood there and said they sinned. &gt;&gt; He said we sinned. &gt;&gt; Tell you something, friends. Amen. When you get ready to make a confession before God, Amen. Listen, I'll just say it to you this way. They prayers and them prayers don't go nowhere. when it's always they and them and somebody else. Amen. But now when you start praying like this, it's me. &gt;&gt; We Amen. Listen, you could argue the point that Daniel didn't have nothing to do with the sin of Israel and the reason of their captivity. But when Daniel got ready to pray, he said, "We have sinned." He didn't stand there and make excuse. He didn't stand there, Amen. and try to amen make all kind of excuses for Amen. while they were there. Amen. And the reason that they have come short, but Daniel just said, "We come short. We have sinned." &gt;&gt; I tell you, I tell you like this is I I read a story and uh and they said there was a back in the 50s. They said there was this sister in a meeting and she stood up and she said, "Pastor, pray for me that I would love the people of God more." And she and the pastor said, "Sister, anybody could say that." I mean, you know, most I think about, man, them old rugged men of God, they just, you know, she he knew she didn't really mean business cuz she was just saying she was making a half-hearted confession. I'm lacking something. But she put it in a way that I already love people. I just want to love them more. So he said, "Anybody can say that." And after a while, she stood up again. She said, "Pastor," she said, "my sharp tongue has caused all kind of trouble in this church." He looked over at the deacon. He said, "Now she's talking." That's real confession right there. Oh, now she's talking. Amen. Listen, Ren, when you get to business with God, Amen. you start really confessing him. You won't be just come and say, "Oh, Lord, if I've done anything, if I failed you." No, you'll be saying, "Lord, forgive me. I come up short. I'm a sinner." Amen. I I failed you. Amen. But I believe your grace. There's a power in you. Listen. I ain't got the ability. I don't have the strength, but I believe your grace is sufficient for me. And Daniel was praying and make his his confession. Amen. And I think it's just beautiful because as Daniel, you can read it when you get home. Daniel, Amen, begin to confess before God. And Daniel comes towards the end of that prayer. He said, "Now therefore, oh God, hear the prayer of thy servant." Amen. In his supplication and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary. Amen. That is desolate for the Lord's sake. Amen. I love Daniel's prayer. I love his desire. Amen. Listen, friends. Daniel could have prayed for a lot of things and and and there was a lot of things that Israel needed at that point. Them them them Jews that were in captivity, they needed Daniel could have got Amen. He could have, you know, went through a whole list of things that the church needed. But Daniel knew, amen, if the face of God would shine upon them that every need they had would be supplied. I tell you, it's just something long like this. Amen. You got a a sick baby. Amen. You could write, you could you could tell, you could speak to, you know, 10 or 12 things that that baby needs, but you can wrap it all up in this, that baby needs this mama. Cuz if that baby ever gets this mama, amen, every one of them needs it has will be met. Cuz that mama ain't going to rest until that baby, Amen, the needs of that baby is supplied. And I tell you this, there's a lot of things the church needs. There's a lot of thing you need. There's a lot of things our youth need, but it can all be wrapped up in this this morning. What we need is God. What we need is a touch from the master. [Music] &gt;&gt; Daniel is praying with understanding friends. Now I want to come to my point now. He says, "Oh Lord," he said, "forgive and hearken." Listen what the brother would say. You see his prayer? He made his confession of his people, a confession of himself. He wanted to be sure that he found out when they were to go back because he wanted to get the people ready to go back. And what I'm trying to do is find out when we're going up &gt;&gt; and get the people ready to go up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we've set our face to God through prayers and supplication to find out, Lord, what is the hour that we're living in? Amen. &gt;&gt; And while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God, the holy mountain of my God, yay. While I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I've seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touch me. Amen. Amen. While Daniel was praying, the answer was coming. Listen friends, I tell you this. Sometimes, Amen. the answer is already on the way before you ever pray. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the answer is already here before you ever pray. Amen. Listen, friends. My Bible says, Amen, that our father knows the things we have need of before we ever ask it. And sometimes while you're praying, there's an immediate answer. Sometimes the answer was there all along and you just didn't know it. Can you say amen? Amen. But I tell you what, there's other times that you pray and pray and there seems to be no answer. &gt;&gt; So what are you going to do then? What will you do if the answer don't come when you pray? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm encouraging with this cuz maybe somebody come through the prayer line last night and you say, "Well, I come but I don't feel no different. I didn't feel nothing." Amen. Well, what are you going to do? You're just going to say, "Well, there wasn't nothing to it." Amen. I guess God didn't hear my prayer. Amen. Well, we got another example in the book of Daniel. Amen. The Bible said he prayed for 3 weeks, 21 days, he prayed and sought the Lord. Amen. Amen. And on the 21st day, Amen. Gabriel came to him and said, "Daniel, I heard your Amen. Your prayer was heard from the first day you prayed it. But there was a war going on." Hallelujah. There was a battle going on in another realm. Amen. But Michael came by my side. Hallelujah. Amen. Listen to me, church. I want to tell you. Listen, young people. Amen. You might have prayed and maybe you didn't feel nothing, but just keep holding on. I can tell you something. With the assurity of the word this word, the answer is on the way. Hallelujah. Amen. And even right now, Amen. There's a battle that's raging. Hallelujah. But Michael the great warrior. Amen. He'll clear the way. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, brother Ram said. He said, "When God does says anything, it has to take place." So when you meet God's qualifications, you just remember God will manifest himself and take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; You just go ahead. It's a finished work. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ain't that wonderful?" Well, just think. Amen. You just tell God and say, "Well, you you you do this and I'll do this." Well, I I if I go and do this, then in other words, what brother Brown was saying, if you meet the qualifications of God's word, God's obligated to do his part. &gt;&gt; He said God has to do that. &gt;&gt; Now, the devil will say he delays. That don't make any difference. &gt;&gt; See how you see how the enemy works? Some if something don't happen immediate, &gt;&gt; then the enem is right there &gt;&gt; to discourage. &gt;&gt; He said, "That don't make no difference." &gt;&gt; Daniel prayed, &gt;&gt; Amen. 21 days before the angel ever got to him. But he wasn't discouraged. &gt;&gt; He knowed it would come anyhow. &gt;&gt; He just waited till he got there. That's right. Amen. That's when you're getting faith. Don't get discouraged. Just wait until it gets there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. And Amen. cuz I I I I'm right where I want to be right now. So, Daniel said, "And while I was speaking, while I was praying, the man Gabriel come." You know, I was thinking about this the other day, and I thought this section of the book of Daniel could be titled, "How the angel came to me. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; I And you know people, we hear about how the angel comes to brother Brandham and he describes him as a man. &gt;&gt; Well, Daniel said the man, he called him a man, &gt;&gt; Gabriel. Amen. He's talking about an angel coming to him. Amen. He's coming like a man. Now, I just want to say this now. None of us has got the ministry of a prophet. We're not going to have that kind of experience. Amen. But I do believe that angels can come to the church. Angels can come to a believer. Amen. Hebrews 1:13. Amen. But which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies enemies thy foottool? Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them who are the heirs of salvation? Listen what brother saying. God still has angels. Amen. They visit people. Not the worship of angels but angelic beings. Amen. Who are attributes of God sent forth to minister to the church. Amen. Through the people. Amen. And brother Brown would talk about Zachcharias and Elizabeth and how that Amen. Gabriel came amen to their and visited them visited them. He said you know why? He said they were them good Christian people amen that believe God. He said they had a house amen that an angel could come to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said you know why I think today the reason we don't have no more angelic visitations than we do. Amen. We who call ourselves Christians play cards half the night. Amen. Read true story magazines. Amen. Got beer in the ice box. Amen. Listen, that's the reason angels don't visit us. You can't mix oil and water. Oh, I love what the brother I'm just an oldfashioned sassifr Holy Ghost secondb born preacher. And I believe in an oldfashioned cornbread. Amen. Sauerkraut potatoes. Amen. Amen. It ain't ice cream, but it'll stick to your ribs and carry you through. I believe in an old time Holy Ghost salvation that cleanses a man's heart. Hallelujah. He said, "That's all I got to say about." I tell you what, you want to see the supernatural back in your home? Amen. Clean the shelves off. Amen. You want to see God in your life? Clean out your playlist. Clean up your cell phone. Amen. Come on, church. Amen. You want to see angels come back in the church. Amen. Let's clean the church out from the pullpit to the back door. Let's get back to an oldfashioned Holy Ghost sky blue sinkilling saint. Power revival. Brother, you get down, you'll begin to see supernatural visitations. It's amazing to me because when the when the when the angel came to Daniel, he found him in desperation and prayer. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people wonder, well, you know, I just don't I just can't I I I don't know why I can't live an overcoming life. I don't know why, you know, not I'm not trying to beat you up. Not at all. Amen. But I tell you this, you can't feed on the things of the world all the time. and expect to live an overcoming life. &gt;&gt; You want to have a testimony like Daniel, get back in the book. You want to see Listen, I'll show you where his revival started while he was down there in Babylon. He was reading the books of Jeremiah. Oh, come on, church. Amen. I'll tell you what. You want to have a revival? Amen. Get them tapes out. Amen. Get your Amen. Get that table app on your phone and start listening to the message of the hour, brother. It'll bring an understanding to you, too. Amen. And get a desperation in your heart. [Applause] You get people praying in the pews and a preacher praying in his office, you're going to hear from heaven, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like I I feel good right now. And I just going to say something. Listen, friends. We Amen. We've heard a lot of good sermons and good preaching. It's got to be more than that. I say we need some men of God back in the pull pit that's prayed through, that's found the will of God. Amen. That's found even the message for that need in that moment. We ain't here to entertain. This is not entertainment. [Music] We're trying to find out when we're going up and get you ready. Hallelujah. Come on, church. And I tell you what, I might as well preach. Amen. Cuz I tell you, Amen. There's people sit around in church and complain all the time. &gt;&gt; I wish the song leader would sing something different. And I I wish they wouldn't sing that song. They sung it last week. And then the preacher comes back and said, "Why don't he ever preach on the seven seals or on the other hand? Why don't he ever preach on the Holy Ghost?" And they just don't preach on and You want your pastor to preach something different, pray. &gt;&gt; Stop complaining and pray. I tell you what, if you need to hear from God and you get desperate and you start praying, God can take a man completely off his notes and bring him right to your address. I say, "Oh God," Amen. Give us some mamas and daddies, amen, that pray. Give us some preachers that pray. Give us some young people that pray. &gt;&gt; And while Daniel was praying, &gt;&gt; there's all kind of examples of this in the scripture. I I'm going to go through a few of them right quick, &gt;&gt; but there's a man one time by the name of Cornelius, a gentile, &gt;&gt; and the Bible says that he prayed all to God always [Applause] &gt;&gt; and he saw a vision while he was praying. God come to him. A message come to Cornelius and said, "Your prayers and your arms has reached unto God as a memorial." And he said, "You take men and send them down to and you find a man by by the name of Peter and tell and get him to come." And the next morning, while them men was on the way down there to get Peter, Peter went up, Amen. that afternoon on the on the on the rooftop. Amen. To begin to pray, Amen. And while Peter was praying, a vision broke out. Amen. And God be to show Peter a vision. Amen. Of a beast, Amen. Because Peter was in hunger. Amen. And he saw one of them beasts that they weren't allowed to eat. And and and the and the and the an instruction came to rise, kill, and eat. And Peter said, "Oh, not so, Lord. I I never touch anything like that." Amen. But what he didn't understand is there's a man, a gentile that they thought was unclean, but his prayer had reached to heaven. Oh, I could preach on out a little while. Amen. Listen friends, you might think, Amen. You might look at somebody and think they just too far gone and there ain't no hope for them. But I tell you this, amen. It be good for us to hear the same message Peter heard. Don't you never call something unclean that the Holy Ghost has cleansed. Hallelujah. Some of you young people might have come here dirty, but brother, you've been washed in the washing of the water of the word. And when the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses the heart, what God cleans is clean. The point I'm trying to make is this. Cornelius was praying and God came. Now at the same time he was working on the other end. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The end of that story is this. Amen. Peter went down there to the house of Cornelius and while he be to preach, the Bible says while he yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them. Come on, church. Showing us the way for the Gentile to receive. Listen, I want to tell you something. You might be sitting here this morning think, well, I missed my opportunity. Saturday night is gone. There ain't no more prayer line. But listen, I got some good news for you. If you got a need this morning, even while the word is going forth, you can receive healing and salvation and the Holy Ghost. You don't even have to have somebody lay hands on you. The the power is in the word. You just start praying right now and see if the same God of this Bible is not the same yesterday, today, and forever. If he did it for Cornelius, he'll do it for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Think about this &gt;&gt; because a little bit later in the book of Acts, Peter's thrown into prison. And Peter was kept in the prison. But the Bible says, "But prayer was continually offered." &gt;&gt; And while Peter was down there in prison, there was having a prayer meeting at John Mark's house. &gt;&gt; And while they were praying, &gt;&gt; an angel come into prison &gt;&gt; woke Peter up and said, "Come follow me. You know what? Amen. And they're down there praying at John Mark's house and all of a sudden there's a knock on the door. &gt;&gt; And there's a little girl went out there and looked out the window at the door. She come back and said, "Hey, Peter's standing at the door." &gt;&gt; And they said, "It can't be." &gt;&gt; No, you're mistaken. It can't be. I I think that story is amazing. &gt;&gt; They're praying for Peter's deliverance. The answer is knocking on the door. A little girl. Oh, you can you can say everything you want to say about that little girl, but I tell you what. Amen. She had enough faith to go look out the window and tell them the answer that you're looking for and standing out the door. Oh, come on. Some of them other people so caught up in tradition and everything else, they thought, "Ain't no way. Couldn't be." Amen. We've been praying for Oh, come on, church. How many times this church is praying for a revival and the answer comes knocking on the door? Thank God we got some young people [Applause] that's got enough faith to at least go look and say, "Hey, what y'all praying for is here." [Applause] This ain't no ghost. This ain't no work up. This is a revival. This is the answer to the prayer. Hallelujah. I say let one of these young people, you come back to your church and just open up the door and let the answer come walking in. Hallelujah. I say open up the door this morning. Say, "Hey, we've been praying. We've been praying for a move of God. We've been praying for deliverance, but I believe that the answer has come in True Word Tabernacle Camp. It's knocking at the door. [Music] Hallelujah. My goodness. I could I I I could preach all day, example after example after example. while I just got to study it while I prayed, &gt;&gt; while he was praying, while they prayed, while I mean, just every which way I could put it. And you'll find out that God comes on the scene when people start praying. &gt;&gt; One of the most powerful things I found is brother Brown talking about Samson. And he said, "Here Samson was in a defeated. &gt;&gt; He'd been he'd been, you know, deceived by Delilah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Brown types that with the church, deceived church by the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. He had been deceived. His he his his uh the locks of his hair, a sign of his covenant was cut off. His eyes was put out. He's standing there in that condition. Amen. And here they are celebrating a victory over a Jehovah's servant. Brother B said, "But what they forgot?" They were looking at a defeated man standing there in shame. He said, "But they forgot to watch. They forgot to realize that the locks of his hair started growing back out again. They didn't see the tears coming out of them dry sockets. Oh, hallelujah. They didn't see his lips begin to quiver and words begin to come out. And Sans begin to say, "Lord, I'm a failure." Amen. I'm a failure. I I failed you, Lord. Amen. But Sensson all the time was feeling them locks growing again. And I can hear as brother Nathan said last night for the final kill. I can hear a quote of the prophet. He said, "Amen." There's a new shock of hair that's growing out. Come on. I believe that some of these young people are a part of that new shock of hell. Boy, is there a session in the building this morning? Do you feel the rocks going? Do you feel it on your shoulder? Hallelujah. And the tears begin to fall. Even the words begin to come. Oh God, is there a possibility? Could you move one more time? Just once more, Lord. Just once more. Let me tell you something, friends. We don't just have a possibility. We have a promise this morning. You have a promise. The revival is not over. It ain't behind us. We are not looking back. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Oh my," he said, "And while he was praying, while he was praying," Amen. and making his honest confession, every fiber in his body begin to vibrate. Oh God, if the body of Jesus Christ could just stand as one, every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with a literal baptism of the Holy Ghost again. Amen. Not new members, not in shaking hands or some kind of creed, but when the body of Christ could stand like Samson. Church, I tell you, Amen. I ain't just trying to excite you. Amen. Because I tell you what, Samson had to be really had to be ready to pay the price for that revival. [Applause] Samson had to get to a place that he was willing to die with his enemy. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, young people, until you're ready to die with that enemy, you will not see the victory. Come on. You can't walk through a prayer line and defeat lust until you're ready to die with it. You got to die with that enemy. The desire has got to die. But when we get some substance that's ready to die with the enemy, then the testimony will be this. He defeated more in the end than he ever did in the beginning. Listen, even even even our Lord standing I'm just trying to move through it and I'm coming to something. But &gt;&gt; even our Lord standing in the garden of Gethsemane, probably one of the greatest examples I could give of of an angel coming in prayer. &gt;&gt; Jesus is standing there under the the the weight of the world, the sins of the world upon him. the a great burden that he was under. Sweat become his blood. He's praying a prayer. Oh God, he said, Lord, let this if there's any way, let the cup pass. He said, nevertheless, not thy will &gt;&gt; but thine be done. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And an angel came to him and strengthened him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; Even he prayed Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's all through the scripture, friends. What about in our day? &gt;&gt; I tell you, I I I would not have time. &gt;&gt; I just would not have time. &gt;&gt; I just want to take just a few examples. You know, Brother Brand, one thing stood out to me. I was reading the other day, Brother Bram said he was in a meeting and he's praying. He said one of the first cases come up on the platform was a boy. He said he began to pray and he said and while I was praying for the boy, he said a light be to be get real bright and he said I thought the custodian or somebody had turned the lights up. He said and he said and I was just praying for the uh the young boy. He said he this crippled boy and he said that light just kept getting he said so I looked and he said and I seen he said this great light coming down. He said it was the morning star &gt;&gt; coming down. He said just hovered right over He said, "I don't know." He said, "I don't know if I dropped the the the child or or what just happened." He said, "But when he hit the floor, he took off running." He said, "By that time, the mother of the boy started screaming." Come on, friends. You can criticize all the screaming and all that. Amen. But I tell you, the prophet said it happened in his meetings, too. While they were praying, Amen. And and the morning star came. Amen. And a crippled boy was healed. The mother began to scream. She fainted on the floor. And brother Brown said, "And while that was happening, there's a little Nazarene girl playing the piano." Amen. And she got so excited, she jumped to her feet, lifted up her hands. He said, "And the spirit of God," Amen. just continued to play the keys of the piano. The great physician now is here, the sympathizing Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. The Holy Ghost come at me. Amen. The music begin to play. Oh. Amen. What brought that down? a man praying, a man standing in his position, knowing the authority he had as a son of God, and he be to pray. Another place, brother was talking about, Amen. He was talking about how that he was standing out there, and he said he'd been on on the on the porch and he he said his daddy was on his heart and he was praying for his daddy. He said, "Lord, don't let my daddy be lost." He's praying for his soul. Yeah. And while he was praying, brother B said, while I was praying, he said, I looked towards the east and a vision broke. He said, and you know many of you know what it was. He said it was the Lord Jesus. And the Lord Jesus come to him. Amen. While he was in prayer, Amen. And he seen that man. He said, standing out there in that broom say spilled. Amen. And he was hovering just above. Amen. And he said he cleared his throat and he pinched himself. He done all these things. He said, but after a while, he got the courage up. He said, "Jesus," he said, "and he turned and looked at me." Amen. He said, "When I woke up," he said, "my my my my pajama shirt was completely soaking wet." Amen. Under the under the power of that vision, just one look from him and it changed him. He said, "I'll never be the same." Hallelujah. And I want to tell you, Amen. If you want to see Jesus, if you pray like he prayed, you can see him, too. Hallelujah. And he'll change your life. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's standing up in Canyon. &gt;&gt; We tell it all the time. The sword come in his hand. But you know what that prophet was doing when that sword come in his hand? He was standing there with his hands lifted to heaven praying to God, "What must I do? Lord, what must I do? Well, God, give me. He was praying to God and he said, "And something struck my hand. The word came to the prophet while he was in prayer." Come on, church. Listen to me, young people. Don't you never fail to get this point? Amen. You want an understanding of this message? Pray. You can't read Revelation out of a book. I can't give it to you. Brother Andrew can't give it to you. There's only one that can give you the revelation and that's Christ himself, the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. That's why I prophesy above all else, pray for revelation. [Applause] And I promise you, if you start praying, God, the understanding will come. &gt;&gt; I feel it. I I feel I feel the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to tell you this. Quit trying to figure it out like a math a math equation. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to work out everything and make everything fit. &gt;&gt; Quit arguing with it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to prove it. If there's something you don't understand, just lay it on the shelf and say, "God, I believe it anyhow." I may not understand it, but I believe it. And you just start praying. And I promise you this, God will send your pastor to the pull pit and he'll open up this Bible and the answer you've been looking for will come to you. Don't get a misunderstanding what we preach. You ain't got to understand it. Just believe it. The true understanding of the word will come to the eagle of the hour. God didn't reveal this message to keep you in the dark. If you want to know it, you can know it. &gt;&gt; Pray &gt;&gt; the word will come to you. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; we brought it all the way down out of the Bible, all the way down in Brother Brown's ministry. I got a little bit more time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Several years ago, I don't know quite how many, but brother Wayne was down there, brother Tim Puit's preaching on a Wednesday night. Was it was a Wednesday night, wasn't it? Wednesday night. Don't you I I appreciate what brother Ben said. Wherever he's at, I appreciate what he said. You go home and be faithful. &gt;&gt; Go to church on Sunday. go to church on Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; You never let them de no devil tell you that midweek service ain't important. &gt;&gt; That that's not a a valuable service is on a Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; He's down there preaching. The spirit of God begin to move at the end of the service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there was a there was a a young sister come up. I believe that sister may be here. Her name's Sister Kimberly. I think it was where now it's height. And she come up in the prayer line praying for her brother. &gt;&gt; His name was Justin. They began to pray. And while they were praying, [Applause] [Music] while they were praying, something woke that boy up in his house. [Music] Service went a little bit long. spirit of God been moving and he said, "Hey, something wrong here. The rapture must have happened." He jumped in a car, went riding through town, went somebody's by somebody else's house, they wasn't home either. He come right to church and about the time it would take him forget his house at church. Amen. And from the time she prayed, he shows up in church. Amen. Comes down to the altar, give his heart to the Lord, and still serving God this morning. Don't tell me that God don't move when we pray. Hallelujah. And the same God that did it in Louisiana can do it here right now. My wife, my wife sitting back there, she's got six brothers. Amen. Just just this year. Amen. Just, you know, just uh uh uh just within a few years ago, out of her six brothers, there was only two of them serving God. My wife began to get desperate and she started praying. Amen. And she started praying and one of her brothers, Amen, that that been hurt. Amen. By, you know, we've all been there. We've been scarred. Pre we've been church hurt and preacher hurt and and we've seen all kind of stuff around the message that they listen that ain't got nothing to do with the message. Just man's ideas. And [Applause] and her brother had been hurt. Amen. He had got bitter and that boy hadn't stepped foot in a church in 20 years. &gt;&gt; 20 years. But my wife got desperate and begin to pray. &gt;&gt; And I've been in a series and I've been studying something. I've been preaching something and I preached through some verses of scripture and and the Lord, the spirit of the Lord just kept dealing with me, brother Ray. And he said, "Go back and preach that preach that verse again and come in a different angle." And God started dealing my heart preaching on the prodical son. And I went out of the office that morning and I looked and there said her brother on the left side of the church. Had been in church in 20 years. And I'm preaching on the prodical son [Music] and he ain't missed the service hardly since. [Music] She had another brother. He's a good boy. He's just a good good man. Good boy. You know, he he just uh you know, he never really done nothing wrong really, but he didn't have no desire to serve God. He didn't have no desire to go to church. He got married and had a couple kids. He didn't. But he was a good boy. He didn't really do nothing wrong. Amen. But I tell you what, being a good boy ain't good enough. And my wife, Amen, I think she got even more fervent in her prayer. When she seen that one boy or her that one brother come in, she just started praying harder. [Music] And brother Ray, Amen. One day I got a text from him. He said, "I don't know what to do." He said, "But I got to be saved." He said, "I don't know how to do it. I don't know what to do." He said, "But I'm desperate." He said, "I can't live another day. I can't go another moment. I got to know Christ." And I let that I led him to Christ. Baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he's been serving God ever since. Listen to me. Amen. Amen. If he did it for Amen. If he did it for Kimberly, Amen. We and he did it for my wife. Amen. He can do it for you, too. I'll turn that around a bit and say this. Some of you young people sitting in this meeting this morning are here because you got a mama that's been praying. You got a daddy that's been praying. You got a pastor. Hallelujah. Maybe it was even your prayer that brought your deliverance. But somebody was praying [Applause] and while they were praying, Amen. I'm going to tell one more and I'm going to try to come come down to a close, but listen to this. Amen. There's a young preacher in my church. Amen. All this been going on just in the last few months. God's moving, friends. &gt;&gt; There's a young preacher in my church. He come back into in my office. He said, "Brother Josh," he said, "you know my cousin." And he called him by name. Boy, been raised in church, been raised in the message. Same thing. He got all kind of family troubles and broken home. All kind of situations, bad things happened. Amen. He got so hurt, discouraged. He backslid, went out in the world. Amen. A and been out in the world for years. Amen. Had all kind of addictions and troubles. Amen. and and and this preacher in my young preacher in my church come back there in my office for service on a Sunday morning. He said, "You know my cousin." He said, "I got it on my heart to pray for him." And we couple of brothers in there and we just gathered around started praying. And friends, the spirit of God come down in that in that office and something so real just dropped down in that room. And just a couple days later, his cousin called him and they started talking about the Lord. He says, "Is there any way I can get on and start listening y'all services?" He gave him got him on the where he could listen to some services. Few couple Wednesday nights later, man. He showed up to church. [Applause] [Music] The end of that service, I dismissed the people. Most of the church walked out. Amen. I just felt in my heart, Holy Spirit, I just kept singing a little bit, worshiping. Amen. There was about 15, 20 people stayed and lingered. Amen. While that was going on, I watched that young man stand up. Walk down to the altar and he stood there with his hands lifted up. He said, "Brother Josh, I don't know what to do." He said, "But I just got to" He said, "I'm here to surrender my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ." He said, "I got to know him." He said, "I got to know him." Listen, when you start praying, something's going to happen. [Applause] While they were praying, [Applause] Hallelujah. What about in this camp? What about in this camp? Brother Nathan was telling me just the other day, he said, right before camp, the young people of True Word Tabernacle gathered up in a prayer meeting. He said, and while they were having prayer meeting, he said, "Brother, the spirit of God come in such a sweet way." Amen. Elizabeth is you can't have services like this except somebody's praying somewhere. You can't have a meeting like this except somebody is getting desperate before God and praying. [Applause] Hallelujah. I'm bringing it right down home now to you. Amen. How many of you are going to go home with this testimony? I went the true word and while I was praying, God filled me with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. I went to camp and while I was praying, God delivered me of anxiety. While I was praying, God broke the bondage of lust off of my life. While I was praying, I was healed. Hallelujah. What about it, brother Johnson? What about Zion? Amen. While I was praying, God healed my body. While I was praying, God delivered me. Hallelujah. Are you going over that testimony? And listen, friends, if you ain't got that testimony yet, start praying now. [Applause] [Music] David said it this way. I sought the Lord and he heard me &gt;&gt; and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto him and were light and their faces were not ashamed. This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and save him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord and kepteth round about them that fear him and deliverth them. Hallelujah. Listen friends, I ain't just a psalm in the Bible. That's your testimony. I sought the Lord and he heard me. Hallelujah. I cried and he delivered me. [Music] Hallelujah. As a musician's come this morning. Amen. Listen. Amen. I want you to catch this now. Amen. Because Amen. Daniel said, "And while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God, or the holy mountain of my God. Yay. While I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel come, Amen. who I had seen in the vision and began being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation and informed me and talk with me &gt;&gt; and said, "Oh Daniel, I am come to give forth to give thee." He come to give him skill and understanding. I was studying this the other day, Brother Jonathan, and I was sitting there and I was thinking, "Brother Ray, I'm sure you understand how this comes sometimes." I I I was I was praying and I was I was reading these verses and the Lord was dealing with my heart and said and something in me was just saying God sent the Holy Spirit to the church to do what Gabriel did &gt;&gt; to Daniel. And I was thinking about that and I'm going to kind of tell myself how sometimes how little I know. But I was I was thinking about that and I thought, man, it would be really nice if Brother Brandham made that connection. And about five minutes later, I was reading a message, amen, about Gabriel's visitation to Daniel. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said this, the same way that that God sent Gabriel to Daniel, he sent the Holy Spirit to the church. [Music] And I want to close I want to close this camp in telling you this. The Holy Spirit didn't come in these meetings just to give you a good feeling. Although we love it. How many loves to feel God? I ain't preaching against that at all. Hey, I love to feel God. And I thank God. Hey, it comes with emotion. But I tell you one thing. Amen. The Holy Spirit didn't come in these meetings just to give you emotion or just to give you a good feeling or give you a chill bump or give you some excite excitement. Amen. But the Holy Spirit come to give you skill and understanding. The Holy Spirit come to you this weekend. Amen. In the word to give you an understanding. You know what understanding is? The ability to comprehend. It's discernment. Amen. You It's giving you the ability to discern. And prophet of God said, "Amen. When we get the true revelation of who we are, amen, with the spirit. Amen. Oh, come on, friends. We can discern and withstand. You cannot withstand until you can discern. You got to have an understanding before you can withstand. And the Holy Spirit has come to give you understanding that you have discernment that you can withstand the antichrist spirit. But I love how the Bible connects two words there. &gt;&gt; Skill &gt;&gt; and understanding. &gt;&gt; Because skill is the ability to do something &gt;&gt; well. &gt;&gt; You can have understanding with no skill. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be like a doctor. You know, he got all kind of understanding. They don't know how to put it into a practical use. Like an architect, he can draw anything, but he can't build nothing. You know what I'm tellers in here knows that's the truth. Oh, they can draw, but they can't they couldn't put together a bicycle. &gt;&gt; They got all kind of understanding, but no skill. &gt;&gt; But God didn't come in this camp just to make you a bunch of theological giants. So you can walk around and be all proud and oh I know about the seals and I know about this and I know Listen friends that ain't what the message come to do to make us a bunch of stuff shirt know it alls and amen walking around with a bunch of knowledge he come to give you skill and understanding listen friends listen to me young people you're leaving this camp with understanding but you're leaving with a skill to do something God didn't call you just to sit around and warm a pew. Amen. God called you to be an overcomer in the end time. God called you to conquer in this age. Come on friends. Amen. God is dependent on you to take the message that our prophet preached and live it. And the Holy Spirit is equipping you. Go forth with skill and understanding. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's try G.

What a wonderful God. What a merciful, mighty, and awesome God this morning. I'll tell you what a wonderful weekend in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're sitting here this morning and hearing this man of God preach. And you may say, "Lord, how long does it take for you to hear my prayer while I was praying? Was that an hour or was it an hour and a half? Was it 10 minutes?" You know, in the countdown, Brother Brandham was finishing his sermon in Bakersfield. He said, "Do you believe that little lady sitting there with the sunglasses on? You believe that?" He said, 'You had some deep thoughts right then and your eyes will be healed if you'll believe. Now, let me tell you, someone says she's got glasses on is the reason he knew it. He said, 'N no. Look here. See, just look at me just a moment. Do you believe me to be his prophet or his servant? Do you believe it? You should have with them thoughts you were having then thinking of how mysterious and what a great revelation that moon and representing. And he says, "Is that right?" Now, how could I know what she was even thinking in her heart? For the word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword, discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart. He said, "Now," he's talking to her. He said, "Now pray for somebody &gt;&gt; or do something." He said, "Here it is. Here's what popped in your heart right now. Here's what's in your heart. You got two brothers. you're praying for and they're both alcoholics. If that's right, raise up your hands. Brother Brandham hadn't even finished talking to her and she began to pray. He said, "Here's your prayer." &gt;&gt; Cuz it don't take 2 hours for that prayer to get to heaven. He knows the moment you open your mouth and you even begin to pray. You come into a place like this and the atmosphere of God and the so much power and so much anointing that is coming here and I I certainly want to thank each of you that has come here today to bring yourself and come together with us. That's why we come together. Brother Bram said, "What is it?" He said, "When that little fire here and that little fire, each one of you is a part of God and when you come together, it's the body of Christ uniting. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you bring your little liquifier from your church and your family and each one of you coming together is what builds up such a great manifestation of his spirit and his anointing." And and when it begins to happen, Brother Bam said, "You see what happens is," he said, "things begin to be get misunderstood when God begins to come like that." He said, "It's not really you they misunderstand." He said, "It's the Holy Spirit and how it makes you do things that they misunderstand." And when people begin to speak against it, they're not really speaking against you. They're speaking against what he is doing in you. And sometimes even even ministers misunderstand these things. They see people going through these prayer lines and being carried out the other end. Or they see these young people weeping their way and until they start uh uh uttering other tongues and they're rolling and snotting and having having just a real time in the presence of God. And even in the scripture it said there was a woman named Hannah that was down at the temple praying like that one day and the priest thought she was drunk. happened again in in the priest over there in Jerusalem in the upper room. 120 of them come down after being in the presence of that great light and they misunderstood what was happening. They thought they is all drunk and they begin to announce don't misunderstand what is happening. See because there was one among them with skill and understanding and he said this is that which the prophet Joel prophesied. It shall come to pass in the last days that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Amen. Some people say, "Well, I got a lot of understanding." But they don't understand the things they ought to understand. And skill and understanding would tell you that that great anointing that you have felt in this room is nothing less than the pillar of fire. It's the same pillar of fire that created the heavens and earth that met Moses and wrote the Bible, met Paul and wrote the New Testament, has come into this age to interpret the word in this age and bring this revelation to us. And he's been announced to be the anointing, the angel of the Lord, the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. And it's a reality that he's here. And he's not just here, but he's right here in your hearts. And that's why when you get together like this, it's such a such a power and such a grace that comes in the room because that's him. You you got that picture of that Sam Houston Coliseum. You know, they took this picture uh in in in Sam Houston Coliseum in the 1950s with brother Brandham. And you all have seen it and you've seen the picture, you've looked on it many times, but you know that they took a picture just before these and and there's pictures after these. And you've seen many pictures of Brother Brandham, but what makes this one so special is it it's not really just Brother Brandham in the picture. &gt;&gt; It's that other one up above his head there &gt;&gt; that we have recognized to be the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ visiting this generation in the form of the pillar of fire. And Paul saw that same thing in the book of Acts and he said, "Lord, who are you?" And he said, "I am Jesus." Now, you come here to this weekend and you've had great fellowship and you've heard great ministries. Brother Brandham's not been in any of these meetings. And when you go home, these ministers that's preached these powerful messages and the men of God that's prayed for you is not going to go home with you. &gt;&gt; But see, there's two in that picture right there. &gt;&gt; One of them is not here today, &gt;&gt; but that other one He said, "I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and I'll be with you, even in you, until the end of the age." And when you go home, you let him go home in you. You take him back to your churches. You take him back to your prayer meetings. You take that fire, amen, and let it burn so bright that others will want to be into the presence of that great angel. I certainly love you and I thank you all. We we there's no way that we could thank every person in the building, but we want to thank you all together and thank each minister, each pastor, all the churches and all the all the different ministries and the youth leaders and the and the I set out this morning having my coffee and some of the brothers came by and and they said, "Brother Wayne said, this has been the most amazing time." And he said, "Last night through that prayer line, one brother said,"I seen them carrying my daughter out." He said, "She got under the spirit and couldn't even walk no more." And he said, "I picked that." They picked her up carrying her out. And she he said something swept over me. He said, "I wanted to run all over the building." Amen. To see the power of God on this next generation moving them and blessing them. I tell you, we had we had our generation and we're and we're carrying on. Amen. But thank God that that spirit has never left the church. &gt;&gt; It's never left you, young people. And you just keep moving in his in his presence. Don't you let nobody tell you it was for another generation cuz it belongs to you. And we're so thankful this morning for it. And I I I I would echo the words of Josh Bennett. I am extremely proud of you, of what you do, of what you stand for, what you believe. We so thank you for each one of you visiting the camp and giving us the opportunity to be a blessing to you. Amen. And I I I do want to just bow our hearts this morning in a word of prayer. And you know, we've heard prayer changes things. We've heard it. And some of you maybe for time's sake you didn't want to come forward and you have that loved one. You have that need that you're in your heart and that situation. I tell you just in dismissal today won't you just reach over may put your hand on someone there because whether you know it or not your hand is powerful and the prayer you pray is powerful. So maybe just right now you just pray one for the other and ask God to answer that need that's in that life. Father, as we bow our hearts, as we bring this evening or this day to a close, Lord, and we bring these meetings to its end, Father, we are so thankful for the visitation that you have given us in this place. Oh God, how we're reminded that it was a mother's prayer that come knocking on my door and how I stand here today because somebody prayed. My mother got a hold of you and she wouldn't let go, Lord. And how you dealt with my heart, Lord. And I pray today, Lord, that Father, that every need that's been brought up before you in these meetings, Lord, may they be answered. May your grace be upon them. right now as we pray one for the other. I pray that Father as they lay their hands one on the other that Lord the revivals that have been asked for may they realize the answers Lord. I pray father Lord as you have moved among them I pray that you secure their experiences with the seal of your spirit. Lord may they go home with skill and understanding Father and Lord we thank you. We give you glory and honor. We thank you for Lord the prayers that have been prayed and answered. Now Lord we commit these great meetings in your hand and if there be any glory. We give it all to you father in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. We thank you for it father. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen. There's a little song we used to sing years ago and I always really liked it because you know if uh if there is a next year and we're here, we're going to see one another. But maybe somebody that you see here today won't be here next year. But I'll tell you this, if I don't see you again until I see you over there, &gt;&gt; I want you to do me a favor. When you enter that city, I want you to come look me up. I want you to come look me up and say, "Brother Wayne, you remember that camp meeting down there that night? &gt;&gt; How the Lord came and and how the Lord had spoke to me in this need and you just Amen. I I I love that little song. Won't you look for me?" Can we sing that, brother Ben? Amen. I don't know what key song.
