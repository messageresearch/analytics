[5:58] Amen. Let's just speak to him tonight.
[6:00] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight
[6:03] for the grace that you have given that

[6:08] mercy, Lord, the remembering of what you

[6:13] gift that you have given [music] to to
[6:15] us, Lord. But Father, we pray tonight,
[6:19] that your great Holy Spirit, [music]
[6:20] Lord, would not just be something that
[6:23] is in a history or something that's been
[6:26] placed back 2,000 years, [music] but
[6:29] Lord Jesus, we pray tonight that you
[6:32] would bring your mercy in this room. And
[6:35] Lord, that you would make things so

[6:41] hands. lead us, [music] Lord. Give us
[6:43] clarity and understanding. And Father,
[6:46] may the spirit of revelation and wisdom
[6:48] as it moves among us, Lord. [music] May
[6:50] it bless your children. We ask it in
[6:52] Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. And God
[6:56] bless you tonight. And Amen. We'd like
[6:58] to welcome each of you. And [music] as
[7:00] you turn in your Bibles to the book of
[7:01] Luke, the 2 chapter. Amen. We're going
[7:04] to read a few verses here. Uh Luke
[7:06] chapter uh one uh 2 verse one down to
[7:11] verse 21.
[7:13] Amen. Luke chapter 2.
[7:16] Amen. Uh
[7:21] brother Nathan, can I bug you to read
[7:22] this tonight? Amen. He does such a good
[7:26] job reading and this is such a beautiful
[7:27] story. A lot of scripture here. So it's
[7:30] written out if you'd like to read it. 21
[7:35] And it came to pass in those days that
[7:37] there went out a decree from Caesar
[7:39] Augustus that all the world should be
[7:41] taxed. And this taxing was first made
[7:44] when Sirenius was governor of Syria. And
[7:47] all went to be taxed everyone into his
[7:49] own city. And Joseph also went up from
[7:51] Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into
[7:54] Judea into the city of David which is
[7:56] called Bethlehem because he was of the
[7:58] house and lineage of David to be taxed
[8:01] with Mary his espoused wife being great
[8:04] with child. And so it was that while
[8:06] they were there the days were
[8:07] accomplished that she should be
[8:09] delivered. And he brought she brought
[8:11] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[8:13] in swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[8:15] manger because there was no room for him
[8:17] for them in the inn. And there were in
[8:20] the same country shepherds abiding in
[8:22] the field keeping watch over their flock
[8:24] by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord
[8:26] came upon them, and the glory of the
[8:28] Lord shone round about them, and they
[8:29] were sore afraid. And the angel said
[8:32] unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I
[8:34] bring you good tidings of great joy,
[8:37] which shall be to all people. For unto
[8:40] you is born this day in the city of
[8:42] David, a Savior, which is Christ the
[8:44] Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you.
[8:47] Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
[8:49] swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
[8:51] And suddenly there was with the angel a
[8:53] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[8:55] God and saying, "Glory to God in the
[8:58] highest, and on earth peace, goodwill
[9:01] toward men." And it came to pass, as the
[9:04] angels were gone away from them into
[9:05] heaven, the shepherds said one to to
[9:07] another, "Let us now go even unto
[9:09] Bethlehem, and see this thing which is
[9:11] come to pass, which the Lord hath made
[9:13] known unto us." And they came with
[9:15] haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and
[9:17] the babe lying in a manger. And when
[9:20] they had seen it, they made known abroad
[9:21] the saying which was told them
[9:23] concerning this child. And all they that
[9:25] heard it wondered at those things which
[9:26] were told them by the shepherds. But
[9:29] Mary kept all these things and pondered
[9:32] them in her heart. And the shepherds
[9:34] returned glorifying and praising God for
[9:36] all the things that they had heard and
[9:38] seen as it was told unto them. And when
[9:41] eight days were accomplished for the
[9:42] circumcising of the child, his name was
[9:45] called Jesus, which was so named of the
[9:48] angel before he was conceived in the
[9:50] womb.
[9:52] God bless you as you could be seated.
[9:55] Amen. A very, [clears throat]
[9:57] very beautiful and life-changing moment
[10:01] in the history of the church.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; You know, um
[10:07] I uh have studied brother Brandham for
[10:09] years.
[10:10] And uh as I think this is just passing
[10:13] 30 years of ministry and listening to
[10:16] the prophet and many times during the
[10:18] Christmas season, Brother Brandon would
[10:20] take a a text and he would preach
[10:22] concerning Christ or about the birth of
[10:24] Christ and he would take a text and
[10:26] speak on things. And I just thought it
[10:28] was uh just uh just going through I I
[10:31] think I've read several of the books and
[10:32] listened to several tapes just in the
[10:34] last few days and just uh thought I
[10:36] would share a few things with you
[10:37] tonight. uh some things that the prophet
[10:40] had said about this type in this season.
[10:42] He said, 'You know, uh, this is why
[10:44] Bethlehem 1963. He said, 'You know, at
[10:47] Christmas, I think we all, too many of
[10:50] us, I wouldn't say all, but too many of
[10:52] us lose the real value of what Christmas
[10:54] is. And I noticed even out in the palm
[10:57] trees, they have it decorated. And in
[10:59] the east, it's the fur tree and the
[11:00] evergreen. And months or weeks, rather
[11:02] month or six months before Christmas
[11:04] even begins, uh, they start tensil and
[11:07] commercial. and instead of what it
[11:09] really means. I don't believe that
[11:11] Christ was born on the 25th day of
[11:13] December. I do not believe that at all.
[11:16] I would believe it be impossible for
[11:18] these things. Of course, we just read
[11:19] the story of his birth. On the hills of
[11:22] Judea are snowy and waste deep snow and
[11:24] month of December up in Judea. But we
[11:27] realize in studying history, Christ was
[11:29] probably born in the spring long about
[11:31] April or May, something like that. But
[11:34] when it was changed, see, is when
[11:36] Christianity was converted into Romanism
[11:38] and they made the son of God's birthday,
[11:40] sun god's birthday, which was a solar of
[11:43] the 25th, the 25th to the 25th of
[11:45] December, 21st, 25th of December, the
[11:48] setting of the sun almost changes at
[11:50] all. And then that was the son of the
[11:52] sun god's birthday. So they just changed
[11:54] it to the son of god. you know uh that's
[11:57] uh you know you can talk about we talk
[11:59] about the birth of Christ but then there
[12:01] is actually the birth of Christmas which
[12:04] began uh in Rome under Constantine
[12:07] whenever Christianity was being mingled
[12:10] with paganism and and Constantine
[12:12] actually used it as a way to get
[12:14] Christians to enter pagan festivals.
[12:16] That was his concept. So Jesus was never
[12:19] born on the 25th day of December. rather
[12:21] he would have been born sometime in
[12:23] April along in that season whenever
[12:25] lambs were actually born and brother man
[12:27] says but see but remember whatever day
[12:30] that it might be it still doesn't take
[12:33] away the sacredness of what it's
[12:34] supposed to be
[12:36] &gt;&gt; now where Satan has robbed us of this is
[12:38] he's made a commercial and the Santa
[12:39] Claus has stoleed all of the worship and
[12:42] it's become like Easter with bunny
[12:43] rabbits and pink ducks and things like
[12:45] this what's it got to do with Easter and
[12:47] what's it got to do with the
[12:48] resurrection of Christ it's just like
[12:50] the world today. Kids on the street can
[12:52] tell you more about David Crockett than
[12:54] Jesus Christ. They can tell you about
[12:56] some outlaw or some criminal, the prince
[12:58] of life. See, but born 1900 years ago.
[13:01] Now, that doesn't take away from the
[13:04] real thing from Christians. Now, you
[13:06] see, light shines its best in the
[13:08] darkness. And the forkid light in the
[13:10] black of cloudy skies at night shows
[13:12] that there can be light in darkness. And
[13:15] when the light is shining, see I if this
[13:18] if the sun's shining, you don't have
[13:20] much need of light. You don't see it too
[13:22] much. But the darker the smaller the
[13:25] light and greater will it shine in the
[13:27] darkness. The darker the better.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; It shows itself better. And we
[13:32] Christians ought to be testifying to the
[13:34] glory of God giving to us his son. See
[13:37] the Christmas ought to be an outstanding
[13:40] thing. When we Christians, no matter how
[13:42] much it looks, it makes it shine that
[13:44] much better. The whole world's got
[13:46] tinsel, but we've got Christ, and that's
[13:49] what it ought to be. Letting our uh
[13:51] light shine in a dark hour that we're
[13:53] now living in. Now, God's gifts always
[13:56] find their places. This is about maybe
[13:59] close to 10 days later. Brother Ram
[14:01] says, "See, Christianity, we've uh Rome
[14:04] was uh being this was converted Rome
[14:07] into Christianity in the way of Rome.
[14:09] We'll make the same celebration and
[14:10] we'll make the son of god's birthday,
[14:12] the son god Jupiter's birthday, then the
[14:15] son of god the 25th of December. See,
[14:18] but what difference does it make? I love
[14:20] a prophet. He he tells you exactly what
[14:23] the 25th day of December is. It's the
[14:25] sun god's birthday. A pagan uh the the
[14:28] soloulless of the sun. It was a winter
[14:31] feast that the pagans was in. And when
[14:33] Constantine made Christianity legal,
[14:35] they just said, "What we'll do is we'll
[14:37] call it the son of God's birthday." And
[14:39] then they would worship and and they
[14:41] would make a celebration during that
[14:42] time. But here comes along a prophet
[14:45] 2,00 nearly 2,000 years later because
[14:47] this is from 8,300. And brother Bam
[14:49] says, "But what difference does it
[14:51] make?" He said, "See, today if there was
[14:53] if we was doing this in July or we was
[14:56] doing this in August or whenever it
[14:59] might be, it's still the sacredness of
[15:02] remembering that God gave us hope that
[15:04] we have in us." Amen. Well, the rest of
[15:07] them, now you say, "Well, the rest of
[15:09] them's all Santa Claus and going on like
[15:11] that. We ought to just do it as well."
[15:14] No, sir. This is not a pagan celebration
[15:17] to us.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; This is a sacred hour.
[15:21] If there had been no Christmas, there
[15:23] would be no resurrection. If there had
[15:26] been no Christmas, there had been no
[15:27] love. If there had been no peace, there
[15:29] had been no hereafter for the believer,
[15:31] if there would have been no Christmas.
[15:33] Well, if the rest of the world, Brother
[15:35] Bram said, the forked lightning in the
[15:37] black cloudy sky shows there can be
[15:39] light in the time of darkness. And these
[15:42] lights tonight prove that there can be
[15:44] light in the dark time. And when does a
[15:46] light shine its best? In darkness. And
[15:48] when the turn the lights on in the
[15:50] daytime, the sun is shining. You'll
[15:52] hardly notice they're even on. But when
[15:54] we see it shine is a bright times and
[15:56] the time of darkness. And right now is
[15:59] the darkness when every Christian should
[16:01] give a testimony of the hope that is in
[16:04] him of Jesus Christ the son of God. Not
[16:06] some Chris Kringle that was born back
[16:08] yonder, you know, not some kind of tree
[16:10] lit up and down through the forest one
[16:12] night and some fiction story. Now,
[16:14] there's no bottom to it, but we believe
[16:16] solidly on the promised word of God
[16:18] coming, the Messiah, and he was born on
[16:21] Christmas day. Amen. You said, "Well,
[16:24] Brother Wayne, I I tell you, I I think
[16:26] that brother Brandham is such a powerful
[16:28] reality to the way things ought to be."
[16:31] Here's 1963, we have seen the star. And
[16:34] now, but in this hour of darkness, I say
[16:37] that we uh we live in still Christians
[16:39] should be holding forth a light that
[16:42] there is a truth to Christmas. That is
[16:44] the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of
[16:46] God. The zigzag forkid lightning and
[16:48] dark, cloudy, angry skies shows that
[16:51] there can be light in darkness. It
[16:53] proves that there can be light. In the
[16:56] darkness of the darkest of times, there
[16:59] can still be light. Amen. I certainly
[17:01] believe that's why God put you here on
[17:03] this earth. that there would be light in
[17:05] the time of darkness, in this dark age,
[17:08] and all these things that are going on,
[17:10] but there would be believers in the
[17:11] middle of it that would still shine a
[17:13] light. Amen. I I I thank God tonight for
[17:16] it. Don't you? I The other day I was
[17:17] doing something there at the house and
[17:19] Eevee come crawled up in my lap and and
[17:21] she had something toy or something she
[17:23] was wanting to play with, wanting me to
[17:24] play with. And she looks up at me and
[17:26] she said, "Oh, papa." She said, "You
[17:28] know, does the Bible say you ought to
[17:30] love your enemies?" And I said,
[17:31] "Uh-huh." She said, "Papa, is is the
[17:34] devil your enemy?" [laughter]
[17:38] I said, 'Well,
[17:40] man, you know, she she putting it on me
[17:43] pretty good. So, she said, "Well, does
[17:45] he have a daddy and a mommy?" I said,
[17:47] "Well, God created the devil." And she
[17:49] started laughing. She said, "That's
[17:50] funny, papa." She said, "That's funny."
[17:53] I said, "Well, God created him, but he
[17:54] wasn't always bad." She said, "That's
[17:56] right. He wasn't always bad, was he?" I
[17:58] said, "He wasn't always bad." She said,
[18:00] "Well, it's when he wanted everyone to
[18:02] worship him instead of Jesus. That's
[18:04] when he turned bad." I said, "That's
[18:05] when he went bad, Eevee. That's when he
[18:07] went bad." And out of the blue, she
[18:09] says, "But you know, Papa," she said,
[18:10] "Santa Claus is bad, ain't he?" I never
[18:13] heard a 5-year-old say Santa Claus was
[18:14] bad. She says, "Santa Claus is bad,
[18:17] Papa." And I said, "He is?" She said,
[18:19] "Oma, now that's Sister Don Carter." He
[18:21] said, "Oma told me that he takes all the
[18:24] glory away from Jesus." I said, "I'm
[18:26] going to have to thank your your your
[18:28] for letting you know that this Santa
[18:30] Claus has taken all the glory away from
[18:32] Jesus." Amen. And I I certainly don't
[18:34] believe that there ought to be glory
[18:36] given to a a Santa Claus during the time
[18:39] when Christians are to be remembering
[18:41] what God has done for us in this
[18:44] generation and what he's done for you
[18:45] and me. Amen. Uh brother man would pick
[18:48] odd sermons during Christmas and this is
[18:50] one of them in the falling apart of the
[18:52] world. He said, "There's the appearing
[18:54] of a star in all these Christmas stories
[18:56] that's going to make up our re religious
[18:58] belief today." He said, "They're very
[19:00] good." He said, "I I thought in the
[19:01] church this morning, probably our pastor
[19:03] maybe to next Sunday will bring a
[19:05] message on some of those things like
[19:06] that." And I thought if give but then I
[19:09] thought to give to the people a change
[19:13] of view about Christmas. Amen. And I
[19:16] want to I want to preach a text from
[19:18] that tonight. Amen. a prophet changes
[19:21] our view about Christmas. Amen. I I
[19:24] think that's what we really needed in
[19:26] this generation was a prophetic view of
[19:29] Christmas because we've got a Roman view
[19:31] of Christmas and we got pagan belief in
[19:33] Christmas. We got the Jews that don't
[19:35] even believe there was a Christmas. Then
[19:37] we got modern Christmas. We got all
[19:39] kinds of people with with ideas about
[19:41] Christmas. But you know, I believe a
[19:43] prophet can give us a good view of what
[19:45] Christmas ought to be. Don't you? I I
[19:47] think a prophet can give that view. And
[19:49] and I I've studied Brother Bannon for
[19:51] years and and having studied him, I
[19:54] think if you lay all of his Christmas
[19:55] messages side by side, and I've about
[19:57] done it this last two days. If you live
[20:00] most of those side by side, you're going
[20:02] to find that a consistent message will
[20:04] emerge out of every one of them. He's
[20:06] not trying to create a holiday sermon.
[20:09] He's not trying to create a tradition,
[20:12] but he's trying to correct the meaning
[20:14] of Christmas to turn hearts to a present
[20:16] reality. Amen. Brother Brandham is
[20:19] repeatedly pointing out to us December
[20:21] the 25th is not Christ's birthday. But
[20:24] you see, but when the pagan customs have
[20:26] replaced the spiritual meaning, the
[20:28] world begins to celebrate history rather
[20:31] and then they begin to miss life. Amen.
[20:34] He's not attacking Christmas to be
[20:36] harsh. He's just trying to bring truth
[20:39] into the church. This is not about a
[20:41] manger 2,000 years ago, but it's about
[20:44] the word being born into manifestation.
[20:47] See, if you take what brother Brandham
[20:50] uses, the word Christmas, if you would
[20:51] go Christmas equals, it equals the
[20:53] revelation of God made flesh. That's
[20:56] what it was about to brother Brandham.
[20:58] It wasn't about a a manger years ago.
[21:01] It's about the word coming into
[21:03] manifestation. That's right. Brother
[21:05] Random is talking about a Christmas that
[21:07] never finishes. He's talking about
[21:09] Christ was born in Bethlehem, but how he
[21:12] must be born again today in Bethlehem
[21:14] with every son and daughter of God.
[21:16] Christmas is God entering the flesh by
[21:19] the word. AND UNLESS THE SAME WORD COMES
[21:21] INTO you to be born again, amen, by a
[21:24] revelation, you're only celebrating
[21:26] history. AMEN. BUT WE OUGHT TO BE
[21:28] CELEBRATING LIFE. WE OUGHT NOT BE
[21:29] CELEBRATING a baby. We ought to receive
[21:32] THE WORD. WE OUGHT TO BE KEEPING A
[21:34] SEASON. And we ought to be keeping THE
[21:35] PRESENCE OF GOD. WE OUGHT NOT BE LOOKING
[21:38] BACK. WE OUGHT TO BE RECOGNIZING HIM
[21:40] TODAY. NOT CELEBRATING A TRADITION, BUT
[21:43] EXPERIENCING THE INCARNATION OF THE
[21:46] ALMIGHTY GOD IN THE SEASON WE'RE LIVING
[21:48] IN. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY PEOPLE GO WHAT
[21:51] WAY. AMEN. THE GREATEST DAY IN THE
[21:53] HISTORY OF MANKIND IS WHEN CHRIST COMES
[21:56] INTO THE HUMAN HEART AND CHANGES
[21:58] MANKIND. WE ARE NOT A TRADITION. WE ARE
[22:01] A LIVING REALITY OF A LIVING GOD IN THE
[22:04] SEASON THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. I love how
[22:06] a prophet begins in 1949 and he says,
[22:09] "I'm speaking this morning on the deity
[22:11] of Jesus Christ though so you'll know
[22:13] that he is not so that you'll know he is
[22:16] that what we are worshiping today. We
[22:19] are not worshiping a baby in a manger
[22:21] and we ARE NOT WORSHIPING SANTA CLAUS
[22:23] BUT WE ARE WORSHIPING ALMIGHTY God in
[22:27] the deity of his son." There is a truth
[22:30] in Christianity, folks. I know the world
[22:32] today have had put it off on all these
[22:34] traditions and all these ideas, but
[22:37] there is a truth in Christianity and
[22:39] there is a truth in the birth of our
[22:41] Lord JESUS CHRIST. AND YOU KNOW, we we
[22:44] look back in the Bible and we see here
[22:46] in Luke 2 how we read of our Lord Jesus
[22:49] coming into EARTH. NOW, YOU CAN GO BACK
[22:50] TO Genesis and you can find how the
[22:52] devil come into flesh, can't you? You
[22:54] can look and see the story of the
[22:56] serpent seed and how that Eve lay with a
[22:58] serpent and brought the devil into the
[23:00] flesh of Cain and Cain began the lineage
[23:02] of the devil in human flesh. But we have
[23:04] to go to the book that look of Luke the
[23:06] 2 chapter TO SEE HOW GOD entered human
[23:09] flesh. And God entered human flesh
[23:12] through a virgin birth.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He entered flesh through
[23:16] a virgin birth by overshadowing Mary by
[23:19] THE HOLY GHOST AND CREATING A BLOOD sail
[23:22] on the INSIDE OF A WOMAN. BECAUSE SEE,
[23:24] WHEN MAN FELL BACK IN THE GARDEN OF
[23:26] EDEN, HE COULD NOT save himself no more.
[23:29] MAN COULD not do something to bring
[23:31] himself out of the pit in which he fell.
[23:33] But it would take blood, a blood
[23:35] sacrifice to save mankind, would it not?
[23:38] But then man could not save man because
[23:41] man WAS ALL FALLEN AND THERE WAS NO MAN
[23:43] THAT WASN'T A SINNER. SO IT WOULD TAKE
[23:46] GOD TO SAVE MAN. BUT IT WOULD TAKE BLOOD
[23:48] TO SACRIFICE TO SAVE MAN. SO THE ONLY
[23:51] HOPE WE HAD WAS THAT THE GOD, THE
[23:54] SINLESS GOD, THE SPIRIT GOD WOULD CREATE
[23:57] A HUMAN BLOOD CELL THAT WAS A SINLESS
[23:59] BLOOD CELL. AND THAT BLOOD CELL COULD BE
[24:02] SACRIFICED FOR YOU AND I SO THAT WE
[24:04] WOULD NOT BE SAVED BY THE BLOOD OF A
[24:06] JEW. OR WE WOULDN'T BE SAVED BY THE
[24:08] BLOOD OF A GENTILE, BUT WE WOULD BE
[24:10] SAVED BY THE BLOOD OF ALMIGHTY GOD
[24:12] BECAUSE IT WAS THE CREATED BLOOD of
[24:14] Almighty God. SOMEBODY SAID, "BROTHER
[24:16] WAYNE, HOW WAS IT THE BLOOD OF GOD?"
[24:18] IT'S BECAUSE THAT it was creative. God
[24:20] didn't have blood, but God created
[24:23] blood. Amen. You you see that JOSEPH WAS
[24:26] NOT JESUS'S FATHER. AND MARY WAS not his
[24:29] mother. I'm sorry. The Catholics teach
[24:31] immaculate birth. And they almost they
[24:33] do teach that that Mary herself was
[24:36] immaculate. THAT SHE WAS BORN WITHOUT a
[24:38] sin desire because she was going to be
[24:41] the mother of God. She was not the
[24:42] mother of God. SHE WAS A BORROWED WOMB.
[24:45] LIKE HE had a borrowed tomb. LIKE HE HAD
[24:47] A BORROWED BOAT. LIKE HE HAD A BORROWED
[24:49] BODY. AMEN. BUT JESUS CAME THROUGH THE
[24:52] OVERSHADOWING OF THE HOLY GHOST INTO A
[24:55] HUMAN BLOOD CELL. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[24:57] SAID, "YOU COULD HAVE TOOK THAT BLOOD
[24:58] cell and put it on a stump and it still
[25:01] would HAVE COME TO LIFE BECAUSE HE WAS
[25:03] BOTH THE EGG AND the life that came into
[25:06] it. It was the blood of God." That today
[25:09] we are not redeemed by the blood of a
[25:11] man. We are redeemed by the blood of
[25:13] God.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; My that ought to be a shouting time in
[25:17] the church of the living God. Amen. What
[25:19] is it? It Amen. We have been brought
[25:21] from the manger TO REALITY. YOU KNOW, IN
[25:24] THE CHURCH TODAY, MANY PEOPLE STILL WANT
[25:26] TO PUT Jesus in a cradle. They want to
[25:28] put the church in A CRADLE. THEY WANT TO
[25:30] PUT US BACK THERE. AND BROTHER BAM SAYS,
[25:32] "But see, we have come out of the
[25:33] cradle. And Pentecost rocked us back
[25:36] under a few years ago, and people throw
[25:38] stones and made fun of us. But we've
[25:40] grown to maturity now. The hour is here.
[25:43] Hallelujah. Do you see what I'm
[25:45] interested to see? God's church coming
[25:47] together. Amen. That we beat out here
[25:49] that the hour is coming when God is
[25:52] throwing a blanket around all of us and
[25:54] drawing us for the enemy is at the gate.
[25:56] He said, watch this now. The great
[25:58] things, Daniel said, in the last days,
[26:00] HE SAID, LAST DAYS will come and there
[26:02] will be great exploits done by the men
[26:05] of faith in that day. DO YOU BELIEVE
[26:07] WE'RE IN THAT DAY? WERE WE IN THE DAY
[26:09] WHEN JESUS is just in a manger or he's
[26:12] in Luther or HE'S IN WESLEY OR HE'S IN
[26:14] PENTECOST? OR HAVE WE REALLY CAME TO AN
[26:16] AGE OF MATURITY WHEN DEITY ITSELF HAS
[26:20] COME DOWN INTO MEN OF FAITH AND IS NOW
[26:22] GIVEN THE POWER TO BRING THE EXPLOITS OF
[26:25] FAITH IN THE CHURCH of the living God?
[26:27] &gt;&gt; My goodness. I don't believe it's God in
[26:29] a manger. But I believe God is alive
[26:31] manifesting himself in the season we're
[26:34] living in in these Christmas times when
[26:36] people are shopping and dancing and
[26:38] drinking and celebrating and know
[26:40] nothing about it like they were
[26:42] celebrating Washington on Lincoln's
[26:43] birthday. He had a sense of humor,
[26:45] didn't he? Amen. They're celebrating
[26:46] Washington on Lincoln's birthday, but
[26:48] they're NOT WORSHIPING. THEY'VE STILL
[26:51] GOT GOD IN THEIR MANGER. BUT WHEN GOD IS
[26:54] NOT IN A MANGER, HE IS RAISED FROM THE
[26:56] DEAD and he is alive forever more.
[26:59] PROVING HIMSELF THE SAME GOD. THAT'S
[27:01] RIGHT. These Nian fathers carried down
[27:03] through the ages. Amen. To Pentecost.
[27:06] That same God that met Paul on the road
[27:08] to Damascus. He was a missionary. He was
[27:10] a messenger to the Gentile. And the
[27:13] Gentiles message started with a pillar
[27:15] of fire and it's going to end the same
[27:17] very way. I believe the hour has come. I
[27:20] believe the season has arrived for the
[27:22] church THAT JOEL THE 2 CHAPTER should be
[27:25] fulfilled. Should it not? Should we
[27:27] still BE IN A MANGER OR SHOULD WE BE
[27:29] WALKING TALL IN THE SCRIPTURES THAT HAS
[27:31] BEEN PROPHESIED FOR OUR GENERATION? BE
[27:34] GLAD THEE, YE CHILDREN OF ZION, AND
[27:36] REJOICE in the Lord your God. For he
[27:38] hath given us the former rain
[27:40] moderately, AND HETH WILL CAUSE TO come
[27:42] down your rain, the former rain, and the
[27:44] latter rain in the first month. AND YOUR
[27:46] FLOOR shall be full of wheat and the fat
[27:48] shall overflow wine and oil and I will
[27:50] restore to you the years that the locust
[27:53] hath eaten and the cankerworm and the
[27:54] caterpillar and the palmer worm and my
[27:57] great army which I sent among you.
[27:59] Listen that brother Bam said the HOUR
[28:01] HAS COME NOW WHEN THE GREAT DRAMA the
[28:03] picture of God has set forth to the
[28:05] latter rain. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. THAT'S
[28:08] THE SEASON THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. WE'RE
[28:10] LIVING IN THE SEASON IN JOHN WHERE he
[28:12] said, "VERILY, VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU,
[28:14] HE THAT BELIEVETH on me. The works that
[28:16] I DO SHALL HE DO ALSO, AND GREATER WORKS
[28:19] SHALL YOU DO, BECAUSE I GO UNTO THE
[28:22] FATHER." DID HE NOT SAY, "AS MY FATHER
[28:25] SENT ME, SO SEND I YOU." AND HOW DID THE
[28:28] FATHER SEND HIM? HE WENT IN HIM. AND THE
[28:30] SAVIOR THAT SAVED US IS NOT IN A MANGER.
[28:33] HE'S IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. IF HE
[28:36] SENT YOU, HE'S IN YOU TONIGHT. AND HE'S
[28:39] NOT DEAD. HE is alive. AND HE'S JUST AS
[28:42] MUCH GOD TONIGHT AS HE WAS THE DAY HE
[28:45] was born in the manger. But he's in you
[28:47] instead of that manger back there in the
[28:49] Bible. In John 15, he said, "If you
[28:52] abide in me and my words abide in you,
[28:54] you ask what you will and it shall be
[28:57] done unto you." I believe that's the
[28:59] hour we're living. And man, I think
[29:01] Jesus said these things and brother
[29:03] Bannon will draw from that a great and
[29:05] powerful thing. He said the same power,
[29:07] the same Christ. He said, 'Now you let
[29:09] fundamentalists and people who deny the
[29:12] power of God say it's wrong, but the
[29:14] same power that spoke the world into
[29:16] existence is in those people that's got
[29:19] the Holy Ghost. How many got the Holy
[29:21] Ghost tonight?
[29:22] &gt;&gt; I know they started calling Holy Spirit
[29:24] these days cuz they want to they're a
[29:25] bit ashamed of them tongue talkers, you
[29:27] know, of that Pentecostal experience.
[29:29] But brother uses the word Holy Ghost a
[29:31] lot. And I thank God, Amen, that he
[29:33] wasn't so intellectual, he couldn't just
[29:35] read the Bible. Amen. You see what he
[29:37] says? The power of God. Some say it's
[29:39] wrong. He says, "BUT LET THEM PEOPLE
[29:42] DENY THE POWER of God say it's wrong."
[29:44] But the same power that spoke the world
[29:45] into existence is in the people that's
[29:47] got the Holy Ghost. MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S
[29:50] TIME YOU FOUND OUT WHO you are. Now, the
[29:52] devil has been trying to hide you back
[29:55] and tell you you're a little cow down
[29:57] something, but you're not. YOU'RE SONS
[30:00] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this one? Deity is not
[30:06] in heaven.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. DEITY IS NOT IN HEAVEN.
[30:12] IT'S IN YOU. AND THEN THE PROPHET GETS A
[30:14] HE GETS A LITTLE FANATICAL AND HOLLERS,
[30:17] HALLELUJAH.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; PLEASE BE OUR GOD. THAT DEITY IT'S NOT
[30:21] JUST IN HEAVEN, IT'S IN YOU.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I know you think I'm crazy,
[30:26] but let me tell you something, brother.
[30:28] When you realize the almighty God lives
[30:31] in you with immortal life. My life I
[30:34] give Zoe. The life of God is in a human
[30:37] being.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT HE SAID. YET A LITTLE while
[30:40] and the world seeth me no more. But you
[30:42] shall see me because I live ye live
[30:45] also. And at that day, now what day is
[30:49] that, folks?
[30:51] &gt;&gt; The day when the revelation is made
[30:52] known. That's this day.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; And at that day you shall know that I am
[30:56] in my father. that ye in me and I in
[31:00] you. At that day you're going to know
[31:02] it. People say, "Well, you can't even
[31:03] know you're born again." Well, Jesus
[31:05] prophesied there was coming a day.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; There would be a DAY OF KNOWING. ISN'T
[31:10] IT ODD that he also re rectifies this
[31:12] with the adoption or maturity or
[31:15] knowing? There is a season of knowing
[31:17] who you are. There is a season of
[31:19] knowing what you're here for. There's a
[31:21] season of knowing what God has done to
[31:23] get you back where you come from. IF I
[31:26] KNOW WHERE I'M AT, IF I knew where I was
[31:28] before and I KNOW I'M HERE TONIGHT, THEN
[31:31] THANK GOD HE REVEALS how to get me BACK
[31:33] WHERE I'M GOING. THIS IS NOT AN AGE OF
[31:35] IGNORANCE. THIS IS AN AGE OF REVELATION
[31:38] AND MATURITY OF THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[31:40] GOD. AMEN. YOU CAN CALL IT CHRISTMAS.
[31:42] YOU CAN CALL IT LEARDYSIA. YOU CAN CALL
[31:44] IT ANYTHING YOU WANT. BUT IN THE MIDDLE
[31:46] OF ALL OF IT, THERE'S A LIGHT THAT
[31:48] SHINES IN A DARKNESS THAT THE BRIDE OF
[31:50] JESUS CHRIST KNOWS WHO SHE IS AND WHERE
[31:53] SHE'S FROM AND WHERE SHE'S GOING. YOU
[31:56] CAN PUT ANY label you want to on this.
[31:58] We are not shaken by labels.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Well, that bunch of Pentecostals down
[32:03] there. You can label me any WAY YOU WANT
[32:04] TO, BUT I'M GOING TO GET UP IN THE
[32:06] MORNING KNOWING WHO I AM, WHERE I come
[32:08] from, WHERE I'M GOING, WHAT I BELIEVE. I
[32:10] DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO NOBODY.
[32:13] WE JUST HAVE to be what God made us to
[32:15] be.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; I love when you get to an age you have
[32:18] to you just don't have to explain
[32:19] yourself no more. You just are who you
[32:20] are.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see deity of Jesus Christ? Now,
[32:25] Brother Bam says it. That deity is in
[32:27] you.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Y'all help me preach tonight. Turn and
[32:30] tell somebody said, "Dity is in you."
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Deity is in you.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet a little while and the world
[32:38] seeth me no more, but you shall be see
[32:40] me. I'll be with you even in the age.
[32:41] You see that? He's using that scripture
[32:44] to say to you, deity is in you.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in the manger. No, Christ
[32:51] in you. Hallelujah. We're not worshiping
[32:55] Christ in a manger, but it's Christ IN
[32:57] YOU, THE HOLY GHOST, THE HOPE OF LIFE,
[33:00] THE HALLELUJAH, THE CREATOR, GOD HIMSELF
[33:03] dwelling in human flesh. My goodness, no
[33:07] wonder Paul says in the Colossians, even
[33:09] the mystery which had been hid from the
[33:11] ages and generations, but is now
[33:13] manifest to his saints, TO WHOM GOD
[33:16] WOULD MAKE KNOWN what is the riches of
[33:18] the glory of this mystery among the
[33:20] Gentiles. Christ in you, the hope of
[33:23] glory. That's the great mystery. That's
[33:26] the great hope. Christ is in you, God.
[33:29] Christ, the hope of glory in you, not in
[33:31] a cradle, in you. THAT WAS ONE TIME GOD
[33:34] WAS BACK THERE IN the beginning and he
[33:36] come into Moses and he come into the
[33:38] children of Israel AND HE COME INTO
[33:40] CRADLE BUT NOW THEY'LL WORSHIP HIM BACK
[33:42] THERE LIKE A PREHISTORIC SOMETHING BUT
[33:44] IT'S NOT. IT'S CHRIST IN YOU. HE IS HERE
[33:47] TODAY.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD IS MOVING UP HIS GREAT
[33:51] CHURCH. COME ON FRIENDS, GET HIM OUT OF
[33:54] THE MANGER AND BRING HIM INTO the age
[33:56] we're living in. A PRESENT REALITY OF
[34:00] THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. And the prophet of
[34:02] God says this, "When the almond tree
[34:04] shall flourish and the desire of man
[34:05] shall fail," because he goes, he's uh in
[34:08] the book of Ecclesiastes, the 12th
[34:09] chapter, he's talking about as Solomon's
[34:12] talking about at the end of a man's
[34:14] life. Amen. As he's getting ready to
[34:16] fade, he's headed for the long home. The
[34:18] Bible says, "Amen. He's he's he's turned
[34:20] white in the hair. He's headed for the
[34:22] long home. There's certain things that
[34:24] he should have done. He's realizing he's
[34:26] out of time." And brother Bam says,
[34:27] "See, BUT THE PROPHET ALSO SAID IT'LL BE
[34:30] LIGHT in the evening time." AND WE CAN
[34:33] PREACH ABOUT THE Leoa and it's in and
[34:35] the DARKNESS AND THE TROUBLE AND THE
[34:37] THINGS THAT ARE COMING UPON THE EARTH.
[34:39] WE KNOW HER SEASON IS OVER. AMEN. SHE'S
[34:42] COMING TO THE END. BUT THE BIBLE SAID
[34:45] THERE SHALL BE LIGHT
[34:48] IN THE TIME OF DARKNESS. COME ON,
[34:51] CHURCH. YE ARE THAT LIGHT, YOUNG PEOPLE.
[34:54] YOU ARE THAT LIGHT IN THIS GENERATION.
[34:56] YOU'RE NO LONGER DARKNESS. YOU ARE NOW
[34:59] LIGHT. I'M PREACHING PAUL'S SERMON. Paul
[35:01] said, "You are now no more darkness, but
[35:03] ye are light."
[35:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I SAY, "TURN ON THE LIGHTS.
[35:08] LET THIS BRIDE RISE UP LIKE SHE'S NEVER
[35:10] BEEN." LET HER CARRY LIGHT INTO EVERY
[35:13] SINGLE PLACE IN THE WORLD WE LIVING IN.
[35:16] YE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. AMEN.
[35:18] DON'T GET UNDER A BUSHEL SOMEWHERE. GOD
[35:20] SET YOU ON A HILL. SHINE LITTLE LIGHTS.
[35:24] SHINE IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS LEISIA.
[35:27] SHINE ON.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; It's the light in the evening time. The
[35:35] path of glory. You will surely find in
[35:37] the evening time has come. The church
[35:39] now that was once dressed like a little
[35:41] manger experience that we've been
[35:43] through has come to the place now where
[35:45] people are realizing the deity and the
[35:47] power of almighty God. God is living in
[35:51] a human being.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; God is living in a human being.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; The hour has come. Brother Brandham
[36:02] said, "The son of God was in a cradle
[36:05] but is in the heart now." He is the
[36:09] deity of God, the creator. Think of
[36:12] this. He was in a cradle, but he's in
[36:14] the heart now. Today, what's the matter
[36:17] with the church? The hope of glory, the
[36:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into
[36:21] the people's hearts and they don't
[36:23] recognize what it is.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; They think it's just a little joining of
[36:27] church or something.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; See, but that is God the creator living
[36:31] in you.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; All giving you powers and you're in
[36:34] possession of anything he had. So if you
[36:37] abstain from evil to do good, to shun
[36:39] evil, to flee to righteousness, to turn
[36:41] from temptation, all malad and hatred
[36:43] and strife and so forth, turn away from
[36:45] it. Take him from your heart. See, but
[36:47] if you'll receive him, embrace him, and
[36:49] love him.
[36:51] Now, this is a prophet in your heart. I
[36:54] can tell you the church together in that
[36:56] kind of power HAS THE POWER TO BIND THE
[36:59] HEAVENS, to heal the sick, to open the
[37:01] blinds, to Hallelujah. The deaf's going
[37:03] to speak, and the dumb will speak, and
[37:04] the deaf will hear, and the cripples
[37:06] will walk, and the blind will see. Why?
[37:08] Because they're recognizing the power of
[37:10] God in your heart. Amen.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Recognizing the power of God that's in
[37:16] your heart.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Amen. The the the
[37:19] religion is trying to put him IN A
[37:21] MANGER.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PUT HIM IN A
[37:24] CELEBRATION. BUT GOD IS IN YOUR HEART.
[37:27] AND BROTHER B IS SAYING IF WE EVER
[37:29] REALLY RECOGNIZE THE POWER THAT'S IN THE
[37:32] HUMAN HEART, IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT
[37:34] CREATED THE HEAVENS and the earth.
[37:36] Embracing that and believing that. Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU SEE THAT message that Brother
[37:42] Brandham is bringing is just as
[37:44] unbelievable as the message of the
[37:46] virgin birth was 2,000 years ago.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; You you you I love Brother Bram's wise.
[37:52] HE PREACHES THE SERMON, WHY IT HAS to be
[37:54] shepherds.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; HE PICKS OUT BEAUTIFUL THINGS that the
[37:57] angels went OVER TO SHEPHERDS. WHY DID
[37:59] IT HAVE TO BE SHEPHERDS? BROTHER BRAM
[38:01] SAID, why didn't he go to the trained
[38:03] and the intellect? Why didn't he go to
[38:05] them that was responsible for knowing
[38:07] these kinds of things? He said because
[38:09] they had been trained in the wrong
[38:11] direction.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAYS IT. HE SAYS BECAUSE
[38:14] basically their training, Amen, would
[38:17] keep them from recognizing who they were
[38:19] talking about. And two. They were
[38:21] trained, but they were trained the wrong
[38:23] way. They were TRADITIONALLY TRAINED.
[38:25] THEY HAD IDEAS OF WHAT IT WOULD BE. SO,
[38:27] BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "SO when the angels
[38:29] gave their message, they didn't give it,
[38:31] Amen, to the theologians. They gave it
[38:34] TO SHEPHERDS.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, WHY DID THEY GIVE IT TO SHEPHERDS?
[38:37] BROTHER SAID, "SO, because they were
[38:39] unlearned."
[38:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THEY HAD NO religious
[38:43] teachings.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE, AMEN. THEY WASN'T SO HIGH UP.
[38:47] They couldn't receive a message that
[38:49] would take THEM TO A BARN.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. CAN YOU IMAGINE SOME
[38:53] BIG BROTHER SAID HE WAS BORN RIGHT OUT
[38:55] through the shadow of the cathedrals
[38:57] there? He said, "But could you imagine
[38:59] the angels going up there and telling
[39:00] them how upset they had to leave that
[39:02] cathedral and come in a barn to worship
[39:04] him?" Amen. BUT YOU SEE THAT SHEPHERD
[39:06] HAD NO PROBLEM with that barn. HE HAD NO
[39:09] PROBLEM humbling himself to walk into a
[39:11] barn. He was used to going into barns.
[39:14] AMEN. SO GOD SENT THE MESSAGE TO
[39:16] SOMEBODY THAT COULD RECEIVE IT. CAN YOU
[39:18] SEE HOW YOU FIT THAT SHEPHERD IN THE
[39:21] BIBLE THAT WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO YOU,
[39:23] AMEN, THAT YOU WOULD READILY RECEIVE?
[39:26] AMEN. WHAT MESSAGE WAS BROUGHT TO THEM?
[39:28] THE MESSIAH IS ON THE EARTH. NOW, THAT
[39:32] WAS THE MESSAGE THEY RECEIVED. THE
[39:34] MESSIAH WAS ON THE EARTH. THINK ABOUT
[39:37] THAT. A MESSIAH IS ON THE EARTH. AND OUR
[39:41] PHARISEES DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THE
[39:43] HIGHUPS DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THE BIG
[39:45] CHURCHES AND THEIR RELIGION DON'T KNOW
[39:47] ABOUT IT. AMEN. BUT THE ANGELS MADE IT
[39:49] KNOWN UNTO THE LITTLE AMEN. THE LITTLE
[39:52] INSIGNIFICANCE, THE NOBODIES IN A NOBODY
[39:55] PLACE. BUT THEY RECEIVED THE GREATEST
[39:58] message that HAS BEEN EVER HEARD BY
[40:00] MORTAL EARS. THE MESSIAH, THE KING.
[40:04] AMEN. IS ON THE earth now.
[40:08] [screaming]
[40:08] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HE'S ON EARTH NOW. Right
[40:12] now. He's on earth. Can you imagine when
[40:14] they heard that news? But where is he?
[40:16] THE MESSIAH. WHERE IS HE? DOWN the barn.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Down there among the cows and the and
[40:22] the and and the lambs. And the lamb
[40:23] said, "There's your proof." If it wasn't
[40:25] December, he said they was in a barn,
[40:27] not in a house with with insulation. You
[40:29] know, THEY WAS IN A BARN. AMEN. AND AND
[40:31] AND WHAT NOW WHAT KIND OF ROBE IS HE
[40:34] WRAPPED IN? WHAT kind of what KIND OF
[40:36] NICE FABRIC WOULD WE FIND a king in? OH,
[40:39] HERE'S A SIGN TO YOU. HE'LL be wrapped
[40:41] in a swaddling cloth. [laughter]
[40:43] GLORY TO GOD. HERE'S A SIGN. WHEN YOU
[40:46] FIND THE MESSIAH I'M TALKING ABOUT,
[40:48] HE'LL BE WRAPPED IN SO MUCH HUMILITY
[40:50] THAT YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO RECEIVE THAT
[40:52] IT'S THE TRUTH. BUT IT'LL BE THE TRUTH
[40:54] ANYHOW. THE MESSAGE IS THE TRUTH WHETHER
[40:57] WE BELIEVE THE TRUTH OR NOT. THE MESSIAH
[41:00] IS ON THE EARTH. BUT IT'S WRAPPED IN A
[41:03] SWADDLING THAT YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO
[41:05] RECEIVE IT.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; It's just a shepherd now.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; It was just shepherds.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and take take that type of
[41:13] shepherd for just a moment. Receiving
[41:15] that message. What was it? Amen. The
[41:17] message I'm quoting him directly. The
[41:19] Messiah is here now. And it bypassed all
[41:22] the trained ones to come to them humble
[41:24] ones,
[41:26] people that would receive it.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; The people wouldn't say, "Oh, well, wait
[41:29] a minute, Brother Bam. You're wrong on
[41:30] that."
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. No, wait a minute,
[41:33] Angel. You're wrong on that. Couldn't be
[41:35] the Messiah's here now cuz we ain't got
[41:37] no place for him. See, there's no
[41:39] there's no places big enough and there's
[41:41] no there's we don't have enough pump and
[41:43] we don't we don't have it. We don't have
[41:44] things set up, you know, you know,
[41:46] BECAUSE WHEN HE COMES, he's going to
[41:47] come this way and everything. you know,
[41:49] the Pharisees are going to have it. He's
[41:51] going to come riding in on the horse and
[41:52] he'll be the
[41:55] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS MESSAGE WAS A tradition
[41:57] shattering message.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; IT SHATTERED IT, BUT IT was a word
[42:01] message.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, IF IT IF IT IS THE MESSIAH
[42:05] WHEN HE'S BORN on the earth, isn't it
[42:06] amazing? Brother said that king was born
[42:08] and nobody even knew it,
[42:10] &gt;&gt; but heaven knew it.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And brother said, watch. He said the
[42:14] angels came down and began to sing. And
[42:16] when the angels began to sing, he said,
[42:18] "Angels have not sang to mortals." He
[42:22] said, "Ever there has never had be until
[42:24] that time angels on the earth singing to
[42:27] mortals." He said, "THE ANGELS HAD sung
[42:30] up in heaven when God created and took
[42:32] it to Job the 38th chapter and said,
[42:34] "Where were you WHEN THE MORNING STARS
[42:36] SANG TOGETHER AND THE SONS OF GOD
[42:38] SHOUTED FOR JOY?" THEY SAID, "THERE THE
[42:41] ANGELS SANG. THEY SANG AT THE CREATION
[42:43] OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH." HE SAID,
[42:45] "BUT NOW THERE WAS GOD IMMORTAL COMING
[42:48] INTO MORTAL EARTH AND THERE WAS NO
[42:50] CHOIRS TO SING FOR HIM. THERE WAS
[42:52] NOBODY. THERE WAS NO GREAT TRAINED
[42:54] VOICES TO SING FOR HIM. CAN YOU IMAGINE
[42:57] Joseph running down to the to the to the
[42:59] to the choir down at the cathedral
[43:01] downtown. Uh listen guys, we'd like
[43:03] y'all to come and and and and sing for
[43:06] the entrance of the great king." Oh
[43:08] yeah. Who is he? He's Jesus. Uh he's
[43:10] Jesus. And uh and who's his father?
[43:12] Well, that's kind of a that's kind of a
[43:14] story, but but he's the king. See, he's
[43:17] the king of peace. Would you COME DOWN
[43:18] AND SING FOR HIM? OKAY. WHAT WHAT HALL
[43:21] IS IT THAT WE'RE going to be in? What
[43:22] palace has he been born in? Oh, no. He's
[43:24] in the barn down here.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHAT KIND OF SOUND SYSTEM? WELL,
[43:29] SORRY to tell you, it won't be peevey.
[43:31] Amen. It's not going to be bows. Matter
[43:33] of fact, you ain't going to have none.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; AND Y'ALL JUST COME DOWN, gather around
[43:37] a little bit, and you don't have to
[43:38] practice. HE SAID, "KING, JUST COME SING
[43:40] a little while." AMEN. YOU CAN YOU
[43:42] IMAGINE them trying to convince a great
[43:46] robed choir to come to a barn to sing
[43:49] among the lambs and the animals. AMEN.
[43:52] WITH A POOR FAMILY WITH A LITTLE BABY
[43:54] WRAPPED IN A IN A SWADDLING CLOTH
[43:56] SETTING THERE. CAN YOU IMAGINE? BUT MAN
[43:58] SAID NO. HE SAID THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
[43:59] COME. THAT'S WHY GOD SENT ANGELS. DO YOU
[44:02] KNOW WHAT? AMEN. Mortals man didn't even
[44:04] know he was born. But heaven knew how
[44:07] something HAD HAPPENED. SO HEAVEN BE TO
[44:09] SING. AND HEAVEN SANG IN THE PRESENCE OF
[44:12] MORTAL BEINGS BECAUSE SOMETHING HAD
[44:14] TRANSPIRED. OH, church of the living
[44:17] God. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT RECORDINGS
[44:18] TODAY in the message of Christ is the
[44:21] mystery of God revealed ABOUT 2:00.
[44:23] AMEN. They're singing, "Take the name of
[44:26] Jesus with you." And brother Bam said,
[44:27] "There it is." He said, "The hand just
[44:30] struck 2:00. THE SECOND PULL IS OVER.
[44:32] THE THIRD PULL IS AT HAND." DID YOU HEAR
[44:35] THE ANGELS? THEY PICKED IT UP AN OCTAVE.
[44:39] All right, y'all want TO PREACH A LITTLE
[44:40] WHILE? AN OCTAVE IS EIGHT NOTES. AMEN.
[44:43] WE'RE BACK TO THE EIGHTH DAY AGAIN. THE
[44:45] FIRST DAY IS ALL OVER AGAIN. THE SAME
[44:47] GOD THAT STARTED IT. IT'S THE SAME GOD
[44:50] THAT'S GOING TO FINISH IT. THIS AIN'T
[44:52] ANOTHER CHURCH. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL
[44:55] CREATION. GOD HIMSELF HAS TOLD US
[44:58] SOMETHING HAS BEEN BORN. THE BAPTISTS
[45:01] DIDN'T KNOW THERE HAD BEEN A BIRTH. THE
[45:03] LUTHERANS DIDN'T KNOW THERE HAD BEEN A
[45:04] BIRTH. BUT THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN HAD
[45:07] ANNOUNCED IT IN A CLOUD OUT WEST. AND
[45:10] NOW THEY WERE SINGING to mortal beings,
[45:12] "The king has been born, but he's been
[45:16] born in another manger."
[45:21] &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. WITH THAT IN MIND, I COULD
[45:23] SAY, "MERRY CHRISTMAS TO THE BRIDE."
[45:25] AMEN. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A MANGER IN
[45:27] A BARN, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR
[45:29] HEART. AMEN. THEY THINK YOU AIN'T
[45:31] NOTHING BUT A BARN. THEY THINK YOU AIN'T
[45:33] NOTHING BUT AN ILLEGITIMATE BUNCH. BUT
[45:36] LET ME [laughter] TELL YOU, THE HEAVENS
[45:38] OF HEAVENS HAS CHOSE YOU TO BE THE
[45:40] DWELLING PLACE OF THE MIGHTY GOD IN THIS
[45:44] GENERATION.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; WELL, SOMEBODY SHOUT HALLELUJAH.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. [panting] They wouldn't have
[45:54] want that bunch over there. They
[45:56] wouldn't have wanted them in that
[45:57] cathedral anyhow,
[45:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:00] them angels probably made more noise
[46:03] than they would have wanted to hear.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you see what it is? The
[46:09] Messiah Messiah was on the earth. Do you
[46:11] know that when brother Bam spoke of the
[46:13] Israel returning to their homeland that
[46:16] there was people over there and they
[46:17] interviewed them and they said, "What
[46:19] are you coming home for? What's what's
[46:21] the purpose in y'all's homecoming?" And
[46:23] and and everybody else has a reason
[46:25] Israel's returning, you know. But they
[46:27] ask Israel, "Why are you returning?"
[46:29] They said, "We're returning to see the
[46:31] Messiah."
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know they're going to get the
[46:35] same message you got?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Do you know there won't be another
[46:39] opening of the seven seal? How many
[46:41] knows that
[46:42] &gt;&gt; there won't be another opening of the
[46:43] book?
[46:44] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHEN THIS GOES TO ISRAEL, it'll
[46:47] be just like Ruth handing a BABY TO NOA.
[46:51] AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID IT DIDN'T. SAID
[46:53] RUTH HANDED A baby to Naomi and HER
[46:56] YOUTH WAS REFRESHED AND SHE GAVE LIFE TO
[46:59] THE YOUNG BABY. WHEN THIS GOSPEL GOES
[47:01] BACK TO ISRAEL, IT'LL GO BACK ALIVE.
[47:04] WE'RE NOT HANDING A DEAD BABY BACK TO
[47:07] ISRAEL. WE'RE HANDING THE WORD BACK TO
[47:10] ISRAEL. AND WE WILL REVIVE NAOMI.
[47:13] HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A REVIVAL IN THE
[47:16] BRIDE. AND THIS REVIVAL GOES BACK TO
[47:18] ISRAEL. WHAT IS THE REVIVAL? IT'S NOT
[47:21] JESUS IN HISTORY. IT'S JESUS IN YOU.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; THE LIVING REALITY OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[47:28] CHRIST. WHAT A MESSAGE. WHAT A MESSAGE
[47:31] WE'RE LIVING IN.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; I told some of the brothers the other
[47:35] day, I said, "Sometimes I hear
[47:36] preachers, they well, I ain't got
[47:37] nothing to preach and I don't feel
[47:39] important." And I listen, it ain't got
[47:41] nothing to do with us feeling important.
[47:42] But let me tell you this. We got a
[47:44] message and it's the message of the
[47:46] king. If you're preaching your ideas, I
[47:48] get it. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HUNT UP
[47:50] SOMETHING TO SAY, I GET IT. BUT IF
[47:51] YOU'RE PREACHING THIS MESSAGE, YOU TELL
[47:53] EVERY DEVIL IN HELL TO GET OUT OF THE
[47:55] WAY. I HAVE BEEN CALLED. I HAVE BEEN
[47:57] ANOINTED. AND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS
[48:00] THE MESSAGE OF THE KING. THIS IS THE
[48:02] RESURRECTED JESUS CHRIST AND HAS COME
[48:05] INTO THIS AGE TO AWAKEN THIS BRIDE.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Glory be to God.
[48:15] Yeah.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; So, well, you think Brother Brown's the
[48:18] Messiah? Nope.
[48:21] He said it wasn't me. I'm not the
[48:22] Messiah. But the Messiah is talking
[48:25] through me.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; He says it's not some man here, the
[48:30] Messiah. It's the Holy Spirit is the
[48:32] Messiah.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same
[48:36] thing.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; And he's here now working in the flesh.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. getting the body ready for
[48:45] rapturing grace.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "See, I'm not the
[48:48] Messiah." He'd act the same way he did
[48:50] when he was on the earth. That's right.
[48:52] He'd do the same thing that when you
[48:54] know when he was on the earth as the
[48:56] Messiah. I'm not the Messiah. And no
[48:58] other man is the Messiah. I'm glad he
[49:00] went ahead and put that out there. And
[49:02] no other man is Messiah. He is Messiah.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; But his spirit dwells in us.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; The Messiah, not me. I'm a man. It's his
[49:12] spirit. The same anointing you feel.
[49:15] That's the same spirit that's here
[49:16] talking. This is just a gift.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Look at what he tells us. THE SAME
[49:20] MESSIAH. OH, I could say this morning
[49:22] that the same Messiah in the form of the
[49:24] Holy Ghost is here right now. You talk
[49:27] about a message, FRIENDS. THE MESSIAH
[49:30] STILL LIVES. HE LIVES TONIGHT. HE'S NOT
[49:32] DEAD. HE'S ALIVE.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF IF BROTHER BRANDHAM COULD ASK
[49:36] WHY SHEPHERDS, I COULD ASK WHY YOU
[49:39] &gt;&gt; IF HE COULD ASK WHY SHEPHERDS. THE SAME
[49:41] ANSWER HE GAVE FOR WHY SHEPHERDS, THAT'S
[49:43] WHY YOU. AMEN. ALL OF THE
[49:46] DISQUALIFICATIONS THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT
[49:47] to yourself. I'm uneducated. I'M
[49:49] UNKNOWING. I'M NOT A BIBLE STUDENT. I'M
[49:51] NOT A SCHOLAR. I SAY THANKS BE TO GOD.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; THANKS BE TO GOD. CUZ YOU WOULD HAVE A
[50:00] WHOLE LOT TO unlearn before you could
[50:02] learn.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Moses had TO GO TO THE BACK SIDE OF THE
[50:04] DESERT 40 YEARS BEFORE GOD COULD EVER
[50:07] USE HIM. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU KNOW. I
[50:09] DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW. I SAID WE
[50:11] OUGHT TO FORGET WHAT WE KNOW SO GOD
[50:13] COULD USE US IN THE WAY HE WANTS TO USE
[50:16] US.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Wayne, when you come to
[50:20] the message, you didn't know nothing. I
[50:21] didn't.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And I really don't steal that feel that
[50:24] I do. But everything that I do know, I
[50:27] got from a prophet.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; So if you got a problem with what I say,
[50:30] you got a problem what he taught.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD CALLED OUT, WE'LL receive
[50:37] the sign. And that was the sign of the
[50:39] Messiah. It's the sign of Messiah is
[50:41] among us. See, brother Brandham was
[50:42] announcing he is here.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You see that? WE ARE MESSIAHS, BUT THE
[50:49] NOT WE are not messiahs, but the Messiah
[50:51] lives in us, which means the anointed
[50:54] one. He's got to anoint us all. Do you
[50:57] see? He's born. Now, now many times we
[51:00] look into this and we say, "Well, Amen.
[51:01] Why shepherds?" Well, that's simple.
[51:03] Shepherds wasn't trained and they
[51:05] wouldn't turn down the message when it
[51:06] came to them.
[51:08] Shepherds would easily believed what God
[51:11] sent angels to tell them.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And you believed what God sent a seventh
[51:16] angel to tell you.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; And you believed it. You received it.
[51:21] You recognized it. And you preach it.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, that same one that
[51:29] said why shepherds also said, "Why
[51:31] Bethlehem?"
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that awesome? Why Bethlehem?
[51:35] Bethlehem wasn't a big place, was it?
[51:37] Y'all y'all ever study Bethlehem?
[51:38] Bethlehem when the prophets when when
[51:40] Joshua was dividing the land, he put
[51:42] Bethlehem and Judah. Made no mention of
[51:44] it. It was so big he made no mention of
[51:46] Bethlehem, but it was in the tribe of
[51:48] Judah. But we find out that when the
[51:50] prophecy came forth, remember he said,
[51:52] "Oh, oh thou Bethlehem littlest among
[51:54] them all." And and God makes prophecy
[51:56] which shows you was in his mind, but it
[51:58] was so small nobody thought about it.
[52:00] But it wasn't thought about until that
[52:02] gentile Rahab founded it. Yeah,
[52:05] &gt;&gt; it's really beautiful when you see Amen.
[52:07] Brother Bam teaching there in why
[52:08] Bethlehem and he said you remember Rahab
[52:10] that gentile when she escaped there from
[52:12] Jericho. She married a general of the
[52:15] army of Israel and they moved to
[52:17] Bethlehem.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; And that's what made Bethlehem what it
[52:21] was. And it become the bread and from
[52:24] Bethlehem that's where Boaz come forth.
[52:27] That's where Ruth come forth. That's
[52:29] where all of those those was born in
[52:31] that same city in Bethlehem. And brother
[52:33] said, "So it was known as the bread
[52:35] center of Israel." And isn't it odd that
[52:38] David was born there AND THE SON OF
[52:41] DAVID, Jesus was born there.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says, "And today," HE
[52:46] SAID, "THAT'S WHERE EVERY SON AND
[52:48] DAUGHTER OF GOD IS BORN is they're born
[52:51] in Bethlehem."
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you love it? Born in Bethlehem.
[52:56] Every one of you IS BORN IN THE SAME
[52:58] PLACE. YOU'RE BORN IN CHRIST. THAT'S WHY
[53:00] IT HAD to be because you're born in
[53:02] Christ. Do you SEE WHAT IT IS? GOD TAKES
[53:05] NOBODIES IN A NOBODY PLACE. AMEN. AND
[53:09] MAKES A PLACE FOR HIS MESSIAH to come
[53:11] upon the earth in their bodies. Maybe
[53:14] small and unknown, but don't say
[53:16] unimportant.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; MAYBE SMALL AND UNKNOWN, BUT DON'T SAY
[53:22] UNIMPORTANT. BECAUSE BY IMPORTANCE, your
[53:24] election was from before the foundation
[53:26] of the world, chosen to be what you are
[53:29] tonight.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you this, brother Bam says
[53:33] in a super sign, that's the message.
[53:36] That's the message this Christmas. The
[53:38] evening lights, the signs of the Messiah
[53:41] accompanying it. Accompanying the
[53:43] message. The evening lights are here.
[53:44] Brother Bam says, "Now, now think of the
[53:47] the terms that Brother Brandham is
[53:48] preaching and super sign." And he's
[53:51] talking about the sign of of a virgin
[53:53] shall conceive from Isaiah 7. And now
[53:55] he's going to turn and say, "This is my
[53:58] Christmas message to you. The evening
[54:01] lights are here."
[54:03] &gt;&gt; See, now he's preaching a Christmas
[54:05] message. His Christmas message is to
[54:08] you. The evening lights are here. That's
[54:12] the message that the angels have sent to
[54:15] the shepherds. The evening light is
[54:17] here. Look in the rise of the sun. I I
[54:19] love this one in uh 1965. Amen. How many
[54:22] ever heard that sermon, the rise of the
[54:24] sun?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's an Easter sermon, right? And
[54:27] in the Easter sermon, Brother Bam calls
[54:29] it quickening power. That's what he's
[54:30] talking about. And he BEGINS TO SAY THAT
[54:33] THE CHURCH has to be dynamics and
[54:35] mechanics, BOTH.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED THEM TO
[54:39] DO THINGS THAT they did. And it hit on
[54:42] 16 cylinders. Why 16? Mark 16. It hit on
[54:45] 16 cylinders. And so will the bride. For
[54:48] he said in John 14:12 that he that
[54:50] believeth on me, the works that I do
[54:52] shall he do also. I give him a charge of
[54:54] my dynamics in their mechanics. In other
[54:57] words, their word is going to get a
[54:59] charge of the spirit and the world will
[55:02] not be able to withstand it and I'll
[55:04] raise him up again in the last day.
[55:06] That's the Easter message. Oh, the same
[55:08] prophet that gave us a Christmas message
[55:11] gave us an Easter message.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; The Christmas message, the evening
[55:15] lights are here. The Easter message, the
[55:17] dynamics and the mechanics are together.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; MY EASTER MESSAGE TO YOU is the word and
[55:26] THE MESSIAH HAVE NOW BECOME ONE. THE
[55:29] SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE WORD OF GOD ARE
[55:32] NOW TOGETHER. THIS IS THE EASTER
[55:34] MESSAGE. I LIVE, BUT NOT ONLY I LIVE, YE
[55:38] LIVE ALSO. WE'RE NOT JUST A WORD CHURCH.
[55:41] WE ARE A WORD THAT IS ALIVE CHURCH. WE
[55:45] ARE THE LIVING MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD
[55:48] THAT WAS WRITTEN IN THIS DAY. WE DON'T
[55:50] JUST GOT A CADILLAC, BROTHER. WE GOT GAS
[55:52] AND FIRE IN THAT CADILLAC.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; You know, you know what brother Ram
[55:55] said? He said, "You can have the best
[55:56] Cadillac in the world." He said, "You
[55:58] can fill it up with gas and everything,
[55:59] but if you ain't got no spark, you ain't
[56:01] going nowhere."
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO
[56:04] SPARK, YOU AIN'T GOT NO. BUT IF YOU GOT
[56:06] SPARK AND you got you got a little water
[56:08] in the gas, it'll just sputter. And
[56:10] brother SAID, "SEE, IF IT'S PURE GOSPEL
[56:13] AND YOU PUT THE FIRE on it, IT OUGHT TO
[56:15] EXPLODE. THERE OUGHT TO BE A MOVEMENT IN
[56:16] IT. BUT IF YOU TAKE THE GOSPEL AND YOU
[56:19] ADD A little with it, you know, I don't
[56:21] believe in that kind of thing, and I
[56:22] don't believe we ought to act like that,
[56:23] and I don't think we ought to do this,
[56:24] and I don't think if you add a little of
[56:26] that, THEN WHEN THE FIRE BEGINS to fall,
[56:29] it just sputters.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Every preacher sitting in here knows
[56:33] what I'm talking about." AND YOU BEGIN
[56:35] TO PREACH the the POWER OF THIS MESSAGE
[56:37] AND YOU GET IN A CHURCH WHERE THERE'S
[56:39] some dynamics in it and you begin to LAY
[56:41] THAT MESSAGE OUT, THERE'S A FIRE THAT'LL
[56:43] DROP DOWN ON THAT. PEOPLE BEGIN TO
[56:45] REJOICE AND SOME STAND AND SOME SHOUT
[56:47] AND PEOPLE BEGIN TO SAY, "WHAT'S THE
[56:48] MATTER WITH THEM PEOPLE?" IT'S BECAUSE
[56:50] THERE'S REAL GASOLINE AND THERE'S REAL
[56:52] FIRE. AMEN. AND SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL,
[56:54] AMEN. WELL, GOLLY." AMEN. WELL, WE DON'T
[56:57] REALLY DO IT LIKE THAT. AMEN. BUT I SAY
[56:59] LIKE THIS. If you want it, get some real
[57:01] gasoline and get some real fire. AND
[57:04] YOU, IT DON'T MATTER IF YOUR CAR IS MADE
[57:06] IN CANADA. IT DON'T MATTER IF YOUR CAR
[57:07] IS MADE IN AFRICA. I DON'T CARE IF THAT
[57:09] CAR IS MADE IN SOUTH AMERICA. YOU IT YOU
[57:12] DON'T MATTER WHERE THE CAR COMES FROM.
[57:14] IF IT'S GASOLINE AND IT'S FIRE, IT'LL
[57:17] STILL RUN, BROTHER. [cheering]
[57:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. COME ON. I DON'T CARE IF
[57:22] YOUR CHURCH IS IN THIS STATE OR ANOTHER
[57:24] COUNTRY. YOU PUT THIS MESSAGE WITH THE
[57:27] FIRE OF GOD AND IT'LL MOVE THE HEART OF
[57:30] THE PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR
[57:32] REVIVAL. WE ARE THE REVIVAL.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT
[57:41] CHRISTMAS TONIGHT.
[57:44] [applause]
[57:45] &gt;&gt; The mechanics without the dynamics won't
[57:47] do you no good.
[57:50] Brother Wayne, we believe the message
[57:52] and without the spirit on it, it will do
[57:54] you no.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having the greatest
[57:59] message on the planet
[58:01] &gt;&gt; and it be no good?
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having the spirit of God
[58:07] moving among you but not have no word
[58:09] for it to fire on?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; One without the other is no good. Right.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; See, watch. You got a Christmas message.
[58:22] You got an Easter message. And And if
[58:25] you're a reader, it sound like it's the
[58:26] same thing. [laughter]
[58:28] It sounds like his Christmas message.
[58:30] And his Easter message is the same
[58:32] thing.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; The Eden lights are here. That's the
[58:35] Christmas message.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Christ is in you, the manger.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And then he turns around and says, "My
[58:40] Easter message is the spirit is on the
[58:42] mechanics
[58:44] &gt;&gt; in invisible union of the bride. He
[58:45] preaches a Thanksgiving message.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; He was covering all the holidays, wasn't
[58:49] he?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And thanksgiving, he says, "My
[58:51] thanksgiving message is the invisible
[58:54] union of the bride in Christ."
[58:59] &gt;&gt; That's the THANKSGIVING MESSAGE.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN an invisible union
[59:05] &gt;&gt; of the bride in Christ. YOU KNOW WHAT
[59:06] HE'S SAYING? THERE'S BEEN A MARRIAGE.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; The spirit HAS COME INTO THE FLESH.
[59:12] AMEN.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Y'all's Bible readers, how many ever
[59:14] read 2 Thessalonians 2
[59:16] &gt;&gt; and you get to reading that there'll be
[59:17] a gathering unto him and then there's
[59:19] going to be a great falling away. You
[59:21] read about it and the Bible says now
[59:23] speaking of the tribulation and he said
[59:25] he that will let will let till he be
[59:27] taken out of the way.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says watch. He said
[59:30] there's two he there.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; There's he God and he the church.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Well the church ain't a he, is it? But
[59:36] brother BRANDON SAYS, "BUT SEE ME IN
[59:39] SECOND THESSALONIANS there has been a
[59:40] marriage. SO THE BRIDE NOW IS NOT CALLED
[59:43] A SHE. SHE'S CALLED A HE."
[59:46] &gt;&gt; SO HE WILL let until he, the bride, BE
[59:48] TAKEN OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE THERE'S
[59:50] BEEN A UNION. SHE IS NOW MISS JESUS
[59:53] CHRIST. SHE IS IDENTIFIED. THAT'S WHY HE
[59:55] SAYS IN THE SEVENTH SEAL, SHE IS
[59:59] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE BROUGHT HIM to the earth.
[1:00:02] Yeah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; The invisible union of the bride of
[1:00:05] Christ. My thanksgiving message to you
[1:00:07] little bride. You never done it
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; in the first place. Amen. See, receiving
[1:00:12] a thanksgiving message. And as we
[1:00:14] receive this Thanksgiving message,
[1:00:16] Brother Bam says that I I love how he
[1:00:18] does things. In 1965, this is this is in
[1:00:21] the invisible union. This is the
[1:00:22] Thanksgiving message. He says, "I pray
[1:00:25] God that the new life will come into
[1:00:26] them. And I pray Lord for across this
[1:00:29] nation around this world where this tape
[1:00:31] will be played that they will also
[1:00:33] receive this thanksgiving message. And I
[1:00:37] know by the hints and things that's been
[1:00:40] thrown in what they must do. I pray
[1:00:43] father you grant it to them.
[1:00:47] You mean brother Brandon was throwing in
[1:00:48] hints?
[1:00:50] So what kind of hints was he putting in
[1:00:52] there brother Wayne? This is the kind of
[1:00:53] hints he was saying. The bride must
[1:00:55] separate from everything. Remember
[1:00:56] scripture in Romans 7, a woman can't
[1:00:59] remarry as long as she has a living
[1:01:00] husband.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; And the living husband is your first
[1:01:02] birth.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; How many knows that?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; That's why there's a denominational
[1:01:07] system because people are born of their
[1:01:09] first birth. And their first birth leans
[1:01:11] to denominationalism.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says, you know who
[1:01:14] your lover is? Is when the word says to
[1:01:16] do something and you don't want to do
[1:01:17] it, then you love the first husband
[1:01:19] rather than him.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; But he says you can separate from the
[1:01:23] first union by death. You can die to
[1:01:26] yourself and separate from whatever
[1:01:29] birth and come into a new land or a new
[1:01:32] life through Christ Jesus. We're not
[1:01:35] looking for something outwardly, BUT
[1:01:37] WE'RE YIELDING OURSELVES to the revealed
[1:01:39] word which brings separation from
[1:01:41] unbelief and an invisible union takes
[1:01:44] place in the heart.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; See, it's a union.
[1:01:48] Amen. Now, here's another one. Brother
[1:01:50] Bram says in wise shepherds I'm going to
[1:01:51] introduce my Christmas message as I'm
[1:01:53] closing now. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:57] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; What a Christmas message.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:02:06] forever. Isn't it odd that his sermons
[1:02:09] on Christmas always get around to a
[1:02:11] present tense God living in the form of
[1:02:14] the bride?
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. because that was what his
[1:02:17] Christmas message was about. That's what
[1:02:20] his message is about.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And sir, as we would see Jesus, brother
[1:02:23] Ram said, Christ himself pointed the
[1:02:26] people to his death. [snorts]
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus never pointed people to his
[1:02:30] birth.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; He pointed them to his death.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Look, if you're if you're a Bible reader
[1:02:35] in John 12, the Greeks come and said,
[1:02:37] "Sers, would we see Jesus?" And Jesus
[1:02:41] never pointed them back to the manger to
[1:02:43] see him. HE SAYS, "IF A CORN OF wheat
[1:02:47] does not go into the ground and die, it
[1:02:50] abideth alone."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Now, what a parable to people that want
[1:02:56] to see Jesus. He pointed to his death,
[1:02:59] his burial, AND HIS RESURRECTION,
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; KNOWING the Gentiles would never see him
[1:03:04] until after he resurrected.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:08] [clears throat]
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we together on that?
[1:03:12] See, he didn't point to a birth.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; He pointed to a death.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Bon says, "See, your life
[1:03:20] and his life find each other not at the
[1:03:23] church or in a building or in a creed or
[1:03:25] in good works, but in the cross."
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; YOU FIND HIM IN THE CROSS.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU are crucified with him, that's
[1:03:36] where you find Christ.
[1:03:39] YOU DON'T FIND HIM BY DOING BETTER.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; OH, WELL, Brother Wayne, you know, I I
[1:03:44] I'd like to get I'd like to get I'd like
[1:03:46] to get closer to the Lord. I'm going to
[1:03:47] start doing better.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; That ain't the way you find him.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; You don't find him by turning a new page
[1:03:53] or starting a new life.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; You don't find Christ like that.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; You find Christ only in death.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Not in a manger, not in a confession,
[1:04:03] not in creeds or fables. YOU DON'T FIND
[1:04:06] CHRIST THERE. A TRUE servant
[1:04:10] can take you to him.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Who did they go
[1:04:15] to? Well, Tim, when them men, when them
[1:04:17] Greeks in the Bible, now I've not left
[1:04:18] my subject. When them men wanted to see
[1:04:20] Jesus, who' they go to? They went to the
[1:04:23] disciples, did they not?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "Today, men
[1:04:27] who want to see Christ goes to his
[1:04:30] servants."
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And if it's a true servant, he can show
[1:04:34] you Christ today.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; So you say, "Well, brother Brandham, if
[1:04:39] Christ is on earth today, a real servant
[1:04:44] would take him to him."
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Well, Christ is here.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; In the form of the word. Do you see what
[1:04:50] he did?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; He just took you to him.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're a theologian, the message
[1:04:57] could never take you to him
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; because you're going to go look for him
[1:05:00] in something else because you ain't
[1:05:02] going to believe that.
[1:05:03] But if you're but if you're of that
[1:05:05] shepherd nature, if you're of the one he
[1:05:07] talked about in the scripture,
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; when a prophet said he's in the word,
[1:05:11] when you go to the word, you know that's
[1:05:13] him.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; The word brings life because he is the
[1:05:17] word. Christ is the word. He is the word
[1:05:19] himself. And a true servant always takes
[1:05:23] you to the word.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Now, he is the word. He is the Bible
[1:05:27] made living. And when you die to
[1:05:30] yourself with Christ like a corn of
[1:05:32] wheat, then the word lives in you. Do
[1:05:35] you see? YOU SAY, "WELL, I WANT TO SEE
[1:05:37] JESUS." He said, "Not to a a cradle." He
[1:05:40] pointed THEM TO A CROSS. BECAUSE IF YOU
[1:05:43] WANT TO SEE HIM, YOU HAVE TO DIE to
[1:05:45] yourself and let the word begin to be
[1:05:48] manifest in you. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[1:05:51] SEE CHRIST IN A MANGER. YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:05:53] SEE CHRIST IN YOURSELF.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Brother man said, "Then
[1:05:58] that word lives in you and it'll BRING
[1:06:00] THE SAME RESULTS AS IT did back there."
[1:06:04] Now, he's the word. God, you say,
[1:06:07] "Brother Wayne, who is the word or who
[1:06:09] is Jesus?" Brother Bam said, "He is the
[1:06:11] word with the true interpretation."
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; The true interpretation of the Bible.
[1:06:17] How many knows the Messiah has the
[1:06:19] interpretation? Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; When Jesus opened the book and he closed
[1:06:22] it, he said this day this scripture is
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and brother B said nobody but the
[1:06:28] Messiah had the interpretation of that
[1:06:30] scripture.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And the same Messiah that interpreted
[1:06:34] the scripture in that place is the one
[1:06:36] interpreting scripture today.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; The bride has the true interpretation of
[1:06:42] the word. Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; When you look out here in Leoa and you
[1:06:47] read how the scripture says that they're
[1:06:49] miserable, blind, wretched, naked, the
[1:06:51] leotans have the interpretation of that.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; That don't belong to us. We're not
[1:06:57] making that live.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; But the bride has the interpretation of
[1:07:00] that true bride church. He has that
[1:07:02] interpretation. And if God is using you
[1:07:05] to interpret his own word, Christ is the
[1:07:08] living interpretation of his word.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my s we would see Jesus 1961.
[1:07:16] Now I'm going to close by saying this in
[1:07:19] these few words. My Christmas message is
[1:07:22] let me point you tonight to the cross
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; and you the corn of wheat fall into
[1:07:28] Christ and die there.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; There you will find his life in his word
[1:07:32] being the same yesterday, today and
[1:07:34] forever. Let that be my Christmas
[1:07:37] message to you.
[1:07:39] I ain't pointing you to a manger or to a
[1:07:41] cradle or to a church or a denomination.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I could preach right there.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; I've had so many people uh ministers
[1:07:52] travel across the planet preaching their
[1:07:54] church,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; preaching their pastor, preaching their
[1:07:57] ideas.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; We need to preach Christ. Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; I pray to God that we're raising men up
[1:08:04] out of this church that don't go out and
[1:08:05] say that that to go out and preach True
[1:08:08] Word Tabernacle is the answer.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; I pray that they preach Christ as the
[1:08:11] answer.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I ain't pointing you to a manger or to a
[1:08:15] cradle or to a church or a denomination.
[1:08:18] People say, "Sir, we would see Jesus."
[1:08:20] I'll point you to them. He points to his
[1:08:23] death, burial, and resurrection. And let
[1:08:25] your corner of wheat fall in there. Let
[1:08:27] his word become real in you and you'll
[1:08:29] see he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:08:32] forever. Do you see? He wasn't pointing
[1:08:34] to a birth. He was pointing to a cross.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And when you crucify yourself and you
[1:08:39] die and you're resurrected, your eyes
[1:08:42] can then see the word of the age. As
[1:08:45] long as you got an idea of what he is,
[1:08:47] the the real the real reality can't live
[1:08:50] in you because you won't receive what he
[1:08:53] is. But when you die to your own thought
[1:08:57] and you die to your own belief and
[1:08:59] mindset and you let him come in, he'll
[1:09:02] open your eyes. Now, and why it had to
[1:09:04] be shepherds, brother Brandham is he's
[1:09:06] such a powerful preacher and he lays
[1:09:08] some powerful things down. And I was
[1:09:10] listening to this the other evening and
[1:09:12] brother Brandham says, "Oh,"
[1:09:15] he says, "Brother Brandom, an angel that
[1:09:17] gave them that message,
[1:09:20] they found it exactly the way the angel
[1:09:23] said it would be and in the place where
[1:09:25] the angel said it would be."
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; When those shepherds ran from that
[1:09:30] angel's message, the scripture said they
[1:09:33] ran down and they found it the way it
[1:09:37] had been told them. Yeah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Do you see tonight
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; we've heard the message
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; that the Messiah is in you?
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Have you died out enough to see it's
[1:09:52] true?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Have you died out to your to to to your
[1:09:56] own person to see it's true? Have you
[1:10:00] died out from that? Oh, I'm nobody and I
[1:10:02] could never be nobody and I ARE YOU
[1:10:04] GOING TO DIE out to that to see it's
[1:10:06] true? People say, "WELL, DEITY IS only
[1:10:09] in heaven. ARE YOU GOING TO DIE TO that
[1:10:10] to see the message is true?"
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; CHRIST is in you. Brother Bam says it
[1:10:16] like this and super sign. Oh, today
[1:10:17] pilgrim brother, my sister, believe the
[1:10:19] sign. Look into the manger of your own
[1:10:22] heart.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; And see if you are able to say within
[1:10:26] yourself the sign that the shepherds
[1:10:28] sing. God in the flesh is dwelling
[1:10:31] amongst the poor AND THE NEEDY AND THE
[1:10:34] OFFCAST. SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
[1:10:36] God is in your heart. God is here.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; See if you can look IN YOUR OWN HEART
[1:10:41] AND SEE THE MESSAGE IS TRUE.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a this isn't just a
[1:10:49] story. Amen. This gift of Christ in you,
[1:10:53] it cost God something.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham threatened to
[1:10:57] preach a sermon called the on the
[1:10:59] street.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; How many ever How many ever say it? He
[1:11:03] said, "I I I think I'll preach a sermon
[1:11:04] called the on the street." Well,
[1:11:06] he didn't. He preached a God's uh
[1:11:08] provided gifts or something that along
[1:11:09] that title. But then he told the story
[1:11:11] in the end of it, and he tells a story
[1:11:14] about a about an old man in New York
[1:11:16] City that had a wife and a and a baby
[1:11:18] girl, a young girl, and he tells about
[1:11:21] they were really poor. How many ever
[1:11:23] hear it?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh four or five of you, then
[1:11:28] y'all help me along. And and brother
[1:11:30] Bham tells a story about that and he
[1:11:32] says the old fell couldn't afford he
[1:11:34] said a good doll or anything. He said
[1:11:36] matter of fact they couldn't afford
[1:11:37] nothing. So the sickness come on the
[1:11:39] mother and he said he really couldn't
[1:11:41] even afford the doctor bills and the
[1:11:42] mother had died long about Christmas
[1:11:44] season
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; and said and then the baby itself was
[1:11:47] sick and said daddy I I just want a doll
[1:11:50] for Christmas. and said the old fella
[1:11:52] didn't have the money, so he was saving
[1:11:53] along trying to get it. And brother
[1:11:55] Justin, you know, he'd saved up good
[1:11:57] money, the best he could. And brother
[1:11:59] said he didn't have much and it wasn't
[1:12:00] much he needed, but he got all he could
[1:12:02] get to get it. And he said he went down
[1:12:04] on Christmas night and bought the doll.
[1:12:06] He said it was real cold in New York
[1:12:08] City and blizzards blowing in and
[1:12:09] things. He said people in the city was
[1:12:11] all rush and everything. Nobody even
[1:12:12] knew really what was happening. And he
[1:12:14] said he went over there and he and he
[1:12:15] bought that doll and he said he got to
[1:12:17] walking around the street with that
[1:12:18] doll. And he said he got to stumbling
[1:12:20] around a little bit and he said a
[1:12:21] policeman stopped him in the middle of
[1:12:23] this of this alley and he said to him
[1:12:24] said, "Sir, what are you doing?" He
[1:12:25] said, "Well," he said, "I bought this
[1:12:27] doll." And he said, "I'm going to take
[1:12:28] it to my to my daughter." Now, that
[1:12:31] daughter had died a few days before
[1:12:34] Christmas. And but this old man was so
[1:12:37] taken with the idea that his that his
[1:12:40] baby girl had never had a doll for
[1:12:42] Christmas. So he bought that dome, was
[1:12:45] walking around on Christmas night
[1:12:47] looking for his daughter. And brother
[1:12:49] Bam said them policeman, he said they
[1:12:51] thought he was drunk. He said, Brother
[1:12:52] Bam said he wasn't drunk. He said the
[1:12:54] old fella was so far gone in his I'm
[1:12:57] going to get this baby. I'm going to get
[1:12:59] this doll to my baby girl. I'm going I
[1:13:01] bought the I bought the doll for you.
[1:13:02] Last thing she wanted was a doll. I
[1:13:04] bought the doll for you. And brother Bam
[1:13:06] said he went off into the night in just
[1:13:08] like a a stereo, you know, didn't kind
[1:13:10] of out of his head. Didn't know what he
[1:13:11] was doing. when the next morning they
[1:13:13] found him, snow blowed over him and he
[1:13:15] he had froze to death in the in the
[1:13:17] street that night looking for his doll
[1:13:19] for his baby girl. And brother Bam said
[1:13:21] when the policeman he said went over it
[1:13:23] was the same policeman had sent him the
[1:13:24] night before. He said, "Oh, I know who
[1:13:26] that man is." And they rolled him over
[1:13:28] and he had that doll and he had that
[1:13:30] doll tucked up under his heart.
[1:13:33] And the old policeman said, "Well, I
[1:13:36] guess he took his doll to his daughter."
[1:13:39] And brother Bam said, "Do you see there
[1:13:42] was no way
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; to get the gift of that doll to the
[1:13:46] daughter without dying himself
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; because she had been out of reach?"
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And the gift that God has
[1:13:55] promised the church,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; he could never get to us without a
[1:13:59] death."
[1:14:01] So he took upon himself the cross
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and there he brought the gift of the
[1:14:07] spirit
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; and gave it to the church. Amen. I
[1:14:10] wonder tonight if our musicians could
[1:14:12] come.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; He brought to us a gift
[1:14:20] that only he could die for.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I want to
[1:14:27] receive his gift.
[1:14:31] I want to receive the gift that God has
[1:14:33] sent into this age.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Can you look in that heart tonight
[1:14:40] and see what the messenger said was
[1:14:42] there?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; That little song we had mentioned, Ben,
[1:14:52] we could just play that.
[1:14:55] We stand tonight together. why it had to
[1:14:57] be shepherds.
[1:15:00] Brother Bam said, "I offer myself to God
[1:15:02] tonight with all of my heart
[1:15:05] and all that's in me."
[1:15:08] I wonder tonight if you
[1:15:11] could feel that same way.
[1:15:14] If Brother Brandham could do that, I
[1:15:16] imagine we could.
[1:15:18] I want to offer tonight. I want to offer
[1:15:20] myself to God tonight
[1:15:23] with all my heart,
[1:15:25] with all that's within me. I don't have
[1:15:28] very much to give. I can't bring a
[1:15:30] frankincense or a myrr or gold cuz I
[1:15:33] don't have any.
[1:15:35] But all I have is in myself that God
[1:15:37] gave me [music] his life. And I
[1:15:40] dedicated Aresh tonight.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; I dedicated Aresh tonight.
[1:15:47] Oh, dear God.
[1:15:50] What can I do? Help me from my
[1:15:52] shepherds. Help me and these other
[1:15:54] shepherds, Lord, around the [music]
[1:15:55] world. Shepherds of the word to proclaim
[1:15:58] it in this next year. Lord, help us.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Give us thy love and thy spirit. Lord,
[1:16:04] as we dedicate ourselves tonight to thy
[1:16:06] word
[1:16:09] and to thy call,
[1:16:12] I wonder tonight,
[1:16:15] I wonder if you might want to do that.
[1:16:17] You want to dedicate your life.
[1:16:20] Maybe you're here tonight. You're
[1:16:22] visiting in this place and
[1:16:25] you've never gave your life to Jesus
[1:16:27] Christ.
[1:16:29] I wonder tonight maybe you [music] would
[1:16:31] like to say, "Brother Wayne, I'd like to
[1:16:33] surrender to him.
[1:16:36] I'd like to surrender [music] my life.
[1:16:40] I'd like to give my life to him." God
[1:16:43] bless you, honey. [music]
[1:16:45] God bless you.
[1:16:49] Maybe just by the uplifting hand, you'd
[1:16:51] say it right now. Brother Wayne,
[1:16:52] remember me in prayer now.
[1:16:55] I'd like to
[1:17:00] as you [music] stand here tonight. I
[1:17:01] know I'm looking at many Christians.
[1:17:04] Many of you long experienced in God. You
[1:17:09] you as the prophet had has seen the
[1:17:12] Messiah there.
[1:17:15] But right here in this building tonight,
[1:17:16] you say, "Well, I'd like to consecrate
[1:17:18] myself." And this is what I found myself
[1:17:20] [music]
[1:17:21] in this super sign. I found myself
[1:17:24] saying to the Lord
[1:17:27] God, I want to I want to dedicate myself
[1:17:29] a new
[1:17:32] tonight, Lord.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; I want to a new tonight, Lord. [music]
[1:17:43] When's the last time you just said,
[1:17:44] "Lord, it's all yours,
[1:17:47] all my hopes and all my dreams." [music]
[1:17:50] I want to consecrate to you tonight,
[1:17:52] Lord.
[1:17:54] While the world is celebrating
[1:17:56] Christmas, let us
[1:17:58] let us adore him tonight.
[1:18:00] [clears throat]
[1:18:01] Let us welcome him in a in a new way in
[1:18:05] our spirit.
[1:18:06] little things you've been struggling
[1:18:08] with that's been taking preeminence,
[1:18:10] your heart getting a little hard and you
[1:18:13] find that tenderness is slipping away
[1:18:15] from you. Won't you right here tonight
[1:18:18] consecrate? Say, Lord, I want to
[1:18:19] consecrate. I want to dedicate to you
[1:18:23] while we do this right now. Maybe maybe
[1:18:25] you want to step out of your chair and
[1:18:26] come up here around the altar tonight.
[1:18:28] You you [clears throat] just say, "I
[1:18:30] want to make a sign. And I I I want a
[1:18:32] sign before heaven that I'm going to
[1:18:33] consecrate my heart a new tonight.
[1:18:39] Your heart's full of the Holy Ghost. You
[1:18:41] know that. But you just want to
[1:18:43] consecrate a new tonight.
[1:18:46] I want to make that dedication tonight
[1:18:48] to you, Lord.
