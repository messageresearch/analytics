[7:20] morning certainly a privilege to be here
[7:23] with you today amen and uh I was just
[7:26] noticing unless there's been a huge
[7:28] change I've just noticed and looked out
[7:30] the window just before I came out and
[7:31] the Sun was shining so amen so I I knew
[7:34] that'd be a little relief amen amen uh
[7:39] sometimes you know uh we we just uh like
[7:42] to bring a good report amen and uh we
[7:46] thank the Lord for the report that he's
[7:48] given us in this age and time and what a
[7:51] blessing that it is amen I don't know
[7:53] how many of you was with us last night
[7:55] but we just certainly had a wonderful
[7:57] time in the Lord and and the the grace
[7:59] that he shown amen don't we appreciate
[8:02] the presence of God Amen and what he
[8:05] does for us and wonderful and amen and
[8:08] uh I didn't even get a chance to greet
[8:11] our friends from Canada uh last night
[8:13] God bless you Billy Gordon appreciate
[8:15] seeing you all and amen the different
[8:17] ones that was able to be there last
[8:18] night we certainly appreciate the uh
[8:21] amen the support to this morning if we
[8:24] can uh let's just turn in our Bibles and
[8:27] I'd like to maybe just read from the
[8:30] same section of scripture that I read
[8:31] last night uh in Romans the 10th chapter
[8:35] uh if you were there
[8:39] um we got about about onethird of the
[8:43] way into the thought and the Lord just
[8:45] took it over and then there we went amen
[8:48] so uh amen I I appreciate when God does
[8:52] that kind of thing amen and amen and uh
[8:56] we just want
[8:58] to read from here this
[9:01] morning in Romans chapter
[9:05] 10 and let's look at the 11th verse for
[9:09] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[9:11] upon Him shall not be ashamed for there
[9:15] is no difference between the Jew and the
[9:18] Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich
[9:21] unto all that call upon him now for
[9:25] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[9:28] the Lord
[9:29] shall be
[9:31] saved how then shall they call on him in
[9:35] whom they have not believed and how
[9:38] shall they believe in him of whom they
[9:41] have not heard and how shall they hear
[9:44] without a preacher now how shall they
[9:46] preach except they be sent as it is
[9:49] written how beautiful are the feet of
[9:51] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[9:54] bring Glad Tidings of good things but
[9:57] they have not all obeyed the gospel for
[10:00] Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our
[10:04] report so then Faith cometh by the
[10:07] hearing and the hearing by the word of
[10:11] God let's just bow our hearts faithful
[10:14] Lord we thank you this morning we thank
[10:16] you for the word of life and the truth
[10:18] in this age and Lord for a heart to
[10:21] believe it Lord where would we be this
[10:24] morning if there wasn't something in us
[10:26] that we this message was Lord with a
[10:29] certainty and father I I thank you so
[10:33] much for what you have sent in this time
[10:35] that we're living we ask you father this
[10:37] morning that you would take your word
[10:39] that you would bless this Congregation
[10:41] of people that have gathered here Lord
[10:43] and truly we've come here to worship you
[10:46] we've come here to Lord to find
[10:49] ourselves closer to you and Lord we're
[10:52] asking you this morning that you would
[10:54] just lead us in the paths of
[10:55] righteousness for thy name's sake we ask
[10:58] it in Jesus mighty name amen and amen
[11:02] may God bless you this morning as you
[11:04] are seated uh I want to maybe just speak
[11:07] to you a little bit today upon accepting
[11:11] our Liberty accepting our Liberty um
[11:15] I've been uh just Thursday night of
[11:17] course I'm in the series of Matthews and
[11:19] I just to be honest with you it just
[11:21] left me just like that and I'm not a
[11:23] cold Theologian so I I try to follow the
[11:26] inspiration so maybe we'll get back to
[11:28] it and next week I've got a bunch of
[11:30] things on it so we'll see but uh but uh
[11:33] but I uh just some things that was
[11:35] dealing with my heart and I got to
[11:36] preaching on true worship and found some
[11:39] quotes and things that really was
[11:40] blessing me and so uh just just moving
[11:43] into that but I uh spoke last night to
[11:46] the congregation there at brother
[11:47] Jonathan's in the meeting many of you
[11:49] were there we were actually speaking on
[11:52] receiving adoption Authority and uh but
[11:55] this morning I want to preach on
[11:56] accepting our Liberty and I'm praying
[11:58] that that we're able to uh maybe just
[12:00] make a small connection here this
[12:02] morning with you up adoption and Liberty
[12:05] because I think that it's sometimes we
[12:07] maybe maybe don't catch some of the
[12:09] things that the prophet would say and
[12:11] I'm myself speaking of and then as he
[12:13] says things it just gets more relevant
[12:16] and more real all the time as we go and
[12:19] and looking into U looking into the
[12:21] scripture of course this morning we're
[12:23] speaking and we're reading here from
[12:25] Romans the 10th chapter when Paul says
[12:27] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[12:28] Lord shall be saved but then who could
[12:30] call on him that that didn't know him or
[12:33] haven't known him how could they
[12:34] actually call on him and whom they
[12:36] haven't heard and then yet how could
[12:39] they hear without a preacher and then
[12:41] how could a preacher preach unless he be
[12:43] sent amen and then if he is sin if he's
[12:46] called of God he will actually preach
[12:48] the message of the age that he's living
[12:51] in he actually cannot speak something
[12:53] different if he's called of God to
[12:55] preach he would have to preach the
[12:56] season and the time that he was actually
[12:59] called to be in and to look to see that
[13:02] the scripture would say Amen that that
[13:04] Faith cometh by the hearing and by the
[13:06] hearing of the word of God so everything
[13:08] God has for the generation will be
[13:10] delivered to them by the preaching of
[13:12] the Gospel it's clear to us that will
[13:14] not be any more sacrifice Christ will
[13:17] not be taken any more weapons for our
[13:19] healings there will be no more Bloodshed
[13:21] for our sins there'll be no more cross
[13:23] there'll be no more judgment he will not
[13:25] have to return to hell again amen but
[13:27] all of these things have already been a
[13:29] finished work and today we believe the
[13:32] only way we can receive for them is our
[13:35] faith according to that finished work
[13:37] and that faith is actually generated or
[13:40] brought To Us by the preaching of the
[13:42] word that preaches of a finished work
[13:45] now to preach this message just in a
[13:47] cold inspiration or just a an
[13:49] intellectual way is not preaching the
[13:51] Gospel of Jesus Christ but the Gospel of
[13:54] Jesus Christ is preaching a Living
[13:56] manifested Word that brings a liberty to
[14:00] the church to know that God will do
[14:02] exactly what he said to do and there is
[14:04] some people that actually believes that
[14:06] that the word of the age is quickened
[14:08] and that quickened word is where God has
[14:10] called his church to to bring forth its
[14:15] Liberty in that church at that time now
[14:18] everything that you already have has
[14:20] been paid for and that that what you're
[14:22] going to receive from that is that the
[14:24] preaching of the word the inspiration of
[14:26] the word will bring to you those things
[14:28] which have been given now I want to just
[14:30] review just a second here and God has
[14:33] actually did something wonderful in that
[14:35] God gives all these but he gives them in
[14:38] Seasons so everything God has for the
[14:41] church he actually has in season God
[14:43] works in season God works in times we
[14:46] can go all the way through the
[14:47] scriptures there's so many scriptures
[14:49] but you could go to Daniel 12 and see he
[14:51] said shut it up until the time of the
[14:52] end you can go to Revelations 10 and
[14:54] you'll find that all the great wondrous
[14:57] things that John saw he was told to seal
[14:59] it up until the seventh angel would
[15:01] begin to sound so God actually works
[15:04] within a Time according to Psalms 102
[15:07] that the Lord would actually appear in
[15:09] his glory at the time that Zion was
[15:12] built up and when the Church of the
[15:14] Living God comes to the stature of the
[15:16] perfect man that God would appear to
[15:18] them there in his glory amen and we find
[15:21] that of course the scripture tells us
[15:23] that in John CH 12 that unless a corn
[15:26] would fall in the ground it would die it
[15:28] would abide alone but if it would die it
[15:30] will bring forth much fruit knowing that
[15:33] in in John 12 the people wanted to see
[15:36] Jesus and Jesus told them Greeks at that
[15:38] time you cannot see me now but when the
[15:41] corn goes in the ground and comes back
[15:43] again then when you're going to see me
[15:45] of course he's speaking of Luke 17:30
[15:48] when the day the son of man shall be
[15:50] revealed the Gentiles will have their
[15:53] opportunity to see Christ in his
[15:55] manifested glory at that day amen
[15:58] they'll be able to see him see God sets
[16:01] times when he told Sarah I will visit
[16:03] you according to the time that was the
[16:06] time that God gave her a body change
[16:08] amen there's a time when God in job said
[16:11] he would hide him in the grave until his
[16:13] time would come and then he would give
[16:15] him a resurrection there's a time that
[16:17] God said I will arise and have mercy up
[16:21] on Zion the time of her favor the set
[16:24] time has come my I think this morning
[16:26] it's kind of hard to get past scriptures
[16:28] like that Ain it there's a time that
[16:30] God's going to favor the church amen
[16:32] there's a time that he's going to appear
[16:34] unto them and I I I hope that Amen in in
[16:37] repetition that we catch that this is
[16:40] the time of the favor of God if you know
[16:42] the time that you're living in you know
[16:44] that you're working in the plan of God
[16:46] you're not here doing these things by
[16:48] yourself I'm not just a preacher trying
[16:51] to bring something or manufacture
[16:53] something or amen but all God is looking
[16:55] for is some men that'll get out of the
[16:58] way to preach the word of this age and
[17:00] its manifested power and glory and
[17:02] there's a God here this morning that'll
[17:04] back up this word we're not standing
[17:06] here trying to make something happen
[17:09] amen something is happening and I'm only
[17:11] here Amen to tell you the things that I
[17:13] see God doing and happening and it's and
[17:16] it's actually going in if you remember
[17:18] back about a year ago we actually said
[17:20] to the church I believe we're changing
[17:22] levels I believe that your that your
[17:23] floor amen your ceiling will become your
[17:26] floor amen and and you know in in saying
[17:28] that sometimes people think well brother
[17:30] Wayne thinks he's going to lead a a
[17:32] higher level or something no that wasn't
[17:33] even what I was saying what I was saying
[17:35] was is I feel a change in the church and
[17:38] amen I wasn't trying to prophesy what I
[17:40] think is going to be I'm only announcing
[17:43] what I am experiencing and what is
[17:45] happening in the church and sometimes
[17:47] God is doing Miracles Among Us amen but
[17:50] we're not recognizing what he's doing
[17:52] then it happens and it never helps us
[17:55] but if we could only know and realize
[17:57] that God is changing ing lives and
[17:59] hearts and and manifesting His glory and
[18:01] his power amen I'll tell you when things
[18:04] begin to be known we begin to receive
[18:06] things amen when we look at this for the
[18:08] time amen that we believe the hour of
[18:11] favor has come amen I believe that I'm
[18:14] sorry if if I'm wrong but I believe that
[18:16] I believe the hour of God's favor is
[18:19] upon the church I believe that it's our
[18:22] season of redemption I believe it's our
[18:24] season of blessing I believe it's our
[18:27] season of God doing great things among
[18:29] us and I don't know about you amen but I
[18:32] don't want somebody else to live my
[18:33] season I don't want somebody else to
[18:36] have the things that God has promised me
[18:38] and for my age I know Moses had a
[18:40] wonderful age and Joshua had a wonderful
[18:42] Age and and I know Paul had a wonderful
[18:44] time all of the disciples had their age
[18:47] and their time but this is not their
[18:49] time this is actually your time and if
[18:52] we could only catch this they everyone
[18:55] longed to see this day and did not see
[18:58] but blessed be your eyes and blessed be
[19:01] your ears for you're the one that sees
[19:03] this message you're the one that hears
[19:05] the things that God has had shut up in
[19:08] the book from the foundation of the
[19:10] world Amen to think this morning we are
[19:12] to shake ourselves and recognize that
[19:15] this day this message this hour is the
[19:18] greatest of all Revelation that has ever
[19:21] been given to the church and there is no
[19:23] greater prevailing power than the power
[19:26] of Revelation to receive the revelation
[19:29] of God this morning is to receive the
[19:32] Liberty that you have been looking
[19:35] for ah the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[19:38] that's what Jesus said Jesus said the
[19:41] spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach
[19:44] the acceptable year of the Lord y'all
[19:45] remember amen I I i' I've preached it
[19:48] here at the church and I just want to
[19:49] maybe bring this into your memory if
[19:51] you're visiting this morning you maybe
[19:53] hear uh uh the spirit in that in Luke
[19:55] chapter 4 Jesus will say the spirit of
[19:58] the Lord is upon me and he says it's
[20:00] here an anoint to me to preach the
[20:03] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[20:05] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[20:06] Deliverance to the captive to recover
[20:08] the side of the blind to set at Liberty
[20:10] them that are bruised to preach the
[20:12] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[20:14] closed the book and gave it again to the
[20:16] ministers and all of their eyes fell
[20:18] upon him and the synagogue were fastened
[20:21] on him and he began to say unto them
[20:23] this day this scripture is
[20:27] fulfilled in your
[20:29] ears isn't that awesome in your ears
[20:33] amen it was being fulfilled because they
[20:34] were hearing it it was being fulfilled
[20:37] in their ears they were hearing a
[20:38] Vindicated word saying this is the
[20:41] season the Lord is on me for this season
[20:44] now it's it's it's a phenomenal to me
[20:46] because I I I've I've studied the
[20:49] scripture back and forth looking for any
[20:51] other place but I haven't found it but
[20:53] this is actually the place it changes
[20:55] from the trumpet of Jubilee to the
[20:57] preaching of of the Gospel uh until this
[21:00] time in the Scripture it was that a
[21:02] jubilee horn would be used to announce
[21:05] Jubilee y'all remember what Jubilee is
[21:06] I'm not going to teach on it so but
[21:08] Jubilee was a time every 50 years they
[21:10] would sound a trumpet and the people
[21:12] would be free to return back to their
[21:14] possessions now there's something that's
[21:16] very key in this
[21:18] point because the key to it is is that
[21:21] the children of God who were returning
[21:24] in the 50th year they were returning to
[21:26] their possessions now they were actually
[21:28] Sons amen of Israel and they had a place
[21:32] they belonged so under the Jubilee
[21:34] trumpet they was not returning to
[21:36] something that they didn't belong to
[21:38] them but they had been being held
[21:40] bondage or hostage under a servitude of
[21:43] some some debt old and when the jubilees
[21:47] sounded they returned back to their
[21:50] inheritance see they returned back to
[21:52] the liberty of their inheritance it
[21:56] wasn't something that wasn't theirs it
[21:58] wasn't something that didn't belong to
[22:00] them it was just something they couldn't
[22:02] possess because of a debt that was owed
[22:04] against it but under the sounding in
[22:06] that Jubilee it brought them a liberty
[22:08] to return that's why in John chapter 8
[22:11] when the scripture said for the who the
[22:12] son has set free is free indeed and and
[22:16] the scripture will go on to say for the
[22:18] servant abideth not in the house forever
[22:21] but the Son and the prophet said what
[22:23] Jesus is saying there is the servant had
[22:26] no inheritance in the house do you see
[22:29] people who worked in the fields and
[22:31] people who were servants to a farm they
[22:34] had no inheritance in that land now they
[22:36] were being paid but no inheritance so if
[22:39] they were taken out into slavery when
[22:41] the Jubilee trumpet sounded they
[22:43] couldn't return because they had no
[22:45] Heritage they had no inheritance but
[22:48] Sons on the other hand could return to
[22:50] what the father had give them under the
[22:53] sound of that Jubilee and to think that
[22:55] in this scripture Jesus is saying that
[22:57] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to
[23:00] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[23:02] changing it from the sounding of a horn
[23:05] to the preaching of the Gospel so the
[23:08] preaching of the Gospel is what's going
[23:10] to release Sons to go back to their
[23:14] inheritance that was originally Theirs
[23:16] to begin with oh come on Church you
[23:19] didn't become a son you always were a
[23:21] son amen but you were under the bondage
[23:24] of a servitude amen you see God has got
[23:28] a liberty for the church that goes
[23:30] beyond just a just a freedom it goes
[23:33] beyond is a returning to everything that
[23:36] God has gave to you everything that is
[23:38] owed amen against it will be smitten off
[23:42] you shall return to your possessions of
[23:44] course a prophet will announce by this
[23:46] in the 10 virgins he said when the
[23:48] trumpet sounds he said I tell every one
[23:50] of you take visible our audience the one
[23:53] that serve in sin the day of sin is
[23:56] over that's what it actually meant the
[23:58] day of sin is over the day of unbelief
[24:02] has finished the day of unbelief
[24:05] finishes in other words when the trumpet
[24:07] sounds in the Scripture it was a gospel
[24:10] it was a trumpet of a horn but Jesus
[24:13] made it the gospel and when this gospel
[24:15] trumpet begins to sound the day of sin
[24:19] is over the day of sin is finished amen
[24:21] the seventh seal ends all things amen I
[24:25] really want to preach on the seventh
[24:26] seal this morning forgive me but but
[24:27] it's in my it's it's in my notes but I I
[24:30] couldn't get the inspiration I wanted to
[24:31] preach on it but the seven seal ends all
[24:34] things you see what it does it brings an
[24:37] End Amen to the servitude or the sin of
[24:41] Our Lives it brings an end to the
[24:43] bondage of not knowing who we are not
[24:45] knowing where we belong not knowing what
[24:47] we're supposed to be doing amen but the
[24:50] seven seal opens up the mind of God and
[24:53] brings the mind of God through the
[24:55] preaching of the word which we lets us
[24:57] turned back to what we were in the mind
[25:00] of God can you imagine this morning if
[25:02] you really went to the mind of God what
[25:05] you're supposed to be what you're
[25:07] supposed to be doing what God has given
[25:09] you by the mind of God this morning I
[25:11] tell you what every fear would die every
[25:14] doubt would die every unbelief would die
[25:17] every thought that I can't make it every

[25:23] it with every bit die in the presence of
[25:25] the word of God this word is has been
[25:28] sent to destroy the works of the devil
[25:31] and has filled your mind and your heart
[25:33] to say I can't do it I won't make it if
[25:36] I'm not able to do it but if you would
[25:38] just hear the message of the hour it is
[25:41] a message of Deliverance it's a message
[25:44] of Liberty it's a message of adoption

[28:44] blessing bride we are not a blessing
[28:47] woman who has run from the bedroom of

[29:17] bondage no longer how long amen there
[29:21] was every man could go free if he wanted
[29:23] to go
[29:25] free that's right
[29:28] second Corinthians the third chapter
[29:30] Paul now listen Paul is the
[29:35] right don't think he wrote about it one
[29:39] time Paul his greatest Revelation was
[29:43] the spiritual adoption of the
[29:45] church 2 Corinthians 3 Paul said amen
[29:48] introducing the administration of Glory
[29:51] remember the changing of the
[29:53] administration coming to the
[29:54] administration of Glory not being
[29:56] ministers of the spirit law or the
[29:59] letter but Ministers of the
[30:01] spirit and if the administration of the
[30:04] law was glorious how much more Glory
[30:08] will it be under this administration of
[30:10] when the spirit writes the word in the
[30:13] people that's right see then he says in
[30:16] 2 Corinthians 3 but if the minds are
[30:18] blinded unto this day remaineth the same
[30:21] Veil untaken away in the reading of the
[30:23] Old Testament which Veil is done away in
[30:25] Christ but under this today even when
[30:28] Moses is read the veil is upon their
[30:30] heart so they can they can read about it
[30:32] but they can't see it because the veil
[30:34] that's upon them but watch The Veil is
[30:37] upon what now watch this second
[30:39] Corinthians 3:15 where's the veil it's
[30:41] on their
[30:42] heart right the veil is on the heart the
[30:45] very next verse 2 Corinthians 3:16 but
[30:48] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[30:51] Lord I know y'all know these things when
[30:54] it shall turn to the Lord what is the it
[30:57] it when the heart when it the heart
[31:01] shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be
[31:05] taken
[31:06] away now now Paul amen knows very well
[31:10] the last Prophecy of the Old Testament
[31:14] was behold I will send you
[31:17] Elijah before the great and grateful day
[31:19] of the Lord and He will do what he will
[31:22] turn the heart of their Apostolic
[31:25] fathers or back to the faith of their
[31:26] father fathers Paul knew the hearts were
[31:29] going to be changed faith of the fathers
[31:32] now now there there's not time enough
[31:34] but so that you maybe catch this you can
[31:35] go study it amen but if you will study
[31:38] Abraham brother mam said actually was
[31:40] the true father of our faith he said see
[31:43] then the message actually takes us all
[31:45] the way back to the founding father of
[31:49] our faith back to an abrahamic faith is
[31:52] that right now you watch Abraham and
[31:54] Isaac when Isaac was up on the mountain
[31:56] with Abraham and gen Genesis 22 and he
[31:58] was going to be sacrificed remember now
[32:01] that before they ever went up there what
[32:03] did Abraham say he said the boy and I
[32:06] will go up and
[32:09] worship we'll go worship and then the
[32:12] boy and I will return amen Abraham was
[32:15] going to go worship under a revelation
[32:18] that God is going to make me sacrifice
[32:20] this child but even if I would kill him
[32:23] he's going to raise him up again because
[32:25] I've already received as one from the
[32:28] dead he was worshiping with a revelation
[32:31] of a Vindicated God whatever God says
[32:34] just do it he's got enough to make it
[32:36] come out we don't have to raise up Isaac
[32:39] he can raise Isaac up we just got to be
[32:42] obedient to his word when they went up
[32:44] there on that mountain amen and they
[32:46] found themselves amen up there I always
[32:49] wondered what in the world made Isaac
[32:51] laid down his life brother man said he
[32:53] put out them little chubby hands
[32:54] remember and he willingly laid down on
[32:57] on that altar can you imagine the story
[32:59] that was told him to make him give up
[33:01] his own life amen you you see Abraham
[33:04] could tell him a story in Genesis 22
[33:07] that he couldn't have told in Genesis 15
[33:09] or in Genesis 12 but Abraham had already
[33:13] lived his whole life he had already met
[33:15] the angel he had already talked with
[33:17] mecdc he had already seen a body change
[33:20] he had already seen ishmail come and
[33:22] tried it the wrong way he saw how that
[33:25] Isaac had come had lived with him 14
[33:27] years he had a story from the front to
[33:30] the Finish to Quicken the faith of Isaac
[33:34] in one message and Isaac received the
[33:37] Liberty to get in his position by the
[33:41] preaching of a compiled message that
[33:44] gave him Faith a faith to lay down his
[33:47] life knowing God would raise it up again
[33:49] do you see the message of the hour on
[33:51] that mountain how could you ever give
[33:53] your life up how could you ever lay your
[33:55] life down but God is compiled every
[33:58] Revelation Through the Ages this message
[34:01] couldn't have been preached in no other
[34:03] age but right here in the end time God
[34:06] has took the whole story from Eden all
[34:09] the way to this age and tied it together
[34:11] and when you heard
[34:13] it it quickened something on the inside
[34:16] of you that said God I want my position
[34:20] I want my authority if I would just lay
[34:23] down my life he will raise it up again
[34:27] Isaac would have received
[34:29] Faith he would have received a faith his
[34:32] heart would have been
[34:34] turned a father's faith become a child's
[34:37] Faith which lifted the child to his
[34:40] father's
[34:42] understanding through the things that he
[34:46] heard oh Church of the Living God how is
[34:49] God going to get you from this
[34:50] Pentecostal baby stuff into the maturity
[34:53] of the word of God he's going to do it
[34:55] by the things that you heard
[34:57] you know what's amazing to me amen when
[34:59] you say something like that there's been
[35:01] so many Devils that's took good worship
[35:03] services and called it Pentecostal baby
[35:05] stuff until people started believing it
[35:08] but that ain't nothing but a bunch of
[35:09] devils trying to Black name the worship
[35:12] of Jesus Christ this has nothing to do
[35:15] with Pentecostal baby stuff this is what
[35:17] you call stimulation of a revelation the
[35:20] greatest Revelation that's ever struck
[35:23] the Earth has struck our hearts how can
[35:25] we sit still in such an hour as this how
[35:29] can we just hold our peace in an hour
[35:31] like this there's never been a greater
[35:33] word spoken to any age at any time it's
[35:37] running through our lives it's running

[36:16] receive Jesus Christ until the
[36:18] restitution of all things and a
[36:20] refreshing from the presence of God the

[40:22] dead letters there's no we can't put
[40:24] enough things together to Astound our
[40:26] elves to a change but the changing of
[40:28] the heart comes from the presence of God
[40:31] when God quickens a word to you it
[40:33] forever changes
[40:38] you Revelations 10 says in the days of
[40:41] the voice of the seventh angel Jesus
[40:44] said the anointing of the Lord is upon
[40:45] me to preach the gospel the season was
[40:48] then it was at the time of the opening
[40:50] of the book the book is actually opened
[40:54] in the time of Revelation chap 10
[40:56] but it's not revealed until the seventh
[40:59] angel
[41:00] sounds and when he begins to sound he
[41:03] reveals what was in the book now how
[41:06] does he reveal it by the
[41:09] preaching of the
[41:11] message all of your possessions is in
[41:15] that book when you hear the message
[41:18] preached from the open book you are
[41:22] receiving your Eternal
[41:24] inheritance by the word that you are
[41:27] believing you see why that devil don't
[41:29] want you to hear the preaching of this
[41:31] message you see why he does not want the
[41:34] message preached with power and
[41:36] inspiration amen according to Malachi 4
[41:39] and Revelations 10 he's going to do two
[41:41] things according to Malachi 4 he will
[41:43] turn the heart of the children to their
[41:45] fathers number two he will reveal the
[41:47] mystery of the seven unknown thunders in
[41:49] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[41:53] contained in the Seven Seals and it will
[41:55] be these divinely revealed mystery
[41:58] truths that literally turned the heart
[42:01] of the children back to their
[42:03] Pentecostal fathers amen and what's the
[42:06] attraction brother bam said the hidden
[42:08] Mystery of Revelations 10: 1-7 the last
[42:11] message to the last AG fulfills in this
[42:13] age Luke 17:30 the day when the son of
[42:17] man is revealed the day when the son of
[42:20] man is revealed do you see that Elijah
[42:22] the prophet has to be on the Earth when
[42:24] the Lord revealed RS himself to the
[42:27] church because he's going to reveal
[42:29] himself as the word and the word can
[42:32] only come to a
[42:34] prophet when Jesus went down there he
[42:37] went to John the Baptist remember he
[42:38] didn't go to the Pharisees he went to
[42:40] John because the word has to come to a
[42:43] prophet and when Jesus returned in this
[42:46] age in the form of a pillar of fire amen
[42:49] down there on that Ohio River where did
[42:50] he go he went to a prophet standing in
[42:54] the water the same as he did in the old
[42:57] he went to a prophet in the water he in
[42:59] this age went to a prophet in the water
[43:02] he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[43:05] today and forever you've not received a
[43:08] tradition you've not received a man-made
[43:10] idea you have received the word the word
[43:14] has come to a prophet and the Church of
[43:16] the Living God is coming to the word as
[43:19] they're hearing the message of the
[43:22] [Music]
[43:23] hour now what's Paul he's going to tell
[43:26] us in this scripture 2 Corinthians 3
[43:28] and: 17 for the Lord is that
[43:31] spirit for the Lord is that spirit and
[43:36] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[43:41] Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is
[43:44] there is Liberty amen Liberty see
[43:48] Liberty comes God gives Liberty isn't it
[43:52] amazing amen that God does not give
[43:54] bondage that God does not chain people
[43:57] down God does not bind people God does
[44:00] not put us in a box God gives us
[44:04] Liberty it's amazing because this
[44:06] Liberty that is given is given by the
[44:09] spirit of God yes sir in John chapter 4
[44:12] the Bible said God is a spirit and they
[44:15] that worship Him worship in spirit and
[44:18] in truth amen it has to be spiritual
[44:22] truth that brings the church into true
[44:25] worship think of this now for the Lord
[44:28] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[44:30] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[44:32] the Lord is the spirit of Liberty in 1
[44:36] Thessalonians chapter 4 the Bible says
[44:39] in this season that we are living the
[44:42] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[44:44] with a shout the Lord who is that Spirit
[44:49] shall come from Heaven preaching a
[44:52] message of
[44:54] Liberty are you with me the the Jubilee
[44:58] back there in the Bible remember gave
[45:00] them Liberty to return to their
[45:04] possessions the message of the hour is a
[45:07] message of Liberty to return to what you
[45:11] were before the devil put his Filthy
[45:14] Hands On You to return to what God made
[45:18] you before the foundation of the world
[45:20] you were a Son of God before there was a
[45:23] star before there was a devil before
[45:26] there was a heaven before there was an
[45:28] angel you are already a son but this
[45:32] message is going to take you back back
[45:34] to what God made you it's a liberty to
[45:39] return Thank You
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:42] Lord the message is a shout I don't have
[45:44] to preach that to y'all y'all know that
[45:46] the message is a shout that's right now
[45:49] watch the 10th chapter in the seventh
[45:50] verse for in the days of the voice of
[45:52] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[45:54] sound the Mist of God should be finished
[45:57] as he's declared unto his servants the
[45:59] prophets and in the eth verse it said
[46:01] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[46:03] spake unto me again said go and take the
[46:06] little
[46:07] book which is open in the hand of the
[46:10] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[46:12] upon the Earth go and take the little
[46:15] book amen now you have to be careful
[46:18] because the devil can use symbols and
[46:20] try to get you with an idea that there's
[46:22] some little book floating around that
[46:24] you're going to have to go take this
[46:25] certain kind of little book or something
[46:27] like that from but but think of this now
[46:29] the prophet of the age has come and let
[46:31] us know that this book was written and
[46:33] planned before the foundation of the
[46:34] world before ink and paper this book was
[46:37] already written and planned before the
[46:38] foundation of the world this book amen
[46:42] is the revelation of the word of that
[46:44] brother man says it like this what did
[46:47] what did Adam Lose Friends Adam lost the
[46:49] book he lost his image or his
[46:52] inheritance in life that's what he lost
[46:55] but the Bible said that Jesus is given
[46:58] back everything that Adam lost now see
[47:00] the sacrifice amen has already been paid
[47:04] for what Adam did amen but the sons of
[47:07] God must hear the liberty of what has
[47:10] been bought and paid for and the message
[47:12] of the hour is the preaching of the
[47:15] little book brother man said we don't
[47:17] need a new book we don't need a new
[47:19] Bible he said what we need is a
[47:24] revelation come on what we need is a
[47:26] revelation a revelation see if we get
[47:30] the Revelation oh how we need Revelation
[47:32] by the spirit we do not need a new Bible
[47:35] we do not need a new translation some
[47:37] are very good I'm not against them but
[47:39] what we need is a revelation of the
[47:43] spirit that's right my he says may God
[47:46] give us by his Spirit a continuous and
[47:49] lifegiving prevailing Revelation is that
[47:53] right Jubilee remember Jesus said not a
[47:56] trumpet the preaching of the Gospel in
[47:59] the 10th chapter in the seventh verse
[48:01] here is the seventh angel sounding a
[48:04] gospel trumpet amen bringing the church
[48:07] to a liberty like no other church has
[48:10] ever been
[48:12] to amen now watch brother Ram said that
[48:14] book of course it's a jubilee time that
[48:17] book has been sealed and in heaven now
[48:20] amen for for ages ever since Adam lost
[48:22] it it's been sealed it's been held back
[48:24] ever since the beginning but brother bam
[48:26] says in the breach what talk about a
[48:28] jubilee time when that lamb steps
[48:30] forward he said the books even sealed in
[48:33] heaven and and people are saying is my
[48:35] name in there I don't know I hope it is
[48:37] amen but if it was there it was before
[48:39] the foundation of the world the first
[48:41] thing that represented Redemption come
[48:43] the lamb had to be slain from the
[48:46] foundation of the world but then he took
[48:48] the book
[48:49] Glory he opened the book tore off the
[48:52] seals and sent it down to the Earth to
[48:55] his seventh angel to reveal it to the
[49:00] people to reveal it to the people faith
[49:05] is a revelation and how does faith come
[49:09] faith comes by the hearing of the word
[49:12] of God what we have received of this age
[49:15] is the word of God the word has come to
[49:18] a prophet but not just any word the word
[49:20] of the ages the word of redemption the
[49:23] word that finishes the devil
[49:26] the word talk about a
[49:30] jubilee now the prophet of God will
[49:32] actually he said I know they thought
[49:34] they fought at it and brought forth and
[49:36] produced things let's just read this now
[49:39] the messages are all kept up until the
[49:41] Earthly vessel until the time of God's
[49:43] appointed time of the last messenger of
[49:44] the earth an Earthly messenger see he's
[49:47] typing this with the day bondage of of
[49:50] of of Babylon he sold his land remember
[49:54] and they took the the the the price and
[49:56] the property and they put it in an earn
[49:59] vessel and they kept it there until the
[50:02] time they returned see because though
[50:04] they've been in Babylon 70 years when
[50:05] they returned to Israel they got their
[50:08] land back they got their possessions
[50:10] back that's right remember that was
[50:12] under
[50:14] zeru when he restored the temple they
[50:17] broke those Earth and vessels that held
[50:19] those messages of possession and when
[50:21] the vessel was broken right the message
[50:24] that was in it was a message of of legal
[50:28] inheritance of legal possession brother
[50:31] M said this title deed has been CT until
[50:34] an Earthly vessel until a seventh
[50:37] Earthly Angel shows up the message he is
[50:41] carrying is a message of inheritance a
[50:44] message of legal rights a message to
[50:47] return to everything that God gave you
[50:49] do you see something happening this
[50:51] morning this message is not a message of
[50:54] bondage it's a message message of
[50:55] Liberty it's a message of truth it's a
[50:58] message of legal rights then that means
[51:01] only one person owns that property and
[51:03] the devil said he owns it but God said
[51:06] he owns it do you see what it is that
[51:08] means the day of the devil is finished
[51:11] his claims do not stand in the presence
[51:15] of this message under a Pentecostal
[51:18] message he can hold you under a Baptist
[51:20] message he can hold you but under the
[51:22] sounding of the seventh Earthly message
[51:25] his claims has finished the devil
[51:28] doesn't have a claim on the
[51:32] church no legal rights at all I don't
[51:35] have to preach one Baptist message I
[51:37] don't have to preach one Presbyterian
[51:39] message I don't have to preach one idea
[51:42] of man he has no rights this message of
[51:45] the hour is a message of
[51:49] redemption whatever the message says
[51:51] about you that is the
[51:54] truth
[52:02] how's this thing coming to us it's
[52:04] brought To Us by
[52:07] Revelation from the hand of God by
[52:12] Vindication God vindicates his word
[52:16] that's the Revelation you're accepting
[52:17] you see John come here and take the
[52:19] book which Revelation should I take the
[52:23] one Vindicated
[52:26] see because there's a lot of
[52:30] Revelations but the one we want is the
[52:33] Vindicated
[52:34] one that's the one that comes from God
[52:38] because God never sends just a word he
[52:41] sends a Vindicated
[52:43] word Jesus is the Vindicated word when
[52:48] you receive a Vindicated word you are
[52:50] receiving the Lord you're not just
[52:53] receiving a word you're receiving a
[52:55] Vindicated word which is Christ amen
[52:59] amen amen do you see in the seven seal
[53:01] brother Ram gets done and he actually
[53:03] closes saying praise God does everybody
[53:06] understand he says congregation say Amen
[53:09] does everybody believe remember I
[53:11] started who hath believed I
[53:14] report and to whom is the arm of the
[53:17] Lord revealed do you see what it is amen
[53:20] God came into the world look back there
[53:23] in John Christ came into the world and
[53:26] the world knew him
[53:29] not and the world received him not but
[53:33] as
[53:34] many as many as received him to them he
[53:39] gave
[53:40] power to become the sons of God can you
[53:44] say power power to become what Sons sons
[53:50] of God now you might think that that
[53:52] that's a Greek word you got to watch
[53:53] those Greek words cuz power means
[53:55] different things in this Greek word is
[53:57] escusa which means Authority and he gave
[54:00] them
[54:02] Authority maybe we'll use one of the
[54:04] other words he gave them
[54:07] Liberty it actually means power it means
[54:11] Authority right Liberty or strength do
[54:14] you see what it is as many as received
[54:17] him this revelation of the open book as
[54:20] many as received him to them he gave
[54:24] authority to be the sons of God and
[54:26] we'll say it like this he gave them
[54:28] Liberty and where the spirit of God is
[54:32] there is liberty liberty for what
[54:36] Liberty to be the sons of God Liberty to
[54:39] come to adoption Liberty to return to
[54:43] what God has promised for you now now
[54:46] I'm not I'm not losing my mind watch
[54:49] Galatians the 4th chapter I say this in
[54:51] the first verse that an heir as long as
[54:53] a child
[54:55] differ nothing from a servant though he
[54:59] be Lord of all amen he differs nothing
[55:02] from a servant he has no Liberty as a
[55:06] servant but under the tutors and governs
[55:08] until the time appointed of the father
[55:12] does God have a time until the appointed
[55:14] time what did the breach say the time
[55:17] appointed was when the seventh Earthly
[55:19] vessel came that was the appointed time
[55:22] there's where the Liberty is going to
[55:24] come under that message look at what he
[55:27] said even so when we were children we
[55:29] were in bondage under the elements of
[55:31] the world but when the fullness of time
[55:33] come God sent forth his son made of a
[55:35] woman made under the law to redeem them
[55:38] under the law that we might
[55:42] receive that we might
[55:44] receive
[55:46] Liberty that we might receive the
[55:48] adoption of
[55:50] sons and because ye are Sons all right
[55:56] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[56:00] in your hearts crying Abby father where
[56:04] thou are no more a servant but a son and
[56:07] if a son then an heir of God through
[56:10] Christ then if you're not a servant
[56:12] anymore what are you you're a son and if
[56:15] you're a son then you're Heir what are
[56:17] you heir of everything that God gave
[56:20] Jesus he gave the Church of the Living
[56:22] God you are a joint heir to every
[56:25] promise then in Mark 11 when Jesus
[56:27] cursed that fig tree he was not cursing
[56:30] a fig tree to show his power he was
[56:32] actually cursing a fig tree to show what
[56:34] the church was air of in their days of
[56:37] Liberty come on friend there's never
[56:39] been another church performed those
[56:41] things there's never been another age
[56:43] when they had those kinds of things in
[56:44] the church but under the message of the
[56:47] hour there was actually five
[56:50] manifestations of the third pool right
[56:53] now don't don't leave me yet five
[56:55] manifestations of the third pool watch
[56:57] brother Ram spoke squirrels amen six of
[57:00] them were actually
[57:01] spoken two different times amen we found
[57:05] that he actually stood on a mountain and
[57:07] told a storm to go back where it came
[57:10] from he stood there in his bedroom and
[57:13] cursed a cursed a tumor that was on his
[57:16] wife miles away and said before the
[57:19] doctor ever touches her the cancer will
[57:22] be
[57:23] gone he stood in a boat over a little
[57:26] dead fish that had been dead a half hour
[57:29] and by the quick and activated word of
[57:31] God he said fish I give you life in the
[57:34] name of Jesus Christ and the fish come
[57:37] back to life again oh my nothing greater
[57:40] than the last one when hady right was
[57:42] sitting there in agreement with the
[57:45] word in agreement with the word she
[57:48] heard about the manifestation of the
[57:51] third pull and it did not choke her and
[57:53] it did not settle her down amen she
[57:56] wasn't a resenting Spirit she was not a
[57:59] resenting Spirit she had a receiving
[58:01] spirit and she said brother brandom how
[58:04] did that happen and he said sister I can
[58:06] only tell you that he is Jehovah Gyra
[58:09] the same one that brought that real for
[58:11] Abraham brought that for me he is
[58:14] Jehovah Gyra and in an agreement to him
[58:17] she said that's nothing but the truth
[58:20] brother
[58:22] brandham and something I love he said
[58:24] the greatest anointing I ever felt in my
[58:26] life come right
[58:28] then when that bride agreed with that
[58:31] third pool manifestation there was an
[58:34] agreement that brought a connection
[58:36] between that bride and that word
[58:39] manifested and it released an atomic
[58:42] power that was in the and that girl
[58:44] heard a prophet say whatever you say
[58:47] Haddie I have got permission from God to
[58:50] speak it whatever you say and you know
[58:52] what she said don't you come on come on
[58:55] parents you know what she said she said
[58:57] give me the life of them two boys and it
[59:00] shook the corridors of hell that morning
[59:03] because somebody was announcing devil
[59:06] you're finished there's a bride who
[59:09] received its Liberty there's a bride
[59:11] taking her Liberty she said them were my
[59:14] possessions and I'm not just a servant
[59:17] I'm a daughter of God I'm not just a
[59:20] child I'm a mature child in the presence
[59:23] of God me tell you something this
[59:25] morning you ever catch a revelation of
[59:27] what this message has give you when you
[59:29] come in agreement with it you're
[59:31] receiving Liberty to speak a word you're
[59:33] receiving Liberty to bind Devils you're
[59:35] receiving Liberty to tell the lame to
[59:37] get up and walk and the blind to see you
[59:40] are receiving a liberty that will tear
[59:42] down the gates of hell and Destroy every
[59:45] devil I know what I'm talking about I've
[59:48] met Devils on the field in India I've
[59:50] met them in Africa I've met them in
[59:52] America and there ain't no no devil
[59:55] there ain't no power there's nothing can
[59:57] stand before this message that I'm
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:07] preaching as long as you're a
[1:00:11] servant you're under a
[1:00:15] bondage what B of bondage are you under
[1:00:18] well I don't know if I don't know if
[1:00:19] they could be saved I I've seen them
[1:00:21] laughing at the prophet maybe they've
[1:00:22] blasphemed the Holy Ghost I don't know I
[1:00:25] seen him out there drinking the other
[1:00:26] day I don't know how anybody could ever
[1:00:27] get saved and out there drink I don't
[1:00:29] know I I I tell you what I I tell you
[1:00:31] what I did the other day I I didn't do
[1:00:33] this right I got a bad attitude and said
[1:00:35] something wrong I don't know if the
[1:00:36] Lord's going to honor it now and I don't
[1:00:38] know I don't know if it's going to
[1:00:39] happen you see the bondage you're coming
[1:00:40] under cuz you're pointing everything to
[1:00:42] your ability you're pointing everything
[1:00:44] to who you are and what you are in this
[1:00:46] life but I'm talking to you about
[1:00:48] another book I'm not talking about the
[1:00:50] book of this life I'm talking about a
[1:00:52] Lamb's Book of Life That's Eternal in
[1:00:53] the heavens that God is reading out of
[1:00:55] that book and totally ignoring you you
[1:00:58] are not going to do this this is the
[1:01:00] Lord's doing this is what God is doing
[1:01:03] he's bringing a liberty to you to
[1:01:06] believe for this thing to believe
[1:01:08] whatsoever you
[1:01:13] say Galatians 1 position in Christ
[1:01:16] brother bam says it he says galatian
[1:01:18] gives a picture of how we were under
[1:01:19] tutors the child was born became a son
[1:01:21] very moment he was in the family now
[1:01:23] there was a tutor over this boy to
[1:01:25] educate and raise him and we have no
[1:01:27] more than a servant said galatian letter
[1:01:29] until that time and Age come a certain
[1:01:31] limited time that was set and that tutor
[1:01:34] would always take the father and your
[1:01:36] son is progressing right or whatever it
[1:01:38] was he says I'm not disagreeing with my
[1:01:40] dear brother but take it from someone
[1:01:42] who loves you there's where Pentecost
[1:01:45] failed to see this if the ho the Holy
[1:01:49] Spirit may be not willing to give it
[1:01:51] then look when you're born again of the
[1:01:53] Holy Ghost you say that's it brother it
[1:01:56] was you was a child you was just as much
[1:01:59] child as you're ever going to be you're
[1:02:00] born in the family but the tutor which
[1:02:03] is the holy spirit has watched over the
[1:02:04] church in its maturing now if the tutor
[1:02:07] natural went to the father and said this
[1:02:09] boy's not doing very good I teach him
[1:02:11] but he won't listen he's headstrong he
[1:02:13] won't listen he's going this way or
[1:02:14] going that watch him placing all of that
[1:02:17] with him
[1:02:18] listening how is that boy getting from
[1:02:21] servitude to sunship he's listening to
[1:02:24] the
[1:02:25] tutor he's receiving the instructions of
[1:02:30] his
[1:02:31] Liberty do you see what he's doing the
[1:02:33] tutor is moving him from the way a child
[1:02:36] thinks to the way his father thinks this
[1:02:39] message is moving you from the way you
[1:02:42] think about yourself the way you think
[1:02:45] about others into what God thinks how
[1:02:49] God does how you're seeing Heaven's
[1:02:52] point of
[1:02:53] view
[1:02:56] in the spiritual sense we are actually
[1:02:58] born into Christ we become children of
[1:03:00] God God knows best here's where I say
[1:03:02] reverently not to disagree with my
[1:03:04] lattering brother lattering Brethren you
[1:03:06] think I'm persecuting the church no dear
[1:03:08] brother I'm not you see this boy after
[1:03:10] he got to a certain age he had to be
[1:03:12] adopted into the family he was borned
[1:03:14] into a minister knows that is the
[1:03:17] placing of the sons do you see that
[1:03:19] Ephesians chapter 1 you're actually
[1:03:21] predestinated unto the adoption of Sons
[1:03:24] that's what you're predestinated to God
[1:03:27] didn't Destin you to the Pentecostal age
[1:03:30] he didn't Destin you to no Ruan age he
[1:03:33] destined you unto the adoption of sons
[1:03:38] when does the adoption come at the
[1:03:40] appointed time the time of Liberty the
[1:03:43] time of maturity the time of a message
[1:03:46] of the
[1:03:47] hour according to Romans chapter 8 for
[1:03:50] whom he did for know he also did
[1:03:52] predestinate to be conformed in into the
[1:03:54] image of his son into the image of his
[1:03:58] son now Jesus amen he never sent down a
[1:04:00] picture like we have of the hofman head
[1:04:03] or here at the marriage supper he never
[1:04:04] said now you all get your hair like this
[1:04:06] and get your robe like this and this is
[1:04:08] what I want you to come to but in second
[1:04:10] Peter chapter 1 he outlaid what a true
[1:04:13] mature son would be giving him Seven
[1:04:16] Virtues with a topping of Christ as his
[1:04:19] Capstone is that right which brings a
[1:04:22] child Liberty and we can announc
[1:04:24] according to 1 John chapter 3 the Bible
[1:04:27] said when he shall
[1:04:30] appear we shall
[1:04:33] be is that an image I guess we shall be
[1:04:37] in His image we shall be like him for we
[1:04:41] shall see him as he is how are we seeing
[1:04:44] this by the revelation of the word we
[1:04:46] are seeing what God really is and we're
[1:04:49] coming into that image of what he has
[1:04:51] given the prophet will announce it and
[1:04:54] he he'll say we are now the Sons and
[1:04:57] Daughters of
[1:04:58] God we are right now the Sons and
[1:05:01] Daughters of God you got to be careful
[1:05:03] as you hear a prophet say this because
[1:05:04] he's not saying we are now servants he
[1:05:07] said we are now Sons we are right now
[1:05:10] Sons and Daughters of God sitting
[1:05:12] together in Heavenly places amen right
[1:05:15] now every man woman boy that's born
[1:05:18] again of God receive the Holy Spirit
[1:05:21] setting in Heavenly places and gathered
[1:05:23] together in Christ amen watch what he
[1:05:25] says see that that God is putting you
[1:05:28] here he says it like this now and God's
[1:05:30] covenant with Abraham some people goes
[1:05:33] by feeling they say I'm not saved
[1:05:35] because I feel like I'm saved but the
[1:05:38] devil can beat you around the stump
[1:05:40] every day on
[1:05:43] that now he's teaching us something is
[1:05:45] he bringing this to Liberty the devil
[1:05:48] can beat you some people goes by their
[1:05:50] feeling I'm not saved because I I feel
[1:05:54] like I'm saved or the devil can beat you
[1:05:56] on the stump every day but I'm not saved
[1:05:58] because I feel like I'm
[1:06:00] saved I'm saved because I met God's
[1:06:03] requirement God called me and I accepted
[1:06:06] it and by faith I believe it and whether
[1:06:09] I feel good or whether I feel like it or
[1:06:11] not I am anyhow cuz God said
[1:06:15] so do you see where your Liberty is God
[1:06:18] said so do you see where sunship is God
[1:06:21] said so Abraham he said I know what it
[1:06:24] looks like but God said so Noah said it
[1:06:26] looks like this but God said so Jesus
[1:06:29] said God said so do you see the
[1:06:31] difference it's not what I feel it's
[1:06:33] what God Said God said sa God said this
[1:06:37] Bride is a spotless virgin bride not
[1:06:40] what I see not what I think it's what
[1:06:42] God Said God said
[1:06:47] so you are now a Son of God in the house
[1:06:51] of God as a part of God's economy
[1:06:55] Romans 88 chapter 1 there is now no more
[1:06:58] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:07:01] Jesus there is now can you say now right
[1:07:04] now there is now no more
[1:07:08] condemnation we are in Christ no
[1:07:11] condemnation no bondage we are living in
[1:07:17] Liberty watch what he said for they are
[1:07:19] dead to the world alive in him living in
[1:07:22] this present day making the word God has
[1:07:24] used them and for dained them placing
[1:07:26] their names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:07:28] and from when the waters come upon that
[1:07:30] seed that's in your heart it raises up
[1:07:32] the bride of Christ just as perfect as
[1:07:34] in every age see the lutherans under
[1:07:36] justification the feet raised like that
[1:07:39] Wesley under sanctification the
[1:07:40] Pentecostal under the arms the works and
[1:07:42] deeds and so forth to the calvinist or
[1:07:45] had to be Armenian so they could be
[1:07:46] legalist but now we come to the Head the
[1:07:50] Capstone crying Grace Grace the Capstone
[1:07:53] cry
[1:07:54] The Headstone crying Grace Grace passed
[1:07:58] from Creed unto the Living Word of the
[1:08:02] Living God pass from Death unto life
[1:08:05] pass from Creed unto the Living Word of
[1:08:08] the Living God you see already set it in
[1:08:10] Heavenly places alive right now with
[1:08:13] every word of God subject to us we have
[1:08:16] been actually quickened in this word age
[1:08:19] to believe these things that we are
[1:08:22] believing I'm closing right here let's
[1:08:24] take this just as a thought brother B
[1:08:27] said we go back through last Sunday for
[1:08:29] it is impossible for man that once
[1:08:30] tasted of the Heavenly gifts to fall
[1:08:32] away and again to renew himself under
[1:08:34] repentance absolutely totally impossible
[1:08:37] isn't that
[1:08:38] amazing for he that is born of God does
[1:08:42] not and cannot commit sin for the seed
[1:08:44] of God remains in him first John chapter
[1:08:48] 3 right I'm just going to read the
[1:08:50] prophet for the seed of God is the word
[1:08:54] of God yes sir and Faith cometh by the
[1:08:57] hearing of the word the sacrifice was
[1:09:01] made it's all
[1:09:03] over do you see what he's saying if you
[1:09:06] do wrong God will make you pay for it
[1:09:09] that's simple enough isn't it if you do
[1:09:11] wrong god'll make you pay for it but if
[1:09:14] you do it willingly now see you don't do
[1:09:17] it
[1:09:17] willingly do you know you really a
[1:09:20] Christian don't willfully do things
[1:09:22] wrong they just don't amen they actually
[1:09:26] do things right if they do something
[1:09:28] wrong they didn't mean to do
[1:09:30] that if you see now this is a very
[1:09:34] powerful thing for if we sin
[1:09:37] willfully after we've receive the
[1:09:40] knowledge of the truth now watch what he
[1:09:42] says be real careful and listen to him
[1:09:45] if we sin willfully After we receive the
[1:09:48] knowledge of
[1:09:50] truth but after you're once born
[1:09:54] you have the
[1:09:56] truth now watch people try to take that
[1:09:59] once that you've received knowledge of
[1:10:01] the truth and sin willfully there's no
[1:10:03] more sacrifice watch brother brandom
[1:10:05] separate you from that scripture he says
[1:10:07] you're not receiving the knowledge of
[1:10:09] Truth you have been born and received
[1:10:12] the truth see what he's saying not the
[1:10:16] knowledge of it but you have accepted
[1:10:19] the truth and it's already become a
[1:10:21] reality you're a child of God for Time
[1:10:25] and Eternity God swore what he would do
[1:10:28] see he that heareth my words and
[1:10:31] believeth upon him that sent me hath
[1:10:33] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:10:35] and he will never come into
[1:10:39] judgment for them that are in Christ
[1:10:42] shall not come into
[1:10:45] condemnation look what he's saying for
[1:10:47] it is impossible for God to lie do you
[1:10:50] see where he places it amen if a man it
[1:10:53] would be impossible for him to do it
[1:10:55] brother said because it's impossible for
[1:10:58] God to lie if God said once a man has
[1:11:01] received truth he has passed from Death
[1:11:04] unto life he shall not come into
[1:11:06] condemnation then you can't take Hebrews
[1:11:09] 6 and Hebrews 10 and take this bride and
[1:11:11] put her in Hell she's already bypassed
[1:11:14] the tribulation she's already bypassed
[1:11:17] she is not in bondage any longer she has
[1:11:20] come into a liberty I'm not living every
[1:11:23] day of my life wondering if I'm going to
[1:11:25] do something and end up in Hell come on
[1:11:28] church if a man can make a sin that he
[1:11:31] can pass the day of Grace and God don't
[1:11:33] deal with him anymore if a man can go
[1:11:36] there then a man can go to a place with
[1:11:38] God that he can never come back again
[1:11:42] come on church this message took us to a
[1:11:44] place where a prophet would announce the
[1:11:47] day of sin is
[1:11:52] finished you're not going out and coming
[1:11:55] back and going out and coming back but a
[1:11:57] man whoever comes in he come into the
[1:12:00] liberty of God he will abide in the
[1:12:03] presence of God forever do you see what

[1:17:58] Word brother Braham said that Paul was
[1:18:01] quickened he was so quickened from the
[1:18:03] law to Grace that in 1 Corinthians 15 he
[1:18:06] said he had the
[1:18:08] victory he said death has been swallowed
[1:18:10] up by Victory and he was actually
[1:18:12] talking about being quickened from the
[1:18:14] law to Grace there's nothing left of the
[1:18:18] law in me can you think of that this

[1:18:40] read what other word could completely
[1:18:43] take your past and throw it away come
[1:18:47] on I have never read no other messages
[1:18:51] where a man could say that Jesus Took
[1:18:52] took your
[1:18:54] sins take it out of the Book of Malachi
[1:18:56] he wasn't just he was in The Book of
[1:18:57] Micah he wasn't just playing it was in
[1:18:59] the scripture and take your sins and he
[1:19:01] said he cast them into the Sea's
[1:19:05] forgiveness but see most people teach
[1:19:07] the blood and they just taught a
[1:19:08] chemical blood but this Prophet taught a
[1:19:10] blood that's a spirit and he said the
[1:19:13] blood is the spirit of God so he said he
[1:19:16] created a way to destroy your sins which
[1:19:19] was the works of the
[1:19:21] devil that they wouldn't even be
[1:19:23] remembered in the mind of
[1:19:27] God now he's trying to call you up out
[1:19:29] of your mind into his mind where your
[1:19:33] thoughts will become his
[1:19:35] thoughts and when your thoughts you
[1:19:37] start thinking like he thinks you're
[1:19:39] going to start walking like an adopted
[1:19:40] son talking like an adopted son cuz
[1:19:43] that's the only way he ever saw
[1:19:47] you he never saw you as a kid he never
[1:19:49] saw you that way he didn't look at you

[1:52:14] better explain myself but years ago we
[1:52:17] had a brother from overseas and and
[1:52:18] that's why he's my friend and everything
[1:52:20] and and and for two or three years later

[1:52:33] our or a tape library of a ministers we
[1:52:36] have I mean Benjamin and Elma keep them

[1:52:47] available that we can hear it
[1:52:50] we can hear it those that want to hear
[1:52:52] it over and catch some of those fine
