[3:54] old mobile car and he he'd pack me

[4:47] Amen. And uh we got a few things on our
[4:50] heart tonight. And and just before we go
[4:52] into the word of the Lord, maybe we just
[4:53] have a word of prayer tonight. And Amen.
[4:56] Let's just bow our hearts together.
[4:58] Father, we thank you tonight for your
[5:00] grace that you have given us. I thank
[5:02] you for this song service, Lord, for the
[5:05] blessing that it's been to our spirits,
[5:07] Lord.
[5:08] Father, to see your children entering in
[5:10] the gates with thanksgiving in their
[5:12] heart. Lord, we just ask you tonight
[5:15] that you would come on the scene, that
[5:16] you [music] would touch these needs.
[5:18] Father, Lord, we have gathered in this
[5:20] place tonight to worship you. We've
[5:23] gathered here tonight to come around
[5:24] your word, Lord. The highest order of
[5:27] worship is the preaching of your gospel.
[5:31] And we ask tonight that you would take
[5:32] your word, Lord, and that you would
[5:34] speak to the need of your children. We
[5:36] invite you to the platform, [music]
[5:38] Lord, that you would lead us down these
[5:40] paths, Father. And Lord, that you would
[5:42] make clear and the revelation, Lord,
[5:44] would be so plain in our hearts tonight,
[5:47] Lord. Now, Father, we commit this
[5:49] service and the needs of your people
[5:51] into thy faithful hands. In the name of
[5:54] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[5:57] Amen. And amen. Excuse me. If you have
[6:00] your Bibles, let's go to the book of
[6:02] Hebrews, the first chapter. Can you give
[6:05] me a little bit in the ear monitor
[6:07] itself? Amen. Hebrews chapter 1 and
[6:10] we'll go into the first chapter uh and
[6:13] again the first two verses. I've got
[6:15] some things here uh
[6:18] that I'd like to continue this um I've
[6:20] been building it just a little bit and
[6:23] amen in Hebrews chapter 1 1 and two just
[6:26] a little more in the actual ear monitor.
[6:29] Amen. Hebrews 1 and 1 and two for God
[6:34] who at sunundra times and divers manners
[6:37] and brother random it it points out that
[6:39] the Bible was written by man but the
[6:44] author of scripture is God and it and
[6:46] Paul says it here God who at 100 times
[6:51] and in diverse manner spake in times
[6:53] past unto the fathers by the prophets in
[6:56] various times in various ways to various
[6:58] people. [clears throat]
[6:59] But he hath in these last days spoken
[7:02] unto us by his son whom he hath
[7:06] appointed heir of all things by whom
[7:10] also he made the worlds. May the Lord
[7:13] bless his words. You could be seated
[7:14] tonight.
[7:16] I'm just going to be continuing this if
[7:18] I can speaking to you from this Hebrews
[7:21] chapter 1. And I want I want to if we
[7:23] would take a a subtopic. We're going to
[7:25] be looking tonight at dispensations.
[7:27] Amen. dispensations and as you can see
[7:30] it here in Hebrews 1:es 1 and two uh you
[7:34] know by this time Paul is writing this
[7:37] book of Hebrews he's actually uh
[7:38] approaching the Jews he's speaking to
[7:41] the people uh of the law the beautiful
[7:43] thing about the Bible is one of the part
[7:46] of the Bible doesn't have to disallow
[7:48] another part of the Bible but if it's a
[7:50] Bible revelation it can include what is
[7:53] former and show you the truth uh that
[7:56] exists upon
[7:57] Uh when when Paul speaks here in the
[7:59] book of Hebrews, uh some people think
[8:01] like you take the Old Testament, they
[8:03] think, well, see, when you got the New
[8:04] Testament, the Old Testament's not in
[8:06] good anymore. But really, what good
[8:08] would the book of Hebrews really be to
[8:10] us without the book of Leviticus?
[8:12] &gt;&gt; But because there is a book of
[8:14] Leviticus, then we understand the the
[8:16] laws, we understand the priesthoods, we
[8:18] understand uh what God would do through
[8:20] the through the sacrifices. And because
[8:22] you have those laws and those sacrifices
[8:25] and those people that were trained in
[8:26] that over hundreds of years, then when
[8:29] they hear the book of Hebrews coming
[8:31] from Apostle Paul, now he's explaining
[8:33] to them what Jesus Christ is by what the
[8:36] Old Testament was. So the Old Testament
[8:39] is actually unfolded by the book of
[8:40] Hebrews rather than done away with. He's
[8:43] just showing them what it is happening.
[8:45] So as Paul begins by saying this God in
[8:48] sunundra times and diverse manners and
[8:50] he's talking about God and he's talking
[8:51] about him doing the speaking now he's
[8:54] trans transferring to the idea amen that
[8:57] it's now his son it's not just prophets
[8:59] it's not just law but now we're dealing
[9:02] with the son himself and and by the time
[9:05] that Paul is speaking these things unto
[9:07] the Jews now now Christ has already been
[9:10] crucified it's he's already been
[9:12] resurrected uh the the atonements have
[9:15] already been made and now Paul is only
[9:18] telling them by the word what has
[9:21] already happened. And I think this is
[9:23] amazing because it's the greatest proof
[9:25] to us that salvation is by faith because
[9:28] they couldn't be a part of the cross.
[9:30] See, they couldn't they couldn't be with
[9:32] them and part of the disciples and they
[9:34] couldn't had been a part of the
[9:36] happenings around Calvary and the
[9:38] resurrection. That was all passed at
[9:40] this point. But what Paul is doing is
[9:42] he's now bringing them in to what has
[9:45] happened by the preaching of it. And
[9:48] when they heard that word according to
[9:50] the fourth chapter, you could enter into
[9:52] it by your faith.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now there's an undercurrent
[9:56] or an underlay. I hope you're hearing
[9:58] what what what happened for them. Turn
[10:00] around and look at us today. And we
[10:02] can't go back in the 60s. We we're not
[10:05] able to go back in the time when brother
[10:06] Brand was opening those seals and and
[10:08] those things were happening. But we can
[10:10] preach it about it today and then we can
[10:13] we can enter into it by our faith in
[10:16] what has happened because those things
[10:18] have already been done. Amen. One more
[10:20] time. I'm sorry. Can you EQ that a
[10:22] little bit? Maybe take out some of the
[10:24] base of that. Amen. I'm I'm switched
[10:26] ears on you to the right tonight. Amen.
[10:28] I'm not working for the uh secret
[10:29] service. I This is just my own little
[10:32] monitor in my ear. Amen. Amen. So being
[10:35] this this way this room is set up, it it
[10:37] actually helps it so these ain't so loud
[10:39] and it helps it uh fix it the the
[10:42] equalizes it. But what you seeing is is
[10:45] Paul is trying to uh speak to them about
[10:48] Christ in the last days. And I love how
[10:50] this says it. For he hath in these last
[10:52] days spoken unto us by his son whom
[10:55] he've appointed heir of all things. So
[10:57] spoken to us by his son. Now, in Matthew
[11:00] the 17th chapter, let's turn there and
[11:02] and these things will come up later in
[11:04] in the book of Hebrews. And I'll get
[11:05] deeper into them, but I want to just set
[11:07] this in your mind a moment. In Matthew
[11:09] chapter 17, let's read these first five
[11:11] verses. And after six days, Jesus taketh
[11:15] Peter, James, and John his brother, and
[11:17] bringeth them up on a high mountain
[11:19] apart. Now, there's a lot of good
[11:21] preaching right there, isn't it? He he
[11:22] he took him in a special experience and
[11:25] and he he was transfigured before them
[11:28] and his face did shine as the sun and
[11:31] his raignment was white as the light and
[11:35] behold there appeared unto him Moses and
[11:39] Elias talking with him. Now there now
[11:41] Peter seeing something and then watch
[11:44] how Peter interprets. He said then
[11:46] answered Peter and said to Jesus, Lord,
[11:48] it is good for us to be here. If thou
[11:51] wilt, let us make three tabernacles. One
[11:53] for thee, one for Moses, and one for
[11:55] Elias. Now, isn't it amazing how Peter
[11:57] when he sees something, this is how he
[12:00] interprets. This is what he thinks. This
[12:02] is what should be done because of what
[12:04] we're seeing. And the Bible says, "And
[12:06] while he yet spake, while he was given
[12:07] his interpretation, behold, a bright
[12:10] cloud overshadowed them and said,
[12:12] Behold, a voice out of the cloud, which
[12:15] said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I
[12:19] am well pleased. Hear ye him." Now,
[12:23] Brother Bam, an identified masterpiece,
[12:25] will say this. While he spake, there
[12:27] came a voice out of the cloud, and it
[12:30] said, "This is my beloved son, and I'm
[12:32] pleased with him. I'm going to smite him
[12:35] for you. Hear ye him. He's going to
[12:39] speak.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Now, when the scripture says, "Hear ye
[12:42] him." That's a prophecy that he's going
[12:45] to speak. How can you hear him unless he
[12:48] speaks? Now, again, in Mark chapter
[12:50] nine, and there was a cloud that
[12:52] overshadowed them, seventh verse, and a
[12:55] cloud came out, a voice came out of the
[12:57] cloud, saying, "This is my beloved son.
[13:00] Hear ye him." And suddenly when they had
[13:03] looked around about they saw no man
[13:05] anymore save Jesus only with themselves.
[13:10] Now here we find he says to him this is
[13:12] my beloved son. Hear ye him. Brother man
[13:16] says it in the masterpiece again. He
[13:18] says it like this. We found him on
[13:19] transfiguration and there stood Moses
[13:21] the law. There stood Elijah the prophet.
[13:24] See the law and prophets are until. See
[13:26] there stood the law and there stood the
[13:28] prophets. He says, "And then all the way
[13:31] back from the patriarchs and the
[13:32] fathers, the law and prophets, and all
[13:34] of them are standing there, and we hear
[13:36] a voice coming down from the heavens and
[13:39] saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye
[13:42] him." See, there's Moses. There's Elias.
[13:44] There's laws and prophets. But now God
[13:47] is saying, "Hear my son." Amen. See,
[13:50] this is him. And if we're going to hear
[13:52] him, he's going to have to speak. And it
[13:55] was just a few days before he was
[13:57] smitten. Now see what it was. He says,
[13:59] "I'm pleased to dwell in. I've been
[14:01] 4,000 years bringing whom to this. He is
[14:04] so perfect. I'll have to smite him so he
[14:07] can speak. Hear ye him. He is the
[14:10] perfected one. He is the masterpiece."
[14:12] SO WHAT GOD IS SAYING IS is what all the
[14:15] law and prophets were looking at. This
[14:17] is actually what they were trying to
[14:19] say. This is a a more clear uh uh word
[14:23] than than what you've heard of all of
[14:25] the prophets and what they had to say.
[14:27] Jesus was the fulfillment of the
[14:29] perfection of the words of all those
[14:31] prophets. And now God was saying, "Hear
[14:34] ye him." How many knows that was his
[14:35] adoption ceremony.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said from that time on,
[14:40] whatever you needed, you would have to
[14:42] hear him. If you needed life, he you'll
[14:45] have to hear him. If you need healing,
[14:47] you'll have to hear him. Amen. So the
[14:49] scriptures are showing us now that you
[14:51] have to hear him, but to hear him, he
[14:54] has to speak. And this is THIS IS WHAT
[14:56] PAUL IS SAYING. The law and the prophets
[14:59] have been speaking, but now it's the son
[15:01] that's going to speak. And and and we
[15:04] find quickly that he that he dies and he
[15:06] is buried and he's resurrected. Amen.
[15:09] But did his voice stop when he left the
[15:12] earth? but rather the Bible said, "He
[15:14] that heareth my voice and believeth upon
[15:17] him that has sent me hath EVERLASTING
[15:19] LIFE." NOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO put it
[15:21] upon the voice of hearing the voice of
[15:24] God is how you're going to have life,
[15:26] then you're going to have to know the
[15:28] voice you're hearing is THE VOICE OF
[15:30] GOD. SEE, YOU CAN'T JUST HEAR THE voice
[15:33] of anything. ANYBODY CAN SAY THAT THEY
[15:35] HAVE AUTHORITY, BUT THE ONLY TRUE
[15:37] AUTHORITY is the authority that you can
[15:40] take back to Jesus Christ. Now uh uh you
[15:43] if you look at this in in a very clear
[15:45] language and and you see then that a
[15:47] voice has got to be identified then the
[15:49] only way you can do that is you have to
[15:51] trace it right. Where did that voice
[15:53] leave? Amen. When it left Jesus where
[15:56] did it go? Where did that voice go? And
[15:58] you know you you can trace it quickly to
[16:00] his disciples. Whosoever you receive
[16:02] receiveth him that sent me. We see it go
[16:04] into Apostle Paul and we see the first
[16:06] church age message. And Paul is saying
[16:09] to the people, IF ANYBODY SAYS SOMETHING
[16:11] DIFFERENT than I'm saying, let him be
[16:13] accur. Because see, I'm God's voice to
[16:16] this generation. To this age, I'm the
[16:18] voice. He sent to the to is to THIS AGE.
[16:21] NOW, NOW WATCH UP THROUGH THE CHURCH
[16:23] AGES after the ending of scripture and
[16:25] the apostles that became a mucky and
[16:28] miry and a dark saying of who really
[16:30] spoke for God. That's when the Catholics
[16:32] begin to rise up. And then and then soon
[16:35] thereafter about the time America was
[16:36] bored, here come the denominations and
[16:39] Luther's and Baptists and all these
[16:40] things and everybody is saying they
[16:42] speak for God.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But unless you can tell me where
[16:46] the voice went from Apostle Paul all the
[16:48] way to the day, how would you know what
[16:51] voice you're hearing? BUT SEE, GOD
[16:53] PROMISED IN THE LAST DAYS to bring a
[16:55] clarity when he said in the evening time
[16:58] there shall come light and the
[17:00] confusion's going to leave and we're
[17:02] going to know exactly who we're hearing
[17:05] and what we're hearing from because God
[17:08] made a promise to the church.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; He realizes Brother Bram said the
[17:11] message of the hour is a mount
[17:13] transfiguration experience.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a mount transfiguration
[17:18] experience. In other words, when every
[17:19] voice is speaking, Amen. We have heard a
[17:22] voice out of a cloud saying, "This is my
[17:24] beloved son. Hear ye him." Amen. A voice
[17:28] of authority. In John chapter 16, it's
[17:31] Jesus that prophesies when he says to
[17:33] his disciples in the 12th verse, "I have
[17:36] yet many things to say to you, but you
[17:39] cannot bear them now. But when the
[17:41] Spirit of truth has come, he will guide
[17:43] you into all truth, and he shall not
[17:45] speak of himself, but whatsoever he
[17:47] shall hear, that shall he speak, and
[17:49] will show you things to come." SO JESUS
[17:51] IS SAYING I got things to say but when
[17:54] the spirit of truth comes he'll say them
[17:56] to you. Right.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; How many knows that in the message
[18:00] spirit of truth, brother Bam reads the
[18:02] scripture John 16 and in the end of that
[18:05] in the end of spirit of truth he will
[18:07] say the scripture I read this morning
[18:09] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[18:12] your ears that he was fulfilling that
[18:15] John 16 the spirit of truth was using
[18:18] the message of the hour to fulfill
[18:21] prophecy when he said I got things to
[18:23] say but you cannot hear them now do you
[18:26] know that's a direct prophecy of the
[18:28] opening of the seals. How many knows
[18:30] brother Bam taught that? That's a direct
[18:32] prophecy that the seals Jesus was going
[18:35] to speak them himself. The the ideas
[18:38] that brother Brandham gives on the seals
[18:40] is not William Brandham's ideas. Amen.
[18:43] It's the prophecy that Christ was
[18:45] supposed to speak in THE LAST DAYS.
[18:48] AMEN. AND THERE WILL BE A PEOPLE TO HEAR
[18:50] him when he speaks. I'm so glad. Amen.
[18:54] In John 16, look what he says. Now, if
[18:56] you continue reading John 16, and I'll
[18:58] throw this in because we're in the
[18:59] middle of it, but John 16, you watch. If
[19:01] you continue on just a little bit later,
[19:04] Jesus is continuing prophesying, and he
[19:06] said that there'll come a little time,
[19:08] Amen. Uh there'll come a little time of
[19:10] sadness, but then your sorrow is going
[19:11] to be turned to joy.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He's telling them
[19:14] disciples that you're going to be sad
[19:16] when I'm crucified, but if you'll hang
[19:18] on, your sorrow will be turned to joy.
[19:21] Just a few days later, he appears to two
[19:24] of these on the road to Emmas. AND HOW
[19:27] ARE THEY WALKING? THEY are walking
[19:29] saddened and d downtrodden. And when
[19:31] Jesus comes up to them, he says, "Oh,
[19:34] you slow of heart to believe all the
[19:36] prophets have spoke unto you." And then
[19:39] he begin to take the scriptures that
[19:42] spoke of himself, laid out an entire
[19:44] revelation, and then comes right down to
[19:47] the end of the day's journey. They had
[19:49] journeyied about six ages. And at the
[19:52] end of the day's journey, seventh hour,
[19:54] they went into a little room and there
[19:56] he broke open the word to them and they
[19:59] left there with the joy of knowing he
[20:02] was alive. Amen. Their sorrow was turned
[20:05] to joy. That's right.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW BROTHER RANDOM USES THAT
[20:08] SAME prophecy in a in a sermon called a
[20:11] man running from the presence of God?
[20:12] You ever hear the sermon man running
[20:14] from the presence of God? Remember he
[20:16] told the bride, "You lay in the
[20:18] presence. Don't run from the presence."
[20:20] He's showing you that the message is the
[20:23] presence of God in this age. And it's
[20:26] not something to run from. It's our
[20:28] obligation to lay in it. Amen. AND LET
[20:31] IT BAKE THE GREENNESS OUT OF OUR LIVES.
[20:34] And in the middle of man running from
[20:35] his presence now, the next services,
[20:37] he's fisting to preach. He's fisting to
[20:39] teach who's this Melazdc this day, the
[20:41] scripture. And he's going to teach
[20:43] marriage and divorce. Amen. Amen. And I
[20:46] think also what the attraction same same
[20:48] set of sermons. Amen. And and he says
[20:50] this. He says in the end of man running
[20:52] from the presence they're having a
[20:54] wonderful uh altar meeting. The spirit
[20:56] is moving and brother Bam just starts
[20:58] screaming out. HE SAID AND MANY OF YOUR
[21:00] SORROWS shall be turned to joy. He said
[21:03] that's prophecy now. Amen. And you know
[21:05] the very next services he stands there
[21:08] in marriage and divorce and looks out
[21:10] across that crowd and he says what you
[21:12] have done is wrong. He said, "But as the
[21:15] son of man on the earth," remember he
[21:17] says, "I forgive you in the name of the
[21:19] Lord, GO DON'T DO IT ANYMORE." LISTEN,
[21:21] WILLIAM BRANDHAM didn't have the power
[21:23] to FORGIVE SINS. FOLKS, THAT WASN'T
[21:25] WILLIAM BRANDOM EXCUSING THEIR MARRIAGE
[21:27] AND DIVORCE PROBLEMS. THAT WAS THE
[21:29] VOICE. THAT WAS THE VOICE OF HIM THAT
[21:32] MADE THE PROMISE, "YOUR SORROW SHALL BE
[21:35] TURNED into joy."
[21:37] I'LL TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL
[21:38] REALLY have a revelation at times or an
[21:41] understanding of the reality OF WHAT
[21:43] WE'RE HEARING when this message is
[21:45] coming TO US. IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER
[21:48] CHURCH AGE. IT'S NOT A LAW OR A PROPHET.
[21:51] IT IS THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTED son
[21:54] of God. No wonder Brother BRANDON WILL
[21:56] SCREAM OUT, "AMEN. I AM GOD'S VOICE TO
[21:58] YOU."
[22:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, AMEN. The sorrows will be
[22:03] turned to joy. The seals breaks the
[22:05] answers. Now, Brother Brandham, how many
[22:07] realize this he was fulfilling more than
[22:10] one commission when he was in the earth?
[22:11] He was the spirit of Moses. He was the
[22:13] spirit of Elijah. And he also was the
[22:16] spirit of Joshua.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was also the spirit of Joshua.
[22:21] God bless you, Sister Darlene. Good to
[22:23] have you home. Amen. Canada couldn't
[22:25] keep you. Amen. Amen. You know, it it's
[22:28] a uh it's a beautiful thing when you
[22:30] WHEN YOU START SEEING HOW THE the
[22:32] scriptures will open these areas to to
[22:35] OUR HEARTS. WHEN BROTHER BRANDON WOULD
[22:37] STAND THERE AND SAY, "WHAT'S my
[22:38] commission? Drop a Bible. It opens to
[22:40] the book of Joshua." He he said, "I was
[22:42] praying one day and out of the heavens
[22:44] come the book of THE BIBLE AND IT opened
[22:47] to the first chapters of Joshua and a
[22:49] finger just started reading the book of
[22:52] Joshua and that was his commission." Now
[22:54] the THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN this
[22:56] generation is that we can look back at
[22:58] the dispensations and we know
[23:00] dispensation is true and we can see two
[23:03] men. We can see Moses and we can see
[23:05] Joshua and we can mark the change of
[23:07] that dispensation. We can see John the
[23:10] Baptist and we can see Jesus and we can
[23:12] mark the changes of that dispensation.
[23:14] BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[23:16] AMEN, he's introducing one who is
[23:19] invisible and is LITERALLY USING HIS
[23:22] BODY. AMEN. AND PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO
[23:25] UNDERSTAND THIS THAT THE THAT THE
[23:27] PROPHET IS SAYING, "I'M NOT HIM, BUT
[23:29] HE'S HERE." SO, IT'S A SON OF MAN
[23:32] REVEALING THE SON OF MAN. BUT JUST
[23:34] BECAUSE IT WAS A SON OF MAN, DON'T MEAN
[23:37] THE SON OF MAN WASN'T DOING THE TALKING.
[23:40] AMEN. AND IF YOU CAN EVER SEE THAT, THAT
[23:42] WAS A JOSHUA MINISTRY. JOSHUA WAS THERE
[23:46] TO DIVIDE THE INHERITANCE OF THE
[23:49] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. HE TOOK THEM BY NAME
[23:51] AND UNDER INSPIRATION, PLACED THEM BY
[23:55] INSPIRATION. Oh my goodness. He took the
[23:58] word and applied it to the individual.
[24:00] And that's exactly the ministry of
[24:02] William Brham was TO TAKE THE BIBLE IN
[24:05] THE END TIME SCRIPTURES AND SEPARATE IT
[24:08] TO THE BRIDE OF CHRIST AND SAY THIS
[24:10] BELONGS to you. This belongs to you.
[24:13] This belongs to you. No, you can't have
[24:16] that. That's the Jews and and that
[24:18] belongs to to the foolish virgins.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see HE HE WAS ABLE to tell you
[24:25] who YOU ARE,
[24:26] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH HIM. THAT SECOND PULL, your
[24:30] name is your address is what's ON YOUR
[24:32] HEART. THIS HE COULD HE COULD HE COULD
[24:34] PLACE THAT PERSON EVERY TIME. BUT THAT
[24:37] THIRD PULL WAS SAYING WHAT YOUR NAME WAS
[24:39] BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN. HE WAS CALLING
[24:42] THE MYSTERY OF YOUR NAME. PLACING YOU IN
[24:45] A BRIDE AGE TELLING YOU EVERY PROMISE IN
[24:48] THE BOOK IS YOURS. YOU'RE NOT AN ANGEL.
[24:50] Never will be.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU'RE NOT A SERVANT. YOU NEVER
[24:55] WILL BE. YOU'RE SONS. YOU ALWAYS WERE
[24:57] SONS. I'M IDENTIFYING YOU AS SONS. THIS
[25:00] IS YOUR INHERITANCE AND THIS IS WHAT GOD
[25:02] has done for you.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see what it was? It was a it was
[25:06] a dividing of it. Now, now, now if you
[25:08] if you watch the Bible, it's it's you
[25:10] got to be so careful to not become your
[25:12] own absolute.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's one of the biggest
[25:17] arguments in in the world that I know of
[25:19] right now. And some of the message ranks
[25:21] even and I I don't think it should be an
[25:22] argument anymore, but the absolute
[25:24] people say, "Well, the Bible's my
[25:26] absolute." And you know I I agree that's
[25:28] a very good statement. The Bible is an
[25:29] absolute
[25:31] &gt;&gt; but you know every good Baptist has got
[25:33] a Bible
[25:34] &gt;&gt; and most good Lutheran and most good
[25:37] Wesleans and and a lot of good Christian
[25:40] nominal Christian people has got a Bible
[25:42] and and they would die to prove to you
[25:46] that this is the inherent word of God.
[25:49] But they use that same Bible
[25:52] &gt;&gt; and they'll tell you that you're
[25:53] supposed to be baptized in a trinitarian
[25:56] doctrine.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Come on now. The women will cut their
[26:01] hair and you can take the Bible THEY SAY
[26:03] HAS NO error in it
[26:05] &gt;&gt; and turn to first Corinthians and read
[26:06] out of the Bible where the hair is a
[26:08] covering to a woman and she shouldn't
[26:10] pray without her hair covered,
[26:12] &gt;&gt; her head covered. You can read it right
[26:14] OUT OF THE BIBLE. AMEN. But they have a
[26:16] different interpretation of it.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE
[26:20] INTERPRETATIONS OF all the denominations
[26:22] is wrong. AMEN. BUT WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
[26:24] to not have our own absolute.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; And become our own absolute. See, and
[26:28] let THE WORD OF GOD SAY WHAT IT SAYS AND
[26:31] BE WHAT IT IS WITHOUT US GETTING IN THE
[26:33] WAY. YOU KNOW, usually when usually when
[26:36] someone doesn't when they really have a
[26:38] problem with you saying, "Brother Bam's
[26:39] an an absolute authority on it." When
[26:41] usually what they're really saying is,
[26:43] "I have some scripture. I don't agree
[26:45] with Brother Brandham's interpretation."
[26:47] Yeah,
[26:47] &gt;&gt; that's usually really what's being said.
[26:49] It's kind of hid back there, but you
[26:51] know, we got we got preachers today and
[26:53] I I I don't I don't mean to be mean, but
[26:55] we got people that don't have a
[26:56] congregation. They just got a YouTube
[26:58] channel or something. They don't have no
[27:00] miracles. They don't have no signs. They
[27:02] don't have nothing. There's nothing that
[27:03] God has done to confirm them. Amen. But
[27:06] yet they take brother Bam's sermons and
[27:09] try to tell people why they shouldn't
[27:10] believe him or where he was wrong on
[27:12] this or where he was wrong on this or
[27:14] brother Bam, you know, he he should have
[27:16] did this and he should have said IT LIKE
[27:18] THIS. LET ME TELL YOU, THAT'S THE VOICE
[27:20] OF THE SERPENT.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SAME VOICE THAT SPOKE TO EVE
[27:24] in the Garden of Eden. Amen. Because he
[27:27] became an interpreter OF WHAT GOD SPOKE
[27:30] TO HER. WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS
[27:32] JUST TOOK THE WORD OF GOD AND SAID AMEN
[27:35] TO THE WORD OF GOD AND THEN SHE COULD
[27:37] HAVE LIVED IN FAITH AND SHE COULD HAVE
[27:39] LIVED IN HAPPINESS. AMEN. AMEN. LISTEN.
[27:41] AMEN. YOU YOU WE GET SO AFRAID
[27:43] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO THINK WE'RE dumb or
[27:46] that we DON'T HAVE THE GREATEST
[27:47] INTELLIGENCE. LISTEN, YOU THINK ANYTHING
[27:49] YOU WANT ABOUT WAYNE LAWSON, BUT I'M
[27:51] DUMB ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. I'M
[27:54] DUMB AND I'M NOT SO SMART THAT I HAVE TO
[27:56] HAVE AN ANSWER FOR EVERY LITTLE PERSON
[27:58] AND EVERYTHING. I'VE GOT AN ANSWER FROM
[28:01] GOD. JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND SENT
[28:04] THIS MESSAGE AMONG US. AND IT'S A
[28:06] VINDICATED TRUTH. IT'S A VINDICATED WORD
[28:09] OF GOD. AND THE VOICES THAT AGREE WITH
[28:12] IT, AMEN. I CAN TRUST THAT VOICE. And
[28:14] the VOICE THAT DISAGREES WITH IT, THANK
[28:17] YOU. You told me who you are. That's
[28:19] right.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; I don't have to ask. If you'll listen,
[28:21] they'll tell you who they are. When they
[28:23] say, "Well, Brother Ram said this and
[28:24] this and this, but
[28:27] &gt;&gt; I think it's like this and this." And
[28:29] and I say thank you. Thank you for
[28:30] explaining to me your view so as I know
[28:34] not to listen to you.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; There will come a time in THIS MESSAGE
[28:41] &gt;&gt; WHERE PEOPLE WILL GET ENOUGH STRENGTH
[28:43] AND courage to tell these men, you're
[28:46] not saying WHAT PAUL SAID. NOW SHUT UP
[28:48] AND SIT DOWN.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S UNINSPIRED LEADERSHIP THAT'S TRYING
[28:53] TO BUILD THEIR OWN KINGDOMS AMONG GOD'S
[28:55] PEOPLE. AMEN. AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
[28:57] KINGDOMS. AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH EIGHTH
[28:59] DAY MESSENGERS AND AND AND AND MESSAGE
[29:02] FIXERS. WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE MESSAGE
[29:05] FIXERS. WE NEED SOME MESSAGE BELIEVERS.
[29:07] WE NEED SOME SONS OF GOD THAT HAVE
[29:10] DECIDED THIS MESSAGE IS TRUE.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE IT. I THINK IT'S
[29:15] TIME. AMEN. THAT WE STAND IN OUR IN OUR
[29:18] GOD-GIVEN INHERITANCE AND TELL THE
[29:21] DEVIL, "GET OUT OF IT."
[29:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. That's right. That's
[29:24] right. Well,
[29:25] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Do you see what it is? You got to be
[29:31] careful because when you start letting
[29:33] spirits interpret it, you're going to
[29:35] end up the antichrist in a minute if
[29:36] you're not careful.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Y'all know, y'all know Peter tried to do
[29:41] that, don't you?
[29:42] &gt;&gt; When the Lord said, "Somebody's going to
[29:44] betray me," the Bible said Peter said,
[29:45] "Lord, is it me?" Where in the world,
[29:48] and how in the world could Peter ever
[29:50] arrive at the idea HE'S THE ANTICHRIST?
[29:54] JUDAS HAD THAT POSITION from before the
[29:56] world began.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; But Peter becoming his own absolute
[30:03] &gt;&gt; is now trying to apply Hebrews 6 to
[30:05] himself.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Let me let me just tell you right quick.
[30:11] When when you're a believer and the
[30:12] devil's trying to apply Hebrews 10 to
[30:14] you, let me tell you, you're out of
[30:16] place.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; That is that that scripture has nothing
[30:20] to do with a message believer at all.
[30:23] That's right.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; It is completely to unbelievers that
[30:27] have heard of the death, burial, and
[30:29] resurrection and but don't believe it.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; It's not talking about you made a
[30:34] failure.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Now,
[30:37] &gt;&gt; now there was an antichrist. There was
[30:39] one. Right.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus talks to Peter, remember
[30:43] what he said to him? He said, "Now
[30:45] Peter, Satan would desire to sift thee a
[30:47] sin,
[30:48] &gt;&gt; but I have prayed for thee.
[30:52] Why not just let the security of the
[30:55] prayer of Jesus Christ
[30:57] &gt;&gt; become the arms of comfort OVER EVERY
[31:00] LISTEN, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DEVIL
[31:02] THROWS AT ME. JESUS PRAYED A
[31:04] THANKSGIVING PRAYER FOR ME AND SAID,
[31:06] "FATHER, I THANK THEE THAT THOU HAST
[31:09] GIVEN THESE UNTO ME WHICH YOU GAVE ME
[31:11] BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN." WELL, I TELL
[31:13] YOU, IF I'M GOING TO PUT MY name
[31:14] somewhere, I'm going to PUT IT RIGHT
[31:16] THERE.
[31:18] I'M GOING TO TELL THE DEVIL, "HEY, HEY,
[31:19] I ALREADY KNOW WHO I AM. I ALREADY know
[31:22] where I belong." DO YOU SEE THIS? AMEN.
[31:25] JUDAS WAS JUDAS'S position couldn't BE
[31:27] TOOK BY PETER because Peter HAD A
[31:30] COMPLETE DIFFERENT PLACE.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; But the minute you start trying to self-
[31:35] interpret, you'll get yourself over
[31:37] there in that place.
[31:39] it. I I don't know if you I I wished I
[31:42] had the ability to to to to to show you
[31:45] the real meaning behind letting someone
[31:48] alter
[31:50] &gt;&gt; because what it's doing is if you see if
[31:52] you can't believe brother Bam on this
[31:54] point
[31:55] &gt;&gt; when it comes to committing blasphemy
[31:57] because you failed you you you're
[32:00] already undermined.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Do do you see what the devil's doing? He
[32:04] undermines you over here on something
[32:06] small.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother man, maybe he didn't know
[32:08] what he's talking about. Well, when it
[32:10] comes to something important, how are
[32:12] you going to automatically have a
[32:14] perfect faith again?
[32:15] &gt;&gt; So, Satan undermines you on the small
[32:18] thing. Amen. So, then people say, "Well,
[32:20] I think brother Wayne's nearly
[32:21] idolatrous about not arguing with a
[32:23] prophet." Well, let me tell you why I
[32:24] don't argue with A PROPHET. CUZ WHEN GOD
[32:26] GOT ME, I WAS JUST A HILLBILLY. AMEN.
[32:29] OUT THERE IN THE MUCK AND MIRE. I DIDN'T
[32:31] EVEN WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I WASN'T
[32:33] TRYING TO BE A CHRISTIAN. GOD COME AND
[32:35] GUIDE ME AND CALLED ME AND SHOWED ME
[32:38] THIS MESSAGE AND EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.
[32:41] EVERY BIT OF GIFT, EVERY BIT OF
[32:42] MINISTRY, EVERY BIT OF BLESSING IN MY
[32:45] LIFE HAS COME BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHAT THE
[32:48] PROPHET OF GOD HAD TO SAY. I REFUSE TO
[32:51] LET SOMEBODY RIP that away from me.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Well,
[32:56] &gt;&gt; amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; By the way, it goes too far. Well, I I
[33:00] tell you why. I'm too far to help. So,
[33:01] leave me alone. Amen. [laughter]
[33:05] &gt;&gt; I'M HAPPY JUST LIKE I am.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; I I sleep at night. I don't worry about
[33:11] my predestination. I don't worry about
[33:13] baptism. I don't worry about marriage
[33:15] and divorce. I don't WORRY ABOUT THE
[33:16] TRINITY. I don't worry ABOUT THE
[33:17] GODHEAD. I DON'T WORRY ABOUT NONE OF IT
[33:20] CUZ I'VE GOT A A VOICE THAT HAS ANSWERED
[33:23] IT IN AND SAID, "AMEN. JUST REST. JUST
[33:26] REST. THIS YOUR MARCH. IT'S A RESTING
[33:28] TIME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEARY NO MORE.
[33:31] YOU DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE NO MORE.
[33:33] DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ANY VOICE.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REST, young people.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; You can rest with this message.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU SEE NOW WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[33:46] You must not become your own private
[33:48] interpreter of scripture.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; What?
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Watch this. IN SECOND PETER. NOW PETER
[33:53] Peter's the one he was up on the
[33:55] mountain. See, and he had his
[33:56] interpretation and that voice said, "Now
[33:58] hush up, Peter. Hear you him."
[34:01] Peter self interprets and had himself as
[34:04] the antichrist.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; And now watch in second Peter 1, he's
[34:08] telling about that holy mountain. He
[34:09] said, "We have a more sure word of
[34:11] prophecy and we do that we take heed as
[34:14] a light that shineth in a dark place
[34:18] until the day dawn and the day star
[34:20] arise in our hearts." Y'all know that
[34:21] day star is vindicated word, right?
[34:24] &gt;&gt; It's the message coming.
[34:27] KNOWING THIS FIRST,
[34:30] you got to know this one.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; No prophecy of the scripture is of any
[34:36] private interpretation.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; FOR THE PROPHECY CAME not in old time by
[34:42] the will of man, BUT BY HOLY MEN OF God
[34:45] spoke as they were moved by the Holy
[34:47] Ghost. It is of no private
[34:49] interpretation.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet said there, see the
[34:53] scripture is of no private
[34:54] interpretation. And it was wrote by the
[34:56] Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is the
[34:58] only one who can reveal it. For it is
[35:01] hid from the eyes of wise and prudent,
[35:03] revealed unto babes. Y'all know that's
[35:05] the Bible. So if you don't watch it, if
[35:07] you don't use the mind of the Holy
[35:09] Spirit to put it together, you'll have a
[35:11] scene that's all mixed up. For instance,
[35:14] like a cow picking grass in the top of a
[35:17] tree.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; See, people say, "Well, brother, that's
[35:22] a crazy thought." Now, here's the same
[35:24] thing. Brother Bam likens some of the
[35:27] thinking of the church to that that
[35:29] amazingly out of place. He said it's
[35:32] about some of the way things look when
[35:34] they think that we could go to heaven by
[35:36] shaking the hands of a preacher
[35:38] &gt;&gt; or being baptized in water or some
[35:40] little creed that we repeat. How
[35:42] ridiculous is that?
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Right. right
[35:46] &gt;&gt; now. I I I um I I I should have got with
[35:50] Abby before the service and had her make
[35:52] me a draw and I I was thinking about it.
[35:54] I I was thinking about I I had AI to
[35:57] generate me one, but they couldn't get
[35:58] the picture. You know, they they they
[36:00] didn't get what Brother Bam was saying.
[36:02] He said, I expressed a few moments ago,
[36:04] Brother Bam was talking about reading
[36:05] between the lines. How many of you got
[36:06] to read between the lines?
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Sure. Read between the lines. Say
[36:10] something between the lines. See, the
[36:12] Bible is like a jigsaw puzzle. Now, here
[36:15] comes another another area of this. It
[36:17] It's like a jigsaw's buzz. If you'll
[36:18] excuse the expression, it's put together
[36:21] the way you look at. You got to have
[36:22] something over here to look at, and if
[36:24] you don't, you'll ruin the scene. See,
[36:26] you'll have a cow picking grass top of
[36:28] the tree, so it won't be right. See,
[36:30] that's the way it is. When you try to
[36:32] put the Bible together with intellectual
[36:34] understanding, you can't do it. It's a
[36:37] spirit written word. It takes the Holy
[36:40] Spirit to put it together.
[36:43] See, the Bible is not a Lego block. It's
[36:47] a jigsaw puzzle.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Now, Legos will go together as you're
[36:51] imagining can put it together. You you
[36:53] can build about anything you want out of
[36:55] Legos. They go together so many ways,
[36:57] but a jigsaw puzzle, it already has a
[37:01] picture before you start putting it
[37:03] together. You're trying to match
[37:05] something that's already there. So, when
[37:07] God wrote the Bible, there was an
[37:09] intention he had. Then he put the pieces
[37:11] in the Bible and maybe there's a piece
[37:14] in John and there's a piece in James and
[37:15] there's a piece in Revelations and
[37:17] there's a piece over here IN GENESIS AND
[37:19] HE'LL HAVE PUZZLE PIECES ALL OVER THE
[37:21] BIBLE. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE YOU CAN'T JUST
[37:25] START reading and say, "Well, this is
[37:26] this and this is this and this is this
[37:28] and this." BECAUSE YOU'LL MISS things
[37:32] &gt;&gt; because God MAY PUT A PIECE of the end
[37:34] time in THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER SCRIPTURE.
[37:37] AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE AUTHOR, you'll
[37:39] think it applies to a different age.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[37:41] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'LL JUST PROVE IT to you in Isaiah
[37:43] 61. You heard it. And when Jesus picks
[37:45] up Isaiah 61 and begins to read, he only
[37:48] reads half of the of the first verse of
[37:50] Isaiah 61. And he said, "The spirit of
[37:53] the Lord is upon me to preach the
[37:55] acceptable year of the Lord." and
[37:56] stopped and said this DAY THIS
[37:58] SCRIPTURE. THAT'S ONLY HALF OF that
[38:00] scripture.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ISAIAH SPOKE IT, HE SAID IT IN
[38:03] ONE HE SAID IT IN ONE VERSE. HE DIDN'T
[38:06] HE didn't break it. He put a period in
[38:08] there. AND HOW WAS WE SUPPOSED to know
[38:10] that that would be a 20 a 2,000 year
[38:14] space at one period in the Bible. BUT
[38:17] SEE, WHEN A PROPHET COMES ALONG, THE
[38:19] AUTHOR, JESUS, KNEW NOT TO READ ANYMORE
[38:22] THAT BECAUSE THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE
[38:25] AIN'T put in the puzzle to 2,000 years
[38:27] later.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; But but a theologian couldn't catch
[38:31] that.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz literary sciences don't write things
[38:36] like that.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Right. Now, now if you if you could I
[38:40] wish I had the ability to have a picture
[38:42] to show you, but if you took a jigsaw
[38:44] puzzle and you had a cow eating grass
[38:46] and you had a big tree and it was all
[38:49] right there in the puzzle, but then you
[38:51] start putting it together and you know
[38:55] with uh with uh how could I say with
[38:58] perceptions, you could have a cow eating
[39:00] grass, but if you don't put the borders
[39:02] of the puzzle on, you don't finish the
[39:05] puzzle. You could by perception you
[39:08] could make it look like that THAT THAT
[39:09] THAT TREE IS THE ground and you'd have
[39:12] that cow eaten right out of that tree.
[39:14] SEE, BROTHER RAMA IS TRYING TO SHOW YOU
[39:16] until the whole puzzle is put together
[39:18] correctly, you'll never really
[39:21] understand what those things are. It has
[39:24] to wait till the end time. That's why
[39:27] THAT THIS MESSAGE COULDN'T COME IN THE
[39:29] THIRD AGE OF THE FOURTH AGE BECAUSE WE
[39:32] DIDN'T HAVE THE WHOLE PICTURE. But in
[39:34] the last age, here comes a prophet along
[39:37] and he's explaining the puzzle. It's a
[39:40] jigsaw puzzle. It already has a picture.
[39:43] So when you're preaching the message, it
[39:45] must match
[39:46] &gt;&gt; what's already been spoken.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; See, when you try to put it together,
[39:51] Brother Brandham says it'll take a
[39:53] spiritual revelation. See, the Holy
[39:55] Spirit will reveal it or we'll fail to
[39:57] get it. And somebody says, "Well,
[39:59] Brother Wayne, I know the word." And
[40:01] brother Brandham says, "Yep, Satan does,
[40:03] too.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And Satan argued scripture with Jesus
[40:09] himself in Matthew the 4th chapter."
[40:12] &gt;&gt; He argued scripture with Jesus.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK PIECES OF THE PUZZLE. AMEN. In
[40:18] the book of Psalms and quoted them back
[40:20] TO JESUS AND TRIED TO GET THE
[40:24] DISLOCATION of the word by his
[40:26] interpreting like he did to Eve.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "Satan knows
[40:32] scriptures, too."
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; But he don't know how to rightly divide
[40:36] them.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; That's pretty awesome, isn't it?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Now, when Jesus heard the wrong the
[40:43] scriptures being preached wrong, when
[40:45] Jesus heard that, now Jesus didn't
[40:48] disagree with David because David said,
[40:50] "The angel shall bear thee up." You
[40:52] don't catch Jesus looking at the devil
[40:54] because the devil's putting the word on
[40:56] him. David was just wrong. You know that
[40:59] that that quote's wrong. That it's just
[41:02] &gt;&gt; he he didn't [clears throat] disallow
[41:05] what Satan was saying.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; He just showed him it was put in the
[41:09] wrong place.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't say it wasn't a puzzle piece
[41:13] or it didn't belong or that this is not
[41:15] good. HE JUST SHOWED HIM YOU'RE
[41:18] MISAPPLYING IT.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND AND he didn't know how TO PUT
[41:22] IT TOGETHER. WATCH the scripture. 2
[41:24] Timothy 3 and verse 16. I love this
[41:26] scripture and and it gets more brilliant
[41:29] to me w with every sermon or with every
[41:31] day I live ON THE EARTH. ALL SCRIPTURE,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; SAY IT WITH ME. ALL SCRIPTURE
[41:38] &gt;&gt; IS GIVEN by inspiration of God and is
[41:41] profitable for doctrine, for reprove,
[41:43] for correction, FOR INSTRUCTION IN
[41:44] RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOT SOME OF THE
[41:46] SCRIPTURE, ALL THE SCRIPTURE.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; My when you think about IT LIKE THAT,
[41:52] ALL THE SCRIPTURE is the truth. Yeah,
[41:55] that's right.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; BUT WATCH IN 2 Timothy 2 and 15, Paul
[41:59] instructing a YOUNG MAN AS HE'S going to
[42:02] go into the world and preach THE GOSPEL.
[42:04] AND HE SAID, "STUDY TO show thyself
[42:07] approved of God."
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; A workman,
[42:11] &gt;&gt; he needeth not to be shamed, rightly
[42:15] dividing the word of truth. Now look at
[42:18] Paul telling Timothy, Timothy, not every
[42:21] word that you read is in season. NOT
[42:25] EVERY WORD, IT'S ALL GOOD FOR DOCTRINE.
[42:27] It's all true, but you have to divide it
[42:30] in the put it in the right places.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; It has to be rightly divided. See, a
[42:36] workman, and I don't have time to preach
[42:38] this, but I I'll just let it let it put
[42:40] in your mind here. Amen. A workman,
[42:42] brother Bram says it. the a workman.
[42:44] See, a workman has to know what day of
[42:47] the week it is.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; He said you can't do this is a future
[42:51] home. He says you can't do uh uh
[42:54] Tuesday's work. Can't be done on
[42:55] Wednesday. And he said Wednesdays can't
[42:58] be done on uh uh uh uh it's got to be
[43:00] done on Wednesday and Saturdays has to
[43:02] be Saturday's work. [clears throat]
[43:05] &gt;&gt; What the world? Hey man, what he's
[43:07] telling you is this is not Saturday.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. This is Sunday.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE WEEK.
[43:18] THIS IS THE FIRST DAY AGAIN. AND BROTHER
[43:20] BAM IS TELLING YOU RIGHT HERE. HE'S
[43:22] SAYING A WORKMAN MUST RIGHTLY divide and
[43:25] know what day he's WORKING ON. THIS IS
[43:28] NOT JUST ANOTHER PENTECOSTAL AGE. THIS
[43:31] IS THE AGE OF THE BRIDE. IT'S IT'S WHEN
[43:34] GOD IS BRINGING THE RESURRECTION OF THE
[43:36] CHURCH.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; NOW, watch what he's doing. He's saying
[43:39] it's not Saturday. It's Sunday. If you
[43:42] like to see that in the rising of the
[43:43] sun, brother Bram says it very clearly.
[43:45] He said, "This is the sheath to be waved
[43:47] and the Sabbath, the seventh day, but on
[43:49] the first day called Sunday." Of course,
[43:51] that's a Roman word how it's changed.
[43:54] But it's not su n anymore. It's s y it's
[43:58] Sunday that the corn, God's first one is
[44:01] up, waved over the congregation. See,
[44:04] the first seed of those that slept has
[44:06] been waved. Amen. Now, you you say,
[44:08] "Preacher, what the world are you
[44:09] talking about?" I'm talking about the
[44:11] ministry of Jesus Christ.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; In its season, the work that is to be
[44:17] done, God is working in this season. And
[44:20] this is a predestinated season.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; And God can only reveal the word in its
[44:27] season.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Uh right now we're coming
[44:30] into August and you know uh we're coming
[44:33] in very very strongly right here to
[44:35] August. But you know, Amen. It ain't
[44:37] going to be long and it's going to be
[44:38] December.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; See, but you see so you wouldn't start,
[44:42] Amen, a May crop in the middle of August
[44:44] cuz it's the wrong season.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; It's just like somebody go out and plant
[44:48] seed in February and get mad at the seed
[44:50] company cuz they don't GET A CROP.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU YOU CAN'T get mad at the Lord
[44:56] that you don't get what you want when
[44:57] you don't plant according to the season.
[45:00] You can't take the word of the wrong age
[45:03] and then expect to get the same thing
[45:05] you would if you operated according to
[45:07] the season. Now, amen. There's a there's
[45:09] a lot in this and I I'm going to
[45:11] continue here to just in the scripture
[45:13] in Matthew 24. Watch the 45th and 46th
[45:16] verse where Jesus said, "What is the
[45:18] faithful and wise servant? He see the
[45:20] Lord made ruler over his household to
[45:23] give them meat in due season."
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so the message there, there's
[45:29] a season for the word of God,
[45:31] &gt;&gt; and the word has to come into that
[45:33] season. And brother Bandam talks to us
[45:35] about spiritual food in due season.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Now, we're we're we're discussing
[45:41] Hebrews 1 and two. Don't don't lose
[45:43] where we are. We're discussing Hebrews
[45:45] and we're discussing Paul saying that
[45:48] God in various times and various ways,
[45:50] HE'S DEALT WITH PEOPLE, BUT IN THE LAST
[45:53] DAYS, he'll speak through his son. So
[45:55] he's telling you there is dispensations.
[45:58] How many believes in dispensations?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Sure. Brother Ba says in questions and
[46:03] answers he said now you people that
[46:05] don't believe in gentile dis and
[46:06] dispensations. What about that? See
[46:09] Jesus said Jerusalem would be trod down
[46:12] until the times of the Gentiles.
[46:14] Uh Luke 21:24.
[46:17] Jesus using until the times of the
[46:19] Gentiles be fulfilled.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Right. So there's a gentile age and
[46:25] there's a Jewish age.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Dispensations.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter one, we find out
[46:32] that the Bible said that in the
[46:34] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[46:37] &gt;&gt; kind of like I was talking to a guy one
[46:39] time on a job and I was I was running a
[46:41] doer and he was out there with me and we
[46:43] got to talking one day and he was a he
[46:45] was a Pentecostal fellow, good guy. He
[46:47] says to me, we got to talking, I said
[46:49] something about predestination. He said,
[46:50] "I don't believe that."
[46:52] I said, "You don't believe in that?" He
[46:54] said, "No, I don't believe in that." I
[46:55] said, "You got a you got a Bible?" He
[46:57] carried a New Testament right in his
[46:58] front pocket all the time.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; So, he pulled that New Testament out out
[47:02] there on the road job, you know, rough
[47:03] rough neck bunch of guys. And this guy's
[47:05] got a Bible. He pulls out his Bible. I
[47:08] said, "Turn to Ephesians chapter 1."
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And he began to read and when he got
[47:12] down about, I think it's the fifth
[47:13] verse, isn't it? And therefore, being
[47:14] predestinated under the adoption, he
[47:16] said, "Oh my goodness." [laughter]
[47:18] I SAID, "TURN THAT Bible right over to
[47:20] Romans the 8th chapter and let's go down
[47:21] there around the 25th to the 29th verse
[47:23] and let's read that." And he got to
[47:25] reading there in two places just in a
[47:26] moment. I showed him with the word
[47:27] predestination was in the Bible. And I
[47:29] said, "You don't believe in
[47:30] predestination?" He said, "Well, I do
[47:31] now."
[47:35] He said, "I just read IT RIGHT OUT OF
[47:36] THE BIBLE." [laughter]
[47:38] I said, "Yeah." You see, people say they
[47:40] don't believe in dispensations. Well,
[47:41] they just never read the Bible
[47:44] &gt;&gt; because the Bible is clear in saying
[47:46] like 2 Timothy 2, it says rightly
[47:49] dividing the word of truth. 1
[47:50] Corinthians 9:17, the Bible says, "For
[47:54] this the thing willfully I have reward,
[47:56] but if against my will, a dispensation
[47:59] of the gospel is committed unto me."
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Watch Ephesians 3 and2. If you heard of
[48:06] the dispensation of the grace of God
[48:09] which is given to me, you were. So God
[48:12] gave Paul something for the people and
[48:14] that was the dispensation. And
[48:17] Colossians 1:25, WHEREFORE I AM MADE A
[48:20] MINISTER ACCORDING TO THE dispensation
[48:22] of God WHICH IS GIVEN TO me for you.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Do you SEE DISPENSATION? IT ACTUALLY
[48:29] means a stewardship. It means a
[48:32] management of a household or household
[48:34] affairs. a property, a manager,
[48:36] overseer, an administrator. It's a
[48:38] dispensation. In other words, IT'S THAT
[48:40] GOD IS GIVING SOMETHING to you at a
[48:43] certain time and he's dispensing it
[48:46] through this area. Of course, Paul,
[48:49] amen, is showing them the dispensation
[48:52] that's given him is is not the
[48:54] dispensation of law and prophets. He's
[48:57] saying, "I have the gospel of God."
[48:59] Amen. THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST HAS
[49:02] COME TO ME AND I KNOW NOTHING but Jesus
[49:04] buried and resurrected and I KNOW HIM IN
[49:07] THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Look at look at this. LOOK AT THE
[49:12] REALITY OF HIS DISPENSATIONAL TEACHING.
[49:14] NOW, IF YOU'RE a dispensation, Amen.
[49:17] It's pretty pretty good study. The
[49:18] biggest and most obvious dispensations
[49:20] are the Old Testament, New Testament.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; That's the biggest and the most obvious
[49:24] that you could see. Uh you could you can
[49:26] take it all the way back into the
[49:28] undeliv world and you can see in the
[49:31] book of Peter the Bible said and they
[49:33] perished. The old world perished but man
[49:36] used the future home right and he says
[49:38] it didn't it didn't annihilate. He said
[49:41] it ended and he called the world a
[49:43] cosmos.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; See then there is ends of worlds. The
[49:47] book of Isaiah look unto me all ye ends
[49:50] of the earth. Brother said see there's
[49:52] been many ends. It's just like it ended.
[49:55] It perished in the days of Noah. But
[49:57] what happened at that change of
[49:59] dispensation? God sent a prophet among
[50:01] them.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And when it changed, AND THE BIBLE GOES
[50:04] ON TO SAY IN PETER, and he said, "YOU'RE
[50:06] WILLFULLY IGNORANT THAT THE WATERS WOULD
[50:09] OVERFLOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE saying that
[50:11] things continue as they were from our
[50:14] fathers." Y'all know the scripture
[50:16] &gt;&gt; that that he say that THAT PETER IS
[50:17] SAYING to them, scoffers will come in
[50:19] the last day and say, "Where is the
[50:20] promise of his coming?" AND THEY'LL SAY,
[50:22] "THINGS CONTINUE AS THEY WERE FROM THE
[50:23] OLD." He said, "You're willfully
[50:25] ignorant."
[50:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING
[50:28] the whole world was destroyed in the
[50:30] days of Noah and it perished in the
[50:32] floods. And he was TELLING THEM RIGHT
[50:34] THERE, THERE WAS A dispensation of Noah
[50:36] and he had to get on an ark. But listen,
[50:39] if you preach build AN ARK TODAY, HOW
[50:41] SILLY WOULD THAT SOUND?
[50:43] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS EXACTLY true and salvational
[50:46] AT ITS TIME.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; JUST AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF MOSES WHEN
[50:50] HE WAS TELLING THEM, "PUT BLOOD OVER
[50:52] THEIR DOOR." AMEN. TRY THAT FOR
[50:54] SALVATION TODAY.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SALVATION under the blood
[50:58] over a door.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It's it's dispensational. It was for
[51:02] that moment AND FOR THAT TIME AND SO IS
[51:04] IT with Abraham and Moses. Amen. And
[51:07] there were ends of them. So was IT WITH
[51:09] JOHN. AMEN. BUT THERE WAS AN end to
[51:11] that. Amen. We look at that today and
[51:13] see that we are living in a
[51:15] dispensation. Amen. Of of of God that
[51:18] has been given to this age. a dense
[51:20] dispensation that we call the son of
[51:22] man.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Huh?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you're studying the
[51:29] godhead and you you have the father and
[51:31] you have the son and you have the holy
[51:33] ghost, there's dispensations for each,
[51:35] right?
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Fatherhood, the pillar of fire was above
[51:38] us. And all those years he dwelt above
[51:40] us. But then we see the son Emmanuel
[51:43] come to the earth and God dwelt with us.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Right. AMEN. BUT THE FULLNESS OF BOTH of
[51:50] those offices came when Melazdc matured
[51:54] himself and made himself known in those
[51:57] offices.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; So it WASN'T SEE IT WASN'T JUST THE
[52:01] OFFICE OF FATHERHOOD BUT WATCH GOD
[52:04] BROUGHT THAT OFFICE to completion BY
[52:06] IDENTIFYING AMEN WHO IT WAS. IT WAS GOD
[52:09] that talked to Abraham
[52:11] &gt;&gt; and brought a fullness of that office in
[52:13] so much that Jesus standing looked back
[52:16] in that dispensation and he said there's
[52:18] coming another day like it when it was
[52:21] when everything is set like it was then.
[52:23] He said I'm going to revisit the earth
[52:25] like that in that generation. AMEN. AND
[52:28] WATCH WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S pointing to
[52:30] a DISPENSATION THAT HE WILL MANIFEST
[52:33] LIKE HE DID THEN. BUT IT WON'T BE UNDER
[52:35] FATHERHOOD.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; God above us. It won't be Emmanuel, GOD
[52:40] WITH US.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS TIME THE MANIFESTATION WOULD BE
[52:44] GOD IN US
[52:46] &gt;&gt; SHOWING US that there are three
[52:49] dispensations of the fatherhood, son,
[52:51] and the Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost
[52:53] is not FULL UNDER A BAPTISM.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; LOOK, AMEN. I know the Holy Ghost fell
[53:00] back there in 1906 and the rain fell and
[53:03] and the and the and THE HUS FORMED UPON
[53:05] THE SEED. THERE WAS A BAPTISM AND
[53:07] THERE'S REFORMATION OF GIFTS and there's
[53:08] a zoo and there's development OF
[53:10] ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. BUT GOD
[53:13] WASN'T FINISHED RIGHT THERE.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T THE FINISHING OF IT BECAUSE
[53:17] THAT WAS UNDER THE DISPENSATION OF THE
[53:20] SON of God in a HOLY GHOST AGE. BUT
[53:23] THERE WAS COMING THE MANIFESTATION OF A
[53:25] SON OF MAN. IN OTHER WORDS, THE PROPHET
[53:28] OF GOD WOULD HAVE TO MANIFEST THAT SAME
[53:31] ELOHIM. THAT SAME MAZDC WOULD HAVE TO
[53:34] come and manifest himself in the last
[53:36] day. I hope it ain't over your head.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; THEN SOMEBODY SAY AMEN.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, IT'S GOT TO COME AND
[53:42] MANIFEST ITSELF THE SAME TODAY AS IT DID
[53:45] BACK THEN BECAUSE IT IS A DISPENSATION
[53:48] OF THE FULLNESS OF GOD IN THE AGE OF the
[53:51] Holy Ghost.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; My goodness, when I THINK ABOUT THAT,
[53:55] SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, Brother Wayne, we
[53:56] don't have to know these things."
[53:57] Brother Bam said, "YOU MUST KNOW HOW to
[53:59] approach God. Right.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; For healing and salvation,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO APPROACH GOD.
[54:07] YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW. Come on now.
[54:08] Anointing is not just emotion, folks.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AMEN. BROTHER SAID, "WHAT is
[54:14] emotion?" He said, "Supreme power under
[54:17] control. KNOWING THE HOW and the why."
[54:21] &gt;&gt; KNOWING THE HOW AND THE WHY. HOW DO YOU
[54:23] KNOW HOW OR WHY? IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE
[54:26] AGE AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE INSPIRATION
[54:28] AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S SPEAKING. OH,
[54:31] BUT IF YOU EVER GET THE ANOINTING OF
[54:33] GOD, YOU KNOW HOW AND YOU KNOW WHY AND
[54:36] YOU KNOW RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; My goodness, you must know what you're
[54:41] doing and how to do it.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; In Acts CHAPTER 10, WATCH APOSTLE PETER.
[54:47] HE WENT DOWN to the house of Cornelius.
[54:50] And when he comes to the house of
[54:51] Cornelius, listen folks, Peter is a Jew,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; he's on a housetop and dispensations
[55:00] have changed and he's aware to some of
[55:02] the change.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; But he is not aware that God has made
[55:07] such a change.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Now, now think about this because if you
[55:12] go to your Bible,
[55:14] now this could get a little sticky here
[55:16] to some of the vegetarians.
[55:20] But there was a time that you were
[55:22] vegetarian by God's word. How many knows
[55:24] that?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Any vegetarian knows it because they've
[55:26] tried to use the scripture on some
[55:28] meditarian. [laughter]
[55:32] That's me. Meditarian.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That's not proper English, is it?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said God, [laughter]
[55:43] we understand it though. But brother the
[55:46] Bible said God gave them herb to eat
[55:49] &gt;&gt; right in in the garden.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; But after the fall of the garden
[55:54] &gt;&gt; right then then they were expression
[55:56] they could have things
[55:58] &gt;&gt; but then when it come to Noah's day
[56:01] &gt;&gt; after the flood God said to them
[56:04] specifically you can eat anything out
[56:06] here.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And then meat began to come in. Yeah.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Now, there's them places in the Bible,
[56:13] you know, like when God came in the
[56:15] flesh.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham fed him calf.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; You got to be real careful with your
[56:22] doctrines.
[56:25] [laughter]
[56:27] &gt;&gt; He isn't that veil. Ain't that what that
[56:29] is? He He soaked ve and milk,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; fed it. One time, Ronnie Molo, man, he
[56:35] put it on one of them one of them guys
[56:36] over there in in Israel. man, they were
[56:38] they were holding to that law and the
[56:41] the the milk and the the cow and the
[56:43] mother. It's a law. It's and it is God's
[56:46] law. But but brother brother Ronnie said
[56:48] to him, he said, you know, he said,
[56:49] "Y'all's holding that pretty tight." He
[56:51] said, "But what what about Melazdc when
[56:53] he came and they gave him milk and calf
[56:55] at the same time." [laughter]
[56:57] Man, that wasn't funny. He he didn't
[57:00] like that at all. [laughter]
[57:05] But you know, see, so whenever the law
[57:07] came, what they was divided, then we got
[57:09] what we call kosher, right? That's why
[57:10] the Jews, if you ever eat in Israel or
[57:12] around someone that's Jewish, they bleed
[57:15] everything a certain way. And it it's
[57:16] called kosher. It's kosher. The the pans
[57:19] had to be a certain way. This had to be
[57:20] a certain way. And you know, the man
[57:22] that can't eat bacon and everything.
[57:23] What a terrible life. [laughter]
[57:27] That's just horrible, man. No bacon.
[57:34] That was where that was where Peter was
[57:36] sitting,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:38] &gt;&gt; When the angel come to him
[57:40] &gt;&gt; and he seen a vision of them unclean
[57:43] foods
[57:45] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "LORD, I AIN'T EAT NOTHING
[57:47] UNCLEAN."
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And God rebuked him and said, "Don't you
[57:51] call unclean
[57:53] &gt;&gt; that what I've cleansed." Now God was
[57:55] speaking of the Gentiles
[57:58] &gt;&gt; because the dispensation had changed and
[58:01] EVEN THE FOOD THAT they were eating HAD
[58:03] BECOME SO DIFFERENT NOW that even Paul
[58:06] BEGAN TO SAY LATER, AMEN, THAT THAT ALL
[58:09] THINGS ARE LAWFUL. Not all things are
[58:11] expedient unto you, but all things are
[58:13] lawful. SO HE WAS TELLING THEM, DON'T
[58:14] YOU SET YOURSELF UP THINKING, WELL, I
[58:16] don't eat this meat, so I'm better than
[58:18] this guy, and I don't eat this meat. But
[58:20] then he turned around and said, if
[58:21] eating meat offends your brother, THEN
[58:22] DON'T EAT THE MEAT.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[58:24] SO WHAT HE'S DOING IS IS HE'S SHOWING
[58:26] YOU IT WAS SUCH A CHANGE IN
[58:28] DISPENSATION, BUT YET PETER HAD NO
[58:30] REVELATION OF IT. BUT ALL THE SUDDEN ON
[58:33] A HOUSETOP HERE COMES AN ANGEL AND PETER
[58:36] CATCHES THE REVELATION. AMEN. THE
[58:38] GENTILES are accepted. Them pig eating
[58:41] Gentiles.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; THEM THEM THEM IDLE PACKING PIG EATING
[58:46] GENTILES THAT SERVE ALL THOSE GODS.
[58:50] THERE IS A DISPENSATION OF THE GRACE OF
[58:52] GOD THAT JUST BY ME GOING DOWN TO THEIR
[58:55] HOUSE, GLORY BE TO GOD, AND BEGAN TO
[58:58] SPEAK THESE WORDS. THE BIBLE SAID HE
[59:01] SPAKE THESE WORDS. THERE WERE WORDS THAT
[59:05] WERE BEING SPOKEN OVER THEM THAT THEY
[59:07] RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST WHILE HE YET
[59:11] SPAKE BECAUSE GOD WAS DISPENSING GRACE
[59:14] UNTO THE GENTILES BY THE PREACHING OF
[59:17] THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. OH, THAT
[59:20] APOSTOLIC DOCTRINE OF THE PREACHING OF
[59:23] JESUS CHRIST UNDER THE CHURCH OF THE
[59:26] LIVING GOD. AMEN. LISTEN TO ME SAY THIS.
[59:28] WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT DISPENSATION, BUT
[59:30] THAT APOSTOLIC GOSPEL HAS NEVER CHANGED
[59:33] AND IT'LL NEVER CHANGE. BUT MAN SAID,
[59:36] "IT'S AN ETERNAL PRESCRIPTION UNTO THE
[59:38] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD." OH, I LOVE
[59:40] HOW HE SAID IT. THEY SAID TO THEM,
[59:42] "BRETHREN, WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE SAVED?"
[59:44] AND OH, APOSTLE PETER PUT IT IN THE BOOK
[59:46] OF ACTS AND SAID, "REPENT EVERY ONE OF
[59:48] YOU AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[59:51] CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS
[59:54] AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE
[59:56] HOLY GHOST." AND THIS IS UNTO YOU JEWS,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; AND TO YOUR CHILDREN JEWS, AND AS TO
[1:00:03] MANY THAT ARE AS A FAR OFF, EVEN AS MANY
[1:00:06] GOD SHALL CALL. AND THAT'S YOU,
[1:00:08] GENTILES. AS LONG AS GOD IS CALLING,
[1:00:11] HE'S STILL GIVEN THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN.
[1:00:14] WE'RE IN A DISPENSATION OF THE SON OF
[1:00:16] MAN. BUT THE WORD HAS NEVER BEEN TAKEN
[1:00:19] OUT CONCERNING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:00:22] GHOST TO THE CHURCH. LISTEN, YOU CAN'T
[1:00:24] GET IN HEAVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:00:26] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm going to say Holy Ghost.
[1:00:29] I'm not ashamed of Holy Ghost.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; And people have said Holy Spirit
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; cuz they're ashamed of them Pentecostal
[1:00:36] tongue talking word children. Brother
[1:00:38] Bam SAID ACTS 2:38 TONGUE- TALKING
[1:00:40] BABIES. LISTEN. AMEN. TONGUE TALKING,
[1:00:43] HOLY GHOST FILING SHOUTING. AMEN. THE
[1:00:46] POWER OF GOD MANIFESTING. AMEN. SOMEBODY
[1:00:49] SAID, "WELL, BROTHER WAYNE, EMOTION'S
[1:00:50] NOT JUST A ANOINTING." I ALREADY TOLD
[1:00:53] YOU I KNOW that one. I KNOW IT'S NOT.
[1:00:55] BUT I HAVE THE ANOINTING. I KNOW THE
[1:00:57] HOW. I KNOW THE WHY. I KNOW THE MESSAGE
[1:01:00] OF THE HOUR. SO I KNOW I CAN SHOUT JUST
[1:01:03] LIKE JOB SHOUTING BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE I
[1:01:06] WAS BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:01:09] IF SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU AND SAYS, "GOD,
[1:01:12] DON'T GIVE THE HOLY GHOST LIKE HE DID ON
[1:01:14] THE DAY OF PENTECOST." THEY ARE A LIAR
[1:01:16] AND OUGHT TO BE THROWN OUT OF THE CHURCH
[1:01:18] OF THE LIVING GOD AS A
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; AS A SERPENT OF OF SATAN HIMSELF. AMEN.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GET TO
[1:01:28] HEAVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU CAN'T
[1:01:30] GET TO HEAVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:01:32] AND UNLESS GOD GIVES THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:01:34] YOU'LL GO IN THE TRIBULATION. SO ANY
[1:01:37] PREACHER SAYING WE DON'T NEED THE HOLY
[1:01:39] GHOST. HE IS A TRIBULATION MINISTRY.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; So Brother Wayne, that's Pentecostal.
[1:01:49] No, that's that's the gospel.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that's awful strong
[1:01:56] language." It's brother Brandham's
[1:01:57] language.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Anything contrary to what he preached,
[1:02:03] he said it is the seed of discrepancy.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; brother. That's what he called it in the
[1:02:09] Bible. Amen. That's what you got to call
[1:02:11] it today,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; The idea that God has changed because
[1:02:19] dispensations have changed. Do you see
[1:02:22] how wrong that thought is?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Paul's whole concept
[1:02:30] is that God, the same God
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; that was with the law and the prophets
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; has advanced his grace
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; into these Gentiles.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; 120 of them received the Holy Ghost,
[1:02:45] which was the dividing of that great
[1:02:47] logos.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; The very God of heaven came into them.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; And days later, Peter went down to
[1:02:56] Cornelius's house and preached the
[1:02:58] gospel of Jesus Christ. And the Bible
[1:03:01] said, "And they received the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost."
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; And they spake with tongues like they
[1:03:07] did at the beginning. And then THEY WERE
[1:03:10] BAPTIZED.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? THEY DIDN'T
[1:03:13] EVEN GET BAPTIZED AFTER THEY GOT THE
[1:03:15] HOLY GHOST.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Good stuff.
[1:03:21] You said, "Preacher, what are you
[1:03:22] talking about?" Dispensations.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; God ain't changed nothing, young people.
[1:03:27] I want to tell you something right now.
[1:03:28] The experience that he gave Ray Ericson
[1:03:30] and he gave Wayne Lawson, the experience
[1:03:32] that he gave these elders in this
[1:03:33] church, he'll give you the same
[1:03:34] experience today.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You do not have to think, well, we've
[1:03:38] come in the son of man. We we've come to
[1:03:40] this great intellectual age, and now God
[1:03:42] ain't doing these things no more.
[1:03:44] LISTEN, I'D RATHER HAVE THE POWER OF
[1:03:45] THIS GOSPEL THAN TO BE ABLE TO READ. I
[1:03:48] don't CARE IF I PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER.
[1:03:50] I WANT TO SEE GOD COME DOWN IN THE
[1:03:53] CHURCH AND FILL HEARTS AND LIVES. AMEN.
[1:03:56] AND AND AND CLENCH LIES WITH HIS POWER.
[1:03:59] LISTEN, FOLKS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAVEN
[1:04:01] TO READ QUOTES. WE'RE GOING TO HEAVEN TO
[1:04:03] WORSHIP A GOD, THE REAL JESUS CHRIST.
[1:04:06] AND WE'RE GOING TO WORSHIP HIM IN POWER
[1:04:09] AND IN DEMONSTRATION. WORSHIPING GOD
[1:04:12] BECAUSE HE IS GOD. THIS IS THIS IS
[1:04:14] DISPENSATIONAL.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; I know we're out of time. That's good.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Do do you see he didn't change his
[1:04:21] power?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Change it.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; The one of the greatest sections of
[1:04:29] scripture that that that proves this to
[1:04:30] me. Well, Jonathan, when our Lord Jesus
[1:04:32] was on the earth, the Bible introduces
[1:04:35] him as the as the son of Abraham, the
[1:04:37] son of David, the son of God, the son of
[1:04:39] man. He was all those,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; wasn't he?
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; According to scripture. And he's walking
[1:04:44] one day
[1:04:46] and blind Barameus wants something from
[1:04:49] him and he cries, "Thou son of David,
[1:04:53] have mercy." And the man found mercy for
[1:04:56] the healing of his eyes.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; That same Jesus was walking and a young
[1:05:02] woman comes and the Bible said that she
[1:05:05] was a Sarapheneician
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; gentile.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us that Jesus had
[1:05:10] went there to hide. Yeah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Now that's something, isn't it?
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; He had went there to hide. But do you
[1:05:17] know what my Bible says?
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be hid from her.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be hid from her. You talking
[1:05:25] I'm talking about Gentiles. Yeah. A
[1:05:26] little while the world seeth no more,
[1:05:27] but you see me, for I will be with you,
[1:05:30] even in you.
[1:05:32] Yeah.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember I I remember
[1:05:35] speaking to brother Tim Puit one time
[1:05:37] and I I actually hit that point right
[1:05:39] there and that Mariah Puit's mother was
[1:05:41] sitting in the congregation and brought
[1:05:43] Mariah up for prayer when that alipcia
[1:05:45] was on her so bad and she come up and
[1:05:47] said, "Brother Wayne, I certainly
[1:05:48] believe I'm the woman that you just
[1:05:50] talked about
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; that I need God for my baby."
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Do you do you see she couldn't be hid?
[1:05:59] And when that Sarapheneician woman when
[1:06:02] Jesus comes to speak to her,
[1:06:06] she's trying to get his attention and
[1:06:09] she calls him thou son of David.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And all that power and everything, he
[1:06:16] never even the Bible said he opened not
[1:06:19] his mouth. He didn't speak one word to
[1:06:22] her.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. That's right. And
[1:06:25] brother Brandon said, "See, it's because
[1:06:26] she had no claim to him at all under
[1:06:31] thou son of David."
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; It would be no different
[1:06:37] in this case. It wouldn't be any
[1:06:40] different than a man's daughter coming
[1:06:42] to him and saying, "Thou husband."
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Now, you my daughters can get they can
[1:06:47] get things from their dad,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; but not as my wife.
[1:06:54] The dispensation was
[1:06:58] that he was her Lord. He was the son of
[1:07:00] man.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And when she changed her when she
[1:07:03] changed when she changed,
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; she found the every bit of the power
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; that he had showed to them Israelites
[1:07:10] and them Jews was that was still there,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; but it had to be approached
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; in the right way.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says, "Do you see that?"
[1:07:20] That's what happened with Hattie.
[1:07:22] Wright.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "You have to know these words."
[1:07:27] Look at Hattie that time, that third
[1:07:29] pull. You remember it? You remember
[1:07:32] that? Everything that woman said the
[1:07:34] right thing.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; You've got to say the right thing to
[1:07:39] God.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Do you see that tonight? It's a
[1:07:42] dispensation.
[1:07:45] It's not that he changed.
[1:07:47] It's the approach to him.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Right? If our musicians could come
[1:07:51] tonight, it's not that he changes.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; I I'm not even close to
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; It's not that he It's not that he
[1:07:58] changes,
[1:08:00] it's our approach to him.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; If you approach God in this age, you
[1:08:08] will have to do it through the message.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; It's not because you got to come to
[1:08:18] William Brandom. That's right.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; It's because the message is the
[1:08:22] fulfillment of the scriptures.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter what his name was.
[1:08:28] Wouldn't matter what brother Bram's name
[1:08:29] was. That that that that is the
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; that's not the important thing.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; It was the vessel. He chose a vessel.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And he manifested what he said. He said
[1:08:41] Luke 17:30 that he would return as the
[1:08:43] son of man. And he did it.
[1:08:46] And he said that Elijah would come and
[1:08:48] he did it.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; And he said that the evening time and he
[1:08:52] did it. Yes,
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; And notice what he said this day, this
[1:08:56] scripture. So he's showing you the
[1:08:57] seasons. And when you catch that season,
[1:09:01] listen, I want to tell you this. When
[1:09:03] you catch the season of the son of man,
[1:09:06] you won't have to guess if that Holy
[1:09:08] Spirit does the same thing in the church
[1:09:10] that it did on the day of Pentecost.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Because you will find a power. You'll
[1:09:15] find the grace of God.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; You'll find that anointing.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's uh you know it it's it's in a
[1:09:23] sometimes in a very strong way I guess
[1:09:25] that you know that you say things but
[1:09:26] when you catch the reality of what
[1:09:28] you're really talking about.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; One time brother Brandham has got a a
[1:09:32] questions and answers and a man a man
[1:09:34] asked brother Brandham. They said,
[1:09:35] "Brother Bam, you were preaching the
[1:09:37] other day and you said that a man can
[1:09:39] live so far above sin
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; that the devil wouldn't know what to do
[1:09:43] with it." Y'all remember that? Yeah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And he said, "But brother Brandham," he
[1:09:47] said, "I got a little problem. You
[1:09:48] saying a man don't have sin because a
[1:09:51] Christian don't have sin." Brother
[1:09:52] Brandham said it. And that guy had a
[1:09:54] problem. And brother Brandham said,
[1:09:54] "You're reading it out of first John."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "But if you would just read
[1:09:58] over a couple more chapters,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; page,"
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; he said, "you'd see the next page." He
[1:10:02] said, "You would see that John 3 says
[1:10:06] that he that is born of God doeth not
[1:10:08] commit sin."
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And he says, "See, brother, what it's
[1:10:12] like." He said, "See, you can't
[1:10:13] disbelieve." He said, "See, he that's
[1:10:15] born of God." He said, "Now, you take a
[1:10:17] man, no matter how religious he is," he
[1:10:20] said, "but maybe he don't believe that
[1:10:22] the Holy Ghost falls the same today as
[1:10:24] it did on the day of Pentecost." He
[1:10:26] said, "See, he's he don't even believe
[1:10:28] God."
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; See, see you you when when you think
[1:10:34] that God has changed in a way that he
[1:10:37] can't do it because he changed
[1:10:39] dispensations.
[1:10:41] But oh, if you stay in that
[1:10:42] dispensation, if it's the dispensation
[1:10:45] of the son of man, and it is, and it's
[1:10:48] the dispensation of a prophetic word
[1:10:50] interpreting the scripture, then if you
[1:10:53] want to know how God acts, go right in
[1:10:55] the message.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Go right in the message and ask, "What
[1:10:58] does God do in the generation I'm living
[1:11:00] in?" And you'll find out he raised the
[1:11:02] dead.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You'll find he heals the sick.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; You'll find that he knows your name. He
[1:11:07] knows your situations. He knows because
[1:11:09] he remains to be a living God.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad tonight to know, aren't
[1:11:14] you? Won't you stand to your feet with
[1:11:16] us? He remains to be a living God.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; This this this apostolic age, it has
[1:11:25] [clears throat] never ceased.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him tonight?
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brian, you got something.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I look back
[1:11:44] on history,
[1:11:46] see [singing] the mighty God
[1:11:49] unveiled.
[1:11:52] [music] He's proving [singing]
[1:11:55] over and over
[1:11:57] that his word can never [music] fail.
[1:12:03] [singing]
[1:12:04] But I can't

[1:12:09] on some past [singing] memorories.

[1:13:33] living in Jesus.

[1:13:39] in his word.
[1:13:42] But now in these [singing] last days,
[1:13:48] I'm beginning
[1:13:50] to [singing] see.
