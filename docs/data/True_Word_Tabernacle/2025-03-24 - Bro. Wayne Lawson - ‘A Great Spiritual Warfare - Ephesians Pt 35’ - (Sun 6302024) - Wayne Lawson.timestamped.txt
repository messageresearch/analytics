[2:47] of the Lord today and to see his grace
[2:49] and his mercy. Amen. Now it's spread
[2:51] forth upon the people of God and Amen.
[2:54] It's a beautiful time to serve the Lord
[2:56] and Amen. A beautiful day to do it.
[2:58] Amen. God bless you. As you have your
[3:01] Bibles today, I'd like to read from the
[3:04] book of Ephesians, the 6th chapter. I'm
[3:06] going to be reading the 10th uh to the
[3:09] 18th verse.
[3:18] Um, I thought maybe I would stay in
[3:21] Ephesians 5 a little while longer, but
[3:23] this just just coming on my heart. So,
[3:25] we're going to go there. Um, it's just
[3:27] it just keeps coming. So, Ephesians
[3:30] chapter 6 verse 10, and I want to read
[3:33] the uh through the 18th verse here.
[3:36] Sorry, Isaac, I didn't get you those.
[3:38] Um, finally, my brethren, be strong in
[3:42] the Lord.
[3:44] and in the power of his
[3:48] might. Paul's preached a long time to
[3:51] say those words. Finally, my brethren,
[3:54] he he you know, I I've preached the
[3:57] whole book of Ephesians so I could say
[3:59] that this morning. So, could I say it
[4:00] again? Finally, my
[4:05] brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
[4:09] the power of his
[4:11] might, and put on the whole armor of
[4:13] God, that you may be able to stand
[4:16] against the ws of the devil. For we
[4:20] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[4:23] against principalities and powers, and
[4:26] against the rulers of darkness of this
[4:28] world, and against spiritual wickedness
[4:30] in high places. Wherefore take unto you
[4:34] the whole armor of God, that you might
[4:37] be able to withstand in the evil day,
[4:40] and have done all to stand. Stand. Amen.
[4:45] Therefore, having your loins girth with
[4:48] truth, and having on the breastplate of
[4:49] righteousness, and your feet that is
[4:52] shaw of the preparation of the gospel of
[4:53] peace, and above all, taking the shield
[4:56] of faith, wherewith you shall be able to
[4:58] quench all the fiery darts of the
[5:00] wicked, and to take the helmet of
[5:02] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[5:06] which is the word of
[5:07] God, praying always with all prayer and
[5:10] supplication in the spirit, and watching
[5:12] there unto the perseverance and
[5:14] supplication for all saints. Amen. God
[5:16] bless you this morning. As you could be
[5:18] seated, I I would like to take the
[5:20] context of this and of course I'm in
[5:22] this Ephesians series, but I'd like to
[5:24] talk to you on this great spiritual
[5:26] battle. Uh this uh this portion of
[5:29] scripture, of course, brother Brandon
[5:31] will use this in a couple different
[5:32] places, and he'll he'll bring like from
[5:34] the sermon, the contest. Uh there's the
[5:37] putting on the whole armor of God. And
[5:39] then there's also uh the greatest battle
[5:42] ever fought. And uh of course we'll
[5:45] probably uh continue it a little bit in
[5:47] this area because there's a lot to pick
[5:48] up and I I won't be able to do it all
[5:50] today. Uh but this uh the greatest
[5:53] battle ever fought. Uh I want to read a
[5:55] quote from here because I think it's
[5:56] powerful. In 1962
[5:58] uh this is the third month uh the 11th
[6:01] day of 1962. Brother Brandon begins the
[6:04] sermon paragraph 61. He says I believe
[6:06] that the greatest battle ever fought is
[6:09] now ready to go into action. So in 1962,
[6:13] brother Bram was announcing the
[6:15] beginning of the greatest battle that
[6:17] has ever been fought. Now I I think it's
[6:20] powerful to acknowledge, Amen. what
[6:22] happens after this statement is, Amen.
[6:25] Then just within a year comes the
[6:27] opening of the seals, which this is
[6:30] exactly where the battle comes is
[6:32] because it comes to headship, right?
[6:34] Amen. It's it's when the Holy Spirit
[6:36] begins to define his meaning of what the
[6:39] word of God is. And God begins to bring
[6:42] headship to the church. He knew that was
[6:44] going to be a battle over headship. That
[6:46] was the great battle. Amen. Of who it
[6:48] was going to be. The great battle that
[6:50] was ever fought is now ready to go into
[6:52] action. And I believe God is selecting
[6:54] his soldiers. And I believe he's been
[6:57] dressing them and training them. And the
[6:59] battlefront is now set getting ready to
[7:01] get started. Amen. I believe God's got
[7:03] an army. Don't you? Amen. I I was I knew
[7:06] brother uh Amen. I knew brother Seth and
[7:09] Steph and and uh brother Mike and them
[7:11] were up camping this last week. So last
[7:13] yesterday I was studying. I got to
[7:15] thinking about them and I asked him this
[7:16] text said, "Hey, you holy rollers on
[7:18] your way home yet?" Amen. God's got some
[7:21] God's got some uh soldiers. Amen. Now
[7:25] the world might call them holy rollers.
[7:27] Amen. They might have some kind of a
[7:30] fanatical name for them. you know, holy
[7:32] rollers, Pentecostals. Uh they they they
[7:35] say bad things about us, fanatics and
[7:37] old church Bible thumpers, and they got
[7:39] all kinds of bad names. But but but God
[7:42] calls you soldiers. Amen. You're you're
[7:45] a soldier of the cross. You're a soldier
[7:48] of what God has got to do in this age.
[7:51] And he's ready now for that for for his
[7:54] soldiers to go into action. Amen. Now,
[7:57] of course, uh anytime you come into a
[8:00] battle, it is nothing but a contest.
[8:02] Brother Bam calls it the contest. And he
[8:04] said, "We don't wrestle against flesh
[8:06] and blood, but against spiritual
[8:07] wickedness." Now, Brother Bam, in the
[8:09] message contest, he said it like this.
[8:11] And a contest is a test of strength. He
[8:14] says that is a testing of strength. like
[8:16] to uh like in the old days I'd almost
[8:18] like to I'd like to show you sometimes
[8:20] I' I'd like to act out but you know like
[8:23] in the old days brother Ram said the the
[8:24] Indians actually would have a tug of war
[8:26] and they always did it over a fire you
[8:28] know I I'll tell you I I bet if it was a
[8:31] fire you'd pull a little harder you know
[8:34] uh it's a test of strength cuz if if
[8:36] you're getting pulled to a fire you're
[8:38] going to pull with all your might. Amen.
[8:40] Amen. And you know, uh, it looks like in
[8:43] the natural it what it looks like is
[8:45] we've got brother Stephen having a tug
[8:48] of war with brother Samuel. I mean,
[8:50] that's what it looks like. It looks like
[8:51] it looks like the devil is on one end.
[8:54] Now, you're not the devil. Amen. But but
[8:56] it it it looks like the devil's on one
[8:58] end. Amen. And you got some little swimp
[9:00] on the other side. Amen.
[9:04] Um, not Samuel.
[9:07] But but but you you but you got to look
[9:10] into the invisible. Amen. You got to see
[9:13] that there's more there. Amen. Than what
[9:16] meets the eye. Amen. There's a there's a
[9:18] hidden strength in the church. Amen.
[9:21] That Jesus said a little while and the
[9:23] world see me no more. But ye shall see
[9:25] me or I will be with you even in you. So
[9:28] brother Bam said there's your hidden
[9:30] power. that hidden power that Samson was
[9:32] operating and there's a hidden power in
[9:35] the church and there's a tug of war over
[9:37] the fires of hell and brother said Satan
[9:39] is doing everything he can do to drag
[9:41] you into the fire. Amen. But if you read
[9:44] the back of the book, spoiler alert,
[9:46] Amen. It actually ends up that the
[9:48] church pulls Satan into the lake of
[9:50] fire. Amen. So there must be a strength
[9:52] in the church. It has a power, amen, to
[9:55] pull the enemy into his own fires. Amen.
[9:58] The prophet of God said, "Of course,
[10:00] Satan's going to combat the church and
[10:02] his strength." Amen. Because, see, it's
[10:04] a strength between Satan and God. So,
[10:07] it's Satan coming against God's word and
[10:10] God giving his word to his church. Now,
[10:13] this this becomes a strength, amen, of
[10:15] who's going to believe the word or who's
[10:17] going to doubt the word. That's the
[10:18] strength of the church. Now, if you're
[10:21] looking today, of course, amen, people
[10:23] talk about devils, you know, and
[10:24] spiritual warfare. Some people uh they
[10:27] they think it's kind of like that the
[10:29] devil's just a thought or he's just a
[10:31] bad thought you have or he's some kind
[10:32] of psychology or he's just a feeling,
[10:35] you know. Amen. But brother Bam says,
[10:37] "See, but you got to know your enemy if
[10:39] you're going to train for a contest. You
[10:41] going to have to meet him. So, you're
[10:43] going to have to know who your enemy
[10:44] is." And brother Bam then goes into
[10:47] boxing and how that a boxer must be
[10:49] trained. Now, here's the thing. If
[10:51] you're going to know that, you got to
[10:52] know your enemy. And the church as well
[10:55] has to know its leader. So we we have to
[10:57] know who's leading and we have to know
[10:59] who we're fighting. And and these are
[11:01] important things to get right.
[11:04] These are important things to get right.
[11:05] I think it was Billy Graham one time
[11:07] talked about he was watching a football
[11:08] game and he said he seen a guy and he
[11:10] said, "I didn't know about about
[11:11] football." He said, "But I seen a guy
[11:13] get a football." And he said he run the
[11:14] thing nearly a hundred yards. And he
[11:15] said his he he said he said it was a it
[11:19] was an amazing run. almost the whole
[11:20] football field he run the wrong way. He
[11:22] said but his own teammates were trying
[11:23] to tackle him. He said in the crowd on
[11:26] the wrong side was cheering him. He said
[11:28] come to find out he run the ball the
[11:30] wrong way. Amen. And he run a touchdown
[11:33] but he run it for the wrong team. So you
[11:35] you got to make sure you're running in
[11:37] the right direction. You you got to make
[11:39] sure which side you're fighting for and
[11:41] on. Amen. And and the only way to do
[11:44] that is to be able to discern amen what
[11:46] it is that we're fighting. So there
[11:48] there must be a leader. Now, we ask
[11:50] ourselves, who is that great end time
[11:52] leader? And I know there's been a lot of
[11:55] ministries step up to the platform, you
[11:57] know, and they they say little things to
[11:59] let you know that they possibly are the
[12:01] leader, you know, since Brother
[12:03] Brandham's gone. They're probably
[12:04] they're the one that that the people
[12:07] should be following. And and and I I'll
[12:09] say this very uh humbly. Amen. I I
[12:12] really believe that the only real true
[12:14] clarif clarified leader is the Lord
[12:18] Jesus Christ.
[12:20] Amen. And everybody else should be under
[12:23] that leadership. Amen. Amen. And that
[12:26] leadership of course when come into
[12:28] battle it is got to be clear the
[12:30] leadership. And I and I I'll say this
[12:32] when Joshua in the Bible now the book of
[12:35] Joshua it parallels the book of
[12:37] Ephesians. So you can see why we're
[12:38] drawing from Joshua. It parallels the
[12:41] book of Ephesians. And it was when
[12:42] Joshua began his great uh uh pilgrimage
[12:46] into the new land that it wasn't just a
[12:48] few minutes after he got over that they
[12:51] ran into the great battle of the walls
[12:53] of Jericho. It was almost an immediate
[12:55] thing that that was the first battle. It
[12:57] didn't start good or easy for him. It
[12:59] was one of the hardest battles right in
[13:01] front. Amen. But you you find out that
[13:03] when Joshua was examining uh uh the the
[13:06] the the battle that was in front of him
[13:09] and he went over to the walls, Brother
[13:10] Bam said he was standing up on side of
[13:12] the mountain and he was looking over the
[13:14] battle trying to determine what it was
[13:15] going to be and he see thought he was
[13:18] the leader, right? He thought that he
[13:19] was the leader of the army and the
[13:21] captain. So he was trying to make his
[13:22] mind up how we're going to do all these
[13:24] things. And then he looks up in Joshua
[13:26] 5:14 says, he said, "There stood a man."
[13:30] Amen. And and there stood a man with his
[13:32] sword drawn. And and when Joshua saw
[13:34] him, y'all know the story. I won't read
[13:36] it, but he pulls his own sword. He says
[13:38] to him, he said, "You forest, are you
[13:40] against us?" Amen. So all of a sudden,
[13:43] there was a challenge come from him
[13:45] because, you know, Amen. After all, he
[13:47] was the leader. Amen. He was the one
[13:49] that was going to be leading this
[13:50] battle. But when he gets the words back
[13:53] from this stranger, he says to him, "I
[13:56] am the captain of the host." Wait a
[13:58] minute. Amen. Then Joshua, you're really
[14:00] not the guy. There's a guy bigger than
[14:02] you.
[14:04] Amen. Now, now I think it's powerful for
[14:06] a pastor to hear this. I think it's
[14:08] powerful, Amen. for a father to hear
[14:10] this. Amen. The father of family. I
[14:12] think it's powerful that any of us
[14:14] understand that there must be the
[14:16] leadership of almighty God. And that
[14:19] leadership that came, of course, Amen.
[14:21] when he come back and said, "I'm the
[14:23] captain of the host." Amen. Am I now
[14:25] come now? this God that they've been
[14:27] dealing with this whole time, amen, has
[14:30] been with Moses and with Abraham and
[14:32] he's all he's been this way. And
[14:33] according to the scriptures, amen, he
[14:36] has been the pillar of fire. For the
[14:37] Bible says in the book of Exodus that
[14:39] the Lord God said, I would send my angel
[14:42] before thee. And brother Bram said, you
[14:44] want to know what the angel looks like?
[14:46] He said the Bible said he would be a
[14:47] pillar of fire by night and a cloud by
[14:49] day. If you got that picture, you can
[14:51] put it up there. Amen. But you see that
[14:53] that pillar of fire was recognized to be
[14:55] the leadership, amen, of them. But now
[14:57] that pillar of fire was standing in a
[15:00] human body and he was identifying
[15:02] himself and he was letting Joshua know,
[15:05] amen, that that God promised to be here
[15:07] in your battles. Did it not say, Amen,
[15:10] that I would be an enemy to your enemy?
[15:12] That I would be an adversary to your
[15:14] adversary? Somebody said, what's God
[15:15] doing here? Well, if there's a battle,
[15:18] the Bible said the angel of the Lord
[15:20] would lead the church. Amen. And that
[15:22] leadership would be, amen, an adversary
[15:25] to your adversary. Amen. Now, now y'all
[15:27] look at that picture real close because
[15:29] there's one of them guys ain't here this
[15:31] morning. Amen. Our our prophet, Brother
[15:33] Brandham. Amen. Which we love and
[15:35] respect and quote every church service.
[15:37] Amen. But but God saw fit to take
[15:40] brother Brandham from us. But he didn't
[15:43] take away that pillar of fire that is
[15:45] still leading the church today. Come on.
[15:48] Because there's a spiritual battle.
[15:51] Amen. And if there's a spiritual battle,
[15:53] there has to be a leader. And that
[15:55] leader among us is a pillar of fire
[15:57] because he said he would lead us to the
[15:59] millennium. He didn't come just to walk
[16:02] away and leave this bride. But as long
[16:04] as the bride stays with the word, there
[16:06] is an archangel with a word. Michael
[16:09] will never leave this message. Come on,
[16:12] church. Brother Bam didn't just read
[16:14] Ephesians 6 for the greatest battle ever
[16:16] fought. He also read Daniel the 12th
[16:19] chapter. It would be a time when Michael
[16:21] would stand up for his people. Isn't it
[16:23] amazing that he would take a book and
[16:25] also in Revelations the 10th chapter
[16:28] that the mighty angel would descend out
[16:30] of heaven and there would be a book
[16:32] opened in his hand. What's it all about?
[16:34] He's here for the battle. He's here to
[16:36] lead the bride. She don't have to stand
[16:39] here this morning and wonder what she's
[16:41] supposed to do and what is the battle
[16:43] orders and how is it going to be. There
[16:45] is a clear leader among us today. And
[16:49] we're not looking for a man to take
[16:50] brother Bam's place.
[16:53] Is that Is that okay with y'all? Amen.
[16:56] So So by doing this, then we're seeing
[16:59] that the angel that went before him was
[17:02] a pillar of fire. But now the pillar of
[17:05] fire had took this body and was talking
[17:07] to him. Yeah.
[17:09] In the great warrior Joshua, brother Ram
[17:11] would say like this, that leader was
[17:13] none other than Christ himself.
[17:17] Amen. He says it was a pillar of fire
[17:19] had become a man. And I hope you know
[17:21] what I'm talking about.
[17:24] Y'all ain't never read anything like
[17:25] that in a message. Have you? Where
[17:28] brother Bam said that light came in the
[17:29] room and the next thing I know I'm
[17:30] looking at a man. Just leaving that
[17:33] there for you.
[17:35] that pillar of fire that had led them,
[17:37] the invisible one, the omnipotent one.
[17:40] They had a they had a trap set up for
[17:41] brother Brandham in Chicago.
[17:44] And he said, "You've seen him in divine
[17:46] healing. Now you come watch him in
[17:47] battle." Brother Bam didn't take his gun
[17:50] to that meeting. Brother Bam didn't take
[17:53] any IBMs or he didn't take no machetes
[17:56] or no no personal bodyguards.
[17:59] He took his Bible
[18:01] and he stood in front of 300 preachers
[18:03] and said to them, "You are the great the
[18:05] great ministry of Chicago. If I have
[18:07] taught serpent seed wrong, bring your
[18:09] Bible and stand beside me and prove it."
[18:12] And that was the quietest crowd. That's
[18:14] the quietest preachers ever been.
[18:17] He said, "If I've taught the Godhead
[18:19] wrong, bring your Bible and stand beside
[18:22] me." They wasn't scared of Brother
[18:25] Brandom.
[18:26] They weren't scared of Brother Brandom.
[18:28] They were scared of that other angel. It
[18:31] wasn't the seventh angel they feared. It
[18:33] was that mighty angel they feared. They
[18:36] feared him because, Amen, he could open
[18:38] the doors and channels of life. Now,
[18:40] they were smart to fear him. But but but
[18:43] but they set quiet. Now, the Bible said
[18:45] when the lion roar, Amen, the whole
[18:47] jungle gets quiet. If you ever wondered
[18:49] some about that silence, let me tell you
[18:51] this. You silence denomination and you
[18:54] silence the voice of the enemy, but you
[18:55] do it by vindicated word. Amen. It'll
[18:58] silence it every time. Now, the prophet
[19:00] of God said, "See, that was the Jericho
[19:02] wall." Now, I love to think about this
[19:04] that a battleground become a holy ground
[19:07] because he recognized that Christ was
[19:09] there in the battle. Listen. Amen. It's
[19:11] okay to be in a battle as long as you
[19:12] know there's a leader in the battle. And
[19:14] if that's the same leader that was at
[19:16] the walls of Jericho is here this
[19:18] morning, I tell you this, the only thing
[19:20] you got to do is start walking. Amen.
[19:22] Don't let the devil tell you that what
[19:25] you have is not enough to defeat him. He
[19:28] wants to stop you. But I say in the name
[19:30] of the Lord, get to walking. Get to
[19:32] walking down your doubts and your fears.
[19:34] Amen. And it don't matter if you see the
[19:37] walls tumbling or not. The Bible said
[19:39] that on the seventh day that all of the
[19:42] messengers sounded at one time. And when
[19:44] they begin to sound, the Bible said as
[19:46] one voice they sounded and begin to
[19:49] shout and the walls come tumbling down.
[19:52] And I say this morning as one voice, as
[19:54] one church of the living God. Amen. That
[19:57] sometimes you just need to start
[19:59] shouting before your walls down.
[20:01] Sometimes, listen, if the great if the
[20:04] great one that led Joshua said, Joshua,
[20:07] the walls will still be standing after
[20:10] seven days of walking, but they'll never
[20:12] stand when the voice of you begin to
[20:14] shout together. And as one voice this
[20:17] morning, I believe the final voice. I
[20:19] believe the bride voice is the final
[20:21] voice. And when she begins to sound
[20:23] together, I'll tell you, it'll cause a
[20:25] unity. It'll cause a vibration and it'll
[20:29] shake the foundations of hell.
[20:31] Hallelujah. I believe it. I believe if
[20:33] Paul and Silas could shake down the
[20:35] walls of their prison, I believe you can
[20:38] shake down the walls of sickness this
[20:40] morning and your trouble this morning.
[20:42] But sometimes you just need to praise
[20:45] God when you don't feel like it. when
[20:47] the troubles are around you and the and
[20:50] the problems are sitting there. Amen. I
[20:52] think it's time to praise God and let
[20:54] the devils fall to the left. Let them
[20:57] fall to the right. Somebody said, "Well,
[20:59] Brother Wayne, I I don't I don't hardly
[21:01] feel even worthy to praise God." I've
[21:03] just listened to the prophet this
[21:04] morning and he was talking about the
[21:06] great battle. He said there was a woman
[21:08] sitting in one of his meetings come to
[21:09] him said, "Brother Brandham said, you
[21:11] were preaching this morning and he said,
[21:12] "Oh, I got to feeling so good." She
[21:14] said, "While you were preaching, I
[21:15] thought I could have jumped up and just
[21:17] shouted." Brother Bham said, "Well,
[21:19] sister, you should have just jumped up
[21:20] and shouted." And she said, "But,
[21:22] Brother Bam," she said, "About the time
[21:24] you were preaching and everybody else
[21:26] was shouting." She said, "I felt like
[21:28] it, but then the it was there was a
[21:30] little feeling come over me and I felt
[21:32] like a nothing." She said, "I felt like
[21:34] a nothing." She said, "I felt not worthy
[21:36] to do it." And a little trouble's been
[21:38] in my life. And she said, "I just felt
[21:40] so unworthy to do it." He said, "Sister,
[21:42] that ain't nothing but the devil talking
[21:44] to you." He said, "Listen." He said,
[21:46] "You're a spiritual Amen. a spiritual uh
[21:50] a spiritual priest." He said, "And then
[21:52] that was when you were supposed to have
[21:54] sacrificed your praise was when you
[21:56] didn't feel like it." So when the devil
[21:58] comes along, makes you feel like a
[22:00] little nothing, I tell you what you do.
[22:01] You just shout aloud right then. When he
[22:04] comes along says, "You ain't got no
[22:05] right to praise." I think I'd stand on
[22:07] my feet and I would praise God and I'd
[22:10] tell that devil, you don't tell me when
[22:12] I can praise and you don't tell me when
[22:15] I can't praise. You don't tell me when I
[22:17] can shout and you don't tell me when I
[22:20] can't shout. I have a leader
[22:23] and Amen. It's the power of God and it's
[22:27] a reality this morning.
[22:30] Satan, I rebuke you trying to take
[22:33] control over the worship of Almighty
[22:36] God. Hallelujah. We got a right to
[22:38] worship God. We got a right to praise
[22:41] God. We are the children of God bought
[22:45] with a price. Purchased of the
[22:49] blood.
[22:53] Hallelujah. When Satan tells you to not,
[22:55] that's when I'm going to. Yeah. He says,
[22:58] "You need to feel this way. I'm going to
[23:00] feel different." A prophet told you
[23:02] that. He told you to go opposite of your
[23:05] feelings.
[23:06] [Applause]
[23:07] Opposite of how you feel.
[23:10] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, sometimes
[23:13] we just need to obey the leadership. If
[23:16] you feel a certain way, well, if I would
[23:18] shout now, it's going then that'd be a
[23:20] good time to shout, right? in
[23:23] and you just tell the devil, you will
[23:25] not control my worship.
[23:27] [Applause]
[23:30] You just won't going to do it.
[23:32] I don't know about y'all, but I can't
[23:34] stand it. I can't stand that feeling of
[23:37] of of just oppression and like a wet
[23:40] blanket, and I just can't take it.
[23:42] Sometimes I just want to shout so loud
[23:44] and set that thing on fire till I burn
[23:46] every ember of it away from my mind. And
[23:49] I have a freedom to stand there and say,
[23:51] "God is my God and he has power and he
[23:54] has reality."
[23:56] And devil, if you want to stick around,
[23:58] get you a seat and listen while we
[23:59] praise.
[24:04] See, headship is here. We have the
[24:06] answer to the devil's question.
[24:08] Headship is here.
[24:11] Now, Brother Brandham says, "And from
[24:12] that time, his ministry was to declare
[24:15] his presence." That's right. And brother
[24:17] Bram said, "He's here."
[24:19] Now, Brother Brandham again says it like
[24:21] this. He is the word, the headship, and
[24:24] he properly identified or vindicated by
[24:27] his own spirit being in the church. My
[24:30] goodness. Y'all forgive me. The residue
[24:32] of that worship still on me. I want to
[24:34] shout. Hallelujah.
[24:36] Glory be to God.
[24:39] See, that's why the Bible said, "Be
[24:41] strong in the Lord."
[24:44] And in the power of his might, not
[24:46] yours.
[24:48] Look, you got to trade your power for
[24:50] his power. You got to trade your
[24:53] strength for his strength. Brother Man
[24:56] preaches a whole message on it. He said,
[24:57] "Amen. This kingdom was made out of the
[24:59] weak." He said, "The whole kingdom of
[25:02] God was made from weak people." Brother
[25:04] man said, "But by the time he gets them
[25:06] weak enough to use him, they use it as
[25:08] an excuse to not be used." Took him 40
[25:11] years to get Moses weak enough to use
[25:13] him. Moses then said, "Lord, I'm not
[25:15] going to be useful to you." So brother
[25:17] Bam said, "Don't use your weakness as an
[25:19] excuse because God took this long to get
[25:22] you that weak so that he could use you."
[25:25] So you're not too weak, you're too
[25:27] strong.
[25:29] You're too strong just to believe God.
[25:31] Listen, your strength as a believer is
[25:34] not in your ability. Your strength in as
[25:37] a believer is your adherence to the word
[25:40] of God of this age. Let me say this.
[25:43] Amen. I might not be the strongest man
[25:45] in the world. I might have weaknesses
[25:47] and conflicts and Amen. like everybody
[25:49] else. There's little complexes and fears
[25:51] and and and and it's it's all the time.
[25:53] My my battle ain't somebody else. It's
[25:55] me.
[25:57] I am my greatest enemy.
[26:00] you actually are your greatest enemy.
[26:03] But if you become strong in the Lord and
[26:05] the power of his might. Amen. Now, this
[26:08] we can do is believe the word because
[26:11] you was anointed to believe this. You're
[26:13] ordained to believe this. The same as an
[26:16] eagle is anointed to fly in the heavens.
[26:18] You've been anointed to believe this
[26:20] message. You don't know why, but God
[26:22] made you believe it. He designed you to
[26:25] believe it. And in despair, you believe
[26:27] it. And in trouble, you believe it. And
[26:29] in trials, you believe it because you're
[26:32] made to believe it. You're ordained and
[26:34] designed of Almighty God. You are a true
[26:37] believer.
[26:40] Yes. And your spiritual health is your
[26:42] adherence to the pure word of God. Now,
[26:45] let me say your enemy, Satan, and his
[26:47] tactic is to get you to disbelieve God's
[26:49] word.
[26:51] See, when you disbelieve one word of
[26:54] God's written Bible, you're disarmed.
[26:58] Satan ain't got to go around your house
[27:00] and do nothing else. But just get you to
[27:03] disbelieve this word. Now, let me say
[27:05] this. It don't take a whole paragraph to
[27:07] disbelieve.
[27:09] Eve disbelieved one promise. One word.
[27:12] Confused in one place. You say, "Where
[27:14] was she confused?" I'll tell you where
[27:16] she was confused. God keeps his word.
[27:19] That's right. She was confused upon that
[27:22] one thing and she was disarmed because
[27:24] of it. See, his attack, see, was to
[27:28] disbelieve the word. That's it. And
[27:31] that's Satan's weapon against you. Is to
[27:34] disbelieve the word. See, it's tried to
[27:37] get you to disbelieve. When you
[27:39] disbelieve the word, you're disarmed.
[27:42] You have no protection at all. You
[27:45] dropped your weapon.
[27:47] Amen. I got a story, but I'll leave that
[27:49] one.
[27:50] Amen. If you if if the devil can talk
[27:53] you out of what you're holding is
[27:54] powerful, then he disarmed you.
[27:58] Can you imagine Goliath? That was his
[28:00] tactic, right? You can't hurt me, you
[28:03] little fellow, with that slingshot.
[28:07] But David knew better.
[28:10] His strength was in the Lord.
[28:13] I don't come to you with stabs and
[28:15] swords.
[28:16] I come to you in the name of the Lord.
[28:20] The word interpreted in the age. I come
[28:22] to you with the word of God. So
[28:24] therefore, he knew where his strength
[28:26] was. Now, of course, the the the the the
[28:29] message of this hour is the restoring of
[28:33] the full word of God.
[28:35] Now, could I say this very clearly?
[28:37] Brother Brandham says it like this. When
[28:38] you restore the word, you restore power.
[28:42] When you restore the word, you restore
[28:44] power. We have moved from justification,
[28:47] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[28:48] spirit. We have moved into the full word
[28:52] of God where the entire word is being
[28:55] brought forth in its fullness and in its
[28:59] strength.
[29:00] So, well, they were really strong back
[29:02] in the days of Pentecost. Brother Ram
[29:04] said Pentecost gave its strength into
[29:06] the bride.
[29:07] So, the good things of Pentecost are in
[29:10] the bride.
[29:13] That's right. the good things. Now, the
[29:15] shot part of Pentecost is behind us and
[29:17] it's dried up and it's dead. And life
[29:20] don't go backwards. Life goes upwards
[29:24] because God is leading life and he's led
[29:27] it into the gene seed. And that seed
[29:29] holds all the good things that Pentecost
[29:33] held, which was life. Amen. And that
[29:36] life according to David. David the the
[29:38] one that struck Goliath down is the one
[29:40] that said the Lord is my strength and he
[29:43] is my shield. I love that. Don't you?
[29:46] The Lord is my strength and he is my
[29:49] shield. In Psalms 271, the Lord is the
[29:52] light of my salvation and whom shall I
[29:54] fear? There must have been something to
[29:56] fear or he wouldn't have said that.
[29:59] Amen. You know, nobody ever just stood
[30:01] up in the room and said, "I'm not afraid
[30:04] of
[30:05] what?" He You see what I'm saying? There
[30:08] was something pressing him. There was
[30:11] some fear on him or he wouldn't say I'm
[30:14] not fear. So therefore, there was a
[30:17] great opposition. And he goes on later
[30:19] to say that my foe has encamped about me
[30:22] and they have fell upon me to to novel
[30:24] me. Amen. They were scoffers everywhere.
[30:27] And David stood in the middle of said,
[30:28] "The Lord is my strength and my life. Of
[30:30] whom shall I fear? He is my light." So
[30:33] there was darkness. He's my light. So I
[30:35] believe the church of the living God can
[30:37] look into the face of this leodysian
[30:39] age, this dark age, and we can say, "He
[30:41] is the light of my salvation."
[30:44] Say, "Well, it's dark everywhere. Not
[30:46] for the bride." Because in this city,
[30:48] the lamb is the light
[30:50] thereof. You see, I said, "Well, brother
[30:52] Wayne, I tell you what, trouble is
[30:54] everywhere. We are to fear." Listen, I
[30:56] do not fear because the Lord is my
[30:59] strength. Now, blessed is that man that
[31:02] believes in the Lord. And I think it's
[31:04] David says it here. He said, "From
[31:06] strength to strength they go." Amen.
[31:08] They go from increasing victory to
[31:10] increasing victory because that there is
[31:13] a strength in them. I'll say this to you
[31:15] this morning. Now, there is a real
[31:17] devil. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. There is a
[31:21] real devil.
[31:23] And let me tell you, amen. That word
[31:25] devil in the Greek means accuser or
[31:28] slanderer.
[31:30] Well, that guy lives up to his name,
[31:32] don't he?
[31:34] He's an accuser or a
[31:37] slanderer. Amen. You find that in the
[31:39] Hebrew the word Satan means an
[31:41] adversary.
[31:43] So, he is a devil. He's a accuser. He's
[31:47] a slanderer. As Satan, he is an
[31:50] adversary of the church. Of course, this
[31:55] means there is one devil and there are
[31:58] many demons.
[32:00] Now, I've always used this for the
[32:02] Godhead because you got to get it right.
[32:04] Right. And people people can get so
[32:06] mixed up on the godhead. So, I just say
[32:07] it real clearly. Does it take many
[32:10] devils to beat up or many many gods to
[32:13] beat up one devil?
[32:15] Why is it that the the religious world
[32:18] is not trying to divide the devil in
[32:20] three persons?
[32:23] Why are they okay with the devil being
[32:25] one powerful person, but they want God
[32:28] divided in three people?
[32:31] Isn't that odd? Cuz they're trying to
[32:33] say it takes three gods to beat up one
[32:36] devil.
[32:38] But let me assure you that God is not
[32:40] three. For hear ye, oh Israel, the Lord,
[32:43] thy God is one God.
[32:46] Amen. There is one God. Amen. And that
[32:49] is God. Of course, Satan is his
[32:52] adversary. And Satan means to lie and
[32:55] wait. He's an adversary. Uh, of course.
[32:59] Amen. He's a diablo. He is an adversary
[33:03] accuser. He's a devil. And brother Bam
[33:06] says it like this. People think it's
[33:07] just a thought. He said, but see, he
[33:10] says it's not just a bad thought. He
[33:13] said, and the Holy Spirit is not just a
[33:15] good thought.
[33:17] They're persons. Yes, sir. He said the
[33:19] Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit said
[33:21] when he the Holy Spirit has come, he is
[33:23] a personal pronoun. So he is a person
[33:26] and the devil is a person and demon are
[33:30] persons. Yes, they are demons. They come
[33:32] in many ways. There's one devil, many
[33:34] demons. Who are those demons? I'll tell
[33:37] you who they are. They're them ones that
[33:39] fell out of heaven.
[33:41] Amen. Now, we could correct that a
[33:44] little bit and they fell, but really
[33:47] Michael cast them out.
[33:50] They didn't leave on their own.
[33:52] God put them packing
[33:55] because they were following the devil.
[33:58] Isn't that powerful? Amen. So, what
[34:00] happens is God pushed them out of the
[34:02] heavens and those fallen angels have
[34:05] become demons under the devil.
[34:08] He still does his work today. See what
[34:11] it is? It's power. See, God and Satan is
[34:14] power. If you don't believe in the
[34:15] devil, Brother Bam said, he says you're
[34:17] going to run a headlong into him every
[34:19] day. Don't tell me there's no devil. I
[34:22] know better. I fight with him every day.
[34:26] There is a devil, and you must be
[34:28] trained to meet him. Not trained in
[34:30] psychology,
[34:32] not trained in education, but trained by
[34:36] the Holy Spirit. God's power in his word
[34:40] to make it manifested. Now, now I I I
[34:42] know that I've gotten a name that
[34:44] brother Wayne, boy, he hates psychology.
[34:46] Now, I don't I don't hate psychology.
[34:48] Maybe sometimes Christian counsel and I
[34:50] I think I get in trouble every time I
[34:51] get around this point, but but let me
[34:53] just say this. Amen. What I'm talking
[34:56] about is is the devil is in psychology.
[35:02] So that's like giving the bank robber
[35:06] the security to the bank.
[35:08] He can really really do a good job
[35:11] securing that bank
[35:14] until he wants some money.
[35:16] And Satan through psychology can really
[35:19] secure a family
[35:21] till he wants in.
[35:24] Because see, it's it's it's brother
[35:27] Brandham is saying to us that we don't
[35:29] need psychology training. We need a Holy
[35:32] Ghost training which would take the word
[35:35] of God and make it manifest in our life.
[35:38] Now y'all know, Amen. The word demon,
[35:40] Brother Bam said, is a devil and it
[35:42] comes from an English word, a tormentor.
[35:45] So the devil is a tormentor. Anybody
[35:47] know him like that?
[35:49] Somebody said, "Well, there ain't no
[35:50] such thing as torment." I said, "Well,
[35:52] you've never spent a night alone with a
[35:53] mosquito in the
[35:55] south."
[35:57] Woo, brother Carrie. You know what I
[36:00] mean? Hey, man. Them skeers down there
[36:02] in Arkansas, they breed with the
[36:07] turkeys and you feel like your
[36:09] Thanksgiving dinner sometime. They swap
[36:10] it around on you
[36:13] know and and and and you know, we didn't
[36:16] have air conditioners, guys, when I was
[36:18] a kid growing up. We I mean we had an
[36:20] attic fan and and sometimes you took the
[36:24] screens off, you know, to wash the
[36:26] windows and you had to be real careful
[36:27] to get them babies back in place, not
[36:29] get a hole in them cuz if there's a
[36:31] little crack on the edge or you knew it.
[36:33] You knew if you didn't do it right cuz
[36:35] that night you could hear them buzzing
[36:37] them mosquitoes and and you knew there
[36:39] was a hole somewhere. Somebody didn't do
[36:41] something right somewhere. Somebody left
[36:43] the door open somewhere because them
[36:45] little tormentors were in the in the
[36:47] room. And you know, as a believer now,
[36:50] you you you want to you want to make
[36:52] sure the screens is up and the door
[36:54] stays closed. And because if you start
[36:57] hearing the buzz of those mosquitoes,
[36:59] you know something's just not right
[37:01] somewhere. So what do you want to do?
[37:03] You want to fortify yourself and tell
[37:05] that devil, get on out of here. So So I
[37:07] don't want to call the gospel a mosquito
[37:10] spray like a par for raid. But sometimes
[37:13] it would be a good example, amen, that
[37:15] you just take a can of raid and fog the
[37:17] room. Amen. And just tell that devil,
[37:19] I've heard enough of your buzzing. I've
[37:22] I I've had all of it I'm going to take.
[37:25] And I don't know about you, but I'm just
[37:27] tired of the whispers of Satan as tries
[37:30] to destroy the church of the living God.
[37:32] I believe this morning there is a
[37:34] tormentor, but I'm here to torment that
[37:36] devil. He knew last night what it was
[37:38] going to be. Amen. I I I tell you, I
[37:40] start opening up some of this and Amen.
[37:42] the devil starts every which way. Amen.
[37:45] Amen. You know what I know though? I
[37:47] know that Amen. He might torment me.
[37:50] Amen. But I'm going to torment him right
[37:51] back. I'm going to read the right act to
[37:54] him out of the Bible and tell him he's a
[37:56] whipped devil. That Jesus whipped him at
[37:59] Calvary. The blood was shed for him. I'm
[38:02] a free man this morning. I don't owe any
[38:04] debts of sin or disgust, but I am here
[38:08] this morning free to fight.
[38:11] Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. There is
[38:14] demons and there's a channel right here.
[38:16] You know, the brother Bam explains it.
[38:18] There's a channel right here. And he
[38:19] said there's a channel above us and
[38:21] there's a channel below us. And he said
[38:23] there's an enemy who's trying to
[38:25] influence you downward. He said then
[38:28] God's angels are trying to influence you
[38:30] upward. That's just a way of saying it.
[38:32] But you're walking in a channel that
[38:34] both of those influences have power in.
[38:37] You are not just human beings. You are
[38:39] spiritual people and you have a spirit
[38:42] and there's an enemy working in that
[38:44] spirit. And if you don't get out of the
[38:46] 10 gates of the senses and you don't
[38:48] walk away from conscious and feeling and
[38:50] you don't get out of your emotions, the
[38:52] devil's going to play with you every
[38:54] day. He's going to have you racked up in
[38:56] your mind. Amen. But if you'll ever get
[38:59] to the place where you just step over in
[39:01] the word of God and say, "Satan, I know
[39:03] where I'm standing. I know what I
[39:06] believe." You could just get right on
[39:08] out of here. You know what happens?
[39:09] Satan loses his power in that place. So
[39:12] that's why the message of the hour come
[39:14] to call you out of your denomination.
[39:17] Called you out of tradition. Come on
[39:19] now. Amen. Where we going? To the word
[39:22] where we can stand for this great end
[39:24] time battle. Hallelujah. Every once in a
[39:28] while, you'll see there's influences
[39:30] that come upon people. Both Satan and
[39:34] his angels and God is working among the
[39:37] people. In Revelations 9, you've read
[39:39] it. There's a king over them 200,000,000
[39:42] demons. It's the devil.
[39:45] In Isaiah 14, the Bible records that
[39:50] Satan was cast out of heaven. Why art
[39:52] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son
[39:53] of the morning? Thou has been cast down
[39:56] into the earth. Isn't that powerful?
[39:59] Amen. Jesus in Luke 10 said he saw it. I
[40:03] beheld Satan fallen from heaven like
[40:06] lightning. Now it's amazing is because
[40:09] brother Bram said Isaiah saw what was in
[40:11] the devil's
[40:12] heart. But Paul saw him come into
[40:14] position.
[40:16] But Jesus tells us why the devil fell
[40:19] from heaven. It was when he gave power
[40:22] to the church.
[40:24] Remember Jesus says it and I beheld them
[40:27] falling from heaven and the power was
[40:29] given to the church. See, see, brother
[40:31] Bram says it like this. He said when the
[40:33] Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost,
[40:34] he said, Satan never even got out of
[40:36] bed. Right? He said, Satan never even
[40:39] got out of bed. He said, but when Peter
[40:42] went walking down by the gate,
[40:43] beautiful. And he looked over at a lame
[40:46] man and he said, Silver and gold have I
[40:48] none, but that what I have, I give unto
[40:50] thee in the name of Jesus. Rise up and
[40:52] walk. When he said that and the man got
[40:55] off of there and began to walk, brother
[40:56] Bon said, they said, "The devil got all
[40:58] the demons out of bed." And they said,
[41:00] "You better stop this thing now." Why?
[41:03] Because they seen that power was given
[41:06] back to the church through the baptism
[41:08] of the Holy Ghost. Listen, let me say
[41:10] this morning, you're more powerful than
[41:11] you know you are. You're more powerful
[41:14] than you realize you are. And Satan and
[41:16] all of his buzzing always telling you,
[41:18] you're a nobody. You have no power. You
[41:20] have no ability. You're never able. He's
[41:22] trying to keep you quiet because he
[41:24] knows you have something in you that
[41:26] disturbs his whole kingdom.
[41:30] Oh, Satan would love nothing more than
[41:31] to quieten you, to quieten your
[41:33] testimony, to quieten your life. Amen.
[41:36] But God is influencing you otherwise.
[41:40] Amen. I know I know Satan's trying to
[41:43] control your worship, but angels are
[41:45] here to charge you.
[41:48] They're here to charge you and influence
[41:50] you into worshiping God.
[41:53] So, well, Brother Wayne, it's just
[41:54] sickness. Brother Bam said deaf and dumb
[41:56] spirits were cast out and the devil had
[41:58] a deaf and dumb. Brother Bram said
[42:00] that's what it was was a spirit.
[42:03] Do you see spirits whole? Brother Bam
[42:06] said if it was an arm broke, you could
[42:07] fix it. He said, but sometimes he said
[42:10] there's there's like a transparent band.
[42:12] You know what it is? A transparent band
[42:14] that's on a nerve. And he said, "It's
[42:16] just like having a transparent band
[42:18] around your hand." He said, "You see
[42:19] your hand going blue." He said, "You
[42:21] wonder what's there's nothing wrong with
[42:22] your hand. There's nothing wrong with
[42:24] your veins. It's a band that's cutting
[42:25] off the circulation." And brother Bam
[42:27] said, "That's the way a devil will do."
[42:29] He'll get on a nerve and cut it off and
[42:32] then you can't hear or you can't talk or
[42:34] there's something happening you. He
[42:36] said, "And the doctors can't find any
[42:37] reason why." He said, "It's a
[42:39] transparent band. It's a devil." Now,
[42:42] now you said, "Preacher, Amen. You got
[42:44] to know where all sickness comes from.
[42:45] Brother Ram tailed it back to the Garden
[42:47] of Eden and said it was the devil. God
[42:49] didn't make you sick, friend. God didn't
[42:52] cause these problems. God didn't do
[42:53] these things. He might have allowed it
[42:56] to happen, but he gave his blood and his
[42:59] sacrifice that you could tell that
[43:01] devil, amen, by his stripes, I am
[43:04] healed. By his blood, I am saved. I have
[43:07] got a right this morning to joy and to
[43:10] peace and to happiness because God gave
[43:12] it to me by the blood. Now Jesus was the
[43:16] one that said this and brother Brandham
[43:18] said, "Of course, you got to know your
[43:19] battle. You got to know your enemy." And
[43:21] he said, "Your enemy is in a battle.
[43:23] Know your enemy and you got to know your
[43:25] armor."
[43:27] Your armor is the word and your enemy is
[43:30] anything that reasons against it.
[43:33] Amen. The voice of your enemy is
[43:36] anything contrary to the word.
[43:40] Satan has been successful in his
[43:43] marvelous success in carrying out his
[43:45] threats by people letting him explain
[43:48] away in every age the value of God's
[43:50] promised word for that age. You remember
[43:53] Thursday night I was showing you the
[43:55] power of changing was to look into the
[43:57] message unveiled.
[43:59] It was a power and Satan is trying to
[44:02] explain away the value of setting and
[44:04] reading those quotes of preaching the
[44:06] message. And it's like years ago, I
[44:08] remember as a guy come up to me and he
[44:10] says to me, he says to me, he said,
[44:11] "Brother Wayne," he said, "the power is
[44:13] in reading the scripture. There's no
[44:15] power in reading those quotes." And I
[44:16] thought, "Fella, you don't know what
[44:17] you're talking about." I've stood there
[44:19] in Africa with 5,000 people and read a
[44:23] quote and blow the tent doors off. Amen.
[44:26] The power of the end time message. I've
[44:27] seen spirits run and hide. I stood there
[44:30] in India and saw the power of God drop
[44:32] in a room and 30 I think at least 30
[44:34] apostolic men come to the message in one
[44:37] meeting because of a quote I read.
[44:41] So what he's trying to devalue the
[44:43] reading of the quotes and the preaching
[44:45] of the message and he's trying to
[44:46] devalue that. Well, I know why he's
[44:49] trying to devalue. He's trying to disarm
[44:51] you. Look, when the enemy comes in like
[44:54] a flood, God raises a standard. And the
[44:56] standard of the age is the eagle
[44:58] anointing which is revelation. If you're
[45:01] doubting the message, get a revelation.
[45:04] This revelation is that Jesus Christ is
[45:07] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[45:10] Jesus can still speak. Jesus can still
[45:13] talk. Jesus can still walk. Jesus still
[45:16] shows up in the meetings. This message
[45:18] proves this is not a dead ladder. It's
[45:22] the mechanics and the dynamics. It's the
[45:24] spirit of Jesus Christ. This message is
[45:30] powerful. It'll move you. It'll clean
[45:33] you. It'll fill you. It'll energize you.
[45:36] It'll strengthen you.
[45:38] But Satan says all those are just
[45:41] quotes.
[45:42] Come on. Amen. Praise.
[45:45] Yeah. Amen. I adise him. That's what I
[45:48] tell you, too.
[45:53] Brother Brandham said, "It's Satan's
[45:55] army to bring destruction and to get you
[45:58] to disbelieve God's word that he might
[46:01] be able to set up a better kingdom than
[46:02] Michael's."
[46:04] And God cast him out.
[46:07] God's
[46:08] method is to cast out evil.
[46:13] God's method of dealing with it is to
[46:15] cast out evil. You say, "Cast out evil?"
[46:17] That's why Paul said, "The weapons of my
[46:19] warfare, they are not carnal, but they
[46:22] are mighty to the pulling down of
[46:25] strongholds." And man, here, brother,
[46:27] picks it up and says, "That's right.
[46:29] Cast it out. Cast down
[46:32] reasoning. Cast down superstition." When
[46:35] you're reasoning with the word, call it
[46:37] what it is. It's a demon.
[46:40] It's a devil. You got to know who's
[46:41] talking to you. That's not your mind.
[46:44] That's not your thought. Don't own it.
[46:46] Don't feel guilty for it. I I don't
[46:50] Sometimes I I have a hard time
[46:52] expressing exactly what I mean. But can
[46:54] can I just say sometimes, let me just
[46:55] say it like this. You got to know who's
[46:57] thinking through your mind.
[47:00] And sometimes it's not you. And if it's
[47:03] not you, don't feel guilty for it. Cast
[47:05] the thing away.
[47:09] Y'all know the quote, the prophet said a
[47:11] guy come up to him and
[47:14] apolog. And he said, "No, you wasn't."
[47:17] He said, "It was the man sitting behind
[47:19] you." The guy said, "Well, I knew I
[47:22] loved you. You know, I knew I loved you,
[47:24] Brother Ram. I couldn't figure out why I
[47:25] was thinking this." Cuz it wasn't your
[47:27] thought. It wasn't you doing the
[47:29] thinking. It was somebody behind you and
[47:31] it was passing through your mind. So,
[47:33] when a thought comes in your mind that
[47:35] don't seem right, it ain't right, cast
[47:37] it down and say, "Oh, dirty devil,
[47:40] you'll not put that thing in my mind."
[47:43] Now, I'm talking about real warfare. I'm
[47:45] talking about people who's going to live
[47:47] victorious in this end time. Satan can
[47:49] send 200 million devils, but there'll be
[47:53] a bride who will be in authority. She'll
[47:56] stand with that word anyhow. Cast down
[47:59] your superstition. Cast down your weary.
[48:01] Cast down your diseases. Cast down your
[48:03] sin. Let me say this. Get it out of your
[48:05] head and get it under your feet. It is
[48:09] not here to rule you. If there's a devil
[48:12] here this morning, he showed up to
[48:16] die. Me and Timothy Puit was building
[48:18] their church down there at the Eden
[48:20] Light. Amen. We come up there one
[48:21] morning. There's a big old rattlesnake
[48:22] laying out on the concrete porch. He
[48:24] said, "Look at that thing, Brother
[48:25] Wayne." I said, "Yes, sir." One of us
[48:27] got a shovel. I don't remember which one
[48:28] it was. We took that shovel and chopped
[48:30] the head right off of that thing. I
[48:32] said, "Timothy, that devil come here
[48:33] this morning to die." And let me tell
[48:35] you this. If that devil showed up here
[48:37] this morning, he's only coming this
[48:39] church to die. Amen. Because there is a
[48:41] group of people here that will cast down
[48:44] worry. Cast down imagination. And
[48:46] understand it is the bite of the
[48:48] serpent.
[48:52] There is a real devil. He's not a
[48:54] thought. He's a person. And so is the
[48:57] Holy Ghost.
[49:00] Now, let me say this. Overcoming means
[49:03] to recognize the devil in every one of
[49:05] his tricks. Lots of people say, "Well,
[49:06] there's no devil." It's just a thought.
[49:09] Don't you believe that there's a real
[49:11] devil. He's as real as you or anybody
[49:13] else. He's a real devil. And you got to
[49:15] recognize him real and you must know
[49:18] he's a devil. But at the same time,
[49:22] you've got to recognize and know he's a
[49:24] devil and he's against you. But to
[49:25] overcome him, you must recognize that
[49:28] there is a God and in you is greater and
[49:32] mightier than he is. And he has already
[49:35] overcome that devil. You know Jesus has
[49:38] already overcome that devil.
[49:41] Amen.
[49:42] Now, Amen. I grew up with big brothers.
[49:45] I know what it means to have a tough big
[49:48] brother. I never will forget a a a bully
[49:50] down in our gym when I was a kid. Now,
[49:52] when Sammy, you're a big old kid
[49:54] compared to what I
[49:56] was when I was in seventh grade. I was 4
[50:00] foot 10 and I might have weighed
[50:02] 110bs.
[50:04] Maybe. Maybe. And they let the junior
[50:07] high in with the senior high and the
[50:08] gymnasium because it was a poor school.
[50:10] We only had one gym. So all the kids
[50:13] were in the same gym. The seniors with
[50:15] the freshman and also with the seventh
[50:17] graders who I was right. So there was an
[50:21] old boy that loved to hit young people
[50:23] in the head with ba basketballs. He
[50:25] thought it was the funniest thing ever.
[50:27] And he would throw that basketball, man.
[50:28] He hit you in the head and just knock
[50:30] you for a loop.
[50:32] Well, brother Earl, I had to pray
[50:34] through cuz when I was that age, I had a
[50:36] temper like an
[50:37] alligator and a body like a
[50:43] hummingbird. And those are not a good
[50:45] match,
[50:51] folks. So, I decided, you know what? I
[50:53] ain't going to take another one of them.
[50:56] And one day I old boy come at me and I
[50:58] just turned around started running at
[50:59] him and he took off
[51:01] running. I mean the guy took off
[51:03] running. I was
[51:05] like faster he run faster I run. He was
[51:08] running and it was man it had my ego
[51:10] build up till I turn around looked
[51:12] behind me and there was my big
[51:15] brother. He wasn't running from me. Oh
[51:18] no. He was running for my big brother.
[51:20] Listen, you sometimes got to remind that
[51:23] devil. Amen. Look, if you if you want to
[51:25] run away from the devil, you're going to
[51:27] get smaller and smaller and smaller and
[51:29] smaller. But if you're ready to turn and
[51:31] face that devil, there's a big brother
[51:33] here this morning that'll back you up.
[51:36] He'll tell that devil, "Don't you let
[51:38] don't you touch my
[51:40] anointed?" No. If you're ready to fight,
[51:43] there's a God that'll back you up. If
[51:45] you're ready to say to the devil, "No
[51:47] more." There's a God here that'll back
[51:49] you up this morning.
[51:51] somebody here that'll hold you that'll
[51:53] that'll have you back in the whole
[51:55] thing. You said, "Brother Wayne, I tell
[51:56] you what, we got this whole armor, but
[51:58] I'll tell you, brother Bam said, here's
[51:59] the thing that holds the whole thing
[52:00] together is truth. Truth holds the whole
[52:03] thing together." He said, "Truth is the
[52:05] thing that buckles the whole armor on
[52:07] you. It's truth." And when I say this
[52:09] this morning, this message of the hour
[52:12] is truth.
[52:14] And I believe that we could stand here
[52:16] and we could look in the Bible. We could
[52:17] say it was true. And but but but we're
[52:20] living in and modern
[52:22] times. This message is truth.
[52:26] I've often said it. There was a woman at
[52:28] the well heard the Messiah sign one
[52:30] time.
[52:32] Just one time. And she said, "Sir, I
[52:35] perceive thou art a prophet and we
[52:36] expect the Messiah that when he comes is
[52:38] supposed to tell us these things. Who
[52:40] are you?" He said, "I am he." And she
[52:43] burned up a city telling people the
[52:45] truth that she had just heard. If if
[52:48] that woman off of one off of one uh uh
[52:51] uh experience with that Messa sign, what
[52:54] about us that sits here and I have my
[52:57] sister to count them. There's over 8,300
[53:00] times recorded on tape where William
[53:03] Brandham discerned, called names, told
[53:05] sicknesses, and announced healings.
[53:07] Visions over 8,300 times. There's not
[53:10] that many in the Bible, folks.
[53:13] The whole Bible does not contain that
[53:16] many visions in the ministry of Jesus
[53:18] Christ. But he's got a greater ministry
[53:21] today than he had then. And people say,
[53:23] "Well, if I lived back then, I'd have
[53:25] believed him." No, you wouldn't have. If
[53:26] you can't take what he done today, how
[53:29] would you have ever took what he done in
[53:31] that day? Amen. Around the world over,
[53:33] this ministry has went through to affect
[53:36] the church of the living God to let you
[53:38] know who is here. It's true. This
[53:41] message is true. Let it hold your armor
[53:43] on you. It's true. If you say it ain't
[53:46] true, it's time for battle.
[53:49] See, the the truth holds on the armor.
[53:54] Now, you got to be equipped. If you're
[53:57] if you're going to face the devil,
[53:59] you're going to have to be equipped. Can
[54:01] I I love how Paul says this. He said,
[54:03] "When you when you've done everything to
[54:06] stand, then what do I do? You stand.
[54:12] There are times in your life you just
[54:14] have to stand. There ain't nothing to
[54:17] do. It's stand. Listen, when Moses was
[54:20] standing at the Red Sea, Amen. They were
[54:22] running up and down the banks. Brother
[54:23] Bram said the people would have run him
[54:24] crazy in his emotional realm. He said,
[54:27] but he got with the Lord and the Lord
[54:28] said, "Stand still and see the salvation
[54:31] of God." You know what Moses did? He
[54:33] spoke the word and stood there and
[54:35] waited for the action of the word to
[54:36] take place because he stood still and
[54:39] waited for God. And there are times in
[54:41] your life where you got to know it's
[54:42] right. You got to be certain that you've
[54:44] done it right. You got to be certain
[54:45] that things are in order. You got to be
[54:47] certain that you have prepared. Amen.
[54:49] And then when everything is against you,
[54:51] it's not a time to run. Let me say this.
[54:53] There is no running blood in this bride.
[54:56] There is no cowards in this service.
[54:58] There is no shield on the back of this
[55:00] church. We are not a group of cowards.
[55:02] We are the sons and the daughters of
[55:05] God. And we will not retreat. And we
[55:07] will not surrender. And we will not back
[55:10] up. We will not back up. We will stand
[55:14] our ground.
[55:16] [Applause]
[55:18] Now, I say this, some of the greatest
[55:19] men in the Bible took their names
[55:21] because of their stand.
[55:23] You don't read about the Alamo because
[55:25] they packed up and left.
[55:28] You read about it because they stood.
[55:30] You read about Ireanius because they
[55:32] turned him to a stake and he stood
[55:34] there.
[55:36] You you read about men of the Bible who
[55:39] like Tinddale and John the Baptist and
[55:41] John the Re. You read about these men
[55:43] for their stands that they took.
[55:46] And I'll say there's a time that when
[55:49] you've done everything you can do, you
[55:52] stand. When there's nothing else you can
[55:54] do, you tell that devil, "Amen, I'm not
[55:56] moving an inch off of the ground God
[55:58] gave me." Brother Bam said, "And in that
[56:01] moment, you turn the big blast words on
[56:04] him of thus sayaith the Lord. I know
[56:07] where I'm at. Thus saith the Lord. I
[56:10] know the message is true. Thus saith the
[56:13] Lord." Somebody said, "Well, you can't
[56:14] say thus sayaith the Lord." The prophet
[56:16] of God said, "The bride now has thus
[56:19] saith the Lord."
[56:21] How do we have thus sayith the Lord?
[56:23] We've had a prophet among us. He's given
[56:25] us the answer.
[56:29] He gave us the answer. And here we stand
[56:32] with it today. Now, you may think that
[56:35] you're not you may think that you're not
[56:37] a person that could stand, but brother
[56:39] Brandham said it like this. He said,
[56:41] "God chose a bride that would not fall.
[56:44] That would hold to that word regardless
[56:46] of what the world had to say. They would
[56:48] hold to that word. They are
[56:49] predestinated to stand there. It's the
[56:51] adoption of children but Jesus Christ
[56:53] predestinated to that glory stand. Do
[56:56] you know the prophet says it like this?
[56:57] She is the second Eve and she is not
[57:00] breaking or spulling her skirts of
[57:02] purity of holiness to her husband.
[57:03] She'll stay with that word regardless.
[57:07] You say second Eve. Now if you notice
[57:08] this, the first
[57:10] Adam, his wife fell and there was a
[57:13] second Adam to redeem the first Adam.
[57:16] But now there's a second Eve to redeem
[57:18] the first Eve. And they were both tried
[57:20] on their husband's words.
[57:23] Do you see? It's the word of God. This
[57:27] this
[57:28] bride, it may seem very
[57:30] strange that in an age of grace, in this
[57:33] evil age, brother, it seems very strange
[57:36] that God would choose this age to bring
[57:38] a bride.
[57:40] Isn't it? Is it is it strange to you
[57:43] that he chose the darkest of all the
[57:45] evilst of all ages to bring a bride out
[57:47] of that age that he says by his own word
[57:51] will be spotless and blameless.
[57:54] Oh my goodness.
[57:56] He brings her out of the darkest,
[57:59] deepest, nastiest of ages and said
[58:02] she'll be spotless and blameless. You
[58:05] know what it is? It's out of that very
[58:06] evil age. Brother Ram said what it is is
[58:09] he was going to prove to the devil.
[58:12] I love it. He's going to prove to the
[58:14] devil. You say, "What am I doing here?"
[58:16] You're proof. You're proof that there
[58:20] this Eve is not like that first Eve. You
[58:23] can't put just a little bit of a trial
[58:25] on one of his bride members and them
[58:27] just crumble under. Oh, I ain't going to
[58:29] fight you. No. No. And that's not this
[58:31] bride.
[58:34] Well, brother.
[58:38] No sir. No sir. Not a member of her. No,
[58:42] devil. If it's a fight you want. It's a
[58:45] fight you can have. I will not give up
[58:48] my young people.
[58:51] You see that? Now, there's a mama
[58:52] sitting here this morning knows what I'm
[58:54] talking about. That Satan has done
[58:56] everything he could do to rip that baby
[58:57] out of your home. And you say, "No, sir.
[59:00] Satan, you can't have them."
[59:03] And when and you say, "Well, Brother
[59:04] Wayne, they're already gone. This is the
[59:06] word. Satan, I'm coming to get them.
[59:12] I'm coming to get them. We ain't going
[59:14] to leave them behind. We're not going to
[59:16] forget they
[59:18] exist. They are our heritage. They
[59:21] belong to us. And the devil can't have
[59:25] them. You hear me? Devil, you can't have
[59:27] them.
[59:32] by God's divine authority. You can't
[59:35] have them,
[59:37] devil. We're going to have church camps.
[59:39] We're going to have youth camps. And our
[59:41] young people's going to shout and dance.
[59:43] And they're going to roll and have Holy
[59:44] Ghost meetings because I want them to
[59:47] know, you don't have to go to a bar to
[59:49] get drunk. And you don't have to go to a
[59:51] dance to dance. There is a power in the
[59:54] house of God that can give liberty and
[59:59] truth. Hey, glory to God.
[1:00:02] No, Satan. You can't have our young
[1:00:03] people. You can't have our joy. You
[1:00:06] cannot have it. You cannot take it away
[1:00:08] from us.
[1:00:10] We will fight.
[1:00:15] Yes, sir.
[1:00:17] So, Brother Wayne, what are you talking
[1:00:20] about? You are proof to the devil.
[1:00:25] I can't take this pressure. Yes, you
[1:00:27] can.
[1:00:28] Amen. Yes, you can. You're a proof to
[1:00:30] the devil.
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:34] You say, "Well, how does God know he
[1:00:37] could trust me? How do he know he could
[1:00:39] trust Job?"
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:44] Now, y'all y'all forgive me, but I I
[1:00:46] just was I was just studying this week
[1:00:48] and I saw a tremendous parallel here.
[1:00:51] When you're ending ending the Ephesians
[1:00:54] 5, you're hearing Paul talk about a
[1:00:56] blameless church without spot or
[1:00:59] wrinkle. Have you ever read the first
[1:01:01] book of Job, right in the first
[1:01:03] chapter, and see what God was saying
[1:01:06] about Job?
[1:01:07] He was blameless.
[1:01:09] He was perfect. Job and the bride are in
[1:01:13] the same place before their temptations
[1:01:15] began.
[1:01:18] And God showed through Job and proved to
[1:01:20] the devil and he's chose you in this
[1:01:23] age.
[1:01:25] And he's proven to the devil by your
[1:01:27] life
[1:01:29] that there is a woman that's going to
[1:01:30] stand. There is a young person that's
[1:01:32] going to stand in this end time. It
[1:01:34] don't matter what the rest of them are
[1:01:36] doing. Somebody's going to hold on to
[1:01:38] this message. I know. I I know what I'm
[1:01:40] saying. people going every which way,
[1:01:42] but somebody's going to stand in the
[1:01:44] middle of it all and hold the message
[1:01:46] banner up and say it's true. This
[1:01:49] message is true.
[1:01:51] [Applause]
[1:01:52] Amen. There's got to be a stand.
[1:01:56] If you go to Job, just follow along with
[1:01:58] me. Job 1 and6, watch what this happens
[1:02:00] when when all of a sudden you're getting
[1:02:02] a look. Now, I won't be here all day, so
[1:02:03] just just bear with me a moment. We we
[1:02:06] watch Job. We watch Job give us a view
[1:02:09] of something you hardly see.
[1:02:12] You hardly see the battle behind the
[1:02:14] battle. Usually, you're just fooling
[1:02:17] with what you can see in the natural,
[1:02:18] but you never really know what's behind
[1:02:20] things.
[1:02:22] But Job opens up and shows you the
[1:02:25] generals. It shows you the great army
[1:02:28] and how it was being designed up in the
[1:02:31] heavens. And the Bible said, "And there
[1:02:33] was a day when the sons of God come to
[1:02:35] present themselves before the Lord and
[1:02:37] Satan come along with them." Now, Satan
[1:02:38] is real. So, I I'm not going to preach.
[1:02:40] We already preached there. Satan is real
[1:02:43] and he come among them. So, there is a
[1:02:46] real
[1:02:46] devil and he is a tempter. This portion
[1:02:50] of scripture is going to let you hear
[1:02:52] the devil's own words, what he's up to.
[1:02:57] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence
[1:02:59] comest thou?" And then Satan answered
[1:03:02] and said, 'Lord, from going to and fro
[1:03:05] in the earth and from walking up and
[1:03:08] down in
[1:03:10] it. Now, what's he doing? What's he
[1:03:14] doing going up and down in the earth?
[1:03:16] What's he doing looking
[1:03:17] around? According to the book of Peter,
[1:03:20] he's looking for somebody to devour.
[1:03:23] He's like a roaring lion and he's and
[1:03:26] he's prowling the earth and he's looking
[1:03:28] for somebody that he can just devour.
[1:03:30] He's looking for prey.
[1:03:33] He's looking for somebody he can take
[1:03:35] out.
[1:03:37] This is amazing. Satan begins to tell
[1:03:40] the Lord what he's doing? And the Lord
[1:03:43] said to
[1:03:44] Satan, "Has thou considered my servant
[1:03:48] Job?" I tell you what,
[1:03:51] man, if you could just put your name
[1:03:54] right there. Yes, sir.
[1:03:57] You said, "Breacher, what are you seeing
[1:03:59] in that?" I tell you what I'm seeing.
[1:04:00] God knew Job by first name.
[1:04:06] The king of all kings.
[1:04:09] Knew this man's first name and had
[1:04:12] confidence in him. Brother Bam said,
[1:04:14] "The reason being is cuz him and Job
[1:04:16] talked often.
[1:04:18] They had fellowship."
[1:04:21] So God knew him.
[1:04:24] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou
[1:04:26] considered my servant Job? There is none
[1:04:28] like him in the earth. Perfect and
[1:04:29] upright man, one that fearth God. Have
[1:04:33] thou considered Amen. Have thou
[1:04:36] considered him? He's perfect and he's
[1:04:37] upright. Here's what the Lord's the
[1:04:39] Lord's laying on him now. Hey, it's one
[1:04:43] thing to be the tallest tree in the
[1:04:45] forest, but you're going to draw
[1:04:48] lightning.
[1:04:51] You say, "Well, I'm the best Christian
[1:04:52] in the church." Well, don't think it's
[1:04:54] going to be good days all days.
[1:04:57] Cuz if you are God's example,
[1:05:01] let me tell you, all hell has pointed
[1:05:03] their targets at you.
[1:05:07] And the Lord said, "If thou consider my
[1:05:09] servant Job, he's a perfect and upright
[1:05:11] man." Now watch this. This is God
[1:05:14] estimating Job just like God estimates
[1:05:17] this bride.
[1:05:19] Now you see then I can hear the Lord in
[1:05:23] this end time battle. Have you
[1:05:25] considered
[1:05:26] My second Eve.
[1:05:30] I just tore that first Eve apart. I tell
[1:05:32] you what, I have you considered.
[1:05:35] My second Eve.
[1:05:37] She's spotless and blameless.
[1:05:40] Can you imagine? I tell you, it's
[1:05:42] powerful to my Well, I s read this
[1:05:44] yesterday. I thought I was going to
[1:05:45] shout my way out of my shed.
[1:05:49] Satan answered the Lord and said, "Doeth
[1:05:53] Job fear God for not?" Oh, so Satan knew
[1:05:58] his name, too.
[1:06:01] This man was not just known in heaven.
[1:06:04] He was known in hell. And I tell you
[1:06:07] what, I I think it was Martin Luther
[1:06:09] said, "I just soon be known in hell."
[1:06:11] Yeah. Amen. As in heaven. I want to be
[1:06:13] well known in hell just as I'm known in
[1:06:15] heaven. Amen. I tell you what, he wasn't
[1:06:18] well known for a reason that he was with
[1:06:20] him. And I tell you what, I pray to God
[1:06:23] that the devil wakes up every morning
[1:06:25] and when he hears my name, he tells the
[1:06:27] devils, "Y'all better run and hide. Here
[1:06:28] he comes again."
[1:06:31] I know these devils think that that
[1:06:33] we're just pray. But listen, brother,
[1:06:35] he's going to get his he's going to get
[1:06:37] his feather singed in this meeting
[1:06:40] cuz he's a devil and we know his name.
[1:06:42] We know who he is and we know the power
[1:06:44] that we exceed over him this morning.
[1:06:47] Look like this. Hey man, had you
[1:06:49] considered her? And here it is. Job, he
[1:06:52] said, has he and Job uh feared God for
[1:06:55] not what? Watch what he says. Has thou
[1:06:57] not made a hedge? So he had been
[1:06:59] trying. Tells it right here. He had been
[1:07:03] trying. Have you considered my job? Uh
[1:07:06] my And the devil acts like he hadn't.
[1:07:08] But watch what he says. You got a hedge
[1:07:10] around him. How'd that man know it was a
[1:07:12] security system around that bank?
[1:07:15] How'd he know what kind of security
[1:07:16] system you had on your house?
[1:07:19] Because he'd been over there looking how
[1:07:21] to get in. And he said it. He said,
[1:07:23] "Hey, listen." He said, "There's a hedge
[1:07:25] about this man in his house and all
[1:07:27] about that hath on every side, and thou
[1:07:29] hast blessed the work of his hands, and
[1:07:31] his substance is increased in the land."
[1:07:33] Amen. Now look at this. Amen. But this
[1:07:36] devil, amen, says to him, in other
[1:07:39] words, this devil, there's a there's a
[1:07:42] actually the definition of devil was
[1:07:44] slander and accusation. And one of the
[1:07:46] one of the definition schedules there
[1:07:47] actually says he's a slander of both God
[1:07:50] and man. Because here he's
[1:07:53] slandering the
[1:07:54] God Job to God. But then later in the
[1:07:58] scripture in Zechariah, you see he does
[1:07:59] the same thing to Joshua. So in other
[1:08:02] words, he whoever he's with, he's
[1:08:04] slandering the other person. and he's
[1:08:06] slandering Job. And you know what he
[1:08:08] says to him? This is the thing that I I
[1:08:10] found most important about this part is
[1:08:12] that his his worship it's cheap.
[1:08:17] Look how he cheapens the praise of Job.
[1:08:21] Look what he says to him. Well, you put
[1:08:23] an edge around the man. You've given him
[1:08:26] wealth. He's got wealth. He's got kids.
[1:08:28] He's got family. He's got a home. He's
[1:08:30] got sheep. He's got cattle. He's got
[1:08:32] everything he needs. Well, why wouldn't
[1:08:33] he worship you? You bought him.
[1:08:39] You You bought him out.
[1:08:42] Of course he worshiped you. Everything's
[1:08:45] easy.
[1:08:48] You back off of him. Let me have him.
[1:08:50] He'll curse you to your face. See what
[1:08:53] he says? In other words, if you wasn't
[1:08:55] protecting this man and giving him money
[1:08:57] all the time and helping him, well, I
[1:08:58] tell you what, he wouldn't he wouldn't
[1:09:00] worship you, God. He wouldn't worship
[1:09:01] you none because you're not worthy of
[1:09:03] worship. You got to buy your
[1:09:04] worship. You see what he did? He
[1:09:07] cheapened. He cheapened the worship that
[1:09:10] was being given. Listen, let me say
[1:09:11] this. Amen. I'll tell you this. First of
[1:09:13] all, Satan knew Job. And second of all,
[1:09:17] he now slanders Job's worship to God as
[1:09:20] if it wasn't coming from his heart. It
[1:09:23] was coming from the things that had been
[1:09:24] given to him. But God told him, he said,
[1:09:27] "I tell you what you do. You put forth
[1:09:29] your hand now and touch him, but don't
[1:09:30] take his life." Now, what's that tell
[1:09:33] you? It tells you the devil's on a short
[1:09:34] leash.
[1:09:36] It tells you he can't do everything he
[1:09:39] thinks he can do to you. That's right.
[1:09:40] He can't touch you the way he told you
[1:09:43] he could. He can only do what God
[1:09:45] allows. And if God allows it, let me say
[1:09:47] this, he's already prepared you for it.
[1:09:51] When when and and I I wish we had time.
[1:09:53] I'd almost like to have messengers come
[1:09:55] run up here and start telling me. If you
[1:09:57] read Job the 2 chapter, messengers start
[1:09:59] coming into his house immediately. and
[1:10:01] you you lost all your goods, you've lost
[1:10:02] your house, you've lost your wealth, and
[1:10:04] the last one comes in, you've lost all
[1:10:06] your children. And when they start
[1:10:08] piling all of this on this man, amen,
[1:10:11] the devil set with all of his angels,
[1:10:13] his braggs already come. You let me
[1:10:15] touch him and he'll curse you. He only
[1:10:18] worships you because of what he has. And
[1:10:20] the Bible said in Job chapter 1, then
[1:10:23] Job arose and rent his metal and shaved
[1:10:26] his head and he fell down to ground and
[1:10:30] worshiped God.
[1:10:32] But he's standing there with nothing at
[1:10:34] all. He has got nothing. He's got no
[1:10:36] land. He's got no wealth. He's got no
[1:10:38] children. He's got no farms. He's got no
[1:10:40] cattle. He has nothing. And he just lays
[1:10:43] down and starts worshiping God. He's not
[1:10:47] worshiping God because of what he has.
[1:10:49] He's not worshiping God because of
[1:10:50] cattle, because of land, because of
[1:10:52] children, because of wealth. He's
[1:10:53] worshiping God because he knows who he
[1:10:56] is. And any man here this morning, amen,
[1:10:59] that really knows God, you don't have to
[1:11:01] buy their worship. You don't have to sit
[1:11:04] here this morning, amen, and pump and
[1:11:06] prime and try to get somebody to worship
[1:11:09] God. I tell you what, this bride
[1:11:11] worships God because she knows who he
[1:11:13] is. She don't worship God just under
[1:11:16] emotional inspiration. She worships God.
[1:11:19] Amen. At the death of her children. I've
[1:11:21] seen this bride church right here. I've
[1:11:24] seen them in despair and see them with
[1:11:26] her hands lifted up as they begin to
[1:11:29] worship God because their worship ain't
[1:11:32] cheap. It ain't something that you can
[1:11:34] make fun of or just set aside. Their
[1:11:37] worship ain't cheap. Their worship is
[1:11:39] for God. I'll tell you what she'll do.
[1:11:42] She'll worship in troubled times. She'll
[1:11:44] worship in problems. She'll worship in
[1:11:46] the middle of her trials. I'll tell you
[1:11:48] why she's worshiping. Not because of
[1:11:50] what she has, but because of who he is.
[1:11:54] I sat there and read this yesterday and
[1:11:56] I started thinking about who the God is
[1:11:58] that I serve. I tell you what. Amen. How
[1:12:01] could you think about the one that could
[1:12:03] create the heavens and the earth and not
[1:12:05] worship him? You're talking about a God
[1:12:07] who could just span his hand out like
[1:12:09] that and worlds come into creation. He
[1:12:12] could look up like that and one one
[1:12:14] spray of his hands and stars begin to
[1:12:18] come off of him, he could turn and look
[1:12:20] and one stroke of his brilliance and
[1:12:22] every person in this room could be
[1:12:24] changed in the moment, in the twinkle of
[1:12:26] an eye. We're talking about a God who
[1:12:28] desires worship. And he don't just
[1:12:31] desire it. Brother Mackey deserves it.
[1:12:33] He deserves worship. He deserves us to
[1:12:36] worship him. He deserves us to praise
[1:12:39] him. Look at what God has done for us,
[1:12:42] not what he has gave us. Amen. I think
[1:12:45] about when I was dead and undying in my
[1:12:47] sin. Amen. He died for me when I was yet
[1:12:52] a sinner. He died for me. Amen. Listen,
[1:12:56] one of the one of the great men of old,
[1:12:58] I think it was Martin Luther himself
[1:12:59] said this. He said, "If Christ is in
[1:13:01] ain't not in heaven, I don't want to go
[1:13:03] there."
[1:13:06] Somebody told me one time said, "When
[1:13:07] you get to heaven, Jesus will just be
[1:13:09] your brother." I said, "Well, it ain't
[1:13:10] the heaven I'm going to."
[1:13:15] Jesus is the Lord of lords, and he's the
[1:13:19] king of kings.
[1:13:22] I know God made Moses a God to the
[1:13:25] people, but not a worshshiping God,
[1:13:29] but a mouthpiece to them. Do you see
[1:13:31] what it is? There was nothing that could
[1:13:34] be taken from
[1:13:35] Job that would change his worship to
[1:13:39] God. You think about this just for a
[1:13:42] moment this morning that
[1:13:45] Job without
[1:13:48] anything he worshiped God and these
[1:13:51] beautiful words come from his
[1:13:54] lips. Blessed be the Lord,
[1:13:58] the Lord that gives
[1:14:01] and the Lord that takes. Right.
[1:14:04] Blessed
[1:14:06] be the name of the Lord.
[1:14:12] William Randoms just buried his
[1:14:14] daughter. He just buried his wife. Laid
[1:14:17] him in the same tomb
[1:14:20] together. God ain't said nothing to him
[1:14:22] in days. He's been quiet,
[1:14:24] silent. And when God is silent, the
[1:14:27] enemy talks.
[1:14:29] And while he's walking along the street,
[1:14:31] the devil says to him, "All you ever
[1:14:33] done was preach the gospel, pray for the
[1:14:37] sick, and all you ever done is give your
[1:14:39] life to this God." And now your baby's
[1:14:42] dying. She's in the grave and you're got
[1:14:45] a young boy and he needs his mama and
[1:14:47] she's in the grave. And brother Brandham
[1:14:49] said, "I was listening to him." He said,
[1:14:52] 'And I formed the words in my mind, and
[1:14:56] it was about to come out of my lips to
[1:14:58] say, 'If he can't help me, then I can't
[1:15:00] serve him. He said, but before they
[1:15:02] before they come out of my lips, y he
[1:15:05] said out of my being.
[1:15:09] Out of my birth came the words, "The
[1:15:12] Lord giveth and the Lord taketh. Blessed
[1:15:15] be the name of the Lord." Can you
[1:15:17] imagine William Brandon walking down the
[1:15:19] street with his hands in his in his in
[1:15:22] the air saying, "God, I don't understand
[1:15:24] you, but I love you. I don't understand
[1:15:26] the trial, but I love you, Lord. You're
[1:15:28] a mighty God. I'm going to serve you
[1:15:30] anyhow, though the devil comes at me in
[1:15:33] every which way. I'm going I'm going to
[1:15:34] love you anyhow, Lord. I'm going to love
[1:15:36] you if I'm up. I'm going to love you if
[1:15:38] I'm down. I'm going to worship you all
[1:15:40] the time, Lord. It doesn't make any
[1:15:41] difference." Let me say something to you
[1:15:43] this morning. This bride is not a cheap
[1:15:46] woman. She cannot be bought with a few
[1:15:48] material goods. This bride can't be
[1:15:50] bought with just a good day. Amen. Or a
[1:15:53] good little blessing in her life. I tell
[1:15:55] you why she is the bride. Because she's
[1:15:57] ordained to be. She's predestinated to
[1:16:00] be. And she gave her life to this God.
[1:16:03] And here she stands this morning. And
[1:16:05] she will worship. Amen. At his bidding.
[1:16:08] And I say this with all my heart. The
[1:16:11] devil does not control my worship.
[1:16:13] [Applause]
[1:16:15] He does not tell me when it's a good
[1:16:17] time or when it's a bad time. Amen. I'll
[1:16:19] tell you what controls my worship is my
[1:16:22] God. And when he puts it in my heart, I
[1:16:24] will praise him anyhow. I will praise
[1:16:27] him in the face of my Amen. of my
[1:16:29] troubles. I will praise him in the face
[1:16:31] of every issue. Let me tell you this
[1:16:33] this morning. Sometimes that's exactly
[1:16:36] what you really need to do. You just
[1:16:38] need to praise the Lord. You need to
[1:16:40] tell that situation you're facing how
[1:16:42] good your God is. You need to say to
[1:16:44] that financial difficulty, I serve the
[1:16:46] God of Jehovah Gyra. I serve a God that
[1:16:49] owns the cattle of the thousand hills.
[1:16:52] And it it may look like, Amen, I'm
[1:16:54] surrounded, but I'm surrounded by the
[1:16:56] angels of God. Listen, you don't know.
[1:16:59] You can't see what really is around you
[1:17:02] this morning. This whole room is full of
[1:17:05] the angels of God. And you know what
[1:17:07] they're doing? They're charging you.
[1:17:08] They're charging you. They're saying to
[1:17:10] you, "Yes, it's right. Yes, that's God.
[1:17:13] Yes, that's true. Yes, that's the
[1:17:15] message. Yes, that's the power of God.
[1:17:17] And there's a devil over there and he's
[1:17:19] saying, "That's not right. Why is that
[1:17:21] man so excited? Why is he saying things
[1:17:23] like that? That's not right. You
[1:17:24] shouldn't believe him. You shouldn't
[1:17:25] listen to him. He's going to lead you
[1:17:27] this way. He's going to say this to
[1:17:28] you." But you know what? There's a
[1:17:29] battle going on. And it's up to you.
[1:17:32] Amen. Who's going to win that battle?
[1:17:34] And if you would let your faith begin to
[1:17:35] lean with the energizing faith of those
[1:17:38] angels that are in this building right
[1:17:40] now, you would find an explosion in your
[1:17:42] life that the devil could not handle.
[1:17:45] Can you imagine this morning the power
[1:17:48] of God flowing through this
[1:17:51] building? There's not a there's not a
[1:17:55] devil in
[1:17:56] hell's got a right to tell you you can't
[1:17:58] praise God.
[1:18:03] Not a devil in hell got a right to tell
[1:18:05] you you hold your worship.
[1:18:11] He's God.
[1:18:15] He's God.
[1:18:17] If our musicians could come this
[1:18:19] morning. I got more I got more sermon.
[1:18:22] They got time.
[1:18:28] So, brother Wayne, what am I going to
[1:18:29] do? Hold it now. Hold Hold the
[1:18:34] line. Hold the
[1:18:36] line. It's an unseen world going on
[1:18:39] right now. Unseen battle happening right
[1:18:41] now. You say, "What do I do?" Hold the
[1:18:43] line.
[1:18:46] So, how do I hold the line? Hold your
[1:18:48] testimony.
[1:18:50] Hold fast. Now,
[1:18:53] got a lot laying here on this point, but
[1:18:54] I I'll just make it real real short to
[1:18:56] you.
[1:18:58] You're a twofold being and part of you
[1:19:01] is associated with
[1:19:04] angels. And the angels of God are
[1:19:06] encamped into the building. That's it's
[1:19:07] that's prophetic, but it's
[1:19:11] real. And while they're camped into that
[1:19:13] building, listen
[1:19:16] now. How many remember the day you
[1:19:19] received salvation in your life? You
[1:19:21] remember that day? Yes, sir. You didn't
[1:19:23] get one physical evidence you was saved.
[1:19:29] You had the same hair, the same eyes,
[1:19:31] the same body, the same clothes,
[1:19:36] but something happened.
[1:19:39] And it happened in the unseen realm,
[1:19:41] didn't it?
[1:19:44] But then in the natural realm, you begin
[1:19:45] to testify, this has happened. Brother
[1:19:49] Bram said, "It's the same way with
[1:19:50] healing.
[1:19:52] You may not have one physical thing in
[1:19:54] your body this morning that says you're
[1:19:56] any better than you was when you walked
[1:19:57] in this building, but something has
[1:19:59] happened in you. And something inside of
[1:20:02] you has be to say, you know
[1:20:05] what? I'm healed.
[1:20:08] There was a healing just struck my body.
[1:20:11] Maybe not nothing physical, but you got
[1:20:14] a testimony to leave here for. You
[1:20:16] remember when that night left
[1:20:18] you? Brother Daryl put his hand on you
[1:20:20] and prayed for you. She carries pictures
[1:20:22] around. If you ain't never heard this
[1:20:24] testimony, you need to get with her and
[1:20:26] hear the testimony. She had a huge knot
[1:20:29] right behind her ear. And brother Daryl
[1:20:30] Ward prayed for
[1:20:31] her. How many weeks was
[1:20:36] it? We a
[1:20:39] couple. Four days.
[1:20:43] In four days.
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:46] It didn't drop off at the platform.
[1:20:49] It could.
[1:20:52] Right. Amen. It didn't.
[1:20:55] But the life died that very moment.
[1:21:00] Was in the supernatural realm. Oh, God.
[1:21:04] Do you see right now in the supernatural
[1:21:06] realm, there's a battle. And there's an
[1:21:09] enemy saying the word is true. A word
[1:21:11] ain't true. And there's God saying the
[1:21:12] word is true. And then inside you right
[1:21:15] now, you've got to make up your mind
[1:21:17] which side you're on.
[1:21:21] And when you get that, when you get that
[1:21:23] that you believe God,
[1:21:25] then you hold your testimony.
[1:21:30] Well, brother Wayne, I started believing
[1:21:31] 20 years ago. Well, Abraham was 25.
[1:21:36] And I know this morning there is
[1:21:38] something in the supernatural realm.
[1:21:41] Satan has told the Lord, "Oh, she's
[1:21:44] cheap.
[1:21:48] Oh, he only worships you because you
[1:21:50] gave him that big greenhouse
[1:21:52] and got all that family around him. You
[1:21:56] know, folks, we talk about Ed
[1:22:00] Dalton. We talk about Hattie,
[1:22:03] right? Well, you know, you got one of
[1:22:05] them sitting right among you.
[1:22:07] Brother Aiden sitting right there.
[1:22:10] God's giving him his whole family.
[1:22:14] I don't know if you ever noticed that or
[1:22:15] not.
[1:22:18] the whole family.
[1:22:22] But when God done it, it was so humble,
[1:22:25] he probably didn't even recognize it
[1:22:26] himself.
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:30] And one day we were talking and I said,
[1:22:31] "Well, you're a lot like and he seen it
[1:22:34] hit his eyes."
[1:22:37] But God had done it so humble, but it
[1:22:40] was done.
[1:22:43] Brother David, God's did that for you.
[1:22:48] You know, I remember that I was sitting
[1:22:49] there one day preaching the gospel and I
[1:22:51] was thinking about how he right and I
[1:22:52] was preaching right away, brother Seth.
[1:22:54] You know how it goes. I was preaching
[1:22:55] like I was this morning. I was
[1:22:57] preaching and there was something coming
[1:22:59] right back into
[1:23:01] me. He said, "Because thou hast
[1:23:03] believed, I give you
[1:23:05] yours." That wasn't another man standing
[1:23:07] on that platform, but there was somebody
[1:23:09] up there talking to me.
[1:23:12] Look at what the Lord's done.
[1:23:15] Look, look at Brother Ericson. Look what
[1:23:17] the Lord has done.
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:22] But I'm going to tell you something you
[1:23:24] could do. You could take everything that
[1:23:27] man has and he'd worship God in the
[1:23:30] morning.
[1:23:35] And you know what? You look at a at a at
[1:23:37] an elder and you look at somebody and
[1:23:39] you say that about them. But let me tell
[1:23:40] you, if you could look in the unseen
[1:23:43] world, God has spoke to the devil about
[1:23:47] you. And he said, "They're a spotless
[1:23:51] bride." What a powerful thing this
[1:23:53] morning.
[1:23:56] So, what's all the battle about, Brother
[1:23:57] Wayne? Take a peek in
[1:24:01] heaven and you'll see God's using you to
[1:24:04] prove to the devil
[1:24:06] that you're not like that Eve. Do you
[1:24:09] love him this morning? Won't you stand
[1:24:11] to your feet today?
[1:24:19] You are not a God
[1:24:23] ced by human
[1:24:27] hands. You are not a
[1:24:30] God
[1:24:32] dependent on any mortal man.
[1:24:37] You are not a God in need
[1:24:42] of anything we can
[1:24:46] give by your
[1:24:49] plan. That's just the way it is.
[1:24:58] For you are God
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:02] alone from before time
[1:25:07] began. You were on your
[1:25:12] throne. You are God alone.
[1:25:18] And right
[1:25:21] now in the good times a
[1:25:26] bad you are on your
[1:25:30] throne. You are God alone.
[1:25:36] [Music]
