[0:03] uh we'd like to speak from here this
[0:05] morning if we could Ephesians chapter
[0:09] 1 verses 6 and
[0:20] seven I'm sorry I I just can't hardly
[0:23] ever get used to his presence it's just
[0:25] so it's just breathtaking at
[0:28] times Ephesians chap 1 and verse
[0:32] 6 to the praise of the glory of his
[0:36] grace wherein he hath made us
[0:39] accepted in the
[0:42] Beloved in whom we have
[0:46] Redemption through his blood the
[0:49] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[0:52] riches of his grace we ask the Lord
[0:56] bless his words you could be seated this
[0:58] morning I I want to speak to you just a
[1:00] few minutes here on the book of
[1:02] Ephesians here this paragraph part six
[1:05] and seven here of uh of Ephesian chapter
[1:08] one uh if I would take a title this
[1:12] morning I would like to just take the
[1:14] title of a boldness through the blood
[1:16] cell a boldness through the blood cell
[1:19] and uh I want to uh refer back to
[1:22] something brother brandham says here in
[1:24] the adoption part three paragraph 86 I
[1:28] think it's a very powerful
[1:30] he said that we could go back and he
[1:32] said we could see Elohim where he
[1:35] self-existent and come back through
[1:37] Jehova who made something who gave man
[1:40] dominion over the
[1:41] earth now what are we waiting for the
[1:46] manifestations the Earth is groaning now
[1:49] let's get down to it and read it all
[1:51] right predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:55] children by himself according to the
[1:56] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:58] of the glory of his grace
[2:00] what is his grace now back before when
[2:04] he wasn't a father his grace is love
[2:06] made himself a child that we might be
[2:09] predestinated unto the adoption of
[2:11] children to the praise of his grace
[2:14] wherein he has made us acceptable the
[2:17] person the Beloved which is Christ he
[2:19] made us accepted by him and how do we
[2:22] get into him by one Spirit we're all
[2:24] baptized into him in whom we have
[2:27] Redemption through the blood the
[2:30] Forgiveness of
[2:32] sins now how can we preach
[2:36] predestination of God and for anation
[2:38] and setting unless there's a sin
[2:41] atonement
[2:42] somewhere so Prophet is taking the
[2:45] scripture to prove the predestination of
[2:47] God and then he asked it's a it's a very
[2:50] a very powerful question how can we
[2:53] preach predestination as such as we do
[2:56] and not preach an atonement to go along
[2:59] with it because it would be impossible
[3:01] to predestinate without paying the sin
[3:03] debt for man where he's going to be so
[3:06] why is it each day now I'll just reread
[3:09] here this portion how can you preach
[3:11] predestination of God and for ordaining
[3:13] and setting unless there's a sin
[3:15] atonement
[3:16] somewhere why is it that each day you
[3:19] make a mistake and each day you do
[3:22] wrong but if you're born again man or
[3:25] woman as soon as you make that mistake
[3:27] God knows you're sorry for it my you can
[3:31] stand in the president of uh uh presence
[3:33] of President Roosevelt or anybody and
[3:36] say I'm wrong God forgive me for this
[3:38] thing and theirs were the blood
[3:41] atonement you notice sins now the
[3:45] scripture says Redemption through the
[3:47] blood and the Forgiveness of sins now
[3:50] brother Ram said don't forget this
[3:51] book's not to everyone this is to the
[3:53] church he said so forgiveness of sins is
[3:56] not speaking to the sinner because he's
[3:58] not accepted Christ yet he's just a
[4:00] sinner he said but this is speaking to
[4:03] the believer who has already been
[4:05] redeemed and there is a forgiveness of
[4:07] sins now you notice that sins a sinner
[4:11] is a sinner he does not commit sins but
[4:14] the church commits sin does wrong gets a
[4:18] wrong thought has a wrong impression
[4:21] makes Scruples wobbles like a little
[4:23] child walking trying to learn how to
[4:25] walk he just don't know how to walk good
[4:28] yet cuz he's a little boy but we have a
[4:31] hand that reaches down oh God and he
[4:35] steadies us and says make the step this
[4:37] way son he doesn't pick us up and spank
[4:41] us because we made a mistake he doesn't
[4:44] beat us to death because we're trying to
[4:46] walk he loves us like we love our
[4:51] children now if anybody's everever
[4:53] taught a child to walk in here now
[4:54] you're Understanding God's uh attitude
[4:57] toward you as a Believer he's not
[4:59] waiting for something that he can
[5:01] destroy you for but if he sees the if he
[5:04] sees the failure he just reach and pick
[5:05] you up and set you back on your feet now
[5:08] the prophet of God again he'll he'll
[5:09] tell us in Redemption by power it's a
[5:11] powerful sermon if you haven't listened
[5:13] to it it's in 1954 brother BR says but
[5:16] see the trouble with the church today is
[5:18] we're scared to death we're going to
[5:20] make a failure he says but how can you
[5:23] fail when you're in Christ you can't
[5:26] fail he says you've got everlasting life
[5:29] and all demons in hell can't shake you
[5:33] you got everlasting life Jesus said so
[5:36] so don't be scared of
[5:39] failure isn't that powerful don't be
[5:42] scared of failure you say well I'm
[5:44] afraid I'll get to be a fanatic I'd
[5:46] rather have a little fanaticism than to
[5:49] sit still and do nothing he says a man
[5:52] has got to do something he said I was a
[5:54] man getting hired the other day and a
[5:55] fellow said to him he said sign your
[5:57] name here and he said he he took his
[6:00] pencil to sign and he says where's your
[6:02] eraser at and the man says I don't have
[6:05] none he said he said he said I don't
[6:07] make mistakes and he said uh the boss
[6:10] said well I can't use you cuz you ain't
[6:12] going to do nothing he says that's right
[6:14] you don't no make no mistakes he says
[6:17] that means you're not doing nothing amen
[6:20] go ahead amen because you see that when
[6:22] someone does something amen there's
[6:25] always the opportunity for a mistake or
[6:27] a failure or a wobble or a situ a amen
[6:30] but we don't want to be found setting we
[6:32] we don't want to be found just idling
[6:35] along we want to be moving in the
[6:37] presence of God and uh you know when I
[6:40] read things like this it it makes me
[6:42] think of how the prophet says in the
[6:44] message of Grace he said I think of
[6:46] Abraham and all the mistakes that he
[6:48] made now Abraham this great patriarch
[6:51] brother BR immediately Abraham and all
[6:53] the mistakes he made amen and Moses and
[6:56] all of his mistakes he said but when
[6:58] Abraham's commentary AR was written when
[7:00] the Divine commentary was written Paul
[7:02] wrote Abraham's commentary and he never
[7:05] mentioned one thing about Abraham's
[7:07] unbelief he said no he says because it
[7:10] wasn't accounted to him Abraham
[7:12] staggered not at the promise of God
[7:14] through unbelief but was strong giving
[7:17] praise to God and brother R said my
[7:19] humble prayer is by Grace he says I hope
[7:22] mine's wrot like that that he won't see
[7:25] my mistakes that when my commentary is
[7:28] written when my OB is given he said I
[7:31] pray that it won't be able to read out
[7:33] the mistakes that I made and done wrong
[7:35] that he'll only see the things I tried
[7:38] to do for
[7:40] him this is pretty powerful stuff to me
[7:43] Amen in the private interview in 1964
[7:46] brother bam lays a thought to our sister
[7:48] Bruce who is is is very troubled and
[7:50] brother bam steps in the back right
[7:52] before the Masterpiece and has an
[7:53] interview with her and when he begins to
[7:55] talk to her he describes to her amen
[7:59] about him going to pray for her and he
[8:01] said I'm fixing to pray for you he said
[8:03] but I'm not worthy of that I think but
[8:06] what would Jesus do if he was sitting
[8:09] here now and what would he do if he was
[8:12] sitting here now watch brother BR said
[8:14] in myself now I don't feel like I could
[8:16] do this he said but what would Jesus do
[8:18] if he was sitting here he said he'd lay
[8:20] your hands on you with great faith and
[8:23] you'd get well well I think I think I'm
[8:27] a sinner he said but I'm not
[8:30] but I can come to represent him and
[8:32] remember me being a sinner and before
[8:35] God I'm not a sinner and I always like
[8:38] this quote and neither are
[8:40] you amen isn't that powerful but neither
[8:43] are you so brother M explaining to her
[8:46] you're sitting there as a Believer and
[8:48] you're having these struggles with your
[8:49] own mistakes and your own issues and
[8:51] your own problems and he says but see
[8:53] I'm going to be praying for you and I'm
[8:56] in the same seats you are but I've got
[8:58] to pray for you Amen brother B says it
[9:01] one place he talks about going down
[9:02] somewhere said I'm waiting on a vision
[9:04] from the Lord to go pray for a certain
[9:05] person and he said but see after the
[9:07] vision comes it would be the same dirty
[9:09] hands that pray as it would before the
[9:12] vision but Faith In The Blood would
[9:14] remove see it gives the it gives the
[9:16] courage to go ahead and make the prayer
[9:18] it gives you the courage to go ahead and
[9:20] believe and the prophet of God says it
[9:22] like this we got a blood sacrifice
[9:24] laying there and God don't see us he
[9:27] hears our voice but he sees the blood of
[9:29] Christ oh he sees the blood of his own
[9:33] son it's our voice but it's Christ's
[9:35] blood then it's Christ that's talking
[9:37] through us to God so therefore we're not
[9:40] Sinners anymore we are Christians well
[9:44] glory to God if that could ring through
[9:46] this congregation this morning the devil
[9:48] would lose every battle in every home in
[9:51] every situation and every problem there
[9:54] wouldn't be one amen one defeated soul
[9:57] in this building this morning if you
[9:59] could recognize what the blood of Christ
[10:01] has done for you as an individual and
[10:04] you could just say I'm not a sinner but
[10:06] I'm a Christian I a Believer and Satan
[10:09] just get out of the way this morning
[10:10] because I come to worship God under the
[10:13] power of the blood amen I tell you this
[10:16] when you start seeing the church coming
[10:18] out from under the condemnation standing
[10:21] under the power of the blood sister
[10:23] Bruce is going to is going to argue with
[10:26] brother brandom as we would let's go
[10:28] ahead and read her AR argument I make so
[10:30] many
[10:31] mistakes amen and I fail so many times
[10:35] here's brother bram's answer that's why
[10:37] Christ had to die he says with your
[10:40] mistakes wouldn't be deloted to you he
[10:43] took your mistakes your desire in your
[10:46] heart is to serve him oh my that's what
[10:49] he died for so you could serve him amen
[10:51] if you're sitting here this morning you
[10:53] said brother Wayne My Desire is to serve
[10:55] god brother Ram said that's why he died
[10:57] so that you could serve him without the
[10:59] condemnation of sin but you could serve
[11:02] him and love him with all of your heart
[11:05] when I think of this this morning when
[11:07] he says to her he says your mistakes are
[11:09] not lotted not lotted to you he is your
[11:12] propitiation he is your sin offering
[11:15] your sins are not known you're not a
[11:17] sinner before God Christ has took your
[11:20] sins and became you because you desired
[11:23] to serve
[11:25] him I'll tell you one thing amen the
[11:29] devil can can beat you around on a stump
[11:32] amen but he can't take that desire to
[11:33] serve God out of your heart and as long
[11:36] as that desire is in there to serve God
[11:38] there's a blood sacrifice laying there
[11:41] for you as a Believer he said brother
[11:43] man said I said but look sister don't
[11:46] you look at yourself now here's the
[11:48] problem right don't you look at yourself
[11:51] it's just what your desire is and what
[11:53] you're trying to do and if you really
[11:56] love the Lord you'll try to serve him
[11:57] with all your heart then all of your
[11:59] mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord
[12:02] see he made a way I tell you what I I
[12:04] just in my own studies when I was
[12:06] reading this I just wanted to get up and
[12:07] run around the table or or get up and
[12:09] run around the office or something I
[12:11] mean it just it just it just explodes in
[12:13] your heart to know that God is looking
[12:16] at the desire of the Christian to serve
[12:19] him and that's where it's at do you see
[12:21] Amen brother Bram is is saying some very
[12:23] theologically powerful things here he
[12:26] don't even see you it's hid in the blood
[12:29] now that comes from Colossians chapter 3
[12:30] you know three and three for you are
[12:33] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[12:36] God Amen you're actually hid in God the
[12:39] deity of Jesus Christ brother R said I
[12:41] know people don't realize who you are
[12:43] but every person in here can live above
[12:46] sin can live without sin they can live
[12:48] in God you're going to make mistakes but
[12:50] the blood of Christ will forgive you
[12:53] come on Church your sin is not am mean
[12:56] your mistake is not sin in that way but
[12:59] as a Believer you're already been
[13:01] purchased by the blood and Satan is just
[13:03] trying to stop you he's trying to trap
[13:06] you put you in a place that you can't
[13:08] serve God with all your heart because
[13:10] even the devil knows it you might not
[13:12] know it but you are the most powerful
[13:14] force on the face of the Earth as a son
[13:17] or daughter of God if you could feel a
[13:19] complete Liberty this morning under the
[13:21] power of the blood amen there's nothing
[13:23] can stop a Believer once he contacts the
[13:26] reality that God is not holding sin
[13:29] against him but he's free to serve him
[13:32] and love him with all of his heart amen
[13:34] I'll tell you this in the position of
[13:37] the believer brother maram says in 1955
[13:40] he says listen he said inside with
[13:42] Christ shut out of the world the very
[13:44] nature of God is in us but still subject
[13:47] to
[13:49] mistakes isn't that amazing I'm so glad
[13:52] he said that I'm so glad brother
[13:54] brandham outlined this for me because he
[13:57] says the believer is in God he says but
[14:01] subject to mistakes now I don't have
[14:03] time to teach the sermon to you but you
[14:05] know there's a cuckle bur nature on the
[14:08] outside and there's a weak nature on the
[14:10] inside and brother B said long we're in
[14:12] this body there's going to be a little
[14:13] bit of a sticky nature now I don't I I I
[14:16] I don't want to teach a teaching but I
[14:17] want to say it like this God's done
[14:19] something in you and even subject to
[14:22] mistakes but God can't see it now here's
[14:24] what he says because it's covered by the
[14:27] blood and God God can't see through the
[14:33] blood every time he looks through the
[14:36] blood he looks it looks white to him now
[14:40] isn't that amazing that God does look
[14:42] but when he looks he looks through the
[14:44] blood you it's amazing to me that God
[14:47] couldn't even see the Ten Commandments
[14:49] that he wrote without looking to the
[14:51] blood to see them that the law would be
[14:53] dispensed with mercy and thank God this
[14:56] morning that this word comes with Mercy
[14:59] it comes with the blood it comes with
[15:01] the nature and the riches of Christ amen
[15:03] that you don't have to remain a sinner
[15:07] amen and bound in situations but as a
[15:10] Believer you have a total right to
[15:12] Liberty now Joshua chapter 1 and verse 5
[15:15] my Bible says as I was with Moses so
[15:18] will I be with thee and I will not fail
[15:21] thee nor forsake thee 1960 as I was with
[15:23] Moses brother B said it like this Moses
[15:25] had his mistakes he says a great man
[15:28] like like him then when Joshua come up
[15:30] he was going to have his too but God
[15:33] said I was with Moses and so will I be
[15:35] with
[15:36] thee hey man do you know the prophet of
[15:39] God tells us he knew this hour was
[15:41] coming and he knew it was there you know
[15:44] I I find in the age we're living in of
[15:47] course Amen brother bam teaches it all
[15:49] the way back in the 60s and it's only
[15:51] it's only uh exemplified and magnified
[15:53] in our time but we're living in a
[15:55] generation that would like to remove the
[15:57] blood from relationship and worship
[16:00] remove the blood from the church well I
[16:02] I I I have to be honest with you if you
[16:04] remove the blood from a body you have a
[16:06] dead
[16:07] body but the blood is the thing that
[16:10] flows in the body right it's a constant
[16:13] movement is the blood and if you don't
[16:15] have blood in a body you don't have life
[16:17] in a body but you need the blood our
[16:20] songs need to be about blood our
[16:22] ministry has to include the blood our
[16:24] worship has to have the blood because we
[16:27] worship God under the power of his
[16:29] atoning blood and what he's done for us
[16:32] you know the blood you you can look in
[16:34] the Bible and you can see the you can
[16:36] see the thread of the of the blood all
[16:39] the way through the scriptures you know
[16:42] I I I I was just sitting here thinking
[16:44] amen of of how you could just Trail it
[16:47] and I don't go long in it but I'll say
[16:49] this from the very first fall in the
[16:51] Garden of Eden blood showed
[16:53] up it was not an angel it was not it was
[16:57] not just a messenger or a prophet but it
[17:00] was God himself saw his children in
[17:02] problems amen and he went and got
[17:04] something to fix the problem he made a
[17:07] way amen that he might be able to keep
[17:09] his child and God himself killed an
[17:12] animal and brother B said god is perfect
[17:14] in his decisions so his first decision
[17:17] had to be a correct decision and that
[17:20] decision was to use the blood to cover
[17:23] his children to keep them amen and if
[17:25] God did it there he would have to do it
[17:28] in every decision throughout history or
[17:31] the future of the world God chose blood
[17:33] there in the garden when he wrapped his
[17:35] children in a bloody skin it was there
[17:38] when the first lamb died it was Noah the
[17:41] first thing he done after the flood the
[17:44] very first thing that Noah does in the
[17:46] new world is show that the blood is
[17:49] still God's program it was the blood
[17:52] amen that Abraham on a Lonely Mountain
[17:54] with Isaac when he places Isaac on the
[17:57] Altar and he's going to take a human
[17:59] sacrifice but God said not this Blood of
[18:02] this Isaac's going to work but I have a
[18:04] created spoken word over here and it's
[18:07] going to carry a blood that will take
[18:09] the place of your children and the lives
[18:11] of your children and there it was on
[18:13] that Lonely Mountain where there was the
[18:15] slain of an innocent blood oh think of
[18:18] it friend it was there that it spoke
[18:20] from that mountain we're talking about
[18:22] it thousands of years later because it
[18:25] was saying the blood would be what would
[18:27] atone for man time it would be the
[18:29] children of God who were in slavery in
[18:31] Egypt and when they got ready to leave
[18:33] Egypt now how would they leave they
[18:35] would leave under the Seal of the blood
[18:38] it was the blood that brought them out
[18:40] it was the blood that redeemed them it
[18:41] was the blood that set them apart from
[18:43] all the other Egyptians showing us that
[18:46] it would be nothing less than the blood
[18:48] today that that God would be able to
[18:50] separate us and bring us into his Mercy
[18:52] the blood is what stained the ground
[18:55] there at calvary's Cross but it wasn't
[18:57] just any blood it was the blood of God's
[18:59] only begotten son and that blood would
[19:02] speak from the ground it would be
[19:04] different than what Cain's blood when it
[19:06] accused his Brethren and it would put
[19:08] his brother under judgment but this
[19:09] blood that fell on the ground in the
[19:11] middle of the Bible would be that which
[19:13] spoke of redemption and the glory of God
[19:15] that would be what would say the Heathen
[19:18] from the other nations you can see the
[19:19] thread all the way back there with Rahab
[19:22] when Rahab was there see that was saving
[19:24] other nations she was connected to the
[19:26] thread you couldn't see it but you could
[19:28] see that he man I I I don't know how to
[19:31] how to say it but Joshua parallels
[19:33] Ephesians correctly and when the walls
[19:35] of Jericho were falling what is it that
[19:37] saves her so it was blood and coming out
[19:40] and it was blood going in and when they
[19:42] begin to fall the walls of Jericho fell
[19:45] amen ell it's powerful to know Rahab
[19:47] lived in the wall of Jericho and brother
[19:50] said look how thick them walls were she
[19:52] lived in the wall in a house in that
[19:55] wall and our Bible said the wall
[19:58] completely fell down around the walls of
[20:01] Jericho but there was one little section
[20:03] of that entire wall amen that brother R
[20:05] said not even a rock moved out of the
[20:08] wall of rahab's house and what held it
[20:11] all together was that tread that was
[20:13] hanging out that window and let me say
[20:15] this morning in a world that's shaking
[20:17] that thread is still hanging out of the
[20:20] window of the Bride of Jesus Christ when
[20:22] the world is falling apart brother
[20:24] there's a Believer here this morning
[20:26] that is saying my house is under the
[20:29] token and I found the blood and it's
[20:31] been applied to my home it's a thread
[20:34] that held it all together it's a thread
[20:36] that holds congregations together it's a
[20:38] thread that holds families together it's
[20:40] what holds our lives together it's
[20:43] nothing but the blood but all of the
[20:45] blood that was in the Bible only spoke
[20:47] of the blood of the Son of God all the
[20:49] way in the back of the Bible in the
[20:51] middle of the Bible and even in the end
[20:53] of the Bible yeah all the way in
[20:56] Revelations 12 it's being spoken spoke
[20:58] back there and he said it's by the blood
[21:00] of the lamb and the word of the
[21:01] testimony that we would
[21:04] overcome it's in Revelations 19 when he
[21:07] comes from the heavens of Heaven riding
[21:09] on a white horse and he's got a vesture
[21:11] that is dipped in blood it is God's
[21:14] program it has always been his program
[21:17] it will remain God's program it is the
[21:20] blood of Jesus Christ which is an
[21:22] eternal and Redemptive promise to every
[21:26] believer and wants to come to God blood
[21:30] is God's plan in Hebrews the 9th chapter
[21:33] my Bible says that there is no sin
[21:36] remitted without the blood without the
[21:38] shedding of blood there is no remission
[21:40] of sins the blood is God's plan blood
[21:44] has always been God's program blood is
[21:46] God's program and that's the only way
[21:48] that sin can be remitted is by the blood
[21:52] Matthew 26 and 28 for this Blood of the
[21:54] new testament which is shed for many for
[21:57] the remission of sins it was a wine that
[22:00] was being presented to the believer but
[22:03] it was only a symbol of the one that was
[22:05] holding it that the blood of the Son of
[22:08] God would be the only way to remit sin
[22:11] and it would be the blood of this New
[22:13] Covenant Amen in Matthew 26 and 28 it
[22:17] would be for the remission of sins
[22:19] brother bandom tells us in the book of
[22:20] Acts when they started baptizing people
[22:23] of course people begin to say it was by
[22:25] what baptism that sins were remitted
[22:28] entire denominations have built on it's
[22:31] the water that saves you amen but you
[22:34] know what that ain't correct at all
[22:37] because it's the blood that saves man
[22:40] amen the Bible teaches us it was the
[22:42] blood if it was water baptism amen that
[22:45] poor thief on the right would have never
[22:47] made it it was it was they received the
[22:50] Holy Ghost before they were ever
[22:52] baptized the first Gentiles had ever
[22:54] received the Holy Ghost they received it
[22:55] and then were baptized you see you're
[22:58] not saved by the water you're saved by
[23:00] the blood but the blood in this age is
[23:02] not a chemistry that we can sprinkle on
[23:05] you but it's the baptism of the holy
[23:07] ghost that comes on the church that
[23:09] presence you feel this morning that
[23:11] anointing that is upon the church is
[23:14] nothing less than the blood of Jesus
[23:16] Christ and giving back evidence that the
[23:19] blood is real he's raised from the grave
[23:21] we're not here as a bloodless church or
[23:23] a bloodless worship but the anointed
[23:26] worship and the anointed preach ing is a
[23:28] Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus
[23:31] Christ and the blood the blood the blood
[23:35] will never lose its
[23:36] [Applause]
[23:41] power well
[23:43] [Music]
[23:47] Hallelujah my Bible said repentance and
[23:49] remission of sins should be preached in
[23:51] the name among all the
[23:53] nations beginning at Jerusalem Acts
[23:55] chapter 2 said repent and be baptized
[23:58] everyone in the name of Jesus for the
[24:00] remission of
[24:02] sins now I do not believe water remits
[24:07] sins but it's the blood that remits
[24:12] sins in Ephesians 1 and 7 it tells us
[24:15] that
[24:16] Redemption is through the blood isn't
[24:19] that powerful we have
[24:21] Redemption through the blood isn't that
[24:24] amazing that Redemption Could Happen by
[24:27] the of
[24:29] another that Redemption the the
[24:32] redeeming of the church was not your
[24:35] doing at
[24:37] all is't that amazing you cannot pull
[24:41] yourself to the Moon by your
[24:44] bootstraps neither can you cleanse
[24:46] yourself neither can you redeem yourself
[24:49] but but the Bible tells us this it's as
[24:52] if a a a leopard is licking Its
[24:55] Spots amen now you don't what that that
[24:58] means he's only showing the spot really
[25:01] exist when he starts the mud might have
[25:03] mingled the spot with the rest of but
[25:05] when he starts licking it just
[25:08] shines when man tries to cover himself
[25:11] with something besides the blood it just
[25:14] shines it shines Humanity do you see
[25:18] Redemption brother Ram says Ken have
[25:20] been Redeemer Redemption actually is
[25:22] applied in the Greek word to having a
[25:24] slave from a
[25:26] market he said said I can't spell the
[25:28] Greek word just now I like him he I get
[25:32] brother bradam he said I can't spell it
[25:34] and he didn't even try to pronounce
[25:36] it he just says it takes a slave from
[25:40] the
[25:41] market it's redeemed sir to redeem means
[25:45] to take a slave from the
[25:48] market a man has done something wrong
[25:51] Master sold him into slavery actually
[25:53] under death and he's in a market he's a
[25:56] slave but a man comes along a worthy man
[25:58] that's able to do it and he finds this
[26:00] man and finds Grace in his side he
[26:02] redeems him and this takes him from the
[26:04] slave market takes him out to
[26:06] himself notice and the slave once
[26:10] redeemed I I hope you're listening real
[26:12] close sir a slave once
[26:16] redeemed can never be sold in the market
[26:24] again I think it deserves a praise God
[26:36] he can never be sold
[26:39] again he's marketed and if he was
[26:43] thought of enough one time to be
[26:45] redeemed no one can never sell him again
[26:49] for a
[26:51] Slave oh thanks to
[26:54] God that when a man once comes to Christ
[26:58] has been redeemed by the precious blood
[27:01] the devil can never make you a slave
[27:05] again well Hallelujah then the slave
[27:08] belt has been taken off brother we don't
[27:11] have to keep it around just in case but
[27:13] we can throw it away because we'll never
[27:16] need the devil's slave belt again this
[27:18] bride is free and she's not only free
[27:21] for one day she's free until just she
[27:24] takes a Rapture she'll not come back
[27:27] under the slave belt but she is free
[27:30] he's come to Christ has redeemed Us by
[27:32] the precious blood the devil can never
[27:34] make you a slave again you're secure in
[27:37] the blood of Christ until the day of
[27:39] your Redemption a slave look it up in
[27:42] the Exodus and find out if you can't
[27:44] find it levitical law a slave once
[27:46] redeemed can never be sold again as a
[27:50] slave brother Brams reading at levitical
[27:52] law he's telling you that God set you at
[27:55] Liberty not to be in bondage again
[27:58] watch Paul tell you in Galatians 5 he's
[28:01] speaking to people who understood the
[28:03] law and he said Stand Fast in the
[28:06] Liberty wherein Christ has made us free
[28:08] and be not entangled again with the Yoke
[28:10] of bondage look at what he's saying to
[28:13] you now now if you go into the Greek in
[28:15] this it actually means it like this it
[28:18] it literally would mean in our wording
[28:21] it would say for Freedom Christ has set
[28:23] you free he didn't set you free to be a
[28:26] slave he sets you free to be
[28:28] free you see it's just like sometimes
[28:32] people come out of certain situations
[28:33] and and they're looking maybe trying uh
[28:36] the devil tried to put them something so
[28:37] but God never brought you out of one
[28:39] thing to go into something
[28:41] else he brought you out to be
[28:44] free now what because the Bible said if
[28:47] the son shall make you free and John 8
[28:51] he said You shall be free
[28:54] indeed if Jesus made you free you'll not
[28:58] be a bond slave to a church entity or a
[29:01] religion or a denomination or a click of
[29:04] preachers or a great big bunch of people
[29:06] you will be free and free indeed free to
[29:10] love God free to serve God come on
[29:13] Church y'all know what I'm talking about
[29:15] amen I'm tired of people trying to
[29:16] dictate worship to the church amen I
[29:20] believe in Liberty let the quiet people
[29:23] be quiet with Liberty but let the
[29:25] dancers dance with li Liberty let the
[29:28] shouts Shout with Liberty God didn't
[29:31] make everybody the same he made us
[29:34] different but we are different by God's
[29:36] grace and we can have Liberty in our
[29:38] differences because Christ has met us
[29:41] free we are free indeed you know what I
[29:43] mean brother randam said I walked into
[29:45] that Zoo the other day and I seen them
[29:47] Eagle in there beating again them bars
[29:50] he said I'd give everything I had to set
[29:52] him
[29:53] free now brother Brandon wasn't buying
[29:56] him to take him to to the house and put
[29:58] him in the down there in the closet or
[30:00] to put him in his own cage brother
[30:02] Randon wasn't talking about buying the
[30:03] eagle so he can reage him in his own
[30:06] manm B cage he wanted him to go back to
[30:09] the skies he come out of this message
[30:12] never liberated you to put you in
[30:14] another cage of denomination of man's
[30:17] made building listen if this bride is
[30:19] behind bars they are manmade
[30:22] bars God never barred the church God
[30:25] never set the church and
[30:28] amen well glory be to God you can put
[30:31] all the wet blankets you want on it but
[30:33] there's a fire that it's burning in True
[30:35] Word Tabernacle that'll burn up every
[30:38] wet blanket it'll burn up every
[30:40] oppressing spirit amen go back to hell
[30:43] where you come from devil amen we will
[30:45] refuse the oppression of this leot ofan
[30:48] age we are children of the
[30:51] light we worship with
[30:54] [Applause]
[30:56] Liberty
[31:03] so preacher what are you talking about
[31:05] y'all y'all know what I'm talking about
[31:06] everybody's trying to label everybody
[31:08] right now you're either on the
[31:09] intellectual side formalism or you're on
[31:13] the fanatical worship side where it's
[31:15] just emotional driven and everybody
[31:18] tried to make you one or the other well
[31:19] look we ain't
[31:21] [Applause]
[31:22] either brother B said if I could get the
[31:25] fundamentals to get with the people who
[31:27] worship if I could just get them
[31:29] together well this is that this right
[31:32] here is that the prophet said that's
[31:35] what I want and brother I believe the
[31:37] word of God is produced assemblies amen
[31:40] that believe the message and you can't
[31:42] teach it too deep and you can't teach it
[31:45] too strong but brother you better get
[31:47] out of the way cuz this message has
[31:48] power in it and it starts releasing
[31:51] worship within
[31:54] them I know I know I know it's
[31:58] oppositional but listen for such a time
[32:01] was you put
[32:02] here to meet the opposition right right
[32:07] now anybody knows that that's the that's
[32:09] the opposition right that's the
[32:11] challenge if you're a real
[32:13] worshipper and it's funny I I'll watch
[32:15] you I I'll show you something real quick
[32:16] now we'll move on I I I can't preach too
[32:18] long I got some preaching to do
[32:23] but y'all know what I'm talking about
[32:28] but you watch this how many quiet people
[32:30] in here ever felt pressure to be
[32:32] something different than you were I mean
[32:33] honest from your heart felt like
[32:35] somebody was pushing you for amens and
[32:37] pushing you for sure you felt that way
[32:40] sir the same way you feel about that I
[32:42] feel that way when someone says I can't
[32:46] amen isn't that a it's the same thing
[32:48] just turn different so it should be a
[32:52] liberty right so so so that that
[32:56] wherever God can just have
[32:58] Liberty because then it feels now how
[33:01] many people in here that shouted and
[33:02] danced that have filed a pressure to not
[33:05] do that just be honest
[33:08] now yes sir do you see that the devil
[33:12] the opposition is to pressure both sides
[33:15] to make them uncomfortable where they
[33:17] can't relax themselves in the presence
[33:19] of God so if someone's teaching on the
[33:21] teaching side the shouters will think
[33:24] well they're against me and they'll get
[33:25] quieter and Tighter but then you get on
[33:27] the other side and somebody pushing for
[33:29] amens and then the quieter people will
[33:31] start tightening up even tighter because
[33:33] quiet people are not nor
[33:36] noty don't never mix up quiet with
[33:42] tight we got some quiet people in here
[33:44] that'll pull the buttons off of my
[33:48] shirt we're not preaching from here
[33:50] we're preaching from
[33:52] here it ain't the noise level it's the
[33:55] anointing and the spirit when it begins
[33:57] to pull it opens a gift and out of that
[34:00] gift then starts flowing things that
[34:03] transpires in the life so it's an
[34:05] opposition but through the blood cell
[34:07] we've got a boldness to meet the
[34:09] opposition and you've been anointed to
[34:11] meet the opposition for such a time like
[34:13] this has God anointed
[34:16] you who gave himself for our sins that
[34:19] he might Deliver Us from this present
[34:22] evil world so this Blood he gave would
[34:25] be a deliverer from the present evil
[34:27] from the darkness of this age in
[34:30] Colossians 1 he says he has delivered us
[34:33] from the power of
[34:34] Darkness now it's easy to say power of
[34:37] Darkness watch the next verse and
[34:38] translated us into the kingdom of his
[34:40] dear son so darkness and Kingdom watch
[34:42] what he's doing he's switching from
[34:44] light and darkness to Kingdom so he's
[34:46] using darkness in one and Kingdom in the
[34:47] other telling you Satan's kingdom is
[34:50] just one word
[34:52] off but God is taking you out from under
[34:56] s Satan's kingdom and placing you in the
[35:00] Kingdom of his son where the word is
[35:02] given power where the word is giving
[35:05] power translated watch this next verse
[35:08] in whom we have Redemption through his
[35:11] blood even the Forgiveness of sins watch
[35:14] him separate him again Redemption and
[35:17] the Forgiveness of sins brother bam is
[35:18] translating this as meaning that the
[35:21] redeemed still have the blood for their
[35:23] sins Hallelujah their mistakes thank you
[35:27] they're failures Hallelujah Redemption
[35:29] now watch here in the Greek I'll give
[35:31] you the word here amen it actually means
[35:34] Redemption we're still on Redemption
[35:36] redemption or Deliverance it means a
[35:39] releasing affected by payment of Ransom
[35:44] amen a releasing that has been caused by
[35:48] payment or
[35:50] Ransom See Redemption means a
[35:52] Deliverance or a Liberation preceded by
[35:56] the payment of a ransom in Matthew
[35:58] chapter 20 Amen in verse 28 even the son
[36:02] of man came not to be ministered unto
[36:04] but to minister and gave his
[36:07] life a ransom somebody say Ransom with
[36:10] me a li a
[36:12] ransom so all of you know somebody
[36:15] kidnapped somebody here while back there
[36:16] was arist of of a big a big family out
[36:19] in California got kidnapped by The
[36:20] Liberation Army uh it's been years and
[36:23] years back but she was in out there and
[36:25] they were demanding millions of handsome
[36:27] for her demanding Millions for just one
[36:30] person because she had a wealthy
[36:32] family and here the scripture says we
[36:34] have Redemption through his grace even
[36:36] the Forgiveness of sins because of the
[36:39] riches of his grace amen so God's grace
[36:43] was so rich that that he was demanding a
[36:46] ransom that exceeds what anybody else
[36:49] could
[36:50] pay can you imagine that you were worth
[36:54] more to God and he put such a pain
[36:56] payment of Ransom on you that nobody
[36:59] else could redeem
[37:03] you think about it God set a price on
[37:06] you only he could
[37:08] pay by doing that he knew no one else
[37:11] would ever own
[37:13] you Hallelujah he put a price tag nobody
[37:17] else can pay it nobody else can pay what
[37:21] God desired for you to be paid for he
[37:23] put that kind of price tag and then he
[37:25] knew only he could pay the price for
[37:28] your Ransom so the Bible said he gave
[37:30] his life for a ransom for many man
[37:35] I Hallelujah 1 Timothy Chapter 2 and
[37:38] verse 6 he gave himself a ransom for all
[37:43] to be testified in due time acts chap 20
[37:46] and verse 28 look what he said take heed
[37:48] therefore unto yourselves and feed the
[37:50] flock of the Holy Ghost have made you
[37:52] overseer to feed the Church of God which
[37:55] he had purchased with his own
[37:59] blood now sometimes people wonder why
[38:02] that I take the direction towards the
[38:03] church I do and mostly it's always
[38:05] positive isn't it I'll tell you why I'll
[38:08] give you a secret because you're the
[38:10] Blood Bought bride of Jesus
[38:15] Christ this is the
[38:18] wife of Jesus Christ this is the queen
[38:22] of all of Heaven might just be somebody
[38:26] almost nobody to some people but in
[38:29] heaven the greatest Price that has ever
[38:32] been paid to Ransom anything that has
[38:34] ever lived was paid for you brother
[38:37] random actually says it like this he
[38:39] said which would be more precious he
[38:41] says the thing or the thing it buys he
[38:44] said if we had a blood drop of Jesus
[38:47] Christ how we would cherish that blood
[38:49] drop he said but look it it purchased a
[38:53] people so the people it bought is worth
[38:56] more than the blood that was given for
[38:58] it so we're literally handling the
[39:01] purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ to
[39:03] me to me it's the greatest uh
[39:06] opportunity in the world to address the
[39:09] queen of all of Heaven yes
[39:11] sir to remind you that the price has
[39:15] been paid for you and you've been
[39:16] liberated from God by God bought with a
[39:20] price for you are 1 Corinthians 6: 20
[39:22] you are bought with a price you are
[39:25] bought with a prize that's why we are
[39:27] not our own we've been bought with a
[39:29] prize amen now in First Peter chapter 1
[39:32] watch what Peter brings around amen he
[39:35] said for as much as you know that you
[39:36] were not redeemed with corruptible
[39:38] things of silver and gold from your vain
[39:41] conversation received by tradition from
[39:43] your fathers now I don't have time to
[39:45] dig into this but I want to say this to
[39:47] you in the Old Testament you heard me
[39:49] mention it Sunday morning when I said
[39:51] that a a priest would place a value on a
[39:54] soul they actually had had prices for
[39:57] the number of men who were of a certain
[39:59] age in the sanctuary and they put gold
[40:02] and silver in the Tabernacle that was a
[40:05] payment for them firstborn Sons had to
[40:09] be bought out of the firstborn because
[40:11] they were brought out of the priesthood
[40:13] otherwise they immediately a firstborn
[40:14] son would become a priest amen that's
[40:17] why you called The Church of the
[40:18] firstborn but you would but but there
[40:19] was a payment that was made but but but
[40:22] it was it was a prize a ransom paid
[40:24] silver and gold do you but it's a
[40:26] powerful thing to watch in scripture cuz
[40:28] nobody ever paid a ransom for Jesus in
[40:31] his birth and being a firstborn son he
[40:34] become a
[40:35] priest though after the order of mecdc
[40:38] he come from the line of Judah not from
[40:40] Levi he had no right as a levite as a
[40:43] Jew he had no right as a priest but he
[40:46] come through the line of Judah and
[40:47] become a king priest now y'all know
[40:50] there was no price paid for his birth so
[40:53] he had to enter the service of the
[40:55] priesthood as a
[40:57] firstborn the scripture said he was the
[40:59] firstborn of many
[41:01] Brethren now there was then gold and
[41:04] silver in the Old Testament was placed
[41:05] in the treasuries for the Redemption of
[41:08] the souls because God knew the price had
[41:11] to be paid but watch how Peter says this
[41:14] but you can't redeem these people with
[41:17] gold and silver am right listen there's
[41:19] not enough gold in the world to redeem
[41:22] you on now you could take all of the
[41:25] gold in the world and it could not buy
[41:27] one
[41:29] Soul you could take all the silver there
[41:31] is in the world and it could not redeem
[41:34] or ransom one Soul that's why Peter says
[41:37] in the next verse he said but with the
[41:39] precious blood of Christ as a lamb
[41:42] without BL and now that word precious oh
[41:45] precious is the flow that makes me
[41:48] whiter than snow no other Fountain I
[41:51] know it's nothing but the blood of Jesus
[41:54] it would seem to be just blood but it
[41:56] could do what no other blood could do
[41:59] for 4,000 years they had bled animals
[42:02] and oxen and poured out thousands and
[42:04] thousands and thousands of gallon and of
[42:06] blood and it had never removed one sin
[42:09] from anybody it only pushed it Forward
[42:12] amen they paid ransoms and it didn't
[42:14] help and they piled gold in the
[42:16] sanctuaries and it didn't help but one
[42:19] drop of the blood of Jesus Christ was so
[42:22] precious that it could pay the payment
[42:25] of the sin that was against man from the
[42:27] Garden of Eden all the way to the
[42:30] rapturing of the church I don't know if
[42:32] you've ever thought about it but the
[42:33] blood of Jesus Paid the debt of Adam and
[42:36] all the way through Abraham and Moses
[42:38] and every child that God had up through
[42:40] them ages and if you're an Old Testament
[42:42] Bible reader he was a bunch of
[42:44] Scallywags come up through that Isaac
[42:46] line but the blood paid it for it all
[42:48] the blood paid for David's problems and
[42:50] Solomon's problems and Abraham's
[42:52] problems it paid for the whole thing it
[42:55] paid for every disob obedience it paid
[42:57] for every trouble it pray for every
[42:59] adultery it pray for every broken but
[43:02] listen brother it's more powerful than
[43:04] that this payment is so powerful that
[43:07] one payment at the cross would remove
[43:10] sin forever from the blood amen of the
[43:13] children of God who would be Abraham's
[43:15] line there was sin forgiven at the cross
[43:18] that you hadn't even committed
[43:21] yet the payment was made and the sin was
[43:25] disced was destroyed that you haven't
[43:28] even committed Yet brother Darren there
[43:30] is no trustee in the world that could
[43:32] foretell all of the expenses of a church
[43:35] and we're about ready to get to build a
[43:37] church here before long Brother Ray has
[43:38] a few things to say to help us uh
[43:41] understand where we are in the process
[43:42] but let me say this to you the best you
[43:45] can plan you're going to have to add
[43:47] cost to
[43:49] it you can say it's going to cost D D D
[43:52] D and put a dot and that's the end of it
[43:54] but brother it's not to you finish that
[43:56] you know our trustees are good ones but
[43:59] none of them has a sharp enough pencil
[44:01] to tell us in 10 years where our church
[44:04] will be financially what it will need
[44:06] and how it will have no debt or we have
[44:08] nobody available that can do that right
[44:11] now but our lord Jesus from Calvary he
[44:15] screamed the last words out of his lips
[44:18] and said it is
[44:20] finished the some of the greatest words
[44:23] that would ever be spoken from human
[44:24] lips it is finished the debt has been
[44:28] paid from Adam all the way to the change
[44:31] of the church it is finished amen sin
[44:34] debt had been settled now think about
[44:36] this
[44:39] folks now some of these sicknesses that
[44:41] were having now our doctors wouldn't
[44:43] have knew about in the 50s and
[44:47] 60s but when he took them stripes in his
[44:50] back he paid the payment of every
[44:54] disease
[44:56] and every
[44:57] sin everything that was and would come
[45:01] no wonder Paul could say that things
[45:04] present nor things past nor things
[45:07] future can separate me from the love of
[45:09] God there has been a payment made that
[45:12] no man could retract no man could sell
[45:15] me back into slavery we are free by the
[45:18] blood of Jesus
[45:21] Christ may I say it I wish I had the
[45:24] voice of a thousand angels to say it the
[45:27] precious
[45:29] blood of
[45:32] Jesus oh my God my God my
[45:38] God the precious
[45:41] blood s the precious blood the one that
[45:44] could use an evangelist's hand to touch
[45:47] a tumor and make it disappear that's the
[45:49] blood I'm talking about I'm talking
[45:52] about the blood that can come down in
[45:54] the prayer line and Swit the anointing

[46:44] nothing else can
[46:45] do it can pay what nothing else can pay
[46:49] it can clean the hearts that nothing
[46:51] else can clean the Bible called it the
[46:54] Fuller soap
[46:56] is't that amazing brother man said what
[46:58] could clean the hands of Lady mcabe he
[47:00] said I tell you the blood of Jesus not
[47:02] can only clean the hand it can clean her
[47:04] heart and I don't care what sinner I

[47:39] blood oh if I was a singer I'd break out
[47:42] in song what can wash away my sins
[47:45] nothing but the blood of
[47:48] Jesus what is it could make me whole
[47:52] again brother levit it's nothing but the
[47:54] blood of Jesus
[47:59] some things are better left alone
[48:03] folks listen when you get something
[48:05] fixed quit digging it up and buing and
[48:07] burying some people say brother Wayne
[48:09] I'm going to go back through these
[48:10] things I'm going to go back through my
[48:12] past and brother I'm going I'm going to
[48:14] fix all these things sometimes you're
[48:15] not fixing sometimes you're tearing
[48:18] up because if the blood has forgave you
[48:21] leave it there and go on with
[48:24] God
[48:27] come on about every time you get one
[48:29] step up the rung the devil pours
[48:31] condemnation on you and tries to drive
[48:34] you back 20 years in your life Paul said
[48:36] this very thing he said I have not yet
[48:39] reached Perfection but this thing I do I
[48:42] forget the things that are behind me and
[48:45] I press on to the mark of the high
[48:47] calling in Christ Jesus listen well
[48:50] glory to God we don't need a couch for
[48:52] the psychologist we need an altar with a
[48:55] power of God can cleanse hearts and
[48:57] minds and change
[48:59] [Applause]
[49:02] lives it's the precious blood of
[49:05] Jesus that was for ordained before the
[49:08] foundation of the world to manifest it
[49:11] let me say this very clearly it was not
[49:12] human
[49:14] blood that's why it's so precious it
[49:17] wasn't human blood it was God's blood
[49:19] brother man said how was it God's blood
[49:21] he said God condescended through the
[49:23] word and came in the womb of a woman
[49:25] amen and brought a creative blood that
[49:27] would change
[49:29] lives it washed in Revelations 1:5 amen
[49:33] it's John that says brother Abraham is
[49:36] John that he just opens up and says that
[49:39] he that has loved us and washed us from
[49:41] our sins in his own
[49:43] blood brother Bram comes along and he
[49:45] said the word wash is not a good word
[49:47] there he said let's use this word
[49:51] loosed let's loose the people from their
[49:54] sins Hallelujah
[49:56] yes
[49:59] Lord now if the son has set you
[50:02] free you're
[50:06] free GL the word means loose brother Ram
[50:10] says if it was the blood of God the
[50:12] blood of the Lamb the Precious Blood of
[50:13] lamb first Peter the Precious Blood of
[50:15] the Lamb they call it the blood of lamb
[50:18] in one scripture but the blood of God in
[50:20] another
[50:22] scripture so that was God's lamb right
[50:26] and it done what no other lamb could
[50:29] do Redemption is through the blood
[50:33] Colossians 1:14 said in whom we have
[50:35] Redemption through his blood in Isaiah
[50:38] 53:10 it said it pleased the Lord to
[50:40] bruise him he have put to grief when
[50:42] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[50:47] sin he became our high priest and a
[50:51] priest was to offer blood is that right
[50:55] the blood that the high priest offered
[50:57] in the Old Testament they had to offer
[50:59] it every year isn't that amazing it was
[51:02] an atonement date y Kapur they've done
[51:04] it every
[51:05] year because the power of the blood of a
[51:09] sacrifice could not pay the
[51:12] ransom so they had to redo it every year
[51:16] amen but here the Bible Paul is this
[51:19] great Master teacher brother Bram calls
[51:20] him this great Master teacher says this
[51:24] that by the blood of
[51:26] Jesus he entered one
[51:30] time he went in one
[51:34] time I want you to hear me now he
[51:37] entered in one
[51:39] time and perfected forever those that
[51:43] are
[51:44] Sanctified amen you don't need
[51:46] perfecting every week he entered in one
[51:49] time he went in one time and it was
[51:51] enough the Bible said he did it
[51:54] once and for
[51:57] all isn't that powerful so brother Wayne
[52:00] I'll tell you what man we we we we've
[52:02] got issues and we need another
[52:04] crucifixion do you know that's one of
[52:05] Moses's
[52:07] mistakes it's right there in the
[52:09] scripture one of Moses's biggest
[52:10] mistakes is because the The Rock was in
[52:13] the wilderness now we didn't know The
[52:15] Rock was Christ until Paul comes along
[52:18] and said that rock was
[52:20] Christ and then brother random comes
[52:22] along and picks it up and he said it was
[52:23] a masterpiece but it had yet been formed
[52:26] it was Christ in prefigure he said and
[52:28] when God had the children of Israel come
[52:31] under judgment Moses Struck it with his
[52:33] Rod a wooden stick showing Calvary in
[52:36] the desert gave them
[52:39] life moisture come from the rock isn't
[52:42] that powerful but a little later they
[52:45] needed water again and God said to Moses
[52:47] speak to the Rock and he smoke the rock
[52:52] again and the prophet said he broke the
[52:54] scripture when he did it right but God
[52:58] still honored his
[53:02] word now put that in a legal box and
[53:04] tell me how it comes
[53:08] out see now watch this God still honored
[53:11] his word but brother B said but what he
[53:13] done was testified of a second
[53:15] crucifixion he said and Jesus wouldn't
[53:18] have to die again because one time would
[53:21] be
[53:23] enough isn't it amazing that one time in
[53:27] the presence of the blood of Jesus
[53:29] Christ is Enough it is enough to take a
[53:32] man from a bar stool and fill him with
[53:35] the Holy Ghost it's enough to take a
[53:37] religion out of a man and put the Holy
[53:40] Ghost in him just one drop will'll
[53:44] do I tell you what I I love the
[53:47] songwriters that climb up this mountain
[53:49] where there still Springs a fountain
[53:52] there's still a fountain flowing in the
[53:54] house of David a spring of the
[53:57] righteousness of the blood that could
[53:59] wash a man this blood has become the
[54:02] mediator of a brand new testament The
[54:04] Testament the New Testament it was Jesus
[54:07] that prayed it according to Paul he said
[54:09] I come to do thy will oh Lord he said I
[54:12] come to do thy will oh God see
[54:15] sacrifices and offerings he would have
[54:17] not but a body thou Hast prepared Jesus
[54:19] body prepared sacrifice as a lamb to the
[54:22] slaughter Jesus was slain to pay the
[54:25] ransom price for the church and he
[54:28] Sanctified us through the offering of
[54:30] the body of Jesus Christ once and for
[54:32] all it was the will of
[54:36] God hear it in Paul he came to do the
[54:40] will of God hear it in Jesus prayer in
[54:43] the Garden of Gethsemane not my
[54:46] will but thy will be done first shedding
[54:50] of the blood seven sheddings first one
[54:52] took place in the garden he died for the
[54:55] will of man when his blood dropped as
[54:58] sweat out of his brow in painful Agony
[55:01] he gave up his own will as a human being
[55:03] brother B said he could have had a
[55:05] family he could have had children he
[55:07] said he could have had a normal life but
[55:09] he set all of that aside for the will of
[55:11] God to die as a sacrifice for the church
[55:15] hallelujah thank
[55:17] youus see nothing else will work and he
[55:20] said it and you've heard me say it
[55:21] before but he said it very clearly when
[55:24] he said
[55:25] if there be some other
[55:28] way let the cup pass from
[55:31] me if there might be another way so he
[55:35] he know assuredly there's not another
[55:38] way this is God's only provided
[55:41] way somebody says well come and join the
[55:44] church sorry it's not the way come and
[55:48] shake a hand with the preacher it's not
[55:49] the way come put your name on our book
[55:52] it's not the way can we join your church
[55:55] brother Bram said I've been a brandom
[55:57] for 40 years I never joined the
[56:01] family he said I was born into the
[56:04] family and it's the family of God you
[56:06] don't have to join the family you're
[56:08] born into the
[56:11] family brother bam said of course he was
[56:13] born of brandom so when you're born
[56:16] again you're born not by your human name
[56:20] you're born by a new name this this
[56:23] Blood has redeemed us from the curse of
[56:26] the
[56:27] law this Blood according to Revelations
[56:30] 5:9 has redeemed us to God
[56:34] Hallelujah the Bible said when John saw
[56:37] this he saw his name on the book and
[56:39] when it opened
[56:40] up now it's amazing to me that some of
[56:43] the end time preachers even in the
[56:44] message when they seen the old of the
[56:46] seals they quit preaching the blood
[56:49] thinking that Mercy had quit when John
[56:51] didn't even scream about the blood till
[56:53] the book opened
[56:56] but when the book opened he held a
[56:58] Revival on the blood he held a Revival
[57:01] and begin to sing songs about it that
[57:04] the blood has redeemed us out of every
[57:06] Kindred Nation tongue and people the
[57:08] blood the blood has done it for us it
[57:11] was God's plan is God's plan will always
[57:13] be God's
[57:16] plan it is the law of Redemption how
[57:20] many remembers the law of redemption
[57:21] brother B tells the law of redemption
[57:24] I'm not read it to you but the law of
[57:26] redemption brother M includes it in the
[57:28] law of
[57:29] Kinsmen and then he brings it to the law
[57:31] of redemption gives us two different
[57:33] laws law of redemption law of Kinsmen
[57:36] the law of
[57:37] redemption he he tells it powerful in
[57:39] the kinsman
[57:41] redeemer brother Tom spoke a lot about
[57:43] kinsman redeemer last weekend I thought
[57:44] it was very good amen Ty Ruth and Boaz
[57:47] in there but you but you it's amazing
[57:50] because it it's reliving again now
[57:53] because we're returning to Israel we see
[57:55] Israel returning to its Nation as in the
[57:58] Book of Ruth you have a Holocaust in the
[58:01] 1940s you had one start in the Book of
[58:02] Ruth they all died and then they went to
[58:05] their Homeland and Ruth went with them
[58:07] do you know that when the prophet came
[58:09] on the scene he said three prophets come
[58:11] out between the sixth and seven seal he
[58:13] said two went to Israel and one come to
[58:15] the Gentiles so it was happening at the
[58:18] same time now they ain't showed up yet
[58:20] out there but they'll be there and it
[58:22] was happening at the same time but when
[58:24] Ruth got there she needed a Kinsman to
[58:27] meet the law of
[58:29] redemption and remember whenever that
[58:32] Boaz decided to redeem her I'm not going
[58:33] to preach on it when Boaz decided to
[58:35] redeem her that he had to go to the
[58:37] elders and
[58:39] testify because he had to meet the
[58:41] requirements of the law so when he be to
[58:45] explain how he was kin to Naomi and he
[58:48] had a right to the land she owned and
[58:51] that he could redeem it amen the Bible
[58:53] says that they had had to they had to
[58:55] acknowledge he's worthy
[58:58] Kinsman when John saw this in Revelation
[59:01] chapter 5 whenever they saw the lamb
[59:03] come out with the book The Bible said
[59:06] all of the
[59:07] elders begin to say Worthy is the Lamb
[59:12] he didn't come to do away with the law
[59:14] he come to fulfill the law and when the
[59:17] law was fulfilled Even Heaven had to say
[59:20] he's worthy to be the Kinsman of these
[59:23] people he is is their blood sacrifice
[59:26] and lamb and they have the right now to
[59:28] all of the
[59:30] inheritance that has been lost law of
[59:33] kinsman brother B says the law of
[59:35] kinsman is best explained because you
[59:37] can actually uh I'm going to use a
[59:39] better
[59:40] word for for our young people but it's
[59:43] best explained when you talk about the
[59:45] Redemption of a of a
[59:48] donkey and brother BR said any old
[59:50] donkey can be
[59:52] redeemed any old donkey but brother BR
[59:55] said but particular case he tells it you
[59:57] remember and he said particular case was
[59:59] when one donkey was born he said he was
[1:00:01] a little donkey first born he said he
[1:00:02] had Lop ears and crossey and knot knees
[1:00:05] and bold legs y'all heard him talk about
[1:00:06] it he said he was an ugly
[1:00:09] fell and he said when a little boy got
[1:00:12] little little fella got up you know I
[1:00:13] don't know maybe he wandered over to a
[1:00:15] pond or to a creek or something but he
[1:00:16] got a reflection of himself yeah because
[1:00:20] it scared him and he said you know what
[1:00:23] I'm probably going to die the first
[1:00:25] first moment that farmer lays eyes on me
[1:00:28] he's going to take my life because I'm
[1:00:30] useless to him and and and and brother
[1:00:34] Bram said he had a good scripture taught
[1:00:36] mother and said she seen the state he
[1:00:38] was in and said what's wrong with you
[1:00:40] said well I seen myself the other day
[1:00:42] and my ears are lot my back is bold and
[1:00:46] my knees are not my eyes are crossed I'm
[1:00:48] all I'm just all messed up this farmer
[1:00:52] ain't going to want me for nothing he's
[1:00:53] going to kill me and she she said but
[1:00:55] wait a minute you don't know the law
[1:00:57] here so what law is that there's a law
[1:01:00] that can save you it's called The Law of
[1:01:02] redemption and said what it is is that
[1:01:04] here in Israel when when a mule is born
[1:01:08] that a farmer has to offer a lamb for
[1:01:11] the first born of the Matrix it has to
[1:01:13] it has to offer a lamb for this mule she
[1:01:15] said so son when the farmer comes out
[1:01:18] he's not looking for a mule to sacrifice
[1:01:21] they don't sacrifice mules here they
[1:01:23] sacrifice Lambs
[1:01:25] he said so he's going to look for a
[1:01:26] perfect
[1:01:28] lamb so in the morning when the when the
[1:01:30] farmer comes out he's not even looking
[1:01:33] over to mule he sees there's a mule
[1:01:34] there but then he goes to looking
[1:01:36] looking for a
[1:01:38] lamb and when he finds that perfect lamb
[1:01:40] he bottles him up and takes him in I can
[1:01:43] see that little fellow over there with
[1:01:45] his knot KNE and crosseyed and he's
[1:01:47] having him a
[1:01:50] time probably knocked over a song
[1:01:53] book
[1:02:00] you know what it was about it was about
[1:02:03] that there was a it was there was a lamb
[1:02:06] and he had to examine that lamb to
[1:02:09] see so when they started examining the
[1:02:12] lamb brother B said see he never
[1:02:14] examined the
[1:02:19] donkey if you ever catch this
[1:02:23] Revelation he not trying to examine
[1:02:26] you he examines your
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:32] lamb my lamb is the perfect Son of God
[1:02:37] and the scripture said we were accepted
[1:02:40] in the Beloved and the Bible said this
[1:02:43] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:02:46] pleased My Sacrifice has accepted in
[1:02:49] Calvary it was accepted in heaven My
[1:02:52] Sacrifice is the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] so when God comes down this morning he's
[1:02:57] not looking at me he's looking at My
[1:02:59] Sacrifice oh the blood of Jesus this
[1:03:03] morning that comes across the church to
[1:03:05] realize he's not looking at
[1:03:08] you he's looking at your
[1:03:11] sacrifice hallelu Hallelujah some of you
[1:03:15] some of you got troubles and I I know
[1:03:16] you
[1:03:17] do some of your home some of your family
[1:03:20] some of the
[1:03:22] issues and I know some sometimes you run
[1:03:24] into
[1:03:25] problems and sometimes as ministers
[1:03:28] Brother Ray can really agree with me
[1:03:29] here on this he he he'll understand this
[1:03:31] portion real
[1:03:33] well sometimes people can't
[1:03:35] understand how you can work with certain
[1:03:38] individuals because they have already
[1:03:39] decided that they're not
[1:03:42] workable
[1:03:44] sincerely the difference is a
[1:03:47] burden and when God puts a burden on
[1:03:50] your heart to help
[1:03:52] someone you see things
[1:03:55] differently it's kind of like a kind of
[1:03:57] like Aiden seeing an old house and he
[1:03:59] sees a home place somebody else may have
[1:04:01] just seen an old house but go by and
[1:04:03] look at it looks pretty good these days
[1:04:05] but he saw something he wanted to
[1:04:08] fix and instead of letting somebody say
[1:04:10] well that ain't no you you're just
[1:04:11] wasting your time there he said it ain't
[1:04:14] wasting time I want to be here I got a
[1:04:16] burden here and I have the ability to do
[1:04:18] this and so he started
[1:04:20] working until now you it don't even
[1:04:23] resemble
[1:04:25] but you know even prophets feel this way
[1:04:27] in the Bible have you ever read the book
[1:04:29] of
[1:04:31] Hosea do you know that the prophet was
[1:04:33] wondering how God do you put up with
[1:04:35] these people I'll just put it I'll just
[1:04:37] put it simple he was a little bit
[1:04:41] uh Lord how do you keep dealing with
[1:04:46] these
[1:04:50] people and God said I want you to go
[1:04:52] take a wife of whoredom yeah
[1:04:56] yeah you're going to understand me in a
[1:05:00] minute and he goes and takes a wife and
[1:05:02] has children by her now his
[1:05:05] family is
[1:05:07] invested so he's going to teach Hosea
[1:05:11] what Grace
[1:05:13] means sometimes you have to go outside
[1:05:16] of your reasoning to hold something
[1:05:19] together the law might say this needs to
[1:05:22] be done and that needs to be done but
[1:05:25] Grace but Grace thank God for Grace
[1:05:29] that'll look at the same situation and
[1:05:31] say no we don't have to throw it away
[1:05:33] Grace can fix
[1:05:35] this amen and you know you know the
[1:05:38] story so hose's wife she does what she's
[1:05:41] been doing her whole life and she goes
[1:05:44] right back into whoredom but this time
[1:05:46] she's
[1:05:48] married it's different
[1:05:51] now do you see after you become a
[1:05:53] Christian Christian it's different now
[1:05:55] yeah am you say well I'm going to go
[1:05:58] back and do go
[1:06:00] ahead just go
[1:06:02] on you just go do whatever you want to
[1:06:04] do just go do it we ain't holding you
[1:06:06] from doing
[1:06:07] nothing do you know what's going to
[1:06:09] happen about three days
[1:06:11] in you're going to find yourself on the
[1:06:13] motel floor and you're going to say God
[1:06:16] why am I acting like
[1:06:19] this you're going to be in your bedroom
[1:06:21] somewhere and you're going to throw that
[1:06:24] something whatever you're holding you'll
[1:06:25] throw it again the wall and you'll say
[1:06:27] I'm a Son of God I don't want this in my
[1:06:30] life because come on I know I know that
[1:06:35] once you're married it's different now
[1:06:37] and once you're saved it's different now
[1:06:40] you can't be the old Jew
[1:06:42] anymore you can run you can hide you can
[1:06:45] do whatever you want you will never be
[1:06:47] that old man anymore he's dead and he
[1:06:50] can never be sold back into slavery
[1:06:53] again
[1:06:56] God paid a price for you you're a free
[1:06:59] church he paid for you he redeemed you
[1:07:02] he ransomed
[1:07:05] you y'all know the story so the Bible
[1:07:08] said that Hosea went down there and
[1:07:09] bought
[1:07:10] her he went down there and B he bought
[1:07:14] his own wife amen silver and
[1:07:19] barley which only is a story to tell
[1:07:22] Hosea if you ever had your wife in the
[1:07:25] shape my wife's end You' pay the price
[1:07:28] to get her out of
[1:07:29] it and to every individual sitting here
[1:07:32] this morning I want you to know that the
[1:07:34] ultimate price has been paid the
[1:07:37] ultimate price has been paid for your
[1:07:39] life for your families it's been paid
[1:07:41] for every person brother Eric testify to
[1:07:44] everybody you can and tell them as long
[1:07:45] as they got life in their ball as long
[1:07:48] as life is moving through I don't care
[1:07:49] what denomination they are I don't care
[1:07:52] what church they're in if it's the life
[1:07:54] is in their body they have an
[1:07:56] opportunity to serve God and and and God
[1:07:59] help us to remember

[1:08:42] box or something in there so
[1:08:44] they had to look at you know but I I
[1:08:47] went ahead and entered in the whole

[1:09:33] anybody ever been there maybe it wasn't
[1:09:36] chewing tobacco but you
[1:09:38] know now I was counting up the
[1:09:41] days and a voice spoke to me just as
[1:09:44] clear and he said you've never done it
[1:09:48] in the first
[1:09:49] place in the moment when that
[1:09:51] come and it was another he spoke right
[1:09:54] behind it and he said and you will never
[1:09:57] have to do it again and when the
[1:10:01] presence of God settled on
[1:10:03] me I left that church service that day
[1:10:05] and next day I was driving and I was
